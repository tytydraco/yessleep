September 1st, 2021

It’s been about two weeks now since I finished my service, and I’m not hurting for cash, just in need of something to distract me. Buddy of mine suggested Private Investigative work, even did all the paperwork for me. Now I’ve got a number and a piece of paper that says I can take pictures of people in public spaces, not that you can’t already. I think it’s more supposed to build community trust in standards or something. Unsure, don’t care really. I’m just glad to be outside.

Or I was, for the first few days. I’ve been on my first case for 72 hours now. I don’t sleep much so I don’t mind it, but it’s something dreadful for boredom. I’ve been following one “Mr. Macabee” at his husband’s request, noting any discrepancies between his actions and his text conversations with the client. Making sure at the store means not at Aaron’s house, or any other gentleman of the night. Once an hour or so Clancy sends me a screenshot of every single text between them. Every. Single. Hour.

I personally don’t believe Macabee is cheating, but for 50 dollars on the hour (plus fees) I’ll feed a goldfish. Plus it beats pacing my single bedroom apartment until exhaustion takes me. Nothing odd at all has occurred, not until this exact moment. It’s after work for Mr. Macabee, and he should be picking up produce for whatever scheduled cookie cutter meal his house husband is making, but he’s stopped at a place most unusual. The marina.

There’s no boats in it. It’s a small town, likely everyone is out and about on a crisp evening so I don't think he’s meeting anyone, but I’ll get closer just in case. I disembark from my car–beat-up thing nearly old enough to vote–and try to appear as unassuming as I can. Beach isn’t deserted so I make small talk with a couple as I watch Macabee in my peripherals. I’ve learned to keep distinctive things in my sideline focus, with his being a permanent limping gait, some boating accident or other. He also wears shirts that would put a parrot to shame, brightest thing out in a given moment.

His vibrant plumage skulks its way into a small grotto I hadn’t seen a moment before so I break away from the people I wasn’t listening to anyway and try to remain as quiet as possible. About 5 meters from the entrance of the cave– it was a grotto a moment before? A shallow thing with sunlight illuminating every inch of it– as I make my way to the cave I can hear a building whisper, almost humming.



***Do you miss her?***



I pause, breathing raggedly. I take out a small bottle with a small cream-colored pill labelled “10” and chew through one. I’ll have to bring this up to the therapist. The panic subsides. It’s never been voices before.

The cave is slick and deep, an oceanic mildewy musk hanging in the air, while soft light rippled from the small pools of standing water. There’s no light in the cave, yet it seems as if moonlight emanates from the very walls themselves. I make sure to grab a softlight stone or two to better observe at home. Macabee is nowhere to be found. A faraway voice worms its way into my head, the same whining hollow noise as every time. It’s not talking to me, but proximal enough to be heard, which isn’t unusual for an hallucination.



***What are you willing to give for the perfect life?***



“You know I’d- I’d give anything… I’ve given so much… taken so much. What else is there? What else can you want from me?” Macabee’s distinct nasally tone rings forth. Is he talking to the voice in my head?



***Drink, and it will be yours.***



The other voice sounds as if several people are whispering all at once, right into your amygdala, probing and pooling every ounce of cortisol and adrenaline you have until your thoughts drown in the anxiety it conjures. There’s no echo, so I know it’s mine. A problem for later. I round a corner, seeing Macabee kneeling before one of the moonlit puddles. He’s  greedily drinking from his own cupped hands, shaking tremendously as he was. My time in the shadows is up.



“Macabee?” He’s unmoving, so I approach slowly, hand on my firearm, just in case. “That water can’t be safe to drink, would you mind explaining what you’re doing?”

“Did Elijah send you?” He doesn’t seem to be breathing as he talks, almost like a ventriloquist, only if he’s the puppet.

“He’s worried about you is all,” I take stock of the scene before me. Whatever he’s going through is familiar enough. “I’m a nice enough guy,” I slowly put my hand on his shoulder, “and I think it would do you some good to not drink dirty-ass cave water. Wanna talk outside?”

A small movement in the water catches my attention: in the shadow created by his still-cupped hands, a tadpole-sized inky black thing rushes to the obscurity of deeper water. Probably just a fish but it rattles me enough to quiet my breathing, something in me prickling. I instinctively draw a bead on the dark thing, preparing to see if it’s bulletproof.

*Fuck.*

My head pounds, I gasp, there’s a stinging light, and the scene is different. 

I’m on the beach, near a featureless cliff face, my gun drawn on Macabee., There’s aa shocked couple threatening to call the police. I quickly holster and grab Macabee.

“What the fuck was that?” I angrily whisper, so as to not further alarm the startled beachgoers. I may be crazy, but I know smug when I see it. This bastard reeks of it.

He paused for a moment, looked back at the cliff face and then at me, drawing a slow breath. Taunting.

“Do you frequently go into someone else’s home waving guns around? Unwelcome guests are removed from the premises.” There’s a small flicker behind his left pupil, the same slick reflection from that thing in the cave.

“I… I haven’t taken my meds today. I’m sorry. I won’t cause you any more trouble.” 

I had just taken my meds. 

I am going to cause him much more trouble.



September 3rd, 2021

I haven’t noticed a single thing amiss from Macabee, and neither has his husband. He says he’s been present and loving and that it was all likely some serious misunderstanding. I agree, but suggest we give it through the weekend just to be safe. If there’s nothing there’s nothing. It’s 10:00 AM today and I haven’t received a single text. While generally not odd, it’s odd enough from Elijah however that I believe it warrants a quick check up.

It’s in my service contract that I have universal access to all property of the client during the duration of the investigation, specifically for situations like this. As I approach the house it’s quiet. I smell it again, that ocean musk, the stink of tidal water and marine detritus.

The Macabee’s live 30 miles from the sea, I shouldn’t smell anything but pumpkin spice and freshly baked bread. Nothing looks askew as I get closer, just the increasing smell. The door is unlocked, but it’s a safe enough town. I step into the entryway and the actual air is heavy. It’s like walking through syrup. Most likely an hallucination, but to be sure I drop a dollar from shoulder level. It takes about 15 seconds to hit the ground. Huh.

I wade my way into the only seemingly currently habited area of the house, the master bedroom. As I do I notice small puddles of water, increasing in size as the door draws near. A sharp stinging sensation pulses through my left thigh, almost like frost burn, I grunt as I look down and see there's a layer of ice over my pocket. I fish out the two softly glowing stones, now two harsh icy blues. I put them into the cargo pocket in my right leg, which is insulated from my skin, and push forward.

The door doesn’t creak as I entered, allowing me my shroud for a moment longer. Macabee is leaning over Elijah, who’s flat on his back, unconscious or dead. I can hear him slurping like I did in the cave-not-cave. He’s racking hard this time, near seizing. There are sharp ripping noises. I draw my firearm and circle slowly in approach, as to bring Elijah fully into view. What’s left of him, anyway.

His body is waterlogged, and he’s *leaking* everywhere. Macabee freezes, save for shallow breaths. The ripping sound persists. Macabee’s hands are free of blood, so he isn’t ripping into his now-departed husband, as initially suspected.

Elijah's stomach coils, then tears free from its skin-based containment. There’s a writhing mass of what looks like bloody eels slowly escaping from his abdomen. I can’t determine if they actually exist, so I look away. A problem for another moment, perhaps.

I put a hand on Macabee’s shoulder, fully intending to shoot him if need be.

“She can’t bring her back. Don’t listen to her.” He murmurs, eyes milky white.

“Who can’t bring who back?” I speak sternly, sharply. I know he means my mom.

“She’s going to come back soon, she’s been asleep for so long.” He’s in a trance now, unreachable.

I say nothing, thinking only of how I’m going to explain this to the police and my therapist.



***Come now, boy. I can help. Come rest, you’ve earned it.***



That’s my mother’s voice. *Fuck fuck fuck fuck*– I shakily grab at the little ‘10’ pills, made harder by the mist slicking my hands. I hear Macabee begin shuffling, as my own vision blurs. I don’t care. I slowly stop fishing for a pill. I don’t care. *She can bring my mom back.* I would do anything for that. I *will* do anything for–



*Bang.*



My ears are  ringing, more than usual. My mind is clear. It smells of lead and carbon. There is no pain, no sting. I wonder where I’ve been shot.

The mist slowly dissipates, revealing the scene before me. Macabee is laying atop Elijah, holding his face with one hand, and my firearm with the other. There’s a small exit wound visible in the back of his head, and a dark trickle coming from it. Darker than blood should be. His eyes are open, unclouded now. His mouth is also agape, and a small squelching can be heard escaping from his maw.

It was then that I saw it, the thing from the cave-not-cave. It wormed its way from Macabee’s throat, movement a mix of a caterpillar and a slug. I’m already reaching into my jacket for a small evidence bag to put it in when Macabee jolts. He clamps his jaw down hard, eyes far-away and wild.

“Fuck you!” he murmurs through clenched teeth as the thing lets out a high pitched squeal. After a moment it falls from his mouth, bisected and still. I scoop it delicately with a gloved hand into a little vial on my person, unsure the local police will be as thorough as me.



Nothing to do but dial 9-1-1 and wait, I suppose.



*...shit. I’m not going to get paid for this am I?*




September 7th, 2021

The cops ultimately ruled the case a murder-suicide. Said Macabee must’ve drowned Elijah and then shot himself. Half right. I heard someone suggest the eels were some kind of rapidly growing parasitic variety Elijah must’ve contracted sometime weeks prior. I don’t buy it, but I have my own piece of the puzzle to deal with. I sent that specimen to a Marine research facility on a small island off the coast, one that deals with all types of parasites and marine ecosystems blah blah. The researcher I sent it to said he found something big one night, and to call him in the morning after he finalized his findings. That was a week ago, and my gut is telling me to check on him.
