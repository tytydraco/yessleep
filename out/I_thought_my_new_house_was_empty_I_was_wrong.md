It started with the wine glasses. Two in the kitchen sink - the one I had used the night before, and the one nestled next to it, pink lipstick staining the rim. 

Nothing weird there, right? Except I only wear lipstick at weddings and parties, and I hadn't had anyone over last night. I didn't have anyone to invite. All of my friends were a hundred miles away in the city, and in the three days I'd spent in my new home, the sole acquaintance I'd made was my elderly neighbour, Mrs Norbert. 

Still, those friends had thrown me a party before I departed for greener pastures. In all the rush of packing, perhaps I'd forgotten to wash one of the glasses, and packed it away still smudged with lipstick. 

I rinsed it under the tap, any uneasiness dissipating as I set the newly gleaming glass in the draining rack. No time to ponder pointless mysteries - not with my to-do list. 

My new cottage had been a steal, but it wasn't exactly pristine. The heating barely worked, every square inch of carpet and wallpaper looked like it had been vomited up by Queen Victoria, and the door to the guest room was jammed shut so tight even my best attempt at a shoulder barge wouldn’t budge it. It'd take me years of saving and work to get it up to scratch, but for now, I'd taken a few weeks off work to tackle the jobs that wouldn't require an expensive contractor. 

At the top of my to-do list was: 

1. Strip the peeling wallpaper in the dining room. 

2. Pull up the carpet in the corridor. 

3. Remove the damp patch in the kitchen. 

As the swirling fuchsia carpet was frankly an assault on my eyes, I decided to start there. I sweated over it all morning, hacking up sections of the carpet and yanking out staples. If you had told me that God himself had welded it to the floor, I wouldn't have batted an eye.  

When the post slithered through the letterbox, it was a welcome reprieve. I shuffled to the door, knees shrieking in protest after the morning's abuse, and leafed through the post.

Junk. Junk. Bill - the first one at my new address, what joy. 

At the bottom of the stack was a letter addressed to Angela Spencer - my new home's former owner, I presumed. I'd already received a couple of letters for her, but having no forwarding address, I'd tossed them to one side with the vague intention of dealing with them later. 

Today, it occurred to me that Mrs Norbert might know where to send  them. It further occurred to me that tea, cake, and gossip about my new neighbours - which she had treated me to during our first meeting - was a far more appealing prospect than resuming my attack on the carpet. 

After tracking down the other letters, I grabbed my keys and headed out. Pickle - Mrs Norbert's hefty ginger cat - sprawled on the fence that separated our two gardens. He gave a lazy meow at my approach. "Is your mum in?" I asked as he nuzzled my fingers. 

"Just getting back!" I glanced up to see Mrs Norbert, swathed in scarves and a coat several sizes too large for her, bustling up the garden path.

Pickle leapt off the fence and raced to her front door, meowing the whole way. 

"He'll be after his lunch, the greedy guts." Mrs Norbert shook her head. "I've grown fond of him, but I must say, he's not a patch on my old Mewsli."

Judging by the photos of Mewsli plastering her living room walls, I doubted Pickle would ever take the place of his predecessor in Mrs Norbert's heart. 

 "You can wait a minute." She fixed the cat with a stern glare before turning back to me, her frown melting into a smile. "How you getting on, love?"

"Oh, you know - slowly but surely."

"That's the way." She bent her head close to mine, whispering conspiratorially, "I just bumped into Joan at the bus stop. You know Joan with the gammy leg?" We both knew I had no idea who she was talking about, but I nodded obligingly. "Well, her Colin - her boy, that is - his wife has only gone and left him. Had it away with the chap who collects trollies at the supermarket! But that's nothing compared to what she told me about Marie's Samantha, the little..."

I'll confess to phasing out here while I pondered how to move the conversation indoors. Mrs Norbert might have the benefit of several layers, but I didn't. In the freezing February air, dying of hypothermia before she stopped to draw breath was a very real possibility. 

"I'm so sorry to interrupt," I butted in without a shred of regret. "You really must tell me the whole story, but I need to ask for your help with something before I forget. Perhaps we can talk about it over a cup of tea?"

"That sounds lovely, dear. Come over, I'll put the kettle on."

She was fishing her keys out of her pocket by the time I made it up her path. "Thanks for this, Mrs Norbert. I don't know about you, but I'm spitting feathers."

"Any time at all - just come over and knock my door." She located her key, and fumbled it into the lock with her thickly gloved fingers. "Anyway, what can I help you with?"

"I'm hoping you can tell me where to find Angela Spencer."

Mrs Norbert froze. "Angela? What do you want with her?" 

"I keep getting post for her, but I've no idea where to send it."

She seemed oblivious to Pickle twining himself around her legs, crying to be let in. "I'm afraid I can't help you there. She left without so much as a by your leave."

"Does she have any friends in the village who might know?"

"She kept herself to herself," she said abruptly, her smile flickering. She turned the key to lock the door again. "I'm sorry, love, I've just remembered I'm out of milk. I'll have to go out and get some. Perhaps we can have our tea tomorrow."

"I've got some, I could -"

"No, no," said Mrs Norbert with strained cheer, brushing past me and hurrying back down the path. "I wouldn't want to put you out. Bye for now!" 

With a final harried look over her shoulder, she bustled down the street, leaving me standing on her porch with the letters dangling from my hand. Behind me, Pickles yowled his outrage.

"Well," I mumbled, "I suppose I'll make my own tea."

I did just that before tackling the carpet again. As I worked, something niggled at me. My conversation with Mrs Norbert had been strange, certainly, but then she was a slightly peculiar person. It continued to nag at me when I gave up work in the evening and took a hot shower for my aching muscles. It demanded my attention when I tried to relax in front of the television. 

But it was only after I'd gotten into bed, and was on the brink of sleep, that it came to me. Mrs Norbert seemed to possess an encyclopedic knowledge of the sex lives and financial woes of the entire village. Yet she knew nothing about her former neighbour. Not only that, but the mere mention of Angela was enough to send her sprinting away. 

Odd. Not quite so odd as to keep me awake after a day of hard graft. I slipped into sleep, into strange dreams of pricking my fingers and squeezing the blood into a cup. Prick. Squeeze. Drip. Prick. Squeeze. Drip. 

My fingertips ached fiercely when I woke up, but there were no signs I'd started using them as pincushions in my sleep. More likely, they were protesting a long day's abuse wrestling staples out of floorboards. 

I didn't have much time to think about it, because that day started with the boots. 

After fumbling some clothes on (with very little help from uncooperative fingers) and making a cup of tea, I went to review yesterday's work. My past self had obligingly bundled the lengths of carpet into rolls and secured them with string, leaving them stacked haphazardly by the door for a trip to the local tip. A quick survey told me they wouldn't be enough to fill the car, so I went in search of broken down boxes and bubble wrap - the detritus born of the little unpacking I'd managed to accomplish. 

I found them next to a half empty box of books. A pair of boots, lined neatly one next to the other, as though someone had left them there ready to slip on again. Dried mud clinging to their soles. Two sizes larger than what I wore. 

Imagining that a guest had worn them to my farewell party, gone home barefoot, and then I'd somehow managed to pack them, strained credulity. 

That left Angela Spencer. She must have left them behind when she moved. 

*But -* 

No, no. That was the only plausible explanation. When I went to the tip, I'd stop by the post office - see if they could help me with a forwarding address. If they could, I'd send Angela's boots to her along with her letters. 

*But, you -* 

No time to stand around staring at dirty old boots. Too much to be done. Gathering up an armful of the bundled carpet, I headed out to my car. When I was halfway down the path, I heard a tapping. The sound cracked like a gunshot through the still morning. I jumped, dropping the carpet onto the muddy grass. 

Whirling around, I saw Mrs Norbert standing at her kitchen window. She held up three cups, jiggling them with an inquisitive look. I grinned ruefully and gestured to the carpet, mouthing, Next time. 

As I gathered up my now dirty load, I wondered whether Mrs Norbert was the sort of woman to give her cat milk from a human cup, or if she'd managed to draw in Joan from the bus stop for some fresh gossip. 

I went to the tip first, hurling the carpet that had caused me so much trouble to its doom with no small amount of satisfaction. That left the post office - and the drive there, with nothing to occupy my mind but the thought I'd been trying to ignore all morning. 

*There weren't any -* 

I'd be glad to return Angela's boots to her. It was awkward having the old owner's stuff hanging around the house. 

*But there weren't any -* 

Bit like having dinner with your partner and their ex, really. 

*THERE WEREN'T ANY CLOTHES LEFT IN THE HOUSE. A few bits of furniture, yes. But no holey socks, no bras with the underwire poking out, and certainly not a dirty great pair of boots shedding their muck onto the carpet. You saw that for yourself when you came to view it.* 

"Then I must have missed something," I said out loud. "What's the alternative?"

The niggling voice fell silent, though I suspected it wouldn't remain so for long. 

"Thank you," I grumbled. 

I found the post office empty, and as a consequence, the postmaster - a portly man well into middle age - only too pleased to talk. 

"Angela Spencer?" he answered my initial enquiry. "What do you want with her?"

There appeared to be an echo in the village. 

He spared me the trouble of answering. "Ahhh, of course. You must be the one who bought her place on Lark Lane."

"That'd be me. I keep getting letters for her, and she left a few personal items behind. I wonder if she left a forwarding address?"

He chuckled tightly. "I'm not sure they let you send packages to the loony bin."

"Excuse me?" 

He took off his glasses, wiped them on the front of his jumper. "Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh. 

It's not fair to poor old Angie after what happened to her."

We stared at each other in silence for a beat. When he made no sign of continuing, I prompted, "What - ?"

That was all the permission he required. 

"Well, it's not my place to gossip, but she went a bit funny." He tapped his index finger against his temple. "She got that - that - what's it called when you're scared of going outside?"

"Agoraphobia?" I offered. 

"That's the one. After what happened with her daughter, then her husband leaving, she stopped leaving the house. They had to drag her out in the end. Last time we saw her, they were putting her in the back of an ambulance."

"What happened to - ? "

He held up a hand, forestalling me. "As I said, it's not my place to gossip." He pronounced it with all the piousness of the local vicar, then slid me a sidelong look. "Are you on the Facebook?"

I nodded. 

"We've set up a little group for the village. You should join. It's private, but Kerry over at The Red Lion runs it. She'll let you in. I'll vouch for you. "

"That's very kind of you."

"No problem at all."  A gracious nod. "I'm afraid I can't much help with any bits and bobs she's left lying around the house, but if you bring her post in, I'll send it on to the returns centre."

I thanked him for his help and made my exit. When I was halfway through the door, he called after me, "Don't forget about the Facebook!" and dropped me a wink that a pantomime villain would have thought overblown. 

Back at home, I tracked down the group and - after answering a dozen questions relating to their rules and general village trivia - requested membership. Ten minutes passed. Twenty. I flicked through my feed while I waited. Tim had tagged me in photos from the party. One showed the two of us downing tequila shots. In another, I belted into a karaoke mic with Mel, his wife. A third photo showed me with my arm around the waist of a startlingly tall woman I had no recollection of meeting. 

God, how much had I had to drink? Maybe I had been hungover enough the following day to kidnap someone's shoes and take them to the countryside. 

Ah, the boots. 

We had to come back to them sooner or later. 

Indeed. And now that my mind had returned there, it refused to go anywhere else. Chucking them in the bin felt wrong. Disrespectful, somehow. Nor could I leave them in plain view. They squatted in the corner, an unwelcome guest that wouldn't take the hint to leave no matter how many times I slapped my knees and said, "Well."

In the end, I shoved them in a small box and taped it up. That felt better - more like they were in temporary rather than permanent residence. 

When I went to place them in the kitchen, next to the letters I had flung on the counter the day before, I spotted the damp patch and sagged with relief. There was something I could focus on.

I'd never treated damp before, and hadn't the faintest idea where to start. I could snap some photos, find a specialist, get some advice. 

As I pulled my phone out, I noticed the abandoned cup of tea on the side. It'd be stone cold by now, but I'd left in such a rush that morning that I hadn't had anything at all to droop. I scooped up the cup in one hand - just a gulp to wet my throat, I promised, then I'll make a fresh one - and angled my phone at the damp patch. 

I clicked a picture. Took a gulp of tea. 

And then I found myself sitting on the sofa. 

The cup was still clutched in my left hand. The phone in my right. Its screen informed me that it was 4.37pm. When I returned from the post office, it hadn't quite been midday. 

My hand flexed automatically, flinging the cup away. It smashed against the coffee table, showering ceramic shards and cold tea onto the carpet. 

Still operating on auto pilot, I jerked up off the sofa and allowed my legs to carry me to the kitchen. I retrieved a plastic bag for the sharp fragments; a wet sponge for the spill.  

Hardly surprising, I thought as I mopped up the mess. I've been burning the candle at both ends. Working all hours before the move so I could take time off, and then I haven't stopped since I got here. 

*You haven't seemed tired.* 

Well, that's how burnout works, isn't it? You don't know it's coming until it floors you. 

*So you blacked out for over four hours, with no sort of warning beforehand, because... you're tired?* 

What else could it be?

That voice - that nagging voice, which might have belonged to a bossy older sister, if I had one - gave me reprieve until I finished cleaning. When I returned to the kitchen to dump the sodden mess of tissues in the bin, it whispered to me again. 

*You were fine until you drank that tea.* 

"Right." I yanked open the fridge, grabbed a bottle of wine, and poured a healthy serving into the wine glass which, yesterday, had borne a smudge of pink lipstick. "And that had a perfectly reasonable explanation too, thank you very much," I grumbled. 

I drained half the glass in one long gulp, and felt some of the tension leave my shoulders. Refilled it. Drank again. 

This time, the voice was quieter - further away. 

*You can't shut me up forever.* 

For now will do. 

No strange, finger-pricking dreams for me that night. Not after what turned into two bottles of wine and no food. Instead, I dreamed of driving into the city - not mine, but one similar enough that it didn't matter. I found a club. A man whose lips I liked the shape of. After I sampled them, I took him to my car and drove us home. The dream dissipated as I unlocked the front door, his warm hand on my waist. 

I woke up to a pounding headache, and a notification on my phone. The postmaster had  been true to his word - I was in the group. 

After overcoming a wave of nausea - a horrifying mixture of hangover and memory - I settled on the sofa for a scroll. 

Pub quizzes. School plays. Complaints about litter on the green, and longstanding feuds over parking spaces. At last, I found it: Angela's exit from the village. 

It was a shaky video filmed on someone's phone. Angela was a tall woman, and while she might once have been slender, she was now rake thin. The way her shirt hung off her, and the bagginess in the seat of her trousers, gave the impression of someone who had lost weight very quickly. Her black hair, snarled into a tangled mess of knots, said that she had long since ceased taking care of herself. 

I was unreasonably relieved to see that she wasn't wearing the boots currently lurking in my kitchen. She wore pink slippers. One of them flew off and landed in Mrs Norbert's garden as she kicked and thrashed, straining against the two paramedics who were doing their utmost to wrestle her towards the ambulance waiting at the kerb. 

She managed to work an arm free, landing a ringing slap across one of the paramedics’ faces before they restrained her again. The sparse crowd strung out along the pavement gasped and murmured, but were quickly drowned out by the shriek that tore from Angela's throat. 

The video ended as the paramedics finally forced her into the ambulance. I watched it three times, then scrolled through the comments. 

*Why is this even allowed on here? It's disrespectful.*  

*good riddance shes always bin a nitemare* 

*No wonder Jason left* 

*Wtf is wrong with u? She lost her daughter, show some compassion ffs.*

I scrolled through a year's worth of posts before I found Angela again. Photos of her on the village green. Her hair was drawn into a careless bun, but it had clearly seen a brush recently, and her clothes still fit her. But she was pale, her eyes swollen. The man clutching her hand wore the same expression of agony - the kind so deep it makes you want to stay away lest it find its way to you. 

To their credit, the Spencers' neighbours hadn't stayed away. They crowded in around them, clutching candles, their faces sombre. Their downcast eyes said they were sorry, even though they could never, ever understand. 

The post was titled, *'In memory of Gracie xxx'.*

I scrolled back further in search of Gracie. There must be something. A plea to help search for a missing child. Heartfelt requests for donations to get her to Disneyland before the illness took her. A photo of dented railings accompanied by a protest to lower the speed limit on the main road. 

I found her in a photo Angela posted. Gracie smiled gap-toothed at the camera, a halo of silver tinsel circling her head.  *My little one's first nativity*, Angela had written. *So proud.* 

Frowning, I scrolled back up, certain I had missed something. But, no. There was Gracie in her first school play, and then she was gone. 

I tossed my phone to one side and sank back into the sofa, blinking up at the ceiling. "Poor fucking woman," I murmured. Then, louder, I addressed the voice that had been nagging me for the last day. 

"So, you're telling me that this devastated woman - this grieving mother - managed to escape from wherever they took her and come back here. She helped herself to my wine, stomped around the house in her boots for a bit, and roofied my tea. And she did it all without me noticing - even though she doesn't look capable of so much as feeding herself. Is that what you've been trying to suggest?"

Silence from the bossy, nagging, older sister voice. 

"Good," I said firmly. "You should be ashamed of yourself."

I was indeed. 

Despite the hangover, despite the pain that still hummed in my fingers, I forced myself up off the sofa. A fresh set of clothes, and a fleeting look at the newly installed medicine cabinet in the bathroom before I discarded the idea - no painkillers, not when most of my discomfort was self-inflicted. Instead, I went to the dining room and began stripping the peeling wallpaper. 

I worked all that day. And the next. And the one after that. 

On and on, one day melting into the next, pausing only for an occasional bite of food, or to hop into the shower. I sweated through unseasonal heat, then shivered as spring seemed to realise it had arrived before its appointed time, and a chill crept back into the air. 

I saw Mrs Norbert now and again, as I carted rubbish to my car or yanked up weeds in the garden. She always gave me a quick wave, put her head down, and hurried on. I couldn't blame her, not after I'd so abruptly reminded her of Angela. The poor woman must have witnessed her neighbour's devastation and decline first hand. Who'd want to remember that? 

Occasionally, the bossy big sister voice would try to creep back in again. 

*I know you don't want to think about it…*

"You're right," I'd say, reaching into the fridge for the bottle of wine I always kept on hand to guard against her return. "I don't." 

After pouring a glass, I'd scroll through the Facebook group. I'd found more glimpses of Angela and her Gracie, in group photos of village fetes and festivals. Looking at them reminded me that Angela was not someone to be feared - only pitied. 

It would also spur me on to make the next day's to-do list. My work on the house had become part penance, part desperate attempt to sweep away the tragic memories of its former owner. 

Most nights, I fell into a deep, black sleep. Sometimes, I'd have the city dream. The details were different, but it was essentially the same every time: I'd make a new friend - man or woman - and try to bring them back home, but I'd always wake up before I could bring them inside. I supposed my subconscious was screaming at me to make some friends in the village. But there was no time - not when there was still so much work to be done. 

After two weeks of this routine, what happened next was hardly surprising. 

I got ill. 

Sweating, bone-aching, vomiting up water ill. 

I spent two days in bed, wracked with shivers even as sweat soaked my pyjamas. When I was forced up - to visit the bathroom or attempt to sip some water - I had to lean against the walls, the room swaying and lurching around me. 

On the second night of my illness, somewhere in the small hours, I woke up sprawled on the corridor floor. I had no memory of leaving the bed, yet there I lay - one shoe on, the other lying nearby, car keys clutched in my hand. 

And the voice, which I'd stifled successfully for so many days, returned in full force. 

*Get up. Please.* 

Despite the plea, it wasn't a request - it was a command. 

*Go to the back door.* 

I twitched feebly. My muscles felt like old rubber. If I tried to stand up, I was certain my legs would buckle beneath me. Why not ask me to walk to the other side of the world? It was just as likely. 

*It's time to be brave now. I know you can do that. Crawl if you have to.* 

Groaning, I dragged myself up onto my elbows. I froze in place, closing my eyes as a wave of nausea rolled over me. 

*Never mind the mess. Just get moving.* 

I did have to pause to heave as I hauled my weight onto my knees, but I'd consumed so little over the past two days that only bile came out, burning my throat on its way up. Somehow, I got into position, and began to crawl. 

Each inch felt like a mile, as the cold air sent a chill deep into my bones, and my vision greyed at the edges. Whenever I thought I'd reached my limit, and decided to rest for just a moment, the voice would return. 

*Move. Now.* 

I have no idea how long it took me, but at last, I reached the back door. At the voice's command, I turned the key and pushed it open. 

*Throw the car keys out.* 

I looked down, startled to see I was still clutching them. The metal had bitten into my hand during my painstaking journey, leaving jagged bloody marks in my palm. 

Summoning the last of my strength, I threw them into the garden. They glinted briefly in the moonlight as they soared through the air, then disappeared into the darkness. 

The voice was fainter now, but no less urgent. 

*Now lock the door. Throw the keys out of the window.* 

Clawing my way up the wall to reach the window sapped the very last of my energy. I collapsed the moment the house keys flew from my fingers. 

*Good job, little Bean.* 

I passed out on the floor, curled up next to the door. 

Sunlight spilled through the window by the time I woke. My muscles screamed their protest at a night spent on the hard ground, but my fever had broken. Deep in my stomach, I even felt the faintest stirring of what might have been hunger. 

Legs still weak, I leaned against the cold wall as I showered off the night's sweat. Dried off and in fresh pyjamas, I made a bowl of soup and took a cautious sip. When the first spoonful made no signs of reappearing, I devoured the whole bowl then made a second. 

Shuffling out of the kitchen, I spotted the dried patch of bile in the corridor. I wrinkled my nose. That could wait until tomorrow. I dug out the spare key to the back door and retrieved the two sets of keys I'd flung into the garden hours before - that was the most activity I could manage before retreating to bed. 

Propped up against the pillows, scrolling through my phone, I tried to ignore the feeling lurking in - no, not in me. Around me. 

I was relieved to be on the mend, for certain. Nothing ever tastes so good as your first bite of food after two days of throwing up. And there was no denying I was unsettled by last night. If I'd gotten in my car in my fever-hazed state, I could have killed myself. 

But it seemed to me there was something in the air itself - restlessness. A sense of Things To Be Done. It urged me to get out of bed, find a hammer *(knife?)* or a paintbrush and get to work. I got so far as throwing my legs over the side of the bed and sliding my feet into slippers  before I realised what I was doing and forced myself back down. 

My chest ached with sudden loneliness. If only I were still in the city, I could just pop in to see Tim and Mel. They’d make me a cup of tea, hear me out, and tell me how daft I was being. I couldn’t stomach the thought of calling them. Angela, working myself until I dropped, my fever-fuelled midnight flight – where was I meant to start?  

Maybe - maybe a couple of days away wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. It was Friday. I could spend the weekend with my friends, let them talk some sense into me, and return refreshed on Monday morning. 

I grabbed my phone and scrolled through my contacts. When I hit the L section, I hesitated, my sudden resolve weakening. I shook off the fog that was creeping over my thoughts, and pressed on until I found Tim’s number.  

Before I could second guess it, I dashed off a quick message - *Up for a house guest this weekend?* \- and tossed my phone aside. 

The weight lifted off my chest. With the decision made, my breath came easier. I debated rolling out of bed to pack a bag, but that could wait until tomorrow morning. My energy levels were still low - I'd done quite enough for one day. So, although it was barely afternoon, I rolled myself in the blanket and promptly fell asleep. 

Searing pain yanked me back into consciousness. Fine lines of fire burned up my arms - or so it seemed, for all around me was black. A slithering, pulsating blackness that rooted me in place even as it seemed my skin was being torn from my muscles. 

I gulped in air to scream, but only produced a strangled grunt. It was enough.  The blackness receded, and I saw that I was standing in the kitchen. And in my arms - howling, scratching and biting as though his life depended on it - was Pickle. 

I tried to drop him. My arms only tightened around him. Thrashing his head, he caught my thumb between his teeth and bit down. Tears squeezed from my eyes as he tore away a chunk of flesh. I groaned again - in pain, in horror - but, still, I couldn't - 

*LET GO.*

My arms dropped mechanically, spilling the cat onto the floor. He scrabbled to his paws and raced from the room, claws clattering against the floorboards. 

I sagged against the counter, sobbing over my savaged arms. A muffled roar demanded attention in the back of my mind, but it was eclipsed by the pain. My skin was a patchwork of scratches and bites, all oozing blood. Worst of all was my thumb, which felt as though it had been doused in fuel and set alight. 

Staggering to the bathroom, I fumbled the medicine cabinet open. I reached for the pack of painkillers inside and froze. 

On the bottom shelf was a hairbrush. Pink. Small. Something you might slip into your handbag when you were going on a trip. 

And it was threaded with dark hair. 

I grabbed a handful of my own blonde hair, as though expecting it to have changed colour overnight. 

The boots. The wineglass. I could explain those away. But I'd put up this medicine cabinet myself on my first day in the house.

So, how could a hairbrush with strands of Angela's dark hair have found its way inside? 

I slammed the cabinet door shut so hard the mirror fractured. The pain was still there, but the roaring in my ears drowned it out. I backed out of the bathroom, treading softly as a burglar. 

Moving as quickly as I dared, I grabbed the essentials. Phone. Handbag. Keys. I held my breath as I opened the front door, certain a stone-hard hand would fall on my shoulder, pulling me back. But no one stopped me. No one sprang out as I sprinted down the garden path, or jumped in front of my car as I drove out of Lark Lane. 

I made it to the motorway before it hit me. 

The brush was proof - indisputable proof - that someone had been in the house. Maybe it was Angela, desperate to return to the home she'd shared with her little girl. Maybe it wasn't. But someone had been creeping into my home, slipping things into my drinks. The blackout, the fever, the awful thing with Pickle - it had all come after I'd drunk the unguarded cup of tea. 

I held it together until I got to the nearest motorway services. As soon as I'd parked, I sagged over the steering wheel, and for the second time that night, I sobbed. The horror of it pressed down my throat, choking me. 

How many times had the intruder watched me from the shadows? Had they stood over me while I slept? What else had they made me do? 

I kicked the door open just in time to direct a spray of vomit onto the tarmac. 

As I was wiping my mouth on my sleeve, a passing man paused and shot me a concerned look. "Rough night, love?"

A giggle burbled out of my lips. It turned into a laugh, and soon I could barely breathe for laughing. "You could say that," I forced out in between snatched breaths. 

He gave me a strained smile - the type you might shoot at a dog you're not sure might bite you - and beat a hasty retreat indoors. 

The giggles vanished as quickly as they came. I was numb. Inside, anyway - now the frenzy of emotion had passed, the pain in my arms came roaring back into focus. 

I shuffled into the building barefoot, still wearing my pyjamas, arms ripped to ribbons. Thankfully, at this time of night, there were few people milling around. The couple of strangers I did pass between the entrance and toilets shot me alarmed looks, but said nothing. Thank God for British reserve. 

I washed my arms as best I could under the taps, yelping as the first spray of hot water hit my skin and set the pain screaming anew. When I had taken all I could, I used handfuls of toilet paper to dab them dry. 

It was only when I went to throw the sodden, bloody mess of tissues in the bin that I caught sight of myself in the mirror. 

I didn't recognise the stranger staring back at me. Her cheeks were gaunt, her eyes hollow and flat. Her hair was a mess of knots. Her shirt hung off her shoulders, as if she'd lost a lot of weight very quickly. 

If she were a little taller, if she had dark hair, she could have been Angela. 

I turned away, the lingering taste of vomit in the back of my throat suddenly overwhelming. 

Painkillers, I told myself. Food. Start getting that reflection to look familiar again. 

In one shop, I found painkillers and a box of plasters. I swallowed the tablets dry and stuck the plasters over the worst of my wounds. It felt like using a cork to plug a bursting dam, but what else could I do? 

A heavenly scent of grease took me to the food court, where I ordered a burger the size of my hand and a portion of chips. I ate half the burger before I stopped to draw breath, and also to consider that I should warn Tim I'd be arriving at an ungodly hour. 

When I unlocked my phone, I saw he'd replied to my earlier message. 

*Hey stranger! We'd love to have you. Is Lizzie coming too?* 

That one word was all it took. One word to lift the thick fog I hadn't even realised I had been living in. 

Lizzie. My big sister who had taken a week off work to help me move into my new house. Lizzie who'd gossiped over tea that first day with me and Mrs Norbert. Lizzie, who had shared a glass of wine with me, gone to bed, and vanished. 

Lizzie who I'd forgotten, as if she were no more than a stranger. 

I flipped through my phone, frantically looking for - I didn't know what. Something. Anything to explain Lizzie's sudden absence in my life and memory. 

There was her last message to me, sent on the morning of the move. 

*Rise and shine little Bug! I'll be at yours in 10.*

There was the last post she was tagged in - at my farewell party, my arm around her waist, both of us grinning at the camera. 

I raced through my photos, looking for any evidence of her in my house. No trace of her. But what I did find made me freeze. I could only sit, clutching my phone, each individual beat of my heart loud in my ears. 

Thump. 

Thump. 

Thump. 

The photo of the damp patch. The one I'd taken with the idea of getting advice on how to treat it. I'd never gotten around to it. It kept getting pushed to the bottom of my to-do list. It was only a small patch, really; it could wait. 

The patch in the photo wasn't small. It consumed the entire wall, black tendrils creeping up to the ceiling. Even though the image was still, it felt like it was moving - not just moving, *writhing*. Inching closer, as if one of those tendrils might reach through the screen and wrap itself around my wrist. 

At the very centre, where the blackness was so complete it made you think light was only a dream, the patch bulged. A single shape protruded: the unmistakable outline of a hand. 

*Lizzie?* 

The photo was there for a second, then gone. Vanished from my gallery. No sign of it in my deleted files. 

Echoes of dreams flickered through my mind. Standing in the kitchen, pricking my fingers, and squeezing out the blood. Driving through the night to lure people from clubs and bars to my home. And Pickle - poor Pickle - 

Poor Pickle had not been a dream at all. The evidence of that was seared into my skin. All those people - had they been as real as the cat so terrified he had ripped a chunk out of my thumb? 

I don't know. Or really, I don't want to know. 

What I do know is this: I have forgotten more than I remember. 

I arrived at the cottage in February. By my reckoning, I spent a few weeks there. But, according to my phone, it's October. 

Maybe I remembered everything when I fled tonight. Maybe I'd forgotten a few days by the time I reached my car. Weeks by the time I washed my arms in the sink. Months as I ate my burger. 

Soon, I'll get into my car and start driving. By the time I reach Tim and Mel's, I suspect I won't remember any of this at all. The cottage will be a failed project. In years to come, I'll roll my eyes and tell people about the time I bit off more than I could chew, and came home with my tail between my legs.

People will ask about Lizzie. Every time I hear her name, it'll tear the scab off the wound. I'll be as baffled as anyone else by her sudden disappearance, but no one will question it too closely. Just like no one asked too many questions about Gracie. 

I won't want to return to the cottage. Why would I? It would only be a reminder of my failure - and Lizzie's absence. At some point, I'll decide to cut my losses and sell it.

So, you might one day find yourself driving through a quiet village and see a charming cottage up for sale. The neighbour seems friendly enough - as long as you don't ask her about the previous residents, that is. 

It needs work, to be sure. There's no carpet in the hallway, the electrical system is a little iffy, and there's a small damp patch in the kitchen. Nothing that can't be fixed. 

If you find yourself falling a little in love with it, think twice before you buy. 

I won’t remember to warn you again.
