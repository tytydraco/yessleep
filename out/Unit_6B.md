There is a man who lives in the unit above me, his name is Luke. And for the last month, I keep on hearing strange noises coming from upstairs. 

At first, I tried to excuse it: maybe he had a friend or a girlfriend over at his apartment, or he was moving furniture, practically anything that would explain the noises I heard from his unit. 

I’ve tried going up to him personally to ask what was wrong. But I never got an answer from him. 
Luke was a good man--good as in terms of staying inside his apartment and never causing trouble. 

I’m pretty positive he was just a gas station cashier, which would explain why he was living in the dumps of this apartment complex. 

It’s the kind of place no one ever really notices, a place where people who were hermits could hide out in the complex that smells like cat-piss and depression. 

But it was perfect. Perfect for me at least. 

The times I would see Luke, he was either checking his mail or coming back from his job in his old uniform.

He was quiet and looked like a mutated snail, but he never gave off the vibe that he was someone to look out for. 

The type of man parents would tell their children to stay away from. 

Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until I started to hear the noises coming from Luke’s Unit. 

Unit 6B. 

The walls of the apartment complex were thin enough that people could sometimes hear each other if they spoke loud enough. 

And Luke was doing that just: sometimes I’d hear him talking to someone upstairs, but I never would hear a reply back; he stomps around, and moves his furniture constantly. 

After the first two weeks of knocking on his door, I eventually gave up. 

But that was until the smell started. 

The ventilation systems between Luke and I’s unit are interconnected between the units, so whatever smell comes from his unit can come down to mine, and mine goes to his. 

But just recently I began to smell a faint, sweet, earthy aroma, like it was a rotting fruit mixed with something bitter or chemical.

The first time I smelled it, I thought maybe I’d left something to rot in the kitchen. I tore the place apart looking for it. 

But nothing turned up. I even cleaned the fridge — a rare event, believe me. 

But the smell never went away no matter what I did. 

Then came the spores.

Tiny white puffs drifted out of the vent and drifted around my apartment. 

They clung to surfaces, leaving faint, sticky trails whenever I touched them. I tried to vacuum and wipe them down from any of my furniture, but every morning, there’d somehow be more.

After the fourth day of dealing with the spores, I eventually filed a maintenance ticket. 

I even got on a call with the building manager, Hoffman, but he was as useful as a wet paper towel. 

“It’s probably just dust,” he said over the phone.

"The vents are old. I’d advise you to deal with them until we can get it solved.” I could also hear him smirking. 


It never got solved. 

Another week goes by. And with the noises, the smell, and the spores, I’ve had enough, and for one last time, just in spite, I went back up to unit 6B to try and confront Luke one last time. 

It was just after 8. 

I stood outside 6B for a full minute before knocking. 

The hallway was dead silent. The only sounds that came were the cars passing by and the crickets chirping.

I knocked again, and again, and for the fourth time I knocked once again, louder that time. 

Nothing.

I thought that it was going to be like the last time when I tried to speak to him. So, I turned my heel to begin walking back down the stairs, until I heard a creak. 

The door opened just a sliver. A pale, glassy eye stared out at me through the crack.

“Yes?” Luke answered. 

He was quiet and sounded like he was fearful, but overall, nothing out of the ordinary that I could see. 

“Uh, hi. I’m Shawn. I live below you—unit 5B. I think something might be coming through the vents — like spores or smoke or something? It’s starting to affect my place.”

There was an awkward silence on his end. Nothing out of the ordinary for me; I thrive in silence and respect silent and introverted people. 

But in Luke’s case, I felt an uneasy tension coming from within that door. 

“You’ve seen the smoke?” he asks. 

“Yeah. It smells.”

The door creaked more open, I could now see parts of Luke’s blonde hair that looked greasy, and half of his sluggish face. “It’s not for you,” he tells me. 

“It’s not for anyone,” I remind him, “I just want to know what’s causing it. Mold? Fungi? If it’s dangerous—”

“—It’s not dangerous,” he said too quickly. “Unless you see her.”

I blinked. “What?”

The door slammed shut.

I stood there for a moment, and for the first time I thought ‘what if I was imagining it all?’ the noises, the smell, all of it. 

But when I returned to my apartment, the smell was stronger than ever. The spores were thicker and were getting harder to clean. 

That night, I slept with a damp towel pressed against the vent. It didn’t help.

The next morning, I called a private HVAC guy and told him I would pay if he came over to check the vent. 

When he popped open the vent, he looked confused and even a little nervous.

“There’s definitely something coming from upstairs,” he said, coughing as he leaned into the shaft. “Kind of… fungal, maybe. I’d need to get into the unit above to know more.”

“Good luck with that,” I muttered.

Paul left my apartment promising he’ll come back with a solution, and returned a few days later with a friend. 

They installed a filter and sealed off the ductwork to 6B. I paid them under the table. 

Whatever the hell was up there, I didn’t want it coming down into my lungs anymore.

After that, things got better.

The smell faded. The spores stopped. I started sleeping again. 

My apartment finally didn’t smell. And for the first time in weeks, I felt like myself.

Until last Friday night.

It was 3:33 AM when I woke up to the sounds of footsteps walking inside of my apartment. 

Then, a loud bang — like furniture being overturned.
Silence followed afterwards. 

I sat in my bed wondering what I should do. 

There was a locked safe in my closet where I kept a loaded handgun. 

Slowly, I  slipped out of bed barefoot to retrieve the handgun. The closet was only a few feet away, but it felt like crossing a minefield. 

I punched in the code with shaking fingers, praying I hadn’t fumbled the digits. 

And with a beauty, the safe clicked open.

I now had the Glock 19.

I clicked off the safety and held it low as I crept down the hallway. My legs were stiff, like they didn’t want to obey. I reached the living room and flicked on the light.

Nothing.

The armchair was toppled, lying sideways. A lamp shattered on the floor. But no one was there. 

I checked the kitchen. Nothing.

Bathroom. Empty.

Then I turned toward the hallway that led to the front door — and froze.

The door to the coat closet near the entrance was cracked open.

I always keep it shut. Always.

My grip on the gun tightened.

Slowly, I stepped forward. One inch at a time. I reached out with my left hand— a man lunged at me.

He came out like a shadow thrown into motion — a blur of limbs and adrenaline. I stumbled back, firing—

BANG.

I blew a hole in the ceiling. The impact of his shoulder knocked me off my feet. 

We crashed to the floor, gun tumbling from my hand, skittering across the hardwood.

He was on top of me before I could even breathe, fists swinging. He was yelling and hollering like a maniac. 

One punch caught me across the jaw, and it stung. The second I blocked with my forearm, pain shot down to my elbow.

I twisted, got my knee between us, and kicked him in his balls. He grunted, crawling back, clutching onto his manhood.

I scrambled toward the gun. He grabbed my ankle, trying to drag me back, but I kicked wildly, caught him in the chest. 

When I was close to grabbing the gun, he tackled me again, and he pulled me up by my collar, and we slammed into the wall. 

He slammed my head so hard I thought I saw stars. My back was against the wall, and I could see from within the darkness and blonde hair, a very angry and possessed Luke. 

"Luke?" I choked out. "What the hell—?"

He didn’t answer. Just growled — actually growled — and reached into his jacket, pulling out a knife, and I panicked; I slammed my palm into his throat. His windpipe folded under the blow, and he coughed, stumbling back again.

I dove. Fingers closed around the gun as I spun around and fired.

BANG.

The round tore into his shoulder. He screamed, and the knife fell from his pocket. He clutched his arm as he fell to the floor.

I stood over him, panting, gun raised, every nerve on fire. Blood smeared the wood beneath him, dark and glossy. He looked up at me with wide, furious eyes.

“Luke—what the hell are you doing in my apartment?!” I demanded.

He was silent for a long, choking second.

Then his face shifted. From what used to be anger was now shifting to terror. 

His pupils widened, and he stuttered. 

“No,” he whispered. “No, no, no—she told me you were next—”

I stepped closer, Glock still trained on him. “Who told you?”

Luke’s eyes filled with tears. He was shaking now, mumbling nonsense between shallow gasps.

Then, in one final, lucid moment, he met my eyes.
“She has her eyes on you now.”

He grabbed the Glock from my hand, and in one swift motion, he aimed it inside of his mouth and pulled the trigger. 

Blood and brains splattered across the walls, and from what was left of Luke were bits of flesh and brains like a smashed pumpkin. 

Luke was dead. He killed himself. But why?

After the incident, I couldn’t leave my house. I don’t know why I didn’t call the police but I never did nor did they ever come. 

But ever since that night, I’ve started seeing things.

Just at the edge of my eyes, I could see a shape in the corner of the room. 

A blotch of color that vanishes when I look straight at it. 

I’ve caught some glimpses of it, and from the sight of it, it looks like a flower. A fucked up, mutated flower. 

The smell and the spores then came back, and I was now back in the routine of smelling and cleaning the spores and trying to barricade myself from the smell. 

I started moving furniture. Tearing open vents. Peeling back wallpaper. I keep thinking if I find it — if I can dig it out — it’ll stop.

But it doesn’t stop.

And I eventually gave up. 

Now, I am alone in my apartment. I like being alone, that’s why I moved to this complex. I can see something staring at me from the corner of my living room. 

A tall, pale, slender woman with white Datura petals and spores coming out of her petals and investing my apartment. 

She talks to me. 

And I am deeply afraid of her.

She tells me that Luke was useless to her, but I now have a chance to prove to her my worth.
