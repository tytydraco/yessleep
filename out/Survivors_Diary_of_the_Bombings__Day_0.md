**My name is Jônatas Oliveira. I’m 23 years old and I work at Solaris. I decided to write this down, recording everything I remember from the day. Maybe it will help someone, or maybe it will help me keep my sanity.**

**Day 0 – October 26, 1962 – São Paulo, Brazil**

**06:17**  
I woke up feeling heavy, as if my body knew something big was coming. The sky was blue but felt heavy, silent, loaded with an invisible tension. Morning light came through the window, cold and sharp. I sipped my coffee slowly, without appetite, staring at the cup, tasting the bitterness. The radio crackled with news of international tensions, missiles pointed at distant cities. Hard words, names of faraway countries… every syllable felt like a threat to my own world. I felt a tightness in my chest, an anxiety I couldn’t shake.

**06:48**  
I tried to get ready faster but ended up running late. An old man at the bus stop was loudly arguing with the conductor about the end of the world, pointing at the sky. I froze, unsure whether to laugh or feel fear. The sound of the bus arriving was unnaturally loud, as if every metal piece vibrated inside my chest.

**07:03**  
I got on the bus, squeezed among the people, smelling stale coffee, sweat, and newspapers. Everyone kept their gaze low, no one spoke, faces heavy. Each stop felt slower than the last.

**07:37**  
I arrived late at Solaris. I sat at my desk, trying to act normal, but my hand trembled as I turned on the typewriter. Colleagues whispered about the possibility of war, missile rumors, attack speculations. I saw the same fear in their eyes that I felt in my own. Even the smell of coffee in the cafeteria seemed heavier, lifeless.

**09:15**  
The company radio started talking about diplomacy and negotiations, but the words sounded hollow. Each sentence felt like a silent warning. I gripped my hands, feeling chills down my spine and an odd nausea in my stomach.

**10:47**  
I looked out the window and saw children playing in the block, women carrying groceries, everything seemingly normal. But inside, the world felt like it was collapsing with every step someone took on the street.

**12:03**  
I ate lunch almost without chewing. Each bite felt like a ton of weight. Colleagues whispered about what they would do if an attack happened. I imagined the cities mentioned in the newspapers, the explosions, the people running. My chest tightened, my throat dry.

**14:22**  
A distant siren made me jump. I looked around; no one seemed to notice, but my heart was racing. Every sound seemed amplified, every shadow, every movement, a threat.

**15:11**  
I tried to work, but my mind was restless. I wrote numbers, checked papers, but it all seemed meaningless. Thoughts about destruction, the people I knew in other cities… every memory seemed to mix with fear.

**16:36**  
I went outside to smoke a bit. The cold wind on my face made me shiver. A car passed slowly, engine roaring, carrying the weight of the world. The old man at the bus stop was there again, talking to himself about bombs and chaos.

**17:30**  
When I got home, I turned on the radio. The trembling voice of the announcer brought the first wave of shock:

My heart raced. Each city mentioned seemed to crumble before me. The world outside still followed its routine, but inside me, everything was falling apart. I sat on the sofa, hands shaking, trying to breathe. A silent despair took hold, a total sense of helplessness.

**18:23**  
I looked out into the street. Some neighbors came to their doors, others whispered on the sidewalks. Low voices, shared fears, no one really knew what to do. Some spoke of shelters, others said to stay inside. The fear was tangible, an invisible thread connecting each of us in that collective panic.

**19:08**  
I sat on the sofa again, trying to organize my thoughts. The world outside seemed normal, but inside each person, there was a void, a silent horror that no sound could fill. I looked at the ceiling and wondered: how can the sky be calm while the world collapses far away?

**19:56**  
Shadows in the room grew longer. The radio continued crackling, neighbors still gathered slowly. I felt every breath they took, every tremor in their hands, every lost look. It was a mix of fear, disbelief, and the strange sense that nothing would ever be the same.
