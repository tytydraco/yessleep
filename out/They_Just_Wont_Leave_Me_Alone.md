It all began a few months ago; a series of random phone calls starting with heavy breathing, some odd scratching noises and a whispering that, I'll be honest, sent shivers not just through my body, but through my soul.

First off, I saw this as some sort of teenage prank, so I kept answering, showing them it didn't bother me. 

The calls continued and after a few weeks, I changed my number. Regardless, the calls kept coming, and after three times of changing my number, I decided to contact the police.

They set up taps on all phones that were receiving the calls, told me to continue answering them and said they'd be monitoring the situation. 

After a week of running in circles, and after no other signs of crime were being committed, the police decided to leave it and told me the calls would eventually stop. Over these past four or so months, I've changed my number seventeen times. And they *still* keep calling.

So, I dug deep, ended up spending all my savings and hired myself a personal private hacker. This guy is one of the best, and even he can't comprehend most of it. Honestly, neither can I.

In regards to the house, the only information he could apparently find, was that the former occupants had succumbed to a murder-suicide. After slicing their partners throat wide open, they then hung themselves from the top of the stairs using the telephone cord.


Turns out, not only are the calls being made from the same phones each and every time, but it was even traced back to them when they were turned off. If that didn't make sense, basically, if they rang my mobile the call would be traced back to my home phone, even if it was off or unplugged, and vice versa. But even he agreed, terrifying as it may be, there's nothing else here that can be done; no other crime has been committed.

Last week, though, everything changed. The calls became much more real and much more terrifying.

The heavy breathing is now replaced with incoherent voices. The scratching noises have changed to a kind of muffling noise, and the whispers have now turned in to horrifying threats.

If I don't answer, they leave voicemails, over and over.

At 1:01am this morning, my phone rings;

"Hello?"

"Tonight, I'm gonna slit your throat open, niiice aand wiiide."

*FUCKING HELL!* I dart up in bed.

**Scratching and muffling** 

"...Dying isn't so bad you know...wanna see?..."

Normally I hang up on them, this time, they hung up on me, and this scared me even more. No way could I go back to sleep now, so I went downstairs.

At 2:02am my house phone rings. I didn't answer, I let the machine get it;

"...So you don't want to talk to us now?...No?...But we want to talk to you sweetheart...we want you to *join us*... we can see you, you know...sitting on your sofa, biting your nails....where are you walking to?...aww come on now, don't hang up on us sweethea..."

I can't stand this anymore. 

They just won't leave me alone.
