I know it sounds stupid. I know it sounds unlikely but I just didn't realise at the time. Somehow changes along the way just made sense. 

There was never something unnatural or unlikely about him. He just grew a bit larger by the day, so did his shadow. Whenever I saw him, I never thought 
"Why is he suddenly that tall?" 
If anything, I thought 
"I never realised how tall he was, funny, anyways.." 

It was the same process with all his little distortions. The sudden drop of temperature whenever he entered a room. The general darkness surrounding him. The way his skin got paler and paler by the day. He never lost his skin though, he wasn't reduced to just his bones as I first thought. His snow-white skin just fell in while his skeleton continued to grow until it resembled bleached leather draped over wood. 

He started complaining about all the voices he kept hearing. About us breathing too loud or stomping our feet too much. Naively I chalked it up to his mental health declining since Coras death. He heard everything, all the time. At least that's what it looked like to us. His hands always covered his ears. He never lost his eyes. They just lay loosely within those caverns that grew way too big to contain them. Piercing blue and unnerving to look at. They almost seemed to be falling out any minute, they never did. His mind didn't change. If anything, his transformation gave him more motivation to make this city a better place. Marc adjusted well to the role he was forced into, being our new god. 

The people enjoyed his new form. I couldn't tell if they knew what would eventually become of him. I think they neither knew, nor recognised the changes, just like me and Marleen. They just fell back into the habit of telling their secrets to the god they knew and loved. But this god wasn't going to take their lives for another month of supplies. This god tried to be better and different. His plan didn't go as he wished. 

"Look, this will become the mightiest potato tree in no time!" 
Marc pointed at a little leaf on the ground. 
"Not how this works, bro." 
Talking to him in this form was just weird. The old lovable idiot that used to eat crayons up until middle school in the body of an eldritch abomination. 

There we stood, discussing plants in this endless hellhole of this field. How I hated it for looking just like it did every other day and the day before that. Marc managed to make a few plants grow, but at this rate he couldn't keep any of us alive once the food ran out completely. But what could I have said or done? There wasn't a solution I could think of. 

As we walked back down the staircase, there was commotion in the courtyard. Marc immediately pressed his hands against the sides of his head. There were people laughing and talking. 
"What's going on there?", I asked no one in particular. Marc made an agonised face. He lost the ability to close his eyes days ago. Seeing him sleep was the worst. 

"It's a wedding", he said. 
For real? Why would anyone celebrate a wedding during a food crisis like this? Well,  I guess there wasn't a better moment in the future either. We quickly walked past the festivities on our way to the apartment. I saw people singing and dancing. I slowed down unintentionally. When was the last time I laughed like that? My insides felt empty. Almost as dark and cold as they did whenever I was around Marc. He grabbed my arm and pulled me along. 

We returned to our room and Marc slammed the door shut. There were still some noises audible through the door. Quiet enough that Marc stopped covering his ears. When we told Marleen about the celebrations, she decided to join in. I stayed with Marc out of solidarity. I know they would have wanted to see him there. I would never understand what their fascination with this god entity was. A few hours passed and the music and laughter stopped. I went out onto the hallway to check. They all left. It was unusually silent. They didn't just disperse into their individual homes did they? What a weird way to end a party. 

I mentioned that observation to Miranda the next time we had tea together. She became pretty important to me over time. I hadn't had much of my old friends left and talking to her felt so familiar in a way. And she made great tea of course. 
"Interesting, maybe they just went outside?" 
"I thought, you said, no one ever goes outside? It's useless space and so on, remember?"
She thought about my words. 
"Oh you mean the fields. No, not that outside. I'm talking about the garden." 

I almost dropped my cup. What a way to mention something like that as if it was nothing. 
"You never told me about a garden!" 
"I didn't? Well, I don't like it there. It makes me feel â€¦ watched." 
She said, playing with a strand of her hair. This was huge. I didn't expect a garden to be the solution that would take me back home but still. All information was good information. 
"Can you show it to me?" 
She sighed. 
I think I was always most interested in the things she wanted to stay away from. And I knew, feeling sorry for her wouldn't help her, but I couldn't just ignore the existence of a whole nother area I hadn't yet seen. 
"I can. But not today. Today isn't a good day for that." 

As I returned to the flat, Marc wasn't there. I expected him to be in the fields where the noise was minimal. He wasn't. He didn't come back home for a few days after that. 

The next time I saw him, he was talking to a group of older women a few stories down. He wasn't so much talking as he was listening to them. Shadow was pouring out from underneath his cloak. He looked just like the old god from this perspective. He was patiently nodding to the old ladies words. One noticed me staring at them and alerted the others. They all looked at me, including Marc. I decided to wave at him. He didn't respond. I barely saw his face underneath the shadow from his hood.

The day we all dreaded had finally come. The grocery store has been completely emptied out. I took one last round in hopes to find some scraps left behind. There was nothing. Not a crumb on the floor or berry left on the shelves. Most citizens didn't look too worried. Many stocked up on supplies many days ago. 

I didn't, it didn't feel right. Marleen kept a few bags of gummy worms with her at all times. They wouldn't take her far but hopefully they would at least let her keep faith one day longer. I went without food for the next two days. It wasn't much of a change since I already survived on the bare minimum before. I expected riots, fights over the last pieces of food hidden in people's shelves. It didn't go like that at all. Nothing really changed. People had less reason to leave their homes. That was all. The hallways became silent. Everyone just stuck to what they had left and forgot about the rest. It was a peaceful downfall. 

On day three, Miranda shared a loaf of bread with me. I couldn't thank her enough. She finally agreed to take me to the garden. I'm embarrassed to admit that I appreciated that more than the bread. 

I followed her to one of the doors on the ground floor, opposite of the great staircase. I totally forgot my plan to check all those doors at some point. I guess I got distracted. Also, it felt wrong, knowing that there would be ordinary people living behind most of them. She opened the white, wooden door, one just like any other, to reveal a stretch of perfectly cut, green grass. 

The blinding sunlight came as a surprise. Until this point I was under the assumption, everything but the top most floors would effectively be underground. It wasn't. The garden was huge and so unnaturally flat. On the left and right side, there wasn't an end in sight. And in front of us, something that sent me down a completely new rabbit hole. 

Behind the garden, past a small baseball field with its comically small tribune, stood a massive wall. It reached at least the height of the building we came from and stretched on seemingly forever to both directions. Was it another building? I didn't see an entrance. On the second look, I noticed small fences setting a limit to the endless lawn.  Being out here felt like rabbits must feel inside their tiny cages in someone's backyard. A few people were sitting at the tribune and playing field, talking to each other. 

Miranda and I walked a little closer to them. There wasn't much to see but vast open space, still it was so much to take in at once. Only as I turned around did I finally get an answer to the mystery of the small rooms that had been bothering me for so long. The wall of the building we had just come from was covered in randomly placed concrete boxes, protruding from the building's surface. No columns or supports to keep them in place. I suddenly felt very unsafe, thinking about our little room just hanging on by nothing but a front wall. 

I turned back around to the baseball area, just to be greeted by a familiar face, walking up the tribune. It looked even smaller compared to his enormous size. It was Marc, only, it wasn't. I finally saw him clear again after not seeing him at all for many days. Where his piercing blue eyes once were, was now a bottomless pit of pure blackness.
