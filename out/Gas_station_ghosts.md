The time: 3:35 am. I still have about a couple hours left before I pass my shift to the daytime worker and I’m able to go home to my apartment that’s ever so falling apart, I picture waking up eating cup noodles and going about my day doing absolutely nothing other than sleeping. Just to go to work and do it all over again for a fucking eternity. The ceiling lights shined a bleach white that would’ve flash banged you if you turned the lights on in the dark, the fridges had a seemingly infinite selection of monster drinks that he could go for but couldn’t afford and god forbid he stole, he needed this job.
 He looked out the window and only saw his reflection in the glare, his name tag introducing him: “Hi, my name is JOEL” Joel’s name was scratched into the name tag in all caps. He saw car lights behind the glare and looked closer, a silver car pulled in and parked by one of the gas pumps. 
He couldn’t tell if it was the glare or if there were tinted windows on the car because he could only see pitch black on the cars windows, Joel ignored it and hoped that he wouldn’t have to talk to anybody anytime soon.
He looked at the time again: 3:47 am. The grey digital clock with a black wire that led into a dusty surge protector under the dirty ass counter; it was the only thing in the store that wasn’t drowned in absolute color. A bang was heard and Joel’s head turned, the silver car was nowhere to be found, upon opening the doors and listening, he heard nothing. It was chilly tonight and the collared shirt he was forced to wear for work did Jack shit for the cold. 
The door whined on his way back in and he moved behind the counter. He heard footsteps. He turned to the right, in the direction of the footsteps, and saw nothing. He looked for a head poking above the aisles for anybody currently in the store, there was nothing.
Now he was scared this job wasn’t worth dying for and the last thing we wanted was to be stabbed or shot or choked from behind. Joel stayed frozen and his guts stayed in knots, Joel continued to stare at nothing waiting for something… a bang from the other side of the store grabbed his attention one of the fridge doors was opened. He walked over it, a coke can, still hissing coke foam on the floor. He bent down to pick it up, the damn thing exploded and he nearly shit his pants Joel thought about old-style cartoons and how if he was in one he would’ve dropped dead like a plank from a heart attack. He might as well be in a cartoon if his entire life was just for the entertainment of others as if I was in some Truman show.
The door squealed and he got up to look but only caught it closing, he looked for customers in the store and found no one, he looked outside and saw no cars. Maybe someone wanted to play a prank? And they just ran out of view? But Joel should’ve seen it, the windows stretched too far for Joel not to catch anybody. He moved to the back of the store for a mop and kept an eye on the window, he moved towards the mess and turned the corner to find a man in black. Sprawled and face down its grey hair looked plastered on. Joel stepped back and looked for an answer, he looked to the counter which had a phone he could call 911 on. 
He looked back and saw a clean tile floor. No body was anywhere, Joel was not religious but he prayed for god. For time to go faster and he could leave and forget about this he looked for solace in on the clock: 4:50 am. Joel put back the mop and walked back to the counter, the air colder than it should be. He waited for the next bad thing to happen so he could run out of this store and get home, the lights turned off, and turned back on. Joel stared at this woman now in front of him, it’s skin sagged like a lazy skin suit, her eyes were dialated and only a pin of white could be seen on its edges, the hair was wet and clinged to her face like barnacles on a ship, she stayed still like a statue and was naked. Joel looked away and saw more bodies, and more eyes watching. The lights flickered and the store was empty, Joel moved to the back to his locker “fuck this” he grabbed his keys and his stuff and ran out.
His car with a faded hood sat patiently, Joel started it and booked it. Going down the road at 67 mph, a deer, a fucking deer decided to cross. Joel swerved and drove into a tree.
He opened his eyes and looked out his right window into the forest that looked damn near infinite in the dark. He looked into his rear view mirror, his jaw looked poorly taped to his face by a  hanging piece of skin. He wanted to scream, he wanted to cover his face, he wanted to run, but he couldn’t move, he couldn’t do anything. A tap, tap, tapping on his window. He looked out and saw a torso with legs and a head that was too high for him to see. He blinked and saw 2, then blinked again and saw 6 and more he couldn’t count. Like unwavering, unmoving vultures, they waited and watched him die. For there will be nobody left. No body left.
