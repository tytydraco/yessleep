Near the quietness of the cave at the edge of our city, I often found myself seeking solace. Away from the hustle of the city, it was my sanctuary. A place where I could just be, without the constant noise and demands of the outside world. But today, my solitude was interrupted by a sight that made my heart race and my palms sweat.

There, lying on the ground, was a man. Unconscious, with a gash on his stomach that oozed blood. It was a sight that sent a shiver down my spine. Instinctively, my first thought was to run. But something held me back. Maybe it was the nurse in me, or maybe it was just my conscience, but I couldn't just leave him there.

As I knelt beside the unconscious man, a wave of nausea washed over me. The metallic scent of blood hung heavy in the air, filling my lungs with a sickening sweetness that made bile rise in my throat. My heart hammered in my chest, each beat echoing in my ears like a drumbeat of temptation.

I felt a primal urge stirring within me, clawing at the edges of my consciousness like a beast desperate to be set free. It was a hunger unlike anything I had ever experienced, a gnawing emptiness that seemed to consume me from the inside out.

Tears welled up in my eyes as I fought against the overwhelming desire to give in, to surrender to the darkness that threatened to engulf me. I clenched my fists, digging my nails into my palms until they drew blood, anything to distract myself from the insatiable craving that threatened to consume me whole.

But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't escape it. It was like a relentless force, a primal instinct that pulsed through my veins with every beat of my heart. I wanted to scream, to cry out for help, but I was alone, trapped in a nightmare of my own making.

In that moment, I felt like a monster, a creature of the night driven by an insatiable hunger for blood. I hated myself for it, despised the darkness that lurked within me, but try as I might, I couldn't escape it.

And so, with a heavy heart and a mind clouded by fear and self-loathing, I made a choice. A choice to do what was right, no matter how difficult it may be. Because deep down, I knew that giving in to the darkness would only lead to destruction. And I refused to let that happen. I knew I had to get him help, but then my phone buzzed in my pocket, breaking the silence.

It was the hospital. They needed me urgently. A surge of panic washed over me. “What should I do?”, I thought, as I felt torn between my duty as a nurse and this...strange desire that gnawed at me from within. It was like I was being pulled in two different directions, and I didn't know which way to go.

I looked down at the man, still unconscious, and felt a pang of guilt. What if I left him here and something happened to him? But then again, what if I went to the hospital and...I don't even want to think about it.
