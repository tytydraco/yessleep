I was eight when I became a ghost, rising from the shallow grave where my stepfather had buried me in the woods behind our house. 

I still remember the moment of my murder.

I knew it was coming. You can sense when you are the object of hate, right? Like a big black hot ball of energy coming at you, ready to crush you. I knew he was going to hurt me. The way he looked at me. The way he never said my name. The way he seemed to bump up against me - he had made me fall a few times, once down the stairs, but I had not been seriously hurt. Just bruises.

And then one day, my mother was out. I had tried not to be alone with him but he cornered me in the kitchen. I was at the fridge, scrounging around for something to eat.

The last thing I remembered was his eyes as he lunged in for the attack. There was a flash of horrible pain, and I heard myself scream. I tasted blood. Then everything went dark. The last thought I had was "welp, now I'm dead."

\*\*\*

And when I opened my eyes, I knew I had become a ghost, and my first thought was "Now he can't hurt me anymore". I knew humans couldn't touch ghosts, so I was happy to be one.

I stood over the grave he had dug for me and thought about what to do. Ghosts go back to the places they live, and so I went back to the house. There was nowhere else for me to be.

I didn't go in. Even though I knew as a ghost he couldn't hurt me, I didn't want to be seen. I went straight into the basement. That seemed like a good place for a ghost. I made myself a sort of hidey place in the back, and stayed there.

Time passed.

Sometimes I would go up in the dead of night, poking around in the kitchen.

Then one night I crept up to their bedroom and stood at the foot of their bed. My mother jerked out of sleep, sat up, stared at me, and then screamed and screamed. I fled back to my hidey hole in the basement. I never tried going up again.  

They left that house soon after and others came. But they didn’t stay long either. As much fun as it is to imagine haunted houses, it actually isn’t fun to live in one. And so families came and went, and I grew more forgetful about how living humans do things. 

I look back to those years as if in a dream now, my ghostly existence flitting through the house, the basement, and the woods. Time lost its meaning for me.  

\*\*\*

Until Lily and her family came. Lily was often ill, and couldn’t get out and run around like others. I heard it whispered through the walls that she may not live much longer. I wondered if she would become a ghost like me, perhaps joining me in my basement home, creeping up to the kitchen and out into the woods every now and then. It wouldn’t be terrible to have a companion in the dark and dreary basement.  

So, despite what had happened those years ago, when my mother sat up in bed screaming and screaming, her mouth an open black hole of suffering and misery, I decided to visit Lily in the bedroom where she lay in bed. 

Late one night, I crept up to her room, and quietly laid my hand on the doorknob and swung it open. I heard Lily restlessly move, and then sit up.  

She stared at me in the dim night glow. I waited for her to scream. But she didn’t.

Instead, she said quite clearly “I heard it was little boy who haunted this house. But you are a young man.” 

Nobody had spoken to me for so long. I frowned, trying to understand her words.  

She spoke again. 

“Who are you?” she asked . 

I understood that one. “I am Daniel. A ghost”. It had been years since I had spoken, but the words were coming to me. I remembered becoming a ghost. 

Lily got out of bed, and walked towards me. “Daniel?” 

She reached out, took my wrist, and holding it tight, turned me to a large shimmering mirror against the wall. I saw myself, a lanky pale young man looking back at me. I was so confused.  

I turned back to Lily. Memories and futures started running through my mind.  

Lily said quietly “You’re not a ghost Daniel”. 

I can still remember the warmth of my tears on my cheeks as they squeezed out of my eyes. I closed my eyes briefly, remembering the time I thought I became a ghost, opening my eyes, seeing the flecks of blue-black night sky and stars through the loose earth over me. My hands, scrabbling through and pulling me out.

I remembered the cool air on my face as I crawled out of my grave and started walking home, covered with dried blood. 

“You’re alive” said Lily, and I was, I was there in her room, looking into a mirror at myself, a young man. A car drove by outside, its bright lights shining into the room and lighting up my face.  

Lily sat me down next to her, on the edge of the bed. 

We began talking. 

And I never lived as a ghost again.
