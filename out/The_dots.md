Let me start from the beginning, we leave my cousins house and get in her car, we start driving to the pit and when we pass BHS it starts to get REALLY windy. I had my window down and fuck it hit me in the face like a brick, I roll up my window and we keep driving. The next thing, the radio stops working suddenly, and the inside lights turn on. We all are weirded out, but that's not the weirdest that happens all night. So we keep driving and finally get to the pit, we pick a spot and park, get out, and start smashing plates (forgot to mention we were also gonna do that) and the 3rd one I throw, I hear it smash, but when I go to check if there are any peices big enough to throw again, and the damn thing is gone. Getting weirder. I dont mention it to my family because I think I'm just being dumb.

Now shit gets weird and this is where you are gonna start to think I'm either crazy or I'm lying. But please just keep reading, I need other people to hear this. 

At this point we have been there for about 2 hours, maybe a little more, and it's around 9 or 10 at night, star-y skies and pitch black. We start setting off the fireworks and start with some small little firecrackers, then move onto the big ones. After around 5 minutes, as I'm looking up at an exploding firework, I see what looks like one of the stars start moving, I ask my brother "did you see that?" He says "see what?" I point at the moving dot and say "that" and my cousins look up and one of them says "yo whatt" and my brother sees it and says "nahh, that's moving do you guys see that?" We all say yes and nod, and then the dot stops, switches directions, and continues moving. We are all freaked out, but we keep setting off the fireworks, after we set the next one off, the dot moves towards, it. We all see it, and get too freaked out. So we pack our shit and GTFO.

That's not the end though, as we are packing up, it gets windy again, and the dot moves away from us, towards the forest, and as we are driving away we see the trees to our right moving, and a bright light, landed in the trees. 

My cousin floors it, and my other one starts screaming. 

We get to her house and all start searching for known alien activity in bathurst. We didnt find anything similar to what just happened, but we all decide to just go to bed. I wake up around 3-4 hours later, and for some reason I decide to look outside, because why not? And guess what I see? there is a bright colored dot in the sky above her house. The same color as the one we saw at the pit. 

Freaked me the fuck out and I ran back inside, got under the blankets, put headphones on, and closed my eyes. 

The next day, my cousin wakes me up at 6:30, she says "follow me" I get up groggy as hell, follow her to the car, sit down, and fall asleep again. She doesn't bother to wake me up during the ride, but when she wakes me up, where are we? The pit. I shake my head furiously and say "ughh why?" My cousin shushes me, and keeps driving for a few second untill we stop driving. 

After we park, we all step out, and there are 4 different colored dots in the sky moving in different directions, then, the stop. And at breakneck speed, speed up towards eachother, and disappear. 

That freaked us all out immediately, and we again GTFO. we get back to my cousins house, and go back to sleep. When we wake up a few hours later, no one brings it up. I'm assuming they are all trying to forget about it, so I stay quiet and eat my breakfast.

The end.
