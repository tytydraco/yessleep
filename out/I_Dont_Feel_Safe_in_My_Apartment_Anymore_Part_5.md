I didn’t go looking for answers right away.

After the last update, realizing that entire chunks of normal life had been happening in my apartment without my knowledge of them, I needed to slow down. Not because I felt calmer, but because reacting too quickly had felt dangerous.

I was still sleeping badly. Still waking up tense, checking rooms out of habit. But nothing new changed in my apartment. Nothing was out of place. No clean dishes I didn’t remember washing. No moved furniture. No laundry.

For the last two days, everything stayed exactly as it should have been.

So instead of watching my own space, I started paying attention to the building.

Not in a dramatic way. I wasn’t prowling the halls or listening at doors. I just stopped taking things for granted.

Our building is old, but unremarkable. The kind of place people move into because it’s affordable and close enough to work. People come and go. You recognize faces more than names.

There’s a corkboard near the mailboxes in the lobby. I’ve walked past it hundreds of times without really reading it. Notices about water shutoffs. Maintenance reminders. A worn printed sheet with apartment numbers, tenants and availability.

That’s where I started.

I stood there and actually read the notices instead of skimming them. That was when I noticed how often the same apartment numbers came up.

Several apartments had fresh pen marks next to them, names squeezed in like an update, dated in the margin. Not “coming soon.” Not “under maintenance.” Just vacant, then occupied.

No notes about cleaning. No notices about repairs.

That’s not impossible. But it’s unusual.

Most apartments sit empty for a while. Things need fixing. Paperwork takes time. Here, it was like the building never paused.

I pulled out my phone and started scrolling through old photos I’d taken over the years in the lobby without thinking about it. Holiday decorations. A notice about the elevator being out of service.

In the background of some of those photos, the corkboard was visible.

Older versions of it.

There were names there I didn’t see anymore.

Most of them meant nothing to me. But a few did.

I couldn’t place them exactly, and that bothered me. They felt familiar in the way strangers do when you’ve passed them enough times to register their existence without ever learning anything about them.

Someone who used to take the stairs instead of the elevator.  
Someone whose door I used to hear close late at night.

I couldn’t remember when I’d last noticed them.

I checked the mailroom next.

There were empty slots that had been cleared out recently. Not overflowing with old letters. Not neglected. Just… reset. Cleaned the way management does when someone is gone and the space needs to be ready again.

I looked for forwarding notices.

There weren’t any.

People forget mail. They get packages delivered late. Even the most organized move-outs leave traces.

Here, there were none.

I went back upstairs and sat on the couch, trying to talk myself down. This still wasn’t proof of anything. Buildings have turnover. Memory is unreliable. Stress makes patterns appear where there aren’t any.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that the building handled absence very well.

Too well.

No one had been reported missing. I checked local notices and online bulletins. There were no alerts. No posts asking if anyone had seen someone.

Nothing dramatic had happened.

It was quieter than that.

Administrative.

Names removed. Spaces reassigned. Life continuing without interruption.

I thought about my apartment. About how everything always returned to the same baseline. Clean. Ordered. Like the space itself didn’t want evidence of disruption.

There were no signs of disruption. No delays. Everything I’d seen pointed to the same thing: whatever happened when someone stopped being here, it was handled. Quietly.

Names came off lists. Apartments were reassigned. Mail slots were cleared. Life continued without anyone needing to ask why.

I tried to convince myself that this was still just anxiety talking. That I was reading too much into normal turnover and bad timing.

I felt unsettled with what I found, so later on I went back down to the lobby before locking myself in for the night. I told myself I just wanted to check the board again, to make sure I hadn’t imagined any of it.

I scanned the tenant sheet again. Slowly this time, line by line, forcing myself not to rush.

That was when I noticed my apartment number.

It was listed the same as before. No notes. No warnings. No indication that anything was wrong.

Except my name wasn’t next to it.

I checked twice.

Then I forced myself to check again, slower.

My unit was marked as occupied.

But I wasn’t listed as the tenant.

I stood there longer than I should have, feeling that familiar cold settle in my chest.

Because whatever had been happening inside my apartment wasn’t just something I was noticing late.

It was something the building had already accounted for.

And it didn’t seem to be waiting for me to leave.

It looked like it had already moved on.
