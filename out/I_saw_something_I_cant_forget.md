So it was Thanksgiving dinner, my cousin was at my house, and my cousin had brought his bikes for us to ride on , me, my sister and my cousin. And there was this pond near my house and we just had to bike down to it. So we start biking down to it and we get to the pond so we take out are fishing poles and place them on the dock.



And then my cousin begins to get the red worms we brought for are bait. ( the pond is secluded by a dence forest.) But when my cousin is getting out the red worms i saw something moving in the woods. So my dumbass 10 yr old self goes to check it out (cause i thought it was a animal.) And when I get close enough I realize it wasn't a animal. It was a man, I Remember him being very skinny and have black, greasy, shaggy hair. And he had a tank top and shorts on (i think.) And I before I cause say "what" I was walking towards him like he had a Transe on me.



The i Remember looking down and seeing something in his hands. It was my neighbors dogs head. The dog had just been called missing and my aunt was talking about it. And then I just snapped out of the Transe and running far, and ,my sister and cousin goes running for me, leaving the fishing poles behind at the pond and I didn't stop running until I made it back to where are bikes were (the bikes were like 2/3 miles away.)



And I remember getting on the bike with my cousin and sister riding with me. And when we got home we sat down on the couch, and I was about to tell them what I saw, but before I could my mom  called us for dinner. And I just have acted like I don't remeber anything, until a few days ago. I told my sister what happend and she said. " I saw that too but I was to scared to say anything." And after that we just stared at each other for about 5 minutes. Until I herd the door knocking  and when I opened it the mailman looked very recognizable. The same black, greesy, shaggy hair wearing a tank top with shorts. I fastly closed the door and bolted up stares in my sister's room. 



And I remember hearing knocking at the backdoor. The thing was saying my full name, where I went to school and who I am dating. And I herd  creaking up on the walls and I look outside on my sister's deck and there it is. Climbing my wall, and that's when my sister went down stares to get my grandpa's shot gun he had gave to my dad. And she handed it to me and I took a shot at it, but It didn't scream or shout it just looked at me and smiled and jumped down. I haven't left up stares yet only going down for 5 minutes to get food and water for me and my sister. My parents will Be back from there trip in 2 days I can't wait.
