“It’s time to go to bed.” I say with a sigh.
I look around my room, my eyes zigzagging from corner to corner. I open the door to my small closet, grabbing the loose chain to turn on the light and close the door. That small crack of light doesn’t seem bright enough, but it helps so I know the closet is empty. 

“Well… here goes.” I lay down, springs squeaking as I do. 
I’m falling asleep, my mind turning off all its lights but leaving on just one. Just in case. 

I awake to a sound, it came from the closet. I try to sit up, but I’m scared. My eyes steer over to the crack under the door. The light is still and calm. My eyes then move to a corner across from me. 

“Who… wh-who’s there?” I ask the shadow that reaches the ceiling.
I hear a creak in my headboard and instantly my eyes look upward, searching in fear for something out of place. Nothing is there. My eyes shoot back to the shadow in the corner, did he get closer?

Suddenly, it takes a step, I can feel the vibrations of the shadows movement. It gets closer. Closer. Closer. It’s getting difficult to breathe, I close my eyes tightly, hoping it goes away. Hoping the vibrations stop. I open my eyes, it’s morning. It’s time for me to go to school.

School is over, I get home and immediately write in my journal.

“Dear Journal,
I had a difficult time sleeping again last night. I don’t look forward to sleeping anymore. Not like I use to a year ago. This house seems to carry things that only want to hurt me. What am I suppose to do? My CAT exams are coming soon and all I seem to do is fall asleep in class.”

I closed my journal and tucked it in a drawer of my nightstand.
I wish I could get answers, but there is only ever more questions.. I guess I can ask my dad to check my room, in case I’m missing something.

“Dad?”

“Yes sweetie? How was school?” He asked with a smile.

“It was alright. A bit long.” I replied hastily wanting to get to my question.

“Are you sure you’re alright? You look tired. You sleeping ok?” My dad asked with worry.

“I’m fine dad, can you please check my room and my closet?”

“Hun, you’re 14, do I really need to do monster checks still?”

“Dad please, I don’t want to have to explain, can’t you just do it?” I asked with desperation and a hint of attitude.

“Sure thing, don’t worry.”
My dad gets up from his desk and goes to my room. I follow him, right behind him as to shield me in case anything attacks. Sorry dad.
He searches and he searches, nothing seems out of the ordinary to him.

“Everything checks out honey. No ghosts, skin walkers or monsters.” My dad says jokingly with some laughter. I give him a look that clearly shows I’m not amused.

“Alright well, try to get some sleep. Love ya kiddo.” My dad smiles at me and proceeds to leave, shutting the door mostly but leaving it cracked.

“Can you close the do- never mind, I’ll just do it.” I mutter knowing he didn’t hear me. I closed the door and got ready for my nightly routine.

I opened the closet door, turned on my light and proceeded to close the door behind me. My eyes search the room, making sure nothing is around, darting from corner to corner. I understand my dad checked, but it didn’t suffice. I then check under my bed with my flashlight. Knowing nothing seems out of the ordinary, I felt a little more comfortable knowing my dad searched as well. 

I lay down, trying to find a comfortable position. My breathing gets heavier as I fall into a deep sleep. I’m running down an endless stairwell, one that spirals and stretches into different directions. I’m constantly running, I feel scared, out of breath and desperate.

*KNOCK KNOCK*

My eyes are wide open, one is twitching on the bottom eyelid. My eyes shoot over to the crack under my closet door. I stare at it for what seems so long, my eyes never blinking, they begin to tear up due to the stinging.

A shadow moves in the light of the closet. It seems like two legs that are a little apart, making this shadow seem human. A faint breathing sound comes from inside the closet. Unable to keep my eyes open anymore  I quickly close them to stop the stinging sensation, a tear from each eye squeezing through. 

As I open my eyes, there it is. Sitting right on top of me, and as soon as I realize this, I can feel it dropping its weight onto my chest. It’s getting harder to breathe. The shadow leans into the moonlight, I can see its face. More like HER face. An old woman with rotted teeth, wrinkles that stream down her cheeks, across her forehead and by her eyes, she breathes on me. Her rancid breath took me aback, but also spewed fear into my very body. I can’t move, only shake in terror.

“I finally found you” a shriveled voice whispers to me with such eagerness.

All I could do was lay there, completely submissive to the voice and my own trepidation. *END*

What do you guys think? I could add on way more but wasn’t sure if I should. Should I make another part?
