I've only known Grace for as long as I've worked at the sandwich shop that's downtown, which isn't very long. I left university less than a month ago, having failed half my classes and dreading any single semester more. It was only my first year out of high school, and I didn't have a backup plan, so dropping out left me wandering aimlessly in the world. Grace was the one who got me to start at the shop. I'd met her through a mutual friend and had told her everything that was going on.

She's only a few years older than me and, funny enough, she fucked herself over a pretty similar way her first year of college. She kept talking about how it was at the shop and how working there put things into perspective. As soul sucking as it could be some days, it kept her out of the house and kept her from pit-falling into doing nothing. That's what pushed her to get her degree online instead. Now, I don't see myself going back to school, virtual or not, but I figured I had to start somewhere—had to go in \*some\* direction. With that, I gave in and she started training me just a few weeks ago.

I had known her in passing at the high school we both went to. She had a glow to her that could bring everyone out of their slums, and anyone would tell you how bright her energy was. She could fail college, work in a shitty sandwich shop and still make everyone's day with her kindness. For my first week at the shop, I had more fun working with her than I had been having in months up to that point. My house was on her way to the shop, so she always offered to give me rides to and from work—just was an all-around great coworker off the bat. As I got through most of the training, the initial thrill of having a new, fun coworker subsided and I settled into the boredom that the job entailed daily. I still had days where I was incredibly busy, so it wasn't all sickening, but as time went on it was getting slowly less bearable, something I didn't take kindly to.

I thought about quitting, and even told Grace I was thinking about exploring my options in the market earlier this week, and she actually responded in agreeance. You wouldn't expect the same person who hired you to hear you're thinking about quitting within the first two weeks. It's not like our job is unbearable or in any way mentally demanding, just plain uneventful. Nevertheless, Grace pointed out at least five other places with better pay and "better coworkers". When that came out of her mouth, I said,

"Are you joking? You're a great coworker! Don't talk about yourself like that..."

She didn't respond after that, but merely sighed and zoned out the window of the store. She was particularly distant the rest of that shift. We only talked a few different times, both being when I needed help with something. Our shift after, the one from last night, her distant behavior continued. Given what she'd said the day before, I feared the worst, that she felt like she'd be pestering me. I had no reason to know for sure that's what was going through her mind, but I didn't want to leave a stone unturned, so I went out of my way to bring it up to her.

"Hey, Grace?"

"Yeah?"

"You've been a little reserved lately... everything okay?"

"I don't know what you're talking about... just, please take the bread out??"

I tried not to read too much into it. I just did what I told, and didn't try talking to her again until later, this time not being as direct, just wanting to provoke conversation.

"Been slow today, hasn't it? Wasn't like this last Saturday"

That's all I ended up saying, because I didn't get a response for her. No words, and no expressions either. She looked through me as if I wasn't there and went back to doing prep for the night. At that point I wondered if I was only pushing her away, so I didn't say another word to her the entire night, not even when we closed. She had stopped showing me how. She did everything from the deposit to the alarm herself, as it I didn't even exist and she was closing alone for the night, not even checking in with me before she set the alarm, or before she got in her truck—she was supposed to be driving me home again for the night.

I got in her truck and strapped in like normal, and she took off without looking at me in the mirrors, what she'd usually do to talk to me during the drive to my place. I felt like I didn't belong where I was, completely out of element, the way here eyes bored solely through the windshield, never flicking for even a second in my direction. I couldn't put it out of my mind, to the point where I couldn't help but address it.

"Grace. We're almost to my place."

She knew we were. I didn't know why that was what came out of my mouth, just that I was wanting to say anything to illicit a response from her, but to no avail. No part of her body even twitched in response to me breaking the very much deafening silence around the space of her truck. I couldn't help wanting to snap out of my apparent paralysis to her existence, and this need only multiplied when she drove clean past my house.

"Grace! We passed my place, take me back!!", but she just looked ahead as she kept driving. My heart was beginning to thump in my chest. The oddity of her ignoring me and everything about me right to the very fact that I needed to get home too was leaving me disoriented and not knowing what to do.

"Fucking finally..." She said, flicking on her signal and tapping her brakes when her street approached. When she got to her house, she promptly parked her truck and got out, leaving me in the back.

"Where are you going?? Grace!! What the hell, get back in here and take me the fuck home, it's almost midnight and it's gonna rain soon!!" But she made her way into her house, and I could do nothing else but watch in shock, still in the back seat as she swung her front door behind her without looking back. I could see her drop her purse onto a couch in the front room of her house before fumbling with her key fob for buttons.

"Oh shit..." I said, quickly jerking on the right-side door handle to let myself out. I shot my hands at my own purse and slammed her door shut before the clicking of all the doors locking rang out. I didn't bother standing around any longer wondering what the hell was happening with her. I immediately turned around and headed for the direction we'd come from. I just wanted to go home. I walked a mere ten or so feet when I caught glimpse of a slab of wood sticking out of the edge of the backyard of Grace's house. I kept up the stepping at first, but stopped where I was when I realized the wood was at the head of a hole in the ground—a pretty damn deep one.

No rocket science was needed after just the first glance I got at it—it was dug in a rectangle, standard size... for a grave. All the questions I'd been blocking out of my mind to focus on getting home were suddenly meaningless, with a whole array of even bigger ones to replace them. I found myself, almost involuntarily, moving slowly towards the grave. Grace's strange behaviors had put me on edge for the night, a headspace where I was taking nothing lightly anymore, and I wanted nothing more than to see it up close—see if this entire night was just in my head or not. When I got close enough to see the slab in better detail, I made out the faint carving that was on it. I had to get almost inches away, but when I was able to make the letters out, I saw:

EMMA DOYLE

My first and last name, as clear as day even in the black of the night. I couldn't form any thoughts or expressions, let alone words to myself. I almost fell back into the bushes that lined the edge of her yard when I saw it, and I stumbled as I forced myself to start walking away. When I made it to the pavement of the sidewalk, the walking turned into running. I ran what felt like a mile, having enough adrenaline to run three if I had the chance, and it had started raining by the time I'd made it back to my house, where I should've already been to begin with in place of Grace's yard, where she had an empty grave marked with my fucking name.

I haven't slept a wink, and it's currently 4:08 AM. I'm supposed to start bright and early for a morning shift in less than two hours, but I can't even take a second to wrap that around my head. Any bit of thinking I do somehow leads me back to what I saw in Grace's yard. It has an iron grip on my mind and threatens to meld into it. I'm sharing this because I can't even form the words to call someone in the heat of the moment about what I just witnessed. The best I can do is slowly write this out as my hands shake from the straight shock. I don't even know how to respond to what I find myself in, whatever it means or will entail in the future. All I'm asking for is help. Is she going to kill me? Is she breaking down? Should I help her? Should I pack and run? What the hell should I do...
