Grandma came home last night.

I was ten when grandma had her stroke. The doctors were surprised she survived, and she spent the rest of her life in bed. Strangely enough, it was only just last year that she started to show some improvement. She was able to sit up, her speech was less slurred, and there was a light in her eyes that I hadn’t seen she got sick.

We live strange lives. We want to believe there is a purpose to it all; we want to believe things will work out in the end.  It is why we love stories; they are the little fantasies we tell ourselves to cope with the unbearable truth of reality. We lie to ourselves because if we admitted the truth, we would all commit suicide.

What is the truth? The truth is that good people can live good lives and still be punished. My grandma spent the last years of her life as an invalid lying in a stuffy room with a tube in her guts because the stroke took away her ability to eat. She had to lay in her own shit until someone changed her diaper, like a baby. She suffered indignities no one should have to suffer, but she went through them with a morbid optimism that baffled my parents. I understood, though. If you had to go through hell, you might as well go through it with a smile on your face, because it is going to suck either way.

My grandma wanted to watch me graduate from high school. I have no way of knowing, but I believed her health had started to improve because I graduate next year. Through sheer force of will she was determined to get stronger, strong enough to sit in a wheelchair and leave the house.

Grandma lived with us after the stroke. Grandpa died from a heart attack not long after I was born, and we could not afford to keep grandma in a home. I would sit with her and read aloud whatever book I was currently obsessed with so she could enjoy it with me. She couldn’t talk very well, barely more than slurred whispers, but I got to where I could understand most of it, and most of what she said was how proud she was of me. She said it tickled her to death that I loved to read and that I was so smart and how she wanted to be there when I finished school. It was almost an obsession with her, and though I knew I wasn’t as smart as she thought I was, I didn’t want to let her down.

So, I worked hard to get the best grades I could, for her, and somehow managed to pass with a high enough GPA to get accepted into college. Grandma cried when she saw my acceptance letter, and I cried with her. I remember that was when she told me that she was going to be at my graduation, even if she had to force my dad to carry her on his back.

I think it was the strain that she put on herself to get better that caused her second stroke. This time there was no luck, and she laid in the hospital for three days before she finally passed. Her left hand, already dead from the first stroke, was drawn up like a hook frozen against her chest. The rest of her face became as slack as the left side of her mouth was. Her eyes, eyes which had just gotten back that lively spark, became dead and glazed.

I broke down when I saw her in the hospital room after she passed; my dad sitting next to her and weeping openly; my mom by his side, her eyes misty as she held his hand.

I felt nothing when I returned home and entered her empty room. I would say I was numb, in shock, but in truth there is nothing which can describe the emptiness I felt as I sat next to her bed. On the little table where I kept books to read a battered copy of Stephen King’s *Skeleton Crew* sat open, page down. Grandma loved Stephen King; she was a regular Horror junkie, just like me.

I picked up the book and saw we were about to read the story *Survivor Type*. I started to read and as the story unfolded in my mind tears began to fall, wetting the pages in big salty splotches. I was weeping by the time I finished the story, though not because I felt sorry for the guy stuck on the island. I could care less about that guy, though I thought if grandma was here, she would have gotten a chuckle at the brutal way he died. She always had a morbid sense of humor.

I closed the book and laid it back on the table, then I noticed my father watching me from the doorway. We said nothing, he just walked to me, and I stood, and we held each other and cried. Mother, grandmother, friend; It does not matter what we called her, we both missed her deeply.

That night I lay in bed and tried my best not to think about grandma. I scrolled through Tiktok on my phone, watching one mindless video after another in hopes of losing myself in it, but always in the back of my mind the fact of grandma’s death waited, biding its time to pounce back to the forefront at a moment’s weakness. I fell asleep sometime after one in the morning, but it was fleeting and fitful and I awoke only a few hours later. It was then that I saw my grandma floating outside my window.

She was floating - my room was on the second floor - and I could see her sort of bobbing around in the air. She wore a white dress, and she looked like how I remembered her when I was a kid, before her first stroke. I forgot how beautiful she used to be, and my eyes welled with tears as she floated through the wall into my room. She landed on the floor with bare feet, and for the first time in almost a decade I saw my grandma walk.

She moved with ethereal grace towards me, and I sat up in bed and held out a hand to her. I was so overwhelmed with emotions that I was unable to speak. She smiled and reached out her own hand, taking mine. She felt soft and warm, though sort of watery like a loose skein of silk. She did not talk, I am still unsure if she was even able to, but she didn’t need to. I could feel her love for me radiating out and covering me like a blanket. I knew in that moment that it was okay, that though death may separate us for a time there is an afterwards, there is a forever in which we would meet again.

Then the coldness washed through, and I saw my grandma’s smile turn to fear. She stepped back and looked around, her curly hair whipping around her neck. I looked, too, and noticed that the shadows in my room were moving. They moved across the floor like water and surrounded my grandma, who stood with wide eyes, her hands pulled to her face in unbridled fear.

The shadows grew and piled up from the floor until they were towered over her. They swirled around formless for a moment, then shaped into five black figures standing around grandma. She looked from them to me, then mouthed a single word: Sorry.

The shadows moved as one to grab her, then lifted her above them. I could see grandma writhing in pain, her mouth contorting in soundless screams. The black figures collapsed to the ground like water and dragged grandma down into their blackness. The soft glow of her essence lingered above the blackness for a moment, then faded away. The shadows dissipated and I was alone in my room once more.

Death is not the end. I know that now, and I know that somewhere in the far reaches of reality there is a Hell. Somewhere within that Hell my grandma burns within black flames in an endless darkness, her existence nothing more than pain and anguish.

I do not know if there is a Heaven. I do not know if, when I die, the shadows will come for me. I pray that it isn’t so. I pray for Heaven; I pray for my grandma’s soul.

Does anybody hear me?
