It wasn't until the next day that the doctors were finally able to deliver the bad news: More than 60% of my entire cornea had been burned off in the accident. The doctor, in that calm slightly detached way doctors all somehow learn, informed me that the cornea had the highest concentration of nerve endings - which jived, as I was in completely unspeakable amounts of pain.

Sigh, oh, and blind. Totally blind. That calm detached voice seeming even more further away given it was all I knew about the doctor besides their name and gender.

For the first few hours afterward I thought about things that suddenly felt even more distant: reading a book, watching Netflix with a friend, I sometimes used to dabble in writing poetry. Heck, I was planning to get my learner's permit this summer and my folks had promised to buy me a cheap car to boot around town in...

Doctors said they really didn't know if I'd see again, that "future advances happen all the time," but deep down... I felt disconnected from the world. It wasn't so much loss as feeling like I'd been shoved through a door I didn't even know existed into another world. One I simply had no way to relate to, and as a result felt instantly isolated: I couldn't relate to the world, so how could the world relate to me? How could I matter?

\*\*\*

It should be noted, that my siblings really did do their best. While I knew my parents were in the ICU as well, and that they'd "be okay", my brother especially tried to spend his time going back and forth to keep everyone "updated". Not that there was much worth saying about me, after all.

Still blind? Yep.  
Still in pain? Yep.  
Wanna listen to Netflix? Fuck off.

Okay, I never told him to fuck off, but that sense of distance only increased after the doctor gave me The News. I could feel his need to go and talk to my parents, to be The Responsible One, a burden no 17-year-old should have to bear alone. I felt guilty wanting him, needing him, but ultimately he couldn't stay and I couldn't ask him.

"It's okay, I got her," I heard a stranger say. "Don't worry."

I could feel more than hear his anxiety shift as he stood, gave me a quick hug, and walked out. Before my dark mood could even begin to intrude, I felt someone gently hold my hand and simply start talking.

Her name was Jess. She had a husband named Clyde. They live a few blocks from us, though we'd never met. Clyde had fallen and it seemed very serious, but the x-rays had come back positive and doctors were feeling very optimistic. She didn't sound happy, but she didn't sound empty like I'm sure I did, either.

She told me she had long straight black hair, and "more wrinkles than an elephant". She describes chairs, curtain colors, which lights are flickering, and every person that passes through. While I can't really picture the room, I can picture parts of it. Sometimes she even makes up backstories for people like you see in those silly romcoms my tough football-playing brother loves so much.

A doctor comes, and the doctor lets me know they are getting a room ready for me, a private room. "A nice big room all to yourself," he says... As if the size of something I'll never see matters.

As I struggle to stand, trying to vaguely follow the voice as he's talking, a hand finds mine and guides me as much as follows my lead. Jess. The whole way, she just kept up her monologue:

"Lamp to your left, stairs to your right, a really ugly painting of a horse in a field, grumpy old man, now walk straight a bit, you got it baby.""

Once there, she helps me lie down. It takes time to find my spot, to get comfortable, to position things so I know where they are. Through the whole ordeal, there are two constants: my brother appearing and disappearing like some kind of perpetual boomerang, and Jess.

As everyone leaves and quiet settles in, she gently takes my hand again. Just holding, absently rubbing my knuckles a bit, she simply ... stayed. We talked... Well, she talked and I occasionally shrugged or gave a sensible chuckle. Not ready for happiness, but her stories of her and Clyde's first trip to Disney were just silly enough to make me feel less alone.

It was only a little bit later when she was interrupted by someone being rude. A small kid walking by asking in that loud voice kids sometimes use in public: "Why is she crying?!"

Even from the hallway, it was too loud.

Jess, calm as can be, stayed as patient with him as she'd been with me.

"She can't see, and she's sad about it."

"Oh," said the kid, "that's scary."

I can hear the kid settle into a chair somewhere close and he tells me he is here because he got a pea stuck up his nose. He laughs, Jess laughs, I smile. She tells me he's 6 years old and she's seen him around a few times. He likes Paw Patrol and ice cream. Mostly he likes cheese, but his mom won't let him have it on cereal.

As I hear another figure enter the room, she gives me the news: she has to go now, Clyde needs her.

"Don't worry," says the voice, adult and female, somewhere close to the kid, "I got her," as I feel another hand take mine gently. It didn't even occur to me until days later that there was no moment since I met Jess where my hand wasn't being held, even as one soul passed my hand to another.

"Don't worry baby, we can be together here, let me help you, you can do it" are the last words I hear from Jess as she leaves.

For hours this happens: strangers come and go, and every time someone has to leave ("my wife is calling" or "oh it's my turn finally") a new voice tells them not to worry, that they will take care of me, and my hand is passed from stranger to stranger with each new contact making the world feel just a little bit less lonely and isolating.

Each person does the same thing, almost like they planned it. They describe the room and people walking by, they tell me stories that aren't really that interesting; just random pieces of random memories not even fully explained. Fragments of fragments, but at the time it's all just a slow and gentle reminder I'm not alone.

I don't know why they keep coming, or how, but my best guess is that they see a young girl, scared, alone, and without any expectation of reward, we are part of each other's lives for a few minutes, exchanging fragments of our lives like tokens or pogs.

Not everyone even knew my story, they'd just pick up where the previous person left off, "Oh HGTV? I love HGTV though I hate open floor plans, what kind of plants do you like, the hospital seems to think the only kind is plastic - I get it, I mean, allergies, clean environment, but there has to be better plastic plants, right, I mean --"

\*\*\*

It isn't until hours later that I wake up and am somehow not surprised when my hand is being held.

"Jess?"

"Who is Jess? No, it's me gumball. The 'Rents are stable, doctors were right, all will be okay. How you doing? Sorry for leaving you alone." He sounds tired.

"Oh, Jess, that lady that walked me here from the ER?" I'm confused, as they were clearly around me at the same time on more than one occasion. For the next half hour, I tell him about Jess, Clyde, Drew (he thought a crow tattoo would be pretty cool), and even about the pea-in-nose kid.

I'm not that surprised he is confused, he probably hasn't slept in more than a day, but it's in that moment that I remember Jess's last words:

\*Don't worry baby, we can be here together, let me help you, you can do it\*...

\*\*\*

There are many dark moments in this world, I've learned. Many lonely moments. But I've it is in the moments of absolute pain, absolute loneliness that people find a way to connect with others who need connection. I don't remember them anymore, what is there to remember, after all. I never saw their faces, and their fragments of memories were so small they are lost to the sea of life.

While I never fully regain my sight, I can see brightness, colors, and even the vague outlines of shapes. Enough to take care of myself, allowing my brother to get his football scholarship, find love, and build a family.

But, every once in a while I'll wake up from a deep sleep with the sense my hand is being held and the whisper of \*it's okay baby\*...
