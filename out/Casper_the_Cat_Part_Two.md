[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dhkkaq/casper_the_cat/)


The pedophile’s corpse was as heavy as a tombstone. I panted hard, wiping sweat from my brow. Casper stretched out lazily on the carpet extending his claw. He yawned. I was so furious with him. “A little help?” I gasped as I heaved the body over to him. Casper lazily cleaned his huge paw with his long tongue. Casper’s unholy, golden eyes stared at me hard. 


I gulped. Those predator eyes were intense. Filled with danger. “You must earn your treats. Bring him closer.” That voice, charged with authority and yet so soft. The voice Casper forced into my mind was unpleasant. It was like someone coming into your home without wiping their feet. Or who refused to use coasters. Not a major transgression. It just felt rude. It felt unnatural. It’s sharp sibilance sounded like the feedback from a microphone. However, being able to communicate with my pet was a dream I’d had since I was a little girl. I scoffed angrily, “Sure thing, your majesty”. I grabbed the arms of the dead man hard. I grunted as I heaved him closer. I had killed the man myself. Of course, that was not how we’d planned it.


Many months have past since Casper and I began our vigilante crusade. At first, I was apprehensive and hesitant to be involved in, well, let’s not beat around the bush, *straight up murder*.  But after I did some research into the kinds of crimes perpetrated by these people on the sex offender list I became less squeamish. Also, Casper had this sense for evil. All he needed to do was look into someone’s eyes and he could tell everything bad or good they’d ever done. I asked him to never tell me what he saw in my eyes. I suppose I should be relieved when he replied, “Would never. Terribly boring.”


Another point to add was the very real benefit to helping Casper feed. I was in my late 30s and had had some mild medical issues recently. However, within the last few months I’ve not just lost weight I’ve gained muscle and bone mass. My asthma has gone. I no longer need glasses to see. Wrinkles have vanished and cellulite has receded all over my body. My hair and nails grew longer, tougher, lusher, and healthier. I was less anxious. Less depressed. My teeth were cavity free; my gums the perfect shade of red. All the doctors I’d been to since I adopted Casper said the same thing:  “Where can we get what you’re taking?” 


It wasn’t just my physical health though. Helping Casper with his dark deeds seemed to be granting me a kind of supernatural serendipity. Nothing huge, like I won’t win the lottery or anything (I already tried this). However, two weeks ago I found myself suddenly getting the contract for the new assistant-professor position at the university I’d always wanted. Also, I now always managed to get a string of green traffic lights when I was in a hurry. Little things like that.


By now we’ve dispatched more than twelve pedophiles but I still had not fully adjusted. Murder was hard work. Physically and emotionally. Ed Kemper was right.


At first it seemed easy enough. We would simply look them up online. Then after an assessment by Casper for their worthiness (and tastiness) we would set out in the dead of night. “You must assist. If not. No treats. Only assistants get treats” 
“Why? I mean, I know I’ll lose my,” I searched for the right word, “*benefits*. But can’t you do it all yourself? I mean if you really had to?” He was silent for a moment. He replied flatly, “Maybe. I prefer assistance.”

Our most recent victim, whose lifeless cadaver I now dragged through his own house, was an evil man named Jerimiah Funke. He wasn’t inside his house when we had stopped by that evening. This was rather unusual given that at three in the morning on a workday most people are normally in bed. With all the other victims I had walked up to the door and rang the bell or knocked. They always answered, especially after a few minutes of me bashing the door and pretending to be distraught. 


At first, I didn’t think I had it in me. But I was surprised by how quickly I took to deception.


“Oh, please help! My car has broken down! I’m all alone!” or some variation thereof would help me lure the man to my car where I would knock him over the head with my tire iron. Soon they’d be loaded in my trunk and Casper and I would make our way back home. “Why does it have to happen at home?” I had asked Casper one night. He remained silent. Once I was convinced he was ignoring me he said, “Tough. Tough to explain. It’s just more efficient. Home is safe. Life-force more absorbed”
  
“Okay, well I guess that makes sense as a magical law. Home is where the heart is.”
  
“Yes. Yes exactly. Our power is strongest at home.”
  
“Our? You mean, yours?”
  
“Your power. My power. One.” Gooseflesh spread up my arms and neck as he said this. What exactly had I gotten myself into?
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Jeremiah wasn’t like the others. As I had stepped away from his front door I heard something. I went to his tall garden wall to peer over the top. It was very dark but lately my eyes have gotten very keen. 
  


  
That’s when I saw him burying someone. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
On the ground near Jeremiah was what looked like the body of a small child tied up in a sack cloth bag. 
  


&#x200B;

  
The blood drained from my face.
  


&#x200B;

  
I couldn’t help it. I gasped. 
  


&#x200B;

  
Immediately, his head swiveled around and he looked right at me. His eyes were covered in shadow but I felt them on me. His gaze was hot, piercing and full of alarm. Then he was running for me. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
“Casper!” I yelled as I turned and sprinted back to the car. Before I could run four steps I heard Jeremiah’s gate slam open and felt a dirty hand grab me. “Agh! Let me go!” I screamed. “Nosy little bitch!”, he screamed and punched me in the head. I saw stars and collapsed. “Scream all you like no one will hear you out here!”, his old voice as rough as sandpaper. He began dragging me back to the house. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
My vision swam. “Casper!” I thought this time. Shouting it in my mind. I felt him. I could sense him nearby. He was there, hidden amongst the trees and bushes. Then I heard his words in my head, “You must fend for yourself sometime. Can’t save you every time. No fun that way. You’ll never learn.” I felt a coldness wash over me. In a heartbeat, an icy mixture of terror and fury filled me to the brim. “What? How coul-?” before I could yell anything else Jeremiah launched me through his open front door into his hallway. I spat a string of curses as I landed hard on the ground. Jeremiah reached forward and grabbed my hair. He dragged me across the floor into his office. With a yell of frustration, I managed to twist free from his grasp. I heard a large chunk of my hair rip from my sculp as I stood, leaning on the desk for support. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
That’s when I noticed the moonlight gleaming off of something. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
A large brass paperweight. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
With fury burning in my blood I grabbed the paperweight. A second later I brought it down on Jeremiah’s head as he turned to grab me again. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
There was a crack. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I had struck him hard on the cheek. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
He fell. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I didn’t let up. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
My arm came down on him. Again. And again. And again. My yells had turned primal. Feral. The paperweight was slippery now. The impacts satisfying; at first a cracking sound of metal on bone. This soon gave way to a more wet, squelchy sound.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I hit him again. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
And again. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I felt something I’d never felt. I felt something come lose in my mind. A horrible ancient rage set free. A strange pleasure flowed through me. A joy when it came to tearing. To killing. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
As the hate poured out of me, fury swallowing me whole, I plunged my thumbs deep into his eye-sockets. I ripped out his tongue with my bare hands. Rage dominated my will. I couldn’t stop! It was a bloodlust I’d never felt. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
When I came to, I was sitting on the office floor. As I looked down at my shaking arms I noticed a soft vermilion glow beneath the blood stains. Like I’d got a really bad spray tan. The glow faded quickly. Did I just hallucinate that? All of my wounds and scrapes were gone too. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I looked up. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
The man’s corpse was lying before me. My eyes were staring long and hard. His head was a ruined mess of pulpy flesh. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
But even then, it could still be seen clearly that parts of his face had been eaten. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Eaten by me. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I gagged. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  

  
I almost puked but managed to hold back. It was then that Casper appeared as if he had just stepped out of the shadows. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
He had finally stopped growing. But even so, in his domestic cat form he was twice the size of your average maine coon. However, in his true form, he was monstrous in his proportions. An enormous beast, more than twice the size of a Siberian tiger. His patterned fur was wilder now, less soft and bristlier. From his long bushy tail to his waist he resembled an oversized tabby cat, but from his chest up his fur grew wild, long and fluffy. He had the head of a gigantic Eurasian lynx, his ears massive, long, with a thin tuft of hair sprouting from his ear tips. As always, his eyes were yellow and glowing. He fixed me with a golden stare. It was different to his usual stern look. This was one of sympathy. “You did well. You continue to prove yourself.” 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I glared at him. My cheeks felt hot. Tears were forming in my eyes. I was really hurt. “Y-y-you just left me! Abandoned me! And what the hell is happening to me? Did I just eat that guy?” I yelled, tears falling freely now. Casper’s face fell. I had never seen him look so - ashamed.  “I had to test you. It is my way. But you lived. And you and I are bonding. My power becomes yours. Yours becomes mine”.  He walked up to me and tried to lick my ears. I pushed him away.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I don’t think he comprehends how wrong he had been to just abandon me like that. It reminded me a lot of my parents and sister. When they had turned their backs on me it’d hurt in just the same way. Was Casper no better than my family? Does he even really care about me? He didn’t even say he was sorry. “I guess that’s because he’s not sorry”, I thought. Casper’s principles are just more primal; wilder than those of the average human. He padded back up to me and began to nibble my nose. I couldn’t help but smile, much to my chagrin. Then I looked over at the body again. “What’re we going to do about him?” Casper stalked up to him. “Bring him to the living room”. So, I found myself hauling the corpse of an obese murderous pedophile through his office and into his living room. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
And so here we are. Casper lying still, doing nothing on the carpet. “So now what –“ before I had finished Casper had jumped to his feet and ran over to the corpse. He immediately started ripping it apart with his fangs and claws. “Ooooh, he is a tasty one. Very bad. Very, very bad.”
  
“Woah! A bit of a heads-up next time. And why the hell did I have to bring him here?”
  
“Better view” Casper said staring out of the living room window at the dark trees which stood in the nighttime air. The full moon was pale and bright. I felt anger rise in my chest once more, “What the hell, dude?”. He ignored me. Then I asked, “But I thought you had to eat them at home? Isn’t that why I’ve had to drag them into and out of my car most nights?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Casper looked at me with those golden eyes. His expression was one of exasperation, “I can eat anywhere. Ritual works best at home. He won’t give us much power.”
  
“And what should we do about the-“ I didn’t finish. Casper knew what I was referring to. “Her soul has moved on. We can do nothing to help her. The police will find her when they come looking for this one” his eyes briefly moved to glance at the half-eaten corpse.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Of course, our hunting trip that night had been a total disaster. When Casper said the ritual could not be fully complete did that mean my “benefits” would go away too? But we’ve been very good, surely one spoiled ritual isn’t the end of the world. I guess I had gotten cocky lately. Usually things went much more smoothly. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
After an average hunting trip, I would unload the body alone as Casper stared on in hungry anticipation. I would set up a tarp on the floor of the garden shed and lay the unconscious victim down. That’s when Casper would begin to change. I could hear his bones cracking and popping as they shifted under his skin. His muzzle elongated and his pained mews quickly became growls and soft roars which would soon echo through the shed. Casper would then let out a sound cross between a purr and a growl. It reminded me of those sweet meows he made in his smaller form that would fill me with pleasure and comfort. Instead these sounds filled me with nervous excitement, almost mania. 
  


&#x200B;

  
This sound was pure adrenaline. It was smelling salts on steroids. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
It would suddenly fill me with the strong urge to sprint into the garden or try every roller coaster at the fair. Invariably, the victim would awake. There was always a moment of confusion, then anger mixed with bewilderment, and finally, realization and terror. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Casper’s eyes would shine brighter and brighter as the evil men begged for their lives. Then Casper would begin to play with them. He would maul their sides, blood leaking over the floor. He would bite off their toes or fingers and watch them squirm. He even sometimes opened the door to let them run out just so he could chase them and immediately end their suffering. When he didn’t do this, it would take hours for him to finish them off. Then after he’d finally killed them he would take until dawn to eat their entire bodies. And he never wasted any food. “We’ve got to be more careful. You can’t just let some guy we’ve kidnapped, and are trying to eat, run into my backyard screaming! The police will be all over us.”
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
A few days went by after the night of the failed hunt and I was still very upset with Casper for abandoning me. We had not been hunting for a few days and I I hadn’t noticed any changes in my, let’s call them, physical improvements. It was at the same time I got a letter informing me I was getting a one-off bonus of two-thousand dollars from work. I was elated by the news and decided to use it to refurbish my very old and badly decorated bathroom. That’s when I realized I would have to find somewhere to stay for the week the refurbishments took place. I almost decided against the whole thing when I got tragic news in the form of a Facebook message. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
It was from my great-aunt. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
My great-uncle Henry had died.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Henry Carpenter and my great-aunt, Elizabeth Carpenter, were not really my aunt or uncle. I feel there’s this unspoken rule where if some people are close friends of your family that they are automatically “uncles” or “aunts” whether or not they are truly uncles or aunts. She had been one of the only “relatives” who had not completely cut me off after I had come out. It had been a while since we’d chatted so I decided to give her a call. She insisted that Casper and I stay at her house in the woods for the week and that way I’d also be around for the funeral.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Casper and I were still hardly speaking to each other as I packed up my bag. I was packing his litterbox into the trunk of my car when he sauntered up to me (in domestic cat form). “Must we go. Can’t we hunt? Now. I want to hunt now.” His words were harsher than normal. Impatient. “No,” I said coldly and turned away from him. Casper was quite petty. He was now more upset with me than ever that I’d dragged him away from home. He was sulking on the passenger seat as I drove.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
After two hours of icy silence we found ourselves far out in the country. We were surrounded by lush green New England forest. My great-aunt’s house was positioned right in the middle of nowhere. As I pulled into the long gravel driveway flanked by elms, I thought I saw something deep in the woods glint in the lamplights of my car. Were those eyes? I shook my head. No. My eyes were tired. Maybe all this murdering was getting to me. The black iron gates opened for me as I buzzed the intercom. Soon I was parked in the garage and stepped out of my green Toyota. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Elizabeth was a tiny woman with curly dark hair. She must have been in her 70s but she looked much younger. But I wasn’t surprised. She had been a fitness nut her whole life. Loved going for long walks in the woods. And all the time I’d known her I’d hardly seen her eat more than two or three mouthfuls of food at a time. Consequently, she was as thin as a rake. Normally she wore vibrant Summer colors and was very outgoing. She looked grim as she stepped through the door into the garage. Today she wore grey and black. But her face split into a wide, warm smile, “Hello! My dear, Julia! It’s been too long!” We hugged. “And where is the little fella?” she said, looking over my shoulder. I turned. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Casper was already gone. I was annoyed. How rude of him. Typical. I sighed, “Seems he’s made a break for it” I turned to look at the open garage door and into the dark woods. “He just doesn’t like being cooped up in the car so long. He’ll be back.”
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Elizabeth showed me inside and helped me with my bags. Henry had been an architect and had designed the house himself. It was made from mostly dark polished wood and large planes of glass. It got a lot of natural light and was very large; modern in its design. The house had two floors connected by staircases without railings. They had done well for themselves.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
The land owned by the Carpenters included, not just the house, but also a few acres of the woods through which Casper and I had driven earlier that day. I’d always hoped to inherit the property from them, even made a half-joke about it once. But I thought it was more likely the house would go to one of their actual relatives. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I walked up the steps and made my way to the guest bedroom. I’d been here a few times so I knew where everything was. After a quick shower I sat down to eat with my aunt. I think she took two bites of her excellent home-made lasagna and said she was full. Somethings never change.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
That night I did not sleep well. The conspicuous absence of Casper’s purrs unnerved me. And did I hear someone speaking? I sat up. My ears focused. I could hear the sound of soft murmuring. It was the voice of a woman. The sound was deep and repetitive. A chant? Was it coming from my aunt’s room? Just then, it stopped. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Oppressive silence pressed hard against my ears. 
  
A shiver ran down my spine as I laid back down. “Must be hearing things” I said quietly in a whisper to myself. I closed my eyes and tried to sleep.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
The next day was the funeral. In the early morning I’d experienced sleep paralysis for the first time since the incident with the intruder. It wasn’t as bad as it had been, but the fact it was coming back at all scared me. Was my eyesight worse today too? I really needed to hunt again. Soon. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I was getting ready for the funeral when I realized I’d not seen Casper all morning. Where had he gotten to? I closed my eyes and focused. After a moment I felt him. It was faint. He was not nearby. Somewhere far off in the woods. Where he was. Whatever he was doing. He was enjoying himself. I concentrated harder. He was catching something. Snatching something out of the air with his mouth and paws. Insects? I scrunched my nose in disgust. Gross. I broke our connection and continued to get dressed.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
The funeral was nothing special. Few guests came because my uncle and aunt were very old and most of their relatives and friends either lived too far away or were already dead. Besides my aunt, I hardly knew anyone else there. Again, the Carpenters were not blood relatives and we had not seen each other for many years. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
The funeral took place within a forest clearing near their home. As I stared over at the small frail figure that was my great-aunt I felt very sorry for her. She looked like she’d not slept in days. Dark circles rimmed her eyes as she sobbed during the burial. Once it was done I comforted her and walked back with her to the house. We chatted with some of the other guests  and had a late lunch. After that I had quite a lot of white wine we all told stories about my uncle.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
As the ruby red sun dipped beneath the canopy of the trees everyone said their goodbyes. The priest had a long chat with my aunt and was the last to leave. “I’m going to turn in” I said to my aunt, stifling a yawn. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
As I got upstairs I noticed that Casper was still not back. I would have normally been worried but I was still irritated with him. He was doing this on purpose. Punishing me in as petty a way as he can. Annoyed and saddened he had chosen to ignore me still, I got into my pajamas, brushed my teeth and collapsed into bed. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I woke to the sound of that same chanting. But it was louder. It seemed to resonate from everywhere. As my eyes flickered open, they took a brief moment to adjust to the absolute darkness in which I had awoken. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Why was it so dark? The moon should be burning brightly outside.
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Then the massive shadow behind my window moved. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Moonlight poured once again onto the ground. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I yelped and sat up, staring at the window. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
A white, flabby face with large eyes like glowing, grey discs of mist stared at me from outside. A clawed, skeletal hand suddenly pressed up against the window. As my brain tried to come to terms with my own horror I felt hot breath suddenly on the back of my neck. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I spun around. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
Two more those things were in my room! One was leaning on my bed! Reaching toward me with grimy clawed hands. 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
I screamed and leapt out of bed. I grabbed the baseball bat that leant against the wardrobe and brandished it at the creatures. “Stay the fuck back!” I screamed. The ghoul outside ripped the window open and leapt inside. But then remained eerily still. They were all so still now. Those horrible skeletal things. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Their bodies were skinny, their vertebrae sticking out visibly from their backs. And their faces! My God, they looked like they’d partially melted. Their eyes were all identical; grey and undulated slightly like fog. Their gaze was unblinking. Fixed on me. I didn’t waste time. “Elizabeth! Casper! Help! Elizabeth!” I screamed. All I heard in response was my own haggard breathing and that chanting. The chanting! I raced out of the room, hitting the ghoul standing in the doorway with all my strength. I hit it with such ferocity it flew through the air and hit the wall all the way at the back of the hallway. My eyebrows shot up into my hairline. I was shocked by my own strength. As I made my way to my aunt’s bedroom door I tried desperately to reach out to Casper. “Casper! Casper! Something really fucked up is going down! Need your help!” I yelled aloud and in my own thoughts. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then I felt him. Pain flooded my body. Hot and icy at the same time. I yelped and dropped the bat. Casper was hurt! Hurt badly! I could feel him. He was trapped. He was in a cage. A cage that burned him. Drained his power. I heard his voice in my head, weak and pleading, “Help. Julia. Help. Help.” As I broke the connection my aunt’s bedroom door flew open and she stood before me. She looked just as sad and tired as she’d looked before. But now there was a steely fire in her eyes. “Eliza-“ I began, but was struck hard in the head from behind. One of those things had knocked me forward and I fell into the room past my aunt. I sprawled onto the floor. As I looked up I saw a large chalk circle filled with odd symbols in the center of my aunt’s bedroom floor. “What? What the hell?” I said as I slowly began to stand. Something seized my neck and pushed me into the center of the white chalk circle. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I grunted with pain as I found myself on the floor once again. A spark of anger flickered to life within me and I sat up. “WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?” I yelled with such volume the room shook. I felt a power leave my body, infused in my words. The power was iron and chains. I felt my words wrap themselves around my aunt and those horrifying things. It reminded me of what Casper can sometimes do with his mews and roars. Infusing them with a kind of magic. 
  

  


&#x200B;

Elizabeth stood, her eyes wide at my sudden outburst. The creatures also seemed hesitant now, the three of them flanking her. She seemed to be struggling with her mouth. As if she didn’t want to move it, but it opened up anyway. “H-Henry f-f-found out about them first”, she squirmed and shook her head. But I had compelled her somehow, “At first we only asked for small things. They cleaned the house. Cleaned the dish-dishes. Repaired sh-shoes” her face was turning red as she fought against my enchantment. “Th-then we asked for money. For land. For more. And more. Soon we were in debt. We could not gi-give them the payment. So-so I gave them Henry. Now I’m giving them you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 She started crying. Her tears were genuine. “Needed to. Needed to get you here. To the house. Alone. And Casper. He’s no cat. We found out soon. Had to cage him. I can’t – can’t help myself. I do love you. That’s also why – it has to be – it has to be you! It has to be someone I care about! And I’ve already had to give up so much. So much! You have no idea! There is this deep desire in me now. I can’t stop.” Then she launched herself at me yelling with a mixture of frustration and sadness. That’s when I noticed she held a large silver dagger in her hand. 
  

  

  


&#x200B;

She plunged the knife into my shoulder before I could react. A cold pain spread from where the silver blade had sunk into me. I felt that same power I’d only just come to terms with start to drain from me. It was ebbing away, being pulled into the dagger. As blood poured from my wound and I cried in pain Elizabeth continued to chant in that odd deep voice that was not quite her own. Those words could not have possibly come from any human language. It was too alien. Too grating.
  

  


&#x200B;

The monsters began to shamble toward me on all fours. Saliva dripped from their now gaping mouths. Sharp, broken teeth lined their rotten gums. I felt myself turn cold. Felt darkness begin to build at the peripheries of my vision. Was this it? Was this how I died? A voice that was not just mine answered. “NO” came the resolute reply. It was both my voice and Casper’s combined. “NO!” It was firm and suddenly it filled my entire consciousness. “NO! I will not let this be the end of us.” Suddenly that same wild fury I’d felt that night at Jeremiah’s flowed back into me. It wasn’t as overwhelming as before but I felt a smile curl my lips.
  

  


&#x200B;

The monsters were very close now. The ritual must be reaching its climax. With a hand and arm that felt like they had been filled with cement I weakly reached up. I grabbed the handle of the silver dagger still embedded in my shoulder. I yelled as my hands burned. I saw steam blur my vision and felt blisters bloom all over my palm and fingers. But I did not stop. Wincing through the pain, I held on tight. I pulled at the dagger. I heard my aunt quicken the pace of her chants. I could tell she needed to finish it fast.
  

  


&#x200B;

Then I felt the ice-cold blade of the dagger leave my flesh. Instantly a white-hot fury and power I could not control flooded back into me. It was like the wall of a dam had just been brought down. I felt my eyes and skin glow vermilion and I snarled and pounced at my aunt. I brought the dagger down into her throat. Crimson pulsed from her neck rhythmically. I cackled with evil delight. 
  

  


&#x200B;

I drank her blood. 
  

  


&#x200B;

My wounds knitted themselves back together. My strength sky-rocketed.
  

  


&#x200B;

I stabbed her again. 
  

  


&#x200B;

Then I took her fingers in my mouth and ripped them off. I crunched them in my mouth and swallowed. My jaws inhumanly strong. 
  

  


&#x200B;

Then the fury ebbed slightly and I looked down at my aunt. The vermilion glow in my eyes and skin disappeared. She was quivering on the floor, tears pouring down her face. What had I done? I dropped the knife. “I’m-I’m sorry. Why-why did you have to do this!? WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS? I loved you so much! I-I’m so-” I yelled. Tears poured down my face as I watched the only woman who had ever stood up for me, die.
  

  


&#x200B;

The creatures had vanished as soon as my aunt died. They retreated like shadows do in response to light. 
  

  


&#x200B;

There one moment. Gone the next. 
  

  


&#x200B;

I hope that with the death of my aunt, and her ritual being therefore incomplete, this means they wouldn’t give me more trouble. As for Casper, he was fine now. I had found him downstairs in a basement I didn’t even know existed. I’d used our connection to find the hidden trap door. 
  

  


&#x200B;

When I found him, he was in his domestic cat form locked in a small silver cage. I gasped. He was badly injured. His fur was badly singed and he seemed to have open bleeding sores all over his body. Bald spots littered his body. He looked up at me weakly. His yellow eyes barely open. They did not shine as they should. “Help” I heard him say faintly. I rushed to find the bolt-cutters and immediately set him free. I pulled him gently from the cage and cradled him in my arms. Relief washed over me as I saw his eyes open. The golden glow steadily returning. “Silver. Bad” he said. “I know” I replied.
  

  


&#x200B;

“So, what happened?” I asked him as I cradled him in my arms. I was about to turn to walk back upstairs when he turned his head to look at the floor of the cage. I bent down. There, on the bottom of the cage, were the corpses of small humanoid creatures with wings. Some were pink in color while others were blue. They were too small for me to make out their finer features but they seemed quite androgynous. I wasn’t even surprised anymore. “So, I guess fairies exist too. What else? Werewolves? Vampires? Am I living in an episode of Supernatural?” I said. Casper just stared at me, a look of smug contentment on his furry face. “I was hunting them. Very fun to hunt. But they are horrible to eat. Their taste –“ he wrinkled his nose in disgust. “They lured me. The ghouls grabbed me and trapped me.” 
  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How did they know you were” I paused, “special?”
  
Casper shrugged. It was really weird to see a cat shrug. 
  
“Fairies, their magic too, is strong and mysterious. Their glamors were too good. I was completely” he thought for a moment, “blindsided.” I’d never heard him sound embarrassed before. “Don’t be too hard on yourself,” I said. “We were both fooled.”
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I am sorry” I heard Casper say as he ate the last remnants of my aunt. My eyebrows arched at this. “What for? I’m the one that killed her.” The dawn sun was now sparkling off the dew clinging to the treetops. The horror of the night had long abated. “No. I mean with Jerimiah. I do not regret my decision. You needed to learn. But I am sorry still. I do care for you” he said, his voice gentle. “And thank you. You saved me”. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mouth gaped. I was shocked. Casper had always been so wild and nonchalant when it came to human niceties. Maybe as I became more feral, he was becoming more human. I closed my mouth. Then I replied, “I guess that gives us each a point for rescuing the other. Let’s try to stick together in the future. If what you and my aunt have taught me recently it’s that this world is a far stranger and more dangerous a place than I could possibly have imagined”. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Casper and I cleaned up the house before I called the cops. I really hoped this didn’t turn into a regular thing. I really didn’t like cops. Anyway, I had called them that morning and they came right over. I told them that there had been a break-in and that someone had kidnapped my aunt. Took her out into the woods. The police failed to find any clues in the house (thanks to our thorough clean-up). But soon they would find the bones we’d purposefully left in the woods. They’d assume a wild animal had got her. And they wouldn’t be entirely wrong about that.
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Casper and I had to stay at a cheap motel for the rest of the week. Once the builders were gone and the bill was settled, I arrived home. I found a letter in my mailbox. Curious, I opened it to find it was from a lawyer. Turns out he represented the Carpenter’s estate, and that in the event of their death I was the sole heir. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had inherited everything. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They had left me everything. The house. The acres of land. 
  

  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I re-read the letter several times, my heart thumping loudly. I was shocked. They had never mentioned this to me. I fell back onto my comfy sofa as I got inside and stared dumbfounded at the letter. I felt very confused. I had always admired and loved my aunt. She was so kind and had treated me well. Then she had tried to kill me. And they’d left me their house? But why? “Had she really cared about me? She really just couldn’t help herself?” I said sadly. Casper jumped up onto the couch. He gave a quiet, warm mew and I felt my sadness abate slightly. He looked at me. “She was corrupted. It happens to all. Fairies are especially insidious.”
  
“Is it really any different to what we do? And how do you know so much about fairies? Are you a fairy?” I retorted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
He fixed me with an angry gaze. “No. We are different. We take evil. They take love. They take innocence. Fairies. Vile things. I am not one of them. There’s nothing like me but me.” “I guess you’re right,” I said as I placed the letter down on the table. I suddenly froze. “Wait. If I inherited the house then technically that’s our home too, right?” Casper nodded. A wicked grin found its way onto both our faces. “So, we could use it for our ritual instead of here? It’d be perfect! Out in the middle of nowhere!” Casper nodded too. I got the feeling he’d figured this out ages ago. “We already have” he said. 
  
“What do you mean?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
“You feasted on her flesh. You absorbed part of her spirit to fuel our power. I finished the rest. And we did so in our new home. The ritual was fully satisfied.” My eyes grew wide.
  
“Of course, the moment she died I would have become the rightful owner of the house.


I ran up to the mirror. Sure enough my skin was flawless. I hadn’t slept well at the motel but I looked well rested. I hadn’t noticed before with everything that had happened but I looked much younger than I had at the beginning of the week. Murder and cannibalism had its perks. I smiled. I reached for my laptop. “Looks like we’ve got some more hunting to plan”.
