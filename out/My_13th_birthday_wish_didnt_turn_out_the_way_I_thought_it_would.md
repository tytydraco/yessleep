The rain hammered down like it was trying to drown Brooklyn, but inside the kitchen, Luis was waging his own war. He sat at the table, hunched over his plate of bacon and eggs like a king surveying his crumbling kingdom. In front of him sat a small digital scale, its surface clean but worn from use. He carefully placed each strip of bacon on the scale, pausing to adjust their placement like the numbers might decide his fate.

“You wouldn’t understand,” he said, not looking up from his ritual. “Carbs are poison. Discipline—that’s what people like you don’t have.”

I didn’t bother responding. Luis was the kind of guy who loved the sound of his own voice. Watching him weigh his bacon like it was a lost treasure was surreal enough without trying to reason with him. I let his words hang in the air, sour and heavy, and slid out the door into the rain.

It wasn’t long before I ran into Gary. He was leaning against the chain-link fence that divided our yards, his arms resting casually over the top like he’d been waiting all day.

“You must be the new kid,” he said, his voice steady, unhurried. There was no smirk, no flash of teeth—just a calm, measured tone that didn’t demand attention but held it anyway.

“Harriet,” I replied, keeping my tone even. I didn’t know what to make of him—his confidence, his sharp eyes that seemed to read more than I wanted them to.

“You live with the keto king and the ghost lady,” he said, matter-of-fact, like it was common knowledge.

I frowned. “You know them?”

“Everyone around here does,” he said. He adjusted his stance slightly, leaning into the fence like it was the easiest thing in the world. “Luis likes to talk. June Linda… she’s different. But you—you’re different too.”

He said it like a fact, not a compliment. I didn’t answer. I didn’t like being sized up, not by him, not by anyone.

“You ever feel like you’re meant for something bigger?” he asked, out of nowhere. “Like there’s this pull, and you don’t know where it’s taking you, but you know you can’t ignore it?”

My hand instinctively went to the locket hidden under my shirt. It had been humming lately, almost imperceptibly, like it had a heartbeat. “Yeah,” I said finally. “I do.”

Gary’s eyes softened for just a moment, as though he understood something about me I hadn’t shared. “Well, when you figure out what it is, let me know. I’ve been chasing that feeling my whole life.”

The day after my thirteenth birthday, school was its usual miserable self. Turning thirteen should have felt more special, more momentous, but all I’d gotten was a half-hearted “happy birthday” from June Linda and Luis obsessing over his bacon. No one had made a big deal out of it—except the locket.

The locket had been warm, almost burning against my skin since the moment I’d turned thirteen, its hum growing louder like it knew something I didn’t. But I didn’t have time to think about that at school. I was “new,” which meant I had a target on my back. The teacher introduced me, and the class sized me up like wolves spotting fresh meat.

“She looks weird,” someone whispered.

“Bet she’s one of those freaks,” said another.

I kept my head down and slid into a seat. The whispers swirled around me, but I ignored them. What I couldn’t ignore was the sound of the classroom door creaking open.

Gary walked in, his jacket damp from the rain, and handed the teacher a note without a word. He took the only open seat—one desk away from me. The silence didn’t last.

“GAWWWWWDDAMN!” The shout came from the back of the room. “DAT MUTHA-FUCK-AHHH GOT SOME HUUUUUUUUUUUUGE ASS LIPS!”

The room exploded with laughter. Gary didn’t flinch. He didn’t blink. He just turned, slowly, and locked eyes with the kid who’d spoken. The laughter died off.

“You,” Gary said, his voice low and deliberate. “You got something to say about lips?”

The kid shifted uncomfortably but tried to hold his ground. “Yeah. They’re huge,” he said, though his voice wavered.

Gary stood up, dragging his chair with him, the sound of the metal legs against the floor slicing through the tension. He lifted the chair like it weighed nothing and crossed the room with quiet precision. The kid’s bravado evaporated.

“Here’s how it works,” Gary said, his tone calm but edged like a knife. “You mess with me, you mess with her. And I don’t play nice.”

With that, he slammed the chair down—not on the kid, but so close to his feet the floor shook. The kid jumped, pale, and the rest of the class went dead silent.

Gary leaned in closer, his eyes locked on the bully. “Got it?”

The kid nodded quickly, his eyes wide. Gary straightened, adjusting his jacket like nothing had happened, and walked back to his seat. I didn’t know whether to thank him or punch him for dragging me into his mess. Still, I couldn’t ignore the flicker of gratitude I felt.

The day got stranger from there. The locket’s hum grew louder, pulling at me. On my way home, it seemed to tug me toward the edge of town, like it had a will of its own. I followed its pull until I found myself at an abandoned library, a crumbling husk of a building surrounded by weeds and shadows. The air felt heavy, alive, like the place was breathing. I stepped inside.

That’s where I met Belis. He looked like he’d walked out of another era, his eyes dark and ancient. He didn’t bother with introductions.

“The Flameborn,” he said, his voice low and rough like gravel. “Your thirteenth year. It has begun, Harriet.”

He spoke of an ancient lineage of magic wielders, destroyed by shadowy creatures called The Ashen Ones. The locket, he said, was my inheritance—a tether to power and danger.

“There’s a prophecy,” Belis said. “A thirteenth year, a locket, and a choice. You’ll either unite the world or burn it to ash.”

I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t even know how to breathe. The locket’s hum turned into a roar, and the ember inside it flared. Shadows danced around us, and for a moment, I thought I saw something moving in them—watching.

When I stumbled home, I found Gary waiting on the steps of my porch. He didn’t say anything—he just looked at me, steady and unshaken.

“What?” I asked, my voice sharper than I meant it to be.

“You’ve got that look,” he said, his tone even. “Like you’ve seen something you’re not ready to deal with.”

I hesitated, the locket burning against my skin. “Maybe I have.”

Gary leaned back slightly, his hands in his pockets. “Well, whatever it is, you won’t deal with it alone.”

I wanted to tell him he had no idea what he was talking about. But I couldn’t. Somehow, I knew he’d end up in this with me, whether I wanted him to or not.

The locket flared again that night, waking me from a fitful sleep. I bolted upright, gasping, my room dimly lit by the ember’s unsettling glow. The shadows in the corners seemed to ripple, like they weren’t just shadows but something alive, watching, waiting.

That’s when I saw them—the figure cloaked in shadow, their eyes like twin embers, burning with otherworldly intensity. They stood impossibly still in the corner of my room, as though they’d been waiting for me to wake.

“Harriet,” they said, their voice resonating with a low, vibrating hum that rattled in my chest. “You’ve made the first step. But the fire has only just begun.”

I opened my mouth to speak, but no sound came out. My throat was dry, my heart pounding against my ribs. Then the figure tilted its head, as though listening to something I couldn’t hear.

“They’re already here,” the figure said, softer this time. “And they know.”

Before I could ask what that meant, the lights in my room flickered violently. The ember in the locket flared so brightly it burned hot against my skin, forcing me to clutch at the chain and yank it away from my chest.

The figure dissolved into the shadows, disappearing as if they’d never been there at all. But the room wasn’t empty. I could feel it—something else had taken their place, something bigger, heavier. The air grew thick, impossible to breathe, and the walls of my room seemed to close in.

I turned, and that’s when I saw it. Standing just outside my bedroom window, shrouded in the torrential rain, was something monstrous. It didn’t have a face, not exactly—only a mask-like swirl of shadows and gleaming, empty eyes that pierced through the storm. Its massive, clawed hand pressed against the glass, and when it opened its mouth—if it even had one—the screeching sound that came out shattered the window into a cascade of jagged shards.

The locket’s ember roared to life, spinning furiously in its casing like it was trying to escape. The creature lunged, its body folding unnaturally as it forced itself through the broken window. It moved faster than anything I’d ever seen, its claws slicing through the air as it reached for me.

For a heartbeat, time seemed to stop. The locket burned hotter, the ember inside flaring so brightly that it illuminated the entire room. Shadows contorted around me, the air thickening until it felt like drowning. And then, just as the creature’s claws brushed against my skin, everything around me—walls, shadows, even the rain itself—collapsed into utter darkness.

I didn’t know where I was. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t see. But I could feel the locket pulsing against my chest, its hum now deafening. The ember grew until it consumed my vision—until I was swallowed by flame.

And then, I heard it: a voice, low and guttural, speaking directly into my mind.

“It begins.”

And then the room turned dark and spun out of control. I reached down to grab the floor to hold it steady, but it grabbed me first. I smelled the scent of burning bacon and then I saw a black pool open up. It grew larger until it enveloped me. And then, I remembered no more until I awoke with a splitting headache in my bed and bacon grease on my fingers.

I'm writing this all down because I don't know what's going on or what will happen next. I need to talk to Gary. Maybe he'll know.
