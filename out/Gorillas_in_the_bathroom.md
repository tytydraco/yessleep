So I know the title sounds silly but this happened to me when I was young, when I was about 6 me and my mom were in my living room late at night she was reading and I was probably watching something on the tv , I had to go to the bathroom so I walked upstairs and used the bathroom with the lights off for some reason in the bathroom and the hallway, as I was walking through the hallway back down stairs no joke I hear the shower curtains sling open and two gorillas started coming after me I know that sounds stupid but in the moment i shit my pants , i ran downstairs and tried getting my moms attention and she was finishing a sentence in her book or something and by the time she looked up they had went into my room, all of our rooms are upstairs but yeah I forget what happened after that really except explaining to my mom what happened next thing I remember I woke up in her bed, so I figured it was just a weird dream.


 Skip to my junior year of highschool my mom comes into my room and asks me if I remember running down the stairs and freaking out telling her to look in the hallway bc gorillas were chasing me when I was little and just kinda laughing about it too but this sent chills down my body I guess I just vaulted it away and seriously thought it was a dream I still think about that till this day was I hallucinating or something? Or was it something else? Idk but it hasn’t happened since and nothing else freaky has ever happened since just thought id share this idk how scary it is but definitely messed me up when my mom confirmed it actually happened for me 

Also im gonna copy and paste the same story below bc I wanna hear your thoughts on my experience and I didn’t make the 500 word minimum sorry so ignore anything below (:
