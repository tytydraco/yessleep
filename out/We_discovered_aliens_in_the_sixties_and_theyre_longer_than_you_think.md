The United States government first found proof of extraterrestrial life in the 1960s. They weren’t floating discs harboring gray men with big brains, and they never crash landed on Earth despite what some failed military testing may have fooled you into believing. We have only observed them from afar. Four times they’ve appeared to us, only twice while I’ve been a part of researching them, and instead of adding new data about their behavior, biology, or origin, we are consistently left with more questions, and even greater concerns. 

On July 20th, 1969, American boots embedded humanity’s first footprints onto the moon. Literally an astronomical achievement, but it wasn’t the greatest scientific accomplishment planned for that day. Unbeknownst to Armstrong and Aldrin, Michael Collins, who remained in lunar orbit for their historic walk, would undergo the most confidential of top secret missions at that time. The United States government knew there would be no questions asked about Collins’ operations, as the world’s eyes would be transfixed on The Moon’s surface. He was tasked with manually releasing what was, at the time, revolutionary new technology back towards terrestrial airspace. Developed by an incredibly small team, in complete secrecy from their fellow astronomers and engineers, the mission was to successfully point a prototype version of what would eventually become the Hubble telescope towards the Soviets.

Decades ahead of its time, The E-WEBB Orbiter was designed to be the ultimate intelligence gathering tool. Once above red territory, it would have relayed visual information and radio transmissions to the states. Supply lines, troop placements, secret installations, Uncle Sam would have been relaxing and eating popcorn while it was all neatly placed into his lap. The few who were privy to its development knew it was a cold war-ending invention, and combined with the moon landing, would have ensured American hegemony for generations. Five and a half billion dollars of the Apollo program was secretly funneled towards its development, and its deployment was entrusted to the hands of Michael Collins and two engineers, undercover as ground control operators. 

Once in orbit, he would be given a codephrase by the ground team, signaling to him that it was time to undergo a space walk for “routine maintenance”. He would then make his way to a hidden hatch disguised as exterior plating. Next, he would employ a specially designed tool, thinner than a needle, yet stronger than the shuttle’s steel. He would prod the stylus into two unnoticeable holes dotting the module. The first acted as a release, dislodging the hatch’s lid, the second caused the E-WEBB to detonate a small gas canister, propelling itself from its sedentary state. The timing was crucial every step of the way. The window of opportunity was so unbelievably miniscule, each moment was calculated to the millisecond and rehearsed for months leading up to the launch. Yet, despite all of the impossible odds, the plan was executed to perfection.

The Orbiter successfully deployed, and Collins completed his “space walk” without anyone outside of the conspiracy growing suspicious. The celebration was shared between very few people, but those people celebrated more than anyone else on Earth that day. However, that gratification only lasted for six hours and nineteen minutes. At that time, less than three days from beginning its surveillance, the impossible happened. Debris, believed to have once belonged to a Sputnik module, collided with the E-WEBB. While it maintained its radio transmission, its visual and stabilizing functions had been broken, and it had begun to spin. 

It completed approximately three and a half rotations per hour, and was slowly drifting back to us. The two engineers on the ground notified command through codephrases, informing them of the dire situation. After deliberation, they were told to continue as planned. They transferred the receiving signal to their superiors, and cut off all of their own connections to cover their tracks. Michael Collins was left in the dark until reentry, believing the satellite emplacement was successful until he landed days later. Even when he was informed, he was only told it wasn’t successful, and that the burning debris was covered up as part of the Perseid meteor shower. However, he wasn’t told of the discovery the E-WEBB did make. 

I’m going to grossly simplify a lot of math for you, because I need you to understand the gravity of what the satellite found. It was rotating in a way that made it face towards, and then away from Earth. It oscillated between easily decipherable human signals, to the quiet vacuum of space. Quiet, but not silent. At that point, researchers knew radio waves emanated from deep space, forming cosmic background radiation, but this was irregular. Radio signals were received, lost and received again at the same point in the E-WEBB’s rotation, but with every turn, the feed seemed to get further away. And not at the same rate as the doomed satellite, but by a distance of lightyears. 

Something in the far reaches of our universe was giving off tremendous amounts of energy, and moving well above the speed of light, away from us, thankfully. By completely unbelievable chance, humanity’s first documented recording of alien life was received by American ears. They didn’t know it at the time, but their findings would become historical as the first encounter with what would be dubbed as the “Huludians”.

I know, Dune reference. Don’t get mad at me over a name I didn’t come up with. That was their colloquial title when I first started with the Collins Operation. As I’m sure you understand, spilling government confidentials from a very limited pool of people who hold said secrets, I’d like to keep my information and background as vague as possible. Just know that I transferred to the CO in the mid twenty tens. The Collins Operation is a codename for the government’s research on these extraterrestrials. We monitor astronomical activity across the nation, and have a small network of spies that keep tabs on our international competitors. The smaller size of our organization hinders our ability some, but because of the size of our team, and due to our relentlessly efficient counterintelligence, it’s believed we maintain sole knowledge of the Huludian’s existence.

They were given that name by Dr. Matthew Whitlinger, an avid science fiction reader, after viewing their second manifestation. Even we don’t have the exact date, that was scrubbed entirely, but at some point in 1995, the Hubble telescope sent The NASA Flight Center four pictures that the United States government did not want in the public eye. Special forces had intercepted, and redirected them to Washington. At that time, the Collins Operation was underfunded, scrutinized, and ridiculed. They were a niche laughing stock, most federal employees being unaware of their existence, and mocked by those that knew of them. However, when President Clinton himself marched into Dr. Whitlinger’s office, then acting head of the project, and demanded to know any information he could offer on the seized photos, their research tripled in size and ballooned in budget overnight, their secrets locked down tighter than anything they have in A-51. 

The pictures depicted a galaxy, similar to the famous “Pillars of Creation” photograph taken by the same telescope. Though it appeared like an orangish, shapeless cloud flanked by hundreds of tiny stars, it depicted a nebula, hundreds of thousands of lightyears across, framed by countless galaxies. Like many other Hubble images, it is truly spectacular, and I’m genuinely sorry you’ll never get to see them.

In the first image, there’s a spot in the lower right quadrant of the nebula. Pure black, giving it the appearance of a camera malfunction. The picture seemed to cease any display within the small, oval shaped blotch upon the cloud’s face. Moreover, from the ripples surrounding it, the shadow also appeared to disturb the surrounding space dust as well, stirring quadrillions of particles as if it were wading through a pond.

The second image answers a question one doesn’t know they have until they see it: Where is it going? It granted a better look at the shadow. It wasn’t getting bigger, rather, just appearing longer as it breached the surface of the nebula like an island rising from an infinite ocean. Its spindly body snaked across the galactic expanse from the first photo’s origin point of the lower right quadrant, to the upper left. Its shape and width remained roughly the same, not counting the end that had appeared first. It seemed to shape into three nearly imperceptible slits, betraying what looked to be the outline of an earthworm-esque mouth.

The third and fourth images displayed the anomaly’s disappearance back into the nebula, its “head” vanishing into the cloud in the third, its “tail” being the only visible part of the fourth. These photos were all taken between hour long intervals, painting a horrifying conclusion to the few researchers given access to these files. A worm, thousands of lightyears long, diving into and out of space dust like a whale feasting on an endless school of krill. A worm moving infinitely faster than what matter was understood as capable of. These images, what would become known as the Whitlinger Files, were connected with the E-WEBB’s findings from almost thirty years prior, and the Collins Operation was begun. 

I am very fortunate to have joined this group when I did. Technology across the entire field of astronomy has improved so much we border upon science fiction. Our forefathers in the field have made our job tremendously easier than what they had to contend with. The energy received by the E-WEBB was found to be a kind of unique radiation emitting from the Huludians themselves, similar to that of a supernova. It was named “Shai Radiation” in the two thousands to keep with the theme, and our job became monitoring the stars for any hint of it. 

Signals from deep space of any kind take hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years to reach us, so we essentially chase the echoes of whispers of ghosts throughout the stars, hoping the Huludian might still be where it was eons ago when we aim our telescopes towards them. Shai radiation frequencies have only been confirmed a handful of times during my tenure, and when we would finally image their sources, the results are consistently alarming. Nothing. Not just the absence of Huludians, but an absence of anything. Great voids spanning millions of lightyears, containing a mathematically impossible lack of material for the energy readings we had received. Something had been there, and something else had made it no more.

It wasn’t until two years into my employment that we photographed another Huludian. Our systems operated overnight, and had locked on to a massive reading of Shai Radiation emanating from the Cigar Galaxy, almost frying our computers with its intensity. Personnel were notified, and efforts began to document and view this occurrence immediately. Images of the cylindrical body flooded our screens, and after three days of nonstop viewing, a Huludian was imaged for the first time in twenty years.

Compared to the Whitlinger Files, these pictures were basically a video. Another black spot appeared from the center of the Cigar Galaxy. It emerged from the bottom, illuminated by the light of billions of stars, yet remaining blacker than the void framing images. It twisted through the cosmos, coiling along the middle of the body towards the top, before submerging back into the center. It vanished, baffling every one of us. A being of that size shouldn’t be able to disappear. We kept our sights trained on the galaxy for two years, and have maintained limited observation since. 

While we never captured the Cigar Huludian on camera again, our monitoring led to a discovery that has terrified me ever since. The light emanating from the Cigar Galaxy is dissipating. Its luminosity dwindles with each passing day. While my coworkers all discuss their theories about the topic, I believe I know the reasoning. The light appears to be dimming from its core, the last point the Huludian was seen entering. An animal needs to feed, and one of that size would need an impossible amount of sustenance. Even if it could digest stars, that wouldn’t venture even remotely close to its required intake. I believe the worm is consuming M82 X-1, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Cigar Galaxy. 

While that would be an ominous conclusion, it doesn’t matter anymore. Nothing does. The third imaging of a Huludian has removed any scientific curiosity I had, replacing it with mortal dread. One week ago, we picked up another signal of Shai Radiation, this time from the direction of Andromeda, our closest galactic neighbor. All of us knew what it meant, but some kept hope that it could have been a false reading, or perhaps that it was sourced from a distant galaxy far beyond Andromeda that was merely obscured. Reality proved worse than what any of us dared imagine.

It had become routine at that point. Aim all available telescopes toward the indicated direction and  take photographs. We expected to see the form of Andromeda take shape, perhaps with a black snake drifting through its tendrils. What we saw has left me speechless since. The first image to appear displayed a black orb, obscuring about twenty percent of the galaxy from view. Fifteen minutes later, a new picture. The orb grew. Another fifteen minutes, another picture, another portion of the galaxy blocked from view. Our heads spun attempting to decipher the information presented to us. My coworker, Dr. Belk seemed to place the pieces together before anyone else could. “Holy shit,” he stuttered, removing his glasses. “It’s coming towards us.”

That’s why I’m writing this now. My superiors will inevitably track this post to me, deny all of the information I’ve written here, and fire me, maybe even worse. The only reason I have for secrecy is the hope that I might get to see a clear picture of the god that careens towards us. But it doesn’t matter. A Huludian is headed for the Milky Way, and the only thing we can hope to do is wait. By our calculations, we have about two years before it breaches the outer arms of our cosmos. What will it do once it’s here? We haven’t the slightest clue. For all of the information we’ve gathered since the sixties, The Collins Operation can’t help. No one can. We’re not even prey. Our blue dot is a blood cell that will be flung from the carcass of our host as it’s torn apart. Maybe in ten years, perhaps thousands. Regardless, our fate is inevitable. A devourer approaches, and all we can do is behold its destruction.
