So...

My mom just died.

Well, not ‘just’ just, but, like, a month ago, and these past few hours, my life has completely unraveled.

She went out for a walk, and according to a doctor I talked to at the hospital, she experienced something called an aneurysm, fell down, and was effectively dead before she even hit the ground. There was no pain, no fear, nothing, people told me, but now, I’m not 100% sure I’m okay with that.

But let me start at the beginning.

I had a happy childhood, all in all.

Loving parents, friends, everything, but something changed when I was seventeen.

I was in a small accident, nothing too major, but I ended up in the hospital, where I found out that my blood type didn’t match either of my supposed parents.

Like, completely different.

Both of them have B; I have AB, which means they can’t be my biological parents.

The realization hit me, and while I tried to rationalize it, I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me.

Mom noticed almost immediately, and after a bit of prodding, I finally confided in her.

She was shocked, to say the least, then admitted that I had been adopted as a young child but that both she and her husband saw me as nothing but their own miracle.

Honestly, I don’t think I took it well. At least, for a time.

I felt this strange distance between us, which made me lash out at them, but Mom and Dad gave me space and time until I came around on my own.

They were still my mom and dad after all, right?

Things returned to normal, at least for a while.

School was a great distraction, as were my hobbies, but slowly, I began questioning everything about myself.

How much of what I liked was influenced by my adoptive parents?

Who was I, after all?

If my bio-mom hadn’t wanted me... did that mean I was a mistake?

I would have loved to go back to normal with my parents, to let things be, but I just couldn’t.

After a particularly bad week, I asked Mom about the adoption, but she told me that it was a closed one and that my bio-mom wanted no contact with me.

That almost sent me spiraling completely.

I don’t know... I blamed myself, even though I knew it couldn’t be my fault, but it really felt like everything around me was crumbling.

Mom tried to calm me down, but I just couldn’t let it go.

I cried and begged her for more information, but every time I brought it up, she tried to change the topic...

At night, when I couldn’t sleep, I heard my parents arguing in their bedroom.

Hushed voices, sometimes crying as well...

We were breaking apart, I thought, and I think Mom felt it too.

A bit over a week after the first outburst, she and Dad sat me down and filled in the gaps as best they could.

I asked about which agency had facilitated the adoption.

There was none.

No.

According to Mom, their finding me was a gift from God.

They had always wanted to have children, but it just wasn’t meant to be.

Fertility problems and the like...

They visited every doctor they could find until, one day, one of them took her aside and straight up told her that giving birth wasn’t in the cards for her.

The news destroyed her and Dad.

Then, not even a month later, while she was out shopping in a city an hour from here, she met a homeless woman, addicted to drugs and obviously unable to take care of herself. She was out begging with a baby in her arms, and that sight broke my mom’s heart again.

Wanting to help her, she offered her money and a place to stay, but it was clear to her that the woman wouldn’t manage it all on her own.

So she made a deal with her.

She would support her in getting clean, and while she was in rehab, my now mom and dad would take care of me.

Apparently, the woman did get better, at least a bit, but as she saw how great Mom and Dad were with me and how much healthier and happier I looked, she didn’t have it in her to take me back.

She saw that they could provide a life for me, she never could... So she asked my parents to take care of me and bid them farewell, making them promise to keep her existence a secret from me, since she felt too much shame to ever face me.

My mom was crying at that point, hugging me and apologizing over and over, and I simply broke down.

I was relieved, to be honest. My bio-mom had loved me, even more than I could have imagined. She had given me up to save me...

We hugged and cried for hours, and for the first time in months, I felt like I belonged again...

Well...

When Mom died and I came back for the funeral, I found my dad in a bad state. He was drinking, something he had never done before, and I extended my stay to help him through the difficult times.

It was hard seeing him like this. Barely dressed, unshaven, stashing alcohol around the house.

It was pitiful, and I thought I should do something to cheer him up.

I told him that I wanted to find my bio-mom to tell her about the amazing woman she had left me with. How much my life had changed, and how great it had been because my mom was there for not just her but me as well.

Dad scoffed, and I felt this strange gnawing feeling in my chest as I heard him.

It wasn’t a noise I had expected, not one somebody would make if they simply didn’t like an idea... no. It sounded dismissive, disgusted...

I asked him why, but he pulled back and just took another big sip straight from the bottle of vodka.

This, I really couldn’t let go.

I asked him what Mom, up in heaven, would think of the way he was behaving right now, and he laughed, then cried, then sank to the floor.

“We’re all going to hell anyway,” he mumbled, as I pulled the bottle from his grasp and helped him to the couch.

He was saying other stuff, but his speech was so slurred, I couldn’t really make out what he was trying to say...

What I definitely heard was the name of the city. The one Mom had visited when she had met the homeless woman.

This strange feeling came over me.

Maybe I should have just stopped there. Let sleeping dogs lie.

But I couldn’t.

I made sure Dad was resting on the couch with a bucket next to him and a glass of water on the table, then headed up to my old room, where my laptop stood.

It took me two hours before I found something.

I had to go through hundreds of pages and search prompts, year by year, month by month, until I stumbled upon a website someone had put up seventeen years ago.

The first thing I saw was a giant picture of a baby.

**Have you seen me?**

In bold letters underneath.

Then a family picture.

A mom, a dad, and the same baby.

Happy, smiling...

Next is a video.

It’s of a woman begging, with tears in her eyes, to give her back her little baby boy.

I’ve watched it a few times, and every time my heart wants to break.

She’s begging, pleading, and even bargaining.

I guess no one ever helped her.

Below, there’s her story and another video.

The first time I read it, I thought I might throw up.

The woman was out with her husband, shopping, when her baby started crying.

Not wanting to bother the other customers, the father took the baby to walk around the parking lot and calm him down, while the mother stayed inside the shop.

This is where the video starts.

You can see the parking lot and the man holding a screaming baby slowly walking past the row of cars.

The whole scene looks so normal, so calm.

At least until a new woman appears.

She has darker hair, her head is pointed away from the camera, and she abruptly stops and stares at the man with the baby.

My heart sank as I saw it.

The way she moved was so familiar.

Suddenly, she starts speeding up her steps, and the man sees her, but he doesn’t react at all.

He just smiles and tries to say something, but the woman completely ignores him.

I don’t think he realized what was about to happen.

Not until it was too late.

She runs the last few steps as if she wants to tackle him, then reaches out as the man lets out a shriek.

You can see her hands grabbing hold of the baby as the man struggles, then she kicks him and rips the child out of his hands.

There’s pandemonium.

The man reaches out, grabs her coat, and suddenly, the woman starts screaming.

“Help! Help!”

People are looking over at them.

“He wants to steal my baby!”

The man, kneeling and holding onto her, looks up at her, and for a moment, you can see the woman’s face from the side.

I threw up.

The voice, the face...

It’s Mom.

She kicks him again as people race toward them and tackle the man to the ground.

Now he’s screaming too, but three guys are holding him down and punching him, while the woman with the baby runs away.

The video cuts out there.

It took the real mother of the child to come out for people to realize what had happened, but the other woman had already disappeared.

The creator of the page writes about how the police have been useless and plastered that single still image of the side of the woman’s face all over the website, begging people to help her find either the woman or the baby.

There’s one last video.

A short plea by the mother directed at the dark-haired woman I called Mom for seventeen years.

“Please give him back or let me know he’s okay.”

I had to stop for an hour, then looked through the website to find my real mother’s name.

Mary-Anne.

She had a blog, linked to the site, and reading it broke me.

The despair, the loneliness, the shame.

Her husband, my real father, killed himself two years after my disappearance.

He blamed himself, and I guess he couldn’t live with the guilt anymore.

My real mother kept going on her own.

For fifteen years, she kept looking and kept the site alive.

Posting it and linking to it wherever she could.

There are hundreds of links to it, but none of them helped.

Half a year ago, she posted one last message.

**I can’t do this anymore. I am sorry.**

**To my husband, I failed you.**

**To my child, if you should ever read this... I am so, so sorry.**

**To the woman who took you, let me say this:**

**I hope hell exists and that one day I will find you there.**

**There is no justice in this world.**

Her obituary is 4 months old at this point.

She gave up...



What do I do now?

My parents are dead. Killed by grief and hopelessness.

The one who’s ultimately responsible died as well. Peacefully.

Only one person left is sleeping drunk off his ass on the couch downstairs...
