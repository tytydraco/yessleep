The Letters He Left

I  hadn’t touched the attic in over a year—not since Andy died. The dusty boxes and forgotten holiday decorations sat like relics of a former life, one that had ended in a flash of twisted metal and shattered glass on a rain-slicked highway. Everyone said it was an accident. The police. The doctors. Even the insurance investigators. I believed them—because I had to. Because otherwise, I’d fall apart.
But grief has a strange way of boiling beneath the surface, and it finally erupted on a damp 

It was a Sunday afternoon. And I couldn't take the silence anymore. I climbed into the attic looking for something—anything—to feel close to him  again.
That’s when I found the box.

It’s plain, unmarked, and it was tucked behind an old suitcase. Inside were twelve envelopes, neatly stacked, one for each month leading up to his death. They were addressed in his handwriting: 

To Hales—Read only after I'm gone.

My heart pounded as I held the first letter, dated exactly a year before the accident.

July

Hales,If you’re reading this, it means I didn’t make it. I don’t know when or how, but I’ve felt something coming. Not fate. Not God. Something else. Something human. Someone.
I love you, forever - Andy

I stopped reading. Tears stung my eyes as they fell down my cheeks. I felt sick. I opened the next envelope.

August

Hales, I know it sounds paranoid, but things are happening—things I can’t explain. The brake lines on my car were tampered with. I thought I was being silly, but now I’m sure. And there’s this man... I’ve seen him twice, watching the house from across the street.
I love you, forever. - Andy 

The letters became more detailed. Photographs were enclosed. Notes scribbled in margins. Andy had been investigating something—or someone. He mentioned strange calls, locked files at his job in the city archives, and people he thought were following him. He never told me any of it. He had protected me.

Then came December’s letter.

December

Hales, I think I’ve found out who it is. His name is Marcus Bell. He’s tied to a land deal—corrupt city officials, forged deeds, and a cover-up buried decades ago. I found records in the archives. I copied them. They won’t kill me over this. They’ll make it look like an accident. Please, if I’m gone, find the USB taped under my desk drawer. And don’t trust anyone—not even the ones who seem to care.
I love you, forever. - Andy 

I ran to his old writing desk, a piece of furniture I hadn’t been able to move. My fingers fumbled under the drawer until I found the edge of a tiny USB drive, still stuck there with old duct tape.
I plugged it into my laptop. Documents. Photos. Scanned files. All of it damning.
And a final video.

Andy, speaking directly to the camera: I’m scared. But if something happens to me, I need you to be strong. I love you, forever. Now go finish what I started.

Within weeks, I had gone from grieving widow to reluctant investigator. The files Andy collected led to a journalist willing to help, and eventually to an explosive story that implicated Marcus Bell—a local developer and political donor—in a decades-long land fraud scheme. Bell was arrested, and new investigations rippled through city hall.

But for me, the justice felt cold.

One evening, a package arrived. No return address. Inside was a single envelope with no note. Just one photograph: Andy, standing on a city street corner. Taken the day before he died.

In the background, partially obscured by a lamppost, was a man in a black coat.
I had never seen him before.
I have the feeling I’m not done reading letters.
One showed up on my doorstep today. Addressed to me. 

Weird things have started happening to me as well. Things that aren’t coincidental. I just wanted someone, anyone, to know. If I die, it’s not an accident. 

Someone is knocking on the door. Should be my friend. 

Whatever happens, 
I love you Andy, forever
