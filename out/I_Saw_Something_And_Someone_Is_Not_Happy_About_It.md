I don’t usually post online. My life’s boring, predictable, and most days I don’t have much to say. But tonight… if I don’t write this down, I’m going to lose my mind.

If you know what’s happening to me, please DM. Please.

I was excited for a weekend getaway but this turned into something I wouldn’t have dreamt in my worst nightmares. For me, the best getaway is always a long bike ride. No fancy resorts, no flights, no parties. Just me, my bike, and the road. The plan was simple: ride out to visit my grandparents in their village, about 600 km away. I had been planning this for weeks. A good stretch of highway, music in my ears, fresh wind in my face—it felt like I could breathe again after months of being stuck in routine.

The ride was perfect. Smooth, bright afternoon. I had my playlist blasting, I was singing along, cruising. I hadn’t felt this free in years.

And then came the detour.

I had checked the route the night before. No construction, no closures. But somewhere near the last hundred kilometers, I saw the barricades. The main route was closed.

Disappointed, I pulled over near a tiny tea stall just off the highway.

It was one of those roadside setups: a wooden cart, a few chipped glasses stacked carelessly, and an old man serving steaming tea from a dented kettle. Beside it sat two other men smoking, their eyes darting toward the dark stretch of road that disappeared into the forest.

I parked my bike, pulled off my helmet, and ordered tea.

That’s when I heard it.

One of the men said:

“—it happened again. A young couple, gone. The bike was found abandoned. Police have been searching for a week.”

The other man whispered something back, but I couldn’t hear.

At first I brushed it off. Villagers love their stories. Every highway has its accident tales, its ghost stories. I sipped the scalding tea, scrolling through my phone to check maps for alternate routes.

Then I saw the flashing lights.

A police van screamed past us, siren tearing through the calm evening. It sped straight down the forest route.

The old man serving tea muttered under his breath, “Not again.”

My stomach knotted.

But I reminded myself: my grandparents were expecting me. I’d told them I’d reach before dinner. So I shoved the unease down, strapped on my helmet, and drove into the forest road.

The detour was a nightmare.

No streetlights. The road was pitted with craters and loose gravel. My headlight carved a thin cone through the darkness, illuminating tree roots clawing across the edges of the asphalt.

I turned up the music to drown out the paranoia. But it didn’t work. My helmet trapped the sound of my own breath, shallow and uneven.

Ten minutes in, I saw red lights ahead. A line of vehicles idled, brake lights glowing. Something was blocking the road.

I slowed and pulled closer. The unmistakable blue-and-red flash of police vans cut through the trees. They had erected makeshift barricades — sheets of plywood propped up, covering something from view.

A cop waved at drivers to keep moving. No stopping. No questions.

But I needed to know.

“Brother,” I asked a man walking past me, clearly leaving the scene, “what happened?”

He didn’t even pause. His face was pale, lips dry.

“They pulled them out of the pond,” he said. “The missing couple. Don’t look. Just don’t.”

And he walked away.

But of course I looked.

Through a gap in the plywood wall, I caught glimpses: a motorcycle, its paint stripped and rusted like it had been underwater for years. Ropes tightening, pulling shapes from the pond. The silhouettes of two bodies dragged across mud.

I should have driven off.

Instead, I edged closer.

Through another gap, I saw them clearly.

My stomach lurched.

They were naked, skin bloated and blackened as if their veins had burst and leaked into the flesh. Their faces were swollen beyond recognition. And across their bodies, painted in thick white strokes, were symbols. Circles intersected with jagged lines, strange marks on their foreheads, chests, thighs.

The smell hit next — sour, rotten, wet.

I gagged inside my helmet, stumbled back, and nearly dropped my bike.

A policeman shouted, “Move ahead!” His voice cracked like a whip.

I fled.

I drove as fast as I could. Potholes, speed bumps, ditches — none of it mattered. I needed distance between me and that pond.

When I finally slowed, relief trickled in. I even switched the music back on to calm my nerves.

That’s when I heard it again.

The siren.

Growing louder.

My chest tightened. I looked ahead.

The same barricade. The same flashing lights. The same cop waving traffic forward.

I froze. 

This wasn’t possible. I had left that place behind. Maybe it’s *déjà vu*.

But there it was… again.

And then — the same man. The one who had walked past me earlier. He walked past again, same expression, same dry lips, same words but they were addressing someone else behind me:

“They pulled them out of the pond. Don’t look. Just don’t.”

I felt faint.

I ripped off my helmet. Sweat poured down my face despite the winter air. My ears rang, my skull throbbed.

I stumbled off the bike, clutching the handlebar for balance.

The last thing I saw before collapsing was the same sight through the barricade gap: the couple, bloated and dripping, dragged across mud, only this time they were looking at me. 

When I opened my eyes, I wasn’t on the road.

I was sitting at the tea stall again. The empty glass of tea rested on the cart. My bike was parked where I’d left it. The two men were still smoking. The forest road still loomed ahead.

I don’t remember how I got there.

But I knew one thing: I couldn’t ride that road again.

I found a small temple near the highway. White paint peeling from the walls, a single oil lamp flickering by the entrance. I told the priest my bike had broken down and he let me rest inside.

I called my grandparents, lied that I’d be home in the morning.

Now I’m sitting cross-legged on the cold floor, typing this out.

I can still hear faint sirens in the distance.

I don’t know if I actually lived through what I saw, or if I was dreaming.

But if anyone knows about this place, about the symbols painted on those bodies — please DM me.

Because I’m scared that if I close my eyes tonight, I’ll wake up on that road again.
