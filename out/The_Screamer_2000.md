To whomever this may help,

I am contacting all of you today to inform you of the defects that my most recent purchase; The Screamer 2000, is exhibiting. I hope you all can learn from my mistakes. 

In the past, I have purchased many products from a company called Everlasting Impressions and have always been more than happy with their quality. So, when I noticed the new “adult section-” on the website, I just couldn’t resist; I had to see what they were offering. 

While scrolling through the abundance of pleasure pets, I came across The Screamer 2000, and my interest was instantly piqued due to its enticing description:

*Are you wanting to drown out the sad echoes of your lonely life? Do you want to fill the air with screams of pleasure? Do you need to spice up your sex life? Well, do we have the perfect solution for you! The Screamer 2000 is guaranteed to give your Vulvarine the superpowers she deserves. Take back your sexuality and your smile today!*

When the device arrived three days later in a discreet little package wrapped in silk, I knew I had made the perfect choice. 

You see, my husband Brad and I have recently been struggling with our sex life. He just feels so cold towards me, and my body isn't reacting as well to his touch as it once did. I figured The Screamer 2000 would give us the spicy edge we were lacking. And it did.. for a little while. 

The first night we used it was like nothing I had ever experienced before in my life. His member was ready as ever the moment he saw me, but that was never our problem. We started slow, as I tried to warm his icebox of a heart with some sweet kisses down his neck, moving ever so slowly to his juicy meat pop. I swore I heard his heart beating fast for just a split second, and I knew it was time to bring out my new toy. 

With the first setting in place I delicately pushed it towards me as I stared into my husband’s frosty blue eyes; he looked surprised as his mouth hung slightly open. The pleasure hit me like a strong wave, blanketing me in pure ecstasy as I sunk deeper into the abyss. My husband began to perspire rapidly, and I knew we had ignited the fire in our relationship once again. 

About a week after my purchase, I started to notice a pinching feeling down in my cave of wonders. I ran to the bathroom and quickly grabbed my handheld mirror. While laying down I threw my legs high into the air and leaned forward while hovering the mirror in front of my delicate flower. 

Teeth. My little lady had begun to grow teeth. I gasped in shock at this new revelation. How did this happen? Did my new smile require any special care? Do I need another toothbrush? I sat up and shrugged, afterall, the vagina was a powerful organ. Why shouldn’t it have teeth? 

Everything seemed to be going just fine, until my Penis Flytrap started to exhibit a strange new anomaly; she was… hungry. I could feel her growl in anticipation every time I was near my husband and it began to frighten me. I couldn't let her hurt him. 

I would try and *feed* her to satiate her growing appetite. But nothing seemed to do the trick. Being a vegetarian, I assumed Lady V would be a vagitarian. I tried a cucumber, a carrot, even a squash; ouch! I could still hear her growl in anger after each bite. That's when I shakily pulled out the sausage link. 

I could feel Lady V begin to salivate as I brought it closer to her opening. With a violent thrust of my hips, she devoured the whole link it one swift bite, finishing her meal with a soft queef to show her satisfaction. I shuddered. 

To be honest, her love of meat terrified me. How was I supposed to keep this a secret from my dear Brad now? I couldn’t possibly put him at risk for my own personal gain, could I? Was I becoming the monster I feared? 

For the next few days, I would feed my Mound before introducing her to Brad’s shaft. It was scary each time I let her get a whiff of his aroma. I was sure Brad would notice something strange the minute I didn’t hop right on, but thankfully men are oblivious as long as their knob is being slobbed. After a few successful encounters though, I decided to try the real thing. 

I filled her with steak just before, and thankfully, since she was full, she had no want or need to hurt my husband. I was finally able to reach my much needed climax, but part of me still felt like I was turning into someone else; something else, and it scared me. 

Yesterday, while taking the ride of my life on my husband’s pleasure pole, I decided to reach for The Screamer 2000 to bring my orgasm to the next level. Big mistake. The second I brought the silicone serpent down towards my nether regions, Lady V roared to life and chomped down voraciously onto my husband’s Womb Broom. 

I tried desperately to get her to detach, but ended up with another orgasm as I rocked my body back and forth. It was terrifying and exhilarating all at the same time. Then, I looked down, noticed the stream of blood, and passed out. 

When I came to, I instantly reached for Brad in hopes that he was okay. Still laying in the same position I had left him, he appeared to be in shock. I slowly brought my eyes down to his groin as the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach began to grow. Rumpleforskin was no more. 

This is the reason for my letter. Due to the fact that The Screamer 2000 did not come with adequate instructions to accompany it’s clear malfunction, I have now lost the one thing that brought me joy since my husband’s fatal heart attack a few months back. Given the fact that he no longer has function of his frozen hands, or any part of his body for that matter, this is an extreme set back for me. I am now forced to take Brad out of the freezer, bury him, and find a new hubby. 

I contacted the company and requested that they take back this awful device, and refund me all of my money so Lady V and I do not have to go through this traumatic event ever again, as we search for a new suitor. I am thankful my husband didn’t feel anything, but the next one might not be so lucky. 

Please do not take this warning lightly and use extreme caution when purchasing any toys online during this lonely time. 

Sincerely, 
Madam Grace
