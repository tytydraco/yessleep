My friends and I have been visiting lake eve since we were in middle school. We would ride our bikes down the wooden trail that led through the trees past the parking lot of our school. We lived in a small town so we have been friends since kindergarten, attending the same k-12 school our whole lives. There have been legends of lake eve passed down for generations, some claim that theres a monster who lives in the woods, who would rip older children from their family’s and pull them down to the bottom of the green murky water. Others claim tales of a loch ness monster type creature pulling mischievous children into the water to feed its children. A lot of people in the town just think its eerie, maybe its haunted by the town that used to be beneath it before the damn broke and flooded all of the settlers out, way back in the 1800’s. Some of them didn’t believe it would truly take the whole town, so when the majority of the town fled, stubborn settlers stayed and lost their lives to the ruthless waters. 

My friends and I didn’t believe in the supernatural, at least not back then. So we would spend our afternoons building forts in the trees, looking for cool rocks and creatures by the water. We would find frogs and salamanders, build little houses for them with sticks and rocks and then release them and get cleaned up before we rode back home. 

In our freshman year, our parents got together to get us each a four wheeler to take on our adventures. James Alex and I would ride them to school instead of our bikes. Then after school we would take them down to the lake and drive around in the field across the woods. We would do donuts and wheelies, we tore up the sand and the grass around the water. Nobody really came out to lake eve because of the rumors, there were a few missing persons cases in the town, all presumably taken by the “creature of eve”. At least thats what the towns people would say, and the kids at school. 

So lake Eve was our personal spot, we could do whatever we wanted. Winter was approaching quickly now as we were almost halfway through the school year. The lake would freeze over soon enough, we were anticipating how thrilling it was going to be to be able to driver across the ice. We would have a lot more room to do donuts and drive around like idiots. Our parents wanted us to wait until the ice was thick enough for my dad to drive his truck across it, he did a lot of ice fishing so he knew when it would he safe for us to get out there. 

Finally in late December the ice was thick enough to drive across. My dad came home later that day, he brought in his tape measure and pointed to the number 18. “Ice is about 18 inches deep Max, if you and the boys wanted to go out it would be perfect for it” I was so excited I called up Alex and James and we hopped on our 4 wheelers and headed down to lake eve. 

We headed out on the ice, something about driving over the frozen water was exhilarating. We promised our parents we would be careful, so we weren’t doing our usual stupid male antics. We were cautious, we didn’t drive too fast, and we weren’t doing our usual jumps or donuts. The snow had piled up in places, we would go up over the snow and back onto the ice, we drove around the perimeter of the lake, it was solid ice across the whole top, that I remember clearly. 

I was starting to get more comfortable and I picked up speed, I was zig zagging across the middle of the lake when I heard a loud popping crack. My heart sank down to my stomach as I felt cold water enter my boot. My four wheeler had stopped completely and started going under the water. I tried to jump off but my foot was stuck. I heard the screams of Alex and James, I looked over to see pure terror on their faces as I sank below the water. Something was pulling me down. 

I was freezing, the water sent a shocking cold blast down my body, it burned as I held my breath and desperately tried to swim back up. I looked down to see my four wheeler sinking to the bottom of the lake, my thoughts were racing “get out, get out” and then I heard my name I thought it was Alex, or James calling to me. But the sound was coming from beneath me “Max, down here Max, join us” I was finally making my way towards the water line, I reached my hands up and tried desperately to find the opening in the ice, but I couldn’t find it. It all looked the same to me, there was no light seeping down, my body was stiffening due to the cold, and I was starting to feel warmer which sent shivers down my spine, this was it for me I thought, this can’t be happening how is this possible. 

I looked down, and thats when I saw it, or her. It was a sickly pale almost greenish white humanoid figure, except it wasn’t human, it had long skinny limbs, long legs kicked beneath it, propelling it closer towards me. It was coming closer, up through the darkness that encased the bottom of the lake. Its overly stretched out limbs were covered in dark green algae, stringing around its body. It was completely naked aside from the algae covering it. My vision was starting to blur, I thought I was hallucinating, how long had I been down here?  

The worst part of the creature was its face, it had no nose, just a gaping black hole where it should have been, it had nasty muck covered gills protruding from the side of its neck, opening and closing to let water in. It had a sickening smile, with dark lips wrapped around a elongated mouth that smiled at me with a set of insanely sharp teeth. Its eyes are burned into my memory for the rest of my life, they haunt my dreams and stare back at me each time I close my eyes. They were huge, comically large, they were a deep black, soul less. It reached its boney hand up towards me, covered in algae, I could now see it had pieces of bone sticky out of its almost scaly looking flesh. thats when it opened its mouth, I saw it had 5 rows of those wickedly sharp teeth going back towards its throat. It spoke it a way that looked painful “Oh max, I have been waiting for you” it pushed its way towards me and smiled that gut wrenching smile I had sank back down at the sight of her, I couldn’t believe my eyes I was in shock. 

I quickly swam back up and I banged on the ice, it was too thick, I couldn’t break it. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a hand reaching down into the water, and I heard the muffled cries of Alex, I swam toward his hand and I reached out for it. I heard a shrieking scream come from to woman under the water, I looked down and she was right behind me, I grabbed Alex’s hand and I pulled myself up. I felt her hands on my legs and she pulled me back down, she was screaming, her mouth wide open, I kicked down as hard as I could despite being in the icy cold water, she bit down on my foot and I felt the sharp teeth penetrating my boot, I pulled my leg out of her mouth and launched myself up out of the water, the crisp cold air bit at my skin as I lay on the ice next to the jagged hole I had fallen through. 

Alex pulled me farther away from the water as I spit the cold liquid from my lungs. James had already called the police and I could hear the ambulance sirens getting closer. He had his head in his hands as our parents pulled up and ran towards us. I was picked up and put into the back of the ambulance they warmed me up and took me to the nearest hospital. 

My parents tagged along in the ambulance, my mother was yelling at my father as I came in and out of consciousness. I awoke the next day, I had minor injuries, I didn’t spend much time under the water, although it had felt like hours. The doctors told me I was going to be just fine, and could be discharged soon. I didn’t know if I should tell my parents about the woman I saw down there, I didn’t know if I should tell anyone. They might lock me up, or think that the cold water ruined my brain. 

When I got to go home my parents were no longer upset at each other. My dad was confused, and they kept asking what had happened. When I explained that the ice had just pulled me under, they had looks of uncertainty on their faces. I think they thought I had caused it somehow, maybe by jumping, or acting recklessly. I didn’t know, but we were all just grateful I made it out alive. 

Alex and James came over to spend the night, it was a Friday so we were planning to hang out at my house for the weekend. Their parents had sold the 4 wheelers almost as soon as they heard about what had happened to me. Obviously I couldn’t get back on mine considering it now resided at the bottom of the lake. I don’t think any of us wanted to get back on them anyway. I hooked up my xbox when the boys got there. They had this look on their faces I can’t describe, almost petrified, but curious. James spoke first “did you see what grabbed you?!” I jerked back to look at him, almost astonished at his question. “You saw it” i asked. Alex and James both shook their heads. “We saw everything, it reached up out of the ice and pulled you under” Alex chimed in “We watched its hand wrap around your leg” I sat there, in shock as the visuals of whatever that was came back into my mind. I told them everything that happened. 

We sat there, all in shock. We never went back to lake eve, and we contemplated all of the stories we had heard. Maybe those missing people were at the bottom of the lake, I was almost one of them. I still have nightmares, I still think about how it knew my name, and how long it had been watching me, watching us. The scars it left on my ankle are a constant reminder of what could have happened to me. I know deep down it would have shredded me to pieces.
