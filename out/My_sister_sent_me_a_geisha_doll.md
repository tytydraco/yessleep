I got a package from sister that came from Japan, and I’m fairly certain I’m being haunted by some sort of ghost. I never believed in the paranormal before, but seeing something has been happening since it arrived at my apartment. My sister sent me a vintage Japanese geisha doll as a souvenir on her vacation trip. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t collect dolls, nor do I collect old things. My sister knows that I’m not a huge fan of dolls in any shape or form. I’m terrified of life size baby dolls, thanks to a certain B-horror movie with a possessed doll. 

Let me be frank; I *tried* to get rid that weird vintage Japanese geisha doll with a passion of hatred. My sister loves pranking me, in her words I’m too easy. Which doesn’t give me much confidence, my sister travels a lot, mostly because she works for the airlines, and whenever she lands in another country, she sends me weird objects she comes across. 

And although she currently on vacation in Japan, this is the first thing I’ve received from her in the last three weeks. The only reason why I think this doll is haunted is because of the fucking weird things that has been happening, including trying to get rid of the damn thing. 

My name is Remi, I’m twenty-seven years old, and I don’t have some fancy degree, just a high school diploma, and I work at a gas station on an overnight shift. I’m not some special case person, just ordinary.

 Three weeks ago, my sister went on vacation to Japan, she sent me a package with a vintage Japanese geisha doll that is from a rural village that I can’t even spell or pronounce the name of. 

Anyone else who loves dolls or vintage things would drool over something like this, unfortunately I am neither of those. My grandparents used to own a vintage store with creepy objects that my grandma used to tell stories of haunted objects and since then I have had an aversion to vintage things. 

Whether those tales were true or not, as a kid, it stuck on me like super glue. And dolls, I don’t really have to explain, one B-horror movie with possessed dolls is all the explanation I can give. And since I had gotten a that doll, weird things started to happen to me, and I can’t quite explain them logically. 

I’ll start with the first day I received the doll, when I saw the familiar brown package, with my name and address and sender was my sister’s name. I knew I was going to have to shove it I the hallway closet after opening it, as I said my sister sends me creepy souvenirs from places she’s been. 

I know its her way of showing her love for me, but I’ve told her several times to stop, at this point, I started wondering if everything else was haunted too. I brought the package into my apartment, setting it on my kitchen table and pulling my pocketknife out and using the knife to cut the tape to open the box. 

As I pried the top of the package open, a whiff of aged lacquer and mothballs slipped out, and nestled in a cocoon of yellowing tissue was the geisha doll itself—delicate, painted face frozen in a polite smile, kimono patterned with faded cherry blossoms. The second I touched it, a chill swept through the apartment, raising the hairs on my arms. 

It wasn’t just a draft; it felt as if invisible fingers traced down my neck, and the air grew thick, heavy with something unnameable. I set the doll on the table, half-expecting its glassy eyes to blink. The room stayed cold, an unnatural cold that seeped into my bones, as if the doll had brought a piece of some distant, haunted winter right into the heart of my home. I tried to shrug it off, but I couldn’t help but glance over my shoulder, suddenly sure that I wasn’t alone in my own apartment.

I called my sister, after the third ring she finally answered with a tired voice. “Very funny, why did you send me this creepy thing?” 

She laughed, a sharp and amused sound, and told me I was being dramatic. “Oh, come on, Remi, it’s cute,” she insisted, “You worry too much.” Ignoring my protest, I pressed her for details—how much did she actually pay for this thing? There was a pause, then she said, “Honestly? I didn’t pay anything. I found it abandoned, tucked away in this old, crumbling temple in the village I was touring. It looked so lonely I thought I’d give it a new home.”

The line crackled with static as she continued, “I even asked this old Japanese lady about it. She just smiled and said it was an old doll, nothing special. I asked if I could keep it, and she shrugged, said it was okay, said it seemed to be… kind.” She laughed again, lighter this time, “So technically, you now have a kind ghost. Consider it a lucky charm, or, you know, your own personal guardian spirit.”

I groaned, “Knock it off, seriously. I don’t want any ghosts, kind or not.”

She was about to reply when, clear as day, I heard footsteps echo through my empty apartment—the unmistakable creak of wood, slow and deliberate, coming from the hallway. 

My heart seized in my chest. “Did you hear that?” I whispered, my voice thin and shaky. There was only silence at the other end, then my sister’s laughter faded, replaced by a static and a sudden, chilling quiet. I stared at the doll on the table, its polite smile now seeming deeper, almost knowing, as the footsteps drew closer toward the kitchen.

My heart was hammering in my chest, as I looked at the screen on my phone when I noticed that the phone call had ended and the bars on the top of the screen said no signal. Shakily I called out to whatever was walking towards me, “hello?” 

My voice sounded too loud in the thick quiet, bouncing off the walls in a way that made me flinch. The footsteps stopped as abruptly as they’d started. I pressed myself back against the kitchen counter, my phone clutched in my fist, watching the shadowed hallway beyond the kitchen door. Nothing moved. I let out a shaky breath and tried to laugh at myself, but the sound died before it left my throat.

The doll sat unmoving on the table, its painted smile unchanged, but the air felt charged, as if waiting for something else to happen. Every instinct in me screamed to put the thing away, lock it somewhere, anywhere, but I couldn’t make myself move. Instead, I waited, heart pounding, until the silence became unbearable.

Eventually, I forced myself forward, grabbed the doll with trembling hands, and shoved it into the hallway closet beneath a stack of old coats. The cold seemed to follow, lingering around the closet door. I muttered a curse—half at my sister, half at myself for being so jumpy—and paced back to the kitchen. 

My phone still showed “no signal.” I tried opening the window, letting in the humid night, hoping the ordinary sounds of passing cars and distant sirens would settle the knot in my stomach.

But the apartment felt different now, as if the doll’s presence had shifted something only, I could sense. I made myself some coffee, extra strong, and drank it standing by the window. 

Ten minutes passed. The signal flickered back. I called my sister, but it went straight to voicemail. I left a message, trying to sound casual: “Hey, call me back when you get this. And next time, seriously, just send me a T-shirt or some candy, okay?”

That night at work, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the doll was thinking about me. Every time the automatic doors hissed open and closed, I braced myself for another chill, another sign.

 And when I finally dragged myself home in the bleary light of morning and had my keys in my hand and froze when I could faintly hear the tv in my apartment on. I ran through my memory if I had the tv on before I left, but I kept coming back to that I didn’t. 

I got into my apartment and there, as plain as day, my TV was on—some drama show flickering beneath the hum of the early morning light. But what made my breath freeze and my blood turn to ice was the sight of the geisha doll, no longer hidden in the closet, but standing upright on the coffee table, perfectly centered, its painted gaze fixed on the screen.

For a long, impossible second, I could do nothing but stare. Then, all the fear and tension I’d been swallowing since the night before erupted at once, and I’ll admit it now: I screamed. Not a cool, movie-hero yell, not a dignified gasp, but a full-throated, childhood-terror shriek that echoed against the walls. My hands shook so badly I nearly dropped my keys.

The absurdity of the doll, the TV, the stillness—made me doubt everything. Was I losing it? Was this some elaborate prank? I edged forward, every step deliberate, my heart pounding so loud I could barely hear the TV. The doll’s face was unchanged, but now, with the blue-white light of the screen flickering over its features, it seemed more alive, more attentive, as if it was enjoying the story as much as any guest might.

I lunged for the remote and turned the TV off, half-expecting the doll to move, to protest. But it stayed perfectly still. I swallowed, my breath ragged. “Okay,” I muttered, voice trembling, “very funny.” But the silence that followed was empty and absolute.

The screen of my TV flicked back on, I used the remote to turn it off, but again it turned back on, and once again I turned it off. Suddenly I felt a force that yanked the remote out of my hand to the floor and the TV flicked back on. I threw my hands up, trembling at what was happening. “Okay, okay.” I went to my room and locked the door, not like that would save me from whatever this was. 

Another time, a week later on Wednesday, my debit card was charged with two hundred dollars. That is to say, someone had hacked into my account and bought an entire merch from some drama show that I’ve never heard of. 

I was on the phone with customer service for two hours to dispute the charges, but then found out there was another exact charge with the exact merch, and when I got home that geisha doll still on the coffee table with its painted gaze and smile still on the TV on and when my eye caught a scene that was playing it hit me. I pointed my finger at the doll. 

*“You!”* I growled. “You ordered that crap on my card don’t you dare deny it!” and then hysterically laughed that I was now blaming some doll for the hacking on my card. But the proof was undeniable. 

I can’t believe I was seriously starting to think some doll had the power to order stuff with my debit card, I was seriously starting to lose it. The rational part of my brain screamed for me to get a grip—this was technology, a data breach, some scammer halfway across the world, not a vintage Japanese geisha doll with painted lips and lacquered hair. 

But as much as I wanted to dismiss it, as much as I wanted to laugh at myself, there was no denying the chill that crawled across my skin every time I caught the doll’s eyes, the eerie coincidence of the merch, the show, the timing, all of it.

I paced the living room, casting nervous glances at the coffee table, half-expecting the doll to blink, to turn its head, to do anything but sit there and watch. Sleep felt impossible, sanity a fragile thing. 

I grabbed my phone, changed every password I could think of, locked my card, then sat on the floor hugging my knees, waiting for the sun to set and make everything ordinary again. And all the while, the TV played on, and the geisha doll sat serenely, as if it owned the room, as if it was only just beginning.

A few days later, I swear my sanity was being tested, when I was walking up the stairs to my floor, Mrs. Millar, an elderly woman that lived right below me caught me on the stairs, she looked slightly annoyed for some reason. “Remi, are you redecorating your apartment?”
 
I hesitated, and turned to her, “no,” I said worried that damn geisha doll was doing while I was working all night. “Why?” 

She pursed her lips, arms folded, and gave me a long, appraising look. “Well, whatever you’re up to, just—please, not after midnight, all right? The walls are thin, dear. I need my rest.”

I nodded, forcing an apologetic smile. “Of course, Mrs. Millar. I’m sorry—it won’t happen again.”

She seemed mollified, but as she shuffled away, I felt a fresh wave of dread wash over me. I hadn’t moved a single piece of furniture—not that week, not at all. But I could hardly tell her the truth, that while I was out, something else might have been responsible for the late-night noises drifting through the floorboards.

As I climbed the last steps to my apartment, my palms slick with sweat, I tried to convince myself it was all coincidence—old buildings groan, pipes rattle, neighbors mishear. But when I opened my door and found the armchair facing the coffee table, angled as if for a better view of the TV, I knew what I’d see before I saw it: the geisha doll, perched on the table, serene and inscrutable, the flicker from the screen painted across its cheeks.

I closed the door quietly behind me and leaned against it, pulse hammering. “You’re not real,” I whispered. But the doll’s unblinking gaze offered no reassurance. “You can’t be.” Something in me snapped, perhaps lack of sleep fogged up all my rationality.

I stormed my living room and grabbed the remote off the table and shut the TV off and stood in front of the doll. “How dare you! This is my home, I was trying to ignore it, maybe I’m going insane,” I laughed hysterically. “But enough is enough! My neighbors are complaining, I’m broke because of that huge purchase, I rent this place, I pay the bills not you!”

The silence after my outburst rang out sharp and absolute. I stood, wild-eyed, panting in the hush, the remote still gripped white-knuckled in my hand. The shadows in the corners deepened, as though the room itself was holding its breath, waiting for my next move—or the doll’s.

My heart thudded on, defiant, as I circled the coffee table, studying the perfect stillness of the geisha’s painted face. The thin line of her lips, the delicate arch of her brows, the high gloss of her lacquered hair: nothing changed, not a twitch, not a flutter. 

Yet I couldn’t shake the certainty that she was waiting for something, some cue only she would recognize.
“Do you hear me?” I demanded, my voice wavering between a plea and a threat. “You’re not welcome here. Whatever game this is—stop.”

No answer, just the distant hum of the fridge and the rising sun glow bleeding between the blinds. I rubbed my eyes, exhaustion pressing hot and heavy on my skull, and wondered if I’d finally broken the barrier between ordinary and madness.

But then, in the hush, I caught a faint sound—a creak, the slightest rasp, like a whisper of silk on wood. I whirled, scanning the apartment: nothing moved, nothing out of place. Only the doll, poised and perfect, her expression unreadable in the gloom.

I took a slow breath, steadied myself. Maybe it was time to get rid of her, once and for all. Tomorrow, I promised myself, she was going in a box, or the trash, or wherever haunted antiques went to die. But for now, there was nothing to do but wait out, eyes wide open, spine prickling with the feeling that every shadow might be watching.

And as I finally collapsed onto the couch, the geisha doll’s gaze seemed to follow, glassy and eternal, a silent challenge. Sleep, if I could find it, would not come easy.

When I finally drifted into a fitful sleep, it felt more like blacking out than resting. I woke late, sunlight already slanting thick and yellow through the blinds, my head throbbing dully from exhaustion and a day spent wrestling the edge of dreams.

It was supposed to be my day off—no alarms, no obligations, just the promise of quiet hours to reclaim some sanity. But as I shuffled toward the kitchen, I froze. There, scrawled across the wall beside the hallway, thick and uneven, were jagged letters scratched in waxy red crayon: “MY TURN.”

The words danced with the awkward boldness of a child’s hand, looping and crooked, each mark pressed hard enough to leave streaks along the plaster. For an instant, I thought maybe I’d done it myself, sleepwalking in the depths of my unrest, but even as the thought formed, I knew it wasn’t true. I didn’t own any crayons. I had never seen that color before—candy-apple bright, somehow wet-looking in the midafternoon light.

My skin crawled. I moved from room to room, checking locks, searching corners, my breath shallow with dread. The geisha doll sat exactly where I’d left her the night before, unmoved and inexplicable, her painted lips curving in that same enigmatic smile. Sunlight caught the glass of her eyes, making them shimmer—alive, almost, if I let myself believe it.

I pressed a trembling palm to the fresh crayon, as if touch might explain it, might make it mundane. But the wax was real, gritty under my fingers, and the message was undeniable. The air in the apartment felt changed—charged, as if the walls themselves remembered my outburst, and something or someone had finally decided to answer.

Something in me broke then, the last thread of denial fraying away. I wasn’t alone. I wasn’t imagining this. I was being haunted, and whatever haunted me was no longer content with watching TV.

My day off stretched before me, thick with the promise of terror, the childish scrawl burning into my sight. I tried to rehearse explanations, reasons, steps I could take—call someone, leave, destroy the doll—but all of it felt thin and useless against the reality of that message. “MY TURN.”

The apartment hummed with silence. I waited, uncertain, afraid to blink, afraid to look away from the wall, afraid most of all to see what the geisha would do next.
