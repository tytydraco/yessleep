I never imagined that a simple purchase from a thrift store would come to consume me the way it has.

It’s a mirror—an old one, with a gilded frame, delicate gold trim, and intricate flourishes along the edges. It sat hidden behind a haphazard pile of cracked paintings and dust-covered picture frames, crammed into the farthest corner of the store. But something about it spoke to me, its antique charm irresistible, drawing me closer. I thought it was beautiful. 

Now, I know it wasn’t its beauty that called to me; it was something else entirely. 

I find myself staring at it for hours, unable to look away. At night, the reflection is never right. The shadows fall in all the wrong places, the furniture a few inches out of place, objects subtly—unsettlingly—shifted. It’s as if the mirror doesn’t just reflect what’s in front of it but some other version of my room, some other version of reality. 

The longer I stare, the more the scene changes. Occasionally, I caught glimpses of myself in the reflection, standing in spots I wasn’t in. Or worse, showing me twisted, unnatural poses that my physical body couldn’t replicate. 

Lately, I’ve gotten the courage to look at my reflection closely. And once my eyes are locked with it, I can’t tear myself from the mirror. We talk sometimes, myself and the reflection. 

It started with whispers at first. It was a soft voice, too faint to understand. It was almost an unsettling murmur, but over time, the voice grew louder, more insistent. It was a rasping, dry, unnatural voice that felt like it was clawing its way through the glass. It told me things, horrible things. Things I never wanted to know; Things I couldn’t unhear.

There are times now when I wake up in the middle of the night to find myself standing in front of the mirror, eyes wide and fixed. I don’t remember getting there, but the reflection is already waiting. It speaks as soon as I meet its gaze, the words thick with a kind of hunger. I try to pull myself away, but my body is frozen, my hands locked in place as though the mirror’s grip has reached out and tethered me to it.

I’ve seen what’s in that reflection. 

It’s not just me anymore. There are others in there—faint shapes that shift and sway like shadows, their faces hidden, their hands reaching out to me, clawing, beckoning, urging me to join them. I feel their presence even when I’m not in front of the mirror. I hear them—voices seeping from the glass, pulling me closer, whispering my name. 

I tried to get rid of the mirror. I dragged it to the dumpster, but by morning it was back in the same corner of my room, waiting.

Tonight, I’m going to try one last time to destroy it. I’ll break the glass, I’ll shatter it into a thousand pieces, and hope that’ll sever whatever hold it has on me. But as I write this, I can already hear it calling, a low murmur from the corner of my room. 

The reflection is waiting and I can’t help but take another glance.
