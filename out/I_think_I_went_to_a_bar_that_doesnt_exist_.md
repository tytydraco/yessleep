I work an office job, we draw up plans to show exactly where plumbing needs to go in restaurants or shopping centers. Well we had a large project we had been working on for weeks, and it was finally almost complete. So that means all of us employees were coming in around 6 or 7 in the morning and not leaving until 6 or 7 at night to make sure we could get all of the final details in place. I was so excited when Friday rolled around, I actually got out of bed with a skip in my step. I was so ready to hit the bar tonight and drink my stressful week away. My day was super boring but productive and I was pretty proud of this project, our small town had finally decided to add a much needed movie theater. I was just thrilled that I could be a part of something that was going to make such an impact here, but when 6 oclock came, I was even more thrilled to hop in my car and get on to my next destination. 

We only have one rinky dink bar in our town where you will see everybody you know, and to be honest I was not in the mood to make any small talk, I wanted to get straight to the point…drunk. So I pulled up my maps on my phone and searched for a bar in the next town over. The first suggestion for me was a place called “The Black Dog”. It looked like a quaint place, and in all the photos all the same people were in them, so I figured it was a place I could go with no, “The weather has been nice lately” comments, as these people looked pretty drunk in all the pictures, but for some odd reason I couldn’t make out any of their faces. But I told myself I didn’t need to know them, I just needed to have a few drinks and call a cab to take me home afterwards and curl up in bed with a movie. 

I quickly put the address into my GPS, but nothing popped up.  I thought maybe the place was new, so I put in the coordinates. My ETA was about 45 minutes, not too shabby, and definitely far enough away from anyone I might know. I turned on my radio and listened to some tunes the whole way there. When I pulled in there were three cars in the parking lot, but what was weird about it, all the cars looked super old, and when I say old I mean like late 1800s or early 1900s old. I put the car in park, grabbed my purse, jacket, and phone and headed in. No one greeted me, but that was okay with me, like I have said a million times, I just want a few drinks with no distractions. I walked up to the bar and orderd my poison of choice, a good ole Cosmopolitan. The bartender took my order and had my drink made and in my hand super quickly. I looked around just wanted to take a peek a the fellow bar goers, because after all I am a woman and I do have some sense of awareness. It was three men, all dressed in super old timey clothing, it was the same men from the pictures and oddly enough I still couldn’t make out their faces but it was pretty dark in there, this town is weird with all their choices in cars and clothing, but shortly none of that seemed to matter…the drink was working, all my worries of work were slowly fading. 

I shortly ordered another drink, but this time the bartender said something that was kind of odd, “We don’t see many pretty women like you around.” I ignored him, I’m not here for any flirting or a casual Friday night hook up. I decided to pull out my phone and scroll through my socials, but of course my service was out. I asked one of the patrons who was sitting two seats down from me if he knew the wifi code. He looked at me as if I was absolutely nuts, “What is wifi? I have no idea what you are talking about.”. I didn’t even reply, did I end up in some Amish town or something, that would explain the cars and the outfits, but it wouldn’t explain that there was only one phone in the building, and it wasn’t even a phone…it was a telegraph machine. 

I decided to only have one more drink because I was getting creeped out, I ordered my drink, guzzled it down and walked outside to call a cab. I gave my address and shortly after I was getting a call from the taxi service. The man on the phone was saying he couldn’t find me at that address, that I must have gave him the wrong one, but I double checked, I had definitely given him the right adress. I just ended up deciding to walk to the nearest gas station and have him pick me up there. When I hopped in his car I asked the man if he knew anything about The Black Dog. He looked puzzled, “Yes Ma’am, that was a bar that was open during the Civil War for the soldiers, but it was torn down shortly after the war, a fight broke out one night leaving three men and the bartender dead.”. I didn’t even respond, my mind was racing, where even was I for the past two hours. So much for my peaceful weekend.
