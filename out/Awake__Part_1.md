**Awake**

Part 1 – Surgery

It all started, what felt to me, like yesterday. But in reality, I have no idea how much time has passed. You see, I needed to have surgery. Nothing major, but I needed to have my gallbladder removed. It's a relatively small procedure, but I was having so much pain from it, it had to be done. If you know the pain, you know why I had it done.

Anyway, I had this operation planned on this scheduled day: *>!illegible!<*. My wife and daughter were with me at the hospital. If the surgery goes well, I could go home the same day. But the thing is, in the current times, something strange seems to lurk in the air. I know it sounds strange, but we've heard on the news that weird radio waves have been picked up everywhere around the world. So much that it has been interfering with electronic devices everywhere. From phones and microwaves acting weird, to complete blackouts in some cities.

It's been going on for a week now. People are still trying to do their jobs and day-to-day life is mostly the same. But until the... *>!illegible!<*... things are so confusing. I just don't know what's going on! Like I mentioned, things were mostly normal. So I was happy my operation could go on. I really wanted to get rid of my gallbladder after all.

The nurse told me that the hospital had backup generators. So if there was a power outage, the hospital could still continue their work. They even had small "sleep devices" for each patient to keep them in a coma-like state. In case the backup generators failed, these devices would prevent patients from waking up in the middle of surgery. It would also keep the patients in a sleep state after procedures, so they could rest their bodies a bit more. The patient would remain in a coma-like state until the device would stop working.

My mind was a bit more at ease. I've read about people waking up mid-surgery, and I definitely did not want that to happen. The kind nurse mentioned that this rarely ever happens and it's a common fear among patients. She also said that I was lucky with the sunny room, as the sleep device was solar-powered. It could store energy for three months before needing sunlight again.

"More importantly, we're here to help you all the way through!" I remember my wife saying.

"Yep," was the short response from my teenage daughter. She barely looked up from her phone.

"When you wake up, we'll be right here next to you," she smiled.

I never knew how right she was... *>!illegible!<*... to the sight of that. But at the time my wife's beautiful smile gave me hope and comfort. I know my daughter seemed so uninterested, but she was always so sweet. It's just part of being a teenager, to be a little distant at times.

The wait in the hospital wasn't long. Within an hour I was called up for surgery.

"Good luck, Dad!" my daughter shouted. She had even put her phone to the side this time. The look in her eyes showed me that she might've been more nervous than I was about the whole situation.

"We love you, honey!" I heard my wife saying as I was being taken away.

I took a deep breath. "It's just a small procedure," I thought three times in a row. I'm not so sure why I was getting so anxious about it all of a sudden. I'm usually a pretty calm and down-to-earth person. Although a surgery is not something you'll experience every day. The nurse asked if I was nervous.

"Yeah, a little bit," I said.

"That’s normal," she said, "most people are, but you're in good hands here."

I knew I was in good hands. She pushed me through a long hallway and as I looked at the passing ceiling lights, I noticed a flicker in the light.

"Yes, it happens more often lately," the nurse said.

Even if it was a daily occurrence now, it did not help in easing my mind. The lights flickered twice more before reaching the large door at the end of the hallway. She parked my bed in front of the large door. Then she held her badge in front of the scanner next to the door. After a few seconds, a long monotone beep was heard.

"Huh?" the nurse exclaimed. She tried her badge again. Again, a long beep. The door remained like frozen still. She looked at the little screen above the scanner.

"What's *error 79225.2116*?" she said to herself.

She peeked through the small circular window in the door. Then tried her badge in front of the scanner again. Now a short beep was heard. The door finally opened.

"It probably has to do with all the radio wave interference lately," she said, followed by a sigh.

She paced a bit faster now. I looked around to see all the people in their olive green surgery suits. They hurried past me left and right. It gave me a feeling like everyone was in a rush. A lady came up to us and said, "Hello sir, I'm your anesthetist today." She probably said it with a smile—I couldn’t see her mouth with the mask on.

"You're a bit early, we're still cleaning the operation room for you."

I saw the previous patient a few feet away. He was clearly knocked out good. His head hung to the side and his face was pale like a ghost.

"Early?" The nurse laughed. "I thought we were late since the door wouldn't open."

The anesthetist gazed at the nurse. "Oh, well there are some technical issues here, but luckily nothing big yet."

The anesthetist thanked the nurse. "We'll take over from here."

It took a few minutes before we were able to go into the operation room. The anesthetist said she would start with inserting the IV. In the meantime, I was looking around the rather large room. A lot of doctors, surgeons, nurses, and medical professionals were walking all around. I could tell the urgency in their body language.

It's like they... *>!illegible!<*

Everyone was making haste. Like they all needed to finish their job quickly. As I was staring at them, I suddenly felt a sharp sting in my left hand. My body reacted with a short shock.

"Oh Sir, I'm so sorry!" the anesthetist said. "I forgot to warn you about inserting the IV. It's quite busy here, I completely forgot to tell you to brace yourself a bit."

I told her it was fine, but in reality, with everything that was going on I felt more and more nervous.

After a short wait, the operation room was cleaned and I was rolled in. The surgeon asked me in a calm voice:

"Hello Sir, would you kindly tell me your name and tell me what we're going to do today?"

I answered him and he nodded.

"When was the last time you ate something, Sir?"

I answered him again and was reminded how I didn't eat in the last 14 hours. I suddenly realized how hungry I was at this point.

"We will now start putting you under anesthesia, so we can start the operation," the surgeon said.

An assistant put a mask on my face. "You might feel a little dizzy now. Please count from ten to zero slowly," he said.

I could hear some sort of machine suddenly start beeping rapidly in the distance. I heard someone saying loudly:

"Really? It's going into error mode *now*!?"

I remember nothing after that. It all went black. Like a candle being blown out, my consciousness just disconnected...
