Does anyone remember in the 80s of the famous Delphine Resort? Everyone travelled up there to spend the summer, leaving their homes after months of work and agony then  being able to lay in the thick hot sun for hours on end or dip their feet in the cool water. I was told relentlessly by my friends that i had to find a job that summer, no more playing video games at the arcade or eating conchas until i pass out — i had to find a job and perhaps date someone who was not my bed. 



I remember staying over at my grandparents house in Catalonia, Spain for the summer or longer even before i could travel back up to the US, that was when my grandma looked upon websites looking for a part time job for a sixteen year old who only had experience in small swimming and archery classes. She laughed in relief when she stumbled upon the page of the Delphine Resort, blue waves in the background with palm trees on either side of  the large text that took me in a trance of beauty. The page was filled with pictures of children and people with massive smiles on their faces, then you can select what you are looking for. My grandma quickly selected the page to do with applying for a job at the resort.

I then found myself driving with my grandad sifting through colourful houses and painted sidewalks, then after thirty minutes, my eyes laid upon the vast green bushes and palm trees that stood up in strong positions against the soft wind that tickled my cheeks as i walked out the car, my grandad descending with it. The sound of children yelling and splashing in the water caught my attention as a warm smile crept up. I began walking towards the reception, my eyes catching the pink and yellow glow that shone into the glass windows. 



“How may i help you?” A soft voice came from the lady behind the reception desk, her light blue eyes shining through mine, and her silk brown hair on either side of her shoulders. 


“Hey there i am here to start my job as the lifeguard at the Delphine Resort..” I said in a huskily voice as my gaze was transfixed on the large paintings of old buildings and history books stacked on the coloured bookshelves that were evenly placed in order of appearance.


“Oh yes would you please state your name for me?” the woman asked kindly, her eyes drifting back into mine as i cleared my throat and replied.



“Jairo Ruiz” 


“Lovely to meet you Jairo, would you kindly take a seat while i message Bernard on your arrival..!” the lady lowered her eyes back onto the old computer as i nodded and took a seat near the bookshelf of the reception room. 


It was within seconds when my eyes lingered upon the dark haired man that stood in front of me. The man painted a large smile on his face as he lead me out of the reception and into the entrance of the resort. 


I was in awe of the place, the miniature rocks in the grassy path and blue and green slides that looped and turned, buried into the water. I found myself gasping at the food bars with thick wooden roofs and pink, white drinks bubbling under the shade. Laughter resonated with every turn i made, my shoes clapping on every beat of the music from the indoor pools, the air was so sweet and indulging that i wouldn’t mind living in this place.



“Now my friend, you will be in Section A, and I’ll be in Section B.” Bernard said with a smile, his hazel eyes glistening with the orange glow that crept with the lapping of waves.



The resort had two sections, Orca and Dolphin. 

Me and Bernard were placed on the other side of the resort, Orca. We primarily looked after the families that had hotels in the Orca region. 


The large pool had many children and adults jumping and splashing in the pool, it was my duty on Section A to watch the front part of the pool whilst Bernard watches the back part, ensuring no child ever drowned underneath floats whilst the front part was the most important thing to look after. 



The ruffle sound of the radio caught my attention as i quickly pressed it against my ear. 


“Hey newbie how you doing so far..?” Bernard chimed in, as he quickly gave me a wave and a giggle through the radio.



“All good over here, how you keeping up..?” I replied back as i gave a brief thumps up. 



“Alright, a kid just shitted in his towel and the mother is cleaning it up but yeah, all good!” Bernard chuckled as i did the same, my eyes fixated on the man climbing up the small steps of the slide.



“Hey.. Bernard.. i have a question, how long have you been doing this job..?” i asked, my words slipping up in my mouth as i looked across from the clear water and the children laughing on the side of the pool


“Been a while, but chico.. you’ll get the hang of it, you’ve passed all the examinations and tests to be a lifeguard.. and now you’re in!” Bernard replied as a beeping noise overcame his radio, then we stopped talking for a while. 



My eyes stared up at the blue slide, as an unsettling feeling crept up through my body.


The large blue slide stretched out across the massive pool in loops, similar to the green slide — however, you couldn’t see inside. I grabbed my safety equipment and carefully walked over to Bernard who was sitting further away from me. 



“Hey dude what’s up—“



“ALEJANDRA!!… ROSETTA..?!” a loud call came from a family who looked panicked and confused as they walked and ran up and down the resort. 



Bernard’s face changed from polite to cold as he rushed over to the parents. 


“What is wrong..? Tell me what is going on..?” Bernard reassured the family as the mother came forward, her hands shaking as she called out her daughters.



“A-Alejandra and Rosetta.. we cannot find them…we—“



“Where was the last time you saw Alejandra and Rosetta..?” I quickly asked the mother as her eyes widened in pure shock as she pointed behind me. 


At this point, people started to gather around us, parents desperately ordered their children out from the pool as i gathered my equipment and went right into the water, whilst Bernard and other staff tried calming the crowd.



I swam towards the blue slide, and placed a foot upon the wooden ladder, my hands grasping each part of the slide as i made my to the very top. Looking down it was dark and not a place to slide down, but that didn’t bother me.



My heart began beating more rapidly, each beat filled my body with a cold, shivering sensation that something was very wrong here. 


I slowly began entering the slide, one torch in my hand and the other gripping the slide so i don’t fall right down. It was really felt like a good hour had passed as i gradually held the slide and went deep down, in hopes of finding the two girls.



That was when i heard it.




A small cry that echoed down from where i was. It sounded like a man talking, but in a stern order as if they were demanding something — then followed a sobbing cry which was like two girls at once. 



I motioned myself down, my heart was now pounding and screaming as the cries became more louder and desperate.


i slid. 



And as i went down, so did the screaming and crying. i then spotted a glimpse of light, and i found myself in the water again, i managed to pull myself together and look around to see if i could spot the girls.


Bernard alerted me to his direction as i climbed out the pool and rushed over to him. 



“W-we have a problem here—“


“Did you see the girls, Jairo…?” Bernard asked, his eyes narrowing as he pulled me to the side, away from the worried families.



“I-erm… no i-i didn’t..” I stuttered as a hint of urgency surged into Bernard’s face.


He then turned around and ordered the family of the two missing daughters to come forward. 



Soon enough everyone started to look for the children. In the hallways of the villa, in the bars and restaurants, the water and slides. 


One of the girls was missing a flower clip, so that was enough for all of us to search far and wide.


But there was no sight of them. 



The belongings of the family that had lost their children were scattered in their villas. Bernard told me that they were devoting every minute that they had to find Alejandra and Rosetta — however, they had to return back to their country and i haven’t heard anything from them since. 



It had only been a month before we had a conversation with a woman whose child had disappeared from the Orca restaurant. I was in disbelief trying to reason with myself about the entire situation, grandma begged me to look for another job but i couldn’t just bag it up and leave, i felt that there was something more to this story. 



Delphine Resort still had many people entering as if nothing happened, many children played in the pool where Alejandra and Rosetta were last seen, many adults ate at the fancy restaurant where a three year old had disappeared.



I was on my last shift of the week. The only thing i had to do now was close up the pool area, and check if everything was safe before i could head off home. My eyelids constantly dragged themselves down as i scooped the weed rake from the corner of the slide and took the weeds out from the pool. My hands moved up and down as i caught the group of weeds and dipped them into the bucket — i took the last scoop, gathering the weeds in my rake as i noticed something odd lapping in the water. 


Dumping the last remaining weeds in the bucket, i stretched the rake out as it dipped itself into the water. 


I then tried grabbing the item with the rake which motioned itself with the water.



I stepped back. Trepidation consumed the remaining thoughts that i had as it coursed through my shaking body. My eyes were fixated upon it, no words could describe how much i wanted to scream in pure disgust.


There, laid a single pink underwear that was soaked in the water. I managed to pull it out, so i could take a better look at it. 




That was when i saw it.




I wasn’t sure if it was me being paranoid or if i was drained from working, but my eyes could make out a man standing at the top of wooden platform where the blue slide was. The man was holding what it looked like to be a little child cradled in his arms. 



I instantly dropped the rake on the floor and skidded towards the blue slide but the two seemed to have disappeared off. 


Tap.


Tap.



Tap.



I jumped out of my skin as i turned around and met eyes with Bernard who stood there staring at me with a smirk on his face.



“Chico you need to go sleep… you look like a right state today..” He sighed as he placed one hand on my shoulder.


The colour in my cheeks slowly regained its vibrance as i tried to hold myself together whilst i said.



“Did you see that…..?” 



“See what..?” Bernard asked as he made his way to the near by bench as i followed after him.



“T-the man i-it was on the slide..w-with a child…” I faintly replied as we both sat down.



“What the heck are you talking about Jairo..you know what…I’ll take over your shift you can go home.” Bernard said as he exchanged a look of concern for me.



“No. i know what i saw..—“


“What exactly did you see..?” Bernard asked as he looked over at me. 



“I saw a man on the wooden floor of the blue slide…” i said as i pointed at it, the dim light from the moon was the only thing that sort of allowed us to properly see the slide. 


Bernard tucked at my lifeguard jacket as he murmured something under his breath and pulled me away. 


I didn’t have time to process what had happened because Bernard dragged me through the reception area and towards his car where we both drove for what felt like hours.



“Bernard… what the fuck is going on.?!” i firmly shouted as he gripped the steering wheel tightly.



We passed many palm trees and large coloured houses  — the street lights illuminating the rocky road as we headed straight. 



“Can you answer my question..?!” I shot angrily as i glanced in his direction, his eyes lingering on mine as the only thing i saw was a look of fear that plastered his face.



Bernard took a heavy sigh as i then said.



“Why is it that when those people disappeared…none of the colleagues looked interested….?” I questioned my hands now trembling as Bernard swerved the car to the side and stopped.



“The more people that go missing… the more money Delphine gets paid..” he said with a monotonous tone to his voice as if felt a stab of disgust leap into my throat.



“ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE..?! BERNARD…! WHAT ARE YOU HIDING FROM ME..? WHAT IS GOING ON..?! WHY ISN’T THE POLICE INVOLVED..? WHY DID I—“



“You don’t get it chico…” he said with a nervous laugh as he fiddled with his fingers.


“What don’t i get..? Can you just spill it out…?” i felt the tension in my body release as Bernard sighed deeply, he then turned and replied.



“It’s not easy… working as a lifeguard.. we all get our ups and downs but you handled it so well Jairo and now..now you’re asking for the impossible..” Bernard whispered as he turned around and back again, his fingers now drumming the steering wheel with a rhythmic beat like a drip from a sink. 



“What are you talking about—“



“They are watching us. Always watching. And well we have to be careful Jairo.” Bernard grunted as he started the car up again as we drove into the night.



“Who is watching…? Aliens…fucking unicorns…??” I sniggered as i glanced at Bernard assuming he would at least laugh along and tell me it was some stupid joke. But he didn’t he just coldly said. 


“Worse.” 


I felt the words catch up in my throat as he began talking again.



“The reason you are driving with me tonight is because you are being watched and i am here to make sure you’re safe..—“



“Watched..?! By who.. i saw a fucking man holding a child which im pretty sure belongs to one of those families who had their kid been ripped apart from them!!.” I shot back as Bernard had a look of sadness painted on his face.



“That’s the thing about you.. you need to shut up and watch that mouth of yours… especially when you’re in the resort..” Bernard added as he gave me a reassuring smile.



“Do you believe in entities…monsters?…—“



“Cut the crap with the alien shit..!!” I turned to face the window as he gave me a hum which sounded like a ‘no’. 




“Those who disappeared were supposed to Jairo…we can’t talk about that in the resort..” he said as the road ahead began to fill with houses and bus stops as i realised we were probably heading to Bernard’s place.



“I-i saw something in the pool…it was.. a girls underwear..” I whispered, my breath hitched as i watched Bernard coldly stare ahead. 



“Fuck is going on Bernard..w-what are you not telling me..” i began to look at the young man that was seated next to me, wondering if i ever trusted the person as i dug my nails into my hand — the thought alerting me with every movement he did as Bernard then cleared his throat and said.


“That resort is like a dream come true…you can see any child you desire there..” he replied with a gravelly sort of voice — my eyes widening as i realised what was happening.



I couldn’t move. It was like all my limps were contracted into the seat, cold and aching. This couldn’t be right, i had to escape there was several people on the streets, enough for me to scream and cry, tell everyone that i had been kidnapped by someone i thought was my friend — but Bernard then continued and he steadily added.



“I thought it was just me…going insane.. you..you know.. you make friends with the families that stay there.. you befriend the kids who tell you that they can do front-flips in the pool and eat millions of desserts at once at the restaurant…but you would never imagine that one of them would go missing and never return the next day.” Bernard faintly spoke as the relief settled and crept back up again as he stated.



“Everyone played it off, no one said anything but unfortunately i did. I asked the person that took on my role before you came along and before i was even promoted.. he was gone. We all heard he left to take on a new job far from Catalonia but i didn’t believe that crap.. he’s dead..” Bernard groaned, as the car halted from the traffic light.



“Then you came along, innocent, not one bit shocked of what you were getting yourself into — as long as we work, do our job and not complain or say anything about the disappearances.. the better it is for all of us.” he explained as he stared back at me as i felt my heart drop inside of me. 



“What..what are you..saying..-“



“Don’t bother making friends with families or the children…it will just make you mourn for ages…like now…” Bernard gave me another reassuring smile as i then responded with.



“THOSE WERE INNOCENT CHILDREN AND SOMEONE FUCKING DID SOMETHING DISGUSTING AND…AND WRONG TO THEM..AND I JUST FOUND A PIECE OF IT IN THE FUCKING POOL..!!” i screamed 
 as Bernard replied with another deep sigh and responded.



“We can’t do anything about that..not even the police can, the resort has already passed the agreement..and they are already there..—“



“W-what agreement….?” i questioned as the coldness wrapped around my body, my eyes drifted to Bernard — the same look of dread and sorrow edged across his face as he finally muttered. 





“We don’t know what those things are but the only thing they desire is the children”
