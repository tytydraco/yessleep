  
So this all started a bit more than a year ago when my grandmother came to pass. She died a natural death at the age of 94. Nonetheless, it was an intense period for our family, full of grief and emotional pain. Especially to me and my sister.   
Our grandmother raised us to the women we are today by lack of our own mother. Grandma never gave details about our actual mother, besides the telling that 'our real mother was not suited to care for us'. She didn't like us asking a lot of questions about it, so we rarely did. Days after the funeral, we were expected at the notary to settle the inheritance. In her will she had put down that her goods were to be divided between me and my sister. The punctual woman that she was, she had had inventory taken of what she owned, and she also knew exactly what we both wanted as a reminder of her.   
  
Except for one item...   
  
You see... our grandmother had this locket. All the years we have known her, we have never seen her without it. She continued to wear it even while sleeping or when taking a bath. Once when I asked her why she kept the locket on all these times, she smiled, took the locket between her thumb and index finger and said: 'This locket is my lucky charm'.   
  
My sister, however, coveted the medallion more than I did. Mainly when she was smaller, she often asked if she could put it on. Our grandmother allowed us lots of things, but that specific request was out of the question.   
  
\---  
  
When the notary was nearing the end of the list, my sister interrupted him by asking who would inherit the locket. The notary seemed slightly offended by my sister's abrupt question. He paused and then explained that locket was not listed in our grandmother's will. In that case, the notary said that we would have to figure out ourselves who would get the locket. My sister did not let this opportunity pass and claimed it before I could utter a word. I decided not to worry about it. I knew how much she wanted the locket, so I just let it go.   
  
A few days later, my sister and I went to empty our grandmother's house she used to rent. I had asked my husband to come along, who in turn had brought a friend, to help with moving heavy pieces. We had rented a truck that would bring our inherited pieces to each of our homes. After everything had been moved, my sister felt tired and went straight home, much to my husband's frustration. After all, my sister hadn't helped much with the move and the fact that she didn't want to help clean up afterwards made him angry. He was even more upset than I was that my sister got to keep the valuable locket, and he accused me of allowing my sister to take advantage of me too much. I didn't want to waste too many words on it and focused on cleaning the house. My husband and I started by cleaning her bedroom. That room made me feel the most uncomfortable. I wasn't exactly sure why. I thought the sooner it was done, the better. It was in my grandmother's bedroom that my husband discovered a hidden door which give entrance to another small room. However, the door wasn't unknown to me since I've known about it since I was a kid. My grandmother used to tell me the story that 'the roe' lives there. But that he is quite shy around people, so I shouldn't enter the room. Later, older and wiser, I realized it was actually a hiding place for black money. I once told Nic - which is my husband's name - that story, and he listened to it quite attentively.  
  
Being sure this was the room of that story, my husband eagerly entered it and I followed along with him. But to his dissapointment: the money was gone. A bit further in the room ,we saw a table with on a it a book with a blue cover. As curious as my husband is, he opened it first. It seemed to be a diary containing notes of the days before my grandmother passed away. It gave me the chills and I wanted to stop looking at it. But my husband wanted to read it all. I resumed my cleaning work in the bedroom until he suddenly shouted. 'Hear this!', he said and he started to read out loud.   
  
It said: 'the locket... oh the locket... it should belong to the sweeter child. Dear Milly, let the locket take care of your heart.'  
"Did you hear that? She wanted it to belong to you. Honey, the locket is yours!", my husband said enthusiastically.  
I didn't know how to respond or what to think about it.   
My husband put his finger on the exact sentence in her diary. It was my grandmother's handwriting, no doubt about that. Only... it seemed strange to me, she addressed me as 'the sweeter child'. Especially since she had dedicated her whole life to treating my sister and me equally. With those words, that lifelong dedication seemed to be gone, like a heavy storm that left nothing of a house standing. I remembered being lost in thought, after which my husband had to shake me awake. It all became a bit too much for me.  
  
"Milly! Milly!", he shouted, "You should show her this and ask it back."  
"Who?", I asked confused.   
"Léah, your sister, of course! Who else?"  
"No... I can't", I said.  
\- "What do you mean you can't?"  
"She... Léah has always been fond of this locket and..."  
"AND it belongs to you!", interrupted my husband.   
"Nic," I said, "just leave it be. For me..."  
During the rest of the cleanup, we didn't say anything to each other, nor on the way back.  
It took Nic a few weeks before he actually let it go.   
We agreed that our relationship was worth more than a locket.   
  
  
My sister Léah, on the other hand, flaunted the locket wherever she could.   
Just like my grandmother used to, she started wearing the locket at all times, to frustration of my husband.   
It is remarkable: it was as if once my sister had 'received' the locket, everything started going her way.  
In a short period of time, she became the managing partner at the company where she worked, met a handsome man, and immediately found and bought the house of her dreams.  
On the other hand, my husband and I were less fortunate. It is our dream to have children, but we are unable to conceive. Not at that moment anyways. I was also told at that time that I had a serious chronic condition. Nevertheless, according to the doctors, it should not be a reason why we were still childless.   
However, at the the time, due to being more fatigued and whatnot, I was unable to keep up with the demands of my job and eventually lost it.   
We had difficulties paying the bills and my husband had to work overtime.   
He continued to support me and was always there during difficult times.  
Although, his feelings of jealousy and anger towards my sister grew more and more.   
Without my knowledge, he went to my sister's house one night and rang the doorbell.  
He showed my sister the diary of our grandmother. After all this time, I didn't know that my husband had kept it, but now that I think about it, it didn't entirely surprise me either.  
After this incident, I had one final conversation with my sister on the phone. According to her, Nic didn't ask for the locket, he demanded it. Threatening with legal actions if she wouldn't give it up.   
My sister was suspicious of me, thinking it was I who had assigned the task to my husband to get me the locket.   
I spent our latest call denying that accusation. But it had no use.  
  
I vividly remember the evening when my husband came home with the locket in his hand. He had a smile from ear to ear, as if he had won a war, at long last.   
I woke up after I've fallen asleep in front of the tv. He whispered to me:   
"It's yours now.", and he put the locket around my neck.   
Afterwards, he fell asleep next to me on the couch, as if he could finally rest after all that time.  
I held the locket in my hand, it felt strange to me and it weighed surprisingly heavy.   
I opened it, expecting a picture of my grandma or even my mother within it.  
But there was no picture, only a message written. It said:   
"The luck of the one is the misfortune of the other"  
I wondered why my grandmother would write that in her locket. It send some shivers down my spine, but I soon tried to forget about it.   
  
As of today, our situation has turned completely. My medication seems to be effective against my chronic disease. To the surprise of the doctors, who even think I may be able to completely recover from it.  
I got a new wonderful job too and two weeks ago... my husband an I received the wonderful news ... that I am pregnant!   
It's incredible how our lives have changed in just a few months, going from hell to heaven in a blink of an eye.  
  
Since the day I received the locket from my husband, I haven't taken it off. In the beginning, I felt a bit guilty for taking the locket from my sister, but the diary made it clear. Grandmother wanted me to have it.  
Since our last phone conversation, I haven't heard anything from my sister. The only thing I heard were rumors from our mutual friends. Alledgedly, she broke up with her partner and is she no longer living in her dreamhouse. According to an other friend, who is also a colleague of hers, she is on the verge of a burnout at work.   
I tried to call her several times, but everytime she hears my voice, she just hangs up the phone.   
  
The latest development is the most frightening. For the last few days, in the evenings, a man in a black t-shirt and jeans seems to be monitoring our home. He always has a phone in his hand and either makes calls or pretends to be on a call. I confronted the man yesterday, asked him what he was doing.   
  
"I'm just making a call, ma'am ... I'm just making a call"  
\- "I've seen you hanging around my house for the last few days now, every evening around the same time"  
"You are mistaken, ma'am"  
"No I am not"  
Around that time, my husband came home.   
"What are you doing here again?", my husband said to the man in the black t-shirt.   
\-"I'm sorry sir, but just like ma'am here, I think you are mistaken", the man in the black t-shirt said.   
"No, you sir, are acting suspiciously. Get out of here!", my husband shouted.   
"Sir... there's no need..."  
"Sir, please leave," I said, "or I have to call the police."  
"Alright...alright... take a chill pill".   
The man in the black shirt stepped into his car, a few feet further and drove away.   
My husband and I returned to our home.   
  
"Did you leave the door open?", my husband asked.   
"Yeah, but I was only outside for a few minutes", I said.   
Little did we know the havoc that awaited us.  
The house was completely turned upside down. Cabinets were pulled open, papers were scattered around, our sofa was slashed open...  
In the kitchen, a jar containing Freddy, our goldfish, had been knocked off the table. The poor creature was struggling for its life. I quickly placed the lid in the sink and made sure the fish was back in water as soon as possible.  
My husband pressed his hands against his forehead and looked at the message written in large letters on our kitchen wall.  
It said: "IT BELONGS TO ME!!"
