I've always been different. Not that everyone is the same, but my kind of differences robbed me of childhood and the blissful ignorance that comes with being under a certain age. It was a family trait, passed down to some of the women, though my gift was unheard of even among our oddities. My mother would see things in dreams and sense events before they happened, like most of the women in our family. I, however, was handed much more than the gift of sleep divination.

 

I could see things surrounding people. If someone hurt me, bad things would happen to them. When I spoke certain things into existence, usually after a fit of rage or sadness, they would manifest themselves within days or weeks. I saw figures in the dark, faces, and creatures I knew nothing about until I came across them in books, movies, or folk stories. This solidified my belief in the unseen, the paranormal, and the oddities of the world from a very young age. I never truly felt alone in any room. I could pick out people with ill intent before most of my peers, and I often found myself caught between the realms of sleep and wakefulness, hearing and feeling things I wish I could forget.

 I’ve come to terms with many things that happened to me over the years, except for what I guess I’d call my encounter with a strange thing, draped in a cloak. I’d say man, but there was nothing about it that I’d classify as human. I don’t remember the exact date of the first and last time it crossed my path, but it all happened during the summer of 2003. I was four then, still lived in BC, and we had this beautiful home. Empty, old but had its charm. It was divided into two floors and had one of those long stairways that swirled around the top floor and went down right in front of the doorway. My room was the first one you could see and access once you went up the stairs. I feared the dark and would sleep with the door closed and my nightlight on; otherwise, it looked like a never-ending pit of unsettling darkness during nighttime.

One night, I woke up needing to pee. Strangely enough, my bedroom door was open. The urge to relieve myself was greater than my fear of the dark, so I got ready to leave my duvet and venture into the dark until a shape caught my eye.

It was moving towards the bedframe, slowly. My first thought was that my eyes were just playing tricks on me and that I’d eventually adjust to the contrast of my room and the hallway, but something didn’t quite feel right. I felt my stomach drop, my heart started racing, I pulled the blanket back over myself and closed my eyes briefly, mumbling prayers to myself, hoping I was just seeing things out of fear.

Curiosity got the best of me. I opened my eyes, ready to face an empty hallway, but to my unfortunate surprise, a cloaked figure was standing in the doorway. It didn’t have a face, but the emptiness under the hood conveyed more emotion than it should have. I remember the air suddenly feeling cold, goosebumps rising,  and the lighting in the room seemed like it now had a crimson filter over it. The figure just stood there. Despite how hollow it appeared, I caught glimpses of what seemed like decaying bones under the hood. It was holding a rusty blade, which I later discovered was a scythe when I saw the object again a few years later at a fair. It clicked then that the Reaper, as I call him now, had visited me.

 

I could tell he was trying to come into the room. The atmosphere felt angrier and angrier with each attempt on his part, but for whatever reason, still unknown to me to this day, he could not cross the doorway. I’ve never felt such an unsettling presence. Time didn’t feel real; it didn’t feel like a dream either. If anything, I would have preferred it to be a nightmare, the situation seemingly too real for my taste. I pulled the covers over my head and shut my eyes as tightly as I could. I don’t know how long I spent curled up under the blanket, too scared to breathe or even look in case it had miraculously gotten closer.  I remained that way until sleep got the best of me.

 I woke up a few hours later, the door still open, light still on, to my mother’s surprise, which convinced me that my nightly encounter was as real as it felt.

 I never saw him again. I don’t know what or who this spectral creature was, what it wanted, or why it never got past the doorway. I never spoke about it to anyone, worried I would get answers to questions I didn’t want to ask myself, yet I wonder how many others had a similar encounter, some who weren’t as fortunate as I was…
