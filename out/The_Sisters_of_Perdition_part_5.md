I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Ewan. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

After I moved to the monastery my life was truly different. I was trained as a warrior monk. I was 16. It was 1856.

There was lots of farm work to be done and I did it diligently. I went to church often and had my own bible where I started making revisions and edits.

We practiced krav maga for hand to hand fighting, and utilized bolt action rifles for ranged combat. When the chores were done the firing range was the first place i’d head. I was a crack shot.

After I had arrived at the monastery Aliziza began to talk. He said all sorts of wise things. Yahweh said that I deserved one friend who wasn’t a traitor.

That morning I sat beside the water, praying with my compatriot Zackariah. We were both a very calming presence and the animals often came to greet us.

That morning a pod of orcas came swimming up the river and started jumping in front of us. We sat and watched for a while before they came closer to shore offering their mouths to us.

Zackariah walked up and started rubbing the whale’s tongue.

“They say the orcas haven’t killed a single person since Julius Caesar chased the land octopi from our dimension. They are so grateful to be the apex predator in the ocean now.It’s totally safe to play with these cuddly fucks.” he said rubbing the orca’s tongue.

The orca leaned back, and motioned with his flippers to join us in the water.

“Join them” Alziza commanded.

Me and Zackariah waded into the water and the orca’s came up under us and before I knew it we were surfing across the ocean side by side.

“You know there is a spell to bring the land octopus back to our dimension so you can kill them” Zackariah said. “You know there are even people who still hunt them, a secret order started by Julius Caesar. Those guys are scary I tell you, you don’t want them to show up at your door. Anyone turns to stone and 1000 heads roll along with whatever land octopus they find. We’ve sent them a request to help us deal with the KKK but I doubt they will show.” Zackariah monologued.

As we surfed along I saw a number of simple octopus gathering and eyeing us suspiciously.

At the monastery we spent a great deal of time unlearning all the falsehoods that had been taught to us in school. We called them anti truths, things that meant the opposite of what they said.

“What was the world like when Julius Caesar was around?” I asked Zackariah.

“It was a time of monsters!” He responded. “They say that there was so much holy light during the reign of Julius Caesar that the men were 10 times as strong as they are today! They used to say a roman soldier was worth their weight in gold, as in all the gold in the world wasn’t worth the roman army. There used to be crocodiles so big they could swallow a buffalo whole. There were ground birds that terrorised the humans. There was a giant Beelzebub called the tarrasque that the roman army swarmed like ants. It’s said that Yahweh was so impressed with the roman army that he created siafu in their image” Zackariah monologued.

“So Julius Caesar was the changeling?” I asked. “Why are the KKK gathering so many alleged changelings if they know who its going to be?”

“That I do not know, we best head back. We don’t want to be late.” Zackariah responded.

The orca’s eventually brought us back to the monastery and we went inside. We were just in time for our meeting.

The KKK had been abducting alleged changelings from all across the Louisiana delta and doing who knows what with them. We were about to open the mail and see what other factions would join our cause, to liberate the abducted children.

Our leader was very old, 136 to be exact. He said he was only the 7th person since Abraham to breach the 120 year hard limit imposed by Yahweh after the deluge.

Our leader *Maximillion* stood in the chapel in front of all the monks of our monastery. There were other monasteries under our leader’s control as well, but this was our head base.

*Maximillion* held the letters of all those factions we had messaged for support and was ready to read them.

“We will start with this new church, these Mormons,” Max said.

He took the first sealed letter off of the table and opened it. His eyes bulged with anger as he read it.

“Remember the Alamo is all it says.” Max spat on the ground. “Godless heathens”

He took the next sealed letter from the table.

“Next the Cesarians.” He opened it and read it. “They won’t arrive until they see someone turned to stone, as always.” Max said with a smirk.

Max had two enchanted bibles that followed him around, Grimoire Noir and Grimoire Blanc. They hovered at his side while he read the letters.

Max grabbed the third letter “Next from the northerners, this Abraham Lincoln fellow.” He opened the letter and read it. “He has pledged 200 cavalry and 1000 troops. They will arrive the following day to us.” Max said, putting the letter back on the table.

Max grabbed the fourth and final letter off of the table. “Next we hear from our native american friends” he said, opening the letter and reading it. “They have pledged 200 braves. They have weapons, but could use any rifles we have to spare.” Max said.

He gathered the letters and started speaking with more authority. “We will rendezvous with the monks from the other monasteries and the braves before reaching Dixie. We will camp on the outskirts and await support from the northers. We leave immediately.”

And with that we were off. From our one monastery we had a force of 75 monks, some with horses. I rode upon mighty Alziza as we made the journey towards Dixie.

We knew we were getting close when we started seeing strange things. Deer with alligator jaw sewn on, cows with alligator jaws sewn on, and even buffalo with alligator jaws sewn on.

When we reached the rendezvous point we set up camp and waited.

Before long we were spotted by some klansmen. We would have fired upon them but they came waving a white flag. Their alligator jawed dogs had their tails between their legs.

“Hey ya’ll. We can see that you appear to be here for a siege of some sort, but we arn’t so bad! We are having a party, why not come and judge some southern hospitality for yourself” The klansman said waving his white flag.

We gathered our rifles and went to investigate. What we saw made me want to vomit. They had not only roasted up the whole farm, along with buffalo, iguana and fish. But they had a giant vat of soup cooking.

Jeff sat there tasting and salting the soup.

Then I saw Dale come out of the shadows holding a black child. He threw him in the soup.

“Changeling soup is my favourite” Dale belched.

“The black ones are the tastiest,” Jeff laughed.

I had seen enough, and loaded my rifle. I shot Jeff through the ear as he sipped at the ladle. Upon realising what had happened to all the alleged changelings the other monks began firing as well. 7 bullets hit Dale in various places.

The klan was ready and rifle and musket fire came at us from multiple directions.

We all had good bolt action rifles while most of the klan only had one rifle shot, then one pistol shot, then charged us with swords.

We got in a circle and were firing wildly in all directions, shooting down klansmen by the dozens.

I fired, loaded, fired over and over as hooded klansmen dropped like dead flies.

They reminded me of ghosts coming with their swords.

Klansmen chopped down monks with their swords and hit the occasional one with a gunshot. I saw gator dogs tear monks apart and I was terrified. Thankfully none came right at me.

Eventually the klansmen fled to regroup and we did a head count. We were down to 52 monks.

We scouted the area and found the braves and other monks looking for us. We were now up to 175 monks and 200 braves.

We walked until we were in sight of old Dixie and set up camp.

After a while a large force conveigned outside Dixie. I was alarmed to see 3 Dora’s leading the leading the troops. The one I had seen created along with two others who were made from the other body parts of Deb’s children. One of the Dora’s commanded the force that headed towards us.

There was a large number of klansmen as well as gator dogs, gator bears and some heinous monstrosities.

When they got closer, Dora took out a megaphone and screamed into it.

“Allow me to introduce you to my latest creations! Man bear pig, Pigman bear and man bear pig!” Dora screamed.

I noted the pig man bear hybrids that lined their ranks as they charged into firing range.

We fired all together at first then started firing at will.

The monstrosities charged at us in waves and many were killed before they came close.

But once they did they decimated our ranks. Gator bears tore through us like butter, ripping people apart. It was every man for himself as monks and braves fought back with sword, bow and arrows, rifles and clubs.

I fired a shot through the man bear pigs eye and loaded my rifle, then fired through the eye of a gator bear. It was utter chaos, but Yahweh favoured me that day and nothing came right at me.

I surveyed the battlefield and saw grimoire Blanc petrify a gator bear.

Grimoire noir pelted a pig man bear with napalm and it shrieked as loud as any pig.

The monstrosities and klansmen started to flee and we shot them as they ran.

Dora stood looking at her dead creations. I loaded my rifle to fire when I heard a loud buzzing. And then bird sized wasps came flying out of dixie and landed near us.

They then turned into beautiful women and started moving across the ground on their backs.

“Shoot em through the pussy!” Max screamed.

I fired right through where he said and the woman turned into a wasp I had shot it in the head.

Other monks were stung by the wasps along with many braves. They lay paralyzed and the wasps quickly stung them multiple times, laying their eggs.

I knew that within a few days they would hatch and the larvae would eat the men. IT was better to kill them and burn them to avoid such a grisly death. Manhawks they called them. Wasps that laid their young in people. I felt changed by the horrifying decision the stood before the paralyzed men.

Before long we had dealt with the wasps.

We started doing a headcount, seemingly losing at least half of our troops in all the chaos.

Then the monstrosities and klansmen came back for round two.

We unloaded into them as they charged towards us but they hit our reduced ranks hard.

Chaos ensued again as monks and braves were eaten. The gator bears chomped braves in half. The gator dogs swarmed around monks and tore them apart.

We fought valiantly but it seemed all hope was lost, but then there was a lull in the fighting and I turned towards the sunset.

Over the hill I saw Abe and his cavalry. They charged into our midst and shot the gator bears and dogs. Abe charged right towards Dora, beheading her.

Before long what was left of the klan was fleeing. There was not a single monstrosity left from the force we had battled.

The next day we parlayed with the KKK and they agreed to stop abducting changelings. AT least for the time being. We headed back to the monastery with our heads held high.

I record this here so that my contemporaries and future generations may have a true account of the horrors of the first changeling crisis.
