It was probably 6:30 o'clock on a Tuesday. I unlaced my black converse sneakers and put them down in the corner of my room before throwing myself into the center of my bed. I looked over to the desk besides me and took the laptop that typically sits there and opened it. I decided it would be the best choice to scroll on the internet while I thought about what I wanted to do. I scrolled and scrolled. I ate some of the spoiled chips I left in my room months before tonight. Soon, however my "friend" sent me an email. 

I groaned as I clicked on the email and read it to myself slowly, still munching on the not so good chips I had been eating before this.

Hey, Pal!

It's your buddy from work, Rob. I just took this super cool personality test a few hours ago and thought you might like it. Send me what you get! See you tomorrow at work!

I rolled my eyes as I read the email. At the same time I thought hey, I had just been looking for something to do, right? What I had been looking for had just placed itself neatly in my lap. A lame time killer. I sighed and put the chips aside as I clicked on the glowing blue link Rob had sent me. It took me to some lame quiz website, with letters on the screen that read "This Personality Test Knows You Better Than You! Take The 15 Question Quiz Now!"

How cheesy. I clicked continue. The test was as dumb as I thought it was. The first question was as simple as it gets.

"Out of these colors, what do you like best?"

There was red, green, purple, blue and pink. I chose blue and clicked the next question button.

"Out of these numbers, which do you like best?'

I clicked four then continued.

"Out of these statements, which of them is true to you?"

"I like to be around my friends." "I mostly spend time alone." "I like to live with friends and family." "I live by myself."

I questioned the second set of choices. I clicked the first choice and moved on.

"I would know if I was being watched."

I chuckled when I saw the words show up on my screen. If Rob did know anything about me, he knew I loved creepy gag tests. I clicked yes and continued.

"I enjoy to meet new people."

Not really. I prefer to be alone or with close friends. I picked no and moved on.

"I always make sure I lock doors and windows."

Doors? Sure. Windows not so much. I still picked yes  and moved to the next questions.

"I am alone right now."

Of course I am. Unless a cat counts. I picked yes.

"How far is your nearest hospital?"

I had moved to this  house not that long ago. Maybe it has been a year by now. Regardless, I had no idea. It wasn't within fifteen minutes of me, so I picked 20 miles.

"Somebody would know if I went missing."

Most likely. I picked yes.

"I am a likeable person."

Well, *I'd* like to think so. I picked yes

"My neighbors would look for me if I went missing."

My only neighbor was some crazy old cat lady. She hates me. Well, she hates everyone. I picked no.

"I am aware of my surroundings."

I mean, I am blasting music so loud I can't even hear myself think. I picked no.

"You should close your window."

I looked up to the open window next to my bed. How did this know about my window? I walked over and stuck my head out the window. The city still marched on below me and the hot spring breeze kept blowing. No creeps spying on me. I closed the window and locked it. A new prompt was already on my screen when I returned.

"I am prepared to fight for my life if I had to."

I paused for a second. I took a moment to text my mom and lock the door to my room. I then clicked yes.

"Did you have fun?"

Nope. This test is a bit creepy, even for me. I still clicked yes.

"Thank you for submitting your test! Please wait."

I watched the website load for a while. Great. I broke the stupid thing. I looked down at my phone and texted my coworker about his broken test when I heard a small ping from my laptop.

"Test results are in! Click here to view them."

I expected to see some kind of lame write up but what I saw chilled me to my very bone.

It was a picture of me, answering question seven  from my bedroom window.
