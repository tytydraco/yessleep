I opened a cabin door, trembling in fear, it’s been four hours since we ran from the bus, and we’ve been scared to return, otherwise we might run into that monster. We had no food or water. All of our stuff was back on the bus, the only thing I brought was my phone, but there’s no signal and it’s on 5 percent. Remember we have no resources, let alone a charger. Even if we did, we wouldn’t find an outlet. This was the reason why I’m searching this abandoned cabin, to find something useful, like a flashlight.

But this cabin felt very eerie, I felt like a million cobwebs and it reeked of mildew. I thought about turning on my phone flashlight, but figured it’ll drain its crappy battery down even more. So I’d figured I’ll conserve the battery and hope I’ll find something that’ll emit some sort of light. But luck was on my side, as I found a half used, old candle. But I figured it was better than nothing. So I grabbed it and tried to find more resources. But when I entered what seemed like a bedroom, I saw something that made me freeze.

It was a creature, with red glowing eyes, just standing still in a corner of the room.  

“T-Tom? I-Is t-t-that- you?” As I slowly started to move back in fear.

But it just came after me, I freaked out and jumped out of a shattered window, with that thing behind me, I usually never did well on those pacer tests and usually finished last on a school mile test in PE, but with my life on the line, I ran, faster than I’ve ever ran in my life. Until I finally managed to lose it, but even that, I was scared. One wrong move and I’ll be caught by that thing. I was deliberating by myself if I should head back to the others or stay here in case. But I chose to come back.

I tiptoed slowly and tried to stay low, so that thing wouldn’t see me. But when I was certain I was in the clear, I made a run for it. Fortunately I remembered where camp was, so I was able to navigate my way back, even in the dark. 

“Any luck finding things?” Mr. John asked us.

“Nope, I didn’t find a single thing” Jake responded 

“Me neither” Emily responded

“I did” I said “I found an half used candle” 

“Great, Jonathan” “I found two tents” Mr. John replied.

We all cheered Mr. John, like fans of a team at a match when they score a point. 

But we knew it was too dangerous out here, there could be some bear coming here, some dangerous people could also be here, too, and that monster. So we agreed we would take turns being on lookout. So I offered to go first. So everyone else entered their tents while I waited outside. I didn’t know how long I was waiting here, but I did remember seeing some people, wandering the forest with flashlights, headed in our direction.

“Is anyone here?” That group of people shouted.

“Wh-who are you guys?” I shouted back. 

I woke up the others in case it was some gang controlling these woods, or security guards. We had no weapons to defend ourselves. So we improvised and grabbed some sticks and rocks. We approached them carefully, ready to fight them using our “weapons” but it turns out it was a group of four, just like us. It turns out they were another group of band students, just like us. They managed to escape from Tom too, and they were exploring these woods to find some sort of help, only to find us. 

“Sorry but unfortunately-“ I said but then they cut me off.

“Don’t worry, we managed to grab our bags from the bus, we have a ton of food and water. We also found some tents that must’ve blown away from a storm” as one of the members of the group, Aiden, responded.

The group, who they called themselves “The bandy kids” consisted of four members, all boys. They were Aiden, a trombonist, Ethan, another percussionist like me, Chris, a bassoonist, and Ernest, an Oboist. 

We easily decided to merge into one big group. I mean, the more people the better, right? And we decided to come up with a plan on how to make it back home once we woke up.

So after we woke up after going to sleep and packed up, we devised the plan.

Our plan was to first find civilization and buy navigational equipment and maybe a map. The bandy kids had a ton of money, as their parents were all rich and let them spend a lot. So money wasn’t an issue for us. Now we couldn’t buy a plane ticket, as the bandy kids weren’t THAT rich, but we could walk. So we’ve decided to painstakingly walk back to North Dakota, in the city of Bismarck. As that’s where our high school was at. 

So we’re off!

We walked down some random trail, and then another, as we didn’t have a phone, I was the only one that brought my phone and I didn’t have signal. So we mainly had to guess where we should go. But we found our first saving grace, which was a sign. And miraculously it showed where the nearest town was, it was only 2 miles, or 3.22 kilometers, away. So we went in its direction, and after an hour of walking, we finally arrived. But the town looked abandoned. However we decided it was better than staying in the woods, so we searched the buildings for more resources.

But when we finished, it seemed like it turned dark, fast. So we decided this town would be a good place to rest for the day, so we picked a building to sleep in and went to bed, while one of us stayed up for lookout, just in case.

I slept for some time, until Ernest, the person on lookout, woke me up. I asked him why, but he didn’t respond. I noticed he was trembling in fear. So I followed him and he pointed to a tree. I looked closer and it looked like Tom, you know, the guy that got possessed by the monster. However, black dust then obscured his visibility, and then it disappeared. We should’ve stayed quiet, but we screamed instead. As what appeared to be around a hundred of them spawned around the tree, then they spotted us, and started chasing us. 

We didn’t have time to wake everyone up, we could only wake up Ethan, Aiden, and Chris. We quickly explained to them what was happening and they freaked out. We knew there was no point in escaping. So our only choice was to hide. We did see a ladder just barely poking out of the wall in the store we were in, so we climbed it and got to the stores attic. And all we could do was listen to Mr. John, Jake, and Emily scream, as it turned to silence. And I don’t know if dust got in my eyes, but it started to water, and before that, I started crying. My friends, director, all gone. As I saw those monsters leave the building they were in, but it was no time to continue sobbing, as they were headed into our building. We knew we couldn’t escape the store, so we had to defend ourselves. 

I found a few items, such as a broom and a block of wood as a shield. But we found a big one, a box of guns full of ammo. So we loaded our weapons and waited as those monsters climbed up the ladder. Then we started shooting them.

But those monsters weren’t harmed by those bullets at all. They just continued coming towards us, and we had no choice but to jump out of the window and hope we survived. So one by one my friends jumped out of the window, while I contemplated, but my life was on the line again. So I took a deep breath and got ready to jump. But I looked down again, but I saw a shitload of those monsters below me. 

I. Am. Fucked…
