When i was around 6 or 7 i would wake up in the middle of the night (always around 3 a.m to 4 a.m), to these weird hallucinations of strange shaped objects floating in my field of view, those objects varied in shape and size, but most of the time were most definitely similar to a cube, but not really... also, closing my eyes would make them more visible and intense.

What frightened me the most about these objects is that i could never tell their size, they would enlongate and compress in such an indecipherable manner that it was extremely unpleasant, borderline terrifying.

I vividly remember finding myself staring at the ceiling, crying out loud, and when my parents came to help me, i just wasn't able to explain what was wrong, most times i would just shut myself off from speaking. My parents would always stay with me calming me down until i fell asleep again.

One night, in between my hallucinations and tears, i was able to see a shadowy figure standing in the corner of my room beside my bed, i was able to spot it in my peripheral view as i was staring at the ceiling crying, i couldn't move or react out of the shock, only a muttered screech would come out from me. My parents noticed a few minutes later i was having another attack, they went to my room to help me, they were probably frustrated, scared and confused at this point because it happened every other night, everything unfolded as most nights after that.

Every night onward would be a combination of those strange shapes and hallucinations of shadow blobs in the ceiling, i would just block out and wait for the night to be over. But it wouldn't last for too long, it all suddenly stopped in a matter of weeks. Even the weeks after i would be sleepless, wandering around the living room with all the lights on. 

I still don't know what the shape hallucinations were for sure, but i've read people that were also having them, and then after some time they would outgrow them. Whenever i ask my parents about it they always attribute those night terrors to possible child abuse, medication, the room i would sleep in (which was rather big, so might have been intimidating), something i had seen somewhere, schizophrenia, they even mentioned demons lol, but i'm not entirely sure. Although, something that always comes to mind for comparison is some screensaver my dad used to have on his laptop, it featured colorful spiky shapes that turned into blobby ones (and then a triangle?), this is what my mind points at whenever i think about this.

As for the shadowy figure; I'm still not sure if it was even tied to the shapes or the shadow blobs at all. It could be comparable to sleep paralysis (which i get a lot), but it's so hazy, i can't tell if i couldn't move out of the shock or simply because i was half asleep, i just hope it was only my first sleep paralysis, because it only happened *once* around those years.
