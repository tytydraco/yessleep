Now, before you think “well that escaled quickly” let me explain.

I was recently going through a bunch of old garbage in my parents attic, mainly looking for old electronics I could take apart, or my old gameboy advance. On my search when moving one of the boxes, I noticed something in it, which was strange since I didn’t see anything in it, and if felt empty when I picked it up. At first, my head went wild thinking “OH MY GOD DID I JUST FIND MY DADS PORN COLLECTION!” But upon literally 30 second of thought, I realized that that was dumb, and I found my dad’s porn collection when I was like, 15. I picked up the book, I hadn’t seen it anywhere in the house previously and it didn’t even look like something my parents would own. It’s cover felt, sort of leathery, but with a velvety touch in some places. It was cold to the touch, looking all around it, I couldn’t find a title, or even a writer. I opened it up, the pages were yellowed and dull, the first page was nothing, just a blank page, the next page was ripped out, but on the third page, I saw it. 

There were these weird letters, or something, I couldn’t exactly tell you what they were, even thinking about it now gives me a headache, and below that there was an illustration on… something. The drawing was immaculate, but hard to follow, it showed a beast, think a wolf crossed with a gremlin. Most of the art was black, and I could just barely make out the outline of it, but one thing was clear, it had glowing white eyes that seemed to pierce into my soul even through the page. I shut the book, my headache becoming almost unbearable at that point, and rushed downstairs to ask my mother if she knew anything about a book with strange letters in it, with a weird creature on the third page. She had no clue what I was talking about, so she suggested I asked my dad. Going out into the backyard where he was blowing leaves. I asked him, told me to go to the local library, and the librarian might now something about it, before jokingly saying that he had been alive for thousands of years.

Book in hand I walked over to the library. Once I got there I noticed that the librarian looked exactly like he did last time I was there about 20 years ago. Chocking it up to just being a son who looked, uncannily similar to his father, I walked nervously over to him and asked him about the book. “Would you know anything about this book?” I asked quietly, I was never one of public speaking. After taking a quick look at it, he told me to follow him. He ended up leading me to a back room of the library and searched through and old file cabinet before handing me a piece of paper. He told me that it was a list, and to follow it exactly, before ushering me out of his establishment.

Once I drove home, I placed the book down on my coffee table and read the note.

1. Do not read paged 5, 12, and 28, this is for your own sanity

2. If you hear any noice it your house in between 12 am and 4 am, leave your room with a lit flashlight and track down where the noise came from, and it will repeat a few times. Once you reach the source, point the flashlight down and flash it rapidly until you hear a shrill screech. If you track it down to an object such as a vase or a cup, pour sugar water into it and and wait until you hear the same shriek.

3. If the noise is in the room you currently are in, quietly and calmly leave it. If the noise starts to follow you, the same flashlight trick should work.

4. Do not leave animal feeders outside

5. This is the most important one, if your lights go out, you have one minute until it gets in, find a hiding spot such as in a closet or under a bed, and this next step in an absolute must in the occurrence. Make sure any entrances to your hiding spot are blocked by salt.

Good luck.

Well Shit. I was looking for some old things to poke at the insides of, and now I’m cursed or something. But I guess this is my life now. So I proceeded to go on a shopping run for a flashlight, some spare batteries, sugar water, and salt. The cashier, a friend of mine, being intrigued by my blatantly strange choice of purchases, asked if I was “cursed or something?” I said “Well Obviously!” In a sarcastic tone, masking the fact that I was in fact cursed.

So my life has been in a basic cycle for that past few weeks. Wake up, go to work, get home, go to sleep, and pray that I don’t hear a sound, which, unfortunately, did happen a few times. 

But a few hours ago as of writing this, my lights went off. I immediately grabbed the salt and ran into my bedroom to hide in my closet, being sure to cover the doorway of it in salt. My lights came back a few minutes ago now, I don’t hear any noises anymore, but I’m not sure if its safe to leave. If anybody has any help, or actions I should do, please let me know, I don’t want to die to whatever was out there.
