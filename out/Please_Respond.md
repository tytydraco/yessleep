I'm so sorry. This never should have happened. He used me. I know, we never should have been together at all. I thought I was in love with him, Sarah. But you were right. I should have believed you. I wish I had listened. 


I never wanted to betray you. I never wanted to tell him where you are. I didn't know. You have to believe me. You have to believe that I never would have hurt you on purpose. You’re my best friend. That will never change. 


I left him three weeks ago when we had a fight about the girls on his phone. I thought that would be the end of it. I told him he would never change. That he would never be happy with just one woman. I’ve never seen him get so mad, Sarah. I wish you could have seen the fire in his eyes. It was like staring into the depths of hell itself. He growled “you know that isn’t true.” And I left. I didn't know what else to do. But everything in me knew it wasn’t *me* that he was talking about. At the time, that hurt more than anything.


I think he found you by following me. Last week, when we met at that little cafe on the corner of Pentz and Waugh? That must have been when he followed you home. We haven't seen each other since. Not… not since we talked about things. And I haven't seen him. You don't have to believe that part. But it is true. I promise. 


I didn't know he was there. Even now, I don't know where he could have been, but I know he was there. Watching us. Waiting. For you. He never cared about me. He used me to get back to you. I’m so stupid. 


He called me last night. I knew it was stupid. I knew talking to him wouldn’t fix anything. I knew it was dangerous. But I answered anyway, and I wish I hadn’t. He told me that he was visiting an old friend, and my stomach dropped. Something in me just knew he was talking about you. Some part of me deep inside that knew what he was. What he is. 


We talked for two hours, and the entire time he seemed far away. Distracted. His mind was elsewhere, and every part of me knew he was watching you. I hope you had your curtains closed. God, I hope you had your curtains closed. 


You didn’t deserve this, Sarah. I messed up. You moved just to get away from this creep and I… I led him right to you. This isn’t what I wanted. It wasn’t what I expected. He just… he seemed like he needed help. I thought I could help him. But I don’t think there’s anyone that can help him now. 


I'm worried about you. Please respond soon. Tell me he hasn't gotten to you already. I'm so, so sorry.
