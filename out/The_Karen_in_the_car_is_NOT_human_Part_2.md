You are NOT gonna believe this! 

We can't find Ray, anywhere. He's gone!! He vanished from the hospital and the authorities are looking for him. I know it's her, I know it's Karen back to claim her prize. I don't where he is, but I hope he is alive.

But as much as I like Ray, I have bigger problems to worry about. Ever since he disappeared on Saturday night, I've got this odd feeling I'm being watched. Maybe I'm being overly paranoid, but I can't help but feel like she's watching me from the windows. I almost get this feeling she's right outside the shower just staring at me. I know that's crazy, but after everything she's done, I'm not throwing any ideas out.

I came back to the pantry today to pick up my things from the locker. Our boss had instructed us that we would not be allowed back in the building for quite some time. What might have been a few days is quickly turning to a few weeks. And I decided it was time to grab my stuff.

I came in this morning around 10am to find Jesse talking to one of our co-workers, Jim. Jim was not a very talkative guy, he mostly kept to himself and only chimed in with those beautiful one liners. Jesse and Jim were talking about the Superbowl and how weird it was to see all of the satanic ritual stuff in the halftime show. I added that maybe Karen is part of the cult and I swear to God the power went out just as I said that. I don't know about you, but I was this close to just abandoning my stuff and hightailing it out of there. 

We each turned on our flashlights on our phones and we managed to find the breaker. That's when our hearts sank into our feet. 

The breaker was smoking and the switches were clawed apart. Broken pieces of plastic laid all over the tiled flooring. 

She was here, right here inside the pantry!!

I whispered to them to get out of here and call the cops. I turned around and walked with them back the way we came and that's when we smelled the most horrid, putrid, stench we had ever smelled. Jesse hurled as Jim and I held our shirts over our noses trying desperately to breathe. 

It smelled like rotting corpses that has been soaked in vinegar and fermented in s**t. Jim turned the corner to enter the main building and stopped dead in his tracks. I could see his hands shaking and his eyes doubling in size as he was completely overcome with terror. 

Jesse pulled herself up and saw Jim standing there.

"Jim! Jiiiim!"

No matter what she said he didn't move a muscle. He was in shock, and his breathing became labored as his knees began to buckle.

I took a single step backwards to get away and we both heard the same screech that came from the phone. Only now it was ten times as loud and made my eyes buzz from the shear force. 

Jesse stumbled backward and fell to the floor hard. I picked her up by her arm and pulled her to her feet. Then she too screamed so loud my ears rang like a bell. I turned to see what she was screaming at and I immediately regretted my decision.

I don't want to sugar coat it, or exaggerate in anyway. It was the most frightening thing I have ever seen in my entire life. She was literally eating his arm like a snake! Her jaw had detached and allowed her to swallow his entire left arm all the way up to the shoulder. She then pulled back and pulled back and ripped his arm clean off. The pain finally broke him out of the shock and he screamed for his life as he began to bleed out all over the floor.

This creature was clearly not human. It stood about six feet tall, had elongated limbs with razor sharp black claws, red piercing eyes, and two sets of teeth inside its wide mouth. Blood dripped down its chest and across its bloated stomach. It also had a set of sharp dark grey horns at the top of its head. It looked like a pale demon without wings, and the only way we knew it was a female was from the breasts poking out from its blood drenched dress and the long blonde hair that now stretched to halfway down its back. 

It was Karen, and she was absolutely terrifying. I'll never get that image out of my head for the rest of my life. 

I couldn't take it anymore and I just bolted out of there. Jesse got in my car and we drove off like bats out of hell. It wasn't until I reached my apartment when we finally breathed and Jesse called 911. We told them that Karen had come back and attacked Jim and that he needed an ambulance immediately. We never told them about the fact that she isn't human, otherwise they wouldn't have believed us. 

Jesse is going to spend the night with me. She doesn't want to be alone and I don't blame her. Frankly I don't want to be alone either. I made damn sure to bolt my door and lock every single window. I even nailed them shut so she couldn't just waltz I her. She is going to have a fight if she even thinks of coming here.

All I can say, is that there is a monster among us hiding as a beautiful blonde. Do NOT talk to her, do NOT engage with her in anyway. And if she sees you then find some help, anyone willing to help you and stick with them. Never be out there alone, especially in the dark of night. 

I don't know what's going to happen next. If we will even survive this, but we are not going down without a fight.

I'll try to update when I can.

John and Jesse.
