There are moments in life that we can call pivotal—moments when you know that if time travel existed, you'd only have to go back and change one thing, and your entire life wouldn't be the same; you'd have married someone else, moved to a different country, or maybe you wouldn't be alive at all.

The first such moment in my life began when I was Twelve years old. A school teacher named Miss Jacobs bullied me relentlessly. I was an odd child, I guess, perhaps a bit autistic, but she knew how to show me up in class, make me cry in front of everyone else, and seemed to relish the fact that I was the only one she did this to in a class of thirty pupils. This, of course, meant everyone else had permission to taunt me as they saw fit.

One day, I was up in my treehouse, i lived not far from the school, the usual gang decided their usual taunting and they was climbing up the ladder and throwing rotten vegetables at me, in one insane moment i just went in a mad rage and pushed the ladder while one of the bullies  was on it, his head hit a rock on the ground, plenty of witnesses to see that was a manslaughter and things spiralled from there as my life path has just led me in and out of prison ever since, no luck in life, no luck with the women, can't hold a job for long but I do make quiet a decent amount of money selling weed to stoners and crack to crackheads. All because in one really stupid moment I hit back with devastating consequences as a child.

The second big moment is the real story here, though: I had seen RealismDollz, I'd seen those documentaries, and I wanted to call it pathetic, but my whole life was pathetic. I mean, I sell drugs for a living, so who am I to judge, right? So I found myself browsing through websites, and I saw the prices had come down, the quality and realism had improved, and lately I had been seeing all this talk about AI and robots. Something was shifting in society and technology, and maybe... maybe anybody getting in on this niche trend is just ahead of the curve, getting in on the ground floor, and I'm being ahead of everyone else for once. The niggling thought in the back of my mind was, 'Why is society, why is the world going in my direction?' I put the thought aside; I found a doll I liked. She, or it, had lovely curly two-tone blonde hair—dark roots , blue eyes, and a big bust. And the face of an angel.

In some sense, the Parcel guy's arrival with my new girl was like a wedding; insofar as I was excited to just sign the form and we go on our honeymoon.

I know it's a trope that a dealer shouldn't get high on their own supply, but I recently got a decent-sized package of the most potent mushrooms I could get. My philosophy has always been to sell quality, not quantity; sell the strongest and purest shit, and people come back—you don't want customers dead or going somewhere else. I ate some just for a buzz while I got this doll out of the box;

Sex with the doll was actually much better than I thought, but then I had an idea. I was looking at the mushrooms and looking at the doll: "I could make this even better."

I don't know how many I ate. But I'm going to say I ate a lot; it was one of those experiences where it creeps up slowly—a buzz at first and a full-blown trip much later than normal—so I was perhaps under the impression at first that I wasn't taking enough . Big mistake!

The doll came to life, but also not. I was aware of both worlds: the world where I didn't take the drug, and the doll is just sitting there with a blank stare, and at the same time, aware of a vague outline of a world where somehow this doll is alive.

**"Ah... finally, we can communicate. I have been trying to contact one of you humans directly for the last few thousand years"** the doll said.

*"I'm sorry... what?"* That's all I could say. I was unusually calm and polite, but I knew I'd eaten the mushrooms, so at the same time, it wasn't a surprise.

**"Well, we can't communicate in the way you do. We actually don't have voice boxes on our planet, and we don't do radio, and even we have not mastered light-speed travel yet."** That was unusually logical and concise for my typical drug-induced trip, i thought .

*"I'm sorry, but... you do realize you are a sex doll, and I am on a bad trip. What does any of what you said mean?"*

The doll seemed to sigh. **"Okay, are you aware of any concept of infection or invasion?"**

*"Sure, like a virus in my body or someone invading a country"* I said, wondering if my own sex doll thought I was an idiot.

I tried to process this, and all I could say is, *"So you are a mushroom?"*

**"I'm a bit more than that."**

The doll seemed to perk up. **"Well, we invade Earth by mind viruses created by humans eating mushrooms, which influences your decisions, your science and tech, so that eventually you create us on Earth, bit by bit."**

*"Okay, you are a mushroom and a Bond villain."*  I thought for a moment, *"Let's, for argument's sake, say that it is true—that I am not just a weirdo on a bad trip talking to a sex doll...why are you telling me about your evil plan?"*

The doll looked shocked; I know they usually do, but it looked even more shocked than normal.

**"Evil? My dear child, we are here to save you. You are, at most, 100 years from terrible, slow and painful deaths, either by nuclear war or climate change. No, no, you have it all wrong. We are going to save you from suffering, and in return, we get your planet. You're a businessman; I'm sure you understand a good deal when you see it."**

*"So, what exactly is the plan here? You're influencing society, and we build sex robots, and this reduces the population, but unknown to us, or at least most of us, the sex robots are actually you, so no spaceships, laser battles in space, or mothership blowing up key landmarks, but just, on the sly, a peaceful and secret transition."*

**"Exactly!"** the doll said enthusiastically. **"We don't have technology like that; those ideas are from human minds. You look at your airplane and rocket and just extend the idea out and assume, same with your guns, bombs, and war. You think, 'Well, we do it, and they do it bigger,' but that's not what we are doing, though."**

Somehow, I saw a flaw in this: *"So, how did you get the mushrooms here?"*

**"Oh, that was ages ago. We saw potential planets we could move to and sent out rockets, like you do, but to seed planets with our fungus. Takes too long for us to get anywhere directly"**

I raised an eyebrow. *"But how are you arriving here in the sex dolls? See, this is how I know this isn't real; you can't be real. I'm a thinking being; I took a psychoactive substance, and my own brain is hallucinating and debating itself with a paranoid idea."*

**"Finally, a real question. You're smarter than you look, human. Okay, so would you agree we are both an entity inside the universe? Suppose I am just a doll; do you agree that the doll is not an entity outside the universe?"**

I was just getting increasingly irritated at this point *"Well, yes, I can say that about the toaster here too. I know the toaster came out of the same Big Bang I did, along with everyone and everything else."*

**"Good answer, human."** The doll seemed to smile.

*"Can you stop calling me human? My name is Jake. Do you have a name?"*

**"I do have a name... Jake, but if you tried to say it, then you'd die of a brain aneurysm."**

*"Look, just cut to the chase... whatever you are. okay?"*

The doll went on:

**"Jake... if you intended to have children, what, in practical terms, are you doing? You take human design and propel it into the future; your child is in the universe even if you are not around, but the child carries a part of you to live on. You are not aware that the mushrooms are part of our design, and so is the AI you are building. It's a long way around compared to your ideas of an invasion, but ultimately, over time, that is what it is. Obviously, for it to work, we have to relocate initially in human form, for everyone to go along with it. It's all information; that's all anything is, Jake. The building blocks of anything can just be regarded as a program and a construct."**

I'd had enough. I picked up the doll and threw it in the neighbour's garbage can. 'Whatever you are, fuck you and fuck this stupid trip,' I went back inside and finally slept it off.

When I woke up, I had a massive headache. There seemed to be a bit of a leftover glow from the mushrooms I took, as if I were still high. I looked at the clock, and I'd been asleep for as long as 18 hours. 'Wow, that is strong shit!' I grabbed a bit of paper initially to note down a quick calculation of what kind of money I could deal these shrooms out for, but as I started writing, I started drawing, almost automatically, but I knew it was from my own head. I drew up a circuit design for a microchip and an address for the patent office.

I don't know anything about electronics, chips or circuits ...yet what I drew that day seems to make sense and after an internet search I cannot find anything like it.

Arthur C Clarke once said that  : "**Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not**. **Both are equally terrifying,"**

Well our situation is a bit worse than that, the doll randomly appears seated in places in my house, I never see it move, I never hear it speak, it just randomly will 'jump scare' me , I'll be seated watching a movie and  I just look out of the corner of my eye and it's just there next to me as if it's enjoying the movie or I'll come home and it's moved from wherever it was. I'll just be laying in bed and it appears next to me randomly when I TRY to sleep, I also see it outside when i go out but nobody else does , yes i do try to leave the house and that doesn't work.

I know what it wants, it wants me to file the patents to move it's tech forward, a haunting in the form of a mind virus that will not go away until I spread the new tech information or die with it.

I'd like to say that one day I'll get used to the doll just appearing randomly, that its extra-terrestrial idea of trolling me until i die will just get old . But I hold out little hope of that.

I've no doubt this has happened and is happening to others, I see news reports quiet regularly about discarded dolls, police get called because people think they saw human remains, people make a big joke of it, but it's no joke. I know I'm not the only one and I'm here to warn people.

We spent so long looking up to the sky for the visitors and regarding them as having tech like we have that we never realized they are already here.

The Invasion Is well underway.
