&#x200B;

Sasha and I watched with a heavy heart as Samara was laid out on the blackened metal slab of the cremation chamber.

&#x200B;

It wasn’t much of a goodbye, but it was something. Samara and I had never been all that close… but I had still considered her to be something of a friend, and I thought she deserved better than an impersonal funeral in the crematorium of 0-5. As the slab rolled into the cremation chamber, Sasha and I quietly took a step back, watching as she disappeared inside. We heard the burners activate and then we could feel the heat and smell the burning flesh.

&#x200B;

We’d become intimately familiar with the smell over the past few days.

&#x200B;

A few other dead or dying patients sat scattered in the room, quietly waiting their turn. The few grim, dead eyed nurses who tended to them weren’t able to do much for them aside from give them a quiet overdose of some kind of sedative, and let them drift away so they could at least die peacefully before their bodies were burned. Sasha turned to look at them, but didn’t dare approach them. Her eyes settled on a nearby Karah, who hadn’t quite died yet and I could almost feel her heart sinking at the sight of him. I wondered if she knew him.

&#x200B;

The door to the crematorium opened and Dr. Meehan stepped inside. It hadn’t even been half an hour since we’d seen her last but she looked even more exhausted than she had before, with heavy dark circles under her eyes.

&#x200B;

“I’ve spoken with the Administrator. A full quarantine of the clinic has been enacted,” She said quietly. “Although hopefully it won’t last long and won’t need to be spread to the rest of the hospital.”

“You heard something?” Sasha asked.

“I have. Apperantly the Imperium has sent someone to investigate the situation. They traced it back to a werewolf bar in town. A number of our patients had mentioned it. They found Gutworm eggs in the kitchen. They’d been mixed in with the food.”

&#x200B;

My brow furrowed.

“Mixed in how?” I asked, “Some kind of freak accident or…?”

“I don’t know, and right now I really don’t care. The Imperium will probably be carrying out a full investigation into the why of it. But what this means for us, is that they should be able to track down anyone who’s at risk of infection and bring them to us. We can quarantine the ones without symptoms, and deal with the ones who are. Once they do that there might just be a light at the end of the tunnel.”

&#x200B;

Those words only offered a hollow comfort.

“So… are we going back to work, or are we staying in here to wait our turn?” Sasha asked, still a little bitter.

&#x200B;

“You can drop the attitude, Peters. I understand that you may not agree with what I’m doing right now, but I’m not going to start throwing people into the crematorium without a damn good reason. You and Currie are currently displaying no symptoms. Currie… I don’t believe that you were exposed. Although you, Peters I’m less  sure of. You were asleep in the next room while Samara was symptomatic for some time. There’s a possibility… albiet a slim one that you might be infected. So for now you can quarantine in room 503. I have a few other low risk members of the staff in there. If you remain asymptomatic after 24 hours, then we’ll talk about sending you back to work.”

“The rules of 0-5 say 48 though,” Sasha said.

“I know what the rules say. The rules don’t account for the sheer volume of patients we have right now. We don’t have the luxury of 48 hour quarantines anymore. So I’m making a judgement call. If you’re infected, we’d be seeing the symptoms before the 24 hour mark. So it’s 24 hours now.”

&#x200B;

Her tone said not to argue, so we didn’t.

“Currie, I need someone keeping an eye on the patients in 510 to 520. So put your PPE back on.”

“I thought I was still on break?” I asked.

“That was before I had people lying to me about their exposure. This is after. Get your PPE on.”

She left without another word.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The final influx of patients came around 6 hours later. I’d mostly lost track of time. By my guess, it was around 58 hours after Artie had died by that point.

&#x200B;

Everything just felt as if it had descended deeper and deeper into chaos. I tried to keep my head down. Tried to keep working, although it was hard. My eyes were heavy. I was struggling to focus. I *needed* to sleep, but I couldn’t. There wasn’t enough time to sleep.

&#x200B;

The rooms were uneven. Some of them had ten to fifteen patients in them. Some only had two or three. Dried blood was smeared across the floors. At one point, I watched security drag a crying vampire back into her room when she tried to run for the door. She kept pleading with them, saying that she didn’t want to die like this. But they still handcuffed her to the bed.

&#x200B;

Two hours later she was slumped over on the floor, her entrails spilling out of her as two nurses in hazmat suits sprayed her body with hot steam to kill the worms. I’d always heard that vampires were tough to kill… but seeing one slumped on the floor like that was… the memory of it seared itself into my mind.

&#x200B;

People were sleeping in the designated safe zones and all of the vending machines in there had been broken into. A few kind souls had brought some food from the outside, and the containers were scattered on the floor. I always thought that the rules of each section were meant to maintain some kind of order. This was anything but order.

&#x200B;

And through it all, Dr. Meehan tried to keep things running.

&#x200B;

I hadn’t seen her sleep a wink since I’d first come back on shift, several hours… or I suppose by this point it was days, ago, and though she tried to put on a strong face I knew that it was catching up to her. She slurred her words more, and when she was’t talking to anyone I noticed her space out a few times, standing mindlessly in the middle of the hall, her eyes faraway and unfocused before something else demanded her attention and pulled her back into the madness. The nightmare just carried on, only now most of us were too tired to be afraid anymore. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew that if I started puking up blood, I’d probably just regard it with a resigned frustration than actual terror and looking back, the very idea of that disturbs me.

&#x200B;

Like a mindless tin soldier I just marched on, going through the motions as one by one our patients died… and I’m almost ashamed to admit that there came a point where their deaths simply stopped mattering to me.

&#x200B;

There had just been so many…

&#x200B;

So, so many.

&#x200B;

I just couldn’t morn for them anymore.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I was in 512 when the nurse beside me started vomiting up blood. The name tag on his scrubs said Julian, and I’d seen him around before but we’d never really spoken much before then. We’d been bringing some water to one of our patients, a new arrival who probably only had a few hours left when he started retching.

&#x200B;

I looked over at him, watching as he stumbled to the side to try and get to the nearest garbage can in time before spilling his guts into it.

&#x200B;

I could see the red around his mouth, and gave him a cold, weary look. Slowly he wiped his mouth.

“How long?” I asked.

“T… three hours…” He panted, “I’m alright.”

“You’re dying.” I replied plainly. He took a step toward me and I took a step back.

“And?” He asked, “I’m not the only one. If I say anything, Meehan’s gonna put me in a bed and let me die with the rest of them. She’ll send me off to the crematorium. I can still help here, and they can’t infect me a second time.”

“But you can still infect the rest of us!” I snapped, “What about those of us who aren’t infected!”

“Yet,” He said. “Make your peace with it. Cuz we’re all going into the crematorium when this is done.”

&#x200B;

I gave him a wide berth as he pushed past me, before tending to one of the patients, and I left him in that room, giving him a disgusted look as I walked back into the hall.

&#x200B;

I briefly considered going and telling Dr. Meehan, although I knew what she’d do… and a part of me did agree with Julian. Not about us all ending up in the crematorium, but about still doing what you can. I decided to just keep avoiding him, and let the worms deal with him, and moved on to 513.

&#x200B;

That was when I heard the screaming down the hall.

*“We’ve been going for over 60 fucking hours, Sylvia! You can’t do this!”*

*“The rules in this case are clear, Croft.”* Dr. Meehan replied. Unlike the other speaker, she didn’t yell. “*The quarantine remains in place until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped. We need to remain here until 48 hours after the last patient has died to ensure that we aren’t going to bring these worms right back out of this clinic!”*

&#x200B;

*“Oh, so now it’s what the ‘rules’ say, is it?*” Croft snarled. *“You don’t get to cite the rules when it suits you and abandon them when it doesn’t! They either apply or they don’t!”*

&#x200B;

I left 513 to go down the hall a little bit. I could see a small throng of staff members standing around Dr. Meehan and one of the other nurses, a guy who was a little younger than me.

“0-5 is not designed to handle an outbreak of this size,” Dr. Meehan said. “I have had to make some judgement calls, but I have made them to try and manage this situation as best I can! As the most senior member of the staff on site right now, it is *necessary* for me to make these calls. If you do not like the way things are being run, take it up with the Administrator but until then, sit down. Shut up. Do your job.”

&#x200B;

“I’ve been doing my job!” Croft growled, “I’ve been doing it for the past two and a half days! I’ve barely slept! I haven’t showered! I’m covered in blood and I’ve watched two of my friends die because of this! I watched *you* send them to the fucking crematorium!”

“*Your friends lied about being infected!”* Dr. Meehan replied, her voice a bitter growl that almost made me uneasy. “I have asked time and time again, and there are still people lying about it.”

“Because if anyone tells you the truth, they die!”

&#x200B;

*“THEY’RE ALREADY DEAD!”* Meehan snapped, *“YOU’VE SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND!* ***YOU’VE. SEEN IT.*** There is no cure for this! There is *nothing* we can do and if we don’t maintain a strict quarantine then we are going to be letting this parasite back out into the world and it is going to kill *more, and more, and more* people! YOU KNOW THIS!”

“Then why not use them?” Someone else replied, “Let *them* take care of these people so we don’t have to risk our necks! Let them handle this so we can go home!”

“*Any* of us could be infected at this point!” Dr. Meehan replied. “Any of us could be infected and we would have no idea! We have maintained a limited number of staff in 0-5 since yesterday. We won’t know who is safe and who is not until the parasite has run its course, after we’ve stopped seeing symptoms! *That* is when quarantine ends, *so do not whine to me* about this situation! Do not come to me and tell me it’s not fair, because *this is what we* ***need*** *to do!* Believe me. I don’t want to be here any more than you do! But we have a *responsibility* here! So *grow up!* *Do your job!* And-”

&#x200B;

Croft lunged for Dr. Meehan, hitting her in the face and sending her to the ground. He tried to pounce on her, trying to kick her in the ribs, but several people pulled him off.

&#x200B;

While they did, a few others went for Dr. Meehan, one of them grabbed her by her coat, and ripped a keycard away from her.

“I’m not doing this anymore…” I heard them pant, “I’m getting the hell out of here!”

&#x200B;

They took off, and three others followed them.

“NO!” Meehan cried, before getting up to try and chase them.

&#x200B;

The three were running down the hall toward me. I could see that the one with the keycard had bloodshot eyes. He was sick.

&#x200B;

That idiot…

&#x200B;

I didn’t think. I moved to stop them, grabbing the one with the keycard by the sleeve as he passed me. He whirled around, eyes intense and glaring as he struggled to get free.

&#x200B;

*“I want to go home!”* He snarled, before pulling out of my grasp.

&#x200B;

Dr. Meehan reached us just as he got free and grabbed him, desperately trying to wrestle her key card back.

*“You’ll contaminate the entire Clinic you selfish idiot!”* She roared. His friends tried to pull him away from her, but Dr. Meehan was fighting too hard. I could see an unfamiliar fury in her eyes as she drew back a fist and sucker punched him in the throat.

&#x200B;

His grip on the key card slipped, and Dr. Meehan collapsed backward. The idiot who’d tried to take it retched, before vomiting all over the floor. It splashed on the shoes of his friends, and onto Dr. Meehan.

&#x200B;

I could see the worms writhing in the puddle he left behind. His knees buckled as he collapsed to the ground, his eyes wide and horrified.

“No…” He rasped, “No, no, no… I’m not… I’m gonna go home… I’m gonna go home…”

&#x200B;

His buddies scrambled away from him, and Dr. Meehan hastily tried to do the same.

&#x200B;

But she was already too late.

&#x200B;

Twisting worms covered in blood and bile clung to her coat. I could see the terror in her eyes as she tried desperately to swat them away from her, but she couldn’t get them all. I heard her hiss in pain as it bit into her. I heard her panicked, hyperventilating as they buried into her. Digging into her chest, her arms, her neck…

&#x200B;

I saw them squirming beneath her skin, digging into her flesh, leaving little trickles of blood behind. She tried in vain to pull them out, tried to brush them off, but they had already taken hold of her.

&#x200B;

*“No…”* Her voice was cracked and panicked, she almost sounded as if she was finally about to break, finally about to cry.

&#x200B;

I could do nothing but watch as the worms dug into her body and when they were gone, she lay there, mortal terror written all over her face.

&#x200B;

She looked at the man who’d taken her key card with wide, mortified eyes. She didn’t say a word to him.

&#x200B;

His buddies dragged him off, leaving us alone, and I saw Croft leaving with them. Dr. Meehan sat silent for a moment. She looked back toward the staff who’d been watching her argument with Croft.

&#x200B;

None of them said a word to her.

&#x200B;

Slowly she stood on trembling legs. She closed her eyes, trying to steel herself for what was coming next, before finally she took off down the hall, toward one of the less crowded patient rooms. I was the only one who followed her.

&#x200B;

She’d sank down onto one of the beds when I found her. Her skin had gone a shade paler and she still had a faraway, shellshocked look in her eye.

“Dr. Meehan?” I asked quietly.

&#x200B;

She didn’t even look at me.

“Sylvia?”

Her head moved slightly.

“Get out of here, Currie…” She said, her voice a hoarse, trembling whisper.

&#x200B;

I didn’t move.

“Just… just leave me be…”

“Is there anything I can get for you?” I asked. It seemed like such an asinine question. I knew that there was nothing I could offer that could help with her current situation, and she knew it too.

Still, she answered me.

“50 mg of propofol… and 150 mg of rocuronium…”

An overdose of a sedative and a paralytic agent…

I didn’t need to do the math to figure out what she wanted.

&#x200B;

“I’m already dead, Jamie.” She said, looking over at me. She’d never used my first name before. “This is what is necessary… it’s been what is necessary for the others and it’s what is necessary for me. Give me the drugs… and send me to the crematorium. Let me just… let me just get it over with. I don’t want to sit here, waiting for the end to come. Let me just get it over with.”

&#x200B;

I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of her request, before giving a slow nod.

“Alright,” I finally said.

I left her for a moment and quietly gathered up the supplies she’d asked for.

A few minutes later, I returned to her with two syringes. She’d removed her PPE, and left her key card on the table. She sat, dead eyed on the hospital bed, staring at the corpse in the bed across from her. Someone had already killed the worms that had come out of it. They were just waiting to be collected.

&#x200B;

I set the needles beside her. She didn’t even look at them. She just wordlessly passed her key card over to me.

“Keep this close,” She said softly. “Someone else might try and take it… and if they succeed, enact a mass sterilization. It should… it should stop them… before security has to. Try to be in one of the quarantine rooms before it triggers.”

&#x200B;

“You should be giving it to whoever the Administrator appoints to take over,” I said.

“Currie, the Administrator couldn’t pour water out of a boot if you wrote the instructions on the sole. And besides. They aren’t in here. They aren’t equipped to know who should be taking over. I am. You understand the severity of this situation. *You* will make the right choices, even if they don’t feel like it. Take it.”

&#x200B;

She put the keycard in my lap, and I quietly pocketed it.

&#x200B;

Dr. Meehan let out a weary sigh before reaching into her pocket to take out her cell phone.

“I suppose I should call my husband, shouldn’t I?” She asked. “You should go, Currie.”

“And do what?” I asked.

“Your job. We have patients out there.”

“And I’m with one right now.”

&#x200B;

She gave me an unimpressed side eye, but the venom in it faded quickly. She sighed, before looking away from me and making her call. I sat there quietly as she said her goodbyes, and when she was done, I helped her inject the needles.

&#x200B;

I stayed until she drifted away, and when she was gone I left her for the other nurses to take to the crematorium. I never saw them take her. Two hours later when I walked past her room, she was simply gone.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

87 hours after Artie had died, the last of the patients we had in quarantine passed away. 9 hours after that, the last of the staff we put in quarantine were dead.

&#x200B;

There was no miracle cure.

&#x200B;

No moment of triumph.

&#x200B;

No turning of the tide.

&#x200B;

Just a slow ticking of the clock, marked by death after death after death. We made it out through simple attrition, just as Dr. Meehan had always said we would.

&#x200B;

We had 35 people working in 0-5 when the quarantine had first been put in place. There were 12 of us were left when we finally sealed ourselves in the quarantine rooms.

&#x200B;

During the 4 days since Artie had arrived, we’d had an influx of 344 patients.

&#x200B;

Only about 37 of them were found to have no sign of infection.

&#x200B;

We remained in quarantine for the manditory 48 hours after the final death, and during that time the Administrator enacted a mass sterilization to ensure that none of the worms remained alive. And when quarantine finally lifted, those of us who had survived it shuffled out into the clinic, dead eyed and hollow.

&#x200B;

They left mostly without goodbyes, although Sasha and I lingered by each other for a while. We didn’t talk about the events of the past week.

&#x200B;

Honestly we barely talked to each other at all. We just sort of sat together in a small resturant attached to the main hospital, watching people go by with an uneasiness. We didn’t actually touch the small meals we’d ordered. Neither of us had much of an appetite. We just sat with each other, keeping each other company and serving as a reminder that we hadn’t just lived through the hell we’d lived through alone.

&#x200B;

That was almost enough.

&#x200B;

Almost.

&#x200B;

I still have nightmares about being back in 0-5.

&#x200B;

I have nightmares about worms. About bodies splitting open and people vomiting up blood. Artie panicking in his final moments, Samara crying as the worms chewed their way out of her, Dr. LeRoy’s screams as he was dragged off toward the crematorium, the stink of burning human flesh that became a quiet afterthought and Dr. Meehan’s silent resignation to her fate.

&#x200B;

All of it… burned into my mind, and odds are that I’ll never forget it. I put in a request for a transfer to another department two weeks after the quarantine incident.

&#x200B;

I decided that my skillset might be better used in research. I got the idea from Sasha. She’s putting in the same request. Maybe if we’re lucky, we’ll still get to work together.

&#x200B;

I’m not going to pretend that I have high hopes that what I’ll see there will haunt me any less than what I saw at the Clinic. But at least I won’t be in that Clinic anymore. I won’t have to go to work every day, dreading the moment where another Artie walks in through the door and they announce another Code Lime, and drag me right back into that hell.

&#x200B;

I can’t do it a second time.

&#x200B;

I can’t.

&#x200B;

I know that we do what we have to do.

&#x200B;

We don’t have to like it. But we do have to live with it.

&#x200B;

And I have enough to live with right now.
