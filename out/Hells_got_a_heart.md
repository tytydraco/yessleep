It’s just another night at the diner, the only customer being cranky old man. How much longer you gonna take to bring me my food? The old customer in the corner booth asks for the third time. Noah doesn’t respond only rolling his eyes. Scrambling the eggs without passion, Noah readies the plate before giving it to the old customer. Before the customer can think of something to complain about, Noah is already back in the kitchen prepping more food. Hey, turn the TV on, it's too quiet in this diner! Noah sighs but quickly grabs the remote and turns the news on, turning back to prep the food. He doesn't pay too much attention to what's being said on TV but hear's Something about some big fires downtown. Who watches the news these days anyways? Noah thinks to himself as he tunes out the TV.  

It’s 8: 45, the diner is closing in fifteen minutes. Noah tells the old man, as he cleans the tables for the night. I’ll leave whenever I feel like leaven. The old man chuckles' out his remark. Noah ignores him, just shaking his head in disdain. Finishing the tables he starts on the floor with a broom. No wonder this place looks like a dump, if this is the way you're cleaning it. The old man continues to gripe and ramble on. What are those books on the table you got over there about? The old man questions as he points to them, looking for another reason to take a jab at him. Oh, they’re just about reincarnation, just a hobby nothing more. Noah barely cares to explain to this jerk what his hobbies are. Oh yeah, of course there are. The old man laughs. Noah leaving the broom leaning on the wall, looks back up at the TV, having heard enough. Hearing more about the fires downtown getting worse and even about a hole forming in the middle of them, he shuts the TV off. HEY! I was watching that! The old man yells out. We’re closed, so you're going to need to leave. Noah responds, picking the Broom back up to finish the floor. Well, I’m not done eating. The old man says defiantly. I’ll get you a To go box, but you are leaving. The old man snatches the To go box from Noah’s hand. Fine I’ll leave, but I’m talking to your manger Tomorrow morning! He stands up food in hand, as he slowly walks to the door. Please do and have a good night. Noah smiles, slamming the door in his face. 

Just as he finishes the floor, he feels the vibration of his phone ring in his back pocket. He sighs as it’s his mother. Are you home yet. She asks in a worried tone. No mom, I had to work the closing shift tonight. He says as he starts the dishes. Noah sighs again as he has this same conversation at least once a week. I just worry about you. You live across the county alone in that apartment building and have to walk across the city. Then the fires downtown, it's all just so much. Her tone even more worried look mom I'm fine ok. I’m doing the last of my chores as we speak, and I can take the bus if it makes you feel better. Noah speaks as if trying to calm her fears. Ok, as long as you're not walking tonight. You never know what creepy crawly’s are out and about. Your right you never know. Noah replies, finding it funny how much she still talks to him like a kid. OK, I gotta go mom. Much love. He leaves his phone back in his pocket.  

 Putting the last dish under the counter, he washes his hands off. Grabbing the full trash bag out of the trash can, he remembers his worn-out leather jacket before heading out the back door. Before closing and locking it for the night, he looks back with a smile as he flicks the lights off. Now in the cold of night Noah pulls on his jacket, as he swings the trash bag into the dumpster. 

Noah walking down the sidewalk to the bus stop, before sitting on the bench. Noah sitting there shivering it the cold, as he thinks about his life. Moving away from his hometown to a big city. I mean why would I come here, my job sucks and everyone I know is a world away from me. He mutters, almost laughing at his life choices. I do love my doggo though. He says giving himself a good chuckle. Noah stands up as the bus Finally arrives. What took you so long, you’re almost ten minutes late. He asks Walking up the bus steps, realizing he’s the only passenger so far. I’m here, aren't I plus driving around these fires and all the weird stuff goin on. You're lucky I’m here at all. The bus lady glaring at him, but in mock offence. Taking a seat a few rows from the front, Noah looks out the window. As the bus turns, he can see the orange glow of the fires in town. So how bad are they. Noah asks, thinking they gotta be bad to see from here. From what I heard, it bad and only getting worse. The lady answering his question.  

Huh I wonder why there- Noah is cut off as something burst up through the road, hitting the front of the bus. The bus flipping back, landing upside down. Noah's ears are ringing, but he can hear screaming faintly. His vision now blurry, he pulls himself up by the seat but falls back down. After a few moments the ringing in his ears stop, and his vision returning to normal. A few deep breaths later, he again lifts himself up by the seat. Managing to stay up right this time. Noticing that the screaming has stopped, he looks to the front of the bus, seeing a sight of horror. The driver side windshield broken through, and the driver missing. Oh shit. Noah screams, falling back to the ground at the sight. He hears a loud thump on the under belly of the bus. Looking up he hears another, then another. It’s coming closer he thinks. Scrambling to his feet once again he sprints to the back of the bus, pulling the lever as fast as he can. 

The door falling open, Noah makes a run for the nearby convenience store. A few feet from the door, Noah glances back at the bus. It’s a woman with bright pink hair and glowing yellow eyes, standing on top of the flipped bus. She stares back, before jumping down and charging him on all fours. Noah grips the door handles but is tackled and crashes through them. Sliding across the tile floor with this thing on top of him. Hi ya, I’m Aurora. She says her voice light and playful, covered in blood. Noah scared out of his mind, and not knowing how he’s not dead yet. Pushes her off and away. Scrambling to his feet he runs into the aisles. Hey now no running away, that’s no fun. She speeds infront of him. Grabbing the fire axe on the wall, Noah sends it into her torso. She stumbles back slightly, more out of shock that he would try that than pain. OW! You would be very upset if I did something like that to you. She glares at him, with a hurt expression.  Wh- why haven’t you killed me yet. Noah asks now just frozen in place. Hmm... I don’t know yet, there’s just something about Chhya. I’ll get back to ya on that one. She says giving him playful poke on the nose. Noah swats her hand away, backing up. Well, what are you a demon or something? 

 Hmm... I prefer the term Hell spawn, but yes you could say that. Word of warning though, demon is a slur where I come from. She whispers, her hand in front of her mouth as if she’s trying to hide that she said such things. So- so you are a demon, I’m talking to dam DEMON right now. Noah says freaking out, his face in his hands. HEY, I said I don’t like to be called that. Her face turning deep red and very upset. I- I didn’t mean anything by it, I just never saw a dem- Hell spawn before. Noah says looking up from his hands which are now infront of him, as a pacifying gesture. Ok ok, I’ll let it side. Soo where we are going. She asks, leaning against an aisle. Noah backs away, head out of the convenience store. I’m going home, don’t follow me. Walking away from the store, only alone for a few seconds before Aurora has her arm wrapped around his shoulder. 

 Alright this home of yours is where exactly? Please just leave me alone. Noah pleads with her as he slips out from under her arm.  wow and I thought I told the worse someone can say is no. She gasps in mock offence, as she follows him anyway. Well, I can’t just leave you alone, you’re gonna run into another Hell spawn eventually, and trust me normally we don’t leave you with your limbs still attached. I guess you're just stuck with me, bestie. She explains, skipping alongside him. So, I’m just supposed to trust you, dem- Hell spawn not to murder me at any moment? Noah asks, stopping in his tracks and facing her. Yeah, that about sums it up. She responds in a very nonchalant tone. She looks down the street, eyes going wide. HIDE NOW! She picks Noah up, throwing him into a dark alleyway.  

Another Hell spawn coming from down the road, leaving a lingering smell of sulfur as it approaches her. What’s up Boss. She greets them cheerfully. Hmm if it isn’t the little crazed Aurora. He greets back, his tone condescending. Heh heh, yep you got me. How’s the whole murder fest going along. She laughs, running her finger across her neck. I’ve already killed more than I can count. I think I can smell another nearby. He says with a grin growing on his face. Aurora glances over at the alley way. Oh, uh sorry to burst your bubble boss, but I already got them. She gestures to her bloodstained shirt, pulling on it. Are you sure, you got everyone in this area. He asks raising an eyebrow, drifting toward the alleyway as he can smell the live blood. OH YES! Positive boss, I tore through every building and watched as the life drained away from them. She Laughs, trying to hide the fact that she's almost sweating. 

 

  As her boss Eches closer to the alleyway when smoke bombs are throw into the street, right where their standing. Demons! They hear as gunshots are flying everywhere. Noah pokes his head around the corner the see the military opening fire on the Hell spawn. HEY! HELP OVER HERE!! Noah screams at the top of his lungs, running full speed at them. Aurora, slashing one soldiers throat, and throwing them into another, hears then sees Noah racing to them. Within the blink of an eye, she launches toward him. Hitting the solider that is helping Noah hard in the chest, sending flying back. Throwing him over her shoulder and speeding down the street as fast as she can, but not before locking eyes with her boss. Now a few blocks away from the gunfire, she slowly comes a stop.  

 

Great now my boss seen me saving your ass, instead of poking your eyes out. She drops him to the ground, now just pacing back and forth think about the repercussions of her actions. SAVING ME! YOU STOPPED ME FROM BEING SAVED. Noah yells with anger. Noo no, I saved you. Me and Mr. Boss were going to tear threw those fellas. And if he got his hands on you, boy there wouldn't be anything left. I don’t know about you, but I think that deserves a thank you. She says light heartedly, with cute smile. You realize how crazy this all is for me right? I just worked a 12-hour shift, and I just want to go home to my dog and sleep in my bed. Then you killed my bus driver and the worlds Going to shit now. Noah says as he rest on the curb. I’ll have you know mister, I’ve been waiting years to go topside and have some fun. Imagine the promotion I'll get after this. She laughs and does a little dance as if she’s celebrating the occasion. 

Noah shaking his head, as he stands up and walking away. Let me guess, you're going home, right. She says cheekily, Walking alongside him. Hmm no, maybe if I can find more of the military, they could help me out with my pest problem. He says glaring at her, as they continue down the street. Oh, you mean me? Well, they better have some good pest control because, I’m worse than termites. She teases him. You're not gonna kill everyone we come across, are you? He slumps forward as he realizes she most defiantly would. OH of course, I can’t even thing of a reason not to. She taps her chin, genuinely trying to come up with a reason. Great so I have a mass-murdering psycho following me and killing anyone I come into contact with. Noah throws his hands up in defeat. As they continue to walk down the street, Aurora catches glimpse of a lone survivor. 

 Oh, speak of the devil. Noah grips Aurora’s arm. NO! He screams. Hey, let go they're getting away. She whines and pulling away from him, as she gives chase to her prey. Ah damn it. He watches as she closer to them, he sighs. I can’t believe I’m doing this. He thinks to himself. THANK YOU!  Noah blurts out in a rush. She stops just a few feet from her victim, turning around to face Noah. You wha-. She asks surprised. T-thank you for not killing me and then saving me earlier.   I KNEW YOU’D COME AROUND, I JUST KNEW IT. She picks him up and hugs him tightly, prancing around. Aright that's a bit much. His voice strained as she held him to tight to breath. I’ll accept your company, but only if you stop killing people. She drops him, which allows him to breathe again. You mean it, we can be pals now! That is a big ask though, mass murder is like in my top three favorite hobbies. She says, considering what she really wants. Hmmmm... fine, I guess no more fun. She sighs as she rolls her eyes. You promise you're done. Noah looks her in the eyes. Aurora stands up strait and salutes him. Nothing but the best behavior, maybe with a few slip-ups. I guess that’s progress. He rolls his eyes, thinking he’ll take what he can get. 

 

 Aurora’s eyes drift as she to a dead body lying face down, a few feet out from them. She flips them over, spotting a pair of dark vintage sunglasses. Uwe score! She chirps with excitement, as she puts them on. How do I look? She asks, making a pose. Noah shakes his head in disapproval. Whaaat, you didn’t say I can’t loot people? They continue walking, Aurora skipping gleefully, humming as she does so. She slows her pace as she feels nausea creeping in as the make their way down the street. Wait. Something is off, I can feel it. She speaks with a concerned tone. Huh, what do you mean? Noah frowns, turning to face her. Aurora sticks her tongue out, tasting the air. IT’S HOLYWATER. She spits out, as she tries to get the taste of her tongue. So, we gonna close then, right. Noah picks up his pace, turning the corner into a wide-open parking lot. Both of them are blinded large stage lights as the enter.	 

THIS IS A MILITARY COMPOUND, NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS OR YOU WILL BE SHOT DOWN. Soldiers rush in and surround them, their guns aimed and ready. Noah gives Aurora a look that says please don’t do anything stupid. We come in peace. Aurora declares, giving Noah a wink. One soldier steps forward. Well in that case you’ll be safe here until we can ship you off to a safe zone. Oh, thank you. Noah sighs in relief as they guide them into the occupied police station. Aurora falls in step behind Noah. Sticking her tounge out at a soldier as they walk by. She gags slightly as she remembers the air is filled with Holy water, making the soldier raise an eyebrow.   

Entering the station, they see a one soldier dumping ammo into a vat of water and another picking them out then loading them into magazines. W-what's going on there. Aurora asks, sweating slightly. The soldier leading them turns around. Their making holy bullets, it's the only thing that seems sting for them. Those demons are all over the city, but they're not getting in here without a fight. We're at war sweety. The leading soldier explains. Oh, I see. Aurora gulps. One soldier holding the door open for them. You’ll be staying in the room just down the hall for a few hours, and we’ll get you fellas something to drink in a minute. The soldier says as he points them in the right direction. Noah and Aurora look in the mostly empty room just a bed in the corner, the door shutting behind them. Their left alone in the room, waiting until further notice.  I could totally wipe those dudes out, no sweat. She declares, not enterally believing her own words. I never said you couldn’t. Noah smiles slightly, teasing her. They got me breathing in holy water, and now they wanna punch holes in me with it. I odda go in there and remind they who’s boss. She remarks, like she just can’t believe they would even try to fight back. This day was big talk for years downstairs, this is hell spawn day. Not the day humans fought back. She paces back and forth, getting more and more riled up. Noah just lets her ramble on, as he looks out the window at the still raging fires in the distance.   He turns his head as the door opens, with a soldier holding two cups. Here y'all go, I’m sure you two are just dry as a desert.  

Noah chugs the water down. Aurora begrudgingly takes the cup, taking a sip. Ya'll are a piece of work ya know. She says glaring at him. What? The soldier asks shocked. Aurora spits her drink out. THIS IS HOLY WATER! She grips the soldier and slams him into the wall repeatedly. Soldiers fill the room, as Aurora deals with one after another. Crushing one's head, punching another strait through the chest, even tearing a head of and smashing it into the next, all with a smile of her face. STOP! Noah screams. Aurora looks back at him, but only for a second as she continues to tear the soldier's limb from limb. Noah grabs her arm pulling her back from killing another soldier. Please stop Noah begs. She drops the soldier but in doing so, allows him to get a shot off at Aurora. She screams in pain as the holy bullet hits her leg. She breaks the window and jumps through, Noah just left standing there with the remaining soldier 

Listen Guys, I’m not really with her. Noah raises his hands to try and savage the situation. The soldiers raise their guns at him. Shit. Noah thinks to himself, as he jumps after Aurora. Aurora limping down the street, sitting down leaning against a brick wall as she can’t take the pain. Noah catches up with her, he helps her up and does his best to get as far from the soldiers as he can. Come on you need to keep moving, they’re probably on their way to finish the job. Noah breaks into a clothing store, making their way to the back. He props Aurora up on the backroom table. AAHH DAMN IT, it hurts. She cries out. Noah, tears open her pant leg and sees black lines growing from the wound. What is that, is that the bullet wound?! She says, beginning to freak out. Don’t worry I’m going to get it out. He says, grabbing some tweezers he a nearby drawer. 

 Just hold on to this, he gives her a block of wood to squeeze, but as he starts, she crushes it instantly. He hands her a steel rod instead and begins digging for the bullet. Her screams cause the display cases in the shop to shatter. Almost, I Almost got it. Noah pulls the bullet out. Ah got it. He smiles. Oh, that was terrible, I don’t ever wanna do that again. I told you I could takem though. She says proudly. 

 

 Noah quietly wraps her leg with a torn shirt from one of the nearby clothing racks. You know, you could of left. You could of just ran another direction, I wouldn't be able to catch up. But your still here, thank you for not leaving. Aurora speaks, with an emotional tone that is rare for her. Well, I guess your growin on me then. Noah ties the knot extra tight. Oh, come on does it really need to be that tight. Aurora gasps, wanting to just rip it off but stops herself. Nope, Noah laughs. He looks at their clothing, all torn and bloody. We should change close. Noah suggests to her. Oh, are you thinking what I’m thinking? Say it with me now, MONTAGE!!! Aurora squeals, jumping off the table. 

 Ok calm down, it's more you than me that needs to change. Your outfit screams, psycho. Noah chuckles, looking at her blood smeared outfit. Duh what’d you think I was going for, can’t have anyone thinking I’m Miss innocent. She plops down on an office chair, rolling by clothing racks and chewing bubble gum as she does so. Plus, your outfit needs waaay more work than mine. She adds, rolling her eyes at his choice in clothing. She continues to roll throughout the store, adding anything that looks cool. So, were you always a hell spawn or how does that all work? Noah asks out of pure curiosity, sitting on a display stand and swinging his feet. Hmmm well, no I was told I died in some crazy accident. At least that's what my boss tells me, but I don't really remember. She explains, holding a green shirt up to him to see how it looks. Yikes, that's awful. She murmurs to herself. But The hell spawn that were always just hell spawn, are the real nasty ones you gotta watch out for. Like my boss, big ole pin head he is. She rolls her eyes, holding another shirt up to him, this one blue. It's Perfect, brings out those eyes. She smiles. 

Ok so now what about your outfit. Noah asks, changing into the new shirt. Oh, I don’t need to change it, I like it the way it is. She looks in the mirror, doing a finger gun pose. What! You look like your crazy and bloodthirsty. Noah pleads, standing at her side. Aaand your point is? She continues to make poses in the mirror. At least wear a jacket to cover, a bit of it up. Noah continues to try and change her mind. She playfully tips a mannequin over. Ugh fine, but there's nothing that screams pysco murder in this store, ya know. She Complains, tilting her head and squinting her eyes as she pans across the store. Here, just takes my leather jacket. He says handing it to her. Woo, this is what I needed. Now I really scream Pysco. She does a little dance to celebrate. Whatever can’t say I didn’t try. Noah says under his breath, shaking his head and just giving up. 

So, where's this place, you’ve been acing to get back to? Aurora questions. It’s actually not too far from those huge fires downtown. Noah Answers, still hoping to get back to it. Oh boy, you don’t wanna go that way. She laughs the idea off. What?! Why? Noah asks, a bit concerned. Well, it’s where we came from. It’s the first gate to hell, of course. She replies as if it should be obvious, putting her sunglasses from before back on. 

 

 It’s what?! Noah gasps out, going pale. I mean if you still wanna go that way, sure but you’ll have to stick with me. The closer we get, the more hell spawn we’ll run into. She tells him, looking at the glow of the fire in the distance. Aurora says, laying it all out for him. How fast do you think we can get in and out. Noah questions, wondering if he should still go home. Oh, no time flat. Why? You need to get something? An old photo, or maybe something more? She playfully teases and prying for information. Well for one my dog is still there, and there's something at my house that I can’t just leave. Noah responds, but a bit guarded. Alrighty then, what’da ya say we blow this joint. She says, doing one more pose in the mirror, before pushing the doors open. Ahh, don’t you just love the smell of murder and blood lust in the Morning.  

It’s like one in the morning. Noah looks up at the smoke-filled night sky, as he pokes fun at her comment. You don’t have many friends do you? She asks, raising an eyebrow as she kicks a can down the road as they walk. Yes, their all just in a different town. Noah responds almost in mock offence. Oh, for sure right, then why’d you move to the big city. She asks with a smile. Sighs, I guess I was just running from my problems. Noah says rubbing his head. Mmmh, what were you running from? She bumps his shoulder playfully. I don’t really know, just had to get out. Aurora kicks the can into the passing alley, they hear a cat screech as the can lands. Score! She smiles. 

The ground rumbles, they feel a thump and another. You think I made the cat mad? Aurora questions, half joking half not. A large beast pokes through the shadows of the buildings, letting out a snarl. Noah falls back, crawling back in fear. Aurora quiet and still, staring the beast down. It moves closer, before sniffing Aurora and Giving her a huge lick. Aww, who’s a good boy. She pats the beast’s nose, her hand barely the size of its nostril. This is Jodie, she a hell hound. Come give her scratches, you just gonna show elm who's in charge. She rubs its belly as it rolls over. He's a just a big baby I promise. She gives more scratches, Jodie pants loving the attention. No, I think I’m fine over here. Noah declines still freaked out. Don't mind him, doesn't know you're just a softy. She scratch's Jodie's ears.  

BANG! They turn their heads, Jodie flopping upright and running off. What was that? Aurora asks, headed towards the noise. Maybe we don’t need to go that way, we can take a longer route to the apartment. Noah laughs nervous, and just tired of almost dying every five seconds. Hmmm, we’ll be fine. Plus, this way is the fastest. Aurora turns the corner as another Loud bang crashes nearby. Noah begrudgingly follows behind her. Rounding the corner, he She’s a huge fire fight. Humans behind sandbags firing at the approaching Hell spawn, a few lunching murders into the horde. Ahh hell yeah, this is my kind of party. Aurora Laughs with excitement. 

 

 Don’t even think about it. Noah Groans, knowing exactly what she’s thinking. Ohh pleeease, just a couple at least. She begs like she's got an itch to scratch. You always say no. She pouts her, getting upset she doesn’t want her to have fun. How about you save your bloodlust for someone that deserves it. Huf, finee. She just stands there with her arms crossed pouting, just watching the carnage unfold in front of her.  A few hells spawn start diverting from the main battle, smelling Noah's sent. Smell that Boys, easy prey. One chuckles off, as they approach. AURORA? What you are doing with buddy boy over here. Another hell spawn asks, demanding an answer. We're pals, and he off limits. It’s about time you got back in your line. Aurora snarks back at the hell spawn goons, now standing in front of Noah.   

Yeah, and what are you gonna do If we don’t? The Hell spawn laughs, looking back that the other Hell spawn behind him. The surrounding hell spawn watch in shock, as Aurora Slams her fist strait through his chest. Let’s start this party! She grins ear to ear, staring them down in a defensive position. One after another she tears them apart, only getting a few cuts and bruises on the way. Noah slowly takes a step back, letting her do what she does best. 

As Aurora takes down yet another Hell spawn, breaking its neck on her knee. She smell’s a hint of sulfur and freezes, going pale. Slowing turning around to see her boss standing before her. H-hey ya boss. She manages to squeak out. Her boss, tall and slinder with a nice clean white lined suit. Grips her by the neck and holds her up and arm's length, so she can see into his eyes. You think you can kill and rip apart your fellow hell spawn without me knowing about it. And for some boy, that shoulda be dead hours ago. He speaks calmly but also enraged at Aurora’s antics. I-I'm sorry boss, I just-. She kicks and gasps, as her boss tights his grip, his face twisting in disappointment. He releases his grip around her neck. She falls flat, as her boss snaps his fingers.  

Wha noo, no don’t take me back! A few dozen hell spawn pounce her, overwhelming her. Her boss turns to Noah and holding his head in Aurora’s direction, forcing him to watch them beat her bloody and drag hell. She’s one my favorite underlings, but sometimes she needs to be taught a Lesson about her place in the world. Her Boss remarks, getting a kick out of making him watch. Noah looking down, notices a holy blade just a few feet away. You should of stayed in hell. Noah spits in her Boss’s eye. You're going to regret that. Aurora’s boss speaks with malice, reaching for a napkin in his chest pocket. Noah launches for the holy blade and lunges it into his shoulder. Aurora’s boss staggers back, pulling the blade out of his shoulder as he falls into the hell gate. Noah quickly tosses the blade to Aurora. With only a few feet before the gate. 

 

  Aurora catching the blade midair slams into the Hell spawn’s foot, that's dragging her. She stands back up, brushing herself off and tossing the blade back to Noah as she they stand back-to-back. The rest of Hell’s armies enraged, stop attacking the soldiers and swarm Aurora and Noah. I Have come here to chew bubble and kick ass, and I’m all out of bubble gum. Aurora quoting her favorite movie, with a cheeky tone. She climbs up an abounded military Humvee, manning the Gatling gun. Single file y'all! She fires off. Noah running to the side and stabbing another hell spawn as it gets close.  

The military sit back in awe and watch, to unlikely partners fighting side by side and winning? How much ammo did that thing have when why had to pull back? The general Questions, looking at last few standing soldiers he has. I maned that gun, sir. Maybe half an a box, they’ll run out soon, sir. One soldier stepping forward says. WELL THEN GET OUT THERE AND GET THEM MORE BULLETS!! The general thinking these two might actually turn the tide off battle. 

Noah loads another box into the Gatling gun, as aurora fires off the last few shots. The soldiers bring them more ammo, reach the side of the Humvee. Huh are you a dem-. Don’t even think about saying it. The soldier is cut off by Aurora glaring at him. She pulls back the crank for the Gatling gun, mowing every hell spawn that nears. The last few hells spawn seeing their fate scatter. Aw, what a bunch of wussies. Aurora says disappointed, she jumps down from the Humvee to greet the remaining soldiers. The general approaches, standing before Noah and Aurora. 

 You two can kick ass, and I’m just glad you're on our side. He chuckles, extends   his hand to for a handshake. Hmmm, I’m on my own side. She smiles, not knowing what a handshake is gives him a fist bump. Well, another fifth teen minutes, me and my soldiers would be dead. If there’s anything you need, or if you want a ride out of here? Aurora to Noah. So, what’ll it be bestie? I just want to go home. Noah sighs, tired of this insane night. The general glances at his soldiers. Yeah, we can do that. 

The Soldiers turning the street, the vehicle slowing as they near the tall apartment building, But I never did find out if he was lying or not, but I kept pinky anyway just in case ya know. Aurora finishes her story as the arrive, patting one soldiers shoulder with a well-meaning but creepy smile. Come on Aurora, I’m sure there too busy to listen to your stories. Noah tells her, almost dragging her out of the seat. Fine, I'm coming. She rolls her eyes. After waving the soldier bye they enter the Apartment lobby. Those were some nice guys, they were kinda quite though. She says, dragging her knuckles across the front desk. Huh yeah, it’s not like you got yellow eyes and are covered in blood. She squints her eyes at him. Hmmm, race ya to your floor. She blots off on all fours, Noah shakes his Head in a smile. Why do I feel like I’ve know her for more than just this night.

 Noah making it to the nineth floor, turns the corner to see Aurora leaning against the door. Your slooow. She says like she’d been waking decades at his door. If you would of gave me like a five second head start, I would’ve won by a mile. He snarks back, putting the key into the door. As it swings open his dog jumps up like it was waiting all night for that door to open. As they look inside walking through the living room, there's huge hole in the wall to the outside. Aurora looks around the place. It’d kind of cozy, ya know if there wasn’t this huge hole. Just stay here for a minute, I gotta go look at something. He walks into his room, opening his closet door he pulls out a small old box. He gives a sigh of relief that it's this there and puts it in his pocket. Returning back to the living room, he sees that Aurora is sitting at the hole in the wall, her legs dangling as she looks out at the burning city and the sunrise behind it. This a really pretty view. Noah sits down next to her, and they watch the world burn together. Yeah, I guess it really is something.
