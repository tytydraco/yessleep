So my terrible journey of this incredible bowel movement saga starts with me waltzing in to Taco Bell because I’m craving one of those Dorito tacos and I just spend a whole morning doing absolutely nothing constructive.  I go right up to the counter and there’s this stereotypical worker guy with a hair net, an unshaven beard, and a stomach as big as his ego.  The dude’s got a cigar the size of an arm and he goes “What do ya want, ya hot piece of ass?!”

I just look at him nervously as if his head was filled with dynamite and I say “Give me a Dorito Taco.”  I pay him and run off with my crunchy shell bro and he stops me, pointing to a petroleum pump right by the counter.

Analyzing the situation, I go: “The hell is that doing there?”

The cashier says that it’s for motivation, because he needs to shove the pump up his ass every five seconds to prevent him from overdosing on heroin (I still don’t understand his logic).  He pulled his pants down and shoved the tube up his rear end, pushing the pump on full throttle and he yells with the fury of Hulk with Thor’s hammer on his nutsack: “I NEED TICKETS TO THE BUTTFUCK EXPRESS IN ORDER TO GET MY CONDITION UNDER CONTROL!  MY DOCTOR NEEDS TO GIVE BETTER ADVICE.”

I grab my cheesy friends and look at him like he just confessed to driving an oil tanker through an orphanage and eat the whole stinking thing down in a few seconds.  This of course includes the container (and the table for good measure) because I’m normal.  Once I’m done with that situation, I head back to my car and get back on the highway.  Out of nowhere, I start to feel a twinge down by my crotch and I realized that I have made a horrible miscalculation and I let out this massive fart.  To say it smelled like the devil is a damn understatement.  At that moment, I start having Vietnam flashbacks of all my ancestors as my rear end opens up like the Grand Hoover Dam.  My asshole opened up to the size of Jupiter (not Uranus because that’s too basic) and shat out a 900 PSI laser of pure brown shit that starts flooding the car up to the GODDAMN WINDOWS. Poop starts filling up the car and crushes me up against my seat and eventually it starts getting all hot and heavy in there.  That’s not the worst part.  Eventually the poop mass presses up against the car to the point where it turns into a fucking black hole and warps the fabric of reality.

Eventually the turd water seeps into my skin with ease and starts fusing to every organ in my body.  Somehow an insatiable urge to shit on everyone on sight ravages within my very being so I thought to myself “Where the fuck can I shit on the most people?”  My eyes lock on an airplane and a toothy grin develops on my stupid face.

So after that debacle, I floor it over to the airport, bash through the gates with my car and march up to the counter where the TSA guy is.  He looks right into my eyes, gives me a Cheshire Cat FROWN (how is that even possible?). I give him the ticket and passport and he pulls out a bottle of something.  He inhales every last molecule of air in the airport and screams the following:

“IVE GOT A LOVELY BUNCH OF BONER PILLS!  HERE THEY ARE ALL SITTING IN MY HAND!”

I just look at him funny and sprint towards the nearest United Airline plane (Delta FTW BABY!).  The plane takes off and and my stomach rumbles with the fury of a FUCKING EARTHQUAKE.  I snag a hammer that I smuggled from the weird TSA guy, smash the mirrors, and release 900 pounds of beef stew out my rear end.  

The pilot wonders what in Sam Houston State University is causing the cabin pressure to drop faster than the average person’s IQ after watching one episode of Cocomelon.  He glares at me going number infinity (two is for weaklings).  He politely says to me: “Now son, can you please stop releasing hundreds of liquified turds from your behind?”

I flip him the bird and say, “Can’t you see I am in the middle of pretending I’m a bird?! I haven’t found anyone’s car yet.  And who the hell is driving the plane?!”

The pilot blanches and realizes that he done fucked up.  The Ass-bus A380 goes into a tail spin and crash lands right into a Toyota parking lot.

“Hey look! There’s some cars I can shit on!”-seconds before the plane explodes.

My family mourned the loss of their beloved shitter and swore to continue my legacy.

And that is the story of how I became immortalized as the Poop Man of United Airlines.
