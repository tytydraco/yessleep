Mark's voice crackled to static as I stared, frozen in terror, at long strands of brown hair and two piercing eyes peering down from the hole in the ceiling.

My heart hammered in my ears as I realized it was the same girl from before.

Her face twisted as she began to lower herself into the room.

I went for the door handle, desperate to take my chances with anything else, but the handle wouldn't move. Someone was standing on the other side, holding it.

I shook the door handle, desperately trying to escape. I could hear her bones click as she moved awkwardly down through the gap.

I threw myself against the door, my elbow slamming so hard my teeth chattered.

I heard her hit the floor behind me as I threw myself into the door again.

Wood splintered outward as I went crashing through, slamming onto the floor so hard the wind got knocked out of me.

I didn't have time to think. I painfully climbed to my feet, motivated by pure fear, and took off down the empty corridor.

I heard the girl's footsteps in a dead sprint behind me.

I'd forgotten my flashlight on the desk. I ran through the pitch black, bumping into stores, almost tripping over debris before slamming into the railing.

I had no idea where I was or where I should go. I could hear her getting closer.

I picked a direction and ran.

Pain exploded through me as I ran straight into a store's plastic roller shutter, sending it tumbling inward. I landed for the second time on my stomach.

I launched myself to my feet and stumbled further inside, blindly running through an open doorway into a back room.

My hands flew to the handle and I threw the door shut. I was breathing so heavily my throat burned. My hands shook badly as I fumbled with the lock.

Something heavy hit the door at speed. I felt it push inward, straining against the lock.

Quickly, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and turned on the light, illuminating the room in a harsh white glow.

It was a small storage room, littered with boxes and empty clothing racks.

Desperately, I dialed Mark's number and waited, listening closely for any noises outside.

After three rings, I let out a sigh of relief as Mark answered.

"Mark! Where the fuck are you! There's a girl and the maintenance guy!" I practically screamed into the phone.

"Hey! I'm inside, but I... see anyone he... hello?" His voice was cracking and warbling.

"Mark, I think I'm inside a store! It's on the second floor, ne..."

The phone let out a high pitched squeal and the call ended.

"No, no no no!"

I attempted to redial, but I heard something that made my throat tighten.

A set of keys jingling softly outside the door.

Fuck, fuck, fuck!

I desperately searched the room for any kind of escape or weapon when I spotted it. A ceiling vent.

I pulled a chair directly underneath it and removed the vent cover just as I heard the keys enter the lock on the door.

I had to jump to grab onto the inside of the vent, pulling myself up as the door opened.

The vent creaked and groaned as I pushed myself through it. I had to suck my stomach in to crawl through, feeling the top and bottom squeeze my chest as I slid my hands forward and pulled myself deeper.

Painfully and slowly, I dragged myself forward, feeling the vent groan under my weight.

Eventually, I felt another vent below me. I pushed down on it, and without much force, it popped off, hitting the floor with a crash.

I crawled out headfirst, landing hard.

I cried out in pain. My entire body was screaming. I wanted nothing more than to just lay there and give up.

But something inside me wouldn't let me.

I pulled myself up and shone my phone's light around.

The room I fell into felt wrong.

It didn't look like a typical store.

The room was completely empty. Devoid of any furniture.

The walls were painted stark white.

My heart rate started to increase again.

No, no, no, no. I cannot be in this room.

I spotted a door. More of an outline than a real door, since there was no handle.

I tried to slide my fingers into the seam, desperately pulling at it.

It wouldn't budge.

Fuck.

I sat with my back against the door. I felt the overwhelming pain, nausea, and exhaustion that I'd been suppressing.

My eyes fluttered, and my consciousness dipped.

I woke slowly, lying against the wall.

For a brief, beautiful moment, I'd forgotten where I was.

I switched on my phone's flashlight and the memory came crashing back.

A lump formed in my throat as I looked at the ceiling and realized there would be no way back up into the vent.

I checked the time on my phone: 06:04.

I should be finished. I should be driving home right now.

I cried out, slamming my fists against the door.

The battery warning flashed. I only had ten percent left.

It felt like the walls were closing in. I was getting desperate.

I dialed Mark's number, desperate to hear another voice.

After about ten rings, Mark's voice came through.

"Hello, are you okay?" A hint of worry in his voice.

"I... I'm trapped in the blank room!" My voice wobbled as I struggled to contain my fear and panic.

"I'm coming. Just sit tight."

I felt a surge of relief wash over me.

I paced around the room, waiting. The silence was deafening. The only noise was my own heartbeat.

Checking the battery level on my phone, I saw the twenty second call had drained three percent.

I considered turning the phone off but didn't want to risk missing Mark's call.

A sudden noise caught me off guard.

The door.

I heard a key slide into the lock and click.

The door creaked as it slowly swung open.

"Mark?" I called, raising my phone's flashlight into the darkness.

There was no answer.

I called again. "Mark?"

A familiar face popped around the corner.

"Hey bud! What are you doing in here?"

I backed up so fast I hit the wall.

Chris clipped his set of keys back onto his belt. He stood at the doorway, just at the threshold.

The light from my flashlight gently illuminated his features.

"What the fuck are you?" I stammered, pressing my back against the wall.

"Just the maintenance guy, pal." Chris shrugged, his lip curling into a smile.

"Oh." His eyes widened, and he dug around in his toolbag, producing a large metal flashlight and a slip of paper.

My throat went dry.

"You left this in the Security Office, and you dropped this bit of paper..."

I couldn't move. I couldn't command my legs or my body to react.

"I took the liberty of calling..." He looked down at the paper. "Mark."

Then he tilted his head and smiled.

"No need for him to come and let you out. I figured I was in the area, and, y'know..."

I noticed he was right at the edge of the doorway. Close, but not quite inside.

I took a stab in the dark.

"Come give it to me," I said, my words stumbling out.

Chris's smile wavered.

"Your legs work, don't they, bud?" He laughed, a tinge of unease in his voice.

"Come and give me my things," I repeated, finding the tone I needed.

Chris's eyes flicked downward to the doorway and back to me in a millisecond.

His smile dropped.

"You need to come out eventually."

He was right. I felt my stomach twinge with the familiar pain of hunger, and my mouth was drying out.

"What are you?" I demanded.

Chris just rolled his eyes.

"Don't waste my time, pal. Come get your stuff so I can get on with my duties."

That's when I heard something odd. Something I'd never heard once in the week I'd been working there.

Music playing over the speakers in the hallway.

Then I noticed something else.

The hallway Chris was standing in was illuminated by a ceiling light.

"The... the power is working?" I stammered.

"Of course. I'm good at my job," Chris said, rolling the flashlight in his hands.

"No, but that's... that's impossible!" I argued.

Chris smirked.

"Maybe for you."

I didn't know why I did what I did next.

Fear, maybe. Frustration. Hunger.

I charged, catching Chris by surprise and slamming into him. He was thrown back into the wall, and I leapt around him, my heart beating so hard I thought it might explode.

I burst into the center atrium, second floor.

I looked around.

The entire center was lit up. Music. Stores. People.

"What the fuck..." I spun around wildly, taking in my surroundings, when a woman pushing a shopping cart knocked into me.

"Oh I'm so sorry!" she exclaimed, hurrying around the cart.

I backed up, terrified.

I spotted Chris round the corner from the corridor and we locked eyes.

He was pissed.

In a split second, I made a dash for the escalators, pushing past customers.

I spotted the exit and made a run for it.

I made it to the glass sliding doors.

They didn't open.

I tried my key on the fire escape door.

The key didn't work.

"Oh fucking hell!" I yelled, spinning around and seeing Chris sprinting toward me.

Customers stopped and turned to look at us.

I dashed left, heading into a service corridor.

I rounded a few corners. Right, left, left, right.

I shot through another door, head pounding.

Right back into the center.

Oh fuck.

I had a thought.

I took off toward the escalators and jumped down them, two at a time.

I ran straight to the security office and hit the door, trying the key desperately.

It slid into the lock, but wouldn't turn.

I hammered my fists on the door.

I turned around, facing the corridor, expecting Chris to round the corner any second.

That's when I heard the door swing open from behind me, and a familiar voice yelled out.

Adam's.
