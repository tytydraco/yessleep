I know, I know. It sounds awful. But I have to warn you anyway. It’s not worth the risk, even if the person drowning might not be *him*. You’ll never see his face through the splashes, so don’t think it’s a simple matter of recognition.

They say he only appears at night, but I’ve heard a story or two from the daylight hours over the years. It’s *never* safe to rescue someone. The locals all know this.

But I didn’t. Not until it was far too late.

It was summer of 2006. I was 19 back then, just a dumbass kid shouldering a dangerous feeling of invincibility. Enough so that I had become a volunteer firefighter straight out of high school. Most of my friends went off to college, so the semester months of late 2005 had been quite lonely. I saw my best friend, Carson, over Winter break, and she must have picked up on my low mood.

“I’ll tell you what, Joey,” she had said. “Next summer, I’ll grab Trish and Cole, and we’ll all go on a camping trip!” At the time, the very idea caused my heart to grow wings and soar to cloud nine.

I wish I could forget that feeling. Maybe the fall wouldn’t hurt as much from a lesser height.

Trish and Cole had been our friends since sixth grade. Carson and I took bets on how long it would take those two to get together, but we both lost. They were smart enough to stay just friends until they were accepted to the same college. While I had known Carson since Kindergarten, they were still very dear friends of mine all the same. The four of us had gone camping with Cole’s parents in the summer of 1999. The group unanimously considered the trip to be our finest hour. Hell, I still have a picture of us from that trip on my desk at home. You can clearly see Cole looking at Trish, and we gave him shit about it for years.

Some days, I even turn it around to face me as I write.

As the summer approached, our excitement grew. We’d already bought the tents, some fishing gear, and a cooler for our… *illicit* beverages. We borrowed the rest from Cole’s family. We planned most of the details out (and by “we” I mean “Trish,” as she didn’t appreciate spontaneity like the rest of us did) and I had the printed directions to Lake Wilcox in hand when Carson rolled up in her 1992 Tahoe. I quickly threw my gear and backpack in the rear before jumping into the passenger seat. The moment I sat down, Carson leaned over and gave me a hug.

“Aaaaaaaay, there he is!” came Cole’s voice from the back seat, as he clapped a massive hand on my shoulder. “It’s so good to see you!” beamed Trish, as she held Cole’s other hand. “How’ve you been?”

“Can’t complain,” I replied. “I had my first house fire last week. Everyone made it out before we even got there. And yes, they had their cat with them. I’ve never seen a cat looking so pissed off!”

“Jesus, Joey,” said Cole, shaking his head. “You sound way too excited when you talk about burning buildings.” Carson glanced over, agreement clear in her eyes.

“Yeah, I know,” I said as I rubbed the back of my neck. 

“Just promise us you won’t be stupid and rush in,” Trish added. “I want this trip to be an annual thing, and it won’t be the same without your dumb ass.”

I smiled. “I promise.”

“So,” Carson interrupted. “You gonna tell me which way we’re going, First Officer Dipshit?”

The rest of the four hour drive went much the same way. It gave us plenty of time to catch up with one another, and Cole took full advantage of the cooler within arm’s reach. Trish frowned disapprovingly as he stumbled while exiting Carson’s Tahoe. The rest of us followed suit, and together we walked across the gravel lot towards the treeline.

I’ll give it to Trish. She picked one hell of a spot.

The trees were tall, yet not so dense as to block too much sunlight or hinder hiking. A perfect combination of shade, and the space to toss a frisbee. I could already see several perfect locations to set up our tents.

And then, there was Lake Wilcox itself. 

The waters reached the shore no more than fifty feet from where we would ultimately set up camp. An old dock stood nearby, going out about twenty feet into the lake. The surface was calm, but moved enough to soothe any worries of stillwater. 

“Oh, *hell* yeah!” Cole cheered. “This is gonna be so awesome! Babe, you’re incredible!”

Trish huffed, but couldn’t quite hide her smile. 

“Yeah, Trish, this looks perfect!” Carson added. “How did you find this place?”

“Google Earth,” Trish replied with pride. “It looked like a great place to camp. The nearest town is only two miles away in case we end up needing anything,” she said, glancing at the notoriously forgetful Cole. “Plus, I couldn’t find anything online about people camping here, so I figured we’d probably have the place to ourselves.”

“Well, it looks like you were right,” I chimed in. “I don’t see any campsites. Hell, it looks like nobody’s been here in a while.”

“Well, let’s hurry up and get our tents up so we can start drinking!” said Cole, effortlessly knocking the smile clear off Trish’s face.

Once we were set up, the fun really began. The drinks were flowing, the fish were biting, and Cole had the time of his life as we tossed a football back and forth. He blew out his knee during his senior season, and I could tell how much he enjoyed catching passes again.

Carson and Trish were arranging small rocks to build a makeshift firepit. As Carson straightened the last rock to her liking, she stood up and took off her shirt to reveal the bikini top she had on beneath. Before I could react, the rest of her outerwear was in her tent and she was racing towards the dock.

“CANNONBALL!” she shouted as she entered the water with a massive splash. We all laughed and started stripping down to our swimsuits and leapt in one by one. The water felt incredible against my skin as I broke the surface. Carson beamed at me.

“C’mon Joey! Let’s swim out a bit!”

Look, I’m not a perfect man. Although I would’ve never risked her friendship, I did have a thing for Carson back then. It didn’t take much for her to convince me to do something.

Soon, the depth was beyond where our toes could touch, and Carson challenged me to a race by swimming at full speed the moment I looked back to see our other friends.

Her laughter was cut short when her feet touched the bottom again, about a hundred yards from the shore.

“Hey, Joey, come check this out!” she said as she stood up. Sure enough, my feet soon touched the bottom as well. At my full height, the water barely reached my waist. 

“It must be a sandbar,” she said. “This is pretty cool!” 

“Yeah, you’re right. Think we should call Trish and Cole out here?”

Carson looked back towards the shore. The couple were having a blast splashing each other back in the shallows, as if we weren’t even here.

“Nah,” she said, as she lowered her body back into the shallow water. “It’s like our own private island.” She paused. “Unless you’ve got a problem with being stranded on an island with me?”

“Why would I?”

Yes, readers. I couldn’t read a flashing neon sign.

Anyway, we stayed right there for around half an hour, only swimming back as the sun began to slide below the horizon. Soon, the four of us were comfortably surrounding a small campfire.

“Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?” Cole asked me, quietly.

“Yeah, of course,” I said as I set my beer down.

Cole beckoned me over, and I joined him a short distance away.

“Alright, what’s up, man?”

Cole rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. 

“My dumb ass left the protection at home.”

“I mean, I’ve got a gun in my bag,” I replied.

“No, dude, the *other* protection.”

“Oh. Well, good job, buddy. If you’re asking me for one, I don’t have any.”

“Damn. I was hoping you finally had the balls to make a move on Carson.”

“Hurtful.”

“Anyway,” said Cole. “Do you think Carson would let me borrow her Tahoe so I can get some in town?”

“Why are you asking me? Ask her. And are you even sober?”

“Yeah, I’m good,” he assured me. “I noticed my fuck up when I put my stuff in our tent, so I haven’t had a drink since we got here. Can you ask her? I don’t want Trish to know.”

I rolled my eyes. “Whatever, man. I’ll see what I can do.”

Carson was hesitant, but Cole really had sobered up in the hours we had been here, so she agreed, and gave him directions to the nearby town. Cole fed Trish a story of wanting to grab some more snacks, and he left.

By this point, Carson and I were quite drunk, and returned to our tents once Trish assured us that she would be alright waiting for Cole.

I didn’t wake up until I heard Carson scream.

“TRISH?! OHMYGOD, JOE, GET OUT HERE *NOW*!”

I never moved so fast in my life. I was out of my tent like a shot, and immediately saw Carson kneeling at the water’s edge. My heart sank as I sprinted towards her. But she wasn’t alone.

Though only lit by moonlight, I could still see that she was dragging Trish ashore. And Trish was unresponsive.

My training kicked in, and I quickly rolled Trish onto her back to clear her airway. I couldn’t feel a pulse, so I began CPR. Water flowed from her open mouth with the first compression. As soon as the water stopped, I began mouth-to-mouth, but Carson stopped me.

“I’ll do that, you focus on her heart!” 

I pushed down on her chest with everything I had. The sickening crunch of my friend’s ribs breaking under my hands is a feeling that will never leave me.

But it was no use. As soon as I had a proper look at her face, I knew Trish was gone. Her skin had gone pale, with the telltale blue tint of asphyxiation. Her open, unfocused eyes were the final sign that my efforts were in vain. Slowly, I stopped my compressions, and Carson buried her face in my shoulder and began to cry. I hadn’t even noticed my own tears until that moment. I reached down and closed her eyes.

“Carson… what happened?”

“I… I stepped out to pee. And I saw her floating in the water,” she responded between soft sobs. “She was… she was facedown.”

I looked down at the body of our friend. She was still wearing her gym shorts and tank top, as if she hadn’t planned on entering the water.

I steadied myself as best I could. “We need to call the police,” I said gently. Carson nodded and rubbed her eyes, before standing up and walking back towards her tent to grab her phone.

Something else was bothering me, though. Trish had been a member of our school’s swimming team. For her to drown like this made no sense. But there was one other thing. To this day, Carson doesn’t know what I saw in the water as we pulled Trish out. Eyes. Glazed over as if dead.

Until they *blinked.*

But they immediately vanished after that. At the time, I assumed it had been a large catfish or something.

“I have no signal,” came Carson’s voice from behind me. 

“Shit. I’ll go try.”

Sure enough, my phone also had no service. Same with Trish’s.

“And Cole has the truck,” I thought aloud as the full helplessness of the situation hit me.

“Cole,” whispered Carson. “Oh God… how are we gonna tell him?”

“I’ll tell him,” I said. “I’ve had to do it before.” What Carson didn’t know was the day after the house fire my department had put out, I’d responded to a car accident. I had to tell the driver that his brother in the passenger seat was gone.  

“*HELP ME!”*

The voice came with a flurry of frantic splashing in the lake behind me. I whipped around to see a man foundering a few hundred feet from the shore. Instinct once again took over, and I tossed my phone aside. But before I could jump into the water, I felt a hand clamp down on my shoulder.

“Wait,” came Carson’s voice from behind me.

“Let go!” I said, trying to shrug her hand off of me, but she gripped tighter. 

“Joseph. Something’s not right.”

We had been friends for fifteen years at that time, and not *once* had she called me that. Not just that, there was a fear in her voice I had never heard before. It was enough to stop me in my tracks. I looked back, and Carson was staring out at the drowning man.

“Look where he is.”

I turned back towards the lake, and froze. 

The turbulent water was directly over the sandbar. The man was splashing in less than three feet of water.

My body went cold. My instincts screamed as if I had come face to face with a mountain lion. We watched the lake in silence for what felt like an eternity as the man continued to call for help.   

Until he stopped.

The lake instantly fell silent, along with any wildlife in the area. It was as if the woods themselves held their breath. 

And a pale face began emerging from the water where the man had been. It broke the surface and it just… kept rising. It finally came to a stop around six feet above the water, and that was when I noticed the body of a man beneath it. He stood motionless on the surface. As he stared at us, another detail emerged: His neck was broken. The dead eyes staring back at us were nearly vertical. 

The man let out a horrific screech, and *sprinted* across the water straight towards us. Far, far faster than any man ever could, with his head flopping against his shoulder the entire way. His movements weren’t natural. Almost like a section of film with too many cuts and sloppy editing. Before we could even react to what was happening, he came to an instant halt at the same point the water did, less than four feet from Carson. The man glanced at the ground before him, and glared at us with utter malice clear in his broken face.

“What’s going on? Who the fuck is that?” came Cole’s voice from somewhere behind us. 

The man’s head snapped upright instantly. A terrifying smile full of rotten, broken teeth crept across his features, before taking a step backward into the water. 

Cole must have noticed Trish’s body, as he let out a cry and rushed to her side, hopelessly shaking his dead fiance. 

“WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?!” he roared, tears forming in his eyes as he turned to face the smiling man, who responded by taking another step back into the lake and holding his grin.

“Cole, don’t!” Carson screamed. But it was too late. Cole charged his partner’s killer.

“YOU SON OF A BITCH, I’LL KILL YO-” was all he got out before being pulled under water.

I dove in after him without a second thought. He was our friend, he would have done the same for us. I swam after the bubble trail as fast as I could, but I only made it fifty feet before something tightened around my neck and snapped my head backward, down into the pitch black water. I felt a thud below me, as if something heavy had impacted the lake floor. The shimmering moonlight was barely visible from the surface about twenty feet above me. My hands clawed at the invisible rope around my neck, as my lungs began to burn. My vision started to blur. My movement slowed, though I refused to give up as a shadow blocked the dim light from above.

Carson.

She’d found me. I hadn’t noticed her following me into the water after Cole. She grabbed my arm and pulled against the invisible rope as it fought to take my life. She must have noticed my struggle against my own throat, and she reached for the force holding me under.

And it vanished. I was free. Carson dragged me to the surface just before the inevitable reflex to breathe could draw water into my lungs. Seconds after we surfaced, a muffled screech emitted from the bubbling waters below. It sounded *pissed*.

“SWIM!” she shouted. 

Leading up to this moment, I wasn’t a particularly fast swimmer. However, survival instincts easily doubled my normal pace as we frantically swam for the bank. But we weren’t the only ones. A stream of bubbles was streaking towards us from behind. I fucking *felt* the man swim past me just before Carson went under. 

Without a second thought, I pushed myself back underwater after her, but whatever this thing was put banshees to shame. A scream reverberated through the water with enough force to permanently damage my hearing.

But I could see Carson surfacing again.

We ran the moment our feet touched the bottom, and scrambled ashore. I looked over my shoulder. And man, do I regret it. The man was once again standing on the surface of less than an inch of water behind us. His head was once again hanging by his shoulder, but he reached up, grabbed his hair, and used it to hold his head upright as he glared at us. The waters around him grew turbulent as his milky, dead eyes narrowed in pure hatred.

Then he vanished. The water became still. The world was instantly as it should be.

Well, almost. Cole never resurfaced. 

Everything after that was a blur. The local sheriff and his men recovered Trish’s body from the shore where we left her. There were funerals, furious, grieving relatives, and blackout drinking on my part. But even through the haze, I noticed one thing: The deputies were *very* careful to avoid touching the water as they worked. They knew.

That was nineteen years ago. Despite my best efforts to ruin things by becoming an alcoholic, Carson married me anyway once I sobered up for good. 

We spent years researching the history of the area, and, eventually, we found a name.

Gabriel Barnes. 

An alleged child killer in the 1830's, Barnes disappeared from existence around the same time Sheriff Wilcox’s son did. After what we went through, I’d guess Wilcox tied a noose to an anchor or a rock around Barnes’ neck and threw him into the lake that would soon carry his name. 

As for how we survived that night when our friends didn’t… we eventually realized that the only difference between us and them was the solid iron bracelet Carson wore on her left wrist that day. 

There’s one more thing I haven’t mentioned. At the bottom of that lake, I saw something sticking out of the mud: the end of a human femur.

As I write this, my wife is loading our scuba gear into our truck. We know where the bastard is. More importantly, we know how to hurt him. We’re gonna burn those fucking bones and put the son of a bitch down.   

But I’m leaving this as a warning in case we don’t come back.

If you see someone foundering in Lake Wilcox… **let them drown.**
