My arm itched like hell. I scratched and scratched. I scratched until the skin turned red and left behind little red scabs. I dug out little flecks of skin from under my fingernails. 

The itching was so unbearable that I could hardly sleep. In the late hours of the night I awoke and felt a strange lump on my itching forearm. 

I turned on the light and gasped at what I saw. Growing from my arm, was a tiny red worm-like plant. I could see its roots just under my skin, digging through my arm as if it were veins. 

I tried pulling it out, and it flooded my nerves with a sense of pain so strong I could've sworn my arm would fall off if I pulled any more. I've googled everything, I've tried every ointment and treatment I could find, nothing works. 

When I tried suffocating it with duct tape, it just sprouted right out. It was growing steadily, inch by inch it gained new branches like a shrub. All soaking it in vinegar did was make the itching sting even worse. 

I even tried using weed killer. After a couple weeks of trying in vain to rid myself of this strange plant-like infection, it had grown to be about 10 centimeters. 

A small, bright red plant clung to my arm like a leech, causing me agony whenever I so much as touched it. When I try to pull it out, I just get more searing pain. 

I've tried trimming or cutting it, but when I do it ALSO hurts like hell. I tried cutting the stem early on when it was only a couple centimeters long, only to be met with toe curling stinging and a geyser of blood shooting out from the cut. 

After I treated the wound, the stem grew back twice as fast as it had before. I don't know how much longer I can take it. My skin is so irritated around the base of the plant it looks like the red bumpy surface of mars. 

I tried googling it and I couldn't find any matches, it doesn't seem like anyone's experienced this before, at least nobody who uses the internet.

It burns. I constantly snag the plant on something despite my extreme caution not to touch it, and it's unbelievably painful. 

I don't have health insurance, but given how much discomfort this thing is causing me I might just bite the bullet and pay whatever absurd price it'll cost me to remove this little shit. 

The plant is now 20 centimeters, dozens of thin, red, branch-like appendages stretch out from my forearm. Strangely, the sight of the scarlet plant looked familiar. I cocked my head and scoured my brain for reasons why the plant gave me a weird deja vu.

Then it hit me; my mom. When I was very young, too young to remember much of anything, one particular memory bubbled up in my brain. My mother was hunched over a boiling pot, steam billowing out.

I remember her shooing me away, probably because it was dangerous for me to be around scalding liquid. I watched from a distance as she held up a strange red plant in her hand, then dunked it in the pot. 

When she pulled it out, the red plant had begun to turn brown and wither, then crumbled away into dust. I don't remember much after that, for some reason the familiar sight just activated a memory in the recesses of my brain.

I didn't know what liquid she was boiling, was it water? I tried boiling a pot of water and dunking the plant in, a big mistake. It stung like a thousand bee stings, the white hot liquid steamed off the plant as I quickly removed it from the pot.

What exactly was my mother boiling? If things don't work out with the doctor, I might just go visit her in the nursing home and ask.

Until then, does anyone have any advice? Anyone who's experienced this before? Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I'll update if it gets any worse or if I've found a solution.
