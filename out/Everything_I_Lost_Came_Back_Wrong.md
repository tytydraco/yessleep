Part 1:

I don’t usually sweat the small stuff. My life’s loud—music, parties, friends over every weekend. I live fast, party hard, and don’t do anything halfway. My house is medium-sized, yeah, but it’s mine. And it’s usually a mess, sure. But lately… the mess has started to feel wrong.

It started small. My sunglasses turned up in the microwave. I figured I was drunk, laughed it off. A week later, I found my laptop in the linen closet. Still on. Still playing music. That one stuck with me a little longer, but again—I live loose. Stuff slips through the cracks.

The pets were next. I’ve got three—Rico (pitbull), Missile (my angry little cat), and Shredder (my beardie). They used to follow me everywhere. Lately they’ve been… distant. Missile won’t come into my room anymore. Shredder stopped basking. Rico—normally a tail-wagging idiot—just stares at the basement door and growls.

And the basement’s cold. Not “bad insulation” cold—dead cold. I opened the door last night just to check, and the air coming up felt damp. Like the kind of cold that comes off a cave wall. I haven’t been down there in weeks.

Sometimes I hear things after I turn the lights off. Not footsteps exactly. Just… pressure shifting in the ceiling. Pipes groaning. The kind of sounds you can explain if you want to.

One night, I was lying in bed and Missile bolted out from under the covers and ran full-speed into the closet door. She sat there hissing into the dark. I turned on the lamp—there was nothing there.

But I didn’t sleep.

I tried to ignore it all. Told myself it was just stress. Maybe I’d been partying too hard. But things kept adding up. The sound of scraping on the walls late at night. The way the air felt different—thicker, somehow. Like it was harder to breathe.

Rico started barking at nothing. Nothing I could see, at least. Just barking into corners. He’d stand at the back of the living room, staring at the shadows. The kind of stare you get when you think someone’s in the room with you, but there’s nothing there.

I went into the kitchen to grab a drink. I thought I saw something dart across the hallway—just a flicker at the edge of my vision. I told myself it was nothing. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was moving around the house with me.

A few days ago, I woke up to find Rico at the foot of my bed, growling low, eyes locked on the closet door. I figured it was just a bad dream. But then I noticed the door was cracked open—just a tiny sliver. I’m sure I closed it before going to bed.

I tried to laugh it off. I always do. But this morning, I found my keys in the freezer. And I don’t even know how they’d get there.

Something’s wrong here.

Part 2:

I don’t know how to explain what’s happening.

Missile’s gone now. I searched the whole house. Every room. Every closet. I even tore open the drywall in the hallway. I found fur. Blood. A chunk of what looked like tail—not hers.

Rico’s gone too, though I’m not sure when it happened. It’s like they just vanished. I thought maybe I was losing it. But then I started finding other things. Bits of hair. Tiny paw prints, but they weren’t from my pets. They were… different. And they led to places I didn’t remember going.

I keep telling myself it’s just me. That I’m losing it, but every day, the house feels worse. It’s like it’s closing in on me.

And then… I found it.

I didn’t want to at first. Thought maybe it was just my mind playing tricks. But last night, in the dim light of the hallway, I saw it.

A figure. Crawling.

It wasn’t a person, not even close. It had four legs, bent in angles that weren’t right. It moved in jerks, dragging itself forward like something broken and stitched back together. The body was a patchwork of animals—my animals. There was fur I recognized. And scales. And skin. My own pets. Shredded, torn, reassembled into a thing that shouldn’t be able to exist.

I froze. It saw me, I think. Or maybe it just felt me. The eyes… I can’t explain them. Not eyes, not really—just holes. Empty black holes sewn shut with string, like something had been peeled out of its skull.

I don’t even know how long I stared at it. It didn’t move. It didn’t make a sound. Just waited.

I… I don’t know what it was waiting for.

I ran.

I don’t know how I got to my room so fast, but here I am. My room’s locked, the windows shut, the blinds drawn tight. But I can hear it. Scratching. It’s not on the floor this time. It’s coming from the walls. From behind the drywall. I hear it scraping, like claws on stone.

And the air—it’s thick. Hard to breathe. The whole house feels like it’s moving in on me.

It’s close. I can feel it.

I thought I was just hearing things, but then I saw it again. It was… outside my window, I think. Just… standing there. Its body pressed against the glass. It shouldn’t be able to fit in the window frame, but there it was—its limbs stretched out, distorting its shape like something twisted and wrong.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even blink.

And then, just as quickly as it appeared, it was gone. But the scratching? It didn’t stop. It’s all around me now—scratching from the walls. From the floor. The ceiling.

I’ve never heard anything like it.

It’s not a thing anymore. It’s a presence. It knows I’m here.

I’m hiding. I’m typing this now, as quietly as I can, because I think… I think it knows how to get in.

I can’t move. I don’t know how much longer I can stay locked in here.

I just saw the door handle turn.

And now I hear something whispering in the walls.

It wants me to join the collection.

I’m posting this here because I don’t know where else to turn.

Please, someone—anyone, tell me what the hell this is. Tell me what I’m supposed to do. The thing in my house—it’s not even a thing anymore. It’s everywhere. It’s in the walls. It’s in the air. It’s in my mind.

I know no one will believe me. I know how this sounds. I don’t even know how to explain it. But I can hear it moving. It’s getting closer.

Please help me. Someone. Please.
