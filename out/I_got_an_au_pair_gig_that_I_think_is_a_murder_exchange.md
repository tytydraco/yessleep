Chapter One

When I think of Vincent I think of his smile — snarky and slick. I distinctly remember the first time we met. Him sitting across from me on the loveseat, hiding his grin with a sip of sparkling water, watching me over the curve of the bottle. It felt like I was there for his amusement. 

I would have believed this to be the case except it was his wife, Cassia, who had scheduled the interview. She was meek and beautiful, just tipping past forty. Faint lines around eyes and forehead, her light was dimming into weariness. Now that the kids were older, a middle-schooler at home, and their eldest at Wesleyan, she was returning to work. She informed me that Vince was, “Supportive with a capital S.” That was when he hid his grin with a sip of water.

I tucked my hair behind my ear and ran my hand along the rich velvet of the couch as I  told them what they wanted to hear—that I was done with college and taking a gap year to save for grad school. The usual suspects were posing obstacles to my education: tuition, student loan debt, a disinterested father. Cassia nodded, regretful with understanding, and turned her gaze to her husband. There was a brief pause as she watched him watch me. Vince took another sip of water. I told them my lease was ending on Tuesday and we agreed on the move-in date.

Even in the dreariness of winter, the sprawling lawns and towering trees of Brookline, Boston’s wealthy suburb, took my breath away. Their home was grand, one of the largest estates in the area, demanding a full block of fenced-in paradise. However, my bedroom was set up with only the basic necessities, and when I sat on my bed, I could feel the mattress springs. Cassia swooped in with fresh linens and an apology for the dresser drawers that didn’t shut properly. I said I hadn’t noticed. 

I was sent outside with their middle-schooler, Amanda, while Cassia prepped dinner. With her mother’s fair complexion and her father’s glittering curiosity, Amanda proved to be full of ideas of her own. During hide-and-seek, she immediately vanished, and I realized I had unwittingly underestimated her taste for mischief. I felt a buzzy panic rise in my gut until a rustle of leaves and a gleeful snicker sounded from above. I grinned and looked up. 

There, in the solid oak branches, was a treehouse. A tangle of blonde hair peeked out from a window. As I mused aloud about where she might be, Amanda slammed the small treehouse door. I climbed until I was level with the front window. 

“What a great hiding spot!” I said. “I wonder if anybody is inside.” 

I looked for a firm hold to swing my body around the side of the treehouse when I saw a figure standing by a second-story window, watching. My eyes focused on his form and I caught a flash of that same grin before he turned away, as if he had been caught doing something unseemly. 

At dinner, Cassia shared funny stories about Amanda and Paige, their eldest. She was animated when she talked about her children, joy radiating from her. Then Vince joined in about his work buddy who was jealous of Cassia’s brilliant decision to hire a twenty-something au pair. 

“Jim went from disbelief to jealousy in three seconds flat. You should have seen it!” 

Vince chuckled and held up his sparkling water, toasting Cassia’s brilliance. “I think it might be your greatest decision yet, hon.” Cassia fixed her cold stare on Vince and told Amanda to grab the dessert from the fridge as she poured herself a second glass of wine.  

“Listen, Francesca,” said Vince, turning his attention to me, “Because this is important. My wife is always right. Always. Never disagree with her, never cross her. Just smile and nod.” 

Amanda offered me the first slice of pecan pie with an apologetic grin. She was no stranger to a tense dinner table. I felt connected to her then like sisters biding their time before we could escape our childhood home. I took the pie and thanked her. 

It was just past midnight and I was reading in bed, unable to turn my brain off in the old, creeky house, when thought I saw an apparition. I was tired and confused from the draining day of moving, but a shiver ran down my spine and I thought, for a brief moment, that I saw a fleeting, ghostlike form pass above me. I sat up in bed, on high alert. 

And then my phone buzzed. I gripped the bed, looking around to see if the ghost was still there. My phone buzzed again and I answered, trying not to panic. It was Jerome, the bouncer at the Bourgeois Pig. Dad was drunk and causing a scene like any other Tuesday night. I didn’t tell Jerome that I had moved. I didn’t want anyone from my old life to know where I was, or how desperate I needed to start over. I forgot about the ghostlike vision as I pulled on my snow boots and told Jerome I would be there in thirty. 

I drove from the manicured streets of Brookline into recession-busted Roxbury. Dad was propped against the bar’s stoop, half-conscious and muttering. When he saw me, he started throwing sloppy punches, and it took Jerome’s help to get him into the car.

“You gonna be able to get him into your place okay?” he asked. 

I shrugged.

“Are you gonna drive over and help me?” 

Jerome was silent. 

“You’re gonna have to stop calling me. This is the last time I’m doing this,” I told him. 

He looked surprised. “It’s been a year, Jerome. I can’t keep this up. I’m done. I’m leaving. Starting over somewhere new.” 

“Does he know that?” Jerome gestures towards my dad. 

“He’ll figure it out.” I shoot Jerome a tight smile. 

He nods, understanding. “Take care of yourself, kid.” 

The Orchard Park projects are about as far from an orchard as you can get. But my old neighborhood was quiet as I flipped on my flashers and walked around the car to get Dad inside. As I unbuckled his seat belt, he jerked awake and started swinging. I ducked, but not before getting hit by a sloppy right cross. I cried out and covered my cheek. 

“Lydia,” he murmured through tears. “I’m so sorry, I’m so… I’m so…” he trailed off, his shoulders shaking with sobs.

I pulled him across the street, his feet dragging behind him. It gave me courage, knowing tonight was the last time. He had never realized how much he loved my sister until it was too late, but I was not about to meet the same fate as my sister or spiral into drunkenness with my father. I was commemorating the first anniversary of her death by moving out, by starting over. I couldn’t keep passing Lydia’s closed bedroom door. I couldn’t watch my dad unravel any longer.

I dragged him up the stoop, and inside the lobby, just far enough so that I could shut the front door on my way out. I wasn’t going back into that apartment for anybody.

I returned to the landscaped paradise of Brookline by two in the morning. When I crept towards the back stairway, I noticed a light shining from under a closed door. As I tip-toed past, the door opened and Vince appeared. 

“Fun night?” he asked. “How about you end it with a nightcap?” 

I scoffed. “I think you got the wrong person. I’m not posh enough for nightcaps.” 

I peered at him but there was no hint of the leering mischief I had seen earlier. 

“And I should get to bed, it’s been a long day,” I added. I was dead tired and would have to be up soon enough. 

He frowned and focused on my cheek. “Hey now, you alright?” I realized that my dad’s sloppy punch must have left a mark. He reached towards me and I jerked away. 

“Fine,” I said. 

“Let’s at least get some ice on it or Cassia might have a problem.” 

Moments later, I was propped on an overstuffed chair in front of the fireplace, which was glowing with embers. Vince shut the door behind him and handed me an ice pack. I winced as the cold touched my cheek. My whole body vibrated with exhaustion. 

“Jealous ex?” He joked with a wink. 

I was quiet, not wanting to get into it. 

“Nah, it’s not funny. I understand. My dad was an abusive drunk too,” he said, eyes shining in the dim light. I felt my body tense.

“Can’t blame us doing our due diligence, with you living in our home and all. And, of course, Cassia is very thorough.” 

He sighed and paced to the window. He seemed restless. 

“Which was great when we were both in law school with big dreams. But infuriating in a stay-at-home mom. She would’ve made a great cutthroat attorney.” He chuckled and ran his fingers through his hair. 

“She’s going back to work, yeah?”

He shrugged. “That’s what she says. But she hasn’t jumped at any of the interviews I’ve set up for her. I don’t think she wants to do it.” 

Vince paces to the overstuffed chair and runs his hand over the rich, Italian leather. 

“She’s intensely miserable and honestly…” 

He stops and glances at me. “Forget it.” 

In the tense silence, I worry that he is having second thoughts about hiring me. 

“At least she’s not drinking herself to death,” I offer, trying to be generous.

“I think she wants to,” he blurts out. “End things, I mean.” He melts into the leather chair and looks at the glowing embers in the fireplace. 

“Not with me, just, you know, in general…poof!” He gestures like a flame blowing out.

“She asked me to do it for her. In so many words. But I could never.” 

We sit in silence. I’m not sure how to respond and his face is unreadable. 

“But maybe you could.” 

I shift uncomfortably in my chair. “I’m sorry?” I say with a nervous chuckle. 

“Put my wife out of her misery. And I could return the favor with your dad. It’s what they want, anyway.” 

I stare at Vince in shock. He sits in the terrible silence, meeting my gaze with his steely eyes. I feel my hands begin to shake. Then he flashes that grin. 

“Oh god, you think I’m serious.” He laughs, slapping his knee. “Franny, can I call you that? You should know, Franny — I handle everything with humor. Otherwise, I would kill myself.” 

I clear my throat and stand. I am so tired of this man, and it’s been such a long day that I am struggling to think clearly. 

“I should go, I’ve got work soon.” I leave before he can say anything more.
