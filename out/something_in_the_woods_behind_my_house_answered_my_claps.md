something in the woods behind my house answered my claps

I have an outdoor cat who responds to clapping when it’s time to go inside. I usually let him out in the backyard for about 10-20 minutes, then clap a few times and call him name. He always comes running within seconds.

 Tonight he didn’t. 

With the pouring rain and pitch black I found it unusual that he didn’t come dashing in immediately per usual. Of course cats hate the rain but he also doesn’t love going out at night considering we have huge elk who roam the property. I clapped many times in a row calling his name out louder. I stood there watching, listening. After a full minute waiting there I heard it. One singular, distinct clap. It echoed back at me from deep inside the woods behind my house off to the left. 

I stood for a couple of seconds thinking about what I just heard, analyzing the sound. I then closed the sliding glass door, locked it and slid the curtains closed. Maybe he just got comfortable in a spot covered from the rain and isn’t ready to come in…it has only been 15 minutes after all. I don’t like it but since we’ve moved here, sometimes he does venture far and explore, but he always comes back.

I think it’s important to mention now that I live very rural, with no neighbors on either side. The house itself is on about 6 acres. Much of the land is covered with thick forestry, and between the closely rooted spindles of trees and impossible to navigate blackberry thorn bushes, there’s much of my property that I have not explored. Off to the back left side, the terrain slopes downward toward a river. I only know there’s a river down there because I hear the rushing water.  I cannot access the river however due to the thicket filled with thorns, not to mention the steep angle at which you’d have to walk, but soon I hope to clear a path and see what’s back there for myself.

About 15 more minutes go by, then I heard a desperate meowing coming from somewhere along the side of the house. I didn’t see his face in the back window where he usually sits to wait for me, but I went to the back door anyways and slid the door open. 
“Nova!”
I called out. Clapping once or twice was enough to send him sprinting back inside. He didn’t stop just inside the threshold, but kept running far into the house all the way into the kitchen. I closed and locked the door again following him. 
“Hey buddy, you coulda come when I called you the first time yknow”
I said with a laugh.
“You hungry?” 
I asked him walking to the cubbord.
He eats like an old man, always makes a mess. For that reason I always feed him by the front door, so I can wipe it up with the rest of the leaves and mud we track in. I started opening a can of wet turkey, and 
before I could even get the food onto his plate he forced his face under the can desperate for snacks. He began eating huge bites like he’d been surviving off the forest mice. Mid way through his eating he stopped abruptly and shot his head up. He was standing at attention, eyes locked on the front door, which also consisted mostly of huge floor to ceiling windows. He stared for a full two minutes. I stepped away from the water I was boiling to peak, nothing there. He eventually broke focus, and with a few more tiny nibbles he retired to the living room where he kept watchful eye on the back door for the rest of the night.

The next day I went on a walk around the property. This day I happened to take the cat with me. The last person to own the house was an older guy who lived alone, and he left quite a lot of trash behind when he sold the place. This mostly consisted of beer cans strewn about the wooded areas. He even had a side-by-side that he drove off the highest point of the property, sending it over a cliff-like drop of about 40 feet to the lowest point below. We weren’t able to remove it so it sits there to this day, in the part of our land I like to call “the pit”. In addition to that, there was a pile of rubble that looked as if it was burned for disposal, however it was only burned part way, leaving behind a hand burnt car battery, some charred construction foam, and some rusted scrap metal. 

Alongside the stack of burnt scraps, I saw something that stood out in the mud. 

A bare footprint…the largest one I’ve ever seen.

 A defined outline of each toe sat clearly in the damp mud. The cat walked up to it and gave it a long sniff, as if picking up a scent.

That footprint faced the house, not the woods.
