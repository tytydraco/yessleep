I didn’t know a damn thing about rice when I inherited a 440-acre farm in Central California.

It belonged to my husband’s family. But then there was a boating accident on Clear Lake. His parents died suddenly and the land went to Dylan and me. I told him we should sell it, but he was checked out. Never really recovered from what happened. Not that I blame him. This past February, he took the old 12-gauge to the shed. Left a mess I’m still cleaning up, one way or another.

Now it’s just me and our chocolate lab, Fudge, out here in the middle of nowhere. We were getting by, barely, but enough. Until the drought hit.

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this. I’m scared and desperate and hoping somebody here can help. Or at least tell me if you’ve seen anything like this before.

It’s hard to explain exactly.

Actually, let me backtrack to May. That’s when it really started. If you know anything about rice, you know they need water. Lots of it. Around here, family farmers grow nearly all of California’s crop. But this drought’s been taking a serious toll. So many fields going fallow. Like many folks out here, I’ve got no surface water thanks to the cutbacks. That means I have to pump expensive groundwater just to keep my paddy from drying out.

For months, this was my routine: I’d wake up early, and Fudge and I would walk the land. We’d check the pumps, adjust the dams, make sure flood levels were right. I tried to keep the water about four and a half inches deep. Enough to cover the mud and keep the weeds down.

Without getting too deep into it, the Sacramento Valley’s got an old system for distributing water from the mountains to the coast. The oldest farms get first dibs. By that, I mean pre-1914 old. Everybody else gets what’s left. But the drought changed everything. The reservoirs ran low, and the water districts had to hold back for health and safety. Basically, forest fires took priority.

It hurt to pay for the expensive stuff. But it was either that or lose the crop. And losing it felt like I’d be betraying my husband. Then this past May, I paid for it again. I woke up early that day, made coffee like usual. I even remember setting out two mugs, like I do every now and then, thinking Dylan’s just outside.

Fudge and I did our morning routine. He splashed in puddles while I checked the pumps. Everything was covered good. Then I went about my day. I drove into Colusa to grab some dog food and more ibuprofen for my knee. When I got back, everything was normal. That night, I fell asleep watching reruns of Cheers, Dylan’s favorite, while Fudge slept at the foot of the bed. The next morning, looking out the kitchen window, my bad knee nearly gave out.

All the water was gone.

There was nothing left but patches of cracked mud, baking in the early sunlight. I couldn’t believe it. I went outside. Even pinched myself, thinking I was still dreaming. Fudge looked up at me, just as confused. We stood there a good half-hour, trying to make sense of it. Low-flying planes kept buzzing in the distance, scattering seeds.

I rang the district and accused them of selling me “trick water,” which sounds just as stupid to me now as it did to the guy who picked up. When he suggested I probably never switched on the pumps, I hung up on him. I called a couple folks in the county to ask about their supply. They told me theirs was just fine. So it was just me.

Hate to admit it, but I started doubting myself. I wondered if I did forget to switch on the pumps, like the rude man said. Was I that mushy in the head?

I had a grandmother (on my father’s side) who left the oven running one night. Paramedics found what was left of her body melted to the linoleum, with one charred arm stretched out, “reaching for heaven,” as my father described it. I’ve been alive long enough to know you can’t always trust what you tell yourself. But I had my routines and I had Fudge. I could trust Fudge. At least I thought I could. But I’ll get to that later.

Anyway, I went ahead and bought more high-end water. I turned on the pumps and Fudge and I did our rounds. Even said out loud what was happening, just so I could hear myself. “You see me, Fudge? I’m opening pump number four now.” It took a few hours to flood the field. I ran some errands while waiting and when I came back, the paddy was full again. I wish I could say it gave me some relief, but after the other night, I didn’t feel so settled just yet.

I decided I’d stay up all night. I fixed a beef stew for dinner, then loaded up on coffee and parked myself by the back of the house, facing the rice paddy. Ten o’clock came and went, then eleven. It was almost twelve and my eyes were getting heavy. Fudge was at my feet. It was pitch black outside and the moon was hidden. Every now and then, I’d point my flashlight at the field to make sure the water was still there. It was. I felt a little stupid thinking it wouldn’t be.

“Fudge, be honest,” I said. “Am I losing it out here?”

Fudge lifted his head for a second, then laid back down. I took that as a yes. Anyway, I needed more coffee, so I got up for a refill. But as I did, Fudge perked up on full alert.

“What’s wrong, boy?”

He stood there, peering out across the paddy. I couldn’t see a thing in the darkness. I stood up, scanning the perimeter with my flashlight, left to right. Then, just as I swept back to the left, I saw it.

Now I’ve lived in this area for a while now. I’ve seen rot, fungus, tumors on cows. I’ve seen decomposed frogs and rat-tailed maggots. All kinds of craziness. After picking your husband’s brain out the shed wall with a paint scraper, there ain’t much that can scare you. But this thing in front of me, it had me disturbed in ways I can’t describe.

It was hard to see from where I was stood. It wore one of those hats with a big brim, which didn’t make sense at nighttime. Looked like it could be human, but didn’t move much like one. It would take a few steps forward, then freeze, completely still. Then again: step, step, step, freeze.

It was coming closer.

My heart was rattling like a loose bolt on a combine. I wanted to fetch the shotgun, but couldn’t risk taking my eyes of it. Fudge barked. The light beam trembled as I held the flashlight.

“This is private property,” I blurted out. “Come any closer, I will shoot you.”

It was at the edge of the paddy now. The next thing it did nearly ran my soul out of my body.

It got on its knees, bent over, took off its hat and lowered its face over the water.

And it drank.

I’m not talking a sip or two. It was chugging all my water. The slurping echoed into the night. I couldn’t move or speak. Watching it was bad enough, but those slurping sounds turned my stomach. Saliva filled my mouth and that beef stew was bubbling its way back up.

It kept slurping. I swear on my husband’s grave, it drank till there was nothing left to drink. When it stood up, the water was gone. It wiped its mouth and looked up at me.

Then Fudge took off. I shouted after him, but he was already darting across the dry field, barking like crazy. The slurper turned to Fudge. They were at eye level.

Fudge stopped barking.

I don’t know if it was whispering to him or just staring. But it held Fudge’s face in both hands.

“You get your hands off him,” I yelled out.

I couldn’t move fast because of my knee, but I started limping after him. I couldn’t let him hurt my boy. I couldn’t. I shouted again to let go and this time, it released him.

Fudge came running back across the paddy, barking again.

But now he was barking at me.

I didn’t know what was going on. Across the field, the slurper stood up finally. It raised its hat slowly at me, as if thanking me. Then it walked off with that same step, step, step, freeze pattern.

I was shaking like a leaf. Fudge wouldn’t stop barking. It hurt me to have to keep my boy outside, but after what I just witnessed, what was I supposed to do? I locked all the doors, including the doggy door, and slept with the 12-gauge instead of Fudge that night.

Except I hardly slept. I kept thinking about that slurper. Whether or not I was seeing things, then trying to make sense of what I saw. On one hand, it explained where my premium water disappeared to, but on the other, it didn’t explain a damn thing.

If I bought more water, I’d be spending money I didn’t have to pay to basically invite the slurper back. If I didn’t pay, the field would go fallow, and I’d be out a good six figures.

I thought about setting some kind of trap for it. But what kind? A bear trap? I thought about poisoning the water. That was stupid. I just watched it with my own eyes drink up my rice paddy. Hell, I didn’t even know what this thing was, let alone what I’d do even if I did catch it.

By sunrise, I checked on Fudge. He was still outside, curled up by the door, looking depressed. I unbolted it and he popped right up, tail wagging. He seemed normal. But what was normal anymore?

We walked the land and I made my way to the spot the slurper was.

There were no footprints. No traces that anybody or anything was here.

“You saw it, Fudge,” I said. “You saw it up close, didn’t you, boy?”

Fudge wagged his tail. After last night, he’d do anything to get back in my good graces. The paddy was bone-dry. I decided not to flood it again. If the slurper came back for water, I told myself I’d be ready with the 12-gauge to fill it with regret.

When I woke up that night after a long nap, it took me a minute to remember what was what. But it didn’t take long for the adrenaline to kick in. I grabbed the shotgun and crept out of the room. Fudge bolted in front of me, ready to go outside. It was dark and I held my breath, moving through the hallway into the kitchen.

The moon was fuller, shining a little more light down on the field. I peered through the window. There was nothing I could see. I pointed the flashlight out there. Still nothing. I didn’t want to get my hopes up, so I heated up some leftover stew and waited another hour.

“You think it’s gone for good, Fudge?” I said.

Fudge wagged his tail. My eyes hurt and I didn’t see the point waiting around. I cut off the kitchen light and headed back to bed.

Then I heard a knock.

From the back of the house. Fudge started barking. I stayed still. No way I was answering that. I moved through the hall, keeping the shotgun aimed at whatever dared to come through.

Listening closely, I heard a voice. It was garbled and hard to make out, like somebody talking underwater. “Follow,” it said, or that’s what it sounded like. “You must follow.”

I didn’t say a damn thing.

Then a pale hand with more than a bunch fingers (I didn’t count, but it was more than five) slid through the doggy dog, inch by inch, until the slurper’s arm was inside, bare and like crinkled paper.

I kept my mouth shut.

“Don’t let it grow,” it said. “You can’t let it grow.”

My knee was screaming at me as I crouched down.

I aimed the muzzle through the doggy dog and pulled that trigger. In that split second, Dylan’s face flashed in front of me. Startled, I dropped the gun on the floor.

Outside, I heard a squeal. Then running.

Maybe I killed it, maybe not, I can’t say. I couldn’t get that slurping sound out of my head, but whatever it was hasn’t shown up again. I let three days go by without flooding the field. By the fourth, I bought more water and flooded the paddy, thinking I could save the season. Rice usually takes just a few days to sprout.

Nothing showed. For months, nothing showed.

But in late July, something did show. If you know anything about rice, you know this is when it flowers and grains start to form. The panicle pushes out from the stem. It’s called “heading.” In August, right around now, the kernels fill out and the fields shift from green to golden.

At least that’s what’s supposed to happen.

That morning in July, Fudge and I did our routine, checked the pumps, adjusted the dams. But there, out in the middle of the paddy, something was rising up from the muck. I almost stepped right on it, thinking it was nothing but a patch of pale mud. It was soft and bloated and kind of see-through. If you ever peeled that film off the pot after boiling hot dogs, you might get an idea. Or like when a cow’s giving birth, if you’ve ever seen that. I leaned in, shielding my mouth, afraid it would burst in my face.

Underneath this bubble, I saw things moving, like worms but not worms. More like rice grains, wriggling together, in unison, like little synchronized swimmers. Every few seconds, the whole thing would swell up, then sink back down, and the wriggling things would shift directions all together.

It’s really hard to explain. I took some pictures, but I got no clue what the hell this thing is. Fudge won’t go near it. And I can’t tell folks around here. If buyers catch wind, my ranch is dead in the water. That’s why I’m posting here. If anybody knows what this is or what the hell I’m supposed to do with it (or not do), please say something.

It won’t stop growing.
