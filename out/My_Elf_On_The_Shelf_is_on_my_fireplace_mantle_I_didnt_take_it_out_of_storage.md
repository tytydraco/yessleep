\*These are two parts that I posted earlier this week, but they got deleted so I made a new account, and I’ll move them to this subreddit for now.\*

I’ve never been the type of person to decorate for Christmas, the most I’ll set up is a small teetering Christmas tree, with maybe the rare ornament. Except every year without fail, I’ll take out my old elf-on-the-shelf. It’s probably around 20 years old at this point. I still remember when my parents brought it home. The bright green and red box, fresh from the supermarket. 

But enough of that, the reason I made this post is that I don’t remember taking it out of storage. Yesterday it appeared on my fireplace mantle, right next to the remaining Halloween decorations I’m yet to put away. I didn’t notice it at first (I’ve been moved to new meds that make me drowsy) but later in the day, when I was eating lunch I spotted it. I think that it was there all day. I don’t remember seeing it when I first woke up. It might have just been because I was tired.

To give some background on why this is weird, I live alone. I’ve lived in this house since I was 15 when I moved here with my grandma. I’m 22 now and even my grandma is long gone. Every year she would hide Dandy in different places around the house. She did this to help ‘spruce up this old house’ when I fell into depression after my mom got cancer.

But anyway, I put it into storage the year she died, and I haven’t had the heart to take it back out, it reminds me of the two most important people in my life (a reminder I definitely don’t need). After my grandma died I got access to my grandma’s inheritance and in turn, my late mother’s (I don’t know Grandma Stine got it, but my mom wanted everything to go to her). I used it to pay for my first year and a half of college, but I dropped out after a series of very unfortunate occurrences. 

Wow, I didn’t realize how much I needed to distract myself from this shitshow. Dandy doesn’t look right. Her hat is too red, her shoes are too white, but the scarf my grandma crocheted still rests on her shoulders. I think I’ll leave her out for now, I’ll get the rest of my Christmas decor out from storage soon. It’s kind of creepy, but it was just Halloween and horror movie season so I’m probably feeling the effects of that.

Dandy moved again. I finally put away my Halloween decor yesterday after I first saw her on the mantle, and now my Christmas decor is up. I didn’t do that either. I thought that my best friend might have snuck in and done it (she’s a massive prankster) But now I’m not so sure. I checked my doorbell’s camera and she never came up to my door. Dandy is in my glass display case, above my desk now (she’s peeking around the corner at a framed photo of my mom, grandma, and me.) This is getting a little weird, she might have come in though my garage? She doesn't have the garage code though.

Sorry that this is so short, I keep forgetting to post. 

\*There’s one or two more from my old account, but I’ll post that here soon, I’ve got places to be right now.\*
