I always had a soft spot for the kids who didn't fit in.

Nerds. Geeks. Dweebs. Dorks. Weirdos. Rejects. Nobodies. Misfits. Losers.

Or even other outsiders, like myself.

Whatever our label, we all had one thing in common...

...Deemed unworthy by the popular kids because we didn't conform to their societal norms, we were often bullied, teased, shoved in lockers, and beaten up...

...So we had to stick together.

Which is why, when Franklin showed up to junior homeroom in the spring of 1995, every inch of his body completely wrapped in gauze from head to toe, including his abnormally large potbelly, I couldn't help but be intrigued.

No one knew where he came from or why, but the running theory was that his childhood home had burned down, and he barely survived, leaving his body covered in burns that he covered up in gauze to prevent unwarranted ridicule.

I would have asked him myself, since he sat directly in front of me in homeroom, but the thing about Franklin was, he didn't really talk. Or communicate in any way, sign language or otherwise.

So during lunch break, I found other ways to communicate with him, like drawing pictures of things, which he seemed to like, often nodding and grunting when happy.

Now, I don't know if it was because I was just a hopeless romantic emo girl, or missed my best friend and childhood crush, Brian, who had gone missing just a few weeks prior, but Franklin very quickly filled the void that Brian once did.

And within a couple weeks, I was convinced that I was in love.

Franklin, on the other hand, remained coy, and difficult to read, but after the countless hours we spent together, I was starting to sense that he might be warming up to me as well.

So when the Prom came around that May, I knew what I had to do.

"Frankin..."

He turned and looked at me.

"There's something I want to ask you."

He grunted, and tilted his head to the side, as if anticipating my question.

"Will you go to the Prom with me?"

He paused for a moment and simply stared at me for a while, during which time my palms grew sweaty and my knee began tapping nervously.

Until he eventually grunted, which I took as an enthusiastic "Yes."

Now, it's important to know that just before the Prom, another one of our classmates went missing. Having disappeared under the same circumstances as Brian, leaving home for school one day, and never returning.

But luckily, rather than cancel the Prom, the school just brought on twice as many chaperones as they usually did.

The night of the Prom was magical. After helping Franklin climb into a suit, his bandages often catching on it and revealing a surprisingly hairy body underneath them, I took his hands and pinned a corsage onto my dress.

We then proceeded to walk from my house to the school, hand in hand, as my parents looked on, surely confused by my choice of date, but happy that I was happy.

When we first arrived at the Prom, I was taken aback by the presentation. Our sad little gym, which I normally wouldn't be caught dead in, had been transformed into a romantic wonderland, complete with a disco ball, streamers, and balloons, and packed with teenagers dressed to the nines.

After we each grabbed some punch from the punch bowl, a slow song came on over the loudspeakers. I took Franklin by the hand, led him out onto the dance floor, and after slow dancing for a while, rested my head on his shoulder. And for a brief moment, all was well in the world.

But after the dance, Franklin grew restless, and set off to what I thought was the bathroom.

I waited for a good fifteen minutes. And after Franklin didn't return, went to see what was the matter.

Exiting the gym and heading off down the uncharacteristically darkened hallway, I remember hearing the Prom music fade off into the distance as I ventured deeper and deeper into the school.

That's when I heard... another noise.

Sure enough, it sounded like Franklin's grunting, but louder and... different than usual.

"Frankin?" I called out, my voice echoing down the hallway.

But he didn't reply. I just continued to hear the same grunting sound, growing louder and louder as I neared a corner.

And when I finally turned it, my heart sank, as I saw Franklin seemingly making out with another girl.

"Franklin! How dare you!" I cried out.

That's when he turned around, and I saw that he wasn't making out with the girl...

...He was devouring her.

And behind the gauze that was once wrapped around his face, which had now come unraveled, I saw a horrifying mouth, made up of both a set of mandibles and razor sharp teeth, with blood pouring out of it.

Franklin dropped the girl, whose mangled body fell to the floor with a splash, as it landed in her own pool of blood.

He then proceeded to stare at me, as the gauze covering his pot belly unraveled, and a second set of arms unfolded.

That's when I realized that Franklin was no burn victim. He was a cryptid. And the bodies that had been disappearing, were surely his doing. Bodies that included my former best friend Brian.

Standing there, frozen in horror, I thought about running...

...But before I could do so, I heard a group of classmates approaching.

And when they turned the corner, I was shocked to find...

...The most popular clique of kids in my class, an unrivaled pairing of about eight guys and girls that included members of both the men's football team and girls field hockey team, and included the Prom King and Queen themselves.

When they saw Franklin and what he had done to his victim, their first reaction was horror, their jaws dropping as they backed away. 

But their fear quickly turned to anger, as the Prom King, Ethan, called out to me, "What do you losers think you're doing? Killing people on Prom night?"

"It wasn't-"
 
But before I could explain myself, one of the field hockey girls interrupted.

"Look at her Prom date! I always assumed he'd look like a monster under there... I never thought he'd actually be one."

"Please, let me explain!" I cried out.

Bu lt they ignored my plea, and circled Franklin and myself.

"Let's make them pay for what they've done!" The Prom King cried out.

"Nooo!" I screamed.

But it was totally late.

The entire group of them began beating us both to a bloody pulp, punching, kicking, and stomping away at us, until I was almost knocked unconscious, and Franklin's insectoid body was nearly cracked open, as green ooze began to seep out of his thorax.

As we both lay there, helpless and writhing in pain, I looked over at Franklin, who looked back at me with his compound eyes, and began twitching.

"Oh we're not done with you yet." The Prom King said to us, before calling out to one of his friends. "Go find a weapon." 

"Why don't we just call the police?" The Prom Queen replied.

But he ignored his date, and signaled for his friend to contine. "Go. Now."

His minion ran off, back down the dark, hallway, in search of a weapon, while the other popular kids gathered around us again, this time smirking and laughing at what they'd done to us.

"It's always the losers you have to be afraid of." One of them said. "They're capable of anything."

That's when the Prom King began to grow impatient with his friend, and decided to take things into his own  hands.

"I can't wait any longer. I'll just do it myself."

He crouched down to the floor, where Franklin was standing, and began pummeling him again.

Over. And over. And over...

...Until suddenly, Franklin's second pair of arms creeped up around Ethan, wrapped around his torso, and cracked him in half, like a metal cracker breaking a lobster, and tossed his lifeless body aside.

That's when Franklin proceeded to hop up from the floor, and eradicate every single member of the popular mob, tearing some to pieces, devouring others, and clawing some clean in half, as I watched on in horror.

When no popular kid was left standing, the one they sent off to find a weapon came barreling around the corner with a baseball bat, only to double back and horror and run away as fast as possible.

Franklin turned to me. 

"You monster!" I cried out, my love for him turning to contempt. "You killed them! And that poor girl! And my best friend Brian!"

But he showed no remorse, instead slowly approaching, all four of his arms raised, his mandibles clicking away.

Not knowing what else to do, I ran as fast as I could, down the dark hallways to the very cafeteria, where Franklin and I had once bonded.

Sensing him behind me, I hopped the divider separating the cafeteria from the kitchen, and hid in the corner of the room.

That's when I heard him hop the divider as well, the sound of his clicking mandibles growing louder and louder as he closed in on me.

I sat there, cowering in the corner of the kitchen, crying and shaking, reflecting on the fact that Franklin had turned from love of my life to literal monster in a single night, and knew what I had to do.

So when he finally reached the spot where I was hiding, I reached for a butcher knife, hopped out from my hiding spot, and proceeded to flail it around as intensely as I could, hacking his arms and legs off and leaving him lying there, green goo oozing out of his torso, as he writhed like a swatted bug in its final moments.

Franklin simply looked up at me, a look of sadness in his insectoid eyes.

That's when I noticed something dangling from one of his severed arms.

Upon further inspection, I saw that it was one of the drawings I had made for him, when I first asked him to the Prom. A drawing of him and me, in a suit and dress respectively, holding hands, a ray of sunshine suspended in the sky above us.

But before I could react, my Prom date's eyes closed, and his body stopped moving.

Franklin was dead.

A tear rolled down my cheek, as I dropped the butcher knife, my hands still shaking in fear.

And despite the fact that I felt terrible for doing what I had done, deep down inside I knew that he had killed Brian, and a couple other classmates, and surely wouldn't have stopped any time soon.

A little while later, I dragged Franklin's body and limbs out one of the side doors and buried him in the woods behind the high school, where a large stone still marks his grave to this day.

Years later, while the disappearances of those students still remain a mystery to the police, only I know the identity of the monster that was responsible for their deaths...

...Franklin, my cryptid Prom date.
