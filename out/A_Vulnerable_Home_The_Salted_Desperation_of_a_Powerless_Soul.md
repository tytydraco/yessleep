# The Salted Desperation of a Powerless Soul

**A strange sound.** As if something is calling me from the depths of a dark abyss. Opening my eyes I am overcome by a thick, green liquid that is slithering out from the walls and floors of my apartment.

It is alive, creeping around my furniture like an unyielding monster, leaving a slimy, sticky residue in its wake. It is a sight of horror, like something from a nightmare, a swamp full of toxic waste that has come alive. The liquid is dark and murky, swirling around my belongings, slowly devouring them one by one.

My shock quickly turns to panic. The liquid is hungry and determined. It has already taken my brocade sofa, and my ebony coffee table is quickly succumbing to its fearsome suckerage.

Paralysed. Unable to think of a way to stop it. I run to my window and cry "HELP! HELP! WON'T ANYBODY HELP!"

My lament is lost in the still quiet of the night. I am desperately alone, and the liquid continues to gain strength. My heart pounds in my chest and my mind races as I try to find a way to save what I hold dear.

Despair is creeping in, threatening to consume me like the liquid is consuming my home. I am lost and alone, desperate for a way to combat this relentless force. The liquid moves forward, taking and devouring everything in its path, and I am left with nothing but a feeling of helplessness.

In my moment of desperation, I reach deep within and locate a gumption, a determination to stand up in my bed-things, to raise my delicate fists and fight. I lock my gaze onto the liquid and I know that I must act, must take control of the situation. Its hunger is evident, an insatiable beast that will consume everything I love.

The cupboards and closets of my apartment are near empty, my eyes darting around the room. Then I see it. Salt. I snatch up the container of salt and my heart races with excitement. I quickly pour a line of salt around the edges of the room, creating a barrier between the liquid and my belongings.

My adrenaline is pumping as I watch the liquid slowly retreat and hide in the corners of the room. I feel a rush of triumph. My plan is working. I add more salt to the perimeter, enclosing the liquid in a tight circle. I smile in satisfaction as I watch it slowly become powerless, its hunger quelled by my barrier of protection.

For the first time since this nightmare began, I am filled with hope. I had found a way to contain the liquid and protect my things. I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that I had found a solution to this problem. I have conquered this relentless force, and I can now rest peacefully knowing my home is safe.

The power I have wielded fills me with awe, the strength I have found within myself. I have fought off the green liquid and saved my precious possessions, but the feeling of dread and despair still lingers deep within me. The sharp blade of panic still slices through me, and I know that this is only the beginning.

The mysterious liquid may still be there, multiplying and growing in size and strength. I can feel its hunger, like a living thing that is determined to consume all that stands in its way. I am filled with a sudden, overwhelming fear. I know that I must stay vigilant, that I must remain ever-watchful of the enemy that threatens to overtake me.
