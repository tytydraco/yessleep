What I am about to tell you will sound crazy, but I need your help, so please, read. 3 days ago my parents and my older brother went to my cousin’s wedding. Me and my brother are not very fond of parties or of my extended family,  but since he’s the elder son, my parents always drag him along to family reunions. To endure these ordeals he always takes his earbuds with him. 

Since we moved to our current home, about 10 years ago, things always went ‘missing’ out of the blue, a key, a toy car, the tv controller… and there was no point in looking for the missing objects, we could search all over the house, and never find them. Nowadays when something goes missing my father will say:  

“forget it and it will find its way back to you”

And every time, without failure, he was correct, because after a couple days or weeks, sometimes entire months, the missing item would be found in an incredibly obvious location. Me and my family figured this was a normal occurrence, easily explained by healthy faults in our memories and so on, so we got used to it and lived normal lives. 

On that faithful day, my brother could not find his earbuds, so I said the words that our father had imprinted in our brains: 

“forget it and it will find its way back to you”

He nodded in agreement and said:

“hopefully It will show up soon” 

My father and My mother were already waiting for him in the car, I said my farewells from the front door and they left; I wish they didn’t.

I had spent that entire day reading Blood Meridian, in fact, I carried the book with me to the front porch, and as I was going back I left the book on the dining table, to the right of the hallway that leads to my room.

I sat down on my office chair and booted up my PC. I spent the rest of the evening playing video games. It was around 9 pm when I heard it. 

\*thump\* 

Coming from the end of the hallway, the sound of a hardcover book hitting the wood floor. I figured it was my book, I must've left it in some awkward position on the table.

I got up and opened the door of my bedroom… then I saw it. A person... a creature... something, about half my size, just finishing a small jump from the right of the hallway to the left, the book laid in the right, at the foot of the dining table. I was immediately paralyzed, I just stood there, like a deer in front of headlights.

 A pitch black hand, with elongated, clawed fingers reached from the edge of the wall all the way to the other side of the hallway, grabbed the book, and quickly went into hiding… slowly, the dark figure put its head out of the edge and for a split second our eyes met. 

My heart was beating out of control, I was on the verge of puking as I hastily closed and locked my bedroom door, I heard footsteps approaching me, I broke down crying in a corner.

It’s been 3 days, no one is picking up on my calls… no one is answering my messages, my family has not returned, I hear inhuman sounds just outside my room, I see shadows moving, creeping in and out of what I hope is a familiar hallway, I’m too scared to look out the window, I’m thirsty and hungry. I’m not sure that this text will reach anyone, but I’m desperate…. Please, find me.
