My wife, Laura, is an avid doll collector. 

The first time we met, I accidentally broke a porcelain doll she'd just bought. It led to apologies, coffees and later into late night calls and dates.

One thing I learnt in the five years we've been together is that, she loves dolls, maybe a tad bit too much.

The problem, per se, started after the birth of our daughter. The pregnancy was really hard for Laura, especially the weight gain.

She was so obsessed with having the perfect body that the pregnancy changes in her body almost had her going crazy.

So it wasn't surprising when Laura started going to the gym very soon after her delivery.

I don't know how but she did lose a lot of weight in a couple of months. She became almost all skin and bones, a doll like body, she called it.

"I want to be a doll", Laura said one night.

I thought she was joking.

But Laura became obsessed with doll like features. 

The perfect hourglass body, pointy chin, small full lips.

One day, she left a note saying that she'd be back and just vanished.

No replies to calls, texts, nothing.

Four days later, she came back with her whole face bandaged.

"Where the fuck were you?", I screeched, holding our daughter in my hands.

"Pennsylvania. There was a surgeon there who said he'd help me"

And help her he did. When Laura finally decided to let me see her face,  she really did look like a doll. But it felt wrong, very wrong.

Things were getting somewhat back to normal or as normal as it could get I guess.

It was a Tuesday night that I first noticed the stitches. 

Around the wrist of Laura's left hand was perfectly placed stitches. I actually thought it was a tattoo at first, but the texture once I touched it confirmed that it was real stitches.

This was getting even creepier. What the actual hell was she doing to her body?

I wanted to talk to her about it the next morning but she began to actively avoid me to such an extent that I had to hire a babysitter for our baby.

Laura would go out before I woke up with a note saying 'out on a jog' and she'd not be back even after I returned from work. I wasn't even sure if she came back during some days.

I finally saw her after 17 days. She was in the nursery, holding our baby in her arms and looking out the window.

She was wearing a long sleeved turtle neck but I could see a hint of stitches sticking out at the top around her neck.

"I'm really really happy. Do you want to be happy?", her voice was odd, hollow.

"I'm happy as long as I'm with you both", I could hear the quiver in my voice.

She turned to face me fully then. She still had the odd doll like features, but her eyes.. they were different. It was almost all black, no part of her iris to be seen.

"Let's all be happy together, me, you and our sweet girl", the smile she gave me then was sure to give me nightmares for years to come.

The corner of her lips stretched wider, her teeth looked stained with something black. The teeth didn't look human.

She slowly walked towards me and gave me the baby.

"I'll be waiting for you in the bedroom", she gave me the same smile again.

I just nodded, clutching my baby close.

I watched as she entered our bedroom, as soon as she was out of my sight, I bolted down the stairs.

I hurriedly opened the door and got in the car, baby still in my arms.

Laura watched through our bedroom window as I backed out of the driveway, that smile streching her face wider.

I've been living in a hotel for a week now. 

I wish this would've ended with Laura, but when I was changing my daughter's diaper today, I noticed a stitch in the crease of her ankle. Same as the one Laura had.
