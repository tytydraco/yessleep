I never should have entered that antique store, and I definitely shouldn’t have bought that mask. Gannon’s is known for buying and selling rare and unique antiques, and I wanted to impress my friends with a unique Halloween costume this year, so I thought the perfect solution would be to get my hands on a genuine antique costume, one of those strange, ultra creepy ones from the 1800’s or earlier. Sure, it would cost me, but can you really put a price on standing out?

The bell over the door jingled dully as I opened the door and walked in. The proprietor, and gray, bent over man with a thick, bushy beard and thick, round rimmed spectacles who was ninety if he was a day casually acknowledged me and went back to the ancient book he was examining.

The store wasn’t big, but it had space, only every last bit of that space was filled with relics of bygone eras. Not the usual furniture, silverware, and paintings of your typical antique shop. No. Everything here had a story, and as such, everything here commanded a premium price.

There was an old cavalry saber that was known to have killed no less than seven men in the Civil War. It even still had flecks of blood from its victims spattered along the blade and hilt. There was an old rope noose that had supposedly been used to hang a witch during the Salem Witch Trials. There was an ancient tome with strange symbols on the cover that once belonged to a European court wizard. There was even a hat that once belonged to a certain H. H. Holmes. The stories attached to each item were historical, mystical, and often macabre. And I loved it.

I didn’t believe in magic or mysticism, angels and demons, or anything else beyond what science could explain. That didn’t mean that I wasn’t fascinated by stories involving them though. How much more interesting would the world be if the supernatural actually did exist? It was a tantalizing proposition, and it’s why I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.

It was a wolf mask. Not a mask made to look like a wolf, but a mask made out of the skin and fur of a wolf’s head and neck. It was a masterful work of preservation and artistry that looked as alive on display that day as the creature itself must have looked in life.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over and around in my hand so I could see it from every angle. The work was beyond fine. I couldn’t even see the seams and threads that held it together. Not a single hair seemed to be missing from the thick, gray fur. The teeth were real, and firmly fixed into the snout. I assumed they were so well-done because the original jaws had been used to form the snarling mouth. The eyes were glass, and far too lifelike for such an aged item. Perfect replicas of thin glass set in the eye sockets.

I had to have it.

I checked the story card next to the original display. The price was outrageous, but I didn’t care. Not only was the mask perfect, but the supposed history couldn’t have been more ideal for the season.

It read simply: *Enchanted mask made from the preserved skin of a Loup Garou slain in Burgundy, France in 1137 AD. Do not wear at night.*

“Oh hohohoho,” I grunted excitedly. “I have plans for you!”

I brought the mask and story card to the checkout. Old man Gannon checked the item, and me with more scrutiny than I was really comfortable with before speaking. “Heed the warning boy,” he said sternly. “It wouldn’t do for you to tempt fate.”

I chuckled, ignoring the fact that he called me “boy”. He was probably the oldest man in town, so everyone was “boy” or “girl” to him. “You don’t have to worry about me,” I assured him. “You got any more documentation that goes with this? If I’m going to fork over two-thousand dollars for a mask, I want as much provenance as I can get.”

Old man Gannon grunted derisively. “Of course I have documents that go with it. A fair few actually. Be sure that you read them and take proper precautions.”

“Of course,” I replied seriously, lying through my teeth. The supernatural is not real after all. It’s a myth, legend, just stories. What this mask was, to me, was the foundation of the absolute best Halloween costume I had ever concocted. Sure, a werewolf costume wouldn’t be especially unique, but with that mask, it would be the most frighteningly real one our town had ever seen.

The old man went into the back room and quickly returned with a binder filled with documents in protectors, and a small leatherbound journal. “These are the provenance,” he declared. “The journal is of particular interest as it belonged to a previous owner of the mask, a Mr. Archibald Wembly of London, wrote it in the years Fifteen-Twelve through Fifteen-Fourteen. He went mad after wearing the mask and killed two people before he was cut down in the street. Witnesses swore that he looked more animal than man before he died. The police report is document one-hundred-twenty-three.”

I set the mask on the counter and quickly leafed through the documents. There were originals, and English translations for each. “All this and you’re only charging two-thousand dollars?” I asked incredulously. “Such a unique relic with this much provenance together . . . it has to be worth more.”

Old man Gannon nodded his head. “Yes. Yes it is,” he confirmed. “I actually paid more for it myself, but . . .” he trailed off. “Something about that particular item unsettles me. I wish to be rid of it sooner rather than later, so I’m taking a loss for my own peace of mind.”

I didn’t question it. If this old man was willing to let his superstitions be my gain, I was perfectly fine with it. I paid for the mask and happily took it home.

Looking back, I should never have been so sure of myself. Nor so proud. Nor so certain about how the world works. The events that followed changed my perspective of the nature of reality itself, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to how I was.

In my defense, and also to remove any possibility that I can claim ignorance if I get desperate enough, I need to confess that I did read the provenance documents right away. I didn’t read them to get any warnings to heed, or as some kind of user manual. I read them to learn the history of my beautiful, terrifyingly creepy wolf mask. Having the story at the tip of my tongue top tell at will would truly be the icing on what I knew would be a most impressive, and frightening cake, or, rather, costume.

The earliest documents were all about the supposed Loup Garou that was terrorizing the Burgundian countryside, and the hunt to put an end to the gruesome string of murders it was blamed for. Document twenty was a notice celebrating that the foul beast had finally been killed and skinned by a visiting huntsman who only asked to be allowed to keep the skin and take it back to him home as his reward. The local ruler, only too happy to get off so cheaply, permitted it.

The huntsman wrote that he brought the hide to a supposed witch named Lucia, who lived alone on a mountain named Muzsla in modern day Slovakia. He paid her handsomely with instructions to use the hide to create an item of power. One that would make him strong.

Apparently, she obliged, making the wolf mask, and he was happy, but it came with a strict set of rules. 1. Never wear the mask at night. 2. Never wear the mask on the day or night of the full moon. 3. Never wear the mask during the autumnal equinox. 4. Always invoke the name of Christ before donning the mask.

The man must have been wildly superstitious, because he followed the rules religiously. The following documents are filled with fanciful tales of the huntsman performing mighty deeds that led to him earning a minor lordship before retiring to administer his land holdings and eventually dying of old age.

What followed after was one document after another that spoke of the mask passing to a new owner who either did not read, or chose not to follow the rules, and how each one ultimately went mad, committing a varying number of murders, and being either killed during the apprehension, or executed for their crimes. It gained a reputation as a cursed item that turned men into mindless beasts and drove them to kill and even cannibalize their victims.

“Holy crap!” I exclaimed as I finished reading the last page in the binder. “This is even better than I thought! I wonder what that Wembly guy wrote in his diary!”

It was getting late, so I decided to put off reading the diary for another day. I picked up my mask and looked it over, admiring it for both its craftsmanship and its history. “You just might be the coolest thing I’ll ever own,” I said to it as I caressed its cheek.

I looked into the glass eyes, and maybe it was a trick of the light, or maybe it was the lateness of the hour playing tricks with my mind, but I could have sworn those eyes, those glass eyes, looked back at me.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next morning to my girlfriend letting herself into my apartment. Her key clicked in the lock, and the door squeaked noisily as she opened it.

“Wake up sleepyhead!” she called.

I sat up and groaned in response as I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. I checked the clock on my nightstand, saw the time, and got annoyed. “It’s seven a.m. on a Saturday!”

“We have plan’s remember?” she called out. “We’re supposed to . . . what is this?” she asked. Her tone changed from businesslike to pure excitement.

I stepped out of my bedroom clad in nothing but my night pants. She was excitedly holding up the wolf mask and admiring it. “It’s a cursed wolf mask,” I replied with a yawn. “It’s the centerpiece of my Halloween costume this year.”

“It’s looks so real,” she said admiringly, then her expression darkened and she put the mask down on the table. “Did you say ‘cursed’?” she sharply inquired.

“Yeah,” I yawned again. “It’s almost a thousand years old. The documents it came with say that a bunch of its previous owners went psycho and started killing people.”

“And you bought it?” she practically shrieked. “And you’re going to wear it?”

I filled the coffee maker and turned it on. “Don’t tell me you believe in magic, voodoo, curses, and all that nonsense,” I replied tiredly.

She took pause at that. I knew her answer, it was a major point of agreement between us. What science can’t explain either isn’t real, or just hasn’t been properly explained yet. Nothing is supernatural.

She finally replied. It’s just . . .” she paused. “If a bunch of people who owned it really did turn into psycho killers, there’s gotta be something there.”

I poured a cup of black coffee from the still brewing pot and took a sip. It was too hot but I didn’t care. “Sure there is,” I replied. “Social contagion. People believe it’s cursed, so they respond as though it’s cursed. It’s nothing special.”

It must have made sense to her, because he whole attitude changed again. “Have you tried it on yet?” she asked with a slight smile, her fear replaced with the admiration and curiosity she had when she first laid eyes on the mask.

It struck me that I hadn’t, so I picked it up, looked my girlfriend in the eyes, said “Jesus Christ” in a mocking tone, and put it on. It felt . . . perfect, as though it were made just for me. It slipped over my head easily and seemed to snug down to a perfect form fit. It had no odor, and I could see clearly with a full field of view through the glass eyes. “Not until just now,” I replied teasingly.

“EEEEK!” she shrieked.

“What?” I asked, alarmed, turning my head rapidly to see what had so alarmed her.

“The mouth moved when you talked!” she squealed. “It moved, and it moved in a perfect match for your words!”

I cocked my head to the side and looked at her quizzically. “For real?” I asked. It’s moving with my mouth?”

“Yes!’ she said excitedly. “Go see in the mirror!”

I did. I spoke. “Abracadabra, hocus pokus, jiggedy jokeus!” I said to my reflection.

Sure enough, the mouth moved in a lupine imitation of my own mouth movements. The movement were so well synced that I could swear I even saw the lips move although I knew it to be impossible. I took the mask off and admired it with the fattest grin of all time on my face.

“That’s amazing!” I exclaimed. “That old witch was a real master! I didn’t know people even knew how to make a mask’s mouth move in the twelfth century!?

“I know right?” My girlfriend, Tiffany said with as much excitement as I felt. “You’re going to have an amazing Halloween costume this year!”

I removed the mask, smiled at her, an nodded my head in affirmation.

“Just one thing,” she said with a hint of confusion. “What’s with that thing you said before you put the mask on?”

It took me a moment to remember what she was talking about. “Oh!” I snapped my fingers as I remembered. “There was a silly little list of rules, I was mocking them.” I grabbed the folder of provenance and flipped to the page with the rules on it. “See?” I said, pointing at the small passage. “Four ridiculous rules.”

Tiffany read them quickly and looked at me with a touch of confusion. “People actually believed this crap?” she said incredulously.

“I know, right?” I laughed.

She laughed with me for a bit, then stopped suddenly and glared at me. “Wait a minute,” she said sternly. “How much did you pay for this mask anyway?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The next few days were perfectly ordinary until the seventeenth. That was the day I finished assembling my costume, and one of two full moons in a row this year. I remember bringing home a pair of retro ripped jeans to go with the red plaid flannel shirt, theater prop quality werewolf gloves, complete with a set of long claws tipping the fingers, and other clothing reminiscent of an 80’s era movie werewolf.

The sun had set hours earlier. I obtained the pants shopping with Tiffany after our dinner date, and I was absolutely thrilled. I couldn’t wait to try it all on and see how it went together.

It was glorious. I donned the outfit, then slowly, almost ritualistically lowered the mask over my head to complete the costume.

It was like magic in the mirror. I looked myself over, and I loved what I saw. I looked like something out of Teen Wolf, only better. Sure, I could have achieved something very much like it far more cheaply. I could have just gone to Spirit Halloween, bought a costume or a rubber mask, and went to Walmart for finishing touches and adjustments, and done a satisfactory job for under $200, but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted the rizz. I wanted to stand out among all the other costumed partygoers at the fraternity Halloween party. This costume absolutely did it, and I couldn’t have been happier.

In my ecstasy, I noticed a . . . feeling running through my body, as though there was a kind of . . . energy coursing through me. It wasn’t as simple as “a burning in my blood” or “my nerves were on fire”. No, it was a feeling of power, as though I was still myself, but also something . . . more.

I felt as though I could toss four men over my shoulders and run a marathon. I felt as though I could get in a bar fight and kick every ass in the place. I felt . . . godly.

I removed the mask after a few minutes and inspected my outfit without it. I felt normal again, and, somehow, it felt wrong. I felt like my ordinary self was somehow no longer enough. I felt incomplete, like I removed a piece of myself when I removed the mask.

“Stop being ridiculous,” I told my reflection. “You’re letting myth and superstition influence you. You’re better than that!”

And yet, I felt like I was lying to myself. Right there, staring at my reflection, I felt like the man looking back at me wasn’t really me, like something unknowable was missing. I looked at my reflection and it felt as though I was looking at someone else, someone I didn’t really know, and who could never truly know me in return.

I shook my head to clear the strange thoughts and center myself again. “Pictures!” I reminded myself. “Tiffany wanted pictures so she could put together something complementary.”

I took out my phone and held it up to the mirror to take a picture, and paused. I couldn’t send her a picture like this. My costume was incomplete. I needed to wear the mask or else my costume wasn’t really my costume, and how could she possibly match her costume to mine if I sent her an incomplete photo?

I picked up the mask to put it on and paused. I paused to look at it, to admire it. I looked into its lifelike glass eyes. I stroked its fur as though it were a living thing. “You’re mine,” I told it in a low, almost silent voice. “You’re mine, and I am your master!”

I continued to stare into those perfectly crafted glass eyes, losing myself in them, and wanting nothing in the world so much as I wanted to put that mask on and forget myself. Slowly, almost robotically, I raised it up and gently lowered it over my head.

I felt a rush of euphoria, like what I felt earlier only a hundred times more potent. I took my phone in hand, opened the camera app, raised it, and snapped a single picture of myself in the mirror.

I opened text messaging, selected Tiffany, attached the message, and typed the following text: “It’s complete, and now I’m complete.”

I hit send. I looked into the mirror and met my own gaze staring back at me through those glass eyes that had no business looking as real and alive as they did, and then the world went blank.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke the next day with no idea where I was. I opened my eyes only to be greeted by the rising sun in the middle of a forest.

A forest?

There was a forest outside of town, but it wasn’t exactly a short walk if you catch my drift.

It was easily a half an hour’s drive once you got out of town, and not exactly the kind of thing you just get up and walk to like you’re taking the dog out to the local community park.

I woke up there, and not on the edge either, but well inside the borders, and I was covered in a red, sticky substance that could only be blood, and my stomach hurt like I had gotten drunk and did my best to eat my own body weight at the local Asian buffet.

“What the . . .” I trailed off as I looked at my hands and arms and was taken aback by the dried red and brown goop covering them. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still in my costume, and my clothing was utterly ruined, covered in a deep red liquid that was surely blood.

I realized that I was still wearing the mask, and I ripped it off of my head in a panic. My breath came in great heaves, uncontrollable, and my head began to swim as I hyperventilated.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down. I made myself breathe slower, and slower, and slower still until I finally brought it down to normal. I focused on my heart rate, and gradually brought it down with a blend of deep breathing and mind clearing.

Once I had myself physically under control, I looked at myself again.

How did I get covered in such a disgustingly massive amount of blood? Why did my stomach hurt so much? How did the wolf mask manage to stay clean when the rest of me was drenched in filth? And why did I-

My stomach finally gave up and rebelled. I dropped the wolf mask and fell to my knees retching and vomiting a copious amount of stomach contents. I vomited even as I found myself losing my breath and desperately wanting to breathe. I vomited even as my lack of breath began to make my head swim. I vomited even as my vision blurred and blackened at the edges.

Then I was able to breathe again. I took in great, gasping gulps of air. I I heaved and panted as I sought to restore my oxygen supply.

Then I vomited again.

If possible, I can say that the second round was worse than the third. It didn’t hit me so continuously as to cut me off from breathing completely like the first round did, but it did let me get just enough breath to barely subsist before striking again until I thought I would surely pass out, and then it subsided just long enough to tease me again before taking over and nearly choking me to death over and over and over again until I wished that I could just die and get it over with,

When I was finally finished, my stomach felt better, but there was glistening pile of partially digested stomach contents all over the ground in front of me. I wish I could say that I knew what I was looking at, but it was all so thoroughly masticated that I couldn’t hope pick one bit from another. All I knew was that none of it looked cooked, and I didn’t see anything that could pass for a vegetable anywhere in the nasty mix.

My stomach felt better though.

I picked up my mask, chose a random direction, and began to walk. I must have chosen well, because after only two hours, I came across a road.

I’m not ignorant. I’ve driven in and out of town plenty of times. I know my way around in town and around the outskirts of my hometown. That’s why I knew that I needed to go left once I reached this road if I wanted to get home. How long would it take? Fucked if I know. All that mattered was I was going the right direction, and the rest would fall into place one way or another.

And fall into place it did. Less than an hour of walking later, A random pickup truck pulled over. The driver listened to my story, and told me to hop in the bed of his truck and he’d take me into town. I did it gratefully, and he was as good as his word, better even. He dropped me off outside my apartment building, told me to stay off the drugs, and went on his merry way.

I went inside, took the elevator to my floor, opened my door without needing to use my key, which was also weird since I never, ever, EVER left my apartment without locking it, and immediately rushed to the shower so I could get clean and feel human again.

I was brushing my teeth for the third time when I heard my phone ringing. It was on the floor, pushed up against the wall under the sink. Why? I don’t know. But I found it, pulled it out, and answered the call.

“Where have you been?” Tiffany practically shrieked in my ear. I’ve been calling and texting all night and I haven’t heard a word from you! If you didn’t pick up the phone this time I was going to call the cops to make sure you weren’t dead!”

On the one hand, it felt surreal being yelled at so mundanely after the freaky mystery I woke up to. On the other, what in the ever-living hell was going on?

I let my girlfriend yell for awhile until she was all shouted out. Then I responded. “I don’t know where I was last night,” I told her in a shaky voice. “One minute I was home, the next I was waking up in the middle of nowhere covered in blood.”

This set off another wave of panicked screeching that eventually settled down into sobbing and expressions of gratitude that I was alright. She told me she was coming right over and hung up before I could protest.

I had a very, very bad feeling about her coming over.

\*\*\*\*\*

It literally took all day to get Tiffany settled down and comfortable with the fact that that, in spite of everything, I was alright. I didn’t tell her about how my body had violently purged my stomach of an inhuman amount of raw flesh shortly after waking up. I was already washed up, and my bloody costume was in the wash getting as clean as I could hope for it to be.

It was actually the laundry that got her settled down. She volunteered to take my costume out of the dryer, and was absolutely delighted to see that I had added to it by dying in a bunch of red and brown staining. “It’s actually looks like you ripped something apart and ate it!” she said excitedly. “You’re so good at making Halloween costumes!”

“Yeah . . .” I said slowly before trailing off. “I modified it . . .”

She didn’t give me a chance to finish my words or my thoughts before she jumped me. Perhaps if she hadn’t been so excited and relieved that I was safe and healthy, things would have turned out differently. Perhaps if our intimate life wasn’t so . . . frequent and vigorous, everything would have turned out differently.

As it was, I succumbed to her passion, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms for an afternoon nap.

\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke before Tiffany did, and I went to the living room to examine the mask. I felt scared holding it. It felt wrong to put my hands upon that artifact, as though I was touching a power I could not hope to control or comprehend.

I turned it over, and over, and over again, examining it to the finest detail.

Why did this mask, out of everything I wore last night, not have a single drop of blood on it? Why was the last thing I could remember putting it on and taking a selfie?

That thought triggered something in me, and I took out my phone. I didn’t have it with me in the forest, and I couldn’t remember checking the picture I took or sending it to Tiffany.

I opened the photos and looked at the last picture I took.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a photo of myself mid-metamorphosis. Mayne I thought I’d catch myself becoming something other than, well, me. What I actually saw was me, in my costume, with my phone in my hand.

I looked at the picture again, not really believing that it could be so mundane, and I thought I could see something . . . different in those lifelike glass eyes, I though that maybe, just maybe there was a hint of something in there that was not only me. But no. It couldn’t be. The supernatural isn’t real after all. It’s all hokum. Bunk. Small-minded garbage that enlightened people like me didn’t believe in.

The sun had set. It wasn’t down for long, but it was the second day of the rarest kind of blue moon event, the kind where the full moon happens two days in a row. I looked into the eyes of the mask, this perfect, masterfully crafted mask, lifted it up, and lowered it onto my head.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning, the nineteenth of October, a mere week ago to the most horrifying sight of my life.

I awoke on the floor of my own apartment, but once again, I was covered in blood and filth.

“How?” I screamed in horror, not understanding where the ungodly mess had come from.

My stomach was killing me. I rushed to my bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before my stomach decided to evacuate its contents, then and keep evacuating itself even when there was nothing but water and bile left to push out. It went on, and on, and on, until I wished I would just die rather than endure another moment of such violent illness.

I flushed the toilet whenever I had the presence of mind to do so without checking to see what had come out of me. I had seen what came out the day before, and I didn’t want to see it again. Perhaps that’s why I failed to recognize any of the bits and parts, the solid matter mixed in with the wretched fluids that erupted from my stomach and out of my mouth.

Regardless, I was glued to the toilet until my stomach finally settled down after who-knows how long. Then I stripped my bloody clothing and took a shower so hot I felt like it might burn the skin from my bones, and I was okay with that.

I felt dirty inside and out. It was wrong. Wrong in every way. Down to my soul if I had believed it at the time, I felt wrong, dirty, and thoroughly corrupted.

I was in the shower for an hour, lost in feelings rather than thought. Wondering what had happened and how I managed to wind up covered in blood again in my own apartment. It was only when I finally shut off the water and was halfway through drying off that it hit me.

Tiffany!”

I screamed, and I ran to my bedroom.

I burst into my bedroom, and was greeted by the most horrific mess I could possibly imagine. The entire room was splattered with blood and viscera. Not a surface was spared as at least some red drops or other . . . scraps was on every surface, every knick-knack, every everything in the room

My screams only got louder and more insistent as I scanned the room and found the head of Tifany, my beautiful Tiffany, beloved girlfriend of three years, on a pillow, fully detached from her body, lifeless eyes staring off into the void. I hurled myself to it, reaching desperately, not willing to believe in what I was seeing.

I picked it up and stared into her sightless eyes, and burst into tears. “Tiffany,” I sobbed. “How? Why?”

I looked around and took the horrific scene in. I recognized the various parts of my beloved scattered around the room. Legs and arms tossed about, bones scattered all over, looking like they had been gnawed upon by a great beast. And not one of her internal organs to be seen.

I remembered how upset my stomach was when I woke up, and how distended it appeared before I threw up the contents in a prolonged, and violent fit. How much of her had I simply flushed away, not knowing what I was doing because I refused to just open my eyes as I vomited up my sick?

I dropped Tiffany’s head back onto my bed and scrambled to the living room. I picked up the diary of Archibald Wembly and read it thoroughly. Much of it was a repeat of what I had already read before in the other provenance, until I got to the end. Here is what is read:

*I should have listened to the rules. I should have learned from the mistakes of others. I didn’t, and now I am paying the price for my foolishness. The mask is gone, but I can feel it’s influence on me even as I write these words.  I blacked out again last night, and when I awoke this morning, my family was dead, ripped apart from some foul beast. Every last one of them. My wife Abigail, and the children George, Franklin, Erin, and Caleb. All of them were torn apart. Only I was spared, and I was covered in such an amount of blood and gore that it could only have come from many animals, of a family of people. I ignored the rules. I wore the mask at night. I wore it on the full moon. It amused me to do so, and I did it without once invoking the name of Christ for protection.*

*I was a fool, and my family has paid the price for my pride and lack of faith. The mask is gone, but I can still feel it within me somehow, as though it has become a part of me. I do not know what the future will bring, but I fear it will be more bloodshed, and it will be me in some beastly form, rending apart my fellow man in bestial glee.*

*I only hope that someone stops me before I go too far.*

*God help me and spare the innocent.*

I put the diary down and sat back stunned, then it dawned on me: Where was the wolf mask?

I tore my apartment searching for it, I really did, but I could not find it. Still, I can feel its presence, like it’s lost, but also not. It’s like it’s here with me even though I cannot see it.

Today is only five days until Halloween. The sun has set, and I feel . . . strong, stronger than I have any right to feel. My dead girlfriend remains rotting in my bedroom, and it smells horrible. The neighbors are sure to complain soon.

I don’t understand what’s going on, but I do know this: I never should have bought that mask, and once I bought it, I never should have broken the rules. How was I supposed to know it was a real cursed object? There’s no science that can explain curses, real, magical curses. Magic isn’t real, right?

Who am I kidding. I believe in magic . . . now. But I came to believe too late. Too late to save my beloved Tiffany, and too late to save myself.

I need to flee. I need to get away from here, as soon as possible. I can feel the beast inside of me, and it wants to get out. I need to get as far away from people as possible, to disappear and never be seen again.

But I’m hungry, and there’s a great nightclub not far from here, and the night is young.

Perhaps I’ll stop in for a bite to eat before I begin my journey.
