About four years ago I  started to believe in god after praying for the fear of the lord and god let me experience it. Laidback  in bed feeling like the weight of the universe was crushing down on my soul except it wasn’t just the weight of the universe it was more than that and it was inconceivable how strong this force was and I cried for about an hour and shook as I realized there is a god. 

After this realization things got really weird I tried to go back to living life normally but I couldn’t not then at least.

I woke up late at night hearing a separate being out in the hallway saying in English hold on like he was talking to someone else and then the door slammed  open and this being screaming in a language that penetrated every corner of the room as if it’s voice filled the room like the air in it and I awoke and didn’t sleep nor eat nor drink I lost the ability to do any of these things because I felt a calling to action of what I was unsure but next thing I know for the next few days I feel compelled to write down commands that god is telling me and I write them down as if a spirit is controlling my mind and body and then I read the words afterward when I become lucid of what was happening I read the words on the loose pages and  to summarize this happened on and off for four days the words I received were something like this

(Ps I don’t remember everything the pages said because they were taken from someone not sure who but I’ll try my best to remember) 



The end is coming, tell everyone to repent and that god is coming for his people and tell them to stop living like god is something that exists in just a book. 
Go to the church and tell them to do the will of god and listen to what the spirit is saying. Tell them that the Bible is not merely words on a page it is living it is true. The rapture is coming!!

Basically I kept getting the same message for most of this time and other tidbits of knowledge about how demons may scare and terrorize people but God  terrorizes them more.

———————————————————/———
Overall nothing too life changing right ? I mean for me it didn’t seem like it, till I realized it takes a different kind of person to live up to God’s standard.

Shortly after the first messages I started getting after understanding what all of it mean I could hear God speak audibly or rather I just understood completely what he was saying 


The message was this, 

“Will you surrender yourself completely to me ?”

He wanted to use me to warn people but I was too afraid to do it then 


I freaked out because I realized all the people in the Old Testament and New Testament had very very difficult lives and some were even murdered and tortured for doing gods will

I flaked and ultimately without needing to speak I felt gods presence recede from me the next thing I know I  remembered how god chastises those who he loves for their disobedience. For about five minutes god allowed me to feel a fraction of his judgement.

The floor felt like hot coals on a bed of fire and the air felt like a blazing flame and the air smelled of a fire a pure smell of wrath in and of itself a warning to not disobey god because he does as he pleases.

The next day the same as before I felt overcome and started writing on the paper with my pen and the message wrote as this 


“ I am the God who created the great and small fishes of the sea and the animals of the earth and all of the earth, who are you to disobey me?”

The next week I went to a family members house and sat outside and the neighbor came out and said we’re having a get together why don’t you come over? Ok I said I will.


The next thing I know my grandmother had apparently been telling them that I was deppresed and not eating so they gave me some food and drink.

I ate and then the old lady next store said I have something for you and she left and went to the other room and came back with a pen and paper and she handed it to me and in disbelief I took the pen and paper thinking

“What the hell”? “ this feels familiar “

Next thing I know she sits down beside me and I just start writing what comes to mind and she and her sister ask what I wrote down and I told them and sorry I don’t remember what I wrote but they told me I was a prophet and that they could feel the spirit of god when I spoke. 

This scared me because it seemed all too real 

All in all I don’t believe I’m anything special, not at all, not at all but I feel such despair and regret that I since then have not obeyed god.

My life has been exceedingly difficult since then I’ve lost family because of drama, I’ve lost family due to death and I’ve become lonely and an outcast even feeling like I’m sitting down while everyone is racing by 

Even still God has been good to me and brought me through these last few years and told me he would forgive my sin and stay with me and fight for me and save me but I feel that we are on the brink of the end, the calm before the storm maybe I don’t know all I know is the world  has grown cold and loves to steal and kill. 


If you have read the Bible you’ll know that the ancient Hebrew’s worshipped false gods and sacrificed children to them/ followed after their passions. God always tore down their cities and wiped out their people but now it’s not just some people who do these things no it’s the whole world 


People have grown cold and evil. Only loving sex and money and caring for physical wealth.


We praise the Rich and famous but we shame the poor and the hungry and the weak….


Our judgement may have not come yet but it’s coming and we can’t escape it unless we believe that Jesus Christ is lord and be kind and love one another. 

Jesus Christ is not just a story or a myth..


We live in a fallen world full of deception 

That is why when we scream and curse we say Jesus or gods name in vain! 


Your soul knows this truth your mind just has to acknowledge it.

Many have been warned and shown the truth but millions more have scoffed and said no I will not believe.


The demons laugh when we say there is no god  and the rich and powerful know there is a supernatural world that’s why they build everything around the devils likeness. 

Pray and seek god you all.
