April 3rd I had my first ever spiritual experience.  Beforehand I had taken about 3 puffs on a THC vape.  I recently got my dispensary card about a year ago.  I usually enjoy the tincture, but the latest one I purchased was cheaper and a different brand and the dropper is plastic and the whole thing has a bad taste because of it.  So I had been sticking to a vape I purchased a little less then a year ago in Atlantic City NJ.  I had recently found it again under my night stand and it was still working.  Maybe not the best choice to use it, but I didn’t care.  Three puffs gives a good effect and usually lasts about an hour.  The tinctures I like usually from 10-50mg. I’ve gone higher and I’m a daily user nights and weekends mainly.  Although, this was on a lunch break because my back was bothering me lately.  

When I got high this time my mind was wandering.  I should mention, I had been watching a lot about the upcoming eclipse, and I watch a lot of conspiracy videos.  I’ve always been into UFO’s, Unsolved Mysteries, and the paranormal in general. 

This time my mind wandered to the elites and their occult practices.  I was thinking about how they have to reveal their intentions for whatever spell they are casting to those they are casting it on to negate any ill effects of the spell.  I wondered if I could make a very upfront video that completely reveals its intentions beforehand, in the title, the description, and me talking before playing the spell.  I thought there would still be plenty of people who watch it just to prove how stupid I am or just to leave a mean comment or whatever other motivations they might have.  

My mind jumped to an offhand joke I had made about my retirement plan being to join a cult.  And wondered what if I wanted to start my own cult.  I thought I’d probably be a better cult leader than the ones we all hear about.  Then quickly realized I’m not really a great leader and wouldn’t want to be one.  But that didn’t matter what about this spell to start a cult?

Then I saw it in my head I read the words in my head.  It was a spell of devotion that would activate if I asked if the person who’d seen the video would devote themselves to me and they said yes.  At that point they’d be a devoted follower and I could use them to help me achieve whatever plans.  Which as bad as this sounds I only had positive goals in mind nothing sinister as what you could imagine with something like this.  

I started to think this spell idea had something to it, and if I took action I might look a little crazy.  If my family, friends, co-workers found me doing this what would they think.  Then I was thinking of disguises and aliases.  When the name appeared in my head  and it was Vishnu.  

I suddenly realized, this isn’t normal words don’t normally appear in my head to read like the spell and the name.  That’s just not how I normally think.  I decided this could be a demon.  Full disclosure the way I live is probably more conducive to demons then deity’s.  Nothing bad just very cluttered disorderly existence.  

I decide the spell and the name was a demon trying to get me to raise its power and gain a following.  

I’m not going to go too deep into it, but I tell whatever this is that this is my house, my body, my property and it is not welcome here.  I feel an anger or rage rise inside of me.  I tell whatever it is, “don’t make me use your name”.  I’m not a deeply religious person, and never really went to any church regularly.  But I say internally something about how it’s not welcome and in the name of Jesus I want it out of me, my house, my property, and away from any part of my family.  It felt pretty intense at some point I even growled I think.  Which saying now makes me feel crazy.  But then I felt something inside of me like a light feeling.  Mixed with the normal body high of the vape.  Then I visualize this light cleaning out my entire body, house, property, and surrounding area.  And I felt much better.

One Hell of a lunch break right. So I sat with what happened for the rest of the day and didn’t tell anyone.  It’s too fucked up to talk about.  

The next day it was still bugging me a little, so I decided to look up Vishnu on google.  Found out that was the name of the Hindu god of creation.  The wiki page made him sound like a good deity.  The big takeaways I will copy and paste from the wiki.  

Whenever the world is threatened with evil, chaos, and destructive forces, Vishnu descends in the form of an avatar (incarnation) to restore the cosmic order, and protect dharma. The Dashavatara are the ten primary avatars of Vishnu. Out of these ten, Rama and Krishna are the most important.

The concept of the avatar (or incarnation) within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trimurti. The avatars of Vishnu descend to empower the good and to destroy evil, thereby restoring Dharma and relieving the burden of the Earth. An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:
Whenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness increases I send myself forth.For the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil,and for the establishment of righteousness,I come into being age after age.
— Bhagavad Gita 4.7–8

So I look at Rama and Krishna and it seems like those incarnations already have a story associated with them from way back, so I wonder about the tenth incarnation.  Kalki which has a story that seems to fit better with the world now.  

Kalki is described in the Puranas as the avatar who rejuvenates existence by ending the darkest and destructive period to remove adharma (unrighteousness) and ushering in the Satya Yuga, while riding a white horse with a fiery sword. The description and details of Kalki are different among various Puranas. Kalki is also found in Buddhist texts, for example the Kalachakra-Tantra of Tibetan Buddhism.

So now my head is spinning a bit was this a demon trying to trick me, or was it really Vishnu,  I have to know.  Note this is April 4th the day after the experience.  I am sober and I say out loud something like, “Vishnu, if it was really you communicating with me yesterday, and not some demon trying to trick me please give me an undeniable sign in the following week, other than the eclipse, and I understand you are a god of creation and with that anything is possible, so please make it a positive sign, and at a bare minimum please don’t hurt anyone in giving the sign.” 

I tried to cover my bases just in case.  I didn’t want any disaster to befell my family or anyone for that matter.  It’s my first spiritual experience.  I’m kinda winging it based off everything I’ve learned throughout my life.  

Oh I left out that the vape pen fell out of my hoodie and into the toilet when I was peeing soon after all of this either on the third or the fourth not sure when but I threw it away after that.  

Well April 5th was going pretty normal until my daughter came home from school, and asked did you hear about the earthquake.  I said what earthquake.  She said there was a small earthquake nearby some people felt it around here.  I said I didn’t feel it she agreed she didn’t either.  But now I’m internally struggling with this information.  

My daughter says to me she’s uncomfortable with everything she’s been seeing about the eclipse, the Euphrates river drying up, cicadas, and just all the biblical signs lately.  Those were her words “Biblical signs”.  Again not a church going family.  

So now it’s too much for me too and in a questionable parental decision I tell her and my son what I experienced.  And now she comes home and tells me there was an earthquake in NJ.  I look up the earthquake and am met with:
No injuries or major damage after morning quake in New Jersey.  

My kids tell me I’m freaking them out.  I say I know I’m sorry.  This is all a little freaky.  

I still don’t know what to think.  

Maybe I should mention today April 6 the glass in my screen door was broke by the wind slamming it into our mailbox.  The door has been broken a while (won’t shut) probably over a year but it waited until now to break.
