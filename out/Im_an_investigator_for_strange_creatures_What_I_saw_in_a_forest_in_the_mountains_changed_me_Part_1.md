My name is Reed Delaney. I'm a cryptid investigator… in training. Liv is my mentor. She taught me almost everything I know about cryptids. She's been in the game for a long time. You won't get far as a cryptid investigator and especially not as a cryptid hunter without some help. All kinds of strange phenomena disturb the natural flow of everyday life.  It’s our job to keep those disturbances in check.

A vampire here or there can be fought off or chased away. Then there are witches. No, not female wizards. No, not the kinds that fly around on broomsticks with green skin, long noses and warts. And while yes, some form of those may or may not have existed at some point, they’re not the kind I'm talking about. 

We in the cryptid community call them many names. Witches, corruptions, demons, the forsaken, the cursed ones, and the list goes on. They're corrupted by some unknown force or entity. They can be people, animals, plants, monsters, and even objects. For an unknown reason, something turns them into heinous creatures who seek nothing but to create carnage and do twisted things for their own pleasure and amusement. You can think of it as a curse. That’s kinda how they get the name “the cursed ones. And then there are other magical entities that we call witches but they're nothing like the forsaken ones. 

They’re otherworldly entities you're probably better off staying far away from. They’re responsible for many legends told around the world. It's not like we all got around a round table and discussed what official names to call them. Most legends were already called by a million different names before any of us were born. People tend to call things whatever makes the most sense to them. Hell, the guy who's part man and part goat was brilliantly named “Goatman”. But I’m not sure he's even real.

The large majority of myths are simply that; myth. And don't worry: you won't run into these otherworldly witches even if you have the worst of luck so you're safe to forget they exist. Corrupt witches  (“the cursed ones”) are also quite rare. An ordinary person would never encounter one. An unlucky person would encounter one. An investigator would encounter several depending on how long you’re around. And that may hold true for normal investigators as well. And if you’re brave enough and a little crazy, you could be dealing with a forsaken once a month. 

Now I'm a brave guy but even I would never fight one of these things if it wasn’t absolutely necessary.  There's a reason why I'm a cryptid investigator and not a cryptid hunter; though, the terms are used interchangeably; the main reason being, I enjoy being alive. The most I've done is assist in exterminations run by trained hunters and specialists. Though, I'm currently working as an analyst to determine why witches exist and what causes people to become one.  Again, I…don't wanna die, so I'm taking baby steps and leaving most of the fighting to my colleagues. Someone has to do it and that means getting close to witches. 

There aren't too many cryptid investigators so we've got our hands full. My mentor liv recommended that I take on the role. She insisted that I'm just the right guy for the job. Now I like solving a good mystery but this is quite the ambitious task. Nonetheless, I took on the role without too much thought. If it means we can avoid the deaths of all those who fall at the hands of creatures that don't belong in our world committing acts of senseless violence, I'll do whatever it takes. But enough about all that. Let's get to the gist.

The job took me to a mountainside park. The name and location will remain undisclosed. The report I received said that a number of people went missing in the nearby area. Witnesses claimed to see large creatures moving through the forest. Some of the property owners confirmed this. 

I arrived by cab one morning and tipped the driver after exiting the vehicle. The cool breeze carried the smell of the forest air to my nostrils. I felt the soil compress beneath my feet. A nearby bird sang a peaceful tune while the collective swaying of the leaves formed the chorus. The thick fog completely cloaked anything farther than about twelve meters. Not the best conditions for hunting a monster. 

The hill was a popular site for hiking, camping, picnicking and it even had a few lodges. There were few people still on the park grounds. The incidents didn't occur on the property but somewhere nearby. As I stated earlier, many came to camp and hike. They'd often start their trail on the property to use the restrooms, grab a meal, or shop. Those who hiked typically went far from the property. From there I would assume they ran into these beasts we were after. That would explain why the people who went missing in these woods typically started their journey from the park despite all the reports coming from farther out. The thought allowed me to ease up a bit. I probably wouldn't have a run-in with one of these things unless I went looking for them. Thankfully I'd have company when that time rolled around. 

Speaking of company: when I entered the first lodge by the main entrance, as instructed before departure, there they were; chatting and eating. I only knew one of them by name: Adrian Wood. Adrian was a cryptid researcher in the UK. Unlike us, when he started, he was just like any other cryptid enthusiast and conspiracy theorist. I don't know what happened to lead him to his breakthroughs but he quickly grew accustomed to the creature underworld. He led a division full of powerful hunters before they even established a connection with the…I guess you would say “official” underworld. Over time, they'd built a good name for themselves and had fully integrated into the creature community. That was the start of his hay day.

Adrian became a hunter and with his alleys, he began purging the world of its beasts one by one. From what I heard from liv, it was the golden age of monster hunting. But it came to an abrupt end when one day a witch-hunt went less than smoothly and claimed the lives of thirteen. Many of whom were just as famous as Adrian if not more. Cara strong, Kareem haul, snake eyes, the weatherman, and Damian Lacy to name a few.

Adrian saw me and waved me over. He was an older guy: maybe in his early forties and tall with blond hair and brown eyes. He wore an inviting smile as he waved me over. The other three turned their attention to me. “You must be Reed. I've heard a lot about you.

Come join us,” he said. “Yeah, likewise,” I said as I approached the table. The Amber wood-tiled floor of the lodge groaned beneath my feet. I removed the satchel’s strap from around my neck and put it on the side of the table away from everyone else. Adrian reached out his hand for me to shake. I obliged. 

“Pleasure to meet you,” he said. “The pleasure’s mine. I've heard so much about you. You're quite the legend where I'm from,” I responded. He laughed. 

“Oh, I don't know about that. I’m just a… veteran explorer. These are my mentees, Kaitlyn and Zeke,” Adrian gestured to the two people sitting beside him. They looked to be around my age; maybe a little older. For the record, I was twenty at the time. Zeke reached out his arm for me to shake. He was an average-height, Latin American guy with thick curly black hair and a trimmed mustache. “Yo, nice to meetcha,”  he said in a sort of silly way. “I’m Ezequiel but call me zeke. Or call me Mr. Z. Well don't call me Mr. Z yet. 

I'll need to become a legend like Adrian first, but when I do, refer to me as Mr. Z when you're telling stories about me. If not, just call me Zeke.” He was so casual that it caught me off guard. For a guy about to fight monsters, he didn't seem all that worried. I guess my puzzled expression was misinterpreted because he followed up by saying “I'm just playin. If I become a legend, you know… that's cool but if I don't, it is what it is. I have bigger priorities. I wouldn't be here risking my life for a reason like that.”

His last sentence reminded me of one important thing for any cryptid hunter to remember. Your life is always on the line. There's never a guarantee that you or the people with you will make it out alive.” The realization lowered my spirits. Especially since Zeke was already leaving an impression on me, I didn't want to see him or any of the others suffer an unfortunate fate. It's often the ones that don't take things too seriously that wind up not making it far. However, I know better than to underestimate people. With a little more prying I could learn more about the guy and what drove him to become a hunter. 

Adrian shook his head and let out a sigh. His expression was the kind you'd see a teacher make when a student asks a question about something that was just answered. “And you're Kaitlyn?” I asked, turning to face her.  “She stared me in the eyes for a moment before smiling. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. “Have we met,” she asked? “Not any time I can remember,” I answered. “Strange. It feels like I already know you quite well,” she said peculiarly. I didn't know how to respond to that. Adrian laughed.

“Quite the eccentrics we have here,” I said. “Haha, I hope we didn’t make a bad first impression but best to put your true character on full display, I always say,” Adrian commented. “Can’t argue with that sentiment,” I responded. I turned to the other man. A tall dark skinned guy who looked to be in his early thirties or even mid-twenties. His facial expression told me that he was worried or concerned about something. 

“You can call me J,” he said before I even got a word out. “Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Well, first of all, I'm the one who called you guys out here. The police wouldn't help: figures, I wouldn't wanna deal with monsters either. But I'm desperate. I don't know what your little group here can do if I'm just bein real. Y’don’t even have guns, but uh…I'm not the professional so I'll let y'all do y’thing and help you out however I can. I keep a few on the grounds just in case. If ya need one let me know. I don't really care if you have a license or not, just do what you gotta do so more people don't go missin,” he said.

“It may not be the best idea to have guns during this sort of thing. But we appreciate the offer. We'll keep it in mind,” said Adrian. Now that everyone's here we should go over the objective though,” Adrian said. I had only just arrived after a long drive and would've loved to get settled in first but I didn't voice my concerns. I'd have time to rest later. 

We'd be staying for several days if necessary, though the goal was to be done in less than a week or two at max. This also served as a great opportunity to potentially discover a new type of cryptid. We couldn't hypothesize what it was based on witness descriptions. “Mr. Reed, I'll let you take it from here,” Adrian said. Zeke followed by commenting: “Hit it, Reed!” I quickly snapped out of my thoughts and stammered “Huh? Oh yeah, uhh…well first off we need to gather all the necessary information to make sure we're all caught up err on the same page. J, is that jay as in J-A-Y or-” “first initial,” he said, cutting me off. 

“Right! Can you tell us again everything you know about what's going on,” I asked? “Yeah, of course. I've owned this place for almost a decade now. We got a bunch of spiders but I've never seen any monsters. Until a few weeks ago,” J said. He looked uncomfortable. There was a brief pause.

“When folks started goin missing near here I decided to do something about it myself. Can't have any harm comin to innocent folks on my watch,” he said. I'd begun to notice a change in the atmosphere. “I searched all through these woods and found nothin but spiders, spiders, and more spiders. The farther out I went the more spiders there were. Cellars, wolfs, Hobos, funnel spiders, the works. They started getting bigger and stranger. I only realized later that I didn't run inta any other critters for a long time while I was out there. Then the trees started to shift left and right and look all mangled. My first thought was that maybe some natural gasses were affecting the trees and driving away the animals. But I ain't never heard of anything that can morph the trees in that way.”

J was breathing heavily at that point. “But then I remembered, I wasn't there to investigate some trees or some spiders. I was investigating disappearances. If there was some kinda gas making people disappear then I was probably breathing it in. If it was a chemical affecting people that would explain why they all claimed to see weird creatures. But they wouldn't all hallucinate the same thing right? That's when I saw something from the corner of my eye. A kitten stickin its head out of a bush. I don't know how it got there but I couldn't let it stay in the woods alone. I got down nice and slow, not tryna scare it, and used my best calm voice to try to coax it out but… what came out wasn't no ordinary kitten. It had eight legs. But its legs looked different. Like… they were intended to be bug legs. I swear I can't make this shit up.” 

J seemed frustrated now. I wasn’t quite sure if I should have found that an odd emotional response to the situation. There was more though. His voice was trembling now. J continues, “I'm still not sure if what happened next was my imagination or not b-but I really hope it is.” J was now taking many pauses in between words and alternating between speaking fast and speaking slow. 

“A…snap of a branch got my attention. In the distance, I saw… I saw a deer. I-it was starin at me with its eight eyes and not even budgin. Then I noticed another one in the distance. It just stood there… starin with its beady little eyes. They were normal, but seven legs instead of eight. Someone musta shot the thing. I was beginning to back up slowly when I saw somethin… massive! As big as a bear, weaving through the trees way in the distance. I've never felt more fear in my life. I ran the hell out of there as fast as I could but it was fast. It started catching up. Its Eight or… nine- six legs gave it more speed than a normal deer but it still struggled to use them and that’s the only reason why it didn’t already catch me. It was stumblin every now and again but it was catchin up nonetheless. I heard the pitter-patter of its hooves gaining closer and closer at an unGODLY rate! It sounded like it tripped on somethin but I wasn't gonna look back. I only heard that it wasn’t as close anymore but it made up for the distance in no time! It was on my tail again in seconds! I felt it’s hot breath on my neck and knew it was over for me! But it was gone. It just vanished. The cops said they couldn't find anything though. But one of them pulled me aside and gave me a number. One of your agencies. And here we are now,” J concluded. 

I realized I was holding my breath only after he finished reciting what happened. His story was hard to believe but that’s exactly why we were listening. A quick gaze around the table told me that the others shared my suspicion. “Welp, I regret coming,” said Zeke, referring to the terrifying situation we were getting involved in. “So the animals took on the genetic traits of spiders,” Kaitlyn asked. “Well yeah,” J said. A brief silence fell over the room. Adrian didn’t say anything. 

I assumed he wanted his underlings to take the lead here. I, however, still had my role to play. J gazed at us with desperation in his eyes. “Can you show us on a map where you were when this happened?,” I asked. “I assume you know the woods in and out since you've been here for so long.” “Of course, he said. 

He walked over to a nearby room, unlocked the door, and entered. He came out a moment later with a large folded-up map in his hands. He brought it to the table and unfolded it. He then took out a marker and labeled parts of the map. “Over here, is where the trees started to look weird, and here is where I saw the creatures. I think it waaaaas… here! Where I was when they disappeared on me,” he said. 

He drew three circles on the map in black marker. Adrian sighed. “I forgot we're on a mountainside. We'll have to do some hiking,” he said. “Ah don't worry, it ain't steep, uhh… remind me what your name was English boy?” “It's Adrian,” he said, smirking. “Adrian wood.” 

Kaitlyn rolled her eyes at his obvious attempt to sound like a secret agent from a 90s movie. “Oh c’mon you kids think everything I do is uncool; give me a break,” Adrian responded. They continued to playfully bicker, going completely off-topic. J seemed to relax. “Now I wasn't sure if I should trust y'all with this information at first but y'all seem comfortable enough with this kinda thing like you see it every day so I think you're the real deal,” J said. 

J walked over to the main door of the lodge. “Follow me,” he said as he flashed a curious look. The hunters raised their guard. Besides Adrian who had begun typing something on his phone. I made a mental note that Kaitlyn took pursuit of J first. 

It wasn't exactly a part of my job (not for my current employers) but it's important to understand what would lead someone to do what we do. Might come in handy in the future. For people like me who don't fear the unknown as much as others, it's a bit easier. People like Adrian seek to uncover untold truths and answer humanity's burning questions. 

I asked Adrian to send me the notes he took on J’s report. They were sent shortly after our walk behind him. J led us to an old dilapidated shed. He took out a stone skeleton key and unlocked the iron-chained door. It fell to the ground with a clank. He then walked inside. 

Kaitlyn didn't hesitate to enter and Zeke followed behind shortly after. And I thought I was fearless. Even I was hesitant to enter the dark shed behind a stranger. I suppose it was more of a survival instinct though. J flicked on a light switch. In the middle of the shed sat a cage with a dusty, ragged cushion that looked like it had been used as a scratching dummy. Atop the cushion sat a kitten. The very kitten J had mentioned earlier. This was enough evidence to confirm supernatural activity was taking place. 

We all stood there in shocked silence watching the two-headed, eight-legged feline as it sat there watching us with its eight beady little eyes. It let out a pain-filled meowing sound after having a good look at us. There was no indication that it was desperate to escape; maybe a little tired of being in the cage. Most cats don’t like being confined, but for a cat to be confined and surrounded by complete strangers in unknown territory and not show any sign of distress is peculiar. “Bloody hell! They really did a number on the poor guy,” Adrian said in a pronounced way. “Alright then, thi-this gives us enough evidence to proceed,'' I choked out. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I'm gonna get the hell out of here. Looking at it gives me the creeps”, i added. “And I’m gonna bleach my eyes,” said Zeke.

Later we went scouting the site where J claimed to see the creatures. Kaitlyn and I would be in the forest while Adrian and Zeke watched from a monitor. Once we made sure the cameras strapped to our foreheads were sending a live feed to the others, we got ready to go. The fog was incredibly thick. Perfect weather to be snuck up on. Kaitlyn looked as if she had forgotten where she was. I decided it'd be best to go before my nerves settled in. We walked along the dirt trail under the enormous trees that just seemed to keep growing and growing.

J had said, once we got far enough they'd really start to block out the sunlight. Whatever sunlight escaped through the clouds and the fog. If not for the circumstances, it would be a very surreal experience. I still enjoyed the nature walk anyhow. I guess I'm just one of the weirdos.

I was sure Kaitlyn had glanced at me a few times but she played it off well. “Nice morning huh?,” she said, facing me. “Yeah… despite the circumstances, you have to admit it's beautiful out here,” I replied. Kaitlyn laughed. “Despite the circumstances, you don't seem so scared. You used to this kinda thing?,” she asked. 

“I've seen some weird shit. This is super weird, don't get me wrong, but I guess, yeah, I'm used to it. Weird things never really bothered me,” i responded.

“Weird like this? How'd you get used to all this so quickly?”

“Where I'm from, weird things are a lot more common.”

“Wait a second… Are you from that monster town?”

“Ding ding ding! Yup! Briar, home of the cryptids. 

I don't know why but something draws them in in waves. It's not so bad though. If you know how things go around there and mind your own business nothing bad’ll happen.

We have a saying that goes “if you don't go looking for trouble, you won't find it; or some variation of that.” 

“Well you must've gone looking for trouble if you saw enough to wind up with a job like this,” she said with a grin. It was the most I've seen her interested in anything all morning.”

“Tell you what: I'll tell you my story if you tell me yours,” I said, hoping to learn more about her. She fell silent and her expression ceased. “Orrr… we don't have to,” I said awkwardly, trying to salvage the conversation. “Shh!” she said, gesturing toward something in the distance. I looked in the direction she was pointing in, in anticipation but I couldn't sense anything.

“Adrian, Zeke, are you getting this,” she said. I had almost forgotten they were listening and watching our camera feeds. “No technical difficulties on our end,” Adrian responded. The sound of Adrian's voice coming from the earpiece startled me and I stepped back onto a twig, causing it to snap. The sound caused something to stand up and gaze at us from the direction Kaitlyn had said it was in; a dirty-blonde woman. Something was off about her though. We couldn't see her full body but she stood quite tall at well over eight feet. Her body seemed almost disproportionate to her height. Her eyes were dead.

What was even more apparent were the large, hairy, spider-like pincers on her face. I'd never seen anything like it. They say the worst fear comes from things that appear to be human but aren’t quite or not entirely. This was no exception. My heart was pounding and I broke into a cold sweat.

A powerful, primal fear made itself known and did not want to be ignored. Then the unexpected happened. Kaitlyn stepped forward. I snapped my head toward her, shocked at the implication of what she might've been about to do. Before I realized it I was slowly backing away. I tried my best to creep back to my senses as Kaitlyn took another step forward causing the woman or… thing to back up. The thing made a bizarre sound I can't really describe well but it was something like a deep gurgle echoing through a cave.

I reached inside my coat pocket and took out three large pens. After quickly examining them, I raised the silver pen up to my mouth with my left hand and held two identical black pens in my right hand. I took a moment to calm my nerves as I steadied my hand. After taking a deep breath in, I released it and a dart flew out with a very distinct whizzing sound which made Kaitlyn turn her attention toward me for a second before turning back to the spider. The spider woman didn't have time to react. It hit her right in the vein of her neck. 

I'm no combatant but weapons always come in handy. Tranquilizers make it easy to catch a target without having to sweat and you could always use them in self-defense. Beats dying by a long shot!  My other two pens are connective knives. The spider woman struggled to let out a cry of agony. She charged forward; revealing massive spider legs over twice the size of her upper body along with the body of a spider. She looked like a cellar spider. Otherwise known as the daddy long-legs. Her legs seemed to be moving on their own. The spider-like body charged forward, dragging the human upper body with it.

From a closer range, I could see that the human part of it had bold hazel-brown eyes. It charged at me but Kaitlyn used the opportunity to drive her knife through two of its pencil-thin front legs, causing it to fall to the ground. The action was so swift that I didn't even realize the blade went all the way through. She then began to cut off the other two legs on the spider's left side. It let out another, more blood-curdling scream as it writhed in anguish. Kaitlyn looked at the creature with disgust; although I sensed a hint of pity. “The blood smells awful,” Kaitlyn said. 

“STAY CAUTIOUS OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS,” Adrian said; the earpiece making it sound much louder as I didn't expect it. “Jesus! You almost gave me a heart attack, I exclaimed, peering around to make sure nothing else was around. We were in the clear. All that was left was to figure out what to do with the spider woman. I looked at the poor soul for a bit longer than i should’ve.

“You know, you wear your thoughts on your face,” she said as she approached the woman, still gripping her blade. “I can’t help it, that’s a human being. Or at least used to be one,” I said in defense.” “Good to know you still consider that a human,” she responded. All of a sudden the creature shot up with its remaining four legs and while off-balance, cartoonishly bolted away at a speed that shouldn’t have been possible given that it was missing half of its limbs that were already extremely thin. And just like that, it was gone. Not a very climactic encounter but one to be noted. It went further into the forest and we didn’t bother chasing after it. 

“Well that was unexpected,” Kaitlyn replied. “I took a deep breath, not realizing that I had been withholding my breath the whole time. “What was that weapon you used,” asked Adrian. “Yeah, I'm also curious,” said Kaitlyn. “I call them Unity pens. A friend of mine made em. Some are tranquilizers, some are knives, but if anyone checks inside my satchel they'll only see ordinary pens.” “That's pretty neat! Think you could get me one that shoots fireworks,” Zeke asked? “I could try,” I responded.

I had some time to gather my thoughts as we walked. I kept thinking about J’s story. For starters, why did he take the kitten? He claimed he wanted proof which I suppose makes sense but to even consider touching such a freakish thing is odd. And why did the cage look old and used? It reeked of a horrible smell like it had been previously used that the cat didn't seem to be bothered by. I'm no animal expert but if you put an animal in an enclosed area that smells of another creature it shouldn't be so relaxed. Perhaps the kitten had time to accept the situation. 

Everything about this situation that normally wouldn't make sense just seemed to fit perfectly together. It was as if the cat had always been there. That would explain a few things. Then there was Kaitlyn. Her lackadaisical behavior toward everything made her a spectacle. She didn't seem to think her life was on the line here. Though, judging by how she handled her dagger, I'd concur. Or perhaps she really didn’t have a care in the world. 

There are many reasons one would choose to become a cryptid hunter and one of them is the most horrifying way to throw your life away. After all, this isn't exactly the kinda job someone with everything to lose would take. I had no idea what she'd been through. However, I couldn't help but want to rule out that possibility. “Reed.” Nothing about her demeanor- “Reed.” -seemed to indicate that anything was- “Reed, Kaitlyn said, snapping me out of my thoughts. “Huh? Oh sorry; I have a bad habit of getting lost in my thoughts. She looked curious but satisfied with my answer. 

We were still walking; the fog just as thick as when I arrived. Kaitlyn cleared her throat. “I think we're at the place J marked on his map. I can sm-  I can tell that there are more monsters nearby. But I don't see the trees he mentioned,” said Kaitlyn. It sounded like Kaitlyn was going to say something else but caught herself. I made a quick mental note of it, wondering if she could’ve possibly been hiding something important. Though, there was a good chance it was nothing and I was just overthinking.

We were at our destination. I looked around and saw that the trees were nothing like J had described. They were giant but ordinary trees. I put aside my doubts and opted to trust my new colleague. “You're right. Maybe we're at the wrong place or… my theory was correct,” I said. “What's your theory,” Kaitlyn asked? I looked to Kaitlyn; her eyes filled with intrigue. There's a magic veil here, which J manages to slip through.“

Her intrigued expression ceased and was replaced by surprise. She stood still for a moment before addressing her team: “Adrian, Zeke, we're on our way.” She began walking at a fast pace toward the direction we came from. I followed behind her. If he lied it could be because either he created these monsters or he's working with whoever did,” I choked out. “That would mean he lured us out here to ambush us. So why hasn't he,” Kaitlyn said. “I don't know but be on your guard,” I said. 

“We're being watched, said Kaitlyn unexpectedly. I shuddered at the thought of being confronted by another one of these bizarre entities. Kaitlyn was as stoic as usual, of course. She radiated an energy that said she wasn't to be trifled with. I felt safer around her.

Adrian and Zeke greeted us at the lodge. Now we had a few words for J. Thankfully we had his cell number. J had provided us with a private lodge. It had a cafeteria, lounge, staff room and ten guest rooms. Quite a big place for only the four of us. We heard a few knocks on the main entrance door every so often and had to pretend the place was empty. 

We all gathered in the lounge and called J. The red wool lounge chairs looked a little too fancy to be in a place like this. Adrian took out his cell phone and dialed J’s number. J picked up. “Hey! Adrian, was it? How's the job goin?,” J said. “Things didn't go according to plan. We arrived at the location you marked on your map but we couldn't find the warped trees. We're heading back out in a bit but we just wanted to be sure you sent us to the right place,” Adrian said. 

“Oh, I'm pretty sure. When you get to them tall ass Douglas trees it should be along the path. I know I didn't make no mistake. Might’ve been gasses afterall; messin with my mind. But I swear it was right along the path. You can't miss me,” said J, apologetically. Well we did happen to find several monsters in the area so we must've been going the right way. Perhaps some other forces are at play here. 

We'll get to the core of this. But first, is there anything you're not telling us,” Adrian said. J didn't respond. Kaitlyn piped up: “this only works if we can trust each other.” J now responded: “then let me ask y'all somethin. How did y'all get in this business anyway? Monster huntin.” There was a brief silence as we exchanged looks. 

We all instinctively looked to Adrian, our senior, for how to proceed. He gave a sort of daring look; as if to say be careful how you proceed; sticking to his decision to let the juniors take the lead. Though I figured my next action would work out for all of us. “I guess you can call it chance. I was just at the right place at the right time. I was at a low point in my life and someone came along to pull me from my despair and put me on the right path. She gave me a chance to make a living by helping people in ways others can't. And if you don’t mind being traumatized, the benefits are amazing!” I said. The others looked at me with a mix of emotions; most notably surprise. Another silence fell over us, only to be broken by some background noise on J’s end of the call.

“Some people just look really hard until they find something that wants to tear their head off,” said Zeke. My confusion was short-lived as Adrian bellowed a mighty laugh. He was soon joined by J and then Kaitlyn. “I'll be back tonight at seven. We can talk then. Just keep doin what you're doin. I gotta run,” said J. And with that he hung up.

Adrian sighed. “Well, he's an awfully dodgy character isn’t he?,” he said rhetorically. “For sure,” chimed Zeke. “Got any ideas Mr detective?” Zeke asked. If he was able to pass through a veil, we just need to get in the same way he did. That or we find another way in which will be difficult unless one of you happens to be some kinda mage,” I said.

“So what do we do,” Zeke asked. I thought for a moment. “Let's just kill all the bastards on the outside,” Kaitlyn pitched in. My eyes lit up. Adrian smirked, revealing that he had the same revelation I had. “We can enter the same way they do,” I exclaimed. “Of course! Why didn't I think of that earlier,” said Zeke.

“Right then! If an accursed is behind this we’ll need to be more prepared! And if there’s a veil it means our witch is an *actual* witch,” stated Adrian. “Is that possible?” Kaitlyn asked what was on my mind. “It’s happened before,” answered Zeke. “Can any cryptid become a forsaken?” she asked eagerly. “I’d guess every single one that isn’t some void voodoo thingee could probably become one,” Zeke said.

“Well this actually works out for us. We can actually get information out of them,” I said. “Pssh, It works out for you because you’re not the one whose life is on the line,” she said Jokingly. She was right. I didn’t intend to fight, although I didn’t intend to watch from the sidelines either. I have a mission to see the end of the forsaken era and I'll be damned if I don't see this all the way through. But deep down I knew I could do more. “Hey, we all have our roles,” Zeke said, coming to my defense. “Sure, he doesn’t have a godlike physique me-” he continued before Kaitlyn interrupted. “I’m kidding Zeke!” she said defensively. 

Adrian checked his watch and proclaimed, “it’s one pm now. “We'll be out again in…four hours just to scout.  In the meantime get some food and have some fun, yeah? I've got some calls to make” Adrian said and he went to the single room on the first floor he designated as his staying area. “I'll be in my room. Just Call if you need me,” said Kaitlyn. “Want me to get you something to eat?” Zeke asked. “A drink would be nice but take your time,” she responded. “I'll get you something anyway,” I know you'll just end up eating all my snacks,” Zeke said. She was about to protest before showing a face of defeat and acceptance. “That's fair,” she said. 

“Yo Reed! I'm gonna take a look around the place and hit up the plaza. You wanna come?” Zeke said invitingly. “Yeah, sure! I was about to do the same thing,” I laughed. We stepped out into the coat of fog: the sky was still gray but the fog was starting to disperse. The cool breeze brought with it the smell of maple and pine. We took a tour around the retreat. Aside from the nearby shopping district, there wasn’t much to see other than plants and insects. 

After looking around and only finding an alarming number of spiders to hold our fascination, we decided to head to the shopping district. Zeke and I debated whether we could call it a plaza or not, which he suggested it was. It was a community of small shops scattered around a wide area beside a main road. We browsed a few trinket shops before heading to the “\[insert diner name\]”. The diner was a fair size. I swung the door open and a bell sounded above it; the kind that alerts employees and store owners when someone enters the facility. The pleasant aroma of coffee and tea wafted from behind the counter. Mellow Jazz quietly emanated from several radios stationed overhead. There was a certain air to the place that just immediately puts you at ease. I could feel the stresses of the day beginning to melt away as we entered the diner. 

The fog persisted through the evening. “Good afternoon,” said the person behind the counter; a chubby, young woman with long, black tied-back hair sporting an orange apron with the name of the diner emboldened on it in black. “Table fer two?” she asked. “Yes please!” replied Zeke. “Would you like a booth seat?” she asked. “That would be splendid!” he replied matter-of-factly with a smirk strewn across his face and nudged me with an elbow.

“Detectives need their privacy,” he remarked, only loud enough for me to hear. “I’m not a detective,” I said. “Follow me!” she said, grabbing a couple of menus. She brought us to a table at the side of the store near the corner and beside a window with the blinds down. As we were about to take a seat I noticed something that made all the stresses of the day start to creep back into me and my heart sank in my chest. Sitting at the booth in the corner right next to ours was a young woman with dirty blond hair and hazel brown eyes.
