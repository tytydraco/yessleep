Life can be pretty damn rough sometimes.  It can feel like days, months, and even longer that it feels like nothing’s going right, everything’s in a slow downward spiral to hell.  I’ve always believed that life just goes in cycles and waves.  Nothing too good lasts for too long, but on the flip side, nothing too bad lasts for too long either.  The key is figuring out how to enjoy good while it lasts and be fully present while doing whatever you can to ride out the bad that won’t leave too many lasting and permanent consequences.  

We all have our ways of managing.  Good coping skills, questionable vices, and all the things to get us through the rocky times.  Aside from the cigarettes and being a bar fly a bit too often, my go to for weathering the latest storms have been pinball.  I’ve loved pinball ever since I was a kid.  I have fond memories going to arcade with my friends in the mall where I grew up always trying to get my initials on the machines.  My interest really peaked in adulthood though.  There was just something about these kinds of games with their real life physical components along with their electronic video game aspects that just drew me in.  

So…. When life was getting me down, it became a regular practice to hit up one of the few bars around me to grab a couple of drinks and play some pinball, always trying to get a higher and higher score.  I’d frequently jokes that “I spent more money on the damn machines than I did on drinks”.  That was really only the case though until I figured the machine out.  

You see, you can be really good at pinball but if you don’t know the specific game, what you need to get the biggest jackpots, extra balls, the best order to hit everything, you stand very little chance of getting a high score. 

So here I sit at the Green Rock, one of my favorite local watering holes, a home away from home just a few short blocks from my house.  Before I hit the machine I take a seat at the bar for a pint and start chatting up a couple of the other regulars.  An older guy I see on the machines a lot and occasionally play with leans over and says

“You see they got a new machine in the other day?  It’s a sci-fi one… Alien Invasion.  It’s pretty good… hard though.  Balls go over the sides pretty easy if you’re not careful.”

“What happened to the old one?  I was just starting to get the hang of it.” 

“Oh… you know it had been having problems with the mechanical parts, not spitting the balls back out from underneath.  They had a guy come in and take a look at it, but sometimes these things cost more money to fix than they’re worth.  That or just can’t find the right parts.  You know for most of these, the few most popular being the exception, there are usually less than 5,000 total machines made.  Given most of the ones we see around here are from the 90’s or early 2000’s, can’t imagine there are that many more left, and even harder to find specific parts.” 

Ah…. You learn something new every day.  I did a quick phone check to verify this as I was pretty surprised that the number was so low.  

It’s always a bittersweet feeling when one machine is switched out for another.  I spend so much time learning the rules, perfecting my strategy, figuring just how much I can shake the thing without getting a tilt, and how much give or bounce I’ll get off of the flippers depending on how much wear and tear the individual machine has.  It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend but on the flip side, figuring out a new machine is always pretty exciting!  

I put a couple of dollars in for a few credits and go to work.  The machine lights up and I take notice of all of the moveable parts.  A big space ship in the middle, little green figurines of aliens that look somewhat like the stereotypical round head/big eyed fellas you see in old movies, but these look a bit more menacing with four arms and razor sharp teeth.  I’m really loving the craftsmanship on the miniatures and various parts!  The board itself looks like the inside of a spaceship with a ton of lights that flash or light up when hitting certain ramps.  If the gameplay is half as good as this thing looks, I’m going to be hooked on this thing before I leave the bar.  

I play a few balls that don’t last very long, usually bouncing off of the bumpers and shooting over the outlanes.  The first couple of games last me less than 5 minutes.  Damn… this does seem like a tough one.  Almost a waste of money if I keep losing so fast.  It’s getting me frustrated but I don’t give up so easily.  I have to get good at this so I can get my score up on the board before some of my local pinball rivals.  Right now, it’s just the pre-set names on the scoreboard.  You can usually tell they’re not actual people because they have even numbers.  “#1 JAM – 7,000,000,000,  MAC – #2 6,500,000,000 #3 SHB 6,000,000,000 #4  KYL 5,500,000,000 

I pump a few more dollars into the game and I get a little bit better with each play and start to recognize which bonuses and mini-games get me the most points.  

I’m still losing pretty quickly though and everytime I lose a ball…. The alien figurines start bouncing up and down and an 8bit animation of an alien pops up on the display screen and starts laughing at me.  I chug the rest of my Guinness and head outside for a smoke.  Gotta calm the nerves before giving it another go.  One more drink, a few more games, then I’ll head home.  That sounds like a good plan.  I’d like to get enough points to get one free game.  Before I get good enough at a machine to come even close to getting my name on the board for a high score, my first goal is to get enough to start getting free games regularly. The free game score is set for 2,000,000,000.  Less than half of what it’ll take me to get on the board, but I don’t expect to come close to that my first day messing with this machine.  

The sun’s starting to go down as I finish the last of my cigarette.  Better not take too long to finish up.  Even though I’m only a few blocks away, I always like to avoid having to walk anywhere around here by myself after dark.  I flick my cigarette butt into the ashcan outside and head back in.  I play a few more games before giving getting slightly higher scores, but not much in the results I was hoping for.  I didn’t have a tab to pay since I usually pay in cash so I’ve always got a few extra bills for the machine, so after I finished my last drink I headed out for home.  

Getting home I go through my usual routine:  feed the cats, let them outside for a bit, eat a quick dinner myself, put in a bit of time practicing guitar or throwing darts (today was darts), then plop down on the couch to un-wind watching re-runs of some of my go to shows I’ve seen way too many times while scrolling around the internet on my phone.  

I tried to look up the new pinball machine to learn more about how the game works.  It was odd though, I couldn’t find anything online about Alien Invasion.  I found a similar very popular game that even looked a lot like it, but went by a different name and had some small differences.  I looked up a few videos online of people playing through the similar one, a lot of the small figurines and pieces looked the same but the board looked different and the 8 bit animations and mini-games didn’t remind me of anything I had seen earlier in the day.  I started wondering if the one the Green Rock got was a cheap knock off but in actuality, the game at the bar seemed like it was higher quality and much more complex than these videos I was watching.

The next day was a busy one at work and a Friday.  I was pretty exhausted and got off a bit later than usual.  It was already dark when I got outside of the office and headed for home.  No plans with friends, no dates set up, so I figured I’d hop in the Green Rock for a few beers and some pinball before they got karaoke started and if I felt up to it, stay to hang out and maybe sing a few songs.  I got to my house, dropped my stuff off, fed the felines and walked the couple of blocks to the bar.  

It was already buzzing with a few of the regulars smoking outside, pretty crowded inside with folks who were probably trying to grab a bite to eat before karaoke started.  I figured I could get a few drinks and a couple of quick games in before they kicked it off and the place got mobbed.  I was still on the fence as to whether I had the energy and will to stick around or just go home and call it an early Friday night.  

A couple of guys I didn’t recognize were on the Alien Invasion game when I went in so I settled up to the bar, got a beer and shot, and bided my time until they were done.  I was feeling a little anti-social and didn’t feel like introducing myself to strangers and getting in on the game.  I made small talk with the bartender for a bit and bided my time until I saw them both leave the machine.  There’s my in!  

I down my shot and carry my beer over setting it down by the window next to the machine.  Put a few dollars in and get to it.  I’m surprised at how well I do at first considering how frustrated I was the first time I took a crack at it.  This was definitely a different game than I had seen when searching for it online.  

As I kept hitting ramps and triggering mini games I’d see 8-bit monochrome aliens show up on the screen, always making corny little threats!  “We’re coming to invade!”, “Nice shot but that’s not enough to stop us!”, “If you can’t beat us you’ll join us!”  

“Ha!”  I love how cheesy some of the lines are in these games.  The Green Rock was starting to get a bit more crowded but I played on.  The stress of the week was starting to melt away a bit and I felt like I was getting a bit of a second wind to maybe stay around longer.  I did lose a couple of balls getting distracted by folks brushing by me as they came in and walked past through the growing crowd.  Damn!  I do always hate that.  Always takes me out of my hyperfocus if someone walks a little too close to me when I’m in the middle of playing.  I wish I had a little more space, but that’s what I get for coming in on a Friday night.  

In spite of the distractions which were steadily increasing as karaoke night’s onset drew closer, I kept improving.  I didn’t score high enough to get on the board yet but I did get the first step towards my long term goal… the free play.  The one thing I DO love about a crowded room is startling a few folks that aren’t used to hearing the loud obnoxious click that’s universal to pinball machine’s when a free game is won.  

“POP!”  There it is.  A few people startled turn and look my way.  I lost the last ball shortly after that.  I went outside for a quick smoke leaving my beer by the window next to the machine so folks would see there were still credits in and my beer there so they knew I’d be back shortly to play out my last credit.  

I went back in and navigated my way through the crowd to the rest room.  It was a small bathroom with one full toilet, one urinal, a small sink with mirror above it, and a hand dryer.  I quickly relieved myself, washed my hands, brushed my hand through my hair to flatten out a few spots sticking up and turned on the electric hand dryer to wash my hands.  It made a lot of noise as usual which combined with the noise in the bar….. but oddly when the thing shut off… so did the noise outside of the bathroom.  

I opened up the door to go back in the bar and the whole place was dark and empty.  By dark I mean, all the lights were turned off.  I could still see relatively well from the light outside from the streetlights coming in the windows.  Nobody was in the bar.  No patrons, no bartenders.  The karaoke host who had been setting up the PA system was gone.  The only light inside was coming from the Alien Invasion pinball machine, which didn’t seem odd as I don’ t think they ever unplugged the machines so they’d keep all of the high scores…  So….. that didn’t seem odd, but where did everyone go?  I didn’t hear any noise at all and wondered if something happened outside that made everyone rush out.  

There were two doors that lead outside, the front door I usually came in and out of and a side door.  I went to the front door first and tried to push it open.... but no budge.  It was locked.  I tried to unlock the deadbolt but it wouldn’t budge.  I quickly walked over to the side door where I was met with the same thing.  

Hmmmmm….. was this some really big practical joke.  I leaned against some of the windows and tried my best to angle myself to see if folks were hiding along the walls next to them, but didn’t see anyone.  In fact…. I didn’t see anyone outside… no cars driving… nothing.  

My beer was still on the windowsill barely touched.  I picked it up and took a nervous gulp while trying to figure out what to do.  I took out my phone and was shocked with what I saw.  It read 3:23 am!  What the hell?   It couldn’t have been any later than quarter after nine when I just walked into the bathroom.  I didn’t know exactly but I know karaoke usually starts a little before 10.  

I couldn’t have passed out in the bathroom without anyone noticing.  I usually don’t lock it when I’m taking a piss since it can accommodate two….. and even if so, somebody would’ve noticed as crowded as it is.  The only thing I can think is somehow, some way… the owners and bartenders and everyone left and locked the place up without noticing me.  

Isn’t this some shit?  I mean there’s worse places in the world to be locked in than your favorite bar but still.  I know the owners pretty well but not well enough to have their numbers.  I can always send them a message on social media, so I grab my beer off the windowsill by the pinball machine, sit at the bar and go to open up my phone… “Damn… no service”  

I’ll try again in a few minutes I think.  There’s still one more credit in Alien Invasion so I give it a go.  I actually played pretty well.  I’d say the game lasted me a solid 10 minutes and I scored the highest I had so far earning another free game as I heard the familiar pop and the game shouting “Play Again!”  

I sit back at the bar and look at my phone again.  Still no service.  My beer finished, I scratch my head and wonder what I should do.  I mean there are a couple of booths I could probably fall asleep in.  They won’t come and open up until the afternoon though.  I could sure go for another drink… but no bartender here.  

Eh…. Given the circumstances I think they’d understand.  I reach across the bar and pour myself another Guinness from the tap leaving some cash on the bar for them to grab tomorrow.  “I think I’ll give myself a good tip as I stuff the rest of my cash back into my pocket.”  Yeah… I tell corny jokes even when I’m alone to make myself laugh.  I let the Guinness settle for a bit before getting ready to top it off and right before I reached back over the bar I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  

It looked like a dark shadow of someone or something moved across the window behind me and next to the pinball machine!   “Oh NO!  I’ve been caught!”  I say chuckling.  Maybe one of the owners saw me on a security camera or something and realized they locked up with someone still inside.  I go to the window and look out, again trying to angle myself to see if someone is standing right beside it just out of view…. 

BOOM!   For a split second I saw creature with green skin, round head, bulging black eyes and long skinny arms with black claws at the end of it’s four fingers press its face up to the window and smack it with both hands.  It stared at me with yellow reptilian eyes and razor sharp teeth.  I jumped back and almost tripped over my own feet before catching myself on a bar stool.  I looked back at the window and it was gone.  It looked just like one of the aliens from the damn game.  Wow… I know I can get a bit obsessive with these things… but this is whole other level.  

I slowly tip toe back up to the window and take a look outside… nothing.  The street’s empty aside from a few parked cars.  Still no traffic.  Ugh…. Must be losing my damn mind again.  I go back to the bar to finish pouring my Guinness and right as I top it off I see the lights on the Alien Invasion machine start flashing and the electronic voice shouts out

“Play Again”.  I did earn that free game… but hmmmm it usually only says that when you earn it…. Not randomly.  Before I could give it a second thought it sounded off again “PLAY AGAIN!”  ….  I said something I rarely do when it comes to pinball “Naaaah…. I think I’ve had enough for tonight.”  To which it responded “PLAY AGAIN!  PLAY AGAIN!  PLAY AGAIN! PLAY AGAIN!”  It kept repeating this louder and faster….  

I went up to the machine the lights flashing.  I looked around the back to unplug it…. But I couldn’t find the cord coming out the back of it.  While I was feeling around the back I heard the machine click and the sound of the ball launching.  

I instinctively shot up and got in front of the machine to play the ball.  The lights flashed and I hit my ramps as I usually would.  I started seeing some flashes come out of my peripheral vision out the window to my left.  I got a second and cradled the ball along the right flipper.  Holding down the right button I looked outside the window to my left.  

It looked like a lighting storm had started as I saw flashing but didn’t hear any thunder.  I started seeing shadowy figures quickly move between the parks cars on the street.  The game shook a bit…. On it’s own… and the ball moved off the flipper and I again instinctively shifted my attention back to the game and kept playing but glancing back and forth from the game to the window and the shadowy figures moving outside.  

I hit a ramp and the animation on the screen started “Satellite Lasor 1”, for a second while the ball was locked I saw a beam of light come down outside and hit next to a parked car near the window next to me.  I saw a green alien figure like the one who banged on the window light up… convulse and fall to the ground.  Oh Shit!  Did I do that?  Is this some Last Starfighter pinball type of situation?  A split second after I saw the creature fall to the ground I saw more shadows moving around and moving closer….

The ball popped out of it’s chamber and I kept playing…. Looking back and forth between the game and the window.  I didn’t know how this fully worked now so I kept aiming for the satellite laser ramp.  It took me a few tries but I finally hit one and saw another flash of light come down and hit another alien creature… this one a bit closer to the window.  The game animated with a Satellite Laser 2 image.    

I kept going…. I hit a 3^(rd)…. this time the same thing…. Another beam of light shooting from the sky, connecting with a shadowy figure that illuminated green and disgusting hiding along the street, now I got a good look… exactly like the 4 armed round headed piece of shit that banged on the window and scared me….. well the light or laser seemed to fry him up pretty good… there was a good amount of smoke coming out of his rattling body before he fell and it left him twitching on the ground afterwards.  Satellite laser #3.  

I kept playing…. Going off bumpers…. Shaking the machine a good amount in order not to lose the ball…. I started hearing crashing sounds outside… then I started smelling smoke….  When I got a chance to cradle the ball again I looked outside and it looked like several houses around the neighborhood were set on fire.  

I thought for a second I should stop and see if I had service again to call emergency to get the fire company out but in the very next second one of those Green fuckers popped up at the window in front of me and slammed their hands against it!

I jumped backwards…. But kept my hand on the right flipper button not losing the ball….. It pressed it’s face against the window smiling at me with a big shark tooth grin.  “Ooooooh Fuck…. Fuck!!! Hit that laser ramp….. hit that laser ramp!   I shot the ball up… it bounced off of a middle part… came down… then I did hit that laser ramp…. 

I saw a beam of light come down right next to the window…. But the alien creature jumped out of the way and quickly ran to the side out of my limited sight….  

“Oh shit… oh fuck….. oh shit….   What’s going on here?”   I looked outside for a second while waiting for the ball to come back down and noticed a hairline fracture in the window.  “They’re trying to get in to get to me.”  The machine started shaking and an animation came on the overhead screen in monotone 8-bit screaming at me “Satellite Laser Multi-Ball!”

Multiple balls started shooting out of the machine and it felt like I playing a juggling game rather than pinball…. Just trying to keep them all in play.  Every time I hit a ramp during this sequence I saw a beam of light shoot down out of my left periphery I imagine hitting one of the creatures as I started hearing shrieks coming from outside.  I kept going and going and going as long as I could…. Losing a ball here and there…. 

Multiballs usually always give the best opportunities to give the most points but if you’re not careful, they’re also an easy way to lose all the balls therefore losing your ball…

As good as I like to think I am…. That’s what happened to me.  The last ball drained over the side.  I had a second so I looked outside the window.  I saw countless corpses of these green creatures in the streets.  I must have had a damn good multi-ball.  

While looking around…. I saw a shadowy green figure come out from behind an SUV a bit away.  It came sauntering up to the window….. closer…. And closer…. And as it got a few feet from the window… I was pretty sure it was the same one that had banged on the window the first time and the second time.  It smiled a sadistic smile the whole way.  

It saw me looking at it and locked eyes.  It took it’s time getting up to the window.  It got right up in front me….. it was probably less than 10 inches from my face with only a thin sheet of already cracked glass separating us.  It mouthed words but I didn’t hear any sound coming out….. but a split second later the pinball machine voiced up with the recorded phrase I had heard before

“If you can’t beat us you’ll join us!”  

It started shaking and it’s head bounced back and forth like it was laughing at me.  After a few seconds, it turned and walked away.  Were they abandoning the attack?  I didn’t know what the hell was going on.  I gulped down the rest of my beer, started the pour for another one and sat at the bar facing the window.  I kept seeing lightning or whatever it was flashes outside.  I dropped some more cash on the bar for the beer I was taking and while I let my Guinness settle I walked to the back to go take a piss.  

Aaaaah man.  Are they done?  Are they going to try to sneak in from somewhere I can’t see?  What happens if I don’t do great on this last ball?   Do I need to keep playing?  I’ve got some more cash and if I have to I can always take from what I left on the bar.  Do I get another game if I screw this one up?  All of these thoughts are racing through my head while I do my business.  I turn on the sink and wash my hands and while rubbing them together I look up at the mirror and ….. “OH HOLY FUCK!”  My eyes have changed and look reptilian…. Yellowed with a vertical black slit for a pupil.  My skin looks really pale too and I hadn’t noticed before but its kind of itchy.  I scratch the left side of my face and the skin peels off revealing some green skin underneath.  

“Fuck these motherfuckers!”  I actually scream out loud.  That’s a damn dirty trick right there.  THAT’S WHAT HE FUCKING MEANT with that whole “If you can’t beat us join us” bullshit.  So I’m turning into one of those freaks?  So what is it?  Either they break in, abduct me… kill me…. Or if too much time passes I just turn into one of them?  I’m starting to feel like I’m in a pretty lose-lose situation here.  

Wait a minute though…. “If You can’t beat us you will join us”…. Well what if I do beat you?  Will it stop the transition?  Will I turn back?  I didn’t know anything for sure but I knew my eyes looked pretty crazy and my skin was slightly itching all over…. I didn’t want to scratch and reveal any more green scaly skin….. so I dried my hands on the back of my pants and walked back into the bar.
