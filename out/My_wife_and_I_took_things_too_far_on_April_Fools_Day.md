For the last decade, it’s been our annual tradition to hoodwink one another through increasingly elaborate tricks—always good-natured, and always confined to that April morning.

It was a spot of fun.

It was only ever *meant* to be a spot of fun.

I tend to be the one who is fooled the most, given that I rarely pay attention to the date. I need phone reminders to remember birthdays and anniversaries—even my own. Perhaps I should’ve set a reminder for April 1^(st), long ago, but I was never quite competitive enough to bother.

And I no longer want to think of that accursed day ever again.

Unlike me, Monica has always been a little better at keeping track of the days, so I’ve long had to work *hard* to dupe her. Typically, the smaller the prank, the less suspicious she becomes. If my mind ticks over quickly enough to conjure a trick on the spot, I’ll add something to whatever prank my wife has just pulled. That catches her off-guard.

Once, for instance, Monica pranked me at my workplace, so I convinced her that she’d parked on the double-yellows outside and would have to move her car before the traffic warden arrived. It gave me a chuckle to watch her rush outside.

Still, that was a minor prank, like most of the stunts I’ve pulled over the years. But I’d always wanted to do something *bigger*, and this year, the stars aligned. On March 31^(st), my silly, unobservant, caveman brain did something out of the ordinary.

It clocked the date.

I actually managed to prepare for April Fool’s Day.

Now, it *can* be a little tricky to plan anything whenever April 1^(st) falls on a weekday, but things lined up nicely this year, as I work from home on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And I came up with something silly but harmless.

When I woke on the big day, around eight in the morning, I was relieved to find that I hadn’t opened my eyes to a bedroom cluttered with near-bursting balloons, like two years earlier. Of course, I had no doubt that Monica was planning something far greater, but I remained determined not to be fooled.

For once, I was ready for my wife’s tomfoolery; more importantly, I was ready for a little of my *own*.

“Good morning, Brad,” she said as I entered the kitchen hurriedly.

I mustered up my sternest and most sombre expression, then shook my head firmly. “Not really.”

Monica smiled. “Oh, I see… You remembered that it’s—”

“— Mittens is stuck on the roof,” I interrupted, preventing her from revealing the date, so as not to arouse doubt—so as not to, most importantly, fudge my one shot at nailing the perfect prank.

Mittens, our white-pawed tabby cat, is the true love of Monica’s life. And though our oft-fearless feline loves to explore, she has a tendency to be afflicted by panic attacks at the most inopportune moments.

For greater context, our house sits in the angular nook of a cul-de-sac; it bears an L-shaped layout, with the upper bedroom overlooking the garage. Whenever the window is left ajar, Mittens jumps out onto the garage’s roof tiles, and then she’ll jump another storey down to the driveway below. But quite often, the she becomes quite suddenly shell-shocked and freezes in the gutter, uncertain about making the jump.

This was the perfect set-up for my prank.

Build off an everyday occurrence: that’s the way to trick a trickster.

Of course, as I said, I wanted to go *bigger*. A tame prank such as this would’ve been sufficient to fool Monica, but it hardly would’ve been satisfying. Not nearly as satisfying as whatever she had planned.

“Give her a few minutes and she’ll jump down,” Monica said, before wrinkling her brow. “Why do you look so worried? She spends half her life on that roof.”

I gulped convincingly, then delivered the blow. “Mittens is stuck on the *top* roof.”

Monica’s eyes grew large.

A storm felled one of our garden’s tall oaks last month, and it tumbled directly onto the second-floor roof, creating a staggering large hole in it. We hired help and managed to clear the tree and debris, but we still haven’t raised the funds for a roofing job yet; the temporary fix was to nail a couple large tarpaulins over the hole, somewhat sheltering the attic from the elements.

Professionals told us that the entire roof would need to be redone, as the damage done to it had brought its entire structural integrity into question.

Therefore, the thought of Mittens being up there, rather than on the lower garage roof, was alarming.

Monica gasped and shot up from her seat. “Why is she even on the top roof? She’s *never* gone up there. Did she climb up the pipe?”

I shrugged my arms. “I don’t know. I woke up and heard meowing from the bedroom window. When I poked my head out, I could see her a few feet above me, shivering as she peered over the edge of the top gutter. I tried to encourage her to jump into my arms, but…”

Monica had already rushed past me at this point, and I was tailing her up the stairs with a broad grin on my face. Once we’d scurried into the bedroom and my wife had shoved her head out of the bedroom window, I failed to hold my breath any longer—I let out an almighty snort.

“*MITTENS!*” Monica screeched into the sky, leaning backwards out of the window to look up at the roof’s edge. “I don’t see her up there, Brad! Why are you laughing about this? We…”

She trailed off, then pulled her head back into the room, wearing a smirk and flushed cheeks. “Oh, you little *shit*.”

“*APRIL FOOL!*” I brayed with laughter. “Mittens is sleeping in the bathroom, you plonker! I was worried she’d give the game away.”

“That was a better trick than usual from you, I have to admit,” Monica replied, eyeing me with great respect, hands on her hips. “You know, I—”

“— *MONICA?*” yelled a croaky, but tremendous voice from our driveway.

It was Mr Worth from next door.

Monica’s cheeks flushed more brightly, and I started cackling louder, relishing in the greater success of my harmless joke. Now she’d embarrassed herself in front of the neighbour. Not just any neighbour: Mr Worth. The old, beady-eyed, grey-haired Scrooge who everybody on the street feared. Not a pleasant man in the slightest.

“Monica, are you okay?” Mr Worth continued from outside. “I was just watering the peonies, and I heard… Hello? Are you still there? Why were you screaming?”

She groaned. “Oh, I really don’t want to have to explain everything to that psychopath… The worst part is that he’ll tell *me* off for this, not you!”

Then my wife’s eyes widened, and she rushed back to the window. “Mr Worth! Oh, thank *heavens* for you! Bradley was messing around and he threw our cat up onto the roof!”

“*What?*” I hissed from behind her, tugging at the back of her T-shirt. “*Truce!*”

Monica continued, “And poor little Mittens won’t come down! She’s so scared up there. She’s—”

“— *Bloody idiots!*” Mr Worth roared in interruption. “The pair of you. Bloody idiots. You were screaming over a cat? Give me strength. I thought one of you had actually found yourselves in trouble, but you… Hey, where have you gone? Stop disappearing, young lady! *I’m talking to you!*”

Monica had pulled her head back into the bedroom, and she was giggling uncontrollably.

“Why did you tell him that?” I moaned.

“What do you mean?” Monica answered innocently, fluttering her eyelashes. “I was just passing along the story that *you* told me, Brad.”

“With a slight embellishment,” I groaned, coming to a realisation. “Let me guess: I’m going to have to be the one to tell the miserable, old man that it was all a prank?”

My wife nodded cheekily. “Seems only fair. Besides, I’ve already received a telling off from him, so you’re *definitely* due one for getting us into this mess!”

I rolled my eyes and shook my head with a smile. “You pulled a Brad—turned the prank around on me. Right, I’ll go and put my shoes on. Don’t much fancy taunting him from the window.”

I slumped downstairs, searched for a good pair of trainers that wouldn’t earn a cursory look, or a few cutting words, of disapproval from our horrid next-door neighbour. And as I slipped into a respectable pair, there came a heavy thud from outside.

I hurried over to the front door, flung it open, and laid my disbelieving eyes upon the seventy-something-year-old Mr Worth ascending a tall metal ladder up to the roof.

“Stop!” cried out Monica disbelievingly from the bedroom window. “We were only—”

“— *One more word out of you, and I’ll call the police*,” Mr Worth hissed in my wife’s face as he climbed past our bedroom window at a surprisingly nimble pace. “Filthy creatures, cats, but they still deserve better owners than the likes of you two.”

“Mr Worth!” I yelled, trying to finish what Monica had been saying. “It was a joke. An April—”

“— *Where is the damn beast?*” the old man interrupted again as he poked his head over the edge of the roof, scanning its tiles.

Our neighbour either willingly ignored us or, perhaps more likely, had not registered a word we said. He was often too stubborn to admit that he was hard of hearing.

Monica winced as the old man dragged his frail body over the edge of the roof. “*BRADLEY!*”

I’d already started to climb up the ladder behind the crawling man, realising that, for whatever reason, he wasn’t listening to us. I could hear his knobbly knees and bony hands shuffling across the tiles, taking him dangerously near to the tarpaulins—to the hole which spanned a sizeable stretch of the roof.

I could see little from my perspective, but I certainly *heard* that sound.

That thunderous crash, followed by a few more thunderous crashes.

And two intermingled screams.

“*MONICA!*” I bellowed, rapidly slipping down the ladder and half-twisting my ankle at the bottom.

I limped back into the house, climbed the stairs, then stopped at the entrance to the bedroom.

The bed and the carpet were both buried beneath a three-feet-tall heap, comprising of shingles, groove chipboard panels, and plasterboard. The room’s ceiling had gone, as had the attic and roof above it. A hole revealed the sky above, letting blinding sunlight inside.

“Monica…” I whimpered, eyeing the unthinkably dense mound of rubble.

“*Here*,” whispered a timid voice from behind me.

With my heart thumping, fearful adrenaline replaced with overbearing joy, I spun at immense speed. And I released a grateful wail when I faced my pale-faced, anxious wife on the upstairs landing. I dashed forwards and embraced her, so immensely glad that she had backed away from the bedroom before Mr Worth came tumbling through the roof and ceiling.

“He’s in there, isn’t he?” I asked, gulping as I turned back to face the demolished bedroom. “Somewhere in that rubble, he’s…”

“*Stop*,” Monica blubbered, eyes welling as she stared into the room.

“Sorry,” I apologised, then I tore my phone out of my pocket. “You’re right, Mon, it’s not safe in here. We need to go downstairs. I’ll call an ambulance, and… Jesus… Poor Mr Worth…”

It was only once I’d absent-mindedly walked downstairs, whilst explaining what had happened to the emergency operator, that I realised Monica wasn’t following. I looked back upstairs in confusion, only half-hearing the voice in the phone telling me that paramedics and firefighters were coming.

“Mon?” I called out. “Come on.”

“Are you two still inside the house?” the eavesdropping operator asked. “It’s an unsafe structure. Please wait on the driveway for emergency responders.”

“*Monica!*” I cried a second time as I placed a hand on the staircase’s bannister. “It’s not safe up there. Come downstairs.”

But my wife’s eyes, wet and unblinking, remained fixed on the bedroom door ahead. She hadn’t budged an inch.

“*Stop*,” she repeated, not turning to look at me as I made my way upstairs.

“We need to get away from the bedroom, Mon,” I said, making my way onto the landing with an outstretched hand. “You need to stop looking at it.”

“But *it* won’t stop looking at me,” she whispered.

Those words set my hairs set on end, as did something else.

A cold gaze that fell upon me, burning into my flesh.

I followed Monica’s eyeline to the bedroom. To the bulge of ceramic and plaster that had filled up that space. The wreckage had formed a ramshackle den of sorts, and in that hidey-hole’s shadowed recess, I saw it.

A single bloodshot eye watching us from the dark.

I wanted to open my mouth to cry, but that terror remained very much on the inside, for the icy, wintry gaze had frozen me quite stiffly to the spot—which, of course, only terrified me more greatly.

Then the debris shifted, and out emerged the shape that sported the eye.

*The shape of Mr Worth.*

Only, once that man had freed himself of his rubble shackles, it became clear that he was no longer our next-door neighbour—or, at least, no longer *human*, given the many long, hefty, blood-stained wood fragments puncturing through his body, from front to back and back to front—one two-feet-long piece of wood travelled through the grey matter in his skull, exiting through a bloody eye socket at the front of his face.

It was horrifyingly impossible.

There was no earthly way in which that man could’ve been standing on two feet.

No possible way in which he could be observing the two of us with his one remaining eye.

The only living thing remaining of Mr Worth was his rage. Rage he exuded from a white complexion.

The man lurched forwards, and the outline of his body warbled slightly, making it clear that this spectacle wasn’t the superhuman feat of some brain-damaged man near-death—a man using the last of his brain’s functionality to rise to his feet.

No, this was some paranormal anomaly sitting in disarray with its surroundings.

The colour and shape of his body didn’t seem rigid. Seemed neither entirely opaque nor grounded in reality. This nightmare walking towards Monica and me was not Mr Worth.

It was his undead spirit.

And it wanted us.

There was no time to process the unholiness and inexplicableness of such things as *spirits* existing.

“*RUN!*” I screamed, grabbing my wife’s hand.

As I turned to flee, one of the creature's chipped, discoloured nails tore into my forearm, leaving a jagged wound that is still festering as I type.

I yelped and pulled Monica away, hoping to save her from that fiend.

As we tore down the stairs, I felt the warmth of her hand in mine this time; I’d finally pried her away from the landing. Away from the terrifying pursuer. Its spectral energy clung to our world, blaming us for its demise, and I didn’t plan on letting it rob us of life too—of bringing us into its world.

There came a rush of freedom both physical and supernatural as I rushed through the front door and the air hit my face. The unliving thing was bound to its resting place. It could not follow beyond that threshold.

I ran into the street, hearing the approaching sirens of the ambulance and fire engine, and then I kept running—kept running as people asked that same question, over and over. A question that took time to sink into my mind. Long after the emergency responders had poured out of their vehicles and into my house.

“Where’s Monica?”

I realised that I hadn’t felt the warmth of my wife’s hand in mine since leaving the house.

And hours later, once the adrenaline had fled my body to make room for the paramedics’ terrible words, I finally processed the truth.

The firefighters had found two bodies in the [rubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
