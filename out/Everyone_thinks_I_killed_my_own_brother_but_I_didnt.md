As I walk into the police station, I notice the officers' eyes on me. Watching every move. Judging.

"*Did she do it? Did she really kill her own brother?*"

That's the question on everyone's mind after Greg died last week.

He fell to his death from the 11th-floor apartment where we live with our mother. Neighbors mentioned a heated argument between us right before it happened, and the media ate it up.

An older, polite officer approaches and gestures for me to follow him into the interview room. He motions for me to sit.

"I'm sorry about all this, Ms. Lana," he says, flipping through some papers in a folder. "But we need to get everything straight in this case."

I nod. He asks if I'm sure I don’t want a lawyer. I confirm it.

He sets the papers aside and opens a small notebook, a pen resting inside.

"Can you tell me how your relationship with your brother was?"

That’s a tricky question, but I tell him the truth. It wasn't great.

My brother was controlling and aggressive from a young age. He used to steal my things and threaten me with a small knife he took from our father to keep me quiet.

He was expelled from two schools, once for beating a kid until he passed out and another because he set fire to an entire classroom when a teacher refused to change his grade.

He was very close to our father and, when he died, Greg got worse. *Much worse*.

To the officer, I give a lighter version of the story. I don’t want to seem like I hated my brother.

He writes it down, slowly. "And your mother?"

"My mother is incredible," I explain, feeling a pang of emotion. "She raised us mostly alone, doing her best. Our father was… difficult."

"I can only imagine the pain she's going through," he interrupts in a calm voice, locking eyes with me. "Losing another family member like that, only a few years after he died."

It was clear in his eyes that he thought I had done it. Offed my brother, you know.

Then came the golden question.

"Can you recount the events of that night as you remember?"

I tell him it’s mostly a blur, but I’ll do my best.

Greg did something stupid, like leaving the milk out or not washing the dishes. I confronted him and he exploded, yelling. 

His voice sounded off—maybe he had been drinking. He cursed and threatened me.

I went to my room and—moments later—heard a thud, followed by my mother breaking down in tears.

The officer doesn’t write anything this time, and drops his pen.

"That’s not the whole truth, is it, Ms. Lana?" His head tilts slightly, as if he’s caught me in a lie.

"There were scratch marks on his arm, likely from a struggle," he continues. "We haven’t tested the DNA yet, but I have a strong feeling we’ll get a match."

He glances at my hands, where a few nails are broken at the tips.

"That doesn't make much sense to me," I challenge, though his direct approach catches me off guard.

He gives me a knowing look and picks up his pen again, flipping through his notes. "Do you know a girl named Abigail? Someone your brother was recently involved with?"

I gulp. He knows.

"So, I guess you do," he says with a smirk. "She filed a report against your brother the day before his death. Did you know that?"

"No, I didn't," I fake surprise. "What happened?"

"She reported an attempted murder," he reads from the file. "Greg beat her so badly she was barely recognizable. She only survived because she managed to escape his car."

"That’s... disturbing."

"You’re right. And you knew already, didn’t you? She told us she warned you the morning he died." He leans forward, watching my reaction.

I don’t say anything. I start to wonder if refusing a lawyer was a mistake.

"And there is one more girl, Jenna," he continues. "His ex. She had been missing for a few months, but we recently found her dismembered body by a dirt road."

My eyes widen. I didn’t know the details, but I feared this might have happened. 

"We suspect there are more,” he leans back, his posture hinting at sympathy for me. "It’s time to bring justice to these women. I know this is probably why you pushed him that ni—"

Before he finishes, I stand up and ask if I’m under arrest.

He shakes his head.

"Then I’ll leave now," I say, walking to the door. "I hope I’ve helped."

I leave the station with tears in my eyes. Those poor girls—what had he done to them? How could he be so much like our father?

My mother is waiting right in front of the main entrance, sitting on a bench. Her face lights up when she sees me, and we hug tightly.

I’ll *never* tell them what she did that night.

How she saved me from Greg, as he held a razor to my throat, gripping my neck by the window, after I confronted him about those women.

How she pushed him without hesitation, sending her own son to his death.

How, a few years ago, she poisoned our father to also end his endless cycle of abuse and violence.

Mom believed it was over when she killed him, but it wasn’t. Greg followed in his father’s footsteps.

Maybe now she can finally have some peace, though it came at such a high price.

"Let's go home," she murmurs, her voice heavy with sorrow, gripping my hand. And we go.
