It was the following Sunday when I met 7 year old Gina Balk. Like [Tommy](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zlex9w/the_haunting_case_of_mr_needlenose_tommy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) before her, she, too, was recommended to me by the school board for concerning behaviors. Different school from Tommy, but very much a similar case, with the key difference being that Gina, unlike Tommy, was apparently much more aggressive with her behaviors. Obviously, I can't divulge too much into the case, but suffice to say, her behaviors were a far more severe case. Her session started very much similar to Tommy's, with me turning on the tape recorder.

"Hello, Gina, My name is Dr. Randall. How're you doing today?" Like her predecessor, she also didn't say anything at first. Instead, she just bore daggers into me with her eyes. Where Tommy looked scared, terrified if something, Gina was the polar opposite. I actually felt myself brace to have to jump up and defend myself at any instant.

My hands shaking a bit, I began to shuffle through the documents to find her school incident reports. "So Gina," I began again, "It says here you like to play rough with your classmates..." No response from her, only glaring. "Do your classmates try to play rough with you?"

Her head tilted to the right. "Gina, can you hear me?" My hand began trembling. "Is something bothering you?" Her head straightened back out and she smiled. A genuine, sweet sort of smile, opposed to the death glare from not even two seconds ago.

"Hi, Dr. Randall!" she said, giggling sweetly. My body froze. I expected her to try and pull a blade or something (Something I knew, thanks to the incident report, she was capable of doing and known for doing), *or* try to say that "She got me", playing it off. Nope, instead she just giggled and waved at me.

"You look scared, Dr." she remarked. She gasped and asked, "Did you see something scary?" Her head shrunk down and she tucked her knees to her chest. I took a deep breath, clearing my throat and forcing the best smile I could.

"No, Gina, nothing scary here." I said, chuckling awkwardly. She relaxed again in her seat. "No Gina, actually, I wanted to tell you that you can feel safe here. Here is a place where no one will hurt you, no one will--"

"What about you?" she piped up. I frowned.

"I beg your pardon?"

"What about you? You said no one will hurt me, but who's gonna protect you?" My body tensed up again.

"What do you mean?" I asked, narrowing my eyes at her. She still looked normal, a sweet and happy little girl.

*A sweet, happy little girl known for sneaking blades into an elementary school and threatening people with them...*

"Well if it's just you and me, and you're watching over me, then who's gonna watch and protect *you*?"

Chuckling again, I replied, "Well, I suppose you have a fair point. Let me ask you then, why would someone need to watch over me?"

"To keep you safe, silly!" she replied, giggling harder.

"Safe from what, may I ask?" This was when her giggling stopped abruptly and she stared at me, confused. "Gina?" She turned her head about the office before looking to me, gesturing for me to come closer. Hesitantly, every muscle in my body trying to resist against what I was doing, I turned my head to the right and leaned forward toward her.

She whispered, *"From him."*

*"From who?"* I answered.

*"Him, he's my friend."*

*"Who is?"*

*"Mr. Needle-nose."*

My eyes bulged. My heart stopped.

*"Wh-Who?"*

*"Mr. Needle-nose. He likes to play with me."*

*"Wh-What does he like to play?"*

*"He likes to play 'Piggies in a box.'"*

*"What?"*

*"It's where he takes piggies like you and makes 'em SQUEAL!"* My heart beat faster and faster, hammering harder and harder, trying to punch straight through my ribcage. *"And when they don't squeal no more,"* she continued, her voice taking on an even more excited, almost cheery tone with each word, *"He'll chop 'em up and put 'em in a box. Then, you got a piggy in a box!"*

She slowly relaxed back into her seat. I stayed frozen as I was, leaning over my desk, breathless and quivering. As shameful as this may sound, I'd never been more afraid, of anybody or anything, in my entire life the way I was afraid in that very moment. Not only was the memory of Tommy coming back to me, but now there was this, this little girl that, for as much as I knew, damn well had it in her to kill me. "What's wrong, Doctor Randall? See something scary?"

She was smiling at me again. I slowly brought myself back into my seat. She giggled again, taking the silence as her answer. I cleared my throat, "Yes, well, If I may ask, how often do you and your friend play 'Piggy in a box'?"

She shrugged. "Dunno. Whenever he comes to play."

"And how often does he come to play?"

"Whenever he wants."

"Do you invite him or does he just show up without saying anything?"

"He just comes over when he wants to play with me."

"Does he want to play with you now?" A shiver rushed down my back as those words left my mouth. She looked around the office again. She turned to me again, giggling, and shook her head. "Does he have any other friends like you?" Her smile fell.

"What do you mean?"

"Well, does he like to play with other kids or only you?" She stared at me with a mixed expression of confusion and something similar to betrayal. In other words, she was looking at me like I asked her if she knew her boyfriend was cheating on her or something.

"N-No... No, I'm his bestest friend." she said. She started shaking now, similar to how Tommy did.

"Okay, well, let me ask you this, how long have you and Mr. Needle-nose been playing together?"

"Um... I don't know... a few weeks ago, maybe?" Her voice grew smaller and smaller now. I was hitting something hard with her, something deep. Possibly even deeper than she even knew.

"A few weeks ago, huh?" I asked. She nodded, looking at me with big, frightened eyes. She looked vulnerable now. This was the frightened little girl in her showing. Whatever she'd been before, it was a front, some sort of mask that I wasn't convinced she was even aware of -- until now.

"And how did you meet Mr. Needle-nose?"

"He... He came to me on the playground one day during recess."

"Did the other kids see him?"

"Nuh-uh, he said only I can see him because I'm his bestest friend."

"Do you have any other friends at school?" Her head shrunk down into her shoulders again. "The other kids are mean to you, aren't they?"

"They never wanna talk to me." she whimpered.

"How come?"

"I... I don't know... They just don't..." I heard her start to sniffle, "They don't like me."

"Has anyone said that to you?" She shook her head. "How do you know they don't like you?"

"They won't play with me. They just look at me like they're scared."

"Have you done something to make them afraid of you?"

"No... at least I don't think so." She started to curl up again, this time *actually* afraid.

"You don't think so?" I asked. I knew by looking at her that I was breaching uncomfortable territory with her and I *was* admittedly worried if I pushed too much further that I'd end up with another situation like Tommy.

"I... I don't know, can we talk about something else? Please, sir?"

I swallowed and replied, "Of course, what would you like to talk about?" She shrunk deeper in her chair. "Why don't we talk about what goes on at home?"

"O-okay..." she murmured.

"What do you like to do at home?" She began to straighten up in her chair at this.

"Well, I like to draw sometimes."

"Really?"

"Uh-huh."

*Interesting*, I thought. I started to think about ways to maybe reach her through artwork when I was notified by Walter that the appointment was over. As I led Gina to the door, I smiled as warmly as possible and told her, "Well, it was nice meeting you, Gina. I hope we can continue making progress." She nodded at this. "Now Gina, I want you to do something for me."

She turned back to me. "You like to draw, right?"

"Uh-huh."

"Well, when we meet again, I would like you to bring some of your drawings and your art supplies, okay? Think you can do that for me?" She slowly nodded her head before trudging out of the office in a daze. In the lobby, Her parents and I scheduled for the next visit to take place the next Sunday. Briefly as we talked, I noticed Gina looking around the lobby like she'd done in the office earlier, this time however with a noticeably more anxious expression on her face than she'd had before. She was looking out for something...

Or somebody...

*But who?*

I started to think again about what she'd said about how she and Mr. Needle-nose were "Bestest friends." Why did it make her so uncomfortable when I suggested that he had other friends? Why was she so afraid of him now?

The most I could do at the moment then was to wait for the next visit and hope that I can get her to reach out to me through her artwork. If nothing else, I might at least be able to see who or whatever this Mr. Needle-nose looks like. The rest of the week was more or less a blur. I guess because of the bizarre and twisted nature of the case, one that appeared more and more connected the more I thought about it, this took more of my focus than anything else. Before I knew it, Sunday rolled around and I was back in my office with Gina again.

She was noticeably more cheerful in the beginning than last time. Like I'd hoped, she brought her art supplies. We sat down and I turned on the tape recorder again.

"Welcome back, Gina. How're we doing today?" My voice was as smooth as I could make it. I was hoping to start this session off with a more friendly tone than the last time.

"I'm great, Dr. Randall!" she exclaimed. She sat her sketchbook and crayons on the table.

"Ah, I see you brought the art supplies, very good."

"Uh-huh."

"May I see a few of your drawings?" This caused her smile to drop. She started to slump down in her chair again. "What's the matter? Didn't you bring them?"

"Uh-huh..." she muttered hesitantly. She turned her head down, like she'd done something wrong.

"Is there something wrong with them?" She shook her head. "Well, if I may ask, Why can't I see them?"

"You won't like them." I frowned.

"And why not?"

"Nobody likes 'em."

"What do you mean?"

"They're not pretty."

"Why do you say that? Did someone tell you that?" She shook her head. "Well then I ask again, why do you think that I wouldn't like your drawings?"

"They're scary!"

"Scary?" I asked, raising my eyebrow. She nodded. "Scary how?"

"They're of creepy things, like monsters and things that eat people."

"Monsters eating people, huh? You like that sort of thing?" She looked back up to me and nodded. "You like monsters?" She nodded again, still looking nervous.

"You know..." I said in a lighthearted, encouraging sort of voice, "I like monsters, too." Her eyes grew.

"You do?" she asked.

"Uh-huh. Used to watch 'em all the time when I was your age. You know which one my favorite was?" She shook her head. "The Mummy." I made my eyes go big and sort of serious while crossing my arms over my chest. This made her giggle a bit. I was reaching her again.

"Who's your favorite?"

She rubbed her chin for a moment before answering, "I like the Wolfman."

"He's cool, too."

"Yeah, he's big and tough, with big teeth too." She opened her mouth to show me her teeth before pretending to howl at the ceiling. I smiled.

"I'll bet you like to draw the Wolfman, don't you?"

"Sometimes."

"Can I see?" She nodded and began sifting through her sketchbook through her drawings. She pulled out a small stack of them and slid them to me. I started looking through them. I have to say this much, for being as young as she was, without taking any sort of art classes, in or out of school, her drawings were surprisingly detailed. Nothing magazine worthy, sure, but again, more than the average 7 year old's art. "These are *excellent!*" I exclaimed.

"You like 'em?" she asked.

"Yeah! I like how you made the fangs nice and big and the fur looks really well detailed."

She giggled and said, "Thanks, Dr. Randall."

"Do you draw any other monsters?"

"Well sometimes I draw the fish man from "Creature from the Black Lagoon" and Frankenstein and sometimes the Fly. I don't really like the Fly, though. He's just too gross, you know?" I chuckled.

"Yeah, he was never my favorite, either. His eyes used to creep me out." She giggled again. "Can I see the other monsters?" She nodded and passed the rest of the drawings to me. Looking through them, they weren't all quite as impressive as the Wolfman ones were (though still damn good for a little girl), but I could see that she had a creative spin with them.

A lot of them were of her standing hand-in-hand with whatever monster she was attempting to portray. They weren't limited to the Universal monsters, either. One or two of them were of her and, at least what I assumed was Freddy Krueger (this drawing admittedly not being drawn as well), sitting together making paper dolls or something. Another was her, Jason Voorhees, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon swimming in a lake together. "You like to play with the monsters, I see."

"Uh-huh. They're my friends."

"Really, now?"

"Yeah, they like playing with me."

"Why's that? How come they don't wanna eat you?"

"Well 'cause I'm nice to them. Nobody else is, but I am."

"And so they like you because of that?"

"Uh-huh."

"They don't have any other friends?"

"Nope. I'm their bestest friend, and they're mine, too."

I sighed and narrowed my eyes at her, asking, "Just like Mr. Needle-nose?" As expected, her smile began to fall. "Do you have any drawings of him?"

"Yeah." she replied, sounding timid, though not exactly afraid. More so curious, though still small, like she was wondering what he had to do with anything.

"Can I see them?" Sure enough, perhaps gaining enough of her trust, she actually sifted through her sketchbook again and pulled out another, noticeably smaller, handful of drawings and slid them to me. I started looking through them, immediately noticing a distinct drop in quality of detail compared to the others.

These were a lot more akin to kindergartener-esque artwork. For example, instead of colorful buildings or scenes in nature like the others were, the backgrounds in *these* were nothing but these large black blocks. She was in these, too, looking happy like she had in the others, but this time, she was completely alone. Well, except for the tall, lanky figure that I caught in the background.

Because the surroundings themselves were so dark and shadowy, I almost completely glossed over the whole thing, not even noticing the figure apparently peeking out from one of the backgrounds. It had two white, empty circles for eyes and a wide-split looking mouth, grinning at Gina. This, and the weird sort of hat shape at the top of his head were the only things notable about him in the picture. I looked through a few more of them.

I noticed that only one thing ever seemed to change with each passing one. In each one, the figure seemed to be moving closer and closer to Gina. Because the space of the scenery was so narrow, I started to realize that it must've been Gina's attempt at portraying an alleyway of some sort. Either that, or perhaps a really long hallway of some sort. I looked back up at Gina. She was still staring at me curiously.

I pointed to the figure in the drawings. "Mr. Needle-nose?" I asked.

"Uh-huh." she replied.

"I see. Does he always look like this?"

"Usually."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, he sometimes wears something different."

"Like what?" She pointed to the "Hat" on the figure's head.

"Sometimes the hat is different."

"What other kind of hat does he wear?" She frowned and started rubbing her chin.

"Well, you know how a sailor's hat kind of looks?" I nodded, narrowing my eyes on her. "Well, it's sort of like that, but it's all black like the rest of him."

"What about the rest of him?" Shivers pricked down my back, a haunting sense of familiarity coming back to me.

"What about it?" she asked.

"Well, what else does he wear besides the hat?" She shrugged.

"I dunno. I don't think I've ever even seen him *wear* clothes."

"So he just wears the hat and is naked everywhere else?"

She shrugged and said, "I guess."

"Well, what's he doing here in the drawings?"

"Oh, well that's us playing hide and seek."

"Ahh, and you're supposed to be "it", right?"

"Uh-huh."

"But then, why's Mr. Needle-nose coming toward you like that?" She shrugged again.

"I dunno, he just does."

"Does he always do this when you two play hide and seek?"

"Yeah, but we don't really play it that much."

"You don't? Well, how often *do* you two play it then?"

"Every once in a while. Why are you asking me this, Doctor Randall? You look scared again."

"What happens when he reaches you?" I asked, ignoring her question. She started to look nervous again. "Gina, what happens when you and Mr. Needle-nose play hide and seek?"

"I-I... I don't know." She stammered, her voice starting to crack. "I don't wanna talk about this anymore, Doctor Randall, can we please talk about something else?" I stared at her for a moment. I could see she was uncomfortable again. I knew I couldn't push too much harder, but at the same time, I knew I had to be able to get the answer from her.

"Gina," I repeated, "What does Mr. Needle-nose do when he gets to you?"

"I don't know!" she cried. "He just comes and then... and then..."

"And then what?"

"Then I'm not there anymore."

"Not where?"

"There, in the real world."

"Where are you?"

"I'm somewhere else, with candy and fluffy animals."

"So he tags you here," I pointed to the drawing of them in the alleyway, "and you just *poof* into candy land?"

"Y-Yeah, I-I think so..."

"Why do you go there, do you know?" She shook her head. "Is *he* there, too?"

"Nuh-uh, it's just me and the fluffy animals." I nodded.

"And just where *is* Mr. Needle-nose?"

"He's still here."

"But no one else sees him?"

"No."

"Do you see him or what he does here while you're out there?" She shook her head. "So you just lose the real world and play around in the candy land while Mr. Needle-nose stays and messes around out here?"

"I guess."

"Okay, now Gina, this is important, when you go to candy land, does Mr. Needle-nose say anything to you?"

"Well, he *does* tell me to have as much fun as I want and that he'll come back for me when he's ready."

"When he's ready?"

"Yeah, like when my mommy and daddy drop me off at daycare and tell me they'll be back for me when they're ready, after work or whatever."

"So Mr. Needle-nose drops you off there?"

"I guess."

"Do you ever ask him about it?"

"Nuh-uh."

"Okay, and you don't know what he does here in the real world, right?"

"Nuh-uh."

"Okay, now what about when he "picks you up", so to speak? What happens then?"

"Well, I'm just... here again."

"Just here, huh? You don't travel through some sort of doorway or portal or anything?"

"Nuh-uh, I just see him coming again and then I'm here again. Kinda like I'm waking up from a dream."

"Really?" I raised my eyebrow. I felt like certain dots were starting to connect, at least in terms of her behaviors. Then again, certain *others* still weren't. Sure, by the looks of the conversation, you'd probably see this as a textbook case of D.I.D. or something similar, possibly even acute Schizophrenia. That *would* explain the apparent disconnect from reality Gina described and the abrupt personality shifts, with Mr. Needle-nose as the alternate, seemingly hostile alter. From a child's eyes, It wouldn't be hard to see why an alter would be passed off as an imaginary friend of some sort -- one that just so happens to stick around long after he should've been gone.

Just one glaring problem. The details of this case are also a little too consistent with the case from before, with Tommy. Both children described Mr. Needle-nose as "Their bestest friend", and both children are seemingly unaware of the behaviors that had them recommended to me in the first place. Not only that, but at least to *some* degree, both children were afraid of him. To top it off, they both also gave almost the exact same descriptions of him, both physically and personality wise.

I knew it couldn't be a shared illusion either, considering that Tommy and Gina were from completely different schools from completely different sides of town, therefore, neither one would've known of the other. Especially if Gina was telling me the truth when she told me that she was the only one she knew of who could actually see Mr. Needle-nose. So then, how're both stories so consistent with each other?

"Gina, let me ask you something, I know you and he are "Bestest friends" and all, but has Mr. Needle-nose ever done anything to hurt you?"

"No."

"What about anyone else? What about the other kids, do you know if he's ever tried to hurt them?"

"I... I... I don't think so." Her face grew more and more nervous by the second. She was on the verge of shutting down completely, I could tell.

"What about candy land, is it fun there?" She nodded. "What do you like to do there?"

"Well, me and the animals there like to run around and eat all the lollipops from the lolly forest."

"That *does* sound like fun." I said enthusiastically. "What kind of animals are there?"

"All different kinds. Bunny rabbits, Koalas, and even a couple of monkeys."

"That sounds exciting."

"Yeah, and I sometimes like to swing on the Twizzler vines with the monkeys."

"I'll bet you wish you could stay there forever, don't you? Heck, I wish *I* could do that."

"Well, sort of. I do like coming back to see my mommy and daddy, though."

"Oh, of course. If I may ask, how long do you think you would stay there, in candy land?" She frowned and stroked her chin.

"I don't really know."

"A couple hours, maybe days, you think?"

"Maybe. I can't really tell time there."

"I see. So when you come back, when Mr. Needle-nose comes to get you again, where do you wake up?"

"It's different each time."

"How so?"

"Well, sometimes it's in the car, other times I wake up in my bed at home, and sometimes it's at school."

"Hm, and does anyone say anything to you?" She shook her head. "Do you remember anything when you wake up?"

"I remember what I did in candy land."

"What about what you were doing before Mr. Needle-nose took you to candy land. Do you usually remember anything about that?"

"Sometimes, but it's hard for me to remember that."

"Okay. Now Gina, I wanna ask you something and I need you to be honest with me." She looked curiously at me, her eyes wide and leaning forward. "Are you afraid of Mr. Needle-nose?" For a moment, she just kept staring at me.

Eventually, her eyes fell to the floor and I could see her body start quivering again. "It's okay, you can tell me, I'm here to--"

"To *what?!"* she barked in a voice that was all of a sudden dripping with venom. "What are you here to do, *Doctor?* To take my friend away from me?!"

"Gina, I--"

"*Gina, I,"* she mocked, "You what? You thought you would split us apart?! You thought you were gonna take my bestest friend away from me?!"

"Calm down, Gina, please, I only asked a question."

"*FUCK YOU!*" she screamed, making my heart cut flips in my chest. Her eyes were fixed on me again, now bulging and enraged, looking like a deranged ape. "If you think you're gonna split us apart like last time, you can go straight to Hell, you pompous little cocksucker!"

I slowly stood up, looking to inch my way to the door. "What's wrong, Doctor?" she asked, tilting her head to the side with a sweet smile stretching on her face like it had the last time. "You see something scary?" She stood up then and began walking toward me. "Maybe I should ask *you*, Doctor, if you're afraid."

She giggled and added, "You should be."

"Wh-Who are you?" I asked, shaking. From the corner of my right eye, I saw the handle of the door being only inches away and began trying to reach for it without her noticing.

"I'm every kid's bestest friend. I'm the one that's always there when no one else is. I make them feel loved and give them a place to be happy while *you* take it away!"

"Them?" My heartrate was spiking now. "Who?" Gina was two steps away from me when I saw her grab one of the colored pencils and lunged at me. I quickly grabbed the door handle and threw it open, trying to bolt from the office when I felt a sharp pain erupt from my lower thigh. I fell to the floor when I then felt Gina's feet jump on top of my back. I cried out in pain, alerting Walter, who ran to the hallway to see what was going on.

I looked up, groaning, to see him standing in the hallway with his jaw hanging to the floor. I wheezed, "Go! Call the police, *now-- Aaugh!"* Another sharp pain was sent shooting through my back. I could feel her hammer against the back of the pencil, driving it further and further in. I could almost swear it hit bone!

Finally, she ripped it from my back and was about to take off down the hallway, presumably for Walter, when I managed to snag her ankle, causing her to trip. This did absolutely little to slow her down though as she immediately began stabbing my hand while shrieking like a demented banshee. "You little spit-fuck, let me go!" she screamed. My grip was beginning to loosen, my hand now bleeding profusely.

*God, Walter, PLEASE tell me you've got the police on their way!*

Sure enough, my hopes were confirmed when, only about a minute and a half, two minutes later, I heard the sirens pulling into the parking lot again. By that point, I'd long since had to let go of Gina's ankle and she'd made it out to the lobby. I could hear her battering against the door to the reception office, shrieking to "Let me in, right now!" I heard the police enter the lobby, followed by sounds of shouting to "Stand still!" and "Drop the pencil!" I didn't see any of it, still being left facedown in pain on the floor of the hallway.

Eventually, I looked up when I heard the footsteps of one of the officers approaching. "Sir, are you okay?" I heard him ask. I groaned. "Can you stand?" I tried pushing myself up, only to feel the pain in my back worsen, causing me to fall again. I heard him then radio for an ambulance. In the background, I heard Gina shrieking, "GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME, YOU FILTHY FUCKING SLIMES! FUCKING PIGS!" This was then followed by shouted gibberish in what I could only assume was German.

*What the hell?* I thought. Aside from the pain, which was borderline unbearable, this stuck out to me. Though I couldn't speak any of it myself, I was sure from the pronunciation and the phrasing of the speech itself that it was German. Thing is, how in the hell could she speak it, and do so seemingly fluently. It'd be one thing if maybe she was bilingual or maybe taking a foreign language class or something, but I knew otherwise. As far as I knew, she would've only known English.

I could hear her trail off as she was being taken outside by the officers. About two or three minutes after that, I heard the ambulance come into the lobby and down the hall. There, I was lifted onto a stretcher and carried out of the building.

Things got a bit hazy after that. Most of the immediate aftermath of the incident for me was spent in the hospital. Ironically, it would be the same hospital they took Tommy to. How fitting.

While I was there, I caught the media coverage of the incident. Gina, obviously being a minor, and given the questionability of her mental condition at the time, was sentenced to a minimum of six months in a children's psychiatric hospital. Her parents spoke on camera, too, although not to rail on me, but instead to express just how shocked and scared they were for their daughter's condition. That was the last I'd heard about Gina or her parents, though I think she might be improving.

It's because of what happened next that I say this. That was the last I'd hear of or from Gina, but not [Mr. Needle-nose](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zonoci/the_haunting_case_of_mr_needlenose_the_boy_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). And from what I found out, he clearly had no problem ditching Gina in only a relatively short time frame.
