Part 4

I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building we found a secret room! And guess what was in it? More books! I even found a journal from Sean. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.


I hated living in New Brunswick. I was 20, it was 2014.

After I dropped out of college I got a full time job. First at one call center, and then the next. I found one I liked and stuck with it until I got a tech support role.

Once a week I played DnD with my friends and it was one of those days. We were playing DnD and he had someone new in our party, Jon.

Jon had a really good job, and always talked about how he sued a guy so bad because he hit his car with a garbage truck while he was in it. Back injuries, he apparently ruined the guy for it, and boy did he like to talk about it.

He was playing with us and he was arguing with the DM  about the rules constantly. It was like watching two evil wizards duking it out.

"The skeleton dragon can't fly without wings!" Jon laughed. "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" and he rolled a d20, getting a 12.

"You fool! He is flying with magic!" The DM bellowed rolling a d20, getting a 13.

"The dragon didn't cast a spell yet, or activate a spell like ability, thats not fair and your a terrible DM with unfair, lazy and obscene house rules." Jon laughed, rolling a 20 on the D20.

The DM was insulted. He looked like he was about to cry. "Why are you doing this to me!" The DM rolled a 1 on the D20

Jon looked around the room at all 12 of us then spoke. "This is the biggest DND party you've ever had right? You curse people dumb enough to play DnD and think becaue you always play as the DM you can get away with it. But I'm the DM killer around these parts and you were about to end someone in this room. I prevented it and used you as my sacrificial lamb. Just know that when I drop my sword of damaclese it was placed here." He rolled the D20 twice, getting 20 both times.


. "This is the biggest DnD group I've ever had and your slaughtering me here? Why? I thought you were my friend?!!?" The DM looked around the room in fear. "I thought I was the biggest fish in the sea. Clearly we need to make an agreement."


Jon cackled. "Oh no your already done. I already ended you and I'll never play DND with you again. This is the biggest party you will ever have too. I just gets worse from this point, and when I drop my sword your done. I just want to inform everyone here that if this guy ever ruins you without killing you because your playing his game, you know who to call." With that Jon left the kin center we were at and I never saw him again.

The game ended after that and almost everyone left. There were 4 of us who stayed the night and only 3 couches. We were at a recreation center we pretended to volunteer at. IT was a great place to play DND.

The DM slept on a pool table and I took one of the couches. Everyone fell asleep almost immediately except me.


I couldn't sleep and looked around the club room. There were so many pictures and it creeped me out. There was 22 club president photos and counting, lots of old world wars propaganda. Even some stuff from the civil war. The only face that seemed friendly in this whole room was able lincoln.

I was getting scared and loooked at the others asleep. I then started hallucinating. There were angels with black halos inviting me in a door for a tea party.

One of them came over and introduced himself as Samiaza the leader of the watchers.

"We're not bad dues, he said with authority." He pointed around the room at the sleeping fellows.

"Yeah those guys our hanging out with in the 9th layer of hell, we ain't any more evil than them! So why don't you come on in!" He said with a wink.

I entered the door and the hallucination intesified. We were in a grotto, and it was very well decorated.

One of the angels pored tea from a pot, and then topped it with what looked like frothed milk. He put sprinkes on it and placed it at a table where I sat.

Samiaza spoke from across the table. "We looked through your head and decided strawberry banana. IT's all simulated you know, we live in a cave, everything is made from mushrooms. But once you really understand the fungus you can do wonderful things with it."

I sipped the delicious strawberry banana tea "What do you want from me?" I asked.

Samiaza smiled through his hooded cloak. I noticed he was one of the only watchers with 4 wings. Most had only 2 like that beautiful angel woman I had also hallucinated.

"I want you to redeem me child, and for that you must survive" he said. He took out a paper and looked at me.

He spoke with anger and intent. "I don't want you playing any more fucking videogames, watching any fucking movies, or anything like that. I don't expect you to listen 100% but I expect you to at least try. You have a few swords of damaclese that we need to go over so you don't die. You better take this warning with at least 75% seriousness or you will. WE will start with the uncharted games. You got cursed and negated on uncharted 1 and 2 but if you get cursed by uncharted 3 it's going to kill you and there's nothing I can do to stop it."


I  was terrified. I had played so much uncharted it wasn't funny. The 3rd game I had only finished once and I hated afterwards. I wondered how bad the sword of damaclese would be.

"Whats going to happen to me?" I asked, frightened.


"You'll live through that, but don't EVER do anything completeionist in a videogame again. It's how they really get you. They are not all evil curses but this is the point where you can't tell anymore. Yeah you'll live through uncharted 1 and 2 finding all the treases activates a curse and getting the platinum makes it so it doesn't get you. But the uncharted 3 platinum is basically impossible to get, so don't ever find all the treasures in that one. And that's the thing, videogame reviewers don't completionist games to see if they are safe, if they think they are, they stop and give it a bad score. But that gamer gate thing is about more than feminism. IT's about giving extremely cursed games really good scores. So you can't keep going because you do not know what is safe anymore. I'm telling you some of these later curses will be so incredibly bad it would blow your fucking mind." Samiaza talked, sipping his tea.


I looked around the room in terror. I felt swords of ddamaclese hovering over my head, and I just knew they were about to drop.


Samiaza saw my struggle and said. "At least you checked out of kingdom hearts and the MCU, those were the ones that were going to go for all 7 chakuras eventually."

Just then I was back to the club room. I looked around at my friend and through the door into the meeting room.

Just then the door started moving around, the top half writhed with the bottom stayed stationary.

The door stopped moving and it then went to another world. Red purple metal me stood starring back at me through the door. I could see him clearly this time, not like last time in the dark. He was disshapen in terrifying way. I hoped he wasn't as scary as he looked.

He ran through the door and dissapeared as he reached the frame.

I was terrified and didn't know what to do. I for sure couldn't sleep now.

I went out the back door and sat there with a cigarette, smoking and looking into the night. IT was the end of summer and it warm. I stood on the metal thing that lead up to the club room on the second floor and felt in a trance.

Suddenly I felt a chill go down my spine and a purple light shone on me from above. I thought it must be a plying saucer.

"Don't look up" I heard Nathan drake say.

I didn't and went back inside, terrified for my life.

I then got more scarred when I saw that the sleeping DM was now a red purple metal person. The two others were not.

I didn't know if should head to my car outside and risk abduction or stay here waiting for the red purple metal person to wake up.

I decided to make a break for my car, leaving out the other entrance. As soon as I walked through the door to outside a golden light shone on me from above. 

I heard Sully from uncharted say "Don't look up kid, or they'll get you."

I walked back inside immediately and went back to the room where the others were.

The DM was still red purple metal and so was one of the other dudes on the couch.

I got my stuff that I had forgotten about until now and made a break for the car.

When I was outside I saw a red purple metal person starring at me from down the road. He starred and watched me as I drove by. I was driving back to my parents house where I still lived when I saw a transport truck barreling down the road at about 150kph. I t drove by as I was parked at a red light.

It didn't even slow down as it passed through the intersection in the lane over. I was terrified when I got back home.

A few days later we were at the lake for some family get together. I hated it here and felt I had missed so many opportunities getting dragged here every weekend when I was young. 

Everyone was sitting around drinking and auntie die spoke from afar, with my acute hearing I could hear them a mile away though.

"Oh Carl was never the same after they pulled his teeth out. I told him to use anesthetic but he said he wanted to know how Deb's kids felt. I he knew that wasn't really one of the things that bothered them but still." Auntie die said.

Deb laughed. "Just pull em, he said after they did the first one. I wish I could have been there to see it. I knew we would kill him inside, I just didn't know he'd do it to himself."

I ate the orderves and wondered to myself about my creepy family, how much not good ere these people really up to?



I am a monk who lives at a monastery in rural tennessee. I wrote the preceding story when a a Samiaza told me that if I did not, that I would be sent to the lake of fire. I have written this here so please God have mercy on my soul!
