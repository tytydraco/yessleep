Hello everyone, I want to tell you about the creepy encounter I had just yesterday, Christmas 2024. I'm still uneasy about what happened, but I don't know where else to post this and I just have to get this off my chest.

For context, my (M17) parents, my brother, and I recently moved to a beautiful farm in the Dutch countryside, not far from the Belgian border. The farm has been in my family for generations. It used to be a mink farm run by my grandfather, but the actual farm has long been abandoned and fallen into disrepair. As you can imagine this used to be the perfect place for a little kid to play, I always pretended the world had ended and I had set up a camp in an abandoned farm. I truly have great memories here, but I'm not sure I will ever be able to feel at ease here again.

Now, about last night. We had just finished our Christmas meal my mom had spent all day preparing. After dinner, I was told to walk the dog, but I didn't mind, I love walking through the empty fields at night and just staring at the stars. So, I went outside and walked to the old mink farm to get my boots. I've never really felt comfortable here, because my boots are stored in the abandoned house my mother grew up in. It's a truly unsettling place, perfect for a horror movie. It's an old run-down house, with a run-down and dirty interior. Since it’s been repurposed as a shed it also half looks like a murder dungeon from the Saw franchise. As a kid, I never dared enter the old house, let alone at night. Now that I'm older I'm not that afraid anymore, at least I wasn't, until last night.

As I grabbed my boots I was already feeling uneasy, like something was watching me from the shadows of the room, but I brushed it off. After I collected my boots I passed the gate and went into the field. I untethered my dog as she just loves running amok in the fields, but her collar does have a light so that I am still able to see her in the dark.

At first, things were normal. Everything was peaceful and quiet like usual, but I just couldn't shake the feeling I was being watched, it made me extremely uneasy. Just as I finally felt at ease I heard a sound coming from the treeline. Startled, I quickly grabbed my flashlight and shone it across the tree line. I could swear I saw something, some kind of shadow looking at me, but as I shone my flashlight I couldn't see anything. After this encounter, I just wanted to go back inside and play board games with my family, but right as I wanted to leave my dog smelled something and ran away. I kept calling her name, but she just wouldn't listen. I could see my dog was carrying something in her mouth, but every time I got close she growled and ran away.

After what must have been fifteen minutes of chasing my dog, I was finally able to get her to come back to me after bribing her with a treat. I snatched the mysterious item from the ground and as I looked I saw it was the skull of a small animal. Strange, I thought, but I assumed it must have been caught by a ferret or a bird. As I looked up I saw the shadow again, it was standing on the other side of the field. Startled, I once again shone my flashlight at it. This time it didn't disappear, but I couldn't make out any details, although it looked vaguely humanoid, it looked tall and thin, but like it didn’t have a face. It was like the beam of my flashlight disappeared as it reached to shadow figure.

My dog saw it too and started to bark. Suddenly my dog ran after the shadow, and once again she wouldn't listen to my commands. When my dog reached the figure, she let out a loud cry and quickly limped back. Now I was truly terrified, I grabbed my dog and ran out of the fields. I didn't even go back to the old house to stow away my boots, I just ran for my home. When I got inside I just pretended everything was normal, and I went back to playing board games with my family.

When I went to bed, I had forgotten all about my creepy encounter and just went to sleep. Then, out of nowhere, I heard a knock on my bedroom window. Suddenly I remembered my encounter and just hid under my sheets, hoping the knocking would stop. It was a slow deliberate knock, with exactly one second between each knock. At this moment the dog began barking and the knocking stopped. I slept on the first floor, I told myself it must have been the wind, or some branches must have hit my window, but inside I knew the wind couldn’t make such a noise.

Then I heard the backdoor open, and a few moments later my dog started to whimper in pain again. Quickly I got up from my bed and locked the door to my bedroom. I heard footsteps walking up the stairs, and getting ever closer to my door. I turned on the lights and saw my door handle move, something was trying to open my door. I quickly got back in my bed and hid under the sheets once more. I was trembling, my heart was racing and I felt as though the door could break down at any moment. The knocking got louder and louder, after a few minutes it was almost like he was attempting to break the door down. After a few minutes of trying to open the door, the sound stopped. I was terrified, but at some point in the night, I still managed to fall asleep.

This morning after I woke up I immediately ran downstairs and checked on my dog. Luckily she was okay, but she was shaking and very scared and tame. It was late, almost ten in the morning, and my parents had already left to visit my grandma.  Later, when I had to walk the dog again, she wouldn’t leave her cage and kept pushing back and trying to go home. When I finally got back, she immediately ran back to her cage and refused to leave, even growling if I got too close. Now, I keep the doors locked, and I still have a feeling that the entity is watching me.

I don't know what to do, what if this thing comes back? Do I tell my parents about what happened? Please help me!
