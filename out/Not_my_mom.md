This story is real and happened to me a few years ago. It is important to note that I suffer from recurring sleep paralysis as well as prior and subsequent sleep hallucinations. These rarely happen now, but there were times when they were more frequent.

That day, when I woke up, I was changing my position from facing the wall to facing the middle of my room. I thought that I had simply woken up in the middle of the night from a bad dream, so I wanted to go back to sleep without thinking too much about what had happened. Thinking too much about your nightmares is never a good idea.

But the closer I got to falling asleep, the stranger I started to feel. My body started to feel tense instead of lighter as it's supposed to be.

Suddenly, I heard my parents' bedroom door opening and started hearing footsteps, very slow but heavy, approaching my door. Once the footsteps were right at my door to my room, there was silence for about 10-20 seconds, followed by a knocking. Immediately after the knocking, I started to feel very uneasy, and my heart started to race. I just knew something was wrong and not right at all. After the knocking, I heard a voice that sounded like my mom calling out my name and asking me if I was asleep... At that moment, I knew that whatever that thing was, it was not my mom, and I started to slowly panic, my heart pounding even harder.

I quickly hid under my blanket, closed my eyes, and pretended to be asleep. Right after that, the door to my room opened, and I could hear that thing walking into my room. Then it just stopped again, followed by silence for another 10 seconds. "Are you asleep?" it asked again in my mom's voice, now standing right in front of my bed. At this point, I was scared beyond anything and thought if that thing didn't kill me, my heart would... I was trying so hard not to make any noise or to hide my fast breathing and heartbeat.

Thankfully, whatever that thing was, it left my room the same way it walked in, but it left my door open. I took a peek under my blanket when I heard the footsteps disappear from my room and saw that a red light was shining from the corridor outside my room. So I just stayed there under my blanket for a few more minutes when suddenly I felt like waking up. But it wasn't really like waking up because I was already awake. I don't know how to explain this feeling; it's like your brain turning off the hallucination switch, and everything turns to normal.

Except when I did 'wake up,' my door was still open. When I woke my mom up in the middle of the night to ask her if she had gone into my room, she responded with an obvious no and was annoyed at me for waking her up. That night, I stayed awake the whole day, doing nothing but having all the lights in my room on and watching comedy movies just to forget what had happened.
