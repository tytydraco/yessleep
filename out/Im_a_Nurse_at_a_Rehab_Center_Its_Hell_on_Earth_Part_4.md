After Sinclair’s announcement to the nurses, an entire month went by. And in that amount of time, 14 patients committed suicide. And as a result, 14 nurses were consumed by Sinclair’s shadow. My already busy schedule ballooned completely as I had to take on more work to cover the patients left behind by the eaten nurses. I finished every day exhausted and drained. It felt like as soon my head touched my pillow it was already time to begin my shift. 



But despite the hellish month, there was one bright spot. And that was Todd. No matter how busy I was, I delivered him food and sat with him when our outside times matched up. We would joke with each other and he would keep me updated on certain patients that were the most likely next to commit suicide. He also continued to get me small gifts. More scrunchies, cute little stickers I could use to cheer myself up, and even one time an energy drink. 



“How do you even get this stuff?” I asked him one day as we sat together on the benches in the garden. Other patients milled about, a few new ones had been brought in and they were still going through detox. The heroin addicts especially needed my attention since they could barely function while going through their withdrawals. It was one situation in which the strange black pills that Sombra use are actually useful. Only taking one a day is more than enough to combat the symptoms of withdrawal and detox. Any more than one a day and you risked turning into a husk. 



“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Todd answered me, nudging my shoulder with his and giving a little giggle as he sat back on the bench. I pouted at his vague answer but I supposed that he was entitled to some secrets. 



“Well, thank you regardless. Without you, I don’t think I could get through a day of working here.” I sighed. I felt exhausted and completely drained. Being a nurse is already not an easy job. Coupled with these working conditions? And I was starting to feel as tired as Sinclair looked. 



“I’m sure you would. You’re a tough girl, Red,” he said as he fiddled around with his empty juice box. “I bet you could 1v1 Nurse Whore and win.” He giggled again and I joined him. It certainly would be cathartic to beat the absolute shit out of Nurse Taylor. If I could I’d grab one of the metal trays we serve the food on and smack her across the face with it. 



“If that ever happens, I’ll be sure to do it in front of your room. Get you some entertainment.” I smiled at him. I looked down at my watch and sighed. It was already time to get back to my shift. I looked over at Todd and noticed that he was busy looking off into space. In the moment I leaned in and kissed him on the cheek. 



“Wha-?” He turned his face quickly to look at me. His pale gaunt face went red with embarrassment and I couldn’t help but smile and this time, peck him on the lips. It was only a quick one, but it felt like I was instantly reignited.



“As thanks for keeping me sane.” I quickly stood up and shuffled away. My face felt like it was on fire and I was sure that it was probably as red as Todd’s had been. I spared a glance back at him and he had his face hidden behind his hands and I could hear soft groaning coming from behind them. I smiled again and quickly dipped inside of Sombra. And returned to my duty as a nurse. 



As I went about my duties of making the beds and administering medicine, in a much kinder way than Nurse Taylor had shown me, I was walking down one of Sombra’s millions of hallways when I suddenly caught the whiff of smoke. For a quick second, I thought that maybe there was a fire somewhere. As I walked down the hall in search of the source, I heard voices. One of them was undoubtedly Sinclair. I quickly slammed myself against the wall and carefully tiptoed my way closer to the room that he was in. 



“How can you smoke this?” An unknown voice asked. It sounded, hollow and empty. I got close enough to be by the door, and against my better judgment I carefully stuck my head into the room. It was a vacant patient’s room and in there, smoking cigars, was Sinclair and Spencer. “It feels like I’m smoking a campfire log,” Spencer complained as he smoked one of Sinclair’s cigars. 



“I assure you, it’s far better than those noxious cigarettes you smoke.” Sinclair was sitting in a chair against the wall, enjoying his cigar. Spencer had his back to me with his hood down and puffs of smoke emerging from him as he sputtered and coughed. 



“At least mine can taste like mint.” Spencer huffed as he took a few more puffs of the cigar. He took a seat on the bed and as he turned to do so I quickly had to cover my mouth and pull my head back out into the hallway. 



Spener’s entire lower face had no skin or muscles to speak of. And the hand that was holding the cigar up to his face was completely devoid of skin as well. He was almost completely skeletal. And yet, he was completely fine. He was talking, smoking, and seemed to not have a care in the world. 



“So, how is the project I asked you to work on?” Sinclair asked. This got my attention, and despite how freaky Spencer looked, my curiosity pulled my head back to peek into their room. “I didn’t just call you here to smoke with me and inject my patients with more of your drugs.” Sinclair exhaled smoke from his nose and waited for Spencer to answer. The partially skeletonized man gave up on his cigar and crushed it against the stone walls of the room. 



“Well, I can be ready for an actual test in a few days. The samples you provided me with decay incredibly quickly so I’ll require more if we are to do an actual test.” Spencer explained, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a box of cigarettes. 



“It won’t be easy. Its already annoyed that we’re even doing these tests, to begin with. Feels like I’m going to replace it.” Sinclair sighed, leaning back against the chair and suddenly taking notice of me. “What do you want, woman?” He scared me by how suddenly he saw me spying on him. 



Caught completely off guard I had to make up the most convincing lie I could think of. “Nurse Taylor sent me to see if there’s anything you might need, sir.” I held my breath waiting for his response. And whether or not I was about to be consumed by his shadow. But to my relief, he just let out an annoyed sigh and waved me away, 



“We don’t need anything. Go and try to make yourself useful somewhere else.” I nodded, quickly. I looked over to Spencer to see if he would react in any way to my seeing him like this. But he simply nodded at me and went back to smacking his box of cigarettes against his skeleton hand. I made sure not to stay my welcome and quickly went about my business, with Sinclair’s words in the back of my head as I walked away. 



The rest of my day was uneventful, besides breaking up a fight in the rec room over a stolen jigsaw puzzle piece. After the two were separated and the puzzle piece was returned, I was finally allowed to clock out for the day and return to my room. As I scanned my ID to enter the employee-only section and began walking past the kitchen area, I heard a few nurses gossiping about Spencer as I walked passed them. 



“I swear, every time he comes to visit, this place just gets so much worse.” One of the older nurses shook her head and nursed her cup of black coffee. “I remember the first time Mr. Sinclair brought him here. That was when the pills showed up, and the patients started turning into Zombies.” She sighed and shook her head. 



So I wasn’t just standing there awkwardly, I decided to enter the kitchen area and just went to the vending machine. Pretending like I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop on the conversation going on just a few feet away from me. 



“I swear I saw him injecting one of my patients with a syringe. Next day? The whole room was quarantined. When I asked Mr. Sinclair about it? I was told to mind my own business and get back to work.” Another nurse tsked and finished the microwaved meal she had been eating. I made sure to pretend like I was trying to decide what I wanted to get from the vending machine. 



“If this keeps up, I don’t know how much longer I can keep my sanity here,” The first nurse said again, her hands visibly shaking as she struggled to hold her mug to her mouth. Before any other nurse could speak up, they all quickly shot at attention when the door to the employee-only section opened and Nurse Taylor entered with a scowl. 



“What the fuck are you all doing standing around?! Do you want another one of us to get eaten?! Go do your jobs! NOW!!!” She screamed, and all of the nurses quickly tossed their dishes in the sink and their uneaten food in the trash before shuffling away and out into Sombra’s halls. “You! Didn’t you hear-” She started to yell at me before she noticed who I was. “Oh, Cassie! I’m so sorry you just finished your shift didn’t you?” 



“Y-yes ma’am.” I nodded, quickly just ordering a chocolate bar and waiting for the machine to spit it out for me. Taylor nodded and I noticed just how disheveled she looked. It seemed as if she also wasn’t exempt from the rules Sinclair had in place. The vending machine finally finished dispensing my chocolate bar and I quickly bent down to pick it up.



“You know, Cassie? Word is you’ve grown quite attached to a patient.” My body tensed up as I grabbed the chocolate bar and nearly crushed it. I looked over at her and saw that she had the biggest shit-eating grin I’ve ever seen. 



“Me? No ma’am. I’m just doing my job. That’s all,” I told her, quickly taking the chocolate bar and walking over to her. She blocked my way from exiting and looked at me for a good long while. I stared back at her and did my best to keep my face as neutral as possible. 



“Hmm, must just be some gossip. You know how we nurses are,” she said with a smile, patting me on the head and exiting back out into the hallways of Sombra. I released a breath I didn’t even know I was holding in, before quickly running to my room and slamming the door behind me. 



As I slammed my back against my door and slid down to the floor, I heard a sudden shriek. Looking around quickly, thinking that maybe I had rushed into the wrong room, I saw that nobody was there. That was until I lowered my eyes to the floor and noticed a yellow stick note on the ground. Sitting there with a crayon, was a small bug-like creature. It was no more than five inches tall and had on a little hoodie and little sweatpants. It looked almost like a little toy doll. 



“Uh…hi?” I told it, completely confused as to how this thing had entered my room and what it was doing. It suddenly burst into tears. Now that completely shocked me, and I quickly looked away from it, trying to find something in my room that might appease it. As I did so, my eyes fell upon my mirror with the doodler’s drawings sticking to it. It suddenly clicked in my head. 



“Are you…the doodler?” I asked it, hoping that it understood me. The only answer I got was more crying when I stared at it, and a sudden hiss from it. It spitted at me, but the spit barely traveled past the sticky note it was drawing on before landing on the floor and releasing a sizzle once it did land. 



“Is…that a yes?” I asked it, only to get it crying more, the more I looked at it. It was almost like it didn’t like being perceived. Taking the hint I covered my face and eyes with my hands. The crying suddenly stopped. And I heard what sounded like a crayon scribbling. After a few more moments I heard what sounded like a fly buzzing. I moved my hands away just in time to see the doodler fly away with its crayon and over to a crack in my wall, before quickly scurrying into it and disappearing. 



“So it’s…a doodlebug?” I asked myself, as I walked over and picked up the sticky note that the doodlebug had left for me. It sent a chill down my spine as I stared at it. It was a figure scratched into the sticky note. It almost resembled the doodle that it did for Sinclair’s shadow. I went over and grabbed that doodle off of my mirror and compared the two. Immediately it was evident that it was two different creatures. 



“I have to show Todd this.” I quickly stuck the two notes into my pocket and left my room. Walking down the halls toward Todd’s room, my head was spinning with so many questions. What was Sinclair’s goal here? What was Spencer’s role? What the hell was that doodlebug? All these questions were in my head as I knocked on Todd’s door and waited for him. 



He opened the door and immediately I could tell he was excited to see me. I quickly entered his room and he closed the door behind him. “You will not believe what I just saw,” I started to tell him before he suddenly presented me with a small red rose. 



“It reminds me of your hair.” He said awkwardly as he handed the rose over to me. I stared at it for a second before accepting the rose from him. “I hope you like it. It cost me a whole pack of cigarettes.” He chuckled trying to play it off, but I could tell he was shy and awkward. 



“Thank you so much, Todd.” I smiled, held the rose to my nose, and took a small sniff of it. It didn’t smell like much, but in this muted and corporate atmosphere, this small rose meant so much to me. I looked up at him with a smile, before I dropped the rose to the floor and felt my heart drop. Constantine Sinclair was standing behind him, with his shadow hanging over his shoulder and smiling at me. 



“Oh, Todd! It’s time for your treatment! You’ve been selected for a groundbreaking new procedure!” Nurse Taylor said as she opened the door to Todd’s room. Todd quickly looked back behind him to see what I had been staring at, and then over toward Taylor. He was about to run for it when Sinclair’s shadow reached out and grabbed him by the throat. 



“N-no!” I screamed out, reaching towards Todd. Sinclair stared daggers at me and sneered at me like I was a cockroach. “Let him go!” I shouted at Sinclair, running at him and getting ready to tear him to shreds before I was grabbed from behind by two orderlies who had followed Nurse Taylor into the room. 



“I knew you had something for a patient. But to think that it was Todd, of all people?” Taylor giggled, obviously enjoying both of our sufferings. Todd struggled against Sinclair’s shadow, but any time he tried to grab its arm and pry it off his throat his hands just slipped off of the goopy creature. 



“Nurse Cassandra. I don’t believe that I have to remind you that, nurses and patients are prohibited from being in a relationship.” Sinclair scolded me. He sighed in annoyance and rubbed his tired eyes. “I suppose I’ll have to make an example out of the two of you.” He lowered his hand and stared at me. “Release her and take him,” he ordered. His shadow gurgled and tossed Todd to the floor. Before he could stand back up, he was grabbed by the orderlies after they had let go of me. 



Before I could say or do anything, Nurse Taylor quickly walked over and motioned for me to follow as Todd was dragged out of his room kicking and shouting. “I’d recommend you come quietly. Mr. Sinclair’s patience is already razor-thin as it is.” She smiled and grabbed me by my wrist. I quickly yanked my hand away from her and went to smack her. Before I could though she punched me in the stomach, sending me to the floor and gagging. 



“Both of you. Leave your stupid womanly conflicts till after the procedure,” Sinclair ordered, causing Taylor to quickly stand at attention and nod at him. I gagged a few more times and coughed before standing up and weakly following after the duo. Todd kicked and screamed more as he was carried by the orderlies down the halls and toward the therapy room. 



I hoped that it would only be another round of electro-shock therapy. As painful as it would be, Todd could handle that. But as we entered the therapy room, I was horrified to find Spencer sitting on the table waiting for us. 



“About time. I was about to take a nap.” Spencer leaped off the table and dusted it off. The orderlies carried Todd to the table and quickly tied him down to it. He continued to thrash around and shout every swear he knew at them. “I can’t exactly do my job if he’s acting like this.” Spencer pulled his face mask back over his bony lower face and looked over at us. 



“Nurse Cassandra. You’ll hold the patient down. As punishment for breaking your contract, you’ll have to see what happens firsthand.” Sinclair ordered, his shadow peeking over his shoulder and staring at me with its bright white eyes. I looked over at Todd and wanted nothing more than to take his place on that table. “I am not going to ask you twice, woman.” I looked at Sinclair again, before walking over to Todd and holding his arms down on the table. 



“I’m so sorry…” I told him as I felt tears welling up in my eyes. I held him down, and he looked up at me with terror in his eyes. I had to look away from him so that I didn’t burst into tears right then and there. 



“Get on with it.” Sinclair crossed his arms as he looked over at Taylor and Spencer. The two nodded and Taylor also donned her face mask to cover her mouth. She walked to a nearby prep station, washed her hands thoroughly, and walked back over with a scalpel in her hand. 



“Orderlies? Assist Nurse Cassandra,” she ordered, the mute orderlies nodding and taking my place by holding Todd’s arms down. “Would you be so kind as to hold his head still, Cassie?” she asked me. I looked down at Todd and instantly got a horrible feeling in my heart. 



“W-what about anesthesia?” I asked feebly, to which she giggled underneath her mask, and motioned with her scalpel for me to get on with it. I looked down at Todd and he looked up at me. His eyes were filled with terror and tears began to well in his eyes as well. I grabbed his head and softly rubbed his cheeks before holding it still. 



“There’s a good girl,” Taylor said as she approached me turned her scalpel down to Todd’s head, and sliced a deep cut into his forehead. Todd thrashed and screamed and I had to do my best to hold his head still. Both to comply with my orders and to hopefully stop him from getting more hurt. “Spencer? Saw, please.” She looked over at Spencer, who quickly produced a bone saw for her. 



“C-Cassie…please help…” Todd cried out as Taylor whirred the saw to life. I had to shut my eyes and squeeze his head as Taylor cut into his skull. The fact Todd didn’t pass out from the pain alone is extraordinary, but I truly wish that he could’ve. After Taylor had cut into his skull, she removed the bone fragments, and I opened my eyes to see that a section of Todd’s brain was exposed. 



“Alrighty, I’m up.” Spencer declared. Reaching into his hoodie pocket and producing a syringe with a deep black liquid swirling around inside of it. Spencer leaned down and stuck the needle into Todd’s brain, before pressing down on the plunger and injecting Todd with it. I had let Todd’s head go and was now back to holding his arms at the orderlies backed away.



“Cassie…help…” Todd choked out as he cried uncontrollably. As he did so his tears began to change into black goop like liquid. The same that Sinclair’s shadow was made out of. As soon as Spencer had injected the entire syringe, Todd let out an agonizing scream as more of the liquid began to leak out of his eyes and now out of his mouth. He thrashed around and screamed as his body began to twist and crack. 



“That doesn’t seem normal.” Spencer backed up from Todd and put some distance between the two of them. Todd screamed in agony and I watched in horror as his hands began to twist and contort, his bones breaking and snapping as claws began to grow from his fingers. 



“RED…PLEASE!!!” Spencer screamed as his face began to turn black and his teeth began to fall out of his mouth, replaced by four long canines that descended from his face. I watched in horror and began to cry uncontrollably as I watched the only friend I had in Sombra begin to change before my eyes. 



“I’m so sorry Todd…” I cried out, tears flowing uncontrolled as I continued to hold Todd’s arms down. As I continued crying I suddenly felt a hard smack across my face. A smack so hard that it sent my glasses flying off of my face and towards God knows where. Letting go of Todd’s arms I held my stinging cheek and looked over at the culprit. 



“Stop your crying you stupid bitch,” Sinclair ordered of me. His shadow was staring at the whole spectacle with nothing but glee in its bright white eyes. Todd continued to thrash on the table as the blackness spread across his body, twisting and contorting him. It stretched his body out and broke countless bones. He thrashed so violently that the restraint holding him down to the table snapped off and he was able to roll off the table and land on the floor. 



“R…E…D.” He coughed out as he rolled around on the floor, screeching as large spikes emerged from his back, his arms breaking and growing longer. His face was completely swallowed by the black goop and now…he resembled Sinclair’s shadow. But he was far more terrifying. Even Nurse Taylor began to back up from Todd as he started to stand back up. Todd had gone from about 6 feet tall to almost 8 feet tall. But as he tried to stand straight up his spine snapped in the middle and forced him back down on all fours. 



“Todd…” I whimpered as I stared at the horrible creature he had become. It was like something from my worst nightmare, and here he was in front of me. The creature that was once Todd panted softly, gurgling like it was drowning with water in its lungs. It tried to take a few steps forward only for its legs to snap off at the ankles and remain where they were. But as it put them back on the floor, they simply regrew back. 



“Much less than ideal, I’m afraid. It doesn’t seem to have retained any intelligence.” Sinclair sighed as he reached into his suit pocket and pulled out a cigar from it. “I suppose we can run some tests on it.” He shrugged, placing the cigar in his mouth and his shadow quickly produced a match to light it. 



“R…E…D.” The Todd creature gurgled out, before letting out a loud screech and reaching out to bite the head off of one of the orderlies. I let out a scream as tears still streamed down my face. I backed away from the Todd creature as it devoured the orderlies completely. 



“Uh…Mr. Sinclair, sir? I-I believe we have…” Nurse Taylor couldn’t even finish her sentence before the Todd creature screeched out and sprinted towards the doors. The first few hiccups it had with walking were quickly forgotten as it ran as gracefully as a horse would. “A code red!” Taylor screamed as the Todd creature busted the door down and screeched out into the hallway. 



“I think we might need to run more tests.” Spencer shrugged as he scratched his brown hair in confusion over what had gone wrong. I dropped to my knees and stared down at the trail of black tar that Todd had left behind. 



“Todd…” Was all I managed to cry out as I heard him screeching and beginning to run rampage down the halls of Sombra. There was no telling what would happen now. And as I watched him rampage through the halls of Sombra, I couldn’t help but remember the drawing that the doodlebug had given me. Because Todd now looked exactly like it.
