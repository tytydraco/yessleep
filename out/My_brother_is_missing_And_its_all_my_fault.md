My brother is missing.

And it’s all my fault. 

I’ve been a coward my whole life, but he’s never treated me like one. He’s always had faith in me. That I could be something more. 

*That I could be brave.*

When we were kids, I was so afraid of the dark. Truth be told, I still am. He never teased me about it. In fact, he tried to help. I can remember it like yesterday. We’d sit in our room, he’d turn out the light, then get on the floor next to me. 

“See, it’s not so bad. You get used to it after a while.”

I wanted to believe him. I tried. I sat there, clutching my flashlight, fighting the urge to turn it on for as long as I could. 

I was okay, as long as he was with me. But then he’d leave and sooner or later I would cave. I’d hear a noise or see something in the corner of my eye. I’d turn on the flashlight, shining it frantically, expecting horrors that only a naïve kid’s imagination can concoct. 

Only to find nothing. 

I’d feel so disappointed in myself for giving in. I wished that even one time I’d find *something*. That my light would land on a monster with red eyes and jagged teeth, just to prove that my fear was warranted. 

Now I feel like such a fool- so selfish, for ever wanting that. 

I don’t know what made me the way that I am. Why I wasn’t born fearless, like my brother. 

Maybe it’s because I’ve always had him to lean on. Anytime I’ve ever been in trouble he’s been there, no questions asked. He’s never held it over me, or against me. And whenever I’d say thank you, or apologize for being like this, he’d shrug it off. He’d tell me:

“That’s what brothers are for.”

After all these years I thought I’d finally found a way to make it up to him. To give him something that could properly show him how grateful I am for all he’s done for me. 

When I won the contest, I was over the moon. A beautiful house in Evershade Valley? Fully furnished, all expenses paid.  It seemed too good to be true. And I wanted it so badly that I ignored all common sense. There were more red flags than you could count, but I closed my eyes to them all. 

We’d been talking about moving out for months, but the money just wasn’t there. Repairs to the van and upgrades to all our equipment had added up fast. Then I saw this contest in the paper. I filled out the form, sent it in, but didn’t put much hope into it. 

I never expected to *actually win*. 

A package showed up at the front door one day. The papers inside looked legit enough: a congratulations letter, deed to the house, a map with directions on how to get there. The keys were a little strange. Old fashioned, some interesting markings on them, but I figured they were just the kind you get for a fancy place like this. 

I wanted to surprise Mario, so I made up a story. I told him we had a job; a house had a busted pipe, it would be a bit of a drive. We loaded up the van and followed the map from the package. 

As soon as we crossed into Evershade Valley a chill ran down my spine like nothing I’d felt before. This wasn’t the picturesque place I’d imagined. It was a freakin’ nightmare. 

The trees were twisted and skeletal. It didn’t take long for the road to give way to a rugged path that was barely distinguishable from the dirt surrounding it. 

I think if I had been alone or thinking clearly, I would have turned around right away. I should have. But I *needed* this. And I was with Mario. What’s the worst that could happen?

Finally, we reached a clearing and there it was: the mansion, as promised. It really was something. Enormous and scary as all get out, sure, but beautiful in its way. 

I parked and Mario went straight to work unloading our gear. I figured I’d wait and surprise him with the good news once we got inside. 

 Before I could reach for the keys, the front door creaked open. We exchanged looks and I tried to laugh it off. 

“They uh…musta’ left it unlocked for us.”

There were candles lit sporadically inside. We searched the entryway for a light switch and that’s when things took a turn. 

I found a switch by a coat rack and when I reached to flip it – the entire thing disappeared. I blinked and swiped at the empty wall, unable to process what was happening. 

As I turned to ask Mario if he’d seen it, a gust of wind ripped through the mansion, blowing out all the candles. 

“Mario? Where are you?”

  
“Luigi! I can’t see a thing!”

I frantically reached for my flashlight, stashed in my work bag. 

An unfamiliar, low-pitched HUM was growing louder. I spun around, trying to find the source of the sound but couldn’t see an inch in front of me. It was too dark.

“Mario!”

“Luigi, just stay calm pal.”

“I can’t see you.”

I felt for the familiar metal of the flashlight in my bag and pulled it out. I pointed it in the direction I’d last heard Mario’s voice. 

*Why did I have to press that stupid button?* 

With one click, Mario’s face was illuminated. And behind him...

...were two red eyes and a row of jagged teeth twisted into a smile that will haunt me forever. 

The ghost CACKLED and my flashlight cut out. I smacked it, desperately pressing it off and on, until finally the light returned.

“Mario! Mario!” I called.

There was no use. 

*He was gone.*  

At this point I was hyperventilating, heart practically beating out of my chest. I pointed the light in every direction as if somehow, magically, it would bring him back as quickly as he disappeared. I was becoming increasingly disoriented as walls and stairwells disappeared and reappeared with each passing moment.

“MARIO!!!!”

Then the humming started up again. More hums. DOZENS of them. 

The eyes of countless ghosts appeared all around me. I didn’t want to leave. Not without my brother. But I was convinced if I stayed there a moment longer, I wouldn’t be any use to him- or to anyone, ever again. 

“Mario! I’ll come back for you! I promise! I WILL come back!”

I ran faster than I’ve ever ran before. Terrified that the door would disappear before I reached it. Miraculously, it opened, and I leapt for the van. 

I peeled out, having no idea how to get home but desperate to be anywhere else. Once I got far enough down the road, I caught my breath and reality set in. 

I left Mario. 

I left him in that horrific house. 

And what makes it even worse is knowing that he would never, not in a million years, do that to me. 

I can’t change that now. But I know my brother, and I know he’ll figure out a way to survive. And that means I still have a chance to make this right. 

A chance to find him. To get him out of there. 

*To show him that I can be brave.*
