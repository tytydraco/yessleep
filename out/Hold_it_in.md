Yesterday I had lunch with my friends.

We visited a new restaurant in my block, “The Brown House”. They have all kinds of brown dishes... I think it's their theme. They even have some dishes that shouldn't be brown, but somehow they made them brown. It feels a little strange to eat a brown pizza, but other than that, the food was good and the service was excellent, but something else was... uh...

OK, here's what happened.

We were sitting at the table after Jenny and I finished our meals. David was still eating, but he was a slow eater and we didn't give it a second thought.

Jenny, who had the “Spaghetti Exit”, suddenly felt bad, She didn't look well in the morning and I guessed she finally had to “relieve” herself.

"I have to go...” She said silently.

"David is still eating.” I said.

"No. I have to go...” she whispered and pointed in the general direction of the bathroom, “It's kind of an emergency...”

"No.” David grabbed her arm a little harder than he intended, “Hold it in.”

"What the hell are you talking about?” I asked.

"Just don't.” David said. I looked at his eyes. It didn't look like he was making a joke. He wasn't laughing, he looked worried, terrified even.

"Let me go!” Jenny screamed and struggled to free herself from his grip. David let go of her arm immediately.  
People were watching.

"Jenny, please don't. I'm begging you.” he whispered.

"What the hell is going on with him?” she asked me, “He's even weirder than usual.”

Jenny got up and rushed to the toilet. I thought it was a matter of seconds before she had an “accident”.

"What the fuck is wrong with you, David?” I whispered, “Have you gone completely mad?”

"I... I...” David looked away. He was watching the bathroom, expecting something to happen.

I looked at his plate. It seemed that he didn't take a bite from his “Go brown, Go down” chicken. It wasn't like him. It wasn't like him at all.

“David, what's wrong?” I asked.

David ignored me. He was focused on the bathroom door, staring intensely at it.

"David?”

David started to shiver and breathe heavily. I thought he was going to pass out.

“No, no, no, no...” he whispered.

A scream came from inside the bathroom, and then a sound of something crashing down. David screamed too.

"I told her...” he cried, “I told her to hold it in...”

He jumped over the table and ran for the exit.  
Jenny came out of the bathroom a few seconds later. She seemed confused and shaken and had a cut on her forehead.

"Jenny?” I approached her slowly, “What happened?”

"Leave me alone.” she said in a freezing tone, “Hold it in, you have to hold it in.”

"Hold it in?” I thought, “Are they playing a prank on me?”  
It sure didn't seem this way, but David and Jenny always had their twisted sense of humor. I remembered the time they convinced me that McDonald's used bat meat for their burgers, leading me to tell this to anyone I knew, making a complete idiot out of me, or the time David and Jenny told me that our boss was secretly a Nazi. They were so convincing I almost believed them, or the time that... never mind, it happened a lot. I'm a sucker, I know.  
Well.. fool me once - shame on you, fool me fifty-seven times – shame on me.

"Very funny, Jenny.” I said, forcing myself to smile.

She silently stared at me for a few seconds, walked slowly away from me, and exited the restaurant.  
The guy at the counter looked at her leaving and then stared directly at me.

"What?” I asked.

"Are you going to clean the mess in there?” he asked.

"What?” I asked again. Is he in on it?

"ARE. YOU. GOING. TO. CLEAN. THE. MESS. IN. THERE?”

"No, I'm not.” I said.

"God damn it. She is YOUR friend, you know...” he said and went into the bathroom.

“Yeah, yeah. Whatever.” I thought, “The joke is over and it wasn't even that funny.”  
I had enough. I got up and walked out.  
I tried to call David and Jenny, just to tell them their stupid prank was over. It was cool how they had the guy behind the counter to play along, but it wasn't that funny.  
Neither of them answered the phone. They never knew when to quit.

I drove home, listening to some old songs I like, and by the time I got home, I had forgotten all about this stupid prank.

My wife wasn't home at the time. She and the kids were out camping. I don't like camping, mainly because of the... let's call it “poop logistics”, so they went without me.  
I watched some TV and did some chores and then... nature called.  
I grabbed a book, went to the bathroom, and smiled when I remembered David telling Jenny to “hold it in.” I had to admit it was a little funny. I giggled.

I did what I had to do when suddenly I heard a growl. At first, I thought it was my stomach that was making noises, but then the growl became louder... and then something touched my bottom.

I jumped off the toilet and looked inside to see what the hell was touching me and I saw it.  
Inside the toilet there was this brown slimy thing, it was violently twitching and squirming. I've also noticed that it had two black eyes. It blinked at me (twice!) and then started making this unsettling noise through what I guess was its mouth.  
In a panic, I tried to open the door but pushed instead of pulling. I pushed myself against the door while this thing raised some kind of hairy tentacle and tried to grab the toilet seat. It was trying to get out! I pulled myself together and flushed.  
The thing squealed so hard I had to cover my ears until it was gone.

“HOLD IT IN”

The words echoed in my ears.

Trembling with fear, I ran out to the street, my pants still at my feet, calling for help. People looked at me like I was crazy. In hindsight I suppose it wasn't the smartest thing to yell out: “Help, I just pooped a monster!”  
I then tried to call Jenny and David.  
David seemed to know something, he did try to warn Jenny.  
Neither of them answered the phone. I still don't know what happened to them.

That was yesterday.  
I had to go once more since then. I had hoped it was over, but it happened again.  
I don't know if it's following me or if it was inside me and if it was inside me, how many more there are.

I don't know what to do.  
I don't want to use the toilet again!  
I won't.  
I can't!

Did this happen to any of you?

Please help.
