So when this started I was around 8 or 9 and I vividly remember it scaring me so bad I would not sleep in my own bed. I had a regular routine of checking under my bed at the start (as many kids do) and I wish I would have never done it. I just remember always seeing these orange eyes that glowed in the dark. I had always been a kid that was scared of the dark and I would sleep with the lights on but sometimes I would wake up during the night and the light was off (I always guessed it had been my parents). I remember one particular night where I had been struggling to fall asleep even though I had my mom with me. I had that sense that I was being watched and looked over to the doorway. I could just see a green woman who was whispering something quietly, getting louder every time she said it. I could soon hear what was being said and I can still remember very clearly what was being said: "Kill her...Kill her" 

I was freaked out and sat quietly, whimpering in fear until she started drifting closer. That was when I screamed my lungs out. My dad, who had been sleeping in the room next door, came bolting in asking me what was wrong.. running straight through the woman as she faded.. I told him exactly what I'd seen and he brushed it off telling me I was just having a bad dream, my mom just agreed with him.

Before this I had kept on getting a reoccuring nightmare:

I was with my brother in this mine shaft walking around until we heard a weird voice calling out to us. We got terrified and ran and hid behind some massive boulders, from which we looked in horror as a tall woman with pale skin and black hair covering her face come out from one of the long tunnels calling our names. We waited until she'd passed, at which point we crept out and walked into one of the many bathrooms there were there. There was just lots of toilet cubicles and 4 bathtubs. I walked over to one of the bathtubs and looked at it before turning my back on it. At that point I knew I'd made a mistake. I felt an icy chill on my neck. Then I got pulled back into the tub, whilst my brother was trying to fight this monster off of me. Soon he somehow got her away and she shrivelled onto a pile of black substance. I heard a whisper of "I'm coming for you..." That was the point where I woke up.

I could swear I saw her in the mirror when I looked into any of them. I had the same nightmare for years until we moved out of that house. I had the first good night of sleep when we moved into my new house. 

I'm sure that I had encounters with demons, I've never believed it more before that.

\[This is a true story from my scary childhood that still live with me\]
