I’ve started to do some of the things I found, but so far nothing has happened. I did my best to copy down any important symbols, runes, whatever I needed, but there’s still nothing. I’d appreciate more suggestions. I don’t know how long it's going to take, but I'm going to hear her voice again.

On a possibly unrelated note, I have been getting random pains. I noticed the first one in my right arm, and it was bad enough that I would have thought it was a heart attack if it was my left arm. Did one of these rituals do that? Is it stress? Is my body fighting against my poor choices? 

I thought I’d describe her a little more for anyone who needs to know more about the situation, plus I’ll happily describe her and relive some of those moments again. My wife had a perfect smile. She had pristine porcelain skin with only a few hidden freckles. She had beautiful, long brown hair. Her hair shined, it was always silky, seemed to never knot, and was so cute when she had bed head. She had light green eyes that seemed to glow in the light, and hide in the dark. She was pretty short, about 5’3 on a good day. Her hands were small but she was skilled. She was an amazing cook and an even better designer.

My wife was an artist and graphic designer. She had her office for her art. My personal space was the living room as long as we didn’t have friends over. She would always tease me about cleaning, but she was never harsh, always so gentle with how she would bring up problems. I’d like to say that she looked at me the same way I looked at her, but she was always more calm. My emotions would always bubble up, and even after being married. I found myself flustered at times, like when she would come up close and look straight up at me like a puppy, or when she would tease me about how much I loved her. She, on the other hand, went from no confidence, to all the confidence in the world after she married me. In high school, she would always sit quietly and draw as I fawned over her. Eventually I'd fawn over her as we talked. I love that woman with all my soul. Maybe if she had died of old age, I could deal with it better, or if she was killed in a crash or by some home intruder, I could be angry with someone if not the world. Instead I have to keep it in and let it fester like an infected wound. 

I’m sure some of you believe that I killed her despite reading this far. I know that, because that’s what her friends believe. They were bridesmaids at our wedding, but they are so suspicious of me. I haven't seen them at her grave since her funeral, but I do see them occasionally out and about. Obviously everyone assumes the spouse is a killer. The police did as well, but there’s the coroner's reports and video footage of me at work. That doesn’t stop her friends from assuming I hired someone or asked a friend for some sick favor. I thought they were good friends until this happened. I still remember coming home and seeing her blood had dried, turned dark, and her body was cold and stiff. Her pale skin was even more pale, almost see through. I am thankful for the mortuary. Most people find mortuaries creepy, but they did a good job at freezing her beauty in time. I wish it was me instead, but it wasn’t.

I think I’ve tried all the “safe” ones I can find, and I’m done playing it safe. Give me anything effective and preferably legal. I’m still looking around the internet for rituals or people who can help, along with suggestions on what to do or avoid, like the spiritual equivalent of malware. That’s my best comparison, but it’s probably because I’m the I.T. guy at work, and I can’t think straight anymore.

Speaking of, I’m supposed to go back to work in a week or so, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to focus. I haven’t been thinking straight. I don’t want to lose my job because starving to death sounds horrible, and my wife would hate me for letting that happen. Any ideas on fast money would help too, but I need her back.
