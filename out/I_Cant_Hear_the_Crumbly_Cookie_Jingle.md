I'm writing this because I need someone to tell me they remember the world the way I do. I need proof that I'm not losing my mind, or if I am, I need a record of what I was before this happened.

Three weeks ago, I lost my job to budget cuts at a marketing firm already circling the drain. I kept telling myself I was safe, that my work mattered. It didn't.

Two weeks ago, Jennifer left. She said it wasn't my fault, that she needed different things. I know the truth. I spent every evening on the couch scrolling through my phone, talking about how things used to be better. She wanted someone with a future. I stayed stuck.

My back hurts constantly now. Thirty-six years old and I wake up every morning feeling like I'm sixty. Probably from all those years hunched over a desk, but I can't afford a chiropractor anymore. I can't afford much of anything anymore.

This isn't how I imagined adulthood. I'm in a one-bedroom apartment I can barely afford, eating cereal for dinner, wondering when I stopped trying.

The nostalgia started as a comfort thing. When you can't sleep and your brain won't stop cataloging all the ways you've failed, it helps to watch old Nickelodeon commercials or read about discontinued snack foods. There's something soothing about remembering a time when your biggest concern was whether you'd get to watch your favorite show after school. Everything was simpler. Everything was possible.

I know it's unhealthy. I know I'm using it as an escape. But it's the only thing that quiets my mind anymore.

YouTube's algorithm has learned exactly what I want. Obscure toy commercials from 1994. Forgotten Saturday morning cartoon blocks. Local station IDs from regional networks that don't exist anymore. The more specific, the better. There's a whole community of us, people who archive this stuff, people who remember. The comments sections are full of people saying "I thought I was the only one who remembered this" or "I've been looking for this for twenty years." It feels like home in a way my actual apartment doesn't.

Three nights ago, I couldn't sleep. My back was killing me, and my brain was doing that thing where it replays every conversation you've ever had and points out all the ways you sounded stupid. I opened YouTube around 11 PM, thinking I'd watch a few videos and drift off.

Six hours later, I was still awake.

I started with the usual 90s commercials and cartoon bumpers. Each video led to another, more specific, more obscure.

Around 3 AM, I found a channel dedicated entirely to regional grocery store commercials from the mid-90s. The production values were terrible, the acting was painful, but I watched every single one. There was something hypnotic about it. These tiny capsules of a world that didn't exist anymore, preserved by someone who cared enough to digitize them.

At 4 AM, I was watching compilation videos of forgotten cereal mascots. Characters that lasted maybe one year before being quietly retired. I remembered some of them. Most of them I didn't. But the aesthetic was right. That specific color palette, that animation style, that overwhelming sense of manufactured joy.

By 5 AM, I'd moved on to obscure public access children's shows. Local productions from cities I'd never lived in, hosted by people who'd probably never worked in television again. The video quality was degrading. More VHS artifacts, more tracking errors, more of that analog warmth that felt like being wrapped in a blanket.

I knew I should stop. I had an interview at noon that I was unprepared for. My eyes were burning, my back screaming.

I couldn't.

The real world was waiting for me when I closed the laptop. The stack of bills on my desk. The job search spreadsheet with its growing list of rejections. The empty side of the bed. All of it sitting there in the dark, patient and inevitable.

In the videos, none of that existed. There were no bills in 1995. No failed relationships. No aching joints or stagnant careers. Just Saturday mornings and sugary cereal and the promise that everything would turn out fine.

At 5:47 AM, I clicked on a video titled "90s Snack Commercials You Totally Forgot About." Forty-three minutes long. Uploaded by a channel with 300 subscribers. The description was minimal: "VHS rip from a 1996 recording. Some tracking issues but mostly clean."

I hit play.

The first few commercials were exactly what I expected. Dunkaroos with their cartoon kangaroo. Gushers with kids' heads transforming into fruit. Those pizza-flavored Combos that tasted like cardboard soaked in cheese powder. I remembered all of them. I could hear the jingles before they played.

Then, at the 31-minute mark, something appeared that I didn't recognize.

The commercial opened on an aggressively cheerful kitchen. The animation style was cheap, even by 90s standards. A cartoon family with those weird oval heads and stick limbs that low-budget studios used because they were easy to animate. The color palette was oversaturated, everything too bright and flat. The mom had an apron and an impossible smile. The dad was reading a newspaper at a kitchen table that looked more like a cardboard cutout than furniture.

The mom sat a tray of cookies on the table. They were enormous, covered in exaggerated chocolate chips that sparkled and literally winked at the camera. The animation was stiff, cycled. You could see the same three frames repeating as steam rose from the tray.

A voice-over began, enthusiastic and gender-neutral in that specific 90s commercial way: "When you want a treat that's sweet and neat, reach for Crumbly Cookies!"

The cartoon kid at the table grabbed one of the cookies. His eyes grew to twice their normal size. He bit into it, and the chocolate chips exploded into stars. Standard commercial hyperbole.

Then the music swelled. The animation zoomed in on the cookie. The mom, dad, and kid all opened their mouths in unison, clearly about to deliver the jingle, the memorable hook, the part that would burrow into your brain and live there for decades.

And I heard nothing.

It wasn't silence. The audio didn't cut out completely. There was sound, but it was compressed, distorted. Like someone had taken that section of the audio file and replaced it with white noise, with static, with the sound of a corrupted file trying to play. Maybe a few seconds of garbled nothing where the jingle should have been.

Then the commercial resumed. The voice-over returned: "Crumbly Cookies! Available at grocery stores everywhere!" The family was back to smiling, the cookie was back to sparkling, and then it cut to the next commercial in the compilation.

I sat there staring at the screen. My first thought was that the VHS rip was damaged. These old recordings always had issues. Tracking problems, audio dropouts, sections where the tape had degraded.

I scrolled down to the comments to see if anyone else had noticed the corrupted audio.

The top comment, posted three months ago, had 847 likes: "CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE! This jingle lives in my head rent-free 24/7. I'm 34 and I still can't get it out."

I read it twice. Then I read the second comment.

"My mom used to sing this to annoy us on road trips. Thanks for unlocking that memory lol."

The third comment: "This jingle is literally the reason I became a jingle writer. No joke. It's perfectly constructed. That key change in the middle? Chef's kiss."

Fourth comment: "Anyone else hear this in their nightmares? It's been 30 years and I can still hear every note."

I scrolled through dozens more. People quoting the jingle. People sharing detailed memories of where they were when they first heard it. Someone had written a full paragraph analyzing the musical composition, discussing chord progressions and melodic intervals and the genius of the rhyme scheme.

Not one person mentioned corrupted audio. Not one person said the jingle was missing or damaged.

They were all hearing something I wasn't.

I clicked back to the video and replayed the commercial. Same result. The setup was fine, the voice-over was clear, and then that static gap where the jingle should have been, followed by the outro.

I searched Crumbly Cookie jingle again.

Six different YouTube videos came up, all of them just the jingle itself, cleanly extracted from the commercial. "Crumbly Cookie Jingle (1996) - Clean Audio," "Crumbly Cookie Song - Full Version," "Crumbly Cookie Jingle - 10 Hour Loop."

I clicked the first one. The video was just a still image of the cookie from the commercial with a sparkle effect looping endlessly. The audio began. I heard the music start, that swelling buildup, and then the same compressed static gap, then silence.

The video was fifteen seconds long. According to the timeline, the jingle should have lasted for twelve of those seconds.

The comments section had over two thousand comments. All of them talking about how catchy the jingle was. How memorable. How it had defined their childhood.

I found it on Spotify, on a playlist of 90s jingles. Track seven. Every playback was the same. Buildup, static, outro.

It was 6:30 AM. The sun was starting to come up outside my window. I could hear my neighbor's alarm going off through the thin walls.

I told myself it was some kind of internet joke. A collective bit where everyone pretended to remember something that didn't exist, just to mess with people. The Mandela Effect weaponized.

I closed my laptop and tried to sleep.

At noon, I bombed the phone interview. I couldn't focus. I kept thinking about the static gap, about all those comments, about the certainty in people's comments when they talked about a jingle I couldn't hear.

At 2 PM, I texted Derek and asked if he wanted to grab coffee.

Derek and I have been friends since high school. We have this routine where we send each other the dumbest, most obscure nostalgic garbage we can find online. Weird local commercials, forgotten toy lines, and discontinued snack foods. He's the only person I know who understands the appeal.

We met at the coffee shop on Fifth Street at 3 PM. He was already there, scrolling through his phone. He looked up when I walked in and immediately frowned.

"You look like hell," he said.

"Couldn't sleep." I sat down across from him. "Hey, do you remember Crumbly Cookies? Like, the snack brand from the 90s?"

His face lit up immediately. "Oh man, yeah! My grandma used to keep them in her pantry. They were pretty mediocre, honestly, but that jingle..." He started nodding his head to some internal rhythm, smiling. "Dude, you just put that back in my head. I'm going to be humming it all day now."

My stomach dropped.

"Can you hum it for me?" I asked.

He looked at me like I'd asked him to explain basic arithmetic. "You're kidding, right? You don't remember the Crumbly Cookie song?"

"I remember the commercial," I said. "I just can't remember the jingle part."

"How do you remember the commercial but not the jingle? The jingle is the whole point."

"I'm serious. I watched the commercial this morning. The audio cuts out right where the jingle should be."

Derek stared at me for a long moment. Then he laughed, but it was an uncomfortable laugh. "That's a weird bit, man. Is this like a setup for something?"

"It's not a bit."

"Then you need to get some sleep. The Crumbly Cookie jingle is like... it's foundational. Everyone knows it." He picked up his coffee and took a sip, still watching me with that confused expression. "Are you feeling okay? Like, actually?"

I tried to laugh it off. "Yeah, just tired. Forget I asked."

He kept staring at me, and I could tell he thought I was messing with him, or worse, that something was deeply wrong with me.

We talked about other things for another twenty minutes, but the conversation felt strained. When we left, Derek gave me this look, concerned and bewildered, and told me to get some rest.

I walked home slowly. My back was killing me.

When I passed the corner of Fifth and Maple, I stopped.

There was a bakery there. A small storefront with a cheerful sign and a painted window.

I'd walked past that corner three times a week for the past two years.

It used to be a dry cleaner.

The sign read "Cookie Crumble Cafe" in that same aggressively cheerful font from the commercial. The mascot painted on the window was a cartoon cookie with a smiling face and oversized chocolate chips that sparkled. The color palette was identical: that specific shade of yellow-orange background with bright red accents that cheap 90s animation loved.

I stood on the sidewalk for maybe ten minutes, just staring. The building looked old. Genuinely weathered. The paint on the window was faded in places, chipped at the edges. The awning had sun damage. There was a historical business registry plaque near the door, the kind the city puts up for establishments that have been around for decades.

I walked closer and read it.

"Cookie Crumble Cafe. Est. 1997."

Twenty-eight years. According to this plaque, this bakery had been here for twenty-eight years.

I knew what I'd see if I went inside. I knew I should just keep walking, go home, take some ibuprofen for my back, and try to sleep. But I couldn't make myself leave.

The bell above the door chimed when I pushed it open. The interior matched the exterior perfectly. Bright, cheerful, slightly dated. The display case was full of oversized cookies with exaggerated chocolate chips. The walls were painted that same yellow-orange. There were framed photos hung up behind the counter: the bakery at various points in its history, or at least what appeared to be its history.

A woman in her fifties stood behind the register. She smiled when she saw me.

"First time here?" she asked.

"When did this place open?" The question came out more aggressively than I intended.

She didn't seem bothered. "Oh, we've been here forever. Twenty-eight years this November. My mom opened it right after those Crumbly Cookie commercials got big, shame the company went out of business. She loved that jingle so much she decided to build a whole store around it. I thought she was crazy, but it worked out." She gestured at the display case. "We've got twelve varieties now. The chocolate chip is still the most popular, obviously."

"What was here before?" I asked.

She looked confused. "Before? Nothing. This was an empty lot. My mom bought the property and built from the ground up."

"There wasn't a dry cleaner here?"

"Not that I know of. Maybe you're thinking of a different corner?"

I left without buying anything.

When I got back to my apartment, I went straight to my laptop. I needed to prove to myself that I wasn't losing my mind. I needed documentation, evidence, something concrete.

I pulled up Google Maps and searched for the corner of Fifth and Maple. The street view loaded. I clicked back through the historical imagery, the archived photos that Google keeps from previous years.

Every archived image from 2012 to 2023 showed the same building: Cookie Crumble Cafe.

I sat back from my laptop and pressed my palms against my eyes. Maybe I'd been wrong about the dry cleaner. Maybe I was misremembering. Maybe it had been on a different corner, or a different street entirely.

I knew I wasn't wrong.

I opened YouTube again and searched for the Crumbly Cookie commercial. I clicked on a video essay someone had made about 90s advertising trends. It was forty minutes long, and at the fifteen-minute mark, the creator started discussing the cultural impact of the Crumbly Cookie jingle.

"This is one of those rare cases where a commercial jingle transcended advertising and became a genuine cultural touchstone," the narrator said. 

"Everyone who grew up in the 90s can sing this. It's been referenced in TV shows, parodied in comedy sketches, and studied in marketing courses as an example of perfect jingle construction."

The video played a clip of the commercial. The family, the cookie, the buildup.

Static gap.

I checked the comments. Four hundred people talking about how accurate the video essay was, how the jingle really had been everywhere, how it was impossible to forget.

I clicked on another video. A local news segment from 2015 about nostalgic food trends. The reporter interviewed people on the street, asking them about snacks from their childhood. Three different people mentioned Crumbly Cookies. One of them sang the jingle on camera.

I watched her mouth move. I watched her face light up with nostalgia. I heard her voice forming the melody.

But all I heard was that rhythmic cadence, that four-beat pause-three-beat pattern, wrapped in static.

I spent the next hour going through everything. Reddit threads about 90s nostalgia. BuzzFeed listicles about discontinued snacks. Academic articles about advertising and memory. The Crumbly Cookie jingle appeared everywhere, referenced constantly, treated as a universally known cultural artifact.

And I couldn't hear it.

At some point during my search, I saw the name "The Knight Trippers" appear in a comment thread. Someone had written: "Fun fact: the duo who sang the Crumbly Cookie jingle went on to have a pretty successful music career. The Knight Trippers. They've got some great albums if you're into folk music."

I knew that name.

The Knight Trippers were an indie folk group. Late 90s, early 2000s. I owned two of their albums. They had this haunting, understated sound, and sang in a duet style like Alice in Chains, but with a folk twist. They wrote quiet songs about loneliness and small-town depression. I'd discovered their music in college, during a particularly bad semester, and those songs had helped me feel less alone.

I pulled up the Wikipedia page.

The first line read: "The Knight Trippers are an American singer-songwriter duo best known for performing the Crumbly Cookie jingle in 1996, which became one of the most recognizable advertising songs of the decade."

I read it three times.

The article described their career in detail. The jingle had been their big break. It led to a contract with a major label, two pop albums in the late 90s and early 2000s, and eventually a transition back to folk music in the 2010s when the pop career faded. There were sections about their touring history, their influences, their legacy.

The two albums I remembered, "Basement Hymns" and "Evening Drove," weren't mentioned anywhere.

I got up from my desk and went to my bookshelf. I still buy physical media. CDs, vinyl, even cassettes if I can find them. There's something comforting about having a tangible object, something that can't be changed by an algorithm or deleted from a streaming service.

I found "Basement Hymns" exactly where I'd left it, wedged between two other folk albums. I pulled it out and looked at the cover. Their faces in black and white, staring past the camera with that sad, distant expression I remembered.

I turned it over to check the track listing.

The back cover had been redesigned. The font was different, more commercial. The track titles had changed. Where "Sirens on the Highway" used to be, there was now a song called "After the Fame." Where "Basement Light" had been, there was "Cookie Crumbs and Heartbreak."

The liner notes, printed in tiny text along the bottom, included a paragraph: "Special thanks to the Crumbly Cookie campaign for giving us our start. This album wouldn't exist without that magical moment in a recording studio in 1996."

My hands were shaking. I put the CD in my laptop's external drive and opened the audio files.

The first track started playing. It was their voice. Definitely their voice. That same haunting quality, that slight rasp on the edges of certain words.

But the song was different.

The melody echoed Sirens on the Highway, but the lyrics were wrong. They sang about childhood, chocolate chips, and memories of commercials.

I skipped to the next track. Same thing. The bones of "Basement Light" were there, but the lyrics now referenced nostalgia, sweetness, the comfort of simple pleasures.

Every song had been rewritten. Every song now contained some oblique reference to cookies, to childhood, to that jingle.

I ejected the CD and held it in my hands, staring at it. The disc itself looked normal. No visible damage, no signs of tampering. Just a regular CD that had somehow rewritten itself.

A brief, fragmented memory danced across my mind. Not a full recollection, but the ghost of a memory. Something about my tenth birthday. 

I picked up my phone and called my mom.

She answered on the third ring. "Hey, sweetheart. What's going on?"

"Do you remember my tenth birthday?" I asked.

"Of course I do. You wanted that Pokemon cake from the grocery store, but they were sold out, so I made you one from scratch. It was a disaster. Frosting everywhere." She laughed. "Why do you ask?"

"Did you make anything else? Any other food?"

There was a pause. I could hear her thinking. "Well, I made those Crumbly Cookies as a joke. You were obsessed with that commercial. You used to sing the jingle constantly, drove me absolutely crazy. I found a copycat recipe online and made them from scratch. Put them on a little platter around the cake. They turned out pretty good, actually."

My throat felt tight. "I don't remember that."

"Really? You made me sing the jingle while you blew out the candles. God, I can still hear it in your little kid voice." She started singing, her voice lilting up and down in a melodic pattern.

I heard the rhythm. I heard the cadence of her voice, the way it rose and fell. I heard the affection and nostalgia in her tone.

But I didn't hear the melody. Just that static gap, that compressed nothing where the tune should have been.

"Alex? Are you still there?"

"Yeah," I said. "Just feeling nostalgic."

"Are you okay? You sound strange."

"I'm fine. Just tired. I should go."

"Wait, before you hang up. Your cousin Emily posted that photo from your tenth birthday on Facebook last week. Did you see it? You looked so happy. I'm going to print it out and frame it."

"I didn't see it. I'll check."

"Okay, honey. Get some rest. Love you."

"Love you too."

I hung up and opened Facebook. I rarely use it anymore, but I logged in and searched for my cousin's profile. There, posted six days ago, was a photo album titled "Throwback: Alex's 10th Birthday."

I clicked on it.

The first photo showed me at ten years old, standing in front of a chocolate cake with candles. I was smiling. My mom was in the background, laughing. The image quality was that specific early digital camera look, slightly grainy and oversaturated.

Around the cake, on a decorative platter, were oversized cookies with exaggerated chocolate chips.

The second photo was a close-up of me holding one of the cookies, taking a bite, my eyes squeezed shut in exaggerated joy.

The third photo showed my mom and me together, both of us with our mouths open, clearly singing something.

The caption read: "Remember when Aunt Sarah made those amazing Crumbly Cookies? Alex made us all sing the jingle! Good times."

Seventeen likes. Eight comments from family members and old family friends, all reminiscing about the party, about how much I'd loved that jingle, about how funny it was that I'd insisted everyone sing it.

I didn't remember any of this. Not the cookies, not the singing, not that look of pure joy on my ten-year-old face.

The photo existed. The comments existed. My mother's memory existed.

And I was the only one who didn't remember.

I closed my laptop and looked around my apartment. Everything looked slightly off. Colors flattened, shadows sharpened, furniture looked painted on.

I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.

My face was the same. Same tired eyes, same stubble, same scar on my chin from a skateboarding accident when I was sixteen. But there was something wrong with the reflection. The colors were too bright. My skin looked smooth in a way that real skin doesn't look, like I was seeing myself through a filter.

I reached up and touched my face. My hand felt normal. But watching the reflection move, there was this fractional delay, this tiny gap between my movement and what I saw in the mirror.

I stood there for maybe five minutes, just staring, trying to figure out what had changed.

Then I realized: I had a rhythm stuck in my head.

Over and over. Like a song I couldn't quite remember, a melody that existed as shape without sound.

I knew there were words there. I knew there was a tune. But when I tried to access it, there was only that static gap, that white noise void where the jingle should have been.

CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE.

I knew that's what it said. Everyone had told me. I'd read it a hundred times.

But I couldn't hear it.

And that inability, that gap in my perception, felt like the only thing still anchoring me to who I'd been before.

That was yesterday evening.

I haven't left my apartment since then.

I've spent the past eighteen hours sitting at this laptop, documenting everything. Taking screenshots, writing notes, trying to create some kind of record before it's too late. The laptop is the only thing that still feels completely real. The keys under my fingers, the screen's glow, the cursor blinking at the end of each sentence.

Everything else is changing now.

My furniture looks like stage props. The walls are too smooth, the lighting too even. When I look at my books on the shelf, the spines seem flat, two-dimensional, like someone painted them on rather than them being actual objects.

I tried to leave twice today. Both times I opened the door and looked at the hallway outside, and I couldn't make myself step through. The carpet was rendered in that textureless way. The walls had that oversaturated color. The light fixtures looked drawn on.

It looked like the background art from the Crumbly Cookie commercial.

The screenshots I took yesterday have changed. I opened them this morning to review my evidence, and they were different. The Knight Trippers Wikipedia page had more detail now, more sections about the jingle's cultural impact. I checked the metadata on the image files. According to the timestamps, I took these screenshots yesterday at 6:47 PM.

But the content was different than what I remembered capturing.

I took another screenshot of the same Wikipedia page. I opened both images side by side. Within twenty minutes, the new screenshot had changed too. More details added. Different phrasing in the introduction. The edit history showing changes made years ago.

The photo I took of the bakery has been transforming too. Each time I open it, the building looks older. There's graffiti on the side wall now that wasn't there when I took the picture.

I'm looking at my hands right now as I type this. They look the same, but they don't feel the same. The texture is slightly off. When I move my fingers, there's this fractional delay, like I'm watching myself on a video stream with bad latency.

I looked in the mirror again an hour ago. I'm still me. Same face, same tired eyes, same scar on my chin. But the colors are different. My skin looks flatter, rendered in that cheap animation style. The shadows on my face are too sharp, too defined, like someone traced them with a marker.

I can feel it happening to me.

There's a pressure in my skull. It's been building since last night. It feels like something pushing against the inside of my forehead, trying to get in. When I think about my childhood, I see two versions of every memory. The real version, the one I know happened. And another version, flickering underneath it, where Crumbly Cookies existed, where I sang the jingle, where my life always included this thing I can't perceive.

The false memories are getting stronger. Sometimes I'll be sitting here and I'll suddenly remember a birthday party with cookies I know never existed. Or I'll hear my mother's voice in my head, singing that jingle, and for a moment it almost makes sense. For a moment, the melody is almost there.

Then it dissolves back into static.

I called Derek twenty minutes ago. I needed to hear a familiar voice. I needed someone to confirm I was still real.

"Hey man," he said. "What's up?"

"I need you to tell me the truth," I said. "About the Crumbly Cookie jingle. Do you actually remember it, or is everyone just pretending?"

"Alex, are you okay? You sound really weird."

"Just answer the question. Please."

He sighed. "Yes, I remember it. We used to sing it together on the bus in middle school. You started it, actually. You thought it was hilarious. We'd sing it until the bus driver told us to shut up. Like, we did this at least once a week for an entire year."

"I don't remember that."

"Well, I do. Dude, seriously, what's going on with you? This isn't funny anymore."

"Can you sing it for me? Right now?"

"I'm at work."

"Please. I need to hear it."

There was a long pause. Then he started singing. His voice was self-conscious at first, then got more confident. I could hear him smiling as he sang, remembering. I heard the words forming, the pitch rising and falling. I heard the enthusiasm, the nostalgia, the affection for a shared memory.

But I didn't hear the melody.

Just that rhythm. Four beats, pause, three beats. The cadence of the words wrapped in static.

"Did you hear it?" he asked.

"Yeah," I lied. "Thanks."

"Are you sure you're okay? Do you need me to come over?"

"No. I'm fine. I just needed to hear it."

"Okay. But seriously, if you need anything, call me. You're freaking me out a little."

I hung up before he could say anything else.

I sat there holding my phone, staring at it. The screen looked flat. The icons looked painted on. When I pressed the home button, there was that same fractional delay.

Everything is becoming background art.

I'm not fading or disappearing. I'm being pulled into a world my mind can't process.

A world where the Crumbly Cookie jingle has always existed, where I've always known it, where my entire life has been shaped by it.

But I can't hear it.

And that gap, that inability, is the only thing keeping me tethered to who I was.

I don't know how much longer I can hold on. The pressure in my skull is getting worse. My hands are starting to look different when I glance down at them. The apartment is transforming around me, becoming more and more like a stage set, a background, a low-resolution environment for characters who can actually hear the jingle.

I'm typing this as fast as I can because I need to finish it. I need to post it before the transformation completes. Before my mind rewrites itself to match this new reality, this reality where I've always been able to hear the song.

If you're reading this, and you remember a world where Crumbly Cookies didn't exist, or where The Knight Trippers sang quiet folk songs instead of commercial jingles, or where that corner was a dry cleaner and not a bakery, please tell me. Please leave a comment. I need to know there's still a world out there that matches my memories.

And if you can hear the jingle, if you've always been able to hear it, I need you to understand something:

I can't.

I've never been able to.

And that's the only thing keeping me from forgetting who I was.

I can hear the rhythm in my head right now. It's constant. The words are there, shape without sound, meaning without music. My mouth wants to form them. My brain keeps trying to access the melody.

CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE.

I know that's what it says. Everyone knows what it says.

But I can't hear it.

I'm going to post this now. I don't know if anyone will believe me. I don't know if anyone who reads this will remember the world I came from. Maybe I'm the only one. Maybe I slipped through some crack in reality during that six-hour binge, and everyone else is exactly where they've always been, in a world where the Crumbly Cookie jingle has existed for thirty years.

Or maybe some of you will read this and recognize what I'm describing. Maybe you'll feel that same gap, that same static where something should be. Maybe you'll realize you can't quite remember something everyone else seems to know.

If that's you, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

I'm still here. I'm still conscious. I can still think, still type, still function. But I'm alone in a way I can't fully explain. I'm living in a world that has rewritten itself around me, and I'm the only one who notices the edits.

The jingle is still playing in my head. The rhythm won't stop. And I know, eventually, my mind will find a way to fill in that static gap. It will generate the melody it's supposed to hear. It will rewrite my memories to match everyone else's. It will make me whole again, make me part of this reality instead of a glitch in it.

I'm terrified of that moment. But I'm more terrified it won't come. That I'll stay like this forever, conscious and aware, trapped in a world I can almost understand but never quite perceive correctly.

The laptop is the last real thing I have. When I close it, when I hit post, I don't know what happens next.

But I need someone to know this happened. I need a record to exist, even if it gets absorbed and rewritten like everything else.

And if you can't hear it, if you're reading this and realizing there's a gap in your perception that everyone else seems to fill effortlessly, then you're not alone.

I'm here too.

Still here.

For now.
