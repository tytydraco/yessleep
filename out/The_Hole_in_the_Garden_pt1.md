I haven’t told this story to most people. Some would think I was being delusional or it was all just a dream. I know it wasn’t a dream and I need someone to believe me. The place I went, the things I have seen. The hole in my garden wasn’t imaginary, it was real. If I could tell this story to anyone it would be this community. It seems like this is a safe place to share the bizarre and unnatural, without being judged. 

It was August 8th 1999. I was around eight years old at the time and I just got home from school. The summer heat was dying down as autumn was closing in. I used to love to play in the garden as a child while my mother would tend to her flowers. She would grow beautiful orchids in rows of ten. She would always scold me for getting to close to them, she treated them like her babies. I tried my best to stay away from them while playing outside. Until I saw it for the first time.

A hole was dugout in the orchids, about the size of a baseball. I knew I was going to get the blame for it later but I didn’t pay it much mind. Mother finally came home and saw what had happened. Four of her “precious” orchids were destroyed around the hole. She questioned if I had done anything, but I told her it must have been rabbits or something. She didn’t believe me. I was sent to my room for destroying her garden even though I didn’t do it. I was eight so why would she believe a kid who constantly lies through their teeth.

I was sent to bed early that night without dinner. At that time I hated my mother for not believing me, so I wanted to prove my innocence. I planned to go out into the garden and catch the rabbit when it returned. Rabbits always come out at night in our neighborhood in search of food so I was bound to catch one. Even if it wasn’t the perp that dug a whole, I could be ungrounded. 

I waited till about 11:30 pm to go catch the rabbit that destroyed my moms garden. When all seemed quiet, I gently tiptoed down the steps in hopes my mother wouldn’t hear me sneaking out of my room. I made my way to the back door and slowly opened the creaky door. I ran across the lawn and made my way to the garden. I made my way to the rabbit hole and then I saw it

The hole was now the size of a beach ball. More orchids were destroyed around the entrance. I had enough of this stupid rabbit getting me in trouble, so I pulled up my sleeves and reached in the hole. My arm reached as far as it could, but I couldn’t feel the back of the hole. Dirt started falling around my arm as I extended my reach farther in. It came to the point to where half of my body was in the hole. As I kept reaching I heard a faint soft voice say “She’s coming.”

The dirt below me collapsed as my body flung forward into the hole. The moonlight disappeared as I slid deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole, until it was pitch black. I felt my body slide against the dirt and my speed was increasing. The slide suddenly turned into a 90 degree angle drop. This was it. I expected the to hit the ground at any minute, but then I stopped. I was laying fast first in the dirt. I slowly pushed my torso upwards to look for an exit from the hole. A faint light could be seen in the distance. I slowly crawled my way out and found myself in a vast wheat field. It was still dark but a light was coming from something in the distance. As my eyes adjusted, I could see a small house upon a hill. 

I looked back for the hole I just crawled out of,but it was gone. Since my exit was closed off, my only option was to make my way to the house. As I made my way through the field, I started to feel a cold wetness run down my arm. I looked to see what it was but the darkness covered my entire body. Ignoring it I continued my walk to the house. The front porch was very clean, not a speck of dirt to be seen. Light from inside the house was illuminating the outside of the house now. It was the nicest house I had ever seen. I decided to take my chances an knock on the door.

I knocked three times until I heard a voice coming from the other side. “Coming. One knock will do dear.” Before I knew it the door swung open to reveal the owner of the house. My jaw dropped at what I had witnessed. A woman wearing a long dress stood before me but the part that scared me was the head. It was a rabbits head.

The rest of her body was human but from head to shoulders, it was a rabbit. “Oh dear, what are you doing outside so late at night? It’s not safe to be in the woods after dark.” I was puzzled on how she was speaking to me. Her mouth never moved, not once. “Please come inside.” To shocked to think properly, I made my way into the house.

She sat me down in her living room and looked me up and down. 
“What is your name young man. I am Ms. Peterson, the owner of this orphanage.?”

“I….I’m……Stephen. I’m sorry….ff…for intruding I have to get back home.”

“You can’t leave! This is your new home now. I will be taking care of you, along with the other children.”

“Other childer…”

“We do have some rules here. One,never come downstairs at night. You are new to my home so I will allow it this one time. Two, always eat what I prepare. Three,never step foot in my garden. You only get one mistake per month. If you disobey me twice, then you will have to be punished.”

I nodded and agreed to her terms. I wanted to go home but my exit was blocked. I couldn’t just run into the forest without knowing where I was first. She showed me around the house and where I would be sleeping. I saw Three other children wrapped up in their beds. She asked me not to wake them and pick out a bed. I made my way to the mattress and sat down to process everything that has happened. “Follow my rules dear and you will love it here. It will get easier.” I rested my head down and tried to pretend that I was asleep. She finally closed the door and everything went quiet. 

About ten minutes later I felt parched and got up to get a glass of water. “Don’t move” a voice said from across the room. It was one of the kids.
“Why? I just wanted to get some water.”

“She will hear you.”

“I don’t care. I’m thirsty and i don’t wanna be here!”

My shouting alarmed the kid and they slumped back down and threw the covers over themself. I looked confused at the moment until I hear footsteps marching down the hall. I froze in place as the marching grew closer. The door flew open as Ms. Peterson stood in the door way. Her ears were twitching as she looked at me from across the room. 
“I told you my rules and you deliberately disobeyed them.”

“I…I’m sorry I was just….thirsty.”

“My rules are set and you agreed to them. Since you think my words are false, I will show you what happens when you break my rules.”

She stormed across the room and grabbed me by the collar of my shirt. I kicked and screamed trying to break free from her grasp but it was too strong. She dragged me out of the room and into her kitchen. I was slammed onto a table and held down by my head. I was crying and screaming for someone to help me but no one came to my rescue. She reached for knife that was sitting on the table. She grabbed my hand and drove the knife deep into my skin. Screaming in agony, I tried to get my hand unstuck from the table. She walked away for a moment and I thought this was my chance. 

I kept trying to pull the knife out, but no luck. She came back to the the table with a clever knife, holding it above my hand. She grabbed my ring finger and slowly started cutting into my flesh. Ms.Peterson kept driving the knife deeper and deeper until my finger was released from my hand. I fell hard onto the ground, writhing in pain as blood gushed from the knob on my hand.

“I know mistakes happen and I forgive you my child. Break my rules again and you will be punished severely.”
