I fell through a hurricane of broken memories.

My body stretched, snapped, stitched back together wrong. Voices shrieked and sobbed across the darkness. Colors tore through me like glass.

Pain, I could handle.

Pain was simple.

This... this was something worse.

I fought to stay afloat, but the void dragged me under, its pull like an event horizon.

The dark began to bleed—sickly red, like a dying sun. The wind carried a smell I knew too well: autumn rot. Fading leaves. Dust and grief.

I stopped falling. I stopped flying.

I arrived.

Home.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Crooked House loomed, an impossible carcass of wood and stone, stitched together around a pale, dying tree. Its towers sagged outward like broken limbs. Its windows stared blankly, like wounded eyes stitched up with boards.

And at its heart, rising higher than the roof itself, grew the Wither Tree, its bark bleached bone-white against the bleeding sky.

I had never seen the House from outside.

And now, it had seen me.

The Ma'am's fingers clamped around my wrist, cold as iron.

Without a word, she dragged me forward, across the cracked stone path, past thorn-choked gardens.

Toward the trees.

Toward the waiting maw of the Thousand Acre Wood.

“Can I at least bring a lantern?” I pleaded. 

“Course you can’t,” she said, wrenching me into the trees. “You’d just drop it when you died and burn the whole wood down, wouldn’t you?”

The deeper we went, the more the sunset faded. The forest swallowed the glow in greedy gulps. Branches knotted above like clenched fingers while roots snarled beneath the path like coiled rope. The air turned thick. 

I swear I heard laughter. High, bright. Childlike. 

Only it was wrong. Sanded down to a raw edge. Like the joy had been boiled off, leaving only the sound of teeth behind.

Soon, it was only the Ma’am’s lantern lighting the way, flickering dimly like it knew it didn’t belong out here.

“How deep are we going?” I whispered.

“Deep enough that you’ll never find your way out,” she said.

A sound cracked the air. A snarl. Then a low, wet whine.

Something moved in the trees. I whipped my head around, caught glimpses of it. Shapes in the dark. Snouts. Jaws. Bones.

“I think a Hungry Thing’s following us,” I stammered.

The Ma’am smiled, slow and dark. “Oh yes. There’s more than one. A whole family is out there—your family. Your miserable brothers and sisters, other disobedient brats devoured by the wood.”

My chest ached. So that’s what Gran had meant when she told the Ma’am I wasn’t another of her monsters. Deep down, she knew I wasn’t a boy. That I wasn’t even a story. That I was just another Hungry Thing wearing a mask.  

The branches groaned above us, and from the shadows, something stepped out.

It was tall. Slouched. Furred.

Its body was stretched like melted wax. Limbs too thin. Spine too bent. A pig snout jutted from its face, twitching with each breath. But its teeth… they weren’t right. Long. Curved. Sharp as keys.

And its eyes—God, its eyes. Not two. Not human. A cluster of them. A whole web. All of them blinking at once, like spider hatchlings.

I stumbled backward.

The Ma’am’s hand shot out and grabbed a fistful of my hair. Held me in place.

“Not another step,” she said softly. “Not unless you want it to gobble you up.”

The creature loomed closer. Bones crackled in its limbs with each movement, like someone reassembling it wrong with every step. Its snout sniffed. It crouched low.

And then it spoke.

The voice was wrong. It sounded like a little girl who’d been dragged face-first through gravel.

It sounded like… 

“Gretchin?” I whimpered, horror seizing my lungs. 

The Ma’am knelt beside me. Her arm draped across my shoulders, light as silk and cold as a blade. “You recognize your sister, do you, Boy? Good. This is what failed drafts become after they’re devoured by the wood. It’s what you’ll become.”

She leaned in. Whispered in my ear. 

“Do you know what it sounded like? Listening to your older sister get chewed alive by these very trees?” She smiled. Not smug but fond, like she was remembering an old family recipe. “It sounded wet. Noisy. Perfect.”

I slammed my eyes shut.

I couldn’t look. Couldn’t breathe.

Gretchin sighed. “Ma’am not bring… Food…”

Then, with a final snap of twisting bone, my older sister straightened. Her snout turned toward the dark. Sniffed. And just like that, she was gone. Swallowed by the forest again.

I collapsed to my knees. “Please…” I begged, clutching the hem of her dress. “Please don’t leave me here. I promise I’ll be good. I’ll be good.”

She looked down at me with mock surprise. Then crouched. Cupped my cheek.

“Yes,” she said gently. “You had better.”

Her thumb traced the spot where she’d struck me earlier. “Because I’m a kind woman, I’ll give you one more chance. That’s it. Break another rule… and I’ll feed you to your sister. Am I clear?”

I nodded so fast it hurt.

She turned. “Then come.”

I followed, and the forest watched us. I could feel it. Every branch an eyelid. Every shadow a snare.

“Why did Gretchin turn into that?” I asked. The question fell out of me before I could stop it.

To my surprise, the Ma’am didn’t look angry. She looked… pleased. “Because I gave the girl hunger, then let her starve. That’s the trick, Boy.”

She twirled as she walked, like a child in a summer field. Her dress flared around her like black petals. “Monsters born from want never stop chewing.”

She glanced back at me, grin widening. “This whole wood is full of my monsters. And just like I did to them, I can end your story any time I please. *Remember that.*”

By the time we reached the Crooked House, the sun had fled.

The sky bled purple and black as the silhouette of that shambling monstrosity rose before us. It loomed like a gravestone. Jagged, enormous. An omen of death. 

The Ma’am said nothing. Just unlatched the door, pushed me inside, and locked it behind us.

There was no supper. No voice. No mercy.

She shoved me down the hall and into my room. It was a closet in everything but name.

Peeling wallpaper.

Mold on the ceiling.

A rotted mattress that oozed when I sat on it.

A single slot window sat near the ceiling, boarded tight. I used to think it was to keep me in. Now I knew better.

It was to keep them out.

The door locked behind me with a sound like finality.

Click. Clack. Slide.

And then I was alone. Alone with the dark.

I curled into a ball, wrapping the moth-eaten blanket around myself like a bandage. The room smelled like mildew and fear. Outside, I heard the woods whisper.

The Hungry Things hadn’t gone far.

Their sounds rose through the night: snorts, snarls, bones cracking in the trees. Sometimes laughter. Sometimes chewing. Always near. Always waiting.

And Gretchen… 

The thought of my older sister broke my heart. I curled up, cried. Quietly. Not sobbing—just the kind of crying where the body leaks and trembles.

I didn’t want the Ma’am to hear.

I didn’t want her to remember I even existed.

I must’ve drifted off because at some point later the lock clicked. 

My body tensed.

The hinges creaked. The door whined open. Then came footsteps. Slow. Uneven.

The floorboard groaned beside my bed.

I clenched my eyes shut. Held still. The Ma’am. Had she changed her mind—decided to drag me back into the Thousand Acre Woods after all?

Maybe if I looked asleep she’d go away.

Maybe she’d think I’d learned my lesson.

Then—hands in my hair. But they were gentle. Fingers ran through my tangled curls, soft and shaky. A touch full of care. Lips pressed to my scalp. A kiss. Featherlight.

Not the Ma’am. Couldn’t be. 

A woman’s voice rasped. Worn, weak—but unmistakable. “Happy birthday, Levi.”

Carol…

The words broke me. I didn’t move. I couldn’t. The door creaked closed again, and when I rolled over, something waited on the floor beside my mattress.

A teddy bear.

Hand-sewn. Lopsided. Beautiful.

Its button eyes caught the moonlight bleeding through the boards. It looked like it had been stitched together from old blankets and worn-out clothes. Like love had held it together more than thread. I pulled it to my chest and held it tight.

It didn’t feel like fabric. It felt like armor.

Like safety.

Like someone still saw me as something worth saving. And for the first time I could remember, I fell asleep not as a brat or a monster or a failed draft. But as Levi. 

A boy who was loved. 

# _______________________________

The memory burned away, taking with it the love, the warmth, the teddy bear. 

Giving me madness in return. 

Fractured worlds spun around me—shards of shattered dimensions tumbling through a black void. Portals clawed at my skin, my bones, my name, each one a gaping maw desperate to rewrite me into something else. I wasn't falling through space, I was being yanked apart by stories, each one howling to claim me.

Then *crack*.

A bang

A *Big Bang*. 

The portals collapsed inward. The fractured planets folded like dying lungs. And I dropped, headfirst through a gullet of time and ink, falling into a universe reborn.

I blinked. Above me stretched a red-brick alley that reached impossibly high, its walls touching a sky smeared with midnight and madness. Lightning tore across it, but the thunder that followed didn’t rumble—it screamed.

“It is done.”

The voice buzzed like a hive, layered and insectile, vibrating. Where, I couldn't properly place.

“Yes,” answered a second, similarly implacable voice. “It would seem the Shuffle proved successful.”

It spoke slower, words slurred through reversed syllables, like poetry played backward on broken vinyl. I’d heard it before, once, in the tunnels beneath the Sub-Vaults, when the Jack of Clubs had taken me past the Spades. I hadn’t understood it then.

Now I could.

Why?

Sirens bled into the air, pulsing like a failing heartbeat: **“WARNING. WARNING. MASS-CONTAINMENT BREACH.”**

Shit.

Not good.

“The False Dealer has lost command of the Deck,” buzzed the first voice. 

“By the grace of Mother, our authority returns.”

Adrenaline yanked me upright. My breath tore in and out like a blade. The Shuffle. The Hearts had done it then. They’d fed me to the storm. They’d used me—the second Joker—to collapse the Deck. 

**“ALL PERSONNEL ARE TO INITIATE LOCKDOWN PROTOCOLS. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”**

The storm above cracked again, and somewhere deep inside, I felt something unravel. Like a knot I hadn’t known was keeping me alive had just been cut.

If there was a mass containment breach, that meant a bloodbath. Conscripts would be spilling down these halls soon enough, which meant I needed to—

Something stepped out from behind me.

An Overseer, but not like any I’d seen before. No porcelain. No mournful eyes. Just a chitinous carapace, mirrored and gleaming, with insectile mandibles that clicked with thought. Translucent wings draped from its back like a funeral shroud.

“The Joker stirs,” it buzzed.

Its chest bore a card: 5 of Diamonds. Its chakram gleamed like a spinning sawblade, holstered across its spine. Diamonds were record keepers. Redactors. The kind of Overseer that decided whether corrupted narratives—urban legends, creepy pastas and the like—were archived, rewritten as Conscripts, or erased outright. Diamonds edited reality with surgical violence.

Footsteps echoed behind it. Heavier. Human-shaped. Almost. If humans were eight feet tall. 

A second figure emerged, draped in funeral-black armor so sleek it might have been lacquered in ink. An angular helm obscured its face, but the spade-headed spear in its grip was unmistakable. A vivisection tool masquerading as a weapon.

The card on its breastplate read: 10 of Spades. The most powerful rank the Deck contained. At least, outside of the Jack. 

It stepped forward with solemn grace and knelt before me, like a priest preparing last rites. “The Joker’s purpose has been achieved,” it intoned, the words twisted like metal. “The Deck has been fractured. Our kin are now free of the False Dealers’ control.”

“Recommended action?” buzzed the 5.

The 10 of Spades tilted its head. “Purge the variant. Prevent further disruption.”

And just like that, I was prey again.

I shot down the corridor.

No plan. No map. Just pure, terrified momentum. My boots slapped against wet metal. Lightning split the sky above. The alley buckled and stretched like it couldn’t decide which story it belonged to.

Behind me came the soft buzz of wings. The 5 of Diamonds rose like a hornet from hell, chakram hissing free from its back. It zipped ahead, dropping from the sky to block my path.

I skidded to a halt.

“Remain still,” it chittered, raising its blade. “Your purging will be cleaner.”

A voice, syrup-thick, drifted from the alley’s shadows: “Yoo-hoo.”

The 5 stiffened.

Out of the gloom came something older than nightmares. Mister Neither stepped into the half-light like a wraith wearing a skin suit. His coat dragged behind him in tatters, stitched together with scraps of flesh that didn’t belong to him. In one hand, he held a bouquet of blood-slick pocket-watches—the kind issued only to Inquisitors. A trophy collection.

He’d been busy.

The 5 of Diamonds froze. Buzzed. “Variant identified: Joker.”

The 10 of Spades advanced. “Then we have acquired the Pair. Finish purging the first. I will handle the second.”

Mister Neither giggled. His head tilted just a little too far. “Oh no, no, no, no. I’m not the copycat. I’m the original.”

The laugh twisted into a snarl.

“And that’s my toy you’re playing with.”

He charged on all fours, an animal out for blood. 

No preamble. No wind-up. Just motion. A blur of fur, claws, and teeth. The 10 swung its spear to intercept, but Mister Neither collided with it mid-strike, knocking the Overseer off-balance. A claw raked across the 10’s helm, peeling back the armored plating like fruit skin. Beneath, flesh pulsed, wet and unfinished.

The 10 retaliated with mechanical precision. It drove an elbow into Mister Neither’s temple. The Hatter reeled. The spear came up again and slammed into his jaw with a bone-rattling crunch.

Behind me, the chakram sang through the air.

I threw myself sideways just in time. The spinning blade carved a molten line through the sewer grating beside me. The 5 of Diamonds landed, wings humming, already preparing the next strike.

I dodged again, lunging to my feet.

An idea bloomed mid-sprint. Stupid, desperate, maybe fatal. But if I could pull the 5 into the fight… maybe Mister Neither wouldn’t be the only one bleeding. It might give me time to escape. 

Yes! That could—

My excitement deflated into shock. The fight was already over. 

The 10 of Spades loomed above Mister Neither, spear raised for the kill. 

“Farewell, Brother.”

Mister Neither lay sprawled, jaw cracked and bloodied. For the first time, he looked hurt. Then he smiled.

“You took the words right outta my mouth.”

The spear came down.

So did the facade.

In one brutal movement, Mister Neither snapped the spear’s tip in half and drove it into the 10’s fractured helm. Ink geysered from the wound. The 10 staggered, armor failing, knees buckling.

Mister Neither buried his hand in its chest. “I do so love my plot twists.” He fished through pulsing organs like he was searching for spare change.

Then he found it.

He wrenched free something slick and glowing. “Speaking of,” he murmured, lifting it like a trader  appraising a vintage. “I believe I've found your Plot Device.”

Behind me, the wings stopped.

The 5 of Diamonds hovered midair, paralyzed. It had just witnessed something unthinkable: the murder of a 10. An elite rank. A pillar of the Deck. And now—

Mister Neither bit into the heart.

The 10 of Spades let out a sound halfway between a scream and a prayer. Then it exploded. A wave of ink and ruin rolled outward, rattling the alley, blotting the sky.

Mister Neither licked the residue from his claws. Only they'd changed. Obsidian armor rippled across them now, their tips forming jagged spades. 

His eyes—twin beams behind the tophat’s veil—found the 5 of Diamonds, and a new light flickered into existence, burning through the fabric like a third eye.

“Getting the picture, Brother?” he asked, voice bright with madness. “I’m going to eat the Deck. One of every suit. I’m going to become exactly what that stupid girl dreamed of turning into.”

“You’ll never become the Ace,” hissed the 5. “You’re a broken narrative. A torn card. You’ll be purged before—”

A spear bloomed through its chest.

The Spade’s.

Mister Neither had called it back like a loyal hound.

It ripped through the 5’s thorax. Glowed with stolen power. Then retracted just as fast—dragging with it another twitching Plot Device. He plucked it from the blade like meat off a skewer and swallowed it whole.

The third eye pulsed brighter. A chakram erupted from his back like a diamond buzzsaw. He staggered forward, hunched, no longer able to properly stand upright, a manic grin on his face. 

He exhaled.

“Delicious.”

Then turned to me. “Two suits down. Two to go.”

He wasn’t just growing stronger. He was becoming coherent. That was the scariest part—that he wasn’t nonsense anymore. That he had a plan. A purpose. 

A climax.

“Now then,” Mister Neither whispered, voice slick with anticipation. “Where were we?”

He snapped his fingers.

Reality blinked.

The storm-wracked alley was gone.

In its place: the circular chamber I knew too well. Pale stone walls. A single metal table. And upon it, like a wound that never closed, sat the rusted typewriter.

We were back.

Chamber 13.

Only now, it was different.

The ceiling gaped open, revealing the familiar moon beyond—but no longer round and laughing. Its eyes were now hollowed craters. Black ichor dripped from its bisected smile, spilling down onto the keys of the machine like cosmic blood. The typewriter twitched with every drop, shuddering.

I backed away from it.

From him.

“Why are you doing all of this?” I demanded. My voice came out smaller than I meant. Frail. The voice of a boy. 

Mister Neither crouched beside me, bloodied pocket-watches jingling at his waist. “Cause I wanna fix my ending,” he said simply. “And the key to making this stupid machine work…”

His claw tapped my temple. Once. Twice. Harder the third time.

“Is buried in there.”

Realization struck like a thunderclap.

The Ma’am.

The Wither Tree. The typewriter. The stories she carved from pain. From me. From Gretchen. From Carol and the Woodsman and every broken child she fed to the Crooked House.

“You want to know how she did it,” I whispered, heart folding in on itself. “You want to know how she used the typewriter. To write. To create.”

His grin widened.

“It was never me you wanted,” I croaked. “Just my worst memories.”

Mister Neither’s fingers closed around my skull, vice-like and tender at once. His strobing eyes pulsed like dying stars. “Wrong again,” he whispered. “Those weren’t your worst memories.”

His thumbs dug deeper. “Just the worst so far.”

Then: *snap*.

Not bone. Not sound.

But the world.

It cracked.

Fractured like a spine caught in the middle of a laugh. Everything fell away, stone, typewriter, and sky. I was pulled backward, screaming, through a door I’d locked long ago. Into a memory I’d buried in shadow. Into the moment she showed me the cost of creation.

The price of making a story real.

The moment the Ma’am taught me what it meant to bleed on the page.

The Ma’am’s voice reached through the light like a dagger through silk. *“Carol gave you a birthday gift, did she, Boy? Well, it’s only proper I give you one too.”*

Not this.

I fought the memory. Clawed at the vision, pushed back with everything I had.

Her voice sharpened, closer now, like nails on glass. “*I always told you you’d die a violent death, you ungrateful little swine. Let me show you what I meant.”*

**NO!**

The scream ripped from my throat. The light shattered. I dangled in the Hatter’s grip—sweating, heaving, wild-eyed.

He stared at me, expression twisted with a snarl. “What... did you just *do*?” 

I didn’t know. 

Something inside me had pulsed. Like a thread pulled taut. Like a key turning in a lock I didn’t know I had. I’d resisted the Hatter’s magic.

The Joker card burned in my pocket, softly thrumming against my leg. 

Did it have something to do with it?

Was I more powerful than I realized?

The Hatter clamped both over-sized claws around my skull. His breath hit my cheek in gusts that smelled like old paper soaked in rot. “You’re stubborn. But you’ll break. *Everything breaks*.”

And then came the pain.
