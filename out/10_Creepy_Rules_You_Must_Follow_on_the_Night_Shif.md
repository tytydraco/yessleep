[www.youtube.com/watch?v=v58pbDEBS68](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v58pbDEBS68)When I arrived at the gas station for my first shift.

The place looked pretty normal.

It was one of those independent branded gas stations.

Called a generic Star Gasoline and clearly family-owned.

It was a bit run down, but serviceable.

And only one car was pumping gas at the time.

The gas tanks were illuminated by a single

yellow light hanging in the middle

It cast shadows in all four directions.

Like a compass dial.

The actual convenience store portion of the

was typical.

The glass windows were plastered with sun.

bleached advertisements for cigarettes.

Energy drinks and two hot dogs for 99 cents.

Deal.

A bell rang as I pushed open the door.

the convenience store door.

and was greeted by the smell of

slightly old hot dogs

that had been sitting under a heat lamp all day.

I looked over.

I saw that there was no one at the counter.

but a lady who looked like she was in her 50s

waved at me from the back of the store as she was

sweeping up.

The store was a bit larger than a typical

gas station convenience store.

The interior was what you would expect, except for one thing.

There was a clock and an old

and an old TV screen lined up on each side of the room.

showing security camera footage of the gas pumps.

It seemed unnecessary.

Also.

The owners did not aim the security cameras very well.

and it was mostly footage of the

between the gas pumps in the store.

Instead of centering the gas pumps in the middle.

Hi there.

You must be Alex.

I was taken out of my thoughts and looking forward.

I know my husband originally interviewed you.

We've been trying to find someone to do the

night shift for months.

And I dare say I'm getting too old to stay up so late.

But you're young, so you'll be fine.

She wiped her hands on her trousers.

before reaching out to shake mine.

I'm Ann, nice to meet you.

You can put your things behind the counter.

and I'll show you around.

I know you've worked at a gas station before.

So I won't bore you.

We just needed someone who could follow directions.

directions.

The little lady moved fast for someone her size.

She seemed eager to get me started so she could

finally go home and enjoy a normal sleep schedule.

Cleaning supplies are back here in this closet.

Mops and brooms are on the left.

The bathroom is on the right.

It's just a single toilet room.

I looked inside.

The bathroom was just

exactly what I expected a

gas station bathroom to look like.

The walls were all scratched up by druggies.

probably scribbling their initials all over them.

And the tiles had a nasty brown stain from years of use.

But at least it smelled clean.

like bleach

And there was hand soap.

which wasn't always a

guarantee when I used a gas station bathroom.

I'll give you a list of cleaning chores later.

and when to do them.

since you're closing up.

Finally, she led me back to the front.

Showed me how to use the cash register

and the debit card machine.

And we were almost done.

She reached into her pockets and pulled out a set of keys.

These are the keys to lock up.

One for the front door and one for the back door.

Next to her chair at the register.

There's a yellow list of cleaning chores.

The most important one is the red one.

She pointed to the

Bright red paper next to the cash register.

Read it and memorize it.

and you'll have no problems.

Thank you, I'll read it.

Did you bring a good watch like I told you?

Yes, I did.

Even though it looks like you have so many watches in here.

I feel like I don't really

Do you need this watch to tell the time?

Oh, no, you'll definitely need it.

Trust me, you have another one, hmm?

15 minutes before your shift starts.

Go sit down and start working on some of these assignments.

And keep it with you for a few days.

You'll know them by heart soon enough.

I don't need it anymore, I learned it fast.

She picked up her bags from behind the counter and left.

There were no more customers.

And it was relatively quiet.

It was almost 10 p.m.

There weren't even any

cars passing by on the road outside this small town.

I looked outside again at the lone gas station light.

It flickered occasionally in the distance.

The light illuminated long

long shadows of the gas pumps.

All four shadows were cast in the same

direction towards the convenience store.

Almost as if they were crawling toward the building.

Parallel.

I picked up the two instruction sheets.

Both were laminated and printed on card stock.

and a little dirty from use.

probably because

many employees had to refer to them often.

The yellow sheet didn't seem all that interesting.

Just a lot of mundane tasks.

like mopping up and taking out the

at the end of the night.

The red sheet, however, had blocks of text on it.

Welcome to Star Gas Station.

This is your night shift handbook.

Please follow all instructions carefully.

It is important that you are on time.

and provide the quality of service that our customers have come to

have come to expect, even during the late night hours.

We seek peace and harmony with our neighbors.

Day and night

A clean store with busy employees is a happy and

busy store

Spend most of your time

in the lighted part of the store

Unless otherwise necessary

Half of the lights are always off

3

Turn off half the lights in the store before 10 p.m.

It does not

It does not matter which half of the store you keep lit.

But whatever you choose

Keep it that way for the rest of the night.

If you turn off all the lights

It makes the store look closed.

You will need the unlit part of the store later.

When you need to use the bathroom

Keep the door

cracked so that you can

During the night

You may notice puddles of water

and heavy dust on the floor and

and table surfaces in various locations.

Try to clean them up if you can.

with the mops and dusters provided.

Puddles and

Puddles and dust make the store look abandoned and unkempt

and attract attention.

A clean store is a happy store.

We recommend

Patrolling the store occasionally to check for water

or dust that you may have overlooked.

Remember to check the employee break room.

6

At approximately 12:00 a

m or earlier, prepare the mop bucket with water and soap.

At 1205

Go to the back of the store

to the refrigerated beverage aisle

and mop the aisle continuously until 12

25 a.m.

Do not leave this aisle or stop mopping

until the specified time

For any reason

You may feel that something is watching you

and a strong desire to leave the hallway and hide.

Do not give in to this urge.

Act normal and show no signs of fear.

You may walk back and forth down the

the aisle until the time is up.

Management recommends that you keep your head down.

Keep an eye on your watch.

and wear headphones with music to help you

Block out sound

The quality of your mopping is not important.

What is important is that you look busy at work.

On the walls next to the cache

Register is a camera feed from the backlot.

This is different from the other camera feeds.

You do not need to check this feed too often.

Just once every 30 minutes.

At the top and bottom of the hour

At any time during the night.

If you see a shadowy figure

standing in front of the camera feed

and stares directly at you into the camera

calmly and slowly duck under the counter

so that you can no longer

We call him Fred.

Wait 5 minutes and use the provided compact mirror.

under the cache register

to check indirectly if Fred is still there.

If he is still there

Continue checking every 5 minutes until he leaves.

8

This will only happen if you have not been

busy enough

or if the store is dirty.

You can see Fred standing right

at the front of the grocery store.

If so

Stop what you are doing and do not acknowledge his presence.

his presence, but calmly

Crouch behind one of the aisles in the unlit section.

and make noise by rearranging and moving

snack bags and drinks around.

Do not get up again.

You want him to hear you.

Not see you.

He will not want to bother you if you seem busy.

You can look through the shelves to see if he is still there.

there, but be careful.

Last but not least

These are the main rules.

We usually only have one local neighbor, Fred.

to visit every night.

But on very rare unfortunate occasions

there are more of them.

Unfortunately

Only Fred is relatively harmless.

As long as you obey the rules.

The other foreign visitors are not.

There are several

TV monitors on all walls of the store

If at any time in the parking lot

you see the four

shadows of the

pump all pointing in the same direction.

This is a bad omen.

It means that out-of-town visitors are nearby.

And it is best to leave.

10

You have a few minutes.

Drop what you are doing.

Run to the staff back room and find a large

light switch panel on the back wall.

Turn off each

switch to cut off all power to the store.

This will make the store look closed.

And the visitors can leave.

to look for another establishment.

This upsets Fred, who is a local.

But it

helps to keep out-of-town visitors from coming in.

Enter the storage room on the right.

Lock and bolt the door.

Put your phone on silent and send Anna a text message.

Do not try to leave.

Several visitors can enter the store.

Fred will

Fred will also enter the store now that it appears to be closed.

But he should not find you if you stay still.

You can take a nap for the rest of the night.

As long as you do not snore.

If all goes well

We will pick you up in the morning.

and pay you triple your pay for the trouble.

Ice ran through my fingers.

As I reread, one line stood out.

Panicked, I looked up at the nearest monitor.

and the shadows were so

elongated that they were basically

into the store.

But there were no shadowy figures inside.

yet

I started to shake.

There was no way this list was real.

But I clearly remembered

the shadows being in a compass formation

When I first arrived

The sun had already set.

and unless this singular

could somehow shift positions

there is no way to explain

explain the shadows suddenly changing to stand

parallel to each other.

Blood drained from my face.

And I looked at the clock.

It had taken me a while to read the list.

But maybe I had a minute left.

Brake room, back wall panel, storage room.

Medallion and lock.

Call Anne, then keep quiet.

I sprinted out from behind the counter.

and ran to the back room.

I quickly found the light panel and

slammed my hands down on all the switches

and blacked out the store.

My hand fumbled for my cell phone flashlight.

as I grabbed the walls to find the storeroom door.

and pulled myself in.

I couldn't see a thing.

except for the narrow beam of my cell phone flashlight.

but I managed to lock the door with my

nervous fingers

Then I found boxes to hide behind.

My heart was pounding.

I wasn't sure if this was all a joke.

But it couldn't hurt to call Anne and ask her.

What on earth was going on?

I dialed her number

and heard the dial tone of a phone call.

I tried to get through.

I hope she picks up.

It seemed to take forever.

Hello?

I couldn't believe she actually picked up the phone.

I immediately asked her if the red instruction

was real.

in a stream of panicked words.

I also

explained the shadows that were all pointing in the same

direction towards the store

and demanded to know if I was in any real danger.

Sorry I didn't tell you, honey.

That last one almost never happens.

It has only

happened a couple of times in the last two years.

You were just really unlucky.

It seems like you did almost everything right, though.

I breathed a sigh of relief...
