I live in a five-story apartment complex, and my bathroom has an odd setup: one mirror faces another, creating an infinity effect. One of the mirrors is part of the medicine cabinet. When you look into one, the reflections seem to stretch endlessly, like they’re pulling you into some otherworldly void. I’ve lived here for almost two years now—just me and my daughter—and those mirrors have always made me feel uneasy. There’s this strange, almost unreal sensation when I look into them, like I’m slipping out of reality. Maybe it’s a kind of depersonalization, but whatever it is, it’s unsettling.

When I stare too long, it stops feeling like I’m looking at my own reflection. Instead, it feels like someone else is staring back at me—someone who knows far too much about me. It gives me the creeps.

This morning, something felt especially off. As I moved my head slightly, I noticed that one of the reflections—about the ninth one back—was delayed. It didn’t move in sync with the others. For a split second, it just stood there, watching, before catching up. I brushed it off. Sleep deprivation can play tricks on your mind, and having a newborn means I’m running on fumes most of the time.

That night, after putting my daughter back to bed for the third time, I went to the bathroom again. It happened again—but this time, the delay was closer. Around the fifth reflection. It was far more noticeable. My stomach dropped, and a cold wave of fear washed over me. I realized I’ve always felt uneasy around mirrors, though I never gave it much thought before. I remembered a time years ago when I was tripping and stared into a mirror for what felt like hours. Ever since then, I haven’t been the same. Mirrors don’t feel like mere glass to me—they feel like doorways. And whatever’s on the other side... I don’t want to know.

The next night was quiet—until 3 a.m. I woke up to feed my daughter. After putting her back to bed, I headed to the bathroom. That’s when I heard it. A low, hollow thump from behind the medicine cabinet. The sound made me freeze. My heart started pounding, and before I could talk myself out of it, I swung the mirror open.

What I saw wasn’t the shelf of medicines I was expecting. There was no shelf. Instead, there was a gaping, dark hole that seemed to stretch back endlessly. And standing in the center of that void was a figure.

It looked just like me.

No, not exactly like me. Its features were unnaturally smooth, like it had been carved from porcelain. Its eyes were pitch black—deep, empty voids that seemed to swallow the dim bathroom light. It tilted its head, and the movement was accompanied by a sharp clicking sound, like bones snapping into place.

I slammed the cabinet shut so hard the mirror cracked. My hands were shaking as I ran down the hall to my daughter’s room. But when I opened the door, the crib was empty. She was gone.

Panic took over. My mind raced as I ran from room to room. Then I heard it—a sound that stopped me cold. Crying. It was coming from the living room. I bolted down the stairs and found her lying on the couch.

But something was wrong.

As I stepped closer, I realized it wasn’t her. It looked like her, but something was...off. Her movements were stiff, unnatural. The crying stopped abruptly as she turned to look at me. Her wide eyes glistened in the dim light. For a moment, we just stared at each other. Then she smiled—a slow, deliberate grin that sent chills down my spine.

I backed away, trembling, and before I could think of what to do, I blacked out.

The next morning, everything seemed normal again. My daughter was in her crib, cooing like nothing had happened. But there’s one thing I can’t shake. She’s developed a strange fascination with mirrors. She stares at them for hours, giggling and reaching out, like she’s playing with someone—or something—only she can see.
