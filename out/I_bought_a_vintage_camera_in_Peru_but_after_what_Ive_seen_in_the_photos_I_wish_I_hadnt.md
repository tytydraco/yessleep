I bought a cool-looking film camera in Lima, Peru at a second-hand shop. 



My best friend and I wandered around the city center and came across a street that sold second-hand clothing. The craziest looking collectable old toys and electronic shop was just a few blocks down from there. 



The place looked like the old garage of a hobbyist who was interested in vintage toys, old electronics, and weird keychains from 100 years ago. Everything was covered in dust, and it looked about as neat as a front yard rummage sale, and several glass cases were filled to the brim with vintage toys.  There were a few vendors inside this dusty strange place, and when I saw the vintage cameras in a case, I made a beeline for it.  



I had just gotten into film cameras and I was hoping to spot a camera to use for the duration of the trip. 



The cameras were sitting in an old aquarium tank, the green, yellow, and blue colored rocks on the bottom were layered with dust, as were the cameras. I pointed to a few that looked interesting, a red snappy Canon automatic, and a point-and-shoot Minolta caught my eye at first. 



My Spanish was terrible, so we communicated via body language. The woman showed me how the cameras worked, where to deposit the film, and the battery location.  I asked and mimed, “Do they work?” She nodded her head as if I was silly for asking her that. “Of course, all the cameras work,” she responded. Leaning forward on the glass aquarium case in front of the cameras she continued to pull out to show her stock. 



I picked up a chunky black Fujifilm camera. It looked like a small brick. I had been wanting a chunky camera and asked her about the price.  She held up her fingers to show $70 Peruvian soles, which was about $20 something USD. 



“Do not use film in camera,” she said pointing to the back of the Fujifilm camera.  “Do not use film,” she said again, tapping it with her long acrylic fingernail. 



“Okay,” I responded. “I won’t use the film inside.” she smiled and nodded. “$70 soles.”



I produced the money and met my friend outside. She got bored after a few cameras had been pulled out and was more interested in taking photos of the odd toys in the different cases.  We did a couple more hours of exploration, I found a battery that worked for the camera and bought some extra film to use in the camera.  



“Hey! Pose for the camera!” I said to my friend, aiming the camera in her direction.  



“Hold up – hell no, didn’t that lady say not to use that film in the camera? You're not about to steal my soul with that shit,” she said, getting up, and putting her hands in front of her like she was pushing an invisible box. 



“She probably meant the film is shitty and old, but fine I won’t use the camera to steal your soul,” I said jokingly pointing the camera at myself and snapping two photos of me holding up the peace sign before the camera made a sound that signaled I’d reach the end of the roll and it was rewinding the film inside the canister to be taken out and developed. 



I popped it out and replaced it with some 800 ISO film, the film that I preferred when I wanted to take cool photos at night. Night was coming, and I wanted to shoot a few photos of city life in Lima.  So before we went home I grabbed a couple shots, mostly how traffic looked at night, people walking under street lights, the coast line of Barranco was beautiful at night.  I used up the whole roll. 



The next day, with a quick google search I found a film developing shop nearby where we were staying and convinced my friend to take a little detour there before we started exploring for the day. I wanted to make sure the camera took good photos before I decided to take more photos.  I’d be annoyed if the photos turned out badly because the camera really wasn’t working well. 



The film shop was super basic, it consisted of mostly just a beat up white counter with an older gentleman who was running the place. The paint was peeling but it had a beautiful pink and purple flower motif that was faded around the perimeter of the shop, and looked like it needed a repaint about 10 years ago.  The sign boasted 1 hour of development time, so I pointed to the sign that produced the shot film rolls and the money to pay for both to film canisters. 



My friend raised an eyebrow at the two film canisters on the counter top. I knew she was silently judging me for not only using the film but developing it too.  



I shrugged, I wanted to know what was on the old roll, I’d done it before with old thrift cameras and seen interesting photos. Why would this one not be much different? 



We went about our day in the city, checking out the coastline, doing our own walking tour and having the best Peruvian lomo saltado ever. My friend stayed in after lunch to rest, and chat with her partner; while I took a detour back to the shop to pick up my film. 



The shop owner recognized me and pushed two sets of paper envelopes to me that held both the photos from each of the films I shot. 



I sat down on a bench outside at a nearby park, before heading home to check out the photos. I pulled out the prints from the film that was previously shot in the old camera.  A few photos were unreadable, probably because the back of the camera had been opened before the film was developed, the rest were fine. 



The photos from the old camera were first. 



It looked like a photo of a grand family dinner. People were sitting around a dark wood oak table, with pink and purple floral decorated ceramic plates, basic chrome silverware.  There was plenty of food on the table, and also on the plates. There were smiles all around, but something felt strange about the photos.  It seemed to be shot with 800 iso film, dark film too, which I didn’t initially notice but the people were in pitch black dark, the light source was candles on the table mostly and the flash from the camera. 



I flipped through a couple more photos and then realized I didn’t see any kids, maybe it wasn’t a family? 



All adults were all wearing a white top with pink and purple floral patterns, a design that matched the plates, purple pink and white flowers painted on beautifully.  Something was starting to feel unnerving about this dinner. Like something was scratching my brain in the most uncomfortable way.  Then I saw it. 



The meat, it wasn’t normal.  It didn’t look like the meat I’d been accustomed to.  Was it a horse? There were cloven hooves with five segments on one of the plates in the center with coily dark hair still on it.  There was some inky dark meat that looked like someone had taken a sledgehammer to it on another platter.  There was a stack of three fingered hands lined neatly on a plate, gold and silver jewelry still on them. There was a bowl of what I thought were boiled eggs, but on closer look it seemed that they were eyeballs. 



As I continued through the photos the smiles actually looked strained. The eyes were wide open and almost sad. I think I saw a tear rolling down the cheek of one of the men.  Their smiles looked like someone was pulling a taut string across their cheeks, as all teeth were showing for everyone. I realized that the collar of my shirt was soaking wet, I felt a cool breeze on my neck but I couldn’t look away from the images. 



As I continued the photos showed some dark shadow near the head of the table. It was taller and much bulkier than the people sitting down, it seemed humanoid but wrong.  Its arms were longer than human limbs, there were pale grey fingers with more joints than ours that protruded from the robe, golden rings on each finger.  The body looked swollen and bulky underneath the white robe. It was donning a golden crown. 



I was trying to make out the face but I couldn't. Then, I saw the crown move, the thing tilted its head in my direction.   My brain was starting to swim, my head was starting to hurt, and I felt the sweat rolling down my back. 



I dropped the photos on the ground at that point, my hands were shaking and when I looked up it was already night time.  How long was I looking at the photos?  I didn’t even get to see the ones that I took. But I didn’t want to, it was late and I needed to get back to the apartment. 



My heart was beating quickly. I put the photos back in my bag and headed back to our hotel.  I feel like I heard strange whispers in my ear, but I think it was just my nerves, there were so many sounds in the city.  



I opened the door to our hotel and knocked on my best friend's door.  I didn’t want to expose her to whatever shit I just saw with the first camera roll, so I tucked those prints away in my bag. 



“Janice, do you mind if we look at these photos together.  Can I come in?” 



“Come in,” she said. “And don’t bring that creepy camera in my space,” she said.  I left the camera on the dining room table and headed back to her room.   



“Let's look at the pics I took last night,” I said, pushing the photos towards her. 



Janice picked them up and flipped through the photos with confusion, and disturbance running across her face. 

“We need to go to the police,” Janice said, pushing the photos back towards me.



I was confused, I didn’t look at the second roll of photos I shot.  I flipped through a couple.  The first ones were normal.  City lights. Skyline moments, then I saw something odd. 



Underneath the city lights sitting on a bench was a woman in the same floral pants and shirt that were in the photos I saw at the park.  I continued on, a few people riding light-up bikes that I took, one of them folks on the bike was wearing a white floral uniform.  



The selfie that I took outside the day I got the camera came up next. There was a barely visible shadowy figure behind me in the distance, and I swear it had a gold glint on top of what it was its head. 



Then I saw what Janice meant about the police, there were photos I didn’t take in the roll. There was a photo of a pale hand reaching out of the closet in my bedroom of our Lima apartment, a picture of me taking a shower, my back turned to the camera, a photo of Janice and myself walking into a thrift store and talking to the women I bought the camera from. 



I looked at Janice and the moment I did I heard the unmistakable click of the camera from behind me.  I turned around and saw it on the console table in Janice’s room, but I know I left it on the dining room table. 



“Dude, I said I didn’t want that creepy shit in here,” Janice said. 



“I-I thought I left it on the dining room table,” I responded. 



“We’re going to the police,” Janice said again, standing up.
