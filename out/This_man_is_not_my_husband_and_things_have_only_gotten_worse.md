You'll need context for this, so here's the [first part.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1harbbb/this_man_is_not_my_husband/)

Comments in the first post have asked very good questions. Is Christopher an alien, a robot, an empty husk. Truthfully, I still don't know, and I don't know what's scarier. The not knowing, or finding out the truth.

The months have passed in the way a day can. Slow, syrupy, agonizing, the clock on the wall refusing to move. Yet dizzying and quick, each moment forgotten in the next. Time has not made things easier.

Disclaimer, if there are any typos or mistakes, it’s because I’m typing this out on mobile in a chair on the porch while my husband is asleep in bed. I’m really hoping I can finish this in one sitting. For those of you who recall, I made a post about the odd circumstances

Christopher, my husband, is maintaining the charade around our son Bry so easily that it makes me question if that night outside the bathroom had ever even happened. Every so often, I catch him looking at me in a way he never has before. Neither drunkenly, nor sober and renewed by Regen Services. Unreadable and blank. Even his old rages didn’t make me shiver the way these stares do. He doesn’t look at Bryan this way, and I hope that just means that Christopher is less inclined to keep up the appearance of a normal man. This is impossible; the old Christopher was never this kind and charismatic. Everyone has noticed.

Friends are chalking it up to his recovery from his previous “incident.” A stroke, which sent him through a glass window from the upstairs, and paralyzed him from the neck down from the impact with the ground. We’re pretending that he got some breakthrough spinal and neurological surgery. Who would question the recovery of a man so deathly ill and suddenly back from the brink? I, however, cannot stop questioning it.

Regen Services had myself, my parents, my in-laws, even Bry, sign a contract of total silence — letting it slip what the procedure entailed would involve a massive lawsuit we could never afford to recover from. We all understood. Cloning was hardly a stable procedure, and after the free service they provided we weren’t in a place to bite the hand that fed us.

Christopher denies it, but he’s been having intense dreams, something his old self never experienced before. He rolls in bed, he struggles, he fights, he talks. He talks.

“No,” he says most nights. “It’s dark...I don’t want to go…not enough room...”

Sometimes, he whimpers. “I’m burning.”

“Lost,” he says every time he sleeps, without fail. These are just a few things he speaks in his dreaming. Most disturbingly, tonight, “We can’t tell her...she...burn.”

I don’t know why I consented to the Regen procedure. Had I known what my life would become after it, I wonder if I would have said no. If I had to pin a reason, I’d have to place it on the fact that I didn’t want to be found out for poisoning him. To be jailed and leave Bryan alone in the world. At first, it was just a little, to make him sick of drinking and sober up. Then, it was punishing. For once, he wasn’t targeting me. In fact, he even needed me. It was nice to have him depend on me in a way that didn’t hurt. In hindsight, I’m repulsed by what I’d done, and as much as I could try and blame it on the years of abuse, they were still conscious choices I had made each time I tipped the blue liquid into his stiff drinks.

I realize I’m admitting to what I’ve done on a public forum, but given the circumstances, I doubt anyone would truly believe even one tHing I have to say. Maybe that’s for the better. At this point, I would dread risking anyone else by getting them involved.

Things didn’t click for me right away, which the adage about hindsight being perfect once something goes awry certainly applies. I think the technical term, though, is I’m a dumbass. Maybe I was just looking for a sense of normalcy to hold onto, confirmation that things were finally resolved after years of agony. All the same, it’s on me for not seeing things for what they were as they were happening.

A few weeks ago, Bry and me were out in the yard. He was at his practice goal, shooting pucks into the net. Or trying to, half the time. He’s aiming to be on the team again now that he’s going into his sophomore year. Kid’s so lucky he got his father’s stocky physique. I was out putting down salt on the driveway while Christopher shoveled the excess from the last snow off the edges.

“What happened?” Chris seized my hand up, where red scratches lined the backs of my knuckles, too odd a place to bandage.

“Neighbor’s cat.” I took my hand back. “He usually doesn’t come around, but I think I scared it when I was pruning the bushes yesterday. He jumped out and got me.”

“They look deep,” he frowned. “Did it bite you, too?”

“Yeah, but I cleaned the cuts well. They’re already scabbing over.”

The mechanics of the moment are blurry, but best I recall, Bryan’s puck somehow bounced off the frame of the net and over his head, even though he moved for it. Next I knew, I was off my feet, spun round in a tight grip. When my brain caught up to the moment, I realized that Christopher had lifted me off the ground in a single arm. ThE puck was clutched in his hand; he’d caught it.

He stalked up to Bryan, anger that even at his most drunk was rarely directed toward Bryan now burned into the back of our son’s head. Now, his expression was something I was familiar with. Not processing how improbable it was that he was able to not only move me out of harm’s way in the time it took to take a breath, but to catch the ball midair like he was fucking Mike Tyson. (I just googled it, I guess I meant Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson is the ear biting guy.) I slunk out of his arm and stood between the two of them. Bryan hadn’t even turned around yet.

Christopher’s face immediately dropped. Not angry, not regretful, just...nothing. Like the face he made in the mirror when he memorized his old memories.

“You nearly hit your mother, Bry.” He threw the puck over Bryan’s head and it bounced off the garage door to a rolling stop in the snow on the yard

“Sorry!” Bry apologized, and picked the puck up in his red, freezing hands. “I was just thinking about going inside. Fingers are numb. I’m gonna make some hot chocolate.”

“Cinnamon in your mother’s,” Christopher agreed for me. “Chocolate syrup in mine.”

“Oookay, wasn’t an open invitation, but yeah, I’ll make them.”

I glanced around once Bry was inside, checking for neighbors, and stared up at him, heat in my eyes.

“What the hell was that?”

“He almost hit you.”

“On accident,” I clarified. “Never, and I will not yield on this, never look at my son that way ever again.”

“Our son.”

I flinched without realizing, reminded for the first time in days that this man, indeed, is not my husband. Not really. But isn’t he? He has his face, his hands, his body, his voice. Even if it is all...cloned.

His memories. The way he refers to himself as if the Christopher I married was a separate person, could that be the way he processes the apparent memory loss from the procedure? I consider this, even now, sitting in the freezing dark and my ass cheeks going numb. I’ve done a little Google detective work, searching for instances of memory loss how some visualize relearning memories. A few describe seeing it as if sitting in a theater, watching a movie play that they only somewhat recognize. I don’t know how to broach the topic with Christopher. Especially after what he’s done just over the past week.

My son, despite his stature, has been bullied at school off and on throughout his life. The primary issue is his stuttering. He’s mostly conquered it due to speech therapy and finding a group of friends through making it onto the basketball team. Those kids are Loyal, through and through, but they can’t fight all of Bry’s battles for him. The other thing that adds fuel to the fire — my son is gay. I have no issue with it, despite growing up a southern Appalachian farm girl. Feels like we get a rap of being bigoted and closed-minded. Maybe I fall just on the right side of that particular country apathy — I don’t give much mind to any aspect of a person so long as they work hard and keep kind while doing it. Bryan believes in God, and still attends service even after Chris and I stopped going to church, and this is his journey to take, however it lands him. My job is to love him anyway.

Kids at his school aren’t always that accepting. He’s had the N-slur, hard R, thrown at him when out around town, or at school when no faculty was around to overhear. I’m half black, and Bry inherited my father’s textured hair. He used to wear it in a few styles that didn’t hide his heritage, but since starting high school he’s started shaving it down just short of bald. I can see the way it hurts daddy whenever he and mama come round. I thought this progressive city’s with pretty neighborhoods were supposed to be better about these things, but no. And, of course, they were blatantly homophobic to Bry as well.

“There’s a couple other gay kids at my school,” Bry once said. “But the way they’re treated isn’t half as bad as I get it.”

Especially that shit-eating Tyler. I’ve never met a Tyler who wasn’t awful in some way, but the Wilke’s son took the cake, and someone else’s cake, too. Well-known for randomly egging houses year round, but especially in the weeks leading up to Halloween. He destroys mailboxes by driving his expensive car into them. Regularly shoplifts and shakes his peers down for money. It’s even rumored he threw something into a trashcan fire some homeless people were using to keep warm. It caused the flames to burst out of control and burned one woman so badly that she lost use of her hand. The police hate him but, predictably, he’s the mayor’s son. Or nephew, from what I’ve heard. Adopted after his drug abusing parents abandoned him as a toddler. If he wasn’t such a demon I’d probably care.

Bry came home three days ago covered in deep bruises, eyes nearly swollen shut from his broken nose.

“Oh my God!” I screamed, jumping over the back of the sofa, nearly falling on my face from the tangling of blankets that followed with me. “What happened?!”

“I’m...fine…” Bry stumbled for some paper towels and pressed the wad to the blood pouring out of it. “I think I need to go to the hopsital,” he mispronounced the word with his swollen lips.

“Chris! Chris!” I wailed, hands fumbling around, trying to find a place to put my hands that wouldn’t hurt him further.

Christopher came down the stairs in a quick, but even tempo, almost robotic in hindsight. When he found us in the kitchen, his face burned with rage.

“What happened?” His voice was cold and level, a stark contrast to his expression, I don’t know how both things could exist at the same time.

“Walking home,” he breathed between statements, nose too swollen to breathe through. “Car. Hit me. Sidewalk. Can’t seee...”

Bryan went limp, and between my screaming and blood freezing, somehow Chris got us to the hospital faster than any ambulance could.

The ER team brought him back, and the several hours of him being treated dragged on. The police asked us questions, but I hardly heard them through the roaring in my ears, a sound like being outside on the wing of a plane as it flew. Besides, we didn’t know much. They followed us as we followed the doctor to see him in his room. He was covered in bandages and hooked up to tubes. His left are was in a sling. Broken. He wouldn’t be able to play hockey for months, and it was easy to deduce it was his primary reason for the tears down his face.

“Tyler. Wilkes.” He bit out the name through the brace on his chin. His jaw was dislocated, apparently. “Please.”

“Don’t let him get away with this,” I pleaded to the officer taking notes.

“Son, easy now.” The other officer put his hands in his pockets, stance uneasy. “Why do you think it was him?”

“He just told you,” I said. “Arrest him.”

“We need evidence. Camera footage, or an eye witness.”

“He is an eye witness!” I flung my hand toward my beaten boy.

“We all know that’s not how this works,” the note-taking officer sighed and put his pad of paper away. “Even on the television.”

All this back and forth, and Christopher silently watches.

“His. Car.” Bry grunted out, new tears of obvious frustration contorting his face. “Please. Help!”

“Listen,” one of them leaned in to Bryan, true sympathy on his face. “We’ll do what we can. This is...if it is him, this is something new, worse. We might be able to get him. Might. I don’t want to get your hopes up, kid.”

I sat beside Bryan as he sobbed brokenly in time with my own tears. The officers left, telling us they’ll keep in touch. As if that mattered.

“They’re never going stop him,” I whimpered, head in my folded hands. “He’ll kill someone someday if they don’t. Oh, Bry. Bry.”

I cried myself to sleep in the chair, and I regret it even now, in a way. I would have seen Christopher leave before visitor’s hours were over. A nurse checking in on Bry ended up waking me, but honestly I needed it. I’d fallen asleep at the worst angle. I stepped out of the room to call Chris. He didn’t answer. I tried again, moving to the waiting room, and still got no answer. Maybe he’d gone home to sleep in his own bed, but even then my gut instinct was that something was wrong. Regardless of why, I’d be angry if he left me stranded here without a car. When I finally got hold of him, dawn had broken on the horizon.

“Hello?” He was out of breath, I had figured he was on a morning run.

“Where are you?” I hissed in a whisper.

“I had to take care of something at home,” he tried to regain his breath. “How’s Bryan?”

“You left when our son is in the hospital?” Something inside rang with wrongness, not for the first time.

“I had to take care of something at home,” he repeated flatly. “I’ll be back soon as I can.”

I dragged my hand down my face. When I looked down, I realized Bryan’s blood was on my clothes. I nearly threw up.

“Fine. When you do, I’ll go home and get a shower.”

We hung up. I went back to Bry, and waited for Chris to return.

It did no good Pretending I didn’t know what was going on, but I have to remind myself these circumstances were beyond abnormal. The second night Bry was in the hospital, Tyler Wilkes was mugged. Beaten within an inch of his life. Police assumed it was a baseball bat that broke his legs. There were no such things as coincidences with Christopher anymore.

A few hours ago, I brought the kitchen trash to our big bin. The smell hit me with such a thick, deep rank I don’t think I’ll ever forget it. I knew before I found it. What I found. God, I’m so sorry. I don’t know what will happen from here on out. I could never have foreseen this happening, or foresee how things will get worse from here in out.

In a bag wrapped in a plastic bag, wrapped in another plastic bag, wrapped in a nothing plastic bag, in one of those thick thermal bags you can get to insulate food from the grocery store — bloodied clothes, and worse:

The neighbor’s cat.
