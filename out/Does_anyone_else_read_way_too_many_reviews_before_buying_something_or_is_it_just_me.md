Like the title states, anytime I buy something, I ALWAYS read the reviews beforehand. It's the only way to know if it's any good. 

But as the enshittification of the internet progresses, these reviews are becoming less and less helpful. I mean, how honest are they going to be for a product named, "RIIA Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask, Hydrogel Overnight Mask, Korean Skincare, Stocking Stuffers for Girlfriend and Wife"? Like, 0%. They're all botted to hell.

Regardless, I do it anyways. I mean, there's gotta be SOME real people reviewing this junk. It's better than buying something with 0 reviews or a bunch of negative ones.

To preface this, I just moved into my first apartment last week. It's a bit scary knowing that I'm broke and only have the absolute basics (TV, entertainment stand, couch, bed, et cet.) But oh well, it is what it is. I'll just buy a little at a time until it's fully-furnished and looking GORGEOUS! My goal is to eventually work my way up to the ultimate luxury - an espresso maker lol.

First order of business is getting a toaster. Yes, a toaster. Call me weird, but I love toast. I've been eating it almost every day for breakfast since I was a kid (any toast aficionado knows that the best way is butter only, no jam or jelly or anything weird like Marmite.) So, yes, a toaster will be my first treat of many.

I look on Amazon and find the first cheap toaster with somewhat decent reviews. 4.3 stars with 8k reviews isn't bad. Let's see what people are saying.

"Great toaster if you need something basic. $25 bucks and it works." - Doug M.

"it toasts lol" - Secret_Broil

"Fantasic little appliance!! Perfect for breakfast!" - Jeremy M.

Good enough for me! I'll go ahead and get it. Should only be a few days until it arrives.

Sure enough, a few days later, I get home from work and my package has arrived!! Call me a nerd, but I am SO excited for this thing. I might even have me a little late night toast excursion.

I set the toaster up and, what do you know, it doesn't work. I plugged it in, put my bread in, pulled the handle down, and... nothing. What a piece of shit. At least Amazon has a good return policy.

That night, as I start the return process and begin looking for a new toaster, the busted one starts making a clicking sound. I'm talking LOUD too. Just, "click, click, click, click". Drove me fucking nuts for a few minutes until I unplugged the thing.

What's weird is that it was hot. And the lever wasn't pulled down either. But that's what you get for ordering some shit that was probably made for $2.

I finally find a new one. Something pretty similar. And at this point, I'm pretty irritated, so I don't even check the reviews this time. I just click 'buy', put my phone on the charger, brush my teeth, take off my makeup, and go to bed.

As expected, another few days roll by and I'm chilling on the couch when there's a single knock on my door. I open it and, voila, new toaster. I still have to return the old one, but I'll do it later - I have 30 days. It's not like the one I have is haunted or anything.

A week goes by and thankfully, I finally have my 3rd day off since moving in. At least this overtime is paying off.

As I sit in my bedroom bed-rotting (aka watching TikToks and eating chips all day), I look around and notice how... bland my room is. I mean, fuck me, it looks like a dude's room. I need to get some color or something in here. Maybe an accent wall would be nice.

So, I go on Home Depot's website and look at paint (exciting, I know) and I'm thinking a nice pop of ocean blue would be perfect. But, I don't want to get some crap where the paint flakes off. So, I find a brand and color I like, and of course, I read the reviews.

"Beautiful color . Was exactly what I was looking for !! The cottage has never looked better !! " - MARY

"Went on beautifully. Color was better than I expected too. Perfect for when you just need to liven a dreary room" - Jeremy M.

"Its paint what do you expect d******" - HomeDepotCustomer

Alright, well, HomeDepotCustomer sounds like a bit of an asshole, but I think I'll go with this one. I order it and... what the fuck? A week? It's going to take a week? Thats some bullshit, but whatever, I guess. In the meantime, maybe I'll go on Etsy and get some cute new earrings too. I mean, I can't let my apartment's soon-to-be prettiness show me up.

Again, I hear the clicking of the old toaster. "Click, click, click, click." I go to the kitchen and... it's plugged in? And it's hot, almost unbearably so. How the hell is that possible? Something is fucking weird here. I could've sworn that I unplugged it. I need to return this shit tomorrow. Regardless, I go back to my room and hop on Etsy.

After only a few minutes, I find the CUTEST little silver snake earrings. I mean, they aren't everyone's cup of tea, but apparently I like reptiles in mine. 

Now, I bet you'll guess what's coming next... *cue dramatic music* the reviews!

"Got them for a friend's bday. She loved them." - Kyrsten

"Talk about QUALITY!! I've been buying from SamSlithers for a few years now and they've never disappointed. Six stars if I could!" - GooseGobbler

"Absolutely fantastic. Truly. I mean, why would you want your new apartment to be prettier than you?" - Jeremy M.

...what the fuck? What was that last comment? Who would say some shit like that?
 
I look through my recent purchases on every website and the same name keeps popping up: Jeremy M. Even with the second toaster I bought, he reviewed that.

"Great toaster, especially if the earlier one is on the fritz!! The clicking drives me NUTS!" - Jeremy M.

This has to be some sort of fucked up coincidence. Out of total paranoia, I start looking up random items: paper towel holders, vacuums, baby gates.

"Great for your first apartment out of college!!" - Jeremy M.

"Ugh, if only it could vacuum by itself! Unfortunately, being a girl living alone, you have no choice but to do it yourself!" - Jeremy M.

"You'll never be able to use this, Jess. Why bother?" - Jeremy M.

What the fuck? What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck? Who the hell is this????? 

I go to the original review and click on Jeremy M.'s profile. They now have a profile picture... and it's me, sleeping in bed. But the worst part is the bio.

It was my address and today's date, followed by the time: 8:50 PM.

It's 8:49 PM.

Before I can run, my closet door creaks open. Before me, there's a man that I've never seen before.

I stop. I'm paralyzed with fear while this creep just... stares at me. Clearly, he's disturbed, but he does absolutely fuck-all.

I slowly inch my way towards the door until suddenly, I feel a yank on my wrist.

"Jess, it's almost time - don't you want to know what happens?"

I look over at the clock. Slowly, it ticks to 8:50 PM.

I rip my arm away and bolt towards the front exit. I open it, slam it behind me, and start running as quickly as I can.

Now after a mile or so and no trace of "Jeremy M.", I call the police. They come and search my apartment, but as you'd expect, nothing. Not even a trace. 

They didn't seem to care. Who knows if they even checked the cameras. What's the point of the police if they just show up to shoot the shit with each other? Useless.

Anyways, I stayed with my parents for the next few nights. Soon after, my older brother moved in with me. Convenient for him since he's now closer to his job, not convenient for me because he brought a bunch of junk with him.

Y'know, it's been a while since the incident and things have returned to normalcy for the most part... other than the other day. Someone left a note taped to my door. Curious, I pulled it off and opened it. My heart dropped.

"Wow! Beautiful apartment! And the guest policy is very gracious. Five stars!" - Jeremy M.
