Fortunately, though, I was not in any immediate danger at that moment.  Just like when I saw The Sandman’s face in my clock for the first time, it’s not as if he came bursting out of it and attacking me the very next second.  And it was the same thing here.  He looked like he was contained safely inside my watch.  The only question now was why was I seeing his face in it so early in the day?  It was only just after 3PM.  When I saw The Sandman’s face in my clock for the first time, it was around 11.  The clock didn’t even start glowing until eight.

And that was another weird thing: Unlike the clock, my watch wasn’t glowing.  When I had seen my clock glow for the first time when The Sandman appeared in it, I had no idea that it had any “glow” feature.  But, with my watch, I knew perfectly well that it could do that.  I had used that very same feature to navigate my way around Anastasia’s neighborhood when I first went out to see her in the dead of night by using it to shine a light on the addresses on all the mailboxes up and down the street till I found hers.  But for whatever reason, my watch just wasn’t glowing right then.  

I figured I could still probably press the button on the side and make it glow manually, but it still wasn’t doing it automatically the way the clock would.  Maybe it just wasn’t late enough.  Maybe it would start glowing all by itself, just like my clock, once 8 PM came around.  But if it did that, then maybe The Sandman would be coming out of my watch at midnight too.

Although, that might have to mean that The Sandman would need to stop breaking out of my clock.  Surely it couldn’t come out of both my clock AND my College High watch all at the same time.  Surely it couldn’t come out of two places at once.  But then I thought about how that was actually entirely possible.  Not just possible even, but really, what HAD to be true.  Every night, it was coming out of my clock at midnight AND Anastasia’s.  

It was just like she said: the stages added on to one another.  Even if she hadn’t yet admitted to the fact that The Sandman was coming out of her clock at 2 and 3 AM on weekends, she was still perfectly open about the fact that The Sandman came out of her clock at midnight on weeknights just like he did for me.  Whenever The Sandman came out of her clock, he was coming out of mine at the exact same time. 

But still, maybe it wasn’t able to burst out of wristwatches the same way it could with clocks.  Even if it COULD break out of multiple clocks at once, maybe wristwatches would keep it contained.  Maybe because watches were a separate type of time-keeping device entirely, they’d have different attributes allowing them to keep The Sandman at bay.  

But it didn’t seem likely.  If he could worm its way into my watch, surely he could get out of it too.  Why would The Sandman get inside something he couldn’t get out of?  Even if it didn’t impact his ability to burst out of other clocks when the time came (given that he had to be capable of showing up in multiple places at once since there were multiple players in the game) it still didn’t change the fact that it just wouldn’t make sense for him to do it.  Even if he wasn’t trapping himself, what would be the point?  Why would he be in my watch unless he wanted to trick me into taking him under my blanket which was normally the only thing barricading him away from me when midnight came?

I decided from then on, I’d just have to never go to bed with my watch on.  My blanket was my only protective shield.  If my watch was under my blanket with me, The Sandman wouldn’t have to get through it at all, and I’d be done for.  That had to have been his evil plan.  And it almost worked, too.

The only problem now was how to get my watch to go back to normal.  I did still wanna know what time it was.  Even if it wasn’t vitally important right at that moment, I did still pay good money for that watch and wanted to get my money’s worth.  There had to be some way to get it to tell time again.  

The reason I had seen The Sandman during 6th period after my absolute tirade on Anastasia (still wasn’t looking forward to showing my face in front of her ever again after that), was because I must’ve activated it during class by accident.  I must’ve done something or other to the watch to get it to show The Sandman’s face.  That would explain why I had seen him during that time, even though I hadn't said his name.  

That was my working theory, anyway.  I just couldn’t think of another good reason for why I would’ve seen his face during class.  That wasn’t how The Sandman was supposed to work.  You had to say his name and you had to be playing Sleep Points.  If either one hadn’t been true, he wasn’t supposed to randomly show up out of the corner of your eye.  He wasn’t supposed to work like that.

But going back to my watch, the fact that it looked perfectly normal right up until I flicked the snowflake off must’ve meant that I had managed to get it back to normal just by accident at some point in between 6th period, when I had last seen the face, and when I first checked it on the bus to flick the snowflake off.  I fiddled around with it for a moment or two before checking to see if tapping the face would do something, and sure enough, it did.  My watch looked just the same as ever.  I figured it couldn’t’ve been too hard if I had managed to do the same thing once before without even meaning to.

I got home and immediately dove into bed.  After what a tiring day I had had, I figured I’d probably sleep like a baby once I got home.  I decided I’d set an alarm on my phone for dinner, just to make sure mom and dad didn’t have to come up to my room to get me up.  Dinner was usually at 5 and right then it was 3:45. Setting an alarm did, I guess, require some small amount of my phone’s battery.  But it wasn’t as if I could use the clock on my bed to set the alarm.  After all, it was like Anastasia said, you could only set the alarm for a time after midnight and before noon.  It didn’t have an AM or PM setting, just AM.  It’d be useless for setting an alarm in the afternoon or evening.

The only problem was that it was still daylight.  I figured that had to have been why I wasn’t able to sleep.  Even with the Activation Fluid somehow making it super difficult for me to sleep, I felt beyond tired.  I felt like there had to be other factors keeping me up, even beyond that damn Sleep Points goop.  

It had to be the fact that, given I had gone to bed at 3:45 PM and I’d need to be up for dinner at about 5, I wasn’t gonna get the 90 minutes of sleep I needed.  That lack of motivation, that understanding that whether I fell asleep or not wouldn’t matter, must’ve also been what was at play.  If anything, if I took a 30-minute or 60-minute power nap just then, it could become even more difficult to fall asleep when I REALLY needed to, once nightfall came.  

But nevertheless, I just didn’t feel much like getting out of bed or really doing anything.  So I just kinda laid there, just as my own little experiment to see if I even COULD sleep.  I knew my chances of being tired enough to go to sleep that night would ultimately be damaged by my afternoon nap, but maybe proving to myself that sleep was, at the very least, a possibility would put my mind at ease and in a more restful mood.

But what was so worrying was the fact that, just like the night before, I couldn’t even seem to get ANY amount of sleep.  Like not even 10 or 15 minutes.  Which just felt totally illogical.  I was tired as all get out, and yet I was somehow, miraculously enough, not even getting the slightest moment of sleep.  I stayed in bed all the way up until dinner at 5.  Nothing.

So when I finally did get called down, I was kinda relieved to be taking a break from my failed attempts at sleep.  I started thinking that maybe I was just trying too hard.  Maybe if I just got my mind off sleep for a little while, it would come more naturally.  Maybe if I took my mind off Stage Two and how vitally important it was for me to 90 straight minutes of sleep before 6 AM on Thursday, I could make it happen.  That damn timer on my watch couldn’t have been helping matters.  

As much as I felt like Anastasia was probably trying to hide her clock from me to stop me from seeing The Sandman coming, I think she really meant what she said:  she didn’t want any needless information keeping her up.  And neither did I.  Counting down the seconds to my sleepless demise was probably just about the worst thing I could’ve been doing at that moment.  I couldn’t tap my watch again and look at the timer.  I would probably have been better off not even checking the time at all.

Dinner was decent, though a bit uneventful.  Mom and Dad asked me how my project was coming along, and I said it was going fine.  They asked me what I had researched, so I rattled off a few basic tidbits and pieces of trivia I had picked up from my research.  Like, for example, since Anastasia and I were studying the Everglades of Florida, we actually weren’t studying wetlands like I had thought initially.  Or at least, we weren’t studying wetlands broadly.  We were actually studying marshes, which are distinct from wetlands because marshes are a particular type of wetland primarily inhabited by soft-stemmed vegetation.  Whatever the hell any of that’s supposed to mean.

So, like, I wasn’t totally wrong in the beginning to think we’d be studying wetlands.  A marsh is still technically a TYPE of wetland.  They just have certain features that aren’t shared by ALL wetlands.  I mean yeah, I don’t know when or why I'll ever need to know this meaningless bullshit, but that’s just the public education system for ya.

So anyway, I gave them a kinda brief and vague rundown of what I had researched, since I still didn’t really feel like I knew a whole lot more about the subject than I did at the start of the project.  But it didn’t matter that it was short.  What few details I was able to provide seemed to satisfy them, which I was thankful for since it got them off my back.  The whole time though, I was still a bit paranoid that they might notice something off about me given that I hadn’t gotten any sleep at all on the previous night.

After dinner, I didn’t immediately attempt going back to sleep.  I tried to keep myself up a little longer, just because apparently my mind and body still needed a little bit more awake time.  So I watched YouTube, on my laptop of course so that way I wouldn’t drain my phone’s battery and risk it dying on me, while also getting in a little Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft until 10:30.  

By then, I figured it had been long enough for my mind to finally shut off after all this time that it had spent awake.  But the clock was going through its usual stages, which meant that if I wanted to go to sleep any time soon, I’d have to do it with my head under the blanket.  I still couldn’t seem to get comfortable sleeping like that, so I decided to just stay up until midnight as usual, and just get whatever sleep I could squeeze in after that.

Eventually though, I got on my phone anyway, even though it still drained battery whether I used it on the charger or not.  It’s unnaturally fast battery leakage combined with my blanket losing all protective power if my phone were to ever die was exactly why I had to constantly keep it charging 24/7 these days.  Even though it did start acting up again once midnight approached and drained battery at an even faster pace, I kept using it since it was still at like 35% once 11:45 came around.  I had still had some wiggle room to work with.  But soon after, it became too glitchy to keep on using and got too hot to hold comfortably.  So I set it down and waited for midnight to be gotten over with.  

As soon as I did that though, I realized I had made a huge mistake.  I wasn’t supposed to be on my phone AT ALL for an entire HOUR before I went to bed.  Which, oh yeah, was supposed to happen at 9 o’clock.  And now, here I was, almost three hours later, and I STILL hadn’t bothered to shower OR brush my teeth yet, like I was supposed to.  Let alone floss.  I had forgotten all that shit completely.  Anastasia would probably NEVER let me hear the end of this.  Especially not after I blew up at her over literally nothing back in 6th period.  There was no WAY she was gonna let me live this down.

Sure, a lotta the shit she would say to me could be passive-aggressive as hell, and was no doubt going to be when I saw her again.  But in her defense, it’s not like any of it wasn’t TRUE.  She was even willing to take BACK what she had said about how I would only get in her way and do more harm than good.  Which, come to think about, maybe she shouldn’t have apologized for.  She might’ve had a point.  I wasn’t all that confident during dinner when told my parents what little I DID know.  Or at least THOUGHT I knew.  Some of that stuff might’ve actually been dead wrong.  That was probably why she limited me to only organizing the layout of the poster.  She probably knew better than to put me in charge of any actual information on it.

When 11:59 came, I hid under my blanket and braced myself once again.  For some reason though, I STILL had the same rush of horror that I did BEFORE I hid under my blanket.  Usually when I hid, I was able to calm down a little now that I was safe.  But I just couldn’t.  Fear still consumed me.  I couldn’t pinpoint why.  The only thing I could think about was how warm my wrist felt.  It started out mildly uncomfortable, but quickly it began to feel like hot coals were resting on it.    
I took a look at it, and IMMIEDIATELY understood why:  I still had that damn watch on.  I had stupidly forgotten to take it off before going to bed.  Y'know.  Along with all the OTHER things I had stupidly forgotten to do. 

The Sandman was gonna get me from under the covers if I didn’t chuck that thing like a grenade outta my sight.  And just almost immediately after I did, the glass broke.  I hid under my blanket.  I froze.  I had almost been attacked by The Sandman from right under my blanket.  The one place I was SUPPOSED to be safe.  If I had acted even one second later, it might’ve been all over.

“Not asleep.  30 hours to go,” The Sandman said in the same hauntingly deranged voice I had heard on the previous night.  And then, before I knew it, midnight was over, and it had left.  But I could hardly say the same for my Sleep Points problems.  The Sandman’s midnight visits were the least of my worries by then.  If I didn’t find a way to somehow get 90 minutes of sleep before 6 AM on Thursday morning, I was done for.  No amount of hiding under my blanket, or keeping my phone charged, or any other type of rule-following would save me from my fate if I hadn’t gotten at least 90 minutes of sleep yet by then.

I thought about Anastasia’s advice earlier that day.  I took a few deep breaths trying to empty my mind of any thoughts that would keep me up.  She had also said something about putting on music.  Maybe it would’ve helped, but I couldn’t think of anything that would do a particularly great job of putting me to sleep, so I didn’t bother.  The noise was probably just gonna keep me up, anyway.  Everything was keeping me up.

I checked my phone one last time to see my Sleep Points.  180.  140 from the 14 nights I spent on Stage One.  The other 40 from the two nights I had now spent on Stage Two.  20 points apiece, just like Anastasia had said.  And falling asleep was easily taking way more effort than it ever had before.  Again, just like she had said.

This was why I was glad to have someone like her around as a source of information.  Without her, I would have no idea why it randomly became so impossible to get to sleep.  I would have no idea why The Sandman kept counting down the hours until Thursday at 6 in the morning.  I would have no idea that my fate would be sealed by then if I didn’t get an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep.

But then again, maybe not knowing would make falling asleep easier.   I wouldn’t be under all this pressure to fall asleep if I didn’t know about the new rule.  But, on the other hand, it also warned me in advance to do everything that I possibly could to make it easier for myself to fall asleep.  It let me know that I should probably be making an effort to wear myself out during the day in order to make it as easy as possible to go to sleep once nightfall came.  Even if I hadn’t made much of an effort during THAT day, I still had one last chance to go all in on the next.

And that was probably the only thing keeping me together and stopping me from freaking the fuck out entirely: the fact that it was only Tuesday night.  That meant that when 6 AM finally DID come around, it would only be Wednesday morning.  I’d still have one more night to get some sleep in, even if tonight was totally unsuccessful.  

The hours crept by.  Before I knew it, it was 2:00.  No matter.  I’d still have until 5:00 to fall asleep, since I wouldn’t have to wake up until 6:30 for school.  But school was another problem.  If I didn’t have school, I’d have all day to take a nap and get my 90 minutes in.  I would’ve had all the time in the world.  But instead, 7 hours of my day was spent at a place where I had to be awake and alert.  

And in the morning, that would only become even more difficult than yesterday.  
Part of me was beginning to wonder if maybe I should try and get my 90 minutes in at school.  After all, for whatever reason, once I was at school and needed to stay awake, falling asleep always seemed like it could come pretty easily.  Even if it did get me in trouble, being in school trouble was well worth it in order to get out of Sleep Points trouble.

The hours continued to creep by.  Soon it was 3.  Then it was 4.  And finally, 5AM came.  Even though it was too late to meet my quota, I still felt determined to fall asleep for any amount of time at all.  But I never did. Then 6:30 came.  I had now, for the first time in my life, gone two nights in a row with no sleep at all.  And all while trying desperately to do the opposite.  With the way things were going, I didn’t have 24 hours to fall asleep so much as I had 24 hours to live.
