I called in sick to work. All I could do was sit there, staring at my phone, my heart pounding in my chest. I couldn’t eat. Couldn’t focus. Couldn’t *move.* Because I knew, sooner or later, I'd get the instructions.

It was almost noon when my phone pinged. Hands shaking, I picked it up and stared at the message.

**Deliver the package to 12 Maple Avenue.**

*Package? What pack—*

*Ding.*

The doorbell rang—followed by a dull *thump* on the porch.

*No. No, no, no.* The kitchen swam beneath me. Slowly, I forced myself up; then I walked to the door and swung it open.

At my feet, there was a brown box.

It wasn’t that small. About a foot on a side. Heart pounding in my chest, I reached down and picked it up. It was heavier than I expected, but not exceedingly so. Taking deep breaths, I started back inside—

I stopped.

There was a pool of dark liquid where the box had just been.

I lifted the box up and saw, in the center, the cardboard was wet. Soggy. Stained dark red...

I dropped the box and screamed. It made a wet *thwack* on my front porch. I leapt inside and slammed the door—

*Brzzt.*

My phone. On the kitchen table.

The screen lit up with a message. I slowly walked towards it, the pain building in my chest.

**Deliver the package, Lynn.**

I texted back, my fingers flying over the screen. **FUCK OFF. YOU'RE SICK. I'M CALLING THE POLICE!**

The reply came back almost instantly.

**You'll be dead before you get the chance.**

I whipped around. And then I saw it: on the other side of the street, a black sedan with dark windows idled by the curb. My throat went dry. If they were holding a gun...

They'd have a straight shot at my head.

I ran into the living room and ducked behind the couch. No one could possibly see me, through any windows. Hands shaking, I raised my thumb over the dial button—

*Brzzt.*

**We have a second car at JCP Elementary. It’s recess. All I have to do is give the word.**

My throat went dry. All the air sucked out my lungs. I couldn’t breathe. **Please,** I typed back, **please just leave us alone.**

The reply popped up.

**I will, if you deliver the package. This is your final task.**

I got up. Slowly walked into the kitchen. Through the window I could see the brown box, askew on the steps. The wet, darkened stain.

**And please, don't drop it again. It's fragile.**

Shaking, I made my way back to the door. I picked up the box. Something *thunked* against the side as I rotated it in my hands. I swallowed and tried not to imagine what was inside.

I stiffly walked to the car. Put the box into the passenger seat. Then I got in the driver's seat and stared out the windshield.

*I can't do this.*

But when I glanced in the rearview mirror, I saw the black car. Idling at the curb. Watching me.

As I drove, I couldn’t stop glancing at the box. At the dark red seeping into the gray cloth of the passenger seat. Deep down, I think I knew what was in the box. But that didn’t stop me from pulling over to the side of the road, just outside of town, and taking a peek.

My hands shook as I pulled off the tape. As soon as the seal was broken, a horrible smell filled the car. Gasping, I grabbed the flap and quickly pulled it up—

And immediately vomited.

It was a head.

The head of an adult man.

I grabbed the flaps and pushed them shut. Grabbed the tape off the floor and quickly sealed the box again. Rolled the windows down to get rid of the smell. Gasped in gulps of fresh air.

Because in the quick flash I’d seen, the face looked familiar.

It looked like the man I’d taken a photo of, in the black coat.

I hit the gas and sped through town, until I was turning into Oak Grove—the community of McMansions built several years back. I passed brick archways, white columns, sprawling lawns of green. I frantically looked for the number 12.

And then I found it.

The house was grand, sitting on top of a hill. White columns stretched up to the sky, and a large window reflected the clear blue sky. I pulled up to the curb and grabbed the box.

Then I burst out and ran up to the front door.

I could hear the *thump-thump-thump* of the head rattling inside with each step. A wave of nausea hit me, but I forced myself to concentrate on my steps. *Almost there. Almost.* As soon as my feet hit the porch, I dropped the box and got the hell out. When I was halfway down the hill I heard the door creak open behind me—then a pause—and then a woman’s scream.

I kept running. Dove into the car. Hit the gas and peeled down the road.

When I was finally back in my house, every door locked and sealed, I sent off a final text.

**I delivered the box. Our transactions are over. Never contact me again.**

I stared at the screen, my eyes watering. And then three little dots popped up.

**You weren’t supposed to open the box, Lynn.**

The phone slipped out of my hands. And then I began to sob. My entire body shook as I imagined what horrible things this person would ask me to do next. Knowing that I was powerless, that they knew where I lived, where my kids went to school.

But it’s been a month now, and I haven’t heard anything.

I’ve been watching the news, though. And last night, they broadcast something that put a dagger in my chest. The police had been working for months on the local man’s murder, and while they never traced anything back to me or the person who deposited money into my account, they finally got a break in the case.

They found the murder weapon.
