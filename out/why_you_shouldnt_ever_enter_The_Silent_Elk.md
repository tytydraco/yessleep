I never thought I’d be writing something like this, but after everything I’ve experienced, I feel like I need to warn others. It started as just another job, a simple gig in a remote forest to help me get away from the chaos of city life. Little did I know that the forest held something far worse than isolation.

I’m William, and I was hired to maintain a radio tower in the Dark Elk Forest. It’s about three miles off the nearest town, and most people avoid it, mostly due to how dense and dark the trees are. People say it’s peaceful, but they also talk about strange things that happen. I didn’t believe any of that at the time.

The cabin I stayed in was small, just a place to sleep and eat, and the radio tower was old—needed a lot of work. For the first few nights, it was all business. I spent my days fixing equipment, walking through the forest to check the tower, and recording some sounds of the wildlife. It wasn’t much, but the quiet was nice. Too quiet, I would later realize.

On the third night, I started hearing something I couldn’t explain. At first, I thought it was just the wind or maybe a big tree falling, but the noise was different. It was like... the sound of the trees themselves breaking, slowly, as if they were crumbling to dust. It started faint, but by midnight, the sounds were loud enough to make the entire cabin shake. I grabbed my recorder and went outside, hoping to capture whatever it was.

“Maybe it’s just an old tree collapsing,” I said to myself, trying to stay calm.

But when I listened to the playback, I realized that wasn’t it. The noise wasn’t like anything I’d ever heard. It sounded like the forest itself was moving, shifting. I tried to convince myself it was just my mind playing tricks, but the next night it happened again. The crumbling sound—closer this time. And the worst part? The forest went dead silent. No birds, no wind, no rustling leaves. It was like the entire forest was holding its breath.

That’s when I saw it.

I was sitting outside, near the fire I’d started to keep the cold away. The sky was clear, and the stars looked incredible out there, away from the lights of the town. But as I stared into the woods, I saw something that I’ll never forget. It was tall, almost unnaturally tall, and pale—so pale it almost glowed in the dark. Its eyes were black, like two empty voids, and its fingers were long, like tree branches. And its rib cage was exposed, hanging like some kind of grotesque sculpture.

It didn’t move. It just stood there, watching me.

I tried to call out, but my voice felt strangled, like I couldn’t force the words past my throat. “Who... who are you?” I managed to whisper. But the thing didn’t respond. It just stood there, silently watching me.

I ran back into the cabin, locked the door, and grabbed my radio equipment. I tried to record my voice. “This is William, night three. I think... I think there’s something in the woods. Something I can’t explain. It’s—” But before I could finish, I heard it again. The crumbling noise, closer than ever.

I kept my lights on all night, sitting in the corner of the cabin, praying I was imagining things. But every time I closed my eyes, I could hear it—the sound of the trees, like they were bending under some heavy weight, and then a slow breath... a breath that didn’t belong in nature.

The next night, I heard a voice over the radio. It was faint at first, like static, but then it cleared.

“William… leave. Leave before you’re marked,” the voice said, barely above a whisper.

I was stunned. I grabbed the radio, desperate for answers. “Who is this? What do you mean? What’s happening in this forest?”

But the voice never answered again. It was just static.

I didn’t know what to do, but I couldn’t stay there. Something in my gut told me I needed to leave—before it was too late. But the road back was long, and the forest felt... wrong. As I packed my things, the air turned cold, and the sounds of the forest changed. The wind stopped. The birds went silent. I could feel it closing in on me.

I tried to drive away, but I swear, the trees seemed to move, like they were shifting, blocking my path. The crumbling noise was all around me, and I could hear faint whispers, like something was trying to talk to me through the static of the radio.

I didn’t stay. I don’t know what happened after I left, but I haven’t been back since. I’m not the same anymore, and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to shake the feeling that something was watching me. Something… I shouldn’t have disturbed.

All I know is that the forest isn’t as empty as it seems. And if you ever find yourself near Dark Elk Forest, don’t stay after dark. If you hear the trees crumbling… it’s already too late.

I know this sounds crazy, but I’ve heard stories of others who’ve gone in there and never come out. I thought I was just hearing things, but now I’m not so sure. The people in the town don’t talk about it much. They know better.

Just… please, be careful.
