I never thought I’d be one of those people who would believe in something so strange. It sounds ridiculous, right? The idea that the people you love might not be the people you think they are? But I’ve seen it with my own eyes, and now I’m terrified of who might be living in my house.

It all started a few weeks ago when I noticed my brother acting... off. He’s always been a bit of a quiet guy, but one evening, I saw him sitting at the dinner table, staring at me in a way he never had before. His expression was blank, almost robotic. I shrugged it off, thinking maybe he was just tired or distracted. But then things got weirder.

I woke up one night to hear footsteps outside my bedroom door. I opened my eyes and glanced at the clock—it was 2:32 a.m., a time I never forgot. I thought I heard a faint whispering—like someone was muttering to themselves—but when I checked, no one was there.

The next day, my brother was in the living room watching TV. As soon as I walked in, he looked up at me, but something was off. His eyes—there was something wrong with them. They weren’t his eyes. It’s hard to describe, but they were cold, lifeless, like they were… **empty.**

I confronted him, asking if he was okay, but he just stared at me for a moment and then smiled. A smile that was too wide. Too… **unnatural**.

“Everything’s fine,” he said, his voice too smooth, too even. “I’m just tired.”

But that night, I heard it again. The footsteps outside my door. But this time, they weren’t just footsteps. I heard the soft scratching sound, like fingers lightly dragging against the walls. It sent a cold shiver through me. I felt paralyzed, my heart racing as I stayed still, listening to the sound that was coming closer and closer.

The next morning, I couldn’t find my brother anywhere. I searched the entire house—every room, every corner. He was gone. I even checked the backyard, the garage, and all the closets. But he was nowhere to be found.

I was just about to call the police when he walked in the front door, looking as though nothing had happened. He smiled at me again, that same wide, **blank** expression on his face.

“I went for a walk,” he said casually. But something was off. His voice—**it wasn’t his voice.** It was his mouth, but the tone was all wrong. There was no warmth in it, no familiarity.

I told myself I was just overreacting. But then I saw my mom. She was sitting on the couch, staring at me the way my brother had—too still, too quiet. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but it was like her face had shifted slightly, just enough for me to notice. **Her eyes weren’t right**. They were too wide, too unblinking.

She didn’t greet me when I entered the living room. In fact, she didn’t say anything at all. Just stared. After what felt like forever, she finally blinked and said, “Dinner’s almost ready.”

But it wasn’t her voice. It sounded wrong. **Off**. There was something about the cadence, the way her lips barely moved, that made my skin crawl.

That night, I stayed up late, hoping to get some rest. But around 2:00 a.m., I woke up to the sound of footsteps again. This time, they were coming from downstairs, slow and deliberate, like someone was pacing the hallway.

I grabbed my phone and texted my brother, asking if he was awake. But there was no reply. I texted my mom—nothing. A feeling of dread crept over me as I tiptoed down the stairs.

What I saw in the living room made my blood run cold.

They were there. My brother and my mom. **Standing in the middle of the room**, staring at the wall, unmoving. Their eyes were wide open, unblinking. Their faces—**expressionless**.

I froze in the doorway. I wanted to call out, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t speak. My legs felt heavy, like I was rooted to the floor, but my mind was racing. I couldn’t understand what was happening.

Then, my brother turned his head—slowly, unnaturally. He looked right at me with those dead, empty eyes.

“You’re still awake,” he said, his voice flat and devoid of any emotion. “Why are you still awake?”

I couldn’t respond. I backed away, feeling a sense of panic rising in my chest. I turned to run, but my mom’s voice stopped me.

“Stay with us,” she said, her voice now a chilling echo, **too cold**, **too distant**. “We’re all here for you.”

I bolted upstairs and locked my door. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know who these people were anymore. **Were they still my family?**

The next day, I decided I couldn’t stay in the house any longer. I packed a bag and went to stay at a friend’s place. But when I came back, the house was exactly as I left it. I figured maybe I was just being paranoid.

I tried to forget about it. But the next morning, my mom was standing in the hallway when I woke up. She was waiting there, smiling, just like she always did. **But the smile wasn’t real.** There was something behind her eyes, something hollow.

“How was your night?” she asked, in that too-casual tone.

I couldn’t look at her. I couldn’t be in the same room with her. **I ran.**

I stayed with my friend for a few more days, but it didn’t feel like enough. I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were watching me. No matter where I went, no matter what I did, I felt their eyes on me.

And then, a few days ago, I got a text from my mom.

“Come home. We need to talk.”

I stared at the message for what felt like an eternity. The voice inside my head told me **don’t go back**. But I didn’t listen. I ignored the warning bells ringing in my mind.

When I stepped into the house, everything seemed normal—too normal. My mom was in the kitchen, chopping vegetables. My brother was in his room, playing video games, just like he used to. But the atmosphere was thick, heavy. There was no warmth in the air, no life in the house.

I stayed in the living room, waiting for them to come to me. And when they finally did, they weren’t my family anymore. Their faces—**completely blank**—stared at me. **And they didn’t move.**

“We’ve been here the whole time,” they said, in unison.

I tried to run. I tried to scream. But the door wouldn’t open. The walls were closing in, the air thick with something I couldn’t breathe. They surrounded me, those hollow, empty eyes following my every movement.

One of them reached out a hand—my brother, or what I thought was my brother. His fingers were long, unnaturally so. His hand twisted around the doorframe as if his joints were made of rubber. He took a step toward me, but then he stopped, his eyes never leaving mine.

“You’ll understand soon,” he whispered, his voice slithering through the air like a snake. “Everyone does, eventually.”

The house groaned and shifted around me, as though it had a life of its own. The walls seemed to move inward, squeezing me with an invisible pressure. I tried to push against them, but it was useless. The house had become its own prison.

“No, no, no!” I screamed, but my voice was swallowed by the oppressive silence. **They were everywhere now**, closing in on me, inching closer, their footsteps echoing in the narrow space between us.

I backed into a corner, my heart pounding in my chest. I couldn’t breathe. **The walls were alive.** I had to get out. I had to escape, but there was no escape.

And then, just as quickly as they had appeared, my family’s figures suddenly **vanished**. **The house was silent.**

I stood there for what felt like an eternity. Then, the door slammed open—**and they were standing outside.**

I didn’t think. I ran. I ran as fast as I could, but every step I took felt slower, heavier. The air seemed thicker with each stride. I heard their whispers follow me, growing louder as I moved.

“You can’t leave,” they said. “You’re ours now.”

I don’t know how long I’ve been running. I don’t know how long I’ve been trapped in this house.

But they’re still out there.

**Watching. Waiting.**

And I’m starting to realize: maybe I’m not supposed to leave.
