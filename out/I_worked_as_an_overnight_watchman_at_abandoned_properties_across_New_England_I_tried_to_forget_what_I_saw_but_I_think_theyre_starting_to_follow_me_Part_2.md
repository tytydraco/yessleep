It hasn’t stopped. Not for the past two weeks. I grappled with the idea of telling Emma throughout my sleepless nights, being tormented by my past while she slept soundly beside me. She knew something was wrong but I’ve been able to keep myself together. The insomnia has made work a disaster however and my boss sent me home early yesterday. He wasn’t angry but just seemed… worried about me. I’ve been so engrossed in my own world of panic and fear that has only grown lonelier and lonelier. Emma has really been the only one to break me out, even if just temporarily during our date night or while watching TV laid out on the couch. 

As I drove home last night, I tried to take my mind off of the knock by turning up the music in the car. I hoped the sound could drown out my own negative thoughts with something more positive and lively. As the first song ended however and the station went to a commercial break, my thoughts grew much darker much too quickly. 

The first commercial was for a local fast food restaurant, nothing I hadn't heard a thousand times before. The second however, noticeably dated and with crunchy, weaker audio, I had only heard once before and the sound of the opening jingle nearly sent me off the road.

Southside Square Mall, just on the outer edge of Harmon by the lonely north-south highway, closed in the summer of 2016. There were talks of what to do with the land but ultimately, it just sat empty for a lot longer than I think anybody hoped. The owners of the property did not want anyone getting inside. The first time they contracted my father’s company, it was for alarms and cameras. Kids were smarter than they thought however, and soon they were finding more creative ways inside than the floor to ceiling glass windows or boarded up main entrances. So eventually, my father was called upon again for a night watchman.

Southside Square wasn’t the location I was assigned to watch right after the boot came off but the memories of the abandoned bank or truck stop that were sandwiched between dissolved to barely a trace of a recollection. In my mind, the mall might as well have come right after the factory. 

It was the first large assignment my father felt comfortable with me undertaking by myself. After what happened at the factory, he’d been treating me differently. He always looked at me with worry and fear in his eyes no matter the conversation. He gave me smaller and closer locations and admittedly I was happy to return to the mundane nights of nothingness I’d grown to expect from the job. Time at each location was short lived however as watchmen tended to rotate jobs every month or so, especially at smaller locations like the ones my father had been giving me. Finally my time had come to draw the shortest straw. At least I thought it was at the time.

I remember pulling up to the chain link fence that surrounded the property, the headlights of the car barely able to make out the shape of the building. It seemed so far from where I stood, a sea of parking separating myself from the structure. Grass and weeds grew up from the cracks in the concrete, tire marks scarring the asphalt from kids doing burnouts and doughnuts. The exterior of the building looked tired, its entryway windows foggy and doors blocked off. The concrete walls were stained with grime and signs were faded or outright missing. Where they once hung were ghostly outlines of what once was.

The security trailer was on the far side of the mall, near the entrance which used to house the food court. The trailer was fitted the same as I’d come to expect and I spent the first night settling into the office and getting a lay of the land. The mall did not have power anymore but luckily the last owners never upgraded their directories to digital so the maps were very helpful in navigating the building. It had been a couple years since I’d been inside and in the dark, any landmarks that I remembered from when I was younger were shrouded in the shadows. Unlike my previous locations, part of the parameters of my job included walking the interior of the mall. I guess because the owners actually believed the building was worth saving in some form. 

Over the course of my first week I slowly got more familiar with the layout of the mall’s interior. I started to memorize where stores were, and sometimes remember what was there when I was younger. Towards the end a lot of businesses left the mall and were seemingly replaced by no-name cheaper alternatives. It was sort of a fun nostalgia trip for me, roaming the halls of a place that I’d once spent so much of my time and had a lot of good memories. I even found the bench where I’d had my first kiss. 

By the second week, I’d caught my first trespassers. I remember hearing rumblings of the abandoned mall when I was in high school so I imagined I’d come across kids at some point or another. It was a group of kids, probably a couple years younger than I was. I spotted them on the camera coming in through one of the old loading docks while aimlessly wasting my time in the trailer. I sighed, knowing I’d probably not get the best response from the boys. The first time I’d caught trespassers, it was at the truck stop. High school kids as well, probably from the neighboring district to Harmon. They laughed at me when I told them to leave and it took an actual call to the police to get them to listen. I guess I wasn’t the most intimidating presence. I still could’ve easily passed as one of their classmates.

I groaned as I pulled myself out of the office chair, preparing mentally for a difficult encounter and probably some name calling I’d rather not elaborate on. I grabbed my flashlight, pepper spray and baton, sliding them onto my belt and stepping out into the cool evening breeze. The overgrown trees in the islands of the parking lot swayed gently amongst the forest on the horizon but stranded in the ocean of concrete. The building loomed over me, its black silhouette contrasting with the bright, vibrant stars of the night sky. One of the few things that I truly loved about growing up in the middle of nowhere.

I trekked towards the food court entrance, light rain starting to pitter on and off as I unlocked the large security door over the glass airlock. When the door shut behind me, any sound of the outside world was squashed. The mall was dead silent. The stale air inside the building felt heavy, strangely worse than I’d grown accustomed to. I took out my flashlight and clicked it on. I walked past the empty fast food counters, only the dated tiling on the walls indicating what restaurants that would’ve once been. I grazed over each of the counters with my flashlight but it was so quiet inside the building, I could’ve heard those kids breathing. I knew wherever they were, it was a fair distance away from me. 

The main thoroughfares of the mall had seen better days. Any plants inside had either died or overgrown their pots and spread onto the increasingly cracked tile floor. Signs had fallen off or were stolen from their mountings. The occasional storefront window was smashed in. Furniture was strewn about haphazardly. Water stains dotted the white ceilings. The mall wasn’t absolutely trashed but it would’ve taken serious money to get it into any presentable state again. 

It took a good ten minutes before I finally started to hear voices, laughter at the far end of the wing I’d found myself traveling down. One of the large anchor stores sat with its entranceway wide open like a gaping mouth, revealing a truly black abyss inside where no light extended further than ten feet. The kids, two boys and a girl, didn’t notice me at the other end of the hallway as I spotted them. They were too busy peaking their heads into the abyss of the department store. The sign above their heads still displayed the store name, however the company had long since given up on Southside Square. 

I approached them as quietly as I could muster, not wanting them to run off and lead me on a wild goose chase. As much as I’d tried to study the mall’s layout, I was not confident in my hide and seek skills. I watched the kids whispering to each other, checking their phones and shining their flashlights into the empty stores around them. Before I knew it, it was time to make myself known.

“Hey, you guys can’t be in here. This is private property.” I said calmly as I approached them. I’d learned my first go around that the tough guy approached was not something I could pull off. The three of them quickly spun around and froze at the sight of me.

“W-who are you?” The taller of the two boys asked, his voice slightly nasally.

“I’m the night watchman. Now please, I can’t let you guys stay here, this is trespassing.” I explained, trying to keep a professional manner. The other boy’s eyes lit up.

“W-wait so you’re here like every night?” He questioned. He turned to the young girl, who I could only imagine was forcefully dragged into the situation. Unlike the boys, she seemed genuinely afraid of me. “Julia, he’s got to know where it is. Ask him.” He whispered to her.

“Ryan, are you an idiot? H-he’s here to fucking arrest us.” She replied angrily, still with fear in her eyes. I couldn’t help but break a smile.

“Guys I’m not going to arrest you, alright. I’m not a cop. But if you don’t leave, I will be forced to call them. And if I see you on the property again, same deal.” I tried to reassure them.

“W-wait but we need to find something. We weren’t going to break stuff or anything I swear.” The taller boy tried bartering.

“Y-yeah, my girlfriend told me about this place her friends went to and I had to see if I could find it myself.” The other boy who I could assume was Ryan, elaborated. I bit my lip for a second, genuinely a little curious about what place exactly they were talking about. I knew a few spots in the mall were pretty cool and unusual but in my own mind, none of them risked being caught trespassing. Then again, I was the one doing the catching.

“What exactly are you talking about?” I hesitantly asked, a little ashamed of myself for giving into my curiosity. Ryan nudged his girlfriend to speak. She gave him an annoyed look and stepped forward.

“We um… m-my friends told me about this store in the mall that they said they never remember being there. One of the big ones with two floors. It was like, really old looking. Like 70s old. And it… they said it messes with you. Like your head. I guess it’s haunted or something? I don’t know, they were probably lying just to freak me out since I didn’t go with them. Then these two found out and uh… I got dragged along anyway.” She explained, letting out a sigh. “I knew this was a bad idea.”

I gave her a puzzled look. I knew every anchor store in the mall, by heart at this point. They were so easily recognizable, locating them took a matter of five minutes even if you’d never step foot inside the building before. And I found it incredibly odd that anybody, even a few stupid kids, couldn’t find them all. 

“Did the store have a name?” I regretted asking as I really started to question why I was even continuing this conversation and we weren’t walking to the exit.

“No man, they just said they didn’t remember it being here. And those girls were here like every day after school when we were little. They would’ve remembered.” The taller boy answered quickly.

“It might’ve closed when they were young. And if they were experiencing anything psychological, there could’ve been a gas leak in the building. That’s one of the reasons it's not safe to be here.” I said, trying to reach logical explanations for their claims. In the back of my head however, I was deathly curious. I wanted to find this store myself, but I knew I had to do my job first. I had to escort these kids out of the mall.

It took a lot of back and forth and a few threats to the police before they finally agreed to leave. I felt like I’d spent hours going around in a circle with these kids but by the time we were back in the desolate parking lot it had barely been twenty minutes. They warned me more of their classmates were likely to try looking for the store to which I replied “Then the police are going to have a busy week ahead of them” as ominous as I could. They simply laughed as they walked back down the empty road and I rolled my eyes as I locked the gate behind me.

When I turned back around to face the mall the feeling in the air had changed. This place that I thought I’d learned like the back of my hand now had this aura of mystery and allure that I never had felt before. Even if the kid’s story was full of shit, which I assumed it was, it could be kind of fun to see which anchor they were looking for. But maybe there was more truth to the story than I wanted to believe. As much as I had tried to move on from the factory, moments of it stuck with me and when I closed my eyes, I could still see myself in that moonlit room. I could see the Knocker standing in the doorway, studying me while completely motionless. My optimistic curiosity soured as the thoughts ran through my mind and I returned to reality. I didn’t understand what happened to me that night in the factory but I know what I saw. There was danger in the darkness, especially alone. 

Feeling a grim mood rush over me, I decided not to venture back inside that night. For the first time since my first couple of nights back, I was feeling a strong wave of anxiety and nervousness. I couldn’t stay still watching the cameras. I’d constantly pace around the room, popping my head to the window to try to catch some sort of monster looking back at me. But there was never anything there. Just the empty parking lot surrounding me on all sides.

The next night I was forced back inside the mall. Southside Square’s layout was odd but there was a central corridor that all others led off or connected back to. I’d learned these different wings of the mall by the street names they were given. All named after trees except for Main, it was a relic of the mall’s earliest era but the faux street signs still stood at the intersection of every hallway. They were bolted straight into concrete which made them difficult to steal, unlike many of the newer fixtures that once dotted the common spaces of the mall.

As I passed “Pine Street”, the wing that led exclusively to a home improvement store, I noticed something peculiar. Across the way, shrouded in a somehow thicker darkness away from the shine of the moon, was a parallel wing. It has similar shops and at the end, an immense entrance to some kind of anchor store. The store’s wood paneled exterior and warm colored display windows seemed bizarrely dated for the mid 2000s fixtures and design of the rest of the mall. Southside Square had gone through several renovations and as far as I was aware, there was essentially no remnant of its 70s and 80s era heyday. But this didn’t make me interested or curious. It startled me. It scared me. It was unknown. There wasn’t supposed to be a parallel wing to Pine Street. It was supposed to be for Chestnut. I slowly turned my head to see further down the main concourse, assuming maybe I was remembering wrong. Or maybe someone had somehow switched the signs. But my fears were confirmed. Chestnut and Main crossed each other just as they always did. 

I turned to face the foreign and blindly began walking. The air felt colder as I stepped down the wing, increasingly so as I approached the anchor store. I shined my light up above its gaping entrance way. The name Randall’s was written out in script with a red with white outline. The sign seemed aged, its colors faded and washed out noticeably where light bulbs used to illuminate it. Unlike the other anchor stores, Randall’s didn’t have the theft prevention gates guarding the wide expansive entrance. Only stand up advertisement signs greeted me, listing the sales that had long since passed and new inventory that had long gone out of style. 

I stood at the entrance to Randall’s for a long time, studying the store. Trying to conjure up some kind of memory of the place. Anything to confirm to me that what I was looking at had always been there. While I could see into the store, whatever light the mall’s dirty skylights provided was snuffed out less than 20 feet in. It left the dark shadows of shelves, mannequins and displays up to the imagination. My flashlight’s beam barely penetrated into the store’s sales floor, leaving me just as in the dark, so to speak, as before. A draft blew over me from within the cavernous opening of Randall’s, the wind whispering through my ears.  It sent a shiver down my spine as I finally started to back away from the storefront. I wanted to know more, desperately so. But it didn’t feel right. The entrance to the store felt like a venus fly trap waiting for its prey to walk inside. 

It was a ridiculous thought, I knew that. It was just a building, brick, steel and concrete. It couldn’t hurt me, not any more than any other abandoned building that is. I thought about how I was overreacting as I walked back to the security trailer. As I opened the door to step inside, I looked back at the mall and tried to spot where Randall’s would’ve been located. The anchor stores were quite obvious from the outside, more so than any other store. I counted the big brown and beige boxes that stuck out from the sides and ends of the mall, listing which store was where. But I couldn’t find Randall’s. Not for the life of me. I cast my eyes across the building multiple times. It should’ve been clear as day. Another bump in the hills and valleys of the mall’s outline. But it simply wasn’t there.

I didn’t leave the trailer for the rest of the night, trying to take my mind off of Randall’s and the school of questions swimming in my head. The isolation, the silence of the space I found myself in made my thoughts simply echo off the walls of my brain. I watched the clock tick agonizingly slowly as the sun finally started to peak over the horizon line. Grabbing my things, I waited impatiently by the door for my relief. 

Leonard pushed open the door fifteen minutes late, something I honestly did expect but desperately hoped wouldn’t have been the case this morning. He was a tall, lanky man in his late twenties. Shaggy brown hair was kept at bay by the cap nestled on his head and his five o’clock shadow was haphazardly shaved. I remember him working at the fast food restaurant downtown when I was little. He was always nice to me from behind the counter, and made sure I got the toy I wanted in the kid’s meal. You never forgot a face in Harmon. Everyone knew everyone and most of us would never leave.

I asked Leonard about Randall's when he walked in the doorway but he wasn't of much help. The man was barely awake as usual and didn't even register my question until I said it for the third time. "N-no Adam, it's really not ringing a bell. If I think of something. I'll leave a note for you on the desk, alright?"

On my drive back home, I yawned as I sought through the radio stations. The early morning didn’t net a lot of good results up in the middle of the scenic nowhere I called home. As I passed between two of the stations I knew did come through, something came through the static on a station I didn’t recognize. At first it was subtle, barely audible above the white noise. I took my hand off the dial, genuinely curious what was coming in over what I could only have imagined was a rare long distance station. It was unrecognizable, just a hint of music along with voices. As I came to a red light however, I turned up the volume and tried to decipher what was coming through. The static slowly faded and the transmission began to clear up. It sounded dated however, something recorded onto an analog machine with that tinny sounding voice you’d hear on old tv shows.

“-for your family this summer. Randall’s is the only place to shop. We can’t wait to see you very soon.” A dated, midwestern accent read. A short jingle followed, telling the listener the best price and best service was only a short drive away. “A store so special you’ll never want to leave” it ended with. The commercial then started over. And I listened to it again, and again, and again. The same jingle, the same scripted voice. The same slogan. After the third time, I knew I wasn’t going crazy and I wasn’t just sleep deprived. Randall’s was real. And it wanted to make sure I believed it.

My father was sitting in the family room with my mom, watching the morning news while sipping on freshly brewed coffee. I could smell the aroma as I walked through the kitchen door. Both my parents turned to look at me as I stepped through the doorway, warm smiles on their faces. Since Sean had left, I was the only one left for them to give attention to. Sometimes that was a blessing, other times it was a curse. 

“Hey kiddo, how was your night last night?” My dad asked, but I didn’t answer him. My mind was elsewhere and I walked past them like a zombie. “Was Leonard late this morning again, I noticed you… came in… late.” His words fell off as I swung myself around the stairs. Out of the corner of my eye I saw my parents’ smiling facing morph to concerned looks. My brain was filled with nothing but fear and questions, and I didn’t know which was fueling which more. I couldn’t even give them an attempt of acknowledgement. I was physically and mentally exhausted.

“Richard, see what’s going on with him. H-he didn’t look right.” I heard my mother insist to my father from the top of the stairs. My dad let out a sigh.

“Yeah… yeah there’s something up. I can tell. I uh… see what I can find out. You know how he gets though.” He replied, groaning as he stood up from the couch and put down his mug on the coffee table. “I hope it’s not… work related. Especially after what happened back in May.”

“If it is, we’re going to have to have a talk about this. I know you say he’s up to this but… he’s our son, Richard.” My mom insisted.

“Oh trust me, Rach. We will.” He agreed. I was already shutting my bedroom door as I heard his footsteps race up the stairs in chase of me. I laid out on my bed, rubbing my temples as I prepared for the interrogation I was about to receive. My father knocked on the door right on queue.

“Hold on Dad, just… I need a second.” I pleaded, my voice exhausted.

“Adam, please open the door.” My father said quietly but with a hint of firmness in his tone. I heaved myself to my feet and swung open the door.

“What?” I asked plainly, my brain already starting to shut down for my morning nap. It was a routine I wasn’t proud of but staying up all night, it was the only way to recharge.

“Did something happen last night at work? Because your mother and I both know when something’s going on with you, kiddo.” He gave me as sincere a smile as he could, even chuckling a little as he finished speaking. But behind his expression I could tell he was concerned. It was the same look as when he first laid eyes on me in the emergency room.

“Dad, have you ever heard of a department store in the mall named Randall’s?” I asked flat out, completely ignoring his question. I think no matter how I intended to respond to him, the same answer would’ve come out whether I liked it or not. He stared straight at me, stiff as a board. His face didn’t move a muscle and for the first time I truly couldn’t get a read on my father’s normally very expressive face. All I could see were his eyes and they did not change. He was scared. I’m just not sure if his fear came from the question I asked or the anticipation that I might’ve asked it. After a moment, he collected himself, loosed up and spoke three words as clear and calm as ever.

“No, I haven’t.” He told me. His eyes burned into mine, desperately awaiting my response. I nodded slowly.

“Well I um… just thought I saw something about it in the mall.” I lied, “An ad on the floor or something. Just… never remembered it being there is all.”

“Your memory serves you right, that store doesn’t exist as far as I can remember.” He told me. “Could ask your mom though, she was usually the one to take you shopping.” 

“Right yeah… maybe I will. It’s just I caught these kids last night and they were saying something about a store that wasn’t on the mall maps so I thought since I didn’t remember Randall’s-”

“Adam, I personally have surveyed that property a dozen times. At this point so have you and you tell me, is there an anchor store called Randall’s that you’ve seen?” He wondered, genuinely looking curious to hear my response.

I hesitated. “N-no, I don’t think so.” I finally replied. 

“Then what are we getting so worked up about, kiddo?” My father questioned, trying to return to his positive mood. “I mean are you really letting some kid’s creepy story get to you?”

“No, i-it wasn’t even creepy.” I had to admit, telling the truth without at all indulging in the details of my night. “It just was uh… off putting. I-I was on edge the whole night.” My father put his hand on my shoulder, sitting me down on my bed beside him.

“Listen, I know you had a rough start to the job. What happened was… it wasn’t what I wanted. And that was a one in a million chance.” He paused for a moment, trying to word what he wanted to say next. “And I just… It’s important that… I-I want you to feel safe. We don’t get a lot of crazies out here squatting in these places. You know that by now. This job is supposed to be pretty straight forward, you know? Low stress. And seeing you walk in here looking like you saw a ghost, ignoring your mother and me, that doesn’t seem like a low stress night on the job.”

“Y-yeah I’m sorry, Dad. I should’ve at least said hi to you guys. I just… had a lot on my mind. And I really am exhausted.” I apologized, still trying to justify myself as much as I could.

“It’s alright, Adam. Just… don’t let those stories get to you. They’ll drive you crazy, especially when you have the whole night alone to think about them.” He advised me, standing up and stretching his back. “If you want to talk more about anything, you know I’m always here. A-and as your dad, not your boss. Just to clarify.”

I cracked a smirk, couldn’t help it. “Y-yeah, Dad. I get it.”

“Good, good. Listen, I’ve got to make a couple appointment calls this morning but if there’s anything you need me for, I’m pretty open this afternoon.” He offered.

“I’ll see when I wake up.” I told him, yawning a little.

“Of course, of course. I won’t delay that any longer.” He assured me. “Oh and Adam, I know I probably don’t say this as much as I should but… love you, kiddo.”

“Thanks Dad, love you too.”

He nodded as he slipped out of my room and pulled out his phone from his pocket. I watched him quickly dial a number as he headed for his office at the end of the hall.

“Yes, can I speak to Dr. Ackerman… It's urgent.” There was an insistence in his voice as he grabbed the door behind him and tugged it to shut as he stepped inside. “Hey this is Rich from \[redacted\] Securities-” The door closed behind him with a slow clunk. From there, my father’s voice was an unintelligible garble. 

What little I caught of the call concerned me. He was clearly lying to my face about speaking to clients, I wasn’t an idiot. And who he did call did not seem like his medical doctor. I thought it must’ve been the property owner at the time. But that wasn’t what actually scared me.

My father asked me if I’d ever seen an anchor store called Randall’s. And while I’ll readily admit I lied straight to his face. Something I felt very guilty doing. He had done the same. I knew the second he’d asked that question because I never told him Randall’s was an anchor store.

The entire day I didn’t speak to anyone in the house. My mom was out running errands and my father kept his distance from me. He ended up going into the office in the afternoon and it left me completely alone in the quiet of an empty house. I debated with myself for what felt like hours whether I should look for Randall’s that night. If I would even find it where I’d left it the night before. And if I did, should I step foot inside? The painfully curious side of my brain was almost begging my more rational side to let loose and just walk in. But I knew there was something wrong with that place. And in my gut I knew it was stupid to walk in alone. So I called the only person who’d be stupid enough to take the leap of faith with me.

“Hey man, what’s up? You off work tonight or something?” Devon asked as the phone finally connected. His voice seemed monotone, as if my call had woken him up despite it being 3:30 in the afternoon. It wouldn’t have surprised me.

“No I uh… ok this is going to sound stupid.” I opened, my own tone more serious.

“Most of what you say is, Adam.” He joked back. I rolled my eyes.

“Very funny.” I said sarcastically. “But seriously, do you remember a store at Southside Square called Randall’s? Like an anchor store not inside the mall.”

“I… I don’t think so. Wait, aren't you watching that place these days?” he remembered.

“Yeah, the past couple of weeks actually.” I confirmed. “So you’ve never heard of Randall’s at all?” I reiterated.

“N-no dude I really haven’t um… can I ask why exactly you’ve got your panties in a knot over this?”

I gave him the entire rundown of the past two nights, the kids looking for the store, the rumor going around their high school, then my own encounter with Randall’s. I tried my best to describe the area I found myself in but he didn’t really understand.

“Adam, I'm really struggling to understand what you’re telling me. So there’s a part of the mall that all of us just didn’t notice existed for however many decades the place has been open? I looked it up while you were talking and I could not find a single thing online.” Devon tried to wrap his head around the idea, clearly thinking I was either high out of my mind or losing it.

“I-I don’t know, Devon. I don’t think it ever existed. And everyone I’ve asked has said the same. But I know what I saw.” I assured him, being as stern as I ever had been with my best friend. Devon let out a sigh.

“Alright Adam, I believe you think you saw whatever you saw but I-I honestly don’t know what else to say here man. Is… is there something I can do? Do you need help? Anything man, you know I’ll be there.” He offered, sounding both concerned and desperate.

“I want you to come to work with me tonight.” I said plainly. 

“A-are you sure that’s-”

“It’s fine, my dad won’t care.” I interrupted. “And if he does… I’ll deal with it, it’ll be fine. I just need… I need someone to tell me what I’m seeing is real. Or maybe that I really am just crazy.”

“Well, you know I won’t pass up a free ride to an abandoned place. And to tell you you’re going crazy. When should I be there?”

“Swing by around 5:30.” 

“I’ll be there.” He assured me.

Devon was always exactly on time, it was a bizarre skill that I never seemed to master. And today was no different. He knocked on my door at 5:30 on the dot just as I was throwing my shoes on. We jumped in my car and started heading down towards the south end of Harmon. The mall wasn’t far from my house, but then again nothing was. We sat at the traffic light, the sun’s evening golden rays shining over the tree line and gently accenting the building in the distance. The radio station had gone to commercials but we didn’t bother changing it. We were too busy talking. It felt good to talk, especially to Devon. It kept my mind off the job that I was going back to. 

“You know I haven’t been in that place in a couple of years. Honestly it was still pretty clean, I don’t think a lot of people had figured out a way in. How’s it looking these days?” Devon wondered, his gaze drifting to the abandoned mall.

“It’s not the worst I’ve seen. People definitely did their fair share of damage though honestly. Lots of tags, broken windo-” I froze in mid sentence. The radio had gone static in the time I started to speak and it took me just that split second to recognize exactly what had started playing.

“A-Adam? You alright, man?” Devon looked at me concerned.

“D-do you hear this song? T-the commercial?” I stuttered my way out. The Randall’s commercial played as loudly as its poorly recorded audio could muster, echoing through the car’s tired speakers. Devon listened intently, and I watched his expression shift as he started to realize it was exactly, to a tee, what I had described to him over the phone. 

“I-it’s the-”

“It’s the same fucking thing, dude. The same thing I heard this morning after leaving work.” I confirmed. “I’m telling you, there is something wrong going on.”

“A-are you fucking with me, Adam? Because I swear to god if-”

“I’m not.” I said sternly.

“W-why does it just keep repeating?” He asked, his voice trembling just slightly. I shook my head as the light finally turned green.

“I-I don’t know. Let’s just… get up there and out of the car. Turn off the radio.”

“Didn’t have to tell me twice.”

The mall loomed over us as we drove up through the gate. Leonard had already left, as was usual, and I locked up before we made it to the security trailer. The silence in the car as we traveled over the cracked asphalt ocean was agonizing but Devon, the one who I hoped would keep my own brain in check, was thoroughly freaked out. I hadn’t seen him like this since we’d tried to shortcut through the woods while trick-or-treating in fourth grade.

We stopped in the security trailer momentarily and I gave Devon a quick tour. I looked for a note from Leonard but as I expected, it was nowhere to be found. Devon tried messing around with the cameras, telling me it was just because he thought they were cool. However I could tell in his eyes, he was looking for something in particular. I didn’t let him look for long, I knew he wouldn’t find anything on the cameras. I’d already tried. I handed him a flashlight from the locker and took one for myself. 

“Come on man, let’s go. We’re just… wasting time.” I insisted. He stood up from the desk, the chair rolling back to the wall.

“Right… delaying the inevitable. I-I just don’t know exactly what the inevitable is.”

“Neither do I.” I admitted.

The interior of the mall looked the same as I’d left it. Devon was like a kid in a candy store, throwing up his phone and taking pictures of everything that we passed. I felt like a father having to drag his kid around the mall. And I suppose in a sense I was. Even if Devon was two months older than me. 

While he was taking pictures, I was watching the street signs. Willow, Maple, Chestnut and finally Pine. I put my arm out to stop Devon as I stared at the eerily dark hallway to Randall’s. He gave me a confused look before his eye caught the faded red sign.

“H-holy shit. But I didn’t see-”

“You wouldn’t have. I didn’t either.” I admitted to him. We both slowly approached the entranceway, the coldness becoming increasingly noticeable as the gaping mouth of the store grew larger and larger in front of us.

“Jesus Christ, Adam.” Devon exclaimed as we stopped right on the threshold of the tile flooring. I could see the goosebumps on his arms. “This is not… this isn’t normal. This feels wrong.”

“I know… but we need to know what it is.” I took the first step forward, looking up at the doorway and expecting giant teeth to chomp down on me. But nothing happened. I walked inside just like any other store in the mall. Devon hesitantly did the same. We walked further inside, not saying a word but conveying a thousand with our just eyes. The store was quiet, deathly so. It felt like a soundproof room, separated from reality through every sense. 

Our flashlight beams seemed to shine dimmer as we walked further. The store was becoming colder, so much so that I was shivering with my security jacket on. Our steps became more hesitant and without even realizing it, we were holding onto each other’s sleeves. We were enveloped in the deepest, most isolating darkness I’d ever experienced. I could barely make out Devon next to me, but I felt his hand shakily clenching my shirt. That’s when I started to hear him scream.

His hand dug into my arm and I first I was both confused and terrified. My best friend began crying hysterically, calling out names. Some I recognized, some I didn’t. He tried to run but I held him back, terrified of losing my only source of tangibility. 

“A-Adam, w-why are they talking to me? W-why are they doing this? P-p-please just make it stop!” He pleased with me, nearly falling to his knees. I nearly broke down crying myself. I’d never felt so helpless. I couldn’t even see my best friend, only hear his own suffering as he held onto my arm. 

“I-it’s going to be ok, Devon. We’re going to get out of here I-I swear.” I tried looking around for anything. Shelves, a sign, furniture, a landmark. But the darkness had consumed it all. The store was so dark, I was starting to question whether my eyes were even open. I started to feel things brush pass me as I dragged Devon along aimlessly. He stumbled behind me, crying hysterically. My heart was beating out of my chest as my steps forward became more difficult. The things brushing past me became to feel like a crowd of people I was wading through. I could hear their unintelligible whispers in the voices of people I could easily recognize. My mom, dad, grandparents, aunts and uncles. Dead, alive or otherwise, their voices filled my ears as I pushed forward and dragged Devon behind me. My ears were overwhelmed and I could feel the tears starting to streak down my face as I felt whatever stamina I had left giving out on me. My leg finally gave out and I tripped over something in the darkness. I collapsed to the ground and took Devon down with me. I felt his arm momentarily lose its grip before desperately clawing at the fabric of my sleeve to recapture it. 

When I looked up, all I saw in front of me was the messy, abandoned center corridors of the Southside Square Mall. Devon was still behind me, laying flat out on the tile face down balling his eyes out. I turned my head behind us at the façade of Randall’s. Its security gate was shut, the metallic structure old and rusted, as if it hadn’t moved in 30 years. Behind it you still couldn’t see further than twenty feet inside. But amongst the shadows I could see people shuffling from within. And they were staring at us, looking right into my eyes. I turned my head away, never daring to turn back. I threw up right there on the floor and completely broke down, crying next to my best friend for what felt like hours.

I never walked past Pine Street again. I always lied on my reports, and never dared follow any trespassers. I'd just sit in the trailer and call the police. Devon and I agreed to never speak of what happened again. And I didn’t hear from him for over a month. Luckily we’re still as close as ever, something I was worried wouldn’t be the case after Randall’s.

I never again asked a soul about the department store Randall’s, the anchor store that doesn’t exist. And I never heard a soul speak of it in return. No mention that it ever had or ever would exist. Not until just two hours ago last night. I haven’t told Emma. But I think I need to. She saw it on my face, there was no hiding it. I’m scared, terrified. And at this point, I don’t know what I should do. I think I should call Devon but I don’t know how he’ll respond. I can’t just keep letting these things happen because one of these nights Emma’s going to be waiting for me and I’m not going to come home.
