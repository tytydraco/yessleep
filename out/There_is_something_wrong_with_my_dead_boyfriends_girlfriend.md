I am a 21 year old bisexual man, I was born male if that makes any much of a difference. I am a med student, I will not say from where but it is Farley well known. Every since I was a child I’ve wanted to be a doctor, I’ve always wanted to help people it makes me so happy. 

I just recently started dating my boyfriend(Xavier) and he was recently in a car accident, I’m not sure what happened but apparently his girlfriend of 4 years was with him. I don’t understand if i should be mad or sad, he died. But oddly enough, she was fine. The car set on fire, ON FIRE. But not a scratch on her, the doctors said she’s lucky to be alive, but no one knows how she has not 1 scratch on her, not one, and what’s even weirder is she is not acting like how you would act if your boyfriend of 4 years died. It’s like she doesn’t care, not like she tries to make it about herself or she just acts like a teenager at a little siblings party or something like that. She just.. looks on edge.

She looks around frantically and talks to herself, she laughs under her breath whenever his name is mentioned, his family swear she had green eyes.. but her eyes are this bright purpleish red, not something you would forget or mistake as green. 

The first time I met her I told he said they broke up and told her how long we were together(11 months) and she kinda laughed me off. She said she could Tell something was up and just thought he was going to either propose or leave her. Which like… weird right? How can you not tell the difference, I talked to his family and they said he broke up with her that’s why they never told me, me and his sister were best friends through high school(he was a year older) and I never really knew him but last winter we got close but nothing happened because of his girlfriend, but apparently he never did.

All of us got a cabin where he lived, he lived a few states away for college his girlfriend was living with him but I assumed she moved out. And by all of us I mean me, the girlfriend let’s call her Vicky , his sister aka Alex, his dad Dave, and my daughter Lexi. My daughter is 5, her mother died in childbirth and we were teenage parents, my daughter shared a room with David and Alex, but Vicky insisted on having her own room so I had to sleep on the couch.

I don’t think this is Vicky im hearing screaming and growling coming from her room, I just know it’s not her, i don’t know why but something isn’t right? Because… Vicky died of cancer 2 months ago, everyone is on edge, who is this thing in my cabin. I’m writing this while laying on the couch, I’ve been writing this for the past 3 weeks from Xavier’s death to now, I have a bad feeling and Vicky’s door just opened.
