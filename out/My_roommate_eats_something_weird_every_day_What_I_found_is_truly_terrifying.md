I never thought I’d be one of those people posting here again. You know, the ones who start with “This is real. I need help.” But I don’t know what else to do. I can’t go to the cops. I can’t move out right away. And I definitely can’t let my roommate know that I know.

Let me start from the beginning. Something Wrapped in Plastic 

I work at the coroner’s office. It’s not a glamorous job, but it pays the bills, and honestly, I’ve always been morbidly curious. You learn things about the human body that most people will never know. You also learn to recognize it—every texture, every shade of muscle, every shade of fat. Human meat doesn’t look like beef or pork. It has a distinct color and grain. And once you’ve seen enough of it, you can never mistake it for anything else.

That’s why, a few weeks ago, when I opened the fridge and saw something wrapped in plastic on my roommate’s shelf, my stomach dropped. It was deep red, with a strange marbling of fat. Too lean to be beef. Too dark to be pork. Too thick to be chicken.

I knew what it was instantly.

It was human.

I stared at it for a long time, my fingers gripping the fridge door so tightly I thought I might rip it off. My brain kept trying to rationalize it. Maybe it was some kind of exotic meat? Maybe he had a weird diet? Maybe—

I closed the fridge and stepped away.

I didn’t want to know the answer.

He Eats It That night, I pretended everything was normal. My roommate, Ben, sat on the couch, shoveling something into his mouth while watching a movie. I forced myself to sit next to him, to glance at his plate.

Raw.

It was still raw.

I could see the sheen of moisture, the thin trails of blood pooling on the plate. He wasn’t even cooking it. He was just eating it .

I swallowed hard and tried to keep my face neutral.

“Hey, man, what… uh… what is that?”

Ben looked at me mid-chew, his eyes dark, almost amused. He swallowed before answering.

“Venison,” he said. “You want some?”

I shook my head, forcing a laugh. “Nah, I’m good.”

He grinned, then went back to eating. I watched as his teeth tore into the flesh, as his lips stained red with blood. I wanted to vomit.

That night, I barely slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the bodies in the coroner’s office, their flesh peeled back, the muscle tissue exposed. I saw Ben, sitting there, chewing, swallowing, licking his fingers clean. The Camera I had to know.

I had to know where he was getting it.

If I called the cops and I was wrong, I’d ruin his life. If I called the cops and I was right … I’d ruin mine. I needed proof.

So I bought a security camera. A tiny one, easy to hide. I set it up in the kitchen, pointed right at the fridge. If he was bringing in weird meat, I’d see it.

For three nights, nothing happened. Ben came home, made normal food, and went to bed.

On the fourth night, everything changed. The Footage I woke up around 3 a.m. to my phone buzzing. The camera had detected motion.

I opened the app with shaking hands and tapped on the notification.

The screen loaded, showing a grainy, black-and-white image of the kitchen. Ben stood by the counter, his back to the camera.

Then, he stepped aside, and I saw it.

A body.

A woman.

She was lying on the counter, limp, one arm hanging off the edge. Her face was turned away, but I could see her hair, long and dark, spilling onto the floor. I could see the slackness of her limbs, the unnatural way they bent.

And I could see the knife in Ben’s hand.

He started cutting.

I couldn’t breathe. I watched, frozen, as he worked methodically, slicing through her skin, peeling it back, exposing the red muscle beneath. He cut strips from her thighs, her arms, her stomach. He wrapped them in plastic, carefully, neatly, like someone packaging leftovers.

Then, as if he could feel me watching, he turned toward the camera.

For one, horrible second, he just stared.

Then he smiled .

And turned the camera off. Nowhere to Run I haven’t left my room since.

I don’t know if he knows that I saw. I don’t know if he’s waiting for me to come out. I don’t know if I’m next.

All I know is that I can hear him in the kitchen, humming to himself.

And I can smell something cooking .
