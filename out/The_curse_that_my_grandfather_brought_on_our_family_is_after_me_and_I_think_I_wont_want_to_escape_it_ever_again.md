Another long, exhausting night waiting tables at the restaurant had finally come to an end. It was almost midnight, and I was heading home. The street was pretty dark, even though the streetlights buzzed softly over my head. Out of breath from the warm summer air, I walked toward the end of the street, where my grandma’s house stood, the place I’d been living in for about a year now. I moved in two years after she passed away, once I realized college and nonstop studying just weren’t for me.

“Enough running table to table. Time to sleep,” I muttered as I reached the door. Just as I slid the key into the lock, a quiet, but pretty clear sound echoed from inside.

Knock.

Knock.

Knock.

Three slow knocks. From the inside of the door.

“You’re hearing things, Steve,” I thought, even though my nerves jumped. I really needed sleep.

The next morning I woke up with a headache after barely getting five hours of restless sleep.

By afternoon, I got ready and headed to work. The restaurant greeted me with the usual chaos: customers talking over each other, servers rushing around with plates and drinks. I waved at a few coworkers, they waved back.

In the locker room I ran into Gary, a fellow server and my best friend.

“ 'Sup, Steve?” he asked, cheerful as always.

“Nothing much, man,” I said. “Ready to argue with rich Karens again?”

He smirked. “We've gotta tell the boss to put up a ‘No Karens Allowed’ sign.” He slapped his forehead. “Dude… yesterday was brutal. I have no idea how I didn’t get fired.”

“You handled it well,” I said, patting his shoulder. “Let’s survive another day.”

“Deal,” he replied, tying his apron. “Table six just sat down.”

“Showtime.”

The evening went smoothly. Customers came and went, happy with the food and service. There was a ton of work, but I barely felt tired thanks to the four cups of coffee I’d downed during the day.

When the shift ended, Gary offered to drive me home.

“Thanks for the ride, dude,” I said as I got out.

“You're,” he replied, leaning out the window. “Just me a beer tomorrow.” He laughed.

“Deal. We’re watching the game tommorrow, remember?”

Gary didn’t answer. He frowned, his eyes darting left and right.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Come here,” he whispered, motioning for me to get closer. He stared at a spot across from my house. “Someone’s standing over there.”

I looked but couldn’t see anything. “Where?”

“Behind that tree,” he said, pointing.

And then I saw it. Half of a human-shaped figure, hidden in shadow behind the tree in my neighbor's front yard. No details at all. Just a shape.

“Holy sh...” I muttered.

Gary suddenly stood up and opened the trunk. He pulled out two wrenches and tossed one to me.

“Cover me,” he said, urgency in his voice.

“Hey! Who are you?” Gary shouted as we approached. “Step into the light!”

The figure didn’t move.

“Gary, I'm not sure this is a good idea.”

Then the figure slipped completely behind the tree. We rushed around both sides,
and found nothing.

“That’s impossible,” Gary said, frustrated. “It just... vanished.”

“Seems like it,” I replied, just as confused.

A few days passed. Work stayed the same. At home, I did the things that made me happy. I went out for drinks with coworkers. Everything felt normal, like I’d never heard the knocking or seen the shadow.

I knew I wasn’t crazy. Gary had seen it too.

On my day off, I decided to spend the evening at home with delivery tacos and a good movie. Once the food arrived, I settled onto the couch and turned the TV on. Perfect night to relax.

Then I felt it.

An icy breath against the back of my neck. I jumped up.

Something was here.

Something that chilled me to the bone.

The TV image started glitching, then shut off completely.

Something was wrong.

I checked the house. No open doors. No open windows. And cold wind in the middle of a Texas summer didn’t make any sense.

On my way back to the living room, I stopped in front of my grandma’s bedroom door. I wasn’t sure I should go in. Something inside me resisted, maybe grief, maybe respect. I opened it anyway.

I flipped on the light. Everything was exactly as she’d left it three years ago: the old wooden desk, the wardrobe, the neatly made bed, personal items and dusty books on a shelf. I took a careful step toward the window, and tripped on the folded edge of the rug. I fell forward, catching myself on the shelf.

Something heavy fell to the floor with a dull thud. I knew instantly what it was.

A golden plated statue of a muscular man with the head of a dog or a wolf. Old. The gold plating chipped on many spots. Around its neck was a pearl necklace. In one hand it held a staff, sitting cross-legged on a round base, as if guarding something.

“No way she kept it after so much time…” I whispered.

It was the statue that terrified me as a kid. Whenever we visited my grandma, she always hid it so I wouldn’t see it, though she clearly adored it. I never understood why.

I put the statue back and left the room.
The next day after my morning shift, Gary and I sat at a bar for some cold and refreshing beer, the Texas sun blazing outside.

“By the way,” Gary said, “have you seen that guy again? The one hiding?”

“Nope,” I said. “Hasn’t shown up since.”

“Any idea who could that be?”

“No clue. Probably some teenager sneaking out of his girlfriend's window.”

“Maybe,” Gary laughed.

I looked at him, and something felt off. His face seemed to change shape, and his skin painted like a stone.

“Just be careful,” he said, his voice suddenly deeper, doubled. “If something happens, run.”

I froze.

Then Gary blinked. “I mean, if it was just some teen, a fellow dad would’ve chased him, right?” He was himself again.

“Oh,” I said, pretending to catch on late. “Yeah… right.”

“You okay, man?” he asked. “You seem distant.”

“I’m fine. Just tired.”

But I knew it wasn’t just tiredness.

It was night and I had just left the restaurant to go home. It was pretty warm night. As soon as I made it to the next block I saw the silhouette standing in the passage between two buildings. Human body, and the head a bit too wide, but still unclear to make out the contours. I focused my glance, and it glitched out, like a distorted TV signal.

A few blocks later, I saw it again standing by a power pole. And again, human body with an unclear and big head. It seemed as if it watched me from distance, but I couldn't make out any details to be sure. It just stood still.

I got home, locked the front door, and stepped into the shower. It was refreshing after a long, exhausting afternoon. I wanted peace and nothing else…

Knock.

Knock.

Knock.

Three slow knocks on the bathroom door. The sense of refreshment instantly turned into a fight-or-flight situation.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a bathrobe, grabbed the metal shoehorn, and started looking around. Whatever it was, it had to be close. The hallway light began to flicker, then the bulb burst. I flinched at the sound. The TV in the living room turned on by itself, then shut off. Suddenly, all the lights in the house started flickering.

“Welcome to the Upside Down,” I joked nervously.

Then I noticed a silhouette sprint past behind me, heading toward the stairs to the upper floor, toward my bedroom. I went upstairs and saw the thing standing in the middle of the hallway. A tall, dark silhouette shaped like a human.

“What are you?” I asked. “What do you want from me?” I was just as terrified as I was desperate for answers.

The figure stood there, completely motionless. It was as if it were staring straight at me. But now I could see its head. It was a wolf’s or dog's head, wide and furry, with pointed ears and a snout, and piercing emerald green eyes. The other details became clearer too. Its body was male and muscular, and it wore a pearl necklace around its neck, just like my grandmother’s statue. There was also a staff strapped to its back.

I stood frozen, unable to step closer or run away. A cold wind raged through the room, and I was shaking, both from the cold and from fear. I had no idea what was happening.

Then I heard a whisper. “Be careful… When it happens, run.”

As soon as it ended, the wind intensified like a storm, and then silence. Everything went still, and the figure was gone. All that remained was the open door to my room, and the open window.

What did that thing mean?

I immediately went to my grandmother’s room and began digging through her belongings. I found my grandfather’s old journal; he had died many years before I was born. After a long time flipping through pages and reading, I finally found how he had obtained the statue: he had found it washed up on a beach near the bay where he often went fishing. Much later, armed thieves broke into their home, this very house. The statue came to life and chased the thieves away, but not before appearing as a shadow for a week beforehand. Later, when they were in a car accident, the same statue pulled them out of the crushed vehicle. After speaking to a clairvoyant, they were told that the statue had a bound spirit that would protect them from evil as long as they kept it, and that it would remain a loyal guardian for as long as the family bloodline endured.

Now I understood that the thing I had seen was actually trying to protect me from something dangerous that was yet to come.

The next evening, I was working at the restaurant. The same noise as always: guests talking, cutlery clinking, soft and pleasant music. Everything seemed normal, even though I knew something was going to happen.

I noticed a man in a suit sitting alone at a table. He kept putting his phone to his ear and looking around.

“Keep an eye on him,” I whispered to Gary when I ran into him in the dining area.

“Why, Steve?” Gary asked, confused. “You’re freaking me out.”

“Just watch him,” I replied shortly and headed to the kitchen to pick up food orders.

As soon as I entered the kitchen, the young assistant cook, Enrique, came running and crashed into me.

“Watch it, kid,” I said.

“Sorry, Steve,” Enrique replied cheerfully and ran off. He was clearly in a hurry.

Everything in the dining area seemed normal. The man in the suit was gone. I found Gary.

“Where the hell did he go?” I asked.

“He left. I charged him for the food and he left a big tip.”

“Okay,” I said, nodding.

“By the way, what’s up with Enrique?” Gary asked.

“No idea. He just ran out of the kitchen.”

“I think he went outside and still hasn’t come back.”

“Excuse me,” an elderly woman called out. “It’s kind of cold in here. Could you turn off the air conditioning?”

“Yes, right away, ma’am,” Gary replied. Then he turned to me, confused. “Did you by any chance turn the AC on?”

“Nah, it’s been off for an hour,” I said. I shuddered as a cold wave wrapped around me too. The thing was here.

“Did you feel that?” Gary asked, rubbing his shoulders.

“Yes. Just keep an eye out for anything unusual.”

“What do you mean?” Gary looked confused.

“Long story. I’ll explain later.”

I kept working, serving the guests. New faces came and went, and I searched for the culprit among them. Paranoia had taken hold of me.

I noticed Enrique returning to the kitchen.
Suddenly, the power went out, and total darkness fell over the restaurant. Panicked screams echoed from the guests.

“Please stay calm,” Gary called out, trying to settle everyone down. “A minor power outage. It’ll be fixed soon.”

I headed toward the storage room next to the kitchen. I ran into Enrique as he was coming out. He had most likely shut off the power.

“What did you do?!” I grabbed him by the collar, furious.

“Run,” he said. “If you want to live, run.” Then he broke free from my grip and fled.

I found the power switch. It was damaged, which meant I couldn’t turn it back on.

Through the back door, I saw two people quietly and cautiously enter. I grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprayed them in the face. One of them managed to knock it out of my hands and was about to hit me over the head.

“Watch out, freight train coming!” Gary shouted, pushing a cart full of dishes and slamming the two intruders into the storage room. I got up and locked them inside.

“You okay, man?” Gary asked.

“Great. You?”

We headed back into the dining area, where Enrique had pulled out a gun and was firing into the ceiling. “Give me all the money!” he shouted at the guests.

There was a loud crash from the kitchen, and the two intruders came out, guns in hand, taking hostages.

Suddenly, a cold wind swept through the room, and a dark silhouette began racing around. First it took down Enrique, then it went after the other two, who dropped the hostages.

“This is it,” I said to Gary. “The shadow we saw. It’s visited me many times. It’ll protect all of us.”

“Cool,” Gary said, too stunned to ask any question.

The two intruders fired around wildly, but it was useless, they couldn’t shoot the silhouette.

Then the silhouette began dragging them, along with Enrique across tge floor, and toward the front entrance, just as the police arrived.

The police too care of the assistant cook amd his two friends as the silhouette appeared across the street, just watching. It pulled its staff out and sat on the sidewalk, proudly. The job was done.

The next morning, Gary and I met in the park near the restaurant, plastic cups of hot coffee im hand.

Gary wasn’t joking anymore. He wanted answers. “You’re gomna tell me I didn’t imagine what happened last night, right?”

I told him everything. About my grandmother and grandfather, about the room I never wanted to open, about the statue, about the silhouette that had followed me long before it saved our lives. It wasn’t there to haunt me, it was there to protect me. To protect me as my grandfather's descendant.

Gary listened without interrupting. When I finished, he said, “Good thing it’s on our side." He held his coffe cup up. "Cheers in that name."

And yes, we clinked with coffee.

"Still can't believe my family had an otherworldly guardian all these years."

"Sounds nuts, but true. I'm glad it's handy."

That same day, as soon as I got home, I took the statue down from its dusty shelf. I cleaned it and placed it in the living room, in a spot worthy of it: up on the commode, as if on it's own pedestal, to watch over in good and bad, utterly silent.

Until it manifests again through shadows.

Now I knew why my grandmother adored the statue so much.
