My name is Nora Miller. I’m twenty-three, which is old enough to know better but still too young to actually do better. I moved to Lakeford last spring and took a job answering phones at a property management office. It pays the bills, and the air conditioner wheezes along just well enough to keep me from melting in the summer.

My nights are all the same: microwave dinners, collapsing on the couch, scrolling my phone until the blue light burns holes into my eyes. 

A few Saturdays ago, my roommates dragged me out of the apartment. “Dragged” is the right word. Kelsey and Brooke had already decided we were going out, and I was the cargo they had to haul.

The place was called The Boat-House. The name made it sound quaint, like somewhere you’d drink lemonade with your grandmother, but really it was wedged between a pawn shop and a tax office on Main. The entire block pulsed with bass and car exhaust.

Inside, the floor stuck to my shoes. Mason-jar lights dangled like drunk fireflies over the tables, and a chalkboard sagged above the bar with drink specials written in fat bubble letters. Everything was loud, hot, and ordinary. 

Safe enough.

I’m not built for crowds. I stuck to the wall like a damp leaf, holding my phone up as camouflage, pretending I had an urgent text from someone who didn’t exist.

Kelsey and Brooke were already two rounds in, shrieking with laughter, waving at me to join them on the dance floor. They looked like they belonged. I looked like someone trying not to be mistaken for a lost child.

So I clung to my drink.

When my friends ducked into the restroom, he slid into their space.

“Move over, sweetheart.”

He didn’t wait. He carved out space with his body, his size filling the air. Tall, shoulders squared like a fighter, hair clipped sharp like a catalog model. Shirt tight across muscle. The smell of soap and aftershave sliced through the swamp of spilled beer.

I edged an inch to the side. “I’m waiting for my friends.”

He flicked his eyes toward the restroom line. “Those two? They’ll be a while.” He drummed a finger against my glass. “What’s this?”

“Peach mule.”

“Cute,” he drawled. The word dangled in the air, smug and rough. Then he added, “Let me get you a real drink.”

“No thanks.” I shifted half around, a motion that should have ended things. It didn’t. He stayed planted, close enough that if I tried to leave I’d brush against him.

“Come on,” he coaxed, his smile sharpened thin. “Don’t be rude. I’m being friendly.”

“You’re blocking me in,” I said.

His smile changed like a door slamming shut. Quick. Cold. “I like to see what I’m buying.” His gaze crawled down my body, then back up, unhurried as a hand. “You come here often, Nora?”

My stomach knotted so hard it made me want to bend over. I hadn’t told him my name.

“Smile for me,” he said.

“No.”

That word landed like a stone dropped in water. His expression wavered, not anger but disappointment, as if he’d practiced a trick and I’d ruined the ending. He rolled his shoulders, leaning in, trying to loom taller than the room would let him.

“You don’t know me,” he said. His tone suggested that was a problem I ought to solve.

Before I could answer, someone else slipped into the space. Not loud. Not aggressive. Just present. Same height. Same eyes. Same face. For one dizzy second the world doubled, like I was looking through a warped mirror.

Twins.

“Stop,” the new one said. His voice was steady, the kind of steady that makes you want to trust it. “You’re scaring her.”

“I’m talking,” the first one snapped.

“You’re going too far.” The second one’s voice didn’t rise, but the weight in it carried. He turned to me for half a beat, and something in his face made the air feel easier. “I’m sorry. He does this.”

“I do what?” The first barked a laugh. “I’m being nice.”

“Your nice has teeth,” the second said. His tone dropped lower. “Walk.”

“You’re not my keeper.”

“Walk,” he repeated, softer, but with an edge that caught.

They stood squared, like warped reflections in a funhouse mirror. One rigid as steel rebar, the other loose, coiled, as if he could move either way. For one heartbeat I braced for fists to fly. Instead, the first clicked his tongue, shot me a glare, and dissolved back into the crowd.

The second stayed in place until his brother was fully gone, swallowed by the press of bodies. Only then did he step back, just enough that I could breathe again.

He let a breath slip from his lips. His voice was normal now, and tired. “He’s drunk. I should’ve stepped in sooner.”

“I’m fine.” My voice cracked. I cleared my throat and tried again. “Thanks.”

“Do you want some space? I can stick around, make sure he doesn’t circle back until your friends return.”

“That’s nice of you.” I pulled out my phone, thumb hovering over the rideshare app. “I think I’m going to head out.”

He nodded, like he understood. “Good idea.”

We stood in the kind of silence that should have been awkward but wasn’t. He kept his hands at his sides, no reaching, no angling in closer. He didn’t ask for my number. His eyes kept moving, sweeping the crowd like a guard dog watching over his pack.

“Does he do this a lot?” I asked finally. My voice sounded smaller than I meant it to.

“Often enough,” he said. “He thinks if he pushes long enough, the world just tips his way. Sometimes he’s right.” He shook his head. “Still not an excuse.”

“I don’t like being cornered.” The words slipped out sharp.

His mouth pressed thin. “I’m sorry you had to deal with him.”

Before I could answer, Kelsey appeared in a rush, cheeks bright red from laughing or liquor, with Brooke trailing like a kite tail behind her. “We’re closing out,” she announced, then squinted at me. “Are you okay? That guy looked like a total jerk.”

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, holding up my phone. “Calling a car.”

“I’ll wait with you,” the twin offered. He didn’t say it to me so much as he said it to my friends, like he was asking permission. “Just until it arrives.”

Kelsey narrowed her eyes, half protective, half nosy. “Do you know him?”

“No,” I said. Then I realized I wanted too. “But he’s okay.”

Something eased in his face, and he gave a small smile, the kind that tugged only one corner of his mouth. “I’ll stay five feet back. Scouts honor.”

We stepped outside into a wall of summer air, damp and sticky, the kind that clings to your skin like an unwanted hug. Smoke from someone’s cigarette curled across the sidewalk, blending with the tang of car exhaust. From across the street came the sound of a man juggling while a woman filmed him, her laughter drifting over traffic. 

“Text me when you get home,” Kelsey said, giving my shoulder a squeeze.

“I will,” I promised.

Then they were gone, back into the bar, their laughter swallowed by music. My app said seven minutes until my ride. 

“Again, I’m sorry about my brother,” he said. His voice had a weight to it, like this wasn’t the first apology he’d given. “It isn’t your job to deal with him.”

“It shouldn’t be yours either,” I said.

That got a laugh from him. “Somebody has to. He hunts for reactions. If he doesn’t get one, he just pushes harder.”

Then headlights swept over us. My ride. He stepped forward and opened the back door, then backed away again as if to prove he wasn’t going to press his luck.

“Thank you,” I said.

“Get home safe.”

I paused, one hand on the door. “What’s your name?”

He hesitated. “Cal.”

“I’m Nora.”

“It was nice to meet you, Nora.” The words came out awkward, as if he wasn’t used to meeting people.

“Can I give you my number?” he asked. His voice was careful, almost apologetic. “No pressure. Block me if you want.”

He said it like a hook, not a line. I held out my phone. He typed quickly, then stopped, hesitating. “Maybe I shouldn’t. I don’t want to push you.”

“It’s fine,” I said. “I asked your name, didn’t I?”

That coaxed the number onto the screen. He handed the phone back, watching me like I might suddenly regret it.

“I’ll head back inside after you go,” he said. “I don’t want to see my brother right now.”

“You don’t like him much.”

“I love him,” Cal answered, his voice gravel. “I just don’t like who he is when he’s prowling.”

That word lingered like smoke in my ear long after the car door shut.

At home, I sent two quick texts: one to Kelsey, one to him. *Made it. Thanks.*

His reply came back almost instantly. *Awesome, sleep well*

And that was all.

Two Saturdays later, just past noon, my phone lit up.

*Do you like tacos.*

The period at the end felt deliberate, like he had thought about it too much. I stared at the screen, amused and oddly nervous, then answered yes. A moment later he sent the name of a place on River Street, the kind with big windows that stared straight at the water. Seven o’clock.

I showed up early, because that is what I do, and lingered outside longer than I needed. The glass reflected my own face back at me, pale and uncertain, before I pushed inside.

He was already there. No grand gesture, no fake surprise, only a small wave, like he wasn’t entirely sure I’d come. His shirt was clean, plain jeans, and a baseball cap folded neatly on the seat beside him.

When I reached the table, he stood quickly and pulled out my chair, then looked embarrassed for it.

“I don’t go out much,” he admitted. “But I figured you’d be hungry.”

“I’m always hungry,” I said. That, at least, was true.

The air smelled of lime and fryer oil. My stomach growled in appreciation.

We ordered, and while we waited, he asked about my job. I told him the usual: broken water heaters, angry tenants, endless paperwork. Then I added how last week the office printer and fax machine had both died on the same day. My boss, who barely knew which end of a screwdriver to hold, was helpless. So I bought myself a little multi-tool keychain.

I showed him how the screwdriver folded out, gleaming in the restaurant light, and told him how it saved me from three hours of calling tech support.

“You carry that everywhere?” he asked.

“Now I do.”

His smile came fast and genuine.

I asked him about his life, the kind of questions that felt safe but still personal. He said he worked at a gym and helped coach high school wrestlers when the season rolled around. 

Then his phone buzzed on the table. He didn’t glance at it, only turned it face down like it might glare back.

“You can answer,” I said, thinking maybe it was important.

“It’s fine. Just Rhett.”

“Your brother?”

His mouth tightened. It wasn’t much, but enough to see. He gave a single nod. “Yeah.”

The food came then, mercifully, a pair of plates steaming with tacos. He attacked his with lime and hot sauce until the tortillas sagged under the weight. I laughed after my first bite sent half the filling sliding onto the plate in disgrace.

He wordlessly passed me a napkin, his mouth tugging into a crooked half-smile.

We swapped scraps of history. I told him about the town I grew up in, where the summer festival was just a parade of tractors dressed up with crepe paper. He chuckled, said he’d moved a lot as a kid. He didn’t offer reasons, and I didn’t press. 

His phone buzzed again, rattling faintly against the wood. This time he looked.

G.Boy: *Where are you*G.Boy: *Pick up*G.Boy: *We had plans*G.Boy: *Are you with her*

Cal locked the screen fast.

“Does he always talk to you like that?” I asked.

“When he’s been drinking,” Cal said, his face flashing regret like a ripple in water. “Sorry. Shouldn’t drag family stuff onto a date.”

“You didn’t,” I told him. “He did.”

That earned me a flicker of a smile before he pressed the phone face down again, the way you’d close a book you were tired of reading.

We lingered long after the plates had been cleared, until the waitress wiped every other table around us and began stacking chairs.

When the check came, he signed it without even glancing at the total. His fingers drummed the pen against the slip of paper, quick and restless, as if he were working up to a confession.

“I don’t want to go home tonight,” he said at last.

I thought about my own apartment. Kelsey and Brooke were probably already half-drunk with their music blasting, questions waiting like knives left out on the counter. The thought made me bold.

“We don’t have to go back to mine either,” I said. The words startled me even as they came out. “Why don’t we… go somewhere else? Maybe find a movie. In a room. Just us.” I caught his eyes and shrugged, as if to soften the suggestion.

For the first time that night his face lit up, sudden and boyish, like sunlight spilling over a wall. It pulled a laugh from me before I could stop it.

“Then yeah,” he said. “If you’re sure.”

“I’m sure.”

We drove in his truck with the windows cracked, warm air rushing in. The radio hummed soft. A pawprint bandanna dangled from the rearview mirror, fluttering like a tired flag every time the wind slipped in.

At the hotel desk he glanced at me first, waiting for the smallest nod before he asked for a room. The clerk didn’t bother to look up, just slid a keycard across the desk.

The room itself had the kind of characterless personality all hotel rooms share. A window that stared straight into the parking lot. A framed print of oranges in a bowl. He kicked off his shoes and sat gingerly on the edge of the bed, like he wasn’t sure if he should disturb the perfectly tucked blankets.

We turned on a movie and let it play in the background. He leaned back slowly, the tension in his shoulders easing the way ice cracks when spring finally warms the river.

When he reached for my hand, the touch was feather-light, as though he were asking a question instead of making a move.

“Stay,” he said. His voice was soft. “Only if you want to.”

“I want to.”

The kiss that followed was not cinematic. It was the kind of kiss two people share when they want the noise of the world to go away for a little while. He was careful, then not, the way care can slide so easily into hunger when you give yourself over to it. I won’t write the details. This isn’t that kind of forum, and it isn’t the point.

Later, much later, I woke in the dark to the blue blink of the cable box. His arm was heavy across my waist, the weight of it steady and anchoring. He slept the kind of sleep that looked earned, deep and unmoving.

My phone buzzed with a text from Kelsey: *Are you alive?*

I sent back a thumbs-up, then rolled my eyes. When I glanced at the dresser, Cal’s phone sat dark, a flat rectangle of trouble waiting to wake. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t need to. I already knew what would be waiting when he turned it back on.

In the morning, pale light slid through the curtains and turned the oranges in the framed print into little suns. He stretched, scrubbed a hand across his face and looked at me, not smiling exactly, but lighter than I had seen him before.

“You really are a sweetheart,” he said. His voice was deep, almost uncertain. Then, after a breath: “Can I see you again?”

I surprised myself by answering yes. The word came easier than I expected, like it had been waiting at the back of my throat all along.





Weeks passed, and we slipped into something that looked like dating even if neither of us named it. Coffee before my shift one morning, lukewarm and rushed but still enough to count. A walk by the river where the gnats glued themselves to our arms. I sent him pictures; he sent his own. Plain things. Good things. Quiet, no drama.

Then on Friday he texted: *Let me show you something, fresh start*

*Fresh start?* I typed back.

*From Rhett, I’m done picking up after him* 

The words hit me in the soft place under the ribs. *Okay,* I wrote. *I’ll be there.*

That night we sat on a bench by the river, sandwiches unwrapped on our laps. The water was the color of tea as the sun folded itself behind the warehouses. Cal kept studying my face like he was reading a gauge, and I only realized why when he reached out and brushed his thumb near my cheek. I’d been carrying a streak of mustard like a mask.

“I did it,” he said.

“Did what?”

“I’m not living with him anymore.”

“You moved?” The words tumbled out too fast, too eager.

“For now I’m on my boss’s couch. Nothing special, but Rhett doesn’t have a key.”

“He’ll be mad.”

“He already is. That’s not your problem.” His eyes stayed on mine. “I wanted you to know before we decide anything. I want to see where this goes.”

“I’d like that,” I said. “To see.”

His smile then was small, unpolished, but real.

“Fresh start?” he asked.

“Fresh start,” I echoed.

“Come on,” he said suddenly. “Let me show you my shop.”

“Your shop?”

“Technically my boss’s,” he admitted. “But after hours the bays are mine, as long as I keep the place clean.”

I blinked at him. “So you’re a wrestling coach and a mechanic?”

For just a second his expression faltered. A tiny pause, as if the question had thrown sand in his gears. Then something shifted behind his eyes, quick and hard to name, and he smoothed it away with a shrug.

“Yeah. Off-season,” he said, voice too casual. “Gives me a little more free time.” He tacked on a smile, easy and weightless.

The shop was tucked behind a row of storage units, their numbers painted on crooked like they had been added by a drunk with a brush. White siding scuffed from years of weather, the roll-up doors chained shut.

He flicked a switch inside. Rows of tube lights buzzed to life overhead, sputtering before they caught. 

“This is where you disappear to when you vanish on me?” I asked.

“It’s my therapy,” he said. His hand brushed the edge of a workbench. “Cheaper than the other kind.”

He led me past a Camaro on jack stands, its insides stripped bare. Next to it sat an old F100 in gray primer, the kind of truck that still remembered farm fields. Near the sink, a battered radio waited. He turned the dial, coaxing it to life, and soft vintage music spilled out. The sound felt too gentle for the shop, like lace in a barn.

“You do all this?” I trailed a finger over a door panel polished smooth as a seashell.

“With help,” he said. “I’m good at the boring parts. Now sit,” he said, patting the fender. “Tell me three things you’d do if money didn’t matter.”

The question caught me off guard. I thought for a moment. “I’d fix the dangling light in my apartment so it stops swinging every time the neighbors stomp upstairs. I’d learn how to make bread that doesn’t double as a brick. And…” My eyes swept over the rows of cars, parts scattered like puzzle pieces. “I’d buy a car that actually starts when I need it to.”

His grin came quick, flashing in the pale shop light. “We can handle one and three tonight.”

I laughed, shaking my head. “The bread’s still the dream. But I’ll settle for a car.”

“Then come with me.” Cal’s voice carried across the shop. He stood beside the Chevelle. “Pop the hood release on your side. We’ll pretend she’s yours.”

I tugged the handle and the hood rose slowly, creaking like something waking from a long nap. Cal leaned in with an ease that suggested this was his church and the engine his altar.

He pointed out belts, lines, reservoirs, explaining each one as if he were translating a foreign language. Complicated things became simple in his mouth, and the shop lights caught in his eyes as he bent closer.

I found myself watching him more than the machine. There was no show in it, no swagger. He wasn’t performing for me. He was sharing, and that was better.

Then the side door rattled.

Cal paused. “I locked that,” he murmured, the words meant more for himself than for me.

A second noise followed. The faint kiss of rubber on concrete. Then nothing.

“Probably a cat,” I offered. 

He didn’t answer. Instead, he moved forward, shoulders tight, angling his body so I was tucked behind him. His gaze fixed on the shadow pooled near the stacked tires.

“Stay here.”

“Cal-” I started, but he was already moving. His hand closed over a heavy flashlight on the bench, and with a sharp click he sent a beam cutting across the concrete.

Dust rose and sparkled in the light, like tiny insects caught in amber. The beam slid across crates, a blue tarp sagging over something bulky, the long metal leg of the lift.

Then something moved. A dart of black slipping fast between the cars.

Cal froze mid-step. I did too, every muscle in my body caught in that same stillness.

“Who’s there?” His voice had dropped, deep enough that the words seemed to drag along the floor.

The answer came in the form of a shape, peeling itself out of the shadow between the lifts.

It was tall. Broad. A mask covered its head. Nothing playful or cheap about it. Black leather formed into a snout, seams stitched tight like scars. Metal rings caught the flashlight beam, gleaming cold. Silver studs lined the jaw where teeth should have been, giving the illusion of a mouth that could never close.

It breathed, but the sound came out warped, dragged through rubber, rasping like air caught in a funnel.

Dog, but not a dog. Human, but not human.

The figure tilted its head, a slow, unnatural angle, as though considering which way to peel the skin from a problem. In one hand it gripped a wrench, short and heavy, its weight obvious even in the beam of the flashlight. The other hand dangled, loose and patient, as if waiting its turn.

“Rhett,” Cal said. The name left his mouth like a stone, heavy. “Take it off.”

The mask gave nothing back. But the body inside it moved.

He lunged forward, fast enough to blur. Cal’s hand caught mine, shoving me aside so hard my hip cracked against the corner of a bench.

“Behind me,” he snapped.

The figure kept advancing.

“Rhett,” Cal said again, his voice flat now, stripped of anything kind. “Take it off.”

The head tilt lingered, then the wrench lifted, and the figure closed the distance in a skater’s glide, smooth and practiced.

Cal met him in the middle. Metal struck with a sharp, ringing crack. The wrench smashed down on the flashlight, bursting its light in a single brittle pop that rattled my teeth. Cal threw his shoulder into the figure’s chest, driving with force enough to push him back two long steps, the rubber soles screeching over concrete like tires losing grip.

“Run!” Cal barked. His eyes never flicked from the figure. “Side door!”

My body moved before my brain caught up. I bolted, heart hammering, only to find a thick chain looped through the push bar. My stomach dropped so hard I thought I’d be sick. That chain hadn’t been there when we came in.

I clawed at the hook, fingers slipping, nails scraping against cold metal. It wouldn’t give. The door stayed stubborn and solid beneath my weight.

“Try the other door!” Cal’s voice was tight with effort. He was backing up toward the bay, his body a barrier between me and the mask.

I sprinted to the roll-up, seized the dangling chain, and hauled. It rattled in my palms, strong and thick. The door groaned, lifted an inch, then jammed with a violent shudder. The lock bars were still thrown.

Behind me the men moved in a circle, both predators. The masked figure feinted left, then darted right, fast as a snake. Cal tracked him step for step, the symmetry almost obscene, as if they’d rehearsed this dance a hundred times before.

“Top latches!” Cal shouted. “Both sides!”

I reached up, fingertips scraping cold metal until they caught the first latch. It gave with a stubborn click. I fumbled for the second, popped it free, and the door jolted upward.

I grabbed the chain and hauled. The door groaned and rose a little higher, half a foot maybe, before freezing in place. A slice of orange streetlight poured through the gap, narrow as a knife wound.

Dropping to my knees, I shoved my shoulder into the opening, grease smearing my shirt as I tried to wriggle under. The gap bit into my ribs. I couldn’t fit.

“Too small!” I gasped.

“Shit,” Cal snapped behind me.

The masked figure swung its head toward me. The silver studs lining its muzzle caught the light, sharp as fangs. Each breath rasped wet and hollow, the sound of something dragging air through broken plastic tubing.

“Eyes on me, Rhett,” Cal growled. The figure lunged toward him, swinging the wrench, and Cal slipped just out of reach.

“Office hall!” he barked, never looking at me. “Break room, past the soda machine!”

I spotted the hulking soda machine and lunged for the nearest door. It swung open into a cramped room: a scarred table, an old microwave, a corkboard cluttered with yellowed softball flyers. No exit.

“Keep moving, Nora! Door at the end!” Cal’s shout was closer now, ragged with strain.

My lungs burned, fire running up my throat as I shoved through a swinging gate and into a narrow aisle of shelves. Boxes and bins rose higher than my shoulders, each one labeled in blocky handwriting. Fuses. Hose clamps. Springs.

I turned left and spotted the gray door waiting at the very end of the aisle. My hand closed around the handle, slick with sweat, and I yanked it open with all the hope in the world that it led outside.

It didn’t.

The smell hit first. Bleach overlaid with something coppery, sharp as a coin pressed against water. 

The space was bare, windowless. A rolling stool stood crooked near the wall. In the center, a drain darkened the concrete. A pegboard hung heavy with tools, their outlines traced in black marker so no piece could ever go missing. On a shelf sat a pack of zip ties, a roll of duct tape, a tarp folded neatly.

And there, anchored dead-center, was a chair bolted into the floor.

Behind me, the latch gave a soft click.

I spun toward the doorway. Cal stood there, breath coming heavy, sweat darkening the collar of his shirt. For half a heartbeat I thought relief might flood me. Until his eyes caught mine and shifted. Not much. Just enough to tell me something was off.

“You made good time,” he said, letting out a breathless laugh that didn’t belong in the moment.

The hinges groaned again. Another figure shouldered past him. Rhett. The wrench dangled from his hand, tapping a lazy rhythm against his thigh. With one hand he dragged the mask halfway up, baring a grin underneath, wide and shining with spit.

“You should’ve seen your face,” he panted. “Perfect.”

My back hit the sheet wall before I even realized I was moving. “This isn’t funny,” I managed. “What the hell is this?”

“Oh, it’s hilarious,” Cal said. His grin was creeping wide, the kind boys wear when they’ve hidden in someone’s closet and can’t wait for the scream.

Rhett’s shoulders shook beneath his leather jacket. His voice came muffled but bright, like static through a speaker. “She’s great,” he said. “Better than the last one.”

“The last one?” My tone barely carried.

Cal tilted his head, studying me the way someone studies a caged animal they’ve spent weeks fattening up. “Yeah. It’s a family tradition. One of us plays the bad boy, the other plays the good boy. We take turns. Keeps things interesting.”

“Cal,” I said, my voice breaking around the name. I wanted it to matter. I wanted to believe if I said it enough times, the man who smiled shyly over tacos would step back into his skin. “You don’t have to do this.”

His answer was laughter, piercing and echoing, ricocheting off the metal walls like loose nails in a dryer. “Don’t have to?” he repeated, eyes wild with the joy of it. “Nora, this is what we do.” He craned his head, and the apology I’d once trusted was gone, burned out of him. “Don’t get me wrong. You’ve been fun.”

Rhett stepped forward, mask tugged low again, his voice slipping into a cartoon snarl. “But not as fun as what comes next.” He spread his arms wide, inviting the room to applaud. “Welcome to the show.”

Cal reached for the switch and slid the dimmer low. The light shrank until the corners of the room pressed in. “We like to give the full experience.” 

Rhett moved in wide circles around me like a wolf testing the edge of the pen. He stopped beside the heavy chair planted in the center of the room and slapped the backrest with a flat crack of palm against metal. “She’ll look perfect right here, won’t she, Cal?” His head bobbed with a cocky rhythm as he leaned on the chair. “Tell me, Nora. What’s your favorite scary movie? How does it end?”

Cal’s eyes caught the thin light. “She likes happy endings,” he said. “That’s why she picked me.”

The two of them broke into a holler, the sound of boys who had found a new cruelty to share in.

I edged backward from the chair until my calves knocked into the lip of a rolling table. My hand slid over the surface, searching blindly, until it closed around something with weight. A screwdriver, long and solid.

Rhett noticed the shift in my eyes and wagged a gloved finger at me like I was a child reaching for a cookie jar. “Ah-ah. Hands where I can see them.”

“Let her take it,” Cal said. His voice was almost sweet. 

I lifted the screwdriver, knuckles white around the handle. My hands looked steady. Or maybe I only prayed they did.

“Cal.” My grip tightened around the screwdriver. “Move.”

His mouth curved in something too sweet to be real. “We’re past that, Nora.”

I told myself I’d drive the blade into him if he got close enough. I told myself I’d be quick. He studied me a moment, then stepped forward, almost tenderly, like someone coaxing a child out of a tantrum.

“Go on,” Rhett urged, his voice a coaxing growl. “Do it. Stab him. He’s right there.”

I lunged. The screwdriver cut a straight line for Cal’s ribs. But he was faster. His hand snapped out, clamped around my wrist, and twisted until the pain screamed up my arm. My fingers betrayed me, opening on their own. The screwdriver clattered to the floor and rolled away.

“Atta girl!” Rhett barked through the mask, his gloved palms smacking together in a mockery of applause. “She really tried.”

Cal nudged the fallen screwdriver with the side of his boot and sent it skittering across the floor into shadow. “Knew you’d swing, Nora. Good for you.”

Before I could grab anything else, Rhett came in from the side like a bear lunging at its prey. His arms clamped around my ribs and lifted me as if I were nothing more than a doll. He slammed me down into the metal chair. The back of my skull smacked hard against the steel frame, and for a moment the room smeared at the edges. “Sit still, sweetheart.” 

Cal crouched close, his eyes glinting in the half-light, slick and dark as river stones. “Wrists first, Rhett. Don’t bruise her too much. She’s got to look good for the finale.”

Rhett grunted in agreement and bore down. The first tie cinched tight around my wrists, biting until my fingers went numb. Another loop yanked my ankles together, locking with a sharp scream of plastic teeth. I jerked hard, but the cords only dug deeper, cutting little half-moons into my skin.

“There we go,” Rhett said, straightening and admiring his work. “All snug.”

Cal stood and dragged a folded tarp from the shelf and shook it open, the plastic crackling as he spread it flat across the concrete. 

I forced myself to breathe slow. Keep still. Keep my face slack, as if I had already given up. While their backs were turned, I shifted just enough to work my fingers toward my pocket. My keys dug into my palm, sharp edges biting until I found what I wanted: the little multitool I never left behind.

I bent my wrists awkwardly, sawing the tiny blade against the tie. The jagged edge scraped plastic, each grind loud in my head.

Cal leaned on the workbench and swiped the back of his wrist across his damp forehead. “You wanna know why we hate you?”

“No,” I snapped, the word tasting bitter.

He ignored it. His voice stayed even, almost bored. “Because women like you are weak. They fold. Our mom was proof of that. Rolling through town in her chair, useless. Couldn’t talk, just cried.”

To punctuate it, he made a low, broken keening sound from the back of his throat. Rhett’s head jerked at the noise like a dog catching a whistle. Then he added his own note, a high-pitched yip, answering like they’d rehearsed it.

“You’re sick,” My voice shook and Cal’s voice lost its false calm, rough edges spilling through. 

“We fed her, cleaned her up, and listened to her whimper every single day. You know what that does to a kid?”

Rhett swung the wrench in the air like a baton. “And our [father ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5swpqf/the_handler/)made her that way. Took her tongue so all she could do was bark. Taught her to heel like a mutt. That’s what we grew up with. Not a mother. A dog.”

“She wasn’t weak,” I said, twisting against the ties until the cords bit deeper. “She survived.”

Cal scoffed, cruel and curt. “Survived? She begged for scraps like a stray. Lived in his shadow even after he rotted in prison. You call that surviving?”

Rhett slammed the wrench against the wall. The clang bounced through the room. “We crawled on all fours when we were kids,” he said, his voice breaking into something raw. “Barked right along with her. Didn’t even know it was wrong. We were her pups. That’s what Dad called us in his letters. His bitch and his pups.” For a moment his swagger slipped. Then he snapped it back. “You know he never called us sons? Not once.”

Cal laid a length of chain across the tarp, straightening each link with neat little tugs. “So we made our own kind of family bonding time. This. Our hunt. Our turn. And we’re better at it than he ever was.”

They stared at each other then, feeding on the ugliness between them.

I pressed the tool harder into the edge of the tie. One thread snapped, then another. I kept my face slack.

Cal leaned close, his breath hot on my cheek. “You’ll break the same way she did. They all do.”

My eyes stayed down while the little teeth of the multitool chewed through more plastic. Eventually the zip tie gave way with a tiny crack, soft as a twig snapping underfoot. I froze, forcing my freed wrist to hang limp so they wouldn’t see. A quick flex sent blood rushing back into my hand, pins and needles stinging, but I kept my expression blank. Ankles still bound. Arms free.

Cal picked up a pair of pliers. His eyes glazed and bright at once, like something fevered that had found a flame. “So,” he murmured, snapping the pliers open and shut, “ready to beg, Nora?”

“Not yet,”

His mouth curled at the ends. “We’ll get there.” He clicked the pliers again, close enough the air in front of my nose cracked.

Rhett leaned over the back of the chair, peering at me like a child admiring a trapped bug. “I like her,” he said, voice muffled under the mask. “She’s making us work for it.”

Cal’s tone slid down, almost coaxing. “Don’t worry, Nora. Once you break, it’ll be quick. Quicker than most.”

I lifted my chin, the words spilling out before I could think better. “You’re pathetic. Your dad owns you.”

Something awful flashed in Cal’s eyes. He leaned in close enough for me to feel the tension off him. “Careful, bitch.”

I didn’t give myself the chance to hesitate. My hand came up fast, the multitool’s jagged teeth already biting at the air. Cal’s eyes went wide, but not wide enough. I drove the blade into his left eye with every ounce of strength I had left.

The sound was wrong. A wet, meaty pop, followed by a howl that seemed to rattle the bolts in the walls. He reeled backward, both hands flying to his face, blood seeping hot and fast through his fingers.

“Jesus Christ!” Rhett’s voice cracked, the wrench slipping from his grip and clattering against the floor. He lunged toward his brother. “Cal! Oh my God, she-”

“She got me,” Cal croaked. His voice was ragged, broken at the edges. “That bitch got me.” Blood poured down his cheek in a dark curtain, soaking his shirt, dripping to the floor in fat drops. He started to laugh even as the sound wavered with pain. “She really did it. She really fucking did it!”

They were caught up in each other, Cal shrieking, Rhett fumbling to hold him, both too busy drowning in their own chaos to notice me. That was the only opening I was ever going to get.

I wrenched my legs sideways, twisting until the plastic cut into my skin. The tie at my right ankle gave with a sharp snap. I bent forward, working the bloody tool against the other, sawing in frantic jerks until the plastic finally split.

I lurched up from the chair, half stumble, half desperate run, my legs screaming with pins and needles.

Rhett’s head snapped toward me. “Hey!”

“Get her!” Cal bellowed, clutching the ruin of his eye with both hands, blood streaking down his arm. 

The hallway smeared around me, my vision tunneling as I ran. My shoes slid on patches of oil, every step a fight to stay upright. I dragged one hand along the wall, scraping skin raw just to keep my balance.

Rhett’s laugh echoed after me, high and giddy, like a child on a carnival ride. “She’s fast! This is great!”

I burst through the break room, nearly tripping over the edge of a chair, shoved hard against the soda machine, and bolted into the narrow hall. The side door glared at me like salvation. The chain still coiled through the bar. I clawed at it, nails splitting back, breath wheezing in my throat. Not locked, just knotted. It slipped once, my fingers sliding off slick with sweat. I yanked again and the knot came free.

The bar shoved forward and the door flew wide.

The night air hit me full in the face, crisp and damp, like being slapped with a wet sheet. I ran harder, legs pumping without rhythm, body all panic. Behind me the door banged open, and their voices spilled into the dark, yowling and wild, the sound of hunters too drunk on the chase.

“Run, Nora!” Rhett’s voice cracked with glee.

The lot stretched open, a flood of orange light from the street lamps making every shadow look thinner. I wove between parked cars, ducking low, lungs tearing themselves raw. My vision tunneled until it felt like I was running down a dark pipe. I screamed, over and over, because it was all I had left.

I aimed myself at the glow of the corner lamp, as if the yellow light could burn them away. I didn’t dare look behind me.

A porch light snapped on across the road. Someone shouted, startled and sharp. “Hey! What’s going on?”

“Help!” My throat tore with it. “Call the police! Please!”

Doors opened in a scatter. More lights came up. A woman stood framed in her doorway, phone clutched. “I’m calling 911!”

The night behind me stayed empty.

Sirens began as a faint whine, then swelled until the sound filled my chest. My legs gave out. I crumpled onto the first porch I reached, knees buckling, body shaking so violently I couldn’t keep upright.

The woman with the phone knelt close. She didn’t touch me, her hand hovering in the air like she was afraid one wrong move would shatter me completely.

“They’re coming,” she whispered. “You’re safe now.”

I wanted to believe her. I wanted to, but my body wouldn’t stop trembling.

At the station I spoke until my throat gave out, the words rasping like sand. I told them everything: the shop, the chair, the mask, the chains. I said their names over and over so no one could pretend they hadn’t heard me. And when I got to the part about the screwdriver, about driving it into Cal’s eye, I sat up straighter. I told them he’d be bleeding badly, that they wouldn’t be able to miss him.

The police went through the shop like ants through sugar, flooding every corner with flashlights. They found the chair bolted to the floor, the chains dangling like dead snakes, the tarp spread neat and waiting. Bits of cut zip ties still curled on the ground, and the screwdriver lay where it had skittered out of reach.

But there were no brothers. No mask. No blood trail leading out the door. Cal and Rhett had already slipped into the dark. 

They still haven’t caught them. Not yet. Somewhere out there, Cal and Rhett are slinking through the cracks of this town, waiting for the right hole to crawl into. But they’re not the same anymore. I did that. Cal’s eye is gone. The mirror between them is broken.

Good. Let them bleed with it.
