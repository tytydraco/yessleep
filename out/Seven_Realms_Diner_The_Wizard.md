[Last part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oqwu95/the_seven_realms_diner_what_actually_happened_on/) / [My whole experience](https://www.reddit.com/user/Practical-Way8041/comments/1ocdy74/the_seven_realms_diner_series/)

First of all, I’m really sorry for taking so long to update, but these past months have been really calm. Until they weren’t. And then I had to recover emotionally from what happened on Christmas, which I hope to tell you about very soon. But meanwhile, please enjoy some more of my suffering. 

After Halloween, we all needed some time to process and heal—especially Roger. But soon enough, both of us found ourselves back at the diner doing our jobs, much to Roger’s joy. For the time being, he was stuck at home and in the kitchen at the diner. And the last one was only because he was too stubborn for his own good. 

He was driving everybody crazy. The sheriff himself begged the doctor to let him go back to work, provided he accepts to use his crutches. (He doesn’t. But I’m not a snitch, so only you get to know.)

What about me? Well, I still hungered for answers, and I hadn’t been able to get any since that night. 

But you know what they say. Be careful what you wish for. 

This story begins on a night when, somehow, the only customer was the devil himself. (Lucien)

Lucien had a facetious smile on his face. That should’ve been the first warning. But I let my guard down. It was so easy to do so around him when he wasn’t actively being a jerk. 

He was sitting in his usual chair, sipping on his usual cup of O-, when he began staring at me. The mischievous gleam in his eyes should’ve been my second warning.  

“You know… I feel like mixing it up a bit tonight,” he mused, staring at his cup. “How about some AB+ instead?”

I knew that smile. And I thought that I knew what he was doing. He wanted to get under my skin, since—at least according to him—*my* blood type was AB+. So, I just rolled my eyes at him before walking to the blood station, pretending I wasn’t giving him the satisfaction. 

However, as soon as my hands landed on the A+ and B+ pitchers, he spoke again. 

“That won’t be necessary, Bloody,” his smile widened, and he rose from the chair. “I think I’ll just get it from the source tonight.”

A shiver ran straight down my spine as I remembered exactly how it felt to be the source.

“Have fun,” I panted, refusing to turn around to allow him to see how much he’d affected me. I hate showing weakness. “Just remember to pay before you leave.”

He chuckled, walking to the other side of the counter to face me. He leaned in, and the corners of his mouth widened even further. 

“I don’t think you understood me, Bloody.”

I swallowed hard, trying to breathe past the lump in my throat, and I forced myself to smile. Of course I knew what he meant. He wanted my blood. I was mostly certain that he was joking, but the memory of the bite still made me afraid.  

“Ha ha. Very funny,” I turned around. 

“It wasn’t a joke,” he admitted.

I instantly whipped around. 

I began slowly backing away toward the kitchen door, fully aware that if I tried to run, it would be in vain. He had to be joking. Wasn’t he?

“Now, now, Bloody. No need for that,” he took a step back and rose his hands in the air. “It’s not just thirst, I promise. I want to run an experiment.”

I just shook my head, still backing away. He closed his eyes and sighed as all traces of amusement abandoned his features.

“I can promise that this is for your own good.”

I didn’t respond. Instead, terror froze me in place.

Why he was doing this to me? Sure, he was an evil vampire or whatever, but we were *friendly,* weren’t we?

“Come on, Bloody. Don’t make me do this,” he warned, seeing the hurt expression on my face. In response, I shot my hands up to wrap them around my neck. “I didn’t want to play this card, but you owe me.”

“I certainly don’t,” I responded, still trying to protect my neck. 

He smiled again, hiding some of his upper teeth. He was trying to make it less intimidating than before. “You broke a promise.”

I pursed my lips, raking through my memory to find when exactly I did that. A whine escaped through my lips. “Come on! That didn’t count!” I begged once I remembered. 

“Every promise counts,” he shrugged. “We take promises very seriously.”

I gritted my teeth. “Please,” I tried, although I doubted it would help. 

He closed his eyes and sighed again. 

“I promise that this is just as much for your benefit as it is for mine.”

“I doubt that,” I responded.

I felt tears welling up inside my eyes, so I closed them tightly. 

“Come on. It’l be over before you know,” he promised, and this time there was no mirth in his tone. It sounded as if he was trying to be calming, but come on!

I glanced back for a moment, wondering if Roger was once again too absorbed in thought to notice what was going on in the diner. He did that a lot recently, getting lost in his own thoughts. I guess it was for the best––who knew what he would do otherwise? He was in no condition to go around starting fights.

I forced my body to step around the counter. My teeth were clenched so tightly that my jaw was beginning to hurt, and I begged my body to stop trembling, but to no avail. I didn’t want him to know how scared I was. But I knew that he knew. 

When his icy hand touched mine I flinched. I wanted to maintain some sense of dignity, but that seemed to be against my very nature. 

“Not here,” he said, pulling me toward the jukebox. I was grateful for his leading, because I’m not sure I could’ve done it myself. 

Ever since that first night, I tried really hard not to think about *it*. Not to think of Silas. Not to think of Lucien ripping Silas apart limb by limb. Not to think about the bite. But it was a hard thing to do. Despite myself, every time I see Lucien I remember his relaxed, almost giddy expression, when he was dismembering the other vampire. 

As much as I try to hide it, Lucien is the creature that scares me the most in this town. He is too unpredictable.

He let go of me for a second as he moved the jukebox aside, before taking hold of my hand once more and leading me into the in-between. 

The familiar static tickled my body until a sharp pain gnawed at the top of my head––stronger than the first time. That’s another thing that has changed since I killed that faerie. 

Once we were through, Lucien let go of my hand again. This time, I crossed them over my chest, and waited as every muscle in my body tensed up. 

“I didn’t want to tell you this yet,” Lucien broke the silence, his tone semi-apologetic. “I wanted to make sure first, but you look like you’re about to faint any second now,” he smirked. 

I knew what he was doing, sure, but it was working. I glared at him. 

“I am being very altruistic here,” he winked at me. “I only have good deeds in my mind for taking your blood.” 

I snorted despite myself as the chills went away. 

“Are you even capable of altruism?” I whispered underneath my breath, but I’m sure he heard it with his vampire hearing. 

“You smelled different after you killed that faerie,” he continued, ignoring my words. “But once we got back home, it was gone. You smelled as human as ever.” He took one step toward me, and I tensed up when he sniffed the air around me. “Except for when you come out of here,” he gestured at the in-between. 

“So?” I asked, curiosity taking over some of the fear. 

“Maybe, just maybe,” he emphasized. “If I have your blood in here, I could find out what you are.”

 I gasped, suddenly completely mobile, and I jumped to him, grabbing him by his arms. 

“You could do that?” I was excited then, hoping that maybe my doubts would be resolved right then and there. 

He smiled again. “Maybe. But I’m not making any promises, Bloody. It’s just a theory.”

I nodded, taking a step back, ashamed of my overreaction. I took a deep breath. 

“Just… do it then,” I whispered. 

He nodded, taking my hand in his, and bringing my wrist to his nose. 

I gasped, startled, and I instinctively tried to remove my hand from his grasp. But, somehow, his gentle hold remained steady. 

I shivered as he kept inhaling the scent of my blood.

He was drawing this out, and eventually I began hyperventilating. I was also biting my lip so hard, I was about to draw blood myself––no need for pointy fangs or anything. 

We stood in silence for a few more moments as he kept inhaling. The wait was proving to be just as torturous as the bite. No doubt he was enjoying this. 

Finally, the vampire opened his mouth, and no amount of pressure from my teeth on my lips could stop the scream I let out. 

I felt his lips tickle my arm as he chuckled lowly. 

“I haven’t even touched you yet, Bloody.”

I grit my teeth, glaring at him. 

“Hold still now,” he whispered. He brought his head back to my wrist, as I twisted my head to the side. I shut my eyes tightly and held my breath. 

Lucien slid his tongue over my wrist, and I couldn’t help but murmur “gross” under my breath. He chuckled again, before his teeth sunk into my skin. 

I sucked in a breath, surprised. I could feel the disgusting sensation of fangs incrusting into my tender flesh. But the pain I’d expected was nowhere to be found. I finally turned around to look at Lucien, but the sight of him buried in my wrist brought a wave of nausea that I had to alleviate by turning back around. 

Soon––though much too late––he unhooked his teeth from my veins. 

Swiftly, Lucien whipped out a handkerchief and pressed it against the wound. He could see the inquisitive look in my eyes.

“Vampire venom numbs you skin,” he smirked, smug as ever. 

I didn’t care about that, of course. Although it is true that I was curious. I was staring at him for other reasons. 

“Right––” his smirk fell right off his face. “There was definitely something, but… I didn’t recognize it. I’m sorry, Susan.”

My shoulders deflated at his words. 

“Right, no. I… I get it. You did say maybe.” I bit my lip again, attempting to hide my disappointment.  Every time I think that I’m closer to the answer, I end up right at the beginning. 

Lucien had a strained expression, almost like he was in pain. Without a word, he stepped forward and embraced me without a word. 

“What do you think you’re doing?” I asked, trying to shove him off me. But vampires are much stronger than humans––or whatever it is that I am. 

“Sorry!” He exclaimed as soon as he caught on to what I was trying to do. I just kept staring at him with both of my eyebrows raised. 

He sighed, and then growled. “This must be part of what you are,” he murmured, clenching his fists. Why was he suddenly so angry? “When I saved your life that first time, I had to punish Silas. It was clan politics, nothing more. Boring stuff, I swear. It had nothing to do with you.”

“But something happened after I drank your blood,” his tone softened, and he refused to meet my eyes. His gaze fell sheepishly to the floor. “To be frank, I wasn’t going to leave any witnesses. There are already enough people around that doubt my leadership.”

I froze, and it became hard to breathe once again. How close had I really been to death?

“But as I drank, something… shifted,” his jaw tightened. “A sense of protectiveness took over me. I don’t know how, or why. I only knew that you were to blame. I couldn’t think straight for days,” he let out a bitter laugh. “So I stopped drinking. I spared your life because some outside force made me do it,” then his tone turned furious. “Me! The strongest vampire in centuries!”

My mouth went dry. 

His eyes finally trailed back to my face. Something in my expression made him step back, his shoulders slumped.

“Say something. Please,” He begged in a whisper. 

“I–– What happened after that?” I managed to ask. My mind was still stuck on the fact that I was currently alone with someone who had once planned to kill me.

“I went back to normal after a few days,” he grimaced before the next part. “And I debated finishing you off,” he admitted rather reluctantly. “But I admit that I became curious. Can you really blame me for that? You smelled human. You tasted human. Yet I fell under your spell, when you didn’t even have spells to cast.”

“So what? Is there something wrong with my blood?”

“Sure,” he chuckled, and this time there really was humor there. “There’s something in there that makes me protective of you as long as it’s in my system. There must be something very wrong with you.”

I rolled my eyes. 

“Or maybe you’re the freak after all,” I whispered underneath my breath. But once again vampire senses won.  

“Probably,” now his smile was even wider, and I’m sure I saw some relief in his expression as well.  “Silas didn’t feel any of that, so who knows? It’s not in any of the literature either.”

His teasing tone made me relax again.

“Do you feel protective now?”

He pressed his lips into a thin line before replying. “Yes. I like to believe that it never really went away after the first time. Not completely at least,” he hesitated for a moment, probably pondering wether he wanted to say the next works or not. “ As I’ve been… doing things that curiosity enough can’t explain.”

“Well,” I began, turning around. We’d already wasted so much time. What if a customer had come in? “I’m sure glad my blood is freaky, then.” 

Joking felt like the right thing to do. Safer than dealing with whatever it was that I was feeling at the moment. Instead, I promptly placed the fact that Lucien was really going to kill me into the ‘deal with later’ box. 

“Wait––” Lucien shouted after me. But I didn’t want to hear what he was about to say. I just marched back into the diner and out of the in-between. It’s strange that I never notice how much stronger I feel in there until I go back out. 

That’s when I realized that I should’ve probably listened to Lucien.

Because on the other side stood Roger, with a frantic look in his eyes, and Martha. The waitress from the afternoon shift. 

“I tried to warn you,” the vampire said from behind me. 

I smiled coyly at the woman as Roger sniffed the air and his eyes landed on my still bleeding wrist. 

Roger began growling then, as he stared Lucien down. However, all of the tension in the room died down as soon as he tried to take a step forward and he fell down instead. 

“Roger!” I exclaimed, running to his side. I grabbed him by the arm and I tried to help him back to his feet. 

“What did you do to her?” Roger kept growling from the floor. He had refused my help and was instead trying to hoist himself up with the help of the counter. 

“It’s ok. He didn’t hurt me,” I replied. The last thing Roger needed right now was Lucien being his dickish self. 

“He bit you!”

“He just wanted…” I hesitated, glancing at Martha, but there didn’t seem to be much I could do now to ease her suspicions anyway. She saw me come out of the wall. “He wanted to see what I was.”

Roger relaxed slightly then, collapsing into one of the chairs. 

“And you didn’t think to let me know that you were leaving?” He shouted, clearly mad. 

I got mad then too, despite the fact that my rational mind was telling me that he was just worried about me. I’m not used to being cared about.  

“I assumed you’d heard!” I lied. I knew he hadn’t, and it was definitely a low blow––it wasn’t his fault that he was more distracted than usual. Trauma will do that to a person. But, for some reason, I also didn’t want to tell him how Lucien had made me leave. 

“Oh,” he huffed out, and I offered him a small sympathetic smile. 

Martha cleared her throat. 

I cringed before I turned to her. 

“Does anyone care to tell me what the hell is going on?”

Lucien, ever the problem-solver, offered to kill her if I didn’t want her knowing about me. That’s when I realized that his protectiveness was going to get old really soon. 

Of course I told him no. Instead, we spent a great portion of what remained of my shift telling Martha about me at Roger’s behest. He trusted her––that’s why he called her when he believed that I’d gone missing––so I suppose that I can trust her too. 

It took a while to tell her the whole story, more that it would’ve if she wasn’t interrupting us so frequently. But despite this, I liked her. I could see why Roger liked her too. 

“I knew it!” Martha exclaimed once we were done, punching Roger on the shoulder. “I told you there was *something* about her.” She smiled at me as Roger rolled his eyes. “I can read people’s souls,” she explained to me. 

“Does that mean you know what I am?” I asked, hopefully.

“Well… no,” she said, deflating a little. “I can tell that there was something more that humanity in there, but that’s all,” she shrugged, trying to hide her face behind her shoulders. “It’s just that I’ve never seen anything like this before.”

I nodded, sighing. “It’s ok,” I took her hand into mine. “Nobody seems to have any answers for that.”

She stood there for a moment, before a gleam crossed her eyes. 

“I can’t see what you are,” she said slowly. “But our elder might.” She looked at me as if that was supposed to be something I understood, but she just rolled her eyes when I didn’t. “The elder of the wizard realm is also a soul reader. He’s thousands of years old, and he can read even the most complicated of souls. I’m sure he’d be willing to help.”

Roger perked up at that. “Yes! How didn’t I think of that!”

At the same time, Lucien scoffed. “Absolutely not.”

I ignored both of them. “He could really do that?” I asked Martha. 

“I think so. He’s taught me everything I know, and it’s not even a fraction of what he’s capable of.”

“That doesn’t matter. You’re not going.” Lucien cut in. 

I elbowed the vampire in the ribs. He didn’t budge, though, of course. I ended up hurting my elbow instead. “Stop it. You don’t get a vote.”

“Do I get a vote? Because I vote yes!” Roger raised his hand. 

“Then you do,” I smirked at him, fighting the urge to stick out my tongue at Lucien after he growled. 

“I’m not letting you let that old dirtbag dig into your head,” Lucien scoffed. 

“You’re not *letting me?* Did I hear that right?” I jumped off the chair, shoving my finger in his chest. 

“It could be dangerous!” He snapped back, allowing me the pleasure of budging him.

“He's not going to turn me into a frog!” I said the most ridiculous thing I could think of, which earned me a snicker from Roger. 

“Of course he wouldn’t,” he conceded. 

“Thank you,” I was relieved he’d come to his senses, but that only lasted for a second. 

“He’d go for something way worse,” he smiled like the thought amused him. 

I groaned, and Martha threw a napkin at him. 

“He’d definitely turn *you* into something way worse.” Martha snapped at Lucien. “I’ll even do it myself if you want. She, on the other hand, will be fine and back at the diner in no time.”

“I like the wizard,” Roger shrugged. “He was… able to tell me why I couldn’t transform after… you know.”

I wanted to ask more, but Lucien cut me off. 

“Fine!” He exclaimed. “You can go se the wizard. But you can’t go alone.”

“How arrogant of you to believe that you can dictate what I do or don’t do.”

Lucien flared his nostrils and clenched his fists. 

“Alright!” Martha stepped between us. “Enough! She won’t be alone. I’m going with her,” she told Lucien. “And *you*,” she pointed at me. “Are way too human to be fighting with a vampire like that.”

I didn’t say anything for a while because she was right. I was. But I also knew Lucien couldn’t hurt me right now, so as soon as Martha turned around, I stuck my tongue out at him.

Sure, it was childish, but it worked. 

“I’m coming too.” Was his only reply. 

“No, you’re no––” I couldn’t finish that thought because Martha interrupted me. 

“Fine,” she sighed. 

I decided not to argue. 

So we put a plan in place. Roger apologized for not being able to come with us, but we all understood, of course. Not only that, but his inability to come also provided us with the perfect alibi. 

We called the sheriff to take Roger home while Lucien and I went ahead to the witch realm. Martha would be at the diner in my stead when Linda came back in the morning, and she would tell her that Roger wasn’t feeling well, so I had to walk him home. 

The sheriff seemed content not knowing what was going on. He was just relieved that Roger would be going home early. If there is one good thing that came out of the Halloween disaster, it’s that their relationship has been slowly healing. Just as slowly as his leg, sure. But you could practically see it mending in front of you. I’m just worried that––also like Roger’s leg––it will never be whole again.

Martha practically shoved us toward the in-between while giving us detailed instructions about which door to go through, and where to wait for her. 

The portal led us to a small apothecary that Martha’s family owned. 

The apothecary was small but cozy. Dark reddish-purple wood covered the counters and shelves, which were all filled with different jars and bottles, as well as the window paneling and the door. Some contained colorful liquids, while others held things I chose not to inspect too closely. Other shelves were lined with books, with titles like “*The art of the potion,*” and *“The magic of herbs.”*

In the center of the room sat a round table made of the same purple-colored wood with what I assumed were magical artifacts. 

Behind the counter, a brick fireplace lit the room, providing some warmth to the area. When I glanced back to where we’d come from, I could see that one of the built-in shelves was actually a disguised trapdoor leading to the in-between.

“Welcome to Spellzz, how may I help you today?” A woman greeted us. 

I had to do a double take when I saw her, because for a second I could’ve sworn that that was Martha herself. 

But after a while, I was able to notice some differences in her features. For instance, this woman––Lucia, Martha had told us––had a slightly rounder face, as well as a more pointed nose. Her hair was different too, as Lucia had dark blonde hair while her sister was a brunette. Still, even though they weren’t twins, nobody could deny that they were related. 

Lucia smiled warmly at both of us, waiting for an answer. 

“Oh! Hi! I’m Susan, and this is Lucien. We’re just waiting for Martha,” I explained. “We have some business in town, and she told us to wait for her here.”

“Oh! You’re Martha’s guests? That’s wonderful,” she exclaimed, walking behind the counter. “Let me get you some tea. It’s dreadfully cold out there.”

The air around Lucien shifted, and I could tell that he was about to do something I would recriminate later. 

“Don’t be rude,” I whispered as I approached the counter. 

“Here you go,” Lucia finished pouring three cups of tea and slid one toward me across the counter. 

“Thank you,” I smiled, accepting the cup gracefully. 

Lucien, on the other hand, was eying the cup suspiciously. Doesn’t he ever get tired of being suspicious of everything? 

Before I could really think about it, he snatched the cup out of my hand just as I was about to take a sip. 

“Hey!” I narrowed my eyes at him as he took a sip out of *my* cup. 

“It’s nice,” he smiled meekly when he realized what he’d done. 

I threw him one of my dirtiest looks before I took his cup instead. “Idiot,” I whispered low enough that only he would hear me. 

I suddenly remembered that we weren’t alone, and I turned to look at Lucia’s face. She was looking at us with a bemused expression on her face. 

“So, what is this business that you have in town?” She asked, trying to make small talk.

“It’s none of your business,” Lucien snapped. So much for not being rude.  

Lucia tensed up, and even I had to contain the urge to step away from the vampire. His tone was cold and merciless, and it left no room for discussion.

Her smile faltered for a second before she forced it back into place. “Right. Sorry, I didn’t meant to pry,” she said, shifting nervously on her feet. 

None of us said anything after that. We just stood there in an uncomfortable silence. Thankfully, it didn’t last too long, as the wooden shelf we’d come through creaked open, and Martha walked out of it. 

Lucia refused to tell her why the room felt so tense, but she guesses soon enough. She didn’t comment on it though. She simply grabbed her coat, told Lucia that she’d be back later, and led us outside. 

She took us through cobbled streets and snow all the way to the wizard’s tower while shooting daggers at Lucien. 

I admit that I was expecting kind of a medieval-esque thing, which the exterior of the tower corroborated. But, instead, the inside was quite modern, and it even had an elevator.

Once we were on the top floor, Martha took us down a stone corridor that was more similar to what I had been expecting, and she knocked on a large green wooden door. 

We waited for a few seconds until a soft “enter” was heard from the other side. 

Martha went in first, and she gestured us to stay outside. She left the door ajar, and I could hear through the crack that she was explaining the situation to the wizard. 

I was scared. And tired. And most of all, I was tired of feeling scared. Luckily, this time the fear came from the very real possibility that I could find out what I am. Because, right then, a horrible realization hit me. 

What if the reason nobody knew what I am. Is because I’m the abomination my parents always said I was? I’ve had time to think about it for a while, and I’ve taken to heart some of your comments. I ultimately came to the conclusion that they would know best, after all. Even if they’ve been hiding all of this from me my whole life. Because there’s no way at all that they didn’t know about me. 

Lucien and I waited outside for a few minutes while I tried to make out what the wizard and Martha were saying, but that went far beyond my human capabilities. I was tempted to ask Lucien what he could hear. I’m sure he would’ve loved that.  

Just then, the mumbling turned into footsteps. A moment later, the wizard himself opened the door fully.

“Ah. So this is the girl you were telling me about,” the wizard murmured, eying me curiously. “Yes. I see. There is definitely something in there.” 

He reached out to take my hand, but Lucien stepped between us. 

The old man’s gaze snapped to Lucien’s, irritations flickering in them. “Martha, dear,” he said, his voice straining to feign pleasantness, “why don’t you take the lady’s friend for a walk so that she and I can have a discussion.”

Lucien growled under his breath, but he regained his composure when I brought my foot down on his. Hard. Sure, my own foot probably hurt more than his, but I’d made my point. 

“Come on, leech. Let’s take a walk,” Martha said, grabbing him by him sleeve. 

I could see the struggle behind his gaze, but he conceded. “Fine, but I’ll be close. Remember that,” he pointed his finger to the wizard before he turned around and followed Martha out. 

The moment Lucien was out of sight, the wizard shut the door and sighed in relief. All tension left his features as he smiled at me like a nice grandfather. 

“Much better,” he murmured, giving me an almost apologetic shrug. “I can’t stand these younger vampires. No manners, no patience.” he shook his head. “Take a seat now, my dear,”

He gestured toward a low chair beside a cluttered table. 

Before sitting opposite me, he took a porcelain teacup from the table and placed it in front of me.

“Tea?” he asked, though it wasn’t really a question, because he was already pouring by the time the word left his mouth.

“Thank you,” I said. In all honesty, I did’t really want any tea. But I also didn’t want to be rude. 

“Now then,” he began. “Martha tells me that you’re something of an enigma.”

I laughed a bit. “That’s one way to put it.”

He chuckled along with me. “And I can see why,” he placed his hand slowly on mine. “You’re quite the fascinating case. I haven’t felt an aura like yours in… let’s just say a long time.”

“So you know what I am?” I asked, feeling like a broken record. How many times had I already asked this that day only for my illusions to be shattered?

He chuckled again. “Don’t fret, dear. We’ll get to there eventually. For now, just drink,” he gestured toward my cup. 

I took a sip. “Are you going to read my tea leaves or something?”

“Or something,” he said. 

I downed the whole thing in one gulp and smiled at him. 

We spoke for another minute or so while he asked harmless questions: how long I’d lived in town, whether I enjoyed working at the diner, how I’d met Martha. Normal small talk.

Then he lifted the teapot again.

“Here, have a bit more,” he said, reaching to refill my cup.

“Oh no, thank you,” I replied quickly, my hand already covering the rim. “I’m good.”

He paused for a moment. “Nonsense,” he insisted gently. “You barely drank any. Go on.”

I obliged in the end, no sense in refusing I supposed. 

We talked a bit more as he nudged me to take sip after sip. He asked me about my childhood, my family, my earliest memories. He was trying to put together the puzzle of me. He nodded often, and sometimes he took my hand into his and concentrated for a few minutes. 

But despite his kindness, I could tell that he was becoming impatient. From time to time he glanced at his watch. 

A while after I finished my second cup of tea, he grabbed the teapot again, and made a move to pour me another.

I stopped him with a quick hand over the rim. “Oh, no. That’s alright. Thank you.”

His smile froze. “You should drink.”

“I’m fine,” I insisted, forcing a polite little laugh. “Really.”

His nostrils flared for a second––the only expression of anger––and then he set the teapot forcefully on the table. A calm smile spread over his face. “Well alright. It’s not like it was working anyway,” he muttered as ha began pacing around the room. 

Then, without warning, he snatched the cup in front of me and smashed it against the floor. I shot to my feet, heart pounding.

“You, my dear,” he huffed. “Are not as human as I’d hoped.” This time, his smile turned malicious. “After all, the sedative should’ve knocked you unconscious after the first cup.”

My bad luck had struck again. I forced myself to speak. 

“Well,” I cleared my throat as a nervous laugh escaped me. “This was great. Thank you so much for your time, but I’m afraid I have to leave now.” I knew it wouldn’t work, but I had to try. 

“You’re not leaving.” With a flick of his wrist, the bolt on the door closed. 

He lifted the other hand and my feet left the floor. With another flick of his wrist, he sent me flying toward the wall, and all air left my lungs when my back hit it forcefully. 

“I’d hoped that you would simply fall asleep. It’s always so much easier when they’re unconscious.” He tilted his head, studying me like an insect pinned to a board. “But no. You had to be complicated.”

“Let me go!” I screamed. 

Fine. I admit it. I should’ve…

Ugh! I should’ve listened to Lucien. 

(Please don’t tell him I said that! I will never hear the end of it.)

The wizard sighed. “My dear, believe me when I say this: I never wanted to hurt anyone. But this has to be done,” he said, his tone almost apologetic.

I remember thinking, in that moment, that I wasn’t surprised people trusted him so easily. He had the kind of charisma that made you want to believe him. The kind that made his words sound reasonable.

It almost made me feel sorry for him even though I was the one he was trying to hurt. 

“But I can’t allow you to bring them back,” he continued softly. “Your… family is perfectly fine where they are.”

“I don’t understand what you’re saying!” I screamed, thrashing around. 

“That’s not something I’m permitted to explain,” he said at last. He looked at me with sympathy. “Only that your existence is a risk. One we cannot afford.”

An invisible force closed around my throat like ghostly hands as I still thrashed across the wall. My hands clawed uselessly at nothing. I tried to fill my lungs with air, but the pressure was too great. 

“I really am sorry child,” he turned around so he wouldn’t have to look at me. “Your existence is a risk to us all.”

Spots bloomed across my vision. My lungs burned with lack of oxygen and I still couldn’t scream. I knew then that I was going to die. 

Suddenly, the room became a mess of wood and glass as something broke into the room by shattering the door and everything between it and the wizard. 

The ghostly pressure around my throat vanished, and I collapsed hard onto my knees. I barely felt the impact. All I felt was relief as oxygen rushed back into my lungs.

I managed to look up after coughing for a few seconds, and the *something* was actually a someone. Lucien, of course. 

He had the wizard by the throat, lifting him off the ground, his expression twisted with the same bloodthirst I’d seen the night he tore Silas apart. I knew exactly what he was about to do.

“Stop,” I croaked. My voice was barely there, and I was terrified he wouldn’t hear me. My throat felt shredded. “He knows what I am.”

But he heard me because his grip on his throat instantly loosened. 

He seized the wizard by his collar and slammed him into the floor with enough force to crack the tiles beneath him. 

“Speak,” Lucien snarled. 

The wizard opened his moth but nothing came out. 

The vampire grabbed him again and slammed his body against the floor again. “SPEAK!” 

“I can’t,” he admitted. “I swore an oath. I’ll die the second I even think about breaking it.”

Lucien pursed his lips before the bloodthirsty smile came back. “I can just kill you then.”

“No, stop!” Martha barged in. Tears streaked her face as she rushed forward, putting herself between them. I could feel the betrayal in her eyes. 

“Martha,” the wizard exhaled in relief. 

“I don’t think I will,” he snarled, ignoring the man. “And while I kill him slowly, you’d better start thinking of a reason for me not to kill you as well.” 

“You can’t,” Martha said, her voice shaky. “This will start a war. And you know it. The balance between Eternal Night and this realm is very fragile.”

“I don’t care about wars,” he said quietly. “I don’t care about treaties. Or realms. Or what happens to your precious balance when I’m done here.” His words were so sharp that they could cut through glass. “There is only one thing I care about right now.”

He didn’t have to say it because I knew what he meant. This… wrongness in my blood could start a war. 

Martha swallowed hard. “I know,” she said softly.

“Please. You can’t do this. Not for me. I’m not worth it.” I tried to change their minds, but they just ignored me. 

“And I know something else,” she continued, forcing herself to meet his gaze. “If you let him live, he will try to kill her again. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But he will. He believes it’s his duty.”

I tried to protest again, but my throat was too raw from before. Nothing came out. 

“But my family knows about duty too,” she went on, hesitating as she glanced at me. “And my sister saw that she needs to be protected no matter the cost.”

“Words mean nothing to me, witch,” Lucien growled. “Your sister may be a powerful seer, but so what?”

“I know he can’t live. But he can’t die by your hands.” Her voice broke as she forced out the next words. “So he must die by mine. My sister saw it happening, and so it must be.”

“No!” I tried to protest. 

Lucien scoffed. “And you expect me to believe you’ll finish what needs to be done?”

“I will,” Martha said.

“That’s not an good enough,” Lucien snapped. “You stood by him for years. You learned from him. So tell me, witch, how do your loyalties shift so easily? From your mentor to a girl you barely know?”

Martha’s flared her nostrils, clearly offended. “My number one loyalty has always been to my sister and her visions. The wizard is number two,” she looked at him with contempt. “Was number two.”

“Martha,” the wizard rasped from the floor. “You don’t mean that!”

“I do,” she snapped, and if she were a different person I could’ve pictured her spitting on him. “Her identity is protected even from my sister. Whoever did that was definitely very powerful. But not her destiny. She needs to be protected and that’s exactly what I’m going to do.” 

“You wretched girl! I saved you from nothingness, and this is how you’re repaying me?” The wizard rose to his feet and launched at the witch. 

Just in the nick of time, Lucien knocked him out with a blow to his head.

“Thank you,” Martha said. 

Lucien nodded, and I could see the beginning of camaraderie forming between them.

“Then do it,” he said in a low voice. He was testing her. “Kill him.”

“No!” This time I managed to speak, and I was finally able to stand on my weak legs. Lucien didn’t let me move, though. Or at least he didn’t let me fall, since my legs felt like jelly instead of meat and bone. He caught me before I met the ground. “No, please. You don’t have to kill him.”

“We do, love,” Lucien whispered to me meeting my eyes. “He’ll kill you if we let him live.”

“That doesn’t matter! My life isn’t worth his. Please don’t make me the reason he dies,” I begged. 

“We aren’t,” Martha intervened gently. “He’ll kill us too if we let him live. Not only that but he’ll get our families and friends killed. And if he doesn’t do it himself, the other people involved in the oath will.”

Roger’s eyes, cold and lifeless crossed my mind and I shuddered against Lucien’s chest. 

I didn’t want to give my approval to the murder, but I nodded my head nonetheless.

Martha took a deep breath. “The enforcers will sense your presences and they’ll start asking questions. The death of the Great Wizard will not go unpunished, and they don’t care about treaties or thrones. Not even your bloodline will protect you,” she said. “Go home and don’t come back for a while. I’ll cover your trail.” 

Surprisingly, Lucien nodded. 

“What about you?” I asked. 

“I know how to hide my tracks,” she shook her head. “I had a good teacher,” she stared at the wizard. “They will deem it a death of natural causes.”

Lucien’s grip on my body tightened, and I knew what that meant. I knew that he wanted to be the one to kill the wizard. But thankfully, the reasonable part of his mind won. 

“Fine,” he said through gritted teeth.

Then he turned to me, stepping between me and the wizard’s crumpled form, which I hadn’t realized I was still staring at. “We have to go now, bloody. Can you walk on your own?”

I only managed to shake my head.

Thankfully, he didn’t comment. He simply slipped an arm around me and guided me toward the door. I tried to keep up on my own two legs, but the tea was finally taking effect. My knees buckled, the floor seemed to tilt beneath me, and the world slipped away.

Darkness swallowed me whole.

Once I woke up at home I couldn’t stop thinking about the wizard. I had gone to him looking for answers, but instead found only more questions. 

*Am I really that dangerous?*  I wondered. After all, somebody was willing to kill me for what I am. 

As for my fainting episode, for the first time ever, I was grateful for not being completely human. According to the sheriff, that was the only reason the tea hadn’t caused any permanent damage. I won’t be sharing the specifics of it, though. Apparently, the tea is made with plant found in this realm, and I can’t risk having anyone trying to recreate its effects. 

Still, there was one thing the wizard said that I found hard to let go of. He’d mentioned my family. And, even though I was pretty sure he wasn’t referring to my parents that still left one avenue I was hesitant to consider open. 

My parents are bound to know something about what I am. They just must. Nobody holds such hatred for a child without a reason. Do they?

Laying there in bed, looking up at the ceiling as I was recovering from the tea, I realized that I had to go back home. 

But this time, I wasn’t going to be the scared little girl that left.
