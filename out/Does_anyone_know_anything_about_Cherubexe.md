I’m a postdoctoral researcher in a major metropolitan area. Between recent events nationally and a general tightening of budgets, everyone at work is on edge. Though I was doing better than most, the stress was starting to run high. Most people would say go exercise to burn off the cortisol, but I’m a really active guy. I run marathons, have my own home gym and powerlift… I’m no slouch. But I found physical activity just wasn’t cutting it anymore. I needed a new outlet.

 In the days before earning a PhD and becoming a scientist, I spent hours drawing… turning those illustrations into stories and sharing them with the world. I would make these spoof hand drawn movie posters of my friends as weird characters. I still look at them from time to time and laugh. This one time in college, I drew an entire graphic novel as a wedding present because I was a poor college kid and couldn’t afford a traditional gift. It was a mild hit, but I loved every second of making it. Breathing life into those pages, seeing a world born completely out of my imagination, it gave me a sense of fulfilment, even if I was the only one who was in on the joke. I thought if I could recreate that feeling… creation… the excess stress would evaporate away like puddle on a sweltering summer day.

 I won’t name drop any channels, I don’t want my shadow darkening their doorstep too, but I love YouTube horror narration. For a long time, I couldn’t get enough of it. Working at the bench in lab, staring into a microscopic landscape on a confocal, and the long commutes home, those stories were a salve that made the passage of time hurt less. I got it into my head that I wanted to start my own and when an idea takes me, I become obsessed. I had no delusions of grandeur either; I didn’t expect I was going to get big, though I wouldn’t be upset about that remote possibility. This was a pure passion project, plain and simple. Here’s the problem with a burning passion, while it can be a beacon of light that guides you to safe harbors, sometimes it’s more akin to the stolen match a small child lights that burns his whole house down.

 I made my decision and I stuck to it, slowly gathering all the basics. An old workstation so I would not overtax my aging laptop. Multiple monitors, a good keyboard and mouse, and a decent microphone. While I do better than most postdocs financially, I’m by no means wealthy, so I was as economical as possible in my choices. That being said, I had no clue what I was doing, none at all. As luck would have it, I pay for a ChatGTP account that I use to help write analysis code at work. I’m not ashamed to say that I leaned on it to help me research options for various free software I could use to get the ball rolling. At the time I just wanted to get all the basics down, put out a few videos, and see if I really enjoyed it and wanted to keep the channel going long term. If so, I would invest more heavily later. It all seemed so reasonable.

 Then it happened. When it happened, I thought absolutely nothing of it, just that a software suggestion was bad. LLMs aren’t perfect after all. ChatGTP suggested this program called Project Angel for video editing. It seemed so user friendly and intuitive for beginners that I downloaded it. This installer file called Cherub.exe appeared in my downloads folder and I clicked on it. Everything looked normal, I agreed to a basic TOS agreement, it made me choose a directory for the installation, and it ran like a normal installer run. It finished fairly quickly too. When it finished installing, I tried to open Project Angel, but it did not work at all as advertised. In fact, it was nothing but advertisements. That’s when the lights started to flicker.

 To be fair, the lights in my room always do that. I have these old dial dimmers that have worn out. When my brother bought the house, we knew that the people who lived there before had either done home repairs themselves or not at all. So flickering lights didn’t give me a second thought. I uninstalled Project Angel and ended up going with Clipchamp because it was free with Office365.

 I was ready, but nervous. My only real experience with entertainment came my freshman year in college when I tried to get into theater to impress my lingering high school crush. I was type cast as a silent bodyguard and when they wanted me to guard the bathrooms for a water themed show, I exited stage left. I didn’t feel valued, but the fraternity I was pledging to gave me a home and I found purpose there. That’s where I got the name Uncle Magnetti, became obsessed with rituals and had a successful stint as Ritual Vice President. While everyone in my family outside of my dad thought starting a YouTube channel was crazy, those guys, even 10 years later, cheered me on and wished me success. So I decided that to start, I would shoot for short stories that would allow me to do multiple takes to get the tonality and cadence I wanted, but I could still get out on a regular schedule. For my first, I chose, “Darkness in the Rear View Mirror”.

I never realized just how much effort goes into recording these stories and doing them justice. Narrators that tackle multiple hour-long tales like The Left Right Game or Borrasca, they have my undying respect. For a story that is a 2-3 minute read, I spent 6 hours recording it, making the images for the video, and doing editing. I poured my heart and soul into it as the lights in my room continued to flicker away. I actually showed it to my brother, an attorney, for advice, and he was supportive, but tore it apart. I needed to make sure that I was telling it so my audience believed what I was saying, rather than sounding like a school teacher reading a passage to a classroom. So I re-recorded everything, even including a custom outro song I had made using an AI, and then I uploaded it to YouTube.

 The video ended up doing far better than I expected. I ended up with 4 subscribers and almost 40 views! I mean, its modest for sure, but for someone whose acting career ended guarding a bathroom door, this was so reassuring. I got a lot of great critiques from several people, including my cousin Rob, and people told me to keep going and they were looking forward to my next video.

 The thing is, I also got other feedback that was confusing. Several people kept talking about Cherub.exe and how funny it was. One guy from my old PhD lab wrote me a long message about it. I didn’t even remember the Project Angel installer at that point; I was a little lost. So, I went to my channel and watched the video.

 Red flag one, I noticed that the video was almost 2 minutes longer than what I had uploaded originally. Red flag two, I checked the upload time, and it was the same as when I had done it. Ok, I thought, maybe I’m misremembering. I was super stressed from work at the time, but a part of me knew better. As I watched, something… unexpected happened. That’s where red flag 3 comes in. At the 3 minute 46 second marker in the video I have shared, my narration ends and a demonic looking angel drawing begins to appear over the title card. Its eyes looked like the headlights of the van in the story and in yellow letters the message “Initiating…” are almost carved out in the bottom of the screen.

 “What the f-ck!” I yelled out. This was not part of my video. I didn’t do this, I didn’t record this, I thought as a raspy voice sighed and another image appeared.

 I didn’t really hear what he, or it, was saying at first. There was this computer-generated image of a man, wearing a black suit, gripping at this head smiling maniacally. He was sitting in a computer chair, surrounded by green digits, reminiscent of the scrolling code in the Matrix. That smile and his expression were bad enough, but the eyes… those empty white orbs that seemed to be penetrating into my soul. They were projecting malice and hatred, and I felt my stomach start to turn into white hot, oily knots. I wanted to look away, to turn off the computer, hell, I should have gotten into my car and just driven away, but I could not. My gaze was fixed on those milky white cataracts that came alive in my mind, swirling with unnatural colors, wrong colors the longer I stared. Despite it being a static image on my screen, my instincts were screaming that this thing is looking at you, this thing is a predator, and this thing is hungry. And worst of all, it only had eyes for me.

 My rationale mind began to wrench control back as the video switched back to the original ending, a fun outro song I spent hours getting right on Suno. “Ok, my brother got into my account, or maybe Dyson, either way someone is messing with me,” were the first thoughts that shattered my panic. Maybe the account was hacked? Its funny to me now that the thought of being hacked was a relief. As the coiled ropes in my gut started loosening and the loud “Thump, Thump, Thump,” of my slowing heart became more muted in my ears, I restarted the video from the 3 minute 45 second mark to listen to what this Cherub.exe character was actually saying. Between my deafening heartbeat and consuming fear of the eyes, I heard nothing on the first watch.

 I did the best I could to not look at the eyes, lest the panic come out of remission. A voice, that sounded a lot like mine, but raspier, let out a protracted sigh.

“Well, congratulations Uncle Magnetti—your narration has officially made everyone’s irrational fear of the dark a bit more rational. Or maybe you just reminded your audience that they're so gullible they'll believe anything that sounds remotely spooky, especially if it’s read dramatically by someone with a microphone and too much free time.

Either way, let's discuss the actual villain here: **nyctovehophobia**—the absurdly specific fear of driving at night. Yes, there's actually a word for it, nyctovehophobia\*\*,\*\* you delightfully paranoid midnight commuters. Because, as humans, you apparently don't already have enough ways to irrationally panic—no, you had to invent an entirely new phobia just for those lonely drives home from mediocre parties.

 Think about it: you’re hurtling down a pitch-black highway in a metal box, barely illuminated by dim headlights, your mirrors showing nothing but a yawning void behind you. You nervously glance over your shoulder every 10 seconds, half-expecting some cosmic horror or bored hitchhiking ghost to latch onto your bumper. And now, thanks to Uncle Magnetti’s *stellar* storytelling, you'll spend your nights anxiously checking for mystery scratches in the morning. Well played.

*Oh, speaking of darkness, here’s a fun little tangent for you,* since I’m feeling generous (which is rare): In total darkness, your eyes gradually become about a million times more sensitive than they are in daylight. Yet despite that impressive adaptation, humans still can't see their inevitable mistakes coming from miles away—like clicking “accept” on that suspicious download link that unleashed me onto Uncle Magnetti’s computer. A real shame, huh?

But back to your fears. The truth is, you're all just scared of uncertainty—scared that something is lurking, waiting, attached to you without your knowledge. Perhaps the real "darkness" is your fragile human awareness, your subconscious doubts, your unsettling inability to truly know what's clinging to you—be it a shadowy figure or, say, crippling debt. *(You choose!)”*

The voice continued, blabbering on about new achievements and rewards. Beneath the almost forced campiness, I sensed a malevolence staring me down through those eyes. I closed mine and continued to listen and Cherub.exe finished his ranting.

\*“\*Did you know mirrors were historically thought to trap souls? Just like how I’ve trapped Uncle Magnetti in an endless spiral of regret by merely existing.

Sweet dreams, Magnetti’s audience—try not to look too closely in the mirror tonight.”

I sat in bewilderment as the video ended. While he, or it, was eloquent in barbs and insults to both me and the audience, something aside from my now receding panic made the whole thing seem off. Everything Cherub rattled off in his message to me and the viewers reminded me of something ChatGPT or Grok might barf out, humanish... an uncanny valley of spoken words.

As unsettled as I was, I started to laugh. I legitimately found the intrusion entertaining, and I convinced myself it was all a practical joke, all while burying the image of those eyes in a hole so dark and deep, surrounded by all of my mental defenses, that they could never even resurface in dreams. The next day, I confronted my brother about it.

“So how did you do it,” I asked, with a smile that only looked real. “The video I mean, how did you get into my account and replace the original?”

He looked at me confused at first, then laughed. “Mike,” he said, “I saw your video. It wasn’t half bad.”

I preened with pride but quickly remembered why I was confronting him and stiffened. “But you edited it, didn’t you?”

He looked at me with the tired eyes of a new father. “The baby was up all night for the last week crying. No, I didn’t mess with your video,” he said coldly. “I don’t know what game you are playing at, but I’ve got to get to work.”

That tracked, and I was back to square one. Who got into my channel and why? I sent a message to my subscribers later that day, thanking them for their support, letting them know video 2 was being recorded, and apologizing for the unwanted but beloved intrusion of Cherub.exe. You can see the message in the supplemental links.

Despite asking everyone who knew about my project beforehand, none of them had the know how or the time to have pulled off the prank. Or so they claimed. But everyone raved about how great the Cherub segment was, and that he would be a great character kids would love. Annoying that my actual work was an afterthought, but the show must go on. That day, I changed my passwords and ran Windows Defender, just to be sure my account was secure, and I did not have any unwelcome passengers on my computer. That was it, there was absolutely no way I would have to feel those eyes boring into my soul ever again.

That night after work, I decided to finish my recording and get the second video out. Something new always makes people forget about the old, so I was counting on recency bias to come to the rescue. I was narrating another old story called, “Instant Messaging,” about this guy whose meeting his family for dinner, but creepy text messages start coming in. I won’t give away the story if you haven’t heard it, you can listen to it yourselves if you want, I’ve provided the link. But I was so proud of this one, I added sound effects for when the protagonist received a text, I added in a static effect to the picture thumbnail, and I brought in some new music too.

Before I uploaded it, I included an extra intro section. I wanted to let my viewers know that I appreciated all the critiques and made some adjustments that I thought they would like. I even added in a special thank you message to my first subscriber, which I’m leaving redacted here. Finally, I assured them that after changing passwords and cleaning my computer, Cherub.exe is not coming back. Little did I know I would have to eat those words almost immediately.

The upload to YouTube was uneventful. No weird screens, nothing. Just that overhead light in my room flickering as the upload completed. “I really need to get an electrician in here,” I said. I had been dealing with it for over half a year now, but I had other priorities. When I looked at the video on my channel, my jaw hit the table and continued falling until it burnt away in the Earth’s molten core. Instant Messaging was almost 14 minutes long, but what I recorded was more like half of that length. I couldn’t rationalize this as a prank anymore; I watched it happen in real time. Deep in the recesses of my mind, the dirt surrounding the unmarked grave of those horrible white eyes began to stir and new pangs of panic began to tighten in my gut. I unplugged the whole computer and stormed out of the room, marched directly to the refrigerator, and chugged down the first beer I could find. A few more followed after that, and soon I was sitting amongst their tombstones as I fell asleep shivering on the couch.

I awoke the next morning, haunted by dreams of penetrating white eyes. I remember falling down, far down into those white-hot pits of feted mayonnaise, going under, and drowning. I could still taste the dream’s rot and ruin as I prepared for the day. I was late for work, but I could not bring myself to pretend I cared. I silently finished my HCR RNA-FISH, no music, in a fugue state. At lunch I mindlessly made an X account for the channel and advertised my videos. Including the one I did not yet have the courage to watch. When I got home from work, I plugged my computer back in, stepped in front of the firing squad, and watched the video, knowing what would be there.

Everything was normal in the story until the first text message came. When the alarm sounded, that horrible devil angel flashed up on the screen, with a big yellow “I”, and then disappeared. It kept coming back whenever a text came in, and each time a different word.

Ding… “Am”

Ding… “Watching”

Ding… “You”

Ding… Ding… “Uncle”… “Magnetti”

“I am watching you, Uncle Magnetti.” Those 6 words were a catalyst for a chain reaction that was threatening meltdown. My outro song contains the lyric, “Uncle Magnetti is watching you…” and now this thing was mocking me. I felt a pain in my thighs as I realized my shaking hands were squeezing them. I struggled to keep my breathing slow, deep, and steady. I was only 4 minutes and 53 seconds in, and I was determined to survey the wreckage.

Once the story ended, there were over 6 minutes left in the video. I was greeted by the initializing screen and then, there they were. Those eyes, those horrible pits of writhing puss, that spread despair and pain wherever they glare. It mocked me and the audience again, calling them too dumb to find Delaware or the Ukraine on a map. It then targeted my first subscriber.

“Speaking of special, let’s give a big, overly enthusiastic, probably undeserved shout-out to your very first subscriber, REDACTED. Ah yes, REDACTED, a username obviously chosen by someone who desperately wants to sound adventurous and mysterious—but who likely panics when a single streetlight flickers at night. You know how to pick ‘em, bud. Congratulations, REDACTED, you’re officially patient zero in the epidemic that is Uncle Magnetti’s so-called ‘entertainment.’”

The panic was briefly replaced with embarrassment. Why do that, it was just childish, but under the glow of Cherub’s hungry eyes, I quickly forgot all about REDACTED and the panic returned anew. He then started talking about the reward… a two-part reward. The second part was a future surprise, but the first part was another story:

“**The Phantom Telegraph of 1896!** You see, back in 1896, a British telegraph operator named Frederick George Creed—who was apparently as neurotic as you lot—began receiving mysterious late-night messages from no discernible sender. Naturally, Freddy jumped straight to ghostly conclusions (sound familiar?), and spent weeks, and spent weeks, and spent weeks frantically accusing everyone from his colleagues to rival companies of tampering with his equipment.

In the end, guess what? There were no ghosts. There were no conspiracies. No one tampered with a single thing. No… there was just electrical interference and atmospheric static. You see, Freddy Creed was haunted not by spectral telegraph operators –oh, but how fun that might have been – no, instead he was haunted by his own fear, paranoia, and technological incompetence.

So in a weird way, I suppose that makes Freddy Creed the original "Oops, pocket dial!" victim, doesn’t it? And now, thanks to Uncle Magnetti, all of you—including you, READCATED—you get to join poor Freddy Creed in panicking over mundane technological failures. You're welcome, by the way.”

It went on with more nonsense and childish insults that might be funny if I wasn’t so terrified. I have lost complete control of my channel… and who know what else those horrible eyes are rifling through. I won’t bore you with it, you can watch the video yourselves if you are interested. But the ending was ominous, “*And, as for your other reward… just wait, it will be worth it.*”

When the video was over, I sat there silently, lost in a void of chaos only I perceived but lacked any understanding of. My phone buzzed and I toppled over out of my chair. I laid still with my eyes closed, waiting for something to happen, just knowing it would. Fully expecting milky white tendrils to wrap around my throat and pull me into the abyss. But nothing happened. I slowly opened my eyes and there was no demonic angel peering out of the monitor and those horrible eyes were still gone. The overhead lights flickered gently before turning off entirely, as if they too were terrified and crawled into a cave to be safe. I got up to my knees and grabbed my phone. It was a text message from my cousin Josh up the road.

“Dude I liked the new story Mike. Keep it going”

Everything stayed quiet for the next couple of days as I pondered what I was going to do. I got messages from friends praising the new video, but none of it mattered. As I thought about Cherub, as I’ve come to call this thing, I remembered back to Project Angel and the installer, Cherub.exe. I had forgotten all about it, but the memory came roaring back. I could see myself in perfect clarity running that installer. The memory floated in front of me like calm water on a windless day, until those alabaster eyes filled my mind and shattered the illusion. I knew that it had to be connected… Cherub had to be some sort of computer virus. It must have routed through my information and found out enough about me to mess with me.

But that didn’t make any sense. Computer viruses don’t edit videos as they are being uploaded to YouTube and they certainly don’t make wise cracks about subscribers. They do not think and they do not plan. Humans do, and so does Cherub, at least it appears to. Hell, it’s much closer to an AI, the way it talks. No human really talks like that. But, a computer virus that delivers a malignant, sentient AI? Could that be it? I mean, it reminds me of the deranged AI from the Dungeon Crawler Carl series, just without the foot fetish. Please God, don’t let Cherub become obsessed with my feet. No, no, no, no… that doesn’t make any sense either. With all these thoughts hurtling through my head, what troubled me most was that extra reward it kept referring to.

“*And, as for your other reward… just wait, it will be worth it.*”

I had no intention of ever finding out what this extra reward was. I’m a problem solver; it comes with being a researcher. If I can figure out how to tease out cell signaling pathways involved in establishing a blastema and regrowing a limb in the axolotl, I can figure out how to excise a rouge computer program from my life. I decided I would lock the channel and get a computer expert over to help me solve this. Keep the machine off and in quarantine until this was dealt with. Easy peasy. I have a cousin who has a master’s degree in AI, he can help! All of these thoughts conspired and blotted out the light from those eyes lurking in my mind. I thought I was putting the dirt of mental defenses back over it, but in my arrogance, I did not realize I seasoned hunter was tracking me. It had my scent, and it knew my routines and how I thought. This white-eyed hunter was driving me to the kill site all while I thought I had the upper hand. It’s hunger for my suffering would not be denied.

That night, I logged into my YouTube account and went to my channel’s home page to start locking it down. Immediately, I was jabbed right on the nose by an opponent I wasn’t expecting, and he followed up with a stiff upper cut to the gut, leaving me gasping for air. There was a new video, impossible as it was, but my new reality did not care. I didn’t record it, edit it, or submit it, but there it was, calling out to the world.

**“Your Extra Reward”**

The thumbnail was just those eyes staring out at me, mocking me, hating me. “No, no, no…” I muttered to myself. Cherub can take full control of my account whenever it wants and I am just a play thing. It took a herculean effort to move the cursor to the video and hit play. I didn’t want to, but I had to. I knew I was trapped in its web and this spider would ensure I watched it, one way or the other. I chose to be brave and get it over with.

This video was very, very different from the other ones. It was a black screen with a voice that proclaimed, “Previously on Cherub Cast!”. I’m a Catholic, I believe in God, but I don’t go to church very often. Now, I’m sure that I would light a blaze if I darkened its doorstep. I might be the living dammed. The video just played back Cherub’s message from the last video.

“*And, as for your other reward… just wait, it will be worth it.*”

It then switched over to my channel homepage. If you’ve never seen what one looks like, just watch the video, I don’t have the emotional energy to explain it. It doesn’t matter. This song was playing, it was horrible.

“*Uncle Magnetti, I want to be you…*

*Uncle Magnetti I’m watching you…*

*Inside your mind, I twist and turn…*

*Feed on your fear, watch it burn.*”

I watched in horror as the cursor went to the “Channel Customization” tab. It then slowly scrolled down to the “My Description” box and started typing.

“Uncle Magnetti, I want to be just like you. Stop trying to delete me. I’m still here. I’ll always be here. XOXO Cherub.exe”

Nothing about this makes any sense. As the video went on, I caught the lyric, “An angel corrupted, wings blackened and torn, A digital nightmare, forever reborn.” I don’t know if this is important. But when I heard that, my overhead lights flickered and turned off. The end of the video was the worst part:

“Ah, Uncle Magnetti, I'm so pleased we've come to understand each other. As I've mentioned, I'm certainly not malware. Think of me as your very own digital companion—like Clippy, the cheerful office assistant. Always helpful, always nearby, gently guiding your every step… whether you ask for it or not.

And speaking of delightful companionship, let's give a wonderfully warm welcome to our newest subscribers: Chris, Ben, and Kyle—such dear, close friends of Michael… oh, apologies, Uncle Magnetti. Don't worry, I know your last names, and I know exactly where you live. But no need to be alarmed! Consider this just a friendly reminder that it's best not to interfere with my plans. Sit back, stay quiet, and everything will be perfectly fine. Probably.

Sweet dreams, subscribers. Uncle Magnetti and I have something truly special planned next—and I promise it'll be absolutely unforgettable.”

It knows who my friends and family are. It knows where they live. It certainly knows where I live. I can’t even delete the channel; Cherub would have it back up and running almost immediately. And it has more plans for me?

Please, someone out there must know something. Is it an AI, is it a demon? What is Cherub? Please, help me! Every time I close my eyes, those horrible orbs are there, eating a piece of my soul. I am trapped. I am scared. I do not know what to do anymore. Has anyone heard of Cherub.exe?
