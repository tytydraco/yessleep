[\[John's Stories 2 (Pt. 2)\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1aqflzd/pt_j2_i_am_a_private_military_contractor_from_the/)

For the sake of when The Department inevitably digs up these files, these are strictly for record-keeping of my work, and Confidentiality with my Patients and coworkers is still intended; but there is something going on here that isn’t being told to the Public. 

John Johnson, 32, Local of South Carolina, and Co-Pilot for a very unusual Helicopter Squad within our Organization, will be the main subject for this Log. (\*Almost\*) All Combat Personnel are required to have Monthly Psychiatric checkups on behalf of the intensity of their work, and even more frequent for groups that specialize or are frequently in contact with paranormal or, dare I say, otherworldly activity, He is definitely one of the latter, on top of his own issues of being raised in such a stressful environment.

“...Please, Prescribe me some Sleeping pills or something at the least, I know the budget for the more serious stuff is tight.” he said recently in a session, as his \\\[and his Squadmates’\\\] designated Psychiatrist, I hear this plea a lot more than I’m comfortable with experiencing why for myself.

“You know I can’t allow that John, mixing Pills with Alcohol is harmful enough, if you quit drinking at the least, I’d write you up for whatever you need.”

He stared at the floor for 10- 20- 30-  seconds in silence, staring at his boots, barely breathing; he had a very unsociable nature, frequently Silent during our sessions until provoked, much like his fellow Pilot, Dmitri. He eventually exhaled heavily and shook his head at the floor, muttering to me despite not looking in my direction.

“Have you ever been out there?” a solemn, understanding tone, and a general question I get frequently from my Patients.

“No, not for quite some time, I know it’s not looking good.”

He nodded at the floor in response, and rubbed his eyes before deciding to meet my gaze.

“Then how much do you know about ‘in here?’ You work with The Department? Handing over every weakness and tidbit you can get off of me? Turn us into some labrat sleeper agents? Damned C.I.A wannabes.”

While as far as I knew, it wasn’t true, he was starting to make me uncomfortable, The Department of Information and Media DOES have unrestricted access to my computer, they could be reading this as I typed for all I know, and they definitely deal with far more than just what their name implies, even if it’s just suspicions and whispers that tend to get ‘silenced’ in one way or another.

I realized I’d probably been silent a bit too long after I said that, one of the most essential parts of my job is trust, and in a field of patients with so little of it, it’s dangerous to lose. To something as silly as Conspiracy theories, “I’m a part of the Health WIng, I have nothing to do with them.” I answered, as honestly as I knew.

While I tried to at least look sincere he looked increasingly panicked, not fearful or reclusive, which were more common emotional responses, but a level of panic that had him scrambling for his sidearm, but as per policy, was locked at the front desk, he was glancing to the door, but now even I felt watched.

“Sorry, really, they won’t kill me, I’m too valuable to them, but God, you’re nothing, nothi- hrm-uh-look, time’s up, Thank you, Sir.” and he scrambled out of the room, past me, and unlocking the door , bursting into a pounding of footsteps down the hall. For professionality, I wrote it off as an Episode, and called the front desk to withhold his firearm for the day until he calmed down. But I have a feeling this is something outside of any kind of profession I have.

I don’t own a car (most people don’t on behalf of cost, rentals are always available though) as my home was a nice walk from the Hospital complex, warm, soft street lamps lighting the thin street and sidewalks, trees, bushes, gardens with lots of pleasant fragrances this time of year; I live alone, but the nearby bar is always bustling if I need company, but for the most part, I continue my work in my Study, doing my best to live up to the expectations of what knowledge someone might have had with a College Degree Pre-war.

I had picked through my collection of textbooks and note binders to a book specializing in Psychosis, John’s Session intriguing me to look more into it, but I was instead greeted with something already sitting neatly on my desk, a small Telegraph-looking notecard with the plainly printed ‘Tomorrow, 15:00 Block A-4, Floor 4, Director Phan’. 

This would normally be a pretty esoteric way to request it, but this was a Meeting, not a request, a demand, but lots of things were odd about it:

I dreadfully arrived at THE Block A-4; The Department HQ, which from the outside, clearly only had 3 Floors. Secondly, The Department should only have a single Director, this had to be a Hoax, I hoped it was a prank, but it is far safer to follow instructions than to ignore them around here.

“Hello, I’m here for, Director Phan?” I asked at the front desk, the clerk taking a moment to look at me with confusion , check something on her computer, and then look back to me.

“You must be Mr. Morte, just take the staircase up to the Fourth floor, security has been informed you’ll be arriving shortly.

I am still confused about the whole Fourth floor thing, There is definitely only 3 floors from the few times I’ve been here, but I guess I’ve never had to go higher, but as it seems, I climbed:

Floor 2: Records

Floor 3: IT and Research

And there was indeed, another staircase upwards:

Floor 4: Anomalous Research

I knew weird stuff went on, and I knew we had some kind of branch for it based on some of my Patients, but they were always squeamish to divulge information about it, but here it is, hidden away on the nonexistent floor of a bleak Office building. I didn’t get much more time to think about it, as heavily armed {Which cannot be understated for a Compound where people already casually walk around with Rifles and Armor that couldn’t have been imagined a few decades ago) security converged on me as I Idled at the Stairwell plaque.

“Abel Mortes?”

“Uh, Y-yes?” ‘This is how I die, in the Hallway of a Glorified IRS Office.’ I thought to myself as they continued to walk towards me.

“Excellent, please follow us, these halls can be- well, tricky for a first-timer.”

“Ah, thank you.”

The floor seemed pretty empty, the closed off offices and nauseating Gray, labyrinthian hallways only broken up by the occasional physical of psychological discomfort of passing a few of the doors, and security checkpoints, which were of course, Manned with more security, guns aren’t my thing, but their gear seemed pretty nice compared to the casual Security gear you’d see on the street or in other Civil buildings. Eventually and after a bit longer than I thought would be possible in a building the size of a City Block,, we stopped, passing through a Stainless-Steel airlock to yet more offices, but instead of continuing, the Guard in front of me immediately turned around, and gestured to a door:

‘Evan Phan - DIrector of Anomalous, Environmental Units Director - Correspondent’ The brass Plaque blandly read in three lines.

“Here you are, good luck, we’ll be here if, you know, you need us” he said with a classic tone of Southern Hospitality while patting the sling of his Rifle.

I went in, very unnerved, but pleasantly surprised to just find a normal Secretary’s Office, she seemed busy, but looked up to me and pointed an open hand towards the door ahead, I anxiously stepped forward and opened the door, my analytical mind melting at the Maximalist design of the room, loaded with all kinds of Junk, Flags, Mannequins donning a variety of odd Outfits, and of course, the Mr. Phan himself, and the shocking matted black hair and pasty skin all too familiar to me.

“And here he is now, sit down, Doctor, we heard about John’s little Incident yesterday.” the Broad Chested Asian man said, probably not much taller than John who sat with his back to me, looking over his shoulder with bloodshot fear burning into my eyes. 

I’m definitely not going verbatim for the following (and probably confidential) conversation that follows, but I’ve ended up being given far more responsibility as a Psychiatrist, it turns out that it wasn’t just me, there is a lot of experiences that my poor Patients have had to do their best to self-censor, I’ve definitely heard some slip-ups, but I didn’t mention it for their sake, but John’s was a step too far, and to keep me ‘contained’, I’m now the resident Psychiatrist to specialize in the Paranormal, conveniently keeping much of the same clientele, notably, of course, John and his crew, which will all have their own Log entries eventually, I’m sure. Notably, I’m no longer staffed at the Health Department, I’m getting my own office with unheard of amenities up in the Anomalous department; I’m sure it’s bugged or something, but I have a feeling my old office wasn’t all that different in that regard.

As scary as my first contact with- I don’t know what to call it, ‘The Anomalous Department’ I guess would be easiest, I don’t think I’ll ever be out of the clear, I guess I’ll have to finish the Log with some other findings on Mr. Johnson with more recent evaluation.

Potential and severe Trauma-Bonding with Squadmates, including but not limited to events involving Heavenly Entities, Cult Activities, Teleportation (still can’t believe that fully, explains the fourth floor I guess), particularly with Dmitri Petrov, relates to fixation on him in previous Sessions. Antisocial behavior deemed to be unrelated to Paranormal activity, may be due to time before joining Company, or during childhood. Abnormally close relation to the Colonel of the Scout Corps, which Phan is also intimately familiar with, I have no Psyche records on him even with access to the expanded database, will have to look into him further.
