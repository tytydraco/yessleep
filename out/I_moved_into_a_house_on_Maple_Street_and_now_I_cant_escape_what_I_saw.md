"Okay, so I’ve never believed in ghosts. I always thought it was all just superstition, you know? But now? After what I experienced on Maple Street, I’m not so sure anymore.

I found this place in a small town, the kind that feels like it’s stuck in time. Maple Street. Honestly, nothing stood out about it. The houses were old, some even abandoned. It was quiet, maybe too quiet. But I was looking for a place to rent while working nearby, and this house was the perfect price.

It was old, sure—creaky floors, drafty windows—but it had a certain charm. Perfect for me, living alone and needing some space. I stayed mostly on the main floor—bedroom, living room, kitchen. The upstairs? I never went up there. Didn’t need to.

The first few days were fine. Normal. Until the noises started.

At night, the house would fall completely silent. But it wasn’t a peaceful quiet. It was... heavy. Like something was lurking just beneath the surface. It started small—scratching noises from the floor above me. I figured it was just the house settling. But no, it kept happening. Every night at exactly 3 A.M.

The noises weren’t just random. It was more like footsteps—slow, deliberate dragging noises. It was like someone was pacing above me.

I didn’t want to believe it, but the second night, I heard it again. Scraping. Dragging. I had to check it out.

Climbing the stairs was like stepping into a different world. The air was cold, colder than it should’ve been. And when I got to the top of the stairs? There was this... wrong feeling. Like something wasn’t right.

I walked down the hall and saw it—one of the doors was slightly open. Inside, there was this faint light, but it wasn’t coming from anywhere visible. It was just... there.

I hesitated. For a moment, I stood frozen, staring at the door. Then, I don’t know why, but I reached for the doorknob. The door creaked open on its own.

Inside, the room was empty—except for a dusty chair by the window, some old boxes, and a large mirror on the wall. As I stepped further inside, I could feel the air press in on me. It was thick, heavy. I looked at the mirror, and for a second, I thought maybe the dim light was playing tricks.

But then I saw it.

A figure—behind me, in the reflection.

I spun around, heart racing. Nothing. Just the empty room.

I turned back to the mirror, trying to shake it off. But there it was again. My reflection, but not exactly. It was me, but wrong. The eyes—dark, hollow, like something was staring out from behind them. And then I heard it again. The dragging noise. But it was louder now.

I turned around, expecting something... anything. But there was nothing. Just the silence.

I left the room fast, locked the door, and went downstairs, but I couldn’t shake the feeling. Something was watching me.

The next day, I called the landlord. He was an older guy, quiet. He told me the house was old, nothing to worry about. But I had to ask about the upstairs. He told me it had been locked up for years, no one had been up there.

I didn’t buy it, but I let it go... for a while.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The silence was unbearable. I kept hearing things. Footsteps. Scraping. I had to know what was going on, so I grabbed the key and went back upstairs.

The room—the one with the mirror—was wide open. I didn’t know what to do, but I had to go in.

Everything was different. The room was no longer empty. There was a bed, a desk with papers scattered everywhere. And there, on the floor in the middle of the room, was a note.

It said: *I’ve been waiting for you.*

I felt ice run through my veins. The dragging noise started again, louder, closer. I spun around, but again, there was nothing.

And then I saw it. In the mirror.

My reflection. But this time... it wasn’t me. The eyes were dark, hollow. And then it smiled. It wasn’t a comforting smile. It was twisted.

I turned to leave, but then I heard a whisper from the corner. Soft, but unmistakable.

*You’ve been here before.*

The door slammed shut behind me. I tried to get out, but the handle wouldn’t budge. Footsteps grew closer behind me.

I finally managed to get the door open and bolted down the stairs. I ran out of the house, and when I looked back, it looked normal. Ordinary. Nothing like the nightmare I’d just experienced.

I left that night, and I haven’t been back. But I can’t escape what happened. The nightmares. In them, I’m always standing in front of that mirror, staring at the twisted smile that’s mine... but isn’t.

And sometimes, even when I’m awake, I swear I can feel a cold hand on my shoulder, pulling me back. I’ve tried to move on, but I know deep down, it’s not over. It’s waiting. And one day, I might just go back. I don’t think I’ll be able to resist."
