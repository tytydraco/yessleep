I need help. I was coming home from hanging out with my friends. It was a normal Wednesday evening until i got lost. I've lived in Toronto all my life and I've never gotten lost But tonight was different. When i finally found my way, i realized that I missed the midnight train. I decided to sleep a little next to fred (the homeless guy that lives on the bench) while waiting for an announcement but the intercom said that a train was arriving. The 25 AM train. I was confused but i was even more tired so I decided to climb aboard. Before the doors closed, i heard Fred whisper:

"Don't do it Zoe, dont go into that train."

I'm scared. I have been stuck on the 25 AM train for multiple hours now. It didn't stop once and I think I am underground (i can only see rock outside the window). The intercom said that the next stop was in 15 minutes but I fear what is going to be outside once i get out. I did the inventory of my possessions and i have: a hairbrush, 2 rice crispies bar (off brand because i am poor), a 500 millilitrers water bottle, a mascara wand and my phone. I have wifi and my phone does not seem to lose it's battery. Can someone help me? I have no family or friend that are waiting for me at home and no work to show up to. No one will know i am missing. I am desperate, thirsty and hungry. The temperature is dropping and i am shivering. I just want to go home. There will be my information at the end of the post. Please, can anybody help and notify the police. 

...

Fuck, the train didnt stop. Actually it did, it's just the doors that didn't open. As we approached the station, I felt the train run over something big and It screamed in pain. We stayed still at the station for about 20 minutes. Those 20 minutes wete the most terrifying of my life because a Clown was looking at me. And it laughed. But its mouth move. His flower's mouth did instead. I also saw fred sleeping on a bench, but it was not the same bench i left him on. I am so scared. I dont know where i am. Please, i beg of you, find me before something kills me.

It's dark out. I can almost see the stars behind the clouds. The next stop is in about 5 minutes. I dont know how long I've been in here but it feels like months. This is my last wish. Kill me.
