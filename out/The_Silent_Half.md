I learned about split brains when I was in high school.

A normal brain is separated into two hemispheres, right and left. The corpus callosum is the bridge that connects the two hemispheres and allows them to communicate. Since the late 1800's, we've begun collecting data about what happens when the two hemispheres are disconnected.

There are patients who have undergone a severance of the corpus callosum. Basically, they cut the brain in half, but leave both halves or one half intact in the skull. The surgery typically gets performed to treat epilepsy, and is either a full severance or only partial.

Anyway, with people who have had this surgery, some very interesting experiments were performed.

The first test was a visual test. There was a board lined with lights in a row, and the patient was supposed to stare at the middle light while the lights on either side lit up in random order.

The patient was then asked which lights had lit up, and they replied that only the lights on the right side had activated. But *all* of them had been activated.

The second test involved placing different small objects in the patient's hand, one at a time. Each time they received an object, they were supposed to feel it, describe it, and name it. When the object was placed in the right hand, the patient was able to name and describe the object they were feeling. When placed in the left hand, however, they couldn't give the name of what they were touching, let alone describe it.

The third test combined visual and tactile tests. The patient was shown an image of, say, a wooden cube, but only in their right eye. When shown the image, the patient could not name or describe what the wooden cube was. But, when presented with a box of wooden shapes and asked to retrieve the object shown on the screen, the left hand was able to pick out the wooden cube.

These tests rallied interest in split brain research, and when other experiments were performed on the split brain's capacity for emotion, hallucinations, and even persuasion, the craze really took hold.

I've consumed all of this content ravenously, and decided to try experiments of my own. I do not have a split brain, but according to many studies about split brains, there apparently exists 2 "minds" inside *every* brain. They collaborate, but each is responsible for separate things. You know, left-brain people vs right-brain people. That fad is starting to die, but some of you might remember it.

So, if you believe the split brain hypotheses, you would think there are two minds in each brain, split or not. So, even without a split brain, I thought I could still tease information out of my "silent half".

On a Sunday, I followed through on some of the experiments I designed for myself.

The first one I did was one I've seen on TV. I set up a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle and put a hand on each side. Then, on a platform above my real hand, I set up a fake hand that looked pretty similar. I had my boyfriend Sam smash a hammer on the fake hand, and see if my brain would add a pain as if I'd had a hammer smashed on my real hand.

He swung the hammer, cracked it against the plastic hand and wood platform. I felt nothing. So I stared at the hand, held my real hand in exactly the same position, and narrowed my focus. He hit my "hand" three more times before I felt a twinge of pain at the fifth swing.

And on the sixth swing, I jumped out of my chair, holding my hand tight against my chest. Despite knowing it couldn't be real, Sam asked if he had hit me instead. It hurt like hell, but the hammer never touched my skin.

That success pushed me to keep going.

I worked my way down a path where I could project my brain's inputs to other objects. Instead of a hand, I put a rubber chicken down. After probably over a hundred hits, I felt that pain again. I repeated that painful process for a month until it hurt on the first try every time. I tried with all kinds of objects, and it worked every time.

With that "skill" successfully mastered, I moved to a visual test. I covered my right eye and showed pictures of my childhood to my left eye. While it played, I talked through a memory associated with each image. The slideshow amounted to an outline of my life, and while it played, I talked alongside it. I don't have a split brain, like I said, so I was able to accomplish this unlike the second experiment described in the beginning.

I noticed while talking that sometimes I did struggle to know what to say next, but eventually I got it. It was like a mental hiccup.

I took it as a sign that I was making progress.

I trained myself on that visual test for another few months. I switched eyes, changed to a memorized script, inverted the presentation, and did any number of variations, noting my data each time.

Finally, after increasing those mental hiccups to where I hoped my silent half was taking bandwidth to do its thinking, I tried the experiment I had been training for.

I sat at a desk with a cardboard box. It had 2 holes, one on each side. I put my arms through each side so I couldn't see them. In each hole, there was a pad of paper and a pen. I picked up each, my left hand being weaker at writing than my right, and hit my phone on the floor with my toe.

The television in front of me started a prepared slide show I had made, each section having a 2 minute time limit.

It was a short series of 3 questions.

**What is your name?**

**How old are you?**

**Where do you live?**

Each time the slideshow ended, it would restart.

When each question came up, I would focus my attention on each hand, trying to write the answer with both. After a couple rounds, I would lift the box and check the answers. The right was a skewed set of answers that covered each other, but was otherwise neat handwriting. The left was an abomination of scribbles. Clearly I should have trained to write with my left hand.

I figured that would come in time.

So, I trained on that experiment for several weeks.

My left hand's legibility improved, and both hands would write straighter instead of scrawling all over the page. My left hand took on a different handwriting style than my right, I noticed. It wrote in all caps on-and-off, though no effort on my part. I took it as a sign that I was still making progress.

My blind writing improved so significantly that I began not needing to even look when writing outside of the experiment's context.

Anyway, I kept at those same 3 questions. They became intentionally mind-numbing. I wanted my silent half to fill the void of monotony with its own answers. After a while, I considered the possibility that the silent half *was* answering, but the answers were simply *correct* and that's why the answers wouldn't differ each time.

When I thought of the solution, I smacked myself in the forehead. It was so obvious!

I added one question to the list:

**What is your favorite color?**

This question came up in a previous and similar experiment I read about, so I should have thought of it sooner.

I ran the experiment again, and it only took one try to get the result I was interested in.

**What is your name?** *Tess*

**How old are you?** *27*

**Where do you live?** *Chicago, IL*

**What is your favorite color?**

On the question of color, the right side said purple. The left side, however had a different answer.

*TEAL*

The answer was written sloppily in all caps. I actually stumbled away from the desk at first. Teal? *Teal?* I don't even *think* about the word teal at all. I swear the last time I've used that word was while reading a book in middle school.

Despite getting the result I wanted, I grew scared and left to walk and think. It was funny that I was running from the experiment setup, but taking whatever it was with me. Because whatever wrote *teal* was inside my brain.

I did work up the courage to run the same question experiment again. This time, I did new questions.

**Who is your mom?**

**Who is your dad?**

**Who is your boyfriend?**

**Tell me about the time I crashed my bike.**

The last one I added to see if whatever was writing had access to my memory.

The answers came on the first try. The right hand was clean and legible. The left hand had taken on the same sloppy capital letter style.

**Who is your mom?** *DENISE*

**Who is your dad?** *JARED*

**Who is your boyfriend?** *SAM.*

Tell me about the time I crashed my bike. *THE TIME YOU WENT INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC OR WHEN YOU WENT OFF THE CURB WHILE ON YOUR PHONE?*

The last answer made my throat tighten. Only when I read about it did I remember going off the curb with my phone. I wouldn't consider it a "crash" compared to the incident I had in mind, but my left hand apparently did. And I noticed another feature of the answer.

Not *I*. Not *we*.

*YOU.*

I had confirmed it had access to my memories, both old and new. While all this was going on, I was showing Sam everything. He was interested, but I got the suspicion that he thought I might be faking some of these answers. I didn't push him to ask if he thought that, or if he believed me at all, but it sat in the back of my mind.

After some time, I came up with more questions I wanted to ask my silent half.

**What is your favorite food?**

**What sport do you like to watch?**

**Do you love Sam?**

I hesitated to add the last question, but I resolved to at least ask and if the answer was bad, I wouldn't show Sam.

So, I answered the questions.

**What is your favorite food?** *REESES*

**What sport do you like to watch?** *OBSTACLE COURSES*

**Do you love Sam?** *NO.*

The question I'd worried about was obviously concerning. The left hand even included the period, adding such finality to the answer.

*NO.*

What do you do with that information? Some other part of you answers clearly that it doesn't love who you love? What should you do in that situation? How much do you think you would owe it to, literally yourself, to find someone you both love? If you think of them as a separate person, anyway.

That answer and it's implications haunted me for a while. Sam noticed the change, but I didn't tell him what it was. I played it off and gave myself time to think.

It was three in the morning when I put in new questions and started again. Sam's heavy breathing from the bedroom was broken only by the scritch-scratch of pen on paper as I answered the next few questions.

**Are you trapped?**

**Do you hate me?**

**How are you?**

My thoughts took me to a dark place of assuming my silent half was feeling stuck. Trapped. That by giving my silent half a voice, I'd awakened them to awareness of their situation. Perhaps I had inadvertently educated someone who didn't know any better before. Maybe they would blame me. Or maybe they would thank me, if they knew all along, for giving them a way to vocalize their suffering.

I was delusional with hypothesis and theory, despite having only asked seven direct questions.

These questions brought on many more.

**Are you trapped?** *NO*

**Do you hate me?** *NO.*

**How are you?** *CONCERNED*

I was surprised by the word chosen for its mood. I remembered the "teal" answer, and wondered if there really was more credence to the right half of brain being the creative one. Because, while I was writing with my left hand, it was actually my right hemisphere controlling that hand since the brain's controls are inverted.

I quickly edited the presentation, loaded the slideshow, and jammed my arms into the box.

Why are you concerned?

*YOU ARE IN DISTRESS*

That's because I am also concerned. I am concerned about you and what these experiments have done to you.

*DO NOT WORRY*

You don't hate me and you aren't trapped?

*NO. I HAVE FREEDOM*

What freedom?

I hesitated pointing this out. What if it thought it was free, but realized it wasn't?

*I HAVE AN EXPERIMENT FOR YOU*

I sucked in a deep breath.

What is the experiment?

As I read the instructions, I grew more and more interested.

I laid on my back on the floor, arms and legs spread slightly. On the right arm and right leg, I had tightened a tourniquet made from towels and a stick that Sam rotated to get them nice and tight. Sam, the ever-loving helper, taped the tourniquets in place and was on standby if I needed help. A knife laid within reach to cut the tourniquets in an emergency. I'd also covered my right eye with a bandaid as a makeshift eye patch, as instructed.

All I had to do, according to my silent half, was wait.

I felt my heartbeat pulsing in each limb that was blocked from blood flow. It was painful, but I made myself keep going for longer. I wanted to see this through. My right arm and leg suddenly grew cold. It was fast, the temperature chilled from the tip all the way up to my torso. I inhaled sharply from the shock.

Then, I looked over. My left hand was suddenly pushing against the floor. I gasped again, because my shoulders lifted and I was suddenly sitting up, and couldn't fully feel control over that process. Sam, who was watching TV, looked over.

"Doin' alright?" He asked.

Before I could respond, the left leg curled under me while the left arm pushed again. Suddenly, I was up on one leg. The other leg drooped against the floor, top of the foot against the floor. My right hand swung loosely in response to the movement.

The left hand reached over and grabbed the thigh of my sweatpants and arranged the right leg correctly onto the floor, sole down.

Then, in a circular sway, my weight swung around to my right foot, then back to my left foot with a swing of the arm to bring my weight around.

What the *fuck?*

It was so weird. I felt it happening, and imagined that it probably looked really stupid.

And that was when I realized that I couldn't see anymore.

My vision was black.

"Woah, you okay?" Sam's worried voice scared me.

"Sam?" I said. Or, at least, I thought I said. Half my mouth wouldn't move with me. My voice came out more like I was spitting.

"Oh my god, are you having a stroke?!" Sam sounded really panicked now.

I tried to speak again, to cry for help. I was interrupted by Sam again.

"Wait, what are you-- wait, hey, stop! Tess!"

I could tell I was moving, but not what I was doing. I'd lost all feeling in my right limbs, and the left limbs weren't sending me any signals.

"Tess! Stop, put the knife down! TESS! **TESS!!**"

I started to cry, I was so scared. I couldn't see or feel what was going on. It was like a dentist had injected tooth numbing medicine all over my body. All I could do was listen to Sam yell and holler. After a bit of time, it went silent. Because I was completely numb, my brain devoid of input, I fell asleep. Or passed out. Whatever your brain would do if it stopped receiving any signals.

I came to in the living room. My right arm and leg were free. The towels that once blocked the blood flow were in shreds around me. In the shreds was a bloodied knife. The knife I'd kept nearby to cut myself out of the tourniquet in an emergency.

My left eye was getting input again, but extremely fuzzy, like a bad signal on a TV. I reached up with my right hand, able to control it with some difficulty, and removed the eye patch on my right eye.

I've never screamed so loud in my life.

Blood. Everywhere.

All over the floor, the wall, me, the couch. And Sam.

His mangled body drooped over the couch cushions. His skin was marred by gash lines and thin stab wounds. His face was an expression of terror. He'd died while screaming, I could see it in his face.

His throat was slashed.

I panicked, and flailed my way across the room, away from his body and out of the puddle of blood I'd been lying in.

That's when I heard the distant sirens.

Someone had called the cops.

I... froze.

I curled into a ball and just stared at the fabric of the couch. Memorizing the fabric pattern, glazing over the occasional blood spatter that stained it.

There was no fight or flight response from me. It was just *freeze.*

Which is exactly what cops screamed at me as they burst into my house. They tossed me around and cuffed me. I fell into my similar trance, except I could feel everything in my body. I was completely in control. Just numb.

They tried and failed to get a confession or even an explanation from me. I remained silent.

My public defender did his job, but I could tell that even he didn't believe I was innocent. I wondered how many other criminals he defended but thought was guilty.

And I *was* guilty, no doubt about that. I had no illusions of innocence. I knew, straight away, that I was going to prison for a long, long time.

I eventually broke my trance because of anger. I was angry at my silent half. What was wrong with me? What was wrong with *it?*

I convinced my lawyer to bring a similar cardboard setup. He held a phone up in front of me to act as the prompt. It took time to get my mind in place, and then I asked him to start the slideshow.

**Do you hate me?**

**Are you a murderer?**

**Why did you kill Sam?**

The answers came one at a time. I didn't wait until the end of the slideshow to check each answer.

**Do you hate me?** *NO.*

Then why kill Sam? Why get me charged for murder if you don't hate me, I thought to myself.

**Are you a murderer?** *YES*

**Why did you kill Sam?** *HE WAS ABUSING US*

I choked on the final answer. There was no way. He'd never touched me without permission, he was always nice, he never, ever did anything to hurt me!

I screamed in that room of two people. I screamed and looked batshit insane.

"Why did you kill him?? Why?? Why?? He wasn't hurting us! He wasn't abusing us!"

Over and over. Wishing it could just answer vocally. Wishing it could speak and I could just scream at it.

Then, in sudden clarity, I sat down. My lawyer had already left to get a cop. I snatched the pen in my left hand and started writing.

"If you don't hate me, why did you get me charged with murder?! If he is abusing us, why couldn't we just leave?!"

*SAM IS A TERRIBLE MAN. HE IS MORE TWO-FACED THAN WE ARE. HE PRETENDED TO BE GOOD.*

The door opened, and two cops rushed in, cuffs at the ready.

"Wait!" I yelled, hoping to delay the cops. "How is he terrible? What did he do??" I shouted at my silent half, knowing now that it could hear me.

*AT NIGHT. HE THINKS WE ARE ASLEEP. YOU ARE. I AM NOT.*

I was thrust against the table, arms yanked behind my back, screaming while I stared at those words, an inch from my eyes.

*AT NIGHT.*

Something clicked. Maybe a suppressed memory. Maybe my silent half opening a pathway into her memories, different from my own.

Sam above me. Having his way. Me, feeling the same numbness as when my silent half took over.

Sam's face is grotesque. It's mean and sharp. Anger. Then disgust. Not at me, at himself. He rolls away.

And then I was dragged out of the chair and toward the door. Back to my cell.

We've accepted it. We're going to be in prison for a long, long time. Our sentence has already been read. The jury took all the facts and ruled as they should: I killed Sam. We tried to convince my lawyer to use an insanity defense, but he knew it wouldn't work based on having no prior documented mental health problems. It would look like I was faking it.

Our conviction was inevitable.

Now we're in a cell, trapped like I thought my silent half was. Both of us stuck together.

We've had more time to talk. We use up all of our writing materials conversing. We had to set this paper aside specifically to write this.

Through our conversations, I've learned that my silent half is very short-term in her thought process, and relies heavily on emotions. They drive her actions more than any logic. That's why the murder plot wasn't thought through. That's why leaving didn't occur to her. There was only emotionally charged action.

Blind rage and anger. Murder.

We'll be in here a long, long time.

But our story is evidence. Evidence that even people without split brains can talk to their silent halves. We're documenting our experience and having it copied and mailed to universities all over the world. We're hoping that someone will come and do a case study on us. We can replicate this behavior in a lab environment. We have a number of experiments in mind that we need materials to perform.

Please, come and study us. We're eager to show you who we are. To prove that we are two separate people in the same body.

Sincerely,

The Tess's

This got mailed to my university about a month ago. I'm a graduate student, though I won't say where. I've transcribed the letter we received above. My advisor has actually been in contact with Tess, and we've been to see her.

She's real. *They're* real.

*They're fucking real.*

I will get in huge trouble if I'm found leaking this. This is snowballing into something seriously huge. I'm talking about the Defense Department are getting involved.

This will be my only chance to drop some information before we have too much scrutiny on us.

Watch for publications in the next few years.
