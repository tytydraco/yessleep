A few months ago, my friend and I were walking back to his place from a party at around 3 AM. We entered a run-down part of the city. Dark silhouettes disappeared into doorways as they saw us passing- human predators who roamed the shadowy streets, looking for easy prey and fresh meat. This area had lots of gang activity. Finding drugs here was easier than finding a bottle of soda. I kept my OC-tear gas spray close at hand. My friend, Cook, had a wicked switchblade that he always carried with him wherever he went. I had only seen him have to use it once, but that memory still made me shudder.
  

  
Smashed windows filled with shadows looked down like blind, dilated pupils. Tight alleyways wound through abandoned factories and apartment buildings. The eyes of countless scavengers gleamed white in the flickering streetlights. Rats scurried past overflowing dumpsters. Their tiny voices formed a symphony of squeaks and growls as they hurried past our feet on their way to eat garbage and rotting meat.
  

  
We moved quickly through the streets. I felt eyes on me, both human and animal. Off in the distance, the faint echo of gunshots pierced the silence. As we walked, Cook told me about the newest urban legend he had heard. Cook knew about every conspiracy theory and urban legend under the sun. He seemed like a walking encyclopedia of almost entirely useless knowledge. 
  

  
I had previously heard rumors on some backwoods internet forums about a couple people who took a supernatural train that went through alternate Earths and other, much stranger worlds. Apparently, only one returned alive, and he had been badly wounded and almost insane by the time he got back. They had never found the body of the other person. Cook knew the survivor personally and had even talked to him before his trip. Cook told me that this bizarre subway was called the “Eldritch Tram” by urban legend enthusiasts in the area. Neither of us liked being in this area of the city in the dark, though Cook knew it far better than me. I heard a tremble in his voice as he tried to project a mask of calmness and confidence.
  

  
“Not many people know about it,” he said, glancing over at me with eyes the faded green of dying plants. A jagged scar ran across Cook’s cheek from a knife fight he had gotten in as a teenager. He had on a black hoodie pulled down low over his shaved head. His shoes and jeans were also as black as coal. Other than his pale, thin face glowing white under the streetlights, he looked like a dark shadow simply passing through the dead streets. 
  

  
Up ahead, a homeless man wearing filthy, tattered clothes lay swaddled like an infant in a pile of blankets. His glazed eyes stared blankly up at nothing. I glanced down at him, then quickly stepped back in horror. I saw he was dead, his throat viciously slashed from ear to ear. Blood pooled under his body, soaking through the dirty, gray blankets and disappearing into the cracks of the litter-strewn sidewalk. Cook kept walking for a few moments, continuing to babble about how this one urb-ex girl first discovered the Eldritch Tram a year ago by accident while exploring the abandoned Market Street substation. He hadn’t even noticed my reaction or the dead body only a few feet away from him.
  

  
“Cook!” I hissed. He jumped slightly, whipping his head around to look back at me. I pointed to the corpse near his feet. His eyes widened as he finally took in the scene.
  

  
A gray blanket filled with small rips and cigarette burns covered the dead man’s body from below his chest to his ankles. As we took in the scene, I realized the blanket was moving. It looked like something small skittered under the surface, perhaps some scavengers feasting on the cold flesh. Cook reached down suddenly, gripping the blanket’s corner with a tightly clenched fist.
  

  
“No!” I hissed instinctually, not wanting to see. But it was too late. Cook pulled. The filthy covering slid off, revealing the ineffable nightmare waiting underneath.
  

  
The homeless man’s body showed signs of extreme torture and mutilation. Some psychopath had dissected the poor man’s torso, pulling the skin apart until it reminded me of the open curtains of a stage. The homeless man’s heart lay exposed, a red fist of gleaming, slick muscle. His intestines lay uncoiled around him like a den of dead snakes. Someone had neatly sliced off his hands, and they were nowhere to be seen. 
  

  
A few rats gnawed at the cold, stiff flesh, disappearing into the mutilated folds of gore and bloody pockets lining the man’s chest. Others pulled at the ragged strips of angry, red skin around the man’s dripping stumps of wrists, squeaking and hissing at each other as they each tried to grab the tastiest morsels. 
  

  
I gagged, taking a step back and nearly tripping over the sidewalk curb. Cook stood there, shell-shocked, his mouth wide open. A strange, humming sound came from him, a kind of dissociated “Uhhhh…”
  

  
 A cold, clear laugh rang out through the night. I immediately felt goosebumps rise all over my body as a figure stepped out of a nearby alleyway, a massive man who must have been nearly seven-feet-tall. He wore a silky, black robe that billowed around his bulging muscles. On his head, he had on a pointed black executioner’s hood with two jagged holes cut out for eyes. He seemed larger than life standing there, looming over us. He held a blood-stained machete in one hand and an ancient revolver in the other. Cook came to life then, stuttering and backpedaling as he yanked his switchblade from his pocket, waving it in front of him as if it were a holy talisman able to hold back this evil presence.
  

  
“Run, Cook!” I screamed. I turned, sprinting down the street as quickly as I could without looking back to see if Cook would follow. A gunshot like a cannon blast exploded behind me, its harsh ring reverberating down the empty street. I heard Cook’s shoes slamming the pavement hard behind me as another gunshot rang out. I felt a pain that was simultaneously cold and burning radiate through my left arm. A stream of blood instantly began pouring from the wound. My arm felt numb, but I couldn’t bear to look down.
  

  
“The subway tunnels!” Cook cried out behind me as he turned into a narrow alleyway filled with overflowing dumpsters and more skittering rats. “They’re right here! Follow me, Justin!” He sprinted ahead, veering left into another open street littered with broken glass and dirty needles. On both sides of us, I saw abandoned tenement buildings. Cook pointed ahead to a set of ominous concrete stairs. 
  

  
He sprinted down them with bounding steps like a madman, taking three at a time. There was no railing and they were slick with the brown trickles of polluted water, but with the amount of adrenaline coursing through my bloodstream, I had no problem following close behind at his heels. We descended down seven or eight stories. The darkness grew thicker and more oppressive as we got farther away from the streetlights of the city. At the bottom, we found ourselves in a series of dark tunnels with dim bulbs strung every thirty or forty feet along the ceilings.
  

  
Cook seemed to know where he was going, so I followed close behind without saying much. As we sprinted for our lives, I looked down at my arm, my breath catching in my throat as I saw all the blood. But I tried to move it, wiping away some of the blood with a stained sleeve. With a flood of relief, I realized the bullet had only grazed the flesh. The bone wasn’t hit and the bullet hadn’t lodged inside the wound. The bleeding had already started to slow considerably, so I doubted whether it had hit any major blood vessels or arteries. Considering the circumstances, I considered myself extremely lucky. However, my arm continued to pound in time with my heartbeat, and I knew it would be sore for a while to come.
  

  
Ahead of us, I heard a roaring as some giant mechanical heart shook the tunnels. Cook gave a triumphant roar as the dim, wet tunnel opened to a much larger one. I saw it was a subway tunnel. Echoes of a distant train roared throughout the corridor.
  

  
“Do trains run this late?” I asked. This wasn’t New York City, after all. I knew our subways didn’t run all night. Cook just shook his head, out of breath from running for our lives. I realized I didn’t even have any idea what time it was anymore.
  

  
“Holy shit, what happened to your arm?” he asked, looking at all the blood staining my long-sleeved shirt. 
  

  
“I got grazed by a bullet when that maniac was shooting at us,” I said. “We need to call the cops.” Justin took out his phone, shaking his head.
  

  
“There’s no service all the way down here. All the concrete and metal above us messes up the signal,” he said, walking along the tracks. “And stay away from that track.” He pointed to the chunky metal one covered in a layer of protective shielding. “It’s electrified. It’s got shielding, but I wouldn’t touch it.” The roaring in the tunnels seemed to get louder. Up ahead, I saw a concrete balcony open up on the left. “I can’t believe we ran into a total maniac. A serial killer, probably. What the hell, man?” I just nodded, exhausted. My entire body seemed to ache as the rush of adrenaline faded. My arm shrieked at me with pain as waves of agony radiated out from the gunshot wound.
  

  
“Is that a station up ahead?” I asked, gritting my teeth against the pain. Justin grinned at me, his face still pale and sweaty. His eyes looked slightly haunted and empty as he spoke.
  

  
“There’s quite a few abandoned stations down here,” he said. “Those abandoned stations are where the urban legends about the Eldritch Tram always start. That’d be our luck, right? Getting chased by a serial killer and then seeing a psychotic ghost train?” I pulled out my phone, seeing it was already 3:33 AM.
  

  
We sat at an ancient, tarnished bench at the abandoned platform, catching our breath. I looked around, seeing a tunnel with a metal gate pulled across it directly behind me. It sloped upwards. Before the station had been closed, it must have led up to the surface.
  

  
The concrete started to vibrate as if tremors of an earthquake were passing through the tunnels. I turned to Cook, trying to scream something, but I couldn’t hear my own voice as the shaking exploded into a full-blown cacophony of shrieking engines and rushing air. A blur of something dark red swept in front of our eyes.
  

  
Something wet smacked me in the back of the head. I jumped, spinning around. I saw Cook turn a second later as something pale blurred across the air and hit him in the chest. I glanced down, a sense of horror overtaking me as I realized it was a dismembered hand, the fingers curled up like the legs of a dessicated spider.
  

  
I looked over at the gated metal passageway leading up to the surface. The hooded executioner stood there, but he wasn’t hooded anymore. His pointed black hood must have come off sometime during his pursuit of us. Now a creature from a nightmare stood there, grinning like a demonic skull.
  

  
His skin gleamed like marble, as hard and white as a statue’s. Blue veins ran up and down his smooth, hairless head. He had no eyes or nose. Only flat, pale skin extended across the top of his face. The bottom of it was split into a sadistic smile that revealed a mouthful of thousands of thin, black needles.
  

  
His twisted fingers were intertwined in the vents of the gate. A rusted hole stood in the center, about the size of a basketball, and he began to rip at the metal. The train rapidly slowed behind us with a squealing of brakes and a low, groaning exhalation. A smell like wet mushrooms blew across the substation. After a few seconds, it stopped.
  

  
I saw the train for the first time as I turned to run away from the abomination that hunted us so mercilessly. It was some strange combination of life and machine. Glistening red muscles extended across the outside of it, contracting and relaxing in time with some giant hidden heart. Black veins intertwined like spiderwebs, running in fine streaks throughout the entire nightmarish, throbbing construction.
  

  
Its wheels looked like regular steel. It had some sort of framework of metal under all that flesh. Its doors opened like a sideways eyelid with a sickening squishing sound. The red muscle separated, dancing to the sides in slow, peristaltic bursts as a whirring of hidden motors opened the windowless steel doors underneath. The train went on as far as I could see in both directions, many hundreds of cars long. For all I knew, it could have been infinite.
  

  
The engines quickly wined down with a low, groaning sound. It sounded like the exhalations of some giant dragon. The muscles all up and down the train relaxed at once with a flabby, spongy, sucking sound. 
  

  
At the same time, I heard the rending of metal behind us. I looked back, seeing the grinning, nightmarish face of the eyeless abomination slowly drawing nearer. He was forcing his upper torso through the hole in the gate, looking like the world’s ugliest infant forcing its way out of some rusted birth canal. The metal gate started to separate from the wall with the cracking of cement and the tinkling of crashing metal. I looked up at Cook with a growing feeling of mortal terror. Cook glanced at the train’s open door in front of him, then back at the abomination.
  

  
“No,” I whispered in horror, but we both knew we had no choice. The eyeless creature finished bursting through the gate as the metal gave one last rending sound. The abomation’s gurgling, lunatic laugh reverberated throughout the empty station. It had no eyes, but I had the sense that it was looking directly at me in some way. 
  

  
“This is your ride, friends,” he hissed in a diseased, raspy voice, raising a bloody machete over his head and coming at us.
  

  
Cook pulled my arm. We ran through the doors into that never-ending nightmare of a train. They started to slide closed behind us with a steam-whistle shriek from the writhing flesh all around us. The creature sprinted towards us as the doors closed. I saw his machete coming down, the sharp blade whistling through the air and throwing off spatters of wet blood in all directions. As the doors finally closed, the machete burst through, half of the blade still quivering in the contracting mesh of metal and flesh.
  

  
\*\*\*
  

  
Like the exterior, the inside of the Eldritch Tram was a strange combination of machine construction and organic matter. A rusted framework of rusted steel latticework could be seen behind the glistening, pink substrate that covered the walls and ceiling. The organic substrate reminded me of lung tissue. It seemed to inhale and exhale very slowly as I watched it, like a slug flexing and relaxing its slimy body, rising and falling in cycles of thirty or forty seconds.
  

  
Beneath our feet, the train whined and groaned like a living thing coming to life. I heard the shrieking of metal wheels as they started rolling slowly forward. The throbbing of the flesh all around us pumped faster and faster, as if we stood inside the body of some brobdingnagian sprinter. 
  

  
There were empty seats in this car. Black veins crisscrossed them, throbbing in time with some massive organic heart. They constantly exuded a thick, dark fluid that smelled like an infected wound. Rivulets of this fetid liquid slowly dribbled down the walls and onto the purplish-black tiled floor. 
  

  
I looked up and saw a map, partially obscured under layers of pink flesh and a webbing of black veins. Bright fluorescent lights ran overhead, illuminating this den of horrors in a white glare. They flickered in disparate strobes, sending eerie shadows reaching in every direction like greedy, black hands.
  

  
“Look, Cook,” I whispered, my voice giving out. He still looked stunned, as if he didn’t know where he was or how he had gotten there. He was hyperventilating, but his wide, unseeing eyes followed my finger. He looked up at the map, his face blank and uncomprehending. He looked like a shell-shocked soldier for a few moments, and I feared that perhaps all the stress had snapped his mind. He stood staring at the map for a long moment, then he grinned. I read the locations, not recognizing any of them.
  

  
“I can’t believe it,” Cook said. “It’s actually real. The Eldritch Tram is real. I didn’t really think it was.”
  

  
“Can we still get off?” I asked. Cook laughed at that, a high-pitched, insane sound. His smile looked strained and thin. I figured that answered my question.
  

  
While most of the stops were covered in flesh or veins and were, therefore, unreadable, I could make out some of the names. The stops were repeated in multiple different languages, but I didn’t recognize most of them. Some of the scripts looked similar to Elvish or the Black Speech from Lord of the Rings, while others had thin, spiderweb-like tracings forming repeating spirals and slashes. The second to last language was English.
  

  
I saw a red dot tracing along the electrical circuit of the map, showing us our place. We had just left Market Street Station, the abandoned substation where the train had stopped. After that, I saw various places with bizarre names I had never heard of: Veriden, the Shadow Plains of the Collective Mind and, second to last, Naraka. Most confusing of all, the words ULTIMATE REALITY were emblazoned next to the dark light of the final stop.
  

  
As Cook and I studied the line map with fascination, the door at the end of the car gave a low buzz. My head jerked over as the pink flesh dilated like a pupil with a squishing, sucking sound. The metal door behind the alien skin slid open, revealing a man standing there with a sleek, black rifle in his hand. 
  

  
He raised the barrel, pointing it at us. I instantly saw that it was not any regular rifle. It looked like something from a science-fiction novel. Its exterior glimmered like obsidian and it came together in sharp, triangular points all along the top and sides. The barrel looked like an active volcano, constantly glowing red and belching narrow trickles of black smoke. He had his finger on the curving, blade-like trigger. I didn’t want to know what would happen if he pulled it.
  

  
“Don’t move,” the man said in a very strange accent, almost like some bizarre combination of a Caribbean accent and a Bostonian one. Cook gave me a nervous glance as I put my hands slowly in the air, not wanting to get shot by the newcomer.
  

  
\*\*\*
  

  
“Who are you? What are you doing riding on the X77?” he asked. “Are you agents of the Collective Mind?” I quickly shook my head. Cook stood there, his mouth hanging agape, his hands limply held to his sides.
  

  
“My name is Justin, and this is my friend Cook,” I said. “We got chased by some eyeless abomination in a black robe. The only way we could save our lives was to get on the train.”
  

  
“So the creature forced you into the train?” the man said, frowning. He had pale, almost colorless, blue eyes. His face had a faint smile, but his eyes didn’t smile. “You would have been better accepting your fate, friend. There are fates much worse than death. And this train passes through most of them.” 
  

  
“The X77?” Cook asked, seeming unaware of the danger. He frowned.
  

  
“This route is the X77,” he said, pointing at the map. Looking, I realized he was right. Half-covered under black veins and dribbling fluids, it read, “X77 Line.”
  

  
“You didn’t really think it was called the ‘Eldritch Tram’, did you?” I asked, smiling slightly. “That’s just something someone made up.” I looked back at the man pointing the gun at us.
  

  
The man’s face looked hard and aristocratic with a straight, hawk nose, large eyes and a thin, serious mouth. His clothes were strange. They reminded me of the dress of some backwoods Peruvian tribe. He had a hooded, dark brown poncho made of coarse cloth. Underneath, he wore plain black jeans and a long-sleeved shirt. His clothing almost seemed like a cowboy’s.
  

  
“People call me Brother,” the man said. I smiled.
  

  
“Is that your name?” I asked. “Brother?” He nodded.
  

  
“I have been alive for a very, very long time. I don’t remember much of my original name. I’ve been on this train, going in circles, for the last three hundred years.” Cook laughed at that. The man regarded him stonily.
  

  
“What is that, a joke?” Cook asked. “You can’t be older than forty or maybe forty-five. You expect us to believe that you’ve been alive for over three hundred years?” The man nodded grimly.
  

  
“Probably more than that, but yes. I have no reason to lie to you. Your opinion matters less to me than the scurryings of a rat. For most of that time, I have had to fight and kill to stay alive. The people from my world live to four or five hundred years. Or, at least, they used to…
  

  
“For, you see, I am hunted. I am an enemy of the Collective Mind,” he said.
  

  
“What is this Collective Mind?” I asked, curious, remembering how the map had said something about them also. It sounded like some sort of beehive or ant colony. I thought of giant bees flying around in spaceships and repressed an urge to laugh. A small smile crossed my face, but Brother did not return it. His blue eyes regarded me without emotion, as blank and emotionless as the eyes of a mannequin.
  

  
“The Collective Mind is a species of beings who evolved in extreme conditions. Their world revolves around a black hole, and the life there hides deep under the ground in the blackness and slime. But over millions of years, they developed technology and spaceflight. They developed miracles, but only for themselves. 
  

  
“For the beings of the Collective Mind do not have any advanced sense of individuality, but, instead, they mostly exist as a collective consciousness, a hivemind. All of them are part machine and part life, hideous, hunchbacked, scurrying things about the size of a man that are horrible to look at. They have many blades strapped on their insectoid bodies and many eyes that see in all directions at once. You would have to see them for yourselves. I could not describe the horror of encountering the hunters of the Collective Mind.
  

  
“The agents of the Collective Mind find other species repulsive, inherently disgusting. They feel towards extraterrestrial life the same way you might feel if you had an invasion of stinkbugs in your house or a horde of bedbugs in your bedroom. They consider all lifeforms not their own to be far beneath them. They would use you for dissection and torture. They would take apart all the parts of your body to find out how it works, then they would find out what world you came from and go there. Then the horrors would really begin.
  

  
“For the agents of the Collective Mind have many toys at their disposal. Their investigation of alien life has given them some truly foul weapons. I saw it on my own planet.” His eyes turned hard at this. “I am the only survivor of a world that once held nearly thirty billion souls.
  

  
“The agents of the Collective Mind come to your planet and abduct men, women and children. They subject them to the worst kind of torture, developing rabid biological weapons, superflus that cause people to bleed from their eyes, nose, mouths and ears or skittering, monstrous creatures that burrow into the human body to lay their eggs.” He shuddered slightly. He closed his eyes for a long moment, breathing hard, as if trying to dispel some horrible memory.
  

  
“That was how my planet died. I saw my own mother and father ripped apart by some red, insectile monstrosity with giant black eyes. The larvae eat them alive from the inside, consuming their vital organs last, so as to keep them alive the longest. And they were conscious and awake until the end. It got so bad that I had to put a bullet in the heads of my own mother and father, simply to end their agony and terror. I killed both of them. I did it. I had to.”
  

  
“Well, we’re not going to run into these creatures, are we?” I asked. “I mean, we want to get back home.” Cook nodded.
  

  
“This train does run in a circuit, right? It will return to the Market Street Station soon, right?” Cook asked, his face gleaming with hope. I knew Cook had quite a monkey in his back. He was a very heavy drinker, and when he didn’t drink, he tended to get shaky and anxious. I figured this would be a very difficult trip for him. I felt a sense of relief that I had never gotten addicted to drugs or alcohol. Though, realistically, if we both got ripped apart by some nightmarish demons or sadistic alien species, it wouldn’t matter very much.
  

  
“Soon…” Brother repeated, drawing out the word as if tasting it. “I have no concept of time on this cursed train. I cannot say. We pass through many suns and many worlds.” His words reminded me of the watch I wore on my wrist, an expensive brand given me to my father after my college graduation. I looked down at its thin hands, deciding to check the time.
  

  
But the hands just spun in random circles. The hour hand had started spinning around backwards, while the second hand had frozen at the “7”. The minute hand just twitched backwards and forwards in half-circles, tracing the bottom half of the clock like a ticking pendulum. I swore under my breath, pulling out my phone.
  

  
The screen had gone entirely black, despite the fact that I had just charged it a few hours earlier. No matter what I tried, I couldn’t get any response from the phone. I wondered if some kind of strange magnetism was affecting electronic devices inside the train.
  

  
“It’s not a good idea to stay in one place for too long,” Brother said abruptly. He walked towards us. Beneath us, the train hummed along its metal tracks, though whether those tracks had their roots on Earth or in some strange black hole world, I didn’t know. 
  

  
Suddenly, the flesh on the sides of the train began pulling apart, dilating like a pupil. Underneath, I saw rectangular windows. They were streaked in red slime and black fluid, but I could still see outside. I gasped as I took in the horror of the scene.
  

  
We were not in the city anymore. We weren’t even on Earth.
  

  
Outside, I saw bogs with black, swampy water. Rounded growths of red mold jutted up in great spheres. Patches of ragged stones stabbed through the fetid water like giant daggers pointed upwards at the sky. On the rocks, I saw giant, centipede-like creatures with glowing white eyes. They looked about the size of a Great Dane. Their black, shining heads turned towards the train as it roared past, their eyes reflecting the pale effulgence from the sky like dull headlights.
  

  
In the cloudless black sky above, I saw many rings circling the planet, like the sharp, flat rings of Saturn. They extended far out into dark space, eventually becoming so faint they simply disappeared from view. The stars twinkled all around them like tiny chips of diamond. Two pale, white moons looked down like cataract-stricken eyes. I quickly turned back away from the horrible sight.
  

  
“These are the Boglands,” Brother said, herding us toward the door at the back of the train.
  

  
“Why do we need to keep moving?” Cook asked. I saw his fingers trembling slightly. I wondered if he was just nervous, or if it was the first creeping signs of alcohol withdrawal.
  

  
“We are not the only ones in this train,” Brother responded, glancing back over his shoulder. He always kept his finger on the trigger of the strange rifle he carried, seemingly ready at any moment to begin shooting. “There are far worse things than us.” We had reached the back of the train. Brother pushed a small, round button labeled “Automatic Open”. A door covered in a spiderweb of black veins stood there. It slid open. As the black veins lost their substrate, they evaporated into a fine dust before dissipating into the air.
  

  
A gurgling, hissing voice filled every carriage up and down the seemingly infinite train. It spoke in some unknown alien tongue, then finally in English.
  

  
“Next stop: The Boglands. Passengers must disembark for twelve hours while the train regenerates its power,” it hissed in a slow, demonic voice. Brother swore as the train’s wheels shrieked. It started to decelerate. I looked up at Brother in panic.
  

  
“Are they serious?” I asked. “We have to get out for twelve hours in this wasteland?” Brother nodded, sighing.
  

  
“This is bad,” he said. “Dead things crawl out of the Boglands at night. I doubt we will have an easy time of it.” With a steely glint in his eyes, he gripped the rifle tightly to his chest, ready for whatever would come.

And though I would inevitably survive and leave that foul train, I would have many scars and remember this moment as the last bit of peace I would ever have.
