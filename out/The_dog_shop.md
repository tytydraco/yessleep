For about 3 months I worked at this dog shelter. It’s hard to find in fact it’s out in the middle of a desert. Outside of a major city. But despite this it has been visited very frequently by many people. Mostly rich and secretive members of society.  
  
I started working there after my son Lucas disappeared. For some weird reason I felt as if this would help me move on. Although the pay was good. I always felt uncomfortable working there. Because something was off about the dogs.  
  
they look weird, they are often bigger than normal. And kind of ugly to look at. But even stranger is that they didn’t seem to behave like dogs normally do. almost as if they were putting on an act to appear as K9.  
  
But despite this they were often bought by some wealthy clients. But regardless I didn't question this because my gut told me not to. And for about 2 months I just ignored the surreal nature of this job.  
  
But then a new dog came in. when I first saw him. I felt a sense of familiarity. Despite never seeing a dog like this. It had blonde hair and blue eyes. It reminded me of my son. And suddenly all these feelings of pain came back to me.  
  
And so, I went into the shelter's bathroom. It was small and cramped and dirty unlike the bathrooms upfront. And after I stopped crying and was about to feed the dogs, I saw the blonde dog outside the door looking at me with tears in his eyes.  
  
I stood there in a daze before regaining my senses and walking away. The dog followed me! I was getting uncomfortable by the dog, so I asked my overseer Tim to deal with the blonde-haired mutt.  
  
Tim agreed so he grabbed his black wooden cane and hit the dog to get it away! I felt a feeling of pain seeing this dog being hit by the black wooden cane, so I told Tim to stop hitting the dog. Tim obliged and the dog walked back towards me.   
  
He followed me and I started to grow a soft spot for the dog. It’s although flawed face often made me feel happy to see him smile at me. And I eventually named this dog Luke! Because of his similarities to Lucas. And over the week I started to take care of Luke as if he was my pet.  
  
But then one day Tim said to me that Luke was being sold to a wealthy client in a few days. I felt a sense of pain upon hearing this news. But I knew he was eventually going to be bought because all of the dogs get bought eventually.   
  
But that night as I was cleaning the floor Luke walked up to me. I thought I locked Luke up, so I was about to put him away. When he started to brokenly moan out a sentence. The sentence was something like “Sarve met!”  
  
 I was taken aback by this because all of the dogs in the shelter never made any noise, not even a bark! But there was Luke telling me something! I was frozen in shock, but I eventually came out of this daze. And I locked Luke up and drove home to my apartment.  
  
The next day I came into the pound. I thought of what had happened the night before and how it affected me. I started to really question what was going on, so I went to ask Tim about it. So, I walked up to Tim’s office. I opened the door a smidge and he was drinking some sort of white liquid.   
  
When I opened the door, I opened a little more. Tim hid the liquid! And asked me “what do you want?” I told time about a dog talking but I didn't tell him which one though. Tim, looking annoyed at that point, said “are you stupid these are normal dogs they can’t speak!”  
  
He then kicked me out of his office. Later that day as i was in the cramped dirty restroom i heard Tim’s voice say, “which one of you spoke!” he sounded in a fury! And then I heard another voice, this one far more scared and raspier I think it said “Luces Wes mitting form cadge!”   
  
Then I heard Tim’s voice. A normally calm and collected man started screaming and then I heard the sound of Luke crying and something being hit by what I think is Tims black wooden cane!  Before the crying stopped. Tim said “Next Time you break the rules remember there are worse things to be than a dog Lucas!  
  
After that I was starting to no longer respect Tim as I used to. In fact, I was disgusted to work with him! But I knew that something was going on at this shelter, so I had to find out what! So, one night as Tim was leaving, I followed his black van! On where he goes after work.  
  
I saw him drive into a ghetto neighborhood close to my apartment! I tried to stay as unnoticed as I could. I saw where he stopped! It was an ally way. I got out of my car and silently followed him! I saw him walk up to a door! He walked inside. I knew that there was something in there.  
  
So, I waited for the coast to clear and walked up to it. It was locked but I saw a crowbar, so I broke the lock! When I was in, I crept around trying to see where Time went. I found the room! It had a door with a peephole. I looked through it.  
  
What I saw could only be described as vile and sickening! I saw Tim take a young girl, chained her up to a table and refigure her body into a dog's body! She was crying and screaming well Tim did this!  
  
I ran out of that building and drove away! But then I started to think about something. Something that made me sick to my core! A realization that ruined me. What if the blonde-haired blue-eyed dog was my son!  
  
To say I was livid would be an understatement! Because I was going to rip Tim’s throat out! So, without hesitation I drove straight to the shelter, and it was almost sunrise when I got there. I ran in there and straight to where Luke’s Cage was.  
  
Unfortunately, he was gone! I was too late, I thought. Luke was sold! And then I felt a hard wooden object hit my head knocking me out! I don’t know how long I was out but when I awoke. I was chained to the floor and Tim was standing over me!  
  
I shouted at him, calling a sort of profanity! But he seemed indifferent. He told me “You sound like you have left things alone and maybe this wouldn’t be happening.” I asked him what he was going to do.  
  
He bluntly stated to me “I'm getting rid of any potential problems.” I then saw him walk away somewhere behind a metal fence. Soundly I could hear a metal door being opened! I tried to turn my head towards it but could only make out a little bit of what was inside!  
  
Then finally when the metal door was completely open. I saw what appeared to be a man that walked on stubs and had its hands replaced with knifes with a head sculpted to look like a dog! were it and there was a shock collar around its neck.   
  
And then I heard Tim say to the beast “kill it!” Without hesitation the creature lashed at my leg's knife claws and made deep wounds. But this proved to be a blessing in disguise because it broke the hard steel chain as well.   
  
So, I moved my right leg towards the beast hitting its eye with the broken chain! Although it hurt at least it gave me some time to react! I stood up as a shot of pain bolted through me! And tried to pull my arms chains off.  
  
Luckily, they were rusty, so it was easier than I thought. But the beast lunged at me, almost ending me there! But I nearly dogged it. As its head was stuck in the metal fence, I wrapped my chain around its neck, and I started to choke it!   
  
After a few moments I had killed the beast! Tim came back now with a gun. He told me “This is it!” He shot me in the stomach! But luckily, I did not die. Instead, I wiped my broken chain around my arm.  
  
And he fell down in pain. I made my way towards my car when I passed though I saw Luke waiting in his cage! I walked up to him, and he started to smile. God, I love that smile! But I could hear Tim footsteps coming!  
  
I had to think of a plan and fast. I came up with an idea! I opened up as many cages as I could, and I asked the dogs “do you want to escape?” they all said what sounded like a yes! I then told them all to wait for my signal to attack Tim!  
  
When Tim came, he was holding his cane and his gun! He walked up to me and said “I'm sorry to do this to you!” I then said “Now!’ suddenly all of the dogs attacked Tim as he screamed at them “stop!” before they then started to rip off his limbs!  
  
I got out of there and took Luke with me to my car! As we were driving, I saw another car drive past us. That must have been the man who tried to buy my son Lucas! And now it has been a few days after this incident.  
  
And currently I have moved far away from where I live. I have been actively lying to people that Lucas is a real dog! because even though Tim is dead, I know that some of his clients are angry at me. And since they are pretty high up on the social ladder, I can’t tell anyone about what I have done. But luckily because of the anonymity of the internet! I finally could express what went down last week!
