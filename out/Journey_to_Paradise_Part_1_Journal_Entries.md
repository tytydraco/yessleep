Today our company set foot outside the city limits and into the vastness of Purgatory beyond. Our caravan consists of twelve modified steam carriages made to roll along the endless railway to the east, and there are one hundred and forty-four souls aboard our expedition to Paradise. We rode from the break of day this morning until dusk and made camp not far from the tracks, where I dwell now in my tent writing in this journal. If by the grace of God you are reading this book from beyond the endless plain, allow me to tell you of our plight in short. 

Ten years ago, we, the residents of Vertrieben, Saxony awoke to find all land outside the bounds of town replaced by an unending meadow, flat with greenish-gold grass growing short and even all around, and inhabited by a great number of peculiar forms of life. Many have tried to escape before us, but they all return reporting no sign of distant change in landscape. And for a time it seemed all hope of finding the truth of this place was lost. 

But then, one year following the beginning of our tribulations, the Prophet arose whom no one knew. He revealed much that was hidden, and from his mouth issued such as the words of Moses and Elijah themselves. And I, Klein Hauptmann, bore witness to him. He told me of my secret maladies which none but I and the Lord above know, and many others attest to his knowledge.

He spoke to us saying that he was a messenger of the Archangel Gabriel, and that this new world was indeed the Purgatory of God. He told us that our town had been brought here for testing by fire, and that our purpose here is to escape, and so find Paradise and rest eternal. And so here we are now, a multitude of men, women, and children rolling across the plain with ninety days worth of provisions as well as provisions for gathering food from the land.

As of this night we have rode for four days along the track from Vertrieben. Thankfully, we have been blessed with an abundance of Land Clams and False Antelope to eat, allowing us to extend our food reserves past what we previously believed to be our limit. Unlike many in our company, I am not terribly fond of the taste of these beasts. They taste to me almost like bitter plants and smell of burning machine’s oil when slain. But if it means salvation at the end of the road, I will feast heartily.

As for the land itself we have seen little variation as of yet. There is only the meadow interrupted by regular lines of subtle hills every ten miles like stationary ripples in a pond. The Prophet spoke to us again today. He gave us assurance that the Lord was pleased with our progress and that the goal is not terribly far away.

Today, we encountered the first non-conformity in the landscape. It was first spotted by one of our drivers toward the front of the caravan. Off in the distance, amid the endless grassy fields, was a dark, rectangular silhouette. We sent out one of our scouts who had been prepared for this very kind of encounter to investigate. We saw him run first, then approaching slowly, firmly grasping one end of the thing and pulling firmly, he dislodged what appeared to be a large wooden post from the soil. He promptly returned it to the Prophet, who examined the post, whispered something brief to the scout, and commanded us to move on. 

From what I could see, the identity of the mystery post was unmistakable from its regular cuts and visible nail ends. It was a broken piece of a fence. And not just any fence, but one I personally recognized. It was a part of my neighbor's fence, but somehow out here, hundreds of miles from home. The Steiner family’s style of carpentry was very recognizable even to untrained eyes such as my own. The posts and cross-pieces that composed the fence that surrounded their farm were always markedly straight, clean, and precise, and always made from beech wood. And this post, by all accounts, clearly belonged to them. It seemed impossible and I still don’t know what to make of it. Not even the Prophet seemed to know what it was. 

Nevertheless, until we reach the Gates of Paradise,
