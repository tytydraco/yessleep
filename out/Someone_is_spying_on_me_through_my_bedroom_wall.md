My name is Mike, and 3 months ago I moved to a new apartment. 
          It was a pretty sweet little one bedroom, and rent wasn’t too exorbitant. The only problem with the place was an odd hole in the bedroom wall, about the size of a dime.
          3 days after I moved in, I noticed a glint coming from the hole. I Tensed up when I noticed it, approaching the wall anxiously.
         Sure enough, just beyond where the crappy ceiling light could reach, there was a slight dot of a reflection. I froze for several seconds, and the glint vanished.
         I rushed out of the bedroom, and out the front door to find the side of the building where another tentent shared the wall. 
         Mapping the room out in my head as I went, I found the side of the basement apartment where my wall was. It was an exterior wall, and where the hole should have been was just dirt below me.
     I sat down on the front porch and called my landlord. After a little too long ringing he answered
     “Hey, do you know why there was a small hole in the bedroom wall when I moved in,” I demanded.
      “No, I dont. Probably the guy who lived there before you, but it shouldn’t be too big a deal.”
  I thought for a second what I might’ve seen.
      “Is there any space behind the wall, maybe even big enough for a person” I prodded.
He cut in and out as he cackled. After regaining his composure he answered with a simple no, before promptly hanging up.
       I stopped sleeping in the bedroom after that. I didn’t really think there was someone behind it, but just the thought stopped me from even entering the room.
       After a week of sleeping on the couch, I finally got over it and went back into the bedroom. The hole was just as dark as ever.
       I decided to finally figure out what was behind the hole for certain. I took out my phone and approached the hole. I turned on the flashlight. I dropped the phone immediately. Illuminated by the light was a bloodshot green eye staring right at me.
      I was in true fight or flight, and I chose fight. I lifted my right leg and propelled it into the wall. The heel indented the dry wall, producing a papery cracking sound. The wall didn’t give way as much as I’d hoped. I kicked again and a fist sized hunk of powdery white wall fell to the ground.
      Through the fist sized hole, I finally saw what terror lay behind it. There wasn’t a single inch of space between the wall and the earth behind it. 
      I stared at the wall for a minute considering what to do. I headed straight to a hardware store, and got plaster and paint so could fix the wall and forget about it.
        I thought fixing the wall would be the end of it. The day after I fixed it I got back from my job as a cashier at a grocery store. When I lay down to relax the hole was back. 
        I frantically packed all my belongings, threw them in the car and never set foot in that complex again.
