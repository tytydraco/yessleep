I can hear them non stop….the low whispering coming from inside the walls. They are plotting against me I know they are , but nobody believes me and my husband acts like I am crazy but I’m not crazy ok !! It all started last month when I woke up at 3am to hear the sound of scraping inside my bedroom wall. I sat up and put my head against the wall to try and figure out what the sound was coming from (I assumed it must have been termites chewing at the wall) I grabbed my phone from the nightstand to google exterminators but that’s when I heard it. “We can see you” shivers ran down my spine as I heard those words. I thought it was my husband playing a prank on me as he usually does but then the thing or things called my name over and over again.

My husband was fast asleep so I knew it wasn’t him , I got out of my room and tiptoed downstairs to see if I could hear it in any of the other rooms but it was silent. I came to the realistic conclusion that I was hallucinating the sounds and decided to head back to bed. When I woke up in the morning I told my husband about the events of the other night and we both shared a laugh over it and went about our day. But again that night when I got home I heard the sounds again when I was laying in our shared bedroom reading my novel. I asked my husband if he could hear it but he dismissed me and said it was probably my ‘over active imagination’. The noises continued for weeks after that and they only happen in our bedroom. 

It has been a month and I am seriously considering booking an appointment with a psychiatrist because surely it’s not normal to be hearing strange sounds like this. Something else happened yesterday that is making me doubt that it’s all in my head but I don’t want my husband to think I have gone clinically insane. I had the day off yesterday and I was home alone because my husband was at work , just as I was about to sit down on my bed and check my emails , there was a loud thump on the wall and the sound of heavy breathing. I nearly fell off the bed in pure shock and terror. Our closest neighbour is 6 miles away as we live in the country side. I decided that enough was enough and went out to the garage to grab a hammer.

When I came back , I went to the corner and started banging a small hole in the wall to see if I could see anything in there. I looked inside the penny sized hole and stood frozen. I saw multiple eyes staring straight at me. They looked humanoid but something about them threw me into a state of uneasiness….it was like uncanny valley , it felt like they were pretending to be human. I stepped back from the wall and ran out the room. My husband asked about the wall when he came home and I told him about what I saw.  As you can probably guess he thought I had finally lost my mind , but I asked him to look through the hole expecting him to become freaked out. Instead he turned around with a look of sadness and asked me when my appointment is. 

So now I am sat here on my couch questioning if I could be schizophrenic. It seemed so real though…the voices and the eyes were too life like to be a hallucination. I’m posting this here because I was hoping y’all could advise me on what you think is happening. I will try and update y’all about how my appointment went some time tomorrow. A part of me hope it’s all in my head because I don’t think I can comprehend those things being real…..
