I am 22 years old. A week ago, my life turned upside down. This is my story until now.

When I was 11 years old, my dad and mom built a house. Our life was pretty normal until then, filled with joy and happiness. After one month, we moved into the house, but my dad got cancer. Countless people helped us day and night, both financially and emotionally. After 9 months, my dad survived.

When I was 17, my mom had a heart attack due to diabetes. She didn't experience any pain but fell unconscious. she didn't receive any basic medical treatment for an hour due to various reasons. However, she had an operation, and we were able to save her.

When I was 20, my dad had a bike accident that resulted in small fractures. He couldn't stand or walk for four months, but eventually, he recovered, and life returned to normal.

When I was 21, my mom fell at home and had a small cut under her foot. Due to diabetes, this cut became quite large, and half of her foot turned yellow. We were worried that doctors might have to amputate her foot, but luckily, her leg went back to normal after a small operation.

Until now, we've faced many financial and health-related ups and downs, but my mom and dad never raised me with pain; instead, they provided happiness paid for my laptop and bike. They bought me everything I asked for and paid for my tuition for a bachelor's degree.

This is very things get crazy

I am 22 now, and I have a job, but I haven't onboarded yet. It's far away from my hometown, so my mom and dad decided to send me off in that city and return home. However, tragedy struck as we reached the city. While crossing the road, due to a blind spot, a truck hit all three of us. My father lost his life, and my mother is hospitalized. I escaped with minor injuries. My dad was about to retire in just 1Â½ years, and I was about to live on my own. I had thought that my parents would have the time of their lives after I moved out, but now life has changed drastically.

My dad was on the brink of death 11 years ago, but somehow, he managed to survive long enough to clear the house loan and support me through my education until I could live on my own. However, the situation changed dramatically due to this tragic accident. The city where this incident occurred also has a strange history of causing separation in our family. Five years ago, during a vacation visit, my mom went missing briefly, but I was able to find her. Unfortunately, on our 2nd visits, it completed it's job all of this problem started since the building of our house we lost so many property's and we are on the brink of being broke now my dad was a kinda hearted gentleman always stood by the family and took care of us and never raised me poorly even after all these problems 

I'm scared about what's next in this simulation
