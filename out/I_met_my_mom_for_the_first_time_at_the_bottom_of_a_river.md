They say it’s good to get things off your chest, but I don’t feel it in my chest. It’s on my shoulders, in my head, burrowed in my psyche and wrapped in cement. I have nothing to gain sharing this story with anybody. But it’s become me, so I have nothing to lose.

…

My father used to take me fishing at this river near our house. We even had our own spot. We called it “The Beach.” Short trip through the woods, climb down a few rocks, walk along the bank, and there it was.  It was beautiful. The sun would burst through the sycamore canopy, shedding light on the tea-colored water and little sect of wet sand where we sat.  I loved it.

I think it was the serenity of that environment that allowed me to think about Mom. She’d been gone since I could remember. On the particular day I’d like to detail, I was eleven; up to that point and since I’ve never received a proper explanation of her disappearance from my father. When I would acknowledge her existence, sometimes he would gently shrug it off, other times I noticed him grimace or recoil. He’d try to hide it but there was a visceral pain he carried from her absence. I tried to abide by his unwritten, unspoken rule, pretending her lack of presence wasn’t a tangible shadow that enveloped our lives and relationship.

My father was hitting the double digits in Yuenglings drank as we sat by the water. I was sipping my root beer, so completely content, without care or concern, and allowed my mind to wander, settling wherever it may. Of course, it settled on her. And in that moment, I had no filter, the divide between my conscious and subconscious blurred. I broke the rule.

I asked him what happened. He turned to me, just looking. “With Mom,” I said, my contentment giving way to confidence. Seconds ticked, and he just stared, expressionless. Normally, we would have pivoted to another subject, one of us maneuvering to a more agreeable topic of conversation. But I felt empowered and pressed. “You never told me.”

His mouth broke, twitching into a wistful smile. “Told you what, exactly?” He knew what I meant.

“Why she left.”

The smile faded and his head dropped. He might have been fighting back anger, or maybe he was just sad and drunk. Either way, when he lifted his head, his eyes were red, likely due in part to the drinking, but also because he was blinking away some emotion. He tilted his bottle back and drank until it was empty. “Your father’s an idiot, son.” His eyes returned to mine. “I fucked up.”

And that was all the explanation I got. I had more questions, but didn’t ask them. As always. There was some relief in hearing she had a reason to leave, even though I’d been told before. There was a particular comfort being reminded that something had happened; that she wasn’t some nomad who didn’t care about her son.

Instead of ruining the day further, I took the exchange as a minor victory and dropped the inquisition.

Minutes passed before my father asked if I’d be alright if he ran home to grab something. I figured he was referring to beer, his present 12-pack emptied, and felt bad having triggered him to self-medicate. My only reply was, “Sure.” He went, leaving me to my own devices.

A bird sang to nobody in particular and I imagined it was singing to me, telling a story, some fairytale, *“Once upon a time…”* I listened, sat back and closed my eyes, relaxing in the warm breeze. I began to feel sleepy and welcomed the drowse, about to enjoy the final moment of peace I would and ever will hope to experience.

…

A hand touched my cheek, fingertips then palm. The caress was soft, warm, impossibly familiar. I stirred, placing my hand on hers. She took it, giving it a tight and sudden squeeze.

My eyes sprang open. As they adjusted, I thought I may still be dreaming. I could still feel her, as though her hand really was in mine. I didn’t want to let go, so I didn’t. I held on to her and she held on to me, for how long I couldn’t be sure. It was enough time for me to realize I was very much awake. A chill struck my spine.

I turned to regard her. My mother. There she was, radiant, dressed in a pink, silk nightgown and flowery-white robe as if fresh out of bed.

“Breathe, sweetheart, you’re turning blue.” Her soothing tone gave me goosebumps. “Breathe.” I couldn’t, frozen by the sight of an angel. “It’s okay.” She drew in closer, calm and careful with steady grace. I lost feeling in my extremities as my eyes followed hers. She leaned closer, and closer. I think I was quaking, or maybe the world was collapsing. Before I had time to pass out, she pulled me into her. “It’s okay…”

We embraced. I was crying and she let me.

Eventually, I lifted my head and tried to speak, stammering my way through something unintelligible. She smiled sweetly. “I know, baby…” She placed her hand on the back of my neck and pulled me into her breast. She began stroking my hair in a moment I would give anything to have back. “Where’s your father?”

I’d been so shocked by my mother’s appearance I’d forgotten I had a father, that he’d gone to get beer, and that he would be back any minute. I relayed this information. My mother’s smile diminished for a moment as she glanced in the direction of our home. She turned back to me and the smile restored, grew more intense. Her hazel eyes were suddenly alight with urgency. “I love you, baby.”

“I love you too.” I felt complete.

My mother looked out to the water, and surveyed the picturesque scene for what felt like an hour but surely couldn’t have been. As she did, her lips pursed, and her eyes welled with tears.

“It’s OK, mom.” The only thing I wanted in the world was for her to be happy. Comfortable. With me.

She looked back at me with eyes wide, forcing cheer through her urgent tone. “Would you like to go for a swim?”

If my expression throughout this interaction was already quizzical, it only grew more-so. I replied with dazed honesty: “I don’t know.” And then I recalled, “I don’t think I can swim.”

“Well that’s silly. Why would he bring you to the water and not teach you to swim?” She let the question linger. I had no response. “Don’t worry…” She turned her head side-to-side as if searching for an exit in a burning building; she was worried. She craned her head again to scan the area behind us, searching for what I now assume was my father. “Let’s go.” And she began to march toward the riverbank.

…

Her grip was firm on my wrist. I walked for a period as she did, toward the water, unsure of her intent. My eyes darted back and forth from the river to my mother, rinse and repeat. “Mom?” She either ignored or didn’t hear me. “Mom.” No response. “Mom!”

I was ankle deep now, my mother a little less. She didn’t relent, my cries falling on deaf ears. Each step was just a bit deeper; I began to pull away from her. Her grip tightened, like restraints on a resisting criminal.

Thigh deep. I began to panic. She was hurting me. “Mom! Stop!” I began crying out for my father. Where was he? Who was this woman, just moments ago so tender and loving, hurting me? As my waist submerged, I went limp. Her grip was a vice, pulling me no matter my action. I shouted and wailed until my voice broke, and before I knew it I was beneath the murk.

It was chaos. I could no longer feel my wrist, it’d gone numb. My shoulder was strained from my struggle, close to coming out of its socket. My eyes were closed, my feet kicking, free arm striking, scratching, clawing at my mother, attempting any and everything that could free me from her grasp. The woman I dreamt about since I could remember was drowning me. The one person who, in my eyes, embodied hope and beauty on earth was dragging me to my end.

My mother was trying to kill me.

She pulled me downward until we reached the riverbed, my feet finally contacting something solid. Submerged earth. I kicked off hard as I could, my muffled screams swallowed by the muddy river. She pulled me back down with force. I kicked again, this time into something that felt like a bundle of sticks, scratching my leg and catching my foot. It weighed me down, and was cutting into me as I tried to shake free. I couldn’t feel the pain I’m sure it inflicted, as panic and adrenaline consumed me. I was out of oxygen and in moments I would inhale the river, bringing about the end both my life and terror.

And then her grip softened. Now, I was being pulled upward, more gently than I’d been pulled down. The bundle of sticks, still caught on my foot and tugging, scratching my shins, weighed me down. But the angel’s strength overcame it. I was being saved. The revelation gave me strength. I was able to fight my failing lungs as my body calmed and I could see the rippling light of the river’s surface growing closer, brighter. And as we were about to reach it, and I would finally breathe in the fresh air, precious and tantalizing…

She let go. There was no longer any grip. I began to sink. I swung my head side to side looking for her. Even in the dark I could tell here was no her. She abandoned me. Again. My strength was gone, the panic resumed. I waved my arms frantically and tried to scream, although no sound emitted. My chest was on fire, my lungs molten inside me. I couldn’t fight it anymore. I inhaled.

The water rushed in. I don’t remember what I could feel at that point. I wonder if I felt anything. I wonder if I saw heaven. I wonder if I saw her, and if she apologized.

I wonder if I asked her why.

…

When I came to, I was looking at the face of my father. The anguish of his expression, the sheer desperation, is seared into my memory. I couldn’t hear him, but I knew he was shouting my name. Telling me to wake up. Pleading for me to come back to him.

I coughed the rest of the river that was inside me out. I breathed in deeply and felt the greatest relief I’ve ever felt. Even with the headache, the chest pain, my leg…

My leg. I tried to lift my head and look at it, but I was weak. Gradually I could hear my father’s voice again. He was thanking god. He was saying he loved me. He pulled me into an embrace and I wanted to embrace him back. I would when I could lift my arms.

When he let me go and gently laid me back down, I noticed that my leg, with whatever it caught on, was still submerged beneath the shallow water of the riverbank. I could feel the sticks still on me, some of their sharp ends maintaining that persistent scratch. He placed me prone, carefully resting my head on his hand when he did, a makeshift pillow against the rocky sand. “What hurts? Can you stand?”

I shook my head as much as I could manage. “No.” It hurt to speak. “I want to go home.”

“Hospital first, buddy.”

My father rose to his feet, and then dipped back down to scoop me up. I felt like an infant, incapable, in need of my parents for physical support, and the recognition of that feeling jarred into my awareness what had just transpired. I could see her image, vivid and affecting, in my mind’s eye.

He lifted me, and the pain from the scratching could once again be felt. I winced, as the bundle of sticks tugged. My lower half rose from the water, and what I saw, what had attached itself to my leg and sunk me toward the riverbed after my mother released me, was not at all a bundle of sticks. It had sharp elements, my foot had indeed been entangled in it, and it had scratched and cut up my leg… but it was not a bundle of sticks.

It was the remains of a skeleton. Clothed in the tattered, disintegrating remains of a pink nightgown and flowery-white robe.

I passed out.

…

When I awoke in the hospital I was told I had waded into the river while my father was away and he saved me from drowning. I knew half of that was true. The truth of the other half has haunted me from that day through the day that I write this. There were many times I wanted to speak that truth to the doctors, the school counselors, the friends, the therapists, the lovers.

There were times I wanted to speak that truth to my father. But I never did. It was acknowledged in glimmers I could see in his eyes. He was never the same after that day. He apologized for leaving me, promised me he would never leave my side again, but other than that, we never spoke of it. It became another unwritten, unspoken rule. And this one I never broke.

At times I doubted the experience. Perhaps I was traumatized and invented a fiction to cope. Perhaps mid-nap, I sleepwalked into the river. Perhaps it is the case that there is some other explanation for what happened rooted in something more realistic, more grounded in physical possibility, than, as I understand it, my mother’s ghost dragging me to her grave to reveal her true fate to me. Perhaps.

But I’m not convinced. I believe my mother. I believe my own perception. When the doctor asked about the wounds on my leg, my father said it got stuck in a rock formation while he carried me from The Beach to the car after the rescue, and in his panic to get me to the hospital, he was careless in getting me out of it.

I know that happened in the water. Not a rock formation.

When I suggested I learn to swim so that such an event never repeat, he said, “You crazy, son? I’m not letting you near a body of water ever again,” and laughed it off like it was a joke.

What sort of parent wouldn’t prioritize teaching their kid to swim after they nearly drown to death?

Sometime after that day, I looked my mother up on the internet. I’d never thought to before–I had her pictures, a journal of hers, anecdotes from a few family members. But for my own sanity after the day we met, I had to. What I found was that, when I was little, she had disappeared. Gone from the face of the earth. Police investigated and my father was interviewed. He told them they’d been growing apart and he wasn’t surprised she’d left. They suspected foul play. There were no signs of struggle in the house, no blood, nothing broken, no evidence of a physical dispute. There were searches, APBs, rewards offered for information from members of the family, both her own and my father’s. Today, the investigation of her disappearance stands as a cold case.

I don’t need to connect the dots for you. I don’t care if you believe me. While the details will likely remain a mystery until the end of time, I feel confident in my understanding of what happened to my mother. My only regret is that I never had the courage to accuse my father of murder to his face.

He died last week. 62. His liver failed him, spurred almost certainly by his chronic alcohol abuse.

My belief of what he did to her explains so much. The subtle glances, the guilty avoidance, the complete refusal to acknowledge her. It also disturbs me when I contemplate his activity. Getting drunk at the very place hid her. Bringing her son there. Living every day with the secret of secrets, playing pretend like he was as human as the rest of us. A secret he kept awfully well.

It isn’t that I have doubt in regards to what happened. If anything, I carry guilt about it. Why did I–do I–lack the strength to speak up? Even if I’m deemed ridiculous, or traumatized, emotional or crazy. Why do I do her the injustice of remaining silent?

I guess that’s the reason I write this. And I guess it’s the reason I’m going to return. To find her and bring her home. To hold her, whatever’s left of her, one more time.

…

I park the car. Short trip through the woods, climb down a few rocks, walk along the bank, and there it is.  It’s beautiful. The sun is bursting through the sycamore canopy, shedding light on the tea-colored water and little sect of wet sand where we sat.

I set down the beat up beach chair I lugged along with me. I sit.

*Shit*, I think to myself. *I forgot the root beer*.

I shrug it off and try to focus. I relax my shoulders. I listen, waiting for the bird to sing to me, to tell me a story, “Once upon a time…” The bird never sings. I let the warm breeze wash over me, and to my surprise, I do calm. I await the sleepiness, but it never comes.

*Please*.

I want to feel her hand on my cheek. I want to place mine on hers, to hear her say *"I love you, baby..."* I wait, patient. I have all the time in the world.

There is no touch. I open my eyes. She isn’t there.

“That’s OK. I’ll come to you.” The breeze carries my voice over the river, and I know she can hear it.

I rise and clear my throat. I want to cry, but there’s time for that later. I approach the riverbank, and walk steadily. Ankle deep. Thigh deep.

I smile. It’s funny to me, thinking back on the terror I felt when I first entered these waters. And now I feel only love.

I pause, uttering a soft thank you to my mother, for revealing herself to me when she just as easily could have rested, remained silent, and hid the truth as I did.

Her strength becomes mine as I continue, wading deeper towards her, into the murk.
