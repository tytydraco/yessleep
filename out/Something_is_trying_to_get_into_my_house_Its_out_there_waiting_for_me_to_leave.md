I woke up around 1:00 A.M. a week ago, groggy and disoriented, to prepare for my usual night shift. I noticed that my cat, Brunch, who typically sleeps at the foot of my bed, had left in the middle of the night.This wasn’t unusual; but the door to my room was closed, with no other way out.  
Puzzled, I quickly searched the room, but after being unable to find him, I figured my older sister had whisked the poor cat away to her room. “No big deal”, I thought.

I finished preparing and was ready to head out. But just as I reached for the doorknob, I heard a soft hiss coming from my room. I marched back in, now convinced Brunch was just hiding somewhere out of sight. Peering under the bed I discovered Brunch, huddled at the far end of the bed behind an assortment of shoeboxes. His fur was stood on end; I had never seen him behave like this before. After calling out to him for a few minutes, trying to gently coax him out to no avail, I worried that something was terribly wrong with Brunch.

I made an awkward attempt to crawl under the bed and try pulling him out. While I was not particularly fond of cats, Brunch had always been a quiet and gentle companion to me since my childhood. He had never scratched me; or anyone else for that matter.

Yet for the first time, as I reached out to him, he let out a deep, guttural hiss, and slashed my arm, leaving a deep gash.  Shocked, I retreated from under the bed. I was bleeding a lot more than I would have expected. With a mix of frustration from the sudden violence, and panic at the sight of blood all over my arm and clothes, I realized I probably wasn’t going to make it to work on time. I hurriedly messaged my boss, letting them know I would be late, before tending my wound, cleaning myself up, and getting changed. Brunch was still hiding under the bed, and just as I was about to try coaxing him out again, I heard a knock on the front door.

“What the hell? Who knocks on people’s doors at two in the morning?” I muttered to myself, perplexed and slightly unnerved.

I stepped into the hallway, moving cautiously towards the door. Through the frosted window I could see a somewhat familiar figure standing there, eerily motionless. My heart pounded as I slowly approached. That’s when I heard a voice.

“Hey. It’s me. Let me in”.

The voice, in the dead of night, sent shivers down my spine; but the most chilling part was the familiarity of the voice itself. It was *MY* voice. The figure on the other side of the door was unmistakably *me*.

“Hey. It’s me. *Let me in*.” It repeated firmly, now knocking more insistently.

Fear set in as I realized that any of my family members would have fallen for this; I was supposed to have left for work by now. Trembling, I began to back away from the door. The figure inched closer, attempting to peer through the frosted window. As it did, I could begin to discern the blurry details on its – on *my* face.  


Our eyes locked, and for a brief moment, it seemed surprised. But then it *smiled*.  
The most sinister, unnerving smile. A smile that I would never make.

  
In that bone-chilling moment, it silently backed away from the door and vanished into the night. Needless to say, I never made it to work that night, or any night since. My family thinks I’m crazy for locking myself away in my room; telling me it was just some sort of prank.

But since that day, every sleepless night I’ve had listening to my cat hiss from under the bed convinces me otherwise.
