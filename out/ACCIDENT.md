It was dark, and we didn't see it, but we felt an impact as our car sped through the road. "Shit, I think we hit something," Caleb said in an anxious voice. I turned on the headlights brighter than they were before. It was a girl, and she seemed really badly injured. "Fuck, she might be dead," Ronald said, looking disturbed. "Let's run away. What'll happen to us if they find out?" We didn't know where we were. It was dark outside, and drunk and rushed with adrenaline, we didn't know better. We left her there, not looking back.  
  
In the morning, after we were sober again, it was hell. We realized what we had done, and after blaming and swearing at each other, Ronald sat down, scanning the newspapers if anything had come up in the news. Caleb and I wanted to go check on the girl, but we didn't really know where we were driving that night. We ended up finding this random road which led us to a road we were familiar with. It was too dark outside, and we didn't bother to check. We waited for a few days, anxious about any news about accidents. However, there was nothing on the news.  
  
Years passed, my friends moved on, but I still think about it. I still remember her lifeless body draped in blood. However, from a stroke of luck, nothing had happened to us, and we were free to roam. Life was going well for us. I was about to marry my fiancée, whom I had been dating for the past year. My friends had also found good jobs and loving partners. We couldn't ask for more.  
  
Today, I had a date with my fiancée. It was originally supposed to be a get-together with my friends and their partners. However, they pulled out at the last moment. Not that it bothered me; I could finally get some alone time with her. I pulled into a parking lot and tried locating her. "Umm, white top, white top... There she is," I exclaimed, looking at her waving excitedly. We shared a hug as we came closer. "Did you hit your truck anywhere, Lea?" I said, noticing the slight bump on her truck. "Oh yeah, I hit a few things while coming here" she said, hopping in the truck, "Umm you want help getting them fixed?” i asked her looking a little concerned, “Don't worry we can fix it later, I don't want to ruin the date "she said. I sat inside the car as instructed ,the car had a nice scent ,Lea usually wasn't really the person to use an air freshener inside a car , it seemed she had put a lot of effort into this date.  
  
We drove along, blasting music. We usually had trips away from the hustle and bustle of the main city. This time, she chose this vast desert. It was in the evening, and the atmosphere had started to cool down .Suddenly ,the car stopped. "What happened, Lea?" I said. "I don't know. Try starting it. I think we're low on power... You'll have to get out and push the car." I had never seen her like this. It looked like she was trying to hold something in. "Umm, Lea, are you okay?" "Oh yeah, I'm fine... Just remembered an old joke." I left the car and started to push. It was dark, and the night had already settled in. As I was pushing, I felt my hands get a little wet. "Hmm, water?" I mumbled to myself. The car suddenly started, and Lea sped off. I was confused about what she was doing. I saw the lights of the car becoming smaller and smaller. My phone was left in the car. If this was a prank, it was a really bad one. Plus, my hands were wet just adding to the discomfort.  
Suddenly, I saw a car coming back, and I recognized it. It was Lea's. "Haha, she's always had that little playful side," I said to myself, although this was one of the jokes that had made me the most anxious. As the headlights shined, I noticed my hands were red, blood-covered all over them. I looked on top. The floodlights suddenly became dim. I couldn't notice much of her face, but I could see her smiling, those white teeth etched in my vision as I went flying off the road. I tried to get up, but the car pushed me again and again. All the while, I could hear her howling and laughing with pleasure. It was her. I remembered now. I also remembered the place. It was the same place where we had hit the girl years back. No wonder it seemed similar.  
  
I decided to lay low because if I didn't, they would hit me again. I don't think I could've taken another blow. She opened the dickey, and it revealed the bodies of three men. I couldn't see their faces properly, but I knew who they were. I ran for the hell of it and hid. I could hear her screaming furiously, but I managed to escape, and I'm writing this as I'm hidden. If any stranger ever finds this diary in the future, please, please report to the po-  
  
Just dealt with the last one :)
