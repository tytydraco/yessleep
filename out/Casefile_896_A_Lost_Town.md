*The following is a direct transcript of a recording found in an abandoned house. The town it was found in was evacuated in the 1920’s due to the war.*

If you find this recording please leave the town immediately and do not remain there for a prolonged period of time. I will explain this in detail but you need to leave now and if its in your power to do so, I beg you build a fence around this cursed place in hopes that no one tries to enter the place.

My name is Pierre, I came to this town as a surveyor and explorer. My work is to find such places and document them. This particular town I found my actual mistake as it was on the way to another location, I wish I did not remain here. Who I am is not important but what is in this place is, I am not a religious man but here I wish I was.

There is a ruined chapel in the middle of the town that looked like it was torn down by someone, the houses were abandoned and most if them looked like the people had just gotten up and left. Even though it was recorded to be evacuated there are no further official records according to the town documents I found in the post office. There are no more than 25 houses from what I counted which made me curios. There is no other official building here but wanted to check and confirm anyway.

It was getting late here so I decided to camp out in a yard nearer to the post office, I do this work alone as I find it more efficient. It was about 8pm that I heard the sounds, at first I thought it might be some animal who was sniffing around my tent looking for food but when I checked there was nothing. I tried to look around but there was nothing of interest, I ate my dinner and tried to get some sleep but the noise persisted and I decided to look again.

Outside the night was still and I could not hear anything but the sound what kept coming back forced me to exit my tent, I became frustrated by this and began to walk around. As I was looking around I saw a faint glow coming from the ruined chapel, thinking that there could be another camper nearby I made my way there to see. At the ruined chapel I again found nothing but the light was coming from the cellar opening, I was against going down but at this point I knew I needed to check.

I armed my self with a stick I found nearby and made my way down, in the cellar I saw a large room lined with candles and the fear in my stomach rose and I tried to retreat immediately by found that the way out was blocked by fallen debris. I did not hear the debris fall so I tried to find another way around, my torch began to flicker and I had to hit it with my left hand a few times to make it work, the candles were did not give much light so had to rely on my torch.

As I walked around the room I heard a rumbling sound coming from below, it was as if something was moving under my feet. I found a window that lead outside and tried to use to leave, it was at this point the room began to shake and the candles that lined the walls began to fall. I hoisted myself up to exit from the window then I heard the voices, they were coming from outside. What they spoke I do not know, what language again I do not know but whatever was being chanted it was causing the ground to shake so I needed to leave immediately. I managed to crawl half way out and then it felt like the ground was breaking open. I scrambled to move forward and while doing so I then felt something grab my leg and tried to drag me back in.

The pain shot up from my foot and I tried to grab anything around me to help me and found a stone that was sticking out of the ground. Inch by inch I pulled then found another stone and used that as another to help me move faster, the thing holding my leg was strong but fear, it seems, was stronger and managed to get out. Getting up I decided to see what was trying to drag me back in and what I saw froze me. A dark shape that looked like a woman burnt with bright orange eyes looked back at me, she had no lips but I could feel the smile on the long burnt lips. She stared at me and I back to her.

It felt like hours before I could move but what broke the paralysis was a voice in my head saying, “you will not leave now. Your toll will be paid by blood.” I heard howls of wolves coming from everywhere now and the wind also picked up, I ran from there to my camp site. As I was running I could feel like something was running behind me, I began to scream out prayers that I remembered in hopes to protect myself. I was scared beyond measure and as I got to my camp I rushed into the tent and grabbed my bag. I then ran to the nearest house to hide, I was scared and was not thinking.

Inside the house I ran around closing and locking any window in utter fear, outside I could hear the howls and in my head the voice repeating the message over and over. What was this place, after sometime everything stopped and when I checked the time and saw it was 12:01. I sat down on a chair near the door and waited for dawn with another stick as a weapon. I heard footsteps outside the door and a voice of a woman laughing at me, “it is futile Pierre. This house cannot stop me from taking what I am owed, you will pay with your blood.”

This is when I used my recorder to record this message, I do not know how long I have but please heed my sto…

*The recording ends here and nothing else was recovered. Personal belongings were found intact, and house bore signs of an animal attack. We found this place while searching for a lost group of campers. No other information could be found and the place was left as found.*
