Before I get into this story, I just want you to know that this is 100% a true story. All of the events that will be explained did happen. Most of the events were told through the eyes of my mother, who I swear on my life would not lie about something like this. Also, I apologize for any crappy storytelling, as it is not exactly my area of expertise. 

I was just a toddler at the time. Maybe around 18 months old. I was in my room in one of those Fisher-Price baby chairs that you could bounce and spin in. And I was talking...talking to someone (Talking as in blabbering and random baby sounds). When my mom walked in, I was having a conversation with someone, I would talk to the person, and then I would receive what the other person was saying by nodding, or at least giving the closest thing to baby approval. The only thing is...no one was there. My mom thought it was cute, because, frankly, who wouldn't find a blabbering baby cute? She got my attention and asked me who I was talking to (Probably as a joke). I looked at her and giggled, and when I looked back at wherever my attention was before, it was evident to my mother that whatever I was talking to was gone. She could see the utter confusion and surprise on my face. 

Fast forward to a few years later, I'm probably like 3 or 4, and my mom sits down with me and shows me some pictures. We are together looking at these pictures, and then she shows me a picture of a man that she has never shown me or mentioned around me before. And yet...I knew this man. I knew this man because I talked to him. I knew his voice, his face, his name. I pointed at the picture and excitedly shouted "Pop-Pop!" My mom was beyond surprised, and all of a sudden, it made sense to her. She knew who I was talking to those few years back, she knew and she remembered the moment because she knew something was fishy about that day. 

Let me explain: The man that I was shown a picture of and allegedly had a conversation with was my grandfather. He passed away from a fatal heart attack a few years before I was born, and it pains my heart that I was never able to actually get to know him outside of these alleged events that happened before I had any real long-term memory. My mom would always re-tell this experience, and I would always find it kind of creepy, but honestly it just always seemed like a big fat coincidence. I mean, when I was having that "Conversation", I was probably just doing stupid infant things, and me calling the picture of my grandfather "Pop-Pop" was probably just me coming up with a name that people usually call old people. It seemed like my mom was just being paranoid. I always found the story a bit uncanny, but it never really made me believe in any of that paranormal crap. That is, until a few years ago.

I'm sure everybody has looked up their name to see what is about you on the internet at least once, right? Well, I suddenly got curious and decided to look my name up to see what I could find. This then led me to look up my mother's name, then my grandma's name, until I ended up in this little rabbit hole of this family member and that family member until I ended up at an obituary article about my Grandfather, which was posted about 2-3 years before I was born. I learned some things about him that I never knew, like how he was a Cub Scout Den Chief, which made me pretty happy as an Eagle Scout. But what shocked me most of all (Shocked being an understatement), was his nickname. Obviously I will not reveal my Grandfather's name for privacy reasons, but at the top of the article, in fine digital print, presented his name as "Firstname 'Pop-Pop' Lastname". My mind was ***blown.*** *His nickname was Pop-Pop!* I couldn't believe it. All those years ago, me calling my Grandfather "Pop-Pop" was not a coincidence. It was his own nickname. And how would I have known that if my mom showing me a picture of him was my first time seeing him? 

This experience frightened me to the core, because while you can always watch scary ghost videos on Youtube or listen to scary ghost stories, having a personal paranormal experience to where you have no doubt in your mind that the event that you have experienced are 100% true is scarier than any horror movie. While the experience wasn't scary at all, and kind of wholesome in a way, because I got to meet my Grandfather after all, the fact that I have personal proof that the paranormal is real kinda scares the crap out of me. I guess we really aren't alone after all.
