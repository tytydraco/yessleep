I don’t even know how to start this, or what to think.

For context, me and my best friend Sarah have been best friends for around 3 years. We met on an online chat site, and we kind of just clicked after that. 

2 weeks ago, Sarah texted me saying that she met a guy on Reddit named Sam. She said that they had the same interests, dislikes, and hobbies. I was happy for her; she had always complained about how she struggled to make friends, even online. I was her only friend so I saw this as something very beneficial for her, and an opportunity for her to socialize with him and express herself.

In the days that followed, I and Sarah continued texting each other normally.
However, each time she would always bring up Sam in the middle of our conversation. I grew tired of her constant “Sam is so fun to speak to” or “Sam is so cool”, and for the first time, I genuinely reconsidered our friendship. We ended up not texting each other for a day, which was uncommon; I guess she was too occupied with Sam’s texts. 

The next day, which was a week ago, Sarah texted me saying that I should consider becoming Sam’s friend because of how ‘fascinating’ he was. She gave me his username to start a chat with him. I decided to start a short conversation with him, because of how eager Sarah was for me and him to become friends.

As I was texting him, I felt something VERY off about him. He somehow knew a lot about me. He asked me extremely specific questions. One of the questions asked was “Do you normally fall asleep around 12:15 am?”When I answered yes to these unusual questions, he replied saying he did the same thing, and that me and him would get along. I didn’t reply to his message. There was no way I was going to continue speaking to this creep.

I told Sarah about this and she said we were ‘the best duo.’ I just wanted her to be serious for once; How had this Sam guy manipulated her to think these questions were normal? I got pretty mad at her and that was the first argument we had ever had. I did say quite hurtful things to her and we haven’t texted each other since.

I tried to forget about the whole situation, even though it was bothering me. That was until yesterday when Sam sent me a message saying “See you tonight ;)” 

I thought he meant to message some random girl so I just ignored the message.

I was extremely exhausted since I had a long shift at work, so I fell asleep on my side, facing the wall; If you read the title you’d know I suffer from sleep paralysis, so I normally sleep on my side to try and prevent it, though I still end up experiencing it. However, I hadn’t experienced it since the time Sarah had told me about becoming friends with Sam; So I wasn’t expecting anything to happen that night.

Unfortunately, I woke up in the middle of the night, somehow lying on my back, paralyzed. I watched as the monster appeared on the bed, its blurry figure slowly getting closer to my motionless body. 

When it was a few inches near my face, I was able to move again. But for some reason, it didn’t disappear like it normally did. I got up from my bed and slowly walked to the door, but it grabbed my neck before I could even touch the doorknob. I felt its hands tighten around my neck, its nails stabbing into my neck like swords. I tried to scream, but my vocal cords were trapped in its grip.

After what felt like an eternity, it finally released me from its grip and I passed out.

Today I woke up, disoriented and had a horrible pain in my neck. I walked into the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and almost screamed. There were nasty scars on my neck from when it attempted to strangle me. 

I’ve been trying to search for anything that explains what I have experienced. It just doesn’t make any sense. Is what I’ve been suffering from for the past 4 years sleep paralysis, or something else? I’m starting to consider the possibility that Sam is the demon, but I’m not sure. Maybe it was just a coincidence that he had sent that message. I don’t even know what to say to Sarah and I know she won’t even believe me if I tell her what I’ve experienced.

Can someone please [explain](https://www.reddit.com/u/ruin777/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)?
