I should’ve turned back the second I saw the fog rolling over the treeline.

It wasn’t natural—at least not the kind of fog you’d expect on a damp autumn evening. This was thicker, heavier, like wet wool dragged across the road. It moved with purpose, curling low to the ground, swallowing the ditches and fence posts one by one until it felt like I was driving through a tunnel of smoke.

The radio had cut out miles back, leaving me with the rattle of the heater fan and the wet slap of the wipers. Every mile marker I passed felt like an afterthought, half-hidden in the gloom, their paint scabbed with rust. I hadn’t seen another car for almost an hour.

I told myself it was fine. Just weather. Just another quiet back road in rural New England. The kind of place where the GPS drifts into nonsense and cell service dies before you realize it. But that creeping thought kept clawing at me: I don’t remember this road being here.

I was supposed to be on Route 9. It should’ve taken me past diners with flickering neon signs, rundown gas stations, maybe a field or two gone to seed. Not this endless corridor of black trees and fog. No turns, no intersections. Just the same narrow strip of cracked asphalt stretching ahead endless.

And then I saw it.

A break in the mist. A shape looming where there shouldn’t have been anything at all. A house.

It sat hunched at the end of a gravel drive, its roofline sagging, its windows blind and dark. The clapboard siding was the color of old bones, peeling in long strips that curled like dead skin. A porch slouched across the front, its railing bowed inward as though the house had been holding its breath too long and finally caved in on itself.

I slowed the car to a crawl. My headlights carved two pale beams across the yard, catching weeds up to my knees and a rusted swing set missing its swings. The fog thinned around the house, like it respected its boundary. Or avoided it.

I should’ve kept driving. But I didn’t.

The gas light blinked to life.

The needle was pinned on empty.

“Shit.”

There hadn’t been a gas station since—hell, I didn’t even know how far back. And the thought of breaking down in this suffocating fog was worse than the thought of knocking on the door of some decrepit farmhouse.

I pulled in. Gravel crunched under the tires, loud in the silence. When I cut the engine, the quiet that followed was worse. No crickets. No night birds. Just the sound of fog pressing against the world like a wet blanket.

The house didn’t look abandoned, not completely. The roof was bad, sure, and the porch sagged, but there was a faint glow behind the curtains in the downstairs window. Candlelight, maybe. Or a lamp too weak to fight the dark.

I sat there with my hands on the steering wheel, trying to convince myself this wasn’t insane. That it was normal to ask a stranger for directions. That people out here were probably kind, helpful, maybe even glad for company.

But the longer I stared, the more my stomach twisted.

The house looked…hungry.

I don’t mean that in some metaphorical, gothic-poetry sense. I mean the sight of it made me feel like prey. Like something inside was waiting, patient and silent, for me to step too close.

I forced myself out of the car anyway.

The air was colder outside, damp enough to cling to my clothes. My breath came in little clouds that vanished almost immediately into the mist. The gravel shifted beneath my boots, loud in the kind of way that made me flinch.

I walked up the porch steps. They groaned, but didn’t give. My hand hovered over the door knocker, a rusted iron thing shaped like a wolf’s head with its jaw open. Its teeth were worn down, but still sharp enough to catch skin.

I knocked once.

The sound carried too far, echoing like the walls were hollow.

For a long moment, nothing.

Then—footsteps. Slow, deliberate. Coming closer.

I froze.

The door creaked open, just enough for the glow inside to spill out. It wasn’t candlelight after all. It was the sickly yellow of a bare bulb, the kind that flickers in basements and gas station bathrooms.

A man stood in the doorway. Or maybe what was left of one.

His skin had the pallor of paper soaked in grease, his eyes sunk deep as if the sockets had been hollowed. He wore suspenders over a stained undershirt, his belly sagging forward, his chest freckled with spots that looked like mold. His hair was stringy, stuck to his temples like damp straw.

But it was his smile that made bile rise in my throat.

It was too wide, too eager. His lips cracked at the corners, splitting like old leather, showing gums that glistened black in the light.

“You’re lost,” he said. His voice was gravel dragged across a rusted grate.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t answer.

He stepped back, holding the door open. “Come in. The fog doesn’t like to wait.”

And the strangest thing was, I almost did.

My body leaned forward without me telling it to, like a string had been tied from my ribs to the dark inside. Something about the way he said it—it wasn’t an invitation. It was an inevitability.

I stumbled back a step, breaking the tension. My voice cracked when I forced words out.

“Gas station. Is there one nearby?”

His smile faltered, just for a second. Then it snapped back, wider than before.

“Not out there,” he said, tilting his head toward the fog. “Only in here.”

His hand rested on the edge of the door, fingers tapping against the wood. Nails long, yellowed, sharp enough to scratch grooves into the paint.

The silence stretched. The fog pressed closer. My chest tightened.

And then—somewhere deep inside the house—I heard it.

A second set of footsteps.

Not heavy, not slow. Scuttling, fast, coming closer.

Suddenly the footsteps stopped.

I forced myself to step back from the porch. My throat felt raw when I spoke.

“I—I’ll figure it out. Thank you.”

His grin didn’t fade. If anything, it spread thinner, like skin stretching over bone. His head tilted, one shoulder rising like a shrug that had gone wrong.

“You won’t,” he said. His voice was a croak, but the words landed heavy, final.

Then he shut the door.

The bulb’s glow vanished. The house was a silhouette again, sharp against the fog.

I staggered back down the steps, almost tripping on the last one. My breath steamed in the air, quick and shallow. I fumbled for my car door handle like it was the only solid thing left in the world. When I yanked it open, the hinges screamed.

The car didn’t want to start.

The engine coughed, whined, then died. I turned the key again. Same result. On the third try, it roared to life with a shudder, but the relief was short-lived—because when my headlights cut across the yard, the road was gone.

Not hidden. Not faded. Gone.

Where the gravel drive had met the cracked asphalt, there was only fog. No strip of black tar, no painted lines, no direction at all. Just white, rolling nothingness.

I gripped the wheel tighter. My breath fogged the glass, blurring everything outside. I wiped at it with my sleeve, eyes darting. The swing set. The weeds. The porch. All still there.

But no road.

I killed the headlights, hoping maybe it was just the beam scattering. For a moment, I sat in darkness so thick it felt like I’d been buried alive. When I flicked them back on—same thing.

No road.

I whispered, “No, no, no…” under my breath like it was a prayer.

My only choice was forward. Into the fog.

The car lurched as I pressed the gas, tires crunching over gravel. The beam cut through milk-thick mist, revealing only more of itself. I crept forward, hands tight, every nerve screaming that this was wrong. That I wasn’t driving through air—I was driving through something alive, something that brushed against the car, dragging invisible fingers across the metal.

The fog swallowed everything.

The house vanished. The yard vanished. Even the rearview mirror was useless—just a slab of white behind me.

I drove until I thought my eyes would bleed from staring, until my hands cramped around the wheel. But no road appeared. No landmarks. Nothing but endless fog.

And then my headlights struck wood.

I slammed the brakes, the seatbelt biting my shoulder.

It was a signpost.

Old, rotting, leaning like it had been standing for decades. The paint was peeling, letters faded almost to nothing. But when I squinted, I could still make them out.

THE HOUSE
 0.3 miles

I gagged, bile rising in my throat. The steering wheel blurred as my eyes watered. I rubbed them, blinked hard, and looked again.

The words hadn’t changed.

I shifted into reverse, tires spitting gravel. The fog parted just enough for me to see where I’d come from—and my stomach dropped.

The house was there.

Right behind me.

Closer than before.

The porch light was on again, spilling yellow onto the steps. And there was something moving in the window. Not the man. Something smaller. Lower to the ground. Its shape twitched against the curtain, jerky, insect-like.

I slammed the gas, but the car jolted once and died.

Dead silence.

I pounded the steering wheel, tears hot in my eyes. The fog pressed against the windshield, greedy and thick. And then I heard it again.

Footsteps.

This time outside.

Circling the car.

Slow, and deliberate.

Something scraped across the glass. Nails, or claws.

I didn’t breathe. Didn’t move. My heart hammered so loud I thought it would burst out of my chest.

And then—fingers curled over the driver’s-side window. Long, yellowed, jointed wrong. They tapped once, twice, like a polite request to come inside.

I couldn’t stop myself, I screamed…
