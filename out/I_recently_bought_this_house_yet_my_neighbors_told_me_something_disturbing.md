I’ve always wanted to move away, but I’ve never got the opportunity too. Finally, I just a job offer in Virginia. I couldn’t be more happier. 

Once I moved into my new house, I heard a knock on the door. It was my neighbors. I thought they came to introduce themselves, but instead they told me something disturbing. 

From the closet every night at 2 am a whistle would come from the door. But no matter what happened, I couldn’t open the door. 

It was a long talk, but eventually they started to leave. When I asked them what happened if someone opened the door, they just left with pale white faces. 

For the last 3 days, I’ve kept to myself about opening the door. I was a late to set person, so I would usually here the whistle while getting ready for bed. The high pitched voice sounded scaringly familiar. 

I decided to go to one of my friends party tonight, so I left the house around 8. I spent much of my time at the beginning with shots of tequila. I could barely stand by the end of the party. 

I was already starting to feel sick from all the alcohol, similar to my hangover at 21. So I went to bed by midnight. 

At 2 am I heard the noise and woke up, yet it was coming from the front door. If I wasn’t so drunk I probably would have stayed put, but this seemed strange to me, so I went and investigated. Before I could get out of bed, I heard my neighbors voice come from the banging door. 
“Let me in, I brought you something special!” 
She would repeat over and over in a creeky, high pitched voice. I could see blood dripping down the peephole, keeping me from opening the door. 

A half hour later I got tiered of this and opened the door. 

It was like nobody was there for a few seconds. I thought maybe my neighbors ding dong ditched me, but then a thin demonic looking creature sped out the top of the door. 

Running up the stairs it grabbed my ankles and dragged me down the stairs to the fouir which looked like a wildfire. Before the flames burned my skin, I sprinted into the closet. 

I had a heart attack once I saw the doorknob turn, and at top of the door creaked open to a creatures murder-looking face. When I came inches from my face, it threw off its face. 

It was my other neighbor in a  horrifying costume. He said he heard I was moving in and wanted to play a prank on me to see how I would react. 

My shocked face and his laughing face all turned horrified to the sound of whistling to my closet. It was 2:50. I told him to stop his prank because I knew it was him, but by the look on his face, I knew it wasn’t him. 

My neighbor ran outside of the house to a couple blocks down. I slowly creeped up to the door. And again, there I saw it.

The skinny, horrifying creature I saw before. I stayed in the closet next to it as I heard its  scratches at the door. The sharp fingernails slid under the door. I ran straight out the closet with the thing at my feet. 

Running down the street I could tell the thing was still in my house. I decided to spend the next three weeks at a hotel a city south. 

I was able to buy a new house an hour away. I was relieved until I heard the news: Lock the pantry after dusk.
