Hello there old friends, some time since we last spoke wasn’t it. More exactly 102 days 23 hours, 58 minutes and 30 seconds. For those who don't know what this means, it means I have had some nights with no sleep and equally many stories to tell you. I’m taking my time to write because well my time is running out and in a few months I’m dead. You see this tragic story has to come to an end sometime right?

But let’s not focus on that, let me tell you about the little incident that’s called the past 100 days. For the ease of it all I’m going to put this into let’s call it chapters.

Mr. Smith’s:

You see, in the last post I made, I wrote about a man who spoke to me about Miranda. Now Miranda that’s a whole other chapter and empire but this man is what we call “A Smith ''. Now a Smith isn’t someone you want to mess with, the Smiths are trained warriors who got recruited as children. These are children with extraordinary and very specific personal traits. I would say damn close to the line of being psychopaths. Low emotional ability and high intelligence. These children are separated from their parents and trained and drilled on everything from advanced firearm-techniques and close combat. They are a walking breathing tool of death.

I've had some interactions with them before but lately they've been so far up my ass that they should have bought dinner first. They're a real struggle to be quite honest. I've also had my fair amount of close calls with the "Play-maker". The Play-maker is a leader of sorts. He controls groups of smiths. we got more of them but the play-maker is the worst of them all. He's been onto me since that damn crash. But I've become smarter ooohhh, have I become smarter. You see I don't like not having a plan, but from that day forward I always had a plan... Until today. You see I'm a dead man walking. My Empire that I worked so hard to build these past 100 days I've basically controlled most of the western part of the world is falling apart. But you know I'm already getting ahead of myself. Now the Play-maker that's where we are. The Play-maker is not someone you would think of when you think of a person trained since childhood to be an assassin. The Play-maker is an old man, one of the first of the Smiths. He's probably in his late 50's or early 60's but still pushes on like he was 20.The Play-maker is tall with a pale scared up face. He wears a black suit with a long coat and an old beat up hat. I wish I could tell you more about this Play-maker but I’m afraid I don’t know much more about him, he’s like a ghost . He's a real son of a bitch. I have enough scars from this guy to make a war prisoner from a gulag look like a newborn child.

You see after that car crash I stopped being an active part of the business and ran it from a far. I didn’t want to take any chances. I expanded and soon enough I had a global network of couriers. I could smuggle whatever I wanted whenever I wanted too. I thought I was untouchable. I owned a freight company which worked as both a snuggle route and a safe escape for myself. I made sure to load containers containing a portable living space so whenever I had to escape I had my route. I had a tight grip of many people in high places that did my bidding for me. I had a mobile medical dispatch team, with buildings all over every major city in the west. I had even started to make my way into the Russian market. Who do you think is supplying them in Ukraine? Now I know what you’re thinking, “Oh you’re helping a country to attack another innocent country! How could you?”. Well, they were the higher bidder. Also, I gather a lot of information about the whereabouts of Russian soldiers and equipment and guess who’s buying that? Now that we’ve gotten that part done. Everything worked just fine until about a month ago when one of my bodyguards told me to evacuate my safe house immediately. Now I did as I was told and was put into my own car. I thought it was my own car until my eyes met with a very familiar face… Miranda.

“Long time no see” Miranda said with a smirk as she took out a folder.

I just looked at her for a while without saying anything.

“You’ve managed to make a pretty big name for yourself haven’t you Charlie?” Miranda continued.

“Or do you want to be called “The Ghoul”, what do you prefer?” Miranda asked with a little laugh.

I looked at her for a few seconds before I replied.

“Well, do you know why they call me that?” I asked. Not leaving her eyes with my gaze.

Before she could answer I continued.

“It’s because no one knows if I’m dead or alive… You see Miranda, thanks to you I don’t exist. Hell, I should thank you!” I laughed

“Now you see, in around 30 seconds I won’t be here anymore and you’ll be dead” I said with a straight face again, relaxing back into the chair.

“And how do you think to do that?” Miranda laughed, but before she could continue the car stopped.

“Thank you for your question, sadly I don’t have the time to explain, it was nice knowing you Miranda.” I opened the door on my right as one of my body guards shot Miranda.

Let me explain what actually happened here. Now Miranda had her empire of her own, she was involved with some really big names and my way to the top is a stairway of bodies. Miranda happened to be the first of them all. You see it was an evacuation but I knew it would happen because a source of mine had told me that the day before. So you see this wasn’t a kidnapping or a business meeting this was my first move to a hostile takeover. The bodies I buried around 3 months ago laid the foundation of what my empire was to become. The sheer amount of corpses laying in unmarked graves would make you want to never go out in the forest again. I know I’m a monster but here we are anyway, I’ve come to peace with it. But let me tell you this, with every person that died of my hands a part of myself died with them.

With the assassination of Miranda came hell, you see Miranda was one of the key people to an even greater association with the power to control the world from a far. I didn’t know this until around a week after Miranda died. When I came to one of my safe houses I had a visitor sitting on my couch. This was my first encounter with a Smith. Dead on the inside only operating on orders. If the orders were to kill me then I would have been dead right there but the only thing this man told me was.

“We see you, we know what you’ve done”

Now I didn’t really know how to respond to this but the man walked off leaving his gun on the table before closing the door to the container.

You see, at this point I was scared. Because If They knew about This safe house How many of my others were compromised, I started to panic. I didn’t, no I don’t want to go back to the times I worked for Miranda, I don’t want to get back to that damn lab again! You see I’ve seen what they make there now, they’ve started to work in biology and it’s not pretty, the creatures they create there are not of this world. It’s like all of those “mythical” creatures you hear in old stories and urban legends. They’re real, I’ve seen them, They haunt me in the dark and I’m sure they’re coming for me. It's just a matter of when, you see we raided a lab of theirs and I got stung by a syringe, haven’t been feeling like myself since then. I found scratch marks on my door last night too, they’ve gotten to me. They just couldn’t get through but they’re evolving, they're getting smarter. This morning I saw that they managed to use the handle but it was locked gladly so I need to get out of here. I don't want to end up like the people on the tape I found. My warning to you is simple, don’t search for me, don’t look for the association, don't get involved in this, they’re dangerous and they won’t hesitate to come for you.

As for me I regret that I got involved with this, because I will undergo another night of no sleep…
