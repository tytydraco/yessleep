My name is Michael John Moorsfield. I am now 79 at the time of writing this and I believe this is the end. My life, like so many others have had it's ups and downs, happiness, sadness, loyalty, betrayal. But, most importantly, it had love. For 43,5 amazing years I was graced by the presence of my dear Alma. Sure, she had her kinks, some of which I will not be sharing in this here letter, I hope you don't mind. 

Now, Alma had the kind of eyes that you could drown in. Almost literally at times, I had to stop myself from making myself look like a weird feller back when we where still strangers. But (excuse my language) god damn if you weren't left breathless when you looked. Sapphire blue with a sparkle that could blind a careless man. They started that way attleast. 

Month after month they slowly shifted. First the entire iris turned sapphire blue, the rest of them followed suit. Scared us damned senseless. She could see like normal, nor did she claim to have any pain. Doctors didn't know neither left nor right by the state of their faces. Now I'll be honest with you. I screamed right in their darned faces that they had no business with patients if they didn't have any interest in helping anyways! They kept claiming that "Everything seemed fine." I told him "The hell do you mean everything looks fine? She's blue all over!" But nope... Eyes looked fine. No issues we didn't already know about. 

It took me a while to get over that. It makes you think you're insane. But you couldn't possibly be. Since I ain't never had any dreams or fantasies about... 

Anyways, It started affecting her skin next. small touches first. Just dark spots, subtle. these spots grew hard. Then expanded. Slowly. For fucking YEARS we returned to the doctors. Every week first. Then every day. They told us to seek help at "A calmer place, where you can wind down and relax." But I know what I saw and felt and tasted. That was real. 

They don't teach you in school how to deal with a situation like this. Mentally it was the second most traumatizing thing i've had to endure. So there was no way I could even pretend to understand how it must have felt for her. She kept saying that she was okay. We rarely argued normally. But whenever I asked If there was anything to be done to help her. At all. Even if it was just a glass of water. She got really venomous out of nowhere. Pushing every little button she knew would hurt. 

We were both so sure, that this would be the end for her. When over 80% of her body was covered in this dark... shell. She couldn't move. She could barely talk at this point. I made the mistake of trying to lighten the mood, gave her shell a good knocking like I was a visitor at the door. The sound was wooden almost, like it was an actual door I was knocking on. I've never seen such sadness before. Sad is not a good word for it. Completely fucking broken would be the more proper term for it. She asked me to move her to the guest room. Said she couldn't stand to look at me right then. When I walked in to her the next day, it was too late. Every little part of her was covered now. Even her god damned hair was covered in it. The love of my life, taken like that. The fact that the last thing I did to her, was to give her the most excruciating mental pain she's ever had to endure. It haunts me. It drives me up the fucking walls actually.

That's when the "urges" came. Because it looked so much like beef jerky, which I love by the way. It is with the most horrific shame I tell you that "Maybe just a nibble." is a thought that came to me on more than one occation. She was always the most beautiful soul around and i'm sure that it would be reflected in the taste. She was always so sweet. So I bit, right into a piece of her arm. That's when the screaming started. She screamed the most horrific screech i've ever heard. She barely sounded human anymore. But to be honest that was not the biggest shock in that moment. When I bit into her she tasted nothing like beef jerky. She was first of all, extremely tough to pierce. And a definate world record  holder for the  largest living gusher. But instead of a mouth full of fruity sugary goodness. You get a mouthful of bile. I don't think it was actually bile, tasted like it though. What flowed out of the hole I made was some pitch black, molasses thick fluid. It just kept pouring and pouring, to be honest it was quite transfixing to see just how much fluid a person makes. I assume the black liquid is all that was left of her, she was all hollow like inside. Nothing left of her besides that empty shell she resided in. The screams continued though. So she must be alive in there somehow.

There are many things I could tell you. That it all ended peacefully somehow. That Alma got the rest she deserves and got to feel the sweet embrace of God finally. This was a week ago now however, and her screams have not died down. Not one bit. Please believe me I tried it all to make her stop. I've spent the last 3 days slurping up the black tar that is Alma. Just to throw it up again. But it NEEDS to be in me. then we'll never be separated. Just like we always wanted.

My name is Michael John Moorsfield and I believe this is the end. If you can read this, I have taken shelter inside of her shell. The screams are not so loud in here. It's dark and tight, but I feel it getting a little bigger by the hour. I slurped you up, now you will not spill. 

I love you. My dearest Alma.
