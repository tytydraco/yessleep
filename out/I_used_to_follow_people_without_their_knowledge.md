Before you judge me, I wasn’t following anyone for malicious intentions or anything. I had recently gotten a part in a movie called True Entertainment where I played a killer film director. I had read somewhere that some actors would follow strangers around to get into the mindset of a murderer for a role, so that’s what I decided to do. 

It was actually about my sixth attempt at stalking someone. The longest time I had spent following someone was when I followed a guy who looked just like Timothee Chalamet for two days, staying in a hotel opposite his house. I gave up once he saw me. A few days after I gave up on following him, I walked to Oxford Street (the movie was shooting in London) to find my next “prey”. I scanned the streets so I could see anyone that stood out from the crowd. That’s when I saw him. He had slicked back, black hair, an open grey trench coat, a crooked nose, pale skin and a large scar across his face. He moved with something of an urgent pace and he would occasionally tap his head while he walked. I saw him as the perfect victim. I quickly began to follow him. 

It started without anything unusual happening; I simply followed him while he carried on with his daily life, completely unaware of my existence. He stopped at a coffee shop for a few minutes where I was able to see his eyes were oddly yellow and he had black, wool gloves on. I continued to follow him after he left, making sure to not be seen while also trying to find out as much about him as I could. I already knew that he took his coffee black but didn’t know much else. He seemed to be just a regular person with a few strange features. However, he disproved all of my notions about his normalcy once he reached a baby’s stroller.

I don’t think he even looked at it properly. He just walked by it, turned his head to look at where the mother was standing a few feet away, grabbed the stroller and pushed it into the road. He had no way to see if the baby was in there or not, but I think that somehow he knew it was in the stroller. He didn’t react in any way, he just continued walking while facing forward as if this was completely normal behaviour. The stroller went rolling into the road, heading towards a speeding car. Luckily, the car swerved in time to miss the stroller, leaving the baby unharmed but sobbing loudly. Its mother turned and ran towards the road, grabbing the baby while screaming loudly. Almost everyone on the street turned to look at the mother screaming in the middle of the road, no one even noticing the culprit waking away in his grey jacket. I felt sick to my stomach knowing that he almost killed an infant but I knew that I had to keep following him. 

He continued going about his day as if nothing had happened, showing no sign of regret or remorse. He went to the supermarket, got food at McDonalds and even gave money to a homeless man. It was like I was following around the wrong person, like the attempted infacide was done by someone else and this was just an ordinary man. Hours went by as I continued to watch his every move, waiting for him to commit some new, even more horrific crime. It was getting dark at this point and I expected him to head home soon. But he didn’t. Instead he froze in place for a solid two minutes before pulling out his phone and staring at a random photo of a man in his gallery for a further five minutes. Suddenly, he began to rush down the street as I silently stalked him. The Sun had gone down completely by the time he had reached his destination, a large park which was now devoid of all light. He entered and I followed him inside. 

He still hadn’t seen me by the time he had reached a children’s playground near the centre of the park. He began to play on the playground, going down the slides and climbing on the monkey bars, laughing to himself like an excited child. I hid in a nearby bush to observe this oddly disturbing behaviour. As he began to swing on the swing set, I noticed an elderly man start to approach him, moving using a walking stick to get around. He came closer to the man on the swings and began to call out to him. 
“Is this Jeremy? Jeremy Smalls?”
The swings stopped as the man turned to answer. 
“Yes.”
“It’s me, Paul. From eBay. I’m here for the Cabaret CD.”
The man on the swings stood up, silently approached the elderly man, grabbed his walking stick and began to strike the man in the chest with it. I almost screamed as I watched this brutality. The elderly man tried to run away but fell to the ground without his walking as the man came over and began to kick him in the side. There was an audible cracking of bones from the violent blows. The man started to kick sand from the ground into his victim’s face, slowly silencing his screams for mercy. He lifted up the walking stick and brought it down on the man’s head with enough force to crack his skull, killing him. This finally caused me to vomit before I ran for my life. The killer never saw me, he just walked away from the corpse and continued to play on the playground. 

A few days later, I found myself lying awake in my hotel room, unable to sleep despite it being almost three in the morning. I had called the police as soon as I got out of the park but like in most of these stories, they found no trace of the killer other than the mangled corpse of his victim. I barely left my room after it happened because I was terrified of the thought that I’d run into him. I knew that he hadn’t seen me but that didn’t stop my concerns. The movie had been cancelled, for unrelated reasons, and I had a flight out of England in seven hours. I had already packed so I just had to wait until the morning to leave. I continued to lie in bed, replaying the murder over and over in my head. Eventually, I looked at the clock and just decided to get to the airport a few hours early. It was better than staying in this room. I grabbed my suitcase and walked out of the room. I made it about halfway down the hotel’s stairs when I realised I had left my passport in my room. I turned around and walked back up the stairs before I saw something that still makes my blood run cold while I write this. 

He was outside of my room, trying to use a lock pick to open the door. I still don’t know how he found me but he did. He made no noise as he attempted to force his way into my room. His face was cold and emotionless and his yellow eyes had no soul behind them. He didn’t see me as I watched him from across the hall. My heart began to beat so loud that I thought he would be able to hear it. I dropped my bag on the floor, which made a loud thud. He looked up at me with those eyes and spoke to me for the first time. 
“Room service.”
I ran down the stairs as fast as I could. I heard him desperately sprinting after me jumping down stairs and sliding down handrails in an attempt to reach me. Luckily, I reached the lobby of the hotel before he did, which had enough people in it for him to choose not to go after me. I saw him walk past me, ignoring me as if I was a complete stranger. He walked out of the hotel and I never saw him again. 

About an hour later, I sat in a police station. I was shaking violently and tears were streaming down my face. I had filed my report and an officer was sitting next to me, trying to reassure me. 
“You’re safe now. We’re gonna catch him.”
Suddenly, another officer came into the room.
“We found something in the room.”
The officer next to me stood up and walked outside with the officer. A few minutes later, he came back alone and gave me some horrifying news. 
“There’s no easy way to say this but we found a corpse in your room. She was in your wardrobe with your passport in her mouth. We think that he put her there so you would find her when you were looking for your passport.”
I was in shock but was still able to ask a question. 
“How did he know I left my passport?”
“We think he was in the room with you and the body. He must have waited for you to leave to display her body.”
“But he was trying to break in.”
“No, he was trying to lock the door from the outside. He must have wanted you to think everything was normal, have you enter the room, find the body but find no trace of him.”
I went back to the US a few days later. The police never found any more evidence so he was able to get away with everything. 

This story happened years ago but I can never seem to put it out of my mind for one reason; if he was able to hide in my room with a dead body for at least a full day, how would I know if he was here with me now. They never caught him and he was able to find my hotel room despite never seeing my face. How do I know that he couldn’t find me in the US? How do I know he’s not in the room with me as I write this?
