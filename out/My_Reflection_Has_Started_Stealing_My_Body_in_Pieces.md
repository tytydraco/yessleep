It started with my left eye. I was brushing my teeth, leaning against the sink, tired in that way where everything feels a little warped at the edges. The mirror was fogged, streaked from the last half-hearted wipe with my sleeve, and I was barely paying attention. But then I blinked, and she didn’t.

Just a second too late. Just enough to make my chest go still for a beat.

I laughed under my breath. Shrugged. Told myself I was imagining things. Probably just tired. I even said it out loud. “You’re overtired. You’re being weird.” But she didn’t shrug back. Or maybe she did, but not at the same time I did. Her movement was slower. Or delayed. Or hesitant. Like she was copying me, not reflecting me.

I waved my right hand. A little test. She followed. But there was a pause. A stutter in the space between my decision and hers. It wasn’t long, barely half a second. But it felt like a choice. Like she was watching me and deciding whether or not she was going to bother playing along.

That’s what stayed with me. Not the eye. Not the delay. The idea that she was deciding.

I rinsed my mouth and stood there longer than I should’ve. The bathroom light was buzzing faintly overhead, the air smelled like mouthwash and humidity, and my own reflection didn’t feel like mine anymore. It felt like someone very good at pretending.

I didn’t tell anyone. I don’t know why. Maybe saying it would’ve made it real. Maybe I was scared someone would believe me.

That night I stood in front of the mirror again. Stared at her. Blinked. She blinked with me.

Perfectly in time.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t looking at a reflection anymore.

I was looking at someone waiting for me to stop watching.



Over the next few days, it got worse.

It started with my left index finger. I noticed it while trying to tie my shoelaces. It just wouldn’t curl right. The rest of my hand moved fine, but that finger stuck out at a weird angle, stiff and numb like it had fallen asleep and forgotten how to wake up. I shook it out, flexed it, pressed the pad with my thumb until it throbbed. Nothing. Just cold.

I went to the bathroom, flicked the light on, and held both hands up to the mirror.

She moved. All ten fingers curled perfectly. Smooth. Effortless.

I watched her copy me exactly, except my hand didn’t move the same. One digit limp. A delay in my wrist when I tried to match her rhythm. My hand twitched, and hers followed like she was mocking me. I told myself it was a weird nerve thing. Maybe I slept on it wrong. Maybe it was stress. Bodies do weird things all the time, right? I Googled it, which was a mistake. Five minutes in and I’d convinced myself I had early-onset ALS or a brain tumour pressing against the wrong part of me. I made a doctor’s appointment. Urgent. I didn’t say “my reflection is behaving like it’s a separate person.” I just said I was worried. That something wasn’t working the way it should.

I think I already knew they wouldn’t find anything.

They didn’t.

The scans were clean. My reflexes were fine. No muscle wasting. No lesions. No obvious reason why half my hand wouldn’t respond unless I moved it with the other. The doctor asked if I’d been under stress lately, with that look people give you when they’re already halfway to writing it off as anxiety.

I smiled and nodded. I didn’t know how to explain it.

Didn’t know how to say: My reflection is learning to live without me.

And worse, I think she’s getting good at it.



I stopped going to the mirror casually. I used to pass it a dozen times a day, brushing my teeth, fixing my hair, checking if my shirt was on backwards. But now I started avoiding eye contact with myself. Walking past without looking. Keeping the lights off. Pretending I didn’t feel her watching me.

But I still caught glimpses. Enough to know she was changing.

It started subtle. Her movements were quicker. Cleaner. While I fumbled to tie my hoodie one-handed, she moved like she had nothing wrong with her at all. Fluid. Sharp. Whole. My reflection had always been half a second behind, that’s how mirrors work, but now she was anticipating me. Starting a movement just before I did, like she knew what I was going to do next. Like she’d already practiced.

And then she stopped pretending altogether.

One night, I looked up while washing my face and saw her head tilted, not softly, not in thought, but in this slow, mechanical way, like she was observing me. Studying. And the worst part is I hadn’t moved. I was still hunched over the sink, dripping water down my shirt, eyes closed.

When I opened them, she was smiling.

Not a warm smile. Not a nervous one. Something smug. Crooked. Self-contained.

Like she’d figured something out and wasn’t going to tell me.

Another time, I caught her mouthing something. I was brushing my teeth, trying not to shake too badly, and in the mirror, her lips moved slow and deliberate, forming words I didn’t recognise. I tried to mimic her, say the shapes aloud, but it came out as nonsense. She just kept going. Unbothered.

She waved at me once.

Just once.

I hadn’t lifted my hand.




I decided to test her.

I sat on the bathroom floor with the lights off and the door cracked just enough to let in the hallway glow. From there, I could see the mirror. I didn’t move. I didn’t blink. I kept myself as still as I could, jaw locked, hands tucked under my thighs. Just watching.

She moved.

Not a lot. Not dramatically. Just little things, a twitch at the corner of her mouth, a roll of her shoulder, the soft, slow way she turned her head and looked directly at me. I didn’t return it. I kept staring straight ahead, and she… smiled.

It felt wrong. Not because she moved, I’d seen that already. But because she looked amused.

She looked like she was waiting for me to catch up.

I sat there until my eyes burned, until my legs went numb, until the quiet in the room stopped feeling peaceful and started feeling aware. Like it had noticed me. Like it was breathing.

And still, she moved.

Not constantly. Just enough to remind me she wasn’t copying anymore. She was existing. She was independent.

Eventually, I got brave enough to try something else.

I pulled a chair in. Faced the mirror directly. Sat as still as I could for hours. I drank nothing. Ate nothing. I wanted to see if she would stop too. If she could.

She didn’t. Not at first.

She fidgeted. Tilted her head. Tapped her fingers on the arm of the chair, the arm I couldn’t feel anymore. She looked around like there was something in her side of the room I couldn’t see.

Then she met my eyes. Dead on.

And she froze.

We stared at each other for what felt like an hour, maybe more. I don’t remember blinking. I don’t remember breathing.

I only remember thinking, it felt like losing a staring contest with a corpse that had learned how to smile.



I’m not sure when my arm stopped being mine. One day it was heavy. The next, it just didn’t respond. I’d try to lift it and nothing would happen, like trying to move someone else’s limb through glass. My hand hung limp against my side. My elbow locked. My fingers curled just enough to look alive if I was standing still.

But they weren’t. Not really.

The worst part was watching her use it. In the mirror, she raised her arm easily. She twirled it. Cracked her knuckles. Waved, sometimes at me, sometimes at something behind her I couldn’t see. She moved like her body belonged to her. Like she was thriving in the parts of me I was losing.

I started walking with a limp. My right knee wouldn’t bend properly anymore. My face was next. Just one side at first. My cheek sagged, lip slack, the corner of my mouth too still when I tried to smile. The mirror version didn’t have that problem. She beamed. Showed teeth. Tilted her head in mock sympathy. Once, she laughed, this bright, airy laugh that came from my throat, even though mine stayed silent.

Because that’s when I realised I couldn’t speak.

Not just stammer. Not just slur. My mouth wouldn’t open. Not even to scream. I pressed my fingers to my lips and tried to force them apart. My jaw wouldn’t move.

And she talked. Freely. Loudly. Cheerfully. I couldn’t hear the words through the glass, but I saw the rhythm of them, saw the shape of her joy. It was mine, the way I used to talk when I got excited. The way I used to look before I started watching myself lose everything.

Then she leaned forward.

Placed one finger gently against the inside of the mirror.

I didn’t touch it.

But I felt it.

Cold. Real.

Like she was already halfway through.



I can’t move anymore.

Not really. Just one hand. The right. My fingers shake when I use them, but they’re still mine — for now. Everything else is gone. My legs won’t lift. My neck won’t turn. My mouth hasn’t opened in days. I blink, sometimes. But only if I try hard enough. Only if she lets me.

She’s standing in the mirror.

Closer than she’s ever been.

She doesn’t mimic me now. She doesn’t need to. She stretches. Dances. Touches her own face. Braids her hair differently every night. I don’t know where she learned that, I never taught her. But she looks so proud when she finishes. Like she’s rehearsing a version of me that works better.

Last night, she brought someone with her. Just a shadow, in the background. Someone with no face. Someone who laughed. She laughed too. They leaned in close and whispered something to her, and she looked at me - at me - and rolled her eyes like I was a joke she’d outgrown.

I don’t think she knows I still have this hand.

Or maybe she does. Maybe she’s letting me write this. Maybe this is part of the performance. One last story before the curtain closes.

I can’t feel my heartbeat anymore. I don’t remember when I last slept. Or ate. I don’t remember my brother’s face. I had a brother, I think. Or a cat. Or both. My name feels far away. Like it belongs to someone else. Maybe she has it now.

She’s closer today. Her hands on the glass. Pressed flat. Waiting.

I can feel the cold again.

It’s spreading.

When this is posted, she’ll be all that’s left.

And I’ll be inside.

Screaming.



I’m not sure when it happened.

There wasn’t a crack of thunder. No last scream. No moment where I could say this is where I stopped being me. It was quieter than that. Like falling asleep in the wrong bed and waking up in someone else’s skin.

I know I’m not in control anymore. I can’t move. Not even my fingers. I see her now through a filter I don’t understand, a kind of slow, cold distance, like I’m watching her through frost. She lives here. In my house. In my body. And no one notices the difference.

She laughs with my voice. Eats with my mouth. Answers messages I can’t read anymore. When someone calls, she tilts her head and smiles. Like she’s proud of the impression.

Sometimes she stands in front of the mirror, not to check her makeup or fix her hair. Just to stare at it. Like she’s waiting for something to look back.

I try. God, I try.

I push with everything I have. I scream until I’m hoarse in places that don’t exist. I press my hands to the glass. I reach. I reach. I reach.

But I don’t think she hears me anymore.

Tonight, she lit a candle. Stood in front of the mirror. Smoothed her dress like it was a ritual. The room was quiet. The air didn’t move. And then — just as the flame flickered low — she leaned in.

Her lips brushed the glass.

And she whispered,

“Finally.”
