[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/k0Klf2zMut)

After meeting that ancient, godlike ancestor of my species, something inside me finally quieted. The animal part—the one that never stopped growling beneath my skin—felt calmer, almost at peace. For the first time in months, I got real sleep. A week of it, full nights without the twitching, the nightmares, or the restless pacing.

It did wonders for my mind. I could think clearly again, breathe. The chaos that usually sat in my chest finally felt… manageable.

During that week, I kept teaching Annabelle and tried to learn more about supernatural society—the rules, the hierarchy, the unspoken line between predator and protector. I still didn’t feel like I deserved to be part of it, not after what my family and I had done. The Hemmings bloodline wasn’t made for peace.

Annabelle didn’t care about any of that. She accepted me without hesitation, too trusting for her own good. I just hoped the world wouldn’t punish her for it.
August was different—quiet, cautious—but I could tell she saw I was trying. That was enough.

When the school week ended, I actually felt… normal. I drove out to the Hollow Tap, a small, hidden bar that had become my kind of refuge. It only served monsters—no humans, no tourists, no hunters. Some of the patrons hid behind human masks, but most didn’t bother. It was one of the few places where you could walk in with fangs or horns and no one would stare.

Lucian owned the place. I hadn’t spoken to him much before that night, just knew what he was: a vampire.
In my world, vampires weren’t cursed corpses or fairy-tale monsters. They were the descendants of incubi and succubi who bred with humans long ago—creatures with just enough humanity to survive among us, and just enough demon in their blood to crave more than they should.
All demons, they say, trace back to one origin. The Ancestor. The first of them.

But I wasn’t thinking about any of that when I pulled into the parking lot.

Two figures stood near the entrance, one clearly not human—his skin shifting faintly, like something alive was moving beneath it. The other looked human enough, but the stance gave him away: shoulders squared, hand steady, eyes locked on the target.

He was one of mine. A Hemmings.

I didn’t recognize him, but I knew the look. We were taught to stand that way, to never hesitate when facing a monster. That faint tremor in his trigger hand was the only thing human about him.

He fired. I didn’t think—I just moved. My boot hit his ribs, the gunshot going wide, the bullet vanishing into the night. The gun clattered to the ground, but he twisted fast and fired again.

The shot tore into my stomach.

Silver.

The pain was instant and violent—acid burning through my veins, skin blistering around the wound. My body convulsed as the shift began, bones stretching, tendons tearing, fur pushing through my skin. My fingers cracked into claws. My breath came out as a snarl.

When I looked up, I wasn’t me anymore.

He aimed again. I lunged. My claws cut across his abdomen, tearing through him like paper. Blood hit the pavement, hissing faintly as it mixed with silver dust.

“That’s what silver feels like,” I snarled through a mouth no longer meant for words.

He fell back, gasping, but drew a knife—silver again—and ran straight for me. I dropped low, saw what he was trying to do, and bit down on his wrist as he swung. Bone cracked. Flesh gave way.

The taste of human blood hit my tongue. Hot. Sharp. Wrong. But my body didn’t care. It wanted more.

He screamed and, in one motion, lifted the gun with his other hand. He looked me dead in the eye and pressed it beneath his chin.

I barely had time to move before the world exploded in sound.

The gunshot echoed through the lot. Smoke curled from the barrel as his body went limp. He hit the ground hard, eyes open, blood spilling across the asphalt under the neon glow of the Hollow Tap sign.

I froze. I didn’t know what to feel—shock, guilt, pity. I knew the Hemmings hated monsters. It was our family creed. But I never thought one of them would rather die than risk becoming one of us.

I stared at him and wondered what my mother would’ve said if she saw me now—fur still patching my arms, claws soaked in blood. Would she have wanted me to do the same?

I don’t know. I don’t think I ever will.

The smell of blood filled the night air, and the calm I’d fought for all week began to unravel again.

I was breathing hard, chest heaving as my body slowly forced itself back into human form. Skin reknit, bones popped, fur fell away.

“It wasn’t my fault,” I muttered to no one. “He shot himself. He could’ve just lived with the chance of turning.”

I wanted to believe it. But I couldn’t shake the truth: I was a Hemmings too. I should’ve known he wouldn’t take the chance.

“Keep telling yourself that, buddy.”

The voice came from behind me—smooth, deep, and half-amused.

I turned. A man stood in the doorway of the Hollow Tap, pale as frost under the flickering light. Crimson eyes. Red hair, cut neat. Skin like polished marble. Lucian.

“Personally,” he said, “I don’t think it’s your fault. He would’ve killed someone for being different. Sounds like the real monster was him.”

My hands were still trembling, sticky with blood. “Even if that’s true,” I said, voice breaking, “I could’ve tried talking him down. Maybe I could’ve changed him.”

Lucian’s expression hardened. Fangs caught the light as he stepped closer, grabbed me by the collar, and hauled me halfway off the ground.

“Do you really believe that?” he hissed. “That man blew his own head off rather than risk changing. You don’t talk down to that kind of fanatic. Not everything is on your shoulders, idiot.”

I clenched my jaw and looked away. I hated that he was right. The Hemmings didn’t bend—they broke. That’s what made us dangerous.

Lucian sighed, let me go, and pulled me to my feet. He half-dragged, half-guided me into the bar. Inside, the air was thick with old blood and magic. Shadows clung to the corners, moving when they shouldn’t.

He set me down at the counter, ordered water for me and blood for himself. “My name’s Lucian,” he said, sitting beside me. “I’ve heard plenty about you. Guess the rumors didn’t do you justice. You’re even more of a dumb dog than I expected.”

I let out a low growl and punched his arm—not hard. “Not a dog, leech. But… nice to meet you, I guess. Even if you’re kind of an ass.”

That got a rare smirk out of him. He lifted his glass of blood in a mock toast before drinking.

The two of us sat there for a while, talking quietly as the day bled into night. Outside, the world kept turning. Inside, surrounded by monsters who didn’t have to hide what they were, I almost felt like I could fit in again.

Almost.
