The killing moon waits for me these are the words that haunted my childhood  

This story starts when I was 6 years old it and before I start going into the events I’d like to give some details. My family was religious and so when I was about 3 we moved to a small town up deep in the mountains there was about 4 restaurants 2 supermarkets and a lake in the center this was a resort town so tons of hotels and things like that one thing that always struck me as odd was the how many churches there were. 9 or 10 at the least my parents were pastors at one that also had a private school run out of it. That’s where I spent the first few years of my life. We had a two story house probably 6 or 7 miles out of town but I’ll get to that later. My birthday was in spring back then I didn’t have all that many friends maybe 10 or so but since we lived in a small town we were all close I remember the Fourth of July that year I’d say it’s the catalyst for what happened to me.   


There was two beaches in that town one with a hill going down it that’s where the most people went to watch the fireworks I was playing in the water when a kid maybe a year or so older walked up to me. “Hi would you mind if I played with you my mom and dad went to the shops and I don’t like being alone” I didn’t yet have a reason not to trust people so without much thought I said. “Yeah sure I’d love to play do you wanna build a sand castle” my mother came down and watched us both as we waited for the kids parents to come back I never caught his name. My names Sam I forgot to add that earlier in my details but I doubt I’ll use it much. The fireworks went off and it started to get dark the kids parents still hadn’t shown back up “hey are your mom and dad okay” I asked. He looked at me with a confused look”m-my mom and dad oh yeah I’ll go find them I’m sorry to of kept your family so long I hope this makes up for it”.  


I hadn’t noticed it before hand but he took off a necklace it looked to be old I’m not a metal expert but it could’ve been steal or maybe lead it had a lot of scratches in it. It was in the shape of well you probably could guess based on the title of this. It was a hour glass”oh I can’t take this from you it’s yours” but when I let out those last words a tear ran down his face as he ran off.  I never saw that kid again nor did I get to wear his necklace that long my mother’s birthday was in July so I thought I’d give it to her. But when I walked up the hill to my mom and dad and told my father my idea he asked if he could see my necklace “hey buddy can I take a look at that” I nodded my head I wasn’t all that worried I was a kid I just thought he was taking a interest I think the only reason I remember this so well is cause I only ever saw him like this once. Most kids don’t see their parents cry and if they do it’s most always the mom the dads are expected to show no emotion. 


So when that look of pure terror crossed my fathers face I new something was wrong but he wouldn’t tell me what till I mentioned this story and all these events some 20 years later. That will always be my biggest regret maybe it could’ve been different but hell I didn’t even connect the dots. That night we went home my father tossed the necklace in the garbage and we all went to bed. I don’t well I couldn’t remember my nightmare that night my mind automatically repressed it but I do remember waking up screaming and crying my parents rushed in the room and my mom held me”honey what’s wrong did you have a bad dream” I just sat there looking at my father as if to say please help me. Like I said the man was a pastor he probably thought he was doing some good I don’t blame him for it but he went outside and smashed my necklace I didn’t sleep alone for some months after that. 






Thats just the first of many strange things to happen in my youth the next takes place in second grade. I should give a layout of the church/school. There was the front doors and the main lobby then there was the sanctuary or as the school called it the chapel it was a giant box in the center of the building and everything around it was just long hallways with rooms attached. There was the offices where my father and others worked then the long hall where the classrooms and bathrooms were it was a L shape the short part of the L lead to the lobby and right at the start of the long hall was the bathrooms. 


At the very end of the hall was a door it lead outside to a small play area for the younger kids. My class was 2-4th grade and it was the closest to the bathrooms it was in room one there was 9 in total. It was about halfway into the year cause it was winter it snowed a lot in that town and it was Sunday night before school would start on Monday my father had just finished reading me a story and I had drifted asleep. 


Monday morning the first day 
I got to school and I was maybe in my third class of the day right before lunchtime I raised my hand “ma’am may I use the restroom” my teacher nodded and I walked down the hall there was 2 stalls and 2 urinals along with 3 sinks and a mirror. I did my business and as I was washing my hands I looked up and saw a crack in the mirror I didn’t think much of it and walked back to class I sat down “ma’am did Isaiah go home for the day” that was my best friends name. The teacher didn’t answer. After lunch we were walking back to our class when I looked down at the end of the hall the door was slightly open I thought nothing of it. 


Tuesday the second day 
He wasn’t back today either I thought he had just gone on vacation things played out the same as before I raised my hand went to the bathroom yet this time the mirror had more cracks actually 3 more has strung off from the first large crack when I went back 3 more people were missing. Now at this point anyone would know somethings wrong but I was a private schooled 2nd grader who had never seen a horror film. That day we walked back and like the day before the door was open a bit more this time 


Wednesday the third day. 
At this point why even bother repeating myself the same day happened again until I got to the bathroom and more cracks were there then after lunch the door was about halfway open it was the same the next day 



Friday the last day. 
This is where I realized how wrong everything was I walked in and instead of being greeted by lights and sounds or children an staff it was dark and quite I went to the bathroom first this time before walking into class. The mirror was shatters behind it was a hole like something had been watching. It was just me outside it was fake but a different dark then just night in this dark you could see but you knew you wernt alone it was as if it was alive that’s when I noticed the door was wide open I walked down the hall and stepped outside it was cold and dark like a storm with flashes of red and the screams of the dead I looked into the snow everyone who was missing all of them horribly killed with to much detail there’s no way a child could even understand it. 


That’s when I turned and saw it for the first time there in the doorway was something that resembled a human except it’s skin if there even was any looked burnt it was thin you could see it’s bones poke through its flesh it guts fell out onto the snow it was dark the pure embodiment of darkness except for its eyes they were white human like I knew those eyes but I couldn’t tell where from and it’s teeth they were human I didn’t even fit in its mouth they were far to small. Just then I felt a hand grab me”hey buddy is time to wake up for school” I opened my eyes to see my father “w-what day is it” he looked down at me”it’s Monday why” I rub my eyes” oh nothing just had a weird dream” I got to school it was normal I checked the bathroom and the end of the hall nothing was out of the ordinary. Expect the fact that he wasn’t back yet my best friend Isaiah. We never saw or heard anything from him again 




Now up till this point my stories been believable hell even if you don’t believe it that don’t matter I’m saying this so someone knows what happened to me and what happened to them this next part takes place in 5th grade on a camping trip. By this point my best friend from second grade didn’t even cross my mind anymore for all I know he ran away and was somewhere else probably with his dad. This was a church camping trip my parents and all their employees would camp for a weekend every summer I got to bring my friend I was in 5th grade and he was in 7th. 


I thought he was awesome we were at a lake up in the Mountains that ran off into the big lake in the center of town. We had been camping for about a day or so it was late Saturday evening when we took our paddle boards out and went to look at a small island in the middle of the lake I didn’t get off my board but my friend did “hey dude cmon it’s totally chill over here” I just looked off across the lake on the opposite side of our camp “no I’m fine I’m just taking in the view” across the lake I saw it the same thing from my dream those 4 years before except it was real now I saw it on a cliff across the lake I could hear it speak it’s words echoed out to me “you can see me yes.  Very well there’s no need to respond” I turned to look at my friend but he was gone everyone was gone it was just me and it


 “w-what are you” it stared as it walked on the water to me “I’m fate your fate you’ll die” I fell back onto the water but I didn’t sink I looked up at the moon it was blue now the water was blue around it “w-why what did I do why do I have to die” he walked over and looked down at me” you chose to die you give yourself to me in the end under a killing moon much like this one” I stare up at the sky “why why would I ever do that I don’t want to die just go away” and with that he was gone I fell down into the water and my friend laughed at me I didn’t talk much for the rest of that trip and it’d be a few years before I saw it again. 


I can’t remember exactly how old I was at this point or what grade I was in but I think I was about 13 or 14. Earlier when i mentioned my childhood house would be important later this is what I meant it was a 2 story house some 7 miles out of town there was maybe 4 or 5 houses around it and tons of farm land along with a trail one end went past a storage yard of some kind and the other went deep into the woods I didn’t like the woods so I stuck to the shorter of the two. It was winter and I was walking out on the trail it had just snowed and I was the first to step foot on it no one else walked the trail that day I was about halfway down when I turned around and saw a tall black shadow maybe 200 yards behind me it didn’t bother me till it sprinted off into a patch of trees when I got back I looked at the trees I saw numbers on the trees. 5. 10. 17. 57. 14. Those were the numbers I saw they didn’t mean anything at that time yet on the last tree I saw a carving of the moon. I was freaked out and it took me a few months till I walked that trial again. 


I was 14 I remember my age this time because like most of my other encounters this was a dream and the first time I told my father about this not like that would change how my story ends. In my dream my parents had a bit summer party I didn’t wanna be there so I walked down the road when I heard 2 voices from the trees I walked into the woods only for it to grow around me it felt like 2 months I was stuck there but really it was maybe a hour and a half. It was always dark in those woods and I saw it that bluish moon looking down on me when I finally made it out and back to my home it was run down burnt and then again was that figure his tall ashen figure glanced down at me “so what do you think of this are you ready to give into your fate now or do you still wish to keep ruining”



I walked to him “I know this is a dream I’m not scared of you anymore so be gone” he left just like that and when I looked down I saw written in blood the numbers. 3. 6. 21. 58. 12. I would wake up after this I had written down the numbers from the first set and I thought it was some sort of code. Needless to say I was wrong and that would only be made known to me later in my life. 
This next part is short so I’ll leave it in as part of the greater whole of this part. 


It was summer 2 years later I was 16 now well 16 and a half and I had one of my friends over she was staying with us for about a week and one night when we were going upstairs we both her a shout from outside “good morning” that’s what it said we were spooked and went into our rooms and talked on the phone till day break. I was 4 times as scared not of the voice but of whose it was. It was that things and now someone else had heard it. I woke up to scratches on my arm more numbers. 1. 3. 12. 19. 7. 


And now I lay here writing this last night I had another dream but it wasn’t I was in that dream I had all those years ago the one I couldn’t remember I saw that thing fate as it called itself my fate. As I looked at it I knew how I recognized its eyes they were mine. But this isn’t one of those tales where I learn the demon this whole time is me some 40 years in the future no he explained why he had my eyes and this is what he said all those years ago when I was 6 when I met that kid when I grabbed the necklace


 “welcome it’s time I explained everything from the moment the universe was created all fates were determined yours wasn’t supposed to end like this that boy would’ve been in your place but your kindness to him it changed things he gave you his fate because right after that when he ran away well it’s time you know what really happened no need to hide these memories anymore” I looked at him” w-what do you mean he left with his mom and dad”   “No he didn’t you watched what happened he went out trying to swim he drowned and after that you stole his necklace it never had anything to do with this it wasn’t a curse. 


You just messed with fate you chose not to save him in order to save yourself the one who was set to die that night was you” it was true the memories all came back to me after that this was the dream I had those many years ago “w-why do I only remember this now why is the current me in something that happened 11 years ago and why. Why do you have my eyes” he walked to me “I see what you see I don’t have your eyes you only have your eyes but I see from them I always have and why do you do you only remember this now well it’s simple I’m not you I’m out of time a wraith of the past I can change your memory however I want to now look over there” 


he points to numbers on a wall. 0. 0. 0. 7. 29.   It was never a code I was how much time I had left and i was down to the last 7 hours “ the killing moon it waits you’ll die tonight”.   “But I’m asleep now how can I die at night”.   “Your not asleep just remembering it all this happened years ago so get your last wishes in order I’ll see you real soon” I snapped back to reality opened up my laptop and began to write this. It’s not a warning or some story to advert you from doing what I’ve done. It’s simply my story now cemented here for all of time. No matter what you do to out run it some form of fate will come for you. Well with that my clocks running out I’ve got about 30 minutes till the moon rises enough time to post this and say my goodbyes. So thank you dear reader for letting my story live on a little while longer
