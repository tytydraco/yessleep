Hey everyone, I need to share something really strange that happened to me while playing Minecraft. I’ve been a dedicated player for years, constantly looking for new mods to improve my gameplay. Recently, I installed the “Distant Horizons” mod, which promised incredible distant rendering of landscapes. It sounded amazing, but what I encountered was anything but.

After installing the mod, I loaded up my favorite survival world. The landscapes were breathtaking. I could see mountains, forests, and oceans like never before. It felt like a new game entirely. Naturally, I decided to explore farther than I ever had before.

That’s when things got weird. I noticed a distant mountain range that seemed to shimmer, almost like a mirage. It didn’t look like a typical Minecraft glitch, so I headed towards it, curious. The closer I got, the stranger it seemed. The mountains weren’t just graphically odd; they felt wrong.

At the base of the mountains, I found a cave entrance that hadn’t been there before. The cave wasn’t natural; its walls were smooth, like something had carved them. My curiosity got the better of me, and I stepped inside with my torch in hand.

The cave was a maze of twists and turns, leading me deeper underground. Strange symbols, glowing faintly, covered the walls. I kept telling myself it was just a mod, but the atmosphere was seriously creeping me out.

Eventually, I found myself in a huge underground chamber with an obsidian structure at its center. This thing was pulsing with dark energy, It wasn't typical Minecraft particles it wasn't 2d either, It looked like thousands of small blocks blending together to form waves around the structure, almost like it was alive. Against my better judgment, I broke the one of obsidian blocks.

Everything warped and twisted around me it felt like Acid Shaders, but 100 times worse. My screen flickered, and suddenly, I was in a nightmarish version of my world. The sky was blood-red, and the landscape was twisted and grotesque. In the distance, I saw these shadowy figures moving around – not the usual mobs, but something much worse, with long limbs and hollow eyes.

I tried to log out, but nothing worked. The commands were unresponsive. The shadowy figures were getting closer, moving in this unsettling, jerky way. I ran back towards the cave, but the world kept shifting, leading me in circles.

Just as one of the figures was about to reach me, I woke up at my desk, drenched in sweat. The game had crashed.

I shut down my computer, trying to shake off the fear. It felt too real, more than just a glitch. I decided to take a break from Minecraft for a few days.

A few days later, I got an email from the mod’s creator (I still don't know how he got my email address) It simply said: “You saw them, didn’t you? Be careful. They know who you are now.”

I haven’t touched Minecraft since. I can’t get the memory of those shadowy figures out of my head. It feels like they’re watching, waiting. Has anyone else experienced anything like this with Distant Horizons, or is it just me?
