The ritual began when I was seven, in that old house on Maple Street. The house where my grandmother lived before us, where she died in the very room that became mine. My parents never told me that part until years later, thinking it would frighten me. As if I wasn't already terrified enough.

My bedroom was at the end of a long, narrow hallway, and my bed sat in the corner where two walls met. The room had been painted a cheerful yellow, sunflower bright, my mother called it, but no amount of paint could mask what lived in the shadows there. I discovered early that walls were friends... Solid, predictable, unable to hide anything behind them. It was the open spaces that terrified me.

The dark wasn't just absence of light in that room. It was presence. It breathed with a rhythm that didn't match mine, exhaling cold air that raised goosebumps along my arms even under heavy quilts. The darkness seemed to pool in the corners, thick as syrup, and sometimes I swear I could see it moving, shifting like smoke given form.

But I learned to manage the dark, to negotiate with it through my nightly routine. Each step was crucial, learned through trial and terror.

First, the legs. Always tucked up, knees to chest, never dangling over the mattress edge. I learned this rule the hard way, the night something brushed against my ankle as it hung innocently over the side. Not a touch, touches are warm, human. This was cold, deliberate, like fingers made of winter air trailing across my skin. The contact lasted only seconds, but it felt like ice water running through my veins. Sometimes I can still feel the cold...

When I yanked my foot back under the covers, gasping, I heard what might have been disappointed sighing from beneath the bed. A sound like wind through dead leaves, but there was no wind in that sealed room. I lay there trembling, listening to small sounds. Rustling, shifting, as if something large was rearranging itself in the confined space below my mattress.

That was the night I understood the bed wasn't just furniture. It was an island, and the floor around it was an ocean filled with things that waited for careless limbs to dangle within reach.

The blanket became my fortress wall. Pulled tight to my throat, tucked around my shoulders, creating a barrier between me and whatever watched from the shadows. Under that cotton sanctuary, I was invisible, or so I desperately hoped. The rules were simple: as long as no part of me extended beyond the blanket's protection, I was safe. But the blanket had to be perfect, sealed tight like a cocoon. I was scared that even the smallest gap might let something in.

I spent countless nights adjusting the edges, making sure every inch of skin was covered. My mother would find me in the morning, drenched in sweat despite the cool autumn air. She worried I would suffocate, but suffocation seemed preferable to whatever waited in the exposed air of that room.

But the wall... That was the hardest lesson of all.

I used to sleep facing inward, toward the wall, thinking if I didn't see them, they couldn't see me. Foolish child logic. As if my seven-year-old eyes could spot danger in that absolute darkness anyway. But one night, as I lay there staring into the void, trying to make sense of shapes that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them, I felt it.

Breath on the back of my neck, slow and measured, far too close to be my own.

The exhale was cold. Each breath seemed to last forever, and I could feel the moisture from it condensing on my skin. The breathing was patient, rhythmic, as if whatever stood behind me had all the time in the world.

I was too terrified to turn around, convinced that if I moved, whatever stood behind me would know I was awake. So I lay frozen, every muscle locked in place, feeling that steady breathing against my skin. I tried to convince myself it was a dream, but dreams don't leave condensation on your neck. Dreams don't make the air temperature drop ten degrees.

I counted the breaths. Twenty-seven. Each one, a small death, each one confirming that I was not alone in that room. When it finally stopped, the silence was somehow worse than the breathing had been. At least the breathing let me know where it was. Now, It could've been anywhere. Now, It could've been right in front of me.

The next night, I turned to face the room, back firmly placed on the wall. It couldn't reach my neck that way. It was better that way, I told myself. Safer. 

The wall couldn't hide anything, it was solid, reliable, painted the same cheerful yellow as always. I could press my head against the cool plaster and imagine I was somewhere else, somewhere safe. But even with my back buried against the wall, I could feel eyes on my neck. Patient eyes. Waiting me to turn in my sleep.

The wall became my security blanket, but it was a false comfort. Because while I couldn't see what watched me, it could see me perfectly. I was like an ostrich with its head in the sand, thinking invisibility worked both ways.

Sometimes, in those small hours when night is deepest, I would hear movement in the room. Soft footsteps that didn't quite match human rhythm, too slow, too deliberate, with an odd shuffling quality that suggested the walker wasn't entirely comfortable with the act of walking. The sound would circle my bed, patient and methodical, like a predator testing the boundaries of its prey's defenses.

Other times, I heard the whisper of something being dragged across carpet. Long, smooth strokes, as if something heavy was being pulled back and forth across my bedroom floor. I tried to convince myself it was tree branches scraping against the house, but we lived on a treeless street, and the sound came from inside the room.

The worst nights were when I heard voices.

They started as whispers, so soft I thought they might be the wind or the old house settling. But gradually, they became clearer, more distinct. Conversations in a language I didn't recognize, words that seemed to crawl into my ears and nest there like spiders. The voices were never quite human, too hollow, too echoing, as if they were coming from somewhere very deep and very dark.

Once, I swear I heard my name whispered in a voice that sounded almost like my grandmother's, but wrong somehow, like an echo of an echo of something that was never quite human to begin with. The voice called to me, patient and loving, trying to coax me into turning around.

"Sarah," it whispered, drawing out the syllables like a song. "Sarah, look at me. I have something to show you."

I squeezed my eyes shut so tight I saw stars, pressed myself harder against the wall until the plaster left marks on my forehead. I knew, with the absolute certainty that only children possess, that opening my eyes would be the last thing I ever did.

I never looked. Never ever looked. Opening my eyes in curiosity was a foolish mistake I did back in the days. Not after the time i saw... her. Blood gushing from her back, pooling the ground, looking at me with big black eyes.

The rules of the room were everything. No limbs outside the blanket. Face the room. Stay perfectly still. Don't respond to voices, no matter how familiar they sound. Don't acknowledge the breathing, the footsteps, the dragging sounds. Pretend to sleep, even when sleep was impossible.

But the entity, for that's what I came to think of it as, was learning too.

As weeks passed, it grew bolder. The breathing became closer, so close I could feel individual droplets of moisture hitting my face. The footsteps grew heavier, more confident. And the voices... the voices began to mimic people I knew with disturbing accuracy.

It spoke with my father's voice, telling me bedtime stories I'd never heard. It whispered in my teacher's voice, praising me for being such a good, quiet student. Once, it spent an entire night speaking in my grandmother's voice, the grandmother who had died in this very room, telling me about the old country and promising that if I just turned around, she would show me pictures.

But I held fast to the rules.

My parents thought I was going through a phase. "All children are afraid of monsters," my mother would say, smoothing my hair and speaking in the bright, dismissive tone adults use when they want to make something go away. She would check under my bed with exaggerated thoroughness, look in my closet, behind my door. "See? Nothing there."

But she never felt those cold fingers testing the edges of the blanket, searching for gaps with the persistence of water finding cracks in a dam. She never heard the breathing that wasn't breathing, or felt the weight of something settling at the foot of the bed, just outside the protective circle of cotton and polyester.

She never saw the footprints.

I found them one morning, pressed into the carpet around my bed. They were strange, too long and narrow to be human, with what looked like claw marks at the tips. They circled my bed three times before disappearing at the wall where I pressed my face each night.

I tried to show my parents, but by the time they came to look, the footprints were gone. The carpet showed no sign of disturbance. They exchanged one of those looks, the kind parents share when they're deciding whether their child needs therapy.

"Maybe we should move your bed away from the wall," my father suggested. "Give you more space."

The suggestion filled me with such terror I couldn't speak. More space meant more vulnerability, more places for it to hide, more directions from which it could approach. The wall was my anchor, my one and only solid point in a that goddamn room.

I threw such a tantrum that they never mentioned moving the bed again.

Winter came early that year, and with it, the activity in my room intensified. The breathing became constant, no longer limiting itself to the deep hours of night. I could feel eyes on me from the moment I entered my bedroom until I left for school the next morning. The temperature in the room dropped so dramatically that my parents called a heating repair service, but the technician found nothing wrong with the system.

"Probably just air circulation issues," he said, but I saw him glance around the room with troubled eyes, rubbing his arms as if he too felt the unnatural cold.

The voices multiplied. Now instead of one speaker, I heard whole conversations, debates conducted in that same hollow, echoing tone. They discussed me like I was an object, a puzzle to be solved.

"She never looks," one voice complained. "Always the wall, always hiding."

"Patience," another replied. "She'll turn eventually. They always do."

"What if she doesn't? What if she grows up still hiding?"

A pause, then laughter like wind chimes made of bone. "She can't hide forever. And we have so much time."

I was never sure if they knew I could hear them.

One time, I started sleeping with a pillow over my head, but somehow the voices found their way through goose down and cotton, seeping into my ears like smoke. I began to dread bedtime with a fear so profound it made me physically sick. I would vomit before going upstairs, my body rejecting the very idea of another night in that room.

My parents took me to doctors. Pediatricians who prescribed vitamins, specialists who tested for everything from food allergies to neurological disorders. Nothing they found explained the nausea, the weight loss, the dark circles under my eyes that made me look like a tiny ghost haunting my own life.

One doctor suggested I might be experiencing night terrors, and prescribed medication that was supposed to help me sleep more deeply. But deeper sleep meant being less alert, less able to maintain the rules that kept me safe. The first night I took the medication, I felt myself slipping into unconsciousness despite every instinct screaming at me to stay awake.

I woke up lying on my back, facing the ceiling, my arms outside the blanket.

I had never been so terrified in my life. The rules had been broken, my defenses compromised, and I was alive. The thing that haunted my room could have done anything while I lay there, drugged and helpless. 

But I was untouched, unharmed.

I felt something odd too. I was actually not tired for once.

That was when I figured the most terrifying truth of all: It didn't want to hurt me while I was sleeping.

It wanted me awake. It wanted me aware. It fed on my fear, my vigilance, my nightly ritual of terror. I wasn't protecting myself with my rules, I was participating in some cosmic game where I was both player and prize. When I was asleep, they couldn't get me, they couldn't feed off of me, they couldn't hurt me.

But knowing this didn't make the fear go away. If anything, it made it worse. Because now I understood that every night I lay there, pressed against that wall, I was giving it exactly what it wanted. And yet I couldn't stop. The alternative, facing it, looking at it, acknowledging its presence, was unthinkable.

Three months later, we moved.

My parents never gave me a real reason for the sudden departure. They spoke vaguely about job opportunities and better school districts, but I saw the relief in their eyes when the moving truck pulled away from Maple Street. They had felt it too, maybe not consciously, but on some primal level that recognized wrongness when it pressed against the boundaries of normal life.

We moved to the big city of our state. My new doctor was actually more attentive too! I told him everything. What I saw, what it was like to go to sleep, what I heard... He took notes and told me he'd give me a stronger sleeping pill that might cause some side effects. Moreover, our new house was bright and modern, with large windows and open floor plans. My new bedroom was in the middle of the house, surrounded by other rooms, other people. There were no dark corners, no shadows that seemed deeper than they should be. The first night I slept there, I forgot to follow the rules.

I woke up facing the room, arms flung wide, one leg dangling off the edge of the bed, blanket on the ground. And nothing happened. No cold breath, no whispered voices, no skeletal fingers testing my skin. Just normal darkness, the kind that was simply absence of light rather than presence of something else.

I cried with relief.

For years, I thought I had escaped. I slept normally, dated normally, went to college and built a career and fell in love. Eventually, I figured I didn't need to take my sleeping pills anymore. They were doing weird things to my body anyway. I stopped taking them. I convinced myself that whatever had haunted the house on Maple Street had been tied to that place, locked within those walls like a ghost in chains.

But places aren't the only things that can be haunted.

The house on Maple Street is gone now, demolished years ago to make room for a shopping center. I went to see the construction site once, drawn by morbid curiosity and a need to prove to myself that it was truly over. Where my bedroom had been, they built a small coffee shop with cheerful yellow walls—the same shade as my childhood room.

I ordered a latte and sat at the table that occupied roughly the same space where my bed used to be. Around me, normal people conducted normal business, students studying, couples chatting, office workers checking email. Nothing supernatural, nothing wrong. Just the ordinary hum of human activity.

But as I sat there, I felt the familiar chill creeping up my spine. The coffee shop seemed to grow quieter, the cheerful chatter fading to a distant murmur. And then, barely audible under the noise of espresso machines and casual conversation, I heard it.

Breathing. Patient and cold, with that same smell of rotting autumn leaves.

I left without finishing my coffee.

That night, for the first time in twenty years, I returned to the old rules. Legs tucked tight, back to the wall, blanket pulled high. My husband asked if I was feeling alright, and I lied and said I was just cold.

Because I had learned something terrifying in that coffee shop: some things aren't tied to places. Some things are tied to people. And whatever had chosen me in that yellow bedroom on Maple Street had never really let me go.

It had simply been waiting for the right moment to remind me that I belonged to it.

Now, lying in bed each night with my grown-up husband sleeping beside me, I still feel it. That presence. Patient as winter, cold as forgotten graves, persistent as hunger. It whispers to me sometimes, in voices I recognize and voices I don't. It tells me stories about the other children who learned the rules, who spent their nights pressed against walls and hidden under blankets.

It tells me about the ones who eventually looked.

I keep my legs tucked tight. I keep my back to the wall. I keep the blanket pulled high.

Sometimes, in the deepest part of night, when my husband's snoring is steady and the world is quiet, I hear something else breathing too. Something that has been waiting patiently for thirty years, counting down the nights until I finally get tired of hiding.

Until I finally turn around.

But not tonight. Tonight I'll follow the rules, just like I always have, just like I always will.

Because the alternative is unthinkable and somewhere in the darkness behind me, I know it's smiling. After all, I learned long ago that some childhood fears never leave you. They just learn to wait for your vulnerable moment.

...

Maybe I should go back to taking my sleeping pills.
