This happened many years ago on a long-haul flight to London. I was working as crew on a Boeing 777.

Our crew rest area is hidden below the main cabin — a narrow, dimly lit space with six bunks, nestled beside part of the cargo hold. You reach it by climbing down a steep set of ladder-like stairs, and once you’re inside, the outside world fades. No passenger noise. Just muffled engine hum. Time slows down there. It always feels like you’re farther away from the aircraft than you really are.

Near the end of our scheduled rest, the rest of the crew climbed out early. Most of them wanted to beat the queue for the lavatories and freshen up before service resumed.

I decided to stay a few minutes longer. I’d set my alarm just five minutes later than theirs. Just enough time to gather my things without a rush.

When it buzzed, I sat up slowly. My body was still heavy from sleep. I reached for my phone, torch, and ID pouch, quietly going through the routine I’d done dozens of times before.

Then I paused and looked around the bunk space.
All the curtains were open.
The lighting was dim, but clear.
The space was silent.
I was alone.

I was the last to leave.

I started climbing the stairs. The angle is so steep you have to grip both handrails and face upward, which means your back is always toward the bunks.

Halfway up, I heard it.

Shhhkk.

The unmistakable sound of a curtain sliding shut.

I froze mid-step. My hand gripped the rail tight.
I had just looked. Every curtain had been open.
No one else was down there.
Nothing should’ve moved.

I stayed completely still, listening — hoping it was just my imagination, trying not to breathe too loudly.

And then, from somewhere beneath the floor — not far, maybe directly in the cargo hold — I heard it.

Knock.
Knock.
Knock.

Even. Deliberate. Slow.

Not the sound of luggage shifting.
Not turbulence.
It was too steady for that. Too intentional.

I didn’t want to look. But I did.

Just slightly. Over my shoulder. Just enough to see a sliver of shadow down below.

And in that moment, I thought I saw it.
A figure. Still. Upright.
Standing exactly where the curtain had just moved.

I turned back toward the stairs, climbed faster, stepped through the open hatch — and shut the crew bunk door behind me.

I didn’t say a word.

That night, during the layover, the captain mentioned something over dinner that made me froze.

“We had HR on that flight.”
“Body repatriation. They loaded it into the cargo hold before departure.”

I couldn’t finish my meal.
I couldn’t sleep that night.
And I’ve never stayed last in the bunk again.

Stories like this don’t go in the flight log — but they don’t go away either. I’ve started collecting them at r/Darkskieschronicles — for those who’ve heard the knock too.
