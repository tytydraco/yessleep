(Animal Abuse TW)

This happened when I was still in high school but I think enough time has passed for me to finally write about the scariest day of my life.  

It started when my friend’s dog went missing. She lived near the end of town and by some woods. She worried that Lucky slipped under the fence and then got lost in the small forest. We’ve heard coyotes in the trees before and it made us worried Lucky might get attacked by them. It started to get dark when she called me begging for some help looking through the woods. I agreed and got into the junker of my car to drive over.  

We wasted no time. We took some supplies for the search. Some treats, a baseball bat in case we ran into danger in the woods and some flashlights. I was prepared to be out all night if I had to. Lucky had medical issues and needed to get home in a day or so or else he might not make it. 

Megan and I called out to him, shaking the treat bag just praying the little guy would come running. A small dirt road large enough for a car cut through the woods. Sometimes people drove down it to get to the large pond to fish. We crossed the road looking for any paw prints or traces Lucky had been there.   

As we kept walking a smell drifted on the breeze. I knew the cause of this smell, but Megan didn’t.  

“How about you stay here for a second?” I suggested.  

She made a distraught expression but nodded holding the treat bag tightly in her hand.  

Lucky had disappeared three hours ago. I didn’t think he was the cause of the rotting smell in the trees. But I didn’t want my friend to see a dead animal when she was already stressed out. I made the right choice. I’ll never forget what I saw in those woods.  

I saw the pile from a few feet away. My heart stopped as bile rose to my throat. I didn’t want to keep moving closer, but I needed to know if Lucky was there. I closed the distance to stop in front of a pile of dead animals. I blinked away tears as I looked over the bodies of all different sizes of dogs and cats. All of which had countless wounds made from sharp teeth. My chest grew so tight I almost couldn’t breathe when I noticed the smaller animals had been spray-painted before their death.   

At least there was no Lucky. 

This was a dumping ground for a dog fighting ring. By looking for Megan's lost best friend, we stumbled on something far more serious.  

A chill ran up my spine as if I was being watched. I feared that whoever dumped these poor innocent animals may somehow know they had been discovered. After taking out my phone I quickly took photos in case someone came back to clean up. I then rushed back to my friend telling her we needed to call the police all while trying not to scare her.  

We waited for them at her place. It took them hours to show up. I know they’re busy, but this was a mass grave we were talking about. Even after I showed them the photos the two officers appeared dismissive of how serious this was. No matter how frustrated I felt, I stayed calm. They would give us a hard time if we gave them a reason to. After that mentally and emotionally draining night, I went home feeling as if I wasn’t able to do anything useful.  

Turns out, Lucky lived up to his name. He hadn’t slipped under the fence like we first thought. Someone dognapped him from Megan’s yard and sold him within the next few hours to an unsuspecting family. Because he was so small they thought he was still a puppy. When he started showing signs of his medical issues, they rushed him to the vet who checked for a chip. The ones who stole him weren’t caught but Lucky had returned home.  

At least one good thing happened. I tried calling to ask for a follow-up about the mass grave we found in the forest. The cops weren’t giving me any straight answers. It was frustrating. It wasn’t as if they weren’t telling me anything in fear of it ruining the case, but rather it felt like they weren’t even bothering to investigate what we found.   

Just in case I was letting my feelings get in the way assuming the cops weren’t doing their job, I went back into the woods. Only a few days had passed, and I expected the horrible sight to be cleaned up. To my horror, the dumping site was the same. We showed it to the police, and they did nothing. Didn’t they need to take the bodies as evidence? Do some tests? Or was that all something crime shows made up?   

I compared the photos I’d taken and confirmed not a single thing had been moved since I was there last.   

Acid boiled in my stomach. Such deep anger I’ve never felt before washed over me. If the cops weren’t going to do anything, then I would. Megan was too caring of a person to deal with this. She cried all night not just because Lucky was missing but because we found poor dead pets in the middle of the woods. This would hurt her too much.   

I couldn't get my father involved either. He had enough to worry about trying to support us now that my mother was gone.   

No, I was going to do this on my own. But first, I needed to do something.  

After getting some gloves and a shovel from home, I went back to the grave site. It wasn’t a real grave site until I was finished. Hot tears stung my eyes as I ensured every animal that had been discarded got a proper burial. A few times I stopped to get sick behind the trees. The smell and sights of these poor creatures were too much to handle. The anger I felt disappeared. By the time I buried the last one, I felt so tired and hurt I nearly couldn't take it.   

No amount of hot water washed away the feeling of carrying their small bodies. Nor was I able to cover up the smell of rotten flesh with soap. I took the next school day off trying to recover enough to focus on what I needed to do.  

Since I was a teenager without that many resources, I didn’t even know where to start. Just looking up ‘local dog fighting rings’ wouldn’t get me anywhere. Should I talk to shelters? Or veterinarians? What if the leader of the ring catches on that I’m snooping before I collect enough proof of their crimes? Would I be risking my and my father’s lives over this?  

I silently asked Lucky to share part of his name with me as I got started looking. Since the bodies were dumped nearby, I assumed the ones reasonable weren’t in this town. Why dump evidence of your crimes in your own backyard? Knowing that much didn’t help. Didn’t dog fighting rings need a lot of space? I suppose now with live streaming people don’t need to go there, but they need somewhere to keep the dogs. Somewhere that the noise wouldn’t get reported.  

A friend of mine had mentioned he liked to explore abandoned buildings. He joined a local Facebook group that made posts about which buildings are safe and which ones aren’t. I requested an invite and he gladly let me into the group. I then started asking around if anyone knew of some out-of-the-way buildings that suddenly had people using them. The right person saw my post and directed me to an abandoned turkey farm they assumed had been bought. In the past three months he’d seen a lot of cars parked outside, and yet no work had been done to fix up the place.  

This was the lead I needed. On the next Friday night, I dressed in a dark hoodie and borrowed a small switchblade my father used for work. I planned to just record and get the hell out of there after I had enough proof of what I suspected. Since my father worked late, I left a note saying I would be at Megan’s that night. I hated lying to him, but I needed to do this.  

The farm was almost an hour away. I wondered if I even had enough gas to get back home. I found a spot to park and started on foot the rest of the way to the farm. After five minutes of walking, I carefully made my way to the back of the building. It was a very long one-level building with rows of windows on the side. One was broken letting me see inside. I heard confirmation of my suspicions before I saw it.  

A small crowd has gathered by a round pen made of chicken wire. The floor was nothing but packed dirt and garbage. Ten kennels with barking dogs were set off to the side, the poor things going feral seeing the crowd. Smaller cages were stacked on top as people looked inside gauging what their bets should be. A man wearing a suit jacket stood off to the side smoking with two others sticking nearby. He looked like the leader of the entire operation. I quickly got out my phone to record as much as I could trying to get clear shots of faces.   

I considered leaving then. But deep down I knew I needed footage of a fight to be taken seriously. If the bodies in the forest weren’t enough to get the cops to move, then I needed something they couldn’t ignore. My heart sank as two dogs were dragged from the kennels and tied on opposite sides of the fenced-in area. Their skinny bodies were covered with scars from past fights. I was disgusted by the excited faces in the crowd. My emotions caused me to not be as careful as I should have been.   

By the time I heard the footsteps racing towards me, it was too late. Two men twice the size of me came running out of the darkness. I tried to flee but they easily caught up. One grabbed my arms and painfully yanked them behind my back as the other smashed my phone to pieces under his boot. I kicked and screamed while they dragged me to the door to inside the building. The other man had to grab my ankles to help get me inside faster.   

Not a single person even seemed to care about two people manhandling a teenage girl. They were just annoyed the fight was delayed. I was forced in front of the older man wearing the suit jacket. Knowing no help was coming, I settled down enough for the second man to let go of my feet.  

“Now what do we have here?” The leader asked very amused by the turn of events.  

“She had her phone out. We should go, maybe she was live-streaming this.” The man who still held my arms said.  

The Leader shook his head, not at all worried.  

“The network out here sucks. It’s one of the reasons why I picked the place.” He said and then directed his attention towards me. “Now sweetheart, what’s your name? How about we call your parents to come pick you up?” He sneered.  

I bit my lip furious at how stupid I acted. I refused to let them know anything about me. I didn’t bring my ID and my phone wasn’t an option. I couldn’t cause any trouble for my father.  

“Her name is Sofia Lopez. She’s the girl who found your dumping site.” Another voice added.  

I turned my head to look at the man who spoke, but I didn’t recognize him. But I knew he must be an officer to know that information. No wonder the cops acted the way they did. Some of them had been in on the whole thing. The leader smiled and leaned in close to whisper his next words only loud enough for me to hear.  

“No one is going to miss you with a last name like that.”  

I lashed out and kicked him as hard as I could. He jumped back holding his shin laughing over my outburst. The man holding me started to search my pockets. He found the knife and handed it over to his boss who recovered from the weak assault.   

“She’s cute. Let’s use her for tonight.”  

“What does that mean?” I demanded fear getting the better of me.  

The man dragged me away and to the pen near the door. I was shoved inside, and I scrambled to the middle of the pen away from the snapping jaws of the chained dogs. My knife was tossed into the pen within arm’s reach causing the small crowd to cheer.  

“Place your bets! Will she kill the animals she loves so much? Or will she be mauled by the dogs she wanted to save?” The boss called out causing more noise to erupt through the crowd.  

I snatched up the knife with trembling hands and held it close to my chest. This couldn’t be happening. Why didn’t I bring someone along with me? Why didn’t I tell someone where I was going? Why was I so stupid? These people will kill me, dump my body somewhere, and move on. There was no paperwork connecting them to the scene of the crime even if someone tracked down my last known location to this place.  

My teeth started to chatter together as my shoulders shook. The barking of the dogs on either side drowned out the rest of the noise. If I killed them, would they let me go? No. I saw their faces. I was dead no matter what.  

I looked at the poor feral animals frothing at the mouth wanting to rip my throat out. I felt sorry for them. They never wanted this. They should have been adopted into a caring family, or on a farm doing a good job. The people who turned them into this were monsters. And I couldn’t stop them.  

Tears blurred my vision. I heard someone counting down to when the chains would be released. I let the knife drop from my hands as I mentally apologized to my father for getting stuck with a stupid daughter. With my eyes tightly shut, I heard the person counting hit zero, then the chains hit the dirt floor. Then, nothing.  

The animals stopped making any noise. It confused the crowd enough to settle down. When I opened my eyes again, I saw the two dogs that had been going insane a second before stock still. Every muscle tense as they stared towards the open door.   

The doors of the kennels and cages swung open on their own. It caused a few people to murmur in confusion.  Then a smell came into the air. One I knew very well. A stench of rot got closer and closer causing a great deal of people to become uneasy.  

Dark shapes came into view just outside the door. They walked into the light, but most people didn’t believe what they were seeing. Even I doubted my eyes at first. A pack of dogs stood just inside the large open door, their cloudy eyes staring down at the crowd. A few cats joined them, spray paint and dirt covered their fur. Each animal bore terrible wounds and rotten flesh. The only one who didn’t appear to be an undead animal was the leader of the pack. A massive wolf stood, blue eyes blazing with all too human emotion.  

The air became tense as everyone waited unable to process what they were seeing and feeling. A deep fear came over me after I saw the wolf. It settled down into my bones. I think this is what our ancestors felt around the fire staring off into the darkness knowing some unseen predator stared back. This wolf brought a natural fear we had almost forgotten.  

The wolf brought its head back and howled. The sound tore at my chest causing another wave of fear with a hint of sadness. The rest of the undead creatures joined in, then the fighting dogs did as well. The moment the howling stopped; the scene burst into chaos.  

People tried to run as the animals fell on them with claws and teeth. The wolf took off running to block off the ones trying to flee out the back door. It's body appeared to be made of a white flame as it ran herding the crowd back into the wall of death. The scent of blood and rotten flesh became almost overwhelming.  

Someone had a gun and tried to use it. The weapon was useless. Through the screams and yowls of the creatures, I heard the Leader crying for help. I looked over in time to meet his eyes between the bloody crowd. Then the wolf came down on him, teeth easily ripping into flesh.  

Not all the animals had joined the fight. A few that were inside the cages huddled together as scared as I felt. I got to my feet, my legs shaking as I went. I ran over to them praying they understood. A few dogs wagged their tail as I begged them to follow me. I collected six kittens and four dogs with minor scars. The rest of the living fighting dogs were too far gone. They stayed with the undead animals succumbing to their feral side.   

I didn’t look back as I ran outside, a few new friends at my side. I jogged back to my car, my lungs burning. I didn't stop until I opened the back door letting the dogs pile in them carefully set the kittens on the front seat. I didn’t even let myself think about what I’d seen that night as I drove home.  

My father was home when I got in. I didn’t have a story for him. He saw the dogs piling out of my car and the expression on my face. He simply accepted something happened and I wasn’t ready to talk about it. He did ask if I was in trouble, and I answered honestly that I wasn’t sure just yet.  

I think I have one of the best dads on the planet. He helped me get the animals cleaned up. He was ready to accept any consequences of what I did, but until then he would support me the best he could.  

I took time off school as I found the dogs and kitten homes. I expected the police to come breaking down our door any day. When a man wearing sunglasses and a suit came knocking, I was ready to say goodbye to the life I knew.  

My dad let the man talk to me alone for a moment. I stood, tense trying to hide my shaking hands as the man held out a plastic bag containing the remains of my cell phone.  

“I believe this is yours, correct?” He asked but he didn’t sound as scary as I thought he would.  

I nodded and he took off his sunglasses to reveal the bluest set of eyes I’ve ever seen. He got down low so he could be on my level and placed a hand on my shoulder. For an odd reason, I thought he appeared familiar even though I knew I’d never seen his face before.   

“I’m sorry you needed to do an adult's job. I'm glad you’re alright, but please don’t do something that dangerous again.” He smiled.  

I wasn’t expecting him to be so warm and kind. I accepted my broken cell phone to recycle later. He said a quick goodbye and assured me nothing bad would happen because of what I’d gotten involved in. I wondered if I could ever tell my father the full story of what happened. Someday, I might.  

I expected to be arrested or have my life turned upside down afterward. In a way, our lives did change. The day after the man in the suit came by a letter arrived. It was addressed to my father. Somehow, instead of having a working vias he’d become a full citizen. We re-read the letter a hundred times now believing what we were seeing. We even called around official offices to see if this was true.   

I was dumb enough to go after a dog fighting ring alone, but I’m not dumb enough to start asking questions about the good things that happened afterward.
