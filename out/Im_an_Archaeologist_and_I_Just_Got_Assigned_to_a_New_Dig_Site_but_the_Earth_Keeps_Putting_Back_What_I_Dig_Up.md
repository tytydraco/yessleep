**Log 1 - 7:32am - Day 1**

This is my first official entry log for Site K-21, and if the timestamp looks unreasonably early, that’s because it is. I haven’t slept all night because my brain decided that a new job meant I needed to rehearse every possible mistake I might make in the next 48 hours like some kind of anxiety-themed Olympics.

Let me paint the scene for you: I’m sitting in a small, dilapidated office building that creaks every time the desert air rolls through. There is a small, twin sized cot in the corner. A mini fridge is humming next to the desk, with an old, dirty microwave perched precariously on top. The air tastes like dust and metal, like someone left a stack of pennies in the microwave. My issued laptop is giving off that faint but worrying “this thing overheats if you look at it wrong” smell, and outside, stretching beyond the tiny window like a scar on the world, is the excavation pit.

Perfectly round.

Perfectly smooth.

Perfectly wrong.

So I am sitting here typing this on my laptop while I wait for my supervisor to arrive, trying to act like this is normal. Like this is what archaeology is supposed to look like. Like getting a job doing “geological pattern monitoring” for a government agency I’d never heard of isn’t a massive red flag. But the truth is, I would’ve taken anything. I mean it. A sandwich shop, a museum gift shop, hell, even a coal mine. At least coal mines have unions. Instead, the Bureau of Subterranean Antiquities posted a listing on a local government job board urgently hiring a junior excavator. No interview required. Just “report to Site K-21 immediately, all equipment provided.”

That alone should have worried me. It should have reminded me of all the other times someone seemed too eager to have me around. But the desperate part of me, the part that’s spent the last six months refreshing job sites and telling my family “something will come up!” in a voice that sounds increasingly like begging, won. A job, first of all, with room and board included in this economy. How could I refuse? So here I am at a hole in the desert big enough to bury a small house in.

Mom always said the earth calls to us, but I’m starting to stop trusting that instinct. Anyway, enough rambling. I should learn the catalog software before it learns me.



**Log 2 - 5:02pm - Day 1**

Long day. Longer than I expected, considering the three of us here make up the entire workforce of Site K-21. Saying I met the other employees is generous, as witnessed from an awkward distance is closer to what I did. Dr. Mara Havel was waiting for me outside of the office, standing with her arms crossed and her hair tied back in a bun so tight it looked like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. She has the posture of someone who’s been bracing for impact for years, but her voice is soft and warm in a way I didn’t expect from someone who looks like she sleeps with one eye open. She said she was glad to have me. Said they’d been needing “someone steady.” I didn’t know how to tell her I hadn’t felt steady since high school.

Then there’s Cal, the night shift tech, who made a special appearance for my first day. He is… something else. Skinny, hollow eyed, wearing an oversized hoodie in the desert like he’s hiding from the sunlight. Didn’t shake my hand. Barely spoke. Just stared at me like I’d already done something wrong.

The facility itself is clean enough to be unsettling, considering the condition of the office building. Everything inside is too new, scuffed by use but not by time, almost like it gets replaced each season. There are no personal touches. No posters, no mismatched mugs, no signs of enthusiasm or boredom. The only notable decor is a small potted cactus in the windowsill, and a post-it note stuck to the desk in front of the desk chair with small, scribbled words scratched onto it. It was a list of daily responsibilities.



* Catalog fragments
* Log soil layers
* Note anomalies
* Photograph finds
* Report any subsurface disturbances
* Do not touch materials with bare hands



Seems easy enough. In between logging my findings from the site I should be able to keep up with this digital diary of sorts. The internet here is spotty, so I can’t promise I will stay consistent with this online journal, but maybe it will provide me with some entertainment, or the illusion of conversation since it seems to be a pretty tough crowd here. 

Today was just a tour around the small office building, which was really just spinning in a circle to look around the room, and a short walking tour of the dig site. Back in college, I did field work in a swamp once. I thought that was rough. Turns out isolation hits different when it’s baked, silent, and staring at you through a hole.

The pit outside really is perfect. It’s a completely round, circle shaped hole, as if some giant cylinder pressed into the ground and carved downward. The soil layers are unnaturally smooth. There’s no chaotic mixing, no weathering. It looks like it was manufactured or crafted. I asked Mara why it looked that way. She looked at the pit, then at me, and said:

“It wasn’t dug. It was revealed.”

She wouldn’t explain further. I’m starting to understand why this job was so easy to get.
