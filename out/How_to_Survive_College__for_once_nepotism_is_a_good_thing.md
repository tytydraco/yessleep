Maria has already forgotten about [Steven](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12y5lwz/how_to_survive_college_the_cemetery_has_visiting/).  Cassie, surprisingly, has not.  I haven’t told her what happened to him and I don’t intend to.  I mentioned him in passing, she rolled her eyes and was like, ‘ugh, him’ and that was it.  That was all I needed.  I wanted confirmation of who had forgotten him and who hasn’t.

I remain immune and I don’t know why.  And now Cassie appears immune as well.

I’m not doing great right now.  I’m trying to accept that people can make their own choices and I’m not responsible for that, but that insidious voice at the back of my head keeps whispering that he wouldn’t even have been there if not for me.  That I’d dangled something he’d want in front of him just so I’d have someone else that the monsters could go after instead of me.  I feel sick just thinking that way and maybe I’m just making things up so that I can hate myself and justify the guilt I’m feeling.

Or maybe I really am a bad person.

I just… honestly thought he was handling it.  It was like in the computer lab.  He had a plan before I did.  He got us out of there.  And when it all went wrong he reacted immediately.  He didn’t just stand there in a panic like I did and I thought okay, something has changed here and Steven is clearly better at this stuff than I am.

I figured he could stall the groundskeeper.  And that he’d get away before anything bad happened.

Was that my mistake?  Should I not trust anyone other than myself, even though I’m not that reliable either?  Even though I don’t know what I’m doing and I’m not decisive and I’m not ruthless and all I’ve really got going for me is that none of this is new to me.

Doesn’t make me some monster-slaying badass any more than growing up with fire drills makes you a fireman.

So yeah, okay, I let Steven take the lead there but I thought he could handle it.  And I’m not him and I can’t live his life for him so I just *trusted* and now he’s dead.

I’ve been thinking about what to do about Daniel and the worm again.  I know, everyone’s *favorite* problem.  I feel like this is something I can control though, and that I *should* do something about it.  I didn’t stop Steven in time but I can do something about this before the worm tries to eat anyone else.  I can stop being selfish about the flickering man being distracted from his grudge against me.  I messaged Maria and asked if she’d meet me in the student union.  I had something important I wanted her advice on.

She looked miserable when I found her.  Turns out that she did not do so great on her finals and while her GPA was high enough from her first year to pad out the results, she can’t have a repeat this semester.

“This is the only place I got accepted to,” she said miserably.

“Well, it is the only place I got accepted to as well,” I replied, “and I just happen to know who all the good tutors are.”

No, I am not introducing her to the devil.  I had plenty of other people that helped me at the tutoring center prior to him showing up.

“Unfortunately,” I sighed, “you’re not going to like what I have to ask you.  It’s about Daniel.”

She didn’t reply.  She just groaned and buried her head in her arms.  Once she was done with her theatrics, I launched into my explanation of everything that’s happened.  I told her about my encounter with the flickering man.  How he was looking for the student that was the intended victim and that if he needed Daniel’s involvement, that meant that Daniel was still the only person that could do anything about the worm.  

How he’d asked me to give him Daniel’s name.  That’s all he needed.  A name.

Maria stared at me for a minute with a miserable expression on her face when I was done talking.

“You ever been in a situation so bad that you thought the only way out was to make it much, much worse?” she asked.

I can’t say I have, but I just kind of nodded vaguely so she’d keep talking.

“I feel like that right now.  Like, why not?  Let’s kick Daniel over to this flickering man and just… *see what happens.*”

“Remember that note that was shoved under his door?” I said.  “I kind of want to know more about that since it involves me and all.”

“Oh.  Yeah.”

She clearly had not remembered.  She chewed at her lip absently, thinking it over.

“But he won’t know that much,” she finally said.  “He didn’t see who dropped it off, right?”

“Maybe he’s still got it?  We can look at the handwriting?” I suggested.

“Ashley.”  She fixed me with a steely glare.  “How is that going to actually help us?  We have *literally no one* to compare handwriting with - unless you’ve got some suspects you haven’t shared with me.”

I did not.

“I guess I just… don’t want to be like that,” I mumbled, staring at my hands.

“Like what?”

Like Kate.  The kind of person that throws people to the inhumans.  Someone that looks at the trolley problem and says yes, the track with only one person, without hesitation, without looking around to see if there’s an emergency brake or any other alternative than sacrificing a stranger.

“I just don’t want to be responsible for getting him killed,” I said.

“He got someone else killed, but…”  Maria sighed.  “Okay, I get the hesitation.  But are you *sure* that this flickering man is going to kill him?”

“Uh.”

“You could ask.”

Holy shit. 

I could ask.

I shouted something like ‘Maria I love you’ and then grabbed my backpack and ran for it.

The statue that the flickering man had told me to meet him by is a rock on a pedestal.  That’s it.  It’s a rock.  I’m sure it was carved by someone, but not much, because it’s still very…. rock-shaped? and doesn’t look like much of anything.  The whole phallic aspect is more of a campus joke and honestly it’s not a very good one at that.

I’m not sure if the flickering man realized the irony of asking me to meet him at the dick-rock.  Regardless, it’s not a bad spot to meet, because it’s fairly central, being in the middle of one of the greens, but it’s also not a convenient shortcut between any of the buildings so it was unlikely that we’d be interrupted by students walking past.

I didn’t have to wait long.  I stood by the statue and fiddled with my phone for a few moments and then someone cleared their throat behind me.  I hastily shoved my phone back into my pocket and whirled around to face the flickering man.

“Of *course* you pick a day it isn’t raining,” he sighed.  “Make this fast, I’ve got places to be.”

I swallowed hard.  I could do this.  It was just a conversation.  I’ve been practicing those, where I’m confident and firmly state what I want, in the mirror just like the devil had told me to.

“What do you want with this person?” I demanded.  “Are you going to hurt them?”

“Maybe?”  He shrugged.  “Depends on how uncooperative they are.  I’ve found humans tend to be a lot more agreeable once you break a finger or two.”

Okay.  Fine.  My conscience can live with Daniel getting a few bones broken.

“Are you going to kill them?”

“I guess that depends on how much more they piss me off.”  He frowned thoughtfully.  “But if you’re asking if I’m going to kill them as soon as I’m done with the worm, then no.  Conditions have to be fulfilled, after all.  Same reason I haven’t killed you yet.  You’ve found someone, haven’t you?”

“Maybe,” I replied, glancing away so I wouldn’t have to meet his gaze.  “I’ve been asking around and one of my classmates told me something interesting.  But I don’t want them to get killed over this.  Are you going to stalk them like you’ve been doing with me?  Wait for a chance to kill them just because you can?”

“Oh no,” he smiled, “you’re a *special* case.”

Something in me snapped.  I guess practicing in front of the mirror really has paid off.  Anger flickered in my gut because why *does* he hate me so much?  What did I do to him?  *He* started this, out in the rain that first time we met when he whispered those things to me and I don’t understand what he meant but I do know he was singling me out.

“Why?” I snapped.  “What do you have against me?”

He actually looked startled.  Like the rabbit has just whipped around and bitten the hawk.  Then he laughed and raised a hand, running it through his hair and he looked away from me.  His gaze ran across the campus skyline.

“It’s not *you*,” he finally said.  “I don’t like the role you’ve been cast into.  What a weird question.  It won’t change the outcome, so why does it matter if it’s personal or not?”

Obviously it matters very much to us humans, but I didn’t really care about his inability to comprehend that sort of thing because what the *fuck* did he mean by the role I was in?  And I said as much.

“Oh no, you’re not supposed to find that out until it’s *far* too late.  But if I get to kill you first, then I’ll be generous and tell you while you’re dying.”

He smiled and then had the gall to pat me on top of the head like I was a child.

“You going to find out who let the worm out for me, now?  I’ll even let you have a favor for it - within reason, of course.”

“I’ll follow up on the lead I have,” I said quietly.  “I’ll let you know.”

“*Great*.”

He actually sounded relieved.  And… maybe it was my imagination, but he actually looked tired.  There were dark circles under his eyes and his cheeks were gaunt.  Following the worm-student around and making sure he didn’t try to swallow anyone else was apparently taking its toll.

I’ll admit that I felt relieved too.  I could make Daniel his problem with a mostly clean conscience.  I just wanted to talk to Daniel first.  Tell him what was coming for him and warn him to cooperate.  Once I did that, I’d have done everything I could to ensure a good outcome for everyone.  It’d be up to Daniel to make his own choices and live his own life after that.

Naturally I’m anxious as hell about all of this.  There’s so much that could go wrong and then what?  Daniel dies and I get to feel like it’s my fault all over again?

I wound up talking to Grayson about all of this.  I didn’t intend to.  It just kind of happened.  We were doing homework together in my dorm room because my dorm is now the cool hangout spot, thanks to Cassie knowing everyone on campus.  I looked up and noticed that Grayson had stopped reading his textbook and was just staring blankly out the window instead.

I asked if he wanted to go get a coffee or something and he just kept staring, like he hadn’t heard me.  So I said his name, louder this time.  And then he gave a start and apologized, saying he’d just been lost in thought for a moment.

“I was thinking about death,” he said quietly.

How do you even respond to that?  I stared at him for a few moments and then went with the obvious question of if everything was okay or not.

He’s fine.  His dad is not.  The deterioration has been accelerating for a while now.  He’s worried that if it keeps up like this, he’s only got a few years left.

“I’m not *ready* yet,” Grayson said tightly.

“I wasn’t ready either,” I said quietly.  “When my dad died.”

“It makes me angry,” he murmured, “to know that some of us have to die so much sooner than everyone else.”

There’s no way to comfort someone in a situation like this.  I remember the things my classmates said to me and they *meant* well but it didn’t help.  Not really.  It just felt like something I had to claw my way through, one day at a time, because there was nothing that could bring him back and nothing that could make it any easier.  It was an event that had to be *endured*.  There was nothing I could say that would bring Grayson any peace.

“I’ve been thinking about death too,” I said.

I told him about Steven.  How he died in the graveyard and it was so sudden and senseless.  After that… I just kept going.  I told him about how the flickering man has been stalking me and I’m terrified that he’s going to eventually kill me.  I barely allow myself to think of that fear, but I blurted it right out to Grayson.  

I’m scared I’m going to die.

We just sat in miserable silence for a bit after that, because really, there was nothing either of us could say that would sound like comfort.  At least we could admit these things to each other.  At least we weren’t carrying our fears and worries all by ourselves now.  

Then it started raining.  It wasn’t even the warning drizzle, either, just one moment it was overcast (hardly unusual around here) and the next moment it was pouring.  That happens sometimes and it’s always a problem when it does.  I think of these as the ‘bad rains’, the ones that are most likely to have something harmful accompanying them.  Like the rain is trying to trap students out in the open.

“Well this sucks,” I muttered.  “I guess you can wait it out?”

“It’s going to stop anytime soon.”  He glanced up from checking the forecast on his phone.  “It’s fine.  I’ll just run home.”

“No!”

He flinched and so did I, embarrassed by how forcefully it had come out.  I swallowed back my emotions and tried again, with a more level tone this time.

“I just don’t want anything to happen to you,” I said.  “Not after watching Steven die.  He thought he’d be fine too.”

He agreed to wait for a bit and see if it tapered off.  After an hour, it showed no sign of stopping.  Cassie was back by this point, so at least we had her to help think of ideas when Grayson pointed out that it was getting late and he needed to go home at some point.

“We can take the steam tunnels,” Cassie suggested.

“No way,” Grayson said quickly.  “Last time I was in there you had to pull me out of an angry cloud of overheated steam.”

Right.  The steam ghost.  And he wasn’t seriously hurt, but we’d gotten lucky that time and I didn’t blame him for not wanting to try his luck a second time.  I was about to suggest getting a rideshare when Cassie shrugged and said there was no helping it then, he’d just have to spend the night on our futon.  She’d give him a keycard so he could go up to the men’s floor for the bathroom and Josh could tell him the keycode.

Grayson didn’t look entirely thrilled about this but he didn’t have any good reasons to protest.  It wasn’t like having a guy sleeping over in our room was that big of a deal, it happened all the time in the dorms.  Cassie got him the keycode, we gave him our extra blankets for the futon, and that was all there was to it.

Still felt weird though.  In the “I’m having a sleepover with friends and feel like I’m eight years old again” kind of way, not the “oooo my boyfriend is sneaking over better hope my parents don’t find out” kind of way.

I guess that’s why I woke up when something came into our room.  I wasn’t sleeping very soundly to begin with.

I heard the click of a door latch and at first I thought it was Grayson, but then the door didn’t close again and I thought groggily that I should make sure the door was shut and he hadn’t left it hanging open by accident.  This was important, I thought, though I wasn’t quite awake enough to remember why.

I opened my eyes and looked down through the slats of the loft towards the door.  

And framed in the doorway was something human, but not, its clothing was mere patterning on its skin and its fingers were far too long.  Like a frog’s, wrapped around the doorframe as it peered inside.

The door had been shut, I thought frantically.  It was.  I heard the lock click open.  

It could get inside anytime it pleased.

It slowly swiveled its head back and forth, looking between first Cassie and then over to me.  I lay there, heart pounding, not wanting to move at all in case it noticed that I had woken up.  I’d gotten rid of it last time by screaming, but this time it felt like there was a hand around my throat.  I couldn’t scream even though I *was* screaming, in the back of my head.  Like I was still half-asleep and my body hadn’t finished reconnecting with my conscious mind.

Maybe it hadn’t.  I’ve frozen in fear before, but this… this was different.  I felt like I was drowning in fear, like everything had spun up into a panic state in my mind but now it had nowhere to go, so it flooded my mind and I thought my heart would stop right then and there.

It stepped into the room.  It stretched out a hand, reaching for the edge of my loft bed with those long, flattened fingers.

“That’s far enough,” Grayson said quietly from the futon.

The creature froze.

“Do you know me?” he continued, sounding darkly amused.  “I didn’t want to use who I am like this, I just wanted to be a normal student, but… I kind of like that one.”

The creature slowly withdrew its hand.

“That’s right,” Grayson said.  “Make smart choices, now.”

And the creature slowly backed out of the room.  I heard Grayson laugh softly, incredulously, as if he was amazed that had actually worked.  Then I heard him stand.  I quickly squeezed my eyes shut and I felt a slight shift of the bed as he grabbed hold of the railing and peered through the bars.  Making sure I was asleep.  Then I heard him move away and I opened my eyes to watch as he did the same thing to Cassie.  Satisfied, he then went to the door and closed it, jiggling it on the frame to make sure that the latch had caught properly.  Then he went back to the futon and lay down again.  It didn’t take long before his breathing was steady and slow.

The rain stopped sometime in the night.  In the morning Grayson had breakfast with Cassie and I and then went back to his dorm to get ready for class.  He didn’t say anything about the monster and I don’t know if it’s because he doesn’t want to alarm us or if it’s because he doesn’t want to admit he has special treatment - even from the inhuman - as the son of the university president.

But I know.  I heard everything.

More importantly - Grayson now knows he can use his status as the president’s son against the inhumans.  And I told him about the flickering man trying to kill me.

And Grayson *likes* me. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
