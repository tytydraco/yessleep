This happened years ago, but some nights I still wake up in a cold sweat thinking about it. And honestly, I wouldn't blame you if you think I'm full of shit. If I wasn't there myself, I wouldn't believe it either. If this sounds like dementia, I get it. That’s what we thought too. At first. 

My grandfather was a tough old bastard. The kind of guy who never smiled in photos. He was born in a small village in Uttar Pradesh, and he hated the British with every fiber of his being. Not like the casual kind of disdain you see in textbooks or documentaries—no, this man hated them. 

He used to say his father—my great-grandfather—was killed during the rebellion of 1942. Beaten to death in front of his own wife and son by British soldiers. My grandfather saw it all. He was eight years old. He never forgot that. Never forgave it. He’d curse the British every chance he got, even well into the 2000s, when nobody gave a damn anymore. 

The hate calcified. He never learned English. Never watched anything foreign. He spit on the ground whenever a British tourist came through our neighborhood. I thought it was just old rage that never cooled. 

But what I didn’t know—what none of us knew—was that he had a routine. 

Every morning, after his walk, he’d stop by the old British cemetery two blocks from our house. He’d stand by the rusted gate, stare at the crumbling headstones, and curse the names out loud. Every. Single. Day. 

It was uncomfortable. He’d stand there, shouting at gravestones like they could hear him. I told him it was pointless. Disrespectful. Maybe even dangerous, spiritually. He laughed in my face.“They deserve worse than words,” he said. “They stole lives. They stole years.” Some of us thought he was just a relic. Bitter and stuck in time. But then—he changed. He started acting...strange.  

It began subtly at first. One day, during tea, he corrected my grammar in English with a British accent.Not a desi-English accent. It was clipped. Polished. We all laughed, assuming he was mimicking someone.But he didn’t laugh back. He just looked at us like we were being unruly schoolchildren.  

After that, it kept happening. one afternoon, he asked my mother for tea—but the way he said it stopped us cold. 

“Strong. No sugar. And kindly be quick about it, Woman.” 

I stopped dead in the hallway. He never spoke English. He refused to. It wasn’t the words. It was the voice—tight, formal, British.  

He stopped calling my grandmother Amma. Started calling her “the woman.” Told my uncle to “fetch the paper and make it quick.” When we’d ask him what he was talking about, he’d look confused for a second—like he was waking from a dream—and then shake it off, muttering in Hindi. 

My mother blamed it on age. Said maybe the memories of the past were blurring together. 

In the following days, it got worse. He refused to eat with his hands. Demanded “silverware befitting a gentleman.”  and refused to eat Indian food, demanding toast, butter, and black tea at set hours. When my mom tried to bring him daal, he snapped, “What kind of servant brings mush to an officer?”  

But the scariest part? He stopped cursing the British. Not even once. 

We tried to get him evaluated. The doctor suggested early-onset Alzheimer’s. But he never forgot who we were. He remembered names, dates, events. He just... stopped being himself. 

We believed it was dementia.But that theory fell apart the night I caught him standing in the backyard, barefoot in the mud,hands clasped behind him, like he was inspecting something. 

I called out, softly: “Dadaji(Grandpa)?” 

He didn’t react. 

I stepped closer. His lips moved, whispering something. 

I leaned in. 

“...Ungrateful lot. We brought them rails, roads, reason—and they repay us with rebellion. Insufferable wogs…Form ranks. Steady now. We’ll strike at dawn. Keep the natives confused.” 

I froze.  

His tone wasn’t emotional. It wasn’t angry. It was the tone of someone issuing a routine command. 

“Dadaji,” I said again, louder this time. 

He turned his head slowly toward me. His eyes didn’t seem to recognize me at first. Then something softened. “Rrrohit?” he whispered. “What am I doing out here?” 

I helped him back inside. He was shaking, and his palms were ice cold. 

The episodes grew longer. He stopped recognizing parts of the house, referred to the backyard as "the southern perimeter,” and asked if the “sepoys” had been accounted for. Once, when my little cousin ran into the room playing with a toy gun, my grandfather flinched and shouted, “Cease fire!” 

We stopped letting the kids near him after that. 

The doctors said maybe some PTSD resurfacing in old age. But no one in our family had ever seen anything like it. Not just memory loss—replacement. He wasn’t just forgetting who we were. He was remembering someone else’s life. 

Then one evening, as the sun was setting, he asked me to sit with him alone. 

He was calm. More lucid than I’d seen him in weeks. 

“They never left, you know,” he said. 

“Who?” I asked. 

“The ones in uniform. Some died here angry. Confused. They thought they were helping. Building roads. Teaching manners. When they realized they weren’t wanted, some… refused to go.” 

He looked me dead in the eye. 

“I hated them. I still do. But hate… hate opens doors too.” 

I didn’t know what to say. I still don’t. 

That was the last real conversation I had with him. A week later, he stopped speaking entirely. Just sat staring out the window, eyes locked on something none of us could see. And then, one morning, he was gone.
