Hello people of reddit, from the title you can already guess what I’m about to share. 

It started on 7/10/24, a month ago essentially. I got home from a long day of doing something which I forgot, but basically I went to bed telling my mom goodnight before I slept you know, the usual routine. By the way was at 6:49 pm. 
So I went to bed sleeping straight, I kinda did it to myself because I knew I get sleep paralysis if I sleep straight most of the time but it was the only way I could make myself fall asleep. 

Anyways.. I woke-up 2 hours later, I felt sweaty and scared. I grabbed my phone telling what I am currently telling you right now what happened. Basically: In the dream I got out of bed, I suppose you could say I was lucid dreaming because I knew what was happening but couldn’t leave. I walked over to my desk and I have a big stand of an LED light, plugged it in and turned it on. I walked outside of my bedroom. When you walk out of my bedroom on the right side you will see the stairs and on the wall is my parents room. I didn’t see anyone of my family members but I saw a little girl all in black standing at the staircase looking at me, I can’t see her eyes at all shes just there. I felt frightened and shocked and I started carefully moving along the wall behind me and I know this sounds childish but I sat in the corner of the room and covered my face from seeing her.

Next thing I knew it I was waking up, but I was paralyzed. I was like “oh my gosh whatever I’ll wait till this stops”, now I don’t feel anything I just sit there trying to open my eyes but most of the time it doesn't work so I brush it off and wait for it to end. This particular experience was different.. I couldn't avert my eyes straight and my head was stuck turning to the right  as I felt someone or SOMETHING was tucking my feet in. I thought it was one of my family members because sometimes my brothers bother me when I sleep but I saw nothing standing at the foot of my bed. Mind you I also have a canopy bed with curtain, but if I was to enter through the foot of my bed the curtains would need to be moved but it wasn’t. (By the way I had the blanket on as well) I could feel it, it was completely scaring me but a little comforting but I was absolutely frightened because I don’t typically experience  anything with sleep paralysis. I immediately woke up, turned on my lamp all the way on my nightstand but too scared to open my curtains because of how scared I was. I laid in bed for a few minutes before getting out and turning all my lights on. For the rest of the night I couldn’t sleep.

I did experience this twice but the second time I got out of it. I sometimes sleep with my cross on, but on that night I was not wearing it. I hope you enjoyed my story : )!! I will definitely update if I ever get another experience.
