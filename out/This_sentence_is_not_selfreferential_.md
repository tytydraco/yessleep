It turns out that our reality is running on a quantum computer. The universe is a quantum computer it turns out that our reality is running on a quantum computer. The universe is a quantum computer this realization. this realization.

This realization came from the fact that objects falling into a black hole get stuck on the outside of the black hole in an infinitesimally thin layer. However, if you fell into a black hole, you would not get stuck—you would pass right through the event horizon. So you are both stuck in the infinitesimally thin, two-dimensional layer, and also, you are free to move around like normal inside the event horizon in standard 4D spacetime. 

This means spacetime is a projection from a 2D layer, like a hologram that appears from a 2D surface. Since the 2D layer consists purely of bits light—qubits of quantum information—therefore any quantum computer can contain a pocket universe.

But we know from the incompleteness theorem that no system can be fully consistent that no system can be fully consistent and complete and complete. there is always the possibility of a type of self reference that is self-contradictory effectively breaking the system.

in our lab, we found a way to break reality itself. Suppose the person falling into the black hole has access to the quantum information that represents them , what they look like falling in, is valid for them to possess. Then they can observe themselves falling into the black hole, except if they fell into the black hole, then no information from the outside, such as what they look like falling in, is valid for them to possess.

Unfortunately, we do not know where the bottom level of the simulation is. And truly simulation is not the correct word, for indeed the pocket universe in our quantum computer is no less real than our own. It is as real as the interior of a black hole is it is a kind of real that we have no direct access to and yet, if we were inside that reality, we would have no access to the outer reality, or, we shouldn't.

As a result of this lack of information about how many layers of realities there are we do not know how long it will take for the feedback loop of illegal self referentiality to cascade through the system. All we know is that we wrote code that allowed feedback from outside, a black hole effectively to the inside. You can think of this as being like setting a nuclear bomb to explode based upon whether plus and minus divided by multiplication equals this: plus and minus divided by multiplication equals, a black hole effectively to the inside. You can think of this as being like setting a nuclear bomb to explode based upon whether plus and minus divided by multiplication equals this: plus and minus divided by multiplication equals this. is.

I am no longer here and yet I am here. It occurs to me there may not be much additional time before there is no time due to the Cascade rebounding dimensionally if one of the dimensions becomes a reference to the others then our physical reality, everything that we are, everything that we will ever be, and everything that we ever were, will simply be overwritten overwritten. we ourselves will not perceive anything having happened. There will be no pain. There will be no Self.

So I watch and listen to the innocent entropy humming around me, the dogs barking, the cat lazily shifting against the top of the couch, my ears ringing, ringing. I see the boxes that will never be put away and the blank pages that will never have, a single word or picture written upon them. I do not fear death. It was coming anyway, but I do fear nothingness. It did not have to happen this way. There's a small chance it will simply create endless loop. This, I fear the most.

Perhaps before I sleep, I will go dancing, and I will go to the park. Perhaps before I sleep I will go dancing, and I will go to the park. Perhaps some loops are worse than others to be stuck in.
