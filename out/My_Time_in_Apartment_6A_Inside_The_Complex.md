Recently, I’ve been talking with a buddy of mine about chronicling my life over the past couple of years, and he said I should definitely give it a go. With the approval of Mr. Rags, I'm going to do just that. I'm not the greatest of writers and I'm sure that sentiment will be reflected here over the course of my stories, so please bear with me. As long as I don't divulge our precise location, I'm in the clear. A big thank you to Mr. Rags, if he ever does read these. Anyways, I should start with a little background to get you up to speed.



I grew up like a lot of lower-middle class families. My dad was a carpenter for a few different companies, bouncing around to wherever the work went, and my mother was a stay-at-home mom, though she made some money on the side selling fresh breads and baked goods. The house always smelled like confectionaries, to the detriment of my slow metabolism. At 18, following High School, I decided to follow in my father's footsteps and joined a trade school while working as a runner for a construction company. They had a 'jack of all trades' kind of track that I selected, giving me a little bit of knowledge in most home repair services, along with basic handyman business acumen. Unfortunately while I was away, my parents both passed. It was a tragic highway accident, heavy rain and low visibility, so it wasn't anyone's fault. After the funeral, it took a couple months to get their affairs in order and sell the family home. I'm an only child, and I couldn't imagine living in the house without them, so I decided to take the profits and move out west, something my dad and I had talked and dreamed about on plenty of occasions. It's weird, but if they had never passed, I wouldn't be here now at The Complex. I also wouldn’t have been abducted and implanted and… well we’ll get to that soon.



I had a used Subaru that was older than me by 10 years. It was usually fit as a fiddle so buying a new one seemed asinine at the time. Looking back, I feel like a bit of an idiot, though that’s almost a daily occurrence now. I'd taken it on a few road trips with nary an issue, but this time was different. I was making my way West starting in Maine, traveling through the Appalachia's over to the great corn seas of the Mid-West, down to Texas and then up heading towards Colorado. I'd made it to New Mexico and was driving for about an hour or two when the engine started to make a horrendous noise. It sounded like something akin to a shotgun blast followed by two pieces of sheet metal rubbing ferociously against each other in the fiery throes of passion. The car shuddered, lurching forward in stop-and-go patterns until finally came to a end, dead in its tracks. I was at least 2 or 3 hours from anywhere remotely populated, or so I thought, and of course I had no cell signal in the slightest. Took some time and tried looking at the engine but it never was my forte, so it ended up being a fruitless endeavor. I resigned myself to sitting in the front seat, all the doors open with the flashers on, sweating my ass off. While I was weighing my options, I leaned the seat back and decided to doze off, an attempt to cure a headache brewing over the frustration of my situation.



Upon waking up, I realized the hairs all over my body were standing like pins and it felt like I was on the verge of having a panic attack. My heartbeat pounded and it felt like a lead weight sat in my stomach, beads of sweat now covering my forehead. It was darker now, much darker, the inky black of night only barely giving way to pinhole stars in the sky. I scrambled up in my seat and tried taking in my surroundings. Something was watching me, I could feel it. I checked all the mirrors and looked out every window. Glancing around frantically, something in the rear view caught my eye for a split second. Next to a couple of tall cactuses about 50 feet from my car, stood something short and white-ish, completely still, staring right back at me. It tilted it’s head slightly, almost quizzically. I pressed my brakes to try and make the rear lights flare up, but they weren’t working. I turned in my seat to check it out through the back window, when I caught a flash of it darting towards a large rock pile right next to my car. I think I screamed, hurrying to shut the doors and windows. I rag dolled myself through the interior of my car to get everything closed without going outside. 



I completed my task, sweating and nearly hyperventilating, and for a moment, the feeling of safety slowly crept back. I went to check the cars clock but nothing was working. I tried turning the key, honking the horn, turning on the radio, but nothing worked. I checked my phone for any signs of life. 11PM flashed back at me. I was sleeping for... at least 12 hours. I thought, "There's no way. I would've woken up before then, I would've needed to drink or eat or..." my thoughts stopped in their tracks. As I was sitting there, reeling at how I could've lost hours of the day like they were nothing, the car began to vibrate. At first it was slow, almost rhythmic, but quickly became a fast buzzing feeling, like a giant bee was sitting on top of it. I got ready to hop out of the car, but before I could, there was a flash of white light, brighter than the sun. Technically it's still the last thing I remember from that night still, but there’s a reason for that.



I woke up some hours later to a pair of headlights coming towards me from down the road. I spun my head around again and saw nothing by the rock or the cactuses, but quickly realized through sudden movements that my head was pounding and my entire body felt like I had ran a marathon. My thoughts of the entire debacle were happily replaced by the sounds of a white T-top Trans Am barreling towards me. It passed me in the car for a moment, then stopped, tires screeching on the pavement leaving long black rubber lines. He revved the engine, put it in reverse, shining bright red taillights into the night, and tore ass right back to where I was sitting, rolling down the window as he shouted.



"Hey buddy! You're lookin a little worse for wear! You like, stranded out here or something? Ain't too safe along the roads here at night." he said in a valley boy type of accent.



I looked around at the vast nothingness before looking back to him and sarcastically answering, though with an abundance of caution in my voice. "Yeah I’m alone out here.. I think. Hey you're real right? Did you just see that huge flash? Like the sun just exploded here on Earth?"



"Uhh no, no I can't say I saw that tonight man, but I do know what you're talking about. You feeling okay? Skin doesn't feel too hot, you're not throwing up your bloody guts?" he asked.



"I... no? I don't think so. I feel fine other than my head. I think I hit it or something, I don't know. I've been stranded out here for hours. Do you know how far the next city is?"



He laughed, and offered me a ride into town, saying it's only a short drive up the way.



"What town?" I said. "There's nothing on my map here, and my planned route doesn't have another place with people for a couple hours."



"Oh man, no need to worry about that. No worries! Maps don't always show ya the big picture you know? I'll get you right as rain my man. Actually, I know just the guy to get you feeling straight shooting again A.S.A.P! Just hop on in and I'll take you to see the big man himself, the big man on campus. I'm sure he'll like you, cause I already kind of like you!" he chortled and patted the poorly aged passenger seat.



I laughed nervously, bending down a bit to get a better look at the guy and his ride. He seemed nice enough and gave the aura of a guy plucked right out of 1984, neon sunglasses and all. I looked back at my car and took a deep breath.



"Hey dude, once we get back to The Complex, I can totally get a mechanic to come grab your ride. I promise, not a soul out here is going to touch it. Pinky promise!"



Against everything my brain was telling me, I grabbed my duffel bag and other belongings, threw them in the back seat of his hot rod, and strapped myself in. He gave me a huge grin and extended a paw my way. "Heck yeah man! Names Ray, and yours?"



"Uh yeah, I'm Zach, nice to meet you man. I really appreciate your help, not sure what I would've done if you hadn't stopped."



"Not a problem at all dude, I believe a good deed done is a good deed in the bank, so maybe I'll score something big next time at the swap meet!" he laughed as he pushed in a cassette and turned up the volume. We tore off towards his town blaring 'All Night Long' by Lionel Richie. I took a deep breath and stared out the window, wondering how the hell the night was going to end up.



It only took about 20 minutes to reach the edge of town, though I'm not sure you could really call it a town. As we pulled into the gas station (Rays office/sleeping arrangements/full time job) I realized there were only 5 buildings. The gas station, lit up like a cheap motel on the strip in Vegas, a small mom and pop looking store with a few parking spots out front, an even smaller windowless thing with one door, which turned out to be a maintenance building/den or horrors. Then there was the church about 100 yards from it, and directly across from the church was the main attraction. Standing tall was a 10 story tower resembling something more like a large government building than an apartment complex. It was an all tan brick facade with plenty of windows wrapping around it, a couple of pillars out front with the entrance steps, but nothing else. It looked very out of place in the middle of nowhere New Mexico. Ray threw his car in park and hopped out in one swift motion, gesturing for me to follow. I couldn't believe my luck that a total stranger actually picked me up and didn't take me to some far off shack to harvest my organs. By the time I got out, he was already halfway to the large buildings entrance. The lights out front illuminated most of the road, to which the neon lights of the "The Station" made up for the rest. The Church had a modest set of lights by the front door, but they were easily drowned out by the others.



"Hey man! You coming or what? I think we can still catch Mr. Rags if he's awake! Let's go!" I started towards him, still a little weary of the situation but I didn't have much of a choice. Once I caught up to him, we were both standing at the entrance to the building. "Alright man, this here is called The Complex. Mr. Rags owns and runs it. Yes that's his name, and no I don't know if that's his actual god given one. He's really chill as long as you don't mess around too bad. I mean like really mess around, hurt someone or something ya know? Just be real cool with him, and I bet he'll help you out, no sweat!"



Before I could reply, he reached over to click the large button labeled "10" on the intercom system. The whole thing looked lavish, emblazoned with bronze numbers and filigree around the edges, clearly sticking out against the drab tan bricks around it. Ray just stood there, bobbing his head to some tune I'm sure was stuck in his brain, quietly humming along. He reached out to ring it again, but just before his finger hit the button, a voice came through the intercom.



"Yes Ray, how may I help you this evening?" The voice sounded kind and older, with a slight British accent. I figured someone would be irate being called at this time of night.



"Yeah! Hello there Mr. Rags sir, I'm real sorry to bother you tonight, but I found a friend in need here. I think he saw the you-know-whats and is pretty out of sorts. Could you maybe take a look at him real quick? He can crash at my place after, not a worry there sir!" Ray said, looking nervous but excited.



"Oh is that so? Well, I can't in good conscience turn someone away like that now could I Ray? You know what they say, a good deed done is a..." Ray chimed in with him to finish the sentiment. "A good deed in the bank! Yeah Mr. Rags exactly, that's exactly what I say. I knew you'd be able to help! I'll send him on up if that's okay?"



"Absolutely dear boy, just send him up. I'll be waiting." The mic cut off as Ray nudged me forward.



"Alright man, best behavior. Just in the front doors here, straight back to the elevator and click the only button for floor 10. That's where Mr. Rags lives, right up on top. I promise, he's a real cool guy even if he's a little creepy. Just have him check you out then I'll be waiting over at the station for ya!"



I thanked him, Ray reaching out for a fist bump before trotting down the stairs towards his place. I looked back at the double doors, hesitant to enter. I inched towards them, and as I did, they unlocked through what sounded like a series of electronic deadbolts. The doors opened silently, perfectly in sync, revealing a spacious interior adorned with vintage chairs and pots full of luscious greenery. I walked past it all, peeking around at the other doors. One side looked like it contained a large dining room and kitchen, the other housing a laundry room or utility area. Making my way through to the elevator, I realized the entire area smelled like fresh cut flowers, though there were none in sight. The elevator doors opened with a 'ding' as they moved, beckoning me inside. I got in, found the number 10, and pressed it. The doors hissed this time, closing like they were a part of a pneumatic system, sealing me inside as if I were fresh meat being packaged in an airtight container. It dinged one more time before lurching upward towards my destination.



The elevator seemed to only take 2 or 3 seconds to reach the top of the entire building. The doors hissed again, opening to a very dark corridor. I called out, "Mr. Rags? Sir?" to no response. The elevator shuddered, then chimed something more akin to an alarm beep than a pleasant ding, urging me to disembark. Stepping inside the corridor, there were a few wall lights that turned on, though only enough for a dim glow to ooze over the few things inside the room. A velvet waiting chair and matching loveseat, a few very old but still lovely end tables and a larger matching coffee table, and an ancient looking piano on the other side to even everything out. At the end of the room stood a large maroon door, adorned with brass or bronze inlays all across it, yet with no discernible shape. I swear, as I drew closer to the door, the inlays were moving, or squirming into different designs. Taking a few shallow breaths, I pressed my knuckles into the door, three times. As soon as my skin touched it for the third time, the door slowly opened without a sound.



Inside, it looked like any other apartment setup, albeit with a large open concept. A nice dining room set like a retro diner, a few stylish newer couches around a larger old radio, a kitchen set from the 1970’s; every thing a different age of creation from the last. I took a few steps in and closed the door behind me. I turned my head for maybe 2 or 3 seconds to do so, but when I looked back into the room, Mr. Rags was sitting on the edge of the sofa seat.



“Oh Jesus, sorry sir. The door just opened when I knocked and I figured maybe..” he held a hand up to stop me. Not just ask me to stop, but somehow he made me stop talking, like it all got caught in my throat.



“You’re alright, I wasn’t waiting long.” He spoke, almost jovially, a soft smile on his face. “Apologies for the scare, I just like to keep an eye on the door. She can be finicky at times, picky even on who she lets in, never mind whether I want them to or not.” He looked over at the opposite couch, nodding for me to join him.



“For us to continue this conversation, I need you to extend to me a great amount of trust. I know it seems silly, dangerous even, to do so for someone you’ve only just met, but it’s of dire importance. You need to answer me entirely truthfully. Did you happen upon a creature in the desert? Possibly lose time or see a bright light?” he leaned towards me, almost floating on the couches edge.



“Uh, yeah exactly that. My car broke down completely, I fell asleep and woke up to something just watching me. The car began shaking and there was a flash of light and then… nothing. I can’t remember a single thing besides Ray showing up and bringing me here. How in the hell would you know about this? I’m starting to get nervous.”



Mr. Rags nodded thoughtfully, staring at me a few moments, before slowly standing up and walking over to me. I recoiled slightly, my fight-or-flight kicking in. He stopped briefly in front of me.



“Again, I know this is an immense amount of trust to put in a stranger, but I need to fix you up, so to speak. If I’m unwelcome to do so, you may experience more of these events, and eventually you may not be around at all. I’m afraid I would also need you to leave our town in the event this doesn’t work, or you decide to forgo it entirely. I’ll give you a moment to think about it while I get things ready.” he walked past me, down the hall into another room.



I watched and listened as he entered what looked to be a bathroom, things clanging as cupboards opened and closed. My heart was racing and my mind was clouded by a million thought streams, every one slightly worse than the last. Am I going to be murdered? Is he getting ready to take my kidney and throw me on ice? I was only 22 years old, I felt like there was much, much more in front of me I wanted to accomplish and experience. Before I could gather myself, Mr. Rags came waltzing out of the door, gliding down the hall towards me.



Standing up from the couch, I asked him, “What exactly are you going to do to me? I swear, I won't call the cops, I won’t tell anyone you’re here if you just let me go.”



He chuckled, then stared me dead in the eyes. “Dear boy, you wouldn’t be able to call if you tried. Your phone is dead and the nearest working one is across the street in the shop. You have no idea where you are and no working vehicle. I don’t say these things to scare you, but to implore you to see reason. I shall not bring you harm, in fact, it’s to be quite the opposite. You have something inside you that needs to be removed. Something that, if left unabated, will cause you much more turmoil in the future. Your head must feel like a storm is raging inside it, yes?”



“I… Is this about the things in the desert?” I said. “I feel like a bus hit me. Whatever you need to do, just please, don’t hurt me.”



“I would never. Please, look forward.”



I felt a small pain on the back of my neck. I craned my head back to find Mr. Rags smiling down at me, a scalpel in his hand.



“What the fuck? Did you just?” I felt the back of my neck with my hand, a small smear of blood covered my fingers as I did.



“I do profusely apologize, but yes, the ‘operation’ was a success.” he air quoted with his hands, ginning sheepishly. “Here, a bandaid for the small incision, and this.” he raised a small glass vial, dumping in an even smaller grey piece of metal. “I know, I know, you have many questions. In due time, I will answer all of them. For now, you need to get some rest while I deal with this.” he gestured to the vial. I felt sick, covering my mouth to try and hold back the upheaval from my insides. Mr. Rags rushed around the couch, helping me lay down on one of the ornate pillows. He nodded at me before walking off, as I fell into a deep sleep.



The next morning I woke up at Rays place, a half inflated blow-up mattress and musty smelling pillow keeping me afloat, and an old sleeping bag wrapped around me. The headache was gone and the wound on my neck was already healing, as was my fatigue and my appetite. It felt like I hadn’t eaten or drank in days. I leapt out of bed, ravenous for anything to shove down my gullet. Luck had it that Ray already thought ahead. He burst through the door to the guest room, fresh crispy bacon and eggs in tow. He threw it down on an old TV tray that was set up nearby.



“Oh man! You’re awake! I knew Mr. Rags was gonna get you all set, I knew it. Here, you’ve gotta be starving yeah? We got some eggs and bacon, some toast and OJ man. Well, it’s not real OJ, it’s Sunny D but, you get it. I’m so stoked it all worked out. How was he? All ominous and stuff? That’s usually like him, but he’s really nice man. You get the thing out? You’ll be sporting a cool little scar like this I bet! he said, gesturing to the back of his neck. Sure enough, there was a small scar, not more than an inch in size, exactly where Mr. Rags had cut me last night.



“Yeah man, it’s happened to a lot of us here. Depends on how you get here I think, but I know I’ve got one, the Watersons and McDaniels have them, Dr. Rheem has it, they’re all over. But, we’re all good now thanks to Mr. Rags!”



“What the hell happened? This is like something out of a book Ray, and it’s starting to freak me out. Can I use your phone when we're done?” I asked.



“Ah jeez, I mean yeah I would totally let you use mine, if I had one. Just no need out here, there’s no service you know? There’s phones in The Complex though, I’m sure you could use one there! Eat up though man, stuffs gettin’ cold and I know you’re hungry!”



He was right, I was incredibly hungry and I couldn’t stay away from the smell anymore. I think I finished the meal in 3 minutes flat, polishing it off and finishing it with a nice cold glass of Sunny D, just like when I was a kid. I talked with Ray a bit more, helped him clean up the dishes and headed to The Complex.



“Hey man, just don’t do anything that would get Mr. Rags all angry okay? He’s a good guy, and the folks around here are real nice too. Just don’t want you gettin hurt is all!” he said with a dismissing wave as I walked down the street.



Walking towards it, I noticed that Mr. Rags was already outside, sitting on the steps of the Complex, talking to two suited men. He glanced my way, nodding in my direction, alerting the men in suits that I was headed that way. They seemed to exchange a few more words, then headed off in the opposite direction. They walked down the road in unison, steadfast and unwavering. As I made it to the steps, they were still walking towards… nothing. Just down the road, left foot after the right. I turned to Mr. Rags who was looking at me with a slight smile.



“Good to see you Zach, I trust you slept well? I know Rays arrangements may have not been the best but you were safe there. He’s a good guy, if a little… simple,” he laughed.



“Yeah thanks, Ray’s been a life saver. What was that all about though? Those guys there, they’re just walking away now. Like.. there’s no discernible reason they should be walking that way. This is all getting way too weird for me. Is there any way I could just get a ride back to my car or.. into the next town? I don’t mean to be rude, I just feel like I’m going crazy.”



“Well, I’m sure I could arrange that, but your car isn’t in any shape to be driven, and the mechanic won’t be back this way for about a week. The next town doesn’t have any motels or hotels, and they’ve not quite fond of visitors, so I’ve heard. I have a proposition for you though. We’ve recently lost our maintenance man, Jerry. Poor soul got caught up in one of the storms that pass by here every once in a while. I believe you have the same capabilities he possessed, correct?” he glanced up at me, an eyebrow raised.



“Y.. Yeah. I can probably do those kind of things. How did y..” he cut me off with a raised hand.



“Excellent, excellent! Here’s my thought. I’ll have the old chaps apartment cleaned up and renovated, post haste. It shouldn't take me but a day or two, and there won’t be a trace left of his existence. In the meantime, you can stay with Ray, possibly have him show you the ropes around here and get you acquainted with a few of our other residents. I’m sure he’ll want to have you for one of his ‘legendary pizza parties’ or whatever he calls them. While you stay here, you could look into a few mechanical disturbances we’ve been having since Jerry’s departure, as a means of paying it forward. Does this seem like a mutually beneficial arrangement Zach?”



I mulled it over a moment. He was right, I wasn’t going to be getting anywhere fast in my car, as broken down as it was, and for all of the weird shit that’d happened to me in the past 24 hours, I was oddly intrigued by the entire event, if you can call it that. I still had so many questions I wanted answered, and it’s not like I had a real plans for my near future. Technically, I had made it out West. This could be a fresh start of sorts.



“Of course, if you happen to appreciate your new abode, I’d be happy to hire you on staff, full-time, benefits and all. You could carve out yourself a new life here, a fresh start of sorts, yes?” I looked at him puzzled, like he had just read my mind.



“Yeah, alright Mr. Rags. I’ll take you up on that offer. As long as the mechanic can be here within the week, I’ll stick around and help out. It’s the least I could do really. I appreciate it, sir.”



“Splendid, splendid! If you’d like, you can wash up in Jerry’s bathroom, apartment 6A. He was a clean man so I’m sure it’s spotless,” he said, holding up a brass key, 6A etched onto the surface. “I’ll see you tonight in the Complex dining hall for dinner tonight, 6:30 PM sharp. I believe the Stevensons are cooking up something special!” he licked his lips at the idea.



“Okay, thank you Mr. Rags. Could we possibly talk this evening after dinner?”



“Absolutely, I’m sure you’ve got quite the list of questions for me, and I’ll do my best to answer them all. Have a good afternoon Zach, and welcome to The Complex.” He turned away and walked inside, the doors opening on their own accord to admit him.



So that was it. That’s how I made my way into the weirdest towns I’ve ever been in. Officially, this town has no name. You won’t find it on any map that you can find, and you’re not likely to pass through it just driving down the road. I’m glad I decided to stay that day, it’s made for a plethora of insane, unbelievable and out of this world stories. Until next time, I’ll tell you how a bit of the day went after accepting the offer. As Mr. Rags made his way inside, I followed him. We both rode in the elevator in silence, him clicking the buttons for our respective floors. The doors opened to the 6th floor, two side of the building each an apartment, 6A and 6B. He gestured to the door with a smile and I got off.



I walked over to it, hands shaking a bit as I went to unlock it. I got the key into the deadbolt, when the elevator dinged. I looked over as the doors opened to see an infant standing there. When I say infant, I mean something that looked maybe 3 or 4 months old, far too young to be standing. It was there, bow legged and looking confused, wobbling a bit as it looked around, its head bobbing a bit back and forth like it was too heavy. I muttered something along the lines of “what the fuck?” in it’s direction. As soon as I did, it locked eyes with me, opening it’s mouth, almost unhinging it at the jaw sockets. The sound that came out of it’s bowels can only be described as a low, guttural rumble, like an alligator mating call. I nearly shit my pants, turning the deadbolt and door handle to get myself inside as fast as possible. The door popped open and I threw myself inside, kicking the door closed from the floor. I rushed up to my feet and relocked it. Heavily breathing and practically seeing stars, I waited for something to happen. As I backed away from the door, I heard the elevator ding again, the mayhem and low rumbles of the infant waning, as silence eventually took its place.
