I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if I'm really being stalked. I can't stop thinking about the ugly man I saw staring at me through my dorm room window. His eyes were dark and sinister, and it made my blood run cold. He just stood there, until I closed my curtains.


1/3/23

I saw him again today. This time, he was standing outside the window of my lecture hall. I tried to ignore him. I'm so scared. I don't know what to do.

I talked to campus security today. They said they'd keep an eye out for the guy, but they didn't seem too concerned. They told me to call them if I saw him again. But what good will that do? He always disappears before anyone can catch him. I can't focus on anything. Every time I try to study, I just imagine him lurking outside my window. I feel like he's watching me all the time. I'm starting to question if I'm just paranoid, but I know what I saw.

I think he's getting closer. I saw him at the library today. He was just standing there, reading, but i could see his eyes peer above the book. He is watching me. I ran out of there as fast as I could. I'm scared to go anywhere alone now. I don't know how much longer I can take this. I see him everywhere now. He's following me, I know it. He's in my nightmares too. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like he's standing right beside my bed. I don't know what to do. I'm so scared. I feel like I'm being suffocated by his presence. I can't escape him. He's always there, watching me.

I've noticed he wears the same clothes every day - a black hoodie and ripped jeans. He never wears a hat, so I can clearly see his bald head. His skin is pale and rough, with deep wrinkles around his eyes and mouth. He looks like he hasn't shaved in weeks, and his beard is patchy and unkempt.

I think I figured out where the man lives. I followed him after he left campus today, and he went straight to an old abandoned building on the outskirts of town. It's a run-down warehouse that's been abandoned for years. I did some research on the abandoned warehouse, and it turns out it used to be a factory that made chemical products. I have a feeling that whatever the man is doing there, it can't be good. I've been trying to figure out a way to get inside and see what he's up to, but I haven't come up with anything yet. He’s all I can think about, day in and day out. I've started following him, just to see where he goes and what he does. I know it's wrong, but I can't stop myself. It's like a compulsion. Every time I see him, my heart races and my palms sweat. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I've started keeping a record of his movements. It's become almost like a game to me. I follow him from a distance, trying to stay hidden, and make note of every place he goes. I've even taken pictures of him with my phone, to add to my collection.
I know this is wrong, and I know I should stop, but I can't help myself. The thrill of the chase is too much to resist. I'm afraid that one day I'm going to get caught, and then what will happen? I don't know how to stop this. I feel like I'm losing control. I've started having nightmares about him, where he's chasing me through the streets, his ugly face twisted in a snarl. I wake up in a cold sweat, heart pounding. During the day, I can't stop thinking about him. I've even started skipping classes just so I can follow him around. I know it's insane, but I can't help myself. I'm becoming obsessed. 


Last night, I followed him to a rundown apartment building on the outskirts of town. I watched as he went inside, and then I waited outside for hours, just to see if he would come out again. When he finally did, I followed him back to the warehouse. I know I shouldn't have done it, but I couldn't help myself. I had to know where he lived. Now that I do, I feel like I have some kind of power over him. I know where he sleeps, where he eats, where he goes. I know everything.
But at the same time, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I couldn't sleep last night. My mind kept racing, and I kept thinking about him, the man. I need to find out more. I went back to the library and checked out some books on psychology and criminal profiling. I've been reading them all day, trying to understand his behavior and motivations. I feel like I'm getting closer to the truth.

2/5/23

I followed him today. I couldn't help myself. I waited until he left his apartment and followed him to the park. He sat on a bench and read a book. He looked so peaceful, so innocent. But I know better. I know what he's capable of. I watched him for hours, taking notes on his behavior and movements. I’ve started skipping classes and spending all my time stalking him. I'm sure he knows that I'm following him, but he's not doing anything about it. He's just going about his life, like nothing is wrong. But everything is wrong. I can feel it in my bones

2/13/23

I've reached a breaking point. I can't take this anymore. I need to confront him, to make him confess to what he's been doing to me. I'm not sure how I'm going to do it yet, but I know I need to do it. I'm scared, but I'm also angry. How dare he stalk me like this? How dare he make me feel like this? I'm going to make him pay for what he's done.

2/17/23

Today, something terrible happened. I was watching him from a distance as usual, but this time, he spotted me. I don't know how it happened. I was careful, I was always careful. But somehow, he saw me. He looked angry and scared at the same time. I panicked and ran away, hoping he wouldn't follow me. He yelled that he knew who I was, and he was threatening to call the police if I didn't leave him alone. I didn't know what to do, I felt like my whole world was falling apart. I knew I had to confront him. 

2/20/23

I was called to the campus security office today. They told me that MY stalker had reported me, and they had security footage. They said they had seen me watching him for hours on end, and they wanted to know why. I tried to explain myself, but they didn't believe me. They thought I was crazy, or maybe even dangerous. They told me to stay away from him or face consequences.

Last night, I went to his apartment building with bleach and a hammer. I waited for hours until I saw him coming back from work. He didn't notice me at first, but then I stepped out of the shadows and confronted him. He tried to run, but I caught him. I pushed him against the wall and held him there. I could see the fear in his eyes, and it felt good.
I asked him why he was stalking me. He denied it, but I didn't believe him. He's been following me for months, and I have the evidence to prove it. I told him that I was going to make him pay for what he's done to me. He begged me to let him go, but I didn't listen. I punched him in the face and kicked him in the stomach. He fell to the ground. I hammered his head repeatedly until his face was red and inverted. I poured bleach on the body and threw my shoe, the hammer, and the bottle into the lake. I left him there, lying on the ground, and ran away, and I don't know what's gonna happen next. I don't know where I'm gonna go. But I do know that I'm safe now. He deserved it. He deserved everything that came to him.
