Mrs Letitia cut my head off in the summer of 1996. I was twelve years old. It was a hot day, I remember that, and spring wasn’t far gone. The flowers still had their newness. Their heads were still on, by the way. No swift gardener had come on through and trimmed them all to fuzz. 

It didn’t hurt. Whenever you talk about something on you being cut off, except hair, people always ask whether it hurt. It didn’t. There was a lot of pressure and the sound was horrible and I was frightened, but it didn’t hurt. 

Mrs Letitia lived on Beulah Avenue, one of those places that are a few decades old but have been half done up, and now look dystopically interesting and smell new but still retain some feeling of old fashioned design. It was as if she’d lived there forever, but I didn’t know her until that day, I had only heard whispers. In the school counsellor’s office, in the doctor’s. Between the parents at the arts centre I went to with my mum.  

I didn’t know we were going there. I was at school. I liked school, mostly. I preferred the company of books to other children and spent most recesses in the library, or drawing pictures of buildings and finishing homework. Sometimes at lunch I played games with my peers, but usually I read, or sat in the music office and talked to Mr Parton, who liked to play chess. He would teach me trick moves and play jazz on the cassette player and he never gave me the side-eye for carrying my little stuffed elephant in my pocket like the other teachers did.

I was at school. And at the end of the day my mum came to pick me up because it was a Thursday, and the schedule was Mum picked me up on Monday and Thursday and Dad picked me up on the other days, and she said we had an appointment. I wanted to go home because she hadn’t said we had to have an appointment before I left and she usually told me about those things. She said sorry but it was a last minute spot. We went. I gripped Maisy the elephant tightly in my pocket. I’d been to appointments before, doctors, and the dentist I liked because he gave me stickers with puns on them and sugar-free sweets in pink and purple that came in crinkly clear plastic, and the speech therapist I went to for two months when I was nine because I couldn’t pronounce my fs. But all of those appointments had been in proper buildings for business. None had just been inside someone’s house. 

We pulled into the driveway. The house was made of yellow brick and called ‘Aerangis’. There were lots of plants in the front garden. Mum knocked on the door and a woman came out who was dressed like a teacher and she smiled at both of us and said her name was Mrs Letitia. Mum introduced us both and then Mrs Letitia pointed to Maisy sticking out of my pocket and she said “And who is this?” and I said “This is Maisy” and she said “Is Maisy an elephant?” and I said “Yes, Maisy is an African elephant because she has very large ears” and then she asked if she could hold Maisy for a bit and I said no. Then she showed us both into her house and said she needed to have a chat with Mum so we went in. 

I wasn’t listening to what Mum and Mrs Letitia were saying because I was looking at Mrs Letitia’s collection of salt and pepper shakers. She had twenty-two pairs. My favourite were red fire hydrants. She also had a pair of giraffes and a pair of tigers, but no elephants. 

Then Mrs Letitia came over to me and said we were going to start. She said she had heard I was having some trouble at school and our appointment today was going to help me. I didn’t know what she meant because I normally had a good time at school. I did my work on time and the librarians gave me muesli bars. 

Mum said she was going to sit in the car. I didn’t like that because either Mum or Dad always came with me to appointments. 

Mrs Letitia asked me to come over to the table. She asked me to take out Maisy from my pocket. I did. Then she took Maisy and said I could have her back at the end. I tried to take her back but Mrs Letitia said no and held her away. I was so angry and sad I wanted to throw the table across the room and send a petition to Mrs Letitia’s parents and I started panicking and she told me not to panic and I screamed for my mum and then Mrs Letitia said “None of that please” and grabbed me and I was scared. I couldn’t breathe properly because I was panicking because I wanted Mum and I wanted Maisy and I wanted Dad and I wanted to go home. Then I was even more scared because I thought I’d die of suffocation and Mrs Letitia was telling me not to be silly and to calm down but I couldn’t calm down because she was grabbing me and she had Maisy. 

Then she told me she promised it would be over soon and she grabbed my neck. She pulled me against the table and made me lean over it on my tummy and then put Maisy out of the way where I couldn’t reach her. My heart was beating so fast it felt squiggly and I could smell the table and I was crying. Everything was colours and the colours were too pointy. I heard a drawer opening and closing. Mrs Letitia held my head down against the table and then she took the knife she had pulled from the drawer and I thought I was going to vomit and she started cutting my head off. I was so scared and I thought I was going to die. She was cutting and I was crying and the sound was horrible horrible horrible and it didn't hurt and that was wrong even though I didn't want it to hurt I knew she had not put any numbing things on me and that meant it should and it wasn't and that was wrong, and she was leaning so hard on my neck I couldn’t move and I could see blood pouring out all over the table, all over the floor, I could smell it and with every heartbeat it felt like more and more was being pumped out and I tried to slow my heart rate so I maybe could live a little bit longer but if this was life I didn’t want to live it I thought and it didn’t even change my heart rate anyway and then she cut through, and her knife hit the table and I felt my head be jerked away from my body, and then she pulled me up. 

My body was very still. I could see the stump of my neck and my hands lying quietly on the table and bits of something fizzy coming out of my shirt. There was a weird pulling in my neck. I could feel Mrs Letitia flopping me. 

She said it was almost done and then she leaned down to my body and started pulling things out. Her hand went into the bubbles coming out of my shirt. She pulled out a bottle of fizzy drink from my neck, one that was leaking, and my favourite flavour and colour, orange. Then she pulled out a skipping rope and some pieces of chalk and one of Mr Parton’s jazz cassettes and a big blue fluffy blanket. I could feel pressure and my body stretching even though it was completely still. She put the things in a big pile on the floor. 

Then she started shaking my head. The room went jiggly and I felt sick and I was so frightened I didn’t know what to do and I tried to speak but only floppy sounds came out. I felt her fingers wriggling around in my neck and they grabbed onto something and I could feel her pulling things out the base of my skull, from right in my brain. I could see them too as they fell to the floor, looking down frantically as much as I could. Mrs Letitia pulled out playing cards, she pulled out chess pieces, she pulled out books and toys and all different kinds of elephants and muesli bars and my nightlight and the crossword puzzle Mum leaves for me and a bowl of Dad’s homemade spinach noodles and my library card and a playground swing. She kept shaking and feeling around and she said she thought there would be some trains in there and I didn’t know what that meant. She poked around a bit more and then said that was fine and then Mrs Letitia put my head back on the table and put the knife in the sink. 

Mrs Letitia sewed me up. She clipped my bones back together and sewed up all the other tissues and skin nice and tight. I had a headache. Nothing else hurt. I just felt scared and tired and drained. 

Mrs Letitia told me to sit up. I did. I looked at the floor and all made things she had pulled out of me were gone. She put Maisy back into my arms and went to wash her hands. I saw the red running off and swirling away down the sink. I touched my neck. The stitches were already dissolving, disappearing under the skin. 

On my way back to the car I looked at myself in the mirror. It looked like I had a red collar on. I couldn’t move my body properly even though it wanted to move. It was fizzy. She hadn’t gotten all the fizzy out. 

But I was too tired for fizzy. I walked back to the car and Mrs Letitia led me by my shoulder even though I didn’t want her to. I was too tired to fight it. She told my mum it would take a few days for healing but then I would be as good as new. I sat in the car with Maisy. On the way home Mum asked if I would like another session with Mrs Letitia. I said no. 

She didn’t push it. When we got home I lay in my room and pulled Maisy to my chest and pressed my feet against the wall. 

The next day at school I couldn’t concentrate. I finished my work slower than usual and in PE I ran fast fast and jumped high high and at lunch time I played chess with Mr Parton but I couldn’t concentrate and kept knocking over the pieces.
 
It has been a long time since then. I never went back to Mrs Letitia. But I don’t like looking at fire hydrants, and I’ll never live in a yellow brick house. 

The scar isn’t even there anymore, on my skin. I can feel it underneath though, if I run my fingers around my neck. It's tight and rough. Some days I feel it more than others. 

Mrs Letitia said she’d put my head on straight. I don’t know though.
