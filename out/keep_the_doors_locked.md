It was a regular Friday night, my friend was over for a sleepover, and we were lost in the world of Minecraft until the late hours. After devouring pre-made pizza, we decided to wind down with a movie.  
  
As the credits rolled on the first film, an odd, human-like sound drifted from downstairs. We shared a puzzled look but brushed it off as the house settling. Still, a subtle unease settled over us.  
  
Determined to dispel the growing discomfort, we ventured downstairs. The wooden steps creaked beneath our weight, the living room dimly lit by the streetlights outside. Shadows danced in the corners, playing tricks on our eyes.  
  
Convinced we were alone, we headed back upstairs. The second movie played, but the tension lingered. Again, that distinct, unsettling noise echoed through the house.  
  
This time, we hesitated. Fear gripped us as we exchanged uneasy glances. With cautious steps, we descended the staircase. The living room, seemingly empty, held a quiet eeriness.  
  
Just as we were about to turn back, a faint whisper reached our ears. A voice, barely audible, spoke words we couldn't decipher. Panic set in as we strained to make sense of the spectral utterances.  
  
Then, from above, a strange sound: a soft dragging noise, like a bag being pulled along the floor. It came from the ceiling, an unexpected and unexplained disturbance.  
  
He and I exchanged troubled looks. The atmosphere grew tense, and an unsettling energy enveloped us. We hurried back upstairs, the stairs echoing with our uneasy footsteps.  
  
The rest of the night passed in a tense silence. Sleep was hard to come by as the echoes of those unexplainable sounds replayed in our minds. The house, once comforting, now held an unspoken mystery.  
  
In the quiet hours before dawn, I couldn't shake the feeling that something unseen lingered within those walls. The memory of that night and the mysterious sounds persist a reminder that sometimes, the boundary between the ordinary and the unknown blurs in ways we can't fathom.
