I never thought I'd be the guy to write one of these posts, but here I am, fingers trembling as they hover over my keyboard. I need to get this off my chest, and maybe someone out there can help me make sense of what the hell happened. But before I dive into the nightmare my life has become, let me introduce myself.

My name's Jake, and I'm your average 28-year-old guy trying to make it in the big city. I work as a graphic designer for a small marketing firm, spending my days hunched over a computer, tweaking layouts and debating the merits of serif vs. sans-serif fonts. It's not the most exciting job in the world, but it pays the bills and leaves me enough free time to pursue my real passion: photography.

I'm not what you'd call conventionally handsome. I've got this mop of unruly brown hair that never seems to behave, no matter how much product I use. My eyes are a muddy hazel, nothing special, hidden behind thick-rimmed glasses that I've been told make me look "adorkable" (whatever that means). I'm average height, with a bit of a dad bod from too many late nights snacking while working on projects. But I've got a decent smile, or so I've been told, and I can usually make people laugh.

My apartment is a tiny studio in the heart of downtown. It's cramped, with barely enough room for my bed, desk, and the small kitchen area. The walls are plastered with my photographs – moody black and white shots of the city at night, close-ups of raindrops on leaves, that sort of thing. It's not much, but it's home.

My love life? Well, that's been a bit of a disaster. I've had a few relationships over the years, but nothing that really stuck. My last girlfriend, Sarah, dumped me six months ago because she said I was "too absorbed in my work." Maybe she was right. I do tend to get lost in my projects, sometimes forgetting to eat or sleep when I'm in the zone.

After Sarah left, I threw myself into my work even more. I picked up extra freelance gigs, stayed late at the office, anything to keep my mind off the loneliness that crept in during the quiet hours of the night. But eventually, even I had to admit that I needed to get back out there.

That's when I decided to give Tinder a shot. I'd always been skeptical of dating apps, but a couple of my coworkers had good experiences with it, so I figured, why not? I spent an embarrassingly long time choosing photos for my profile. Should I go with the serious, artsy black and white portrait? The goofy snapJack from my best friend's wedding? In the end, I settled on a mix – a couple of casual shots, one of me with my camera, and yes, the "adorkable" one with the glasses.

For the first few weeks, it was pretty uneventful. A few matches here and there, some conversations that fizzled out after a day or two. I was about ready to give up on the whole thing when I matched with her. Lily.

Lily's profile was... different. Most girls on Tinder have the usual pics – beach shots, gym selfies, that kind of thing. But Lily's pics were artsy as fuck. Black and white portraits where she was always looking slightly off-camera, like she was distracted by something just out of frame. It was intriguing, I'll give her that.

We matched on a Tuesday night, and she messaged me first:

Lily: hey there handsome ;) wyd?

I was sitting at my desk, editing some photos from a recent shoot, when my phone buzzed with the notification. I picked it up, my heart doing a little flip when I saw her name.

Me: nm just chillin. editing some pics. hbu?

Lily: same. bored af tho. wanna change that? ;)

Now, I'm not gonna lie, my first thought was "Holy shit, I'm gonna get laid tonight." But I didn't want to come on too strong and scare her off. So I played it cool.

Me: haha maybe. what did u have in mind?

Lily: idk. u tell me ;) im down for anything

Me: how about we grab a drink first? get to know each other a bit

Lily: sounds good. when and where?

We agreed to meet at this little dive bar downtown the next night. I was pumped, but also a bit nervous. I mean, she seemed almost too eager, you know? But I figured, what's the worst that could happen?

The next day at work, I couldn't focus. My mind kept drifting back to Lily's profile pics, those haunting eyes that seemed to look right through me. My boss, Dave, had to snap his fingers in front of my face more than once to get my attention.

"Earth to Jake," he said, a hint of annoyance in his voice. "You with us, buddy?"

"Yeah, sorry," I mumbled, forcing my eyes back to my computer screen. "Just a little distracted today."

Dave's expression softened. "Hot date tonight?"

I felt my cheeks flush. "Maybe. We'll see."

He clapped me on the shoulder. "Good for you, man. Just don't forget about the Johnson account deadline tomorrow, alright?"

I nodded, promising myself I'd stay late to finish up if I had to. No way was I going to let this date mess up my work.

The rest of the day crawled by. I must have changed my outfit five times before leaving my apartment, finally settling on a simple black button-down and my nicest jeans. As I locked my door, I caught a glimpse of myself in the hallway mirror. My hair was doing that thing again, sticking up in all directions. I tried to smooth it down, gave up, and headed out.

I got to the bar about 15 minutes early. It was a place called "The Rusty Nail," a hole-in-the-wall joint with dim lighting and a jukebox that hadn't been updated since the 90s. I liked it because it was never too crowded, and they made a mean Old Fashioned.

As I nursed my first drink, I felt a tap on my shoulder.

"Hey there, handsome."

I turned around, and there she was. Lily. And let me tell you, her profile pics didn't do her justice. She had this long, dark hair that seemed to move even when she was standing still. And her eyes... man, her eyes were something else. Deep green, almost hypnotic.

"Hi," I managed to stammer out. "Lily, right?"

She smiled, and I swear the whole bar got a little brighter. "That's me. And you must be Jake. Nice to finally meet you in person."

We grabbed a table and started chatting. The conversation flowed easily, like we'd known each other for years. We talked about our jobs (she was a freelance photographer, which instantly piqued my interest), our hobbies (we both loved horror movies), and our families (she was an only child, like me).

As the night went on, I couldn't shake this feeling that something was... off. Not in a bad way, necessarily. It was more like when you're watching a movie and you can tell there's a jump scare coming, but you don't know exactly when.

At one point, Lily excused herself to go to the bathroom. While she was gone, I checked my phone and saw a message from her:

Lily: having a great time ;) cant wait to see where this goes

I looked up, confused. She'd left her phone on the table. How did she...?

Before I could think too much about it, she was back, sliding into the seat across from me with that same mesmerizing smile.

"Everything okay?" she asked, tilting her head slightly.

"Yeah, just... I thought I got a message from you, but your phone's right here."

She laughed, a sound like tinkling bells. "Oh, that's weird. Must be a glitch or something."

I nodded, pushing the thought out of my mind. We ordered another round of drinks, and as the night wore on, I found myself more and more drawn to her. There was something about Lily that was just... captivating.

Around midnight, the bar started to clear out. Lily leaned in close, her breath warm against my ear.

"Want to get out of here?"

My heart raced. This was it. But again, that nagging voice in the back of my head told me to take it slow.

"How about we call it a night?" I suggested. "Maybe we could do dinner tomorrow?"

For a split second, I swear I saw a flash of... something in her eyes. Disappointment? Anger? But it was gone so fast I thought I must have imagined it.

"Sure," she said, her smile never wavering. "Dinner sounds great."

We said our goodbyes outside the bar. As I turned to leave, Lily grabbed my arm. Her grip was surprisingly strong.

"Jake," she said, her voice low. "I had a really great time tonight. I can't wait to see you again."

"Me too," I replied, trying to ignore the goosebumps that had suddenly appeared on my arm.

As I walked home that night, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd just stepped into something I didn't fully understand. But I was excited. Intrigued. And maybe a little scared.

Little did I know, that fear was about to become all too real.

The next morning, I woke up with a pounding headache and a mouth that felt like it was stuffed with cotton. I groaned, reaching for my phone on the nightstand. The bright screen made me wince as I checked the time: 10:37 AM. Shit. I was late for work.

As I scrambled out of bed, my phone buzzed with a string of notifications. All from Lily:

Lily: morning handsome ;) Lily: cant stop thinking about last night Lily: cant wait to see u again Lily: dinner tonight? Lily: jake? Lily: u there? Lily: hello???? Lily: why r u ignoring me?????

I checked the timestamps. The first message was sent at 3:17 AM, barely an hour after we'd said goodbye. The last one was from just a few minutes ago. I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the uneasy feeling in my gut. This was... a lot.

Me: morning lily. sry just woke up. late for work. dinner sounds great. where do u wanna go?

Her reply came almost instantly:

Lily: my place. ill cook ;)

I hesitated. Going to her place on the second date? It seemed a bit fast. But then again, hadn't I been hoping for exactly this kind of opportunity?

Me: sure, sounds good. what time?

Lily: 7. ill send u the address. cant wait ;)

I quickly shot off a text to Dave, my boss, apologizing for being late and promising to stay extra to make up for it. Then I rushed through my morning routine, barely tasting the stale coffee I gulped down before heading out the door.

The day at work was a blur. I couldn't focus on anything, my mind constantly drifting back to Lily. There was something about her that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It was like she had this gravitational pull, drawing me in even when we weren't together.

"Earth to Jake," Dave's voice cut through my thoughts. I looked up to see him standing over my desk, arms crossed. "You okay, buddy? You've been staring at that same layout for the past hour."

I felt my face flush. "Yeah, sorry. Just... got a lot on my mind."

Dave's expression softened. "That hot date go well last night?"

"Yeah," I nodded, a small smile tugging at my lips. "We're actually seeing each other again tonight."

"Good for you," Dave grinned, clapping me on the shoulder. "Just try to keep your head in the game while you're here, alright?"

I promised I would, but it was easier said than done. As the day wore on, my phone kept buzzing with messages from Lily. Random thoughts, jokes, even a few... suggestive photos that made me glad I wasn't sitting in an open office.

At 6:30, I headed out to Lily's place. She lived in an old Victorian house on the outskirts of town, the kind of place that probably looked charming in daylight but took on a sinister air in the growing dusk. As I walked up the creaky steps to her front door, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I turned around, scanning the street, but it was empty.

I raised my hand to knock, but before my knuckles could touch the wood, the door swung open. Lily stood there, backlit by a warm glow from inside the house. She was wearing a flowing red dress that hugged her curves in all the right places, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders.

"Jake," she breathed, her green eyes seeming to glow in the dim light. "I'm so glad you're here."

She pulled me inside, the door closing behind me with a soft thud that sounded strangely final. The interior of the house was... not what I expected. While the outside looked like it hadn't been updated since the Victorian era, the inside was sleek and modern. Minimalist furniture, abstract art on the walls, and what looked like state-of-the-art tech scattered around.

"Wow," I said, taking it all in. "Nice place."

Lily smiled, leading me towards what I assumed was the kitchen. "Thanks. I like to keep people guessing."

The smell of something delicious wafted through the air, making my stomach growl. "Whatever you're cooking smells amazing," I said.

"Oh, that's just a little something I whipped up," Lily replied, a coy smile playing on her lips. "I hope you like it... spicy."

We sat down to eat, and I had to admit, the food was incredible. Some kind of exotic dish I couldn't quite place, with flavors that danced on my tongue. As we ate, we talked and laughed, the wine flowing freely. I found myself relaxing, the unease from earlier melting away under Lily's warm gaze.

After dinner, we moved to the living room. Lily put on some music – something low and thrumming that seemed to vibrate in my chest. As we sat on the couch, she moved closer, her hand resting on my thigh.

"I'm really glad you came over tonight, Jake," she said, her voice low and husky.

I swallowed hard, suddenly very aware of how close she was. "Me too," I managed to say.

She leaned in, her lips brushing against mine. The kiss was electric, sending shockwaves through my body. I pulled her closer, losing myself in the moment.

But then, something strange happened. As we kissed, I felt... different. Lightheaded, but not in the usual way. The room seemed to spin, colors blurring and shifting. I pulled back, blinking hard.

"Are you okay?" Lily asked, concern etched on her face.

"Yeah, I just..." I shook my head, trying to clear it. "I feel a little weird."

"Oh no," Lily said, her hand cool against my forehead. "Maybe you're coming down with something. Why don't you lie down for a bit?"

I nodded, letting her guide me to what I assumed was a guest bedroom. The room swam in and out of focus as I collapsed onto the bed. Lily's face hovered above me, her green eyes seeming to glow in the darkness.

"Just rest," she whispered, her voice sounding far away. "I'll take care of you."

As I drifted off, I could have sworn I saw something... shift in Lily's face. Like a ripple passing over water. But before I could process what I'd seen, darkness claimed me.

I don't know how long I was out. When I came to, the room was pitch black. I blinked, trying to orient myself. Where was I? What happened?

As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I realized something was... off. The room felt different. Smaller, somehow. And there was a smell – musty and damp, like a basement that hadn't been aired out in years.

I reached out, feeling for a lamp or a light switch, but my hand hit something solid. Wood. Rough and splintery. I ran my hand along it, my heart beginning to race as I realized what it was.

I was in a box. A fucking box.

Panic surged through me. I pushed against the wood, but it didn't budge. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out.

And then, I heard it. A soft scratching sound, coming from above me. It grew louder, more frantic. Whatever was up there, it was trying to get in.

Or maybe... it was trying to get out.

I don't know how long I was trapped in that box. Minutes? Hours? Time seemed to lose all meaning in the suffocating darkness. The scratching sound above me had stopped, replaced by an eerie silence that was somehow even worse.

Just as I was about to give in to full-blown panic, I heard a click. A sliver of light appeared, growing wider as the lid of the box was slowly lifted. I squinted against the sudden brightness, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest.

And there she was. Lily, peering down at me with those hypnotic green eyes. But something was... different. Wrong. Her face seemed to shift and ripple, like I was looking at her through a heat haze.

"Oh good, you're awake," she said, her voice oddly distorted. "I was worried I might have given you too much."

"W-what?" I croaked, my throat dry and scratchy. "What's going on? Why am I in a box?"

Lily tilted her head, a gesture that should have been cute but now seemed alien and predatory. "Don't you like it? I made it just for you."

She reached down, grabbing my arm with that surprisingly strong grip, and hauled me out of the box. As I stumbled to my feet, I realized we were in some kind of basement. The walls were bare concrete, covered in strange symbols that seemed to writhe and twist when I wasn't looking directly at them.

"What is this place?" I asked, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. "What did you do to me?"

Lily's smile widened, revealing teeth that looked just a bit too sharp. "I didn't do anything to you, Jake. I'm just... helping you see things as they really are."

She gestured around the room, and I noticed for the first time that we weren't alone. Shadows moved in the corners, taking on vaguely humanoid shapes before melting back into darkness. And on the far wall...

I felt the blood drain from my face. Dozens of Polaroid photos were tacked to the wall, each showing a different man. Some were smiling, obviously taken on dates. Others looked terrified, their eyes wide with fear. And some... some were just empty-eyed husks, staring blankly at the camera.

"Do you like my collection?" Lily asked, her voice filled with pride. "You'll be joining them soon."

I backed away, my legs shaky. "What the fuck are you?"

Lily laughed, the sound echoing unnaturally in the basement. "Oh Jake, I'm whatever you want me to be. Isn't that what all men want? A girl who's 'down for anything'?"

As she spoke, her form began to change. One moment she was the beautiful woman I'd met at the bar, the next she was a writhing mass of shadows and teeth. I blinked hard, convinced I must be hallucinating, but the transformations continued.

"This isn't real," I muttered, squeezing my eyes shut. "This can't be real."

I felt a cold hand on my cheek, forcing me to open my eyes. Lily was inches from my face, her green eyes now swirling pools of darkness.

"It's very real, Jake," she whispered. "And it's only just beginning."

Suddenly, the room began to spin. The concrete walls melted away, replaced by swirling vortexes of color and shadow. I felt like I was falling, tumbling through space and time.

When the world finally stopped moving, I found myself back in my apartment. I was lying on my bed, fully clothed, my alarm blaring next to me. With a shaking hand, I reached out and shut it off.

6:30 AM. Tuesday morning. The day after I'd first matched with Lily on Tinder.

Had it all been a dream? Some kind of stress-induced hallucination?

I grabbed my phone, my heart racing as I opened Tinder. There she was, our match still at the top of my list. But our conversation... it was gone. As if we'd never spoken.

Relief washed over me. It had just been a nightmare. A vivid, terrifying nightmare, but nothing more. I let out a shaky laugh, running a hand through my hair.

That's when I noticed it. A small, red mark on my wrist, right where Lily had grabbed me in the bar. In the dream.

As I stared at the mark, my phone buzzed with a new message. From Lily.

Lily: morning handsome ;) ready for round 2?

I dropped the phone like it was on fire, scrambling out of bed. This couldn't be happening. It wasn't possible.

But as I moved, I felt something in my pocket. Frowning, I reached in and pulled out a Polaroid photo. My blood ran cold as I looked at it.

It was me, sleeping in that box in the basement. And in the corner of the photo, just barely visible, was a pair of glowing green eyes.

I sank to the floor, my back against the bed, as the reality of the situation crashed over me. This wasn't over. It was far from over.

And Lily... whatever she was... she was coming for me again.

My phone kept buzzing with messages, but I couldn't bring myself to look at them. Instead, I sat there, staring at the photo, trying to make sense of what was happening to me.

That's when I heard it. A soft scratching sound, coming from inside my closet. The same sound I'd heard in the box.

Slowly, trembling, I turned my head towards the closet door. And as I watched, paralyzed with fear, the handle began to turn...

My heart pounded in my chest as I watched the closet door slowly creak open. Every instinct screamed at me to run, but my body refused to move. I was frozen, a deer in headlights, as the darkness within the closet seemed to pulse and breathe.

A pale hand emerged from the shadows, its fingers unnaturally long and tipped with sharp, black nails. It gripped the edge of the door, and I heard the wood splinter under its strength.

"Jake," Lily's voice echoed from within the closet, distorted and unnatural. "Don't you want to play?"

That broke my paralysis. I scrambled to my feet, nearly tripping over myself as I bolted for the apartment door. I could hear something moving behind me, a sound like a thousand insects skittering across the floor.

I made it to the living room before I felt something wrap around my ankle. I went down hard, my chin cracking against the hardwood floor. Stars exploded in my vision as I rolled onto my back, kicking frantically at whatever had grabbed me.

It was Lily... or what used to be Lily. Her body was twisted and elongated, more shadow than substance. Her face was a constantly shifting mask of features, only those piercing green eyes remaining constant.

"Why are you running, Jake?" she asked, her voice coming from everywhere and nowhere at once. "I thought you wanted this. You swiped right, after all."

I managed to break free of her grip and scrambled backward until my back hit the wall. "What are you?" I gasped out.

Lily's form solidified slightly, taking on a more human appearance, though still wrong in ways I couldn't quite define. She tilted her head, that predatory smile back on her face.

"I'm whatever you desire most, Jake," she said, her voice a seductive purr. "Isn't that what Tinder is all about? Finding your perfect match?"

She took a step towards me, and I pressed myself harder against the wall, wishing I could phase through it. "But I don't... I never wanted this!"

Lily laughed, the sound like breaking glass. "Oh, but you did. All those lonely nights, swiping endlessly, hoping for a connection. You were calling out to something, Jake. And I answered."

As she spoke, the room around us began to change. The walls melted away, replaced by an endless void filled with swirling colors and shapes. I could see other figures in the distance, trapped in bubbles of reality. With a jolt, I realized they were the men from the Polaroids in the basement.

"What is this place?" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

Lily spread her arms wide, her form shifting and twisting. "This is my domain, Jake. A place between realities, where desires and nightmares become one."

She leaned in close, her breath cold against my ear. "And now, you're a part of it."

I felt something inside me snap. Maybe it was the fear, or the adrenaline, or just the sheer impossibility of the situation, but suddenly, I was angry. Furious at being toyed with, at being trapped in this nightmare.

"No," I growled, pushing her away with a strength I didn't know I possessed. "I'm not playing your game anymore."

Lily's eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed dangerously. "You don't have a choice, Jake. You're mine now."

She lunged at me, her form shifting into something monstrous, all teeth and claws. But this time, I was ready. I ducked under her attack and ran, not towards any specific destination, but simply away from her.

The void around us churned and twisted, reality bending in impossible ways. I could hear Lily behind me, her inhuman shrieks echoing through the nothingness. But I kept running, my feet somehow finding purchase on nothing at all.

As I ran, I saw flashes of my life. My apartment, the office, The Rusty Nail bar. But they were distorted, twisted versions of reality. In each scene, I saw myself, but not quite right. Versions of me that had made different choices, taken different paths.

And in each one, Lily was there, watching, waiting.

I realized then what she truly was. Not just a monster, but a parasite, feeding on the loneliness and desperation of people like me. She was the embodiment of every bad decision, every moment of weakness.

But I wasn't weak. Not anymore.

I skidded to a stop, turning to face her. Lily was right behind me, her form a writhing mass of shadows and hate.

"Enough," I said, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me. "I'm done being your puppet."

Lily snarled, lunging at me once more. But this time, as her claws reached for me, I stood my ground. I thought of my life, my friends, my family. All the real connections I had, not the false promise of a perfect match.

"You have no power over me," I said, and I believed it.

There was a sound like reality itself was tearing apart. Lily screamed, her form dissolving into motes of light. The void around us shattered like glass, and I was falling, falling, falling...

I jolted awake with a gasp, sitting bolt upright in my bed. Sunlight streamed through my window, and I could hear the familiar sounds of the city outside.

For a long moment, I just sat there, my heart racing, trying to process what had happened. Had it all been a dream? Some kind of shared hallucination?

I grabbed my phone, my hands shaking slightly. There was Tinder, still installed. With a deep breath, I opened it.

My match with Lily was gone. In fact, her profile had disappeared entirely, as if she had never existed.

Relief washed over me, so intense I felt tears prick at the corners of my eyes. It was over. Whatever Lily was, whatever had happened, it was done.

As I set my phone down, I noticed something on my wrist. The red mark where Lily had grabbed me was still there, but it was fading even as I watched. Soon, it would be gone, the last tangible proof of my nightmare.

I got out of bed on shaky legs and made my way to the bathroom. As I splashed water on my face, I caught my reflection in the mirror. I looked... different. Older, somehow. Like I'd lived a lifetime in the space of a night.

But I also saw strength there. A resolve I hadn't had before.

I picked up my phone again, my finger hovering over the Tinder icon. With a deep breath, I pressed down, holding it until the app began to wiggle. Then I hit the little 'x', watching as it disappeared from my screen.

No more games. No more swiping. It was time to make real connections, in the real world.

As I got ready for work, I felt lighter somehow. Free. But I couldn't shake the feeling that somewhere, in some twisted corner of reality, Lily was still out there.

Waiting for the next lonely soul to swipe right.

It's been three months since my encounter with Lily, and I still wake up some nights in a cold sweat, the echo of her laughter ringing in my ears. The rational part of my brain wants to dismiss it all as a vivid nightmare, a product of stress and loneliness. But I know better. The memory of those green eyes, shifting and swirling with otherworldly malice, is too real to be a mere figment of my imagination.

I've tried to move on, to return to some semblance of normalcy. I threw myself into my work, churning out designs with a fervor that both impressed and worried my boss, Dave. He pulled me aside one day, concern etched on his face.

"Jake, buddy," he said, his hand on my shoulder, "you've been putting in a lot of hours lately. Everything okay?"

I nodded, forcing a smile. "Yeah, just... trying to stay busy, you know?"

He didn't look convinced, but he didn't push it. "Alright, well, don't burn yourself out, okay?"

But the truth is, I'm terrified of being idle. Because when I'm not working, when my mind has a chance to wander, that's when the doubts creep in. That's when I start seeing shadows move in the corner of my eye, or catch a glimpse of flowing dark hair disappearing around a corner.

I've stopped using dating apps altogether. The very thought of swiping through profiles makes my stomach churn. Instead, I've been trying to meet people the old-fashioned way. I joined a local photography club, started attending gallery openings, even signed up for a cooking class. Anything to make real, tangible connections with actual people.

But it's not easy. Every time I meet someone new, I can't help but scrutinize them, looking for any sign that they might not be who they claim to be. Are their eyes a little too bright? Their smile a little too perfect? It's exhausting, this constant vigilance, but I can't seem to shake it.

About a month after the incident, I broke down and went to see a therapist. Dr. Simmons is a kind, middle-aged woman with a no-nonsense attitude that I find oddly comforting. Of course, I couldn't tell her the whole truth – I'd have been committed on the spot. Instead, I talked about anxiety, about feeling disconnected from reality.

"It sounds like you've experienced some form of dissociation," she said during one of our sessions. "Often, this can be triggered by a traumatic event. Is there anything that happened recently that might have caused this?"

I hesitated, then said, "I... had a bad experience with someone I met online. It didn't turn out to be what I expected."

Dr. Simmons nodded sympathetically. "Online interactions can be very deceptive. We project our desires and expectations onto the person on the other side of the screen, and when reality doesn't match up, it can be quite jarring."

If only she knew how jarring it really was.

The therapy has helped, to an extent. At least I'm sleeping better most nights. But there are still moments when the world doesn't feel quite real, when I find myself questioning everything around me.

Last week, I was at a coffee shop, working on some freelance projects. As I was packing up to leave, a woman at the next table struck up a conversation. She was pretty, with warm brown eyes and a friendly smile. We chatted for a bit about the book she was reading, and as I was about to leave, she asked if I'd like to grab dinner sometime.

For a moment, I was tempted. She seemed nice, normal. But then I remembered Lily, how she had seemed nice and normal at first too. I politely declined, making up an excuse about being too busy with work.

As I walked home, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd made a mistake. Was I going to let one bad experience – admittedly, a supernaturally terrifying bad experience – ruin my chances at happiness forever?

When I got home, I stood in front of my closet for a long time, just staring at the door. Finally, with a deep breath, I opened it. Nothing but clothes and shoes greeted me. No writhing shadows, no monstrous hands reaching out to grab me. Just my normal, mundane closet.

I let out a shaky laugh, realizing how ridiculous I must look. This is what my life has become – being afraid of my own closet.

That night, I had a dream. I was back in that void where Lily had taken me, surrounded by swirling colors and trapped souls. But this time, I wasn't afraid. I walked through the chaos, my steps sure and steady. And as I walked, I saw the bubbles holding the other trapped men begin to pop, freeing them.

I woke up feeling... different. Lighter somehow, like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. For the first time in months, I felt like maybe, just maybe, I could move past this.

I'm writing this all down now, partly as a form of therapy, and partly as a warning. To anyone out there using dating apps, meeting strangers online: be careful. The person on the other side of the screen might not be who they claim to be. They might not even be human.

But I'm also writing this as a reminder to myself. Yes, there are monsters out there. Yes, the world can be a dark and terrifying place. But there's also light, and warmth, and genuine human connection. And those things are worth fighting for, worth overcoming your fears for.

I don't know if I'll ever fully understand what happened to me. I don't know if Lily was some kind of supernatural entity, a glitch in reality, or just a manifestation of my own fears and insecurities. But I do know this: I survived. I faced my darkest fears and came out the other side.

And if I can do that, I can do anything.

Tomorrow, I think I'll go back to that coffee shop. Maybe that woman will be there again. And this time, if she asks me out, I think I'll say yes.

After all, not every match is going to try to drag you into an eldritch nightmare realm, right?
