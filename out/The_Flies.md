Communication is my weakest skill. The knocking on the wall meant nothing. What does it mean, a knock upon the wall?

A knock on the door. That makes sense. You get your feet under you and you open it. Opening a wall isn't so safe, and it's better if you're sitting down for this.

How I ended up holding a sledgehammer in my scrawny arms, alone, smashing through the drywall between apartments, that's just how it started. I can't possibly explain what I am doing right now without saying why, without telling you from the beginning.

Perhaps if I were a better communicator, less of a loner, smarter, stronger, braver - things would be different. What would you have done, facing the same thing? Would you have survived to do what I am doing?

I'll let you be the judge of that.

After moving into my new apartment, I immediately began to unpack. That's the best way to do it, take everything out of the boxes right away, otherwise you'll get tired and put off unpacking those last few boxes indefinitely. Don't want to end up buried under boxes of hoarded clutter.

Not a hoarder? That's like saying not-an-opioid-addict. Status can change, and you'd be surprised how weak you actually are when your instincts start bullying you. My opioid addiction was cured, but I was still alone, ditched by all the 'decent people' in my life who were suddenly missing when it became obvious I had a problem.

I wasn't sure if what I was seeing was real, at first. I have seen things, my strained mind inventing artifacts and goblins where lamps or cats sat, or where there was nothing at-all.

So, I looked up and saw a large, bloated fly slowly chewing its way out of the white wall, dry crumbs and its teeth and dark blot churning and buzzing. I stared, a feeling of unease slowly beginning to rise inside my gaze, like a broken mote, a blood vessel with too much paint thinner dissolving it.

I put a piece of tape over it, when I decided it was real. I'm not sure how I found it scarier, when it was real or when it wasn't. I felt it pushing on my thumb under the tape until it pierced through, and the sting made me withdraw my hand, seeing a little red bead on the fingertip pricking. I went to the kitchen to rinse it, and heard a buzzing sound, as the fly entered my apartment and flew around crazily.

I felt a shudder, seeing the size and intensity of its presence. I wondered, if I was having a problem, something to do with my past, and decided this was independent. No, my past serves me only to isolate me and invalidate whatever I say. I hope that if I am honest about who I am and my weaknesses, I can find myself understood.

My attempts to swat it with a series of gradually upgraded objects within reach resulted in frustration and a feeling of helplessness. The fly waited until I was tired and then landed on the side of my neck and bit a hole in my skin. It hurt so bad I actually screamed and swatted at it with my hand, the rush of pain making my reflexes connect. I took my hand away and amid the sticky red cells was the blasted remains of the fly, looking like a tangled mess of guts erupted from its nasty insect body. It twitched and stared with its compound eye, buzzing in death.

I sensed its malevolence, its hatred of me. I felt loathing and disturbance, washing it down the drain. I was crying, from the pain and the feeling that my new home was invaded, somehow infested, and no longer safe.

Then began the knocking upon the wall.

From the same wall, someone or something was knocking, no rhythm, no sense to it. Nothing I could discern, just random knocks, some as a single thump, others a series of hits. Somehow I wanted nothing to do with it.

I felt cold, I felt like it was accusing me of something. Like I wasn't really cured. Like I am a liar and a fake. Still an addict, just better at hiding it. Just split between the me who needs to be seen and have friends and a life and the me who needs something else entirely.

I went to the far end of the studio and wrapped myself in a blanket and tried to ignore it. Each new knock sent shivers, made me feel more alone, more threatened, more exposed.

When the morning came, I hadn't slept. I went downstairs and met the attendant as he went to his office. I told them about the fly, the hole in the wall and the knocking. I was told it would be dealt with and to document the damage to the wall.

Nothing changed. While I was putting away the grocery delivery, I heard more buzzing. As I looked I saw more holes in the wall had formed, and large biting flies were burrowing into my apartment.

I tried spraying them with disinfectant, but it irritated me more than them. I swatted at them impossibly, and then they found me. One by one they flew at me and tried to bite me. I fled to the bathroom and locked the door. There were no flies in my bathroom, so I felt momentarily safe.

I was too terrified to go back out there.

I tucked towels under the crack in the door and slept on the floor in my bathroom, crying myself to sleep, terrorized by the swarming insects. I say swarm, but really there were only half-a-dozen of them out there. I hadn't seen them in large numbers yet.

My dreams tried to comfort me, reminding me of my Anthropology studies. She stood in the open with the aborigines and they told her to hold perfectly still and feel no fear. Millions of bush flies swarmed over them, coating their entire bodies. No bites, and the flies were only interested in eating the dust saturated in sweat off of their bodies. When everyone was sparkly clean, the swarm moved on.

I woke up and took a shower, not to get clean but to feel clean. Formication is the name of the sensation of having insects crawling all over your skin, and it is the worst thing to feel.

I felt it when I woke up, a dirty feeling, a cold dirty feeling. They were crawling all over my skin, and some had chewed entrances and now crawled underneath, making nests and laying eggs. That is what my body and my mind agreed upon, although I could not see anything.

I've felt this way before, but not when real biting flies were in my apartment. I let the water run until it went cold. My shallow breathing made me cough and turn the cold water off. I wasn't shivering. My skin was sensitive, and the cold water had helped soothe the unpleasant crawling.

Leaving the bathroom was a moment of dread. The flies were all landed, and I managed to get my work uniform, and get dressed in the bathroom. When I left they were watching me.

After work I stopped at the store and acquired a can of vespacide. The spray was an old school toxin, sold by a wizard, and if it could kill a murder hornet it could kill a mutant fly. At least that is how I regarded my weapon, as I rode the bus home.

Before I went inside, I hesitated. The stress of the last two nights was getting to me, and I was afraid to go in. Armed with the spray, I made myself go in, and mechanically and stiffly walked around, trembling and feeling on-edge.

When I saw one of the flies take off from a counter and make a beeline for me, I sprayed it. It retreated, flew in a death spiral and then fell dead to the floor. I let out some kind of noise in relief and victory. I stood there, waiting for any more attacks, but it seemed there was just one fly who wanted to test me.

I made dinner, nervous and keeping the spray close. At least I had a way to defend myself. Then, before I could eat, the knocking began.

Right away, I jumped and wanted to leave, with nowhere to go. Flies arose from all over and began swarming. There were at least twice as many, if not more, than there were before.

I jolted to the bathroom, spraying and praying as I went. The can ran empty, and I felt sick from the chemicals in the air. In the bathroom I opened the small window and turned on the fan. I stuffed towels under the door and did another night in the bathroom, crying and rocking myself while the buzzing and the knocking continued.

This is how it went, for two weeks, and I complained about it. My sleeplessness and the mess of my place and the stress and terror was taking a toll on me. When I asked for help, it was presumed I was having a relapse. Nobody believed what was really happening. I had no place to go.

My efforts to communicate, I mean, confront the neighbor, all failed. I complained to the apartment's but they told me they were working on it. One night, freaking out, breaking down, exhausted and persecuted, I banged on the door next door.

No response.

"So funny." I growled, when the knocking returned as I went back into my own apartment. I was frequently and painfully bitten, and my home had become a battlefield. When I saw the sledgehammer leaning against the portable potty next to our apartments, I stole from the worksite, promising myself I needed it and I'd put it back when I was done.

Had I lost my mind? I started going through the wall, first just making a window. Would flies come through the hole? There were already hundreds of holes they were coming through already.

They were buzzing loudly as I grunted and swung and broke. Chunks of the wall were all over the place, white dust in the air. I was being bitten and I growled and let out little shrieks of defiance. I wasn't going to live in terror anymore, I told myself, but I had no idea what I was doing.

When I'd made an opening, I got my flashlight out of the drawer. It was just a black hole, and a deathly silence hummed while the monsters waited for my final break. The beam barely cut into the thick black liquid darkness, and it was leaking like a slime from the hole in the wall.

The smell warned me. I dry heaved, and, feeling that this was all there was, I widened the hole until I could physically penetrate the nightmare on the other side. My godless horror had done something to me, while I kicked and screamed in panic within my own mind, I was in autopilot, recklessly discovering what would be my undoing.

All the surfaces were caked in flies, crawling in a silent dormancy. One cough, one trip and they would alight and chew off all my skin. Slowly, nervously, hideously driven forward, I pursued the source of my awful episodes.

All around were stacks of pizza boxes, bundles of newspapers, slain cockroaches and desiccating things resting in stale dust. The degree of garbage in the clutter was, in itself, disturbing.

Why had nobody reacted to my break-in?

Who had knocked upon the wall each night?

Yes, I discovered who. I found them there, at first a writhing mass of charnel worms in the shape of a person. I tried to throw up again, empty.

What I do not understand, about any of this, is how someone who was dead for so long had knocked.
