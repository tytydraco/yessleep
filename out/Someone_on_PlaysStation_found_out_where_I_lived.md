This story takes place back in 2019. 

Back in 2018, I started getting back into Playstation after being an Xbox player for a really long time. Some of the games I first played was Fortnite and Minecraft. The only people I would play with at first were the kids at my school. It was fun at first, but they started to become jerks. They not only were doing it online, but in-person. I eventually got sick and tired of all of the cyber-bullying that I just blocked all of them. I had to move schools too, but that’s for another time.

In September, I remember I started to make random online friends, but I more or less tried my best to make sure they were within my an acceptable age group (8-20 years old is what my parents allowed). I met some cool friends, and we had a lot of fun. As I made more friends, I would forget/abandon more friends, and you know how it goes. 

One way I looked for friends was via YouTube. I looked up small YouTuber who were around my age, and I found many of them. However, I found a YouTuber who had brittle bones syndrome. His disability isn’t necessary to know about, but he is part of the story. Anyway, we were in a party, and he showed me one of his friends. Later, his friend left and joined another party. When I joined the party, she introduced me to this dude who enjoyed playing Minecraft. At the time, I was trying to rebuild Disneyland, so he told me he knew someone that could help.

I eventually met the dude. He from Ireland, but let’s call him John. When John sent me a friend request. He sent a real name friend request. At the time, I learned that if you put your real name on PlayStation, people can see it if they sent you a real name request. John and I for a while used to play Minecraft very often. As I got to know John, I met his other friends as well.

As we were about to play a game in the summer of 2019, his friend (he had an Irish accent) comes into the party and ask, “Why do you live in (my town)”. This scared the living crap out of me. Keep in mind, I don’t live in a big city, I live relatively small town in the suburbs of Chicago. The fact that he knew where I live scared me to death. My “friend” repeated the same thing too. I immediately left the party, and told my dad. My dad told me it was probably someone I somehow knew irl. After that, I immediately blocked the both of them and never talked to them again. After that, I changed my real name on PSN. This is why everybody should be careful of what they do online. I felt a bit stupid for doing that, but I guess I was just very naive at the time.
