So I’ve been having sleeping paralysis for as long as I remember and when I was young I used to be really scared but now I’m so used to it that it doesn’t really scares me much but something weird has been happening lately. My sleeping paralysis or whatever it is called cuz I don’t know how to name it but it’s getting worse. 


Now I have horrifying dreams and in those dreams I feel like I’m about to die. I can feel something choking my lungs out and my eyes rolling back. So, I have three major experiences that I would like to list out that made me feel like this is might be something serious.


1. My brother and I went to our friend’s place for a sleepover and we were sleeping on the floor and suddenly I could hear my brother talking to someone at around roughly 4 am in the morning talking about someone trying to harm our grandmother.

So in my thoughts I was like if something is gonna happen it rather be with me than my poor grandma and as soon as I said that I could feel my back pain so much and it felt as if my soul was tearing up from my body and it was so so painful and I could see two figures like just shadow figures looking at my direction.

 Suddenly I felt my brother’s voice scolding me and demanding me to take back what I said so I did and it suddenly vanished then I woke him up and told him to pray for me and it felt right after that but the next morning when I told him about it he said that he saw two figures looking down at him too and him dreaming about my grand mom was actually real. It scared me to death but after sometime I got over it.


2. I went to my friend’s place last weekend and we had a good time catching up after so long. We drank a lil bit and smoked up a joint so when we were about to sleep I thought to myself that I was gonna have a great sleep but as I drifted off to sleep I was suddenly in some old house with pipe leakage and mosses everywhere. 

I was held hostage by someone and I was brought to the Mother who wanted to kill me and ISTG I could feel my eyes rolling back and seeing all white when they were strangling me to death. I called out God’s name and truthfully, it all felt good after that but I didn’t pay much heed to it because I thought it was all a part of hallucination bc I was high until last night which leads us to the third experience.


3. It felt same as the first experience but this time it was more painful and I was even choking to death plus the whole eyes rolling back and seeing white. I’m literally so scared now that it has gotten worse and it might get worse with time. So if any of you knows or might know what this might be about. Pls help 
Thankyou :)
