I'm writing this from my apartment. It's been [three months](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lumedf/there_was_a_strange_beetle_hidden_in_the_desk_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) since Uncle Joe found me in that house, running the Rug Doctor over the same patch of carpet for God knows how long. Two of those months were spent at Riverside Behavioral Health Center. The doctors called it a complete psychotic break.

I remember almost nothing from the collapse. Just fragments. Uncle Joe and my dad came to check on me after a week of silence. I’d apparently been awake for days, drawing bizarre icons and sigils on the walls in marker and chalk. Babbling about cosmic surveys. Reality bubbles. Finding patterns. Pages and pages of random internet searches printed out in stacks. Incoherent. They called an ambulance.

I was violent. Uncontrolled. Screaming at nurses. Cursing at doctors. Clawing at my throat until they sedated me and strapped mittens to my hands. The taste of metal was so strong I couldn’t eat solid food.

The official diagnosis: stress-induced psychosis with persistent delusional ideation. I take Risperidone twice daily now. Lorazepam as needed. The pills wrap everything in gauze. They don’t change what I know.

Six weeks ago, they let me out. I got a therapist referral and strict instructions to avoid “stressful research activities.” The social worker was very clear. No deep internet searches. No genealogy projects. No historical investigations. They were worried about my “obsessive information-gathering behaviors.”

I followed their advice for three days.

On day four, I was back at the library. I used the public computers because I didn’t trust my own connection. My starting point was the house. A simple search of county tax records gave me the name of the man who vanished before the bank repossessed the property. That name was the first thread.

I found his missing person report. Filed a year ago. The official record called it an isolated incident. But in the local newspaper archives, I found another story. A family that disappeared from a nearby town the year before. Any other researcher would have dismissed it.

But I wasn’t just a researcher anymore.

I could feel the shape of the pattern, even if I couldn’t see it all. For six weeks, I lived in the library’s archives. Scrolling through microfiche. Eyes burning. Decades of missing person reports and unsolved cases. I cross-referenced names with property deeds. Built a timeline. Plotted a map. Slowly, a cluster of pins began to form.

It was a ring of vanishings. All radiating from a single geographic point.

The records weren’t hidden. Public documents. Newspaper clippings. Police reports. But the connections were invisible unless you’d been shown the system from the inside. In 138 years, across over a hundred disappearances, not one investigator had ever connected the dots.

The pattern didn’t want to be noticed.

The information resisted discovery. Not through government cover-ups, something worse. Call it cosmic indifference. Reality bent slightly around the truth, making it dull. Making researchers lose interest. Making connections feel less important than they were. Making people move on.

I found it the second time I went looking only because I’d been inside the system. Because the entity showed me how insignificant our reality truly is. That revelation broke something in me. It made me immune to whatever force kept the pattern hidden.

Whispering Creek Valley was the center. An archaeological survey site. I found references to the 1886 Smithsonian expedition in archived correspondence. The team discovered geometric structures carved into bedrock. Alongside them: over hundred small artifacts made from a greenish stone no one could identify. The site was quietly classified. The artifacts scattered.

Then people started vanishing. 

But I’m still here.

For six weeks, I’ve tried to understand why. Why didn’t I vanish like the others? What made me different?

I don’t know. I have theories. They’re guesses.

Maybe the entity finished its survey and discarded me like a broken instrument. Maybe I was contaminated with knowledge. Useless for future data collection. Maybe it was random. A glitch in a system so vast our entire reality barely registers as a rounding error.

Or maybe I’m not done yet.

Maybe the others disappeared quickly, but my process is slower. Maybe I’m being dissolved gradually. Maybe I just haven’t noticed.

The uncertainty is worse than the knowledge.

Because what I learned in that temple wasn’t just about cosmic insignificance. It wasn’t just the revelation that our reality is one of billions. It was the understanding that we’re being observed. Catalogued. Measured. By entities that exist outside our dimensional framework.

We’re not alone. We’re specimens in a petri dish. Something vast and incomprehensible is taking notes.

Every human who ever lived. Every joy. Every grief. Every war and peace and birth and death. All of it is just data. Collected by researchers who will never know our names. Who wouldn’t care if they did.

The worst part isn’t the insignificance.

The worst part is coming back to a world where everyone else still believes their lives matter. Watching my parents worry about my mental health. Listening to Uncle Joe talk about house projects. Sitting in therapy while well-meaning professionals try to help me “process my trauma” and “develop healthy coping mechanisms.”

They mean well. But they don’t understand.

There’s no coping with the knowledge that everything you’ve ever cared about is just another data point in an infinite cosmic survey.

I want to tell them. I want to shake them. Scream that they’re wasting their time. That we’re all just temporary arrangements of matter in a universe that doesn’t know we exist. But I can’t.

Even if they believed me, it wouldn’t change anything.

They’d still wake up tomorrow. Go to work. Make dinner. Live their lives in a reality that never asked for their opinions.

So I take my medication. I go to therapy. I nod when Dr. Martinez talks about “reintegrating into normal social functioning” and “developing realistic expectations.”

But at night, when the pills wear off and the gauze lifts, I lie in bed and feel the truth settle into my bones like cold water. The metallic taste returns. Something stirs in my throat.

And I remember what it felt like to see our reality from the outside.

To understand how small we are.

How temporary.

How meaningless.

I don’t know why I survived. I don’t know if survival is the right word. I don’t know if the survey is finished or if I’m still part of it.

What I know is this: I’m trapped in a world that feels like an elaborate stage set. Surrounded by actors who don’t realize the audience left long ago. The play is over. The lights are dimming. But everyone keeps performing.

The scarab is gone. The entity has moved on. Cataloging other realities. Other collections of insignificant beings.

And I’m still here. The sole witness to a truth no one else can see. Carrying knowledge that makes every moment feel like watching a movie I’ve already seen too many times.

Sometimes I wonder if this is what hell really is. 

No fire or brimstone. No flame shrouded devils. No wails of the damned.

Just perfect understanding of cosmic indifference.

And the inability to stop caring about things that don’t matter.

The metallic taste is stronger tonight. I should take my evening dose. But I’m afraid it will make me forget.

Forget how important it is to remember that nothing is important.

I think I’m going to stop taking the pills.

It's not that I want to get worse.

It's because the gauze makes it harder to hold onto the only truth I’ve ever learned that actually matters.

Even if that truth is that nothing matters at all.
