Two days ago, my sister came over suddenly, looking disheveled. She is acting exceedingly bizarre, and I can’t figure out if I’m losing my sanity.  
  
For some much-needed context, my twin sister and I had always been very different. She was the type of person who wore Yoga sets to class and refused to eat anything that wasn’t vegan, keto, whole foods. She always had her hair slicked back into a tight bun and very minimal makeup on. I, on the other hand, loved horror, and all things related to it. I was into goth styles as a teenager, and some of it has percolated into my adulthood as well. Halloween was my favourite holiday, while Leah couldn’t get through even twenty minutes of a scary movie.  
  
Despite our differences, we had been very close all our lives. I was the one who introduced her to Chris in college. They had hit it off perfectly, and I had always felt like they were what soulmates looked like, so in sync with each other. I had been her maid of honour at her wedding, giving a speech on how some soul connections are not made, but discovered.

But, two days ago, I woke up at around 1 am to a loud pounding on my door. I jolted awake, looking around frantically to find some indication for the time. A single dot of light on the other side of the room stared back at me, signaling my laptop was charging. The room was unusually cold. It took some time for my eyes to get accustomed to the darkness. My head was pounding, and I groggily took my phone off of the side table. Seeing the time, a wave of panic spread through me. It was too late for visitors, and the pounding was getting really goddamn aggressive.  
  
I gulped and walked to the front door, the cops on speed dial. I looked through the peephole, and, calmed down. That’s odd. I could see my lister staring back at me. I opened the door. She looked messy, in baggy grey sweats, a black hoodie, and a pink T shirt, something I’d never seen her wear, and all of which looked like it hadn’t been washed in weeks. She smelled. Her hair was loose and filled with knots. She walked in without a word.  
  
 “Jesus Leah you should’ve at least screamed my name and said it was you, you gave me quite a fright just pounding on my door like that”  
  
She looked up at me, her eyes were bloodshot, like she hadn’t slept in days. Something was very wrong. “What happened to you?”  
  
She straightened her T shirt then walked straight to my bedroom, plopping on to the bed. “I’m divorcing Chris”.  
  
“What?”  
  


“We had a fight”

 

I wanted to ask questions, but I knew my sister preferred it if I didn’t. So, I handed her a glass of water and pulled out an oversized pink shirt for her to wear instead. “Take a Shower, I’ll be sleeping now, you can sleep on the bed, I’ll take the couch”  
When I woke up, it was around 9am. My bedroom door was open, and I could see Leah sleeping on the bed. It was weird, she was always up by 6 am, but considering how exhausted she looked last night, I let her. I got dressed and made some breakfast for her. Then, putting it on the side table, I left for work. Work was slow, and I kept thinking about what Leah had said.  
  
A divorce? Her and Chris? They had always been the perfect couple. I sent Chris a few texts, but he didn’t reply. After Work, I headed to Chris’, but his car wasn’t in the driveway, and the house looked eerily quiet. Sighing, I headed back home.

I opened the door, and walked in. The room looked the same as I had left it. I frowned, Leah was the type to tidy up every mess she sees, and yet my couch was a mess of pillows and bedsheets and the half-eaten bowl of cornflakes I was about to throw.  
  
I entered my bedroom, ready to finally ask her what the fuck was so wrong, but I froze. My sister was still sleeping. In the same exact position. Fearing the worst I held up my finger under her nose, and watched her chest, rise and fall, slowly. Yep, she was alive. I laughed nervously, relieved, and feeling sheepish about how quickly I jump to conclusions. I showered, and wrapping the towel on my head, I sat at the foot of the bed. I stared at her feet, just above her ankle, a couple of strands of hair were visible.  
  
 I raised my eyebrow.  She was the type of person who waxed obsessively. She used to get redness and irritation for waxing too often in high school, I had never seen a single strand of hair on her legs since then.    
  
I felt terrible. We hadn’t really been in touch these last few months because of how busy I was at work, and clearly something must be really wrong, he wasn’t herself at all.  
  


I scrolled through my phone, but the hair on her leg was really bothering me. One of them was a little longer than the others, and the insatiable urge to pull it out was consuming me. After some contemplation, I figured I would.  
  
I touched the hair, and pulled, slowly. But to my horror, instead of seeing a tiny hair being uprooted, I watched, as a long strand of dark black hair, dripping with blood began to come out. A scream was stuck in my throat, muffled by probably my gags, but my hands seemed to have a mind of their own, pulling, and pulling until it finally stopped. A tiny red dot remained on the spot from where I’d picked her hair. The bloody hair was about 3 feet tall. My hands were shaking as I quickly threw it on the floor and ran out of the bedroom. I couldn’t understand what it was I’d just seen. My skin was crawling, my head hurt, I felt horrified.  
  
I stood out there, the blood visible on my palms, it smelled like rotting meat. I washed, and washed, scratching till my hands were raw and red. I collapsed on my living room floor.  
  
 I looked to the side, at my bedroom and nearly got a fucking heart attack. My sister was now sitting up, many shadows obscuring her from me. I could make out that she was itching the part from where I’d pulled out the hair. Her head was turned towards me, her neck bent just a little unnaturally, her expression very uncanny.  
  
I watched as she scratched, slow at first, then so fast it seemed like she would maul herself. I could hear this unnerving sound, low, but steady of her long acrylic nails scratch her skin. A tiny piece of her skin had peeled out, and to my horror I watched as she pulled on it till it was long enough for her to twist it around her index finger. The smell of rotting meat filled my nostrils. She gripped her shin and then peeled a thin ribbon like piece of skin straight off of her, until it reached her thigh. It looked like stretching caramel as it finally reached the end of it, like peeling cello tape off of a gift wrap. At first there was no blood, but after a couple of seconds blood began oozing out of her leg. The scream from before just escaped. She was holding the piece of skin in her hand, now her attention on it instead of me. I watched as she sniffed it and then shove it into her pocket.

Before I could see much else, I ran like there was no tomorrow, jumped into my car and sped to my mother’s home. Her car was in the driveway. I pounded on the door “Mom, MOM it’s me, Iris, OPEN UP MOM please” but no one seemed to be home. I fell to my knees, bruising them against the pavement, scrambling for the spare key under a flower pot barely managing to open the door with my shaking hands. I sprinted to my bedroom, and locked myself in. I was crying, and heaving. I was scared shitless.  
  
I called my mom and sent her countless texts but no response came.  
  
After what seemed like hours, I heard the front door open, and my mom’s voice drifting up, calling out my name. I breathed a sigh of relief and unlocked the door peeking out at the landing where she was downstairs. I froze. To my horror my sister was with her. And she was looking right at me. She gave me a smile, a little wider than what seemed natural. She was dressed in my clothes. Her eyes seemed a little too large, and very red. She suddenly ran at me at speeds I didn’t consider human. Pure instinct took over as I stumbled backwards, barely escaping her and locked myself in the room again. It seemed like they’re pelting it with rocks, begging me to open up and have a talk.  
  
I don’t know when or how I fell asleep but now it’s 3 30 am, and the pounding has stopped. But upon pressing my ear to the door, I can hear the squelching of wet hair and smell the same rotten meat. So, I have come to reddit, to ask what I should do now.
