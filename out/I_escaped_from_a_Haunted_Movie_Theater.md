My friend Jake and I were shopping for our costumes at the Halloween Hut. He kept babbling on about some guy who found a creepy cabin in his basement.

“There is an old folktale about a witch who builds her house inside your home. People think the witch was the one responsible for the cabin..." Jake explained.

I didn't really pay him much attention. Jake loves his scary stories. True or not.

We paid for our costumes and finally left the store. It was a dark night and the costume store lied in an area with little to no buildings.

What little light there was came from lampposts scattered around the parking lot. A good handful of them flickered on and off.

I started walking towards our car when suddenly Jake called out to me, “Hey Matt, look! The movie theater is open!”

The movie theater was indeed open as I glanced over to it. Two spotlights shined over the front of the building, illuminating the giant worned out posters.

“Jake, it’s 2 in the morning.”

“It’s Friday night. A quick horror movie won’t kill ya!”

I sighed and reluctantly followed him to the ticket booth standing outside the front doors.

A creepy looking man greeted us at the window, “Good evening young lads! Ready for a unique cinematic experience unlike anything you've lived?”

He spoke a little funny but I was more taken aback from his appearance. Rotting flesh, missing limbs. Had it not been the last days of September I would be running to my car right about now.

“Nice zombie costume! The theater lets you guys dress up?” Jake asked.

“Why good sir. This is my uniform. All part of the immersive experience!”

“Cool. Anyways, you got any movies playing right now?”

“Just one...” he handed me and Jake a pair of tickets and waved us towards the door. Didn't ask for any payment.

“Sweet!” Jake retrieved the two tickets and dragged me inside. The lobby looked old and like it hasn’t been maintained at all. We approached the counter where another similar looking zombie-esque employee waited.

“How may I serve you fine gentlemen this evening?”

“A large popcorn and two sodas, please.” Jake ordered.

Jake usually ordered nachos and candy but I guess he was just trying to get into the auditorium as soon as possible.

We took our food and headed to auditorium 8. The hallway had the usual red carpet and posters filling the walls. All for movies I never seen or heard of.

We stopped briefly when the employee from the concessions stand came running to us with a pair of 3D glasses, “Forgot to give you guys these! You'll need them.” The employee then returned to the lobby.

We stepped inside the auditorium and took our seats in the middle. After a few minutes, without playing any ads, the movie starts.

A giant lake surrounded by trees in the night appeared. A tall bulky man with an axe stood by the lake looking directly at us.

He began walking to us for what felt like an eternity. “This movie is kinda slow don't you think?” I told Jake.

We watched as the man jumped out of the screen and inside the auditorium. I stood up from my seat and took off my glasses. The man disappeared.

I turned to Jake who did the same, “Yo...! What..?” I asked. Jake put his glasses back on and so did I.

The man now appeared in the row in front of us swinging his axe. I ducked out of the way and saw the axe slice through Jake's arm.

Jake screamed at the top of his lungs. Tears flooded out as he froze in shock.

Flight or fight instinct kicking in, I ran out the auditorium and down the hall. Various serial killers and creatures I recognized from the posters, came out of their respective auditoriums.

I tossed and rolled the trash cans to slow them down as I made my way out the movie theater. Running to my car, the employee at the ticket booth hollered at me, “Hope you had a wonderful time and see you again soon!”

I got in my car and floored it. Called the cops once I drove past a good 10 blocks. When they arrived they found the theater empty and abandoned as I had remembered it before Jake and I entered the Halloween Hut. Jake was nowhere to be found.

I still have the ticket from the theater and the glasses. Every now and then at night, I put them on to make sure none of them followed me home.

But every now and then. I don't know why this even occurred to me. I could maybe wear them one night and see my friend Jake again...
