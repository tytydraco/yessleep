I COULDN’T LEAVE.

I *TRIED*. I COULDN’T LEAVE.

When I woke up, my room was the *exact same* as I had left it. But I couldn’t leave.

The bedroom door wouldn’t budge. I yanked and pulled and even put a foot up on the wall to try and anchor myself but it wouldn’t move. Then, like a fucking cartoon character or something, I had BOTH FEET on the wall, pushing off as hard as I could to try and rip open the door and…! Nothing. I’m not an idiot, I know it wasn’t just locked- there *is no* lock on that door.

I freaked out. I needed to call someone. My parents know the code to my place, maybe they could come and help, embarrassing as it might be to admit I was trapped in my own bedroom. Or maybe a locksmith- if ANYONE could take down a door, it would be a locksmith.

I couldn’t call someone. My phone, which, I might add, had been left charging ALL NIGHT, lacked an OUNCE of power. It was useless. Just a little brick, only useful for checking a small rectangular sliver of my face for pimples in the reflection. 

I couldn’t even use my computer. It was closed and it STAYED CLOSED. I couldn’t get it open. I don’t mean I couldn’t turn it on, I mean I couldn’t get the fucking laptop open. It was like it was superglued shut- no, worse, *CEMENTED* shut. With concrete. No way I could get it to budge.

I was panicking. Soon enough, I was considering climbing out of the window but the curtains… Christ, it was like they were made of granite. Rustling limply in the soft breeze of the AC, I couldn’t- I SIMPLY COULDN’T- move them an ***INCH***. 

After minutes of trying, I gave up. My arms were sore and aching, as though I had been trying to lift a slab of marble over my head. 

Then, I saw it, as I leaned over, hands on my knees, heart racing and panting for breath. A crack. My closet door. It was ajar.

I BOLTED towards the door as if I only had moments to spare and tore it open. I won’t lie, that door swinging open gave me the strongest dopamine hit of my life. I HAD DONE IT! I HAD MADE IT! I WAS IN… the closet. Hooray. Smushed between hanging coats and a varsity sweater. Yippee.

I was overwhelmed. I was fucking overwhelmed. 

My vision blurred, my breathing shallowed, my heart skipped a beat and I fell to my knees with a loud thump. Instinctively, I called out an apology to my downstairs neighbours…

My neighbours. MY NEIGHBOURS!“HELP ME, PLEASE!” I screamed, pounding my fists against the wooden floor. My knuckles were bruised and purple. As a boxer, it’s nothing new for me but soon enough they were bleeding everywhere… Each hit left dots of smeared blood where my knuckles connected, some washing away in the tears which rained down from my eyes as I began to cry, snot filling my nose and dripping down my throat as I rasped, screaming for help.

But no one came. Noone responded.

I pressed my cheek to the ground, blood and tears streaking my face like face paint, and I listened. Nothing. NOTHING. Usually, it was a MESS downstairs. I lived above a dog groomer, and you have NO CLUE how loud those fucking dogs could howl, and DID, every day- except today. Today, it was dead silence.

Still, on my knees, I scrambled over to the bedroom door, smushing my face against the ground as I tried desperately to get my lips as close to the tiny sliver of an opening under the door as possible. Maybe my own dog would fare better.

“Quincy? QUINCY?!”

I was screaming. I was REALLY screaming. I screamed until I couldn’t scream anymore, and then I just kept on screaming. 

My dog was in a cage, as always overnight, but ohhh man, trust me. Quincy would howl her lungs out at the slightest noise she heard, every, single, time. 

Not today. 

Nothing.

Not a PEEP.

On ANY other day, this would’ve been the GREATEST thing EVER. Quincy, a dog so notorious for barking that the people downstairs, whose *job* it is to deal with dogs all day, are constantly complaining, finally shuts the hell up. Today it was the absolute WORST possible news I could imagine.

Was Quincy even still out there? I didn’t know. Was ANYONE still out there? I don’t know. How could I have known?

It was then, finally, as I lay there at the base of the door, panting and sniffling in a puddle of my own fluids, I finally heard *something*.

Voices. It was voices!!!

But I didn’t recognise these voices. I didn’t even understand what they were saying. They were low, quiet… almost a hum. I felt them buzzing in my chest, slowly wriggling into my ears. It felt like my head was dipped in honey. They slurred and garbled and jabbered at the threshold of audibility.

“HELLO?!” I screamed out with EVERYTHING I had left in me, and for a MOMENT, they stopped. The voices paused like they heard me! But moments later… right back to it. Talking in that low, indistinct tone, buzzy and baritone…

Shadows passed below the door. My eyes widened. I wriggled and writhed and even rolled over onto my back like a fucking dog, *anything* to get my eye under the door to see exactly what was out there, but I couldn’t. All I got was a shadow passing by the door, and then…

*Click*.

It was open. THE DOOR WAS OPEN.

Shooting to my feet I tore the door open. Where shadows were mere moments, nay, an INSTANT before, there was now nothing. I stepped out of my room, which had now been thoroughly soaked in blood, sweat, and tears, and shot my head around, looking for anyone or anything, but I saw nothing. 

I ran down the hall. There, in the living room, was Quincy. As soon as she saw me, she started barking her head off. I couldn’t help but scowl. Where was this when I needed it?

Tuning out her nonstop yapping, I ran around, looking for ANYTHING amiss. I guess I had thought maybe this was somehow the world's strangest robbery or something, I don’t know. And, as it turns out, there were things missing. 

But, no, it wasn’t my TV, or my PC, or my dog (oh thank *goooood*), or my ADD meds, or even my ACTUAL JAR OF CHANGE on my desk. No, nothing like that. 

Trinkets, knick-knacks, rubbish. A bottle of eye drops. An empty can of Coke Zero from last night's shawarma dinner. The STAND for my razor. A DVD of ‘Eraserhead’ (This pissed me off the most honestly). A small potted monstera I kept on my table. That sort of shit. Gone.

My front door was open. I ran outside. Nothing. 

People walked by, giving me glances as I stood on the sidewalk in my pyjamas, soaked in fluids. 

I couldn’t take it.

I just… retreated inside.

God, what the hell happened to me? I know it happened, I KNOW IT HAPPENED. That blood, that sweat, those tears, THEY’RE THERE. My stuff, it’s GONE. 

BUT WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO ME?!
