I don't believe in the paranormal, and I am certainly not a ghost expert.  But I have seen things i cannot explain with science. My story is 100% true. I know most people on nosleep probably say the same thing, but I promise I mean it. How can you know for sure? Well, I guess you can’t, so you’ll just have to trust me. The following events happened to me 16 years ago. 

I grew up on a small farm with my parents. We were a few miles North of a small town called Oak Ridge. The story started when two of the Mcconnel boys went missing. I wasn’t really friends with them even though they were the sons of one of our neighbors. But when I heard they were gone, it creeped me out. The whole town was on edge. 



I think everyone just figured they got lost playing in the woods, or something. There was a small search party, but they found nothing. 



To be honest, the Mcconnel boys weren’t the first. Every year, someone went missing in the night. Nobody really knew what to make of it.



Shortly after the Mcconnel boys went missing, I started hearing rustling outside my house at night. I told my dad and we went investigating in the morning. We found some tracks around the house. 



Dad didn’t seem paranoid, but mom was. She asked him if we could go stay with her folks, and he told her it wasnt an option. He said he was sure it was just a coyote. 



Me and Mom weren’t so sure. 



“What if it’s the same person who got the Mcconnel boys in the night?” Mom asked. 



“You know thats a bunch of baloney,” said dad. “Don’t even start. You’ll make the boy scared.”



He looked at me.



“There aint nothing to be afraid of, OP.”   
  


I didn’t really understand at the time. The disappearance of the Mcconel boys *was* scary. But Dad slept fine. 



A few days later, things got more serious. I kept hearing this breathy, rythmic sound at night, and one day, I found, well, I Found a bone in the grass outside our farm. 



It was all chewed up. I didn’t wanna touch it, so I got dad and he picked it up. “Dad, what is it?” 



“It’s a bone…”



“I know, but, why is it all chewed up? Do you think it could be-”



He stopped me mid sentence.



“No. It’s not that.”



“How could you know?” I asked. 

He was silent for a bit.



“Here, i’ll tell you what. I’m a doctor, I’ll test it for DNA.”



He picked it up and brought it into the house and into his lab. 



When Mom saw him bringing in a bone, she looked shocked, and scared. 



“Is that-”



“No,” Dad said.



“But what if it is? What if it’s one of the Mcconnel boys?”  
  


“It’s probably not.”



“We should at least dig around our house, I mean, it wasn’t part of the search area.”



“No!” Dad yelled. “This is lunacy. It’s a dog’s chewbone. We don’t have to keep obsessing over those boys. They’ll show up eventually, i’m sure of it, and it sure as hell won’t be in our backyard.  
  


Things were tense. They had been for a while. My parents weren’t exactly getting along lately, and dad was increasingly volatile. 



Anyways, the next day, dad walked into my room.



"I have good news and bad news,” Dad said. 



"So, what is it?" I asked inquisitively. 



“The DNA evidence is back. I ran it in my lab. It’s not a human bone, and whatever chewed on it is of a breed of dog. “



The thought has already crossed my mind. Some sort of animal? It seemed impossible. Whatever this creature was, it was more menacing than some dog. 



"’Its the DNA of a golden retriever."



"What?" I asked. It didn't make any sense. 



"It’s just a stray dog thats been walking round our house.” Dad said.



My dad is an idiot. The tracks were too big and monstrous to be a dogs. 



"What’s the bad news?" I asked. 



"Well, son, there's no easy way to say this." He sat down and put his hand on my shoulder. I cringed.



"Your mom... She... Has cancer."



"Huh?" 



"Yeah. It's terminal."



"I don't know what to say," I said. 



Dad seemed like he was trying to hold back tears. I could tell something was bothering him. 



"It will be ok, I said." 



"I'm sorry, I'm just worried about your mom" he said." 



He stood up, and put his hat back on. 



"Just try not to worry, ok? I’ll treat her. I know what I’m doing, I’ll make sure she gets a healthy dose of medicine," he told me.



"Whatever dad." 

  


A few days passed and nothing substantial happened. There were no new noises at night, nothing messed with at our ranch. Mom was in a downward spiral of depression and sickness though and she was more miserable then I have ever seen her in my entire life. She was vomiting and nauseous all the time. I decided to just focus on my schoolwork out of boredom, I think in a strange way I wanted the entity to show up to our ranch again. I wanted to prove to dad that this really was more than some dog.  



Then it did. 



I woke up in the middle of the night to the noise of rustling and that same, rythmic, breathy sound. I was terrified. I went to get Dad and Mom but they wherent there. Sure, dad went on his midnight walks occasionally, but he always did that alone. Turns out, they left me a note on the kitchen counter that they had to go to the ER and didn't want to wake me. Little did I know but that was the last I would ever see of Mom. She died that night of the cancer, but thats besides the point. 



I. Was. Terrified. 



My dream didn't help. I had just woken from a dream where I was in a field, at night, with the grass up to my waist, and I heard something run up behind me. I turned around, and saw a man, still, in the grass, as if he stopped the second I turned around. 



But he was not a man. 



He was wearing a suit, yes. A brown suit jacket and a yellow tie. I couldn't see his hands, they were covered by the grass. But I could see his face. I could see his snout, and his flappy ears. I swear, it wasn't as silly as this might sound. It was the worst nightmare I've ever had. It started talking. I couldn't hear a word it said, but I know for a fact that it's mouth movements were meant to communicate words. And as it went on, moving it's mouth, opening it's lips, up and down, flinging its tongue arouns as if to enunciate the right syllables, it became more aggressive, it's mouth opened wider, and it almost seemed to be yelling, as if it's mouth was the only group of muscles it could control. 



I cannot stress how unsettling it looked, even in the unsure haze of a dream. Imagine all of this with the face of a golden retriever. 



Anyhow, after I learned I was alone in the house,

I went back into my room after i grabbed my dads revolver, making sure it was loaded. I huddled up under my bed, with a blanket wrapped around me, and my pistol in my hand. I started crying, but tried my best to stay quiet. Everything was silent for a while. 



I felt a breeze but my window was closed. 



I heard some small footsteps, and at first I thought I imagined them. Then they got closer, and so did that rythmic, wet, guttural sound. 



It walked into my room.



It was not a dog man, it was something else, something worse. Something inhuman in every way. 



It was a massive, impossibly large golden retriever, with paws practically the size of baseballs, and a ears like mouse pads. It's coat was impossibly dirty, and I swear it's eyes were abnormally large and attentive. 



I was terrified. But I was also done. Done with the fear. Done with the terror. Done with the cancer. My fear had turned to rage, and I was finally ready to finish this thing. 



"Suck my dick cunt" I said, before I shot the monster in its eye with the bullet I secretly loaded into the revolver.



The creature's head practically exploded, as It let out a ghastly death roar. Everything was finally over. 



A few days later, I noticed a missing dog sign on one of those electricity log posts on the side of the road. It looked a lot like the creature.



It turns out that the Mcconnell family dog went missing shortly after their kids did.



 I think whatever this creature was, it killed the Mcconnel kids, and then their dog Ralph. I think the creature wore Ralph’s coat and imitated his likeness. I don’t know what it really looks like in it’s natural form. 



To be honest, I don't want to know.
