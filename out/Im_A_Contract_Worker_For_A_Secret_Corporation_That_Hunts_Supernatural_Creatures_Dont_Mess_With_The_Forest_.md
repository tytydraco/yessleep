[Previous: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h1h8bv/im_a_contract_worker_for_a_secret_corporation/)

I’d recently made a large payment on my medical debt. For the first time, it seemed as if I could pay it off within the next few years. But now my bank account was hurting. When August asked us to work together, I didn’t ask too many questions. I needed all the jobs I could get.  

When I arrived at the start of the forest trail I understood why August was so eager to take this request. It was a run of the mill investigate disappearances from the campsites. According to the email, three couples had gone missing without a trace. It was a bit odd that whatever had been targeting the campers was only taking them in pairs. But this forest felt a bit odd. But it was strange in a good way.  

The air was so fresh it felt almost like it removed any tension or stress from your body. The magic that ran through the trees was so pure I didn’t doubt creatures flocked here. The place just felt right. I wouldn't mind spending more time here.  

I adjusted the straps of my pack wondering why August was so late. Suddenly I was ambushed. Someone wrapped their arms around me from behind and started rubbing their cheek against mine. I let out a startled noise and shoved the person away.  

“What are you doing?” I demanded.  

August didn’t answer. He just attacked again. After a few seconds of the assault, he released me.  

“I’m getting my scent all over you. It’s better than any bug spray.” He explained.  

He was acting... different. His face bright and he couldn’t stand still. He looked like a kid on Christmas. I took a step away from him, but he didn’t notice.  

“I figured we should do this job together since couples are going missing.” He explained as he started to walk down the path through the woods.  

“We are not acting like a couple.” I announced.  

“I only brought one tent.” He said with a raised eyebrow.  

I made a noise he didn’t appear to notice. As we walked his eyes kept darting around. His hands turned into sharp claws, and I saw traces of his insect face start showing. There wasn’t a threat, he just wasn’t able to hold himself back. Out of nowhere, he shouted, his face fully transforming.  

“I can’t help myself! I'll see you later!”  

I watched in stunned silence as he bolted off into the trees. The last I saw of him was with his claws digging into the soft dirt so he could rub his face against the ground. It appeared like the air was a bit too good for him.  

I didn’t get upset that he abandoned me. I figured this trip would be good for him. From what I heard, he was born and raised in a forest by some mountains. After his home had been destroyed, he’d been stuck inside a city and going between jobs. I left him to do whatever he needed as I kept hiking knowing he would catch up.  

The forest was almost too perfect. I didn’t sense any kind of danger. Even the animals weren’t afraid of a stranger in their home. Since the last set of disappearances, the forest had been emptied of campers. I stopped by a few abandoned campsites looking for any signs of foul play. There was nothing that made me think the couples were harmed at each site.  

I wore myself out from all the travel. I settled on a campsite and got started on setting up the tent. Dinner was a can of soup. When it grew too dark to see I decided to call it a day. August hadn’t even sent a text yet. I was starting to worry about him. But I hadn’t gotten any kind of bad vibes from the place. Maybe he just lost track of time.  

I left the tent open in case he showed up. Not a single insect bothered me the entire time I was inside the forest. A cool breeze blew through the open flap of the tent which made me glad I could keep it open without worrying about getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. I was half inside my sleeping bag on my side almost asleep when I heard footsteps. I tensed up and grabbed the handle of the weapon I had borrowed for this job. It was an eight-inch blade that looked a bit like a regular kitchen knife. Listening while I kept my eyes closer, I waited for the person to get closer.  

“Are you asleep?”  

I let myself relax a little while I heard August speak. But something may be copying his voice.  I opened my eyes a crack to peek out of the tent to see his figure in the dark. I could easily tell it was him. Masking what your magic looks like was a very hard thing to do. I closed my eyes again as I listened to him climb into the tent.  

I expected to get settled into the sleeping bag that I’d set up beside me, but he didn’t. I felt eyes on me, so I rolled on my back to see what was going on.  

He had carefully positioned himself over my body. He smelled like river water and his hair dripped small droplets onto my cheek. August must have washed himself off somewhere nearby after digging around in the dirt. But why was he hovering above me like that? And why the hell was he looking at me the way he was?  

At first, I assumed he was joking around. Goosebumps appeared on my arms, and I wanted to push him away.  

“What the hell are you doing?” I hissed.  

“Couples have been disappearing. We should play the part.” He replied in a low voice.  

When he started to close the distance between us, I let out a shrill noise and tossed him to the side. I shot up ready to grab my knife in case he lost it. August started to roll around, cackling as he did so. I scowled when I realized why he was acting so weird. He was drunk.  

The magic in this area was too pure for him. I’ve heard of creatures getting high while being in places like this, but I’d never seen it before.   

“Go to sleep!” I ordered.  

With my face red I rolled back on my side and slipped the knife back under the thin pillow. August laughed for a little while longer. At least one of us enjoyed his little prank.  

“Do you like guys?” He asked.  

I felt my face grow a deep shade. I turned around to look at him confused over the question.  

“Who told you-” I started then realized I just outed myself. I rolled back in in a huff. “I prefer girls but there have been a few cute guys around lately. And no, I’m not talking about you.”  

After you saw someone eat a person’s brain out of their skull, it was hard to ever have romantic feelings for them. He finally settled down and I was hoping he was just going to drop all of this.  

“What cute guys?” He pressed.  

“No one you know. What about you? Are there any single parents you’ve met while dropping off Lucas?”  

I’d hoped that I could deflect the question back off to him to avoid answering it. I heard him stretch and shake his head against the sleeping bag.  

“There are a few single and not-so-single parents who appeared interested in me. But they’re not to my taste. I don't have any interest in that sort of thing right now. There isn’t any time between taking care of Lucas and staying on top of work. Besides, do you think a normal human could ever handle knowing what I am?”  

He was right about that. I’ve known about creatures since I was able to walk. I couldn’t imagine how hard it would be for a future romantic partner of his to deal with knowing he killed and ate humans. I still didn’t know how I felt about it. Or, what my feelings towards August really were. Are we friends? We acted like it. At the same time, I found that hard to accept considering what he was. For some reason, I was fine with Ito, Harp, April, and even Klaus. For some odd reason, it felt almost wrong to accept that August and I were close.  

“It’s all a bit tragic.” He spoke in the darkness, his voice carrying an unusual weight. “Things would be far easier if we were all truly the monsters humans see us as. The ability to feel love may be the cruelest trick played on all of us.”  

I stayed silent letting his words turn in my head. When I looked over my shoulder, I saw August had fallen asleep.   

He was right. It was cruel. The world would be so much easier to deal with if every creature had no remorse and slaughtered humans for fun. Sure, there were some out there that had hearts darker than the bottom of the ocean. But there were also supernatural creatures who loved and cared for humans. They would risk their own lives to save them. Like August, some also preyed on humans as a food source all while being able to deeply care for them.  

The Hunters saw all supernatural creatures as something to be erased from the world. They considered magic unnatural and while they tried to save people from bad monsters they killed the good ones too.   

Some days it felt like there were no right answers. Nothing was black and white when it came to supernatural creatures and humans interacting. If I called August a friend, I bet there would be a few people who would condemn me for it. He’d killed people and they wouldn’t care if they were good people or not. I didn’t consider their views invalid. It was all so damn complicated. A few years ago, I decided to not care about what others say about my relationships with creatures. My feelings were the only thing that mattered in my life. And I found myself unsure of my feelings towards August.  

These kinds of thoughts went through my mind as I let myself drift off to sleep.   

I wasn’t certain of what time it was when I woke up. The world was nothing but grey. I sat up to look outside the tent. A dense fog blocked my sight of anything beyond a step or two from where I sat. I felt a bit tense, but at the same time, I couldn’t sense any kind of threat. Reaching over, I shook August trying to wake him. His eyes remained closed, and his breathing was even.  

I shook him harder. Nothing.  

I didn’t want to talk just in case something else was listening. Grabbing my knife, I poked the tip of a finger to make it bleed. Very carefully I rubbed a few drops of blood against his lips. Then I went so far as to rub his gums. Again, nothing.  

He was out for an unnatural reason. I was alone to deal with whatever was going on. Slowly I left the tent gripping the handle of the knife tightly.  

The magic of this place was too dense. Everything was too bright to see when I looked carefully, trying to spot any kind of danger in the mist. My eyesight would be useless right now. It looked like my only real choice was to call for some help. So of course, my cellphone wasn’t working.   

Magic didn’t agree with technology. My phone was beefer than most and should have been able to handle some magic, but not this much. This worried me. I wasn’t the strongest and August wouldn’t wake up. The magic of this forest was too pure to even consider using. It would fry me even if I took a small amount to fight with. My knife felt too small for comfort.   

Shapes started to appear from the fog. Twisted hands reached out. I quickly slashed at them, the silver-tipped steel easily cutting through wood. As the threats got closer, I saw they were made up of branches and moss. Some appeared human and others were a mixture of human and animal features. They were easy enough to take down, but I wasn’t certain how many of them there were. If they had been made from the magic of this forest that would mean their numbers could be endless.  

A long vine lashed out. I jumped over it and focused on taking out another one of the attackers made of twigs. That was a mistake. The vine reached into the tent grabbing hold of August by the ankle. I noticed in time to cut the vine in two. The effort was for nothing. The vines suddenly started to overwhelm us. I couldn’t fight off so many with just my knife.  

I lost the battle within seconds. The rough vines tore at my exposed skin. They ripped through the sleeves of my shirt and caused deep cuts in their wake. I gritted my teeth trying to push through them. One as thick as my arm wrapped around my waist. Another bent my wrist back so I would let go of my weapon. My body was slammed back and forth between heavy tree trunks until it was certain I was too stunned by pain to fight back then it dropped me.  

I landed on my stomach on the hard ground. My entire body ached. I felt something grab a hold of my wrists, then pull them painfully together against my back. No matter how much I struggled I couldn’t get my hands free, or even lift my body off the ground. I looked up expecting to see those monsters start attacking but I saw something much more terrifying,  

All the sounds stopped. The air grew so heavy it nearly suffocated me. My body started to tremble on its own. Another figure started walking closer at a slow pace. Each step made my heart beat faster. I didn’t need my sight to see the massive amount of magic it carried. Forests with a large flow of magic almost gain a personality. Each forest felt different, but they normally never gained a will of their own. Complex thoughts and emotions are normally impossible for such an abstract idea as the representation of the forest itself.  

When creatures like that come into this world, it causes a big stir. I think there may only be four or five people at The Corporation who were on the same level as a Will Of The Forest. They could almost be considered as Gods. And one was walking toward me.  

Since they don’t have physical bodies, they often gather what they can find to make one out of. The Forest was covered with a shawl made of leaves. A tower of antlers made up what should have been its head and face. It stood and carefully moved on feet stolen from a young deer. Eight human arms on each side came from the shawl and lined its tall body. Why do these kinds of monsters always take human arms?  

When it stopped a few feet away from me, it raised an arm. I thought I was dead in that second.  

The vines lifted August off the ground, his head still limp. His arms were pulled up to his side. I could do nothing but watch as the vines started to pull and twist his left arm. A voice I didn’t recognize screamed at them to stop as his bones were broken. His face twisted in pain, but his eyes didn’t open. More screams came begging for them to leave him alone. To my shock, I had been the one yelling without being aware of it.  

The vines stopped moving after his arm had been mangled. My eyes stung with angry tears. I hated how powerless I was at that moment.  

“Choice. Your life, or his.”  

The Forest spoke in an airy voice that chilled me down to my very core.  

I stared in disbelief. Was it lying, or would it really let one of us go? So far couples have disappeared. I knew if I refused to pick one of us, we would both die. A God-like power stood in front of me waiting for an answer.  

I closed my eyes and pressed my forehead hard into the dirt never wanting to ever have to make this choice.   

August wasn’t human. So, he should be the one to be sacrificed, right? He had at one point been so dangerous they placed a black collar on him. He's killed and eaten humans. He would have killed me when we first met if he’d gotten the chance. He was a monster.  

Who loved his son.  

I hit my forehead against the ground trying to not think about that. I would die if I let myself think of anything positive about him. But those thoughts didn’t stop.  

He was the best person to raise Lucas regardless of not being human. No matter what sins he committed in the past, an innocent boy shouldn’t go without his adopted father. All the stupid jokes and smiles came rushing through my mind no matter how hard I tried to block them out.   

How did I feel about him? What were we to each other?  

At this rate, I should be the one to give up my life. I had nothing but a mountain of medical debt. No family, only a few friends who could easily move on when I was gone. I was nothing. Not a soul would miss me.  

I gritted my teeth thinking back to two years ago. My partner had given her life for me. I’m still trying to get back on my feet. She would be insulted if I gave up now.  

I opened my eyes again to look around at my surroundings. Vines were ready and waiting to attack if I moved. More of those branch monsters also waited. My knife was directly in front of my face but my hands were still bound. August wouldn’t wake up. And we were facing a Forest with more power than anything else I’ve ever dealt with combined.   

“Times up. Pick. Yours or his.” The Forest spoke again.  

I had no chance of beating this thing. If we were both going to die, I wasn’t going to let it kill me without at least doing something.   

“Fucking neither.” I hissed.  

I sat up enough to bite down on the handle of the knife. I took in magic and forced it through my jaw to make it clamp down and stay shut. Saying that hurt was an understatement. I then took a huge risk of dispelling the magic around us. It’s a basic trick of enforcing your will outwards to push the power around your body away. If you don’t have enough power behind the request, the magic in the air explodes. My luck held out. The power forced back the vines and creatures but not the Forest.   

The effort burned every cell in my body. There was a reason why people don’t use that trick very often. I needed to act fast before the creatures recovered. Using raw magic has massive drawbacks. I gathered some from the ground and focused it on the bottom of my left foot. Using that power, I kicked off the ground. It was basically an explosion. Yes, I jumped eight feet off the ground, but it caused all the bones in my left foot to shatter. And I was going to do the same thing to my right foot.  

I spun so I was now facing the ground as my right foot hit a branch. I used double the power to kick off the branch and downward toward the Forest staring up at my actions. If I lived through this, it would take a lot of magic so I could use my foot again.   

I came down hard, driving everything I had into sinking the blade into the mess of antlers that made up the face of the Forest. I landed painfully on the ground, the knife still buried in the creature’s face.  

Rolling on my back I took stock of how I was doing. Both feet had been shattered. My jaw ached; my hands were still bound. Every ounce of my body ached. Oh, and the Forest was removing the knife as if it was nothing. Great. I was going to die and I didn’t even make a scratch.  

“Do you love him?” The airy voices whispered.  

I was about to pass out. My body was at the end of my limits. I slowly shook my head wondering if our deaths would be swift.   

“I... don’t know how I feel about him.” I said, voice rough.  

The antlers held no expression but to me, they appeared confused.  

“He’s done some good things. And he’s done some bad things. I’m worried I’ll become a bad person if we become friends. It’s like... I don’t care about the bad stuff, you know? It's just... hard to explain and I don’t understand it myself. And I feel like his good side is... too good for me. Being human and interacting with creatures is so damn frustrating.”  

I doubted this creature had ever had such a weird answer to a simple question. Regardless, I didn’t pick either option so that meant it was the end for us. I let my eyes close wanting an easy and quiet death.  

I woke up with droplets of rain hitting my face. I hurt just as much as before. The world appeared grey, but the fog had lifted. August was sitting next to me, knees up to his chest and a confused smile on his face.  

“Something happened?” He asked.  

He looked fine. His arm healed without any issues. Most likely because of the pure air of this forest. I wish I was that lucky. When he started to help me move, I found out I was at least, a little lucky. The foot on my bad leg had healed to a sprain. But my other was still shattered. I didn’t know if the healing was from the pure air or if the Forest left a parting gift. August needed to help me hobble into The Corporation office to explain what happened. Thank God for magic doors.  

They were able to treat my wounds there. The foot brace I needed to keep on cost me the entire amount I made from that job. Still, it beat a broken foot. The small clinic area of the office was mostly empty. A nurse started looking over the wounds on my arms when Klaus came inside. He took over so I could give my full report as he worked. It felt a little bit weird to have him fussing over me. I honestly didn’t know his position or job title. He seemed to be the person who collected all the information about the jobs, and nothing much more. Based on his old scars I assumed he was semi-retired.  

“What happens now?” I asked him after my arms were finished getting wrapped up.  

“You take some bed rest, Mister.” He said with a sharp inhale of breath.  

I think he was annoyed I nearly died. Again.  

“You know what I mean.” I pressed.  

He leaned back in the chair, arms crossed, and with a large sigh.  

“You already know. We’ll do whatever we can to ensure couples don’t camp inside that park. If the Forest switches who they target, we’ll deal with it then.” He admitted.  

I wanted to be angry, but I felt too damn tired. That was it. The families of the people who went missing won’t get closure because the creature who killed their loved ones was too powerful to deal with. This sort of thing happens far too often. I shouldn’t be upset over it, but I was.  

“Why did it let us go?” I asked honestly confused about why I was still alive.  

“Well, that’s an easy answer. You’re amusing.” Klaus said, flashing a smile.  

I frowned, not liking his answer.   

“No really. If we know then maybe someone else could be saved.” I pointed out.  

He shrugged shaking his head.  

“Who knows why some creatures do what they do? It could be for a complex reason humans may never understand, or just because they felt like it. It’s what makes this job so damn hard. Either way, you're alive. August gets to go home to his son, and we’re all thankful for the positive outcome. I don’t get to see enough people coming back safe. There is a reason why these beds are empty.”  

I felt my stomach drop at his words. I was the only one getting medical treatment at that moment. I almost felt guilty for complaining as much as I did. Klaus stood up and made me promise to get some rest. And to also watch out for August. He heard I broke a few bones and was convinced that eating hardboiled eggs with the shell was a way to get them to heal faster. I prayed Lucas never got sick or hurt because of how well-meaning and misinformed his adopted father could be.  

I can walk around with the magic foot brace. But for once I listened and stayed in bed to rest. I hated being in one spot though. The idea of that Forest being free to take any victims it pleased bothered me. I hated how powerless I was. But that’s how it was with magic. The more experience meant more strength. Humans simply didn’t live long enough to compete against monsters. I should just be glad I was still alive after everything. While on bed rest I called Ito to see how his jobs were going. He was fairly busy so we couldn’t see each other, but at least talking to him helped me get my mind off of a few things until the next job.
