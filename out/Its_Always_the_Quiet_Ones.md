It's always the quiet ones. Everyone says that when there's another mass shooting, or a child goes missing, or a coworker kills themselves. Everyone sees the quiet ones as “other,” not like them, and by default, wrong. Like attracts like, so if one sees themselves as “normal” or “well-adjusted” and they aren't silently lurking in the backstage of their lives, the quiet ones must be the people with disease or disorder or Something Wrong With Them.

You probably guessed by now that I'm one of the “others,” which would be a correct assumption. The assumption that you have that is incorrect, however, is that we are the ones who are wrong. I think so, anyway. See, if I had been your normal, friendly guy, I would be with the rest of them. That is to say, dead.

I should explain.

I am what the comic strips used to call a plugger, basically, but you can just call me boring. I keep my nose on the grindstone, I do my work, and I call no attention to myself.

Everyday I wake up at 7am, and five days a week I go in to work for eight hours. I take lunch when I am told, where I eat the same thing I prepare myself each day. I get caught in the same traffic on the same route on the way home, I eat one of three dinner options, watch TV, and go to bed by 10:30pm.

At work, I have no “work wife” or whatever; frankly, I have no work acquaintances, and certainly no friends. My boss rarely checks in on me because I steadily produce proficient work. I am nothing if not consistent.

No one ever notices me, and I mean it. Today, that saved my life.

Around 9am, the morning meeting let out of the glass-walled conference room. I attended it everyday, and today was no different.

Until Rhoda made it back to her cubicle. That's when the screaming began.

“Joel! Jesus Christ, Joel, are you okay?” I heard toward the other end of the room. My office was by the doors, and Rhoda's was by the cafeteria.

Rob from across the way shuffled over to see what she was yelling about. “Rho, what are you – *fuck*,  man, what is that?”

A thick squelching sound filled the air, followed by a heavy thud and Rhoda screaming again. “Rob, oh my God!” She was cut off here, and another thump echoed through the office.

The building began to fill with the hum of dozens of humans, desperately seeking answers and only being met with horror. Hearing the crescendoing commotion, I instinctively tucked myself beneath my desk.

In about twenty minutes, the ado had turned into the occasional “oh god” and sporadic whimpers. “P-please,” I heard from maybe two cubicles away. A slick sound cut the air, and I just knew the last survivor had slumped to the floor.

I was frozen. The squelching made its way closer to me – found its way into my cubicle – and as it reached my desk, I held my breath. From my limited view, I could see thick, roiling tentacles leaving a plum coloured ooze on the shitty office carpet. One tentacle rose to my chair... and pushed it into my desk, like I had forgotten to in my rush to seek shelter.

The hulking figure made its way out of the cubicle, and soon after I heard a door shut quietly.

I must have waited hours before I felt safe enough to stick my head out from my cubicle. No sign of the creature remained. I watched as the rugs sucked up the glistening goo it had left in its wake.

Staggering stiffly to the exit, I found it was stuck. A dull panic filled me until I beat it back, reminding myself that finding another exit would suit just fine, and it was the real priority at the moment.

As I crossed the room to exit through the staff caf, I heard a rustling from a cubicle. I had been avoiding looking within, knowing I would only see atrocities, but now it seemed inescapable. Grabbing a recycling bin like it would protect me, I turned the corner to see what made the sound.

“Oh!” is all I could muster. A woman I had never seen emerged, holding a stapler. She was half a foot shorter than I was, a stringy thing with vibrant red hair. She looked like she worked here, but I failed to recognise her.

“You...you made it, too?” she whispered.

We sat together on the front lawn of the office park for hours. Joy – that's the redhead's name – was like me, only she knew a lot more about what had happened.

“I've seen them before,” she said quietly.

“*Them*?” I asked. “There are more?”

Joy gently placed her fingers on my arm. “There are others, yes, but if I'm right, then I think you have nothing to worry about. How long did you say you've been working here again?”

“Seven years,” I said, failing to fully take the puff out of my chest that showed my small lick of pride.

“And I never noticed you,” she said flatly. I deflated a bit after that. “But,” she added brightly, “you've never noticed me either. And I've been here just as long. That's a good thing!” Joy had seen the look on my face, the chagrin and the peevishness.

“Look, these things are a threat, but not to us. From what I've pieced together, the way they detect us is by our perceptibility from others of our species. It makes sense – wouldn't we be great bug killers if we saw them how they saw each other? We'd be so much more in tune with them... but that's the thing. You and I are the woodwork to other people, and nobody pays attention to us. We're basically invisible...and to the monsters, we actually are.”

“So they don't see us because our own don't see us?” I said, starting to grasp the concept.

“Exactly. Being inconsequential – sorry, Matt – has saved us. We don't matter enough to be seen, so we didn't matter enough to die. No one noticed if we were or weren't there, no one had to make moves to see if we were okay or not. The creatures couldn't see us because no one thought of us, because no one ever thinks of us.”

“Do you think that's true?” I asked, parsing together my own thoughts. “Or do you think we were chosen?”

“Chosen?” Joy said, skeptical.

“The quiet ones...maybe we're left as a witness; we're not destroyers, and we're not the victims. Maybe we were left to be a mark of what happened.”

“Maybe,” she said. “But who will ever believe us?”

This was a year ago. Joy and I are now engaged, and both in therapy. I thought maybe we were living happily ever after until last week: walking to meet my fiancee at a cafe by her new job, I stepped in something thick, something sticky. It was purple.
