Elevators. A way to make our lives more easier, but for me it had the opposite effect. Instead of making my life better this elevator made it infinitely worse. Hi my name is Martin, I'm your average person with a very normal life, and a normal family. I'm not rich, but I'm also not poor I'm in between. 

It all started that day when we had a big project at work. After weeks of work we finally got it done. I was so tired that part of my head had started to hurt. I drank some medicine to help with my headache and I immediately went out of my office to the hall of the building. 

It was my son's birthday today and we were going to celebrate in the house with some cake. 

He wanted me to be home early and I somehow got out of work at 6Pm which was early considering my work ends at 7Pm. I go to the elevator (I'm at floor 11) and I press the ground button. The elevator doors close and I check my phone for some texts. 

After about 30 seconds I look back at the floor I am in and I was at floor 9. That was weird...... Our elevator takes about 4 seconds to go to each floor and it was taking very long for this elevator to go down. 

I thought it was just my excitement that time seemed slower so I ignored it. After about 2 minutes I reached floor 7. I was starting to panic. Why was the elevator taking so long? 

The elevator lights flicker and the numbers on the elevator were nothing I have ever seen before. It was changing numbers from 7 to 928 to -21. What the what is going on? 

I press the elevator buttons frantically until the elevator comes to a sudden stop. The lights become more dim and the elevator doors open. It was the parking lot. But this parking lot isn't the same as the usual parking lot. 

For starters there weren't any cars here. Every single car was gone and it seems like a few lights were missing since the parking lot was almost pitch black. The lot numbers were way above the usual amount. The numbers start at 1023 when the parking lot was only supposed to have about 400 spaces. 

I try to take in all that was happening and I barely kept my head from hurting. After a few minutes I walk around and try to explore this place. 

I cluelessly wander and the lights close. I start to hear a beautiful voice in the distance, a voice so mesmerizing that I knew it wasn't from this world. It is calling me and I slowly lose control of my body. The only thing on my mind now is finding that soothing voice. 

I was so close to finding it, but i remember my son. I remembered that he needs a father, he needs me and this is not the time to die. 

I snap out of the and as soon as I try to run away the voice transforms into a scream. I can't even begin to describe that because the sound was so horrifying and horrible that I felt blood coming out of my ears. I panic and started to run for my life. How will I escape this? 

I kept running in the dark and I hear more of those screams coming closer. I run while feeling so dizzy that I could fall any moment. I go into the elevator which was the only place that had light. As soon as I got into the elevator all the screams stopped, but the lights stayed off. They couldn't go towards the light even if the elevator doors were still wide open, and if I stayed in the elevator I would be safe, or so i thought. 

There were shadows that looked like people, but with all that has happned I know that those are not humans. There was a clock on top of the doors and the floor number was now 666. That's when it hit me. I'm now in he*l, but it's not just he*l, this place is worse than he*l, it's hell and beyond. 

If I ever get out of this, I mean *when*I get out of this, I will never go to an elevator ever again. I stayed in the elevator for hours while the ticking of the clock almost made me insane. That's when the voice started to sing again. This time I fought the voice for my dear son and was able to stay in the elevator. 

The clock's ticking only made it worse. Sooner or later insanity or that voice will get me killed. I dont know how long I can last here, but the only thing I know is that the moment I lose focus I will head into the darkness and die a gruesome and bloody death. 

Tick..Tock..Tick..Tock

I will update you guys if I can. I can't promise it
