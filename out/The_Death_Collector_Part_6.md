Edit-- I can't fix the title but this is actually part 5, sorry for any confusion!

It's been busy with work but otherwise quiet since I last posted, so I thought it was a good time to share another secret with you all. Since people have been leaving more name suggestions I figured I can start going through them in order for a while, I take each ask as a sign that it's their turn to have their story shared.

With that in mind, I'd like to introduce you all to Kim.

It was mid spring when her oldest child Karen reached out to me, and unfortunately the woman lived up to her name. Had something to add about every question on the paperwork, every word I spoke to her, and every red cent that went into the job. Sitting in the room with her was only made somewhat bearable by the fact that anytime she mentioned something more personal about her mother she would need a second to compose herself, and it reminded me that maybe the way she was acting was due to stress or at least that the loss was making her more irritable with someone associated with it. Since she seemed to genuinely miss and care for her mother I was curious about what they wanted me to do, and when I was told that she owned a second property out by a well-known lake in the area, I have to admit I was surprised. By this point in the job I had dealt with whole houses, single rooms, sheds, garages, all sorts of configurations of private spaces. But never an entire secondary house. That kind of money wasn't exactly easy to find where I'm from. I think she could tell that this surprised me and she seemed smug when she told me that their mother's house was going to be a "pretty massive undertaking" in itself without the "quaint lake house" to worry about too. I let it go though. She could be smug about her money all she wanted as long as I got my share of it, just meant I could be confident about my pay.

As I continued to speak to the family about the job in terms of what they wanted, the location, and how to get to the place in the first place, I quickly learned about the deceased's interesting quirk with family names. In order, the children I spoke to were Karen, Kyle and Kylie (twins I believe), Kevin, and Kayla. I think the husband was even named Karl, and yes, it was specified that it was with a K by a bemused Kayla after she realized I'd picked up on it. Kayla was the one that ended up getting "saddled with me" the most often, including taking me for an initial drive to scope out the property, and she was certainly the most sociable of the lot. She had a sense of humor for one thing and took a lot of pleasure in listing their pets and the K names the poor things were saddled with, such as Kujo. Yes, also with a K. By this point I probably had some expression of growing confusion on my face because Kayla was laughing pretty hard.

When I finally had everything in place to go up there on my own, something that had taken longer than usual due to Karen wanting to make multiple revisions, I was eager to explore. Especially because of one of the details Kayla had slipped to me during the first walk through.

This place doubled as an AirBnB spot along with being a winter getaway for the family.

Of course, I still needed to do my job by the usual rules. Since they had stayed in the cottage only a few months prior there was a few garbage cans to be dealt with, including sorting out the recyclables as I usually did, and some mild cleaning up to do that could be expected with somewhere that had experienced the day to day of someone's routine. I found a few things during this that seemed like potential sentimental items or things left behind by someone who had stayed over the summer and were set aside--a pacifier with a butterfly pattern for the "button", a Chiefs jersey that I remembered being told was their parents' favorite team, a small vanity plate that you can find at souvenir shops, a rainbow dinosaur pop-it, and a pair of dangling skull earrings that had each member in different rooms of the house. I had already put together one of the folded up boxes from my bag at this point and they all went in there so I could go through them in one call.

Then I was ready to check out the little "ledger" by the door.

Kayla had mentioned during the visit that one of the kids usually took care of the technical aspects for the AirBnB, so Kim had set up a little ledger like a motel so she could get reviews and messages somewhere she could actually look through them easily. Apparently this was well liked by most of the guests so it had something from most visitors, but that the family didn't have any interest in it now that they planned to sell the cabin. I kept it to myself but I honestly thought it was a waste to get rid of such a nice place, even if it was out of the way. Regardless, I'd made a note of the ledger during my walkthrough and had prioritized it as my first item for the "search" portion.

I took it over to one of the recliners by the fireplace and started thumbing through it, starting with the older entries and focusing on any that seemed interesting.

>8/10/15

>Beautiful little cabin, perfect spot for me and my family to spend time together this summer. I appreciate how  cozy everything was kept and how easy it was to find, and it was so kind to let us use the lake equipment. The boys loved trying tubing!  
I'll be putting it on the app too of course but easily 5 stars for me!

There was a cute smiley face drawn next to the review and under it a few drawings that were presumably from the aforementioned "boys"--a doodle of two people in a tube being pulled by a boat and a drawing of a deer along with "thank you!" scribbled in two different colors of crayon. Very sweet, I imagine that Kim loved getting that. In fact most of the reviews were around 5 stars, with a small scattering of 4.5s and 4s among them.

>8/5/16

>A little disappointed there wasn't more around here, I kind of expected this to be near a campground or something. I guess that's more on me though for not doing research or asking questions. The lake was nice and my boyfriend and I enjoyed fishing and swimming near the house. The house was also cozy in terms of the aesthetic and stuff but I wish there were central air or something, on hot days we were just stuck in one of the two rooms with the ACs. At least when we were stuck inside we could watch the deer out the window, they seem really friendly. I guess 4 stars.

Wow...rude. You got to stay at someone's house, be grateful. It sounds like they still had a good time anyway so not sure why they were so picky. Other than it being one of the few 4 star reviews the thing that caught my eye on this one was that they attached a printed out picture to the page. It was of the view outside one of the windows with one of the deer fairly close to the cabin, a few others hanging back closer to the tree line like they had sent it to scout for them. A sharpie had circled this deer and a marking on its back that I otherwise might have missed, a scar or out of place patch of fur that looked like a star. Under it, the person had written in the same handwriting as the review "I called this one Orion, if no one else named him then please keep it!"

Really? You were nitpicky about their house and then asked them to pick your name for one of the local deer? Personally I would have gone with Polaris or something but not my business. It was a cool deer though, especially since there was an easy way to tell him apart. Out of curiosity I went back to the drawing under the first entry I looked at and, lo and behold, the little doodle of the deer had a star on it also that I hadn't registered the first time around. Most likely because kids tend to have "creative visions" for their drawings that may or may not match up with reality, such as the boat that was pulling the kids having rockets coming out of the back. Still, it was a fun coincidence, and showed that the deer had at least been around for a year at that point.

>6/22/27

>Hunting out here wasn't what I expected. These deer are weirdly smart for being so friendly. When we're in the cabin the damn things will almost come up to the windows, especially this one buck, but once we're actually out there with the guns it's like they vanished. Fishing was fine though and I appreciate the dock out there to fish off of. 4 stars but only 'cause I really wanted to take a buck home with me, might wanna add a note to the listing that it might not be a good fit for hunters.

Like the other listings that had caught my eye this one had an additional detail, in this case a detailed drawing of the buck he'd mentioned that looked nearly photographic in terms of quality. Whoever this hunter was certainly had more talents than just shooting and fishing. The buck in question had a few traits circled with notes on them from the hunter, the picture itself labelled with "keep an eye out for this one".

The first of these traits was a the horns, which were drawn with unusually sharp prongs to them and labelled with "looked pretty gruesome, saw it sharpening them a few times on the tree closest to the back door". Next was the eyes, which it took until after I read the description to notice were unusual: "looked almost like goat eyes. I've seen a lot of deer and they ain't supposed to have sideways pupils like that". The legs were noted to be "pretty damn muscular for a deer" and that the hooves "had a weird amount of fur around the hoof". The last thing though was what stood out the most to me though, a band of scar that looked like a star and the note with it saying that it "looked kind of like a brand". In particular I was able to see more clearly that the orientation was wrong, with the point downward. A pentagram, not a star. Hell of a weird thing to have on a deer, especially branded. I mean, not that branding deer was normal to begin with.

I skimmed back to the review with the picture on it and held it closer to my face to inspect it more closely. Yeah, that was a pentagram alright. The drawing the kid had made was a star, but the picture corroborated the hunter's drawing. I also looked closer at the eyes but it was hard to tell if they were "goat eyes", but I can at least say with confidence that they were unsettling. The more I stared at it the more I felt like it was looking back at me.

I went back to the most recent entry I read and started skimming the reviews themselves a bit more, looking for the word "deer" and finding it pretty often. Some mentioning how nice it was to see it so close or how much the kids loved seeing it and others more weary or mentioning its behavior was unusual.

>...deer stood in front of the car when we went to leave...  
...the kids swore they almost got to touch the deer's nose it got so close to them...  
I don't know what's wrong with it's eyes but I ended up shutting the windows...  
It feels like the forest is empty unless I see it, that deer seems to be in charge as silly as that sounds...  
...took one of my fish, I swear, I don't care if deer don't eat fish....  
...found my youngest in a deer nest in the middle of the night, good thing it's so safe around here...

I became more and more concerned until there was a review that didn't just mention it, but was completely *about* it.

>7/12/19

>I don't know if you're aware, but you need to sell this cabin. Luckily I was here alone, but it is *not safe* for you or anyone else to stay here, especially little ones.  
I noticed a deer with a pentagram scar, which was concerning enough, and then saw that people have been mentioning it for a long time. I'm not going to put the following on the app because I remember the nice young lady that I spoke with mentioned that her mother only reads the ledger here, and I need you, ma'am, to realize how serious this is.  
Something is very wrong with the forest here. The deer is only the harbinger of the ill will hiding within the trees.  
After seeing the deer the first night here I made my way into the woods to inspect the area more carefully, I was able to follow the signs of activity to a place deeper within and far from any trails. A place with signs of worship. I won't explain in detail what was there, but I can tell you that there was blood involved. There were signs of children, but disturbingly enough I can't tell if they were the cause or the source of the blood. I would normally say the latter based on instinct but I'm fairly certain I saw a figure watching me, and by the size my assumption is that it was a child itself.  
Judging by the reviews I read it's becoming bolder, and I worry what will happen if you or anyone else continue to stay here. I finished out my own stay in order to make you a charm in the form of a windchime. Regardless of if you heed my warning, please, hang that above the stairs for the porch. It should help protect whoever is inside at the very least.  
Please.

I turned the page but there was only two overall superficial reviews before the summer ended, one from a group of college kids who took the deer thing as some sort of ARG or something and the other an older couple who had been rented the lake house as an anniversary present from their kid. The later honestly was really sweet, with them talking about how glad they were that there was a ledger there so they could leave a review themselves. I closed the ledger and put it in a box I'd set up for myself before curiously peaking out at the front porch. It was another wrap around porch, something I was coming to like more and more in a house in terms of aesthetics, and attached to a beam above the stairs was in fact a windchime I had only barely registered on my way in. At the very least I had registered it was there, but beyond that didn't give it any mind.

Now that I was giving them my full attention, they were definitely not what I'd consider conventional.

The strings that the whole thing consisted of were separated by a large disk-like piece that, after quick inspection, looked to be obsidian or some other black stone with drilled holes in it for the strings. The strings themselves either held iron cylinders that made a high pretty ding when they struck each other or spread out around it into strands interwoven with white and purple stones. I recognized the purple as amethyst but the other was lost on me. At the end of each of these was something that looked like a blue-eyed eyeball with a purple border around it, and a particularly big one with more gems than the rest dangled from the middle by the longest string. I found out much later that these things were called "evil eyes", and the way they seemed to stare at me certainly felt malicious at the time. After looking around for a bit, sorting items as I went into the "keep", "call", and "donate" boxes I had ready, I eventually found a little two step footstool that I could use to take the thing down. Up close, as I was unhooking it carefully and wondering which box it belonged in, I realized that on the underside of the disk in an x pattern, seemingly helping to separate the strings, were two polished looking bones that I couldn't Identify and had been tied into the windchime with its own distinct blue string. I nearly dropped the thing in surprise but managed to catch the hook before any damage was done, the gems knocking against the iron in a flurry of noise that almost seemed to be scolding me.

I muttered an apology at it without thinking and set it on one of the tables until I could figure out what to do with the thing.

As I continued sorting, I made note that since they were selling the house that this was either going to be a long day or a two day job as the sun dipped lower and lower into the sky and the sky itself went from blue to orange. I didn't like the idea of coming back and I had the trailer I needed to bring the big items back with me so I turned the lights on in each room to keep me moving. It was a hell of a drive and I didn't want to make it if I didn't have to. A drive home at midnight with the job put behind me was a lot more appealing.

However, as the night finally fell and I was making another run through before figuring out how to get everything the truck, I heard a noise from the front porch. Curious, I went to the closest window to scope it out and my blood ran cold.

It was the deer.

I could see it pawing at the steps in the low light, almost testing its footing, and as it got onto the steps fully I saw those sharp and angled horns, an unnatural black that managed to still stand out against the dark landscape behind the thing. The pentagram on its flank looked more gnarled and raw than in any of the depictions, as if the scar had been continuously carved fresh, and recently. I could barely hear the fur around its hooves brushing against the wooden stairs like a broom as it got to the top on the stairs and looked up.

Right where the windchime had been.

Oh fuck, the windchime.

My eyes darted to where it sat on one of the tables, surrounded by all the other furniture I had either dragged in whole or taken apart to do so, but were drawn back at the firm steady knocking of hooves stepping across the porch towards the door. I could see its eyes now, dark with a distinct sideways pupil but fixed on the door for the moment. When relief washed over me I realized I'd been holding my breath, afraid of making contact with the beast.

Then it pawed at the door like a dog asking to be let in.

Shit.

I told myself it was fine, that the door was in good shape and I didn't plan on letting it in. It was just a deer. A weird fucking deer, but a deer nonetheless. Until it seemed to register I was there and looked right at me.

I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. I was trapped in that monster's gaze as it slowly reacted to my presence. Without breaking my gaze it slowly started to back up, much like I had seen other deer do when stumbling across a person, but before I could even consider being relieved by this it jerked its head to point its antlers at the door and lunged at it, slamming itself into the door antlers first. The sound made me jump and as I tried to assess the damage I heard a sound like someone popping bubble wrap and was drawn back to the deer.

The sound was its bones.

It was making unnatural jerking motions as it seemed to adjust its body to reinforce its neck and allow it to keep its head sideways, attacking the door with its antlers like a battering ram while still keeping its horrible gaze on me. I was able to stumble back and started making my way as far from the door as possible, pulling any furniture I could in front of me as I went, but before I could think of anything else the door was broken apart into cruel looking splinters that left a hole almost big enough for its whole torso. Its bones cracked again as it forced its head to a more "natural" angle and used its front hoof to almost nonchalantly break away any of the remaining door that it would have had to otherwise step over to come in. Once it was fully inside, the cracking started up again and I watched in abject horror as the thing reared back on its hind legs as its body jerked and forced itself into its desired shape. Bipedal. The whole time it never broke eye contact with me and seemed to relish the fear in my eyes. As I watched it walk towards me I started to shake, seeing it awkwardly use its front legs to shove and kick (punch?) furniture out of its way, and when it noticed it grinned at me. Fucking *grinned*. And it had teeth sharper than any wolf or bear I've ever seen.

As I helplessly tried to push myself against the wall to get further away, my hand scrambling for something, *anything* that I could defend myself with, it made contact with the table the windchime was on and inadvertently knocked it off and about a foot from where I stood.

It stopped.

Its eyes were finally off me and on the windchime, the grin on its face morphing into something like a snarl, and I took the opportunity to snatch it up and grip it like a shield in front of me, one hand grabbing onto an iron cylinder. As I stepped forward the thing stepped back, still focused on the windchime, and I wrenched the cylinder free to brandish it like a sword alongside the windchime. As it stepped back, I lunged forward myself with the adrenaline rush that only comes with feeling close to death and struck it somewhere near the ribs.

The sound it made I'd only heard once before, when I witnessed a hawk take off with a rabbit in its talons. It made the same horrible chilling scream as the talons dug into it.

The deer fell onto its back and scrambled, its bones snapping and popping as it tried to again adjust its body to get away, and I struck it again in the leg as it flailed dangerously close to me. It screamed again and the leg stopped making noise, seemingly stopping mid-transition as the rest of the creature resumed a form resembling a normal buck. It ran off frantically and the leg further contorted until the bone penetrated its skin as it forced itself to run as it normally would on that twisted limb. It was still screaming as I lost sight of it.

I dropped the cylinder and the windchime as I fell to my knees and threw up until tears were streaming down my face, dry heaving with nothing left to give. As I struggled to catch my breath I saw spots enter my visit and passed out right there.

When I came to it was barely dawn and only the hole and the vomit caked on my cheek proved that anything had even happened.

I shakily got to my feet, using my shirt to clean my cheek, and managed to get to my bag for my cleaning supplies. Robotically I cleaned the mess I'd made and, after considering the door, swept up the broken pieces and threw them off the porch towards the woods. Once I felt sure of my footing I immediately started dragging everything to the truck and its trailer, going one by one and feeling as if I was almost on auto pilot as I loaded up. After the last item I stood in front of the door awkwardly with the key, eyeing the fact that it was busted almost to my waist, slowly locked up despite this before staring at the woods. Blood barely stood out after the morning dew and my own work washed the portion near the door away, but it was there. And I knew that the deer was there too, watching me. Fuming about what I'd done.

I drove home and never looked back.

The family sold the house and I actually heard it was torn down. Rumors went around for a while why that was but I knew better. I'd heard about the kid that went missing a few months later, when the summer traffic started up again. The windchime is hung up on a decorative hanger I bought specifically to put it by the door, and its the only item I don't have specifically in the museum, for good reason. The ledger is though, and the windchime is still labelled "Kim" on the black disk.

Looking back, I think this was the closest I've come so far to being hurt on the job, unless you count some injuries related to lifting more than I could handle or just plain clumsiness. I still have nightmares every once in a while about that face grinning down at me when other things don't take its place. Don't worry though. More often than not I don't remember dreaming at all, and I have an occasional pleasant dream thrown in once in a blue moon.

I just have to make sure to keep the windchime in good shame and my dream catchers in order.
