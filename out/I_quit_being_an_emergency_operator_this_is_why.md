Daisy: 999, what’s your emergency?

Caller: (*male, distressed*) I… I don’t want to do this anymore.

Daisy: Sir, can you tell me where you are?

Caller: Gatwick. Near the tracks.

Daisy: Are you safe right now?

Caller: No. I was going to jump. But… I didn’t. I called you instead.

Daisy: (gently) That’s a good choice. My name’s Daisy. Can you tell me yours?

Caller: (pauses) Luke.

Daisy: Hi, Luke. I’m here to help you. Can you move away from the tracks for me?

Luke: What’s the point? No one cares.

Daisy: I care. You called me, didn’t you? That means you want to talk. Tell me what’s going on.

Luke: (voice breaking) I lost everything. My wife, my home… my daughter. She doesn’t even talk to me anymore. I’m living out of my car. I’m nothing.

Daisy: You’re not nothing, Luke. You’re still here. That means something. Let’s take this one step at a time, okay? Just move away from the tracks. I’ll stay with you.

Luke: (after a long silence) Okay. I’m moving.

Daisy: Good. You’re doing great, Luke. I’m going to send someone to come help you. Just stay with me until they arrive.

Luke: Thank you, Daisy.

Daisy: 999, what’s your emergency?

Luke: (laughs) You’ve got to stop answering the phone like that, D.

Daisy: (chuckling) Luke, this is an emergency line. You can’t keep calling just to chat.

Luke: What are they going to do, arrest me? Jail’s got to be better than my car.

Daisy: Don’t tempt me to report you.

Luke: You won’t. You’re too nice.

Daisy: (sighs) How’s your week been?

Luke: Same as always. Coffee at McDonald’s, a lot of staring at the dashboard. What about you?

Daisy: Busy. A kid in my class tried to flush a textbook down the toilet today.

Luke: (laughing) Reminds me of my daughter when she was little. She tried to set the house on fire once.

Daisy: You’ve told me that before. You always talk about her.

Luke: (quietly) She’s all I’ve got, really. Even if she doesn’t know it.

Daisy: Maybe you should reach out to her.

Luke: (bitterly) She wouldn’t want to hear from me.

Daisy: You don’t know that.

Luke: (changing the subject) Same time next week?

Daisy: If you promise not to call it an emergency.

Luke: Deal.

Daisy: 999, what’s your emergency?

Luke: You’re relentless, you know that?

Daisy: You’re still calling the emergency line, Luke.

Luke: And you’re still answering. How was your day?

Daisy: Busy. I had three real emergencies today, one involving a very angry cat. You?

Luke: Same old. I think my car heater’s finally given up. Gonna be a cold one tonight.

Daisy: Luke… your birthday’s coming up, isn’t it?

Luke: Oh, don’t remind me. It’s just another day.

Daisy: You should celebrate. Treat yourself to something nice.

Luke: I’ll grab an extra hash brown at McDonald’s. That’ll be my treat.

Daisy: (hesitating) Maybe you won’t be alone this year.

Luke: (curious) What do you mean?

Daisy: Nothing. Just… keep your evening free.

Luke: Daisy… what are you up to?

Daisy: You’ll see.

Daisy: 999, what’s your emergency?

Luke: (panicked) Daisy! She’s here—Emma’s here.

Daisy: Luke? What’s going on?

Luke: She’s yelling at me. She’s so angry. Daisy, she’s got a knife.

Daisy: Stay calm. I’m sending police and paramedics to your location. Are you at McDonald’s?

Luke: Yes.

Emma: (screaming in the background) You ruined everything!

Daisy: Emma? This is Daisy from emergency services. Please put the knife down.

Emma: (yelling) Shut up! This is between me and him!

Luke: (sobbing) Daisy, I’m so sorry.

Daisy: Luke, don’t apologize. Just focus on staying calm.

Emma: (crying) You don’t get to play the victim! You left me and Mom!

Luke: I didn’t mean to… I was scared.

Daisy: Emma, listen to me. Your dad loves you. He talks about you all the time. This isn’t the way to fix things.

Emma: (screams) No! He doesn’t get to say that!

(Sound of a struggle, followed by a loud crash.)

Luke: (gasping) Daisy… she… she stabbed me.

Daisy: Oh my God. Luke, stay with me. Where are you hurt?

Luke: Chest… there’s so much blood.

Daisy: Keep pressure on the wound. Help is almost there. Emma, stop this now!

Emma: (choking on sobs) I didn’t mean to… I didn’t mean to…

Daisy: Emma, put the knife down. You can still make this right.

Emma: (quietly) No… I can’t.

Daisy: Emma, no—!

Luke: (weakly) Daisy… thank you… for trying.

Daisy: Luke, stay awake. Please, stay awake.

(Line goes dead.)
