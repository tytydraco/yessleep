I work what should be a rather mundane job as a night guard for my local cemetery. In theory it should be a boring although creepy job, that it isn’t for the faint of heart.

At this cemetery there are only two rules that I’m required to follow. 
1) The gates are locked at 9pm until 6am every night. 
2) Never talk to anyone or let them out once the gates have been closed. 

If I see anyone inside of the cemetery over the course of the night I am to say nothing and stick to my nightly tasks. Every hour I am to make sure that either the North Gate or South Gate is locked while the other night guard checks the other with us rotating the gate every hour.

While many would think that the purpose of a guard in a cemetery would be to tell people off for trespassing during the night, those inside might find that I am the one trespassing. Usually a few of these people will try and start up a conversation asking me any number of questions while I waste time between gate checks. I have heard many life stories and ambitious goals during my time working here. On the unfortunate night, one or two of those voices will scream at me to just unlock the gate because they aren’t supposed to be in there. On really bad nights the angriest spirits will turn into demonic form to try and intimidate me into compliance. The best thing to do is simply ignore it.

With how crucial we are told for both gates to be kept locked there are a few other guys that I work with. Isaac, Kyle, and Eli have all worked here longer than I have. Each one follows the two rules religiously and each has their own horrific experience that has made their vow of silence cemented when the gates are locked.

The first couple of years working here had always made me question what would happen if I did talk to one of the strangers I saw within. Discovering what happens left a terror in me that has kept my mouth sealed as soon as the gates are locked.

It had been the same thing as every night before, I got to work at 8 and sat down for the present meeting. After trading a few words with Isaac we set off to lock up and began idling walking around the grounds until the next gate check. Just after midnight a kid, probably no older than 16 ran up to me and began screaming.

“Please, please, you have to let me out of here! I snuck in here and I need to get out! The v-vo-ices, tHe VoiCEss, tHEy wo-Won’T s-sS-s-st-tt-o-sT-sTo-OOppP! PL-Ple-PLEAsE! HElp ME!”

I simply shook my head and backed away. He was lost to whatever spirits owned the night. A few hours later I was stuck hosing off his remains from the pavilion near the North Gate. 

I had heard when I was in High School that plenty of kids would do the Midnight Run at the cemetery to prove how brave they were. By climbing a tree by the southeast of the cemetery you could jump from one of the branches inside. Dumb kids would get inside at midnight and run to the North Gate where a friend would be waiting to help them hop back over. I was never brave enough to try and now I was glad I wasn’t so foolish.

Talking to whatever was lurking inside clearly did not care for the unwelcome disturbance. From what I’ve been told by Kyle, Saturdays have the most ‘Clean Up’ days. The whole town knows that there is something off about this place, yet it doesn’t keep the brave and dumb from gambling their lives by jumping into hell.

I’ve had the misfortune of witnessing the cruelty up front. A few years ago a new guy was going to join our ranks to help lighten our schedules. He was given the rundown of the rules and seemed like he would be able to follow them.

On his third day of shadowing me he made the simplest mistake. One of the spirits sneezed, and he said ‘Bless You’. Just like anyone else would have done he was thanked. The twisted and gnarled smile that hungrily thanked him had no kindness for him. The sound of his jaw being wrenched open by charred fleshy hands. Seeing the antlers and jagged skull force themselves into the gaping maw for shelter. Smelling the shit and bile and piss fill the air as someone has a beast twice their size try and enter them like an egg being swallowed by a rat snake. It was the first and last time I tried to train anyone.

Fourteen years, fourteen years of locking myself into hell for nine hours. Sometimes I think about quitting but the pay is ridiculous. For $1000 a night I have to lock the gate and check it every hour. Voices beckon me, call for me, plead to me, beg for me to respond. Unlocking the gate every morning is always a relief because I made it through. I know I can’t do it forever but the thought of having to train a replacement and seeing them suffer a visceral fate terrifies me.

Every night I work, I lock the gate and then walk the grounds. I check the lock every hour and go back to walking the ground. Many of the malevolent forces have grown accustomed to my presence and will tell me their tales occupy my time knowing that I won’t ever respond. They still will ask for me to let them out from time to time but I hope they realize that the gates are only unlocked at 6am. On occasion some of those spirits will try to make me slip up but still I stay silent. Their repeated failures anger them but no matter what form they take to convince me their ire brings no recourse. 

They cannot touch what does not answer their call. I know that as long as I don’t beckon their embrace I won’t have to feel their otherworldly hands take hold of me. From everything I have witnessed, it is a call I will gladly refuse.

A new night guard is starting, trained as a replacement for Eli whose decades working here has left him a wealthy and tired man. He has told me that the new guy, Thomas, is up for the task and knows to stay silent.

I still worry.

In all the years working here

I still don’t know what happens

If the gates are ever left unlocked

Or what happens if there isn’t a guard to make sure the seal is secured keeping the forces of the night barred from entering the rest of the world.
