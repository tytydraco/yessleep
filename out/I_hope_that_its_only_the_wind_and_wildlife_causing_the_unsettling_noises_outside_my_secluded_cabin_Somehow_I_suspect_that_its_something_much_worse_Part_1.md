It was Max who reacted to the noises more than I did, at first. He was part beagle, part velociraptor (in his mind, anyway), but he was a full-on bloodhound when a scent or sound caught his attention.

I had only lived at the cabin for a few weeks, hoping for some isolation to finish writing the novel I'd been working on for the better part of five years. Okay, ‘working on’ is a bit of an exaggerated way of saying I'd been mentally plotting it out for a good half a decade, but that's beside the point.

Having lived in a fairly bustling apartment building since moving out of my parent’s house, it wasn't always easy to stay focused, with noisy neighbors and traffic driving by. That's the very reason I decided to move out to this spot, a good way from the beaten path.

Other than some camping trips when I was a kid, I didn't have much experience being surrounded by nature. For the most part, I managed to ignore the sounds of the wind blowing through the branches, or the wildlife scurrying around. Max; however, had not been a fan since we moved in.

Most days, he would just grunt or growl as leaves brushed up against the exterior walls and windows, but he grew so much more erratic when the more deliberate-sounding noises began. I don't know if that's the best way to phrase that, but they seemed far less random than the soundtrack of the forest.

I began to take things a bit more seriously when I was awakened in the middle of the night by my bedroom window cracking from something slamming against it. I practically jumped from my bed, scampering to the window to see what was out there.

Max was going completely nuts, barking his furry ass off, with the hair on his back standing upright. He wasn't exactly an intimidating mutt, but the way he growled at the window made me even more unsettled by it.

With the moonlight barely cutting through the dense forest, I couldn't make out much of anything. But the spiderwebbed splits across my window had me a little more than rattled, even with that little voice in my head arguing that it was nothing more than a tree branch, or something tossed by the wind.

Throwing on my robe and muttering curses under my breath, I pulled my flashlight and pistol from my nightstand. I leashed Max to ensure he didn't run off, though he was more of a ‘bark as intimidatingly as possible while hiding behind me’ sort of dog.

I flipped on the exterior light, hesitantly creaking open the front door, while my faithful companion tucked himself behind my legs, poking his snout between them. Stepping outside, I just stood in the doorway, glancing around the area, and guiding my torch from side to side.

Sure enough, the wind was quite aggressive, threatening to blow me right back through the entrance, given my shaky and still half-asleep legs. With an exhausted chuckle and a wide yawn, I just headed back inside, shaking my head at my silliness.

Max settled down a bit, after taking a look outside, but he still seemed a little on edge. Given that he had been aggressively pulled from his sleep, just like I was, I could only imagine what goes through a dog's mind at such things. I gave him a few treats, leading him back to the bedroom, hopeful that we could both get back to sleep.

Before I lay back down, I placed some packaging tape along the cracks in my bedroom window, in hopes of preventing them from getting any worse. I knew I'd have to get it fixed soon enough, but I hoped this would work until I had the motivation to either fix it myself or call the landlord.

For the remainder of the night, every tap against the exterior walls, as debris caught the wind, sprang my eyelids back open, while Max growled from the floor. I even thought I heard some things rolling around inside the cabin, but I just chalked that up to my sleepy imagination running wild, combined with my growing frustration.

The next day, I placed a few calls, arranging to have my split glass replaced, as well as getting some of the trees, right next to the house, removed. Dale, my landlord, didn't sound exactly thrilled about it, but with me being the third tenant in a little over a year, he couldn't deny that something had to be done.

It was at that point when I should have had the sense to ask more questions about those who had moved in and back out so swiftly, but the restless night hadn't left me much sense by morning. I was fighting sleep all day, even while the guys Dale had sent out, went to work on the window.

It would still be a few days before the tree removal team came to check things out, but I went ahead and cut down some of the branches right next to the house. The last thing I wanted was to have to arrange to get the damn window replaced again, if that night was as windy as the last.

When the noises attempted to interrupt my sleep once more, I ended up choosing to crash on the couch. Yes, I could still hear them from the living room–the scratching at the door and walls, just as much as the tapping on the fresh pane of glass. But with how beat I was by that point, I didn't have nearly as much trouble drifting away, even with Max still occasionally grumbling at the front door.

Some days later, as my landlord promised, the tree removal crew arrived. The nights leading up to this had left me both frustrated and exhausted, with the regular scuffling and scraping, but I was hopeful this would do the trick. As it turned out, this was just an evaluation and not the actual removal, but I knew nothing about how these things work.

It would be another two weeks until they returned to get the job done, but suffice it to say, the lack of fulfilling rest had left me quite on edge. It had escalated to the point in which I was certain there was as much movement inside the house as beyond its walls, with how erratic my mental capacity had grown.

Each night I found my eyelids springing back open, due to one slam here, or scuffling there, accompanied by growling and barking, I would flip on every light in the cabin, checking every closet and cabinet. I walked around the exterior, my flashlight in one hand, and my gun in the other, still finding not the slightest trace of what could be causing the constant ruckus.

The restlessness had left my paranoia at an all-time high, to the point I was ready to check into a hotel room for a few nights, just to get my mind right. I loved the cabin and its isolation from the otherwise busy world, but I was certain I'd completely lose my shit if this kept up much longer.

Still, I wasn't sure if any hotel would allow Max to stay–I don't have much experience with those things either, and I wasn't about to leave him alone at the cabin for an extended period. Ultimately, I chose to stick it out and hope for the best.

I was beyond relieved when the crew arrived to finally get rid of the trees alongside the walls of the cabin. The process didn't take nearly as long as I was expecting, but Max was going apeshit the entire time.

After a long day of growling and barking at the door and walls, the little guy passed out before I did. Before I crashed for the night, my body weary and my mind cluttered from the weeks of broken sleep, I just stood in the middle of the living room for a time, breathing in the blissful silence.

Everything was so wonderfully quiet when I finally flopped onto my bed, my senses fading into the black within seconds. For those first few hours, I experienced the best sleep I had in possibly my entire adult life. That was, of course, until my dog going completely nuts again, pulled me swiftly back to the world around me.

It wasn't rustling or scraping that I heard, aside from the howling Max, but what sounded like the moaning of a wounded animal. It was a sound that almost inspired my guts to churn–a gargled, vibrating wail of agony.

Again, I peered through my bedroom window, unable to make out anything through the darkness. What I could hear; though, while I attempted to silence my dog to the best of my ability, was what sounded like something being dragged across the ground, possibly only feet beyond the window.

Once more, I repeated the process that had almost become a nightly ritual by this point: flipping on the exterior lights, with my gun, flashlight, and leashed Max. Not only was there only a gentle breeze outside, barely causing the dead leaves, scattered across the ground to stir, but it was almost eerily silent.

Whether it had been a wounded animal, or something else entirely, it would seem that the lights beaming from the cabin inspired it to either run off or hide quietly. Whatever the case, my still growling dog, and my nerves being shot from exhaustion, I was honestly feeling quite uneasy at the time.

I closed and locked the door, leaving the porch light burning brightly. Feeling a little more than creeped out–the little voice in the back of my mind begging me not to investigate the area this time, I chose to leave it at that for now.

The next day, after managing to toss and turn my way back to sleep, for a few more hours, at least, I took a look around outside, under the hopeful safety of the sunlight. I saw no sign of anything having been wounded or dragged across the scattered leaves.

There was no indication of anything out of the ordinary–nothing that raised any red flags to me, anyway. I didn't exactly spend much time on the small deck, or gazing into the woods, other than to enjoy the occasional blunt, to get the creative juices flowing. But nothing appeared out of the ordinary.

Regardless of finding no evidence to support my growing paranoia, and relentless restlessness (now, that's a mouthful), I needed some answers. Or at least proof that Max and I weren't collectively going insane.

After a quick drive into town to pick up supplies, as well as some lunch, I arrived back at the cabin with two trail cameras, a new tablet, a case of beer, and a bagload of fast food. Once mine and my faithful companion had filled our grumbling bellies, I got to work setting things up.

I mounted the cameras outside–one right in front of the house, between the front door, and my bedroom window, looking out, and the other close to the treeline, aimed back at the cabin.

I had considered investing in a few more cameras, placing them around each side of the building, as well as inside. But I had already forked out more cash than I needed to, in my efforts to set my mind at ease.

The sun was going down as I finished setting everything up, accompanied by droplets of rain trickling upon the leaves scattered across the forest floor. It was at that point, as the loud clap of thunder inspired the drizzle to transform into a veritable monsoon, that two things occurred to me.

The first was that I didn't even think to check if the cameras were water-resistant, and the tutorial videos I looked up didn't get into that aspect of them. But I hoped for the best, as they were designed for being out in the elements.

The second–something that inspired a grateful sigh, almost releasing the tension in my neck, was that the ambient sounds of the storm should provide the blissful lullaby I so desperately needed. Not only that, but perhaps the rain would at least temporarily halt any late-night shenanigans, beyond my bedroom window.

With the storm raging on, I felt more relaxed than I had in weeks. While I was mentally and physically exhausted, I couldn't resist taking advantage of the weather. I dug out my baggie of emergency, herbal, creative juices stimulants, rolled two joints, placed three, chilled beers in my travel cooler, and headed out to the covered rear deck.

Max wasn't the biggest fan of thunder, but I left the back door open, just in case he wanted to come out and join me. He had never been one to attempt to run off, but he would often hang out with me at times like these. Well, when it wasn't pouring outside, anyway.

Between my head growing blissfully light and foggy, and the glorious soundtrack of the storm, I'm not sure when I nodded off on that lounge chair. Nor what time it was when the aggravated barking of my dog pulled my senses back to the world around me.

My mind instantly collided with reality, while I almost busted my ass, as I leaped to my feet. At first, with the backdoor still being ajar, I worried that Max had indeed scampered away. But when I sprinted into the house on my still drowsy legs to see him growling and scratching at the front door, I was quite unnerved, to say the least.

I couldn't convince him to settle down, or back away from the entrance to the cabin, no matter what I tried. I screamed his name, petted the raised fur on his back, and even shook his bag of treats, but he wouldn't budge.

After a solid half hour, he finally began to calm down, but still occasionally grumbled, staring knives at the door. I went ahead and popped open another beer, after bringing the cooler inside, and locking up for the night, grabbing my tablet to see if the cameras might have picked up whatever had Max so spooked.

Given that the storm was still going strong–not quite as violently as it was when I passed out, but still showing no signs of dwindling, I couldn't make out much of anything from the camera by the tree line. The other one; however–the one looking out from the base of the cabin, appeared to have been completely snuffed out.

When I went back through the footage from before it went dark, I felt my already shaky legs attempting to give out from beneath me. Some twenty or thirty minutes before my dog awakened me from my sleep, it looked like some sort of slender, hunched-over figure was outside, steadily approaching the house.

All I could see was the darkened outline of the forest, in between the stabs of lightning, making it look like an eerie, old, stop-motion video–the shadowed figure having moved closer with every flash. With another blink of light, revealing the silhouette only feet from the camera, the next showed only the vacant forest.

One final stab of lighting presented me with the last image the camera captured: a pure white, almost translucent, and bloodshot eye, gazing directly into the lens. I swear, it felt like it was glaring right through my eyes, and into the squishy center of my brain for minutes, in that brief flash of light.

When the video went completely black, revealing neither the shadowed woods nor whatever peered into the lens, I dropped to the floor, allowing the tablet to slip from my fingers. Max came up beside me, resting his paws on my chest to lick my face, easily reading my shaken state.

My mind was reeling, my heart racing with every disturbing scenario that flooded my thoughts. Whatever it was that put an end to the footage, clearly had some sort of intelligence–enough to know it was being watched, anyway.

With the bizarre nature of the video blinking from dark to brief flashes of light, I couldn't tell exactly how it moved, once I finally got up the nerve to rewatch it. It looked to be somewhat human in its appearance, but its stature was far more primal and animalistic.

Perhaps this was not the best scenario for a more imaginative mind, thrusting thoughts of anything from cryptids to wayward aliens against the forefront of my brain, but I knew I had to get a handle on myself. One thing was certain, though: I would not be sleeping again, anytime soon–not in this cabin. Not until I get some [answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/WillRayne/s/7qfI6sDFKC)
