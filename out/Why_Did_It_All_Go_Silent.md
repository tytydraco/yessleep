Every day, I commute to work at 9 AM and return at around 8 PM.

I don’t like torturing myself, but our town’s soon-to-be-proficient factory is incredibly short-staffed, so putting in the work now will bring more work later. That’s what they tell us.

The truth is that I genuinely couldn’t hate anything more in my life. Despite its apparent use, all I have ever seen accomplished by our assembly is the production of one brand new Ford F-100. What I despise most about it is the time it takes away from my family.

Every day, I commute to work one hour, work for ten hours, and journey an extra hour to my house.

Today, the strangest thing happened. The break off from the highway to dirt roads was devoid of any life; not a single car, bug, deer, bird, or person. I enjoyed the silence.

I grew closer to the town, subconsciously confused about the lack of light, but not really paying much attention to such.

I stepped out of my car. Every house was completely radio silent; every house was completely devoid of light. Every house was completely devoid of life.

Typically I would smell the stench of Tobacco, or relish in the smell of a freshly baked pie edging you, begging for you to devour it. I yearned for the soft wooden smell of petrichor as it typically rained here often. Despite a dense, thick fog matting my nose, I couldn’t smell anything. No trace of life—no stench of death.

I tried targeting my ears towards the trees, focusing on any chirps. I listened for chatter in the distance. Or even just a car passing by.

But the only thing I heard was my breath.

My breathing staggered. I kept looking backwards for something to happen. I felt like something was watching me. I yelled at a bush that frayed from side to side with the wind.

I opened my door, listening as it creaked loudly and looked behind myself once more. But I wisened-up, ran in, and shut the door.

I yelled for Delaney, but there was no response. It was pitch black inside, and the only light illuminating the house was moonlight from curtained windows. Muffled whines and panicked winces slipped from my mouth.

I looked up, almost feeling a presence watching me, but there was nothing there, and if there was, it did nothing. Each floorboard shattered the silence as I inched up the stairs. My breath quickened, and I began hyperventilating, but I was met with the smell of water: a plain nothingness.

I began running up the steps, and blasted past the kids’ rooms in fear of what I would find.

I got to my room, the lights still not working at all, and I yelled for Delaney again, but nobody responded.

I prayed for a monster to give me a quick and easy death because it would beat the sheer dread I felt that very moment. I screamed for Delaney, trying to elicit any response, but nothing responded.

Goosebumps travelled all over my skin, teasing me. I gripped my head, tore some of my hair out and fell to the floor screaming for anyone to hear me. I looked around frantically for anything, sure that outside the windows, under my bed, and hiding in the darkness were creatures stalking me.

None of my calls are going through, and my phone won’t send any messages. Now I sit on my bed clutching my shotgun. I type this out, not sure if it’s gonna send through, but it’s the only thing stopping me from shooting myself in the head.

Every giant gasp for air I take is flavorless, and everywhere I look it’s just pure darkness. Goosebumps envelop my skin; and like before, the only thing I can hear is the sound of my own breathing.
