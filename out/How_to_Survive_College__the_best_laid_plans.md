Grayson kept his promise and came over to talk with me.  He arrived after classes for both of us were done for the day.  It also meant that Cassie was home and this time, she didn’t vanish into her bedroom to give us privacy.  She waited until we were both seated in the living room and Titanosaur was settled in Grayson’s lap, thereby preventing him from escaping.

Please don’t read too much into that, as I’ve said before Titanosaur has like three brain cells and will sit in literally anyone’s lap.  Our landlady sent her husband over to fix the leaking faucet in the bathroom and Titan was trying to climb in his lap while the poor guy was sitting there with half his body inside of a cabinet.

Then Cassie came over, carrying a chair from the kitchen, and also seated herself with us.  I glanced at Grayson.  He looked dismayed, but was hiding it well in an effort to be polite.  I decided to lean into my non-confrontational side and not ask her to leave.

“You’ve been acting a bit out of character lately,” I began delicately.  “As a friend, I’m worried about you.”

“And I’m worried too,” Cassie added.  “Maybe you don’t think of me as a friend, but you’ve been hanging out around Ashley enough that I consider you one of mine.”

Huh.  I wasn’t expecting that, to be honest.  I thought Cassie didn’t like him.  I don’t think she was lying, either.

“Have you considered getting grief counseling?” she continued.

Straight to the point.  I was glad Cassie was there.  My plan was to tiptoe delicately around the subject for what probably would have been another 500 words worth of dialogue here in this post I’m writing up.  Fortunately, Cassie’s willingness to address a problem directly saved me the typing and you the tedium.

“Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t,” Grayson said.  “The university doesn’t know he’s gone yet.”

“Who is running this place?” Cassie asked in amazement.

I know.  We’ve all been thinking it.  Turns out the answer is ‘there’s a board’ and they make all the real decisions.  The president is just a figurehead.  Which is pretty obvious if you stop and think about it.  I wanted to ask if the flickering man reported to the board but I also didn’t want to derail the conversation with things that really didn’t matter anymore.  It’s safer to just assume the board is the administration I’ve been wondering about this whole time.  Heck, it’s safer to assume everyone except for the students and professors are responsible in some part for the whole monster situation.

Sorry for not finding out for certain, but Grayson was working through some important stuff and I didn’t dare interrupt.

“I don’t want counseling, either,” he continued.  “Please don’t take this the wrong way, but I never cared for him.  Not in a familial sense.  My presence was more to fill a role.”

Things were starting to connect in my head.  This conversation reminded me of some things the flickering man had said.  Roles to be filled.  A cycle, ushering in new students to fill them.  They’d been filling the president’s role with a corpse - a very old one, judging by the date on the photo Cassie took of the headstone - so perhaps that wasn’t the only role being filled.

“Were you adopted?” I asked.  “By the president?”

“I was.”

Beside me, Cassie took a deep breath.  It wasn’t from shock.  It sounded more like… annoyance.  If I’m being generous with the term.

“The flickering man said something to me,” I said slowly.  “That I wasn’t the first person he’d seen like this and I wouldn’t be the last.  Are you… not the only child that the president has adopted?”

“...I’m not.”

This is the point where Cassie just lost it.  Stood up, yelled ‘why the fuck didn’t you tell us any of this?!’ and stormed out of the room.  She slammed the door to her bedroom shut behind her.  Grayson and I sat there in the living room for a good minute, stunned, listening to what I’m 99% certain was Cassie screaming into her pillow.  Then the door opened and she returned to calmly sit down on the sofa again.

“I’m good,” she said.  “All better.  Please continue.”

The details of the conversation get a little fuzzy at this point, as it seems that even though the forgetter is gone I’m still having memory issues.  Unfortunately Grayson was right - it wasn’t the forgetter that was responsible for my particular variety of memory loss.  There’s something else trying to protect Grayson.

I suspect the tree in the graveyard.  Its roots have spread all over campus, after all.

Sorry to be so blase about this but it’s not actually that upsetting anymore.  It’s just this thing we’re dealing with.

It’s a good thing Cassie was present for the rest of the conversation.  She filled me in on the details later, after we’d confirmed that I had some significant gaps.  Grayson explained a bit more about the whole adoption thing.  He didn’t know who his birth parents were.  He’d never been outside of this town and basically grew up on campus.  This is all kind of recapping what we already knew or guessed at, but the adoption angle was new at least.  I’d assumed that his dad had died and been replaced, which he had, except it wasn’t his dad at all and Grayson’s role as the son was being replaced over and over also.

Which is all kinds of fucked up.

It also means that this has been going on for generations and I think we all know why that’s rather alarming.

“What happened to the previous adopted kids?” I asked once we’d gotten through this rather confusing summary.

“They died.”

There was a heavy silence in the room.  

“How?” I asked.

“Well… one drowned.  Another suffocated.”  He hesitated.  “This is kind of why I’m reluctant to tell people I’m the president’s son.”

“Grayson, are you worried someone will try to kill you?” Cassie asked flatly.

“...yeah.  I am, actually.”

Screaming into a pillow myself was starting to look pretty tempting.

Now I’m sure you’re all thinking what I was thinking at this point.  If the university was just recycling the president’s corpse and finding new children to play the role of their child for… reasons??? then perhaps that was why the flickering man was interested in me.  Perhaps I was Grayson’s replacement, as many of you have theorized.

I mean, it seems pretty suspicious.  Grayson’s dad is getting his soul replaced on the regular - or at least, he was.  Grayson himself is a replacement for prior Graysons but I guess since they don’t need an adult, they’re just grabbing any ol’ kid to fill the role for a while.  But the former Graysons keep dying because the inhumans get him?  Grayson has a lot of protection on campus but he’s not immune - I’ve watched him get attacked by the steam ghost in particular.

Which leads me to my own theory.  If I am a replacement, I don’t fit the mold.  Perhaps that’s why the flickering man hated me so much.  I’m too old (legal adult yay) and… I’m not a son.

But I wanted to confirm some things.

We wrapped up the conversation with Grayson because we were running out of mental capacity to ask more questions.  He was clearly uncomfortable and there was a lot to process.  He did promise to not be so difficult about this in the future.  He wasn’t really grieving.  He was just… uncertain.  He didn’t know what to do anymore.  Which is fair.  When you’re raised to fill a role and suddenly that role is gone it’s hard to adjust.

I know what that feels like.

After Grayson left I messaged Maria asking if she knew anyone that was good with a camera.  Like, really good.  And also good in high stress situations.  She got back to me pretty quickly.  Maria is starting to become one of those people who knows everyone.  She’s heading firmly down the road of becoming the subject of one of those unhinged tumblr posts where someone magically summons an army of people to fulfill a task, while she stays on the sidelines quietly directing the ever-increasing chaos.

Fortunately, she’s not there quite yet, but she is freakishly well-connected for a campus of this size.  Within an hour she had me in a group chat with someone from the Folklore Society who fit all my requirements, even the unspoken ones.  Someone that was good with a camera in “hostile circumstances” (her words, very accurate) and wouldn’t cut and run the moment things got a little weird.  I think you all see where I was going with this.

Yeah, we were going to get photos of something inhuman.

DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.

For starters, it’s not safe just getting close to an inhuman to photograph it.  And once you do, that opens a whole new set of hazards.  If the inhuman takes offense to being photographed, then they’re going to do anything they have to to get the photo destroyed and all rules are off the table when it comes to disguising their existence.  Think of it like this - an inhuman might not be able to enter a house due to hospitality rules keeping them out, but this is weighed against their need to keep their presence obscured.  The latter wins.  Hospitality rules are no longer enough protection.

That’s my understanding, at least.

And sure, there are inhumans that don’t seem to care if a photo or two are leaked to the internet, but you have no way of knowing in advance.  Let’s say you get lucky and nothing comes after you to destroy the phone/camera, computer, your social media accounts, and you.  You’re not quite off the hook.  That photo is a connection to the inhuman and if the creature captured in it doesn’t use it as an access point, something else might.  

Photos are just a bad idea all around.

So we agreed that if we were going to go ahead with this stupid plan, we’d do so with as many safety measures as we could.  First, the person taking the photo would be fully informed on the potential consequences.  I was hoping that they could just teach Maria or I how to use a camera, but considering they were in the inner circle Folklore Society (what I’m calling the folks that know the monsters aren’t just stories) they wanted to come in person.  I tried to talk them out of it, they finally made a snarky comment about if I wanted them to sign a waiver, and I dropped the topic.

Secondly, we were going to destroy both the photo and the camera afterwards.  I got online and ordered the cheapest digital camera I could find.  It was a camera designed for young children so it was pastel pink with teddy bears on it, but whatever, it was digital and didn’t cost over $30.  The money from my job at the dining hall has helped with the finances but I didn’t particularly feel like lighting it on fire.

Especially since we planned to literally light the camera on fire when we were done.  I wasn’t looking forward to the smell of burning plastic but fire is both a thorough and symbolically traditional way to dispose of things.  Like I said, we were trying to do this as safely as we could.

The camera arrived the next day so we decided to go ahead with our plan that evening.  Cassie would stay home because we felt having too many people might be a hindrance if we had to bail out.  Also, she had “digital date night” with her girlfriend and I didn’t want to interfere.

Then we found a discreet entrance to the steam tunnels.

I wanted a photograph of the steam ghost.  It had a face.  I wanted to see what that face looked like.

I’d scouted out the steam tunnel entrances beforehand, while waiting for the burner (lol) camera to arrive.  Last time I’d looked inside, they were clogged with roots.  However, if the roots were originating from the graveyard, then perhaps the parts of campus that were farthest away would be clear enough to traverse.  I got lucky and found an entrance inside of one of the dorms that’s out by the parking lot.  The lobby is open and from there it’s easy enough to just coast into the stairwell behind someone with a keycard and then down into the basement.  There were roots, but they hung from the ceiling as slender tendrils that brushed the top of my head like the faint touch of a moth.  I didn’t go far inside.  Just enough to confirm it didn’t get any worse and we had a long corridor free of obstruction.

When I came back, I had Maria and the photographer with me.

His name is Jacob and he’s a sophomore.  He joined the Folklore Society because he realized he wasn’t making any attempts to be social, at college of all places, and picked a club that seemed like it would be small so he didn’t have to deal with crowds.  Large groups of people intimidated him.  I can certainly relate to that.

I feel bad for him.  Imagine getting caught up in all this bullshit just because you had trouble making friends.

It also occurred to me that this photography excursion was also part of his attempt to make friends, because that’s what landed him in the group that had to hide from the thing in the hallway.  Whatever.  Maria can deal with that.  She’s the extrovert.

“Let’s not forget the plan,” I said nervously as we gathered outside the door.  “We get in.  We get the photo.  We run like hell back out the door.”

I’m happy to say that the plan worked.  Every step.  Swear to god.

We were about halfway to where the tunnel turned when the steam started to rise out of the ground around us.  It seeped through the walls, filling our lungs and making it hard to breathe.  The usual.  We turned back at that point, as we wanted to be close to the exit so we could snap the photo and run once the steam ghost showed up.  

The nice thing about inhumans is that they can be predictable.  They have set rules they follow and so long as you follow the prescribed pattern of behavior, you know what to expect.  This allows you to plan, as I’d done.  So when we loitered within sprinting distance of the door, the steam ghost obliged to show up and chase us off.

Just as expected.  And Jacob was ready with our pastel pink camera, so that when its face materialized out of the steam, mouth open in a silent scream and its misty hands stretched towards us, he was able to snap a photo.

Then we ran and reached the door before it caught up.

See?  Exactly as planned.

There’s one more rule we learned about though.  One that I’d forgotten to factor in for this crucial moment.

The doors in the steam tunnels don’t always open to the same place.

We tumbled through without thinking.  I, pulling up the rear, had a moment of hesitation when I saw nothing but darkness ahead of me, but it was too late, I was in a full sprint and besides, Maria had already stumbled through the doorway.  I slammed into Jacob’s back, propelling him the few steps he needed to be past the doorway, and then we were all through and the door slammed shut behind us.

The air was warm and damp.  The steam tunnels, while warm, aren’t damp unless the steam ghost is present.  This felt like being inside of a sauna.  I could feel water beads forming on my arms, clinging to the hairs that were currently standing on end in alarm.  There was a faint breeze coming from ahead of us, a slowly rhythmic flow to it like a fan.  It did nothing to alleviate the heat.  If anything, it was even warmer.

Maria turned her phone’s flashlight on.

We were in a corridor, much the same size as the tunnel we’d just escaped.  The walls glistened with moisture, shining with the gray-pink color of rotting beef.  There were no sharp angles, just a round passageway that vanished into darkness at the edge of Maria’s flashlight beam.  The floor beneath our feet was slightly squishy.

And it was full of teeth.

Honestly I think I would have preferred sharp teeth, like an animal’s fangs or something out of science fiction.  Instead, we got human incisors, circling the entirety of the tunnel in regular intervals.

The tunnel rippled.  There was a faint gurgling sound, like the rumbling of a stomach twisting in hunger.  And those rows of teeth began to tighten as the tunnel constricted around us.

“STEAM GHOST,” Maria yelled.  “I CHOOSE THE STEAM GHOST.”

And she threw the door behind us open and dove back into the tunnel.  Jacob grabbed my arm and dragged me along with him, as I was frozen in fear, staring at all those glistening ivory teeth.  I stumbled over the doorframe and fell forwards, hitting the cement floor hard on all fours.  I heard the door slam shut behind me.  Frantically, I looked up at the tunnel.

No ghost.  But the steam was still there, hanging heavy in the air and filling my lungs.  The ghost would be back.  I was certain of that.

“What now?!” Jacob asked, his earlier calm quickly giving way to panic.

“Try the door again!” I said, scrambling to my feet.  “It changes!”

Maria spun around and opened the door a sliver for the second time, just enough to peer through the crack and confirm what was on the other side.

“FUCK.”

Then she slammed it shut.  Opened it.  Another burst of profanity, slightly more panicked than the last explicative.  Meanwhile, Jacob and I cowered at her back, staring at the steam that hung thick in the air all around us, waiting to see if it was going to reform into a malevolent spirit while Maria played Russian roulette with the door.

She did this five times before she finally got the dorm we’d entered through.

Flushed and panting, we stumbled through and Jacob kicked the door to the steam tunnels shut with a determined flourish.  There.  We’d done it.  As I’d said, our plan went perfectly.  We got the photo and ran like hell to the door.

Didn’t plan on what happened after we went through the door.  This is my lack of attention to detail coming into play, which is probably what also made me a shitty barista.

We crowded around Jacob to see the photo he got.  This is why we recruited someone with actual photography skills.  He was able to use a truly shitty camera intended for toddlers to somehow focus on a literal ghost’s face in the handful of seconds we had before it reached us, all while not panicking.

Staring at us from the tiny screen was a person’s face.  Not a face made of steam.  An actual flesh and blood human face.  The rest of the shot was obscured by steam, framing it so that all we could see was this disembodied human face staring out at us from the camera’s digital screen.  The expression was placid, the eyes hollow and devoid of emotion.

I’d seen this look before, on the library ghost.  This distant stare of something that wasn’t wholly here.

“That is… really creepy,” Jacob said.

“We just escaped a hallway full of teeth and this is what you find creepy?” I said.

“No, that was creepy too.  I can be terrified by multiple things at once.”

We all stared at the photo for a good few minutes, trying to commit the face to memory because we were not going to retain any copies of it.  Then Jacob deleted the photo, handed me the camera, and we awkwardly went our separate ways.

I got out my phone as soon as we’d all walked off.  My theory was looking plausible, but there was one more thing I could do to confirm I was on the right track.

I texted Grayson.  I asked him if the children before him, the ones the president adopted, were all male.

They were.

The library ghost.  The stabbed student.  And now… the steam ghost.

All former students.  All male.  All trapped on campus after their deaths.

And for at least two of them, they seemed to have something against Grayson.

They don’t like Grayson because he [replaced](https://alderrayne.com/) [them](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/).
