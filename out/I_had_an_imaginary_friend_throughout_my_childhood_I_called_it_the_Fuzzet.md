I remember the day I first met my imaginary friend. Not the exact day, of course; it was one of my earliest childhood memories. But I remember the events.

There was a preschool program at the local Catholic church I went to. They had a large event space room with a horrible green carpeted floor. They would use the room for recess when weather didn’t allow us on the small prefabricated playground the church also had.  

I was running around this room one day, probably a bit too fast and recklessly, when I tripped over my own feet. I had to have; there was nothing on the floor to trip on. I remember turning my right hand over as I was getting up and seeing a large pool of blood in the center of my palm. I stared at it for a while. There was no pain, just the slow oozing pool, spreading. More blood than I had ever seen myself spill to that point. That’s when I started to cry. 

We washed my hand off at the drinking fountain and I got my hand bandaged with a thick gauze in one of the church leader’s offices. We never found out what pierced my hand. It was probably a loose thumbtack or something similar, but the fact we never found it always bothered me. 

I don’t remember much else of that day; that was just one of the few parts of my early childhood that got burned into my brain. Another lasting memory, though, was that night. I was having trouble sleeping again. Everything terrified me as a child and my room at night was no exception. The energy just felt different. I would spend most nights totally covering my face to avoid opening them in the middle of the night and seeing a ghost or ghoul. I got so used to this darkness that now as an adult I can’t sleep without my eyes being covered; the light on my eyelids wakes me up too easily. 

The stuffed animals I had around my room became some of the objects of my fear when night came. I was afraid that if I looked at them too long, I would see their eyes move or blink. I remember having to turn the large tiger plush I had in the corner of my room one morning so that it wouldn’t be staring at me anymore. One of the other things that scared me was the closet to the left of my bed. 

I was a side sleeper, and often had my back turned to that door. Maybe that’s why it scared me, the thought that anything going slither out of there and catch me unawares. It would have an easy time too. Opening the door wouldn’t make much noise; something was broken with the hinges and it never closed fully. There was always a little crack that could oh-so-easily be silently pushed open. Many a night I would find myself making deals in  my head with whatever I thought was in there to not attack; that I’d keep my eyes closed and let it roam the room and it couldn’t hurt me if I didn’t see it. You can imagine then, how paralyzed I was, when I heard a knocking at the door that night.

On some subconscious level, even that young, I knew my fears were irrational. That there wasn’t really some goblin in my room or living dolls. But that tapping at the door changed all of that. It was sharp, as if a finger with a long nail was tapping the wood. 

*Tap…tap…tap…*

I was frozen. I had flipped myself over to stare at the closet after the first tap and was now unable to move. Fear had locked me into place. I wanted to scream as the door started to slowly creak open. What came out shocked me.

A large, long snout was pushing its way through. A black, dog-like nose surrounded by a bright orange fur. The fur continued down as more and more of the thing snaked out. The head was similar to that of a weasel or a ferret, only much larger. Massive, really. I couldn’t understand how it fit in that closet.More of it slid out. The eyes were large and fully black. No pupils, but I could still somehow tell that it was looking at me. It continued out until its head was fully cleared, stopping by the side of my bed. Its long neck was still in the closet. And then it talked.

“*You’ve been a brave girl today, Holly.”* 

It flapped its lips in an exaggerated manner, like an old 3D video game. The words didn’t match the flapping of the mouth at all.  The voice that came out was androgynous. I stared at it. The bright orange fur reminded me of a stuffed toy’s fur, fuzzy and sticking up in areas and not bothering to look realistic. I didn’t know what to say. 

*“Your hand. You were very brave today.”* It continued. 

I certainly didn’t feel brave, both about the hand and about the situation I was in right now. Still at a loss for words, I simply nodded at the thing in my closet.

*“I’m proud of you. Continue being brave, Holly.”* 

And that was it. It started to pull itself back into the closet, the door somehow closing as the last bits of the head receded into it. I had no idea what to think. Later, in the light of the morning, I threw open that closet door and found nothing out of the ordinary. I had no idea what to think. Life went on as normal for the next few years. I had honestly put that whole night off as a weird dream, until I saw it again.

I was around six or seven when my grandfather passed. Cancer. It was my first experience with death. The first time someone I knew had passed. The first time I was hit with the fact that someone I knew, someone I loved, could just one day stop being in my life. I cried for a week. It was one of those nights, crying in bed, when the creature came tapping on the closet door again. It snaked its way out like last time. I wasn’t afraid; I knew what to expect now. 

*“Loss is difficult,”* It said in that strange voice, *“Especially the first time. But you are brave, Holly. You will get through this.”*

I sniffled. “T…thank you…” I froze, the words stuck in my throat. “What…are you?”

*“Think of me as a guardian, for children like you.”* 

“You just help children?”

*“Yes. You are the only ones who can see me.”* 

It asked if I ever dreamed of anything and it became real. Mundane stuff, like conversations or taking certain car trips or just a phrase a teacher or friend would say in class. I said I did, and it explained how children are more open to these kinds of mental things. How this phenomenon of deja-vu will fade as I grow older, and as that goes so will my ability to see this thing. 

It never told me its name. I called it the Fuzzet, due to its fuzzy and ferret-like appearance. It would show up throughout my childhood when I was alone and sad, to talk to me. It didn’t always come from the closet either. I remember crying in the bathroom after my father had yelled at me (not getting good enough grades or something; he was a drunk) only to hear the tapping come from the window. Sure enough, the Fuzzet was there, its long orange body shooting up to the sky. I actually stuck my head out and looked up that night. The body stretched up, and it was too dark to see if it rounded off to the roof or just continued up into the sky.

*“You’ve grown into a brave girl, Holly.”* It said, its words silky smooth. *“You might be brave enough to take the trip.”*

“Trip?”

*“Yes. I can take you somewhere, a place where all the brave children go. A place far from the sadness and worries of here.”* 	At this, the Fuzzet began to lazily open its mouth, giving me a view of the inside for the first time. It wasn’t dissimilar to the outside, the same fuzzy fur it had on the exterior all around the interior. At the back, just where the throat turned to the sky, was a hint of a white light. It slowly closed its mouth. 

*“The path requires courage.”*

“I…I don’t think I’m ready for that.” The whole thing was starting to make me uncomfortable. 

The thing nodded. *“It’s alright. One day, you’ll be able to.”* And then it was gone.

I’d be tempted by that offer one time. The last time I would see the Fuzzet.  

I was 16 then. My first love. My first heartbreak. It hurt so much. I thought I could be happy and it was ripped away. I didn’t want to feel this way, feel the sadness and emptiness. I didn’t want to be me. I didn’t want to get over it. I didn’t want to be here.

And that’s when the tapping came at my closet again.

It slid out of the darkness, once more completing its routine. I talked first. 	  
  
“I’m ready. I want to go.”

It didn’t reply. I swear I could see a faint smile at the edges of its mouth. It lazily opened its large mouth again and allowed me to get close. Once more, I looked down its throat. At the fur all around the inside, same as the outside, just as dry. At the hint of white light in the back, glowing brighter the more I focused on it. There was hope there. I just had to be brave enough to start crawling. 

I was about to start when something caught my eye. A shifting in the air, like the mirages you see above asphalt on a hot day. It started expanding; I couldn’t look away. And before I knew it, the throat looked…different. The walls of the throat were now wet, gummy flesh. The tufts of fur that shot out weren’t fur at all; they became rows and rows of tiny sharp teeth, pointing down the thing’s throat. The light at the end was gone, replaced by a pure, impenetrable darkness. 

I gasped and backed away quickly. The outside of the creature had changed too. An elongated humanoid face, snake-like in appearance, stared back at me. The eyes stayed the same, that cold, empty blackness. The mirage effect came back. Bits of the old Fuzzet came back, and parts of the new one stayed. A sharp pain stabbed my head. It was like my brain couldn’t pick what to show me. It closed its mouth and smiled at me.

*“Too old now.”* It hissed in that same voice, *“A shame you weren’t ready sooner. Goodbye, Holly.”*   

It backed into my closet and the door shut once again, for the last time. I was grabbing my head. The headache started to fade. I sat there for a while, terrified and confused. I never saw the Fuzzet again. 

I never felt at ease for the rest of my time in that house. I’ve tried to get over it, to move past it all, I really have. I still have a fear of snakes to this day. I’ve tied bells to the doors of the closet in every bedroom I’ve slept in since. I think it’s done with me though. I don’t think it would take me by force; it wants willing sacrifices, I can’t be too sure though. 

I’ve started a family and moved far away from my home state, far from that house. And its been good. I had almost forgotten about the Fuzzet. For once in my life I had almost moved past it. But then I saw it. When cleaning my little boy’s room. 

It was a picture he had drawn. Him in bed, with a large orange fuzzy thing sliding out from under his bed and talking to [him.](https://www.reddit.com/user/MicahCooper/)
