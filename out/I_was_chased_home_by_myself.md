I was walking home from work and the bar like usual. Getting the usual train at my local station. 

The Kayashima Station.

It was raining and quite beautiful. The sun was down and I felt quite peaceful. Even after a few drinks.

But something felt off this time. I couldn’t pin point what I was feeling, or how I should go ahead with this feeling.

The train arrived and I wasn’t thinking much of what was happening at that time. I started walking to the entrance of the train and suddenly the time slowed down. I couldn’t make sense of what was happening. My leg was half way moving foreword through the air.

I felt attracted to turning and looking to my left. But at the same time I didn’t want to. I felt an uneasy feeling about looking. Suddenly my head snapped and locked onto a man. The man was just standing there. The man was looking down wearing a hat covering everything on his face but his mouth. 

The man had a big grin. The biggest grin I have ever seen. It was peculiar. Percent teeth, same gap in the middle of his teeth like there is in mine. And his lips looked as purple as mine.

My vision started to warp and I was losing track of reality.

In the snap of a finger I came back to present time and was already on the train. Sitting down.
I couldn’t make out what just happened. I brushed it off thinking I must of had a bit too much to drink.

While on the train, the lights started to flicker. Which is strange because I’ve never seen them flicker. No one else seemed phased by the lights flickering.

I brushed it off and looked across from me. Still while the lights were flickering. The reflection showed someone sitting next me. the same person who I looked at while getting on the train.

I slowly turned my head and looked to my left. There was no one there. The lights abruptly turned off. There was no one anywhere. 

At this point I was in apathy. I couldn’t understand what was happening to me. I think I was going insane. 

My first thoughts were “I must of had a bit too much to drink” and “maybe upping the dosage of my psych medication is making me go insane”

But I couldn’t put two and two together. I was lost.

Suddenly I came back to present time again. The lights were on and the people abord the train were in the same positions as before.

I looked around confused I couldn’t tell what was going on. My mind was playing tricks with me.

I got off at the next stop. The Nishisansō Station. Which is where I was living at the time.

Before I stepped out of the station I pulled out my umbrella opened it, pulled out my antique cigarette case and flip lighter and had a smoke. The cigarette in my right hand in between my middle finger and ring finger. And the umbrella in my left hand leaning on my shoulder.

On the way home I walked past an alleyway. As I walked past it I felt somewhat attracted to it. The same way I felt when I saw that man. I slowly walked backwards and peaked my head into the alleyway.

There it was. The man. He was there. Standing there with the same grin. I was in shock. I ran and I ran and I ran for home. I couldn’t wrap my head around it.

Suddenly *BAM* I was hit by a truck. I wasn’t focused I couldn’t see straight and it was too late for me.

I woke up in the hospital. Not remembering what happened. I was told I was hit by a truck and was in a coma for a couple days.

The nurse was talking to me but I couldn’t pay attention. I felt like I was fading away. 

I told them my stories but they kept refusing it and was neglecting the fact that I was telling the truth. They said I was delusion and insane.

And then. Out of no where I was taken to an insane hospital.

It’s been a month. But it feels like years. I got to the point where I believed I was insane. And didn’t believe myself about what had occurred.

No one believed me. 
I was trapped. 
I couldn’t escape my thoughts. 
I kept seeing a fake version of it. 
But it was in my mind. 
My head. 
I felt like ripping my own eyes out. 

I couldn’t sleep. 
I couldn’t eat. 
I couldn’t do anything but be haunted.

But then it happened again. The man. The thing. The it…

The nurse.

It was me. With the same grin as before.

The thing that has been chasing me was… 

Me.
