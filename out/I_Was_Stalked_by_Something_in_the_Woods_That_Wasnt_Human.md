The forest was a raw throat, a place where the air hung thick with the reek of decayed hemlock and the iron smell of distant lightning scars. I went to suture myself in that silence, to let the rot of the woods overwrite the rot of living. 

My pack held a canteen, a knife with a blade dulled by previous solitudes, a map whose creases had swallowed whole valleys. No compass. The wilderness does not bow to cardinal directions.  

*Day 3.*

The trail I walked on frayed to a scribble, devoured by devil’s club whose thorns hooked deep as fishbones. 

I knelt at a seep spring, water pooling in the cup of a skunk cabbage leaf, and drank the lukewarm bile of the earth. 

My fingers found the gashes before my eyes did. Three trenches split the Douglas fir, each deeper than a man’s spite. 

Sap welled in the wounds, slow and resinous, catching the light like sucked candy. 

I thought it was a bear but they weren’t marks. Not exactly. They were *excavations*. Claws had torn upward in a single motion, nine inches between furrows, too deliberate, too vertical. A grizzly shreds bark sideways, shoulder-high, to say *I am here*. This said *I ascend*.  

I made camp where the creek bent like a broken finger, the ground soft enough to stake the tent. The fire was a pitiful congregation of sparks, coughing smoke that coiled blue in the windless dark. 

Supper was a can of beans pried open with the knife’s spine, the metal rim splitting my lip. Salt and blood. 

In that darkness, the growl came. Not the barrel deep thunder of bear gut, but a sound flayed of all warmth, a chainsaw’s snarl choked with hair and gristle. 

My flashlight beam juddered across the birch trunks. Nothing…

Then movement… 

Not a shape, but the *absence* of a shape, a blotch of void sliding between trees.  

I didn’t sleep that night. 

I lay spine glued to the tent floor, counting the arrhythmia of my heart. The woods had gone church quiet. No scuttle of voles. No screech owl’s requiem. Even the creek’s babble hushed, as if the water feared to speak.  

*Day 4.*

Dawn came gray as a jailhouse blanket. I packed in the half light, fingers numb, the tent fabric stiff with dew. The creek’s banks were a quagmire, boot sucking and fecund. 

That’s where I saw them…

Tracks. Five toed, splayed like a hand, each digit terminating in a talon that punched six inches into the muck. 

The arch was a grotesquery, a bridge too steep, the pressure points cratered as if the thing walked on nails. No paw. No hoof. 

A biped’s gait, but the stride was all wrong—eight feet between prints, the weight distribution suggesting something that moved faster than its mass should allow. 

I measured it against my field guide’s charts.

By noon the map became useless. 

I soon realized that I was lost.

Ridges listed into sinkholes. Creeks wrote themselves anew, looping like nooses. I navigated by the sun’s blurred eye, sweat gluing my shirt to my skin. 

The creature’s stench arrived then, a reek of wet iron and spoiled marrow, the stink of a slaughterhouse floor after a week’s rain. 

It was stalking me. 

Or rather, It was *husbanding*. 

Herding me eastward with calculated violence. 

Twice, movement flickered at the edge of my vision, a suggestion of limbs too long, joints too many, always retreating, always driving. 

The woods thickened into black spruce, their branches braided into a lattice. The forest floor was a reliquary, wolf scat studded with hare teeth, a raven’s skull nested in fiddleheads, the air buzzing with flies drunk on rot.  

Night fell. 

I built no fire. 

The creature would smell the smoke. 

I wedged myself under a widowmaker cedar, its trunk moss soft and crawling with bark beetles. The knife handle welded to my blistered palm. 

Silence. Then—  

Footsteps.  

Not the four beat cadence of predator or prey. 

A drag and crunch, drag and crunch, the rhythm of something that walked despite its bones’ protest. 

Sap rained from the cedar, slow and cold as lamp oil. 

Breathing followed, a wet suck and wheeze, as the thing smelled for me, lungs battling a ribcage grown inward, a sound like a drowning man laughing.  

It passed so close I tasted its breath, peat smoke and maggot blown meat. 

Moonlight sketched its silhouette, seven feet of wrong angles, shoulders hunched like a coat hung on a nail, limbs strung together with too many joints. Its skin was not skin. Lichen crusted its flanks in scabrous patches, the flesh beneath shimmering blackly, like the carapace of a beetle drowned in oil. 

Where its thigh grazed a thimbleberry bush, the hide sloughed off in parchment curls, revealing muscle beneath, gray, fibrous, threaded with veins that pulsed sour yellow. 

It stopped. Cocked its head. A drop of saliva fell from its lipless maw, burning a hole through a oxalis leaf with a hiss like a hot poker quenched.  

*Day 5*

The next morning I moved as the wounded move—crouched, lurching between nurse logs and granite outcroppings, my boots sinking into sphagnum moss that wept rusty water. 

I was starving now.

I peeled strips of yellow cedar bark, my nails splitting as I gnawed the fibers into paste. The pulp tasted of turpentine and deadfall. 

When I found salmonberries, their skins burst like pustules under river stones, releasing a juice the color of infected wounds. 

I lapped at the grit, my tongue scraping rock pocks for the sour tang of calories. 

Survival is arithmetic. 

Subtract dignity. 

Subtract hope.  

I made a throwing stick, a wrist thick alder branch, one end blackened and hardened over coals that tasted of lightning struck fir. 

Then I made a spear, a spruce shaft stripped with my knife, the tip carved to a needle’s point and tempered in ash until it gleamed like obsidian. 

By dusk, my palms wept pink serum, the blisters burst and gloving my hands in liquid skin.

I climbed a lodgepole pine, belt cinched to the trunk, boots wedged in bark fissures crawling with carpenter ants. 

Then the tree shuddered. 

Not from wind. 

From the growl that vibrated up its roots. 

A sound like a steel mill collapsing, bones snapping in the gears. Below, in the mud lit by a jaundiced moon, the creature left something for me. 

A snowshoe hare, gutted and arranged with precision. Entrails coiled in a Fibonacci spiral, heart perched atop a cairn of its own teeth, teeth stacked like ivory chess pieces. 

The thing was teasing me.

*Day 6*

I drank from a seep spring, water filtered through my shirt’s fabric. The cloth birthing wriggling larvae, translucent and veined. 

I ate them. 

Felt their bodies pop like blisters between my teeth, the brine sharp as a sailor’s last breath. 

My vision frayed. 

Shadows pulsed with parasitic luminescence. 

Birch trunks twisted into figures, my father, his ranger uniform studded with mildew, whispering *Track the blood, not the beast*. 

A girlfriend’s laugh nested in the bracken, decaying into the rasp of a scrub jay.  

As I walked I saw a raven hung from a Douglas fir, wings crucified with its own sinews, beak pried open to cradle a nest of blowfly larvae. 

Claw marks spiraled up the trees, each groove pulsing with sap that reeked of gangrene. I threw the spear at a flicker, not movement, but the *memory* of movement. 

It struck a cedar, shaft splintering with the report of a .22. When I wrenched it free, the wood seared my palms, coated in a mucus that steamed and ate through lichen like acid.

Night came.

I crouched in a thicket of stinging nettles, the hairs embedding in my forearms like fiberglass, each sting a match head burst of clarity. 

Flint sparked, but the char cloth was damp with fear sweat. The creature’s breath fogged the air, three separate rasps triangulating me. *Behind*. *Left*. *Above*. 

I dreamt awake, the thing’s face, a shifting diorama of bark shards and cartilage, eyes like boiled eggs veined with India ink. 

Its tongue unspooled, a black tendril probing my ear canal, whispering in the dialect of wasp nests and creaking ice.  

*Day 7*

My body began to shut down. Muscles cannibalized, tendons frayed to catgut.

 I crawled through a gully where devil’s club thorns pierced my sleeves, each hook barbed with the genetics of hatred. 

The air curdled with skunk cabbage’s sweet decay stench, a perfume for the thing’s gallery.  

I came upon a clearing.

 Sunlight stabbed through the canopy, gilding a midden of bones. 

Femurs thrust upward like pale saplings, their marrow sucked clean by teeth that left helical grooves in the bone. 

Skulls nested in hemlock roots, sockets blooming ghostly *Xeromphalina* fungi, their gills phosphorescent in the gloam. 

A human pelvis dangled from a vine, the sacrum cracked open, a Zippo lighter—corroded to a green tumor, wedged where the spine had been. 

But it was the freshest corpse that undid me, a femur still sheathed in denim, the fabric fused to decomposing meat. A boot nearby, sole split like a grin, toes reduced to knuckles of gristle.  

Night came. 

I dug a pit with hands stripped raw, fingers plowing through strata of loam and glacial till until the blisters burst, leaving my palms gloved in a slick of blood and lymph. 

The stakes were alder bones, sharpened on a river stone until their tips wept resinous sap in the bruise colored dusk. 

I draped the hole in a shroud of spruce boughs, their needles trembling as if in warning, then anointed the earth with my own urine, acrid and ammonia sharp—to foul the scent of fresh turned soil. 

Survival manuals preach traps like equations, depth, angle, trigger. 

They omit the sacrament of it. 

The way beetles seethed into my sleeves as I worked, their mandibles needling my wrists. 

The way the pit I crafted yawned like a mass grave for a god.  

A few hours had passed.

And soon the creature came.  

Not as predator, but as reckoning.  

It *detonated* from the treeline, limbs a grotesque clockwork of sinew and ruptured cartilage, joints firing like overpressured pistons. 

I struck the thing with my spear—a wild upward thrust into the hollow beneath its ribcage. The point skittered off its carapace, a mosaic of moss crusted plates oozing a viscous black ichor that reeked of rancid hive rot. The impact reverberated through my arms, ulnas humming like tuning forks.  

I pulled out my knife and swung. A backhanded slash caught its thigh, the blade shearing through fibrous tissue that parted like rotten canvas. Yellow pus erupted in a pressurized gout, splattering my face. 

It *burned*. My scream tore the night as I clawed at my eyes, vision dissolving into acid-etched white. The creature’s talons found me then, a backhanded blow that sent me pinwheeling into a Douglas fir. 

My ribs snapped.

It lunged, jaws distending in a gelatinous unraveling, a gullet ribbed with teeth like barbed wire and shattered stained glass. 

The ground surrendered.  

The pit swallowed it whole. 

For a heartbeat, silence. 

Then the alder stakes screamed. 

Not the creature—the *wood itself*, shrieking as the thing thrashed, splintering the shafts with a sound like a thousand chicken necks wrung in unison. 

It climbed. 

Talons pistoned into the earth, hauling a lower body mangled into a nest of splinters and glistening viscera. 

Its blood was a miasma—sweetness curdled into fungal decay, the stench of a corpseflower blooming in a sealed tomb.  

I scrambled backward, my ribs grinding like millstones, and struck a match I had kept in my back pocket. 

The brushpile ignited with a phlegmatic *whump*, flames vomiting upward in a corona of ash and hunger.  

Light baptized the abomination.  

Its face was a negative of creation, a concave void where eyes should have been, socketed with strands of mucous that hardened into jagged chandeliers of ice as they dripped. 

The mouth was a verticle ruin, a lipless cleft splitting its skull, lined with teeth curved like sickle blades. The torso, a cathedral of perversion. Cartilage ribs caged a palpitating sac of membrane, organs suspended in amniotic pus, a heart blackened and prunish, lungs like collapsed fire bellows.  

It *screamed*.  

The sound bypassed ears. It was a pressure, a subsonic howl that vibrated. 

A pileated woodpecker fell dead from its roost, wings locked in rigor, beak snapping open and shut in a silent parody of alarm.  

It charged through the conflagration.  

Flames clung to its carapace, melting the plates into a tarry deluge that sloughed off in smoking ribbons. 

I seized a burning branch, embers branding my palm to the tendon, and drove it into the thing’s thoracic cavity.  

The branch breached the sac. 

The creature *convulsed*, jaws snapping shut a hair’s breadth from my face. A tooth—serrated and yellow as an old coffin nail—grazed my temple, flaying skin from cheekbone in a wet red curtain. 

We fell together into the pyre.  

It thrashed beneath me, talons raking my back, peeling flesh that clung to its claws like pork rind. 

I twisted the branch, grinding it deeper until flames licked the thing’s heart. The fluid hit my chest, sizzling through my shirt, etching a constellation of chemical burns. 

The death rattle was a wet gurgle, limbs drumming a final arrhythmic spasm against the earth. Then… stillness.  

Dawn found me crawling through ashes that stuck to my burns like leprous skin. My hands were fused to the branch, meat and wood married in a blackened sacrament. 

The creature’s corpse lay half consumed, torso cratered, bones jutting like antlers from the muck. Rain came, needle sharp and relentless—scrubbing its remains into the mud until only teeth remained.

A search party found me three days later in a talus field, my knees shredded to raw meat from dragging myself over granite teeth. 

They called it psychosis. 

PTSD. 

The medic’s penlight hesitated on my back—four parallel furrows, too deep, too *precise* for any natural claw. 

The botanist refused to cross the tree line. 

She stood haloed by standing deadwood, staring at the scarred trunks.

The tooth rests in a formaldehyde jar now, beside my father’s tarnished ranger badge. 

Some nights, when the house settles into its bones, I press my ear to the glass and listen to it *hiss.*
