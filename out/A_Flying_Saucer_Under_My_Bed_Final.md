I had slipped into bed.  I was scared.  I was scared of him.  I knew he had something to do with it.  Looking back, no shit, he had something to do with it.  He had everything to do with it.  I stared at the ceiling all night, shaking.  The humming under my bed haunted my conscience, a beacon of my betrayal.  

I managed to fall asleep at some point, and when I woke up, the humming was gone.  I dared to look under my bed.  The saucer was gone.  A little envelope sat isolated in its place.  

A knock at my door jolted my attention to it, “Sweety, are you up?” My mom asked from the other side.  

I let her in; she was beaming.  She gave me a quick hug, unable to contain herself, “Oh, guess what happened?”  She asked as she embraced me.  “Oh, it's amazing news! Miraculous news!”

I pulled away from her, far too old for the affection, so I assumed at that time, “What is it?” I looked up at her with red circles haunting my eyes.  

She pushed my brown hair out of my face, “Mikey woke up this morning! And he was awake… really awake! He was talking and moving on his own!”

I cannot express enough the surge of relief that quaked through my guilt-weighted body.  I caved in, hugging my mom back with big tears drenching my face and her shirt.

A miracle.  A miracle.  

My mom informed me once I calmed down that Mr. and Mrs. Onett would be bringing him home this evening after some final tests were run.  Tests?  I thought that was weird to test someone who had recovered, but was happy nonetheless.  Now, I know why they ran the tests.  I reached out to Mrs. Onett years later.  Now I know.  

I was shaking with anticipation all day, and I barely got sleep that night.  I jolted awake the next morning and ran to our family telephone.  I hurriedly dialed the Onett’s house and waited for the familiar voice to answer.  Mrs.Onett picked up and, with an audible smile, called Mikey over to the phone for me to talk to. It was him.  His voice was as vibrant and true as when I talked to him last on the walkie-talkie.  “Hi, Mikey!”  I yelled into the phone.  

“I’m back!  Did ya miss me!”  He joked.

We giddily set up a time to hang out.  He wanted me to meet at his house, which I thought was strange.  We always met at mine.  But with excitement still flooding my brain, I agreed and spent the rest of the morning planning and throwing down breakfast, much-needed fuel for the fun to come, I thought.  

I ran to his home and was greeted by his mom, who quickly called Mikey to the door.  As he stepped outside, I jumped him with a giant hug, before dragging him hurriedly to the lawn to discuss the adventure I had orchestrated over pancakes.  

Before I could begin to explain, he cut me off with a shock that rattled me.

“Let's go back to the woods!  Ya know, where the sauce was!”

My stomach churned, “...Why would we go there?”

“I bet there’s some cool pieces of rubble we could collect and sell to science!”

Stunned at Mikey’s sudden proposal, I tried thinking up an excuse.  But he had already started marching down the road, “Come on, man, lead the way!”

A dryness assaulted my throat, but I didn’t want to disappoint Mikey, the guilt of what I had done still choking my heart. “Ok,”  I said meekly.

He followed me the rest of the way in silence.  Not that I was in much of a mood to chit-chat either.  Although every time I glanced back at him, his eyes were locked on me.  When I stopped, he halted as well.  This only fueled my cringing innards as a cocktail of anxiety and fear pulsed through my system.  Every thought a kid could have, I had.  Was he going to beat me up in the woods? Was this a way of getting back at me?  Was he going to run off and leave me alone near that… crater? 

These thoughts haunted me as we hiked along, mute.  It was the peak of the afternoon when we entered the treeline.  The shade seemed to suffocate me, the swaying branches a collection of black arms clawing at me.  All with Mikey’s cold presence trailing just behind me.  Waiting for the destination to be presented to him.  

We reached the crater.  A slew of mild overgrowth had collected around it, but the hole sat there clearly in the open.  I looked down into the trench.  No saucer lay waiting for me.  One less scenario for my mind to haunt me with.  

“...Well,” I began awkwardly, “Here we are again.  You want to head back now?”

Mikey stared down into the hole.  No response came from him.  Wordlessly, he stepped down into the crater and made his way to the center of it.  

“Mikey!”  I called after him, horrified.  

He ignored me as he crouched at the crash site, the shape of the saucer still indented in the earth.  With his back to me, I could not see what he was doing, only that he seemed to be rummaging for a few seconds before bolting upright and climbing out of the pit.  With a big smile returning to his face, he turned to me and said, “That was cool!  I’m ready to go now!”  And he marched back down the way we came.  

I was too flabbergasted to ask what he was doing, and too emotionally drained from the long walk of anxiety I had just endured.  With relief settling back in, I ran after him and returned home.  

The walk back was still riddled with some silence, but we managed to get some laughs in by the time we reached the familiar turn to our neighborhood’s street.  With a wave, Mikey and I parted ways, the evening Summer sun still shining as I walked up my driveway.  

That was the last time I went to those woods.  I detested them.  The remainder of the Summer was spent bouncing from lawn to lawn, rekindling the normal cycle of friendship and play I had disrupted with my extraterrestrial visitor.  The letter he had left stayed under my bed, and the thought of even touching it ate me up every night as I would crawl into bed.  

Before I knew it, we were all back in school, Fall was here.  I saw Mikey less and less as the school year continued.  It was around the beginning of Spring when I saw him last.  He was…paler.  Off.  He remained cheerful when approached.  The rest of the time, he would sit quietly at his desk staring with a blank face at the chalkboard.  Just as we were all heading out to catch the buses home, I nabbed him and asked how he was doing.  If he had tried going to the nurse. 

“No, I will be fine.”  Was all he said.  

The next morning, he was missing.  

The remainder of the school year was a blur of misery and confusion for the whole community.  Search parties went out for weeks.  They actually stumbled upon what was once the crater.  I was with them.  It was so overgrown that none of the adults took notice of it.  I tore through the greenery, my stomach filled with that familiar twist of anxiety.  The memory of Mikey and I’s last visit here seared my mind as I pulled growth off the center of the crater.  The image of him crouching in this very spot.  

With a lurch, I tore the last of the overgrowth.  A single footprint, plain as day, sat imprinted in the dirt, right beside the indent of the saucer.  

I knew that we would never find Mikey.  Never.  I had killed my best friend.  I knew that.  I had been responsible for this.  I trusted something I should never have.  That was the last search party I went with.  The searches died out after a few more weeks; no sign was ever found by the adults.  No scent from police dogs ever picked up.  Mikey was no longer with us.  All there was to do now was to mourn.  

Mourn I did.  For weeks, I was a shadow.  Shame, guilt, sorrow, all these emotions tore me apart.  Still do really.  My tenth birthday rolled around without my knowledge or care.  My dad led me outside that night, birthday cake lit on the patio table beside my telescope.  With a sad smile, he hugged me and sliced me a huge chunk of ice cream cake.  I numbly ate it when I noticed the stars.  One of them was moving.  As my dad returned inside to gather presents with my mom, I jumped to the telescope, heart racing.  

Peering through the lens, I saw it.  The red blinking light, zig-zagging its way into space.  All warmth left my body.  I stared as it slowly disappeared into the darkness of that Summer sky.  A thought jolted me, and I burst back into the house, running upstairs to my room.  Passing the bewildered looks of my parents, I rushed up the steps, entered my room, and locked the door behind me.   

I stared at my bed for a while.  With a deep inhale, I leaped under it and grabbed the dusty envelope.  With shaking hands, I tore it open.  It was a letter.  The paper had cartoony flying saucers all over the rims of the page.  I read what little text there was:

*Thank you for the data.  My IMP has mastered biological cloning.  We appreciate your contribution and look forward to future endeavors.* 

I think that's all I remember that matters.  I didn’t understand it then, but with what I learned from Mrs. Onett, I understand it better now.  Mikey, when he was first brought to the hospital, had been scanned for brain damage.  They found what they believed was an extensive parasitic worm wrapped around his brain.  Once he woke up, they tested to see if what little treatment they did, worked.  That morning, the worm was gone from the scans.

She showed me that first scan; all these years later, she still had it.  She let me look it over.  It certainly looked like a worm.  But I saw it.  It was clever and seemed to slide out of view from every angle they got of Mikey’s brain.  A little ball at the end of it.  I am sure it was blinking all the while.
