The culmination of my most profound experience took place in a town called Jiwani next to Gwadar Bay, on the Makran coast of the Arabian sea, 35km eastern to the Iranian border. Its dessert core encapsulated tall cliffs, capped with the prestige of limestone in an east-west direction. Mangrove swamps intersected forests to the south, and flat barren land ran to the north; merging with a steep clay hill, which carried me to the town with a reluctant push from dust and wind. A long sea front provided a splendid backdrop from my hut. There, I rejoiced in the breathtaking Makran sunset.

A cataclysmic remnant of an asteroid strike ended the reign of the dinosaur 66 million years ago, it blasted 300 billion tonnes of sulphur into the atmosphere, merging with ash and dust to form an expansive grey cloud. It embraced the entire planet and blocked out the sunlight, orchestrating the destruction of all life forms. The sky would eventually clear many years later, and there is no doubt in my mind that it was in Makran, that the sun shined as though it was the very first time, giving hope to humanity with its many vibrant shades.

As the sun dropped into the front window of my hut, it modified from yellow to orange, then speckled with red like a Cranberry and finally a decisive purple would flicker on my face. Signalling the inception of a soothing ballad to my ears, as the muezzin would make his call for the dusk prayer, reaching the shore of Jiwani beach and perhaps beyond.

This is how I’d start a typical travel blog, with details of my fondest memory rushing to the tips of my fingers. It is how I had hoped to recall my time on the Makran coast.

This is no ordinary post, and it is unpleasing for me to share this entry with what I would wish was just a nightmare.

Until my extended leave of absence, I worked as a professor in the subject of aeronautics at the University of Birmingham. I was fortunate to lease a cosy little detached property in the centre of Edgbaston, with my wife Melody at the time. She died you see, in a horrible accident, and that’s when it began. My dependence that is, on Z-eplon, to help with my sleep. I went to therapy to talk about it, and I don’t think it helped much. I battled with my grief like we all do, and I couldn’t quiet accept my ill treatment, in the weeks leading up to her death.

I was given a prescription for Z-eplon, it was probably a good thing for limited use. I ended up taking more than necessary and often had a short supply. Lucky for me, my neighbour Harold and a wretched ‘friend’, who was a pharmacist by profession, being understanding of my ordeal, slipped a blister pack from time to time through my letterbox. He wasn’t everyone's cup of tea and I understand why now. I had felt he meant well deep down, living next to the devil all these years.

‘Abdus, I think you should take a break away from this place. You may sleep better surely. Go play a foolish game or go on an adventure,’ Harold said, during an impromptu afternoon tea at the hospitable patio of my garden, after his head peered over the fence in an odd way and willed me.

‘Yes, it has been on my mind. When the prolonged mourning ceremonies had completed, my distant cousin advised as such. Said he had been to the Makran coast with friends and failed to describe the infamous sunset because it had to be experienced.’

‘Oh, Abdus,’ Harold said putting down his teacup, ‘if you are going there, be sure to stop at the Hingol National Park along the coast, I’ve been informed of unique rock formations. It would be good to know if it’s worth a visit.’

It wasn’t at all surprising that he said this, considering his interest in archaeology. He had his own blog about numerous artefacts which struggled to pique my fancy, although I am a curious fellow.

‘Indeed, it will most certainly be taken into consideration. If you would be kind to give me any details on the locality, that would be a help,’ I said.

‘As a matter of fact, I can do more than that. I have an old acquaintance by the name of Gopal who lives within a canyon in the park, we write to each other once a month. He keeps guard of a shrine encasing a severed hand.’

‘That’s a bit strange is it not?’

‘Are you not aware of the folk tale? I have it in my blog Abdus.’ Harold said, with a slight hint of arrogance.

I sniffed at the idea of someone spending their spare time on a blog concerning useless fiction. However, I allowed him to oblige me.

‘I may have read a passage from the titular subject matter, but I can’t seem to recollect it,’ I said politely.

‘Allow me to reverse your ignorance. In the early 700’s, the Sultan Ibn-Wahab of the Al-Najdi dynasty, commanded an army for a large-scale invasion of Makran. Some years later the Arabs ruled the region known today as Gwadar, they were met with fierce resistance along the coast, nevertheless, majority of the towns ended up signing peace treaties begrudgingly. The new inhabitants found adjustment on the coast difficult. The heat was punishing, water was scanty, fruits unsavoury and the desert was an infinite pavement of rock and pebble. When half the army had depleted, forces from the town of Pasni took back control and captured the Sultan Ibn-Wahab, who was eventually buried with his body cut in 7 parts. His left hand was kept as a reminder to repel wishful invaders.’

I went silent for a few moments and had a drink of water.

‘Well, that’s something. You paint a vivid picture my friend. Why does this strike your nerve? it is bleak,’ I said quietly.

‘There are many who consider the Sultan Ibn-Wahab and his devotees to be the original and purest occupants of Gwadar, this group call themselves the Salaf. It is their belief that the hand can open a gateway for the dead.’ Harold winked at me arrogantly.

‘I beg your pardon, Harold.’

‘You heard me old man. Gopal has told me all about it, the hand under certain conditions, can enable the rising of the dead.’

‘All right, now that you have bought something like this up again, I care not for such fantasies. Being in my profession, I cannot afford to be the authority on these peculiar beliefs. For I have rarely failed to conceal my views on the matter,’ I said, raising the acoustics of my voice.

‘I will not convict you for that,’ Harold said.

‘Any approximation to the mere thought that humours the existence of such things, is a revocation of all that I hold sacred. I am afraid I have lost you, I should not go further, my point is made.’

‘Not at all, not at all,’ Harold said quickly. ‘Back on the matter at hand, if a potential trip is of interest, I can make your acquaintance with Gopal.’

‘Yes, the mysterious retreat is intriguing.’ I presumed I was giving into my heart’s desire, and with all honesty, since Melody parted, being a recluse frightened me.

‘Through my exchanges with Gopal, I am aware of a hut, which neighbours the shrine on the outskirts of Jiwani. Very domesticated for tourists of our stature, and there are two beds to, room is aplenty!’

‘I suppose the space ought to be used or it could get rather lonely,’ I said.

‘I’ve longed to visit myself, I could most certainly fill that void, Abdus.’

I shuddered and laughed a little nervously.

‘By all accounts, that would be a delight, Harold. Unfortunately, my growing introversion would be a nuisance for you, you may not like the quiet when out and about, would you?’

‘No, good gracious!’ Harold spouted.

‘I’m afraid when my blog note taking ends, I may wonder without excursion, it would be rather simple.’

‘Oh, we don’t know that for certain! Besides, my own writings are long overdue.’

It was always my intention to be politely truthful in such tangles. But it is my fear that Harold took advantage of such knowledge.

‘Well, in all honesty, Harold, it sounds like the accommodation may not be sufficient for the both of us. It may also be possible that my need for solitude could be disturbed.’

Harold laughed maniacally.

‘You are good Abdus. Don’t you concern yourself, this er solitude will not be disturbed, you can bet on it. May I propose to join you after a fortnight?’

‘This is agreeable, Harold.’ My cheeks turned red. It was a suitable compromise, and in any case, I thought it couldn’t hurt to have well informed company in alien territory.

After that slightly awkward encounter with rude Harold, I wanted to visit Melody. Despite my rigid beliefs, I sort of considered it to be auspicious, prior to any lengthy trip, perhaps not lengthy all the time, or at least to my expectation.

And so, I acquired the black magic variant of Melody’s favourite rose and scented it with one of her fruity pocket perfume sprays, though it may be odd, I’m going to miss the profound smell off apples when she looked her best around me. I rested the bouquet at the root of her gravestone and retired to my vacant quarters.

\*

It wasn’t long after my acquaintance was made with Gopal, that I soon found myself sat next to an associate of his in a rugged Jeep, who went by the name of Rehman. We were on our way towards the border of the Balochistan province, 25km west of Karachi. My father was fluent in Urdu and Arabic, though he did little to converse with me in either language, aside the derogatory insults. It only pushed me further towards the ways of an English gentleman. Though Harold was a rude fellow, I was able to much appreciate the honourable native quality in him. There was however, some common verbiage, which I had learned and enabled me to make small talk.

‘Asalam-laykum, you must be Rehman, English?’

‘Walaikum-salam, yes.’ Rehman replied bluntly.

‘Wonderful! It is my hope all is in order, how is Gopal?’

‘Good.’

I couldn’t tell if it was his uninterest, annoyance or lack of fluency in the trade language, or perhaps something else altogether. I wasn’t able to make out his expression for clues, his face was covered by a middle eastern styled Litham he wore, like the one from Lawrence of Arabiya. His wrinkled skin was a gritty olive, toughened evidently by dust storms. And the panther like stare was most poignant.

He handed me a bottle of water to which I said ‘shukriya’, and then kept a dubious silence. It was broken when we encountered members of the border patrol, they held the notorious AK-47s in their hands and approached our Jeep.

‘Calm, please give passport.’ Rehman asked me promptly.

Though I was nervous at the sight of masked men armed with violence, Rehman’s demeanour and words, or should I say ‘word’ comforted me. After one of the patrol members took a quick glance at my paperwork, he exchanged an experienced nod with Rehman, and we were on our way towards the Makran Cost.

‘For long long time, Makran – no one coming, they can’t come here. You people can’t, I can’t, nobody can. There was a movement here and Militant everywhere, Balouch people want their own country. But now, but now, Army control Balochistan you know. We safe.’

‘That’s most pleasing, it will surely not diminish the pleasure of my visit.’ I chuckled. Rehman remained still and we continued on our merry way along the national highway, informally known as the Makran Coastal Highway. We skirted the Arabian sea, my eyes glistened with sapphire and crystal, between the specks which expanded into fishing boats.

Rehman seemingly more confident in his speech, spoke of the reliance on eel, carb, lobster and sardine, the bedrock of the Makran economy since the inception of the coast. ‘Makran’ itself derived from the Persian description for ‘fish eateries.’ Besides the marvellous fish, ship breaking was another common industry practice. I was warned of the practice of smuggling to.

A strong gust helped pull our vehicle’s all-wheel drive against the asphalt road’s increasing elevation.

‘It bumpy ride for you.’ Rehman said with something which sounded like a muffled laugh as he swinged the steering wheel harshly around a U-shaped bend.

‘Er yes--’

‘This nothing! Alexander the Great walk here in his chapal, his army struggle on horseback, too too hot and no road like this, some manage to cross Makran into Babylon; we call Iraq now, but most die.’ It was clear he said this with a smile concealed under the discoloured fabric of his mouth veil.

‘Allegedly, indeed. In any case, I am enjoying the splendid scenery,’ I said, to which Rehman may have scoffed at and pushed harder at the throttle, as he hastened to beat the sunset for my pleasure.

In my light readings of the subject province prior to my departure, I found it rather compelling that it was the largest in the region, although the least populated. This point was half confirmed as we journeyed along the coast, there were occasional flashes of life. A farmer commanding a herd of cattle on their way to some obscure market in these parts, an ancient sedan parked at the foot of the shore with its bonnet occupied by a pair of gentleman, children playing cricket on an impromptu pitch and the pretentious rainbow trucks which would pass, jingling at the front and rear; I had presumed the intention behind the trinkets was to erect ones attention.

‘Truck make big noise yes? Driver think it keep him safe and stop nazar, he use black cloth to.’

Thanks to colonialism, it may be futile to highlight what nazar meant, even so, may I remind you it is the evil eye. I thought better than to entertain such absurdity or engage Rehman on the topic, though his feelings were not clear to me.

Light was starting to fade and the Hut was within reach, I no longer saw man or animal, nor the faint clanging of chains in the distance from the truck's bumpers which passed before. I had a thought in this moment, while such barren land ought to be sparsely populated, the province was no longer off limits. Yet I could swear to you, it was my feeling that no soul with knowledge came here by choice. Why did those in the know, want to feed a land which had already starved to death?

My excitement had not completely subsided, still, a baffling apprehension crept up my spinal cord and into my brain.

\*

The hut was like a blip in a vacuum, the sea front was within sight from the balcony however, and a thin breeze permitted Rehman to pour me tea. I gave ‘shukriya’ once more. Nothing had to be said as we watched the Makran sunset, I hoped I lived to see it another day.

Such wonders were to be shared with those you love, I had the poor excuse of my wife’s death, but I had family. Nevertheless, it was my decision to become distant. Harold was very supportive in this regard. I couldn’t be seen with my growing depression, and there was simply no argument as I failed to escape subordination to Z-eplon; my hands trembled with the notion. I recalled my final dose had been taken before the outset of my travel.

Rehman skipped down the front steps of the bungalow and bid me farewell, not before noting I had all to be desired and that Gopal would meet me the next evening at my new residence. We said our goodbyes in the interim and I turned to the front double door, opened at an inviting angle.

I wasn’t entirely expecting Buckingham Palace, I had squashed Harold’s attempts to harness my preconceived ideas. My initial viewing was intensive, there was a dining room which was sandwiched in the middle of an ensuite bedroom and a sitting room, the interior walls were thick and there was decent capacity for my lungs. Indeed, Harold was true to his words, a second bed seemed to fit seamlessly.

A ‘Sajji’ dish had been prepared for me prior to my arrival, the pieces of rare roasted lamb melted my soul, it had been cooked around a fire for some hours, I wondered there must be something in the air here, for I have been unable to unlock the complete powers of salt and pepper. After I had finished the best meal I had in months, I retired to the lounge, lighting the candles in the four corners and taking out my pipe. After enveloping my mouth with smoke, I inhaled gently, and was soon much calmer. It had been so warm and sticky, that inside, it took my brain a little while to soak up how chilly it was. And so, I prepared the fireplace with fresh olive wood which had been provided for my convenience. The springs in my back lost their elasticity against the sofa’s cushion and I watched the flames; dancing mockingly. The heat moved my gaze towards a vintage mid-century corner table, a book lay above it, wiping away a foam of dust from the front cover, it read ‘Poems by A. Iqbal’. I restored my compatibility with the sofa and opened to the bookmarked page with the puff of my pipe.

Title: Devotion and Death

He was going towards the Paradise for a stroll.

He met death on its way by destiny’s roll.

He asked death, “What is the name and work of yours

I do not want to encounter the face of yours”

Hearing this said the angel of death

“My work is clear, I am the angel of death

I shatter the chattels of existence

I extinguish the spark of life.

The magic of annihilation is in my eyes.

The message of destruction is its symbol.”

A little bleak to my usual readings. I shuddered to a pleasant snooze.

It was a quarter to three in the morning when an icy trace of air hit my face, it slithered down my neck and up my open castle of sensitivity in a stealthy way. The fire was out, a dim illumination came from one of the candles next to the corner table, its flame flickered like a warrior’s last stand after his brothers in arms had been defeated. There was a small window on the wall behind the sofa, upon my inspection, I found that it was open, just a crack. I didn’t seem to recall it being that way. I convicted an enthusiastic gust for my troubles and was heading towards the bedroom, and that was when the disturbance came.

There was a muffled, barely audible sound from somewhere to the hut’s front. To my understanding in that moment, pebbles may have been uplifted by the wind or maybe it was trinkets from a rainbow truck in the distance. Then it grew louder.

I walked unsteady to the dining room which attached to the narrow hallway, it appeared my faculties were in good order, as it came from the entrance double doors. Something was thumping the door and it no longer sounded like pebbles or trinkets.

The thumping was deliberate and rhythmic: thump-thump-thump. It wasn’t exactly knuckles to the wooden frame, the closest comparison would be the sound you make when you’re stomping your feet in disgust, except the power of trickery assisting you.

I thought maybe it was Harold, who may have travelled right after me, to play such a foolish prank. I felt it had to be a stretch even for someone of his standing. To test my theory, I decided to pull the curtains from the window across the dining, thump-thump-thump, in one fluid motion I peeked my head through the gap I had created and saw nothing, it was just the wind whistling as though it knew me within the bones.

As I turned around on dodgy footing, it started again, thump-thump-thump, a menacing sound ringed in my ears and I was unable to ignore it. The thumping soon had turned into muffled words, I was unable to confirm if the voice belonged to man, woman or something else entirely. I am not frightened so easily yet I was moved by the familiar tone it made.

When Melody passed, she was asphyxiating, in-between her gasps for air she was trying to say something which came out as fragmented gabbling; she knew the words could no longer be fixed. And it occurred to me that the voice which came from the other side of the double door, was gabbling, just like my wife did.

The memory of a cherished one’s terminal breath can have a profound impact, it never left me and so I had to force it out of the deep confines of my soul before the full moon. In doing this I was able to convince my brain of the senseless fallacy which came in the dark of night. And with the power of this thought, the gabbling melted away, and I resigned to my interrupted sleep.

\*

No words were to be said of the Makran sunset. As for the sunrise, even to the shuttered faculty, the warmth of sweet potato settled within my eyelids and blazed me with the wonderment of a dream I wished to remember when the reality of morning had come.

I made myself fresh with the releasement of acid and put the kettle on, there was an indescribable, truly British serenity in performing this early routine. It would be no different to any other day, except I had my tea before the cooling current of air which allured me from the seafront.

I planned to make some general notes regarding my travels, continued my long overdue readings and I considered inspecting the pantry, anticipating hunger. I didn’t quiet recall if Rehman had mentioned when I was to be acquainted with Gopal, although I assumed it would be during sociable hours.

The pantry was in the cellar and acted as the cold storage in the desert climate, I gained access by pulling on the handle of a trap door in the front hallway and saw a narrow stairwell. The rugged concrete walls looked and felt awful, each step I took on mud and stone, echoed in the claustrophobic bridge to the unknown. I paused on every fifth step to confirm the pounding of my own feet alone. I quickened my pace, made it to the landing and turned the key which expected me, the heavy steel of the door was being stubborn and so, a little force needed to be applied and I fell inside. A whiff off a potent stench hit me immediately, I contemplated surveying the source, but I was in complete blackness and the foul odour seemed to grow in strength with my attempts to continue deeper in the miserable pit, perhaps rising damp or mouldy fruit. I had to turn around and to my delight, saw a chest refrigerator next to the door’s frame, light glimmered from above the stairs, or else it would be easy to evade. I found a range of steaks, picked up a sirloin cut and made haste up the stairwell, not knowing why.

Teas and pastries extended my pang free gut into the afternoon. An inkling forced me to save my steak for dinner, anticipating the absence of my host. And when the virgin evening came along with a simmering rumble in my gut, I cooked to the point of medium rare and set the dining room table; candle lit in the centre, steak knife to the left of my plate and the fork to my right, that may well be the breaking of etiquette, but it must be said that my left hand is reserved for filthy jobs like wiping the buttocks. A retched thought to convey with mouthful delicacies. Anyhow, my knife cut through like it would butter, and I sliced a piece of the block in half by biting into the red, guzzled with my tongue whipping from side to side and swallowed as I felt my food pipe shrink. I wouldn’t typically pay attention to such detail, perhaps it was being alone, though not uncommon in the prior weeks to my trip, something in my brain clicked to make it more engaged a long way from home.

I accepted that my hosts were delayed due to some emergency and removed the feeling of expectation. I was able to retire to the sitting room for my leisure and watched the flames burn the disappointments from the day.

Subsequently I fell into a lazy nap, the sort which I required in the moment, although my rather engaged brain, made a half attempt to keep me awake. It made me recall the night Melody left me. I tossed and turned in bed, as though I was trying to create a centrifugal force to trick me to sleep. My mind refused to accept the invitation of my intent, it knew something awful had happened. My hands trembled, like they do now, and it wasn’t due to my dependency. I got out of bed with a tension in my throat, as I walked unconsciously to our memorable lounge, something tightened the grip on my windpipe. There, I saw her, still as a block of ice and pale, oh so pale outside a couple of patches on her neck. Her eyes were widened to a terrifying length.

As I fought for sleep to come, it was sort of like the night I found Melody. The occurrence of suffering or the inevitability of death has a way of communicating with you through the universe, when the pain is too unbearable, and a desperate call is made for help or to say goodbye.

Thump-thump-thump. My heart jump-started and I found myself on the floor. I tried to settle myself thinking I heard it in an unpleasant dream but.....Thump-thump-thump.

The bells of my ears were ringing with an eerie enthusiasm, and my throat was being squeezed with spite. I got to my feet and walked reluctantly towards the front hallway, THUMP-THUMP-THUMP....I felt like my heart was going to explode as the horrid sound amplified, I was standing at the foot of the trap door. Suddenly, the thumping came to a piercing halt, and I started to hear heavy stomping footsteps from the cellar, something wet and meaty was running up and down the stairwell furiously quick.

It went back and forth on loop for a few minutes, before I heard an echo of it throwing itself against the steel door at the bottom of the cellar. Indecision caused piggish sweat to leak out the pores of my skin. I was trembling as I reached for the handle of the trap door, dread had come upon me.

I went down the pit and heard it again, it was gabbling sporadically. Halfway down, I could see the door open, just a split. That foul smell attacked me again and kept getting stronger. I pushed against the door and it creaked louder than I seemed to recall previously. Without much thought I yelled nervously, “WHO..uhh..who’s THERE?!”

The gabbling had come to a complete stop and there was a silence again which disturbed me more than any sounds it had made before. Barring a speckle of light which struggled to travel down to the cellar, I stood in a well of misery. At this point I should have retreated, even so, something compelled me to stay, because then......

“Abdusabdusabdusabdus.”

It gabbled my name with the same tone, it wasn’t in synch with its mouth if it even had one.

“Ohmyohmyyohmyyyabdusabdusabdusabdus.” I saw a silhouette seated in a rocking chair which swinged unnaturally. The outline was terrifyingly identifiable, yet I couldn’t place it. It oozed in the stench of spoiled apples and the flavour of death was in my mouth.

“Myabdusabdusabdus did you miss me miss me miss me?” it said and I began to feel sickly.

“Are you sorry abdusabdusabdus ohmyohmyohmyabdusabdusabdus, your wifey thinks you are, she’s right here.”

My testicles shrivelled and my legs were shaking. It sounded like my wife but not quite like her entirely; the way you put your head through a cardboard cut-out of some amusing beast at the funfair, it’s you, but not exactly.

“Myabdusabdus come closer dear, wifey’s back now, wifey’s so sad, so so sad at you...”

I didn’t realise how the gap had closed between me and that chair which squeaked horridly.

“I’m.....I’m sorry, I can’t.....I’m sorry for what happened,” I said to it, taking a few steps backwards slowly.

“Oh abdusabdusabdus, why don’t you come here dear and give wifey a hug now?” it said, “Or she will make sure you’re SO SO SORRY.” Its voice became deeper, and the gabbling had a sinister tone to it.

“My wife’s not here, I’m in no man's land and she has been dead for months, you’re not Melody.”

“I WON’T FORGIVE WON’T FORIVE YOU WE WON’T FORGIVE!” it screamed violently, as the malevolent figure snapped its neck in a nasty way.

I ran up the stairwell like a wounded animal which was being hunted and slammed the trap door shut. I got up in a fit and dashed for the bedroom as the candles in the sitting room went out past me and the wood no longer burned; it wanted me to know it was right behind me, but I refused to look back, stripped to my briefs and pulled the duvet over my face, like it was a shield against whatever it was that haunted me.
