It started with a link.

I thought it was a scam at first. It was a text message from a hidden number.

I don’t know why I clicked on it. Maybe it was just curiosity. Things that are forbidden hold their own kind of appeal. Like the urge to jump off a cliff when you look over the edge. When I held my thumb over the blue words, the ape urge to leap was stronger than the little common sense I had in my teenage brain.

I took the plunge.

After clicking, I was redirected to a private webpage with a video. I felt my shoulders tense as I pushed play.

I honestly expected some weird sex thing. But it wasn’t that.

It was me.

In the video, I was walking home from school. It was dark, and I could really only make out the shadow of myself. Our street didn’t have a lot of lights. I had gotten home late that day because of band practice. I could see my trumpet case, swinging as I walked along my neighbors fence. I saw myself running my hand along the smooth plastic boards, and then dropping my arm to feel the tall grass that grew at its base.

It was like watching a car accident. I was terrified, but I couldn’t look away.

The video was five minutes long. The camera kept on me all the way to my house and up my front porch. I saw myself open the door.

Then the footage cut.

I showed my parents. They called the police and it became a big scandal in our neighborhood. Everyone was on the lookout for the pervert stalker who filmed kids walking home. At one point we had a chaperon system. No teenager was allowed outside after dark without a suitable adult present.

It was annoying to everyone, including me. High School was hard enough, but now I was the kid who made everyone need a babysitter for three months.

I was not flavor of the week with anyone at school.

They never caught the person who made the video. After a few months of vigilance, they stopped keeping such a close eye on everyone.

A year passed. The memory of the video started to fade from everyone’s minds, even mine.

Then, on the anniversary of me getting the first video, I got another link.

It was Deja vu. I was a senior, and had just gotten home from a graduation party. I was tired, but when I got the text, I was immediately awake. I clicked on the link faster than I should have.

The video was of me at the party. It was taken from behind so you couldn’t see my face, but I recognized my shirt. It had the decal for a jazz competition I had competed in. About a minute in, I saw my shoulders shudder and me bend forward.

I was laughing.

I remembered that moment. My friend had told me a funny story about catching his older brother making out with his girlfriend while they were watching *Sophie’s Choice*. 

I wasn’t laughing about it anymore.

The video went on for a bit longer. Whoever was filming got a bit closer.

Then the video ended.

I didn’t tell my parents. I didn’t want a repeat of what happened last time. I tried asking my friends who had made the video. I was hoping it was just someone pulling a prank on me.

No one admitted to doing it.

I tried to go on with my life, but worrying about this on my own was almost worse than just fessing up and having my whole school hate me for it. Almost. For two whole weeks. I slept with a baseball bat in my bed and felt my heart race each time I felt my phone buzz. I never walked home alone, always making sure to have a friend or two around me. If they thought it was weird, they didn’t say anything.

Time passed. No more videos came. I started to forget again. I graduated, enrolled in college, and began living on my own. 

I had concluded that the video *was* a practical joke from my friends. That decision had dulled my anxiety and allowed me to actually live my life. More time passed, and I was so focused on school, I had no time to think about the videos. That was the past, and it was done.

But then the past came back.

When I was studying late one night at the library, I got another anonymous text message. It was another video. I told myself this couldn’t be the same person. I wasn’t even living in the same state anymore. But that same curiosity was there, that same lack of common sense. My thumb trembled with a mixture of fear and anticipation as I clicked the link.

The video started. It was me, in the library, studying.

Whoever took the video included the wall clock behind me. I had turned to confirm what time it was.

The video had been shot five minutes ago.

I had been alone for the past hour. Who could’ve shot the video?

I searched the area where I was studying from top to bottom. No one was there. I went over the room again. Then again. Three more times in total. Nothing. I looked for secret cameras, hidden phones. I almost considered taking out all the books from the bookshelves in case they had hidden their recording equipment there.

After a frantic hour, I took a deep breath, and tried to calm down.

This was what they wanted. They wanted to get a rise out of me. Wasn’t that the point?

I couldn’t give them the satisfaction.

I was going to ignore this. If I didn’t click on the videos, they’d get bored and move on to another person.

They didn’t move on.

I started getting videos every month. I had self-control at first, but my stupid curiosity would inevitably lead to me clicking on the link after it had sat in my inbox for a week or two. I tried blocking the number, but it never seemed to work. More videos kept coming. 

As more videos were sent to me, I realized just how odd they actually were. They were never incriminatory footage. Never looking in my window, or peeking in on me in the bathroom like you would expect from a stalker. It was just videos of me in public places. Shots of me walking to class or back to my apartment.

It made the videos feel less dangerous.

After a while, the video’s didn’t make me feel as uneasy as before. Nothing had happened, and most of the videos had been shot during the day. It stopped feeling like stalking. To be honest, the videos started to be…interesting to me. I had never been popular, or someone who was sought after. I was pretty average. The attention was kind of flattering. Someone was so obsessed with me, they felt the need to take time out of their day and film me. 

The videos made me feel like a celebrity, in a twisted sort of way.

Even with all these complicated feelings, I got better at saying no. I even made it a full two weeks without looking at any of the links I was sent.

Then, whoever was sending the videos began upping the ante.

I started getting videos every two weeks. Again, nothing perverted, just the same candid public shots.

I resisted more, and the frequency increased again.

Videos arrived every week like clockwork. 

Then every half week.

Then every day. 

Then multiple times a day.

There were so many videos. And even though I tried not to, I watched them all. Somewhere along the line, it became an obsession. I had to watch those videos. I had to see what whoever was sending them saw. I wasn’t even hesitating when the links came to me. I just clicked on them.

It began to feel normal to get them. The videos became almost *helpful*.

I had always been a little self-conscious, always worrying about what other people thought of me. With the videos, I could finally see what other people saw. 

I didn’t like what the videos showed me. I started to change things.

I changed how I swung my arms when I walked because in one video I thought it looked stupid. I changed the depth of my voice because in another video I thought my voice sounded high and nasally. I stopped wearing graphic t-shirts because in another video I could see some girls laughing at me.

I began to study the videos, watch them multiple times. I watched them so much, I began to dream of myself in the third person.

There was one video I received of a conversation I had with a friend. I watched it twelve times just to gauge my friend’s reaction to a joke. I wanted to judge if it was a real laugh, or just a pity laugh.

After that video, the uploader started recording more of my conversations. It was like they knew I needed more.

It was like scrolling on social media, except every post, every video was for me. It was all for my betterment, my perfecting.

I started to feel grateful to the uploader. I was becoming the person who I always wanted to be.

Then the first weird video came.

I received the link at lunch time. I was at Taco Bell, eating a chalupa. My phone buzzed, I saw the link, and clicked on it without hesitation. I was excited for the new upload.

The excitement turned to confusion.

It took me a moment to understand what I was seeing. Normally, the videos appeared only moments after they had been filmed. It was good that way, I could immediately critique my actions.

This video wasn’t filmed at lunch time. It had been filmed at night.

Video-me was looking away from the camera. I stood in front of an empty canal, staring off into the distance. No one was around me. The only illumination came from an orange street lamp off in the distance.

There were fifteen seconds of me just staring. Then the video cut.

It took me a moment to realize why it frightened me so much.

I didn’t remember being there last night.

I didn’t remember being there *any* night.

I searched my brain. Yesterday, I had been at home in the evening. Same with the day previous. Every night that week I hadn’t left my apartment from the hours of 6pm to 8am the next day.

I had been busy rewatching my videos.

I watched it again. Maybe this was months ago? Maybe I had taken a midnight walk and I hadn’t remembered it? I knew I was lying to myself. I never went on midnight walks. I loved my sleep. I was the kind of person who went to bed early and slept late.

It unsettled me, but an hour later, another video came. This one was normal. Me, in public, eating lunch. 

I relaxed. I wrote the weird video off a one-time thing. I forgot all about it and started watching my new video to figure out how to chew like a cool person.

Over the next few weeks, more weird videos showed up in my inbox.

These uploads always showed me in out-of-place locations at night. I didn’t recognize any of them. At first it was just train tracks, dark roads, forested areas. Then I started showing up in abandoned buildings and in people’s backyards. 

I never remembered doing any of those things.

The honeymoon phase was over. The videos were becoming frightening again. It was Russian roulette every time I clicked on a link. Would it be one I remembered? Or one I didn’t?

But I kept clicking. I had to have those videos.

I tried to solve the situation as best I could. I filmed myself at night to see if I was sleepwalking. I poured over hours of footage, but I never saw myself leave my apartment.

My grades started slipping. I felt tired all the time.

I got more and more weird videos of me being out and about at night.

Eventually, it became a fifty-fifty shot each time I clicked the link whether the video would be one that I remembered or one that I didn’t.

I kept pulling the trigger. I couldn’t stop.

I thought about telling people, but I was afraid. What would they think? How do you even begin to explain something like this? And how was I going to explain why I had let it go so long? I tried to justify the strange videos. Nothing wrong was happening, nothing illegal or bad. It was just videos of me at night. I told myself I was being paranoid about the whole thing.

It wasn’t hurting me. It wasn’t hurting anybody. That made it okay.

Right?

Then the last upload came.

It was at night. I was lying in bed trying to read a book for one of the many classes I was failing. The notification came onto my screen, and I felt a sudden drop in my stomach. I had never gotten one so late before. Not since the first video so many years ago.

It looked like every other text in the chain, but this one was strangely ominous. Something about it was…different. Off. I hovered over the link for a moment longer than usual.

A moment passed.

I pressed down with my thumb.

I was redirected to the private page. I saw the new video. It was an hour long.

I hesitated for a moment, then pressed the play button.

The video began with me standing in front of a house with its porch lights out. It was on a dark street in a suburban neighborhood. It took a moment, and then I recognized where I was.

It was my parent’s house.

On the video, I was still for a long time, just looking.

Then I walked towards the porch

It was surreal watching it. I hadn’t been home in months. Video-me reached under the doormat and pulled out the spare key. He unlocked the front door and walked inside. He closed the door behind him, throwing the room into darkness. His shadowy form went into the kitchen, and started to search the cupboards. I couldn’t tell what he was looking for. He was quiet, and thorough. Methodical.

He stopped searching, put some items I couldn’t see in his pockets, and then went upstairs. He skipped the creaky steps I knew to avoid when I was a teenager. My mouth went numb.

He stopped outside my parents room.

He silently opened their door and looked inside. On the video, I saw my parents sleeping. The camera zoomed in on them for a moment.

Video-me stared at them for a long time. I pleaded silently for them to wake up.

They continued to sleep.

Video-me left my parents, and went downstairs, avoiding the creaky step again. He entered the garage, and began rummaging around my dad’s tool bench.

He pulled out a full gas can, and set it on the bench.

From his pocket, he took a cup and some paper towels. The things he took from the kitchen.

He filled the cup with gas.

My stomach dropped as I saw Video-me soak some paper towels in the gas-filled cup and shove them into my family car’s gas tank. He poured a line of gas from the car to the living room. He then poured separate lines to the kitchen, up the stairs, to my room. Still pouring, he made another line to my parents room. Then he used the half-filled cup to douse my parents' door in gas.

He went downstairs again, still pouring. He made a line right out the front door, making sure to douse the welcome mat.

He left the gas in the entry-hallway, and exited the house.

I watched Video-me fumble with something in his pocket. I saw the spark, and the match light up.

For a moment, he stared at the house, then tossed the small flame onto the puddle of gas forming around the front door.

It only took a few minutes. Everything was on fire. The whole house burned bright, and smoke alarms began to scream out like tortured children. It might have just been my imagination, but I thought I heard my parents pleading over the roar of the flames for someone to save them.

The house burned for the rest of the video. No one escaped.

Video-me watched the whole thing unfold. In the video, I heard sirens in the distance.

Then the footage cut.

For a long time, I stared at the black ending screen. I tried to tell myself it was fake, to convince myself that it wasn’t me in the video. I would never hurt my parents, I would never burn down their home with them inside.

But it looked so real.

There was one comment underneath the video. There had never been comments before

I read it. It was one sentence:

“Thank you, my friend.”

I got that link three hours ago.

I’m hiding in the woods now. I won’t say where because I don’t want anyone to find me. Everyone has been trying to reach me. My old friends, my close relatives. 

It wasn’t a hoax. My parent’s house really burned down. 

No one survived.

It’s my fault. I don’t know how…but I was the one who did this. I know it.

I kept watching the videos. If I hadn’t, none of this would have happened.

But the worst part is I know if I got another link, I would only hesitate a little before clicking. Even now when I close my eyes, I can see the videos swirling around in my brain. Afterimages of me in the third person walking, talking…burning.

Don’t worry about finding my body. No one will discover me until I’m just a pile of bones. I hope that even then they don’t try to identify me. There’s a security that comes in anonymity. I won’t be remembered as the person that burned their parents to death. I’ll be some strange mystery, something unconnected and free.

That’s really all I want now. To be unobserved.

If you get a link from an unknown number…

Don’t risk it. You might like it too much.
