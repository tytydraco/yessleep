“  
"Bury me at the Grand Rosette"  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
I had always recognized that there was something fishy about the job. I had been skeptical about taking it until the hiring manager discussed compensation.  
  
“In addition to your generous base salary, you can expect to earn substantially more in tips. The Grand Rosette serves a very specific, very wealthy, very generous clientele, and even our most disliked managers have taken home at least fifty thousand dollars per month. Some have received much more. We don't put that in the job posting since we don't want to attract the wrong type of person, but suffice to say you will be very well compensated for any of the job's peculiarities.”  
  
The job certainly had peculiarities. For one, “manager” was my official job title, but I was effectively also the bellhop, concierge, housekeeper, chef, and receptionist - in fact, I was the only employee present in the hotel. The hiring manager had assured me that this wouldn't be too much to handle: there were rarely more than a few guests present at a time, and they wouldn't get fussy if I couldn't be overly attentive. For the most part, she was right.  
  
There was one major exception, as the previous manager informed me on the day I arrived at the hotel. "Yes, the guests won't be demanding, but if a guest does demand something of you, you have to accommodate them. Drop everything, if you have to. Even if the request seems silly, or if it requires you to ignore your normal hotel duties, you do it. That's the type of service that the generosity of the Rosette patrons buys." This struck me as being a little concerning, but I figured I could always just leave if a guest asked me to do something I wasn’t comfortable with.

It was for one of these special requests that I now found myself in the middle of the wilderness with Auntie Estelle.   
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
Estelle had been the first guest to check in after my arrival.   
  
She looked to be about fifty, in a way that suggested that she was probably at least sixty. She had a cackling laugh, and she loved to use it - she found my lame jokes hilarious, for some reason. It was just me and her in the hotel for a while, so we spent most of our evenings together; she appreciated the company, and I found her fascinating. She was the type of older figure who had a lot of life experience and wisdom to share, but was equally willing to listen and never presumed to know better than you. We would play cards while she regaled me with casual advice and tales from her past: hobbies learned and lost, ill-advised adventures, old lovers, and The Festival.  
  
A few of the peculiarities of the hotel seemingly had something to do with The Festival. As far as I could surmise, it was an event that was held at the Grand Rosette sometime in the past, maybe five, ten, or twenty years ago: the stories were never really clear. Every present-day hotel guest had attended The Festival, apparently, and most would mention it at least once in passing. "Don't ask about The Festival," the previous manager had advised me. "Smile and nod if a guest tells you about it, but don't ask follow-up questions or dwell too hard on it. Actually, try not to ask questions in general."  
  
Estelle mentioned The Festival often, but mostly in passing and never in much detail. For instance, she told me a story about going skydiving, and ended it by saying "that was the most exciting experience I've had since The Festival" - most of her references were like that. My best guess from context was that it was a Woodstock-type event with some sort of New Age spiritual component, but I had no strong evidence for that assumption. Again, I was asked not to inquire further, so I didn't.  
  
It was a month into her stay that Estelle asked me to call her Auntie Estelle. "I don't have any family left, hon, and you're a wonderful kid, so it'd mean a lot if I could leave a little of me behind with you." I was more than happy to oblige. She mentioned offhand the next month that I had been written into her will, which was a very touching bonus.   
  
Even as the months went by and other guests checked in and out, Auntie Estelle stuck around. She was a welcome constant, and I'm not sure if I could have handled the place without her. The hotel had... other peculiarities, that the previous manager and hiring manager had not informed me about. I could only attribute their negligence to willful malice - if I had known about this side of the job, it could have persuaded me not to take it.  
  
The first peculiarity was the hotel’s other visitors.   
  
As I mentioned, the hotel guests all had a few things in common: they were wealthy, polite, never made trouble, and had attended The Festival. However, they were not the only people on the property.  
  
My first encounter happened soon after I arrived. I was pruning the bushes by the pool deck, while Estelle sat on a lounge chair nearby. Something moved in my peripheral vision. I glanced towards the treeline. A person was standing there.   
  
For a few moments, I just watched. I didn’t know this person - his clothes were tattered, and his skin was as white as bone. He was staring at me, mouthing something. A strange dread crept up my back. My body shook, but otherwise I was frozen.   
  
Estelle broke me out of my trance. "Calm down, hon, it’s just a visitor. They’re not any danger, just keep your eye on ‘em, they’ll get a little riled up if your back is turned. If it’s gettin’ to you, just go inside. They’ll go away on their own."  
She shook her head solemnly. “Poor dears.”  
I kept staring, transfixed, until the man turned around and walked back into the trees.   
  
She brought up the event again at dinner.  
“Sorry about the visitor, hon. The last manager should have told you, but they never do. If you see anything else like that, I’m happy to help you, hon. Just don’t ask me about it. You can tell me about it, but never a question, mhm?”   
“And don’t ask me why that is, either.” She cackled a little at her own semi-joke.  
  
I saw a few more visitors after that. They all looked similar - gaunt faces, tattered clothing - but I don’t think I ever saw the same one twice. Estelle gave me a few more pieces of advice - some unprompted, some in response to strange events.  
  
“Don’t look towards that part of the forest for a while - it’s not dangerous, you just won’t like what you see,” when I noticed a stack of three boulders in the treeline - they were far too big to be moved manually and they hadn’t been there before.  
  
“Go to bed before midnight and have some herbal tea when you do,” when I started seeing faces in the trees.  
  
“That’s just a wild animal, hon,” when I mentioned the scratching I kept hearing on the outer walls.  
  
“If you hear tapping on the skylight, don’t look up.” She offered this unprompted, and it confused me a little - the hotel didn’t have a skylight, and I never heard any tapping.    
  
In general, none of the oddities seemed dangerous, they were just really, really off putting. With Estelle around, I was never too worried.

Now she was gone, and I was all alone.   
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
I already mentioned the rule about requests. If a guest made a request of me, I had to follow it. There were plenty of benign requests - bring me more towels, please clean the bathroom, et cetera - but frankly far fewer than you’d expect in a normal hotel. The big requests happened very infrequently - I think I received five in total, over my seven months of employment.  
  
The first one was from Rick, a middle-aged man whose most memorable characteristic was that he went for a jog at least twice a day. While I was sweeping the patio, he told me to dive into the pool and hold my breath for as long as I could. This sounded like the setup to a murder, but Rick had seemed trustworthy so far and Estelle was with us, so I figured I shouldn’t be in any danger.   
  
So I humored him and took a swan dive into the pool, staying under for as long as I could. After about a minute, I still didn’t have any strong urge to surface for air. After five minutes, the same thing. At ten minutes, I counted my fingers and pinched myself, confirming that I was awake and lucid. It seemed I was. I went through my multiplication tables in my head - no issues there, my brain wasn’t fuzzy. I definitely wasn’t breathing, and I felt a slight pressure in my lungs, which wasn’t comfortable, but I didn’t feel any panic. So I stayed there, as minutes blended into hours.   
  
I woke up to the sensation of my face clearing the water’s surface. I hadn’t realized I’d fallen asleep. It had been midday when I jumped into the pool, and now it was sunrise. Rick was still standing on the pool deck. “Good job, champ,” he said as he extended his hand, grabbing me and pulling me out. “I can’t fault you for surfacing while you were asleep. Couldn’t have done it better myself.”  
  
My mouth opened, about to ask him what just happened. His eyes sprung open, panicked. His hand shot up and clamped over my mouth. I swallowed my question and his expression softened to normal. “Sorry, champ, but it looked like you were about to ask me a question.”  
  
After the pool incident, the next three requests were equally as strange, but not particularly interesting to recount. The final one was different. It was from Estelle.  
  
“I’m going on a hike, hon. I need you to come with me.”  
  
That didn’t seem too strange, but the requests never seemed strange at first. I knew better than to ask questions, so I silently got up from my desk and trailed behind Estelle as she pushed through the front doors. I was still in my work clothes: a polo shirt, slacks, and shoes that were pretty comfortable for daily wear, but definitely didn’t have the kind of support you need for hiking. There was a slight chill in the air, so a jacket would have been nice, but not strictly necessary. Regardless, I wouldn’t have a chance to change into something more fitting.   
  
A silence hung in the air between us as we continued into the trees, punctuated only by the sound of our feet crunching through the orange and yellow leaves blanketing the forest floor. I’m tall and pretty fast, but I found myself walking at double time to keep pace.  
  
The hours came and went. The sun set. Our path began to ascend. More hours. The sun rose.   
  
We came to the crest of a rocky hill that might have been a mountain. For the first time since our departure, Estelle spoke. “Keep your eyes closed until you awaken. Don’t look up.”  
  
I shut my eyes obediently, and waited. I heard nothing, not even a footstep from Estelle or the sound of distant wildlife. Utter silence. I didn’t feel the sensation of falling asleep, but it happened quickly.  
  
I opened my eyes. Something was lying in front of me. Estelle.   
  
Her skin was ashen, her eyes fixed open. She wasn’t breathing.   
  
I went for my phone instinctively, punching in 9-1-1. No reception, of course. Nowhere out here at reception, not even the hotel.   
  
I shook her, hoping desperately that she was somehow just asleep. Nothing. I pressed my fingers to her neck. No pulse. I compressed her chest repeatedly. She was far too dead but I wasn’t thinking clearly. I’d never even learned CPR. Finally, I fell back against the ground, defeated. I was too shocked to even cry. Estelle was dead.  
  
And at the moment of my realization, Estelle’s lifeless head turned towards me. In a voice like a deathrattle, it spoke. “Bury me at the Grand Rosette.”  
  
I must have missed something. I checked again. The body was cold, unbreathing. Was I imagining things? I slapped myself. The shock numbed me, I barely felt it. I couldn’t even think. The mountain went dark for an instant, then bright again.  
  
Dark, then bright, like a cloud had passed over the sun. A moment passed. It happened again. Bright, dark a moment, bright. My mind couldn’t parse what was happening. The sun was wrong. I looked up.  
  
An eye. A great lidded eye. A pitch black pupil. Flaming yellow iris. Brilliant white sclera. It blinked. Dark. It opened. Bright.  
  
I fell to my knees; it seemed the only natural response. Again, the corpse beside me spoke. "You mustn't do that." The sound was death itself. It was barely audible, the rotted lungs could barely squeeze out enough air, the withered lips could barely articulate. Estelle had never led me wrong before, but whatever lay beside me might not have been her. Nonetheless, I pulled myself up, my legs quaking beneath me. I tore my gaze from the sky in agony, like duct tape from a wound.   
  
The corpse felt impossibly heavy as I slung it over my shoulder. Taking a step felt like a herculean task, and yet my feet kept moving. An hour passed, then two. I ceased being aware of the sensation of my legs moving. My mind went numb, and my eyesight faded, until the only thing remaining was the eye of the sun. I knew it would be watching me if I looked up. Not hateful, just watching. That was worse, somehow. Some of us believe in the existence of bigger things, but the mind isn’t meant to see them. Corpses shouldn’t speak. The sun shouldn’t blink.  
  
At some point, I became aware that the trees were moving. Not just the branches, and not swaying as in the wind - the trees in their entirety. The trunks lifted up, revealing not roots but single spikes beneath. They moved, then touched down somewhere else. Groups of trunks were moving together, in sync - neighboring trunks alternated moving up and down, and proceeded forward in a constant direction, like the legs of an insect. I looked up to where the branches of these trees knotted together, forming a collective organism. From each knot emerged a set of wooden mandibles.   
  
One of the creatures was watching me. No, all of them were. I turned back, and they were behind me too. I’d wandered right into the middle of them. I stood still as the nearest descended on me, clamping its jaws around the corpse on my shoulder. I considered yielding it.  
  
But no, I made a commitment. Things would surely get worse for me if I broke it.   
  
I lurched into a sprint, hoping the sudden burst of momentum could break the tree-creature’s grip. I heard a screech like wood dragging across wood behind me as the beast relinquished my burden. The creatures were all around me, but they were slow. I kept low and weaved between invading mandibles. I had some strength back now and the corpse felt lighter.  
  
A rumble rang out along the forest floor. I stumbled. The trees scattered. My mind strained again at the hideous impossibility of it - trees scattering.   
  
As the sun blinked, a shadow crept across the forest floor. The width was greater than the horizon. Something behind me was casting it. The air smelled like ozone. I didn’t dare look.   
  
The shadow eclipsed the horizon. I curled up in a ball and held my eyes shut - it was all I could do. Death would be better than seeing that thing. The tears finally caught up to me, and I sobbed. I cried for my mother and my father and lamented my birth in a world in which such things existed.   
  
Again, I awoke, unaware I had fallen asleep. The trees were back, but now they just watched, their mandibles tucked away.   
  
I slumped down against a log and took a moment to collect myself. The corpse was smiling now, its lips withered away. It was little more than a desiccated husk; it seemed too soon for that, but stranger things had happened. I stood up and collected the corpse. It seemed lighter now.   
  
I started seeing the visitors, with their tattered clothing and hideous paleness. I didn’t see them approach me, I just turned and they were there. I tripped, looked up, and one stood two feet in front of me. I maintained eye contact, as Estelle had suggested. I found that if I broke their line of sight by ducking behind a tree, they wouldn’t be there when I peeked back out. This mostly kept them at bay.  
  
I kept hearing footsteps behind me. I hoped it was the visitors.  
  
Eventually, the hotel came into view. It looked to be only a hundred yards away, but it took me hours to reach it.   
  
There was already a hole waiting for me in the rear yard - a round shaft, only a couple feet across. I took my final strained steps up to the edge and peered inside. The hole was impossibly deep. I couldn’t see the bottom. I could only imagine it led to Sheol itself.   
  
I considered the corpse on my shoulder. A farewell of some sort seemed to be in order, but no words came to mind. Instead, I let it down gently, sliding the decayed feet in first, then slowly pushing the rest into the opening. As the buttocks cleared the edge, gravity took hold, and the corpse slid out of my grip and into the abyss. After a moment, the opening closed - not in any natural manner, but like it was clenching shut.   
  
The light was different now. For the first time since I saw the sun, I looked into the sky. It was a mirror. Looking up, I saw a birdseye view of the hotel grounds, and myself staring up at me. And I saw other people, whom I recognized, singing and dancing. As I looked at myself, myself looked back, and suddenly I was falling, falling into the world in the sky, and I was among the others, and they were singing and dancing, and I joined them. You don’t need to know the rest.  
  
I followed the rules. I can only assume that Estelle condemned me, but I do not know if it is because she didn’t really care about me, or because it’s human nature to drag the ones we care about down with us. She left me two hundred million dollars in her will and I haven’t touched a cent of it. The other managers simply went home and forgot about this place, but I followed the rules and yet I have checked into this hotel every year and will continue to do so until I die. The sun has not stopped blinking.  
  
But you broke a rule.  
  
So yes, I used to work here. As I'm sure the previous manager told you, you really shouldn't have asked about it. Now I'll make a request of you, and as you know, you're not allowed to refuse. So here it is: leave. Don't pack a bag, just get in your car and go.   
"  
  
For the last month, I was the manager of the Grand Rosette. A traveler checked in, and I asked them a question that I was not supposed to. The prior excerpt was their response, which I have transcribed to the best of my ability. Now, I'm hoping someone can help me figure out what to do. I obeyed the traveler's request and went straight home, and now I've barricaded myself inside my apartment. I would normally chalk up all that nonsense about The Festival and the burial as a tall tale, but... the sun has been blinking at me.
