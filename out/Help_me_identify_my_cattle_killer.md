Hi everyone. I'm new to the whole reddit thing but I thought I might as well give it a try. I need help. I need someone to give me somw form of understanding. Recently I've earned a job at a local ranch. I work as a cowboy in just about every sense. From boots to my hat to my jeans and revolver on my hip. Even ride a horse but that bastard hates me so I do my best to avoid her. Still I do my job to the fullest. I used to break broncos and tag heads of cattle but recently I've been moved to the position of a night watcher.

To begin, I figured working as a cattle rustler or cow puncher would be like the Marty Robbins songs. You know, nightly songs around the campfire, thinking of the girl you left behind, being honest and courageous to anything. Most of it is wrong. Most of my time, as of recent, is in solidarity and silence. The breaks of the nothingness being few and far between. 

The western wasteland managed to whisperer to you in the languages of cattle moos, bird song, cicada cries and howling wind. The days showed how vast and empty the land was while the nights showed that same world coated in inky black and growing darkness which fought against the glow of my battery powered lanterns.

I guess Marty was also right about them.The nights are often cold and they are bitter, more so than heartbreak but recently they've become terrifying. I was always warned about being a night watcher. The job was how it sounded. I would stay up and watch the cattle while they roamed the fields, making sure that no predator could reach them. Its boring. Beyond a doubt it is boring. Yet before I really started, the old men would warn about all manner of things and tell the tallest of stories. I figured it was for people like me. Meant to scare greenhorns. I should have listened better.

The first few nights were just cold and boring and long. You'd hear the coyotes or the trample of deer but that was. On my sixth night however there was something else. The night started as it always does. Me, my rifle, and my horse riding out to watch the herd, roughly two hundred head. The sun set, the lanterns were on, my words lost as my ears listened to the whimpers of the land. Unlike the nights before there was no chatter. No bugs whining, no birds flying, no packs of coyotes, not even a moo from the cows. 

It was an uncanny silence and it lasted so long that I thought myself deaf or crazy or something. I began to humm, something to break the empty. But I stopped once I heard the thunder of feet or paws. I readied myself, standing tall but it was gone again.

It was charging a moment ago, no sound of it slowing. It was just a dead sprint turned off as if muted. I jumped toward what I thought was the original source, my rifle pointed at the dark which fought with my flashlight but I saw nothing. I flashed the beam of light, looking toward the cattle and my horse and my camp, all was in order as it should be. In fact none of the animals seemed spooked. None bothered. I thought the night had gotten to me, the silence making me hear things, my eyes seeing something in the dark but nothing was there. I sat back down, sitting silence just in case.

The charge came back, that same heartbeat like thunder of hooves. I jumped and flashed my beam of light alongside my rifle. I tried to find whatever was doing this and instead all I found was that my horse was gone. That was the answer, it must have been her charging around. I walked toward where I had placed her, wondering if she had ran too far away, wondering if I could catch her.

My saddle was on the ground, the reins resting on the dirt covered in blood, splotches of red everywhere, painting the land as though it were a canvas. The blood would lead anyone to think a violent act, a slaughter for the amount yet my saddle was fine, the leather stained but intact. I was mortified and confused. My eyes landing on the only clue I had. It was a paw print. Looked like that of a dog but ten times bigger and bearing a sixth toe and sixth claw. 

I looked at the print, my size eleven boot dwarfed by it. My stomach sank and it felt as though if vomit, my finger rested on my rifles trigger a little harder. I slowly backed away, feeling as though I was beeing watched but I had no real clue if I was.

I searched through my bag and fished out my radio, using it to call the big house but no reply came. I remember cursing before that charge sounded out again. I dropped the radio, stepping on it by accident as I readied myself, as I took aim where I assumed this beast to be. It sounded further away than it had before, so distant yet drawing closer and closer.

I didn't know what to do, didn't have a clue so I fired. Thought it my only option. Maybe the sound would scare it or something. My bullet ripped throigh the air and struck that darkness. No whimper called out but the charge ended. The thunderous steps stopping.

My flashlight once again danced forward with its blinding cone of white light. My camp still there, my stuff untouched but another paw was found, this one planted a foot from me. Then I turned my attention toward the herd of cattle. There was no herd anymore. Just a stream of trickling blood. A graveyard marked only by the juts of bone. Spires made of split ribs. 

I panicked. I thought my fear would petrify me but instead I just ran forward at full speed. My rifle fell, so did my flashlight. My feet trampled flowers and grass, it snapped twigs or maybe more bone fragments, I couldn't tell. I ran and ran till I got back to the big house. The building was a lively log cabin but now it was shattered. Logs were ripped apart by claws, blood splattered over windows, the light of a lamp trying to push through. All my coworkers, all of them were dead.

I reached into my pocket to get my phone out. I called the police to report everything. I knew they wouldn't believe me. I knew they'd call me crazy. As I was on the phone with the operator, I saw the beast. A flicker of it. I saw blackened skin that shined like a crystal, I saw six legs and enough eyes to make a spider jealous. It was the size of a pick up truck, muscled all over. It was on the roof of rhe big house. Standing on the roof as if lording over the ranch. It lept away, the charge calling out as it ran further and further from the approaching sirens.

That's my recollection of events. It's what I saw and what I remember. I tried to explain it to people I knew. I tried to help universities understand but there isn't anyone. There's no expert, no religious connection. There's nothing and I feel like nothing. Maybe you guys can help me out. Maybe you can explain it. Maybe I can finally be told that I'm just crazy. I don't know. I need something other than nothing.
