This isn't easy to talk about. Not after everything. Most days, I still can’t. My hands shake so much I can barely hold this pen, and my mind… it’s a spiderweb of shadows and whispers. But the doctor, the one who actually seems to believe me – or at least, pretends to – says writing it down might help. That maybe, if I can put it into words, I can finally untangle the knots in my head.

They call it PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I call it living in a permanent nightmare, a reality stretched and torn until it barely resembles the one I knew.

Before… before it all started, my life was good. Not just good, it was perfect. I had Sarah. Her name was Sarah. Just writing it down makes my throat tighten. She was everything. Her laugh, bright and clear like wind chimes. Her eyes, the color of warm honey, always crinkling at the corners when she smiled. The way she’d hum while cooking, or tuck her feet under her on the sofa, a book resting open on her chest. We lived in a small, two-story house, tucked away on a quiet street in the suburbs. A little slice of heaven, we called it. We’d bought it together, painted the walls, planted a garden. It was our sanctuary.

It was our coffin.

It began subtly. So subtly that for weeks, I dismissed it. Attributed it to stress, to my imagination, to the house settling. A faint smell, at first. Like damp earth, or maybe something a little sweeter, but cloying. I’d sniff the air, wander through the rooms, checking for leaks, for forgotten food. Sarah would laugh, say I was being paranoid. "It's just the old house, Liam," she'd say, her voice warm, familiar. "Breathing."

Then came the sounds. Rustles from empty corners. A faint scratching, like nails on plaster, deep within the walls, usually when the house was quietest – late at night, or early in the morning before the world woke up. Sometimes, I’d swear I heard a soft, wet squelch. I’d freeze, heart hammering, straining to hear it again. But it would be gone. Just the creak of the floorboards, the distant hum of the refrigerator.

Sarah didn't seem to notice. Or if she did, she didn’t mention it. She’d sleep soundly beside me, her breathing even, undisturbed. And I, being the rational man I thought I was, tried to be like her. To ignore the growing prickle on my skin, the sense of being watched even in our own bedroom.

The first noticeable change came with the air. It grew colder. Not just a draft – a pervasive, bone-chilling cold that seemed to emanate from the very walls. I checked the heating, sealed windows, but it didn't help. Sarah started bundling up, wearing extra sweaters, but still, she dismissed my concerns. "It's just winter coming, Liam. You're getting soft," she'd joke, but her smiles seemed a little… thinner. A little less genuine.

I told myself it was my imagination. I told myself I was tired. I told myself I was being ridiculous. I told myself a lot of things. And every single one of them was a lie I desperately needed to believe.

The house began to feel… wrong. Not just the cold, not just the smells or the phantom noises. It was a subtle shift in its very essence. The shadows seemed deeper, more alive. The natural sunlight, which used to pour in through our kitchen window, felt muted, filtered through something unseen. The wallpaper in the hallway, a soft floral pattern Sarah had picked out, seemed to warp just at the edges when I wasn't looking directly at it.

And Sarah… she started to change too.

It wasn't overnight. It was a creeping, insidious alteration. Little things, at first, that I wrote off as stress or fatigue. She’d always been a morning person, chirpy and bright. Now, she lingered in bed, often not stirring until I nudged her. Her movements, once graceful and fluid, became… precise. A little too precise. Like she was thinking about each step, each gesture.

I remember one morning, she was making coffee. She always used to hum a little tune while she ground the beans. That morning, she stood perfectly still, her back to me, the grinder whirring. Her shoulders were hunched, and for a split second, I saw a strange, almost convulsive twitch in her left arm, quickly suppressed. When she turned, her smile was there, but her eyes… her eyes were flat. Like the light in them had dimmed.

"Everything alright, love?" I asked, a knot forming in my stomach.

"Perfectly fine, Liam," she said, her voice a little too even, a little too saccharine. "Just thinking."

But what was she thinking about? She never elaborated. She used to share everything with me. Every thought, every worry, every silly dream. Now, there was a wall. An invisible, impenetrable barrier.

Her habits shifted too. She stopped reading her paperback novels, something she used to do every night. Instead, she’d sit in the living room, often in the dark, just staring at the television, which wasn't even on. I’d walk in, and she’d jump, startled, then offer that same unnerving, flat smile.

"Just resting my eyes," she'd say. "Long day."

But her days weren't long. She didn't work. She was supposed to be designing our new garden layout, filling her time with things she loved. But the garden remained untouched, slowly becoming overgrown.

The smell intensified. That earthy, sickly sweet scent, a mix of damp soil and something else… something organic and decaying. It clung to Sarah. I’d try to hold her close, to smell her familiar scent – her shampoo, her perfume, her unique skin musk – but it was always there, underneath it all, that terrible, cloying odor. It made my stomach churn.

"Are you feeling okay, Sarah?" I asked one evening, trying to sound casual as she sat across from me at dinner, barely touching her food.

She looked up, her spoon halfway to her mouth. Her eyes were wide, unblinking. "Why, Liam? Do I not look okay?"

Her tone was unsettling. Defensive, almost aggressive. And for a moment, just a flicker, her face seemed to contort. The muscles in her jaw tightened, her lips pulled back too far, revealing a flash of teeth that seemed too long, too pointed. Then it was gone, replaced by a perfect, bland expression.

"You just seem a little… quiet," I stammered, my heart thumping against my ribs.

"People change, Liam. Don't they?" she said, and then she went back to pushing the food around on her plate.

I couldn’t eat. My appetite had vanished days ago. I started losing weight. Sleeping became a luxury I couldn't afford, perpetually on edge, listening to the house, listening to Sarah. I found myself watching her, scrutinizing every move, every blink, every breath. And the more I watched, the more I saw.

The way her fingers would sometimes clench, almost convulsively, when she thought I wasn't looking. The subtle, almost imperceptible tremor in her right hand as she held her coffee cup. The way her eyes would occasionally drift, focusing on something far beyond the walls, a look of chilling vacancy replacing the familiar warmth.

And then, I found it. In the utility closet, tucked behind some old paint cans. A small, dark, viscous puddle. It smelled of that same sickly-sweet earth, but stronger, more pungent. I touched it with my finger. It was thick, gelatinous, and left a faint, disturbing stickiness. I wiped my finger on an old rag, but the smell clung to me. I scrubbed my hand raw, but I could still feel it, deep under my skin.

I tried to talk to her about it. "Sarah," I said, holding the rag, "what is this?"

She barely glanced up from the blank TV screen. "What's what, Liam?"

"This," I insisted, bringing the rag closer. "This… goo. From the closet."

She finally turned, her stare unnervingly direct. Her lips curved into that thin, unsettling smile. "Oh, that. Just a bit of damp, I suppose. The pipes are old."

"It's not damp, Sarah. It feels… organic."

Her smile widened, her eyes fixed on mine. "Organic? Silly, Liam. It's just water. Or maybe… maybe something from the garden, tracking in."

But she hadn't been in the garden in weeks. Never mind the garden. She hadn't been herself in weeks.

My mind raced. Was she sick? Was it a breakdown? But the way she looked at me… it wasn't Sarah. It was something else. Something pretending to be her.

The terror, cold and sharp, began to truly sink its teeth into me.
