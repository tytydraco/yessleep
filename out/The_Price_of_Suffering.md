The road to the cabin was older than I was.

A narrow strip of dirt, carved between towering pines, the kind of road that never stayed tame. Every year, Dad would clear the worst of the overgrowth, smooth out the deeper ruts, and scatter fresh gravel where he could—but the forest always took it back. The woods had a way of reclaiming what belonged to them. Now, with him gone, it felt like we were trespassing.

“You sure this is the right way?” Ryan asked, peering through the windshield.

The trees pressed in close, their skeletal limbs arching over the road like fingers reaching for something just out of grasp. The truck’s headlights carved out brief tunnels of visibility before the darkness swallowed everything whole again.

“Yeah,” I said. “It just looks different.”

Ryan exhaled through his nose, shifting in his seat. "Dad used to say you could blindfold him, drop him anywhere in these woods, and he'd still find his way back to the cabin."

I didn’t answer.

I’d heard that a hundred times, usually from Dad himself, grinning over a campfire. You could walk these woods in the dark if you knew them well enough. Sometimes the stories changed—sometimes it was Grandpa who built the place, sometimes it was his father before him—but the core remained. This land had been in our family for generations. Dad had grown up here. His father before him.

And yet, for the first time in my life, I struggled to recognize the road.

The woods felt different this year.

Thicker.

Hungrier.

I tightened my grip on the wheel. The forest didn’t change. People did.

The truck jolted as we hit a deep pothole, and Ryan cursed, bracing himself against the door. “Jesus, man. Suspension’s not that good.”

“You could always walk.”

“Funny.” He glanced at his phone, but the screen showed nothing but a spinning wheel of failure. No signal. “This place is a black hole.”

I let out a dry chuckle. “You act like this is new.”

Ryan had always been different from me—the type to complain about no Wi-Fi and keep the outdoors at arm’s length. He wasn’t a bad hunter—he could shoot just fine—but he’d never loved the woods the way Dad had. The way I did.

He adjusted his ball cap, frowning at the dark tree line. “I don’t remember it getting dark this early.”

“It’s the cloud cover,” I said. The sky had been gray since noon, thick with the promise of rain. It should have bothered me more than it did. The world felt dimmer out here as if the sun didn’t touch this place the same way it touched everywhere else.

The last bend in the road came up fast, revealing the cabin as we cleared the trees. A dark silhouette nestled in the clearing, untouched by time. The porch sagged a little more than I remembered, but otherwise, it was exactly as Dad had left it.

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. “We’re here.”

Ryan made a face. “Cozy.”

I ignored him, throwing the truck into park and stepping onto the gravel drive. The air hit me first—cool and damp, laced with the familiar scent of wet leaves and pine. The ground was soft, with fallen foliage and dead leaves crunching underfoot as I approached the porch.

Ryan lingered by the truck, stuffing his hands into his jacket pockets. “You ever think about selling it?”

I stopped at the bottom of the steps. “No.”

He hesitated. “Mom mentioned it.”

I turned to look at him, my jaw tightening. “I said no.”

Ryan sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. “Alright, man. Forget I asked.”

I exhaled slowly, pushing the door open. The hinges groaned, the air inside thick with dust and the ghosts of old campfires.

It smelled like home.

Ryan flicked on a flashlight, the beam cutting across the room. Everything was just as we’d left it last winter—hunting rifles mounted over the stone fireplace, old maps pinned to the walls, the couch covered in a faded quilt Mom had sewn years ago. The woodstove sat cold in the corner, logs stacked neatly beside it, waiting for hands that hadn’t returned.

“Feels weird without him, huh?” Ryan said, softer this time.

I swallowed against the tightness in my throat. “Yeah.”

Silence settled between us, heavy and unspoken.

Ryan exhaled, rubbing his hands together. “Alright, I say we drink in honor of the old man. Then we start the fire before we freeze to death.”

I managed a half-smile. “Sounds like a plan.”



We built the fire outside like we always had.

The wood burned low, glowing embers casting flickering shadows over the clearing. The whiskey was cheap, but it burned just fine, warming us from the inside out as we passed the bottle between us.

“You hear that?” Ryan asked suddenly.

I frowned. “What?”

Ryan cocked his head, listening. “Nothing.”

I realized he was right. The forest had gone silent.

No crickets. No rustling in the brush. No distant hoot of an owl. Just the fire and our own breathing.

The hair on the back of my neck stood on end.

Then, from deep in the woods, something howled.

It wasn’t a wolf.

It wasn’t a coyote.

It was deeper. Resonant.

Ryan tensed. “That’s not normal.”

I licked my lips, watching the tree line. The sound was distant, almost distorted as if coming from somewhere much farther away—but reaching us all the same.

Then, just as suddenly, the fire dimmed.

Not from the wind. Not from anything natural.

The flames shrank, flickered, and then guttered low as if something unseen was pressing against them.

Ryan’s hand went to the knife at his belt. “Luke…”

Then, the woods exhaled.

The sound returned all at once—the rustling of leaves, the whisper of the trees, the distant chirp of crickets. The fire surged back to life, crackling bright and whole again.

Like nothing had happened.

Ryan let out a slow breath. “You wanna tell me what the hell that was?”

I stared at the darkened forest, my jaw tight.

Somewhere out there, something had been watching.

I could feel it.

I just didn’t know what.

-----------------------------------------------

The woods were different in the morning.

They always were.

Last night’s fire had burned down to a pile of pale ash, the empty whiskey bottle beside it. The trees, which had felt vast and unknowable in the dark, now stretched upward like ancient pillars, their canopies breaking apart the gray sky above.

I stood on the porch, rifle slung over my shoulder, breathing in the crisp morning air. Everything smelled damp—earthy, fresh, but oddly still. The kind of silence that felt placed rather than natural.

Behind me, Ryan shuffled out of the cabin, rubbing sleep from his eyes. “Coffee?”

I held up my thermos. “Already made.”

He groaned. “You’re a menace.”

I smirked, taking a sip. “You’re slow.”

He grumbled something under his breath, then flopped onto one of the porch chairs, staring out at the tree line. “We heading out soon?”

“Yeah. Figured we’d set up by the creek. Always good tracking there.”

Ryan exhaled, rubbing a hand over his face. “Man, I still can’t stop thinking about last night. That… sound.”

I stayed quiet.

“It didn’t sound like a coyote,” he said, glancing at me. “Or a wolf.”

“No.”

Ryan frowned. “Then what?”

I took another sip of coffee. “Dunno.”

That was a lie. I did know. Or at least, I had an idea.

Something had been out there last night. Something that had watched us from the trees pressed itself against the edges of the firelight, just beyond where we could see. I’d felt it. That awful, dragging weight in my gut.

But I wasn’t about to say that to Ryan.

He pushed himself up, stretching. “Alright, let’s get going before I change my mind.”



The forest was quiet.

Not in the way it should’ve been.

No rustling leaves. No squirrels darting through the underbrush. No birds calling overhead. Just the sound of our boots pressing into damp earth and the soft, distant murmur of the creek.

Ryan noticed it, too. He kept glancing up, brows furrowed, like he expected something to move between the trees.

“Feels dead,” he muttered.

I nodded. “Too quiet.”

It wasn’t normal. Even in colder months, the forest had life. But here, now? It was like everything had left. Or worse—like it had been driven away.

We walked on, rifles in hand, eyes scanning the trees. A thin mist curled between the trunks, soft, almost lazy. It wasn’t unusual for the mornings to be foggy this time of year, but it felt… off.

Too still. Too heavy.

Then I saw it.

A deer stood just beyond the clearing ahead. A buck, tall and unmoving, its body partially hidden in the fog.

Something about it made my stomach turn.

Ryan stopped beside me. “You see that?”

“Yeah.”

The buck didn’t move.

Its antlers curled high above its head, but they looked wrong. Jagged. Almost too thick for its skull.

I lifted my rifle, peering through the scope.

Then my breath hitched.

Its throat was slit.

Not fresh—dark, dried blood matted its fur, a gaping wound stretching from ear to chest.

But the deer was still standing.

I dropped the rifle, blinking hard.

Gone.

The clearing was empty.

I sucked in a slow breath. “Did you—?”

Ryan shook his head. “I don’t wanna talk about it.”



By mid-afternoon, the mist hadn’t lifted.

It should’ve. The sun had been up for hours, but the fog clung to the trees, curling around their trunks like something living.

Ryan had gone quiet. He kept his rifle close, eyes flicking between the trees like he expected something to jump out. I didn’t blame him.

Neither of us had spoken about the deer that wasn’t there.

We were headed back to the cabin when we heard it.

A horn.

Deep. Resonant.

A single, drawn-out note carried through the mist.

I stopped in my tracks. My breath caught in my throat.

Ryan turned to me, eyes wide. “That… wasn’t real. Right?”

I didn’t answer.

The sound had come from deep in the woods. Too far for a hunter. Too old to be from anything modern.

Then, from somewhere much closer, the hounds began to bay.



We ran.

Not in a panicked sprint—but fast enough to get out.

The cabin wasn’t far. If we kept moving, we’d be fine. We just had to—

Ryan wasn’t there.

I skidded to a stop, breath coming fast. The mist had thickened. I turned in a circle.

“Ryan?”

Nothing.

My pulse hammered.

“Ryan!”

The trees loomed, their dark forms swallowed by the fog. The forest held its breath.

Then, just ahead, I saw him.

A figure, standing partially hidden between the trees.

I exhaled hard, moving toward him. “Jesus, Ryan, don’t—”

I stopped.

It wasn’t him.

The figure was too tall, too broad. Wrapped in old hunting leathers, shadowed under a hood.

He didn’t move.

I swallowed hard, gripping my rifle.

The Huntsman.

He stood still as death, watching.

The hounds were close now. Their howls wove through the trees, circling, tightening.

The Huntsman raised a hand.

He pointed.

Straight at me.

My breath turned shallow. My legs refused to move.

Then, from behind me—

“Luke.”

Ryan’s voice.

I turned. He stood there, breathless, wide-eyed. “We need to go.”

I turned back toward the clearing.

Empty.

The Huntsman was gone.



We didn’t talk on the way back.

When we finally reached the porch, Ryan turned to me. His face was pale.

“What the hell was that?”

I shook my head, trying to steady my breathing. “I don’t know.”

Ryan’s jaw tightened. He turned, staring out at the trees. The mist was fading now.

The hunt was over.

For now.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. But deep in my gut, I knew—

A locked door wouldn’t stop him.

-----------------------------------------------

The wind shifted.

I felt it before I heard anything—the air growing heavier, pressing against my skin like something tangible. The trees, so silent before, seemed to hold their breath.

Ryan stood beside me on the porch, his jaw clenched. “He’s coming.”

I swallowed, fingers tightening around my rifle.

We both knew.

The fire had burned out, but I still smelled smoke, charred wood, and something more profound—earthy, like damp fur and rot.

The Huntsman was near.

Ryan exhaled, shoulders stiff. “Do you think—”

The sound cut him off.

A hunting horn, deep and ancient, echoed through the trees.

The baying followed, rolling through the mist in waves.

The hounds had found their prey.

Ryan turned to me. His voice was low. Resigned. “You should go inside.”

I shook my head. “No.”

His face was pale, but he gave me a weak smile. “Didn’t think you would.”

The mist swallowed the tree line, curling toward the cabin like fingers reaching through the dark.

And then—they stepped through.

First, the hounds.

They weren’t dogs. Not really. Their bodies were too lean, too long, their movements too fluid, too human. Their eyes—they weren’t animal eyes.

I sucked in a breath.

They were human eyes.

One hound had a scar running down its throat like it had been slit. Another was missing an eye, the socket raw and red.

The realization settled, thick and awful.

These weren’t just hounds.

They were past souls.

Hunters. Men. People who had been judged.

Ryan stared at them, breath shallow. “Jesus.”

And then, the Huntsman stepped forward.



He loomed over us, broad and impossibly still. His leathers were worn, stitched together from things that had never belonged to man. His hood was low, shadowing his face.

But then he lifted his head.

My breath caught.

His face was withered, mummified, like something long dead and preserved in the cold. His features were sunken, lips curled back over blackened teeth.

When he exhaled, his breath met the cold air, curling in wisps of steam.

The sound wasn’t human.

It was like the forest itself was breathing.

My hands shook.

Ryan was staring. Not in fear—in understanding.

The Huntsman raised a gloved hand.

And he pointed to Ryan.



Ryan let out a shaky breath. “I get it now.”

I turned to him, my pulse hammering. “What?”

He didn’t look at me. His gaze was locked on the Huntsman. On the hound with the slit throat.

Ryan’s voice was hoarse. “It’s because of the deer.”

My blood ran cold.

“The one we saw,” he whispered. “The one that wasn’t there.”

I shook my head. “Ryan, what are you talking about?”

He finally looked at me, his expression unreadable.

“Dad and I went hunting when I was younger,” he said. His voice was distant like he was watching the memory play out. “We shot a deer, but it didn’t die right away. It was suffering. I—I didn’t know what to do, so I slit its throat.”

His breath hitched. “But it didn’t die right away. It still struggled. It still suffered.”

I felt sick.

Ryan exhaled. “This is my judgment, Luke. I—”

The hounds shifted. The Huntsman stepped forward.

Ryan’s voice cracked. “I think I have to go.”



“No.” My voice came out raw. “No, we can fix this. We can—”

I turned to the Huntsman. “Take me instead.”

The Huntsman didn’t move.

I clenched my fists. “You hear me? Take me instead!”

Still, he said nothing.

Because he didn’t have to.

This had never been a negotiation.

The horn blew again.

Ryan stepped forward. His hands were shaking, but he kept his head high. “It’s okay, Luke.”

“No,” I choked.

He gave me a small, sad smile. “You were always the better hunter anyway.”

I watched, helpless, as he crossed the threshold into the mist.

The hounds closed in.

And then, he was gone.



I stood there for a long time.

The forest felt empty now.

The Huntsman had vanished, his hounds with him. The trees stood silent and unyielding. The air was still.

Ryan was gone.

Forever.

I turned, walking back inside the cabin. My hands were cold. My chest was empty.

The rifle sat against the wall.

Waiting.

I stared at it for a long time.

And then I took it, stepped back outside, and walked into the trees.



The forest was dark.

The mist had begun to roll back in, swirling between the trees. I moved forward, slow and steady.

And then I saw it.

A deer stood ahead of me. A buck, tall and unmoving, its body partially hidden in the fog.

It didn’t run.

It watched me.

I lifted the rifle and aimed. My hands didn’t shake.

I fired.

The deer staggered, but it didn’t fall. Blood darkened its side, but it was still standing.

I let the rifle lower.

The wound would kill it, eventually. It would suffer first. And that was enough.

A shape moved at the edge of the trees.

A hound stepped into view.

It didn’t move.

I exhaled, my breath curling in the cold air.

I knew what it was.

I knew who it was.

Ryan.

He watched me, silent, waiting.

I closed my eyes.

I was always his big brother.

It was my job to protect him.

And since I couldn’t…

I would suffer with him.
