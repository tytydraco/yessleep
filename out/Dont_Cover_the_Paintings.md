I’m sitting on the cold tile of my dead aunt’s bathroom floor, writing this—
hoping I’m just losing my mind.

I guess I should start at the beginning.

It all began when I got that damned letter.

I had just come home to the apartment I share with two people I barely know. Rent’s too high to live alone, and splitting it three ways sounded better than sleeping in my car. It’s small—three bedrooms, one bath—but it’s home.

Then one day, a letter showed up in the mail.
From someone named Aunt Ophelia.

The problem? I didn’t have an Aunt Ophelia.

The letter said:

> “Dear Zane,
If you’re reading this, I’m dead. Don’t fret, we didn’t know each other well—I only met you when you were a baby, maybe five times.
I have no one else close to me, and I don’t think anyone really deserves my house. But you… you might. So I leave it to you.
Just remember—don’t be greedy or hateful in the house. It doesn’t like that.
And cherish it, because if you don’t, it might not like you.
Hugs and kisses.
Oh, almost forgot: don’t ruin the paintings. And don’t cover them. They don’t like that.”



Creepy, right?
But hey—free house. Who am I to say no?

I arrived just after nightfall. It looked… normal. Not creepy or haunted, just old.
I was exhausted from the drive, so I figured I’d do a quick walkthrough before bed.

The house was still fully furnished—dusty but livable. A leaky ceiling, faded wallpaper, and too many paintings.
They were everywhere.

One caught my eye in particular—right above the bed in the upstairs room. Weird place for a painting, but whatever. It showed a man who looked like an old-fashioned barber. White shirt, white pants, a cape tied around his neck like he was ready for surgery. In his hand—scissors. Next to him, a barber pole.

Something about his eyes unsettled me, but I shrugged it off. Aunt Ophelia had warned me about the paintings, but I figured she was just… eccentric.

I brushed my teeth, came back to the bedroom—
and swore his eyes had moved.

Maybe I was just tired from the five-hour drive. I wasn’t about to get freaked out by oil paint.

Still, I decided to grab a thin white sheet from the couch downstairs and toss it over the painting.
And as I did, her words echoed in my head:
“Don’t cover them.”

I laughed nervously. “Sorry, Aunt Ophelia,” I muttered. “You’re dead. You don’t get a say.”

Then I went to sleep.

Sometime in the night, I felt something tugging gently at my hair.
Half-dreaming, I brushed at it—
and then I heard it.

Snip.
Snip.

My eyes shot open.

The barber was standing beside the bed.
Holding a lock of my hair in his pale fingers.
His smile stretched ear to ear, eyes wide and gleaming.

I screamed—bolted upright, grabbed my phone, and ran. I didn’t know the house, so I burst through the first door I could find—
a closet.

Fine. I’d take a closet. A door was a door.

I tried calling 911, but of course—no signal.
And what would I even say?
“A man came out of a painting and started cutting my hair while I slept”?

Yeah. They’d lock me up.

Then I heard it again.
Breathing.
Right behind me.

Snip.
Snip.
Snip.

I ran.
Straight out of the closet and into the bathroom.
Locked the door.
Turned on every light.

No paintings. Thank God.

I don’t know what to do.
I’m writing this, hoping someone—

Snip.
Snip.
Snip.
