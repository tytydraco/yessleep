I was somewhere between towns on a road where the dark felt thicker than the air itself. There was a flickering neon sign I could catch in the distance, something that looked like it belonged to a gas station. My bladder was screaming and I needed something to eat, so I pulled in.

I pumped in some gas, more than what was enough to keep me going where I was headed. The smell was a bit off, and it felt like it was of genuinely bad quality. Once I was done with my ride, I approached the store. 

Through the glass, I saw a man in a faded, almost torn denim jacket and jeans with a pair of dirty muddied white sport shoes. He had long blond, almost discolored hair like a bad wig.

I got inside the store, moving away from the desk. My guts told me to avoid it at all costs as long as that man was there.

I turned far into an aisle to avoid any interaction with him.

In a rasp, ugly voice he screamed - grabbing the cashier by the collar: *"Where's my cut for the week? Where is it!??"*, he grunted. The cashier mumbled something under his breath shakily.

Not satisfied by the answer, the man slapped the cashier on his face. *"You're giving me more excuses to blow your brains out"* he chuckled, pushing the latter away, making him fall to the floor like he was dead.

I tried to ignore the guy, but his eyes met mine in a disgusting, almost abrasive smirk. His patchy beard and yellow teeth with bloodied gums and a face of a husk gave him a really predatory look. I looked away, trying to distract myself by picking a few snacks for the road.

I heard the store door close, feeling slightly relieved that the guy was gone. After buying myself some chips and bottles of water just enough to keep me awake for the night, I decided to **'check-out'**. 

The cashier was unresponsive, slumped to the ground. I paid for what I took, and some extra cash I could afford to give (out of pity) for the 'cut' (whatever it was) in case that man was back again.

There wasn't a restroom attached to the store. It was in a shed close-by. Dumping the food in my car, I set off to use the urinal.   
  
The restroom inside was dimly lit, with just a lone cracked lightbulb above the dirty porcelain sinks.

Graffiti on the wall, feces and urine on the floor.

Also, a distinct, deathly smell. Like burning cigarettes mixed with rotting flesh. The restroom was very dirty. I didn't even dare to enter any of the stalls thanks to my past experience with gas station restrooms.

As I went on with my urinal business, I felt like I was being watched from one dark corner. I didn't turn around. Didn't want to.

Just as I was done, the feeling creeped to my chest. I turned... and then I saw him. 

That junkie with a pipe in his hands. Before I could even register the sinister smirk on his face, he lunged at me with uncanny speed, slamming the pipe to my head. I fell to the ground, vision blurring as I lay on the dirty floor.

My skull throbbed as a dark curtain took over my eyes. The world tilted in and out of focus as he dragged me across the floor. 

My shoes scraped against the tile, then what sounded like hollow concrete. He yanked open one of the stall doors, and instead of a toilet there was a stairwell - crude and unfinished.

I tried to protest, but all that came out was a slurred groan. He chuckled, *"You're not going anywhe--"* and that was the last thing I heard after I passed out.

I don't know where he took me after... but I remember waking up to the slam of what sounded like a metal hatch closing and the smell of gasoline mixed with blood and mildew curling into my lungs. 

I woke up half-slumped against a wall, wrists heavy and weak.. eyes out of focus. He sat in the corner opposite to me, hairy chest tanned and stretched tight over his collarbones. Clothes gone, just a pair of boxers clinging to him.

I spotted a wet, crusty patch of some liquid on his gray boxers. I did not want to speculate what that was.

He leaned close, arms across the shoulder of a body that was not moving, or could not move. Its eyeballs were exchanged in sockets, left ear missing, and jaw distended open. 

Embracing it, he spoke, *"Say hi... to our guest."* pointing to me. Its face was a ruin, stitched with bruises and worse scars. He nudged it once again - **"RUDE."** he then barked, and with a sudden motion he forced its arm to flop up - limp and grotesque... like a puppet waving at me.

He happened to look to the wooden floor and get lost briefly in some thought. With an irritable nod, he suddenly climbed on top of its lap and twisted its arm across.. grunting like an animal as he did it, struggling with full force - wrestling with it.

I didn't look. All I heard was a wet snap and a thud that followed as he threw something across the floor. I tried to gather myself and get on my knees, but he was too quick to notice.

*"No... no.. no.. no..."* he said slowly, frustrated - *",don't try anything stupid!"*

Like a dog on all fours he crawled to me and stopped inches from my knees. Leaning closer, his breath sour rot - he spoke, *"You look... so much better.. up close. Tell me you'll stay.. won't you? keep me company?"* he asked, almost pleading. 

Looking back to the corpse that now lay on the floor, arm belted across the floor - he said, *"You know, I miss them.. all of them.."* a crocodile's tear rolling down his face. But then he then began to giggle.

Erratically, from a couch in the corner, rust-eaten and stained with old fluids, he yanked free a serrated knife buried deep into the fabric. He dangled it, licking his lips. 

I couldn't move .. couldn't speak. He bent closer as he hovered the knife in front of my eyes. 

He twitched.. a sudden flash of rage lighting up his ugly features. He began to shake and then lunged forward to drive the knife towards my face - I braced for impact, but instead it tore into the wall an inch from my ear.

He drove the knife into the wall again and again, each strike ringing in my skull like a bar striking a bell until its blade finally snapped to the ground in many pieces. 

Then came the silence. He stared at the broken tang of steel in his hand, chest heaving. Then, just as quickly, sudden laughter bubbled out of him.

*"You really thought I'd hurt you? Really?"*

*"Really?!!"*

***"Reallyy????!"*** he screamed, as he began to strike multiple punches into my stomach. *"NO. NO. NO. NO---- ..."* he muttered as he drove in. Then he paused - panting - *".. or maybe.. the answer is .."*, with a sudden grin as his head shook violently - ***"again, maybe.. well MAYBE. yes... yes.... YES!"*** he grabbed my scalp with his cold hands and slammed it hard into the wall.

***"YES... YES..."*** he said, as he rose - almost content from the harm he had done to me. My eyes felt like they were popping out of my sockets. I lost breath, finding it hard to make sense of any of this and what he wanted from me.

*"You know..",* giggling to himself, he ripped the boxers from his body and flung them to the floor. 

***"I have an idea."***

He was naked, smeared in his own sweat and filth. With a maniacal grin, giving me a predatory glance.. he stumbled to a trunk in the corner.

The creak of metal hinges gave way to the stench of gasoline so strong it burned through my nostrils. He now held a dirty red container in his hands, staring at me like a stupid, curious child.

*"What.. wha-"* I mumbled, trying to confront him heedlessly.

*"You wanted to leave, yes?"* he whispered, almost tender again. *"I'm O.K. with that. But let's make it fun for the both of us... before you go."*

Then without any hesitation, he hauled the container over himself, drenching his skin, his hair, the floor, rubbing it thoroughly on his body. Then he turned, slow and deliberate, almost slipping from the wet floor and doused me too - emptying the container. He rubbed my hair firmly as the icky ooze poured.

I had almost accepted my death by then. I knew he was going to torch himself alive, and take me with him. But I tried to summon all the strength I had.

He reached for one of many lighters dumped on a carpet close-by. He tested if any of them worked.. almost patiently.. *one by one.*

As he did so, I finally got up on my knees, hands slipping, mind disoriented. ***"Not yet.. not yet!"*** he asserted... chucking a lighter at me.

He grew frustrated as half of them had died out. Soon, he finally found one that was working - the flame bringing maddening joy to his eyes. 

He then lit himself on fire, dumping the lighter to the floor. The pool of gasoline on the floor lit ablaze almost instantly. 

My sleeve got caught - my leg seared, but instinct made me roll, thrash, beat at myself until the fire died. A few burns etched into my skin.

His scream split the air - raw and painful like a dying animal. He screamed and screamed, shouting like a chorus of a hundred hogs burning alive.   
  
Soon, everything flammable in the basement caught fire - the couch, a carpet, the wasted ply T.V. cabinet ... *his body*.. charring as the screams then turned into twisted laughter.

He didn't stop.

***"TAG!!!! YOU'RE IT!!"*** 

Burning, blistering, he sprinted after me with an inhuman speed. Adrenaline rushed through me. I rose and ran across the basement.

I didn't know where I was going. I just saw the stairs, one hatch .. or maybe a door. As I skipped steps to the top and struggled with the hatch, he knelt to the floor at the bottom to grab a crowbar. 

He started to climb the stairs patiently, and as soon as he was just a few steps below me, I yanked the hatch open.. running out of the restroom shed into the cold night air as he followed.

I almost lost balance and fell to the ground. I was now in the empty, open lot where my car was parked. He came closer. That's when I pushed forward to sprint to salvation - to shuffle the cold car keys and get in.

Behind me, just as I slammed the door - he shrieked laughter through the crackling flames. His shadow stretched across the lot. He burned bright like a human phoenix.

The engine was coughing like it didn't want to live either. I tried repeatedly, but it just didn't start. As he closed in, limping for no reason - the engine finally roared. I slammed the pedal, the car lurching forward.

The fire-mad demon that had once been a man began to run after me. Not stumbling now, just sprinting.

As I hit the road, he ran at an unnatural pace. I hit the gas pedal as hard as I could. But the car wasn't fast enough. I feared it'd die midway.

He kept on running for miles on end - reducing himself to a lone burning figure in my rear-view mirror, running and running with just one sinister purpose.

He gained every time I slowed... until the turn. Until the blinding headlights. Until... the roaring horn of a semi as it plowed into him head on.

It felt final. For the first time all night, the road behind me was empty.

But I didn't know then.. nor do I know now.. if that was the end of him.
