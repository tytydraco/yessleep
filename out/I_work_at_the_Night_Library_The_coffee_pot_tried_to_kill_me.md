Hi, hello: ‘tis I, Night Librarian extraordinaire, Adam Ward. Gather round for a tale that’s sure to chill you to the bone about how I’m a fuuucking idiot.

So, first and foremost, to address the proverbial elephant in the proverbial room, no, we’re not just ignoring the events addressed in [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1r0ng/i_work_at_the_night_library_i_thought_id_last/). I don’t have a ton to add right now, but we’ll get to what little there is. Matt keeps talking about things none of us remember and we’re all just doing our best to go along and not slip up bad enough that he catches on. Can’t decide whether losing the tangible or the conceptual time is worse, so I’m honestly trying not to dwell too much on it while I don’t have any immediate leads on reaching an enlightened (hah, get it? …too soon?) conclusion.

Anyway, for now, let’s shift our focus to other replay-worthy instances—i.e. one in particular that I’ve been promising to talk about for a while but haven’t gotten around to until now because it was, evidently, sick of being ignored and determined that today was as good a time as any to rear its nasty fucking head again.

Yep, you heard right. This shit went down *today*, so. Forgive me if I’m less eloquent than you, my esteemed guests of Reddit, have grown accustomed to.

It’s been a hot minute, but I believe it was in the post where Matt was giving Wiley and I the rundown of the library’s lore that I mentioned in passing that the coffee pot had put a personal hit out on me.

For the emphatic purposes of reiteration: it did do that. Not one of my finest moments. But, not to worry! Because today, I had a shot at redemption. I had a chance to show that fucking hunk of plastic and glass who was boss. The opportunity to tell the world’s most motivational comeback story fell into my lap.

And I absolutely fucked it.

But let me back up a minute first.

I’m gonna speed-run the recounting of the first offense, for the sake of brevity and also because, let’s be so incredibly fucking for real, you want to hear about how stupid I *just* was *so* much more than you want to hear about how stupid I was one time a million years ago. Also, the first one wasn’t really my fault, so. Markedly less entertaining, probably.

Anyway, to re-set the scene, in case you’ve forgotten (which I’m sure you have by now) it was the night of a power outage, which, in this case, was caused by a snowstorm. However, the showcase situation at hand went down *pre*-power outage—I’m a dumbass, but not quite a monumental enough one to try to make coffee without the ability to turn *on* the coffee pot.

So, early evening. Lights were still kicking. Wiley had just accidentally Opened A Door (fifth rule) and we were attempting to recover from the mess *that* had brought down upon us (involving a colorless, odorless substance that mimicked baby powder in appearance but caused a reaction reminiscent of anaphylaxis when inhaled) while also attempting to prepare for the inevitable death of the building’s electricity. It had flickered a couple of times already, and we all knew it was just a matter of time.

Matt and I had already dragged out the generator and two moderately functional battery powered camping lanterns we managed to scrounge up from the depths of the “supply” (that means bullshit) closet, but *I* had the brilliant idea that maybe, if I made a pot of coffee, it would retain enough heat to help keep us a little warmer throughout the night.

The coffee pot, in this particular instance, *was* full of sludge. That, in and of itself, was fine—it’s full of sludge about ten percent of the time, and, true to the rules, all we have to do is dump it out and give it a good rinse before we use it again.

However, I, in this particular instance, was still battling the effects of baby-powder-anaphylaxis.

The reason it’s written into the rules to plug our noses when we’re emptying the brackish, phlegmy substance into the sink isn’t related to *breathing*—it’s about the scent.

I don’t know exactly how to explain the phenomenon, but I’ll do my best.

Think of it as almost opposite, in concept, to smelling salts. If you’ve never experienced them before, the idea is that they wake you the *fuck* up. They promote better, deeper air passage to the lungs and raise your heart rate and blood flow just enough to give you a nice headrush, effectively like an instant energy boost.

This shit does…*not* that.

It would be less dangerous, probably, if all it caused was loss of consciousness. Which it *does* do, of course—but also it slows your heart and, respectively, all of your other fucking organs to the degree that you essentially become, if you’re lucky, temporarily comatose.

I started coughing. That was what did it. It was just a tickle in my throat at first, and I tried to ignore it, tried to swallow it back until I could finish the task at hand, but on my next inhale, thumb and forefinger still clamped dutifully over my nostrils, I choked.

You can use your imagination, probably, to fill in the blanks of that one.

It wasn’t cute. *Fin*.

Wiley found me on the floor and, ironically, *did* use smelling salts to wake my ass up. Took me a minute to catch my breath, but afterwards I was ultimately fine, if exhausted.

That’s pretty much that on that one.

Now, back to the present.

Jenny was on the desk when I came in, and she beckoned me over to her with a wave of her hand, holding onto the corner of the cover of a poor, battered copy of Don Quixote with her fingertips.

“Ew,” I remarked as soon as I was close enough to get a solid visual. It had certainly been subjected to some manner of liquid damage, and there was some wear along the top edge of the spine that looked suspiciously akin to teeth marks.

“It’s moldy,” Jenny announced, popping her gum. “You want it?”

“No,” I told her, circling the counter and plucking the book from her grasp. “The trash wants it.”

“By all means,” she said, bending to pull the small waste basket out from beneath the desk, “feed him.”

I dropped the book with an unceremonious *thump* into the can, kicking it back into place and booting Jenny out of the way of the computer with my hip.

“Rude,” she accused dully, plopping down in the chair next to me as I pulled up the record for the item to delete the holding. “You gonna tell Alice you’re yeeting that or does she just have to figure it out on her own?”

I shrugged. “She doesn’t need to know. Nobody reads that shit. No use reordering it.”

Jenny tipped her head in a *fair enough* manner and pulled open the top drawer of the cabinet to her right, extracting a nail file. “Hey, so, have you been having, um…”

“Nightmares?” I guessed, because I had.

She popped her gum again.

“I’m having a hard time remembering them,” I admitted. “It’s kind of like every time I wake up I know I was just scared shitless but I can’t figure out exactly why.”

“Yeah,” she said. She was filing her pinky nail to a point, tapping the tip of it with her thumb. “I keep waking up and, like…still seeing stuff? Like, writing, all over the walls. But I can’t read any of it. And then I blink a few times and it’s gone.”

I turned to face her. “Does it look like the…the runes or whatever? That were in those books? The ones that…”

“Yeah,” she repeated. “I mean, I don’t remember them *that* well. But I guess.”

We’d gotten off too easily, really. I knew we were both thinking it. Even if we’d lost the last year—or, at least, the memory of it—it still felt as though we’d made it out with far too few wounds to lick.

I didn’t have an opportunity to continue chasing my doom spiral for much longer, though, because Sam was suddenly next to me, having cropped up from seemingly out of nowhere.

“Jesus,” I said.

“I want donuts,” he greeted.

“And I want to know why that’s my problem,” I countered, stepping away from the computer and indicating to Jenny with a sweep of my hand that it was all hers again.

“Are you kidding me? Look at me. Look at my face.” Sam pushed his lower lip out into a pitiful, exaggerated pout. “I’m *so* sad. How could you force me to go on like this?”

I rolled my eyes. “I’m so sorry, Your Highness. Let me just drop everything and cater to your whims.”

Sam scoffed. “Don’t pretend you were actually working. Come *ooon*, come *wiiith meee*.”

“I literally *just* got here,” I complained. “Can’t you just *make* some, master chef?”

For a fraction of a second, Sam hesitated. “I can’t. I’m—I don’t have any eggs left.”

I was *fairly* certain, actually, that we’d just received a donation of surplus eggs from a local farmer a couple of days ago, but I didn’t think too much of it—just figured maybe Sam didn’t feel like cooking for once. “Fuck’s sake, *fine*,” I groaned. “Jen, if Matt’s looking for me, tell him it’s this shithead’s fault I’m gone. I told him I’d be in at eight.”

Jenny saluted me, mid-bubble blowing, and Sam and I headed out.

There’s a bakery just across the street and a couple of doors down called Charmed Confections that prides itself in its expansive open hours—six a.m. to midnight—so, naturally, we frequent it, given that our little strip of town is essentially desolate outside the standard nine to five.

When we pushed our way inside, bells above the door jingling a jovial welcome, Ash, a regular evening shift employee, greeted us with a bright smile.

There was something comforting in their presence, and I realized absently that it was likely because I couldn’t have been sure they’d still be there. Their hair was a little longer than the last time I’d seen them (or, the last time I *remembered* seeing them) but nothing else seemed to have changed much. Similarly to the way Matt (and all of our patrons thus far) had been acting, we certainly weren’t received by them as though we’d just resurfaced after a year-long disappearance.

“Hey, guys. What’s it gonna be tonight?” they asked, tapping the screen of their payment terminal to wake it up.

“Donuts!” Sam trilled, skipping up to the bake case. “Pretty please. Is what’s in here everything you have left?”

“No, no, I just pulled three batches out of the fryers,” Ash assured him. “I’ve got chocolate covered strawberry, sour cream, and cinnamon cider in the back. And then those are, uh…I can’t remember if the long johns are Boston crème or s’mores, but the other ones are plain glazed and blueberry.”

“Oh my *god*,” Sam drooled, “give me everything. Two of each.”

“You got it, boss,” Ash chuckled. “Give me just a sec to finish up the ones in the kitchen and I’ll have ‘em right out.”

“Literal love of my life,” Sam professed, planting himself in a chair at the closest table to the counter to wait.

I sat down across from him, deliberately placing one foot on a black tile square and one on a white.

The white one, as soon as the weight of my heel came to rest fully atop it, wiggled.

“Damn,” I remarked, deliberately shifting it back and forth with my toes. “They really let this place go to hell while we were…gone.”

Sam swiveled downward and snorted when he found the source of my commentary, kicking my foot away. “Leave it alone. They’ll have to shut the whole operation down if you make the one whole loose tile looser.”

I kicked his foot back, intending to reclaim my rightful place, but it quickly became a battle, both of us warring valiantly for purchase, until, finally, we disturbed the tile enough to shake it loose.

“Oh, shit,” Sam laughed in a whisper, casting a quick glance up to make sure Ash hadn’t returned. “Put it back, put it back.”

I leaned down, fingertips grazing the cool, smooth surface, and pushed it forward, attempting to slot it back into its fixture.

The problem was, it wouldn’t quite sit flat.

I furrowed my brow, slotting my finger under the edge and peering beneath.

Was that a—?

“Alrighty, boys,” Ash called, startling me enough that I dropped the tile, shooting back up in my seat. “Ready to go.”

We traversed back to the library hastily, and, once inside, Sam held up his bounty for Jenny (and now also Horace and Alice) to see. “I come bearing gold,” he announced. “Who wants in?”

“Ooh, oh my god, you know what sounds so good?” Jenny asked, and then, to the others, “Oh, it’s donuts. They got donuts. Okay, but what sounds *so* good? Coffee. We can’t eat donuts without coffee.”

“Yooo, so true, bestie,” Sam encouraged, plunking the bag down onto the desk. “Nose goes.”

“I’ll do it,” I volunteered, before the game could take off. “I was thinking it anyway.”

“My hero,” Sam swooned, blinking rapidly at me. “We’ll be awaiting your swift return.”

My return was *not* fucking swift. Yeah. Bet you never could’ve guessed that one.

Everything started off fine.

The coffee pot was clean, I thought, when I picked it up. Usually, when it’s full of sludge, it’s *full* of sludge. So I wasn’t particularly concerned with the probability that there was anything inside.

It’s okay, we’re all thinking it. Everyone should be concerned with everything here at all times. This is not news. But I am *criminally* stupid.

I took it to the sink with the intention of filling it up with water, but when I removed the lid, I took note of something. My passive perception being absolutely off the charts as it is, I came to find that there was a thin, black layer of…*something* caked onto the bottom of the glass.

In my mind, the logical explanation for this was that someone had made coffee, consumed the majority, and left just enough in the bottom that it had congealed and solidified.

So, naturally, I went to clean it out.

Based on the story at the beginning of this entry, I bet I can guess what direction you expect this to go in.

But don’t fret; I didn’t give myself an opportunity to smell it—I just stuck my hand straight in.

Evidently, according to Matt, afterward, no one had ever been enough of an all-encompassing train wreck to *touch* the sludge before, so basically I’m a trendsetter.

It started its ascent up my arm with such immediacy that I didn’t have time to process what was happening. My entire mind short-circuited. Which, probably, is why I started trying to wipe it off with my other hand.

*But, Adam, wouldn’t that cause it to*—

Yeah. Yes. That *did* cause it to spread. Gold stars for everyone.

It was faster than a motherfucker, too.

I felt the panic setting in too quickly to even attempt to ascertain what I should be doing—what *might* be a reasonable course of action—because in *seconds* it had encased both my arms and was crawling up my neck.

I opened my mouth, intentions set on calling out for help, but before I could make a sound, the sludge sloshed its way upward further and it was all I could do to clench my jaw in time to keep it from spilling inside.

The entire upper-mid section of my body was encased in black, tar-like goop, and I was coming fairly swiftly to the determination that I couldn’t move my arms, which meant that when it inevitably spread to my *legs*, I likely wouldn’t be able to move those, either.

I swear to god, I at *least* had the common sense to run. What I didn’t have, however, was the coordination.

I expected, when I fell, to hit the ground and stick to it, the way I had when the robodactyl had covered me in her slime. That wasn’t what happened, though. This muck, whatever it was, was acting as more of a full-body cast than an adhesive. When I kicked my feet, my legs, even the sections of them that were fully coated, still rose from the floor—it was just that I wasn’t able to move them independently above the knee.

Or, soon, below the knee.

If it feels like I’m rushing through relaying this, I promise you, I felt like it was happening in 2x speed.

By the time I felt it oozing down my calves, it started to register that I couldn’t breathe.

Or hear.

Or see.

My best advice, probably, if someone ever came to me in the condition I was in at the time, would be to remain as calm as possible. But that really, *truly* is easier said than done.

I was sure, in that moment, that of all the stupid shit I’ve gotten myself into in this godforsaken fucking place, this was it. This was the one that was going to take me out.

I couldn’t even hyperventilate. The shit had sealed up my mouth and nose like plaster and every inch of me was frozen solid as stone. I’d never had a panic attack without the ability to physically express my anxiety before, and let me tell you: a *million* fucking times worse.

So I did the only thing I could.

I lay there and waited to die.

If I had, my last thought would’ve been that I didn’t even get a fucking donut.

But Horace had other plans for me.

I pride myself in the amount of time I can hold my breath (it’s not actually very impressive, but it *is* two minutes, which feels like a lot when you’re *doing* it) but I was on the verge of losing it. There was a softness creeping into the edges of my consciousness, almost as though sleep was petting my hair like a child, inviting me to drift peacefully away. If I’d passed out, that would have been the end. The body’s reset is to force-start breathing again, and there was no way for it to do so. It was over. I was done.

And then I was…drenched.

When my vision returned to me, Horace was standing over me, as frantic as I’d ever seen him appear, holding a large, blue bucket. His shirt was soaking wet, as was the floor, as was I.

I inhaled and sputtered and coughed and he bent to the floor, knees crackling like Rice Krispies, to help me into a seated position, smacking my back as if I was a toddler who’d just swallowed a Lego.

“Fuck,” I managed, once I’d caught my breath. “Jesus Christ. Thank you. I thought…thank you. How did you—what did you do?”

Horace, who was panting about as heavily as I was, nodded to the bucket he’d abandoned on the ground next to him when he’d stooped to help me. “Water,” he said. “That’s how we always get rid of it when it’s in the coffee pot, so I just figured maybe…and I guess it worked.”

I blinked back at him for a moment, processing. “You’re telling me if I’d just turned on the sink this shit would’ve disappeared like it always does?”

He shrugged.

I’ll be honest, chat, I really just wanted to lay back down and will myself to die for like a full ten seconds.

Instead, however, I pushed myself to my feet and headed to Della’s closet to grab a mop.

So there you have it. Dumbfuck Supreme, Adam Ward, signing off.

Until next time.

P.S. I *did* get a donut. Best fucking thing I’ve ever tasted, coffee be damned.
