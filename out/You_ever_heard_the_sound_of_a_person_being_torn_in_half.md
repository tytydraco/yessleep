The Captain avoided me for most of the journey. I spotted him only once, in port, as he walked into the pilot room. He was a squat man with a bushy beard, a pinched face, and a nose that reminded me of a Goldfinch beak. I called out to him to ingratiate myself, but he ignored me and went about his work.

I was told he liked to keep to himself, but I assumed that since the company had paid for my passage, he would eventually avail himself to me. We were on our third night on the river, and I hadn’t seen the hide or hair of the man. I started to think that the pilot room wasn’t just where he controlled the steamer but also his nest.

The Big Easy River Company had hired me to write about their new four-day trip up the Mississippi River. It was a test run, and I’d have the whole place to myself. The accommodations were passable but not spectacular. The previous month, I had been aboard one of the newer luxury ocean liners, and the rooms on that ship were busting at the seams with extravagant touches. This steamer had only given me a mint on my pillow.

Regardless, the trip was not my first concern. The company paid me good money for the story, and the extra “bonus” they provided when I arrived ensured the coverage would be positive. The Big Easy River Company had once been the class of the river but had fallen behind competitors offering quicker trips at lower prices. Not to mention the growing ocean liner business that sailed into the Port of New Orleans and promised locales more exotic than Kansas or Missouri.

The ride along the Mississippi was smooth, but the constant thwack of the paddle hitting the water and the steam engine clattering did not allow for the most restful sleep on the ship. Especially if you were near the big wheel itself. Thankfully, I wasn’t, but that last night, I found myself growing restless.

I became convinced that the Captain had to have stories to tell. I found it queer that, despite the dire straits the company found itself in, he refused to speak to me. I was sure he would have all kinds of tales to color my story. Yet, he rarely left the pilot’s room.

Since sleep wouldn’t come, I decided to walk around the ship when everything was still. See if my smooth-talking ways might get the crew to open up. Like the Captain, they had avoided me like the plague. I found it odd that a struggling company wouldn’t force its crew to be more hospitable, but I had already been paid. It was their choice.

These crew conversations always yielded fruit. Once, while writing a story about a campsite in the Adirondacks, I had a conversation with a Ranger. He told me of all the strange phenomena he’d dealt with while working there: ghosts, creatures, and things of that nature. I took some of the more gruesome details and sprinkled them into the article. My editors nearly canceled the story, but I convinced them to run it as is. It was a massive hit.

Reservations at the campsite were booked up to two years in advance.

The truth was, if a place was eerie, Ghoul Chasers (my preferred name for dark tourists) were always drawn to it. Knowing this, I liked to throw a bone – quite literally in the case of the skeletal remains found in Highnorth Cabins – to those readers. Ghoul Chasers flocked to these places, hoping to have a paranormal encounter to impress neighbors back home. Not every client wanted to cater to the Ghoul Chasers, but money is money. Any complaints were dulled by the wads of greenbacks they pulled in post-publication.

I hoped for something along those lines during this trip but had rolled snake eyes so far. It was a shame because there had to be lore and legends surrounding the mighty Mississippi. It’d go a long way if someone would comment, but mum was the word. I even prompted several porters, but they kept their cards close to the vest. I assumed this edict came from the top down. This led me to believe I’d have to get stories from the Captain’s lips alone.

As I rounded the ship’s prow, I was stunned to come face-to-face with the Captain. He was smoking a pipe and staring out into the inky blackness. Spray from the water dotted his face and belly. Droplets rolled down his body, but he didn’t seem to mind. *Divine intervention*, I thought.

“Something hidden out there?” I asked with a warm, soft chuckle.

“Aye,” he said, his eyes never straying from the black.

I laughed again, “Should I be concerned?”

He didn’t respond with words. He puffed on his pipe and blew out a cloud of gray smoke that mingled with the night air. “You’re the writer, eh?”

“I am,” I said, extending my hand. “I’ve been hoping I’d get a chance to talk. Your crew speaks very highly of you.”

He didn’t shake my hand. I sheepishly pulled it away. “They’re a good bunch.”

Flattery didn’t get me anywhere, and I changed tactics. “Been with Big Easy for long?”

“No,” he said, tapping his pipe on the railing. “I came aboard a month ago.”

“When the new owners came on board as well, correct?”

“Aye.”

“Where were you before?”

“I’ve piloted many a boat down the river over my life.”

“Find it rewarding work?”

He shrugged, “I just keep rolling along.”

“What drew you to the job?”

He paused and carefully chose his words. I allowed myself to believe that maybe he was opening up. “I...I needed work after my last job ended...*poorly*.”

“Oh? What happened? Who were you with before?”

“Private owner and I don’t care to speak on it.”

I pulled out a cigarette and offered one to the Captain. He demurred my offer but pinched fresh tobacco into his pipe. He was gonna stay for a while. I offered a match, and he leaned in. “Was it a private shipping company? Pleasure cruise?”

“Little of both,” he said. “Brought his family with him. Wife and a doll baby little girl.” He looked away and sighed, “I told him to keep those babes at home. The wild river was no place for them, but he insisted.”

“Same in my business,” I said, taking a puff of my smoke, “when the moneymen insist, we do it.”

“Some men have no sense.”

“Some men don’t,” I agreed. “Are there a lot of smaller shipping companies along the river?”

“Not as many as before. Big fish eat the little fish,” he said, “but he wasn’t hauling goods for some shipping company. He was into something else.”

“Smuggling?” I asked.

“The man was worse than a smuggler. A damn fool adventurer. Rich as Croesus. Paid handsomely for the things he wanted.”

I was right about there being a story. This old salt had taken a big mukety-muck with cash to burn on a secret but deadly mission. A mission that may have ended tragically. The Captain was not forthcoming with details but was starting to open up. I’d work him, and he’d eventually give up the ghost.

“Before I came, I read up on the river’s history. There were a lot of tales of pirates using the river to hide their ill-gotten gains. Was your man after buried treasure?”

“Something like that.”

“Oh,” I said, taking a drag of my cigarette, “Who’s buried treasure was it? Blackbeard? Pegleg Pete?”

He stared up at the onyx sky and shook his head. “Wasn’t a treasure, exactly. But I’ve said too much already.”

He turned to leave, and I saw the more colorful elements of my article walking away with him. I shot my arm out and caught his. He stopped and glared at me. “Look, I understand you don’t want to share this information. I do. But it looks like you might need to unburden yourself. Anything you tell me now, I’ll keep off the record. You have my word.”

He paused, and I saw the wheels in his mind turning. “Would you do a blood oath to that promise?”

It was my turn to pause. “A blood oath?”

“Aye,” he said, pulling a small pocketknife out and presenting his hand. It was scared from various other blood oaths this man had taken over the years. “This information needs to stay secret. Too many great men and women have met their ends because of it.”

I eyed the ancient knife and wondered when the blade was last cleaned. Perhaps my story was good enough as written. Just then, there was a flutter in my mind, and an exciting prospect came to me. Maybe old salt stories were an untapped goldmine in the publishing world. This might be my way into that world. I’d deal with the scar if a carved-up hand transformed into money in my palm.

“All right,” I said and offered up my palm. In a flash, the Captain sliced a scarlet slash across my skin. I clutched it with my other hand as blood seeped out through the tiny slits. Without batting an eye or wiping off the knife, he sliced his palm, too.

“Shake on it.”

I did and felt our blood mingling. I shuttered. The things you do for an exclusive.

“Now,” I said, pulling back my bloody hand, “What was he looking for?”

“Not a treasure but a location hidden down one of the tributaries.”

“There surely can’t be unexplored places along this river.”

“There are unexplored places all around us,” he said, taking another puff, “you just have to know where to look.”

“What was at this hidden place?”

“An old temple mound,” he said.

“Treasures are in there?”

“You’re not understanding. There ain’t any physical treasure. The treasure is the mound itself.”

“How can an old pile of dirt be worth anything?”

“It’s a sacred place built by the first peoples that populated this land.”

“Indians?”

“Older,” he said. I laughed. He didn’t. “Man didn’t create this temple, and he’s not welcome there. I tried to tell Mr. Chambers, but he didn’t listen.”

That name rang a bell. Jonas Chambers, the furniture magnate, had gone missing with his family earlier this year. They never found a single hair from any of his family members. After the investigation, there had been a sensational trial between his surviving siblings about dividing up his assets. It had gotten ugly. Ultimately, the company folded. What struck me as odd was that the papers had reported that Jonas Chambers had been traveling by train and never arrived at his destination.

“Jonas Chambers?” I asked, seeking clarification.

“He’d obsessed over the temple for years. I’d refused him seven times before he finally won me over. I wish I had stayed firm in my rejection.”

“You were there? How did you get away without any physical harm?”

“I stayed in the steamer,” he said, embarrassed.

“What happened?”

“I don’t rightly know,” he said, “I saw them as they entered the woods. I begged him to keep his wife and child on board, but rich men do whatever rich men want. About ten minutes later, the woods went quiet. Like something had instructed it to. Then, there came a whipping wind that blew from the East. Trees as old as Moses snapped at the trunk. The boat nearly capsized, but I kept her steady.”

He paused, and in the corner of his craggy eyes, tears started to form. I reached over and touched his arm, letting him know without a single word spoken that he was in a safe place with me. He cleared his throat and continued.

“It went still again but remained deathly quiet. I strained my ears to hear them walking through the trees. I heard his squeal when he found the temple mound. His wife and his babe followed suit. Pure joy in their voices. I even smiled myself. I hoped he’d turn back and not climb the mound, but…”

“Why couldn’t he climb the mound?”

“That ain’t man’s place. He don’t belong near it.”

“What happened?”

The Captain sighed. “A bellow came bubbling from deep within the Earth. Without the noise of the natural world, you could feel it rattle your bones. I clutched my ears to blot out the bedeviling noise, but it made no difference. The Old Ones, they can get to you however they want.”

A chill raced up my spine at the mention of the “Old Ones.”

You hear all kinds of fantastic stories when you’ve dabbled in the paranormal for as long as I have. Often, they’re independent of one another, and most are hoaxes. In my travels, I’d heard amazing legends that all turned out to be nothing more than some lie told to hide a more horrid truth.

There was the remains of a two-headed boy in Rustin, Louisiana. I went there and found two pig fetuses stuffed into a mason jar. Or the man who swore the world would end on April 8th. When the day came and passed, he killed himself and his family. To say nothing of the raving Fool of Avery Island who was called the “King of Carrot Flowers” and swore he spoke to Mother Nature herself. What I found was a ranting, malnourished mental deficient tied to a rope in a family-run freak show.

But tales about the “Old Ones” cropped up nationwide. Stranger still, these stories all shared similar details. People who dealt with them all came out of the experience changed. Their rantings seemed real, more believable. Liars have a spark in their eyes that a trained journalist can spot. These people, though, that spark had gone.

Those stories always played (and, most importantly, paid) well.

Personally, I was on the fence about them, but a large contingent of my Ghoul Chasers were true believers. The talk of a race of people living here before man was worth exploring. They’d travel any distance and probe the areas where the ancient creatures were said to exist. Some came to find actual proof, while others went for real thrills. None came away disappointed by the hunt, though. These legends have persisted for a reason.

“The ‘Old Ones’?” I asked, playing dumb to pry more from him.

“Eons before man dreamed of a life outside the treetops, these lands were controlled by powerful creatures borne from the depths of unimaginable hell. They crossed the land, causing chaos and order in equal measure. Saving some while killing others.”

“That’s who the Chambers family ran into?”

“Aye,” he said with a nod, “I know it makes me sound like a loon, but I know what I saw!”

“Have you seen things like that before?”

The Captain turned towards me, “When you’ve been on the water for as long as I have,” he said, his eyes locking on mine, “strange happenings become common. But whenever I come into contact with one of them….” He trailed off.

“What happened after the noise?”

“Right,” he said, turning his attention back to the dark water, “After the rumbling stopped, I screamed from the boat for the family. I yelled myself hoarse, but I don’t think they heard a thing. Our voices are small in the grand scheme of things. Suddenly, the sky above the mound filled with thousands of glowing green and yellow lights, no larger than a button. It reminded me of the night sky out in the Atlantic.”

“Were these fireflies or…”

“No,” he said curtly, “Even if they were fireflies, no man could conjure up so many in one place on a whim. Those are the actions reserved for a god.”

This gave me pause again. “A god?”

"What else would you call things that can manipulate the world? The Indians of this land knew all too well that gods walk among us.”

“What happened after the fireflies appeared?”

He paused again. His ruddy face was drained of all its color. Even in the moonlight, it was possible to see his complexion change. Whatever had happened had scared this man to his very core.

“You ever heard the sound of a person being torn in half?”

My stomach roiled. I had, in fact, never heard the sound of a person ripped in half. It was a noise I didn’t even know existed. I hoped to avoid hearing anything close to that for the rest of my days. I softly shook my head no.

“The tearing...the screams. The wife...the babe,” he took off his cap and ran his hand through his slick hair. “After the fireflies left, all returned to normal. I wasn’t sure what to do. I knew I should turn the steamer around and head for port, but something inside me told me to go to the beach. I...I had to check to make sure there were no survivors. I thought maybe the Old Ones had played with my mind. I would only be able to trust my own eyes.”

He pulled a pouch of loose tobacco out of his pocket, pinched some, and placed it in his pipe. His hand was shaking. I, again, provided a match. He nodded thanks before he continued.

“I put my foot down on the shore, and it felt like I was entering a foreign land. My whole body trembled, and I could hardly move, but some ancient desire for knowledge pushed me forward. I entered the forest and heard the noise around me cease.”

“Did you run back?”

“I wanted to but...but then I heard the crying of the babe. A melancholic sob that pulled at my heart. I made my way towards the sobbing, but as I got deeper, the crying no longer drew me in. In fact, the crying stopped altogether. The laughter began.”

“Was it the Old One?”

He nodded. “I don’t think they wanted to harm me. I think they wanted to warn me to stay away. So I did.”

“Why would they warn you?”

He shrugged, “I’ve struggled with that question every day since. Why was I spared and the other not?” His face softened, and the grief shone through.

“The guilt of living through something when others died,” I said, “Over the years doing my job, I’ve spoken to countless people who’ve dealt with that, too. What you’re feeling, it’s normal,” I said, hoping to convince him to keep talking.

“I am engine,” he said, resigned, “I keep rolling on.”

“Even engines need to refuel, Captain.” He ignored me, but I pressed on. “You lived because you were supposed to. Nothing more, nothing less. Just the luck of the draw. No divine intervention necessary.”

“But there was. Aye, they let me live, but they’ve also cursed me. Cursed me with the knowledge of their existence,” he shook his head, “Now, I’ve cursed you as well.”

I laughed, “How have you cursed me?”

“With knowledge,” he said, “I told you where they can be found. Now you’ll want to go see them.”

“I don’t even know where they are!”

He pointed his pipe at the shore. “That’s where we beached,” he said, staring at the banks.

“How can you be sure that is the exact location?” I asked, dubious of this coincidence.

The Captain didn’t share my doubts. “That’s how they weave their black magic. The Old Ones are playing tricks, man. Putting us together right near where the temple mound is located.”

I stared out at the shore but didn’t see anything but black. I wasn’t even sure there was a tributary there, but I don’t have the eyes of a sailor. I can’t tell the subtle differences between dark water and dark land. The first thoughts that flooded my brain were *You’re absolutely correct. I have no desire to go there*.

But then there was a flutter in my mind. Sure, danger loomed...but if I witnessed something as incredible as the Old Ones, this would be the biggest story of my career. The payday would be massive. Hell, international fame might follow.

“They’re talking to you, aren’t they? The whispers. I’ve heard them, too.”

I shook my head, “I only hear my own thoughts.”

“Are you sure those thoughts are yours alone?”

“Yes,” I said but found myself doubting my answer. *Were* these thoughts mine? Was this thought mine? Had any of the thoughts that led me to this moment my own? Of course, they were.

Only I control my own destiny.

At this moment, I became keenly aware that this tale was starting to sound extraordinarily like the other hoaxes I’d seen before. Was the Captain messing with me? I had no proof he piloted the ship that led the Chambers family to their final destination. Wouldn’t I have heard his name as the story became a national sensation? Was he playing a trick on me because he hated the press?

He had avoided me the entire voyage, and it was strange he was now spilling his guts like we were old gal pals chatting about unrequited love. Was this some silly prank he devised to mess with me? The more I let the thought breathe, the more alive the idea became.

Yes, he *had* to be messing with me.

“If you want, I can take you there,” he said, tapping the spent tobacco out of his pipe.

There was that flicker at the base of my skull again. “I’d like that,” I said, surprising myself. I had meant to say no, but my voice vetoed my brain.

“Are you sure?”

“Yes,” I said, my mouth again taking the lead. “I need to see this.”

He nodded and exited the deck for the pilot’s cabin. I stood along the railing, my mind screaming at my body to run and stop him. But my legs wouldn’t dislodge from where I stood. Something had ensnared my mind. It was in control. I could watch, comment, or object, but changing course was impossible. The river’s current had us now. All that was possible now was to float along and pray the river didn’t lead us to a waterfall.

The steamship turned, and from my spot on the prow, the hidden tributary of the river came into view. It’d be a snug fit, but the Captain was a masterful pilot and guided us with little trouble. The riverboat gently nudged against the shallows and came to a stop.

The woods before us sang the most fabulous symphony Mother Nature had ever conceived. It was so loud that I found my thoughts (and only *my* thoughts) drowned out in the noise. The thoughts of the intruder in my mind had no problem speaking with the Captain, who had returned from his perch.

“The water is shallow here,” he said, nodding towards the ship’s side, “that ladder will take you down. I’ll wait for you.”

“Sounds great,” I cheerfully said. *Was it still me?*

Before a thought manifested in my brain, I’d climbed the ladder and stepped into the frigid river water. It didn’t slow me down, and a few steps later, I was on terra firma again. Despite this being a wild spot along a wild coastline, I spied a small trail laid out before me. It turned into the darkness of the woods, and I believed it’d lead me to the forbidden temple mound.

I was internally screaming at the slumbering part of my brain to wake up and turn back, but nothing I did stopped it. My body moved towards the trail. Towards the darkness. Towards the Old Ones.

“It’s a pilgrimage to the holiest of the holies,” the Captain yelled from the deck. “You’re home, stranger. Rejoice in the glory of your gods!”

“Praise be,” I hollered back as I walked into the foliage and lost sight of the shore.

I strode down the well-worn dirt path. My feet slapped against the mud with each footfall, making me slide a bit. The noise around me now was deafening. I understood that nothing inside these woods feared man, which meant one of two things: they didn’t know about man and thus weren’t afraid of his arrival or that there was something much worse than man in these woods. I prayed for option A but feared it was B.

I stepped along the path, and my foot hit something I wasn’t expecting: a stone pathway. The noises around me vanished as soon as my shoe’s sole hit the rock. I had triggered something. It was just as the Captain had told me. The winds would be next.

The gale force arrived, sending me flying through the air until I slammed against the side of an ancient oak with a crack. A heavy branch above me splintered and came screaming toward the ground. Though dazed, I managed to roll out of the way as the branch crashed into the ground with a sickening thud. It would’ve crushed me to goop.

As I rolled for my life, my head bashed into a rock on the ground, sending painful bursts of color into my vision. Pain racked my entire body. The gaping wound on my forehead trickled blood down my face. I was miserable, but the jolt to my head had broken the spell. My entire mind was mine again. My first thought was my best: *move, or you’ll die*.

I stood, my legs wobbly under me, and made off for the river again. As I went crashing through the brush, new wounds opened on my face and exposed arms, but I kept moving. As soon as I broke through the brush and came face to face with the steamship, the crack of a revolver broke through the night sky. A bullet whizzed past my body. The Captain had fired the shot.

“You must go to the temple mound! The Old Ones demand it! I am your engine, lords! I keep rolling on!” He pointed his gun and squeezed off another shot.

I dove away, the bullet just missing my body, and landed face-first on the muddy river bank. I pulled myself up instantly and headed back into the cover of the bushes. Another shot rang out, but it was behind me and embedded into a tree. As it did, the branches above me screamed in pain. A chilling horror crept in: *Was this whole area the body of an Old One?*

Suddenly, the ground shook, and a deep bass flowed from my feet to my head. I covered my ears but felt the bone-rattling noise in my organs. After the sound’s crescendo, I heard the Captain cheering and dancing on the deck.

“They’ve arrived!”

Above me, thousands of green and yellow lights emerged from the darkness. I was a trapped animal. An angry awakening deity behind me and a raving lunatic with a pistol in front of me. Like all pilgrims, my salvation required a baptism. I’d have to dive into the mighty Mississippi and swim for it.

I dove into the water, and the cold stunned my limbs. I pushed past the pain and swam away from the shore as fast as my arms would take me. I heard bullets hit the water, but they were well behind me. As soon as I was out of the tributary, I felt the river’s pull strengthen and drag me along. A downed log floated past me, and I hooked an arm around it. I held on for dear life for miles until I beached hours later.

I hid among the brush and shivered until daybreak. I awaited death, but he did not show. Nor did the steamship or the crazed Captain that manned it. Hours later, when it was safe, I caught the attention of a passing barge that graciously ferried me back to New Orleans.

Once in the city, I marched to the Big Easy River Company office, ready to tear into the struggling owners. But, when I arrived at my destination, my anger had chilled to fear. The building was empty. The office where I had picked up my ticket and interviewed the owners wasn’t just vacant but dilapidated like it hadn’t been occupied for years. I asked around about the company, and the locals assumed I had just come staggering off Bourbon Street. A sickening truth grabbed me.

*The Big Easy River Company never existed.*

Now, I *am* on Bourbon Street, trying to reconcile what I went through. I know the company offered me a ticket for an article. I know that I went into that office. I know that I was on the steamship. I know I met the Captain.

But I also know I wasn’t in control of my brain for those fleeting moments on that shoreline. My own body. The Old Ones had been. Using the Captain and myself to bring either sacrifices or converts to their ancient ways.

A thought came to me in that moment. *I am an engine, and I’m rolling on.* There was that pleasing flicker at the base of my skull again. I smiled.

I should publish this article. It would bring the Ghoul Chasers in droves. Maybe the Big Easy River Company will be up and running then. After all, the Old Ones need help. Who am I to turn a blind eye to their pleas?

For I am an engine, and I’m rolling on.
