I'm only posting this to disprove some of the accusations made by the powers that be against me, the owner, and one of my co-workers.

First, Adrian Nelson is a liar. If you ever happen to be in the northeastern side of New Jersey and happen to run into a long haired guy with a lumberjack-esque beard who looks like he's seen a ghost, don't believe a word he says. I know for a fact that Adrian did not, in fact, survive the "incident" on March 3rd. His spirit or whatever is eternally bound to the restaurant (just a thing that happens when you die within the property line). If you find "Adrian" anywhere outside of the restaurant's parking lot, ignore him. It's better for your mental health.

He'll try to hit you in the feelings with stuff like; “oh god, there's something horrible under the restaurant” or “The waitress kills people!” or even the classic “Don't believe a word the media says about Cannibal Chin's!”. 

There's nothing horrible under the restaurant. Sure we've got spiders and ants down there but who doesn't? Also, Cannibal Chin's is the finest horror themed eating establishment on this side of New Jersey and blah blah corporate nonsense you've heard a thousand times before.

And most importantly, I haven't killed anyone in a very, very long time.

Second, the owner does NOT spend all his time mutilating himself to make our products. Is it true that he may have accidentally cut off his finger while teaching the Cook how to, ya know, cook? Yes. Did that severed finger fall into one of the greasers along with the fries? Also yes. Did a customer eat that finger? Yes. What followed afterward was a long series of lawsuits, the restaurant being shut down for a few months, and the owner eventually rebranding to "Cannibal Chin's" to capitalize on his own grisly story. But since that first accident, the owner has not used any of his body parts to feed the patrons. At least I don't think he does.

Come to think of it, I've never actually seen a delivery truck come to the restaurant. Whatever, that's above my paygrade anyway.

Also, no one of or relating to Cannibal Chin's discriminates against the undead. A few of New Jersey's local "witches" decided to hold a Ouiji board sermon or something in the restaurant one day. They claimed that the restaurant's proximity to the meadowlands was actually great for thinning the veil between this mortal coil and the world beyond. A few dozen cups of water and two baskets of free breadsticks later, the red haired, tatted up, wide eyed "witch" got up from her table and approached me at the counter.

"Hi," I said, trying my best to maintain my composure for these people that surely wouldn't even tip, "Would you like to order something?"

The red haired "witch", who I had taken to calling Red, moved her hair out of her eyes and cleared her throat. "My coven and I would like to file a formal complaint against your service, ma'am."

"What?" I said.

I must have looked more shocked than I was actually feeling, because I saw the most shit-eating grin creep across Red's face as she said, "Your soul is tainted."

I raised my eyebrow, faked a concerned frown, and waited for her to continue. I've found it’s easier to placate most of the customers rather than ignore them or be rude. Things tend to go more smoothly that way, at least in my experience.

"You've become corrupted by capitalism, bureaucracy, and greed. It's made you apathetic. You're so far from reaching the light of Satan right now that you might as well be in Purgatory. You know nothing, and are nothing. Just an inky black void floating around, waiting for something to come along and put you out of your misery."

Well, if she wanted to insult me, she wasn't doing a great job. She was annoying me, mostly, kind of like all those psychiatrists the company made me see after my first six months working here.

"There is a way you can help yourself though," she told me, holding her hand outstretched to me. Whether she wanted me to take it or not was anyone's guess, but I damn sure wasn't making any physical contact with her if I could avoid it.

Instead though, one of the other witches handed Red a small, rusted key with a five pointed star welded onto the end of it. I didn't even see this one get up from the booth. They were silent, like a fart in the wind.

This one was androgynous looking, with long black hair kept in dreadlocks, snakebite piercings, and a tattoo under their right eye. I guess it was supposed to be some kind of archaic, runic, otherworldly sigil, but to me it just looked like a toddler tried to draw a key on their face.

The second "witch", who I'm calling Key, stared at me after they handed the key to Red. They had beady green eyes that honestly seemed like they were going to fall out of their head. They didn't blink, their gaze never wandered.

Now THAT was unnerving.

Red handed me the key (with Key still silently watching me. I was starting to feel like a rabbit in front of a lion), and winked. She turned around, taking Key by their arm, and walked toward the door. The third "witch" got up from the booth to follow them, never saying a word or looking at me at all. Thank god for small miracles.

Before Red crossed the threshold separating the inside from the outside, she yelled back over her shoulder, "You'll thank me later!", and let the door close after her.

When they were gone, I went to bus their table but I was surprised to find that their table was actually clean. Like, more than clean. More than spotless, even. It was practically brand new. The years of stains and dried up half-fake, half-maybe-real blood, splinters, dust; it was all gone. The seats were refurbished and the paint was crisp, like they'd been taken from the set of a 1950's malt shop, which was strange because the seats were rentals from the previous owners of this building.

I knew that for a fact because I had helped move them in here. Getting them to this level of cleanliness should have been impossible for anyone to do, let alone while sitting at a table right in front of me and playing with a Ouija board. I'm not complaining in the slightest, it's just very unusual.

On top of all of that tho, they left a pretty decent tip, despite not actually ordering any entrees or drinks. It's not often there are, well, "nice" things that happen in the restaurant.

Circling back to Adrian Nelson, my good for nothing coworker whose presence in this story is, regrettably, too large. A couple Friday afternoons after the "witches" had left the restaurant, the owner came out of the back, walked to the entrance, hung up our "Closed" sign, and locked the door.

He looked a lot worse for wear than the last time I’d seen  him; his eyes were bloodshot, his fingernails were gnarled and gangly, like they'd been untrimmed for at least several months. His beard was a shade of gray that was almost unnatural for someone his age. His apron was stained with way more blood than normal. I doubt all of that was his. The coloring was off.

The owner grabbed my shoulders, whispering frantically to me, "Marceline, I need you to go into the basement RIGHT NOW. There's something down there and it's got Andrian and the Cook held hostage."

"What, uh," I stuttered, "what the fuck is down there?"

"I have no idea, but it's not friendly."

"Well what do you expect me to do?" I asked him.

He shrugged. "Use your feminine charms or something, I don't know. The restaurant will close if I go down there and die, and we can't replace the Cook because of- we can't replace him. Look, in all honesty I just need you to save the Cook. If you can snag Adrian too, great! If not… well i won't lose any sleep over it, honestly."

"And what if I...?"

"We’ll cross that bridge when you get to it."

I have to admit; it wasn't the most reassuring thing that I've heard the owner tell me. Pep talks were never really his thing. Usually when there's an unruly customer or one of the attic ghosts starts terrorizing some poor patron with a hint of faith in their heart, I'm pretty well prepared to handle the situation. The owner was always giving me praise about using my feminine charm to "handle things", and he was generally pretty positive. A little awkward, sure, strange maybe, but positive. 

This time, though, I could tell he was losing his cool. 

"Welp," he said, patting me on the shoulder, "best of luck to ya Marcy!" 

He wasn't seriously expecting me to handle this alone, right? I mean, it was the basement. Like, THE basement. Like the basement where most people don't come out  with all their fingers and toes. The same basement where all those containment fiction authors disappeared after they framed that one woman and put her wife in the mental hospital. The police that went down there to apprehend them never found any of the bodies.

"You're not going to help?"

"You kidding me? There's a fucking critter down there and I am the LEAST qualified person in this fine establishment to handle that sort of thing." He walked to the backdoor, looked over his shoulder, and smiled before closing it behind him.

Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Why didn't I just leave well enough alone and quit my job right then and there? Honestly, it's because I barely make enough to afford the place that I'm staying in right now. There's also the fact that I'm just not that kind of person anymore, or at least I try very hard not to be. I value self preservation as much as the next person, but my therapist keeps telling me that the road to healing is paved with genuine effort to improve. 

I'm not going to get into the ever-growing laundry list of reasons why I felt like I had to save at least one of them. I just need you to understand that it's hard living alone in this economy, even harder finding a decent paying job like this with a past like mine. I'm not going to risk my comfort and security over a silly thing like monsters or cannibals in the basement. 

I wasn't about to go down there unprepared either. 

The Cook was, for lack of a better word, an introvert. He never showed his face, never really talked to me or Adrian or any of the other part-timers. He was never late and always left on time. Never once complained about the ghosts or the kitchen hallucinations, he never asked questions (thank god), and he never let anyone touch his utensils. 

As I looked through the Cook’s bag, I was surprised to see very few cooking utensils in there. He had your standard kitchen array; knives, spatulas, that sort of thing, but all of that was in a neatly packaged little side pocket. The rest of the bag was a completely different story.

So you know how cryptid hunters you see in TV shows carry a lot of random-looking bullshit on them at all times? Stun guns, weird redneck engineered net guns, vortex cannons, that kind of stuff? Whatever you’re imagining right now is pretty much what was in this bag, just a bit more… non-Euclidean. You can trust me on that because, unlike most people on this planet, I’m quite familiar with higher-dimensional weaponry. Never used any of it before, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t know what it was. 

The Cook had what I grew up calling a “Ball Buster”. Looked like a slightly exaggerated nine millimeter with tubes filled with glowing green vito-fluid running along the sides. The trigger was, as these things usually are, biometrically locked (not exactly an issue to get around). On the right side of the Ball Buster were tally marks, seventeen in total, and a cute flower etched near the barrel. 

The man had taste, I’ll give him that. 

After screwing around with the Ball Buster for a few seconds, I finally got the thing to ignore the biometric locks and respond to me pulling the trigger. I fired a test shot into the floor for good measure, just in case the critter happened to be directly below me. When I didn’t hear a yelp or cry or shriek or whatever noise I thought it would make, I sighed and opened the basement door. 
The basement reeked as it usually did. The stench of old, borderline-rotting meat had no qualms about flooding my nose. The first couple of times I walked past the basement, I gagged, but after a few years of admittedly much weirder and more vile smells in the restaurant, I became accustomed to it. 

I felt around in the pitch darkness for the light switch once I reached the bottom of the stairs. Once I found it, I flipped it twice. Once to see if it worked, and again to see if I’d flipped it the wrong way. 

If I wasn’t so certain of my place in this reality, I could have sworn I heard the darkness laughing at me. 

Using the flashlight on my phone instead, I started to prowl around the basement, stalking my invisible foe, lost in time once again. I could hear my own footsteps, the webs being spun by the spider two feet to my left. The darkness was a cover, hiding both me and the prey that lay within. 

I took a big, silent sniff of the air, tracking Adrian’s scent through the rot and must. I could almost taste his fear. I pried myself free from my old instincts and kept searching. I needed to get out of there before I lost myself. 

The doctors said that, after the incident, things like that would happen from time to time. The flashbacks, the regression into that primal, predatory state of being. I didn’t want them to be right, and I hated how they categorized my emotions into a neat little box like that for them to analyze and sneer at. If anyone ever asks, though, that doesn’t happen and has NEVER happened. 

I searched the basement for what felt like hours before I came across a door that I’m fairly certain had not been there before. It certainly wasn’t on any of the floor layouts in the office, anyway. The door was steel and warm to the touch, cracked slightly ajar. That fear smell radiated through it, and I knew that I was on the right track. I held the Ball Buster at eye-level and snuck inside. 

Looking back, I wish I hadn’t.

On the other side of the door was an enormous, wet, and musty cavern. Huge strings of moss and, what I can only assume to be recently departed entrails hung from the ceiling and walls. There was a light shining from the ceiling, sort of illuminating the center of the cavern and obscuring the edges in darkness. On the ground, scattered around unevenly, were the flesh and bones of the recently departed (that must have been where all those containment fiction authors disappeared to last week). Some of them were still moving, barely clinging to life. Their glazed-over eyes scanned the cavern, trying to find salvation.

Just on the other side from where I stood I could make out the silhouettes of Adrian and the Cook suspended maybe ten feet off the ground. Beyond them was the critter the boss was talking about. 

The critter was a leviathan, a titanic, scaly, snake-like thing with too many eyes and too many teeth lining its mouth. It was both too big to fit in the cavern and too small to be visible to the human eye. Its body was transparent—no, it was opaque, and made of gelatin. As I shone my flashlight on it, I could see the bodies of its most recent victims being digested within its acidic stomach. 

The critter sneered at me with a hundred thousand yellow eyes that burned with hatred far greater than anything I experienced before. It snarled and licked its lips. I froze. 

“Does it wish to serve Me?” It asked.

It took me a minute to steel my nerves again. I could feel that primal presence lurking over my shoulder, desperately screaming in my ear to let it take control. I tried to suppress it.

“No,” I said. “I just want the Cook.”

At that, Adrian squeaked. “What? Marcy, you son of a bitch!”

The critter growled, splitting its attention between me, Adrian, and the Cook. 

“Does it know what I am?”

I shook my head. “Not really. And I don’t really care, I'm just trying to keep my job here, man. My boss sent me down here to find that motherfucker right there and I’m not leaving without him!”

“Hmm.” 

The critter scuttled, no, flew toward me, scooping me up in its enormous, meaty claws. It brought me to its face and stared into my soul, drilling gashes into the very fiber of my being. It tore my memories, my essence, my very existence down to their fundamental elements and rebuilt them anew, exactly as they were. 

I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve felt fear like that. My subconscious wanted me to unsheath my claws, bare my teeth and fight. But that wouldn’t do anything here. This beast was beyond me, and I couldn’t do anything but try to talk my way out of it.

“It must trade for one of them. What does it have to offer?”

I racked my brain for an answer before saying, “I can feed you! Well, not me, but my boss. I can give you meat, however much you want!”

The critter growled, “What about complimentary fries and drink?”

“Yeah, sure, fuck, whatever!”

“It has done well. Remember this, or it will face Me again.”

The critter dropped me, and I met the ground with my back. I felt the wind get forced out of my lungs, and I laid there for a few seconds before I rose to my feet. When I did get up, I saw the Cook laying face down on the floor, and Adrian still suspended in the air. 

“Marcy? Marceline!” he cried as the critter lifted him up, “Marceline, what have you done to me?”

I didn’t bother answering his question. I put the Ball Buster in the hip of my pants, grabbed the Cook by the arms, and dragged him out of the basement back upstairs. 

Once the door to the cavern was closed, I didn’t hear Adrian’s screams anymore.

Was that wrong of me to do? Maybe. Do I particularly care? No. Adrian died within the property line. In a few days (at most a week), he’d be back to work as a full time employee! The Cook, however, was less grateful that I saved his life. When he regained consciousness, he took the Ball Buster from me and stored it back in his bag alongside the other weapons and shit that he kept in there. Not even a fucking “thank you” from that guy. What a dick. 

When I came into work the next day, I saw Adrian’s ghost manifest in the parking lot. It took him a second to regain his bearings, and once he stopped screaming he looked around in disbelief. It was kind of funny watching him pat himself down, like he didn’t know the rule about dying within the property line. 

I waved at him. He glared at me.

“I fucking hate you, Marcy.” 

I shrugged, “Take it up with management.”

He tried to protest. Said something about how I shouldn’t have left a fellow human employee down there in the hands of the leviathan. I didn’t even pretend to know what he was talking about. I haven’t been human in quite some time, after all.

The Cook was back at his usual station, and the boss was waiting for me at the register. Adrian walked in behind me a few seconds later, still cursing at the top of his lungs.

“-and you’re always like this you fucking god damn sociopathic piece of garbage, god, fuck, why the fuck did you do this to me, I can’t ever fuckin go home, my son of a bitch neighbor is gonna loot my apartment and its-”

The boss held his hand up and Adrian stopped rambling. The boss jerked his head behind him, to the crew room, and Adrian sulked away. 

The boss put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a huge thumbs up paired with a wide grin. 

“Heard you took care of the critter! Good job, I knew you could do it.”

I shrugged again. No sense in being a braggart about it, “I did what I had to. You’re okay with losing a few couple pounds of meat every month, right?”

The boss’s grin faded a bit, “A couple… pounds?”

“And fries.”

“Ugh.”

“And drinks.”

“Seriously?”

“Look man, it was either that or the Cook. I know who your priority personnel are. Can I just please get a fucking ‘thank you’ for once?”

“You know what, you’re right. Thank you.”

“And a raise, maybe?”

“You know what? No.”

I shrugged again, “Can’t blame me for trying.”

He left after that, and business continued as usual. Well, as usual as things get around here, anyway. 

All things considered, it wasn’t a bad week. Sure, Adrian got killed, and he’s been yapping about how he’s going to “expose me” over the internet or whatever. But who’s going to believe him over me? It’s not like he can find anything really concrete about my past after all. Nothing really believable, anyway. 

A fair word of warning though, one that I’ve mentioned in the beginning of this post and I feel I need to put here again to reiterate: Adrian Nelson did, in fact, die on March 3rd. Ever since then his immortal soul has been bound to this restaurant, and he’s not legally unable to use death as an excuse to miss work. 

That said, I have been seeing another Adrian outside of the building sometimes late at night. He doesn’t say anything, he doesn’t do anything. He just smiles and waves. When I get close to him, he bolts for the highway. Haven’t been able to tell what his deal is yet, but it’s just something to look out for. 

So that’s what it’s like to work at Cannibal Chin’s. Doesn’t sound too bad, right? If you want to apply, consider filling in for Adrian’s spot. I’m sure he’d appreciate some time off to haunt or whatever it is ghosts do when they’re not fucking with people. 

I could certainly use someone more human to talk to.

-Best regards, Marcy
