A couple of nights ago I woke up to go to the bathroom. When I came back to my room I noticed some movement. I pulled the curtain back to reveal what appeared to be something standing outside my window. I could barely see anything in the dim moonlight but it looked like some sort of animal? I blinked and it was gone. In the morning I tried to convinced myself it must’ve been a dream since my bedroom window is on the second story, a good 15ft off the ground. I ate breakfast and left for work.

During my drive I couldn’t shake this eerie feeling. I became lost in my head trying to wrap my mind around the events from the night before when BAM. I heard a loud crash and my car began to spin out, I gained control and slammed on the breaks. My windshield was shattered and blood covered. I cautiously opened my door to see what I had hit. It was a deer. The impact seemed to have killed it immediately but this deer was the weirdest i’ve ever seen. I know this may sound strange, but it didn’t have a head. The neck and head were gone, leaving a gaping hole where its organs and insides were visible. I looked around for a bit seeing if maybe the impact caused some sort of decapitation. Alas I found nothing.

 I called my boss and told him I wasn’t able to make it to work, called a tow truck, animal services for clean up and then got a ride home. I tried to watch some tv to calm down but all I could think about was that fucking deer. I didn’t end up doing much that day but everything seemed to be back to normal the next morning. Then came nightfall…

I got home from work and began to do some house chores. I took out the trash and noticed something odd next to the house. Hoof prints. Right under my bedroom window. It was hard for me to fall asleep that night. I couldn’t stop thinking about all the weird things that have happened in the last couple days. Then I saw it. A pair of antlers passed by my window. I hid behind the curtain and tried to get a peek but once again there was nothing there. Just me peering down into the empty lawn.

Fast forward to tonight. I decided to take my dog (Oakley) for a walk. About 10 minutes in the streetlights came on as the sun began to set. I swore I could hear something walking behind me but every time I turned around, nothing was there. I looked one last time and Oakley looked with me. He immediately began to hang his head and whine towards the ground. Fear shot through my spine as my dog has never been afraid of anything, let alone what looks like nothing? I picked up the pace and hurriedly made my way back to my house. 

Once in the door Oakley made a run for the bedroom and darted under the bed. I followed after him and set myself up under the covers. It’s a few hours later now and he’s been there since. As i’m writing this I can hear something breathing outside my window, I think it’s whispering my name. I’m too scared to look. I’m gonna try to sleep and hope everything will be normal again in the morning.
