Quick question, has anyone here or anyone they know dealt with a stain that won't go away, and it almost seems like It transfers onto your skin? I know it sounds weird and I probably phrased that wrong but a week ago I noticed a spot on my couch and I've tried everything to clean it up. Baking soda, vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, bleach, you name it I've probably used it, and nothing seems to work. So I just gave up, and then a couple days ago I noticed a small spot on my left forearm that looks like that stain on my couch, just a smaller version of it. Looks like a tiny black oval just about the size of a dime, almost looks like I bruised myself. I know it's probably just in my head but I'm starting to get a little freaked out because. I swear I can feel it moving in my arm. I'm probably just going crazy, but has anyone experienced something like this or something similar to this before? 

I checked online and all I got was the usual “you're probably gonna die in a couple of days" results.  I'm just sitting waiting in the doctor's office now just trying to kill some time before I get called up. But now I'm just sitting here thinking about how this all started and writing it down, I mean that stain could have absolutely nothing to do with my arm but it just feels like a weird coincidence.  I can't even remember spilling anything on the couch. I could have and forgotten about it but I rarely drink let alone eat on my couch. It just sort of showed up one day, I was cleaning up my place to have some friends over to play some games and then later in the night watch The Blob. And after thinking I was done cleaning everything up I went out, grabbed some snacks, came back and went out by the coffee table to put the snacks out. That's when I saw it on the couch, I was super confused because I had just vacuumed right by the couch and didn't notice it. And it's a pretty big stain, it looks like someone took a chunk of charcoal and started rubbing it into my couch. I tried getting it off with some cleaner and a rag and nothing happened. I tried cleaning it up before my friends arrived but I couldn't get it out and it's still on my couch. It didn't even transfer onto the rags I was using, It was just odd. 

Then I was out in my living room on my computer and while I was typing I saw a dark spot on my arm. I thought at the time I might have bruised it or something might have gotten on my arm at work. And only  noticed the odd resemblance of the spot on my arm and the stain on my couch by the end of that day. But last weekend my arm started to feel weird. It felt like it was asleep at first, but from then to now it feels completely numb from my elbow down to my thumb. But the only thing I can really feel in between those points is that spot. And when I tried to touch that spot on my arm it burned, it felt like I had just put hand sanitizer or salt in an open wound. And I started cussing up a storm and that's when I scheduled an appointment immediately with my doctor and I haven't touched it since. Just got my name called. I'll update this or make another post when I get back home.
