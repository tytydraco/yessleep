Hi everyone. I just started working on something that is very dear to me. Unfortunately, no one I know seems to want to take me seriously. I’m hoping some of you will be interested.

I’m from Kentucky, and while we are known for horse racing and Corvette manufacturing, what most people don’t know about is the caves. Kentucky is home to the longest cave system in the world, much of it still unexplored and unmapped. My school field trips took us to the local caves often.

What sparked my interest the most during these field trips was one part of the cave tour they were always sure to include: turning off the lights.

Caves, being underground, need a lot of artificial lighting for a good tour. When these lights are turned off, the darkness is unfathomable.

“When I turn these lights off, hold still, because you won’t be able to see the edges of the trail. Trust me, you don’t want to fall off,” the guide would say. 

With an ominous smile, they’d hit a button on their little remote. The dark would swallow us all up instantly. I’d hold still as a statue, holding my breath, because you truly could not see anything.

Not the edges of the rock formations, the shapes of the people around you, or even your hand inches from your own face.

These moments excited and scared me so thoroughly that I developed an early interest in local Geography. Don’t worry, I won’t bore you with the details. But you’d be surprised by the things the Earth has produced in Kentucky alone. Nature has its disasters everywhere: tornados, hurricanes, avalanches, tsunamis. But Kentucky has holes. Sinkholes eat up backyards, and, notably, Corvettes. My favorite, however, are the Blue Holes.

There are Blue Holes in various places in Kentucky, some in Caves and others in the middle of rivers. The one nearest to me looks similar to a regular pond and is just off a path leading to a watery cave. Most people hear about the Blue Hole once, on the short hike from the visitor center to the entrance of the cave, then forget about it. This is forgivable, but it really is worth a second look. The Blue Hole is special because it is so dark blue that it’s almost black. Also, as far as anyone knows, it’s bottomless.

Tour guides would explain that there was presumably a bottom to the Blue Hole, but that no one has successfully found it. Various people had tried measurements using comically long tools and dropped items, but nothing quite reached the bottom before proving too short or too difficult to track. One attempt was made with a diver, but when the diver never came up and his body was never recovered, the desire to solve this mystery was quickly diminished from any other curious cats.

Well, I thought, it’s 2025 and about time someone got out there and figured it out. Why not me?

I’m twenty-one and still a student, but I have a pretty good job working the front desk of a hotel part time, so I’ve saved up a bit of money to throw into the Blue Hole project. If I’m being totally honest, I wasn’t really sure where to begin with the measurements part of the whole idea. My eyes glazed over when I read about tools and it was hard work learning the science of it. 

I decided to start with scoping the place out. I knew it was unlikely the staff at the park would give me permission to mess around at the Blue Hole given my lack of credentials. This meant I’d have to sneak about at night and avoid the single ranger that acted as security overnight. I didn’t think it would be too hard not to get caught, but it would be good to know what to expect before bringing too much equipment.

For that first night, I only brought a flashlight, a notebook, and some water in my bag. I drove out to the park, passing the main entrance and parking at a side entrance with a small dog park. I looked around nervously, searching for lights that might indicate the park ranger was nearby, but there was nothing.

I hiked the long way around, avoiding the main entrance and turning off my flashlight every time I heard a noise. I’d underestimated how much my childhood fear of the dark had remained within me. Despite how jumpy and slow-going I was, I eventually found the old wooden sign naming the Blue Hole.

I did a quick three-sixty to make sure I was alone, then turned my flashlight onto the Blue Hole. Little bugs flew around the edges of the water and gathered in the light. They kept clear of the pristine surface of the water. It seemed to be unbothered by any life, any animal or plant, its surface absent of the ripples you normally see across any body of water. 

I was excited by the mysteriousness of it all and proud of myself for working up the nerve to come out there. I ignored the signs warning me not to get close to the water, and walked the perimeter to size it out and find good flat spots near the edge to work off of. I counted the number of steps it took me to walk all the way around, but forgot to write it in my notebook.

I crouched at the side of the water on a piece of rock. I dipped my hands in and was shocked by the cold. I’d once reached my hands in a tank at a museum that claimed to have water the same temperature the titanic sank in, and this was similar. 

I noted this in the journal, stupidly getting water all over it. I wiped my hands on my shirt and got close to the water again, leaning close and shining my flashlight straight down. I searched in the dark water for any sign of, well, anything. It was so dark and still. I held my breath and reached a hand down again, prepared this time for the shock of the water. 

I felt along the edge of the freezing pond, feeling smooth rock and gritty dirt. My flashlight didn’t help much. The water felt slightly warmer about six inches deep, and I scooted closer to the edge to submerge my arm up to the elbow. 

I gasped when I felt something tickle my fingers. I thought for sure it was plants of some sort, and spread my fingers to explore it further.

Whatever it was intertwined suddenly with my fingers and pulled.

It was wet and warm between my fingers, like muscular slugs. It was also very strong. I dug into the ground with my knees and toes and scraped at the edge of the pond with my free hand as my face went under water.

I got one surprised breath before being pulled in and held it. The plant-slug-thing gripping my hand yanked left and right as I twisted my ankle around a tree root to stay somewhat onshore. It lightened its grip and retreated slowly, clearly done with me.

I scrambled backwards and gasped for air, terrified and with pain in my chest. I didn’t look behind me as I ran all the way back to my car. 

I sat in the car, shaking with adrenaline, and pulled out my notebook. My arm hurt like it’d been stretched too far, but there were no marks.

Every part the water touched was smeared and illegible. I sighed and ripped those pages out, copying what I remembered onto dry pages. Then I used it to help me write this for you all.

I’m definitely not going back alone, but this whole experience has made me want to know even more what the deal is with the Blue Hole. It seems like I’m discovering something wholly new, not just putting my name behind a measurement.

I’m still looking for a partner, but I’m hoping to get back out there as soon as possible. So far, everyone has been either mad at me for screwing around in a national park or just thought I was pulling their leg about the stuff in the water. 

In the meantime, any advice about how to investigate further without dying or getting caught?
