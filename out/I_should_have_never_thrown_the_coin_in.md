The fog on Clinton Road hung thick and oppressive, wrapping around my car like a suffocating shroud. The dim glow of my headlights barely pierced the mist as I drove, the road twisting and curving like it was pulling me deeper into something I didn’t fully understand. The stories had been clear—the ghost boy of Clinton Road, a spirit who lingered beneath the old bridge, collecting coins tossed into the water. Some people claimed he was a lost child, others said he was something darker, something *hungry*.

But I was curious. Too curious.

I parked my car beside the old stone bridge, its arched silhouette looming like a doorway to nowhere. The wind whispered through the trees, carrying with it a biting chill that crawled under my skin. I could feel the weight of the stories pressing down on me, the legend swirling in the back of my mind.

*Throw a coin in, and the boy will return it.*

I pulled a quarter from my pocket and held it tightly in my palm. The water below was black and still, reflecting the pale moonlight. My breath came out in small clouds, mixing with the fog, as I approached the edge of the bridge.

The moment I threw the coin, a shiver ran down my spine, and I stood still, watching the surface of the water. There was a faint splash as the coin hit the water, but then—nothing. I waited. The wind grew colder. The air felt heavy, like the earth itself was holding its breath. But then, a soft ripple spread across the water. A small hand shot up from the dark depths, pale as bone, slender fingers wrapping around the coin and pulling it back down, deeper into the water.

*It’s him.*

A figure emerged from the mist, pale and thin, a child—no, a ghost. He was barefoot, his clothes ragged and old-fashioned, his hair dark and wet, clinging to his face like it had been there for years. His eyes were wide, too wide, almost empty, his face like a mask of sorrow and hunger.

I took a step back, my heart pounding in my chest. The boy didn’t move, just stared at me, his hollow gaze locking onto mine. There was something wrong about him—something in the way he stood, something in the air that felt… *off*. Then, in a voice that echoed from deep within the earth, he whispered, “*You threw it... but it’s mine now.*”

The words slid under my skin, cold and sharp, but I couldn’t look away. My legs felt rooted to the spot, my breath quickening. I didn’t know what was happening, but I was beginning to understand that this wasn’t some harmless game.

Suddenly, there was a soft rustling, a whisper of movement. Another hand broke the surface of the water, then another, and another. They were small, pale hands—just like the boy’s—and they began to rise from the water, pale and thin, reaching up toward me. I felt their coldness even before I saw their faces. The boy stepped forward, his eyes still locked on mine, and I felt the air grow colder, heavier. “*You threw it... you took what wasn’t yours. You’ll never leave.*”

The ghostly figures were closing in, their hands reaching for me, their eyes dark and hollow. The fog thickened, and the sounds of the world outside the bridge disappeared, as if I were slipping into some other place, a place where time didn’t matter, where things from beyond the grave reached out and claimed those who dared to disturb them. My pulse raced, panic flooding my system. *I needed to get out of here. Now.*

With a sudden burst of instinct, I stepped back, but my foot slipped on the wet stone. The cold, clammy fingers of the spirits brushed against my arm, and the world tilted—my legs crumpled beneath me, sending me sprawling toward the edge of the bridge. I braced myself for the fall into the dark water below, but something—*someone*—grabbed my arm.

The boy.

His grip was ice-cold, sending a shock of frozen fear through my body. His fingers dug into my skin like claws, pulling me closer to the edge, to the water, to the waiting hands of the others. I gasped, struggling, trying to pull away, but the boy’s grip only tightened, and his mouth parted, revealing teeth that were too sharp, too jagged to be real. "Leave!" I managed to choke out, my voice hoarse with fear.

He didn’t answer. Instead, his fingers began to tighten, dragging me toward the cold embrace of the water. The faces of the other children, pale and twisted with decay, hovered just behind him, their mouths open, whispering my name over and over, a chorus of endless voices. But then, in a flash of clarity, I remembered something. Something from the stories.

*The coin.*

It had all been about the coin. If the boy returned it, if he took it back, the curse was lifted. But if I took it—if I kept it—then I would belong to him, just like the others. The moment the thought crossed my mind, I reached into my pocket. My fingers fumbled for the quarter I had brought with me—the same one I had thrown in. It was still there, cold and wet, resting at the bottom of my pocket. With a surge of determination, I pulled it out and held it up in front of the boy.

“Take it.”

For a brief moment, the boy stopped moving, his hollow eyes fixed on the coin. His grip on my arm loosened slightly, just enough for me to yank my arm away. I held the coin out in front of me, but the boy didn’t make a move for it. Instead, he looked at it, then back at me, as though contemplating whether to take it or not. And then, without warning, the other hands from the water reached up and grabbed my legs, pulling me back toward the edge. I screamed, thrashing in their grip, but I wouldn’t let go of the coin.

With everything I had left in me, I hurled the quarter into the water as hard as I could. It flew through the air, spinning like a silver star, and disappeared into the darkness below. For a moment, everything went still.

The hands receded, vanishing back into the water. The boy’s grip loosened completely, and he stepped back, his eyes never leaving mine. And then, just like that, he was gone. The mist rolled back, the cold lessening, the bridge suddenly quiet again.

I didn’t wait to see if it was real. I didn’t wait for the boy to return, or for the water to ripple again. I ran back to my car, my heart still pounding in my chest, my breath ragged and frantic. As I sped away, my headlights cutting through the fog, I couldn’t help but glance in the rearview mirror.

The boy was standing at the edge of the bridge, watching me. His hollow eyes gleamed in the distance, but he didn’t follow. He didn’t move.

The coin was gone, and the curse had lifted. But I knew one thing for certain: Clinton Road would never let me forget what happened. And the ghost boy would always be there, waiting for the next soul foolish enough to throw something in.

As I drove away, I realized the scariest part wasn’t the boy or the ghostly hands reaching from the water. It was the thought that there would always be another coin, another night. Another person who thought they could escape.
