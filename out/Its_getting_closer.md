I live in a small town near the woods. When i was little i used to be a very disobedient child. I never wanted to eat the veggies or clean up my toys. I also didnt want to go to sleep like other children used to go so i threw a tamper tantrum almost every day before going to bed just so i could stay up later. Biggest mistake of my life.

One day when i was 7 my parents just managed to calm me down and get me ready for bed. The clock on my night stand read 11:27 and i still wasnt tired. I wanted to do anything other then sleep so i opened one of my coloring books and started coloring. After what felt like an eternity i felt tired and went to sleep. The clock read 11:58.

Just as i found my teddy bear and tucked myself in a blood curling scream ripped through the silent night. Too far away for it to be from downstairs where my parents were but too near for it to be deep in the woods. The echo off it rang through the night like a forgotten memory. I squeezed my teddy and tried to sleep but couldnt.

The next night it happened again. The screaming at midnight exactly. The day after it all repeated again. And then the cycle continued for a month. I couldnt sleep, went to do something, went to bed, the screaming started at midnight. Even if i managed to fall asleep i would wake up a minute before and hear it ripple through the night. I was to scared to ask anyone what was that scream because then theyd know i wasnt sleeping.

Few weeks later i was on a birthday party with my friends. The 10 of us were playing in the garden and the night started to fall. I had an unusual feeling that someone was watching me. No not someone, something. I turned around and watched closely into the woods. And thats when i saw it.

Black sleezy body dripping ink onto the ground. Skeletal arms too long for a human body. And the face still haunts me today. Black ink spilling into the eyesockets, its eyes non existent. The smile too creepy not to think about. The teeth razor sharp dripping the same ink from all over the body. It raised one arm and waved. My stupid 7 yo ass smiled and waved back. The party continued and noone noticed anything but as i looked back into the woods i could still see it watching us. Watching me.

When i came home that night the screaming stopped. There was silence for the first time in a long while. I managed to fall asleep after midnight and i never heard that scream again.

Until a week ago.

It woke me up again and for a split second there was silence before it started. It was even worse than i remembered. But it didnt end there.

Every night the screaming became louder, making it impossible to sleep again after that. And there is nothing i can do. Noone to tell. My parents are dead now and im all alone in this house. It scares me to even think about the Thing.

The only thing i can do is dread the day when that scream is mine.
