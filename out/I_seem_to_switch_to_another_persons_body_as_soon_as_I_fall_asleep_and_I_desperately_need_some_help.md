My life is usually pretty good. I'm a lawyer, I live in an average-sized 2-story house, I drive a Porsche 993, have a lot of friends, all that stuff. All of it comes with one twist: every night, instead of a dream, I wake up in an actual person's body. 



I wake up in an unknown room, in a place I'd only assume is in America, due to daylight being visible through the single small window in the room. I wake up sitting on a couch. The room is very small, with a little kitchen with a very old fridge, a plasma TV on an old television stand, a small toilet, a bathtub and the old couch. The person I wake up as is an approximately 25-year-old ginger female, missing both legs and the left arm, and almost without contact with the outside world, a detail which I'll explain on more because it will be crucial. There is no door in the room; only a small trapdoor through which I assume my food gets delivered. 



All of that would be manageable if the sleep schedules lined up, but sometimes I am this person for multiple days before finally somehow switching back. The Tuesday before the last one, I woke up as this person, and I'm still in her body as of now. The previous time this happened, which lasted about two days all of my belongings, including my beloved Porsche, were still in the same place as I left them in. The steering wheel was turned to the same position; about 1/3 of a circle to the left. My client's documents, which I had left on the driver seat, were still placed as I had left them. Even my social media accounts were untouched, without even a trace of activity. Same as my browser history. However, the same can't be said about the mysterious woman's activity; I see searches which I don't remember, I saw her Reddit comments which I hadn't made. I'm usually very squeamish about my privacy and image so I tend not to post any comments which could leave me with a bad reputation, so it could be that. 



Now, as I said, the woman which I woke up as has almost zero contact with anything or anybody outside. Key word; almost. The only trace of any contact outside the room is her old Samsung Galaxy phone. Through it, I'm writing this post as a call for help. My Reddit account was suspended two weeks ago and a friend of mine told me I could share his account strictly to surf, or call for help in a case of urgency. 



I have found absolutely nothing relating to her identity or the identities of anybody related to her. As a matter of fact, I have seen not a single person anywhere. Not even anyone opening up that trapdoor I have mentioned, it just opens up ever so slightly to let the can of ramen noodles I eat slide through. The can is unmarked so I still don't know where I wake up exactly. 



Can anybody here help me out with some advice? I really want this madness to end, and with reality checks, I have concluded that this is not a dream.
