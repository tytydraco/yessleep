[My dog tried to kill me. Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/19dew2p/my_dog_tried_to_kill_me/)

It’s been about six months since Sparky.  
  
During that time, I’ve started therapy. I’m exercising more. I’ve stopped drinking. The forearm has healed from my attack, thankfully - but it left me with a gnarly scar that is going to be a constant reminder of what happened.  
  
I don’t talk about Sparky during therapy, if you were wondering. I had thought long and hard about how to approach that period of my life and to be honest, telling my therapist that my dog (I hate calling it that) tried to kill me, I felt like it’d be a one-way trip to medication city.  
  
Hell, maybe that’s what I need. I think about the lost time and how I can’t remember Sparky getting into my life. I just remember waking up one morning and something else was behind the wheel. I wasn’t in control during most of that time.  
  
That’s something I’ve brought up - the therapist likes to cycle back to my drinking during that time and the trauma of the breakup, the first real man I ever was vulnerable with. I was low, yeah, I can’t deny that. I turned to booze and pot. Sue me. As much as I feel like there were supernatural influences, my therapist swears it was the combination of the depression and the booze.  
  
It may have been.  
  
Sparky may have just been a regular dog and I may have tried to kill myself those nights.  
  
Or he’s something else that preyed on me like the predator he was. Sniffed me out like the dog he pretended to be and took his literal bone.  
  
I want it to have been just a drunk bender.  
  
But I don’t think it was. I don’t think he left.  
  
I had mentioned I still hear growls at night. At first, I had thought, hey, just some PTSD. It’ll likely happen. There were a couple of times, I swear to God, I saw his eyes looking at me from the foot of the bed.  
  
I’ll make it clear that my bedroom window does face a busy road - it’s could’ve been headlights. All of this could’ve been just figments of my imagination.  
  
I tried to convince myself the eyes I saw were headlights, even when I closed the blinds and still saw them. I worked very hard to try to rationalize the sudden feeling of pressure on the sheets as gusts from an open window - and later, when the windows were closed, I just thought, hey, old drafty apartment. Surely Sparky isn’t still here.  
  
But I think he left his scent on me.  
  
About a month after Sparky disappeared, I tried to adopt a cat. Many people in my life insisted that I fill the hole that Sparky left, that I couldn’t possibly be happy on my own after my precious little angel ran off. If they only knew.  
  
This time, I made sure to make the humane society appointment myself, one town over, of my own free will.  
  
I was there for about only 20 minutes.  
  
According to the lady at the front desk, it’s almost as if the second I pulled into the lot, all hell broke loose. The dogs started barking non-stop, aggressive barking, even the quiet ones. As I tried to talk over the barking at the front desk and sign papers, I saw multiple staff rush towards the kennels - something was wrong.  
  
I quickly got shuffled to wear they kept the cats as the commotion got louder. An obviously hurried, slightly worried staff member rushed me through the rules of the cat enclosure before putting me inside of the room, stealing glances back at the dog kennel as the barking just wouldn’t stop.  
  
I didn’t get three feet inside before I was attacked. At first, it was a large black cat, hiding upon a cat tree I hadn’t noticed - it swiped and drew blood from my right temple. A second cat, an orange tabby, latched itself to my left knee, growling - I didn’t even hesitate.I grabbed it by the back of its neck and tossed it towards the other cats, who I all noticed were hunched up, in the attack position.  
  
There were at least 12 cats in that room and every single one wouldn’t turn away from me.  
  
I darted out of the room and locked the door, and looked for the staff member who had abandoned me. He rushed back into the room, covered in blood, and told me I had to leave. I didn’t question it.  
  
I later found out that something had whipped the dogs into such a frenzy that some had begun attacking each other. Once staff had tried to intervene and separate the dogs, the dogs had turned their attention to them. One person died while two others were sent to the hospital for critical injuries.  
  
Apparently it doesn’t look good for the dogs.   
  
Then, I got attacked at night.  
  
Ever since Sparky and the last visit to the humane society, I avoid animals. Thankfully, with my job as a bartender, I tend to keep a late schedule - and part of that includes night jogs. Exercise was something that I could control, and it gave me confidence again. It made me want to date again.  
  
It was October, around 2 am. Leaves were dense on the ground and the air was crisp, but I loved it. Cold weather running was the best - it felt very primal to me and meditative. I live in northwestern Indiana, close to a variety of nice bike paths and nature trails - don’t let people tell you there’s nothing out here. It can be very pretty on occasions, and this October night was one of those occasions.  
  
I had my reflective gear on, and my small arm light. I’m not stupid to the dangers - vehicular as well as physical. I never leave without a small switchblade when I run. Even prior to Sparky, I’ve read too many horror stories of people getting mugged while jogging. Not me, sir.  
  
I was on a lit section of the main town square, about three miles into my usual five. I was close to my apartment, and always slowed down during this part of the main town square. I enjoyed the scenery and the quietness of what’s usually a noisy, crowded downtown.  
  
I managed to hear the sound of something chasing me almost instantly. I don’t wear my headphones for this reason alone. I don’t look back. I speed up. I have about three or four blocks of downtown to get through before I reach my apartment.  
  
I make the mistake of glancing behind myself to see what it is and that’s when I fell. My foot caught an uneven part of the curb and I toppled face first into the damp street. My forearm catches a bit of the fall, unfortunately, and I scream in pain.  
  
I hear the thing gaining on me. I roll over and face it, and only get a glimpse of it before it latches onto my leg, in the same precise area where Sparky had attacked me during the fire.  
  
It looked like some poorly defined coyote - definitely canine in appearance, but it gave such an unsettling feeling of it being slightly wrong somehow, like the dimensions were off. Its eyes glowed bright red, and I distinctly remember the foam in its mouth.   
  
It had the exact same gnarled ears that Sparky had. I know I sound crazy but Sparky was the perfect looking golden retriever, save for those gnarled, deformed ears. This coyote-thing had the exact same ones. I was more or less constantly afraid since it had attacked me the first time - but now I felt deeper fear than I ever had before.  
  
It held me in its mouth, staring me down, and that’s when I saw the approaching headlights.  
  
It bit harder. I had to act. I yanked the switchblade out of my zipper pocket, flicked it open, and brought it down into its eye. I saw blood began to gush out of the eye, and I swear to you it hissed when it hit the pavement. It didn’t bark, but it roared - and then it disappeared, blade and all, into the shadows. I hear the approaching car honk its horn and slam its brakes. I roll, and if I was even a second late, I would’ve died.  
  
The car called me an ambulance. I was treated for a rabies shot, bandaged up, and sent on my way. I didn’t say anything about seeing Sparky again, or that I suspected whatever Sparky was couldn’t get rabies. The doctor did tell me however to ease up on the running until I’m healed fully - and he’s not kidding. I feel like it’ll come back to me eventually, but I cannot do it right now and that’s one of the worst feelings in the world for me. It was a sense of joy and it genuinely made me so happy to hit the pavement.  
  
Sparky knew it. He knew that if I didn’t die that night from the car, that I wouldn’t be able to run. I suspect the injury would’ve been much worse had I not had my switchblade on me. It showed me two things.  
  
First, Sparky can be surprised.  
  
Secondly, trying to take my running from me was personal.  
  
Three weeks later, I meet Tyler.  
  
While running and intense cardio is out of the question, I make do with weight-lifting and enjoy it. I show progress. I’m there one day, wearing a simple Kirby shirt, earphones in, when this blonde, skinny bespectacled guy said hi. He liked my shirt. We talked briefly about Nintendo and went back on our way.  
  
Then, as it happens with gym regulars, you talk a little more and more each time. We had more in common than we thought. He invited me out to coffee one evening. We hit it off. I’m thinking I just made a new friend, which was apparently something I needed.  
  
I deeply, deeply craved that sense of normal.  
  
I’m a big dumb idiot, however, and it took me way too long to realize that this was more than platonic. Tyler made his move on the third date, some silly little Will Ferrel movie, by holding my hand about halfway through. I may be a little dense, but I’m not blind. We kissed outside of the theater that evening for the first time.  
  
Two more dates go by. I feel better than I have in years. I think about Sparky less and less.   
  
I am vulnerable with him. I don’t tell him about Sparky, but I do mention that animals don’t like me, gesturing to my scars. He’d always smile that disarming, beautiful smile and tell me I just haven’t met the right one.  
  
We go to a movie and a dinner. He asks me to come back to his place.  
  
On the way there, he holds my hand and his face gets serious.  
  
“Greg,” he says. “I just want you to know that I have a dog. I didn’t really know how to approach it… after you told me what happened, I freaked out a bit and didn’t say anything.”  
  
I felt my stomach drop. I instinctively reached for the car handle. I clocked how fast we were going. I could survive that roll. Tyler saw me tense, and pulled over.  
  
“Look,” he says, staring into my eyes. His hands hold mine. “I’ve had him since I was a kid. He’s the sweetest, most gentle labrador you’d ever meet. I know you’re afraid - if we go there and it’s too much, I understand… I like you a lot, Greg, and I want to give this a shot.”  
  
I try to tell him that it’s not me, necessarily. Pets do not like me, full-stop.  
  
He assures me his will.  
  
I think of my therapist and what she’d say. Exposure therapy for fear or some new-age bullshit. I look at Tyler and I nod my head.  
  
Before I know it, we’re outside his apartment.  
  
“He may get a bit excited,” Tyler says, turning the lock. “Bullet, I’m home!”   
  
He twists the doorknob  
  
I hear the shuffling behind the door.  
  
The hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I get dizzy.  
  
The door opens, and Tyler bends over, petting the excited labrador. I hear him call him a good boy.  
  
Tyler steps to the side and the labrador leaps up at me, wagging its tail the entire time, trying to kiss me.  
  
It’s the first dog to be friendly to me since Sparky.  
  
That’s because it’s not a dog, I realize with horror. I first noticed the scar around its eye, the same eye I stabbed the coyote in. Then I saw those unforgettable, bent, crooked ears, just like Sparky’s.  
  
My back touches the wall, and I pass out.
