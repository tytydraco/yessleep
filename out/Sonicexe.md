It was a dark and stormy night, and John was feeling particularly bored. He had been scrolling through the internet for hours, looking for something to do, when he stumbled upon a mysterious website. It was called "The Cursed Game Room," and it claimed to have all sorts of strange and exotic games that no one had ever heard of before.

Intrigued, John clicked on the link and was taken to a page with a list of games. One game in particular caught his eye: Sonic.exe. It was a platformer game that featured everyone's favorite blue hedgehog, but there was something about it that seemed off. The game's icon was distorted and twisted, and the description claimed that it was "cursed."

Despite the warning, John couldn't resist the temptation. He downloaded the game and launched it, eager to see what kind of curse it might have.

At first, everything seemed normal. The game played just like any other Sonic game, with John running and jumping through levels, collecting rings and defeating enemies. But as he played, strange things started to happen. The music became distorted and unsettling, and the graphics started to glitch and flicker.

John tried to quit the game, but no matter how many times he pressed the "exit" button, the game wouldn't close. It was as if it had a mind of its own, refusing to let John go.

As he continued to play, the game became more and more nightmarish. The levels became twisted and haunted, filled with demonic creatures and grotesque imagery. And the more he played, the more he felt as if he were being watched by something unseen.

John began to feel like he was losing his mind. He couldn't tell what was real and what was just a part of the game. He started seeing strange images and hearing strange voices even when he wasn't playing. He became convinced that the game was trying to possess him, to take control of his body and his soul.

He tried to tell his friends and family about what was happening, but they just thought he was hallucinating or going crazy. No one believed him, and he was left to face the horror alone.

As the days went by, the game's hold on John grew stronger. He became more and more isolated, spending all of his time playing Sonic.exe. He stopped eating and sleeping, and he became a shell of his former self.

One night, John's friends broke into his apartment and found him sitting in front of his computer, completely unresponsive. They tried to pull him away from the game, but it was too late. John was already gone, his mind and soul consumed by the cursed game.

To this day, no one knows what happened to John. Some say he's still trapped in the game, forced to play for eternity. Others believe that he was possessed by the game itself, and that he now haunts the internet, searching for other unsuspecting victims to trap in its cursed world.

Whether it's true or not, one thing is certain: no one who plays Sonic.exe ever escapes unscathed.
