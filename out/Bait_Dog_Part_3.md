For anyone who wants to see how I got into this situation.

“In what universe would I ever do you a favor? “ I say, sweeping the floor of the reinforced barn. 

“It’s not a favor, it’s a trade, bud. 

What do you want in return? “ Trenchcoat asks from within the coffin-like cage. 

“To be back home, 8 months ago. “ I reply. 
 
Over the past few weeks I’ve managed to integrate myself into the day to day life on the farm. Things are still a grim, horrifying slog, but with every day it gets a bit easier to deal with. 

“Give me something I can do. “ The creature pleads. 

“Why, so I can wind up on the end of another ‘ Gotcha’ moment? I’m good. “ is my answer. 

A few minutes of silence go by, Augustus breaks it. 

“I don’t know many secrets of the universe. Facts, not really my bag. But I know a couple. 

How about I share one with you? 

No one, not the pope, not my brother, not the shit-bird perched on the highest branch of my twisted family tree, knows what happens when you die. 

Some of us never will, of course. Others have ways of avoiding it, but at the end of the day, when the lights truly go out, we know next to nothing. 

We do know one thing though. There is judgement, by who? Who knows? Why? Not important. 

But at the end of the day, if your battery can’t be recharged, you really want to be thinking about how many marks are on each side of the ledger. “ 

I don’t reply, and for the next hour or so I ignore the pleading and hinting Trenchcoat does. 

But that night, as I sip acidic tea, and try to get a handle on how in the fuck old televisions function, his offer is at the forefront of my mind. 

He wants to kill, specifically 6 teenagers who, according to him, have been murdering classmates yearly in a twisted ritual. 

He wants me to think this is some kind of noble act, he frames it as almost superheroic. The evil prick knows how I feel, knows that I see the blood on my hands every day, and would kill ( possibly literally) for some way to atone. 

Is it a play? I honestly don’t think so, something about how eager the twisted thing is, about how he’s treating the situation as a buyer’s market makes me think something about this makes it important to him. 

He offers me everything besides safety and protection.  I’m desperate for help, but I have no way to hold him to any agreement. 

So the thought rolls around in my mind, staving off the few hours of sleep I get. 



“Okay, so, I have it on good authority that tea is supposed to taste better over here. What the hell is wrong with this? “ I say, sitting around an outside table with Sylvia, Dafydd and Colin. 

Sylvia smiles, “ Barium, calcium, and  a touch of castor oil. “

I look at the brew, then at her. 

“If I had told you when you got here you need to drink that to mitigate the effects of working with void touched objects and creatures, you’d have assumed the worst, and found a way to avoid drinking it. 

Good to see you becoming more perceptive though. “ Sylvia explains. 

“That’s called paranoia, Syl. “ I reply. 

She laughs, lighting a cigarette. 

“Do you know why I’ve let you figure things out on your own? “ The ancient woman asks. 

“Accepted? Yes. Understood, not in the slightest. “ I answer, wondering what sadist invented the scone. 

“It’s because I need a leader. Someone who can understand, not  a boy  who puts his head down and listens to orders. 

Someone who can make their own decisions when the time comes. 

And I think that time is coming soon. “ Her statement feels like a question. 

“If I chose to be here I’d be honored.” I counter. 

“That attitude on the other hand… needs work. 

Nikolas, today, we talk about what’s really going on. 

We play a role in a much larger organization, us, and other families like us, are the ‘boots on the ground’ so to speak. 

Our job is not to capture creatures, or horde esoteric goods. We do not foil the schemes of demons, nor blind those who look too deeply into the abyss. 

We’re given information about events that could steer the path of humanity into a brick wall. And  our job is to make sure they don’t happen. “ Sylvia reveals. 

“Something is happening with these fights? “ I ask. 

“As I said, perceptive. 

Yes, it could be next week, it could be in a decade or two. Right now, we know very little about it, other than  when it  happens, it would be in our best interests to be of a high standing in the pits. “ She replies. 

I absorb the information, and t drug laced tea in equal measure. As I do, I feel something, I feel I’m a part of what’s going on. 

This is going to sound dumb as hell, but up until this point I hadn’t been taking things seriously. Don’t get me wrong, death is on the table, and I was trying to avoid that. But I was just treading water, hoping something or someone came by and to get me out of this situation. 

But as Syl lays things out, I start to think of my place here, what I can be doing to better my state. 

“Here is the part where you avoid telling me why you couldn’t have used anyone around here. “ I prod. 

I keep her gaze, Colin and Dafydd shift uncomfortably. 

“Augustus, he’s a tricky one. But a very lucky find for us. 

I’ve tried 2 others. A boy and a girl, both I practically raised. 

Marco, he was a warrior. But the demon got in his head. There was nothing that could be done beyond end his suffering. 

Zelma, I won’t  talk about. 

That thing, it has a way of turning someone’s best traits against them. You, are a blank slate, but you’re family. You’re  my best guess as to how we can use him to our advantage.

And this is why I need you, not to listen, but to understand. To see what’s happening, and make your own decisions. If I were to give you my knowledge, if I were to arm you with the best weapons, and the most powerful esoteric objects I know. He’d just have more to turn against you. “ Sylvia’s revelation scares me and puts a massive weight on my shoulders all at the same time. 



Confidence and fear are both dangerous emotions. The two of them are almost like drugs in a way. 

After eight months of mainlining fear, the tiny line of confidence Sylvia gave me, went straight to my head. 

Trenchcoat told me where to find a video file. And after a couple of weeks of running it through every possible test I could, to check for any kind of manipulation, supernatural or otherwise, I watched it. 

I was confident that the world would be much better off without the people committing the vicious acts contained in those twenty minutes of footage. 


A teenage view of morality, I admit. But what do you want, I’m a teenager. 


We watch the abandoned house from across the street. It’s a dingy, urban blight affected suburb, that being said, how no one seems to notice the seven foot freak with me, I have no idea. 

The kid inside smoking stolen cigarettes and illegally supplied booze is a husky young guy of about 14. The half dozen kids that show up a couple hours later look closer to my age, last couple of years of high school I’m guessing. 

The way they get into the house tells me they’ve done this before. The backpacks they all carry tell me they’re there for a purpose. 

“How fucking funny would it be if I just killed you here and took off? “ Trenchcoat says, looming behind me. 

I tense. 

“It’s a joke. Out of my whole rotten family, Art and I, are close. I’m not going anywhere. 

Unfortunately for you. “ Trenchcoat shoves me to the ground as he walks toward the house. 

We get in through a basement window, I fit easily, Trenchcoat contorts his body to fit through the thin opening, somehow doing so silently. 

I keep hearing Sylvia in my head. Telling me how she needs someone that can make his own decisions. 

As I stand in the litter strewn basement, beside a creature with child murder on it’s mind  I question the decision that I made. 

At first the illumination is dim, nothing more than scraps of moonlight filtered through splintered wood. But with an industrial click, suddenly a half dozen lightbulbs bathe the basement in harsh, yellowish light. 

Harsh, but not harsh enough to cause the reaction I see from Trenchcoat. 

He squints and tries, unsuccessfully to turn away from the lights. Something about them is causing him discomfort.  I get my hopes up for a moment he’s going to burst into flame or turn into dust or something, but no dice. 

The sight of the walking nightmare looking pained and confused makes me panic. But before I can think of how I fucked up, I hear a voice. 

The room, by the sounds of it, the entire house, has been rigged with speakers. Cleverly recessed in sconces and corners. 

“Augi, long time no see. And I see you brought a little Renfield fella with you. “ The voice is modulated, Trenchcoat looks curious for a moment. 

“Who, is this? You that clown that’s been fucking with Art?” He guesses. 

The voice laughs, “Nope. 

Who I am, is a guy who managed to find a few boxes of lightbulbs from ’93. 

Then again, with eBay, that could make me just about anyone. “ 

Trenchcoat turns and looks toward the window we came in. He reaches a hand toward it, stopping a few inches away. 

“That’s fucking interesting. “ He says, eyes darting around the room. 

“Isn’t it though? “ The voice replies, clearly hearing the creature’s whisper, “ Tonight you get the pay for centuries of the worst shit committed by man or beast. I’ve made sure of that. No one in this house is going anywhere for the next 8 hours. 

I’m sure the rest of the houseguests are pretty confused as to what’s going on. You wouldn’t believe me if I told you, so let me give you the Cliff’s notes. 

You kids have been killing a monster a year for half a decade. You were the perfect bait, and I have faith you’ll be able to outwit Augi long enough to make it out of here. 

If not, you’ll still have helped kill one of the worst things to walk the face of the earth. “ 

“What the hell is he talking about? “ I ask, a sinking feeling in my gut. 

“That’s what you’re worried about right now? 

Yeah, these kids are more Scooby gang than Manson family. Don’t blame me for the fact it  only took an out of context exorcism video and some promises of making things right with the universe to get you on board with killing them. “ Trenchcoat spits. 

I feel afraid, stupid and small. Which is to say, lately, business as usual. 

I begin to break lightbulbs, I notice no runes, or anything else that would indicate they have any kind of supernatural origin. 

As the basement dims, Trenchcoat starts to breathe easier. 

“What’s going on, what stopped you from leaving? “ I ask. 

“This little shit is playing The Game. “ Trenchcoat says to himself as much as to me. He looks deep in thought, inspecting the glass from the bulbs. 

“What are you talking about? “ I say, my voice cracking slightly. 

I hear noises upstairs, frantic foot falls. Indecipherable shouting. 

Trenchcoat turns to me, exasperated and filled with anger. 

“You’ve heard of ‘Rules’ right? All that ‘Don’t turn left on East street at 3:24 am kind of shit? “ The creature starts, “More and more of them popping up lately. Can’t miss the things. 

Well, your kind seems great at finding them, but fucking awful at figuring out what they are. It’s not someone’s new job, or creepy school. The answer is so damned simple, but all of you’ve missed it. 

It's a game. It’s, The Game. 

It’s ran by the thickest branches of my family tree, and the stakes are high enough even I don’t really understand. 

And whoever has us here, he’s weaponized it. The crazy fuck. “

“Call on your family for help then. “ I say, starting to deal with the fear and confusion. 

“You first. “ Is Trenchcoat’s reply. 

I get his point, and for a twisted, shitty moment, I find myself relating to the murderous thing I’ve been saddled with. 

“So what’s the plan? “ I ask. 

“Get my hands on whoever’s been stalking me. Between A and B, probably kill those little do-gooders upstairs out of spite. 

I need you to circumvent rules we come across. Humans need to agree to follow the rules, it’s  why people encounter them in jobs and schools so much. I’m not human, if you haven’t noticed. I don’t get a choice. “ I’m shaking my head as Augustus relates his plan. 

“We’re not hurting those kids. “ I say defiantly. 

“I’m sure you’ll have no problem with that. 

But I’m a  God damned  child killing monster, bud! How long is that going to take to sink the fuck in? 

Me not doing what I do, isn’t like giving up smokes. Think of it like  not having a slash for months on end. Sooner or later, like it or not, I’m either finding a bathroom or pissing my pants. “ the rant scares me, but  it makes me think. 

Something about Augustus, it seems very, 90’s. Whoever was on the speakers was talking about the lightbulbs being from ’93. I’m picking up on a very distinct pattern. 

 I file that information with the rest of the disconnected lore I’ve managed to find on Trenchcoat as I follow him up the steep, narrow set of stairs. 

He whips the thin wood door open, taking an aggressive, lurching step into the livingroom beyond. Surely ready to dispense too far quips and limitless violence, as per usual. 

But that doesn’t happen, his rage filled scowl turns into a look of resignation, “Fuck”, is the monster’s last word before he disappears. 

I cautiously walk up the loose splinter ridden stairs, expecting Augustus to be waiting around the corner, or engaged in combat with some other horror. 

But once I get to the top, there’s nothing more sinister than a livingroom covered in dust and graffiti strewn with old bottles and new stains. 

I know my chance when I see it. The particle board sealing the bay window is rotten, the glass long since broken. 

No monster, no crazy family, I’ll take my chances with the streets of the U. K. 

I tap the crumbling wood with a foot, it rattles, it won’t take much to make a hole. 

I line up a kick, freedom no more than a quarter inch of rotten wood away. 

“I wouldn’t do that. “ Says a voice behind me, male, around my age I’d guess, but with a confidence that makes me listen, “ Rigged with a  load of C4 in the window frame.

Don’t take my word for it, guy wasn’t very subtle. ”

Sure enough, I see small wires running along the edges of the frame and embedded in the particle board. 

I turn around, the six people standing in front of me have a vibe I can only describe as severe. 

“Are we going to have issues? “ a slight, dark skinned guy asks. 

“You making threats? “ I reply.  

“No, he isn’t. “ it’s the same voice that warned me about the explosives. It belongs to a squared jawed kid with short black hair, he’s wearing a grey hoodie, and separates himself from the group. “ Call me Kent, and I’m in charge of making  threats. 

Sid, he’s our people person, he’s just trying to see if you’re someone we need to worry about. “

“We don’t  have time to figure this kid out, leave him. “ a short, ginger girl says. 

“Ami, why don’t I stay out of equipment, and you and Kent let me figure this kid out?” Sid says. 

“I’m Nik. “ I volunteer. 

“Good to meet you Nik. “ Sid says, walking around Kent, “Didn’t mean to start things off on the wrong foot. 

We’ve just gotten used to doing these kinds of things in our own way over the past bit. We get a little… weird around this time of year if I’m being honest. “

I nod, apprehensive at giving any kind of detailed response. 

“Derik” says a tall, pale guy, “ Research. “

“Liam. “ a tanned boy in a flannel shirt and deep blue jeans tells me, “ Oxford doesn’t talk, accident a couple of years back. I’m logistics, he figures spooky shit out. “ 

Oxford is thin and bald, his face looks much older than it should. Like he’s the victim of some kind of wasting disease. 

Telling these kids the truth would be, complicated. And something about their war vet demeanor, makes me want to keep things simple. 

So I give them a version of the truth. One where I was plucked from my room by Trenchcoat, and brought here for a slow death. 

They buy it. I think. 

“Well, I don’t know what this Jigsaw wannabe has planned, but trust me when I say, it can’t be much worse than the things we’ve went through. “ Kent says, trying to be reassuring. 

“Just, one more thing. “ Sid begins, “ Why all the scars? “ 

I know I’ve won most of the group over, but I don’t like the look Sid is giving me. 

“Work on a farm, on top of that, the family owns an auction. Lots of bent steel and splinters, what can I say? “ I say, trying to sound casual. 

“Fair enough, that accent though. “ Sid’s look becomes almost predatory as he talks. 

“Immigration my guy. What’s with the third degree? “ I reply. 

“We’ve just met and I’ve only asked three questions. 

Humor me here though. 

You get taken in the night by that thing that winked out of existence. 

Seems pretty nice of him to let you put on shoes. “ Sid lets his statement hang. 

Kent turns, I don’t like where this is going. Panic and fear start to well up. 

“What’re you thinking Sid? “ Kent asks. 

“Kid’s lying. But he’s good at it. “ Sid answers. 

“You saying this has turned into a, me, situation? “ Kent’s question starts a deep pit in my stomach. 

“I don’t know if we need to go that far. But I don’t like the idea of him having seen our faces. I think this is a Liam situation. “ As Sid says this I look to Liam, who already seems deep in thought. 


“Local cops will back our story, but he could go beyond them. 

We tie him up until all of this is done, and we get some video of him putting a blade into the body upstairs. He goes telling any stories, it’s us and the locals versus some Yank on video stabbing the kid. “ Liam suggests. 

I tried to fight, it went, embarrassingly. Kent had me on the ground  in some kind of arm lock in about a second. 



I’m bound to an old wooden chair with electrical cords, dragged into a room on the second floor where the chubby kid from before lays face down in a coagulated pool of his own blood. Surrounded by the trappings of misspent youth. 

The door locks, and I stare at the corpse, wondering what in the hell went on up here, and in what universe are these psychopaths anything other than what they seemed on screen. 

Time becomes almost malleable. I’m terrified to the point where every moment seems to stretch out forever. 

Then, I hear it. A wet, organic noise. It starts below the body, and slowly starts to spread. 

After a minute or two, the body starts to jerk and twitch. The room is dim as hell, but  some kind of ropey, flesh-like substance,  is sealing off the door. 

I watch as the corpse clumsily gets to it’s feet. It’s skin pale, it’s throat slit to the point of near decapitation. 

The head falls backward, obscenely with a small spurt of thick blood. 

I scream, I thought I’d been getting used to being face to face with monsters. But fully bound, inches away from a kid that seems to be filled with a twisting mass of barbed, writhing, intestine like tentacles, I realize I’m not used to shit. 

The ropey mass forms the barest suggestion of features, a shifting, lumpen mass of ever moving tendrils coming from what used to be the kid’s neck. 

The sound spreads more, cracks in the floorboards and walls begin to show hints of the tendrils filling them in like spray foam. 

No one is hearing my screams, or if they are, they have no interest in helping. 

Ever wonder how you’d handle torture? I think if you’re the kind of person to be reading this, it’s likely you have. 

I started by pissing myself. 

The second the thin tendril touches my hand, I feel a blinding, flensing pain. I can do nothing but watch, as  thousands of nearly  hair thin spines tear and consume my flesh. As it slowly, almost, curiously makes it’s way up my arm, it leaves a bloodless, scarred furrow about an eighth of an inch deep. 

My second reaction was to lose any pretense at defiance or dignity. I thrash and scream, beg and offer. All of this turning into choked sobs as the thing starts to do much of the same with another tendril.

It felt like I was in hell, every inch of me nothing more than a canvas for this artist of misery. 

But pain, it can only go so far. Whether we’re talking about my tolerance, or this thing’s interest. 

Mutilation, the brutal wedding of pain and loss. That was it’s next step. 

A thick, almost centipede like tendril sits on my pinky like a hot iron. I can only watch in horror as I see fat, then muscle, then bone, then, nothing. 

My voice shreds, I tear my wrists and ankles trying desperately to break the expertly tied wires. 

My mind is at the breaking point, the creature in front of my makes a terrible, high pitched keening I assume is laughter. 

My body is a roadmap of scarred pits and lines. My hand sports a cleanly severed finger. Fuck me, I wish things ended there. 

Of all the important parts of the human body, the eye, tends to feel the least pain. Which isn’t to say, as I watched the greedy, grasping claws slowly take pieces of one of mine, it didn’t hurt, but the worst part, was knowing what was happening. 

The vision in my left eye begins to distort at first, the edges getting blurry, then going dark. Bit by bit, chunk by irreplaceable chunk, the creature takes half my vision. 

I can feel the shifting air on the bare socket, to call what I’m doing screaming, would be understating things to the point of absurdity. 


My brain reels at what has just happened. I can feel my grip on reality begin to loosen, pain, worse than  can bare, loss of half my sight, it’s too much. 

My brain feels filled with static, for a few brief moments I swear, I can hear someone, a voice, trying to tell me something. 

But then, a smell hits me. Something so foul, so alien, it yanks me back from the brink of disassociation. I gag and choke, as the air becomes thick with the rotten, chemical reek. 

Then, I see it, I see, him. 

As randomly as he disappeared, in an instant Trenchcoat is in the room. 

He’s torn apart, wounds so deep and ragged, I can see the door on the other side of the room through the worst of them. 

One arm is a twisted, broken mess, the flesh jacket torn to shreds of necrotic tissue. 

The look on his face is panic, paranoia. A rictus grin of someone that has been kept on his toes for entirely too long. 

He trembles and heaves, looking like he could fall over at any second. 

He points his good arm at the tendril creature, who I notice has a too familiar eye suspended in it’s shifting features. 

“You wouldn’t happen to know anything about the motherfucker who just made me kill my favorite cousin, would you? “ Trenchcoat asks, his voice cracked, and strained. 

He gets a confused keening in response. 

“Bad day for you then. “ Augustus says. 

There is no style to his violence, Trenchcoat grabs the shifting mass, his wicked, claw tipped fingers angling themselves in tendrils. As he lifts the thing, floorboards break, and it’s torn free from the root-like system it was creating in the room. 

Three brutal slams cover me in ichor and pieces of creature. Trenchcoat tosses the mewling, twitching pile in a corner and looks at me with disgust. 

“You let that thing do this to you? Fuckin’ pathetic, bud. 

And who tied you up? “ The nightmare I’ve been cursed with chides me. 

“The kids downstairs. “ I say only now realizing I’ve still been sobbing. 

One handed, Trenchcoat snaps the wires, then stumbles backward, slowly sliding down the wall. 

He coughs, grey, bloody phlegm hitting the ground. 

“So, what’s the play here? If this shit broke you, I could use the spare parts, if not, well, you know what the Bible says. 

An eye for an eye. “ Trenchcoat grins as he talks, nearly on the brink of death. 

And that’s where I think I’m going to leave things. Because, honestly I don’t know what I’m choosing. 

I’m mutilated, half blind, using too much of my energy typing to strangers online about things because, I’m so fucking alone here. 

If you hear from me again, I hope I made the right move. If not, take this as a lesson on what happens when you screw around with the occult.
