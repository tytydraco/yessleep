Welcome, all those who wind up discovering and reading this, to my terrifying and nightmarish dilemma. I am genuinely hopeful, that all of us as a whole, collectively, may actually be able to identify and perhaps even rid my nights of this creature or entity. The stalking and the staring from the corners, moving between the natural shadows of the house , the creeping about, and moving along the walls or floors in the night. It has become absolutely horrifying, I've even started to experience some sort of paralysis when I try to wake in the night. I hear a sound, or I feel something brush up against my skin, a windy voice whispers into my ear. And when I try to set up, move, or roll over in the bed, I simply cannot. Sometimes it's brief and I see something flash by the corner of my eye in my peripherals. Other times it's lengthy and becomes a living nightmare that is inescapable. Ever since my little brother made a friend of this thing, life has been hell in our house.

&#x200B;

I've already made my run through the usual suspects, to no avail. I talked to a medium, two different, "spiritualists", a parish priest, and I had both of the local paranormal investigation teams that I could find come over and check it out. And they just got nothing at all. REM Pods, Cat balls, spirit boards, a s√©ance, and 5 different Estes method sessions. EVP recording devices and an SLS video camera setup, and absolutely nothing at all. This thing is here for my family, and it's smart enough to know to lay low when others are around. My little brother seems to be its link to enter our home freely, and convincing him that his new friend is bad seems pointless because he just isn't on board with that. He is convinced its his friend, he is one of those kids that's just a bit awkward, and he doesn't have many, if any, real friends here. On top of the fact that we did jut move here a few months ago. He just hasn't had any luck yet making any real friends. And I think that is part of the reason why this thing chose my little brother in the first place.

&#x200B;

I've done my research, I looked into every cryptid from here to Thailand to no avail. I even talked to a somewhat well known cryptozoologist for forty and five minutes over a Skype call. And so that is why I am here now, to lay myself down at the collective feet of all of you amazing, horror and true crime obsessive web sleuths out there. If I'm going to find any kind of answers ore solutions now, I honestly believe it is going to be from the collective minds of all of you wonderful people. I truly do hope and pray that together we can figure this thing out and save my family. I honestly believe my family is in grave danger. I don't know if this thing is after my little brother in the long run, or if it's after my entire family. I don't know if it's making itself out to be a threat to me because it knows that I can see and feel it when it's here, or if it's doing the same to the rest of my family as well. I haven't spoken about it to my parents at all. But my mom is basically a wine-o and three quarters the way to drunk most nights, so I don't know if she would even notice the damn thing unless it punched her in the stomach or something. And my father is gone half the time for work, and he's sleeping or out fishing and stuff like that, when he is home anyway.

&#x200B;

I do believe that my baby sister sees it too though, I'm more than positive of that. It happens all the time now, she will go from being fast asleep or perfectly fine and comfortable, to then, she just bursts into the blood curdling screams and crocodile tears. As if someone or something had just pinched the hell out of her in her sleep, or just stood there, a stinking, horrid, monstrous face, just looming over her in wait, until she opens her little baby eyes and then it jump scares the shit out of her. I feel for her and my little brother the most of all. I am their older brother, and I am supposed to look out for them. I can't let this thing get them, or take them, or kill them, or whatever it's intentions are. I just don't know what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I'm going to do my best to describe the thing that has been terrorizing my family as I possibly can. I read somewhere that the, Nightmare On Elm St. villain Freddy Krueger, was based on a shadow person. And I don't know if that is what this is, but it's the closest thing I can compare it to. It is black, always black, even darker than black it seems. It almost seems to absorb light rather than reflect or be illuminated by it. It is a shapeless mass when it moves about the house, but sometimes when it is still it almost seems to have the shape of a human being at times. The one thing I always notice about it is that the head or what I perceive to be the head area of this thing, always seems to be shaped as if it were wearing a cowboy hat, Or maybe some sort of head dress I'm not sure. Sometimes it seems like a black blob of nothingness, other times like a man that's super tall and skinny like a malnourished shadow.

&#x200B;

What keeps me from just calling it a shadow person is that it seems to be a physical being at times. My brother plays with this thing, and feeds it, he sneaks into the kitchen late at night to steal food. I've seen him through the crack of his bedroom door, rolling apples under his bed, and I've seen this thing catch them. A dark hand shooting out from under the edge of the bed and clutching the apple with speed. It carves things into his bedframe and walls with him, my brother has shown me the things he has drawn and the things it has drawn. It scrawls symbols and figures that look a lot like itself, and some of the images look like a family of those things.

&#x200B;

It's made me think along the lines of, maybe this thing is trying to turn my brother into one of those things. And then maybe it will come for us next, to try and turn the whole family into these dark shadowy monsters. Also here lately, it has made me think of, or reminded me I guess of that old movie about monsters that live under kids beds. The monsters that are allergic to light and the main monster character was played by, Howie Mandel, I believe. Yea I guess it's because it appears to be coming from under there, from under his bed when it comes. Where it goes when it crawls back underneath there where it came from, I can't help but wonder. I've even flipped his bed over to inspect the flooring and things while my little brother was gone, it's just a regular old hardwood floor.

&#x200B;

And I forgot to mention the scratch marks, I woke with foot long scratch marks on my arms and chest about ten days ago. It looked like huge long welts, raised up off the skin, hot and red. I'm afraid any day now that one of us is going to be gone, dead, or who knows what that could be worse. I hate this damned thing and I wish I knew how to kill it. Right now I am trying to cleanse the house, I read up on it yesterday, and I bought the sage bundle and stuff today. I'm about to light it up in a second and start walking the house, hopefully I will be able to push this thing out of here.

&#x200B;

No luck there, but I swear I heard a growl when I was walking my baby sisters room, it sounded as if it came from within the wall. I had to hurry while they were all gone for the moment, and I'll probably be yelled at for the overbearing new smell in the house. But that's no big deal, I have got to try, at the least. I am just at such a loss physically, spiritually, and emotionally, on what to do, how do you fight an enemy that transcends the reality we reside in. How do you win a battle with a supernatural entity in a natural world, I'm no exorcist, or voodoo prince, I am ill equipped for the task ahead and I know it.

&#x200B;

So I just had a breakthrough I think, with my little brother that is, I just realized tonight that he is hiding something from the rest of us. And I only realized it because he couldn't stop fiddling with it at dinner. He's keeping it in his pocket and he is definitely treasuring it for some reason. I don't know what the hell it is yet but it's important to him that's for sure. I'm going to wait until he goes to take a shower and then I'm going to ty and figure it out. I will sneak in there and retrieve it from his pants pocket or whatever, wherever.

&#x200B;

Okay so I didn't take it but I did figure out what it is, I saw it, he was wearing it in the shower, it was on his right hand. I swear when I  walked up on the bathroom door, I swear that I could hear talking, two voices back and forth. One was definitely my little brothers, the other, was a deep and rasp mans voice, the very moment that my fingers came into contact with the knob of the door, it stopped. I gently turned the knob after a long pause, listening for any hint of movement or speech. Nothingness, silence except for the sound of the water running and landing on the floor of the tub, normal shower sounds. I managed to open the door without so much as a squeak from the hinges, I think the moist hot air in there lubricated them in a way that silenced them for a change. Because they usually squawk a bit when you start to open that bathroom door.

&#x200B;

Even though, I gave myself away immediately, and he yelled loudly for whoever it was to, "get the heck out! I'm in the shower!", he said. I said sorry I had to go really bad and was in a hurry, and then I said I'm sorry bro and hesitated a second. I believe it was the sudden breeze in the shower and the change in the air that gave me away upon entry.  He yanked the curtain aside a bit and yelled at me again to get out now. I said, "Jee-zuss bro, alright!", and I left out quick and shut the door. But in the process I got what I had come for I think, I saw what I wanted to see. He used his right hand when he pulled the curtain aside, on his forefinger was a ring, and I've never seen it before. When I looked at it he realized that I had seen it, in a fraction of a second, and in the motion of a glance down, he looked at it himself and back at me before yelling that second time. In that short exchange of the eyes, that moment between us, we knew, that he knew, that I now know, what I know I'm not sure yet.

&#x200B;

The way he reacted to me catching but a glance of his precious new ring, I could tell he was concerned about it. It was a large ring, especially on the finger of his twelve year old hand, it looked old, definitely gold, and it had the look of something that was expensive. I'd love to know where he got it, or who he must of nicked it from. It had engravings, and it bore a large blue stone. I'll find out more somehow, until then that's the best I got, I only got a short look at it.

&#x200B;

Things have gotten out of control tonight, it's 3:40am, and I woke to the smell of smoke, my door wont open, and I'm freaking out. Every shadow in my room feels like it's alive or something, and I can't shake the feeling that something is watching me from somewhere. Just outside the windows, maybe from the gap underneath my closet door, from within the shadows themselves, I don't know. I'm scared to death, it's hard to even write this because my hands are shaky. And my nerves are on fire right now, it feels like some kind of electricity is in the air.

&#x200B;

I just heard a loud noise, like something was thrown up against the outside of my door. I went to it again and tried the handle, it opened this time, before it was like the knob was frozen in place, it wouldn't so much as wiggle a bit from side to side as a knob would normally do if it were simply locked. I opened the door and there on the floor was my baby sisters favorite pink and somewhat translucent Nuk, her favorite pacifier. A rush of adrenaline surged through my body as my senses started to compute and make some sort of understanding about my environment. The smell of smoke was so much stronger, and the smoke was visible, t took me a moment to realize it. My eyes were starting to burn and my nose was starting to dry out. The pacifier sent a chill up my spine despite the temperature in the hall being far hotter than that of my room. I had the sense that something terrible was happening, and I sprinted down the hall past my little brothers room and to my baby sisters nursery.

&#x200B;

The glow from the doorway as I approached, bit into my mind like some kind of vicious parasitic creature, delivering some sort of venomous potion, made up of the deepest dread and sharpest of fears. As I rounded the doorway I was forced back into the hall by the heat, my arm up to protect my face. Her bassinet was ablaze with blue flame, it was burning like a 55 gallon drum filled with tinder and kerosene. But with a supernatural glow and an otherworldly color of fire. I started to sway like a drunkard after a long Saturday night at the local watering hole. I turned and fell against my mothers half open door and landed against the door frame, her bed too was ablaze, and the brightness of the fire forced me to turn away. I stumbled down the hall and turned to face my brothers doorway, I kicked at it for what seemed like forever to me, and the ay the door flexed in and back seemed unreal. I finally got it to bust open, and what I saw broke what was left of my fragile mind.

&#x200B;

My brother was standing there, in the middle of his bedroom in a sort of T-pose, arms stretch out, head turned freakishly up toward the ceiling. Standing behind him, tall and horrible, leaned over top of him, and looking him directly in his face. Was nothing less to my mind than an actual demon of some kind. It had it's hands on his shoulders, and it had some kind of dark smoke pouring out of it's nose and mouth. The smoke was diving into my brothers body with force, his lungs seemed over expanded and there was a great pain in is face. I wanted so badly to help, to save him from this nightmare, but I also wanted to run, run far and fast and never stop. I screamed with every molecule of air in my lungs and I passed out and hit the floor.

&#x200B;

At that very moment I awoke in my bed, it was quiet, except for a slight echo in my mind, the echo of the scream that came from me as I woke. I was drenched in sweat and breathing heavily, my head was pounding, and my heart felt like it was galloping it's way out of my chest like a stallion on methamphetamine. I could hear the blood in my body, rushing past my eardrums with a thud every time my heart slammed about in my chest. And as I sat there in that awful moment of horror, a name was bouncing through my mind like a crazed Mexican jumping bean. How it got there, how I knew it, or where it came from I will never know. But now I know what I am dealing with here, and all I can say is, God help us if there is one. I don't think anyone else is going to be able to anymore.

&#x200B;

The name is Asmodeus...
