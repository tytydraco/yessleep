I used to think my mother was a superhero. It was just one of those things a kid believes, right? She was always awake, always there. I never thought much of it—until I turned eighteen and discovered the truth.

Growing up, I remember watching her every night. She would sit in the living room, eyes wide open, staring into the dark. The TV was on, but she never seemed to pay attention to it. She’d drink her coffee and chain-smoke, and I’d hear her pacing back and forth. I’d ask her why she stayed up so late, but she’d always brush it off with a tired smile and say she had work to do.

It wasn’t until I was older that I started piecing things together. When I was little, I often woke up in the middle of the night to find her sitting in the living room, as if waiting for something. She never mentioned anything, just gave me a hug and sent me back to bed. I didn’t question it—kids rarely do.

When I turned eighteen, I had a part-time job at a convenience store, and one night, I was running late. I came home at around 2 AM and saw her sitting in her usual spot, looking more haggard than ever. She was mumbling to herself, her hands trembling as she gripped her coffee cup. I was about to ask her if she was okay when I noticed something strange. The door to the basement was slightly ajar.

I’d always known about the basement, but my mother never let me go down there. It was always locked, and whenever I asked about it, she’d get quiet and change the subject. That night, though, curiosity got the better of me. I knew she was occupied, so I quietly made my way to the basement door. I stood there for a moment, listening. The only sound was my mother’s muffled voice. I took a deep breath and pushed the door open. The basement was dark, and the stairs creaked under my weight. I turned on the light at the bottom, revealing an unfinished room cluttered with old furniture and dusty boxes.

But what caught my attention was the wall. It was covered in strange markings—symbols I didn’t recognize. Some were written in chalk, others in what looked like old, dried blood. I ran my fingers over them, feeling a chill run down my spine. I heard a noise behind me—a soft, dragging sound. I spun around, but there was nothing there. As I climbed the stairs, I heard my mother’s voice again, louder now, more frantic. I ran back up and found her pacing, her eyes wild. “I thought I heard something,” she said, catching me in her gaze. “Did you go downstairs?”

I didn’t answer, but she must have seen the fear in my eyes. She grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me. “You don’t understand. You can’t go down there. You mustn’t. It’s not safe.” I tried to ask her what she meant, but she just hugged me tightly and whispered, “I’ve been trying to keep it away. It’s been after you for years.”

I didn’t understand what she was talking about. I went to bed that night feeling confused and scared. The next day, I tried to get answers out of her, but she avoided the subject, saying it was all in my head. It wasn’t until after her death that I found out the truth. She passed away a few months after my eighteenth birthday, and while cleaning out the house, I found a box hidden under her bed. Inside were old photographs, letters, and journals.

One of the journals was hers. I flipped through it, and it was filled with entries about the Shadow Man. She wrote about how it would come for me at night, how she had to stay awake to keep it at bay. She described it as a dark figure with no face, always lurking, always waiting. She wrote about how she’d first seen it when I was a baby, how it had tried to take me from my crib. She said she’d been battling it ever since, trying to protect me. I found a letter. It was addressed to me, and in it, she wrote with a trembling hand. She apologized for not being the mother I deserved but explained that she had been fighting to keep the Shadow Man at bay. She wrote that now that she was gone, the Shadow Man would come for my children.



The letter continued with a set of rules she had painstakingly detailed to fend off the Shadow Man:

1) Never Sleep Without a Light On. The Shadow Man is drawn to darkness. Keep a light on at all times, even when you think you’re safe.

2) Do Not Make Direct Eye Contact. If you see the Shadow Man, avoid looking directly at it. It feeds off your fear and will become stronger if you show it any recognition.

3) Keep the Basement Locked. The basement is a gateway. Ensure it is always locked and never go down there.

4) Burn the Symbols. Any symbols you find in the house must be burned immediately. They are anchors for the Shadow Man and will give him power over you.

5) Speak Aloud. When you feel its presence, speak aloud to assert control. Do not let it silence you.



The final entry was a desperate plea for me to protect my future children. She wrote that she had done everything she could, but the Shadow Man was relentless. The letter ended with a haunting message: “I hope these rules are enough. Please, don’t let it win.”

I felt a chill as I read those words, a sense of dread washing over me. Since her death, I have followed her rules religiously. I keep a light on at all times, avoid the basement, and have even burned symbols I found hidden around the house. Despite my efforts, I still feel like something is watching me. Sometimes, I’ll wake up to a dragging sound in the dark, and the shadows in my home seem to move on their own.

The most disturbing part is when my children were born. I find myself constantly on edge, enforcing the rules my mother left behind. I lock the basement door every night, keep lights on in every room, and even catch myself talking aloud, asserting control in the dead of night.

A few weeks ago, my youngest woke up crying, saying there was a man in the shadows of his room. I checked everywhere, but there was no one there. I tried to comfort him, but the fear in his eyes mirrored my own. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the Shadow Man was getting closer, waiting for the right moment to strike.

I don’t know if my mother’s warnings were based on reality or if her fear created a self-fulfilling prophecy. All I know is that her death left a void filled with a lurking terror that has only grown stronger with time. I follow her rules, hoping to keep my family safe, but the dread never truly fades. I feel like I’m living in a perpetual state of waiting—waiting for the Shadow Man to come for us, just as he came for me. 

Every night, as I sit by the light, I can’t help but wonder if I’m doing enough or if, eventually, the Shadow Man will claim what he’s been hunting for all these years.
