Hello to anyone reading this.  It happens that something very weird had happened to me while I was on my Drunk and High phase of the night. Last night. Anyways, I remember reddit does these so I had to reach out to you all.

I had gotten out of a local Mtg tournament that went kinda well. For everyone else,  I think. Almost every time I leave the gamestore I find nothing else to do for the rest of the night and just go grab a couple of beers or maybe a wine, head home and just go chill at my dorm.

This tradition, I've been here for more than two years I think. I think it's because I have no friends, but I don't see how's that the problem. There are worst things to put shame into...

Anyhow, just when I was about to get home I saw the area was in the dark, I thought to my self it was a really bad idea now having brought the pizza rolls...the road filled with unpaired shades of light from both sides and straight into the deepest dark...my Home!

I sweared when I got parked at my house and I couldn't see how close to the sidewalk I had parked. Forger it, I got out anyways and pulled my cargo into the house, my cellphone has a mid flashlight.  I had to trick my cat  many times while I got the cargo out of the car. When I finished I left the first main door of the house opened and the second screen door closed. I rarely do this but I wanted the Non light dark of the night 
breeze brings to the home.

As I took my bath I had Leeloo try getting into the shower then regretting it and then stupidly doing it again, she's a dumb decision maker, but smart for what a smart cat is. As I showered the little shiny flashlight on the bathroom started to break light many times. I saw it as a disco party, like those old ones. I would have love to be at a party...not gonna happen.

I hadn't had decided what to do, naked in the dark. I had the beers get cold on the big freezer which still had some blow after the blackout. And if that failed, I still had my bottle of whiskey. The final ingredient was pretty sweet too. ?..?

After dressing up, eventually,  I got out of the house at the front porch. Beer in hand, some cigarettes  and my phone and headphones, put on an episode of an ending of a series from a podcast. Watching the stars,  it was nice. The whole neighborhood,  silent, asleep, non existent. 
Listening to the spooks and drama, the whole area made mine by becoming the creature of the night. The stars where mostly arranged the way they usually are. I saw a plane on its red light skeleton. Not usual from where I am, but not unusual enough. 

As I listened to the podcast all I could see beside stars, it had to be the boring old neighbor street.
I always thought to myself, if the lights are out, them let's stay at the greatest source of light and enjoy the stars until our light comes back.

That's stupid...I don't see how. 

I had a talk with my stars those kinda nights. People don't understand this. They take you for a lunatic. I've learned stuff, I got to what my age was at present time  and I got to go beyond any of them aspired, but the whole world doesn't understand it, they think "bigger" than me...that's what they say. All I've seen from their place in time is Apathy and Empathy clashing each other into a dust of their mixture making us them both and then us having to clash against us constantly. I was about to go all cult like, I pardon and continue.

Getting into the mood, I see my insence burner, a round clay pot filled with dirt from since I became Wiccan, I think, 9 or 8 or 10 years ago. I had put a stick there and the smelled was so nice. After traveling with it for so long, I got to see myself down, way down, like the beanstalk guy watching down. It was gonna be a difficult way down into the abyss of light.  I managed to go well. It was all an idea.  A dumb Idea.

I am gonna record this.

I started the phone camera, managed through all the angels I could get and stayed on one,  standly still, I hit play on the video. I record the smoke dancing. She is flirty and respectful,  caring, but sometimes gets aggressive and erases the wind. But my clashing into her subdues her into a halt,  then she comes back at it, she doesn't understand, yet.

I had heard of a place where she, the captive, would fare the well of all. This scene I had captured,  it deserved to be I to one place,  only one. The one.

Many have heard the stories of The One. It is said, often : "The youngest are the softer"  He once said. Is  it a she or a he, I dont remember . The One was once upon A time It was the innocence. 
At fault, innocence of the beyond.  Not knowing what our superior wants or needs. We give it our everything,  our every breath,  drop of blood, dusty bones and jelly like flesh....our last scream, but for such a young soul...so popular...

That's where the idea went. 

I can't spell the name because I can't see it really, it emits a light that burns the second you think of it. It emits a sound upon approach you can't hear but still know you hear, the sound grows to be edible the closer you get. I learned it the hard way. 

Last night I got drunk and High and then thought of a silly dare to myself and get into some silly site out in the internet.  I thought to myself it would be "Do it for the vine" mindset. Only for myself:(.

What I'm about to describe is the most vibrant and real memory I have of what I remember of the night. Think of what you will.

I had downloaded something.  It passed so fast I could see it. I got Into it immediately,  don't know what took me. It was as if my head was smashed I to my phone screen but had abnormally push my head into the screen and under my desk. From beyond, I saw a lot of straight lines flashing around, zip zap. 

When I opened my eyes really,  I had been into a corridor of light. Loud shouting,  agonizing screams, quietly hard and crushing talk, and many sounds of technology mayne?.
I had gotten myself into something new.
I was new, naive [ new word unlocked] 
The whole thing was terrifying. 

A huge huge, literally huge closed space. Clean purples, greens and whites,  all reflected from large tentacle like pipes leading into a far cave opening filled with obscene light. Some birds flying in a certain pattern and then disappearing,  then next I saw birds it would be the same. Couldn't identify the bird though. It was literally,  a Bird.

Then I felt like getting lift, comfortable at a bed. But below me, it was all death at this Pont if this were true. Relating to my experience,  I thought the bed was Angelica, the gold felt so nostalgic to me, so old,  antique.  So, familiar. Anyhow. 

Felt like going on a car at over maximum speed, whatever it may be. Air manifesting around me, and i felt ot all close to me. People getting close to my skin. Like at a dentist. Some hands touching my face, but, sometimes I became numb. I don't remember those parts. I remember when it was all good and innocent.  When it wasn't ugly, if it was light, the real light. I wish I had never entered this place. I got something out, ....Here.
