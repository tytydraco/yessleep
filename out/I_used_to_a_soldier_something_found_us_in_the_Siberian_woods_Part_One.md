I don’t like talking about my days in the military. I did not particularly enjoy the experience, and reminiscing about it isn't exactly my idea of a good time. My journey was supposed to be very typical for any Russian boy who just graduated high school — go to university, get a degree, and find a nice cushy job. Things got out of hand. People died, and it was my fault. Mom and Dad did all they could. They had never shamed me, nor called me a weakling. Instead, they sent me to Moscow for treatment. The whole year was spent on tedious therapy sessions, pills, and good old vodka. 

But once I reached 18, we received a letter with the seal of a local Military Commissariat. Mom ranted and complained and promised to call the right people to make the commissar disappear with all his household. But my Dad was silent. He saw me not being able to sleep, nor could I talk to normal people. So, he decided to take drastic measures.

The next morning, I was standing in front of the gloomy-looking doors with a small bag on my shoulder. It was a cold snowy morning - like a prelude to an adventure I hadn't signed up for. My mom’s eyes were red from crying. Dad looked grim. He had a chat with the commissar, and by the end of the day, I was sitting in the room with hundreds of confused and scared boys.

Mom cried on my shoulder so hard she was shaking and babbling. Dad hugged me awkwardly and looked me in the eyes. I think he wanted to say something or just hoped to see if I understood. I did. The army sounded better than asylum. 

After a couple of days, I was on a train to the middle of the Siberian taiga. I was surrounded by nervous 18-year-old boys – most came from villages and small God-forsaken towns in the Far North. Only I and another guy were from a city. Kiril was wearing glasses and 80s mustaches and graduated from a university studying IT. I’ve no idea how he ended up with the rest of us unlucky bastards. Kiril kept saying he wanted to do his duty and serve our country. Honestly, I think he had some trouble with the law. Maybe he borrowed money from a wrong guy? Maybe he knocked up a principal’s daughter? The others didn’t want to mingle with a “city boy” like me. It didn’t help that I refused to drink with them. I know: a grave offense in Russia, but I couldn’t break bread with some filthy gopniks.

“Drop it” Kiril shrugged. “You call them scum; they call you fancy pants. The conflict is older than Christ himself. Just accept it and move on.”

I heed his words but kept a switchblade under the pillow. 

When we arrived, even I couldn’t hide my disappointment. The base was covered in a thick layer of snow, the old barracks looked like they were falling apart. Cracked windows, falling roofs, and icy walls. The temperature inside never rose above 20 degrees Celsius, and the food varied from barely tolerable to stuff that the Gestapo would consider inhumane to use.

We embraced the suck and even tried to laugh it off. Then the drills started. Surprisingly I managed to stay on top of my draft somehow. Do what you are told, don’t think, don’t ask questions, and read the damn manual. The worst part was Kirza boots and the damn footwarps. Firstly, it looked ridiculous – we had to wear a piece of rag instead of socks like some 19th-century peasants. Secondly, if you wrap it wrong you could say goodbye to your feet. As the time went on, I somewhat enjoyed it. Somewhat.

All life outside the base seemed to cease to exist and the prospect of going home became just another fairy tale. We were surrounded by hundreds of kilometers of forest with only wolves and bears as our neighbours. Trains occasionally delivered the supplies, mail, and new recruits every 3-4 months. Our lives before the base were just a fever dream. I liked that. Well, Kiril didn’t… That’s the problem with higher education. He asked too many questions and the worst part – the guy was under the delusion that we had rights...

“This makes no sense!” he kept whining. “Who digs a hole in the middle of a field? In winter?! They could have at least let us light the fire to unfreeze the ground. And I think Morozov is getting frostbite! And also…”

“Jesus, you suck at it” I muttered trying to pierce the rock-hard ground with a shovel. "Be glad we are not on latrine duty – the second company was trying to crack the frozen shit the whole day yesterday.”

“And who thought it was a good idea to build toilets outside of the barracks?" Kiril continued "Didn’t they know what would happen in winter? I mean, sure it reduces the cost…”

“See, you answered your own question.” 

“Oi, love birds” we heard the voice of Lieutenant Frolov. “If you won’t shut up, I’ll tear your eyes out and shove it in your arse holes.”

“Understood, comrade lieutenant!” I shouted back.

Lieutenant Frolov had the worst reputation among the troops for frequent punishment and a dark sense of humor. The veteran of the Second Chechen war with a nasty scar on his face. A legend said he received it when a trio of Chechens ambushed him. Apparently, they quickly realized their error in judgment and wanted to depart peacefully, but like today the lieutenant was in a foul mood.

“Keep digging from here and until lunch! We are going for a walk after that!” he said with a voice raspier than a rusty chainsaw.

I think I heard Kiril groaned. I on the other hand was thrilled. “A walk” meant we were going to a shooting range, and I was excited like a kid in a Disneyland. Even a 7-kilometer march on a serpentine dirt road through the dark forest was a small price to pay. No one liked those woods. The stillness and the shadows were unnerving. But it was what was behind the bushy branches that gave us chills. Many could swear they saw the movement in the dark. 

Luckily, the lieutenant never sent us there after the dark. Plus, we had our fun. Most of our boys received modern 5.45mm AK-74s, the others had to carry bloody dinosaurs: 7.62mm AKMs but a couple of particularly unlucky SOBs ended up with original 1949 AKs. My AKM was rugged, old, and with deep scratches on the wooden furniture. There was a long crack on the buttstock, and the safety mechanism made funny noises. In all honesty, it was love at first sight. We have spent countless hours on the range – not because the lieutenant was concerned for our skills, but because of 3 depots full of expiring ammo. If our colonel wrote them off, the division HQ would cut his balls off. Understandably upset, he would cut Lieutenant Frolov’s balls, and then Frolov would do the same to us. Chain of command in its finest and we were very much interested in keeping our balls intact. So, each conscript was given 2-3 crates of ammo and permission to go wild. 

Very soon the wooden furnitures started smoking and gun barrels glow bright red. My shots were mostly single, with occasional short bursts when I felt particularly cheeky. I liked the kick, and the loud BANG, and the smell of burned gunpowder. Of course, I could barely see the target past 300 meters and unlike 5.45, my bullets were heavier, slower, and kicked harder, so aiming was trickier. All was well, until some… alternately ingenious person decided to play Rambo. Morozov, drunk on power and angry at his frostbite, loaded two AKs, took them in both hands and bellowed a howling war cry like an ancient Mongolian horseman. Then the idiot pulled both triggers.

Of course, the burst went wild, and the impact was swift and unexpected. I felt something hit me in the helmet and then heard the loud ringing in my ears. The world exploded and turned into a violent whirlwind. I think I passed out. Not sure how long it lasted – maybe just a minute but could be a couple of hours. 

“Oi… OI!” I heard someone’s voice. I tried to open my eyes and surprisingly saw Lieutenant Frolov’s blurry face. 

“You fool, can you hear me?!” I bumbled something, and Frolov finally shook his head and looked at the idiot who shot me. 

“Breath, Moroz,” the lieutenant said jokingly and patted the guy on the shoulder. “I guess, we won’t feed you to the wolves after all”. 

Kiril helped me up and carried me back to base. The Lieutenant said if I was not dying so there was no need to call a truck. My head hurt really bad. I was sure my skull cracked. Kiril was talking nonstop trying to keep me awake – he saw in a movie how a dude died because he closed his eyes. The forest around us was cast into a perpetual gloom, the sunlight struggling to penetrate the thick foliage. The air was cold with the scent of pine needles, intermingled with the hint of gun oil and sweat.

There was a silent hope that I would pass out and be released from the torment, but a quite peculiar sound woke me up. A distant and barely audible sound, almost covered by the noise of our steps. The snap of a twig? A rustling of branches? Something felt odd in it. Through pain I managed to turn my head toward the woods. For a moment, I saw a slick shadow darted from one treetop to another. The only thing that gave it away was the shaking of the branches. Then the forest became as still as I remembered it. I felt goosebumps down my spine. I knew that it could not be – just a trick of light and my injury. But somehow, it felt real… too vivid, too detailed. The blasted thing looked enormous, scrawny like a spider and huge like a horse. And it was glaring back at me – a thin gaunt silhouette amid the bushy branches. Frolov suddenly halted, raising his hand. He stood there for a minute not moving at all, and we could only look at each other puzzled. 

“Platoon, move your arses. Double time!” Frolov ordered. 

“Comrade lieutenant, we can’t…” 

Kiril started to protest no doubt wondering how he was supposed to carry me and keep up with the rest. 

“Zip it! Morozov!” 

“Yes, comrade lieutenant!” Morozov was as baffled as I was. The fool was still a bit shaky since he was very close to being publicly auto-da-fé. 

“Help Krasnov. Platoon, follow me, you apes!” 

My comrades didn't complain. No one liked these woods. It felt wrong and almost as if we were intruding somewhere we were not supposed to. As we sped up, the pain returned, and my hands could not stop shaking. Somehow the memories of that night on the island came back again. The flicker of the torches, the pale faces with cold eyes, the scream, the stink of blood and raw meat. That was the first time since the incident when I felt my mind fall into the black hole of sheer panic. For a second, I forgot where I was. My eyes darted from side to side against my will.

We were falling further behind the rest of the platoon. I could barely see the backs of our comrades who were running as if there was a wolfpack after them. Morozov helped Kiril to carry me. I could not even look at the fool, but my paranoia dulled all sense of anger. The road turned suddenly, and our platoon disappeared behind the wall of trees. I could still hear their grunting and huffing, but it became quieter with every second. Now my blood really ran cold. It reminded me of when I was a kid and feared the darkness in my room, while my parents slept peacefully next door. I knew they were there, but also knew they wouldn’t help if the monster under the bed decided to strike. Now I felt the same. Our comrades were no more than 30 meters away, but in these woods, it could have been as well as a thousand miles. I could swear it was following us - the rustling of branches and creaking of the old trunks. My panic and paranoia told me someone was watching from the treetops. Some primal instincts screamed at me to run and hide. Whatever it was, it felt… wrong. Kiril shook his head and looked at me. He said it all would be alright; we’d be at the hospital soon. But I could see he was nervous. Did he see something? Or maybe it was the same survival instinct that drove me insane? The muscles on my neck tensed, my legs were weak, and my heart still pouting. I could not hear our platoon anymore, only occasional rustle and quiet snaps. Suddenly, a figure jumped from around the corner. And he looked angry. 

“Hurry up, you pregnant cockroaches! Move!” barked Lieutenant Frolov. 

He let us pass and then followed behind, shouting and cussing nonstop until we suddenly were out of the woods. Exhausted I fell on the ground, clutching my heart and breathing heavily. 

“That was fun” muttered lieutenant sweating and huffing. “Alright, clean yourself up – I’ll wait for you in the storeroom. Prepare all your gear for the inspection. Be very afraid, you little... Oh, Krasnov drag the body to the hospital, will you?” 

Kiril and I burst into the hospital to find a lonely nurse at the register. Nadia, I think was her name. She was sitting at the table surrounded by tiny bottles of nail polish and was reading a magazine. Nadia saw us and rolled her eyes, angrily putting the magazine away. She looked at my wound, said it was a just scratch, and grumbled that I was distracting people from their work. Before kicking us out, Nadia hissed at us not to bother her unless I was dying and then returned to her magazine. Kiril looked at me bewildered and then muttered: 

"I’ve stashed aspirin in my locker. Want some?” 

6 months passed. The range incident aside, it was rather quiet. My nightmares didn’t cease completely but it eased somewhat. Oleg and Yulia still came in my dreams, and I would wake up when someone slapped my face or threw an old boot at me. Apparently, my comrades did not appreciate screaming at night. Kiril tried to raise this topic, but I laughed it off. I received letters from my parents. Never told them that I’d got shot of course. They were happy that I finally could catch a decent sleep, and shared everything what happened while I was away. Part of me wanted to hear that the authorities found Yulia… but realistically, I knew nobody would look for some teenage girl. 

By that time the long winter finally passed, the days became longer and the nights warmer. Our joy was short-lived. The warm weather meant we could work more: the barracks wouldn’t fix themselves, nor did the fence, the HQ building, the motor depots, the gardens, and… Basically, we had been demoted to glorified laborers. Every morning there were more things to fix, and every night we went to beds broken in body and spirit. I hated it with every fiber of my soul. A smoke break was our only salvation. The moment when we could relax and quietly hope for the Lord to kill us. Until someone messed up. 

I was quite upset at Morozov for almost sending me to a meeting with Saint Peter. So, you could understand my rage, when this imbecile smoked outside of a designated area and then tossed a cigarette butt on a ground… right in front of our lieutenant. Well… jumping on a frag grenade was preferable.

So here we were, running in heavy hazmat suits and gas masks in the middle of a hot day with our rifles on the shoulders and heavy backpacks full of ammo and MREs. I could smell the stink of rubber, dirty armpits, and farts of previous suit owners. Sweating like a pig, I angrily glanced at Morozov, who was at the head of the column holding high a tiny coffin we built.

Frolov ordered to bury the butt with full military honors. So, we ran in formation like a funeral procession, crying loudly, moaning, and lamenting the passing of the cigarette butt as ordered. The sun was merciless, and the temperature reached 35 degrees. Breathing in a gasmask was not an easy feat by default. Heavy backpacks and rifles didn’t help either. A couple of guys had passed out and had to be carried. To say that we wanted blood would be an understatement. The folks already started arguing who would take a swing at Morozov first. All his previous transgressions were recalled. Like when he tried to sneak bread from the kitchen – the entire platoon had been left without dinner for a month. Or how he was walking around with hands in his pockets... 2 hours later we reached a remote meadow on the outskirts of the woods - it was wide and bright, the buzzing of bees and grasshoppers with the sweet odor of flowers. The dark trees looked far and harmless. The sun was high in the sky. 

“Alright, listen up, you walking birth control mistakes!” barked Lieutenant Frolov, when we gathered around him all puffing and huffing. “Dig!” 

By the time we finished, my hands shook so hard I couldn’t hold a shovel. Those who did not dig the grave were standing in attention, rifles in hands and chin high under the merciless sun. Finally, I collapsed to the bottom, feeling the cold ground underneath. Kiril was sitting already staring absently somewhere in the general direction of Andromeda Galaxy. 

“So,” said the lieutenant looking down at us. “Anyone else wants a cigarette?” 

“I quit, comrade lieutenant” I whispered breathlessly. 

“Good” he nodded. 

“Now get back here. We must bury our late comrade. Bring Morozov – the man himself must do the honor”. 

I heard the murmur. Couldn’t figure out what they were saying but I did not like the general mood. 

“What do you mean he is not here?” by lieutenant’s tone indicated he was a moment from committing an act of violence. 

“Comrade lieutenant…” said someone scarily. 

“He was just here – he told me he is going to take a leak. Just over there behind the trees” 

“Take a… WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION, MO-RON?!” Despite being absolutely exhausted I jump unexpecting such violent reaction. 

“Are you deaf, worm? I ordered you to stand in attention! This means even if a nuke is about to fall – you bloody stand!” 

He grew silent for a second and I could almost hear gears in his head turning. 

“Alright, new plan! Drop the suits! Each squad split into fire teams! We are going after the fool. Keep visual contact! No more than 20 meters between the teams! And for the love of God, stay bloody silent! No chitchat, no screaming, verstehen?!” 

I barely managed to get out of the grave, feeling a little bit enraged. 

“Let the wolves have him. No one will care” I muttered while getting from the pit and trying to clean myself. 

I was slightly surprised when the lieutenant’s boot smashed into my face. My world spined upside down and I fell back into the grave, choking on my own blood. 

“Listen to me, you little shit” I could almost taste the venom in Frolov’s voice. “Yes, nobody will care: not our colonel, not the redcaps, and definitely not civvies. That’s why we have to. There are only us to look after each other, you moron! And if I ever hear such talks again, I’ll bury you alive in this very grave, you absolute imbecile!” 

“I’m sorry, comrade lieutenant” I replied meekly. “I understand” 

“You understand nothing because you believe in nothing!” spitted Frolov. 

He looked… agitated, almost as if I had opened a long-buried can of worms. For me, all these talks of honor, of brotherhood were no more than empty slogans of our esteemed generals and politicians. But not for Frolov apparently – I guess because he fought in the actual war unlike us. 

“Did he take the weapon?” Frolov already turned away, talking to the sergeant.

“Yes, comrade lieutenant” 

I sighed. That was not good. If we fail to find him now, the redcaps will just shoot the idiot – no one would risk approaching an armed deserter. Morozov managed to mess up even now. 

“Good” Frolov nodded to my surprise “He’ll have a chance out there. Alright, we have 4 hours till sundown. Meaning, only 2 hours to find him. After that, we are leaving the forest. No one, and I mean no one, stays there for the night! I want your asses out of the woods by dusk!”. 

Once we lined up in front of the trees, looking inside the forest grimily, lieutenant Frolov spoke again: 

“If you see anyone suspicious – shoot to kill. No warning shots – just shoot the bastard. Alright, maggots, Godspeed.” 

We glanced at each other puzzled. What did he mean by “anyone suspicious”? Frolov’s orders made no sense. We definitely would follow them, but what the hell? We took a deep breath and walked into the forest. It felt almost as if we crossed the invisible threshold that separated our world and something… different. 

The Lieutenant led the charge, giving the orders with hand gestures. The buzzing of insects had stopped, and the sun barely shone through the canopy of trees. It smelled of rotten leaves, stale water, and old bark. 

“Can’t see anything,” said Kiril quietly. 

Of course, we were in the same team. Besides us, there were 2 other guys. One was Batu – an Asian fella from Buryatia or Yakutia, can’t remember for sure. We never spoke much, but he was alright – always clean and tidy, never complained like the rest of us. And he was the best shot in the entire company, so I quite envied his talents.

The second guy was Dima. This... gentleman was from some Godforsaken town in the Far East. Apparently, the town was surrounded by prison camps and was built primally as a logistic hub to feed them. So, Dima sounded almost proud of this fact with half of his speech infested with “Fenya” – a lowlife language used by bandits, thieves, and other scum. This guy tried to make everyone behave by “Thieves’ Law”. In his words, Dima was on top and everyone else who didn’t follow those laws were suckers whose only purposes were to serve and to suffer. Understandably, one night Lieutenant Frolov called Dima to his office, where he spent almost 2 hours and returned with few broken ribs and fingers. Four of us slowly trudged through the forest. The feeling was unnerving as if we were complexly cut off from the world outside. Though it was almost late spring, there were still patches of snow lying around. The air was cold and moist, and the ground was wet and slippery. I again thanked God that I was wearing Kirza boots – at least my feet were warm and dry. I saw the other teams not far from us. It gave some sense of security. We moved forward leaving the marks on the trees as we passed. A big carved Xs were hard to miss. This way we would know the way back. The silence surrounded us, and even other teams sounded further than before. We didn’t see any signs wildlife: no droppings, no tracks, no burrows. Even spiders were nowhere to be seen. 

“Strange” whispered Batu, cutting another mark on a tree. I don’t know why his words caught my attention, but I decided to come closer. 

“What?” 

“See that?” he showed me the blade, covered in brownish ooze. 

“So?” I mused inhaling a slightly sweet scent. 

“That’s rot. From the sapwood. Very old” he said, looking puzzled. 

“And? The tree is sick, what’s the deal?” 

“It looks young and healthy” he pointed at the tree. 

“But it is almost completely rotten inside out. Should be dead long ago”. “Well, strange things happen” I shrugged. 

“Not like this” he shook his head. “Can you walk if your muscles turned to mush? Don’t think so." 

I felt tingling on the back of my head. 

“Hey, fraiers!” I heard Dima calling us. “Are we moving or sightseeing?” 

I saw Batu tensed. “Fraier” was a term used in criminal circles. And it was not a flattering term. Kiril gave me the look and I put my hand on Batu’s shoulder calming him. He was right, there was no time for blood feuds. We continued moving, but this time I was listening closely trying to catch any suspicious sounds. But so far, I have not heard a thing. No birds singing, no insect buzzing, or even distant echoes.

I kept glancing toward the other teams walking a few dozen meters away from us. The silence became oppressive, and it took all my willpower to keep my mouth shut. I desperately wanted to shatter the silence just to hear something. Well, apparently, Dima did not intend to hold up. 

“Vladimirky Central, the wind of the North...” he started singing quietly. 

“Shut it, damn gopnik” I hissed. 

“What did you say, fraier?!” he spatted turning to me. 

“What, you think you are the boss, huh? You think you can mess with me?!”

Dima advanced toward me, not holding his tone. 

“Did you forget your place, sucker?” 

“Back off, scum!” I growled, consciously putting the gun away. 

“We are on a search mission! So shut it, lowlife”. 

He looked at me curiously and tilted his head, like a child looking at a new toy. “A mission!” he laughed mockingly. 

“Oh, you are some kind of special agent, huh? What a looser” 

I grabbed him by the throat, surprising even myself. My fingers dug into his flesh, and Dima’s eyes widened in shock. I kept pressing, feeling rage inside. It felt good – better than the constant pressure and anxiety that ground my sanity the last hour. His eyes widened. Dima coughed and started to wave his hands trying to hit me. 

“Now, you will shut up,” I told quietly, still holding his throat tight. “We’ll keep searching for Morozov, and if you have a problem with me, we’ll deal with it on the base. Understood?” 

Batu and Kiril were on us in an instant. Batu was trying to pull me back, and Kiril was holding my other hand with a bayonet in it. I released Dima and started walking away trying to calm my anger and regretting the whole ordeal.

Suddenly, I felt a kick in my back. Then came a storm of punches that landed on my head, my back, and my kidneys area. Dima was trying to pummel me into the ground. That was the final straw – I was going to kill him. To gouge his eyes and make him eat it! Then cut his balls and crucify him! Unfortunately, Batu grabbed Dima in a wrestling lock, and Kiril jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. 

“Stop it, you jerk!” Kiril yelled into my face. 

He put his knee on my throat, and a foot on my wrist holding the bayonet. Batu was still holding Dima in a lock, while the scum cried in pain. It took a while for us to calm down. I still wanted to gut Dima, but the irresistible urge to kill him had faded a bit. Kiril pressed the knee and I started to suffocate. 

“Calmed?” he asked sternly. “Are you sure?” 

I nodded. 

“So, nothing had happened. I didn’t see anything, is that clear?”

I nodded again. 

“Good” 

He helped me up and I started to clean myself of dirt and leaves, avoiding Kiril’s eyes. The rage had disappeared completely, replaced by shame. I messed up – I knew it, and if not for the guys I would probably gut Dima. His life didn’t matter of course, but mine would be ruined for scum like him. 

“Guys…” said Batu nervously looking around. “Where are the others?” 

“Huh?” I blinked confused and looked around, trying to see the silhouettes of our comrades. 

The forest looked as usual: old trees, dead leaves, and patches of snow. The rare sunlight fell on the ground through the dense foliage. And no movement. Even the trees stood as if frozen. 

“I have an even better one,” said Kiril sadly. “What time is it?” 

I looked at my watch. “17:49?” 

“Same” he nodded. “We are running out of sunlight. The lieutenant ordered to get back before sundown. So, shall we?” 

I agreed, still trying to avoid everyone’s eyes. We moved back following the marks on the trees. Dima went first, then Batu and Kiril. I was staying a bit behind, trying to put some distance between me and everyone. I wasn’t sure what urged me to fight Dima, but that was too close for my taste. One by one we passed the markings. We didn’t talk or even glance at each other. I was too ashamed, Dima no doubt was furious and already planned to jump on me at the barracks after the curfew. Batu and Kiril probably just wanted to stay away from us psychos and get back to base. The light got dimmer, washing the forest into a shade of grey. I could barely see during the twilights. Everything turned into a pure smudge: I couldn’t tell a tree trunk from a person; even worse I could not recognize the way we went. I checked the time. It still showed 17:49. I frowned. 

“Hey, what’s on yours?” I asked Kiril. 

He looked at his watch and I didn’t like the expression on his face. 

“Batu?” 

“Noticed, huh?” he grunted. 

“Noticed what?” gritted Dima, turning to us. I felt a familiar tingling in my head. My hands reflectively pulled AKM from my shoulder. 

“The markings are also wrong,” Batu said calmly. 

“The hell you mean “wrong”?” Dima spat out, agitated. “What, are we lost now?” 

Batu sighed as if he felt relief. I guess he was hoping against hope. 

“I noticed maybe half an hour ago. The markings look different. I cut the Xs, right?” ‘So?” I asked trying to remember what marks we passed lately. 

“Someone cut another line on it – now it’s more like a star”. 

“So, we were following the wrong path?” I concluded. 

“We weren't!” snapped Batu. “Remember the tree I cut? The one that was all rotten. That was the same tree. But now instead of X, there was a star.” 

I frowned. Could it be a prank? Sure, but unlikely. Our comrades knew better than to alter the markings. Lieutenant Frolov would skin them alive. 

“Alright, no point in wondering.” Kiril commanded. “It's still our marks. We are following the path. And bloody fast – the sun is almost down”. 

We moved hurriedly. The darkness almost swallowed us completely, and what used to be just trunks and branches now looked like tall black figures with bony hands. I could barely see Dima ahead of our little column. Now I listened even closely. My mind already imagined the monstrous figures that lurked in the shadows behind my back – thin and slender. I could feel their gazes. Once or twice, I jolted, sure I felt someone’s breathing on my neck. But every time there was nothing. We walked another hour, and still no end in sight. The sun completely disappeared leaving us with a choice. 

“So, do we move or stay?” I asked no one in particular. 

The column stopped and thought for a second. 

“Screw that,” said Dima angrily. “Come on, there should be close! Plus, you heard the boss: no one stays in the woods at night!”

“Oh, so now you heed the warnings” I grinned menacingly. 

“We stay,” said Kiril, and Batu nodded quietly. “Better to make camp otherwise we can get lost completely.” 

“No way!” protested Dima. “You can stay as long as you want, but I’m leaving!” 

“Ok,” Kiril shrugged putting his backpack on the ground. 

“And who put you in charge, huh?” Dima didn’t intent to be quiet, and I could see his eyes were panicking and the hands were shaking. “You are just some nerd! I am not taking orders from the four-eyes! We are leaving!” 

“Leave, then” I smirked. 

“Screw you!” he roared. 

I heard a faint clang of a bolt. Kiril looked at Dima pointing AK at him. 

“Good enough?” asked Kiril calmly. “Or you’ll need a demonstration?” 

“Wow-wow, easy!” Dima immediately backed down holding his hands up. “Easy, boy, no need for that! You are a straight fella!” 

“Good. Now go grab the firewood. It’s going to be a long night.” 

We spend another half an hour preparing the camp. Batu apparently had a lot of experience, so he basically singlehandedly prepared the fireplace and some makeshift sits from branches. Dima was silent, bringing a bare minimum of wood. He looked scared, and to be fair, so was I. By that time everyone knew we were not on a picnic. All four of us gathered around the fire. We stared at the night forest, sitting inside the circle of light and holding to our Kalashnikovs for dear life. My hands trembled, and I could do nothing to stop it. Fear… the most ancient emotion known to man. Now I understood why. 

I heard a gentle cracking of the firewood and felt its warmth. I guess it was in our nature to cling to the light. I could almost smell our fear in the air, like a stink from a dead horse. I did not know how long it had been. Every time I checked time, the answer was the same. 17:49. The darkness surrounded us. Dima was blowing his nose and spitting on the ground. Kiril and I tried to hold our breath and be as quiet as possible. Batu muttered something… maybe a prayer? I was not sure. 

Once or twice, I thought I saw movement somewhere between the trees. Tried to convince myself it was nothing: just my imagination or some nocturne animal. Though I hadn’t seen any since we entered this damn forest. My body tensed. I held the grip tight, and my fingers played with the selector lever. Batu’s muttering became louder, and I realized he was praying… Something like: “Om Mane Padme Hum”. 

The silence was broken unexpectedly. I heard rustling – and not just an innocent distant sound, but like something dragged its feet over the ground. The worst part, I swear it was merely 10 meters away. The others heard it too, so we all jumped on our legs and raised the guns. Then silence returned. We desperately pointed our guns into the night, trying and failing to see what caused the sound. A few minutes nothing happened. Then suddenly Batu gasped and quickly turned back, pointing his AK-74 behind us. I didn’t have time to ask why he did 180 when I heard his scream: 

“Contact!” 

The flash of gunfire lighted the night. The roar almost deafened me. By reflex, I did what I was taught – sent a short burst into a general direction where Batu was aiming. The muzzle flashes illuminated the forest just enough for me to notice a figure jumping fast between the trees. I could not see what exactly this thing was… it looked like a thin human with long limbs. But it didn’t move like a human – too jerky, too sporadic, and too bloody fast! I fired but it was almost impossible to catch this thing in my sight. It hid behind the cover, jumping on the trees better than a seasoned squirrel. I could barely believe what I'd seen. I moved as if mesmerized, as if my body had turned to jelly... Nothing made sense. This thing made no sense!

I wanted to scream, and to cry, and to run away. To be anywhere but here.

I could barely hear Dima’s panic scream when he ran into the night. Kiril tried to catch him, but joined Batu and me once he realized that the beast was closing in. Despite the suppressive fire, the thing was getting closer - leaping from cover to cover. I reloaded the gun and kept shooting. The creature just refused to die. It’s when my burst pulverized a tree just 20 meters away, when something caught my attention. Some unknown force made me turn my head. Maybe it was the 6th sense or my guarding angel, but I looked back only to see another shadowy figure. The thing prepared to leap at us from a tree! I screamed and moved my entire body to face it. My vision tunneled, and as if in slow motion I witnessed this thing jump. I could see its ugly silhouette and 2 eyes glinted in the light of the muzzle flashes. I pulled the trigger, and my AKM sent a long burst filling the air with bullets. It rammed into me, and I felt the nauseating stench of mucus and indescribable filth that made my head hurt. Something hit me in the face sending me on my back. The whole world was spinning, and I could barely pull the bayonet out. We heard a howling cry and something like a child’s scream, and then suddenly everything stopped. Silence once again. Batu was lying on the ground with a nasty gash on his leg. The blood was pouring on the muddy ground filled with spend cartridges. Kiril was still holding the gun jerking it from one side to another, expecting another fight. I ran toward him. 

“It... It got me” he muttered through pain. 

“Quite,” I said. “Just let me get the first aid kit.” 

I put on the tourniquet and bandaged the wound, but it was pretty clear that Batu wouldn’t be able to walk by himself. I looked at Kiril, who stood frozen still pointing his AK into the darkness. 

“The hell was that?” He sounded scared. Almost panicked, and I could understand. I had no idea what that was. No idea how we were going to get to the base. How do we even intend to survive the night? 

“Dima ran” Kiril murmured. 

“Did you expect anything less?” I asked checking the plethora of ampuls I got in my first aid kit. “Watch us, would you? I’ll help Batu.” 

“What the hell were they?!” Kiril sounded really close to panic now. His eyes were wide, his hands trembling slightly. “What the goddamn BS they are hiding here?!” 

“Hiding?” I asked puzzled. “Who?” 

“Our damn command!” he screamed. “Frolov knew something! You heard him! No sound and stuff, shoot to kill. He knew something and still sent us! This whoreson sent us here!” 

“Of course, he knew” I muttered. 

“What, and you are ok with that?” Kiril then he pointed his gun toward me. “Did you know as well? You don’t even sound surprised! Are you with Frolov from the start?!” 

I froze, looking at the gun barrel, knowing at any moment my life could end. 

“Put that thing away, you dimwit!” I growled through my gritted teeth feeling rage returning. “And keep watching. Let me finish with Batu and we’ll talk.” 

I sensed Kiril’s eyes on me for a few seconds, and then the fear of another attack made him do as I told. Batu was injured pretty bad, and I was not sure if I administered painkillers correctly. The guy was silent and only winced a bit when I made an injection. 

“How is it?” I asked him. 

“I’ll live” Batu replied, grabbing his gun that was lying nearby. “You’ve seen some shit before, huh?” 

His question caught me off-guard. I sighed, forcibly trying to make the memories fade, and failing spectacularly. Oleg and Yulia looked at me from the shadows. 

“Something like that” I grunted, looking away. “You?” 

“Something like that” he replied with a dry smirk.

I nodded and once finished bandaging his wound, I went to Kiril. He was eyeing me wearingly. “No. I did not know. And no, I am not in league with Frolov. And I have no idea what these things are.”

“I know, I know” he sighed heavily. “Sorry for… well, earlier. It just… I really don’t like it. And I… I’m scared. Have you seen these things?

“Yeah,” I lighted a cigarette and offered one to Kiril. 

By that time, I think I reached my breaking point. No fear, no panic. As if it was completely ordinary thing to find some monsters in the woods. I guess, it was just too much. Mostly I was just tired and somehow vindicated. There was something in this forest after all. Yay? 

I sighed again looking into the night and preparing my AKM. We knew it was going to be a long march home.
