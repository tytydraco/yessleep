I’m not sure I should be posting this now, but I need someone to know what’s happening.

My name is Jeff. I’m 25, I live alone in a small apartment, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve had a… thing for celebrities. Not just “I like this actor” or “I follow that singer.” I mean full-blown obsession. The kind where you know everything about them—every interview, every tweet, every song lyric—and sometimes, you feel like they know you back.

At least, I used to think it was harmless. But now, I don’t know.

It started with a country singer—let’s call him “Luke.” Luke is amazing, and I love him in a way that’s hard to explain. At first, it was just music. I would play his songs while I cooked, while I walked to work, while I cleaned the apartment. Then I started watching old interviews and videos over and over, memorizing the way he smiled, the way he laughed.

That’s when the strange things started.

At first, it was small. My phone would light up in the middle of the night with a notification from one of his fan accounts—even though I had all notifications off. Sometimes I would hear a voice that sounded like him when I was walking home, just whispering my name: “Jeff…”

I convinced myself it was my imagination.

But then it got worse.

A few nights ago, I woke up to find my apartment door unlocked. I live alone. Nothing was missing, and there were no signs of forced entry. But taped to my bathroom mirror was a note in my handwriting. Only, I didn’t write it.

It said:

"I’m closer than you think. Don’t be scared, Jeff. I like it when you watch me."

I swear I froze for hours just staring at it. I didn’t sleep. I didn’t call anyone. I just… sat there, too terrified to move.

The next day, I tried to rationalize it. Maybe I left the note and forgot? No. That’s impossible. I check everything. I don’t remember writing it, and the ink was still slightly wet.

Since then, it’s been constant. I hear his voice in my apartment when I’m alone. On my phone, his name appears in messages I never sent. Sometimes, I even swear I see him in the reflection of my TV, standing behind me for just a second before disappearing.

Last night, I lost it. I was watching one of his live performances—just for comfort—and I heard him speak directly to me through the speakers. Not the music, not the crowd. His voice.

“Jeff… why are you watching me? Don’t you know you belong to me?”

I screamed. My neighbors probably think I’m losing it. I don’t care. I can’t.

I tried to leave. I thought maybe if I got out of the apartment, I could escape it. But every street I turned down, every corner I walked past… he was there. Not physically, I think. But I felt him. He was in the shadows, just far enough away that I couldn’t see him clearly. And he was whispering my name, over and over.

I don’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t know if I’m losing my mind, or if he’s… real. And I don’t know how to stop it.

If anyone has ever been like this—completely obsessed, where it feels like the person actually knows you—please tell me. Please. I need to know I’m not alone.

What should I do? I need answers, quick. Because tonight… I think he’s coming inside.
