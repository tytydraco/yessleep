“Hi.” 

The voice escaped the dark of my room. I was frozen, the adrenaline shot through my body, my eyes once heavy were wide open. I peered into the darkness around my room. Hoping I could find some rational explanation for whatever just spoke to me. Stuffing surrounded my room. My teddy bear had been ripped apart and its innards strewn across the floor. I could smell burnt hair and hear a rhythmic crackling noise. I heard a rustle from my cupboard, followed by a light thud.

“Hello?” I asked. Pathetically calling to the darkness. Praying that nothing spoke back. That my imagination had just run wild. 

“It’s me.” The voice whispered back to my call. I froze. The voice was raspy, yet still high pitched. I heard movement inside the cupboard and as my eyes adjusted I noticed a pale white hand reach the door of my cupboard. He had no fingernails. As the door pulled open and the open blinds of my curtains let the moon shine in, I could make out the figure. Crouched in my cupboard, peering out at me. 

“Are you going to hurt me?” I whispered. I could make him out wiping his chin. He had a stained white hoodie on. I could see the darkness of his eyes. Their reflection of the moonlight. 

“Don’t be scared.” His breath crackled. It sounded like a fire burning twigs. He wheezed and I heard a faint cough. His bare feet laid flat on the carpet. “I’m not the boogeyman. I’ve met the boogeyman.” 

“You promise?” I asked him. He seemed cold but there was an energy coming from him. Something excited. He reminded me of my brother. 

“That teddy didn’t speak did it?” He asked me. He motioned towards the stuffing across the floor. His pale hand once again soaking in a the moonlight. He hid in the shadows but I could make out shapes. Some wiry frame. 

“What happened to your fingers?” I couldn’t hide the shake in my voice. He looked at his fingers. He examined them for a moment before giggling. 

“My bitch mother ripped them out.” He was hit by the light of the moon as leaned a little too forward from my cupboard door. He pulled back. Bringing his leg up and pulling himself back into the dark of my cupboard. He was small and skinny. His mouth left behind a droplet of blood as he pulled away.

“You’re scaring me.” I wanted to cry. I wanted to pull my sheet above my head and hide. 

“Oh come on. I’m not that fucking scary. I could be naked crawling under your bed. Not cutting my fucking nails.” He laughed again before coughing. “You want to hear a joke?”

“Ok.” I nodded. He rubbed his hands together before giggling quietly to himself. 

“What do you get when you put a baby on a train track?” He leered out of the darkness for a second. Staring at me. I could make out his face. What remained of it at least. He was pale white, missing a nose. His eyes seemed like they were caving in. The dark rings around his eyes looked more like the slow rot of his face than the body’s reaction to lack of sleep. His mouth had large cuts along the side. The carvings fashioned into a smile that disappeared behind a head of thin, long, black hair. I noticed some drool leak from the middle of his bottom lip and slowly stretch to the ground. 

“What?” My lip shook for a second. 

“Half a dead fucking baby.” He laughed and threw himself back. I felt a knot form in my throat. 

“Mum!” I screamed out and he lunged at me from my cupboard. He crawled up my bed quickly. Moving like an insect. He threw his hand over my mouth. I could taste chemicals, their faint sting on the tip of my tongue. 

“If you scream out to that slut again I’ll slit your fucking throat.” His eyes were dead. A droplet of blood fell from the cuts on his cheeks and dripped onto my neck. He pulled his hand from my mouth. “It’s me. It’s Jeff. We are friends. I know you. You’re bullying me. Why are you bullying me!?” 

“I’m not bullying you. I don’t know who you are.” I cried. A tear rolled down my face. Jeff held his face in his hands and he sobbed. 

“I hate bullies.” Jeff suddenly stopped sobbing and he looked up at me. “I hate them.”

“I’m sorry.” I said. Jeff leaned back and  made himself comfortable on the corner of my bed. I could see him completely now. He had long black pants on, his barefoot were stained and he was small. No larger then my big brother. He had a white hoodie and I noticed blood pooling around his wrists. Allowing droplets to break through the fabric and roll down his fingertips. He raised his knees to his chest. Out of the pockets of his pants something fell out. Jeff noticed and grabbed a severed finger from the sheet. 

“How did that get there?” Jeff laughed before throwing it over his shoulder. He pulled his attention back to me. He drooled for a moment, it slathered itself on his chin before he wiped it away with his sleeve. He pulled his hands up and dragged them through the thin black long hair atop his head. It cracked as he touched. Parts of it snapping off over his knuckles. 

“What do you want?” I asked Jeff. His face was dead, cold and lifeless. He began grinning and he pulled a knife from the sleeve of his jumper. 

“Just to have a chat.” Jeff rolled his sleeve up and raised the knife up before slashing the side of his arm. Blood spilled from it and he stared, smiling, as it poured down his arm. 

“What’s wrong with you?” I whispered. Jeff stopped when I said this. His face dropped and he looked me dead in the eyes. 

“What’s your name?” He asked me before pulling the knife up and dragging his tongue along the blade. I wanted to vomit. I wanted to lie. Tell him something different. 

“It’s Ben.” I answered, quietly. 

“No it’s not. No Ben was that fat fuck who drowned.” Jeff laughed. “It Louis. Lou. Whatever. I knew a Lou once. He was my brother. I think he was my brother. Maybe it was me. He got sent to jail when he was eleven years old. They rocked up and took him away. Can you believe that?”

“That’s not how jail works…” I trailed off as he stared at me. 

“That’s how it worked for me. My bigger self stood up for me.” Jeff tilted his head. His tongue had split when he licked it but now it was fine. Seemingly healed. “My brother got stabbed and they poured vodka on him and set him on fire. The bullies. One short and fat. One tall and skinny. One… like… none of those I guess. Real varied.” Jeff leaned down beside my bed and looked under it before popping back up. 

“You’re Jeff the Killer.” I murmured to him and he smiled again. A pool of blood formed under his jumper and it stained his hoodie. The blood coming from no where. 

“Maybe.” Jeff smiled. “Kind of wish they thought of a better name. Mr Widemouth was already taken.” Jeff reached his hands up to the cuts on his cheeks and dug his fingers inside of it. He pulled at them ripping a tear deeper in his cheeks. Tearing them up to his ears. 

“Are you going to kill me?” I asked already knowing the answer. 

“Yes.” He stared blankly at me. Blood pouring down his neck. He didn’t even try to hide it. He knew I was too scared to do anything. I still thought I could maybe talk my way out of this. Still thought that maybe I could live. 

“Why? What did I do wrong?” I cried. 

“You left your window open.” Jeff shrugged. He seemed to lose interest. He glanced around the room. He looked down at his hands and he splayed them out in front of himself. He cocked his head and looked at his left pinky finger. He gripped it with his right hand before snapping it. He examined his mangled finger and grinned. “The tall man lets me do what I want. One lady ate a fucking cat! Can you believe that?”

“No.” I pulled the sheet up to my eyes as I watched him. He leaned up a bit. His face was so uncanny. So broken. I could barely tell he was human. 

“How old are you?” Jeff cocked his head at me while he pulled the knife up. “Don’t lie to me, Louie. I know the answer.”

“I’m nine.” I whispered. Jeff smiled and crawled over to me. He had his knife up next to my face and I could hear it all, see it all, smell it all, feel it all. The blood that would randomly pool and disappear over his clothes. The sting of chemicals wafting off of him in the air. The paleness of his skin. The dead of his eyes. The lack of eyelids. The carvings in his cheeks. The smell of burnt hair. The sound of his breathing. So strained, so weak. Most of all, however, was the shape of him. The movement of him. Like a spider.

“Go to sleep.” He whispered to me before dragging the blade across my throat. I awoke again in the woods. Surrounded by a fog. Everything felt different. It felt strange. Surreal. I stood. I grabbed my neck only for my hand to glide right through my cut. I looked at my body and could see my flannel pyjamas had been ripped to shreds and I was covered in stab wounds. I ran passing by a tree with a paper stuck to it. I kept running passing that tree and endless amount of times. I looked down and could see my footprints. Surrounding me. The mud kicked up as my feet trampled the same square. The fog so close to my face I could barely make out anything around me. I turned and sprinted in the opposite direction. Running past the tree again. Then again. Then again. Then again. I stopped and felt a ringing in my ears. I was trapped in some sort of endless forest. I collapsed the ringing was distorting. My thoughts over taken. A pain through my mind. A cracking of a psyche. A pain I’ve never felt. I looked up as the fog darkened. A deep black mist surrounded me. My nose began bleeding. Followed by my ears. Then my eyes. I laid on the ground and I screamed in pain begging for it to stop. I opened my eyes and wiped the blood from them. Then I saw him. That’s when I saw the boogeyman.
