I never thought my life would turn into one of the awful stories we made fun of. Irony is a cruel beast.

I’m Hunter, co-host of *Creepcast*, the internet’s finest destination for reading, analyzing, the best stories and utterly eviscerating some of the worst horror stories ever posted online. What started as a passion project with my buddy Isaiah Mark Nichols turned into a full-fledged brand. People loved hearing us pick apart good stories and bad creepypastas, mocking the endless Mary Sues, the weird pasta clichés, and the sheer lack of effort some of these writers put in. But I never realized Isaiah loved the bad stories a little *too* much.

That became evident when he kidnapped me.

It started like any normal recording session. I came into our studio—a dingy, basement-level office—and found Isaiah already sitting at the table, grinning too widely. “Got a *killer* selection for today’s episode,” he said. “Real special stuff.”

I sat down, adjusted my mic, and then—

Darkness. A sharp pain at the back of my skull. And when I woke up, I was tied to a chair.

Isaiah stood over me, eyes bright with manic glee. “Welcome to the *Creepcast* special,” he announced. “Today, we force-feed Hunter the worst of the worst! No escape, no skipping, no fast-forwarding. Pure, unfiltered mediocrity.”

Jacoby, our sound engineer, was in on it too. She smirked as she adjusted the boom mic, making sure my suffering was captured in crisp, high-quality audio. 

I was forced to sit through the droning agony of "*I Dared My Best Friend to Ruin my life: The sequel", A*ll parts of "That thing in the basement is getting better at mimicking people"*, and Sonic Highschool.* —stories so atrociously dull I felt my soul leaking out through my ears. Every time I groaned or rolled my eyes, Isaiah giggled. “Yes, yes! *This* is the content people want!”

But then… salvation. An ad break.

While Jacoby adjusted the recording levels, I worked at my bindings. My hands, slick with sweat, wiggled free of the duct tape. The moment I felt them loosen, I didn’t hesitate—I bolted.

Now, I’m running. I don’t know where I am exactly, but I know one thing: Isaiah’s behind me.

Literally.

“Erm, he’s right behind me, isn’t he?” I whisper to myself, afraid to turn around.

“Yes, yes, Hunter. You’re running, that’s good. See, the key to survival is, well, to keep running,” Isaiah calls out, his voice lilting with amusement. “*Life, uh… finds a way.*”

I don’t stop. My breath burns in my lungs, and my feet slap against the cracked concrete of this basement hallway. There has to be an exit.

There has to be.

Jacoby steps out from a side corridor, her 7 foot tall body blocking my path. She holds up a fresh roll of duct tape. “Come on, man,” Isaiah says, holding up a fresh roll of duct tape. “You know we're just trying to make good content... We will be on the top charts in Spotify!”

“Not like this!” I snap, ducking under his arm. I take off again, heart hammering.

Isaiah’s laughter echoes behind me. “Oh, oh, oh, Hunter, *must go faster, must go faster!*”

I burst through a rusted door and find myself in an alley. Cold night air fills my lungs. I’m free.

Or so I think.

Isaiah emerges from the doorway, adjusting his anime style glasses, completely unfazed. “Well, well,” he murmurs, grinning. “You *did* get away. But tell me, Hunter—do you know what happens next?”

I take a step back, glancing around for help. Nothing but empty streets.

Isaiah leans forward, eyes twinkling. “*You never had control. That’s the illusion.*”

I hear footsteps behind me. Jacoby. I whirl around, but it’s too late. She slams something into my skull, and I crumple to the pavement. 

As I fade into unconsciousness, Isaiah’s voice is the last thing I hear:

“Now that’s what I call… a plot twist.”
