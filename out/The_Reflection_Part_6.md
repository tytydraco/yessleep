Like anyone who just got weird, supernatural "powers," I went straight to my best friend’s house.

Josh’s living room was cluttered in the way that only a lived-in space could be—half-empty snack bags, a few stray game controllers, and a coffee table covered in more condensation rings than actual coasters. The TV was on, playing some rerun of a show we’d both seen a hundred times, but I wasn’t paying attention to it.

I was too busy testing something.

“So, what are the odds,” I said, leaning back into his couch, “that the next commercial is for—let’s say—car insurance?”

Josh raised a skeptical eyebrow but grinned. “What, you psychic now?”

“Just humor me.”

He shrugged, grabbed a handful of chips, and turned his attention back to the screen. The current ad—a painfully boring infomercial about non-stick cookware—faded to black. Then, right on cue, a familiar jingle started playing.

“Save big on auto coverage with—”

Josh nearly choked on his chips. “Okay, that’s kinda freaky.”

I smirked. “Lucky guess.”

“Try another one.”

I did. And then another.

Every time, I got it right. Commercials, song shuffles, when his phone would buzz—like I had some invisible hand on the remote control of reality itself. Josh, at first, found it hilarious. He even started playing along, throwing out his own suggestions. But then it happened.

Josh had jokingly said, “Okay, if you’re some kind of wizard, make my doorbell ring right now.”

The second the words left his mouth—DING DONG.

We both stared at the door. The apartment intercom remained silent, no delivery notifications, no expected guests.

Josh slowly turned to me, the color draining from his face. “Tell me you set that up.”

I forced a laugh, even though my stomach had just dropped into my shoes. “Coincidence.”

Josh didn’t look convinced.

“Dude, come on,” I added, waving a dismissive hand. “We probably just—” I got up, opened the door. No one there. Just the empty hallway and a fading echo of something that shouldn’t have happened.

Josh was still staring when I sat back down. His expression wasn’t excitement anymore. It was something closer to fear. “Okay,” he said slowly, “explain. Now.”

I hesitated. Then, against my better judgment, I told him.

I expected him to laugh, to call me crazy. Instead, the more I explained, the more serious he got. When I told him about the entity’s “favors,” he practically grabbed me by the shoulders.

“Wait—so all it wants you to do is talk to them?”

I let out a short laugh, but there was no humor in it. “Yeah, sure. Not that simple.”

Josh scoffed. “Dude, are you hearing yourself? You’ve got some freaky mirror demon bending the universe in your favor, and all it wants is for you to make amends with your family?”

I clenched my jaw. It sounded easy when he said it like that. Just go home. Just knock on the damn door. Just say something.

But I couldn’t.

Even earlier today, when I stood on their porch, staring at the warm glow from inside, my fist hovered inches from the door. My breathing was shallow, my skin prickling with something that felt... wrong.

I could almost see it—my reflection in the porch window, watching me. Expectant.

I swallowed hard, took a step back. Then another.

And then I turned and walked away.

When I reached my car, I yanked open the door, but something made me pause. The windshield had fogged over, thick with condensation.

And there, carved into the misty glass with deep, jagged strokes, was a single phrase:

***"DO IT."***
