I know what the world believes.  
MH370—gone.  
Vanished over the sea.  
No wreckage.  
No survivors.  
No answers.

But I was on that flight.  
And I’m still here.

It was supposed to be a routine night flight.  
Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.  
Nothing special.

I was tired, irritable, just wanted to sleep.  
The man next to me had headphones on. The lights were low.  
A child was crying somewhere behind us.  
A flight attendant passed by, smiling kindly as she handed me water.

There was something odd in her eyes.  
Like she knew something we didn’t.

Around 1 a.m., the cabin settled.  
The engines hummed, steady and calming—almost like a heartbeat.

Then, the lights flickered.  
Once.  
Twice.  
Three times.

And then—  
silence.

Not just inside the plane.  
Everywhere.

It was as if someone had *turned off* the world.

There was no turbulence.  
No warning.  
No sense of falling.  
Only stillness.

And then a flash—blinding.  
A noise like static crashing through my skull.

And then—  
darkness.

I woke up, still in my seat.  
Strapped in.

But I wasn’t on the plane anymore.  
I was in a forest.

The ground was damp.  
Everything smelled like smoke and metal.

Above me: trees. Massive. Alien.  
Around me: wreckage scattered in impossible ways.

I stumbled, dizzy.  
My ears rang.  
Then I heard voices.

I wasn’t alone.  
About twenty of us had survived—somehow.  
Bruised, bleeding, terrified.

We banded together.  
Set up a makeshift camp.  
Tried to figure out where we were.

But nothing made sense.  
No working phones.  
No signal.  
No compass that pointed anywhere consistent.

And the forest…  
it wasn’t right.

The leaves shimmered faintly, like plastic.  
The trees breathed.  
I swear to God, they *breathed.*

On the third day, someone disappeared.

A young man claimed he saw lights deeper in the trees.  
He followed them.

We heard his footsteps fade into the distance.  
And then—nothing.

We found his shoes.  
Perfectly placed side by side.  
Beside a strange circle of scorched earth.

Others began sleepwalking.  
Muttering in languages they didn’t speak.  
One woman stared into the trees for hours, unblinking.  
As if something were whispering just beyond hearing.

Then we found the stone.

A massive black monolith in a clearing.  
Too smooth. Too clean.  
Covered in faint symbols—spirals, lines, circles.

And at night—it pulsed.  
Blue light.  
Slow. Steady.  
Like a heartbeat.

The days blurred together.  
Sometimes the sun would rise twice.  
Other times, not at all.

Time meant nothing here.

We tried to hold on.  
Tried to stay sane.

But this place…  
it devours sanity.

Not with teeth.  
With silence.  
With *repetition.*

People started to vanish.  
One by one.

Some ran into the woods.  
Some just… faded.

I stopped asking why.

Eventually, I was the only one left.  
Not all at once.  
It happened slowly—quietly.

I wandered through the forest, hoping to find a road.  
A village.  
A sign.

But the forest never ended.  
And sometimes… it moved.

Trees weren’t where they had been the day before.  
The wind carried whispers—voices I knew were dead.  
And at night, reflections would appear in the bark.  
Like mirrors.

But the reflection wasn’t mine.  
It smiled when I didn’t.  
It blinked when I stood still.

Then—one gray, breathless morning—I found the sea.

It was silent.  
Black.  
Motionless.

No waves.  
No wind.  
No gulls.

Just a still, endless surface.

I climbed to the top of a cliff overlooking it.  
I don’t know why.  
Instinct, maybe.  
Or whatever this place lets you still *have* of instinct.

And then—I heard it.

A low hum.  
Far away.

I looked up.  
And I saw it.

A plane.

Tiny.  
Circling slowly in the sky.  
Too high to be real.  
Like a shadow of a plane that once was.

I screamed.  
Waved.  
Begged.

But it never came closer.  
It didn’t see me.  
It couldn’t.

It was like a memory.  
Or an echo.  
Or worse—  
a *trap.*

I don’t know how long I’ve been here.  
I don’t even know *what* “here” is anymore.

But I want someone to know.  
Someone needs to know.

So I’ve carved this story into a piece of the wreckage—a chunk of metal from the wing.  
I’m going to throw it into the sea.

Maybe it’ll float.  
Maybe the current will take it somewhere.

Maybe you’re reading it now.

And if you are—

Don’t look for us.  
Don’t try to find the flight.  
Don’t try to explain what happened.

This place *wants* to stay hidden.  
And it’s *watching.*

If you ever fly across the South China Sea…  
and your lights flicker…  
and the engine noise fades…  
and you feel something just *beyond* your vision—

Close your eyes.  
And pray you don’t hear the hum.

Because if you do—  
you’re already here...
