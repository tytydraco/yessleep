The first time I drew a blank, it felt like a grenade detonated behind my eyes. The sensation was downright concussive. I feared an artery in my head may have popped, spilling hot, pressurized blood between the folds in my brain.

Now, though, I recount that painful moment as the last few seconds of happiness I may ever have in life.

Unless it chooses to forgive me.

- - - - -

Three days ago, I was watching my three-year-old son participate in his weekly gymnastics class, bouncing around the mat with the other rambunctious toddlers. Vanna, my ex-wife, was the one who enrolled him in the program, going on and on about the value of strengthening the parent-child bond through movement.

At the time, I thought it was a steaming load of new-age bullshit, and I wasn’t shy about letting her know. A year later, however, I was feeling significantly less sour about the activity. Alex seemed to enjoy blowing off steam with the other kids. More to the point, Vanna and I had long since finalized the divorce. I imagine that had *a lot* to do with my newfound openmindedness. Without that harpy breathing down my neck, I’d found myself in a bit of a dopamine surplus.

The instructor, a young man named Ryan, corralled all the screaming toddlers into a circle. Before they could shed their tenuous organization and dissolve back into chaos incarnate, Ryan pulled out something from an overstuffed chest of toys that kept the kids expectantly glued to their assigned seats on the mat: a massive rainbow-colored parachute, an instant crowd-pleaser if there ever was one.

A few parents aided in raising the parachute. Ryan shouted *“go!”,* and the electrified kids descended into the center like they were storming the shores of Normandy. It wasn’t really a game, per se: more a repetitive cycle of anticipation followed by release. The children relished each step of the process - eagerly waiting in a circle, gleefully erupting under the tarp once signaled, and then escaping before the parents could lower it in on top of them, trapping any stragglers beneath the pinwheel-patterned tarp. Rinse and repeat.

That’s when it hit me. This absolute sucker punch of Déjà vu. The sight of the falling parachute reminded me of something.

But for the life of me, I couldn’t figure out what.

*Give it a second,* I thought. *You know how these things are. The moment you stop looking, that’s when you get the answer. Memory is a bashful machine. Doesn’t work too well under pressure.*

So there I was, watching the wispy parachute sink to the floor like a flying saucer about to make contact with the earth, and I could barely stand up straight. My head was throbbing. My scalp was on fire. Tinnitus sung its shrill melody in my ears.

Pat was having the time of his life, and I was being pummeled on the sidelines, thunderous blows landing against my skull every time I drew a blank.

*What does this remind me of?* Thud.

*What does this remind me of?* Thud.

*What does this remind me of?* Thud.

The room spun, my head felt heavy, and I fell forward.

Right before I hit the ground, I had one last thought.

*It’s probably nothing. I should just forget about it.*

That assumption, while reasonable, was flawed, and the flaw wasn’t within the actual content of the assumption. No, it was how it sounded in my head.

The voice resembled mine, but it sounded subtly different.

Like it was something trying to mimic my internal monologue.

The imitation was close, but it wasn’t perfect.

\- - - - -

*“Thankfully, we don’t believe you had a stroke.”*

Despite the positive news, I still felt guarded. The doctor kept dodging the question I cared most about getting to the bottom of.

*“So, what do you think the tarp reminded me of?”*

A frown grew over her face.

*“Like I was saying, the imaging looked normal. The cat scan, the MRI of your head, the x-ray of your neck - all they showed was…”*

Abruptly, the doctor’s voice became muffled. The words melted on their journey between her throat and mouth, congealing with each other to form a meaningless clump of jellied noise by the time they arrived at my ears.

*“What was that last part?”* I asked, cupping my hand around my ear and turning it towards her.

She glared at me, bloodshot eyes boiling over with rising frustration.

*“The top of your head has some -* ***garbled noise*** *- and I imagine that’s from -* ***more garbled noise***\*”\*

Her voice dipped in and out of clarity like the transmissions from a FM radio while deep in the woods, holding on to a thin thread of signal for dear life.

Out of an abundance of politeness, I didn’t bother asking again, and I couldn’t think of a straightforward way to express what was happening to me. Instead, I gave up. I simply accepted the circumstances, concluding the universe didn’t want me to have the information, pure and simple.

In the end, my gut instinct was correct: there was a good reason to shield me from that information. It just wasn’t some unknowable cosmic force creating the barrier.

I smiled, but I suppose there was still a trace of confusion left somewhere in my expression, because the doctor repeated herself one more time, in a series of a slow, over-enunciated shouts. No matter how loud she talked, the message came out garbled. I imagine she could have screamed those words at me and I still wouldn’t have been able to hear them. That said, I could read her lips perfectly fine when she slowed it all down.

*“YOU HIT YOUR HEAD ON THE PAVEMENT AND THAT CAUSED SOME SWELLING OVER YOUR SCALP. YOU HAVE SOME OTHER PROBLEMS TOO.”*

*“Pavement?”* I replied. *“How the hell did my head hit the pavement from inside the gym?”*

\- - - - -

When I got back to the farm later that night, I plopped down into my favorite recliner and meticulously read through my discharge paperwork.

I would have been confident it wasn’t mine if it didn’t have my name all over it.

First off, it reiterated the doctor’s claim that I hadn’t been inside the gym when I passed out. Per the EMS notes, I lost consciousness *right outside* of the gym, splintering the front window with my fall before eventually slamming my forehead against the pavement.

Not only that, but it detailed all of my newly diagnosed disorders:

**R63.4:** *Severe weight loss*

**D50.81:** *Iron deficiency anemia due to dietary causes*

**D52.0:** *Folate deficiency, unknown origin, assumed dietary*

**D51.3:** *Vitamin b12 deficiency, unknown origin, assumed dietary*

And the list just went on and on. A never-ending log of what seemed like semantic and arbitrarily defined dysfunctions. They even went so far as to categorize *Tobacco Use* as a billable disorder.

*“What a bunch of crap,”* I whispered, launching the packet over my shoulder. I heard it rustle to the floor as I picked up the remote and switched on *Wheel of Fortune.* I was in the best shape of my life. Lean and muscular from the hours I spent laboring over the crops, day in and day out. Call me a narcissist all you want, but I enjoyed the view on the other side of the mirror. I worked for it. Earned it. I was as healthy as a horse, fit as a fiddle, et cetera, et cetera.

To my dismay, I couldn’t focus. Or, more accurately, I couldn’t lose myself in what’s always been my favorite game show. My mind kept nagging at me. Kept dragging my attention away from the screen.

*What did that tarp remind me of?*

Thankfully, the physical sensation that came with drawing a blank wasn’t as explosive as it had been earlier that day. I didn’t limply slump to the floor dead or succumb to a grand mal seizure just because of a so-called “brain fart”. Instead, it became a constant irritation. A pest. Every time I couldn’t answer the question it felt like a myriad of lice were crawling overhead, tilling ridges into my scalp with their chitinous pincers, making it fertile soil for their kind to live off of.

I scratched hard, dug my nails into the skin of my head with zeal, but the itch wouldn’t seem to abate.

When the doorbell chimed, I didn’t even realize I’d drawn blood. My fingers felt wet as I paced to the door.

I was reaching out to unlock it when I saw the time on a nearby grandfather clock.

*11:52PM*

*Who the hell was at the door?* I contemplated. My closest neighbor was at least a fifteen-minute drive away.

I stood on my tiptoes so I could peer through the frosted glass panel at the top of the door. I grimaced as the floorboards whined under my weight, worried the noise would alert potential burglars of my position.

I scanned the view. No one was there, but it looked like someone *had* been there, because they’d left something. I could see it draped over the porch steps. I squinted my eyes, trying to identify the object through the blurry window.

Eventually, it came to me, but I had a hard time comprehending what I was seeing. The pinwheel pattern on the fabric was undeniable.

It was the parachute.

Not only that, but there was something stirring under it. Initially, I theorized there was a mouse or some other small critter trapped beneath the tarp. But then, it started inflating.

*They* started inflating.

At first, they were just a pair of bubbles. Domed boils popping out of the fabric. Over a few seconds, however, they’d grown into two heads. It was like they were being pushed straight up by a motorized lifted from a hole beneath the parachute, even if that made no earthly sense. The movements were smooth and silent, and the tarp curved in and bulged out where it needed to in order to create the impression of a face on each of them. Then shoulders, then torsos, and so on. One was tall, and the other short. A parent and a child holding hands, by my estimation.

Icy disbelief trickled through my veins like an IV drip. I blinked rapidly. Rubbed my eyes until they hurt. Procured my glasses from the breast pocket of my flannel with a tremulous hand and slipped them on.

Nothing changed.

Once they fully formed, there was a minute of inactivity. I stared at them, the muscles in my feet burning from standing on my toes for so long, praying for the phantoms to deflate or for me to wake up from this bizarre nightmare.

And with perfect timing, that unanswerable question began knocking on the inside of my skull once again. Internally and externally, hellish forces assailed my sanity.

*What did that tarp remind me of?* Thud.

*What did that tarp remind me of?* Thud.

*Where is Pat? Wasn’t I watching him at the gym earlier? Did he get taken to the ER with me? Is he with Vanna?*

Larger thud.

*It’s probably nothing. I should just forget about him.* \- chimed another, unidentifiable voice in my head, low and raspy. That time, it wasn’t even trying to sound like me.

The phantoms tilted their heads.

They pointed their hollow eyes at the frosted glass and soundlessly waved at me.

I sprinted to my bedroom on the opposite side of the house, slammed the door shut, and barricaded myself against it, as if they were going to find a way inside and come looking for me.

Panic seethed through my body. I started to hyperventilate while clawing at my scalp. Waves of vertigo threatened to send me careening onto the floor.

My eyes fixed on the window aside my bed, which I habitually kept open at night to cool down the room and smoke when the urge called for it. I yelped and dashed across the room to close it, terrified that the figures might slither through the breech if I didn’t. My hand landed on the window but slipped off before I get a stable enough grip to slam it down.

I paused, bringing four sticky fingers up to my face. The ones that had been digging so voraciously into my scalp.

The substance was warm like blood.

It smelled like blood, too. My sinuses were clogged with the scent of copper tinged sickly sweet.

But it wasn’t red.

It was a deep, nebulous black.

The next few seconds are a bit hazy. Honestly, I think that’s what allowed my survival instinct to get the upper hand. If I stopped for too long, if I gave the situation too much thought, I believe it would have had enough time to take back control.

My hand shot into my jeans, grabbed my lighter, and flicked it on next to my scalp.

A high-pitched squeal erupted around me, somehow from both the outside and the inside of my head. The shrill cry bleated within my mind just as much as it screamed from the surface of my skull, if not more.

I held firm. The tearing pain was immeasurable and profound. It felt like the skin was being flayed from my scalp with a rusty knife, spasmodic and imprecise, one uneven strip after another being ripped from the bone. Inky blood rained down my neck and onto my shoulders. The warmth was nauseating.

The squeal became fainter in my mind until it disappeared completely. It continued outside of me, but became distant and was punctuated by a thick *plop*, similar to the sound of deli meats hitting a countertop.

There was a circular slice of twitching flesh below me. It writhed and twisted in place, like a capsized turtle, rows of jagged teeth glinting in and out of the moonlight as it struggled. The flesh was skin-toned at first, but the color darkened to match the brown of the floorboards before too long.

Camouflage was its specialty.

Eventually, the parasite righted itself, teeth facing down. From there, it glided up the side of the wall with a surprising amount of grace, skittered over the edge of the window, and vanished into the night.

Observing it move finally gave me the answer to that hideous, nagging question.

*What did that tarp remind me of?*

Well, it reminded me of that black-blooded life form.

With it detached from my scalp, I’ve discovered the vaguest shred of a memory hidden in the back of my mind, likely from the night it grafted itself to me in the first place.

*My eyes flutter open, and there’s something descending on me, floating through the air with its wispy edges flapping in the gentle breeze.*

*Like the parachute I saw through the window of that gym.*

I’ve always wanted a family. Life isn’t always kind enough to give you what you want, however, no matter how honest your desire is.

I inherited my father’s farm after he died about a year ago. Moved out to the country, hoping I’d have more luck conjuring a meaningful life there than I ever did in the city.

I don’t know how long that thing was attached to me, but it was long enough to let my family’s land fall into a state of disrepair.

All it wanted me to do was eat and rest, after all.

The soil hasn’t been worked in months, fields of dead and decaying crops rotting over every inch of the previously fertile ground.

The house is a mess. The plumbing has been broken for some time, causing water leaks in the walls and ceiling. Shattered windows. Empty cans and food waste scattered haphazardly over every surface.

Still managed to pay the electricity bill, apparently. Can’t miss *Wheel of Fortune.*

Worst of all, I’m broken. Starved, completely depleted of nutrients, sucked dry. Looked in the mirror this morning, a damn mistake. What I saw wasn’t lean, nor muscular - I’m shockingly gaunt. Ghoulish, even. I can see each individual rib with complete and horrific clarity.

The first day I was free, I found myself angry. Livid that my life had been commandeered by that *thing*.

But the following day, I had a certain shift in perspective.

I asked myself, could I think of a time in my life better than when it was selectively curated and manipulated by that parasite?

Honestly, I couldn’t.

Sure, it wasn’t perfect. God knows why I projected myself as divorced in that false existence. Still, I was contented. Now, I hate my subconsciousness more than I hate the parasite. It just *had* to fight for control, even if that meant my happiness got obliterated in the crossfire.

I mean, at the end of the day, what’s preferrable: a beautiful fiction or a grim truth?

I know what I’d pick. In fact, I’m trying to pick it again. Every night, I pray for its return. I hope it can forgive me.

All I’m saying is this:

If you live in rural Pennsylvania, and you despise how your life played out, consider sleeping with your window open.

Maybe you’ll get lucky, like me.

Maybe you’ll get a taste of a beautiful fiction,

If only for a brief, [fleeting moment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
