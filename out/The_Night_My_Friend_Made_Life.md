“Matthew…What the hell is this?”


My friend, Matthew, had asked me to come over for the night to help him with a little “project” he had been working on for the last few weeks. Granted, I hadn’t seen him for those weeks so I assumed it must have been very personal for him so I agreed almost immediately. But as I stood there confused in my friend’s basement, staring down at the mass underneath a blanket laying on a table, I wish I didn’t.


“It’s what I've been working on.”


“And what you’ve been working on is?” I responded in an annoyed tone.


“Do you seriously not remember? We were watching that movie a few weeks ago and I said I was gonna try and do the same thing.” 


I narrowed my eyes at him, not entirely sure if Matt was messing with me or he really thinks I remembered a movie we watched weeks ago.


“No Matt, I don’t. How about you refresh my memory so I can better understand what the hell I’m looking at on your table.”


He let out a slight sigh. “We were watching those old horror movies and the one with the scientist and the monster came on? You made a joke about how it would be cool if someone could actually do that and I said I probably could if I had the time? Well, here it is.” He gave me a smile before looking down at the table. It took a moment for my mind to remember exactly what he was talking about. 


“Are you talking about Frankenstein?! I was high as shit that night. Why would you take anything I said with actual seriousne-“ I cut myself off as my gaze roamed over the mass, slowly recognizing the outline as a silhouette. 


“Matthew…what exactly is under this blanket?”


“It’s the monster from the movie.” He reached down and pulled the blanket back. “Well it’s the closest I could get. I’m no expert on this stuff.”


The best way I can describe what I saw was as Matt had said, The Monster from Frankenstein. Well it at least kinda looked like it. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the greenish hue that we know. Instead, it was a mix of skin tones with varying degrees of age and damage to each part; a busted up black forearm from a teen and a older looking white chest with scars on it just to name a few. The fingers on the right hand were mismatched, all different sizes and colors. The face was a mixed up jigsaw of at least 5 different people from what I could tell. 


I stared in horror at the unsightly creation laying on the table and without thinking, grabbed Matt’s shirt collar, pushing him against the nearest wall. 


“What in the FUCK did you do!?” I screamed as loud as my voice would allow me.


“W-What? I did what you said, I made the thing from the movie.” He looked at the table and then to me, hoping I would understand him. 


“Where the hell did you get these…things from?! Jesus Matt…did you-“ He cut me off before I could finish. “Christ of course not, I’m not a murderer dude. I've been getting them from the hospital.”


I stared at him, still in disbelief at what he had done. “You know how I've been working at the hospital for a while now? Well, when we would have accidental deaths or organ transplants going around, I would…take some stuff.” He smiled at me.


“Stuff?! This isn’t stuff man, this is parts of people!” I let go of his collar and started to pace around the room, covering that…thing back up with the blanket.


“Look, you said it would be cool if someone made the thing.” He held his hands out for me to look back at the table. “So I made it! Now I just gotta make it come to life somehow...” 


“Do you hear yourself right now? Do you hear how absolutely fucking insane you sound?! Make it come to life? That was a movie Matthew! It’s not real!”


“Oh well, I guess you don’t wanna help me then. Fine, you sit there and I’ll just finish up the rest.” He threw his arms down like a child having a tantrum. He pulled the blanket back on the corpse, leaving its head and upper chest exposed. He pulled out some nails from his pocket and started to push them into various areas of the rotting skin and tissue. I just stared in shock and disgust. How could my friend have done something like this? How could he be so nonchalant about all this? 


I took note of the rotten menagerie on the table as Matthew attached wires and cords to the nails. I stood up from my chair and walked towards the stairs to leave.


I slammed the basement door shut once I was upstairs and made my way to the front door. I could hear a storm starting up outside as the windows were hit with thick droplets of rain. Along with the rain I could hear footsteps running up from the basement as it flung open. 


“Where the hell are you going?” Matthew spoke in the doorway with deflating lungs. I turned to look at him just before I opened the door to leave.


“Home, Matt. I’m going home.”


“But why? I just finished putting the last wire in and the extension cord is all hooked up.”


“Matthew, listen to yourself. You’re crazy, those are pieces of dead people sitting on your basement coffee table! Do you really think a few strands of wire connected to an extension cord is gonna do anything?”


“But the movie…You said you wanted someone to do it?”


“Matt I know you're not that stupid, IT WAS A MOVIE FOR CHRIST SAKE! IT WASN’T REAL!”


Matt had an angered look in his eyes as he slammed the basement door and walked towards me.


“You know what, fuck you. I spent the past month and then some to get this ready for you and this is how you thank me?”


“Thank you? I should thank you for stealing dead people’s body parts?”


“I worked hard on this!”


“Yeah? And what are you gonna do when you power up the cord and nothing happens?”


I could hear the storm outside getting stronger. Heavy rain and cracks of thunder could be heard. I swore the shingles of the house were gonna get ripped off in an instant. 


“I don’t need this, just leave if you’re gonna be like this.” 


“I am and when your little experiment doesn’t work, don’t come calling me for help!”


Just then, the house was filled with the sound of thunder. It was deafening, louder than anything I had heard before. The living room lights flared up before you could hear the filaments inside them burst. Matt and I were now standing in the dark.


“Great, we’re both pissed and now the powers out.” Matt walked into the kitchen and started searching through the drawers.


I stood at the front door, the storm getting worse and worse outside. Soon, Matt walked up to me and handed me a flashlight. “Here, I’m gonna go mess with the breaker until it turns back on. When I get back we’re gonna have a real conversation about this.”


“I said I was leaving and that’s final.” I tried to hand him back the flashlight but he pushed my hand back.


“Please, just stay inside until I get back. The storm is getting worse and you can’t possibly drive in this.” Matt looked at me with a desperation in his eyes.


I had known Matt for almost 15 years. I knew he was a good man, but I also knew he was stupid. Here I was yelling when my friend, my best friend, needed serious help. I sighed as I looked at him.


“Fine”


Matt smiled at me before grabbing his coat from the hanger and moving past me to the front door.


“I’ll be right back.”


Matt opened the door and I could already feel the cold wind from the storm. The trees by his neighbor's house were close to being ripped up and flying away at this point. He nodded to me before closing the door behind him, leaving me alone in the house.


It had been 10 minutes and neither Matt nor the power was back. I was starting to get worried that he might have tripped outside on something and was now just laying in this storm. I went to the hanger to grab my jacket so I could go out and check on him when I heard something from downstairs in the basement. I turned my head towards the door and kept hearing what sounded like loud footsteps almost right beneath me. As quietly as I could, I made my way to the door and slowly pulled it open, standing face to face with the darkness below me.


I turned my flashlight on and pointed it down, shining it on the carpet by the bottom of the stairs. I could still hear the footsteps by this point, they sounded louder and more frantic but my line of sight remained clear of anything. I swallowed my fear and called out.


“Is anyone down there? Matt? Did you come back in through the hatch?”


Matthew’s basement, while finished, had an opening hatch that led to the backyard through a back room and some stairs. I assumed that maybe he was hurt and instead of trying to get back in through the front door he just went through the hatch. I slowly stepped deeper into the dark, my light moving up from the carpet and into the sitting area where me and Matt had been earlier that night. That’s when I saw the blanket on the floor and the empty table.


I could feel my heart stop for a moment as l stood there, staring down the barrel of this haunting reality. The corpse, that hulk of stitched body parts with nails and wires, was gone. So was the cord that connected it to an electrical box. The box was still there on the floor and I followed it’s cable to an outlet in the wall. When the electricity surged in the house…some of it must have found its way into “it”.


I continued to stare at the table until something caught my eye from the corners of darkness the flashlight could not reach. Just behind the wall leading to the back room, I could see the outline of a person. But the outline was wrong, so very wrong wrong. I quickly pointed the flashlight towards it and all I could see were the 5 distinct fingers moving back into the darkness. I let out a slight scream before I covered my mouth. 


Just then I could hear the front door swing open and then Matt’s voice following it. “The whole breaker is shot! I can’t fix it!” I didn’t respond, just stared in silence. Matt made his way to the basement door and stared down at me.


“Hey, what is it? Why are you down there?”


I swallowed what I could into my dry throat and looked up at him, slowly speaking.


“It’s down here, moving…”


Matt looked at me confused for a second before his eyes widened with a mix of excitement and terror. He silently looked at me and signaled to walk back up slowly. I nodded before slowly stepping up the stairs behind me. As I did, I could see the shadow of the thing move from its cover behind the wall and stare at me. 


Its eyes, two different shapes and colors stared at me as the flashlight pointed at it. Its shape was huge, taking up most of the light's space. It’s stitching leaked a mix of red blood and yellow bile from ripped veins. I could hear it breath and try to make sounds which came out as moans and grunts. With every step back I took, it took one closer to me. 


I was at the top of the stairs when it finally reached the bottom step. Once I was standing on the kitchen floor it started to walk up the steps towards us. I quickly slammed the door shut and all we heard was the loud slams and bangs from the other side, mixed with screams and grunts of both anger and confusion. We both looked at each other with mixed faces of horror and amazement. Matt’s creation was alive, it didn’t have a clue as to why it was here and it was angry.


I heard it almost tumble back down the steps as it made its way into the basement. I looked at Matt as he held his shaking hands. I locked the basement door slowly before stepping away towards Matt, grabbing his arm.


“We need to leave, now.” I quietly spoke to him, trying to keep my voice as low as I could so as to not alert the thing below us. He didn’t respond. Just stared at his hands while nodding. I didn’t know what Matt was thinking. Maybe he wasn’t thinking of anything and he was just in shock at seeing his creation walking around instead of laying lifeless on the table. Either way, I knew that we had to leave because that thing was getting more and more angry downstairs. I could hear it slamming and trashing everything down there. It tried to scream a few times to the best of its abilities but it just came out mumbled and wet.


“Matt, Now.” I grabbed his shoulder which seemed to snap him out of his trance. He nodded at me as we slowly made our way towards the front of the house. I was grabbing my car keys as we heard a crashing sound from below us. Then, silence. We looked at each other, waiting for the sounds to continue downstairs but it just stayed quiet. Then Matt’s face went whiter than it had been.


“The hatch…” he whispered. “I… did I lock it?


“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me, Matt!” I snapped in a hushed tone. I took a deep breath, rubbing the bridge of my nose with shaky hands.“Ok…We just have to make it to my car and we should be fine…” 


I grabbed the door knob ready to swing it open but something in my gut stopped me. I got this sense of dread just from being close to the door. I let go of the knob and backed up slightly. Matt just stared at me, confused for a moment before it seemed he too got that same feeling. We both looked at the door and listened as we could hear the slight sound of harsh breathing from behind it.


Matt backed up more until he was standing in the open area of the living room. I just stayed, hoping I would hear the breathing distance itself from us but no luck. Occasionally I heard it push against the door, listening to the wood creak as if it was going to break in an instant. I turned to face Matthew to discuss what we could do when a hard pounding came from behind me. The thing was getting more restless. I could hear it screaming to the best of its abilities as the door took more and more hits. It got so loud it eventually drowned out the sound of the storm.


“Fuck! What the hell are we supposed to do?!” I started to pace around the room. The slams became harder as I could hear it become more enraged. Matt was looking down at his hands, fidgeting with them before he stood up and walked towards the kitchen. 


“Where are you going? Did you think of something?” I followed him towards the back of the house.


“Yeah, I’m gonna go out and distract it.”


“I’m sorry, what did you just say?”


“I’m gonna go out through the back door and get its attention. Then you can make a break for your car and get out of here.” Matthew sounded like he was struggling to get the last part of the plan out when he said it.


“Like hell you are? I’m not gonna let you go out there with that-“ He cut me off before I could finish.


“Look man, I’m the one who made you come over here. This was my stupid idea and it fucking backfired, so let me make it right by getting you out of here. Ok?”


I just looked at him as the pounding from the door got more and more difficult to drown out. I wanted to argue with him about it but I knew I couldn’t. My friend Matthew was many things but one thing he wasn’t was selfish. Nothing I said was gonna change his mind and I had to accept that. I pulled him into a hug without even thinking.


“You gotta promise me you’ll be ok, alright?” 


He chuckled before pulling away. “Of course man, who else are you gonna watch horror movies with?” We both laughed a bit before he made his way to the back door.


“You’re gonna hear when he leaves the door. Once he does, just book it to the car and go. I’ll call you once I’m safe.”


I nodded as he smiled at me and headed into the basement. A few moments later, I heard screaming outside from Matt. The pounding at the front door stopped and the monster grew quiet as the yelling made its way to the back of the house, slowly drifting away. Quickly, I pulled the door open and ran out towards the driveway, getting to my car before jumping in. I just stared at the house for a moment before turning on the ignition and speeding out of there.


I waited 3 days after that night for a phone call from Matt. Every second I was on edge as I expected either Matt or that thing to find me. I should have known I wasn’t gonna get a call from him but something inside me just hoped things would turn out ok. 


Last week, I got a call from Matt’s family telling me he was found dead in his house. The police got a call from neighbors about a noise complaint and when they went to check they found Matt in the basement. He was practically mutilated from what they told the family, not even letting them see the body after they got him out of there. It was ruled a murder but they couldn’t find any evidence of who could have done it as the scene was littered with different finger prints of deceased people.


But I know who did it, or more like what did it. Matt probably knew he wasn’t gonna make it out alive but it doesn’t make it any better knowing I have to live with the knowledge that he died for me. I know I should feel so guilty for everything. Matt created the monster and he was the one who came up with that plan, but… I couldn’t help but feel like it was all my fault. After all, I was the one who got him into horror movies in the first place. I also have to accept that it’s still out there. Who knows where it could be but I have a feeling that it’s looking for me. It’s watching me from afar, waiting to catch me off guard and do to me what it did to Matt. I just have to wait and listen for it. Listen for its breaths and moans of pain as it wonders and ask why it’s alive. As it wonders who made it and how it can get revenge for what they did.
