After years of using my ability for the greater good, I learnt the terrifying lesson that there *is* no such thing as the greater good.

Playing God comes at a price.

When did I first learn of my perturbing power? My tenth birthday party stands out in my mind. I remember eyeballing the chocolate cake and being overcome by this horrible twisting sensation — as if someone were wringing out my guts like a damp towel.

I didn’t see the future, as such. Craig, the family cat, pounced onto the party table, and the sun blazed brightly as I giggled. But when I considered swatting him away, a grey cloud rapidly formed in the sky.

Craig made the decision for me, greedily gorging on the chocolate gateaux — only stopping when my mum eventually ran over and tore him away. Nobody else ate a slice. And that ended up being a good thing. Craig fell sick from food poisoning.

I started to see signs everywhere, and they were never wrong. I had an innate intuition that others did not.Whenever I chose the darkness — a grey cloud, a burst lightbulb, or simply a heaviness in my soul — many people suffered.

Whenever I chose the light — sunshine, dazzling lights, or a sense of righteousness in my very being — only one or two people would suffer.

I learnt about the trolley problem during my university philosophy course. This hypothetical ethical issue involves a choice. You can allow a trolley to continue on its course, killing 5 people tied to a train track. Alternatively, you can pull a lever to divert the trolley’s course, saving those 5 people but killing 1 other on an alternate track.

“Which option is morally right?” I asked my professor.

John shrugged. “That’s the problem, Danny. Neither. But if you really want my opinion, I believe inaction *is* action.”

I didn’t really understand what that meant until the horrific night of December 5th, 2015. The night on which I vowed to ignore signs from the universe and never again divert the trolley from its natural course.

I was on a trip to Edinburgh with my fellow philosophy students. A bleak evening drive. A torrential downpour of rain. Floods across south-west Scotland.

There were 27 of us on a coach. I want you to remember that number whilst I explain the following horrifying events. I hope you can understand why I did what I did.

“What’s wrong, Danny?” My friend, Hattie, asked.

My body started involuntarily twitching as the overhead lights spontaneously shattered, plunging the coach into darkness. A few people screamed, and John tried to calm everybody down, but I barely registered what was happening.

I was visualising the stagecoach as a trolley hurtling towards danger. I had a decision to make, but what was it? It was different from any crossroads I’d ever faced before.

I’d never felt such horror.

I rose to my feet and charged down the aisle. I tuned out every sound, focusing my attention on finding the light. What decision was the universe trying to present to me? What could I do to ensure the greatest good?

And then I found the answer.

As the driver rounded a sharp bend, the tyres skidded in a puddle on the road. Every passenger screeched as we watched the edge of the road approach — the road atop a steep hill.

A thought crossed my mind, and an overhead light sprang into action. My soul was filled with an immense wholeness. The light had found me. I knew what to do to ensure the greater good.

I lurched towards the steering wheel, wrestling it to the left — steering us directly into the drop. I don’t know what sparked the idea. It seemed hellish. A death sentence. But the light had never steered me wrong before. I always trusted my intuition.

I diverted the coach’s course directly into a large oak tree just over the edge of the hill — on a practically vertical decline. The front of the bus crumpled into the bark, immediately puncturing the driver’s body with wood and contorted metal. I had fallen to the floor, splintering several bones in my body and suffering heavy internal bleeding.

But if not for that, we all would’ve hurtled hundreds of feet to our deaths. Right?

Dazed and in agonising pain, I looked up the coach aisle — yes, *up*. The bus was suspended at a downward angle, blocked by the oak tree from a deathly descent down the humongous hill. Everybody was wearing a seatbelt, thankfully. There were bloody faces and minor injuries, but nearly everybody made it. Everybody except the bus driver and...

“No…” John wailed.

The lecturer fell to his knees, clutching Gene’s cold, lifeless hand in his own. The pane behind the driver’s seat had shattered, and shards of glass had torn through Gene’s body. It was clear in that moment, if it hadn’t previously been, that John and Gene had some sort of romantic connection.

The tall, looming lecturer, red-eyed and snot-nosed, spun his head to face me. His deranged expression was exacerbated by the sea of cuts and bruises on his face — I’d never seen the humble, genial man look so utterly demented and monstrous.

“You…” He snarled.

The man lunged towards me, and his hands were around my throat before I’d even processed what was happening. Terror gripped me as I felt the world fade away. There was no light. No choice available to me. The only joy I felt, for a fleeting moment, came from the rare freedom I experienced. It was beautiful to not have to worry about which option to choose. My fate was out of my hands.

And then John’s hands fell from my neck. I choked, glancing up to see Hattie standing over our professor with her bag in her hands — the weapon that she had used to bludgeon him.

“I need to… This little shit… *He killed her*!” John screamed. “Why, Danny? Why did you steer us over the edge?”

“I… I just… Inaction is action,” I eventually whispered.

Using his own words against him was foolish. John’s eyes widened, and Hattie thumped him with the bag again as he prepared to lunge at me a second time. But in a reflexive instinct, John grabbed the petite girl by the wrist and flung her over his shoulder.

Perhaps he hadn’t taken the steep decline of the bus into account. That’s what I tell myself. But we helplessly watched with terrified, gawping mouths as Hattie’s body cascaded through the glassless opening that had been the coach’s front windshield.

I still have nightmares of my friend plummeting down that hill. The thuds of her body hitting the rough earth and rocks as she tumbled endlessly, a limp rag-doll lost in the night. I hope she died quickly. I hope she didn’t experience the terror of falling the entire way.

24 people survived. John was imprisoned for manslaughter. A light sentence. I faced charges, but a strong legal defence managed to make my case. I was trying to save people.

But the *Not Guilty* verdict still doesn’t absolve me of my guilt. After all, who was I to choose one life over another? How can I say with any certainty who would or wouldn’t have died if I’d left the steering wheel untouched?

I certainly wouldn’t have transformed John into the petrifying killer he became.

That’s why I don’t trust the light anymore. Who’s to say that the greater good is good at all?
