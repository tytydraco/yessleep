We all watched as Warren entered the house from the external camera, and seconds later showing up on the two internal ones. First, just a glimpse from the living room camera as he walked past the mirror that we’d seen before, then as he showed up in the kitchen cam, which also showed a bit of the hallway, and the woman that still laid there. 


-	“Warren!” I said in the video chat, “Can you hear me?”
-	“Yeah, barely” he responded with a crackling sound, like bad reception. “The door was like, open, it just slowly opened up when I knocked”.
-	“How is she?” Jen said in a nervous voice, “Is she alright, is she breathing?”.
-	“There’s… no one here!”, Warren responded almost as with a question, with every other syllable disappearing in the static.
-	“What do you mean there’s no one there, we can see you both on the kitchen camera!” Henry said.
-	“Look for yourselves!” Warren said and flipped the camera towards the hallway floor. And just as he said, there was no one, nothing. Not a trace of anyone. We could clearly see him on the kitchen camera doing all the things we saw through the video chat. We saw him film the floor and surroundings, only when we saw it through the security camera, the woman was clearly laying right by Warrens feet.


-	“This is too weird”, Ali said with a worried tone. “I think you should get out of there Warren.” We all agreed.
-	You’ve done what you can man,” I said. “But there is clearly something really messed up going on here and you’re in the middle of it right now. I think you should leave!
-	“Yeah, maybe you guys are right”, Warren said, still with the crackling sounds and breaking up on every other word. “Let me just check the living room real quick”.
We all sighed, “Come on man, just get out and go home!”, Henry added while we all watched Warren take the turn from the kitchen to the living room, slowly making his way through the house. 


A shill so cold that it’s almost impossible to describe went through my spine as I saw in my peripheral view how the woman on the kitchen camera suddenly slowly got up from her position that she had been in for several hours now. It almost looked like someone dragged her up, as if she didn’t tense up at all as you do when you’re sitting up from a lying position. She just sat there now, in the hallway, staring straight ahead. 
-	“Warren!” Henry almost screamed, seeing the same thing that I did. “Get out, now!!”


We all saw how Warren was speaking into his phone, but all we heard were static now, and the video feed in the chat was just pixels breaking up.


-	“Warren!” Jen said even louder. “Can you hear us?! Get out now! She’s up! Somethings is not right, please hear us and get out!!


Warren was still not noticing the woman, and clearly not hearing our cries for him to leave. Still slowly going through the living room, stopping to inspects books on the bookshelf, looking at pictures on the wall. 
At the same time, the woman had now gone from a sitting to standing position, her head was turned to the left, towards the living room, like an animal, listening for its pray. 


-	“Warren!” I screamed so loud that the sound got distorted in my headphones, but still no response.


The woman slowly started to walk into the kitchen, towards the living room. Warren stood there, with his back to her, a book in his hands inspecting it. It looked like he was talking and filming it, like he hadn’t even noticed that there was no connection in the chat anymore. There was nothing we could do but scream his name and pray he’d hear us. The woman was closing in, one slow step at a time, and still, he didn’t seem to notice her.
I was literally shaking my screen, screaming out his name, as were the others, but we all saw how the woman finally came up behind him, and with a slow movement, raised her arm as to grab him by the shoulder.


-	“Warren!!” Ali screamed in a last attempt to warn him. But to no avail.


The second the woman’s hand touched Warrens jacket, both cameras went out and there were static everywhere. A screech so loud it almost pierced our eardrums came screaming out of the headphones. I threw them of in a pure instinctive move and just sat there, staring at the two monitors showing nothing but black and white lines rushing across the screens.


- “…Warren?”, Ali said softly, you could tell by the sound of her voice that she was clearly holding back tears. “Are you there…? Warren?”
No response. 
“What the fuck just happened!?” Henry said with panic in his voice, “Where the fuck is he?”
Just as fast as the cameras had shut off, the came back on.
“Look!” Jen said, “The stream is back!”


We all got back in position in front of our screens, but Warren was nowhere to be found. The rooms were empty, the woman too, was gone.
-	“Shit shit shit!” I said while fumbling to get my headphones back on. “What the hell just happened!?”
-	“I don’t know”, Ali sobbed quietly. “Where did they go? Who is that woman?!”
-	“We need to do something!” Jen said.
-	“Like what?!” Said Henry, “We’re all hundreds of miles away!”
-	“We need to get the Police back there” Jen said.
-	“They’ll never believe us”, Ali said quietly.
-	“Either way, we need to try!” Jen said. “I’ll call them myself, hold on”.


Jen disappeared from her mic so we couldn’t overhear her conversation. We others just sat there in silence and utter disbelief over what we’d just witnessed. I got up from my desk and walked over to my window. It was like we all were trapped in the twilight zone or some other dimension or something.  I couldn’t comprehend what was going on. 


-	“Ok I’m back”, I heard Jen say.
-	“What did they say”? asked Henry.
-	“I told them I was a neighbour, and that I had heard commotion coming from the house. I told them I had seen the Police there just a couple of hours ago and got worried. They were going to send over a quad car again.”
-	“That’s good thinking,” Henry said. “No way they would have believed the true story…”


Again, we sat and waited, staring at the three camera angles. The minutes felt like hours before we finally saw the Police car once again come up and stop in front of the house. Just like before the two Police officers, I couldn’t tell if they were the same two as last time, went up to the front door and knocked hard, announcing they were from the Police. Just like when Warren knocked, it seemed like the door slowly opened by itself, and the Police walked inside, this time with weapons drawn.


We followed their every step on the stream as they searched the house. The walked straight forward, just as Warren had done, through the hallway in to the kitchen. From there they turned left and slowly cleared the living room. It looked like one of the officers motioned the other to pay attention to something above them. They moved back out into the hallway and presumably upstairs. There weren’t any cameras there, we all sat dead quiet like on needles waiting to catch a glimpse of them again when the silence all of a sudden was broken.


-	“What are we looking for?”


It was Warren!


-	“Warren what the fuck!” Henry let out in a cry. “Where the hell did you go? What happened?!”
-	“What do you mean?” Warren answered. “Nothing happened, there weren’t anyone there, you all saw my video chat?”
-	“That’s not what we saw…” Jen said in a tone that she started to have enough weirdness for one night.
-	“I don’t understand?” Warren continued. “I looked around, I was filming and talking to you the entire time! After checking the hallway and kitchen, I went in to the living room. I looked around, found a weird book about hauntings that I was filming and telling you guys about, and then…”
-	“Yes”, I interrupted. “What happened then?”
-	“I…I must have left I guess”, Warren said.
-	“What do you mean “you guess?”, Henry asked.
-	“I don’t know man, I don’t.. remember exactly, but I must have. I’m home now so what’s all the fuzz about?”
-	“Warren, we had to get the Police back there! That’s what we’re watching right now!” Jen said. “And your story about what went on in there. That’s not at all what we saw!”
-	“I don’t understand, “ Warren said, now also with a worried tone in his voice. Like he was slowly realizing he actually couldn’t remember how he got home.
-	“I got it on video…”, I said quietly. Remembering that I had the external drive connected, recording everything.
Just then we saw the two officers exit the house again on the external camera, getting back into their car and after a few minutes, driving off again.


-	“I need to see that video”, Warren said.


I stopped the recording and located the file, but when I went to open it nothing happened. Just a warning about the file being corrupted. 
-	“God damnit!”, I shouted. “The damn file is corrupted! It won’t play! I’ll see if I can fix it somehow”.


-	“So…” Warren continued in a clearly affected tone, “What *did* you see happen?
Everyone stayed quiet for a while.
-	“Guys?” Warren asked.


-	“It was fucking weird man”, Henry said quietly. “We all saw that woman lying right in front of you in the hallway. We then saw her getting up and come up behind you. She touched you man!”
-	“What! You’re crazy!” Warren said, almost in a laugh. “You’re fucking with me, trying to scare me!...Right?!”
-	“Sorry Warren, but no”, Jen said, still very much affected. “I swear to God, that’s what we all saw! I mean, you saw it yourself before with the cops! They didn’t see her either, they walked right past her, just like you did!”


I managed to open the file in a video editing software and shared my screen with everyone.


-	“Look!” I said, “This is when you enter”
-	“Uhu…”, Warren said quietly. 
-	“You see her?!” I continued. “She’s right there by your feet!”
-	“what the fuck…” Warren exclaimed. Just as the rest of us, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing.
-	“And here, you’re in the living room, she’s coming up right behind you”
-	“What the actual fuck!” Warren was clearly frightened at this point.
-	“And when she placed her hand on your shoulder, the stream died!” I explained. 

Only, the recording didn’t stop there.

The video kept on recording past the point what we had seen live. We all fell silent again, our eyes fixated on the terrifying events playing out right in front of us. After the woman had laid her hand on Warrens shoulder, he immediately fell to the ground, like a house of cards in the wind. The Woman then really slowly turned around and stopped dead in her tracks straight in front of us, with her stare locked on the living room camera. She moved forwards, just as slow as before, closer and closer towards the camera. There was something off about her appearance. Her face was, blurry, hard to focus on. Closer and closer she came, until her pale, blurry, out of focus, almost static-like face covered the entire screen. Then we heard a faint whisper over our headphone.


-	“One down, four to go. You have all been marked”.
