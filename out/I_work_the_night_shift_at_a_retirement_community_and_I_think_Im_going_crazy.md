Working night shift takes a toll on your body and mind. It can increase the risk of cancer, ruin your sleep, slow down the production of certain hormones, and even cause depression and antisocial behaviors. It sucks. It was never really my choice to work the night shift security at an old folks’ home. I worked the day shift for years until they fired nearly half of all the employees on campus, and they gave me the choice: work nights, or turn in my uniforms.

It's not all too bad; it’s an uneventful job most of the time. I’ll get calls from residents ranging from 80 to 100 years old requesting help with opening jars, changing light bulbs, and other things of that nature. After working 8 years here, my empathy begins to run dry. There are only so many times I can take getting calls from a resident asking to plunge their toilet, or, God forbid, help change their Depends.

Don’t get me wrong, there have been times when I earned my pay tenfold. Finding residents who had fallen and split their head open is more common than you think; the amount of blood that these old folks can lose would surprise you. In these situations, I call 911 for the resident and do my best to keep them hanging on. I’ve found dead bodies as well, not as common as the falls. It’s funny, everyone on the security team says they get a strange feeling before finding a body. I never felt it. I was always lucky with bodies. I worked the job for seven and a half years before finding one.

The first body I found had sat for three days. I received a call from a family member asking to check on him; the resident’s name was Willy. He was a nice resident, sometimes driving by the office in his little scooter and waving. Anything beyond that, I couldn’t tell you. I went over to his apartment and rang the doorbell several times. After no answer, I peeked beyond the Venetian blinds he had set up on his window. Within the small crack of the blinds, I saw blood on the floor, so I quickly let myself in with the skeleton key.

The smell was like a wall you could touch, pennies and piss. It took everything not to vomit.  Large dried-up chunky puddles of blood covered the apartment. I followed the smears of blood; weirdly, they looked almost like brush strokes on a painting. This paint trail led me to the brush: Willy, underneath his bed. Police said he crushed the spot between his eyes when he fell face forward into his bathroom sink, blinded. He crawled around his apartment until he passed out from blood loss, and then shortly died after.

It didn’t make sense to me. Why crawl under the bed? I remember reading that some animals try to hide when their time is near; my old family cat did the same thing. I don’t think this was the case with Willy, however. When I bent down to check under the bed, the image was seared into my mind; he was like a child hiding from a monster. Hands curled up to his chest, fingers covering his mouth.

Things haven't felt the same since finding Willy six months ago. I’m more paranoid. I keep thinking of how he looked, hiding. Did he see something? Did something do that to him? I think the old folks feel it too; they seem more edgy, more demanding on calls. Word of a “crime scene” spread around the campus like wildfire. Since then, I have received more calls from residents claiming that trespassers on their porch are breaking in. They have all been false alarms. They’ll swear they heard someone knocking on their door, or even see someone in their apartment, and nothing happens every time I check.

Until recently.

I received a call from a resident, a little old lady, who said that she was in her apartment, under her bed, and someone was tapping on the glass of her window, trying to get inside. Honestly, I got a bit mad. It was another call from a resident who is demented and imagining things. I heard the glass tapping through the phone, and my blood went cold.

 

**\*\*\***

 

It was raining hard that night; it was a surprise that I had even heard the tapping through all the white noise of the rain and general shittiness of old-people phones.  The resident, Gladys, lived on the edge of the campus, and given the cookie-cutter nature of each unit, I knew her bedroom would be facing the street, and whoever was tapping on her window would have their back facing the sidewalk. I could have cut through the units and gotten there quicker, but there were too many blind spots and possible ambush areas, so I took the longer way around.

I turned the corner and got eyes on the area. Gladys’ bedroom light was on, beaming a shaft of yellow onto this would-be intruder. The person was small and hunched, their back toward me, but even then, I barely managed to croak out a “Security” to notify them of my presence. They must not have heard me over the rumbling thunder, because they kept tapping on the window. I got closer, it was times like these that I wished I was permitted to carry a sidearm, I finally managed to blurt out a “Segurtee!” loud enough for them to hear. The person stopped their tapping and, shakily, turned around.

His name was Arthur, “the town drunk,” my boss would call him. The tightness in my chest let go.

“Arthur, what are you doing out here?” I asked sternly.

“Tryin’ to get inside. Keys…” He felt around his nonexistent pockets. It was then I noticed, besides his white tank and old ratty work boots, the man was nude. Thankfully, the dark and rainy weather covered much of the visuals.  Drunk and out to lunch. Perfect combination.

I escorted him back to his unit, which was one door down. At least he was close. He had lost his keys, so I let him in using the skeleton key and made a mental note to write a report. I would like to transfer him to the behavior unit if I could. I called Gladys back and told her it was a confused resident.

“It was that drunk, Arthur, wasn’t it?”

Not everyone was mentally gone, it seems.

On the hurried penguin-shuffle-in-the-rain walk back, I noticed that the campus began to flood. This usually happened during storms. When this happened, I had to check for flooding and mark them in the log. I always checked an extra spot first, though, the cat colony.

It’s not an official spot you could find on the campus map; I’m the only one who calls it that, but it’s a small, rocky, bowl-like area leading to a culvert. The stray cats lounge on the rocks in the sun during the summer. Residents and workers alike leave bowls of water and food around the area, too. Management turns a blind eye, despite their flyers saying not to feed the stray cats. No one knows how the colony started, but it isn’t uncommon that when residents move to hospice, whoever has the power of attorney would abandon them nearby. So over time, the cats began to claim the area as their own.

As I approached the cat colony, the rain began to fall harder. The water was flowing gradually over the rocky bowl and into the culvert, which was a good sign; if the water level began to rise, it meant something was stuck, and possibly the cats would drown. I beamed my phone light down to the entrance of the culvert, and something caught my eye, a glinting piece of metal, Arthur’s keys.

I thought about waiting for the rain to let up before getting the keys, but there was a chance they’d be whisked away into the waterway, never to be seen again, and that meant getting constant calls from “the town drunk” asking for his door to be opened. I decided to make my way down to the mouth of the culvert. I made sure to be careful with my steps; one day, I didn’t wear my work boots, and my luck.

I reached the mouth of the culvert and bent down to grab the keys, then heard yowling of cats inside the waterway, hissing and splashing, I shone my phone down the dark passage. I saw a stampede of waterlogged cats, ears tucked, tails upright, bursting towards me. My heart jumped, and I fell on my ass in the water, soaking me even deeper. The cats scrabbled up the rock bowl in different directions and into the darkness.

It smelled horrible; they all must have sprayed in fear as they fled. I tried to pull myself together and got back up and grabbed Arthur’s keys. The ammonia was gone. A different stench took over. Copper. “Piss and pennies”. Blood. I looked down the dark passageway instinctively. A dead cat was floating in the dark, black water; its once glowing eyes were now a dull, pale yellow. I slowly moved my phone light toward the carcass, illuminating that something had taken a bite from its back. What the fuck did that? Do cats eat each other?

A pale translucent hand snatched the cat into the darkness, deeper into the waterway.

 

**\*\*\***

That smell, it was the same one when I found Willy dead. I always assumed Willy had fallen, but hiding under the bed after falling never made sense to me. Did that \*thing\* that ate the cat hurt Willy? All these thoughts ran through my mind as I ran back to my office.

Once I got there, I locked the door, shut the blinds, and scrubbed through the cameras to see if whatever that was in the waterway had followed me. Thankfully, I didn’t see anything. I spent the rest of the shift in a state of paranoia, constantly peeking out of the windows and watching the cameras, expecting to see some pixelated shambling monster make its way towards my office.

I slowly returned to my routine over the next few days of work. I began to fool myself into maybe thinking what I had seen (and smelled) was my imagination, after all, night shift is hard on the mind. It wasn’t abnormal to scare yourself when you worked alone; shadows had a way of looking like people when you knew you had no one to help you. Despite the mental gymnastics, I decided to bring my gun to work in my car; it was strictly prohibited to carry one on campus, and as a security guard, I wasn’t licensed for it, but having it about 30 feet away from my office gave me a sense of safety.

It was a wonder I went this long without bringing a firearm to work; I’ve had many close calls over the years. In the summer, it was common for drug addicts and general shady people to cut through the campus, and even at times, squat in the empty units. There was a time I went into an empty unit and found a little nest some addict had made, bent spoons, used needles, and bandages had been strewn around the corner of the empty living room. The thing that frightened me the most, in the opposite corner, was a Polar Pop Styrofoam cup filled nearly to the brim with blood. 30 fluid ounces of blood. Was it even humanly possible to survive such blood loss? Was it even the addicts? Life is full of such mysteries.

It was summer, and my boss, hoping to avoid any more Polar Pop incidents, gave me the job to check each empty unit on campus. It was tedious work because, sadly, many units are empty at any given time. Resident turnover with the elderly and infirm is a real thing. My boss had left a master list of empty units on the security desk, and after my rounds, I began combing.

Each unit, I had to knock and announce “Security” before entering. Every so often, the list would be wrong, and I’d accidentally enter an occupied unit, nearly killing some old lady with fright.  The first 10 units were fine, empty, clean, and had no signs of life. The 11^(th) had a faucet running. The next 20 were good. Some empty boxes here and there, cable wires still screwed into the wall, no Polar Pops.

I reached the final unit this side of the campus—Unit 90.  I rang the doorbell thrice and used the skeleton key to open the door. “Security! Unit inspection.” No answer. The unit was dark, so I flipped the switch on the wall. I would have said that people were living here, but they would have had to be ghosts.

The unit was open, and you could see every room from the front door. To your right was the living room, to your left was a small kitchen, and directly ahead was a short hallway, straight to the bedroom and bathroom.

The living room had a solitary recliner, molded perfectly to fit whoever sat in it for at least half a century. The walls were bare, leaving only sun-faded outlines of where pictures used to be. A small, old cathode tube television rested on the carpet in front of the recliner, facing away from me. Playing something silently, projecting its lights onto the empty walls. The kitchen was in disarray, blankets had been stuffed into the open oven, and stacks of newspapers were coming out of the fridge and freezer.

Apprehension gripped me. I stood quietly in the doorway for what seemed like hours, listening for any signs of someone inhabiting the apartment. After enough time, all I could hear was the pulse of my own heart in my ears. I made my walkie chirp and squawk; sometimes the sound would make trespassers flee. Nothing. I quietly entered the unit.

Since I could see the living room and kitchen, I was mainly concerned with the bedroom and bathroom, so I made my way there first. The bedroom was mostly furnished, with a queen-sized bed, a dresser, a shoe rack, and a standing mirror. The bathroom was a different story. It was, to put it lightly, disgusting. Human waste lay in the toilet bowl for who knows how long. The mirror was a dull silver, covered in spatters of spit and hopefully toothpaste, along with red streaks and swirls of blood. Mold grew in the shower; the shower chair that came with every unit was covered with a fuzzy white fungus. I quickly closed the bathroom door, giving myself a barrier to the contagion pit.

I turned around and heard a soft crunch beneath my boots. I lifted my leg to see a small, shattered shard of thin glass. My eyes followed the little trail of twinkles leading under the bed. Peeking from under the bed was a wooden picture frame. I got down on my knees, making sure not to cut myself on the glass, and looked under the bed. At least 20 picture frames had been shoved under the bed. I pulled them out from under the bed and began to sift through them.

I placed them all out facing me; some looked to be from the 80s, shot with real film, and some looked as new to the point of being digital. There were 23 framed photos: each picture was a school photo of a small child.  Some of the kids smiled, with their gapped growing teeth, a couple frowned, but all of them were no older than 10.

I called the nonemergency line for the police. I wasn’t exactly sure what I had stumbled on, but whatever it was made me uneasy. It was difficult explaining exactly why I needed them to come check out the place. “I found some photos of children” made me sound a bit strange. They said they would take about an hour to dispatch some officers, so in the meantime, I decided to take photos on the work phone for my report. Any time police stepped foot on campus, I needed to write a detailed report.

I took a handful of pictures of the framed photos, and shirt-over-nose some of the bathroom. I went into the kitchen and snapped some of the blankets, and then some of the newspapers in the fridge.

Newspapers.

I opened the fridge and let the grey, musty sheets pool to the ground. I grabbed a couple and began to skim through them; some dated back to the 70s. “JIMMY CARTER ELECTED PRESIDENT. BUD DWYER CONVICTED OF FRAUD. GROVE CREEK CONDEMNED. BRONCOS WIN SUPERBOWL.”

An obituary was circled in red marker in each paper, as if circling a classified ad.

**George D. Age 10. Funeral held at Messenger of God Funeral Home.**

**Addison R. Age 9. Vigil at W.A.S.M.**

**Chris O. Age 5. Please join us at our home.**

**Summer P. Age 10. Funeral held at Saint Mary Episcopal Church**

**Arthur K. Age 7. Funeral dates to be released.**

**Charlie R. Age 8. Funeral at Messenger of God Funeral Home.**

**Kyle I. Age 9. Funeral held at Ekta Temple.**

**Judy R. Age 6. No funeral; please donate to the listed charity.**

I had to stop. The fridge was still filled.

**\*\*\***

 

If you’ve ever worked or been around older people long enough, you’d know that they are often more like children than anything. They view everything as “my way or the highway”; they depend on others for support, physically or emotionally, and sometimes even lack general manners and societal norms, like standing outside your house staring at the police silently. Nearly every resident in the area was doing this. Only got worse as more cruisers began to pull in to check out “the scene,” as the officers called it.

They hesitated to call it a crime scene. After all, there was no evidence of a crime, no body, no murder weapons, no perpetrator. The police rummaged through the items, commented about how the guy must have been a creep, took some photos of the unit, and then went their way.

I called my boss, who answered sleepily and briefed him on the situation. He didn’t seem to care all too much and just recommended locking the unit down and putting in a ticket for the cleaning crew. After all that, it felt like I was a fool to notify everyone about the unit I found; it all seemed a bit stupid now. I was sure I’d be the butt of the joke during the day shift for a while. “Did you hear? The night guy nearly shit his pants at newspapers”.

I shut all the lights in the unit off, going from bathroom to bedroom, to kitchen, then the living room last. The old cathode ray television on the floor was the kind that was a TV-and-VHS-in-one. The VHS port had an ejected tape sitting in its mouth. Seeing it made the hairs in the back of my neck stand up. I pushed the tape in with my boot.  

The TV began to play the tape. Old fuzzy static crackled and zapped, and a test card appeared on the TV:

“Keller Ad, Type 2: Localized, 4:3”.

A nuclear family posed on a papier-mâché rock; they all wore Coogi sweaters. A camera off-screen flashed, but the son was picking his nose. The mother rolled her eyes, and a slide whistle played. “Can we take another?”

The narrator chimed in, “Of course! At Keller’s Permanent Smiles, you book by the hour, not by the photo!” Images of the same family flashed, showing them in all sorts of photos with themes ranging from Christmas to Pirates to awkward Prom photos.

“Weddings, Mitzvas, School Picture Day, you name it, we do it! Now available in \[INSERT COUNTY HERE\]”

The tape stopped, the VHS whirred and poked out like a tongue in a mouth.

After that, I returned to my office, debating whether I should call the police again and show them the tape. I doubt they would care or even be able to use it. I tried to look up who the previous tenant was in unit 90, assuming it would be this “Keller”, but the file was empty. This was par for the course; the high turnover of residents meant high churn with data and files. I often opened a resident file to find the wrong ID info, missing info, or corrupted files.

**\*\*\***

About a month had passed since I found Unit 90, and I’d still pass by it on patrols and, despite the entire unit being cleaned out and completely renovated, get this awful feeling of dread. Same for the culvert at the cat colony. I think the cats felt the same way; they all migrated to different areas on the campus.

The campus hosts their “Summer Olympics” for the residents every year during the summer. Nothing too crazy, a “cross country” track, some weightlifting challenges, and a pickleball tournament. It’s something to give the residents to do and lets them be physically active. I’ve never seen it in person, but after it’s all done, they give out medals to the top residents, snap a picture with the CEO, and even let the resident with the most medals stay in the “Olympic village”.

The Olympic village has a nice private garden and a little pond. Throughout the year, it’s used for board members and possible investors. This year, Mildred was the campus medalist, boasting four gold medals. I wouldn’t have known this event even happened if it weren’t for the little winner posters the staff put up for her around campus.  She was smiling in the photo, using a pair of fake teeth to bite the gold medals.

I was walking around campus when my work phone rang. It was about two in the morning, which is never a good sign. In my experience, a late call like this usually meant a fall. I answered the phone, it was none other than Mildred, the medalist.

“Security, is this an emergency?” I asked.

“Oh no, my name is Mildred, and I am here in the executive suite, and I had my doorbell ring… well, not mine, but you understand. Anyway, I answered it, and it’s another resident, he’s lost and needs to find his home.” I could hear shuffling on the other side of the phone.

“What? Oh. He says it’s dark and doesn’t know where he is. Would you be able to help him?”

This would happen often; residents just get lost. It’s a vast campus.

“Yeah, does he remember his unit number?”

Silence.

“90”

“Okay, I’ll be right there.” I hung up the phone. I thought about where I was on campus. My gun was in my car near the office, the complete opposite direction from where Mildred was staying. If I ran to get it, it’s possible that whoever was there could do something before I arrived with my gun. Fuck the gun.

I ran the entire way to the Olympic Village; it probably took 5 minutes. My mind raced. What if this isn’t the guy? What if these were all separate events, no connection to one another? What would I even do when I get there?

I got to the unit and unlocked the door immediately with my key. “Secur-“

The wall. The wall of pennies and piss.

“Keller?” I rasped.

“Yes?” said a voice.

**\*\*\***

In times of extreme stress, I, like many people, get tunnel vision; my eyes fixate on a small item or area. I’m aware of what’s around me, but I can’t remove my eyes from a particular spot. When I rounded the corner from the kitchen to enter the living room, my eyes got stuck on his hands. White, thin, translucent, I could see every vein and tendon in his hands.  

His hands were bloody. Five minutes. Five minutes and he had already had congealed blood stringing off his hands.

“Permanent Smile.” He let out a weak titter.

In the peripheral of my vision, I could see that he turned Mildred into a red mess in her face, just like Willy.  She had let him in, and this is what he did to her.

“Help me put her under the bed. Her mom will be home soon.” There was a tinge of anxiety in his voice. His hands reached for his face, and he began to pick at the skin on his sallow cheeks, tearing off tiny pieces of his translucent skin.

“Picture…picture…pretty in the picture,” He muttered.

He got up from the couch, and his hands grabbed Mildred's ankles.

“Let go of her!” I screamed. He clasped his hands over his ears reactively and turned around, bringing a gnarled, knobby finger to his lips; he shushed me.

“Quiet, you’re going to wake the dad up.” He reached for Mildred again, grabbing her, dragging her off the couch. I lost all those obituaries, the photos, the commercial; this man spent a life well wasted. I grabbed him by the shoulders and threw him to the ground. He landed on his back, letting out a hollow thump. He was light. He began to laugh, wheezing and lungs crackling with phlegm. He sounded different now, the anxiety gone, a moment of clarity.

“Do it, it won’t bring them back. I’ve had my fu- “My boot entered his face and met the floor.

**\*\*\***

Nightshift ruined me. I keep thinking that had I just left the job when they tried to switch me, none of this would have happened. I was fired, rightfully so; I failed to save Mildred. I go to bed thinking about those five minutes, and when I wake up, I usually find myself under the bed.

I remember hearing one of the paramedics at the trial saying that had I called on the way there, they may have been able to get there in time to save her. I’m not sure I believe him, but it’s always on my mind. 

The one good thing out of this situation was that over a dozen cold cases had been solved due to Keller’s death. I still sometimes get letters from the families from time to time here. They thank me for doing what I did, giving them some sense of justice for their children.

I can’t ever sleep at night; I only feel safe enough to sleep during the day—permanent night shift.
