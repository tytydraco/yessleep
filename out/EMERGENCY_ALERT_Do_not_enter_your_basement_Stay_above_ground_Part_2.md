We got to my mom’s house around midnight. A squat, brick ranch on a residential road. I glanced warily at the pines behind her house, stretching up to the sky, before picking up Grace and carrying her inside.

Mom was sitting at the kitchen table, waiting for us. Her fingers rapped against the mug in her hand. The entire house smelled like that familiar mix of coffee and dust.

I started for the stairs—and then got a better idea.

The ranch had a lower level that was half underground. It had been finished into an office, but there was a couch down there. I could have Grace sleep on the couch, and we could sleep on the floor…

“Where are you going?”

Mom was standing behind me, eyebrow raised, as I undid the chain lock to the basement floor.

“I think we’re going to sleep down there.”

“No, you’re not. It’s all dusty down there. I haven’t cleaned for ages. There could even be mice and—”

“We’re sleeping down here.”

“Those alerts were probably just a prank,” she continued. “Or a glitch, or something. Besides, you’re like an hour away, now.”

I’d only told my mom about the alerts. I didn’t tell her about the thing in the woods. My mom was not a supernatural person. She’d definitely chalk it up to a trick of the light or something. Casper himself could be floating in front of her face and she’d call it a trick of the light.

“You’re being ridiculous,” she continued. “You know, this reminds me of that time you taped up the door to the attic. Remember? When the exterminator had found a bat up there? You were worried there were more, with rabies, and they could flatten themselves in through the cracks between the door and the ceiling and bite you while you were sleeping.”

“You don’t feel the bites when you’re sleeping,” I growled back. “A lot of people have gotten rabies from bats in their houses. And they can squeeze through really tiny places—”

“My point *is,”* she interrupted, “it’s unsanitary down there.”

Grace was getting incredibly heavy in my arms. I glanced at Luke, who was just standing in the doorway wide-eyed, like he’d walked in on a gunfight.

Then I pulled the chain lock and yanked the door open.

“Kate,” Mom said warningly.

Halfway down the stairs, my phone buzzed in my pocket.

I got Grace settled on the couch, then pulled it out.

EMERGENCY ALERT

YOUR PHONE’S GPS INDICATES YOU HAVE STOPPED IN \[REDACTED\], NJ. DISOBEYING AN EMERGENCY ALERT IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE. PLEASE RETURN HOME AND STAY ABOVE GROUND.

I lifted my phone to show Luke, who was coming down behind me. His face looked ghastly pale in the white light.

Mom was right behind him, and craned her neck to read the alert, too. “Oh, that’s BS,” she said. “It’s not a federal offense, it’s a state offense. And that would be an evacuation order, like for a hurricane or something.” She shook her head. “You know what this sounds like? One of those scammers. I got a call from someone claiming to be my grandson—”

“It’s not a scam,” Luke interrupted, without elaborating.

Then he worked in silence, putting the blanket over Grace, getting her comfortable. I flicked on the light and checked for mouse droppings, but I didn’t see any. “I’ll get the rest of our stuff,” he said, leaving my mom and I alone.

Her expression softened as she looked down at Grace, at her perfectly cherubic little face. “Do you need anything else?”

“No, I don’t think so.”

She nodded and went back upstairs.

I glanced around. The office stuff was in the leftmost corner, the desk covered with papers and a single photo of my dad. He’d been gone seven years now, and it seemed like every year, more and more of his stuff got tucked away, moved downstairs, shoved into storage. I swallowed down the feeling and glanced around the rest of the room. The door next to the desk led to the unfinished storage area. On the other end of the basement was a sliding glass door that led out into the backyard. I didn’t like that at all. We were technically underground, where we stood, but the rightmost corner with the door was above ground. Did that mean we were still vulnerable?

*Those things couldn’t fit through a glass door,* I thought.

But they couldn’t fit through a normal door, either. And apparently we wouldn’t have been safe in our own home.

I stared out the glass door, afraid I might see one of them out there. Maybe this was a bad idea, to stay here. We were an hour away, sure, but the pines were still right at our door. Not officially the Pine Barrens, but the surrounding pinelands ecosystem, which was almost the same thing. If those things came from the Barrens…

*They were only in the burned areas,* I reminded myself.

I imagined a pinecone, spiraling in midair, petals opening as fire raged around it. And skeletons made of sticks prying their way out of the thing, creeping along the ground, stretching and growing towards the sky.

*Were there any maps of the burned areas?*

I pulled up Google maps, looking for the blackened areas—but the information would be out of date, wouldn’t it?

My phone buzzed.

I expected another alert—but it was a text from Lacie, instead.

**My friend Richele got the same alert you did btw,** it read. **Super weird.**

My heart dropped.

Did Richele, whoever she was, listen to it?

**Tell her not to listen to the alert,** I started typing. **It’s a trap.** Then I realized how unhinged that sounded. I didn’t even know Lacie that well.

I thought for a second, then typed a new message.

**Can you give me her number? I want to ask her about it—pretty weird that it targeted both of us, no one else.**

**Sure, let me ask her,** was the reply.

As I waited, Luke came back down the stairs, carrying our stuff, computer cords and stuffies nearly falling out of his arms. “Someone else got the alert,” I whispered. “One of Lacie’s friends.”

“Really?”

“Yeah. I asked for her number.”

A minute later, the number came in. I dialed it immediately. On the third ring, she picked up. “Hello?”

“Hi, this is uh, Kate, Lacie’s friend,” I started, awkwardly. “We got the emergency alert too, but we think it’s a trap. There’s something off about it.”

A pause.

“But it came from the government,” she replied. “How could it be a trap?”

“It seems like no one else is getting it. When alerts are sent out like that, they’re sent to all the phones in a certain location. It doesn’t make sense.”

“Yeah, I dunno. It’s weird.” Another pause. “Well, we were just about to go to bed here, so I’d better go.”

“Wait—I think the basement is safe, and everywhere else isn’t!” I said, quickly. “I think someone’s trying to lure people into staying above ground—”

“Okay, maybe,” she said, unconvincingly. “Look, I gotta go, sorry.”

A few seconds later, the call ended.

Well, *shit.*

“She didn’t believe me,” I said, looking up at Luke, my lip trembling. “She and her kids and her family—they’re all going to—”

“You tried,” he said, wrapping his arms around me. “That’s the best you can do.”

I couldn’t help it. I cried as we lay a blanket on the floor, got ready to sleep next to Grace. I looked down at her perfect little face, and then Luke and I snuggled under the blankets together.

\*\*\*

*“Hey, kiddo.”*

I woke up with a start.

For a second, I thought I was in my own bed. But then the roughness of the carpet, the aching in my back, brought me back to reality. My father’s voice, rough and warm, lingered from the dream. I could almost feel his arms around me, the summer sunlight beating down on us, as we played at the creek behind the house.

I rolled over to check on Grace—

Her eyes were wide open.

She was staring behind me.

At the sliding glass door.

Slowly, she raised a hand, and pointed over my shoulder.

I turned around.

There was something twisting and turning, contorting itself, trying to get in through the sliding glass door like a dog through a cat door. It did it silently, except for a low clicking sound, like the popping of joints.

All the blood drained from my face.

Dark, sinewy legs, like spider legs, twisting and turning in the moonlight. Squeezing itself, ever so slowly, through the hole it made. I now saw the shattered glass scattering the floor.

I grabbed Luke and shook him. *“Luke—”*

The thing fell still.

I couldn’t see eyes or a face, but I felt it in my gut—it was staring at me.

Dizziness swept over me. I stumbled forward, losing my balance. It was like I was standing on the deck of a boat. The ground seemed to shift and tilt underneath me. I just wanted to lie down, until the world stopped turning…

*NO!* I screamed, internally. *You can’t let that thing get Grace!*

I glanced around the room, looking for something that could be used as a weapon. Anything. *“Go in there,”* I said to Grace, pointing to the storage room, or at least I thought I was. Everything was tilting and moving around me. *“GO! HIDE!”* I stumbled forward, but all the colors were bleeding together now, everything was hazy as a dream—

My father was standing in front of me, standing there in the basement. But his face was all wrong. His eye drooped out of his socket, like something had squeezed his skull. His grin was crooked.

*“Hey, kiddo,”* he said, in a voice that sounded off-key.

Nausea filled me. I started vomiting. Warm liquid down my shirt. Splashing on my feet. My dad, not-dad, stood tilted, like gravity had suddenly changed. One arm was too long and hung limply from its socket.

*“I miss you so much.”*

“Stop,” I sobbed. “Please, stop.”

*“Come with me. We can be a family again.”*

“Stop…”

*“I never got to meet Grace. Wouldn’t it be so wonderful? For me to finally meet her?”*

The world tilted and shifted.

I stared at my father, his left eye drooping like jelly.

His crooked smile, his gaunt face, his limp arms.

I opened my mouth—

Hot pain shot up my shoulder. I fell to my knees, instantly. I tried to cry out, to say *stop* again, to tell Grace to run for her life, but all that came out was a scream of pain. And another. And another.

When I finally opened my eyes, the world had stopped tilting.

Luke was dragging me across the floor, back from the glass door.

Grace was peeking out of the storage area, terrified.

I touched my shoulder, stinging with pain. My fingers came away red.

*It bit me.*

*I’m dying.*

*What…*

My phone began to ring. Shaking all over, I reached into my pocket and pulled it out.

It recognized the number—it was Richele. “You’re right,” she said breathlessly. No preamble.

“What?” I asked, my voice hoarse.

“About the alert. My husband… he has some friends who work with the cell phones and stuff… and he…” She took a deep breath, trying to steady her voice. “They traced the signal. It’s not coming from the government or the town hall or whatever.”

I chewed my lip, held my breath.

“It’s coming from the middle of the woods.”
