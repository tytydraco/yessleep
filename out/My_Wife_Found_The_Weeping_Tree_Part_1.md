Has anybody here heard of something called “The Weeping Tree?” My wife recently found… whatever it is, and has since become obsessed with it. I can’t seem to find any information about it. I honestly have no idea what she even found, but I’m really beginning to worry about her. Ever since she started speaking again, it feels like it's all she’ll talk about. I really don’t know where else to turn to. 

For context, she found it somewhere deep out in the woods near Durnwick township in eastern US. I’ve gone searching a few miles past the tree line but I’ve never found anything like she’s described. She makes it sound like it would be hard to miss. 

I’ve asked local residents but no one seems to know anything about The Weeping Tree here, either. Granted, there aren’t that many people here to ask. Durnwick is a sleepy little spot, tucked away in a sea of birch and cedar. It’s just a loose smattering of old homes and small shops spread out across miles and miles of backroads that cut through what must be some of the thickest foliage in the state. GPS barely ever works out here, and it has little to offer when it does. Sal’s Hardware is the only spot that actually shows up, and it looks like it’s been closed for years. 

I know I’m not giving Durnwick any credit, but honestly, we were excited to move in at first. Heather and I had both grown up in the city and always dreamed of moving to the great outdoors. City life never really suited us. It had its perks, sure, but there’s only so much concrete one person can take before they start to feel homesick for something they’ve never really had. Fresh air.  We would’ve traded our studio apartment for thickets and backroads in an instant. And so when the opportunity for a well paying work from home position came knocking, we started shopping around for a place far, far away from city. A few months later, we found our new home out here in the pines. We couldn’t have been happier. 

Moving in proved to be easy enough, as we didn’t have much to take with us in the first place. Good thing too, our new house out here is pretty cozy. It’s perfect for us though; we’ve never been the material type. It even has a small shed out back, just big enough for Heather to use as a studio for her art. We spent our first weekend out here getting power hooked up in there, made it into the perfect little nook for her to relax and unwind while she paints. She’s out there right now, actually, while I’m typing this. But Heather doesn’t paint anymore. 

She found it last week, whatever it is. It was late in the evening when I got the call from the local Sheriff. Heather’s car had been found by the side of the road a few miles out of town. She had gone out earlier that day to run some errands, just a quick trip for a few groceries we had forgotten. It shouldn’t have taken more than an hour or two. I remember the hollow feeling that came over me when she hadn’t answered her phone as the sun began to set. It's funny how our intuition seems to know something’s wrong before the rest of us catches up.

I met Officer Miles out on the old winding road next to her car, turned over in a ditch with the windshield splintered and caved in. Rain poured off the side of the asphalt and into the shallow ditch, concealing the driver’s side door in an early, muddy grave. The passenger’s side window had been broken. Wet glass covered the ground, reflecting light like a million little stars. If Heather had seen it, she might’ve even thought it was beautiful. But she wasn’t there.

“Where…” My voice snagged in my throat, “Where is she? Has she already been moved? Where’s the nearest hospital?”

“Mr. Mayhew,” Officer Miles called out through the rain, his clothes soaked through, “Why don’t we talk in my car? I’ve got the heat on.” He ushered me in, the roar of the rain subsiding to a thousand tiny drums echoing off the hood. Miles removed his thin rimmed glasses, setting them on the dashboard. He ran his fingers through his greying hair and searched for the right words in the rear view mirror.

“Mr. Mayhew, first thing I did when I seen Miss Heather’s car was give you a call.” The call had been brief. He told me where he had found the car, and I didn’t stick around for the rest. I was pulling out of the driveway before I even had the chance to think to ask if she was okay.

“When I walked over to check on her, assess the situation… Mr. Mayhew, she wasn’t in the car. Nobody was.”

“So where was she when you found her?” 

“We ain’t found her yet.” 

I felt numb. I suppose Officer Miles had continued talking but I wasn’t hearing whatever was being said. Instead, my eyes found themselves wandering over to the passenger’s side mirror, to the rain-soaked reflection of Heather’s car. Through the shimmering beam of the squad car’s tail lights, I could just make out the bent scrap of my wife’s licence plate, hanging on for dear life off the front bumper. Beside it, the tall grass bobbed up and down, yielding to the ever pouring storm. A few feet away, some of the grass had been flattened, leading a path down past the stalwart treeline.

“Mr. Mayhew?” A firm hand on my shoulder returned my senses to me. “Do you understand?”

“What?”

“I said, I’ve put out a call for a search party. People should be showin’ up real soon. You’re more than welcomed to join, but I’d understand if you need a minute to breathe. I’d be more than happy to stay with you here in the car, or we can go back to the station-”

“You think she’s out there?” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “Why the hell would she be out there? If anything she would stick to the road, wait for someone to drive by.” Heather would never go alone into the woods at night, let alone in the rain. And especially not if she was hurt. It made no sense. “No, she’s not stupid. She’s not out there.”

Officer Miles nodded, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel. 

“I understand, Mr. Mayhew.” He spoke with the tone of a parent dealing with a pouting child. “Still, it won't hurt us to be safe. We’ll get some folk out here and start combing the trees. I’ve got a tow truck on its way. Should be here in the hour. Until then,” He turned to me, keeping one hand on the wheel, “What do you want to do?”

He might’ve well asked me how to solve world hunger. It was pitch black outside, and even darker beyond the trees. Any moonlight that may have filtered in through the leaves and branches was being suffocated by the rain. Any search party out tonight would be more likely to end with a second missing person than actually find one. Still, Officer Miles was right. Wherever Heather was right now, she was probably badly hurt and needed help. If I had to trudge through those drenched, black woods for just the slimmest chance of bringing her home, then that's what was happening.

“I’m going to find her.” 

I stepped out of the car and made my way towards the ditch, my heart threatening to rip itself out of my chest. I had been right; something had moved through the grass, leaving behind a trail that led from the road straight through the trees. I walked closer to it, stepping into the grass myself. It bent under my feet, the slick carpet of foliage nearly causing me to slide into the muddy stream Heather’s car now seemed so comfortable in. Straightening myself up, I looked down at where I had walked. My scant footprints were barely noticeable. If Heather had made this path, then it wasn't from her walking.

“There’s a path here,” I called back to the officer. He had taken a spare flashlight and jacket from his trunk and offered them to me as he shone his light at the overturned car. Up close, I could see that what little of the driver’s side bumper that wasn’t buried in runny mud had been caved in. Blood pooled inside of the spiderweb cracks running through the plastic. Tufts of ruddy fur stuck out from between the jagged metal and plexiglass.

“Might’ve hit a deer,” Officer Miles’ voice challenged the rain. “Probably a buck, by the looks of things. Big bastard, too.”

“Then where is it?” I looked around for any sight of a deer, living or otherwise. As far as I could tell, Officer Miles and I were the only living things around aside from the woods themselves. “I don’t see any dead deer around. No way something just gets up and walks off from this.”

Then where was Heather?

“You spend a lot of time out here in the country, Mr. Mayhew?”

“It’s Colin.”

“You spend a lot of time in the country, Colin?”

“No.”

“You’d be surprised what a deer’ll walk off from.”

Soon after, the search party started coming together. A small line of cars dotted the side of the narrow road. About eleven people in total, myself and Officer Miles included. He gave the group a brief instruction on the situation, how far to go out and what to do if anyone found her. It seemed as if he’d done this before. As people started fanning out, I decided to stay with the path leading out of the ditch. Something had moved from the car into the woods, that much was obvious. Or maybe the other way around. Either way, it was the only potential sign of Heather I had to work with. And that was good enough for me. 

A few minutes into the search I became thankful for Officer Miles’ jacket. The night air was cold, and the rain soaked that cold into everything it touched. About a hundred feet past the tree line the woods became more sparse, leaving open pockets here and there, clearings where I could take inventory of my surroundings. Everything was shiny and slick with rain water. The grass, the leaves, the gnarled bark of the trees, all of it had been polished to a shine by the storm. The foliage overhead broke up the downpour above, converting the torrential rains into fat, lazy drops falling from leaf to ragged leaf. 

Outside of the struggling beam of my borrowed flashlight, I could make out the lights of the rest of the search party through the unending branches. The occasional call of “Hello?” or “Heather?” rang out from all directions. The adrenaline had begun to work its way out of my body, and fear filled its growing vacancy. A few hours ago, my biggest worry was about the best way to fix our creaky bed frame. Everything had happened so fast. Like I was skipping ahead on fast forward through every action. And now that I was out here, scouring the cold darkness for any hint of my wife, I felt each and every second pass through me like a dull knife cutting through gristle. 

Anxiety started setting in, deep in the bottom of my lungs. It hurt to breathe. Dread sat in my stomach like a lead weight, growing heavier by the minute. I felt like I was sinking. 

I’m not sure how long I was out there when I found the clothes. It must’ve been at least an hour, seeing as I had made it about a mile and a half from the road. I found an entire outfit stored away in the hollow of a tree; jacket, shirt, jeans, a pair of boxers and socks, as well as a pair of well loved hiking boots. They hadn’t just been shoved in there, either. Everything was neatly folded and tucked safely away in a little pile, safe from the wind and rain. There was even a pair of black rimmed glasses and a little silver chain necklace coiled on top. They hadn’t been discarded or forgotten. Someone had placed them there with care. With purpose. 

Odd as it was, I didn’t think much of it at the time. I was preoccupied with more important matters. But now, I keep thinking back to that little stash out in the woods. Had someone gone camping and stored an extra outfit out there for… whatever reason? Were they trying to hide the clothes from someone? It doesn’t make any sense. I recently went back there to take another look, but they're gone. Between three weeks ago and now, someone has gone out there and moved them. Or at least, I think so. As much as I want to say I found that same tree, I really can’t be sure. There must be millions of trees making up these woods. The odds of me finding the exact same one again aren’t very high. But I swear, I’m almost *certain* I found that very tree. And the hole in the trunk was empty. 

The rest of the search turned up nothing. By three in the morning, everyone had stumbled back out of the forest and reported to Officer Miles before returning to the warmth of their cars and turning down the winding road, out of sight. I hadn’t expected to find her out there that night. Heather always teased about me needing to be right all the time, but I never would’ve been happier to have been wrong. 

Officer Miles had let me keep the jacket. He told me I could return it when it had time to dry out. Strangely enough, he didn’t seem all that worried about my wife’s disappearance. Only a few people that night did, aside from myself. I remember when I asked him about it, he had said, “People have gone missing in these woods before, and they’ve always come back to us. Ain’t got no reason to think this’ll be any different. She’ll turn up, just you wait.” I think it was supposed to be reassuring. It didn’t work. 

I agreed to meet him at the police station the following morning, hoping to continue the search in the daylight. I declined his offer to escort me back home. Utter disbelief. This wasn’t happening. These things happened in newspapers, not in real life. I climbed into my car and shut the door, my mind failing to put together a coherent thought. Instead I got fragments, little pieces that came and went like buzzing flies. *She’s gone. Dead. Waiting at home. A bad dream. She’s hurt. The clothes. A nightmare. Glass in the street. Path in the grass. The bloody bumper.*

I was a mile down the road before I even noticed I had started driving. I snapped to attention as I ran over a pothole, my car protesting at the surprise. I turned a sharp corner a mile later and right there, far down on the left side of a long, straight road, I saw something. Something bright white standing out in the pitch black dark. I slowed the car to a crawl. It stayed still, growing clearer as I eased closer. There, about two hundred feet in front of me, someone stood on the side of the road. 

It wasn’t just someone. It was Heather. 

I could see her out there in the dark, her bare skin reflecting my headlights like a mirror. Her hair clung to her face in thick strands. She was pale as a porcelain doll and looked just as fragile. Heather had always been on the smaller side, but not like this. Her touch was always soft. Here she was all collarbones and boney elbows. Like someone had bleached her skin and stretched it over a frame of snapped twigs. 

But perhaps strangest of all, there wasn’t a single scratch on her. Not the smallest bruise or scrape. I had seen the crash up close, the condition her car was in. It wasn’t just flipped in a ditch, it was mangled. Any escape after that crash would’ve been just as violent as the crash itself. And yet, there she stood, slack jawed and staring ahead like nothing had happened. She looked starved and half drowned out there in the rain, but there was no sign of the crash anywhere on her. 

I choked back tears as I pulled the car up to her and looked in disbelief. Yes, it was her. Not a doubt in my mind. Heather was here. She was alive. I opened the door and beckoned to her like a stray cat. 

“Heather… Honey, are you okay? It’s me… I’m here, I’m right here…”

Her head lazily bobbed towards me at the sound of my voice. I watched her hazy eyes come into focus. Her lips curled up into a smile. 

“Coli-“

My name caught in her throat like wet gravel. She started coughing, sputtering as her legs buckled under her like a newborn calf. Heather collapsed. She hit the ground with a sickening thud. 

“Heather! Oh my god, Heather! I’m here, you’re okay, everything’s going to be okay…” I dropped to my knees beside her, unsure of how I could even help her in her current state. She stopped coughing after a few seconds and laid still out there on the wet asphalt. I helped her sit up and wrapped Officer Miles’ jacket around her gaunt shoulders. Her breathing steadied, but she didn’t say a word. Instead she looked up at me and smiled. A gentle, warm smile. The one that told me she loved me. 

I slowly helped Heather into the car and immediately called Officer Miles. He had given me his personal number before leaving earlier that night. I suppose Durnwick is small enough that everyone has his number written down somewhere. Hell, come to think of it, I’ve only ever seen one other officer driving around since we moved. This was probably the most action Miles had seen in a while. 

I met him at the nearest mile marker, driving slow so as not to bump Heather around in her seat. When I told Officer Miles about how I found Heather, he told me he would be bringing a doctor and to try not to move her as much as possible. If it turned out that she was injured, any wrong movement could make things worse. So we sat out there at mile marker eight, and we waited. 

Heather didn’t try to talk, but she did make noises occasionally. It started out as little grunts, then short hums. Lip smacks. Sharp “tck” sounds. I took her hands in mine to try and help her warm up. She studied my hand like a map, feeling every bump and scar I’ve picked up over the years. She looked fascinated by them. 

“Heather… what happened to you? How did you get out of the car?” I knew she couldn’t speak, but the question had been echoing in my head for half an hour. 

“I-“ 

Another coughing fit. I held her as her shoulders heaved, her frame racked from the exertion. After a few seconds, she hacked up a fistful of a slimy, pale brown substance that clung to the dashboard. The smell of it hung in the stale air of the car. It smelled like freshly turned soil. 

 “I…crashed…”

Two sets of headlights broke through the rain before I could question her any further. One belonged to Officer Miles, the other to Dr. Bowers, a retired physician who had been living here in Durnwick for over twenty years. The nearest emergency room is over an hour and a half drive away, and the closest hospital is even further. Officer Miles had told me earlier that if anyone in Durnwick ever needed medical attention, Dr. Bowers was our best bet. 

I sat in the squad car for the second time that night as Dr. Bowers examined Heather. Officer Miles was surprisingly calm, looking more tired than concerned. He stifled a yawn and lit a cigarette. 

“Told you she’d turn up, didn’t I? I know you’re still worried, but you can relax now. Bowers will give her a once over and as long as he don’t find nothin’ wrong, the two of you’ll be home within the hour. You said it yourself, not a scratch on her. I’m sure she’s a bit shaken up, but she’ll be okay.”

“I don’t understand how she could possibly be okay. It makes no goddamn sense. You saw her car; there’s no way she could’ve gotten out without being seriously hurt. Something else must’ve happened.”

Officer Miles blew a slow stream of smoke out the window. “Lord works in mysterious ways, Colin. In my experience, when you’re given a miracle, best to just give thanks and move on. Ain’t no point in questioning it. She’s okay, and that’s what’s important, ain’t it?”

Dr. Bowers walked over and knocked on the window. He sat down in the back seat and shivered, pulling his coat tight.

“Well, physically there’s nothing wrong with her. She’s in good health. But she’s suffered from mild shock; whatever happened to her out in the woods tonight has her pretty shaken up. Her motor skills are stunted, she’s having difficulty with speech, and her memory is spotty in places. She doesn’t remember anything that happened after the crash.”

I turned in my seat to face him. “So what do we do now? Do we need to take her to a hospital? Some kind of professional? A therapist?”

He shook his head. “Mr. Mayhew, right now Heather needs time to mentally recover from tonight. She needs rest. More importantly, she will need your help in the upcoming weeks. Talk to her. Help her get some physical exercise. I would expect her to make a full recovery within a few weeks. But it’ll be hard on her. She’ll need you there for support.”

“No offense, doctor, but I still think she should get to a hospital. Somewhere where they have the tools for a proper examination. It’s better to be safe, right?”

Dr. Bowers’ face hardened. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. Heather’s crash likely left her with deep-set mental trauma. Given the manner of the accident, I fear an extended period of time in a vehicle could trigger a response to said trauma. I would advise slowly driving her home, then keeping her out of the car until she shows signs of recovery. At which point, I can perform another examination and we can approach this subject again.”

Officer Miles nodded in agreement, then flicked his cigarette out the window. “Listen to the doctor, Colin. Drive Heather on home and make sure she gets some rest. And get some yourself, too. Tonight’s been hell on the both of you.”

He was right about that, at least. It was going on five in the morning and the night had finally caught up with me. I looked over to my car and saw Heather asleep, pressed up against the passenger window. If I was tired, she must’ve been exhausted. 

I left the squad car and sat down next to her quietly, not wanting to disturb her. Officer Miles escorted us back home, driving off with a customary “call if there’s any more trouble.” I picked Heather up, dressed her in dry clothes and moved her to the bed. She felt so small in my arms, so frail. I pulled her to my chest, holding her tight as if she’d go missing again if I let go. 

Dr. Bowers was right. With some help, Heather started improving surprisingly quickly. Within a few days, she could talk again. A week later she could walk with the help of a cane. By the end of the second week, things were almost back to normal. She had even put back on a little weight. Heather had nearly returned to her usual self, aside from the loss of dexterity in her hands. She had given up on painting and only went out to the studio to admire her previous works. I’ve tried convincing her to painting something new, but the tremors in her hands discourage her every time. It’s hard seeing her like that. 

And now, onto why I’m making this post. Last week, some of Heather’s memory came back. She says that sometime after the crash, she remembers seeing something she calls “The Weeping Tree.” I don’t know why she refers to it as that. When I asked her, all she said was “That’s just what it’s called. It feels right.”

She describes it as this towering, drooping willow tree somewhere out in the forest. Tallest she’s ever seen. It’s the only thing she remembers from her time out in the woods and ever since remembering, she’s become obsessed with it. It’s all she wants to talk about. In the morning, she talks about dreaming of the tree. When we go out for a walk, she compares the trees around to The Weeping Tree. She asks when we’ll get to go out and find it again. She actually wants to go back there. 

I talked to Dr. Bowers about it and he doesn’t seem concerned at all. He says she’s latching onto it because it’s the first bit of her memory that’s returned to her and she’s afraid of losing it again. According to him, the obsession with that memory should fade as the rest of her memory returns. But I’m not sure. This whole thing feels off. Heather had at least been acting like herself after the crash, but whenever she’s going on about The Weeping Tree, it doesn’t feel like her. 

Yesterday she actually made up a song about that damn tree and sang it all day long like a schoolgirl singing nursery rhymes. She’s been a bit of a goofball in the past, sure, but she’s never been so… childish. Now I can’t get the song out of my head. 

*Come with me,*
*Run with me,*
*Follow me way out there;*
*We’ll laugh with glee*
*At The Weeping Tree,*
*And everything we’ll share*

I’ve asked around town and no one’s heard of it. I’m starting to wonder if she’s becoming delusional, if it’s something she’s made up as a way to cope with what happened. If so, I hope there’s a way we can move past this. I want to take her to get professional help, but Dr. Bowers still thinks Heather isn’t fit for long car rides. 

So here I am making a Hail Mary post, hoping someone has heard of The Weeping Tree. If so, please let me know what it is or where I can find more info on it. I’m worried about Heather and… I’m at a loss here. I just want my wife back.

Thanks.
