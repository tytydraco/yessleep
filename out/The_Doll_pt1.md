It was supposed to be my weekend off to relax, but instead I find this mysterious box at my doorstep .

I took it inside to see what was in it and that’s when I noticed the god awful smell coming from the box. It smelt like there was a rotting skunk in there.

So I decided to take it back outside and open it on the porch. Inside was a clown doll with a note taped to its forehead it said:

>*“I AM PRIDDYGUM DONT TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES. I AM SHY. MY BODY IS FETID. I HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW OFF LET ME GET DIRTY. DO NOT CLEAN.”*

I scoffed and tossed the note into the trash. The doll, or Priddygum I guess I should say, wasn't in that bad of condition, it just smelt like complete ass. I couldn't take this doll into my house like this. I took it out back, grabbed some dish soap from inside, turned the hose on, and started cleaning it as best as I could.

Even with all the washing and scrubbing I couldn't get the smell out of the doll. I decided that there was no amount of cleaning that could get rid of the smell, tossed it in the trash, and forgot all about it.

The next morning I was woken up by a putrid smell coming from my kitchen. I immediately recognized the smell. It was the same as the doll that I'd found yesterday. 

I rolled out of bed, still half asleep, going down the hallway and into the kitchen. I turned the corner and finally saw it. Sure as hell it was Priddygum sitting on my counter with another note attached to it.

>"That was the wrong move Jack. You shouldn't have tossed me out yesterday. Actions have consequences and now it's time to pay the price. I hope you don't mind if I stay for awhile you have a really nice house."

I dropped the note terrified as to what it meant by making a mess in my house. Did it mean that it was going to destroy things around my house? 

As I stood there in the kitchen trying to think of other ways to get rid of it for good, before anything bad could happen, the smell suddenly stopped. 

I let out a sigh of relief now that I could finally breath some fresh air. 

I marched outside with Priddygum in my left hand. Threw him into my fire pit, tossed in a couple pieces of fire starter, and lit his on fire. 

"I'd like to see you come back from that!"

After watching him burn for a few minutes I  went back inside to get some breakfast ready. I went back upstairs to my room to change and check my phone. As I walked into the living room the ceiling fan fell on top of me and knocked me out.

I don't know where I'm at, what happened, or how I got to this place, it kinda looks like a warehouse by what I've seen so far, but I need to get this story out. 

If you ever come across a mysterious doll in the mail. 

WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T GET RID OF IT. 

DO NOT GET RID OF IT 

I will try and update as soon as possible after I find a way out of this place and back home.
