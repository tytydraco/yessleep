Screaming erupted from all around me as my friends scattered like cockroaches. Isabella, who had been standing next to Ryan, had drops of blood sprayed all over her body. A tentacle whipped over my head, crashing directly into Mr. Grin and the ground below him. The force shook the earth, reverberating like the aftershocks of an earthquake and almost causing me to trip and fall. I stumbled and had started to go down when a strong hand grabbed me by my upper arm and kept me on my feet. I looked over and saw China Cat, his face a mask of crushing sadness and mortal terror.  
  
Splinters of wood and bone went flying in all directions as Mr. Grin’s skeletal body cracked into a thousand pieces. His skull separated from his body, his mouth flapping open and closed as an excited shriek came from his mouth. His head rolled to a stop a few feet in front of me. Looking up at me, he began to plead, his black eyes rolling furiously in their sockets, spinning like a top.  
  
“Take me with you!” he said. Without thinking, I stooped down and scooped up the head, rolling it into my arms. I saw China Cat and Isabella sprinting only a few feet in front of me, heading towards a nearby stone tower surrounded by dozens of rows of long, wooden barracks. I saw small windows spiraling up the outside of it, like the murder holes in a medieval fort.  
  
I felt the air whooshing behind me as the massive reptilian creature floated above the town, its gigantic wings sending clouds of dust high above the ground. Its tentacles all seemed to move independently, like a den of snakes slithering over one another. Next to me, a thick green tentacle crashed into the barracks, caving in the roof and sending shards of glass scattering in all directions, shards that reflected the red glow of the sky like tiny red stars.  
  
China Cat reached the door of the stone tower first as another tentacle crashed into the earth a few feet to my left. The ground shook and a deep, vibrating thud rose through my bones. A smell like old leather and drying mushrooms rose from the creature’s body, not overpowering or disgusting but certainly alien and unique.   
  
As Isabella and I caught up with China Cat, he flung open the heavy metal door. The metal shrieked in protest as the rusty steel slowly rolled open on ancient hinges. He quickly disappeared into the darkness beyond the threshold as Isabella and I ran in behind him.  
  
I instantly felt the cool air of the tower overtake me as I ran onto the stone steps. I noticed they went both up and down, spiraling in both directions. Yet we were on the ground floor, so that must mean they connected to some sort of basement or tunnel system.  
  
“Go down!” Mr. Grin screamed as the tower shook, pieces of rock falling down from the ceiling. I glanced out one of the murder holes on the ground floor of the tower and saw a tentacle rushing towards me, swinging sideways in a blur. Like a massive battering ram, it hit the side of the tower. I felt something in its foundation give way as the stone began to tilt and groan overhead. We ran down the steps, quickly finding ourselves in total darkness as sounds of destruction continued incessantly above, sometimes shaking the ground. I heard the stairway collapse above us as a cloud of debris came rushing down the chamber.  
  
It overtook us like the dust clouds of a sandstorm, destroying any hope of returning back up the way we had come. The natural red glow went out as the tower collapsed. Coughing and choking, we stood in darkness. Everything above had gone deathly silent now, an eerie shift from the cacophony of shattering stones and falling rubble that had preceded it..  
  
“Oh God,” Isabella said, “what was that?” Her voice echoed in the blackness. I reached in my pocket and took out my phone, turning on the flashlight app. China Cat and Isabella blinked fast as their eyes adjusted.  
  
“It killed Ryan,” I said bitterly, a wave of emotion overtaking me. “It killed my friend.” Mr. Grin’s eyes spun in their sockets as I held him in my hands. China Cat came over and put a hand on my shoulder, and I could see my own depression and loss reflected in his face. Even now, a day later, I haven’t fully accepted that he is dead.   
  
After a few moments, we started to walk forwards, descending further into the tunnel. I saw torches lining the sides of the wall, their small flames sputtering in the dusty air. I turned off my flashlight, deciding to save the battery. We seemed to have descended dozens of stories, but the stairs kept going. I smelled something like limestone and cool streams, with other, fouler scents mixed in. I thought I smelled burning meat and rotting carcasses, but it was very faint.  
  
“That was one of the Ancient Ones,” Mr. Grin said. “There’s a few others.”  
  
“Do they all look like that?” China Cat asked.  
  
“No, no, not at all,” Mr. Grin said cheerily, seeming not at all saddened by the loss of his body. He actually seemed far more excited and up-beat than at any time since we first met him. Perhaps he was just happy to be down off that cross for the first time in- well, who knows?  
  
“Have you seen the other ones?” Isabella asked. Mr. Grin nodded in my hands, his hard, bony skull bobbing up and down rapidly, apparently enjoying the topic of conversation.  
  
“Oh, yes!” Mr. Grin said. “The one we just met was Koras the Destroyer. He has the most followers and the most power here in Scarville. The others tend to leave him alone, mostly because they’re scared shitless of him. His Priests control most of the surrounding area with an iron fist. Anyone not in the hierarchy gets hunted or sacrificed to Koras. They have nearly all the food around here, you see, and they use it like a weapon, allowing anyone they consider beneath them to starve to death.” China Cat nodded, his face yet again placid, as if he were dealing with some abstract philosophical matter.  
  
“And what do the other ones look like?” Isabella whispered, her eyes gleaming with excitement. She seemed to be extremely interested in the topic. Mr. Grin took notice, delivering a theatrical response in his gravelly, deep voice.  
  
“The other ones!” he said. “The other ones! They look like Hell itself, my lady. There is Cristonmach the Bloody. Much smaller than Koras, only twenty-feet-tall, but he’s been here a long time as well. His followers drain the blood of anyone they capture so he can bathe in it and drink it. Cristonmach looks much more human than Koras, except he’s all twisted. His skin is bloodless and white and his fingernails look like claws. His fingers, arms and legs are very long and crooked, and his eyes are silver and glowing. Most people avoid Kristonmach and his priests like the plague.  
  
“Well, besides those two, there’s the Wandering King. I saw him and his procession pass by only once. He looks demonic, his skin blazing-red. He stands forty-feet-tall and has a staff made of blazing fire. He has four arms, long and skeletal, the red skin stretched tight across the bone, and his face looks like melting wax. It constantly changes as you stare at it, the eyes stretching out and shrinking, the skin dripping away then reforming. It’s actually a little gross, even to me.”  
  
“But what are these things?” I asked. Mr. Grin’s smile seemed to falter, even though he was a skull and couldn’t possibly have smiled. He also couldn’t have nodded his head, though, and I had seen him do that. And where did his voice even come from? The head wasn’t attached to anything. Putting these issues aside, I decided to focus on the greatest threat, the Ancient Ones. Mr. Grin had turned out to be a wealth of information. I felt relieved we had him in our group.  
  
“They’re the ones who first came to Scarville,” he said. “I don’t know how long ago. Thousands of years, yes, maybe tens of thousands. People come wandering in here from all over the place. They mostly come and die, but a few survive and continue. And yet the Ancient Ones are constant, the true power in the land, and their followers reap the rewards.”   
  
As he stopped talking, I realized I heard something. A soft pattering came near, like muted footsteps.   
  
At that moment, I realized we had finally reached the bottom of the stairs, and now a curving limestone tunnel stood in front of us. Everything looked wet. Small rivulets of water dribbled their way down the walls and drops fell from the ceiling.  
  
A little girl came around the corner. Grime and dirt covered every inch of her skin, and she wore layers of tattered clothes. Her hair, blonde in some spots, was so filthy it had turned black or brown in most others. She smelled like sickness and sweat, and as she opened her mouth to speak, she gave a little cough that turned into a long, choking one, bending over and trying to get her wind back.  
  
“Who are you?” she said with a strange, drawling accent as she straightened back up. “Why did you come down here?”  
  
“We don’t have to answer your questions!” Mr. Grin said, his chattering mouth exploding in an angry explosion of noise. He turned to me, his voice turning low and conspiratorial, as if he were a prisoner talking of escape. “Don’t trust anyone in this place. These people are refugees from above. I’ve heard people talk about the tunnels down here. They call it ‘Cannibals’ Row’.” The girl looked us up and down for a few long moments, then turned around and ran back the way she came.   
  
“That was bizarre,” Isabella said. We began to walk forwards around the bend in the stone. Rooms branched off the sides at random points, their small doorways and tight dimensions hewn out of the rock itself. I had to kneel to inspect the first room.  
  
From the flickering torch light of the hall, I could see a skeletal corpse in the corner, its legs and arms totally gone. Its torso, head and hips were still clothed in a gray uniform. The uniform looked ratty and threadbare with numerous holes. I walked closer, squinting, feeling I had seen this uniform before.  
  
The medals and swastika pin proved this was a Wehrmacht soldier from the time of Nazi Germany. I saw an eagle with its wings extended holding a sword.  
  
“Holy shit!” Isabella said behind me. “That is so cool! How did he get here?” I shrugged, looking down at Mr. Grin. Mr. Grin seemed pleased by all the attention, and he responded quickly with the enthusiasm of a game show host.  
  
“Bridges pop up here and doorways there,  
  
New blood arrives and is quickly spilled.  
  
Since ancient times, all the endless fear  
  
Echoes here- when they’re wounded or killed.”  
  
“So you’re saying that, if we looked hard enough, we might find evidence of soldiers from ancient Rome and ancient Egypt here?” I asked. Mr. Grin’s skull turned to face me.  
  
“Oh yes,” he said, “and long before that.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
We walked ahead for another ten minutes, around curving turns and past branching tunnels that seemed to lead farther down into the earth. Mr. Grin said he had never been down here and didn’t know the way. The only thing he did know was that Cannibals’ Row apparently existed down here. From what he described, it was like a combination of a slum and the 9th Circle of Hell.  
  
A few minutes later, we came on it. We saw trash everywhere, littering the stone floor of the tunnel. Everything from bones to used cloth diapers to scraps of bloody bandages had been dumped here, and people walked over it. Dozens of them streamed in all directions, men, women and children wearing rags and covered in dirt and grime. They stayed in small groups and gave the others distrustful glares.  
  
One woman, filthy and missing an eye, gripped some food to her chest. She gave us a suspicious glance and a wide berth, moving to the other side of the hallway. I looked over as she passed and saw what she held tight to her tattered shirt.  
  
A baby lay there, dead and naked. It had been roasted, its skin turned dark and cracked from the heat of the fire, its tiny eyes closed and mouth hanging open, as if still trying to cry in death. More people followed further down the hall, holding other strange parcels of mysterious meats to their bodies, like shoppers from the crowds of Hell.  
  
I looked into the rooms carved out of the stone on both sides, seeing disgusting, bug-ridden beds. Rats and snakes slithered over the floor, and in one room, I saw men and women missing limbs laying on blood-soaked sheets covering the floor. The smell of infection and human waste emanated from the room like a cloud, thick and pungent, and some of them cried constantly while others just stared up at the ceiling with dead, blank eyes.  
  
As we went around another turn, looking for a way out of this nightmarish place, my worst fear became realized. Isabella was in the lead, with China Cat and I walking a few feet behind her. This would turn out to be a mistake.  
  
I saw a blur as a filthy, bearded man with a paint mask over his mouth jumped out of a dark room on our right, hidden by the curve of the wall. As he breathed, the crumpled mask sucked in and out, the dirt and blood covering it making its original color unrecognizable. He had on a white biohazard suit that had yellowed with age, covered in dark black and red stains that littered its surface, reminders of past atrocities that would never wash away.  
  
He was emaciated and sickly-looking with sunken eyes that glistened in his bony face, like a snake staring out of the sockets of an animal’s skull. Deep in those dark eyes, I saw a tiny glimmer of light, far down in that well of nothingness and despair he radiated. Scars and sores littered the exposed area of his face, long slashes and infected, round pustules that constantly dribbled yellow viscous flood and blood down his starving body.   
  
Wheezing and coughing, he pressed the knife against Isabella’s neck, and I saw a drop of blood start to wind its way down her skin, dribbling over the soft hollow at the bottom and into her white shirt. Her blue eyes looked around wildly, the eyes of a panicked and cornered animal seeing no way out.  
  
“I’m taking the girl,” the man said. China Cat walked forward, his hands raised, radiating peace.  
  
“You don’t have to do this, brother,” he said. The man scoffed.  
  
“Yes I do, ‘brother’,” he said sarcastically. “I haven’t eaten in a week. This girl has plenty of meat on her bones. She’ll feed us well.” He smiled, showing rotted, yellow teeth and gums covered in black, oozing sores. “If you try to follow me, I’ll kill her. Got it? I have nothing to lose. I’ll skin her alive, inch by inch.” He began walking backwards with the knife still pressed tightly to her neck. He took a small, branching alleyway to the left ten feet down, disappearing in the dark crack in an instant.  
  
I looked at China Cat with wide eyes.  
  
“We have to go get her,” I said.  
  
“We better go now, then,” Mr. Grin said in a detached voice. “The trail grows cold quickly in these parts.” And we started running then, China Cat’s old body heaving deep breaths as we disappeared in the thin alleyway that ran off of Cannibals’ Row. There were no torches here, and the darkness became absolute within a few steps. The man must know these paths like the back of his hand, I thought to myself.  
  
I turned on the flashlight app on my phone, seeing China Cat reach into his pocket and do the same. The path we followed looked like a natural cavern, far different from the chiseled halls and rooms of Cannibals’ Row. I saw stalagmites and stalactites, mostly small ones only a few inches long, and the walls had a wet, shiny look to them.  
  
We ran as fast as we could, but I saw no sign of the man or Isabella. I wondered how they got so far ahead of us. Then I heard an agonized moaning sound coming from up ahead. I reached in my pocket and pulled out the knife, the one Isabella had made fun of.  
  
On the right, I saw a natural indentation in the cavern wall, one that led into a tiny chamber only a few feet tall. I saw bodies laid down on the hard stone ground, bodies with missing limbs that I thought were dead until they moved their hands and heads to look up at my light. I saw Isabella, her hands and feet tied with a rope. Then the man in the crumpled paint mask rushed out, his knife pointed at my heart.  
  
I saw it all happening in slow motion. He had to crouch to get out, and it gave me a moment of leverage over him. Instinctively, I struck out with my knife. Since he was bent over, it was the perfect height to strike at his neck. I watched the blade sink into the side of his throat, feeling him punch me in the side at the same moment. Then his eyes widened and he fell over, blood gushing from his neck.  
  
“Daddy, no!” the little girl from the beginning of the tunnel cried, rushing out of the small room and holding her bleeding father as his paint mask continued to suck in and out with his last few breaths. I looked at it all, feeling dissociated, as if I were watching someone else’s life.  
  
“That was a close one,” I whispered, looking down to see a knife sticking out of my leg. The pain hit me all at once as blood poured from the wound, making my jeans stick to my skin. I fell down, yelling out for help. China Cat ran over to me, and I wondered, at that moment, if I was dying.
