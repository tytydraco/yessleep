This is something I wanted to write long ago, but I ended up writing something else. More about that later. But after all is said and done, I still wanted to write this. It’s like I had the words stuck in my throat, and I needed to get them out – to put it all on paper. This is my message in a bottle to whomever it may concern.

I’ve always been a bit of a recluse. I am an only child, and I’ve always liked to do things that don’t require others to enjoy. You can’t play board games or team sports by yourself. But you can read, write, draw, and solve puzzles; so that’s what I’ve excelled at. I also had a peculiar affinity for the works of manga artists like Kazuo Umezu and Junji Ito, but my mother was quick to point out that it wasn’t appropriate to talk of such things in polite company.

I finished my university studies with little to no incident. I kept my head down, did the work, and passed without incident. I was not at the head of my class, and I was not the worst. I was somewhere in the middle without making much of a fuzz. That’s the space I enjoy the most; the one where I can be myself without worrying about the judgement of others.

After I finished my university studies, I had to get a job. My mother wanted me to start my own life, but I didn’t know how. One of my childhood friends, Shota, told me he could get me a junior position at his company. I just had to move a little west towards Osaka. I couldn’t refuse.

 

Living on your own for the first time is equal parts terrifying and freeing. You become a new person – the *real* you. It’s a time for transformation. You start learning new routines, new ways to manage your time, and new ways to appreciate the moments of peace you get in between work and chores.

But I could still live the way I wanted. I could keep my Umezu and Ito books in the open bookshelf. I could watch whatever shows I fancied, and I could sit up and read all night long if I wanted. In many ways, it was exactly what I wanted. Shota often asked me how I could be so chipper at work, and I always had the same answer; how could I not be?

Still, there was one piece of the puzzle that I had never managed to figure out. Women.

 

Being a recluse in Japan is a bit of a cliché, but my mother hated the idea of me becoming a lonely shut-in. I guess she refused to accept that this is what I’d always been. But she was pushing me to get out more, and to meet people. She wouldn’t stop pestering me about it, and I didn’t want to disappoint her. So I mentioned it to Shota in passing.

Now, Shota is the tallest guy I know. He sometimes leans down to blend in with others. I think he played basketball some years ago. This was a man who always had eyes on him, so he couldn’t help being social. He could spark up a conversation with anyone, because they were already looking his way.

When I mentioned my mother wanting me to get out more, it’s like it lit a fire in him. I had to beg him not to drag me to a cabaret club or a pachinko place.

“Okay,” he argued. “No cabaret. No pachinko. But then you gotta do something else.”

I didn’t want to sign up for anything without hearing about it first, but Shota was giving me a hard time.

“I’m gonna embarrass myself,” I said. “Keep that in mind.”

“Just trust me,” he smiled. “You’ll have fun.”

 

Shota set up a gōkon – a sort of group date. He had this girl he wanted to ask out named Keiko, but he figured he’d do something fun with it. So he would get two friends, and she’d get two friends, and we’d all go out together. It was hesitant at first, but it was a whole lot better than going out on my own. At least now I could slink back into the dark and hide if things got too awkward.

But I was so nervous I got a stomachache a full week in advance. I talked to Shota about it, and he suggested I try to do something to feel better about myself.

“Get a haircut!”, he suggested. “A nice jacket! Just something new, you know? Reinvent yourself.”

I followed his advice. I got an expensive haircut, a nice new shirt and jacket, some cologne… but it never really ‘clicked’ with me. It didn’t change anything. I felt like the same loser, but with a thin coat of paint.

 

After browsing stores downtown, I ended up at a small noodle place down by the canal. I was almost tearing my hair out from stress and ended up biting my nails. I didn’t even notice I was doing it until another patron pointed it out.

I wasn’t prepared for anyone to talk to me, so I almost jumped out of my seat. A man had approached me. He was European and had this pale complexion. He was dressed in all black and hid his eyes behind sunglasses. I didn’t like the look of him, but I didn’t want to seem rude. At first I thought he was standing over me, but he was sitting down – he was just really, really tall. Taller than Shota.

“You seem nervous,” he said. “Are you alright?”

I didn’t expect him to speak flawless Japanese, but there was a lot about him I didn’t expect. I put my hands down and laughed a little, giving him a nod.

“Girl trouble, hm?”

“I suppose, yes,” I nodded.

“It always is.”

 

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a little white plastic tube. It was like a long middle finger. He slid it over to me.

“Love potion,” he smiled. “It solves everything.”

“No thank you,” I smiled back. “Not interested.”

He looked at me, then down at the tube. Then he chuckled a little.

“Oh,” he continued. “Oh, I apologize. This must look bad.”

He picked the tube up and opened it. It looked like it contained some kind of sand.

“It’s for the nerves,” he said. “It’s for you, not to put in someone’s drink. It’s a beta blocker, see?”

He placed a little on his little finger and licked it up. He let out a long sigh.

“I get nervous too,” he continued. “It helps.”

He left it on the table and backed off, giving me some space.

“Consider it a gift. You’ll be irresistible, friend.”

 

By the time I finished my meal, the pale man had left. I rolled the tube over, trying to figure it out. There was a little print on the side, and it only had a couple of ingredients; microcrystalline cellulose, hypromellose, polydextrose, and powdered helianthus cerulea. Looking it up, it seemed to be small balls of powdered seeds from a peculiar blue flower. Some kind of natural herbal remedy. I decided to keep it, just in case.

When it was finally time for the group date, my stomach was doing backflips. We were supposed to have a small dinner, a couple drinks, and then head out for karaoke - but I didn’t know how I was supposed to make it through a dinner without throwing up. I had such a bad stomachache that I almost called in sick.

By lunch, the nervousness was too much. So I decided to give the tube a try. I did as the man had shown me: I took a little on my finger, and licked it.

 

There was an artificial sweetness to it, sort of grape flavored, with a powerful chemical aftertaste. But I could feel my nerves unwinding. Not as in getting sleepy, but as if I was taking three breaths at once. My lungs felt full again, and I could feel my stomach un-tightening. I could still think straight. I could feel all those intrusive thoughts, all the worries, but they were taking a back seat to more rational thinking. I could finally, *finally*, relax.

I felt so much better. I took a long walk after work and stopped at a gift shop. Instead of tearing my hair out, I got myself one of those cheesy flip combs, like in the old movies. I know it looked dumb, but I didn’t mind laughing a little at myself. Just that feeling, to be able to laugh at myself, was so foreign. So freeing. Was this how Shota felt *all the time?*

When it was time for the date, I showed up with a big smile on my face. Shota recoiled a bit at first, not recognizing me. When he realized I was just happy to be there, his demeanor shifted immediately. Suddenly we weren’t just friends – we were *best* friends. We were *unstoppable*.

 

There was me and Shota, and a guy from his job named Yuki. He was a bit of a quiet type, but still far more talkative than I would’ve been, had I not taken a leap of faith. On the other side was the girls; Keiko, Miki, and Kyo.

I was seated across from Miki. She was a timid young woman with a penchant for coding. She worked in the IT department at a big firm downtown, and Shota thought she and I would hit it off. I think, if it had been any other day, we might have. She was soft-spoken and curious, but her impression of me must’ve been something else entirely. I wasn’t exactly boastful, but I was more reckless in the way I expressed myself than usual. The others at the table didn’t mind, but I don’t think I lived up to Miki’s expectations.

I didn’t mind though. For some reason, I ended up connecting very well with Keiko, at the end of the table. I would never have expected this, because she was there mainly to spend time with Shota, but we got along great.

 

Keiko was like from a different world. She was absolutely drop dead gorgeous and had a very outgoing fun-loving kind of personality. She was easy to like, but I could notice she got a lot of side-eyes from the others. She took up a lot of space at the table and naturally fell into the conversation spotlight of whatever was talked about; overshadowing pretty much everyone else.

But it was a fun night. We had a couple drinks, sang a couple songs, and took some time to get to know one another. For example, I had no trouble telling everyone about my horror manga collection. It became quite the topic; turns out a lot of us had read those when we were younger. They still gave Miki the creeps.

Miki shared that she had a bit of a strange hobby too. Through her job, she had access to traffic cameras, so she would sometimes flip through them to see if she recognized someone she knew. For those hours when things got slow at work. Keiko, on the other hand, excitedly talked about her obsession with the band One Ok Rock.

 

As the evening came to a close, we all went our separate ways. As we did, I managed to get a moment alone with Keiko. It was just a couple of seconds, but it was enough. I don’t know what came over me.

“Can I see you again?” I asked.

“Really?” she asked. “You sure?”

“Yeah, can I?”

She was surprised, but eagerly agreed. We would check our schedules and meet the following week for a proper one-on-one date.

Coming home that night, I couldn’t stop laughing. I’d managed to do something I’d only dreamed of. To not only face my fears, but to come out with a solid win. Even if I never saw Keiko again, I had won. I’d done my best, and my best had been good enough. How could I not be relieved?

 

That whole week, I felt like a new person. I had a talk with Shota about it, and I apologized for asking Keiko out when I knew he’d been interested. Still, for a guy like Shota, it wasn’t a problem. He had women lining up around the block to date him – he was just happy I felt confident enough to try. Through this whole ordeal, he was nothing but supportive. He was a bit curious about what made me change though.

“You’re like a new man,” he said. “Was it the haircut?”

“Hair cut and a flip comb,” I chuckled. “And a little spice.”

“A little spice?” he laughed. “I don’t know what kind of spice you’re having, but I’m guessing that’s not on the regular menu.”

He was right, but I wasn’t about to share any secrets. I figured by the time the powder tube was finished, I’d gotten used to the nervousness.

 

I was on pink clouds all week long. I was texting Keiko every day, and we already had a couple in-jokes. We talked about what we were going to do, and agreed that she was going to plan it out for us. Not because I didn’t have any ideas, but because I trusted her. She appreciated that, and she promised it’d be good.

I had a chat with my mother too. I told her about our gōkon and the follow-up date with Keiko, and she was beyond herself. She was scream-laughing at the phone, hardly able to contain herself. I don’t know what she was happiest about, the prospect of her only son not being a shut-in, or the idea of having a young woman in her life to pamper.

So when date-night came around, I was ready.

 

I’d taken a boost from the tube, got a new shirt, and brought my flip comb. It felt like a good luck charm by now. Keiko had asked me to meet her at her apartment. I’d just taken a small touch of the tube-powder, so I could feel that rumbling nervousness deep down, but I could easily push it down. Still, there was something in the air that I couldn’t put my finger on.

Everything felt a little colder, a little darker. The wind howled louder than usual, and there was a strange sound somewhere off in the distance. Standing on the street outside Keiko’s apartment building, the streetlights burned me. It felt like I was being judged. Like I wasn’t really being myself. What kind of man was I tricking her to fall in love with?

As my thoughts drifted, something snapped me to attention.

 

It was an uncomfortable hissing noise, like a man struggling to breathe. I could hear it clearly. It turned something in my stomach, worse than any nervousness I’d ever felt. It made my heart pound, making me think I was having some kind of attack. As I gasped for breath, the feeling subsided, leaving me with a pounding pulse surging behind my ears; coloring my cheeks a bright red. I grasped the flip comb in my pocket, took a deep breath, and started walking. It was 7:50pm. I was a bit early, but it was fine.

I walked up the stairs, only to see that Keiko’s apartment door was slightly ajar. The auto-lock must’ve failed. I peeked inside, but it was dark.

“Keiko?” I asked. “Are you here?”

There was no response. I entered, carefully.

 

If I listened closely, I could hear that strange, struggling breath. Keiko’s apartment was pitch black; except for a small light on the right-hand side, near the kitchen. I rounded the corner and heard that struggling, hissing breath – and then it ceased.

Keiko was sitting under the kitchen light, having a cup of tea. My first thought was that she wanted to surprise me with a beautiful red dress, but a realization made my nerves run cold. She wasn’t wearing a red dress – it’d been white. It was all blood. She was bleeding so profusely from a slit in her throat that it stained the entire kitchen floor, and her beautiful white dress.

She wasn’t breathing. Not anymore.

 

I didn’t know what to do. There’d been no one around, except for that strange noise. The taste of my saliva turned salty.

“Did you hear that?” someone murmured. “What was that?”

“Why is the door open?”

Neighbors. Someone had seen *something*.

“I’m calling the police.”  
  


I ran. I ran out before I could think of anything else to do. I ran faster than I’d ever ran before, and my muscles ached with every step. I could feel every stray pebble under my cheap shoes, and how the grip struggled with every sudden turn. I disappeared into an alley, then down a small trail, and then off into the unlit back roads.

By the time I stopped running, I could hear sirens in the distance. I could barely breathe, and no tube powder could stop what I was feeling. This wasn’t being nervous; this was unfiltered *terror*. The thought hit me - I hadn’t seen the killer.

What if they were still in there?

 

I wanted to call the authorities, but I didn’t know how to explain myself. I’d been there, but I’d run away. It didn’t look good, panic or not. That panic would set me right in the crosshairs for whatever investigation they’d started. They always look at the boyfriend or husband first.

Everyone was talking about it the next day. Shota was devastated. Miki and Kyo too. Shota was the only one who knew Keiko and I had a thing going, so he didn’t know what to think. He asked me if I’d heard anything, but I just lied to him. I told him she and I had talked about a date, but that she suddenly stopped responding. I couldn’t bring myself to tell him the truth. I just couldn’t.

There were officers too. Someone had investigated her phone records and social media and found that we’d been talking. They came to talk to me at the office one day, but they didn’t arrest me – but they took my passport. Just to be sure. For now.

 

I went right back into my shell. I didn’t eat. I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t read; my hands would shake so much that the symbols would blur and move. There was nothing to take the mind of what I’d seen. That hissing noise. That heavy breathing. The dress that wasn’t really red.

I would take small doses from the tube to calm down. Just enough to be able to have dinner without throwing up. It felt like a sort of medication. I didn’t feel like a new person anymore – if anything, I was more me than ever. The recluse.

Of course, my mother was beside herself. She asked me to move back home. She had never trusted the big cities, and this was the kind of evidence she needed to convince herself that she was right.

“You can’t stay,” she would say. “Please, you can’t stay there.”

I told her I was okay, and that I needed to work. She was already heartbroken about her son being a loser – what would she think if she heard I was a suspected murderer?

 

A full month passed. The questions grew fewer, and further apart, but my feelings didn’t. I’d get these nervous cramps at seemingly random times.

Once when I walked past a dark alley, I heard that hissing breath again. I think it was some kind of air conditioning, but it sounded just the same. But there was something more to it; it was organic. *Breathing*, like a living thing. And if I stopped to look, I could almost see a pair of eyes looking back at me from the dark.

Another time, I heard it from an open window near the university dorms. I could hear people talking, but if I listened closely, there was something between their words. That same hissing breath, struggling. And although all the windows were dark, I knew there was something there. Not sleeping. Not talking. But struggling – just to breathe.

I would feel it at other times too. As I walked past a large bush near the bus station. Outside a restroom near the metro. The same sensation; sounds would dull, and I would hear that hissing breath getting louder and louder – like something coming closer. Then I’d snap out of it in a flush of white-hot panic, and run.

 

I decided I couldn’t live like that and reviewed my options. The best thing I could do was to prove my innocence. If I could somehow prove that I arrived after Keiko was already dead, I could go to the police and be cleared of all suspicion. I just had to find a way to explain it.

A name came to mind; Miki. She was a bit of a tech person, and she was a friend of Keiko’s. I figured she might be inclined to help me investigate under the guise of helping the police. And hey, maybe we could find something if we put our minds to it. Maybe there was a stone unturned.

I reached out to Miki, explaining that I was worried about what happened to Keiko, and that I wanted to do something. I asked for her help. She was reluctant, and it took her almost a full day to respond, but she agreed; if we could do something to help, she was all in.

 

I went to see her the next day. I brought my flip comb. It was less to feel confident and more for a sense of comfort, like a teddy bear. Like I was physically holding onto the last good piece of my new self.

Miki lived in a four-floor complex in a pretty cheap neighborhood, but it had a great view. I got there around 6pm. I stood outside for a while, expecting that horrible noise to come to me; but it didn’t. I was relieved. Maybe it was the tube powder I’d taken, or maybe it was just the sense of calm that came from fighting back and doing something, but I was okay.

Walking up the stairs, I felt something tap my head. Looking up, I saw one of the neighbor kids. He’d dropped a piece of candy, and it got tangled in my hair. Before I had the chance to cuss him out, he was gone.

That couldn’t be a good sign.

 

Candy-haired and determined, I knocked on her door. An image flashed into my mind. Opening the door to a dark apartment. A taste of iron in the air. A wheezing, struggling breath.

But no – it was just Miki. She met me at the door. A bit reserved, but as polite as ever. She couldn’t help but notice the piece of candy though.

“You didn’t have to bring snacks,” she snorted. “You alright?”

“Just one of those days,” I sighed. “Can I come in?”

“Sure, sure.”

 

I stepped inside, and she showed me to her living room. It was small, but very personal. You could tell this wasn’t just anyone’s place – it was Miki’s place. Printed and framed webcomic panels on the walls, volume after volume of computer science books, and a little streaming setup. This was her world; I was just visiting.

“Make yourself at home,” she said. “Would you like some tea?”

“Yes, please, thank you.”

While the kettle boiled, she showed me her laptop. She explained how she had given it some thought and figured there might be some cameras the police hadn’t checked. Apparently, some traffic cameras were thought to be out of commission, but they weren’t. She knew of a couple.

“It’ll take a while,” she said. “But I think there might be something near Keiko’s place from the night of the murder.”

 

Miki was a bit reluctant to go through with it. I figured she was just nervous, but I couldn’t know for sure. I was just eager to get an answer; something I could show to the police. She navigated a complex interface and input a code, then showed me a list of feeds scrolling across the screen.

“Let’s sort it by time,” she said. “Do you have any ideas?”

“The police said it happened around 7:30, 7:40,” I lied. “Let’s start there.”

“Alright.”

She brought up a couple of cameras listed from the area. Most of them were grayed out and uninstalled, but a couple seemed to be up and running.

“They’re old and need to be replaced. Some are to be taken out of commission,” she explained. “But people forget they’re still there.”

“Not you though.”

She smiled at that.

 

She handed me a cup of tea and let me take the reigns of the computer. Then she poked at the piece of candy still stuck in my hair.

“You want me to deal with this?” she asked.

“Would you mind?”

“Not at all, let me get a comb.”

“Wait,” I said. “Here.”

I handed her my flip comb.

“Like in the movies,” I said. “Cool, huh?”

“Yeah,” she snorted. “Real cool guy here.”

 

It didn’t take me long to find a camera I recognized. Meanwhile, Miki struggled to get the flip comb open, but she didn’t want to say anything. She was stubborn, that was for sure. Finally, I got a blurry black-and-white feed of a street I recognized. It was just outside Keiko’s apartment.

It was a bad image, and I missed the time frame a little. I landed right on the spot where I stormed out of the apartment. It was just a black shadow, but Keiko gasped. A thought spiked my mind – what if she recognized me?

“Is that it?” she said? “Is that the killer?”

To her, the thing on the screen was just a dark blob. Suspicious, but anonymous.

“I don’t know,” I said. “We have to go back further.”

Finally, Miki gave up and handed me the flip comb back. I shook my head. You had to push two buttons at once to open it. So I did.

 

A blade snapped out.

Not a comb. A *blade*.

 

I stared at it. Suddenly, I felt it. That breathing. The hissing. The struggle.

The camera feed was rolling back. I could see myself coming down the stairs, and going back under the lights. That’s where I’d first gotten that awful feeling. That’s when I’d first heard it.

But there was something strange. I was standing there for too long. Minutes. I had no memory of that.

“Is the tea any good?” Miki asked. “Is it too minty?”

“It’s… it’s fine,” I said. “I like mint.”

Then, the picture moved. I saw it in reverse. How I picked up the flip comb, and let the blade out. How I went back up those stairs.

 

And now I heard it. Those sounds. They were coming from me.

Something inside me struggled to come out. To breathe.

A new me.

 

I didn’t realize I was still holding the flip knife. I didn’t notice the stains on the edge. The camera feed rolled as I saw myself go up the stairs, and then come back out, only to go up again. I’d gone inside, done something, and come back out – only to enter again.

Miki was messing about in the kitchen to get us some biscuits.

“I have a brush, but it’s kinda bad, is that okay?” she asked. “Or I could get the scissors out.”

I didn’t answer. Instead, I heard the hissing behind my ears grow louder. I blinked, and seconds would pass. I would forget to breathe, and I’d inhale like I was surprised. Suddenly, Miki was next to me.

“Are you alright?” she asked? “You look pale.”

 

I didn’t find the right words. She placed a hand on my knee.

“It’s okay,” she said. “I’m nervous too. It’s scary.”

She leaned back, looking at the anonymous camera shadow walking up and down the stairs.

“They think he attacked others, too,” she continued. “People have gone missing.”

“What?”

“Yeah, but they’re not sure it’s connected,” she said. “But they found blood in a dorm room. A woman went missing waiting for the bus. It’s crazy. And there was-”

“-the restroom near the metro,” I interrupted

 

Miki gave me a curious look. She was listing the various places I’d felt that strange sensation boil up in the back of my mind. The many moments I’d stopped and zoned out.

I blinked.

All of a sudden, I was panting. I was holding the knife like a weapon, having stabbed it into the screen of Miki’s laptop. She had backed off and covered her mouth. She was shocked. She didn’t know what to do.

“I don’t… I don’t know what-,” I stuttered. “I don’t want to hurt you.”

“What are you saying?” she asked. “What… what is-“

 

I blinked again. Now I was standing up. The table was flipped over. Miki had backed into the kitchen. My breathing was heavy. Forced. *Struggling*, with an inhuman hiss.

“Stay away!” she yelled. “What are you doing?!”

In a moment of clarity, I dropped the knife. It clattered to the floor. But as I blinked some sweat from my eyes, I felt my body lean down to pick the knife back up. My tongue twisted into a new noise, a new voice. A new me. Something raw and newborn.

“*Little wheat.”*

 

I blinked. For a second, I saw another place. A starless sky. A dead, gray moon; hanging in the sky like a dry leaf that’s forgotten how to fall. Darkness in the corner of my eyes. A rough black sand shifting under the naked soles of my feet.

I blinked it away. I was outside. I pushed a man over the railing, and he scream as he hit the pavement. I was chasing Miki. I was holding the knife again. I could barely breathe, but she was having trouble getting down the stairs. I was faster – dashing forward with complete abandon. I was going to catch her. I was going to puncture her throat, letting out that wheezing breath from her body.

But I couldn’t. I had to do something. *Anything*.

 

It took every ounce of willpower I could muster, but I let myself lose balance. The momentum sent me crashing to the ground, screaming. Miki hurried down the stairs, screaming for help.

I blinked.

I was almost back on my feet now. Concerned neighbors surrounded me, pointing and screaming. I was waving them off with my knife. I screamed and tried to throw the blade over the railing, but it was too late. I blinked again.

I stood up. Someone stepped back, holding their hand. They had a big cut in the palm of their hand.

“No!” I screamed. “No, please, stay away!”

And another voice joined my throat.

“Stay away, *little wheat!*”

In a final act of desperation, I plunged the knife into my leg. It was the only way to stop me from running.

 

There were angry faces. Blood coming down my hands. Cold steel on my wrists. Blood spatter as I clawed and spit against anonymous hands. And as I blinked – another place. A place so dead that I would have preferred to feel the grave.

The next time I opened my eyes, I was calmer. My breathing slower. There were lights, and I was in handcuffs. People were crying. A man in uniform was checking my pockets for weapons.

I could see Miki in the crowd. She was talking on the phone. I tried to tell her I was sorry, but my throat was too hoarse. All I could let out was a hissing breath, as I tried my best not to choke.

And that was that.

 

Over the next few days, things got intense.

Without the powder from the tube, my nervousness came back. I was so messed up in the head by then that I couldn’t begin to fathom the consequences of my actions. Just thinking about it sent this chill all the way from my stomach to my jaw.

I didn’t know how to argue against it. To say it wasn’t me, but *another* me. A *new* me. That’s all this had ever been – an attempt to reinvent myself. Instead, I’d managed to lose myself. And not only had I cost people their lives, I may very well have lost my own along the way.

 

I was allowed to write a letter to explain myself. It was something to be shown to a judge or prosecutor, I think. I don’t know if it is common practice, but they gave me a strange look when they handed the blank paper to me. That’s when I first wanted to tell this story. But that first time I put pen to paper, I blinked. And when I looked up, something had already been written on the page.

*‘I regret nothing,’* it said. *‘I must reap the wheat to starve them. I will pave the way for others. I will burn the fields and salt the earth with tears.’*

That was all. They took the paper from me and presented it to the judge despite my protest.

 

And this is what I don’t understand. I was let go. They said I couldn’t be prosecuted. I was free to go, no further questions or charges. I didn’t understand it. I walked out of the courthouse a free man, with all my belongings right back in my pockets. Even the flip knife.

On my way out, I stopped to throw the tube away; only to notice something in the garbage bin outside.

It was filled with white tubes, just like mine.

I looked back at the courthouse a final time. No one was angry that I’d been released. Many looked relieved. Happy, even. Warm, cautious smiles.

Some of them could *understand*.

 

I can’t take any chances. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I have retreated to an anonymous location, and I’ve told no one about it. Not even my mother, or Shota.

I haven’t seen the powder in a long time, but I still feel it. I lose track of time. Sometimes just seconds, sometimes minutes. I have a step counter to see if I’ve moved, and at most it has increased by a hundred. But that number seems to go up.

I know this confession is little to no excuse or comfort. I wish I could’ve done things differently. Hell, I wish I could’ve *been* different.

 

You can say a lot of things about me and my errors. I have said them a million times.

But the old me was the first victim of what I’ve become. It died ahead of them all.

And that part of me is never coming back.
