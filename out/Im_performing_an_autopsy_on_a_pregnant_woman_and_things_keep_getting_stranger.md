I knew her.

In all my years of work, I've developed a strange relationship with death. I see it as something purely physical - the body in front of me is just an organism who's stopped living. That's all that it is. And yet, it took me by surprise to have her on my table.

I'd seen her around the hospital before - excited, glowing, talking about what her life would look from now on. She was a bit... distracted sometimes, saying that great things were coming, but I didn't expect her to die right before giving birth. She was found drowned in her own home, with writings on her wrists and on the back of her neck, and she'd been laying in her bathtub for days before her neighbor found her.

She had no husband, no relatives. They expected me to rule it as a suicide - I didn't believe that, since it made no sense. Why would she kill herself right before giving birth? Right before becoming a mother, a thing she'd been so excited about?

I'd been called in the middle of the night to work on her - they said her body was already in a pretty fragile state, and I needed to be precise and fast before they could wrap this tragedy up.

I won't weight you down with all the gory details. I'll just go over the process really fast, so that you'll get an idea of what I do.

First came some of the paperwork and observations, along with the external examination and photographs. I didn't notice anything besides the obvious signs of drowning and damage done by the 3 days spent in the bathtub. Although, if I'm being honest (but that might have been just me), I thought that the skin surrounding the writing (wrists, neck) was lighter than the rest and harder.

Next came the internal examination. I'd been plagued by a wave of sadness, not wanting to move on with the procedure, but I tensed up and kept on working. Again, the usual signs of drowning.

I froze with the instruments in hand. I was the only one in the morgue (or, at least, the only one alive), and it might have been the lack of sleep or the general eerie atmosphere that was making me feel unsure of what I was seeing. There was no earthly way she could have made those carvings on her ribs. Tiny carvings of the same... symbols. My throat was dry, which made me feel like I was choking on air, and suddenly the collar of my scrub felt too tight for me.

It wasn't my imagination. Her ribs were covered in these carvings. Could it be some bone eating bacteria? I knew it was pointless to even ask that question, because I knew it wasn't.

I took out my phone to take a close-up of the ribs (I know that wasn't too professional, but I had no choice).  The moment I took the picture, something clattered in the distance. I looked up to the door to the hallway. No one should be here.

I took a sharp breath and carefully put my gloves back on, feeling the blood slowly drain from my face as I worked my way down to her amniotic sack. I was expecting to see something that would make my skin crawl, and I knew that no matter how hard I braced myself, it would still hit me hard.

When I opened it, it was... empty.

There were no signs of a fetus. It was as if it had just... disappeared, leaving her placenta and the umbilical cord behind, intact.

There was no baby there.

I stepped back from her and took off my gloves. I rubbed my eyes. That had to be impossible, her tummy had been perfectly round, and I'm pretty sure there would have been signs if she'd given birth before or after dying.

It was... inhumane. Unnatural.

Everything indicating a pregnancy existed, all except for... the baby.

I carefully closed her up, trying not to think about the missing baby and the symbols, then filled the report. I wrote *suicide* on it.

I wasn't 100% sure of that. I didn't need to be. They'd been clear with the instructions: just get it done. Fast.

I creaked the door open, and peered into the hallway. The clattering had come from the supply room, and I hadn't heard the door open or close, so what had done it was still there.

I approached it slowly, holding my breath, as if I were afraid to make a sound. I placed my hand on the doorknob and twisted.

*Click.*

It was locked. On the inside.

I knocked. "Hey," I whispered, "is anyone there?"

What followed was an unusual sound, something like someone sucking the air through their teeth.

I looked back to the hallway, ending with the morgue. The door was swinging open. I couldn't remember if I'd closed it or not, and I didn't want to. I decided I my job was finished there.

I closed up and got into my car, then drove home in silence. I live alone, so me coming home at 3AM would not disturb anyone.

After doing my night routine and going to bed, I found myself twisting and turning, strange dreams pressing onto me, like the ones you have when you have a fever. I thought I heard a cry at one point, until I realized it had been my own.

I opened my eyes after what seemed like minutes, to discover it was a little over 6AM. In the soft glow of the morning, my window had fogged up a bit, and I couldn't help but stare, perplexed, at the fresh print of a child's hand on inside of the glass.
