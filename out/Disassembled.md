The worst part wasn’t that they stole my phone. It was what they took with it.

I never thought about backing up my stuff. Why would I? It was my phone, my digital safe, the guardian of my memories. It was always there, in my pocket.

I never set a complex password, never uploaded my photos to the cloud, never made backups. I thought that was for paranoids. I wasn’t one of them.

Until some bastard on a motorcycle ripped it from my hands.

Reality hit me like a punch. Beyond the rage and helplessness, I felt a cold emptiness in my chest. Something more than an object had been taken.

Everything was in there.

The childhood photos my mom had sent me before she died, the voice messages where she told me to take care of myself. The texts with my ex—the last conversation before everything went to hell. The videos of my dog when he was still alive.

My life was trapped in a box of glass and metal, and now it belonged to someone else.

That night, I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t. I tossed and turned in bed, overwhelmed by an irrational panic. Like a part of me was still out there, in the hands of strangers.

And then, the horror began.

Somewhere in a shady repair shop, someone pried open my phone with a screwdriver.

The screen separated from the casing with a suction sound, like flesh being peeled from bone.

My chest tightened.

They ripped out the battery and tossed it aside like it meant nothing. Something inside me tore apart.

The circuit boards were extracted with surgical precision. Greasy fingers lifted them, inspected them. A cold shiver ran down my spine—like my skull had been cracked open.

It wasn’t just a phone. It was me.

Someone connected the memory to another device. Hundreds of images flashed on an unfamiliar screen, memories that didn’t belong to those eyes.

My life, dismembered and exposed.

My mom’s photos.

My dog’s videos.

My last texts with my ex.

Someone chuckled. Maybe they found something funny—a dumb selfie, a ridiculous message. My face burned, as if I were there, naked, violated, my past being sold off piece by piece like meat at a butcher shop.

I closed my eyes. I couldn’t bear it.

But then, the phone did something impossible.

On their screen, my last photo appeared. They hadn’t opened it, but it showed up on its own.

A mirror selfie. My eyes locked onto the camera.

But something was wrong.

In the image, I was smiling.

A shiver ran through the thieves. They tried to close the photo, but another one popped up. Another selfie.

Now, I was closer.

In the next, my smile widened.

In the last one, I was gone.

Just the empty mirror.

A scream rang out.

The screen went black.

But I was still there.

Waiting.

I materialized in the room.

Not as flesh and blood—but as a hologram, a projection of something beyond their understanding.

The thief was frozen in place. His eyes widened in terror. He tried to move, but he couldn’t.

I stepped closer.

I lifted my hand and, with a single finger, touched his forehead.

It was a soft touch, barely there. But it shattered him.

In a single second, he felt everything he had caused by stealing phones.

The fear.

The despair of people who lost years of memories.

The tears of someone who would never recover the photos of their dead mother.

The hatred.

The helplessness.

Everything he had inflicted on others—now, he lived it.

His body convulsed. His eyes flooded with tears. His breathing became ragged. He clutched his head, trembling like a child, until he collapsed to the floor, sobbing like a baby.

He was on the verge of a breakdown.

I just watched as the phone—the object of all this suffering—reset itself.

Black screen.

"Factory reset in progress…"

One by one, the files vanished. Photos. Videos. Messages.

My digital past was erased completely.

And in that moment, I understood.

Letting go is an act of liberation.

I let go of my digital past. I freed it.

Now, I knew the lesson: Live in the now.

I took a deep breath. I felt at peace.

I woke up with a strange sense of happiness.

I walked to the fridge, took a sip of juice. Life goes on.

I sat in front of my laptop and opened my email.

A new message.

Subject: "Factory reset process completed."

My hand froze on the mouse.

Cold sweat dripped down my back.

I was in SHOCK.

The dream…

WAS IT REAL?
