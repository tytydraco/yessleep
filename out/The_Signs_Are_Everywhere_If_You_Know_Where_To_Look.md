Tulips and stars. Goldfinches and hearts. The compass rose. Where I grew up, the symbols are out in the open, painted on barns and houses. Unquestioned.

We don’t really have folklore here. Not proper folklore, like the Appalachians do. Our woods aren’t as deep, our mountains aren’t as scary. We have honeymoon resorts and chain restaurants. 

But the Poconos do have stories:
I was five when my Oma told me about the old Purdytown cemetery lying under the waters of Lake Walenpaupak.
I was seven when I heard about Don Decker making it rain indoors in Stroudsburg.

I was ten when I first heard that Lake Prompton Campground Spa was weird. 
Not haunted.
Not cursed.
Weird.

People said that guests reported strange lights in the woods, and eerie voices drifting across the lake at night. They said that the woods changed in the off season, and that was why the owners wouldn’t allow campers after the end of September. 

That last one wasn’t true, I found out. They did allow special guests in the off season. That was my first job.

I was three months out of high school, some of my friends went to college, the rest went to boot camp. I was living at home, no plans, so when my dad told me that that he had pulled some strings for me to be the off season caretaker at Lake Prompton, I wasn’t in a position to say no.

So i settled into my strange little existence. Apart from the schedule (7PM to 7AM), the job was easy during the week: make sure nobody snuck in to have keg parties or whatever. Nobody ever tried. 
Saturday nights were when it became a bit more complicated. First I had to open the gate and let the off season guests in. The fancy cars with New York plates would start to pull up around 8PM, and I would go park them in the one paved lot while the guests made their way up the trail away from the lake, up towards the family field.
In the summer, the family field was for softball, or volleyball, or soccer. In the off season, it was for… well that was none of my business, really. I was just there to light the wards. 

At the four corners of the massive field there were cast iron circles with symbols inside that looked like hex signs from the side of a barn. 
There were three symbols on the north side of the lake that bordered the field.

My job was to go to the field wards at 9PM and ignite each one with a wooden match, so that the thin strips of charcoal made burning sigils.

At midnight I would go do the same at the lake, then go extinguish the field wards.

I was told not to look at the guests when I did this, and I was happy to comply. The sounds were bad enough: angry laughter and happy squeals. and an awful chattering that sounded like it was coming from the woods and floating on the wind.

When the sun came up, the off-season weirdos tipped me generously and were on their way before breakfast. 

This worked out great for about two months. But then Kara called me. We had been friends as kids, but didn’t hang out much in high school. I was a stoner dirtbag, she always had a boyfriend on the football team. But I guess with school over she was bored.

Halloween was a Friday night. She met me in the game room a few minutes after nine. The field wards were already lit, and we had nothing to do for three hours. She brought cheap beer and expensive weed. We went through both way too quickly. 

We laughed. We lip synced 80s hair metal songs on the jukebox. I don’t who kissed who first, I just know we stopped paying attention to the time.

I heard the first scream about five minutes past midnight.  I stood up and ran for the lake. I forgot to tell Kara not to follow. 

By the time all the three lake wards were lit, the field was a cacophony of shrieks.  This time there was no way to avoid looking at the guests. They were all writhing on the ground. And they weren’t alone.
Hazy orbs hovered over and around and through the off season guests. The orbs were whispering, a constant malicious chatter. The people on the ground didn’t seem to like what they were hearing.
The field was a mess of dead leaves, bonfires, and screaming rich people.

I managed to ignore all of this and got three of the field wards lit. I almost made it to the fourth. Kara must have followed me. I turned around when I heard her yelling. 

“He’s not even my real dad… how could they…” 

I didn’t have time to wonder what she was talking about. One of the orbs hit me and I knew. 

I knew everything. 

I knew that Kara only approached me because she was terrified that she was in love with Sarah Kauffman.

I knew that these wealthy idiots used the orbs to get information about stocks and markets and foreign governments.

I knew that these wards were the only thing keeping them from being mad by unlimited information. 
I knew that I fucked that up.

Somehow I made it to the fourth ward (which I now knew predated the Elder Futhark by a thousand years). As soon as it was lit,  the chattering orbs were swept off into the woods. They had gotten what they needed. They fed on the minds of the guests. Fresh memories, new experiences. They consumed stories, and gave stories back. 

It didn’t matter that I was fired the next day. Despite needing to go to summer school for business math in 11th grade, within a week I opened a commodity trading account. Kara did too. Within a month I paid off my parents’ house. I moved out right after. I couldn’t look them in the eye knowing what I did about them. Kara had the same problem I think, she moved to Manhattan by Thanksgiving. 

The money should have made me happy. Or at least satisfied. But knowing what I did about what all these companies were doing…if ignorance is bliss, then this kind of knowledge is hell. I couldn’t stop seeing symbols. I knew that those weren’t really arches on that burger chain logo. I knew why the mouse ears were perfect spheres on that corporate mascot. 

Every symbol is  a story. Every story is a means of control. Millions of children reading books about a boy with his forehead marked… if they only knew what it meant.
Nothing was free of arcane meaning. Nothing was benign. The puppets I loved on tv as a kid. Frog and bear and pig. My god, they had been on my bedsheets.

And Halloween, where all this started. They told us stories about the veil between the living and the dead. Those symbols- the face in the gourd especially- don’t open the mind up to the dead, they open it up to shopping suggestions. Thats why Santa immediately follows Halloween candy in stores.

I mostly avoid people these days. I don’t want to look at a barista and know the awful way she betrayed her best friend in middle school. It’s bad enough I know what the mermaid on her corporate logo means. Tv isn’t really for me these days either. I can’t focus on a show, I just see the symbols everywhere. Team logos, superhero costumes. Sigils and glyphs, guiding probabilities and steering markets. Burrowing orders into viewers minds. Books are better. Usually.
Despite knowing who/what/when/where, I never get to know why. Why are we at the mercy of these weird forces? Why do these symbols work the way they do? Why are there entities in the woods that can alter us?

I don’t know anything about the shapes from the woods.  I know that they were feeding on our minds, but I don’t know what they are,  or how or why the wards worked. Nobody else does either. I have searched everywhere from the dark web to the archives of the British museum. Nobody has ever written down anything about them. And if they have it has disappeared. 

That doesn’t bode well for me, or this story, I suppose. It doesn’t matter. I  have told this story to people a bunch of times over the years. And I’m pretty sure that some of the people I told went to the campground and paid to see for themselves. Aging stoner dirtbags don’t keep secrets like bankers and bureaucrats. 

It doesn’t matter anymore. I’m tired of only knowing part of the story. Every moment is loaded with information without context.

So I’m going back.

The campground in the Poconos is still there, but there are many other places that provide the same service. That much I know. 

Maybe this time  I can find out what those orbs are, or who is behind all these symbols infecting everything. Or maybe I will just end up like those off-season guests, screaming on the ground with more information than my brain can hold. 

Either outcome is better than this.
