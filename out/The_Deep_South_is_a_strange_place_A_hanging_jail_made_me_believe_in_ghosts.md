Every small town has its own little quirks, legends, shit like that. Blackshear isn’t any different, coming straight from a near lifelong resident, and there are plenty of weird things that you learn to not mess with early on. Unfortunately, I was a stupid-ass kid at one time, and my stupid-ass friends enabled a lot of things that, in hindsight, should have gotten us killed.

Of course, we probably deserved it. We were pretty mischievous back in the days before we had the money to do anything and had to make our own entertainment. It didn’t take long to learn our lessons about what was safe and what wasn’t, though.

The first thing you’ll need to know is that Blackshear is a small town in the heart of Southeast Georgia. The old Okefenokee swamp is right nearby, a bunch of old trainyards mean there’s always something rolling through, but otherwise it’s a tiny place, all things considered. Plenty of old buildings along the main street, pretty small population, and definitely still learning to leave the antiquities of the south behind. Especially when I was growing up, because being a queer kid who didn’t know much about who they were wasn’t easy there.

That’s what led me to my little friend group. Evie, Nick, Avery, Chris, and a few others like Erin and Sarah. Other than Chris and Nick, we were all in the same graduating class of 2012. Nick was a grade below us, and Chris was my best friend and neighbor who was about two years older. All amazing people, but we didn’t always make the best decisions when it came to self-preservation.

One of our favorite places to hang out was the park. It wasn’t much, just a small playground, a couple of picnic tables, and a swing set. But it was right smack in the middle of town, easy enough for all of us to meet up with the most minimal of transportation. Which was a good thing because I was the only one with a damned car, and everyone else was a freeloader. Nonetheless, every Friday after school got out, and even after graduating, we would all meet up to just shoot the shit and let off steam from the week. Then we would figure out where to go from there, often staying out until the morning hours despite having work the next day.

Right next to the park is one of the town’s most famous landmarks- the old Hanging Jail. That’s what everyone called it, at least. It was finally made a historic landmark back in 2020, with the state of Georgia even putting money forward to restore and maintain it. Though I don’t know if they would have done that if they knew what was in the place.

I’ve had two experiences here. One as a small kid, only ten years old. The next was nearly a decade later at nineteen.

Before I knew what it was, my stupid self just thought it was a jail cell suspended in the air. Yeah, the real thing is definitely much worse. 

This place isn’t huge. It was built in 1894, brick and steel that’s still there today, though in much worse shape. It’s two stories, with the bottom being holding cells and the jailer’s desk. The top floor was where it got the reputation from. I’m including one of the historical pages on it so you can get a better picture, but there’s a cell up on the top floor for the more long-term occupants, and one solitary tower that juts out higher than the rest of the building. That’s the interior gallows.

One small, white door opens up to what amounts to a very toll closet. It extends above the jail, a noose hanging from the ceiling, and a drop down from the initial door. The idea was that any criminals deserving of the noose would walk through their final door with the rope on their neck, dropping into the empty space below. Then, the jailer and everyone else could avoid seeing the terror in the condemned person’s eyes by just shutting the door until the deed was done. Impersonal and effective, the American way. 

Granted, there was never a hanging recorded in the entire history of the jail, which was shut down in favor of a larger police department right across the road and a separate jail just down the highway in the mid-1900s. Then the place was allowed to fall into disrepair over the years, with broken windows and rotting boards becoming the trademark of it. Despite all that, nobody ever put forward to take the place down, and the town continued to evolve as it decayed in the center, gathering graffiti and dust.

Now, with all that in mind, even without any hangings actually happening in it, you’re about to say ‘What the fuck’? Because the school system here has one hell of a way of teaching history.

In third grade, we took a “local civics” field trip. What that meant was basically taking a bus down to the courthouse on Main Street and making our way down from there. We went into the courthouse, saw where the cases were heard, visited the police department, the post office, then stopped off for sack lunches in the park before heading back to school. Overall, pretty boring for a bunch of kids who just wanted to trade Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

Now, I don’t believe that the teachers wanted to fuck with us, but they definitely wanted to give us a scare considering it was early October at the time. Actually it was the day after my birthday, now that I think about it. God, that just makes it worse in hindsight. Happy birthday, have some childhood trauma!

So one of the last stops on the tour was a piece of Blackshear history- the fuckin’ Hanging Jail. Now, seventy ten year old kids in an old, rotting building doesn’t seem like the best idea to me now at thirty years old, but hey, it was 2003, shit was weird. They paraded us into the small first floor, the old police chief accompanying us in and telling us the history of the place. The old cells were rusted, and the smell of mold is the most prominent memory I have of the place. Sebastian, one of my best friends through middle school, was joking around about something stupid, but all I can remember was the chill when we entered. 

It wasn’t even cold out, we were barely into what we refer to in the south as “Fallse” or False Fall, where the temperature starts to cool off to a lovely seventy-five degrees high instead of the feeling of sweat on Satan’s ballsack that permeates most of the year. Still, when we stepped into the hanging jail I felt my bones chill, despite how warm it was. There was no reason for it either, considering this place was so old there was no ventilation other than the broken windows, with heat and mosquitoes coming and going as they pleased.

We listened to the little spiel of the chief before they led us upstairs, which again, seventy ten year old kids in a rotting jail that wasn’t structurally sound on the best days was certainly a choice. There, the chief told us about what they used the gallows for (again, we were TEN) and opened the door to the chute so we could see.

Now, I don’t know if the noose was left up intentionally, but good lord it was swinging around like there was a cyclone going in that closet. The next few minutes are something I still haven’t forgotten two decades later.

”…so when someone would get hung, they would close the door after they push them in. Then, they would just go about their business for the rest of the day, and take them down later!” Chief said, miming pushing someone in before slamming the creaky door shut. Then, as he talked about coming back for them later, he opened the door again.

There, now slowly swinging back and forth was a body, neck bulging out from around the old, moldy rope that was suspending it. He was probably middle-aged, balding with wisps of dark brown hair falling over his face and ears. His mouth was open in a scream that didn’t have any air to make it audible, blood crusted around where the rope was digging into his pale blue skin. 

The part I remember the most though is his eyes. Bulging out of his skull against the pale face, a disgusting yellow with red fissures jutting from the edges, threatening to pop and escape their prison. I’m sure he was supposed to be dead, considering the state of his skin tone and the crusting blood, but I saw his hands and feet jerking sporadically, like he was still trying to escape his damnation.

I started crying right then and there, freaking the hell out and melting down. I swear, the next week didn’t allow me to think of anything else. Every time I closed my eyes, the only thing I could feel was his bulging eyes staring me down, almost looking right through me through time. 

Nobody knew why I was melting down. One of the teachers had to walk me out to get some fresh air, and I was almost to the point of puking from nausea. I thought I was going fucking crazy at only ten years old because nobody else seemed to notice the hanging corpse when chief opened the door. My teacher called my mom to come pick me up when we got back because I was… I don’t know, terrified doesn’t even seem to do it real justice when it comes to how I felt in the moment.

I told my mom about what I saw and she just shrugged it off as an overactive imagination, not that she was happy about the school taking us in there in the first place though. I had nightmares all night, thinking that the body was going to come get me at any moment, or that I would open my closet to get dressed the next morning and be face to face with him. But nobody believed me.

The next morning was one of the first times I ever spoke to Evie. She came up to me at recess, worry on her face and obviously terrified to speak. Her words suddenly validated me in a way that nothing else ever has, “You saw the hanging man, too?”

That was one of the first memories I have with her, though we wouldn’t become good friends until highschool. Talking to her at the time though was like a massive weight lifting off my chest. After a while, maybe a few months, the memory started to fade and I told myself it was just something we imagined, like my mom said. I was always kind of a scaredy cat when I was a young kid, so it didn’t take much. Of course, we would later find out that much of why I was scared was a delightful mix of autism and extreme anxiety, but mental healthcare in the early 2000s rural south wasn’t ready for that. My grandma’s church praying for me didn’t do much to help.

Fast forward ten years and Evie is basically my other half, like the scene from Spongebob where he shows him and Squidward fused together ‘like brothers, only closer’. She was one of my few friends that stuck by me when the church group. I was in ostracized me over some issues with a girlfriend at the time, who then went on to just ghost me before I saw her making out with another guy in the hall. That’s a whole different story not meant meant for here though. You think Catholic excommunication is bad? Try sinning as a Southern Baptist.

So, now it’s a humid summer night. We’re hanging out at the park like usual, though it’s only Evie, Nick, and myself this time. Evie and I had just graduated, and were listening to Nick tell us about how our AP biology teacher taught his class how to make moonshine the other day. Considering he got inspired by Breaking Bad and taught us how to (theoretically) make meth the year before, it’s an improvement. 

Anyway, we decided to fuck with one of our friends, Haleigh, who lived right next to the park. She couldn’t come out that night because she was sick or had family over or something, I don’t remember. We were close enough to access her wifi, including the wireless printer she kept in her room. Being shithead teenagers, we connected with one of our phones, typing out messages in our notes apps before firing them off to her printer. Evie went first, writing out ‘Send nudes’ and hitting print. 

Nick got a VERY confused call from Haleigh literally seconds later, telling him all about how her printer suddenly went off. Then we started sending all the nonsensical shit we could think of. This was 2013, and early memes were in full effect so we sent a few troll faces, some ‘I see you’ and ‘u mad’ memes too. We thought we were fucking hilarious, okay?

Except Nick couldn’t keep a cover for shit, and started laughing as Haleigh was beginning to go crazy on the phone. At this point I don’t think she was even worried so much as angry at how much ink was being used. Nick spilled, saying that it was just us fucking with her and that she needs to put a password on her wifi. We all had a good laugh, thinking that was the end of the shenanigans since it was getting close to midnight. Then we saw the lights.

There was a flickering light going off on the top floor of the hanging jail. Dim, but consistently flickering like the bulb was on its last legs. Considering the electrical in the place hadn’t been messed with since well before it closed down, there was no way it should have been on.

Again I would like to reiterate- we were all what would be considered honor students at the small school we attended. Granted, we were still fucking stupid. It became a dare/test of bravery almost immediately, with Nick and I both curious about what it was while Evie was saying we should nope out of there immediately. In the end, peer pressure won. 

The door to the jail wasn’t locked, if only because the deadbolt on it was so rusted it had crumbled off long ago. Now it was held closed by a bungee cord and a prayer, assuming that nobody was going to break into the old place. Not a bad strategy, because why the hell would anyone want to break into this place?

Dumbass kids, that’s who! Evie and I told Nick about what we saw as kids, but ever the skeptic, he brushed it off as just us being too easily terrified. Ironic considering I write horror for a living now, but he wasn’t really wrong. Evie refused to go in, instead staying on lookout in the park to text us if anyone might be coming around. As we paused before the door, both taking a deep breath, I could tell Nick was just as anxious as I was, despite his act.

The bottom floor was dark, with only the flickering light coming down from the small, twisting staircase to cast eerie shadows. There was a desk still in the corner, small lamp on it shattered across the floor. A window nearby was boarded, and one lone street lamp outside put a beam of light right through onto the latticed cell bars. Despite the deep layers of rust on them, it was like they were shining in the dim light, pristine as the day they were forged.

Light was still flickering from upstairs, and we cautiously went up the creaking, fragile stairs one by one. Every step made me feel like I was going to fall through the rotten boards, waiting to get dragged down to whatever dark hell might be lurking below us. As we got closer to the top, the flickering light suddenly went dark, plunging us into darkness.

Both of us pulled phones out, turning flashlights on and feeling like we should run at any moment. Of course, that’s when things started to go wrong. We got the text from Evie- ‘COPS HERE. DON’T COME OUT.’

”Fuck.” I heard Nick swear in front of me. 

“You’re the one that’s going to only get juvenile charges if we get caught, shut up.” I hissed back. There wasn’t any getting around it, we had to turn our flashlights off and just hope for the best. 

From where we were near the top of the steps there was more light coming in from outside. The moon was full too, and despite cloud cover it would shine right through the back windows at some points, illuminating the door to the gallows. My breath caught in my throat, a noose of anxiety making me almost choke. All the dust and mold up here didn’t help much, but when the door slowly creaked open, light of the moon fading in dark clouds, Nick and I both reached a hand out to each other to confirm it wasn’t the other fucking about in the shadows. 

It seemed like the creak went on for hours, every single second building dread as the inner room of the gallows was invisible, shrouded in a void of darkness.

”Ross,” Nick said, his voice shaky under his breath, “What the hell is doing that?”

”I don’t fucking know.” I said back, the creak now getting louder, more high-pitched like a scream from the depths of hell. Suddenly the moon was back out, casting silver beams into the gallows, illuminating the horror inside. 

The entire thing was crowded with bodies, each hanging from its own noose up on the ceiling. Those bulging, yellow and red eyes drilled into us from every single one, all of them staring us down in their dying breaths. Some were reaching out hands toward us, as if begging for help, while others were trying to use the bodies around them as leverage, desperately trying to clamber over their fellow condemned to save themselves. I saw dozens of different people in there, but all had the same look of terror, seeing death come for them.

Suddenly a light began to glow from the gallows pit, orange embers becoming a raging inferno in just seconds. As the door was swung open to hit the wall behind it from the force of the flames, Nick and I stood there, frozen in place. The heat from the pyre should have been enough to get us to run, and I don’t know how the place didn’t immediately catch fire completely. Then, from below where the fires were emanating, hands emerged, pulling the bodies down like fruit being plucked off the tree. Some had the noose break, suddenly becoming free as they were dragged down by a new terror. Others were beheaded, the force of the rope’s tension pulling their head right off as they were pulled down. I swear I heard a pop as some of them came apart, spines separating from the rest of the skeleton as the heads toppled off after their now-falling bodies. 

Then as quickly as it began, the door slammed back closed, not a hint of any flame or bodies. We tore ass out of there, tripping down the steps over each other in a mad rush to the door. My leg went through the last step, twisting my ankle but luckily not breaking it. When we burst out into the humid night air, soaked in cold sweat that chilled us to the bone, there was a cop car parked right in front of us. 

Thank FUCK it was one of the cops we knew, and one that was relatively chill to our stupid teenage bullshit. He could definitely tell that we had been through something, because Nick and I were tripping over words, telling him the story of nooses, flames, and ghosts. It’s honestly a wonder he didn’t take us in on suspicion of being totally wasted, even though we were stone-cold sober and had no way of buying alcohol. In the end, he just told us to leave, making a note that we must have learned whatever lesson we needed in there.

We would still hang out at the park, but from then on we would just avoid going within twenty feet of the damned building. On occasion we would see the light flickering up top again, but Nick and I definitely knew better than to go back in. Evie learned her lesson years ago, same time I should have, and had this air of “I told you so” for months afterward. None of the others believed us though. On two other occasions out there, we swear we saw people watching us from the second floor, multiple crowded in each window as they glared down at us below. Those yellow, bulging eyes watched every move we made.

Reminiscing like this has me remembering a lot. It’s still something we talk about on the occasion when we can get together, usually over drinks though. My wife thinks we’re just pulling her leg about it, but I swear to god we saw something really fucked up in there. I don’t know if it was just bad energy attached to the place or if there were actually some executions there that stayed off the books, but research has turned up next to nothing. Most everyone who was around when the place was still functioning is dead now, so it may be a mystery lost to time. 

I’ve got a few other stories about growing up in the area, but it’s getting late now and my head hurts. If there’s enough interest, though, I’ve had all kinds of crazy shit happen. A possible cryptid, theater ghosts, and a hitchhiker I definitely never should have picked up, just for the start. Childhood and my teen years were fucking [wild](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/XC3rDsjbs7).
