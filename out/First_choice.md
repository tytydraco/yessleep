I remember that place with a deep sense of unease, as if the memory itself is still unfolding somewhere outside of time.

It was an island that seemed peaceful at first glance. Pale sand, a constant sea, small cabins scattered near the shore. Above them, a village climbed the hill through old, cracked asphalt roads, lined with wooden houses soaked by endless rain. To the right of the island, beyond the last buildings, began a desert of red sand — dry, silent, unnaturally heavy.

It was on an ordinary day that the old woman approached me.

I was walking alone along the beach when she appeared beside me without warning. She was short and hunched, with tangled hair slipping from beneath a simple hood. Her face was painfully ordinary. Her smile was not. It felt like it already knew what I was about to lose.

She carried a staff made from a thick, twisted branch and spoke as if she were offering help.

She said she would grant me the gift of choice.

But if I accepted, she would make the first choice for me. Not by force. By kindness. Like someone taking your hand and signing something they know you would sign yourself.

She spoke of someone very close to me. Someone already gravely ill. She said I could choose whether this person lived or died. There was a cost: if I chose for them to live, they would feel, constantly, the pain of a death that never came.

I didn’t accept. At least, not consciously. I walked away and returned home believing that ignoring her would be enough.

As I climbed toward the village, I felt something move. Not behind me — far away. Beyond the island, perhaps beyond the world — becoming aware that I had been marked.

When I arrived, I found that person very close to me in absolute agony. Not just physical pain. It was as if their body was trapped between two incompatible fates. That was when I understood the trap. The woman had already chosen. She hadn’t given me a gift — she had used what I would never refuse.

I tried to return to the beach to find her, but before I could, one of the cabins caught fire.

I knew, without knowing how, that I could decide. It wasn’t power. It was a demand. I chose to stop the fire to save a few children. The cost came instantly.

My arm became a living burn. Not a scar — an open, pulsing pain. As if the fire had been transferred into me. It never healed. It never eased. It only reminded.

After that, the choices piled up.

I vaguely remember a drunk man who had killed his own daughter. I remember the family begging. I chose to keep her alive. The next day, the entire family was gone. Not dead. Simply… erased. The girl breathed, but something in her eyes didn’t belong there anymore.

Every choice saved someone and condemned something else. Sometimes another person. Sometimes a part of me.

As days passed, that presence drew closer. I felt it even when I slept. Until I finally saw it in the distance, moving through rain and sand.

I fled beyond the beach, into the red sand dunes. There I found symbols almost invisible on the ground — ancient runes, scattered across the world, ignored by modern eyes. Standing on them made me invisible to the creature.

On one of them, I stood perfectly still as it approached. So close that I watched it rest. It lay inside an open coffin, covered by a transparent dome, as if it needed to contain itself. As long as I remained on the rune, it slept. Every time I thought of stepping away, I felt it would wake.

I don’t remember how it ended.

I only know that my arm still burns sometimes. And that some choices are not meant to save us — they are meant to bind us. And that the old woman never gave me a gift.

She only found someone who wouldn’t know how to say no.
