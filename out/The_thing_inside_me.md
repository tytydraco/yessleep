"I am my own worst enemy."

I say it because it's supposed to mean something, right? But here I am, staring into a mirror, mouthing the words like they’re a mantra. Maybe if I say it enough, I’ll believe it. Maybe if I say it enough, I’ll stop waiting for the other me—the one inside, the thing that’s slithering around in my skin, biding its time.

I’m terrified of it. But worse, I’m terrified of me.

It’s the same face I’ve always had, but it feels too tight. Like the skin doesn’t fit. Or maybe it’s too loose? Maybe any second now, it’ll just fall away, and underneath, there will be—what exactly? I don’t even know anymore. I can't remember what it felt like to be alone in this body. I barely remember the sound of my own voice without the static that always buzzes in the back of my skull. Is it even my voice anymore? Or is it…ours?

There’s something in here with me. I don’t know what it is, but it’s older than anything I can imagine. Something bigger than death. It’s rotting me from the inside out, feeding on my thoughts, my memories, my fucking soul. I’ve tried ignoring it, telling myself it’s all in my head. But I feel it. Every second of every day.

I could end this. I could stop the monster. All it would take is one clean slice—knife, gun, hell, even a fall from a decent height would do the trick. I think about it constantly. Obsessively. But then I hear that voice—the one that isn't mine but feels like it could be. It says, “You’re stronger than that. You can fight this.”

But can I?

No one fights gods.

Hours, maybe days pass, and I don’t move from the mirror. My mouth keeps moving, keeps telling it that I won’t let it win. But the words sound thick now, like I’m choking on them. And my reflection? There’s something wrong with it. At first, I thought it was my mind playing tricks, but now I know. It’s watching me, not copying me. Sometimes it moves when I don’t. Sometimes I blink, and it doesn’t. I’m terrified to look away, but more terrified to keep staring.

The ghosts come again, but I’ve stopped paying attention to them. They used to creep up on me, their faces pale, their lips stitched shut with a kind of sad reverence. I wanted them to pull me away, drag me down into their world where I wouldn’t have to think anymore. But they never touch me. They’re afraid. Afraid of the thing inside me. They bow to it.

Not me. Never me.

They whisper things sometimes, things I can’t quite make out. Maybe it’s a warning. Maybe it’s just the wind. Either way, I’m left with their silence, and that’s the part that eats at me. Their fear. Their pity.

I hate it.

The thing inside me—it loves that. It’s hungry, I can feel it. The power, the destruction, the endless consumption waiting to happen. One day, when it’s strong enough, it’ll tear me apart from the inside. Burst through my flesh like some nightmare birth. When that happens, when it’s finally free, there’ll be nothing left. Not of me. Not of this world.

But right now, it’s still sleeping. Just barely. And I still have time. I tell myself that over and over again like it’ll stop the inevitable.

I look at the knife in the drawer. How long have I been staring at it? Minutes? Hours? Days? My hand itches to take it, to end this now. But the thing stirs again, a dark pulse under my skin, and suddenly I’m frozen. It wants me to hesitate. It wants me to doubt. I can feel its delight, its amusement. It’s so sure I won’t do it. So sure that I’m too much of a coward to end my life to save the rest of the world.

Maybe it’s right.

I laugh, and it sounds like I’m choking on glass. The reflection doesn’t laugh with me.

I look into the mirror again, into eyes that no longer feel like mine. I’m searching, desperately, for some proof that I’m still in here. But all I see is this hollow thing staring back. I wonder if it’s even me at all, or if I’ve already become the monster, and I’ve just been lying to myself this whole time. The thought gnaws at me until I’m sick with it, nausea roiling in my gut.

The ghosts start to bow again, lower this time. More of them than before, their forms barely human now, just silhouettes trembling under the weight of whatever they think I’ve become.

And then I realize—they know. They know it’s too late.

I’ve lost.

But I can still take it with me. I can still—end it. That’s the only control I have left.

The knife is in my hand before I even realize I’ve moved. Cold steel presses against my throat, and for the first time in so long, everything is clear. I press down, hard, and the pain is sharp, real. It feels like victory. The thing inside me screams, thrashes, but it’s too late. I can feel the blood pouring, hot and fast, and I know this is it.

“I am my own worst enemy,” I whisper, and I mean it this time.

The ghosts don’t bow anymore. They just fade away.

And so do I.
