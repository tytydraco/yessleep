I don’t have much time.

It started three days ago.

I was driving home late, exhausted, trying to keep my eyes open. Normally, I take the highway, but I was desperate to get home faster.

There was this old side road—one I’d never noticed before. It wasn’t on my GPS. No street signs. Just a dark, endless stretch of pavement cutting through the woods.

I turned onto it.

Biggest mistake of my life.

At first, it was just… quiet. Too quiet. No cars. No lights. Just the hum of my engine and the faint crackle of my radio.

Then, my headlights flickered.

The static on the radio got louder.

And then—

Everything blinked.

One second, it was midnight.

The next?

It was daytime.

I slammed on the brakes, my pulse hammering. The road looked different. The trees were smaller. The sky was a hazy, washed-out blue.

I grabbed my phone—no service.

The date on the screen? April 14, 1994.

I was thirty years in the past.

I didn’t understand what was happening. My brain refused to process it.

I needed help.

So I drove.

I followed the road until I reached a gas station. It looked old—like something out of a faded photograph. The prices on the sign were too low. The cars in the lot looked like they belonged in a museum.

I pulled up to the pump. A man in his thirties, wearing a uniform from a gas station that hadn’t existed in years, came out.

He gave me a weird look.

“You lost, kid?” he asked.

“Uh, yeah. I think so.”

He leaned in closer. “You know this road doesn’t lead anywhere anymore, right? You’re in the past.”

His voice made my stomach drop.

“What?” I said, thinking it was a joke.

“You didn’t see the sign? The one you passed a while ago?” he said, pointing back in the direction I came from. “This road was shut down in 1994. No one uses it now.”

I laughed nervously. “Okay, look, I don’t know what’s going on, but I need to get home.”

I didn’t wait for him to say anything else. I turned around and drove off, feeling more panicked with each passing second.

But the weirdest part?

The gas station wasn’t on the road anymore.

It had just… vanished. It was like it was never there. The pavement was completely different, like the past was fading right in front of me.

And then I felt it.

My hand started to feel… lighter. Like it was flickering.

I blinked and tried to shake it off.

I wasn’t imagining it.

By the time I got back to the highway, my car was shaking.

That’s when I saw it.

A version of me was driving ahead of me. Same car, same everything.

I honked the horn, but the version of me in front didn’t react.

I drove faster to catch up, but when I passed him, I noticed something that made my heart stop.

He wasn’t driving.

It was me. But not the me I knew. He looked… wrong. His face was a blur, like he was struggling to exist, like he was about to be erased.

I screamed. And that’s when the car—my car—slipped off the road, and everything went black.

I woke up in my own bed. My room was exactly how it was before. No more gas station. No more past.

But now, I’m fading. I can see my arm, my leg… everything slowly becoming see-through.

I can’t tell if this is the end, or if I’ve slipped into another part of the loop.

I don’t know if I’m going to fade away completely.

But I have to keep moving, keep writing. Before I’m nothing.
