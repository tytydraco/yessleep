This is a story about one of my friends  
(My english is not that great so , spellings may be wrong.)  


So she had just moved into the town just so that she could get some creative advances of his new book.She had heard that Jane Austen, his favourite author, would come to this town whenever she had a writers block. Her editor was pressuring her for a new chapter for weeks, but She could'nt write a single word in her lavish, comfortable home. She knew she needed some short of adventure to write again.   


Marren's Eve was a small town just by the river Aria. It was famous for its ancient marble fort called 'Venzer'. She knew this was just the place for her. So she booked the tickets and arrived in Marren's Eve on 4th October. The whole town was preparing for their annual Halloween fest. There were pumpkins everywhere!  


She had decided in the city itself that she would rent a home and not stay in the hotel as she wanted to mix with the people living there. She has found a beautiful, old rustic house just in the heart of the town. It was everything she looked in a home.  


"15, Ruthermyer Street please",she said to the taxi driver who was ashtonished to see such a huge luggage. No one visited Marren's Eve for more than two days, and so he was used to seeing people with only a carry on bag. Nonetheless, the driver took her to the house while she admired the beauty the town had to offer.  


 The house looked smaller in pictures, she tought. She opened the door and saw that it had'nt been cleaned for years. There was dust everywhere and old furniture moved to the side of rooms exposing the dark wooden flooring. There were old newspapers lying on the living room floor which dated back to 150 years before she was born. She then stepped into the hallway which led to the kitchen and to the garden. The kitchen was completely empty with glass crockery lying broken in the cabunets few broken on the ground.She had a bad feeling in her stomach as though her body was trying to tell her something was off about this place. She ignored it and went up the stairs which led to two rooms. The whole house had a cold rusty smell. As she stepped into the master bedroom she heard a creek from underneath the floorboards. With every step, the creaking got louder. Cobwebs lingered everywhere with yet another set of antique furniture convered with perfectly even dust. She saw a huge mirror where she could somewhat see her reflection beneath all the dust and cobwebs. She did not even dare to open the door next room painted the colour fo the walls as i someone was trying intentionally hide it. An uneasy feeling ran through her to that door. She wanted to explore it, the floorboards creeked again as she walked towards the attic door.  


She turned the rusty rusty-bronze latch and the door swang open. Old photographs were kept on the table but She ignored them as something more interesting had cought her eye. Damp sorrounded the room, suitcase were kept in the corner of the room, They were green and were kept in order of size. They looked like dominos. She went and opened the largest auitcase.  


She had grown up watching the show"Lost Cases" where anchors would go around buying and exploring lost suitcases. They would always find interesting items in them. She always wanted to do it as a child but somewhere along the line it stayed a suppressed dream for her. But now was her chance. The suitcase had beautiful leaf shape brass handles attached on the either side."Thud". The suitcase opened very easily and there lay Her treasure, She was eletade as, the first thing she saw was "Pride and Prejudice". Then lay a few other books which were classics since that time. In the corner of the suitcase was a dark brown book pressed flowers stuck on it. It was a leatherbound dairy. She took a chair and sat on it by the table.The first page of diary contained details, about the person who wrote the dairy.  


Her name was Clarice Kes and she lived in that exact house 150 years ago."Had the house not been opened since?" She thought. But she got to reading the dairy quickly. The next few pages described how there were strange evnts occuring in the house. Items were moving mysteriously, strange sounds were coming from rooms, her daughter was having fits, there were footmarks on the patio every night, lights were flickering all the time and there was a chilly atmosphere in the house. She felt scared but was more interesting in finishing the dairy, She read on about how Clarice was scared and had called everyone she knew to help but nobody did. She felt bad for the woman, but at the same time she was sitting in the attic where these paranormal activities happened. She glanced at her watch and i was 7:00pm. She had been here for two hours "Onyl few pages,then I'll leave and check into a nearby hotel", She said out loud. Her curiosity always trumphed over her other emotions. The final enteries of the dairy explained how Clarice acctually saw the ghost, She was shocked. Clarice started describing the ghost in great detail. It looked rush spikey spicky with fear, the pen seemingly, hard enough that the stains of ink pressed and blend into the pages surrounding it. It started,  
"She had blue eyes and peach coloued skin" Her red copper hair was parted in the middle and it puffed down to her eyes. She had elongated oval face and delicate features."  


"Wow! this woman, oh wait! ghost sounds a lot like me,"- Rune thought jokingly. But she read on every little detail was exactly how she looked. An elognated nose, small rosy lips, almond shaped eyes, faint blush on her cheeks "No, This can't be" She said out loud. She started furiously turning her pages. "How could this be?" she thought. She then read about her clothes. A floral red,yellow, and white skirt, on black fine cotton with plain black ruffled shirtm It was exactly what she was wearing. **"NO! NO! NO! NO!"** she screamed. "Somebody is playing a trick surely" she thought, She closed the bookand just when she was about to get up she saw some photographs again. But this time she paid attention.  


There in one photo was the whole family in the house and in the corner **WAS HER FACE**. She started picking up more pictures and in each one she was there. A faint  ghostly appearance in the pages she had seen in movies. Then sehg remembered the mirror in the master bedroom. She ran to that room. The wood beneath her feet was about to break but she didn't care. She found a a small napkin in the room and started cleaning the mirror frantically. After getting most of the dust out, she realished it wasn't a mirror but a portrait.
