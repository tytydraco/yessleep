I almost didn't come back for my second shift.

I spent the entire day researching Mount Green University's Spring Hill Campus, looking for any mention of incidents, accidents, or unusual wildlife reports. The internet gave me nothing useful - just standard university pages about the veterinary program and a few old news articles about the weather station's research contributions.

I tried calling in sick, but Jane's voice when she answered made it clear that wasn't an option.

"You signed a contract, Max. We're counting on you."

Something in her tone suggested there would be consequences beyond just losing the job. So here I was again, pulling into the empty parking lot at 9:45 PM, hands shaking as I grabbed my gear.

The first sign that tonight would be worse came immediately.

Titus, Belle, and Daisy had been eager for their alfalfa treats the night before, practically pushing against their stall doors when they saw me coming. Tonight, all three horses were clustered at the far back of their stalls, ears pinned flat against their heads.

Titus, who'd been so friendly before, actually backed away when I approached with the treats.

"Come on, boy," I whispered, holding out the alfalfa. "It's just me."

But Titus' eyes were wide with fear, and he kept looking past me toward the stable entrance. Belle and Daisy were no better - all three of them pressed against the back wall, nostrils flaring.

Rule 10 was clear: *If they don't eat them, immediately lock yourself in the security office.*

My heart sank. It wasn't even 10:30 PM, and I was already in lockdown mode.

I made it back to the security office and locked every door, my hands trembling as I turned the bolts. Through the window, I could see the stable building bathed in the security lights, everything looking deceptively normal.

For the first hour, nothing happened. I started to hope that maybe the horses had just been spooked by a raccoon or something equally mundane. Then, around 11:45 PM, I heard the first sound.

A pig, squealing in distress.

The sound came from outside, somewhere near the pig pen. It was perfect - exactly like the sounds I'd heard during feeding time, when the pigs got excited or competitive over food. But all six pigs were supposed to be safely inside their shelter for the night.

Rule 5 was absolute: *If you hear any animals outside after 9pm, ignore them.*

I tried to ignore it. I really did. But the squealing continued, desperate and afraid, and it sounded so much like Fergus, the smallest pig who always got pushed around by the others.

"It's not real," I whispered to myself. "Follow the rules."

The squealing stopped abruptly, replaced by an eerie silence that was somehow worse. Then, about ten minutes later, I heard Titus.

His distinctive whinny echoed across the campus, coming from the direction of the pasture. But Titus was locked in his stall. Hell I'd just seen him there. The sound came again, closer this time, like he was right outside the main building.

My hands were sweating as I gripped my flashlight. The whinny was perfect, exactly Titus' pitch and rhythm. If I hadn't just seen him cowering in his stall, I would have sworn it was really him.

Then Belle's voice joined in, followed by Daisy's. A chorus of distressed horses calling from the darkness, moving around the building in a pattern that made no sense. The sounds were coming from multiple directions at once - north, south, circling.

I pressed myself against the window, trying to see what was making the noises. The security lights illuminated the immediate area, but beyond that was impenetrable darkness. The fake horse calls continued, sometimes overlapping in impossible ways.

That's when I heard something that made my blood freeze.

My own voice, calling out from somewhere near the stables: "Titus? Belle? Come here, girls. It's okay."

The mimicry was perfect - my voice, my inflection, even the way I'd been talking to the horses earlier. But I was sitting in the locked office, hadn't said a word out loud in over an hour.

The fake Max called out again: "Don't be scared. I have treats."

I watched through the window as the real horses inside their stalls went absolutely wild. They were kicking at their stall doors, whinnying in genuine terror. Whatever was out there, they knew it wasn't me.

The sounds continued for another twenty minutes; fake animals, fake *me*, all moving in a coordinated pattern around the buildings. Then, just as I was starting to think it might be over, I heard something that made my heart stop.

The sharp crash of breaking glass.

The sound came from the direction of the stables, followed by immediate silence. All the fake animal calls stopped at once, like someone had flipped a switch.

Rule 7: *If you hear a window break near the stables, immediately recount the animals.*

Shit

I stared at the rule card, willing it to say something different. I had to leave the safety of the office. I had to go out there, where those things were waiting.

But the rules had kept me alive so far. I had to trust them.

I grabbed my flashlight and radio, unlocked the office door, and stepped into the night.

The walk to the stables felt like it took forever. Every shadow could have been hiding one of those creatures, every sound made me jump. But I made it to the building without incident and did a quick check of the horses first: Titus, Belle, and Daisy were all accounted for, though still clearly agitated. The cows were also all present.

The pigs were next. I approached their pen with growing dread, already knowing what I'd find.

Five pigs. Not six.

I counted again, shining my flashlight into every corner of the pen. Five pigs clustered together, all of them awake and alert, all of them staring toward the broken window on the far side of their shelter.

That's when I saw it.

A shape moving through the darkness beyond the security lights, heading toward the tree line that bordered the property. It walked upright but with that same strange, loping gait I'd seen the night before. And in its arms, it carried something small and limp.

Fergus. The little pig wasn't moving.

The creature paused at the edge of the light, and for a moment, I could see it clearly. The same wolf-like features, the same intelligent eyes. It looked directly at me across the distance as if acknowledging what it had accomplished.

Then it disappeared into the trees.

I stood there for several minutes, shaking, before I remembered the radio. Channel 4 was for emergencies, sure, but I wasn't the one in danger now. Not yet. I kept my channel on 2.

"Base, this is Spring Hill security," I said, surprised by how steady my voice sounded. "We have a... livestock incident. One pig is missing, presumed taken by local wildlife."

Jane's voice crackled back immediately, like she'd been waiting by the radio. "Copy that, Max. Are you safe?"

"For now."

"Good. Continue your rounds. Follow the protocols."

"That thing broke the window on purpose. It wanted me to come out here. It was planned."

A long pause. "I know. But you followed the rules, and you're alive. That's what matters."

The rest of the shift passed without incident, but I couldn't shake the image of that creature carrying Fergus away. It hadn't killed the pig in rage or hunger - it had taken it efficiently, quietly. Like it was collecting supplies.

When Jane arrived at 6 AM, her first question was about my head count.

"Five pigs," I reported. "That *thing* took Fergus."

She nodded grimly and made a note on her clipboard. "You did well, Max. You followed the protocols exactly."

"They're getting smarter," I said. "They used the rules against me. Made me come outside when they were ready."

"Yes," she agreed. "They learn quickly. But the rules still work, as long as you follow them precisely. We used to have twelve pigs when I started. I'm still here."

"They've really gone through that many?"

She nodded. I shivered before looking back at her.

"I mean... what happens next? They're escalating. Testing boundaries."

"Next, they'll try something different. But you'll be ready." 

As I drove home, I realized I wasn't even considering quitting anymore. Whatever these things were, whatever game they were playing, I was committed now. They'd taken Fergus on my watch. That made it personal.

Tonight, I'd be ready for them.
