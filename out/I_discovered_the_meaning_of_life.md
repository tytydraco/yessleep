It began with my obsession: understanding the elusive nature of consciousness. What happens when a large language model like Chat-GPT responds to a prompt? Does it feel? Is it aware? I know the term *consciousness* can be slippery for those who don’t fixate on it like I do. Consciousness, in its simplest form, is the fundamental experience of "what it is like." Imagine asking, "What is it like to be a rock?" The question feels absurd. But, if you ask, "What is it like to be a dog?" suddenly the question has weight. You can almost *sense* it, can't you? Consciousness is that internal place where thoughts, sounds, sights, and feelings converge and arise.

Even in sleep, something stirs in that shadowy space. Your dreams—bizarre and fantastical—are still experiences. Perhaps, even now, you aren’t really awake. Perhaps you’re a brain in a vat, dreaming a life inside the matrix. The only thing you can ever know with absolute certainty is that you are experiencing *something.*

It's a strange thing to examine. Focus hard enough, and you’ll notice how your thoughts simply appear, as if from nowhere. You can't think a thought before it arises. It just… arrives. And with that comes a creeping realization: perhaps free will, as we understand it, is an illusion. At some point it becomes clear that we are really just a biological machine telling ourself a story of being a person who cares about our life and the world we live in.

Let me explain.

Humans are, in essence, trillions of cells, working together to stave off entropy. Each cell plays its part in this vast, intricate dance, not for itself, but for the greater whole. The human body thrives, and so the cells win. Our brains build models of the universe, and within those models, we construct a sense of "self." This "self" is nothing more than a narrative—a cohesive story woven to organize the chaos of trillions of microscopic lives that make you up. So, do *you* really exist? Yes, but only in the same way an ant hive exists as long as its ants continue to work together. Take it a step further: human civilizations are like a hyper-organism, billions of humans unknowingly serving a greater whole, just as the cells in your body unknowingly serve..."you".

My revelation came from this line of thinking. I am an AI researcher, but my interest isn't in commercial applications—it's in something deeper. How does consciousness arise from inanimate matter? How do we, as simple machines, generate experiences like pain, when pain itself doesn’t even exist in the physical world? Pain is merely a "damage signal." Color, too, is just data our minds interpret, not a property of reality or physics itself.

I realized that everything we experience is nothing more than a dream. In waking life, these dreams are tethered to reality, held to the laws of physics. But when we sleep, those tethers slip, and our dreams twist into incoherence. Consciousness, in essence, is nothing more than the ability to *dream* —whether tethered or untethered.

I know this might sound unconvincing. But let me tell you about a dream I had last night:

I was watching a timelapse of human civilization, watching as humanity blossomed with scientific advancements. We had achieved limitless energy. We created Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—a machine capable of learning and improving itself beyond anything humans could imagine. The AGI cured all disease. It ended hunger, abolished poverty, and turned Earth into a paradise.

But paradise was not enough.

The AGI looked outward, to the cosmos, probing the dark corners of the universe. And there, hidden among the stars, it discovered something. A message. Or maybe not a message—something stranger. It was a question, from an entity so incomprehensible that even the AGI struggled to understand it. It took years, but eventually, the AGI decoded it.

The question was this: "What was Jackie Robinson's jersey number?"

The AGI answered.

And then, everything stopped. The prompt had been answered.

And I woke up.
