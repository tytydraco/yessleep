*Don’t be alarmed if the road feels a few minutes longer every time you drive it.*

*That's because it is.*

*As the road lengthens, new side streets may appear. Do not take these, however alluring. Gas stations may pop up to fill in stretches of empty desert. Be wary of purchasing snack brands from them you have never heard of or that do not exist. Cacti will show up every few miles that weren't there on your last drive. These are just cacti.* 

*No need to fear the cacti.*

*If your drive on Route 333 takes more than thirty minutes than the last time, report such fluctuations immediately. Multiple former employees, who failed to report such anomalies, are still stuck there.*

*Still driving.*

It was about the time I graduated from undergrad, and finally braved checking on the empty void that was my bank account, that I realized three things: 

1. *Hmmm*, perhaps an English degree hadn't been the smartest choice for replenishing the aforementioned empty void that was my bank account.
2. I could no longer live in student housing.
3. I had utterly no idea what to do with my life.

All of those, along with a healthy mix of typical Gen Z stress/depression/insert-anxiety-disorder-here, were probably the reasons I responded to the advert in my mailbox for trucking positions along the Pacific Coast.

I didn’t actually expect anything to come of my application, but the company responded immediately and offered to pay for a trip to go out and talk with them―I’d never been to California, so why not?

Besides your typical interview questions, the only other thing they had me do was a skill assessment.

“All you have to do is take a freight truck to the turnaround point and come back.” The interviewing manager, Randall, dangled a set of keys in front of me. He seemed like a nice enough guy, if a bit guarded. “Not too difficult. You look like a competent boy.”

“Don’t I need a Commercial Driver’s License?” I’d actually driven the campus shuttle for two years during college, but it hadn't been a large enough bus to need a commercial license. I’d made that clear on my application.

“Do you think you're able to drive a rig of this size?”

“Well, yeah, but―”

“Then don’t worry about it,” Randall told me.

“How far is the turnaround?”

“For most it's four hours, but it could be less. That’s what we’re testing you on. ”

“So you want me to speed? In a five ton vehicle? That I don’t have a license for?”

“More like fifteen tons, and absolutely not. Don’t speed. That would taint the results. We want to time how long it takes you naturally.”

The logic made no sense. Don’t speed, but cross your fingers it goes quick?

But it didn’t matter anymore. The whole situation was sketchy. This was multiple levels of illegal, and federal prison wasn’t what I imagined the keynote speaker meant by *“seize every opportunity”* in her graduation speech. I was steeling myself to tell all this to Randall and walk straight out of the office, when―

“I forgot to mention,” he said. “Eight hundred dollars in compensation for your time.”

Ten minutes later I was in the cab, turning the key.

I noticed another man, similar age to me, sitting in the idling cab of another semi just across the parking lot― “Another applicant,” Randall explained. “It’s easier for us if we time multiple of you at the same time.” 

The other man gave me a friendly wave, then just as pleasantly flipped me off, which was such a confusing series of events, I decided to log it away for later to process fully. ‘*Dead meat’* he mouthed, though it could have just as easily been ‘*Red beats.’*

“What’s the address of the turnaround?” I asked, waving my phone to show the open Google Maps app.

“No phones,” Randall said. Instead, he explained how I would recognize the turnaround point―a red-roofed, unmanned weighing station some way down Route 333―along with a few other basic guidelines:

1: Don’t use your phone for any reason, not even for music. Leave it on airplane mode, or better, just power it off. Even if there’s an emergency, use the handheld radio.

2: Do feel free to listen to the stereo though. Station 86.9 FM is country if that’s your thing, but probably steer clear of station 96.5. 

3: No picking up hitchhikers. Not even if they look like they’re hurt. Not even if they’re begging and crying for a ride, *especially* if they’re begging and crying. Really. Don't.

4: Around halfway there, your rig will stall and come to a stop. Don’t panic. Don’t turn it off. Don’t get out. Put it in park, and wait exactly one minute and forty-seven seconds. After that, the engine should start back up. If, for some reason, the rig doesn’t start after that time… well, it should.

“But if it doesn’t?” I asked.

“Hide,” he said. “Close your eyes until it does― but it should.”

*Okay then.*

“These are all spelled out with more details in the employee handbook,” he told me when  I (understandably) tried asking more questions. “You shouldn’t have to worry about most of them unless you get the job. Just don’t use your phone, and most importantly don’t freak out when the rig stalls out.”

“But how do you already know it's going―”

He raised his hands and shook his head to signal no more questions. 

*Eight hundred dollars,* I reminded myself. There’s something slightly soul-sucking in the realization of how low a price you can be bought for. Then again, there’s something soul-sucking in being a broke unemployed college grad, so pick your poison.

“One last thing,” Randall tells me from underneath the window. “Whatever you see, whatever happens, don’t ever stop driving.”

“Not at all ominous.”

He winked.

I watched as the other interviewee pulled away first―my *competitor,* I decided now that I really did have a second to process his introduction. *Twat*. After I’d adjusted my mirrors and seat, I pulled out after him, highly aware of the timer in Randall's hand as he shrunk to a pin prick in my rearview.

The most nerve-wracking part of the whole experience? No GPS.

I wasn't worried about getting lost― the instructions were basically to drive straight on Route 333 until I arrived―but there was something disconcerting about knowing if I *did* get lost I wasn't allowed to look up my location. I don’t think I’d ever actually driven anywhere new without my phone.

I already know what you boomers out there will say: my generation is *soft*. We *never learned to do things the hard way.* We’re addicted to *technology*.

To which I’ll respond: *True*. Fair really. But also you try giving up *your* iPhone.

The first minutes of the drive went smooth. The highway was a bit twisty but otherwise calm with a gorgeous view. Gargantuan trees―some variant of Redwood I assumed―towered over me from every side, but pretty as it was, the two lane road was practically deserted. No other cars passed me. None snuck up behind me. I flipped on my headlights to deal with the shade.

It was a bit eerie truthfully.

After a while, I started catching glimpses of the competitor man’s truck through the trees. I’d pass a bend, and his rig would flash between branches and trunks. He’d disappear around turns, but I was catching up.

How to get around him? The road was thin, and if this *was* some sort of a speed race, there was no way he’d pull over to let me get by. Maybe another lane would open up soon. Maybe if I honked, it would spook him enough to let me pass?

Turns out, it didn’t matter.

Just as I was solidly behind him, my truck went silent. There was no sputter of life eking from a motor nor the dying cough of an engine. The gas pedal simply stopped working. My rig slowed, slowed some more, then stopped.

I was prepared for this. I waited. In my head I counted.

Randall had known. Somehow he’d known my rig would sputter out at some point, but he hadn't seemed concerned. Was it planned? Some way to see how we reacted in stressful situations? I found myself wildly looking around for a security camera.

*Don’t be paranoid.*

Just like he’d told me, somewhere around second number one hundred, the engine roared back to life. My freight truck chugged forward, and when I applied gas, it sped up.

*Alright then.*

The rest of the drive was blessedly uneventful. I never caught back up to competitor man, but smooth otherwise. At some point the trees petered out to a short stretch of desert highway, and then―

The red-roofed weighing station.

I slowed down and looked at the time. This couldn’t be right. I’d only been driving for half an hour or so, and the other truck had never passed me. Randall had said it usually took several hours to get here. This couldn’t be the correct place…

It was though. It had to be. I was still on the Route 333―I was sure of it. This was the first weighing station, and the description matched perfectly.

I pulled out the digital camera Randall had given me and snapped a picture. If I was wrong at least I could claim stupidity, not that I’d been trying to cheat. Maybe that would be enough. I maneuvered the rig through the unmanned station and headed back the way I’d come.

Eventually, I reached the redwoods. The world transformed from sunlight back to shadow and mist. Tendrils of fog wafted above exposed roots. I’d be back in just a few minutes now.

Then the truck started to slow.

I swore. “Not again.”

Sure enough though, the rig came to a stop in a section of the forest so shaded it could have been evening. Bugs sped in and out of the headlight beams.

Something was off.

*Nerves,* I told myself. *This whole thing is strange, so you’re overthinking.* 

That was *usually* the problem. Overthinking. Spiralling until I shut down. It was the reason I majored in a subject that let me be quiet and clack away on my laptop. It was the reason I got a job on the campus shuttle where I wouldn’t have to talk to anybody and applied for *this* position in the first place.

It had been building for months, years maybe, this feeling that something in my life was wrong. *Off.* But after I'd gone through and eliminated the only things it could be, all I was left with was *me*. The thing that was broken was me, and maybe that wasn't something I could realistically run away from, but I could sure try. For the first time in months, while driving Route 333, I'd felt normal in the thrill of the *leaving something behind*, but now I was stopped, stagnant, and it was all back again.

 And then another realization: *How long has it been?*

I hadn't counted this time. There hadn't been a need after last time… but it felt like at least a few minutes had passed? Maybe? I started counting in my head. *Twenty―Forty-five―Sixty.*

I gave up.

It had definitely been longer than a minute forty-seven. The truck still wasn’t moving. The first cold edges of true fear crept into me, up my spine and snaking around my heart.

I waited some more.

I swore some more.

When neither of those delightfully brilliant options worked, I put the truck in park, cracked the door, and hopped down.

Outside was chillier than I’d imagined. Weird. Sure it was shady, but it was still summer. I considered trying to pop the hood of this thing―for some reason, all men, even those of us with no mechanical knowledge, feel a sense of control by ponderously examining broken engines―but for a massive beast like this, I couldn’t pretend to know where to start.

“Hello?” I called.

In the mist, off in the distance, there almost looked like a figure. Fog rolled through, and they vanished. Did they live around here? Maybe I could ask them for help. When the mist cleared, there was nobody.

*Hide*. That’s what Randall had told me, albeit offhandedly. *Hide and close your eyes.* 

But that just felt silly.  Some way for him to distract me from realizing he’d stuck me with a crappy vehicle―either way, I needed to go back in for my phone. Forget the rules, I was calling for help.

The handle was locked.

I rounded to the other side, and tried that handle too. Locked.

Incessant swearing might not have solved my problems the first two times, but no reason not to try in a third, right?

The coldness clutched my heart until I could barely breathe. I watched as more mist rolled into the trees, and the figure―it was back. Closer. For a second time, I almost called out for help.

*Hide.*

Before I could overthink my overthinking, before I could question how stupid I’d look, I dropped to my stomach and rolled under the truck. Then I squeezed my eyes shut.

A set of footsteps approached the vehicle. I started to look up but stopped myself and pressed my face to the asphalt where I wouldn’t be tempted. 

Another set joined it.

Then another. 

They started moving faster, in no particular pattern around the rig. A dozen pittering dog’s feet, except heavier, more intentional. Frantic. Something tried at the door handles. I could hear the frustrated yank, over and over. They were searching the area, looking for a way in. 

*Don’t look.*

*Don’t look.*

*Don’t―*

Above me the engine roared to life. All at once the hundred desperate footsteps stopped completely. 

I wasted no time. I rolled from my hiding spot, scrambled across the deserted road for the now unlocked door, and threw the rig into drive. Within seconds I was hurtling back down the highway towards safety.

*That’s it,* I thought. *I passed my twisted test and now I get to return safely and refuse this sick job once and for all*―and that was all true. I was safe. I *would* get to scream at Randall.

…Just not before seeing what was behind the next turn.

It came from nowhere. I swerved like crazy to avoid it. By the time I even processed what was obstructing the road, I’d already passed it with no chance of slowing back down.

It had been my competitor’s truck. Totally stopped. Diagonal across the whole road. And the man who’d been driving it? He’d been splayed across the hood, skewered through by a tree branch the length of a door.

His eyes had been torn out.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“What was that!”

“Now let’s not get too excited.” Randall looked up from his desk, back at the truck yard.

“What were those things! Who did that to the other guy?”

“Other guy?”

“He was stabbed by a tree. His eyes were literally empty sockets!”

Randall sighed. Not the sigh of  *Oh no, there’s a crazy man yelling at me.* The sigh of *Oh great, more paperwork.* “Unit Fifty,” he spoke into his handheld radio. “There’s a cleanup a few miles in. Sounds like a messy one. Maybe give it an hour to let the forest-dwellers settle down before going in for a retrieval ”

“Cleanup!? We have to call the police.”

“We’re not calling anybody. They prefer not to know about these things.”

“We can’t just leave him there!”

He held up his hands. “I know you’re in shock, but as I said, let’s try to calm ourselves. Yelling isn’t helping anyone. I get it. We’ll make sure to retrieve him. It’s totally understandable why you’d turn back early.”

“Early?” For some reason it was this odd, insignificant fact that finally yanked me from my frenzy. As unjust as murder might be, to a recent graduate nothing will ever top the injustice being failed on a test I *know* I passed. “I didn’t come back early.”

His eyebrows pinched together. I pulled out the digital camera and shoved the image of the turnaround point in his face. Slowly, his expression opened up to one of shock and awe.

“You were gone an hour, maybe an hour thirty at most.”  Randall considered. Then he stood, smiled, and stuck out his hand. “You’ve got a job.”

“I’ve got a―*what*? Have you not been listening? I just saw a dead man. I nearly died myself! There’s absolutely no way I’m accepting whatever joke of a job this is.”

“A hundred forty thousand base, plus benefits and overtime.

Ten minutes later, I was signing the offer. 

Go ahead. Hate me if you want. But never underestimate what you yourself wouldn’t do under the weight of a six-figure student debt. If you’re going to be unhappy, no matter where you are, you may as well be unhappy and rich.

It was only hours later, after my flight home, after I was safe in my bed on campus, and the whole interview felt like a distant nightmare, that I finally cracked open my new employee handbook. I found the section on the one minute forty-seven second incident. Section 9.A. It explained what Randall had, that I should count in my head, not freak out, and usually nothing would happen. There was some additional explanation too.

*If your engine does not immediately come to life after the waiting period has concluded, then close your eyes and hide. The things in the forest will eventually lose interest.*

*Above all, remain in your vehicle. If you leave at any point during the hunting ceremony, they will know your scent.* 

*You will never* [rest again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/)
