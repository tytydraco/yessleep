Okay, so first and foremost, this story didn't actually occur in our neighborhood, but the idea was born there. And it didn't happen far from there at all, just outside of town, and I lived right at the edge of town. This happened to me and some of my closest friends, along with my girlfriend at the time, and one of our friends' younger brothers.

&#x200B;

We, like a lot of young and adventurous people, had decided to go, "Ghost Hunting", in and around our town. It started out with an abandoned house in our neighborhood, and moved on to the woods near by my home. We went to a bridge everyone had called the, "Cry Baby Bridge", sort of a local urban legend. I've heard of a bridge like this being found in many towns around the country. We went to an abandoned battery factory, one of my friends was actually seriously hurt in there. But nothing, as spooky as the locations always were, ever really happened to us. That is until we found this abandoned farm house.

&#x200B;

I wish I could show you a photo of this place, but back then everyone wasn't carrying around phones and recording every moment in life. Across from the property was a set of three silos, also in disrepair. And as night fell on them, they were like something from a Stephen King novel or something like that. They were so creepy, and absolutely huge, ominous, and always covered in a murder of crows. The birds were always so loud and obnoxious.

&#x200B;

The farm house and the property itself, I will attempt to describe in as much detail as I possibly can. It was like something out of a, "Hills Have Eyes", type of film. The largest structure was the closest to the old county road that brought you there. The grass and fields surrounding the place were all overgrown and un cared for. The largest building was like an oversized barn of sorts. It housed an enormous piece of machinery, that must of cost a mint when it was bought originally. But like everything else it had been abandoned and left to rust away.

&#x200B;

The piece of machinery was absolutely terrifying in its own right. It was huge, and rusted, and it just looked like a viscous piece of machinery, it had massive blades all along the front of it kind of anyways. If it were coming toward you and operational, it would chew you up into spaghetti sauce for sure. And that barn just came with a bad feeling altogether.

&#x200B;

Behind the main structures, on the backside of the property, we found five large shipping containers. Like the ones you see on trains. They were all unlocked and rusted open, but the creepy thing about them, was that they appeared to be completely full of peoples personal belongings. We found a dozen different I.D.'s, from several surrounding states. There was everything from little kids' bikes, to an actual automobile of some kind in the back of one. It was almost destroyed from the amount of time it had sat in there I imagine, but odd in a way that it was there at all.

&#x200B;

But nothing compared to the farm house itself, and I mean nothing. With every ounce of my soul I am telling you this place was just the creepiest. The front entrance of the house was made to look like an entrance to a church, more so than one to a farm house. It even had stained glass windows, like the one's you would find in a church or similar structure. As you made your way through the front door, that was knocked off one of its hinges and leaning a bit. You could see through the house from there to the back, but immediately to your left and your right were two doors.

&#x200B;

On your right, a door there led into what appeared to at one time to have been a bedroom maybe. A lot of old personal items were strewn about, and an awful smelling sleeping bag was bundled up in the corner like a mat or nest of sorts. And the door to your immediate left was a door that once led down to the basement or cellar, and every time we went to this place we would kick this door open. Every time we returned it was closed again. Long before we ever started to come to this place, the stairs to the basement had gone, making it so that this door just led to a twelve foot drop into a dirt cellar. You could get down there through an opening on the side of the house, but there wasn't much down there. It was just a hand dug basement space or cellar that basically just existed as a sort of dirt pit under the house.

&#x200B;

As you made your way past these two doors you were led into a large open area, I would assume was at one time a family room maybe I'm not sure. Just ahead another door, and yet another on your left again. That door on your left, the second on your left from entering through the front door. Led into what seemed to be another bedroom at first glance, we later found it to be more than that actually. The doorway straight ahead in the back of the house, led into a rectangular room, that terrifyingly had an old well in the center of it, and this room led to the back door as well. The old rock well in the center of this room, jumped right out of that movie, "The Ring", for sure, that is exactly what it looked like, no exaggeration at all.

&#x200B;

Now this house was a two story house, and we noticed there was no way in the lower floor to get to the upper floor. So after some serious looking and investigating over several trips out there, we found it. In that second room to your left, that I had mentioned was more than just a bedroom, ended up having the access to the stairs leading up in it. The strange thing about it is, we only discovered this by looking through a hole in the back of the wall. Someone had completely drywalled it off and concealed the stairs completely. After tearing down the drywall and turning to look at the stairs, it was obvious that the stairs themselves had been cut away half way up. And at the base of where they were cut off they had built another wall of studs and drywall. This one was already falling apart for whatever reason, bad workmanship maybe, but the stairs were clearly visible.

&#x200B;

We cleared and knocked down the rest of what remained of that wall that had been built, and crawled up onto what remained of this staircase, and proceeded up them to the top floor. It was grossly apparent that someone had gone to great lengths and a lot of effort to conceal those stairs and the access to the second story. At the top of the stairs was a door. Through that door was a small landing area, that had a door on your left, on your right, and a third directly in front of you. The door in front of you was always open, and the wall in the back of the room it led into had a massive window covered in tarping. It was always whipping in the wind and making the experience that much more unnerving and scary.

&#x200B;

The weirdest thing were the two rooms on either side, they were identical bedrooms or whatever, but inside them, on the side walls, were these tiny knee high doors. And when we looked into them it was unfinished rooms of sorts, small spaces that just had rafters and insulation for floors. But in between the rafters were a couple small child or baby sized mattresses laid down between them. Kids toys and things, old clothing, was strewn about in there, and those tiny rooms, with their tiny doors just seemed to exude an ominous feeling. And in the room on the left, on the ceiling were three rust colored stains. In that landing area was a small square access hole in the ceiling to the attic space.

&#x200B;

On one of our trips we had been curious enough about the stains up there to convince my brother to let me hoist him up so he could look around up there. According to him it was dirty up there and mostly empty. But he said in the general direction of those stains, one large like the size of an adult, the other two child sized stains, were a group of large black trash bags. That was a big load of nope right there.

&#x200B;

Now that I have described this property to you the best I can, I will tell you the rest of our story. On our last trip out there it had been discussed on our way out there, how we all sort of shared the same thought or mental imagery. That when you pulled into the overgrown area in front of this house, as you were about to turn off your vehicle, we all felt the same thing, and had the same thoughts. That when you cut your lights back on upon leaving that there would be a horrible terrifying girl standing their as your headlights came on. Though to my knowledge no one ever actually saw that, it was just something we shared.

&#x200B;

There was an accompanying story with the property itself that we had stumbled upon. That the farmer that owned this property and the one across the road, had killed his wife and children, and then hanged himself in the barn. We don't know if this was a true story or just a fable shared amongst people who had stumbled onto this property.

&#x200B;

Anyways, for the really scary part for the bunch of us, on this last trip to the farmhouse. We had been their a dozen times by this point, and taken many of our friends and relatives out there. Basically as just a fun scary sort of adventure. Now we had been warned by many older folks around town to stay away and off that old property, but we never listened, maybe we should have.

&#x200B;

On this occasion all seemed to be as it always was, until I made my way through the doorway to that well room in the back of the house. I was next to last to come through that doorway, and for some reason I had the strange feeling to step aside and put my back to the wall. And so I did just that, I trust in my senses when they tell me things. As my friends little brother made his way through the doorway and into the room, I swear to God, a mist or something, in the shape of a outline of him, followed him through that doorway. I tried to shake it off as a trick of the lights we were carrying, or just my mind playing games with me.

&#x200B;

That's when an ear-piercing scream, female voice, absolutely blood curdling, and with all the feeling of a woman being butchered split through the air and tore through the house. If you could imagine, through the cold night air, through the silent creepy farmhouse, the seven of us that were there, hearing a baby girl dropped into an oversized blender, or hearing a woman screaming after finding her children murdered. We shot out of any and every opening to the outside that we were closest to. And we all ran to the car on legs that carried us with inhuman speed, the adrenaline carried us with conviction to get the hell out of there.

&#x200B;

And believe me when I tell you I was absolutely terrified to turn on my headlights after that scream. But I did, and no there wasn't a creepy girl from, "The Ring", standing there in the light of my low beams. But there didn't need to be for me to want to get the hell out of there in record speed. And after that none of us ever went back to that damn farmhouse.

&#x200B;

A few months later we had read in the local newspaper that local law enforcement had put together a, Tri-County Taskforce, and that they were going to be using that exact property to practice raids and things like that. A week or two later it was absolutely demolished, bulldozed over and gone. I don't know what those law enforcement personnel found out there that we never did, or what they encountered out there. But whatever the hell it was, it scared them enough to raise the entire property down to the ground. I wish I knew more about that, I have always wondered. Their were never any other storied about it in the papers, and no one ever heard anything else about it. But for us, it was one of the most terrifying things we ever experienced, and I'm still glad that we all got out of there in one piece. Sometimes I think a few of us saw some things that we won't even discuss even to this day, its just a feeling, based on the way some of us act when it's brought up from time to time.

&#x200B;

Stay the hell out of scary old farmhouses that have creepy scary backstories, less you want to run into something you may not be equipped to deal with when you do. I pray you use caution, whilst your out there, wherever you may be, in the darkness, hunting for those things that go bump in the night..
