Hi, this is my first post, I was wondering whether to post this or not.



I live with my parents, my aunt, and my cousin. My cousin and aunt's room is right across from mine, but my cousin's room is next to a still-non-working bathroom that we use as storage. Everything was quiet until about four months ago, when I started hearing strange noises in my cousin's room. They were sounds similar to someone rummaging through drawers, but the most disturbing thing was that it always happened with the lights off.



The first time I heard it, I was home alone. I stood still for a few seconds, trying to convince myself it was my imagination. But the noises continued. With my heart racing, I walked to her door and, working up the courage, opened it. The room was dark and empty. No one was there. I immediately closed the door and went back to my room, feeling a chill run down my spine and goosebumps.



When my cousin returned, I told her what had happened. She just looked at me like I was completely crazy and said, “You’re delusional.” Her response made me feel stupid, so I decided not to give it any importance. However, the noises continued, especially when no one else was home. No matter how hard I tried to ignore them, every time I heard them, a cold, anxious feeling would take over me.



Eventually, the noises went away and I came to think it had all been a product of my mind. But yesterday something happened that made me rethink everything. I was in the living room watching TV with my sister when I remembered that I needed to make my bed, so I went up to my room. When I got to the hallway, I noticed that the light in my cousin’s room was on and, again, the same noises could be heard. Thinking that she had come home early, I spoke to her through the door, asking how she had been. Her response was curt: “Fine.”



I found her tone strange, but I didn’t think about it any further. I walked into my room, made my bed, and upon exiting, noticed that the light in her room was now off. The odd thing was that I didn't see her walk down the hall to the stairs, and my room has a window from which I can see if anyone goes up or down. I thought maybe I just hadn't been paying attention. I assumed she had gone to sleep and went down to the living room with my sister.



A few minutes later, we heard the front door open. My cousin had just arrived. I actually felt a chill run through my body when she said, "Hey girls, what are you doing?" I stared at her, my expression horrified. "Did you just get here?" I asked her, my voice shaking.

She looked at me with the same look on her face as the first time I told her about the noises in her room and replied, with obvious obviousness, "Obviously I just got here."



My mind went blank. If my cousin hadn't been in her room, then... who was up there?
