I’m going to say this upfront, this is the first time I’m telling this story. I never wanted to bring this up with any of my family and friends, and while it may be because I think they would never believe me, I never want to think about this again in my life. But now I have no choice, and I’m just tired of it all, and I can’t figure out why this happened. I just need this to end before something bad happens.

This started when I was working full-time at a restaurant. Growing up in New York City, New York, I’ve got used to many different people daily. And I mean any type of person you could think of. Whatever you can think of has come and gone and I could deal with it, but that also makes things harder since I’m the “backbone” and had me working more than the rest since I was the “most reliable” despite working the same wage. Anyways, on one of the late-night shifts, my best friend Adrian had shown up with another person with him - my girlfriend. He had always been a brother to me and we’ve gone through it all to stay together. He’s got a new girlfriend while I’m currently seeing someone as well. That night I saw him and my girl paying a visit to my work to mess with me while I was scrubbing a table that had puke on it.

“Yo,” Adrian called me out. “Ya girl was thinking of hosting a little house party.”

“Can’t you tell me after work?”

“Well that’s the thing, we’re all going tonight.”

“Don’t you see I’m already dealing with enough? Wait, and ya’ll going now? It’s gonna be late by the time I clock out. I also gotta pack since you’re nice enough to tell me last minute.”

“Sorry, it was last minute,” my girl said. I immediately smiled at her gently after wishing Adrian get hit by a car and I laughed in the background. “My dad’s friend was thinking of demolishing the place, but I asked them if we could use it for a get-together. I’m bringing all my friends. It’s so nice, it has a giant backyard pool and a game room! We are all bringing board games and drinks. It’s gonna be a four-day thing!” She said with a beaming smile I couldn’t get enough.

Adrian laughed. “Yeah, I just had to come.”

As I was polishing the table, I looked at the clock. It was 5 minutes before 11 PM, and they were going tonight they said.

Wait… Tonight? It was that thought that kicked in for me. And if I had to say, it was the point where things started going downhill from there.

I never had a gut feeling this strong and sinister, like my senses were shooting up through the roof. It was unnerving because this was supposed be to the greatest idea ever. Working hard and then having several shots at a luxurious place with my crush and best friend? I couldn’t leave the offer, which makes this feeling all too difficult.

And looking back at it, I wish I listened to my fatigue, but even then, I wouldn’t know what would’ve happened to me.

“Alright, sure. Listen I need to get back to work, but I’ll see ya… Where’s it at?”

They told me to take the subway because it was practically across the state. Now I was annoyed at this stupid dilemma to end my night but what I’m about to mention is something I never understand why, it all went downhill from there.

There was a man that was sitting behind me the entire time. He was finishing up his plate taken by my coworker and drank his water as we glanced at each other. He looked to be in his twenties. He had jet-black hair that was slicked back with some shiny gel and a slim but sturdy tanned face. He was wearing something very elegant, like a tuxedo with a draping coat. He looked lean and fit as well with some of the straightest posture I’ve ever seen. This dude did not look like he belonged in a restaurant where some kids would run around like it’s a requirement here, but again, it’s New York. He may as well be a model, a perfect cast for a superhero movie, or some shit.

“The trains are empty as of now. Vacant to not a single soul for peace. It'll do your world good.” All of us turned when he spoke. I don’t know about everyone else, but I felt a sudden hit of sadness. Almost like I was hit with a sense of impending doom and I just realized I could never escape. I never experienced anything like this, so I had no idea what was going on. He continued. “Have you ever traveled all the way there? To that specific area? I reckon you all bid caution.”

The two were silenced since they were very confused.

“Look, man, I appreciate your concern, but we’re sort of busy right now.” I tried to keep an act just to make things easier, but I wish I could’ve handled that better because I could’ve sworn his eyes turned darker and he made a slight frown. It was like he watched me with eyes like a wolf or something, ready to kill me. I felt trapped.

“I’ll leave you alone to do whatever you want. But, a word of advice you should listen. Very carefully, that is.” He stood up, his eyes didn’t move anywhere else. “Take that vacation before you break in ways you never knew you could. It’s always the ignorant that dies the easiest. Don’t make that day earlier than it should be, although some due dates are well deserved. Who knows, really? It’s the numbers that always speak, then the cattle that struggles. The bloodshed is not all what you think. Idiot.” He paid for his meal and left, the three of us were stuck in this weird situation of what to think.

“What the fuck was that?” Adrian said. “Anyways, look, we’re all gonna head there. Hey, you’re alright?” 

I nodded and told them I needed to get back to work. They hesitantly left, but everything got weirder when my manager came by after they left. For context, she had to be the best manager I knew so far. She wasn’t on the nose with everything and was helping other people to do their jobs. And while she had arguments with other managers and employees before, she never did anything against them. She even gave me the day off so I could be on a date with someone who’d eventually be my crush. I’m going to miss her once I move on with something else.

This was the first time I saw her face pale.

“You know him?” She almost stuttered. If someone who was the most collected person in this group reacted to the man like this, you can tell how things were going down from there.

“I don’t know, and I don’t wanna talk about it,” I said. I just wanted to go to the house and enjoy my time off.

“You can clock out right now. Please be safe.” She said. But our last words still stuck with me if I had to think about her. “That man’s been coming here every day for a while now, you didn’t notice him?”

“I never seen him before? This was the first time-”

“He called your full name this morning when he sat at that same spot. I think he wanted to talk.”

I left promptly without further talking about it. My mouth felt dry, my head was spinning, and I thought I was gonna vomit. I swear to you that I’ve never seen that man, nor heard of him call my full name, which only a few would know anyway. Sure, I may not be aware of my surroundings, especially if I’m working - people aren’t my main concern when it comes with getting paid to do a job, but I could definitely remember something as strange as him. It took me a while once I calmed down out of the restaurant to understand what situation I was in.

Go home and rest it off, or forget it all and deal with the worst hangover I could think of. I’ll be honest, I wouldn’t know what to do if I went home. Would that man be waiting for me? What did he want? What did I do that pissed him off? In haste, I decided it was best just to take the subway. My mind was not feeling right. I thought once I get there I could pay for some clothes over there. There should be some thrift store nearby, right?

Walking alone at night was the most unsettling thing I could ever put myself through because of that man but at the time, I think I was thrown so off that my logic was rattled. I ended up finding myself at the subway entrance, going downstairs slowly, holding onto that guard rail like I was waiting for something to jump behind me, I felt like I was paranoid as hell. Reasoning with my fight or flight state wouldn’t make things better, so I followed with my plan and at least had my guard up. 11 PM in New York is a gamble on its own, but I couldn’t tell what’s wrong or right. When I made it down to the bottom of the steps, I pulled my shirt to hover over my nose when I smelled the worst thing possible. At that moment, I couldn’t take it anymore, and I threw up to the side.

I made my way straight to the subway after puking my guts. I was completely lost, confused, and extremely scared. My senses were almost gone and I was left with choices I could barely make on my own. Everything in my peripherals was a blur since I had the most intense tunnel vision ever.

Just as I was powerwalking, for less than a minute, I heard a loud bang from behind. It didn’t sound like a gun, but like a large object hitting the wall or something. It sounded distant, but I froze, staring at the floor. I heard some voices in front of me like they were in the deepest part of a hallway. From what I remembered, they all sounded like guys, but the weirdest part was that they sounded the same. It was as if someone was talking at different pitches with the same voice as an experienced voice actor would do. But I think what made me terrified of the dangers was that the same type of voice from different people came from the guy from the restaurant. One of them had a raspy and loud tone that was yelling in anger. The other had a more high-pitched tone, sounding apologetic while the raspy voice yelled at him. Were there two different people that sounded like one by coincidence? Then, it sounded like they walked away while still yelling at each other, and I stood in place for a while, waiting. After a moment of silence, I told myself I was just imagining things and it appeared real because I was scared and sick. Maybe I ate something bad in the breakroom fridge or I didn’t heat my food properly. I thought of all possible reasons why I felt like the world didn’t feel real.

I slowed down, and as my breath stabilized, my thoughts began to become more organized. I walked slower, leaning against the wall in case some came up, watching every item to use for escape, cover, and even defense. For a while, everything was silent in the tunnels. While it isn't uncommon to be alone on the subways, the way that things changed from chaos to calm was unnerving, but I still told myself I'd rather be scared than killed. I didn't know what that noise was back there, but I had to stop caring, I'm going to enjoy my time off. I have to, at this point.

It felt like minutes with how I was walking, so I slowly increased my pace as I got comfortable and there wasn't any scare. But as time went on smoothly, that was when I started noticing the smaller things around me. There was no security in sight, at most, it was the camera but I couldn’t care less, no one else was present besides the voices that I heard, and everything was dead quiet. The only sounds I could hear were the fluorescent lighting above me, and some flies and mice scurrying across me.

Maybe it was because I felt like my life was in danger, but let me tell you, I never paid attention to every single thing before me in my life, and that smell was the most outstanding. The same stench that made me puke came back, still as strong as ever. Now, I've dealt with trash, shit, and other putrid things you'd find at the bottom of a restaurant dumpster at the heart of some of the busiest cities in the country - let alone smell them - so the fact this made me react was bizarre. To make matters worse, this was not a one-time thing. Every hallway that led in a different direction from the one I was taking had that smell when I passed by. My thoughts were all thinking of whatever it was, and I sure as hell was not going to visit to find out. I prayed to God that I wouldn't take a detour, my eyes were all glued to one thing, and one thing only. That fucking subway.

At last, I made it. As a New Yorker, I was a regular there, so I jumped over those turnstiles and made my way to the subway. Feeling relieved that nothing happened in between, I looked down at my clothes which made me feel so gross that I'd need a baptism rather than a shower. Then, the expected echoes of the train grew stronger as I waited. I felt like things were going smoothly. I saw the headlights and I could feel that stupid smile on my face. But it dropped when I turned and saw the clock.

2:07 AM.

I swear to you, I had no idea how I took that long. Sure, I walked slowly, but it shouldn't take about 3 hours. I felt like I was there for at most 40 minutes. I bet Adrian and my girlfriend were thinking I should stay home. I felt guilty, but most of all, I wanted to get out of here. Thinking about them made me feel safe and I want to see them. The doors opened and I immediately went in. I looked around and there was no one on the seats. Well, that's relieving, but not for long. Since I know people who work super early, I'd probably have my nap interrupted. I slumped on my seat, trying to make a plan in my head, but I was too tired and scared to even think straight. The doors closed and I closed my eyes to rub them, taking a second rest from those damn lights.

When I opened them, I still couldn't see anything.

I froze and I reached my hand to feel that cold part of the seat to at least know I was in reality, but I couldn't see it until it was super close to me. After making sure I didn't take a nap, this was a blackout that happened at the same time I closed my eyes. I cursed and kicked the seat in front of me in anger, realizing that the train was not budging. I reached into my pockets to get my phone, something I should've done long ago, but I heard rustling in the back seats behind me. Someone sighed heavily. I swear to God that I didn't see anyone there, I definitely would've even seen a small child from that distance, so how did I not see him? The doors needed to be forced open since there was no power, and I didn't see any flashlight to guide him in the dark, so how? The only thought, and I think this remains true, was that this guy was on the very corner of the train in a ball, huddled in a tight ball.

I heard laughing then from the same type of voice. This was not the raspy, high-pitched, or clear tone of the restaurant. This one was quieter and subtle with a low tone, almost close to a whisper, but everything else was audible, almost like his voice was close to my ear. I didn't turn around, I just sat there, realizing that my anger woke whoever was hidden and sleeping. The laugh wasn't something crazy, but almost mocking.

“Who do we have here?” The voice sounded. Even as my eyes could adjust to the darkness, I couldn't make out everything. I didn't see any flashlight or something the guy could use to make his way since it was pitch black, but he was making his way down easily. Every step he took was slow, it felt like a minute between every placed foot that echoed. It was all I could hear that was coming towards me. I only sat there, I didn't know what to do, or what was going to happen if I tried running. I was trapped, and I only hoped that he didn't do anything to me.

The lights went on, but it flickered so violently that I couldn't see anything. From inside and out of the train, my eyes were becoming disoriented and I had to shield them. At this point, I couldn't do anything but let the man do whatever he planned. Then, the sound of the buzzing lights went back on. Through my hands, I watched to the sides, through the windows. It was… Only darkness out there. I couldn't see anything except for my reflection-

And the man that was watching me.

From the reflection alone, I could see that he was wearing a dark face mask covering his mouth. He was wearing a beanie that covered his messy long hair that traveled to the end of his neck. He wore a black and red flannel, a black shirt, denim jeans, and green shoes. I went silent, staring at the reflecting window to see if he was going to acknowledge me. I saw him taking another step away from me, but my heart sank when I saw he was slowly sitting on the chair in front of me, leaning towards me.

“Hey.” Despite the voice being low, I felt my body going cold, and I started to feel uneasy again. “Hey.” It was like my body had a physical reaction again. At this point, I thought this was the same man wearing a different set of clothes, it was the only reason I could believe after all this time. I turned, and I spotted the details that made me wanna run. The guy had dark, crazy-looking eyes, jet-black hair, tan skin, and an athletic build. The only difference from the restaurant was that he had a slight beard just protruding from the mask. I thought the man was purposely wearing a different type of clothing just to mess with me. What am I supposed to believe at this point?

“Aw, look at you. You're shivering, coated in fear like you should. Praying for the first time since you're in danger for the first time! How exciting! Fear. Cry. Tremble like you're about to die. Because you are!”

I was in shock as his voice was slightly raised, he was laughing and sounded even more insane. He kept watching me, and I was waiting to see what he'd do. Then, the light flickered violently again, and he reacted to it.

“It's time to celebrate the passing of the light, the withering of safety, and the chaining of your farewells with a delicious anchor. I want to see your eyes for an eternity!” The lights disoriented my visions again, but I saw him through the flashing… dancing violently. He was flailing his arms and legs while still making sure I couldn't escape. “Please! Please! Oh, my favorite music! My entire being is ready! Let your death be in my shrine! Death, get him already!”

My head was leaning on the glass behind me, watching in shock as I barely could see thanks to the lights, and his movements were blinding fast. Then, I felt a jolt of pain hit the back of my head. I was hit so hard that I fell to the ground, closing my eyes as I wrapped my head tightly, trying to cover the sounds of the chaos I got myself in. I screamed, trying to drown out all the noises. But the lights turned back on, and everything went silent. I expected to see the man when I inched my head forward, staying on the floor to see what he was going to do with me. I didn’t see him in front of me, but he was further away to the end of the car, standing completely still with his head tilting.

“OPEN THE FUCK UP, MAGGOT! OPEN UP OR I'LL MAKE IT UGLY THAN YOUR FACE!”

It was the raspy voice again sounding with thunderous bangs from the windows. I quickly turned and saw the figure in front of the door that was ramming his fists into the window, shattering it with just a couple of punches.

I knew at this point I was in danger. This man had the same look as the other two men so far. Same height, same build, same skin color, same colored hair, and the same type of voice that is just changed in pitches and whatever. This one’s clothing had a tight gray shirt, black cargo pants, combat boots, and a black ball cap. He had a stubble, shorter than the flannel guy, and the muscles were on full display. I was convinced that he was able to force the subway doors out the way, but since he literally bent them, they weren’t able to be tucked away fully.

“YOU! YOU JUST HAD TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT, YOU FUCKER! WE SAID NOT TO KEEP THAT HOUSE AND YOU ALL IGNORED! YOU NEED TO DIE! GET OVER HERE, YOU BASTARD!”

I heard the other man in the mask laughing. In my peripheral vision, it looked like he was hanging on to the rails above, his body almost dangling as he was climbing up while I was backing up from the floor.

“I can’t taste it! I can smell it! You must’ve smelt the ones back there. Isn’t that the most beautiful scent in the world? I want more! Pleasure from the cold hands to your throat, and let your thread burn in the feast!”

I always, from that morning, remembered how everything happened in perfect detail because, and I may be wrong, but the very strong smell was from the dead bodies.

This man that was yelling had a face that I could tell that wanted to kill me by using his bare hands while cursing his brains out. The other guy was crazy enough to see me about to get killed. And looking back, it might be the sophisticated bastard that planned this. But I focused more on running, and I used this opportunity to run before the door violently closed again. As I stepped out of the car, I saw the two man there, now they’re eyes were watching me, but the enraged man yelled some more, and he moved to the other door, kicking and punching with the most powerful strikes I’ve ever seen.

I turned and I was thinking of ways to run and disorient them, thinking that the lights would flicker again, I saw a straight line of obstacles and doors that led to my escape. I booked it, and I ran as fast as I could while the guy broke free and started running. He was faster, making the sound of his hard boots echoing louder the closer he got. I was throwing trash cans, moving between poles, and doing whatever moves I could think of but he was still on my tail. Then the lights started flickering, messing with my eyesight again before I went to one of the doors.

There was a trash can next to the door, so I picked it up and swung it to the man. I clearly hit him since I heard him groan, but I didn’t wait. Even in the slightest chance of me dying, I heard the subway cart moving, and through the violent lights, I decided to use one of those indents in the wall, to flush my body to let the subway pass. I made sure as I jumped, landed, and stayed still that I did it perfectly. Sure enough, I closed my eyes and I could feel the force of the vehicle almost brushing past me. It passed me, but it stopped slowly. The light stopped flashing and stayed steady. Unfortunately, the view from the last window was clear enough for them to see me from the inside, and I could see them. I didn't want to move because there was another different man that walked out of the train.

It was another doppelganger of the past three, only he was wearing a bright red sweater, a white shirt, black jeans, and converse shoes. His hair was long and unkempt in a ponytail, but his face was clean shaven like the business man. He was smiling as he clapped his hands together.

“Woo, that was fun! Wait a second. Where's the rest? Hmm… I probably messed with the lights too much. I thought he would kill him once he was in the subway.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out something. “Damn… out of battery. Ah, well, we'll get him next time. Surely now is definitely not the time. Oh! Hey you three! We gotta get going, should we get the train going? How was it for you guys?”

That voice was the lightest, the one that was apologizing at the raspy. Then I saw them coming together to board the train without looking at me. I saw all four, including the business man. They all talked and bicker amongst themselves, but I stopped paying attention since my main goal after the train was to get out. The subway left, and I immediately booked it. I continuously ran all the way to my home, ignoring everything until I got home. I didn't bother checking the news if the “bodies” were discovered, or if the damages were recorded, they most likely were, but I don't care about it because things got more serious.

I called my work, my friends, and my girlfriend to tell them that I couldn't attend for anything, but I never told them why. I wasn't hurt at all, so I couldn't fake a sickness, but would anyone believe me? Would I want to say it like it was real? It may have been, but I can't even tell anymore. I have a feeling it was all orchestrated from nature itself.

But the main reason I'm telling ya’ll this is because my friend was taking a selfie from their trip there. And in one of the photos, I immediately recognized. There was the man with the ponytail, smiling and having fun with my friends with beer in his hand. I'm going to call Adrian up about this, but if you ever see one of them, avoid them no matter what. If they acknowledge you, your fate is decided for whatever reason. They know who I am, and who are my connections, it's only a matter of time before I'm done for. Enjoy life, because you never know what is coming for you for whatever reason.
