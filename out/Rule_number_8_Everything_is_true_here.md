I never thought that a simple decision to indulge in late-night Reddit browsing would lead me down a dark and terrifying path. It all started innocently enough, with a simple post on r/nosleep â€“ Little did I know, that decision would unravel a horrifying reality beyond my wildest nightmares.  
  
One gloomy night, as rain tapped against my window, I found myself scrolling through the seemingly endless stories. They were filled with tales of ghosts, demons, and unexplainable phenomena, and each story drew me deeper into a world of fear. I stumbled upon a post with a title that caught my eye: "The Curse of the Unread Stories." The author warned that reading every story could lead to unimaginable consequences.  
  
Intrigued, I delved into the narrative. The author claimed that each story posted on r/nosleep had a connection to a dark realm, and reading them all in chronological order would somehow open a doorway to this otherworldly dimension. I scoffed at the idea, dismissing it as an elaborate piece of fiction meant to entertain and frighten readers. Little did I know, I was about to plunge into a nightmare of my own making.  
  
Ignoring the warning, I decided to embark on the chilling journey. I started from the earliest posts, working my way through tales of haunted houses, malevolent spirits, and cursed artifacts. The stories became more unnerving with each passing night, yet I couldn't tear myself away. The thrill of fear kept me hooked, and I foolishly dismissed the notion that the stories could have any real-world consequences.  
  
As I reached the more recent posts, the atmosphere in my room began to change. Shadows seemed to linger longer, and the air felt heavy with an unexplained tension. I shrugged off these sensations, attributing them to an overactive imagination fueled by the unsettling stories I had consumed. However, things took a sinister turn when I stumbled upon a particularly cryptic tale titled "The Abyss Beckons."  
  
The story described a mysterious portal that appeared to those who had read a specific sequence of stories on r/nosleep. Intrigued and filled with an irrational curiosity, I realized that the sequence matched the order in which I had been reading the stories. Fear gripped me, but morbid fascination kept me scrolling.  
  
The author of "The Abyss Beckons" warned that once the portal was open, malevolent entities from the other side would seep into our world. Scepticism warred with the growing unease in my gut, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was dreadfully wrong. I glanced around my dimly lit room, half expecting to see a shadowy figure lurking in the corners.  
  
As I neared the end of the designated sequence, a sense of impending doom settled over me. I hesitated, my cursor hovering over the next post. The room seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy, and I could almost hear a distant whisper in the air. My heart raced as I clicked on the final story.  
  
The tale unfolded in a first-person narrative, much like the others, but it was as if the author knew I was reading. The story detailed a horrifying encounter with a creature that existed in the shadows between dimensions. The more I read, the more the room seemed to distort, and a cold dread crawled up my spine.  
  
Suddenly, the words on the screen twisted and contorted, forming a message directed at me: "You've opened the gateway. The Abyss awaits." Panic surged through me as the room plunged into darkness, the only illumination emanating from the computer screen. I could feel an unseen presence closing in, the air thickening with malevolence.  
  
Desperation clawed at me as I fumbled for the power button, attempting to sever the connection to whatever I had unleashed. The room echoed with guttural whispers, and an icy chill enveloped me. I could barely make out the distorted shapes that seemed to materialize in the shadows.  
  
With a trembling hand, I managed to shut down the computer. The room fell into absolute silence, the oppressive atmosphere lifting. I sat in the darkness, catching my breath, uncertain if what I had experienced was real or a manifestation of my terror-fueled imagination.  
  
Days passed, and I tried to convince myself that it was all a hallucination brought on by the relentless consumption of horror stories. Yet, sleep eluded me, haunted by vivid nightmares and the lingering fear that something from the other side still lingered in the shadows.  
  
As I write this, I can't shake the feeling that I've glimpsed into a realm beyond our understanding. The stories were not mere fiction; they were warnings, cautionary tales meant to protect curious souls like mine. The abyss I opened continues to call out to me, and I can't escape the dread that, one day, it may claim me in ways unimaginable.  
  
So, heed my warning. Don't read all the stories on here, for the horror within those tales may not be confined to the realm of fiction. The consequences of curiosity can be far more terrifying than you could ever imagine. 

As for me I am looking for a way to forget - forget what I read hoping that the abyss will let me go. Wishing that the door will close with me on the right side.
