I’m a woman who works in a male dominated industry, which of course comes with some struggles. Ben was one of the first people I met out on the job. He always had my back and always made sure I was included. We’ve worked together for six years now. He and his wife quickly became like family to me. 

Two months ago Ben was in a wreck where the person in the other vehicle likely died. Ben was the kind of person who never wanted to hurt a fly. Very tender hearted and genuine. The wreck was 100% the other persons fault, but he couldn’t handle the guilt. 

Ben took his life in late May. 

I had to help his wife make many phone calls, and even hosted his celebration of life at my house. All in all I was trying, and still am trying, to be a support for his wife. 

Two weeks and two days after he died, he came to see me in a dream. 

Well, more like, he made me come to him. 

I’ve had many dreams in my life, tons of nightmares, but nothing like this. It was so clear. Everything that didn’t make sense, still makes sense. 

His mannerisms, the way he spoke, the way he sat, it was all him. 

I was confused, wondering around a very large waiting area, decorated in maybe 2010’s era, with structural white beams, and wooden couches and chairs with the brown, gold, and red fabric designs, and the 1’x1’ light brown tile. 

There was no front desk, no one around at all. I was so confused. 

Until I saw him. 

He was sitting on the floor, with his back towards me, cross cross Apple sauce, drawing. 

I have never had such an urge to punch someone in the face. I was so angry. It took everything in me to not swing on him as soon as I got to him. 

I walked up and just said “Ben what the fuck”. 

I’m just so angry. He left us. 

He was calm, like always. He continued to draw. 

Finally he slightly looked up at me, since I was still somewhat standing behind him, and with the same expression I’ve seen a thousand times he asked “so what happened? I don’t remember anything.” 

“You fucking killed yourself, Ben.” I replied. 

I’ll save you all the gory details, but I then explained what he had done. 

He put his head back down and just started to shake his head, and put his hands over his face. 

I could feel the regret and the pain. The sorrow. 

I woke up with a pain in my chest. I had the same pain for the first few days after he died, until I saw his body before being cremated. For some reason seeing him, even though dead on a table in a funeral home with a bullet hole in his head, made me feel better. He looked so good, considering the circumstances. I hadn’t had that pain in my chest for almost two weeks until then. Now I can’t get it to go away. 

I’ve had nightmares every night since then. Nothing is related to him, or his death, just horrible dreams. 

My husband has started waking up at 3:00AM on the dot every morning since I had that dream. 

I think it may be time I sage the house.
