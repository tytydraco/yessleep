After my grandmother passed away, it fell to me to help clean out her house. She had lived there for over sixty years, and every room was filled with memories, dust, and forgotten belongings. It was hard, but the attic was the worst.

The air was thick with the scent of mothballs and time. Boxes were stacked high, old furniture draped in white sheets like ghosts frozen mid-motion. I was about to call it a day when I saw it—a large wooden trunk pushed into the farthest, darkest corner of the attic. Unlike everything else, it wasn't covered in dust. **Someone had touched it recently.**

I hesitated. Something about it felt... wrong. But curiosity won. I dragged it into the light and examined it. Heavy, old, and locked with a rusted padlock. The name **"Eliza"** was carved into the lid. My grandmother’s name.

I searched through the attic until I found a small key in an old jewelry box. My hands trembled as I fit it into the lock. With a soft *click*, it popped open.

Inside, neatly arranged, were dozens of Polaroid photographs.

At first, they seemed normal. Old family pictures. Black-and-white snapshots of my grandmother as a young woman, my grandfather beside her, smiling. But as I flipped through them, my stomach turned. The later ones were different. **Wrong.**

The first unsettling photo showed my grandmother sitting on the edge of her bed, staring at the camera. She wasn’t smiling. She looked... **tired.** Maybe even scared. The next few were similar—her in the kitchen, her in the living room, always looking directly at the lens, always with the same exhausted, **haunted** expression.

Then, a shift.

One photo showed my grandmother asleep. Another of her brushing her hair in the mirror. Then one of her sitting at the dining table—but this time, **the photo was taken from outside the window.**

My breath hitched. **Someone had been taking these pictures of her.**

I shuffled through them faster, panic rising in my chest. The last ten or so were completely different. **Darker.** Blurry images taken at night. The hallway outside her bedroom door. The foot of her bed. **The closet door slightly ajar.**

Then, the final photo.

It was taken from inside her bedroom. My grandmother was asleep. And standing in the corner of the room, barely visible in the shadows, was a **tall, thin figure.**

I dropped the stack of photos and stumbled back, my pulse pounding in my ears. My mind raced. Who had taken these? My grandfather? A stalker?

Then I noticed something else in the trunk. A single **handwritten note**, folded neatly beneath the photographs. I picked it up, unfolding it with shaking fingers.

**“If you find this, don’t look for me. Don’t try to understand. Just burn it. Burn everything.”**

It was signed **Eliza.**

A sharp creak sounded behind me.

I spun around. The attic was empty. Just dusty boxes and forgotten relics. But the air felt different—**heavy, charged, expectant.**

I grabbed the trunk and ran. I don’t remember getting in my car or speeding down the road. I don’t remember anything except the **overwhelming feeling of being watched.**

I took the trunk to a secluded spot near the woods and did what the note said. I burned everything. The photographs curled and blackened, faces twisting in the flames. The trunk groaned as the fire consumed it.

As I stood there, my mind racing, something **crackled behind me**. A branch snapping underfoot.

I turned, heart in my throat.

Nothing. Just trees. Just darkness.

But as I stared, I swore I saw something shift between the trees. **Tall. Thin. Watching.**

I don’t know what my grandmother was hiding. I don’t know if burning the trunk was enough. But ever since that night, I’ve been waking up at exactly **3:14 AM.**

And every time, my closet door is slightly open.
