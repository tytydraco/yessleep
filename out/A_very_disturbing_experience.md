I just want to start things off by saying that this isn’t necessarily my story but my mom’s story instead. This story happened to her well over ten years ago when we were moving houses. It’s worth mentioning that the events that took place happened on the last day while we were moving out. Every time my mom retells this story to me or anyone else, it always freaks her out and makes her very uncomfortable which you’ll soon learn why. 

We were moving houses as my stepdad’s mom was wanting to move back into that house. We had moved up from California to Montana and we had nowhere to stay or move our stuff to. My stepdad’s mom however was generous and decided to give the house she was living in to us and would go move down to Helena for a year with her husband. She then would allow my parents a year to find a house and move there as she wanted to have her house back after that. It’s also worth noting that the house was a huge area of property with barbed wire fence surrounding most of it. The part that creeped me out when I lived there was that the house was surrounded by forest that seemed to go on for miles. So fast forward a year, my parents were fortunate to find a house not too far from where we originally lived. It took us two days to move everything out of the old house and into the new one. On the second/last day is when everything happened. 

My mom and my stepdad were going back to the house to grab the last of the stuff that was there and to lock the place up. They got there and my stepdad told my mom that he would be in the outdoor garage if she needed anything. My mom had said ok and made her way into the house. A quick description of the house as it’s important to the story. There are two entry/exit points of the house. The first is in the front of the house and the second is in the back. If you were to enter from the front door, you’d be in the living room. If you were to walk for a little bit and turn right, there’s a mini corridor with three rooms. The room on the left was my brother’s room, the middle one was the bathroom, and the one on the right was mine. If you were to keep going straight after coming in the front, you’d be in the laundry room and there was the back door which lead outside. If you were to turn right before entering the laundry room, there’s the stairs which leads upstairs. Upon going upstairs if you turn left, there’s another mini corridor with two rooms on opposite sides. The bathroom was on left side and my parent’s bedroom was on the right. If you turn right after going upstairs, there was the kitchen on the right side of the room and the dining area on the left side. There was also a balcony nearing the dining room that overlooks the front yard. 

My mom had gone through all the rooms downstairs to ensure that she didn’t miss anything. She eventually makes her way upstairs and begins going through all the rooms. She’s in the kitchen grabbing the last few things when she hears it. She heard what she said was this slow, heavy footsteps downstairs. The footsteps made its way up the stairs until it stopped at the last step. My mom then heard my dad’s voice say loud and clear to her “I don’t think that’s a good idea.” My mom paused for a moment and stood there in confusion. She asked him what’s not a good idea but was met with no response. She asked again but there was no response. 

She starts getting annoyed thinking he’s messing with her so she goes over to the stairs. She makes it to the stairs only to see that nobody was there. She was confused for a moment but that confusion and annoyance had quickly turned into fear and dread. My mom stood there at the top of the stairs not knowing what to do. She goes back to what she was doing when she hears the back door open and close. At first, she thought it was my stepdad leaving but soon realized how could he make it downstairs with zero noise. She heard the same slow, heavy footsteps coming up the stairs again. She went to go look and had saw that my stepdad was there and was coming up the stairs. 

My stepdad tells my mom that he just finished grabbing the rest of his tools from the outdoor garage and was ready to go. My mom looked at him and asked him what’s not a good idea. My stepdad stared at her dumbfounded. She asked him the same question again and he replied with “what are you talking about?” My mom explained the footsteps she heard and had heard his voice asking that same question. My stepdad said he wasn’t in the house at all until a minute ago. He said he was outside the whole time grabbing his stuff and locking up the garage. My mom was at a loss for words and was beginning to feel nervous too. 

My mom swore up and down that she thought my stepdad was there and heard his voice. My stepdad had reassured her that it wasn’t him and that she was probably tired from staying up the night before and from how stressed she was. A few moments later is when everything had went from weird to downright horrifying. Shortly after my stepdad finished talking, the kitchen lights started flickering, the chandelier in the dining room started swaying back and forth, the bathroom door slammed shut, and all of the cabinet doors violently swung open at the same time. The cabinet doors then slammed shut which was then followed by a loud crashing noise that came from the bedroom. My parents went to go check it out and had saw that the ceiling fan had fallen to the ground. 

At that point, my mom was so shaken up that she looked at my stepdad and said that they need to leave now, that she’s done and doesn’t want to be there anymore. They grabbed the last of their stuff and hurried downstairs. When they got downstairs, they saw my old bedroom door open and slam shut on its own. My parents had gone out the back door and threw the stuff they had in their car. My mom went back inside to grab the last of the stuff from downstairs and heard the bedroom door upstairs being slammed shut repeatedly. She got the last of the stuff, locked up the house, and sped out of there without looking back. 

My mom firmly believes that someone or something was in that house that wanted them out of there. I have a few theories about that house and what went on that day. My first theory is that the entity haunting that house is probably a mimic due to it copying my stepdad’s voice. My other theory is that it was likely either a skinwalker or a wendigo since our house was on Native American land and we did live on a reservation next to a huge forest. I’ve told some people this story and some believe the same thing that I said. Others believe that it was some other spirit that liked our company and was upset that day and caused everything to happen due to us leaving. 

My mom had also told me that she had witnessed unexplained things when we lived there. She told me that she had woken up in the middle of the night to footsteps on the balcony and even footsteps on the roof. She has heard the front door open and closed and thought it was either me or my brother only to go check and find that both of us were asleep. She’s even seen the bedroom door open on its own only to see that nobody was there. My mom also believes that someone or something was there always watching us which made her feel that there was something wrong with the house. I’m glad that we’re out of that house and never have to deal with it again.
