It was a Monday morning at the office as usual. I sat in my lumpy chair and went over case files that my colleagues left on my desk. The clicking of the hands on the clock went in ones, then twos, then nonexistence and I took that first dreaded sip of plain ass coffee I got from the lobby on the walk of shame to the third floor. I quickly went into auto pilot just trying to get these papers ran through and signed.

	Oh… My bad. I work at the paranormal investigation center in Northern Missouri. We call ourselves “The paranormal help and support team” and my job is you guessed it. Paperwork.

I’ve decided to post here because I heard you guys like freaky shit. Believe me I have a lot of “freaky shit” to share but most notable is these recent cases we’ve been getting. 

Where we normally would show up and intervene, for some reason our job recently has just been showing up. All of the incidents seem to be resolving themselves. Don’t get me wrong this would normally be a damn good day but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Anyway… I’m not going to explain anymore. Please just read for yourselves and see what you make of this. I personally couldn't be more stumped.

Interview with agent after the incident:



“Hey there Mary. How are you holding up?” I tried my best to sound as polite as possible, but I seriously couldn’t hide the undertone of anxiety regarding everything I’ve witnessed tonight.

She sat there still clearly disturbed with her hand shaking while she held the warm beverage she’s been sipping, but it’s obvious that she’s happy everything’s over. “Good.” She replied shakily. “But if you don't mind me asking, why do I have to go over every little event with you?” She was clearly upset but not confrontational. I maintained eye contact with her and softened my tone. “It's just standard process, dear. We need to understand everything that happened in your own words. So please just explain everything from the beginning and all of this will be over.” She breathed a sigh of relief. “All right. From the beginning.”



7:00 a.m. August 18th:



	That night I had a horrible dream, when I awoke, I couldn’t remember the details but like a mite in a spider’s web it didn’t really bother me. I looked up at the clock and realized today was the first day of school. “Ugghhhh. Damn it.” 

It was my first year of college and I’ve never really been in too many social situations. My mom and dad homeschooled me and I’ve always avoided other people like the plague. 

I made my way to the elevator of my dorm hall after brushing my teeth and putting on makeup, but clicking the button was futile because for some reason this has to be the worst day of my life, and the elevator decides it’s not it’s day. “Son a bitch” I whispered not wanting to attract attention and realizing I would need to take the stairs.

I made my way to the stairs and realized I had to take the dreaded steps down the five floors of misery. 

I just want to say that I’ve never been the most put together person. I’m the type of person that always dropped the spoon in my cereal or almost got hit by a car on a half a mile walk. One step, then two steps, then 10, then gravity, then nothing.

I remember standing. Everything was dark and there was seemingly nothing in sight. I decided to listen closely and that's when I found out that I could hear things, but they sounded like they were coming from somewhere else entirely. “We’re losing her!” then a flat line. 

For some reason I don’t feel like I’m alone. Something feels. Off. I looked around but I saw nothing, but I know there’s SOMETHING here. “H-hello??” I said feeling like I was going to leak the fear out that’s building in me all over my pants. 

That’s when I saw it. It was waving at me. It looked like a person but that smile and those eyes. Cold, demonic, and sinister. I screamed and I tried to run but I only ran in place. It started walking toward me and that's when I screamed my soul out. “SOMEBODY HELP ME!”

That's when the darkness quickly turned into a hospital room. “What the fuck! What the actual Fuck!” I looked around at the doctors and nurses who only grew more concerned. “Shhhh shhh Mary. You need to calm down.” I wondered what happened to me, but I was quickly filled in by the very doctor who shushed me and was standing next to my hospital bed. “You took a really nasty fall. You have a concussion, your left arm was shattered, you have multiple broken ribs one of which pierced your lungs and put so much stress on your organs that your heart stopped twice” 

I was so shocked and stunned by everything that the whole rest of that day disappeared from my mind, and I just laid there listening to them drone on.



12: a.m. August 21st:



	I laid there in my hospital bed staring up at the ceiling for the third night in a row. Imagine your standard hospital room where you stay overnight because your parents are a whole state away and can't pick you up for a week and the ceiling looks how you’d imagine.

	“Great, I have to miss a whole month of school because of a stupid elevator.” I said as I continued looking at the ceiling and thinking about how many rumors have probably spread by this point. 

	That's when I heard it. In the silent and eerie hospital, I heard the tap, tap, of footsteps walking down the hall. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t scared shitless right now because that's exactly how I’m feeling. I listened as it stopped at my door and gave three slow and ominous knocks. 

	“Who is it?” I said shakily. Whoever it was whispered so quietly I could barely distinguish what she said. “Excuse me, what did you say?” I said in a shaky tone that portrayed my anxiety. “I said \~ *indistinguishable*” I was even more scared now. “E-excuse m-me.. What was that?” The second felt like an eternity before she screamed in a bloodcurdling and horror-stricken scream. “I SAID IT WANTS YOUR SOUL!” 

The fear overwhelmed me completely and I woke up in tears and sweat to see the nurse next to me. She looked very concerned. “Is everything alright Ms. Stockton?” I took a few deep breaths and grounded myself. “Yeah, everything’s alright just a nightmare” I continued taking deep breaths and telling myself it was just a dream.



2:00 p.m. August 22nd:



	My parents had just got me home. They were like any other parents in this situation. Worried about their daughter and getting way too overprotective. They may have been very dawdling but they’re my parents and I love them anyway.



3:47 a.m. August 24th: 



	I woke up to a sight that made me jump back in my bed despite my injuries. Before me stood a male figure at about six feet tall. However, unlike what you see in your stereotypical horror movie he wasn’t facing me but my door. “S-sir?” It didn’t reply. “Sir please just get out of my room.” I said with a shakiness in my voice but it didn’t reply. It just stood there and stared at my door with its left hand resting on what looked like the hilt of a sword on its hip. 

I decided to show some bravery but the terror in my voice was very much there. “Sir if you don’t leave now, I’m going to call the cops.” This time it replied. The voice was human with a spectral undertone. It was almost like it had an echo to it. “The cops can’t help you. If you’re going to be awake you need to stay there and  remain quiet.”

	I was terrified and I decided to try getting up, but the man pushed me back into my bed by my shoulder. “I said you need to stay there and be quiet.” He said in an indifferent and unamused tone. I decided to make up a lie. “But I need to get a drink. I’m thirsty.” The man didn't move and in what felt like about ten seconds he replied in an authoritative tone. “You remain here and remain quiet. I will go get you a drink.”

	The man slowly walked toward the door. Outside of my window it’s at the point when the clouds outside in the night cleared a little and I got a better view of what he looked like from behind. 

	A black cloak of which his hood was up, various dark grey armor on his forearms, shoulders, boots, and legs that’s adorned with black leather, along with a black sword sheathe. I didn’t get a look at the hilt of the blade. 

	He slowly walked toward the door before slowly opening it with a creek and shutting it. I breathed a sigh of relief but that was before I saw the shit of nightmares.

	The same evil figure from what a thought was a dream, before I got resuscitated. It was at this moment that I quickly realized something horrible. Nothing I experienced was a dream. This was real. All of it was real. 

	I watched as its mouth opened slowly to reveal sharp silver teeth as it began floating towards my bed. The terror hit me all at once and all I knew how to do was scream, and scream, and scream, and scream. I didn’t even hear my parents outside the door trying to get in.

	Just as it was about to be right on top of me the man appeared through the darkness as well and said, “You don't belong in this world.” in a tone that sounded just as authoritative as before. The terrifying entity turned its head in his direction and so did I. 

	This time I got a full view of what he looked like from the front. The hood of the cloak covering his face and the cloak covering his front. Various armor adorned with black leather and what was clearly a sword at his hip. The sword was a very similar style to his outfit with what looked like a symbol at the end of the hilt. I didn’t know what it meant, nor did I care to. 

	He quickly unsheathed his blade and drove it into the thing’s chest. The encounter was so fast that I barely had time to react before the thing turned to dust. “T-thank you” I said with tears of both immense fear and immense gratitude alike adorning my face.

	The man disappeared into the darkness as my parents busted in and looked extremely terrified and confused.

	I told them about everything from the beginning to the end and they believed me a lot more than I thought they would. No more than thirty minutes later an agent was at our door wanting to speak with me.



Interview with agent:



	“The entity you’re describing. They prey on those that have met death and have been pulled back from it. Like a hitman returning to the job after the victim lived and they didn’t get their paycheck” I gave the anxious woman a reassuring look. “Don’t worry about others coming, my team is setting up a metaphysical barrier around your property while we speak, so you should be safe while your injuries heal.”

	Mary then looked at me as if I was missing something. “But what about the man? You know? The man in the cloak?” I took a deep breath. “What do you want to know?” She looked at me in a way that made me realize she was worried about something, but I didn’t know what. “Ah yes. If you want honesty this is a first. This type of thing has never happened before.” 

I paused. “However, I do plan to open an investigation regarding this. It’s highly peculiar and is a massive red flag especially to my organization.” I ran my brain with the details she gave me. “From what you’ve described it sounds like a type of spirit or other entity, likely one with a protective instinct that saw someone in need and decided to act.” 

“All done boss.” I look out the window to see my lieutenant signaling me that the team is done. “Well Mary, thank you for the information. I apologize that we couldn’t help and I’m happy that you’re alive” I pulled a card from my coat pocket and handed it to her. “If anything like this happens to you again or someone you know please call us and we’ll be there.”

I wrapped up my conversation with her before getting in the S.U.V. and opening up a new project on my company laptop.

*Entity 0094: The ghost vigilante.*

  


Like I said, these cases are very weird. I would like to apologize for not providing the name of the agent. While the details and case files are not too confidential when it comes to sharing them, our agent’s names are. 

I have other cases regarding this ghost vigilante figure if you guys would like me to share them. From what I’ve read the mysteries only get deeper and deeper but tell me what you guys think. 

For now, I have more paperwork to do and uploading these takes a considerable amount of time from my job and it’s time I’m not getting paid for. Please share your thoughts on this case.
