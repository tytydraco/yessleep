There was an old dilapidated house on the edge of our neighborhood when I was a kid. There were no houses behind it or next to it. Sometimes we'd have to walk past it to get home when we were coming from the next neighborhood over like we do when trick or treating on Halloween.

It had an old pick up truck in the driveway so we often argued about whether anyone lived there or not. We didn't see any mail piling up but we were never around when the mailman came by so we couldn't tell if they stopped there or not. The house's lawn was mostly dead grass so we didn't know if it ever got mowed or not either.

One time Marsha Blackwell said she was walking home from a friends house and had to walk past the old house and saw the face of an old lady staring at her from the attic window. She got scared and ran the rest of the way.

The next Halloween, three of us went trick or treating together. It was the first year we were old enough to go without our parents coming with us. We were all thirteen years old. It was Marsha, my best friend Brandon, and me. Marsha was a princess, Brandon went as Frankenstein's monster, and I was a werewolf.

We had almost finished going to all the houses in our neighborhood and each of us had a pretty good haul of candy. It was exciting to be out without our parents with us. It felt kind of liberating. We were joking around and having a blast when we saw the old house up ahead.

Brandon said we should go knock on the door. There were no lights on so we didn't like the idea. I mean it was only 8 O'Clock but it was dark out and with no lights on, it's a sure bet that no one lived there. Brandon said if no one lives there then no one would get mad if we knocked on the door. There was no getting around that logic but we were all too scared to do it anyway.

Brandon said we should play truth or dare and if we got dare we had to go alone to the house and knock and if someone answered the door we must say 'trick or treat'. That seemed fair and so we all agreed. To determine truth or dare we decided to flip a coin because no one would pick dare if given the choice. Heads would be truth and tails would be dare. All three of us flipped a coin and all three of us got tails. Of course.

Marsha said she shouldn't have to go first because she's a girl. That seemed reasonable. I said it was Brandon's idea so he should have to go first. Marsha and I agreed and so Brandon was out voted and went first.

He walked up the creaking steps to the porch of the old house while we waited in the street and watched. We were ready to run if things got out of hand. The windows were all dark but there were ragged curtains visible through most of them. There were yellow and red leaves scattered across the yard and porch, lit by the full moon above.

We saw Brandon slightly rap his knuckles on the door. Rap rap rap. We were giddy with anticipation and a bit of fear. There was no answer. He was just turning to walk back down the steps when the door slowly opened making a creaking sound that we could hear from the street. We couldn't see anyone in the darkened door from where we were.

Brandon turned back around and said "trick or treat." An arm reached out of the dark interior of the home and dropped something into his bag. He turned and ran back to where we were waiting as the door creaked closed.

We asked him if he got a look at the person who answered. He said no, it was too dark. All he saw was the arm which was old and withered.

Next it was Marsha's turn because she lost another coin toss we did to see who went next. She approached the door just like Brandon did. The steps creaked and then she knocked. Rap rap rap on the door. Again the door slowly opened making the same creaking sound. She said "trick or treat." Again an arm reached out of the dark void of the doorway and dropped something in her bag. She ran back to where we were waiting as the door closed.

We asked her if she got a look at the person. She said no, it was too dark. All she saw was an old woman's withered up arm.

Next it was my turn. It was fine, I thought to myself. It's just a really old lady. She probably lives on a budget and doesn't like to use lights. I pictured her sitting in the back room there, reading by candlelight. I felt better about it then. I bet she's happy to have some kids to give candy out to. We were probably making her day.

I walked up the creaking steps and knocked on the door. Rap rap rap. The door slowly opened and I stared into the dark abyss of the house. "Trick or treat," I said. The withered old arm protruded out from the black and dropped something into my bag and then recoiled back inside.

It was frightening and unnerving, but I stood there to see if I could see anything else. Then the hand that had just given me candy appeared out of the dark again with its palm facing upward, and motioned me to come inside by curing its fingers.

A chill went up my spine. There's no way I was going in there. I was raised to be polite and in case it was just a lonely or senile old woman, I didn't want to be rude, so instead of running I said "I have to go. Thank you."

I turned to leave when I heard Marsha and Brandon give off slight little screams. I could hear the door close as I walked back to where they were. They told me that after I turned to walk back the hand had reached out and had sightly run its fingers through the hair on the backside of the werewolf mask I had on.

When we got back to my house we told my mom about the old lady. She said it couldn't be true unless it was some teenager playing a prank because that old lady had died about 15 years earlier and no one had moved into that house since. She said she knew because she was a real estate agent and her office handles that property which they were having trouble selling.

We looked through our bags to see if we could tell which candy she had given us and each of us found one piece of candy whose wrapper was just covered in dust. All three of these were the same brand. It was a brand that had gone out of business ten years earlier. No one keeps ten year old candy around. And there was definitely no way I was eating it.

Later that night when I was in bed and almost asleep, I heard a strange thing. It was a light knocking on my bedroom window. Rap rap rap. The next day I told Marsha and Brandon about it and they both heard it too on their windows on that Halloween night.

The next day my mom was about to throw the three candy bars in the trash when she noticed that one looked like it had been opened and carefully taped shut with scotch tape. She examined the other two and they also had been opened and resealed. When she opened them up she found to her horror that they were all human fingers.

She called the police and told them the story. They checked out that old abandoned house but no one was in there and there was no sign that anyone had broken in the night before.

They ran the fingerprints of the severed fingers through the police database and they got a match. All three were from a 12 year old boy named Sammy who had been missing for twelve months. The police said that they were keeping it out of the news but there had been a similar case somewhere in the state every Halloween for the past several years.

I often wonder, if I had gone inside the house that night, if I too would have had my fingers tossed into some unsuspecting kids bag when the next Halloween came around.
