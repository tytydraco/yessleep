A few years ago, my friend Liam and I went out hiking in a forest near where we lived. Nothing too remote, but the kind of place where trails split and disappear if you’re not paying attention. We weren’t exactly following the map — just wandering off the beaten path like we used to do when we were bored.

It was mid-afternoon when we noticed this **really overpowering smell**. Sickly sweet, like overripe fruit left out in the heat too long. At first, we joked about it — thought maybe it was a dead deer or something. But curiosity got the better of us, and we started pushing through the undergrowth to find the source.

And… we found him.

A man. Dead.

He was slumped against a tree, half-covered by fallen leaves and brush, like he’d tried to hide himself or just wanted to disappear. He’d clearly been there a while. His skin was greenish-black in places. Swollen. There were flies, and… other things. The forest had already started to reclaim him. I won’t get into more detail. You can imagine.

Liam froze. I remember him just whispering, “Holy shit. That’s a person.”  
I called the police.

They told us to stay there until someone arrived. But we were pretty deep in, and it took them over two hours to reach us.

So yeah, we waited. With the body.

The smell didn’t go away. If anything, it got thicker — heavier. The air felt wrong, like it was pressing in on us. The forest had gone quiet, too. No birds, no bugs. Just… stillness. It felt like we weren’t alone. But we were. I kept telling myself we were.

As it got darker, things got worse.

Liam started pacing. I sat on a log a few feet from the body, trying not to look at it — but somehow always ending up staring. And maybe this was just my mind playing tricks on me, but **his head looked like it had turned slightly** since we found him. Just a little. Enough to notice. I didn’t say anything.

Then came the whispers.

I swear I heard someone say my name. Soft. Right behind me. I turned around fast, but there was no one there — just trees. Liam heard it too. He looked at me and said, “Did you hear that?”

We both went dead quiet.

Then we heard this slow, soft creaking. Like weight shifting on wood. Like **someone leaning forward from a tree.**

We didn’t run. We didn’t scream. We just sat. Stared at each other. Waited for the rangers.

Eventually, they came. Lights. Radios. Flashlights. One of them took us back to the trailhead while the others stayed behind. They told us the man had likely taken his own life. There was no ID. No one ever came forward. A quiet suicide, they said.

But it didn’t feel quiet.

After that day, **I started having dreams**. Always the same: I’m standing in the woods again, staring at that same tree, but the man isn’t slumped anymore. He’s standing. Facing me. His mouth is too wide and he doesn’t blink.

And he speaks.

Not loud. Just a whisper.

**“You shouldn’t have found me.”**

Liam had them too. He told me over text a few nights later:

>

We stopped hiking after that.

Liam got weird. Quiet. He’d never sleep through the night. Said he kept waking up to that smell — *that same smell* from the woods — filling his room. He told me once he saw footprints in the dirt under his window. Bare. Human. Facing inward.

I didn’t believe him.

Until I smelled it too.

Once. In my apartment. No open windows. Just a sudden, sharp **wave of sweet rot**, and then it was gone. I barely slept that night.

We’ve moved on since then. Sort of. Liam and I don’t talk much anymore. It’s not bad blood — we just avoid it. Like acknowledging it makes it come back stronger.

But every now and then, I still dream about the man in the woods.

And sometimes, just before I wake up, I hear him whisper:  
**“You kept me from resting. Now I keep you from forgetting.”**

That’s the part that really gets to me.  
Because I haven’t.

And I don’t think I ever will.
