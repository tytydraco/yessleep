Just a bit of backstory, my brother (M41) went missing last week. Police, friends, family and people in my local area have been searching but to no avail. I opened his laptop last night to see if I could find any clues but instead I was greeted with this email:

&#x200B;

*Dear \[DATA REMOVED\],*

*The Board has spoken and believe handing case #512 to your team is the most appropriate course of action. Attached to this email is the transcript with the agent who entered the apartment in \[DATA REMOVED\] and all the information PAC has gathered over \[DATA REMOVED\].*

&#x200B;

*#Session 1 transcript*

*K: "Good evening \[DATA REMOVED\], I believe you and your colleague had quite a night last night"*

*N: \*sigh\* "I'm afraid so"*

*K: "In this session i'll be asking you some questions, answer honestly and with as much detail as possible, the detailing of the event is going directly to the PAC team. This will be recorded as part of the evidence."*

*N: " I oblige"*

*K: "Excellent, lets begin, How did you end up in the apartment?"*

*N: "It wasn't our call at first, a neighbour in the complex had heard some noise from the floor below, called the police, feds show up and find the inhabitant of the room unresponsive to any knocks or calls from reception, I assume they decided to break the door down and found the state of the apartment and as such was escalated ending with my team being called"*

*K: "What happened when you arrived? Were the police dealt with"*

*N: "When we got there I got the names of all the officers, as of this morning i've been told that 5 out of the 7 there have been terminated and removed under a different set of stories. That story should end there by tonight. Upon entering the room a waft of rotting corpse and shit was smelt, looking up told us everything we needed to know, the floor, walls, ceiling was smeared with blood and facies, biological tests tell us its the occupants blood and shit. The floor had wet slimy footprints all over it, they started and ended at the right side window next to the bed. The occupants body was nowhere to be found but with the amount of blood scattered I doubt there's anything left of her. Her clothes were in the bathroom, shower was still running so I presume she was in the shower at the time of the attack but the room is spotless, left side of the bedroom wall and right side ceiling were dented and broken, after some scans with the team we concluded whatever hit that wall was going over 15kmph-"*

*K : "You think she was thrown by something?"*

*N: "We dont know, PAC need to look closer that's not on us, we do entry level detail not the whole thing, you know that"*

*K: "Fair enough, you have any idea what this is?"*

*N: "Cant say"*

*K: "Thanks for your time"*

*N: "My pleasure"*

&#x200B;

*The PAC'S team analysis shows that whatever broke in was at minimum 8ft, wingspan of 7.2ft, human resemblance, skinny structure and slimy to the touch with embryotic fluid. (More info in PAC #512 Doc)*

*PAC has been searching for this thing for a while and cant find it, 2 more cases have appeared since #512-A, your team needs to do more data analysis and assist SNA in neutralizing the #512 event.* 

*The pay for this job is negotiable but it is high priority.*

*The board sends their best wishes.*

*Farewell \[DATA REMOVED\]*

The email wasn't normal either, it was an internal system called "OPFUO" 

Anyone have any idea what this could be, any help is appreciated. 

I'll update when I have more info
