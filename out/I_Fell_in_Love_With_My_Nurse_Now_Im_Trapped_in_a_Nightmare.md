I remember the accident like it was yesterday. Unlike many people who say they can’t recall their crashes; I remember every detail of that day. It was winter, and the sun was setting early in the evening. I had gotten off work late; the daylight was now long gone and rain was coming down, making the roads slick, and visibility poor. I was driving my usual route home, thinking about what to pick up for dinner, when it happened. An oncoming truck suddenly swerved into my lane and came straight for me, head-on. In that brief moment, I felt a rush of terror, and a millisecond of clear understanding that I was about to die. Then, everything went black.

I woke up in a hospital room. I heard the beeping of the machines first, followed by the smell of antiseptic. I slowly began to open my eyes to the blinding of fluorescent lights. I heard a machine begin to beep faster, as confusion and panic began to wash over me.

“Woah, easy there”, I heard a voice say.

“You’ve been in an accident. You’re in the hospital, and you’re safe now.”

For a moment, I saw a face next to me. Pretty, and comforting. That was my last thought, before everything went black again.

I’m not sure how much time passed before I woke up again. Feeling more alert this time, I looked around the room, getting a bearing on my surroundings. I knew based on the number of monitors and IVs hooked up to me that I must have been in bad shape. As I blinked against the brightness, a nurse entered, a beacon of warmth in the cold, clinical environment. She had an air of calm that made me feel immediately safe amidst the chaos.

“Hello again, I’m Lily,” she said, her smile softening the edges of my fear. “You passed out before I could introduce myself last time. I’m one of your nurses.” Her kindness radiated as she checked my vitals, her gentle touch igniting a flicker of comfort in me. Day by day, she became my anchor, the one constant in a world that felt hopeless.

As the days stretched into weeks, our conversations grew more personal. I found myself sharing bits of my life, my dreams, and fears, revealing the vulnerable pieces of myself that I rarely showed. Lily listened, her eyes sparkling with empathy, her laughter soothing. I realized I was falling for her, hard.  Her presence in my recovery brightened my days and made me forget the pain.

The more time we spent together, the more I felt a sense of normalcy return to my life. During a particularly quiet evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting my hospital room in hues of orange and pink, I knew I had fallen in love with her. She had just finished her shift and came to check on me before leaving. Her hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail, the tiredness in her eyes overshadowed by the warmth of her smile.

Feeling bold, I asked “So, when I get out of here, can I take you to dinner?”

She smiled, leaning against the doorframe. “Yes, I’d love that”, her face blushing.

In that moment, I felt a connection between us, something electric that pulsed in the air.

After another couple weeks of healing, I was finally discharged. I sat outside the hospital, the sun warming my skin, a stark contrast to the cold sterility I had grown accustomed to. I kept my word to Lily, taking her out for dinner a few days later. And the rest, as they say, was history.

We began to explore the possibility of a life together. We found the perfect little house on the outskirts of town; its white picket fence a picture of domestic bliss. It felt like a dream. The house was modest, but was a fresh start, a blank canvas on which we could build our lives together. We spent countless hours painting the walls, arranging furniture, and filling the space with our personalities.

As we settled into our new life, I couldn’t have been happier. Lily was everything I had ever wanted, kind, intelligent, and fiercely supportive. It was as if the universe had conspired to bring us together, and for the first time in a long while, I felt a sense of belonging. I felt thankful for the crash that brought her to me.

Months passed, and we only grew closer. We shared dreams of starting a family and growing old together in that cozy little home. We’d sit on the porch, watching the sunset, discussing our plans and laughing at inside jokes. But over time, something started to change in that house. Something started to change in Lily.

It started as small things. Objects would get misplaced; the trashcan would be knocked over. Lily and I would tease each other for being forgetful, each of us assuming it was the other.  But then things began to happen that I knew couldn’t have been her.

One night, while cooking dinner, I got the milk out of the refrigerator, and set it on the counter. When I turned back around, it was gone, back in the refrigerator. Doors would creak open, the TV would change channels by itself. I began to feel uneasy in the house, like I was being watched. One night, while sitting on the couch, I brought the topic up to Lily.

“Do you ever feel... strange in this house? Like you’re being watched?” I asked.

“No, not at all... are you being serious?” She replied.

“Oh come-on, you mean to tell me you’ve never thought it's weird that things move around on their own all the time, how our stuff always gets misplaced? You’ve never heard the doors opening and shutting by themselves?” I said.

“Hallucinations are normal after a bad injury. Maybe we need to go get you checked out”. Lily said.

Her dismissiveness touched my nerves. “I’m not hallucina – “

“I think you should just let it go” she interrupted.

Her cold response caught me off guard, and for the first time, I felt a rift between us.

That night, I laid in bed, staring up at the ceiling, replaying the conversation I’d had with Lily earlier. It wasn’t even a real fight, but it lingered in my mind. Lately, it had started to feel like we were both on edge, with something unspoken weighing between us. And it wasn’t just that conversation; it was everything in this house. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong, that I was being watched, even now. I closed my eyes, willing myself to ignore the sense of dread, trying to drift off. But just as I felt myself slipping toward sleep, I heard it. A voice, close and quiet, whispering my name. “David”. It wasn’t Lily’s voice. It was urgent, almost pleading, as though someone was right there in the room with me, waiting for me to respond.

I jolted upright, heart pounding as I looked around the room, trying to find the source of the whisper. I strained my ears, waiting to hear it again. But there was nothing, just the sound of my own heavy breathing. I turned and saw Lily beside me, fast asleep, her breathing slow and steady. She looked peaceful, completely undisturbed. I tried to tell myself I’d imagined it, just a product of my own frayed nerves and lack of sleep. But as I lay back down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had been there, close enough to whisper right into my ear.

I woke up the next morning, more on edge than ever after my experience the night before. But Lily was in good spirits, and her kind and fun personality was contagious, bringing me out of my slump. And for the next few days, things seemed to settle down. No strange noises, no objects moving, just quiet nights and a gradual return to normalcy. I started to feel more like myself, and I wondered if maybe it had all been my imagination. Stress from moving, adjusting to a new life together, recovering after my injuries, nothing more. We’d started laughing together again, our conversations and routines falling back into place.

The strangeness of the house all but completely left my mind, when one afternoon, I was in the shower. I heard the bathroom door slowly open, and I could hear someone come in, their footsteps quiet but distinct. Through the steamy curtain, I could see the shadow of a figure approaching the shower and standing right outside, just lingering there. I waited for a second, waiting to hear Lily speak or open the curtain, but the figure just stood outside of the shower. I grinned, calling out to Lily, “Oh, coming to join me, huh?”

I opened the curtain to peek, only to find no one was there. The door was closed, as if no one had entered at all.

A chill crawled up my spine. I jumped out of the shower, quickly wrapping myself in a towel, and hurried into the living room. I found Lily on the couch, casually watching TV, completely at ease. “Oh yeah, very funny,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

She glanced up, confused. “What are you talking about?”

“Coming into the bathroom while I was in the shower,” I said, feeling a prickle of annoyance. “Were you just standing there to freak me out?”

Lily’s face hardened. “I didn’t go in there, David. And honestly, this… this stuff you keep bringing up? The whispers, stuff moving… It’s getting old.”

“Old? You think I’m making it up?”

“Yes! I don’t know what’s going on with you, but you need to let all this go. None of it is real. Just let it go and focus on us, on our life together. I’m sick of hearing about it.”

Her reaction stung. I hadn’t seen her that frustrated before, and as we argued, a tension settled between us. It was our first real argument, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something much deeper was happening.

That night, after lying awake, I finally drifted off to sleep, hoping things would settle in the morning. I finally fell asleep, only to wake up to the feeling of eyes on me. In the darkness, I could make out a figure standing next to the bed, staring down at me. It was Lily’s figure. Her face was covered in shadow, but I could hear her lips moving, whispering something just out of earshot. My heart pounded as I reached out, my voice barely a whisper. “Lily? What… what are you doing? What’s wrong?”

She didn’t answer. She continued to whisper, quiet and unsettling, and I felt a deep, crawling fear sink into my bones. The whispering grew faster, more urgently. Fumbling, I reached over and switched on the bedside lamp. Light flooded the room, and my heart nearly stopped when I realized Lily was lying next to me, fast asleep. No one else was there. The room was empty, silent, except for the faint sound of her breathing. There was no one next to my bed, no one whispering.

In the days that followed, a wall seemed to build between Lily and me. She grew colder, barely acknowledging me with anything more than a nod or a short answer. Her once warm smile and playful remarks were replaced with a distant, almost vacant expression. Every time I tried to break through, I felt like I was talking to a stranger.

Meanwhile, the strange events increased around the house, now not only in the dead of night but now in broad daylight. Shadows seemed to flicker at the edges of my vision, slipping away whenever I tried to look directly. And the whispers, the same unsettling, faint voices I had once heard only at night, now crept into my waking hours. They’d drift in and out, low and unintelligible, just enough to put my nerves on edge. Objects seemed to be shifting around, too. I’d leave my keys on the counter, only to find them on the coffee table moments later. Kitchen drawers would be rearranged; what was once our cutlery drawer became our junk drawer. What was once our plate cabinet became our Tupperware cabinet. I felt as the house itself was subtly working against me, trying to drive me insane.

Every strange thing left me more anxious, questioning my own sanity. Was I imagining things? I started doubting myself, my sanity, until, one afternoon, I heard it again, my name, whispered clear, and close. I spun around, expecting to find an empty room, but instead, I caught a glimpse of Lily’s face just before she darted out of sight, slipping around the corner of the hallway. My stomach twisted, and a wave of nausea hit me. What the hell was she doing, hiding around the corner and whispering my name?

I found her in the kitchen, casually chopping vegetables as though nothing had happened. “Lily,” I said, my voice strained. “What were you just doing?”

She looked up, feigning innocence. “What do you mean?”

“I just… saw you,” I stammered, trying to keep my voice steady. “You were whispering my name… hiding around the corner.”

She stared at me, a hint of amusement flickering in her eyes, but her expression was empty of any warmth. “Oh, David,” she said in a low, almost mocking tone. “I think you’re seeing things.”

Her words hung in the air, cold and dismissive, sending a chill down my spine. The way she looked at me, almost taunting, made my skin crawl. I opened my mouth to argue, to ask her why she was acting like this, but the look on her face stopped me. There was something so… unsettling in her gaze, like she was holding back something dark. As I turned and walked out of the kitchen, I could’ve sworn I heard a faint laugh come from her.

A new fear emerged in me. A feeling that somehow, just maybe, Lily had something to do with all the strange things happening around the house.

I tried to convince myself that maybe it wasn’t Lily; maybe there was something about the house itself that was warping her behavior. It was the only thing that made sense. She’d never acted this way before. She most definitely was not acting like the same person I had fallen in love with. I was determined to get answers.

I began by looking through the home’s deed and ownership history. Late at night, I sat at my computer, combing through property records. I found every sale, every name tied to the house. Oddly, it was short, a few owners here and there, but no gaps or missing entries. Every person who’d lived here had sold and left within a handful of years, but the reasons were normal. Nothing I found hinted at anything dark. No one had died in the house, nothing.

The house wasn’t especially old, either. It was built in the 1980s, with nothing more than a couple of renovations over the years. I started thinking maybe the land held some kind of dark secret, so I checked historical records. I combed through old property maps and records of ownership before the house was built, but all I saw was bland suburban history. The land had been nothing but an empty field and a minor farmland a century ago. No battle sites, no cemeteries, no tragedies marked on record. It seemed impossible that there was nothing here, nothing unusual to explain what I had been experiencing.

Growing desperate, I went to the library, combing through archived newspapers and town records. I looked for articles about the neighborhood, hoping for some small hint: a tragedy in a neighboring house, an unexplained death, anything. But all I could find were the usual town tidbits. A mayoral election, a local high school sports game, maybe a yard sale advertised on an old flyer.

I started diving into forums and paranormal sites late at night, reading stories about hauntings and researching symptoms and causes of cursed houses. I searched the house for any strange artifacts hidden in the crawlspace, looking for any ritual markings carved in the wood. I had even hired a professional while Lily was at work to do x-ray and ultrasound mapping of the walls and yard to find anything that may be hidden, body or otherwise. But again, nothing.

It felt like I was going mad. I’d poured over every lead, every scrap of information, and still, I had nothing to explain what was happening. And that’s when the doubt set in. Maybe it really was just my imagination. Maybe I had a lingering head injury from my crash. The lack of evidence left me with nothing but that answer. One evening, I sat Lily down and admitted to her that I thought I might be losing it. I was embarrassed, vulnerable, but she listened, patient and empathetic. She suggested seeing a psychologist and mentioned one she knew who did house calls.

The psychologist came by a few days later. He was calm and reassuring, his voice low and steady as we spoke in the living room. He asked about my sleep, stress levels, and any major life changes. I found myself unloading everything, the strange occurrences, Lily’s unsettling behavior, even the bizarre visions. He listened without judgment and offered to prescribe me some medication to ease my anxiety. I was hesitant, but out of desperation, I agreed to give it a try.

For a time, it seemed to work. I felt more grounded. The strange events faded into the background, and Lily seemed more herself, warm and easygoing, like she used to be. I felt like I could finally breathe, reassured that it all really had been my mind playing tricks on me. Life slowly crept back to normal, and I was relieved to think I’d found a solution. But as the days went on, things began to shift again, subtly at first.

One morning, I woke up and made my way down the hallway toward the kitchen, still drowsy and rubbing my eyes. As I approached, I heard low voices, Lily’s, unmistakably, but with a murmur that sounded like a man’s voice replying. I froze just outside the door, trying to make out the words, but they were muffled, secretive. I turned the corner, but Lily snapped back to cooking breakfast, alone at the stove as though nothing had happened.

“Who the hell were you just talking to?” I asked, my voice sounding a little too accusatory.

She shrugged. “I was just talking to myself. What’s wrong with you?”

The suspicion bubbled up again, more intense than ever. I didn’t press further, but from that day on, my trust in her began to fracture. I stopped taking the medication, hoping that it might sharpen my senses again. I began to feel it again, something dark and wrong within the house, and with Lily. I began to question if I should leave.

On my last day in the house, I was carrying a load of laundry down the hall, when something caught the corner of my eye in the bathroom. I thought I saw a reflection the mirror. *Maybe it's Lily behind the door, trying to scare me*, I thought. 

I paused, shifting the pile of clothes in my arms and backed up, peering inside. In the dim light of the mirror, I saw a reflection. There, standing just behind the half shut door, was a mangled figure. Its face was contorted, flesh torn and bruised, eyes vacant but fixed directly on me. Blood seeped down its jaw, dripping onto a chest split open and raw. I couldn’t look away, couldn’t even breathe.

Then, in a hoarse, deep voice, it said my name: “David…”

The clothes tumbled from my arms as I stumbled backward, my heart hammering. A scream ripped through me, loud and desperate, and then Lily rushed in, flipping on the hallway light.

“What the hell is wrong with you?” she demanded, her voice sharp. I pointed desperately toward the bathroom. The bathroom was empty, and the mirror was clear, but I couldn’t shake the image. I tried to explain, but she waved it off, her face tight with irritation. She seemed so cold, so detached, almost as if she were an entirely different person.

In that moment, something in me broke. I felt the hot sting of tears as I looked at Lily, really looked at her, and saw how empty she seemed. I could barely keep my voice steady.

“Lily… what happened to you? Why are you acting like this?” My voice cracked, a desperate plea. “What are you hiding from me? I know what I saw… I know what I’ve been hearing. And I think… I think you know it too.”

She looked at me, her expression unreadable, but something shifted in her eyes, something dark, cold, almost mocking. She tilted her head just slightly, her lips curling into a slow, unsettling smile.

“David,” she said, her voice low and eerily calm. “You’re just so tired… Why don’t you just rest? Stop worrying so much.”

 A chill ran down my spine, and goosebumps rose in my skin. In that moment, I knew I had to leave, to get as far away from her and the house as possible.

 That night, as I got in bed, I made up my mind. First thing in the morning, I would pack my things, find a hotel, and leave without looking back. I closed my eyes, forcing myself to sleep, but the unease gnawed at me, twisting knots of fear into my chest. But I also felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me, and I quickly drifted off to sleep.

Sometime in the middle of the night, a whisper broke the silence.

“David”

My eyes snapped open, heart pounding. The voice was right next to my ear, soft but insistent. I turned slowly and saw a shadowy figure by the bedside, hovering close. It was Lily again. Her head pointed down toward me, the rest of her figure outlined in the darkness.

Terrified, I quickly I reached over and desperately felt for the bedside lamp, flicking it on, I expected the figure to vanish as it always did. But it didn’t. Not this time. She was still standing there, staring, eyes wide and unblinking, her lips moving ever so slightly, whispering my name, “David… Daaaaviiiiiiid…”

My breath caught in my throat as I realized she wasn’t alone. Behind her, fully visible in the light, was the figure from the bathroom mirror, the mangled, bloodied apparition, its face a grotesque mask of agony and violence. Its eyes were hollow, yet I felt its gaze pierce right through me.

As I froze, paralyzed with terror, Lily leaned closer, still whispering, “Stay with us, David… stay with us…” Her voice grew softer, blending into a low, raspy tone that sounded distinctly wrong, too deep, almost inhuman. “Stay with me, David…”

The figure behind her moved, body crunching and contorting as it stepped closer. Lily’s voice morphed further, deepening into a man’s voice, repeating the words like a chant, “Stay with us, David… Stay with me… come on... stay with me”

I clutched the sheets, my heart pounding so loudly it drowned out the horrible voices in the room. I was frozen. I couldn't move. I couldn't scream.

My bedside lamp began to grow brighter, and I heard the bulb began to ring. Lily and the figure got closer, both now reaching out toward me in unison.

The room began to fall apart as the light grew brighter. The ringing of the lightbulb now turned into something else, like a rhythmic beeping. I felt like I was being pulled, and felt a flash of extreme pain.

“Stay with us, David, stay with us.” I opened my eyes weakly to the sight of lights flashing by, bright, and blinding. I felt a seer of pain and faces surrounding me and I was being rushed down a hallway, with a male doctor repeating the phrase to me. Everything went black again.

After some time, I woke up, finding myself in a hospital room with a doctor standing by my bed.

“Hello there, welcome back, we almost lost you.”

“Wha… what happened, where am I?” I managed to get out.

“You were in a car accident, truck hit you head-on. Damn son, you’re lucky to be alive. You’ve been in surgery and you’re stable now. You’re going to be alright. Go ahead and get some rest.” The doctor said.

“Where… where’s Lily?” I asked him.

“Is Lily a family member? Would you like us to call her?” he replied.

“She’s a nurse here, she’s... she's my girlfriend”

“No nurses named Lily here. Get some rest, you’re going to need it for your recovery.”

Over the following weeks, doctors and psychologists worked with me to put together the pieces. They explained that my brain had tried to shield me from the trauma of the accident and coma by creating an elaborate world to cope with the void. The term they used was “maladaptive daydreaming,” and something called “post-traumatic confabulation,” where the brain fills in gaps with constructed realities; places, people, entire lives, to help make sense of the trauma. They told me it was common for coma patients to create people or worlds in their minds, to anchor themselves to some form of reality, even if it was a fabrication. In my case, the creation was Lily. My brain had then constructed an antagonist, the house, the paranormal events, in an attempt to pull me back out.

At first, the revelations hit me like a physical blow. I felt the ground fall out beneath me, leaving only emptiness where she had been. I hadn’t just lost Lily; I’d lost the life we’d built, the home we’d created, the future I thought was waiting for us. No matter how terrifying things became in the end, there was a life there that felt real, a purpose, a love.

It has been 2 years since then. I have begun to rebuild my life, but the weight of that loss still clings to me, silent and unyielding. Friends and family urge me to move on, but I feel tethered to something that no one else can see. Every time I’d try to meet someone new, I’d feel the ghost of Lily beside me. Even though she wasn’t real, nothing could match the love I felt with her. That connection, imagined as it was, left a mark that no reality can seem to replace.

One doctor called it a “phantom limb” of the heart. The absence of her is something I feel as clearly as if she’d truly been there. Despite knowing she was never real, I still find myself longing for the love I’d had with her, even down to the fear, the mystery, the strange events. It was all something real to me. I still dream of her sometimes, her face still as clear as when I had known her. In my dreams, I’m back in our house, during those first few months when everything was perfect. And I always wake up, finding myself back here.
