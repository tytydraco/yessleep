I had a scary dream last night and i completely forgot about it until i turned my phone off and closed my eyes to go to bed, and now the visuals aren’t leaving my head. 
(Because i’ve been doing Uber eats a lot lately, i feel like when i’m going to sleep i’m still driving so i jump in my sleep. but that has nothing to do with the story) Last night i had a dream that i was delivering food alone at night time and i was dropping off an order at a neighborhood. (the ghetto)  and they were apartments. The type of apartments that have stairs indoors instead of outdoors to get to the apartments. In my dream it felt like the time was anywhere from 1am-3am. Doing deliveries at night time can get really lonely and you can feel it, when i walked in the doors i stood there and there were kids on the stairs that went down. I was above them by the entrance and i remember leaning over the stairs to look at them. I knew there were kids there i just couldn’t hear them move or even talk. By the energy of the place i knew something was off. I didn’t move at all, when i walked in the building i just stood by the door with the food in my hand, When i leaned over I saw 2 kids (age 5) 1 girl and 1 boy just ‘frozen’ into place looking up at me as if they wanted to cry but were too scared to. They seemed pale and their eyes wide. It seemed as if they saw something that scarred them for life and they knew it was bad they just didn’t know what to do. When i looked over at them i looked back at the bottom stair (that for some reason i didn’t pay attention to before) and that’s when i saw it. a little asian girls head with no body, bleeding out on the staircase, with long black hair. the eyes and mouth wide open, starring straight at me. The head was facing me and it looked alive. I felt in my body it was going to lunge up at me. Of course this is just a dream, it feels so weird to say but instead of saving those kids (and maybe even the head) i walked away, without taking my eyes off the head that laid on the stairs, and i left that place. Even in my dream my body was telling me that trying to save them was going to end up worse for me. I woke up feeling so weird and terrified. It’s (one of) the scariest dream i’ve ever had. And i don’t know why this scenario didn’t cross my mind until now, that i’m in bed at 1;57am trying to go to sleep. I wish someone knew the exact visual i saw in my dream, because they too would be terrified to see it again.
