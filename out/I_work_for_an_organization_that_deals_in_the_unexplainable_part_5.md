The Ash Mountain incident may be the most important event in the organization's history. If you tried to find information on it you wouldn’t be able to find it. ( at least to the event I’m referring to). When I joined the organization I work for it was one of many at the time that dealt with the unexplainable. The Ash Mountain incident caused the merging of several of the organizations to create the superpower I now work for. If I were to talk about the entirety of the incident in detail I could write an entire story just about that. Unfortunately, I was not there for the incident and was merely sent to deal with the aftermath. However, I can give a brief overview of the incident.

*The Ash Mountain Incident:*

*February 1st, 2014, 3:17 AM An unknown entity arrives through a hole producing a dark grey smoke in \*Unnamed\* National Park and is spotted by a fire tower Ranger. The ranger radios to another tower and both check on the Smoke. Upon arriving they are faced with the creature upon making contact one ranger solidifies into a grey statue. The second ranger touches the first causing him to turn into an ash cloud. Ranger retreats calling for local law enforcement. In the meantime, the creature begins making its way toward a nearby campground. One by one it begins turning people into ash statues. When local law enforcement arrived the creature how already turned 31 people into statues. Law enforcement engages the creature It turns 5 officers before it’s injured and pushed into a nearby fallout shelter where it remains.*

You just read the basic case info that anyone joining the organization can access, but the paragraph doesn’t prepare you for what the place looks like. In the following days, several organizations entered the fallout shelter to go after the creature. 11 days after the incident I was sent in. I wasn’t alone sent with two other agents, Trojan and Wolf. Trojan was already a level 1 field agent, Wolf was level 3 and I was still level 4. We were next up on the list to go after the creature and to prove our organization was on top. We arrived near the entrance of the fallout shelter. The people weren't the only things that were ash, Tree, flowers, grass anything living around the area had been turned into an ash statue. Like a raging forest fire had moved through the area. We made our way towards the bunker entrance. It was a large metal hatch on the ground.

“Looks like A cellar are we sure it’s a fallout shelter,” Wolf said he had a deep southern accent.

We lifted the Hatch.

“After you pretty lady,” Trojan said.

“HAHA you so funny,” I said heading down the ladder below the Hatch.

When I reached the bottom I yelled “I don’t see anyth-” My sentence was cut off by the Hatch slamming.

I flipped on my flashlight and began scanning around me the light scanning over the multiple ash statues of people. 

“Alright assholes open up,” I looked up only to see the ceiling was much shorter than it should’ve been and the hatch was gone.

I was alone amongst the ash statue I was sure that I would be the next to grace them. I was shocked by the amount of people down here, these were all members of organizations similar to what I worked for they were all experienced in this field. Yet they all were caught and killed by this creature. What scared me was their faces, the pure look of agony upon them. I could tell their death was painful and the way they died froze that look right into place. You could still smell the burnt skin and hair.

I found myself needing clarification with the fall-out shelter itself. It was an older design like something from the 50’s I wondered why it was so far out in the woods. The nearest town was more than 45 minutes away. A rich family owned part of the mountain and had for some time, way back before the 50s maybe they built it. The layout didn’t make sense most fallout shelters aren't entire facilities underground. But that’s what this was a facility. 

The long hallways were still powered by the faint light of dying lightbulbs. Like the place had been somewhat maintained, even through the cobwebs and dirt signs of life remained. One room I came across had a make-shift living space a bed made of cardboard. A lantern, blankets, old food, and water. Someone was living down here something other than the ash entity.  Whoever it was most likely taken by the entity. Just another statue among the rows of others.

The whole place seemed like something you’d dream about, like a maze. Hallways lead to nowhere, rooms that seemed pointless, and constantly ongoing. Between the dim light bulbs and my flashlight, I had a decent amount of light a welcome change to most of the cases I had been on. Of course that didn’t last long, suddenly my flashlight went out. The lightbulbs followed soon after. Now I was in complete darkness.

Darkness can do a lot to the human brain, when you are in complete darkness your body has no concept of time. In my head hours passed but I couldn’t tell you how long I was down there. On top of that, it’s not uncommon for governments to use it as a torture technique. When your brain has no sense of what it’s seeing it causes it to fill in the blanks. Isolation causes you to hallucinate, you add the two together, and you get a real shitty time.

Soon my head started playing tricks on me, and suddenly I could feel things moving around me. I tried talking myself out of it. Telling myself there wasn’t anything there, but the problem was something was down here with me. Something had to take the lights out in the first place. I had 36 bullets on me and 6 more in the gun. I could use that light to give a brief view of the room. But that came with risk, not much ammo and I could easily hit something, and the bullet could ricochet. I wayed it but the risk was worth it. I decided to shoot down the way I thought I came from. Bang one shot gone giving me such a brief glimpse of light. But it was enough to see the ash demon 20 feet away.

I didn’t know how quick it was or how easily it could kill me. It waited this long to attack me so something was stopping it. During the initial fight with police, it was rumored it was injured and that’s why it made its way to the shelter. Not many creatures you meet in this career fear firearms. But this one did, and that was the only advantage I had. I shot one more time where the creature had been seen. Just like I thought it was scared of the gun it retreated further into the darkness. The lights came back on once it was gone leading to the theory it was the one controlling the lights.

With the lights back on I reloaded my revolver and went back to freely roaming the facility. I’d been counting the ash statues 112 people dead. We were all sent in with barely any information. Sent to die so that the higher-ups could show each other had the bigger balls. But the naive me didn’t think that he was to focus on killing the creature for the glory of the organization. If I could go back now I slap that kid and tell him to move on with his life and that this wasn’t his calling. But no I’m that kid and I gotta live with my choices.

112 naive kids in there, and only through a miracle that I wasn’t 113. I saw it again staring at me from just beyond the light of the room. It didn’t take out the lights this time. I watched to figure out what it was thinking. I couldn’t make out the details besides what I had seen from the flash of my firearm earlier. Looked just like the ash statues around me but it was grey instead of black. I aimed the revolver at it and shot missing. It came at me dulling but not taking out the lights.

I choose not to fight but to run. Every once and a while I look back and shoot at it. It was quick but I had the speed advantage. I was going farther into the facility. I turned a corner a tripped over a statue it exploded into ash and I was on the ground it came at me. I shot it and hit its stomach, it was hurt but knocked the gun outta my hand. I was hopeless and just then the hatch opened above me. I hadn’t even realized I’d made it back to the entrance. The ash demon began to burn and burst into its ash cloud. It died that easily. The light was what hurt and I realized why it cut the lights in the first place. It didn’t come in here cause it was hurt just cause it was dark.

I looked up to see Trojan and Wolf, I was covered in ash. 

“Did you kill it,” Wolf said.

“Kinda.”

They took me out of there, I couldn’t wait to shower and get all the ash off of me. Trojan stopped though to get me something to eat. I was down there for 3 hours. So he figured I must be hungry. He handed me some cheese fries. When I looked down at them some ash fell from my hair right into. Then looking at the black dust I couldn’t figure out if it was human or the creature.

“I don’t think I’m hungry,” I said looking at my food.

Trojan looked at it too.

“What you scared of some pepper,” Wolf said trying to make a joke outta it.

Trojan liked the joke and for the rest of the ride, they began calling me Pepper. Guess the name just stuck. I hate that name.
