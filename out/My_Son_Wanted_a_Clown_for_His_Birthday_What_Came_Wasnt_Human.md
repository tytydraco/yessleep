I wouldn’t say I’m the best of dads, but I try. I really do. Especially for my children… especially for my son. He looks up to me like I hung the stars. It scares me sometimes; how much he watches me. How much he mirrors me.

My own upbringing wasn’t exactly ideal. My father was... absent, mostly. In and out. Never in one place long enough to matter. Never involved enough to remember birthdays or bedtime stories. I spent most of my childhood waiting for a man who never really showed up.

Now, I run a successful PR firm. Big clients. Big contracts. Big house in the suburbs. Picture-perfect wife. Beautiful kids. A life that looks polished from the outside. Shiny. Clean.

But the cracks are there.

A couple of days ago, my wife leaned in from across the kitchen island and said casually, “Your son’s birthday is tomorrow. Have you thought about any entertainment yet?”

It was like a cold wind slipped down my spine.

“Oh heck... I haven’t, honey. I completely forgot.”

She didn’t answer at first. Just gave me that look. The kind of look that says more than words ever could. Then she turned and muttered, almost to herself, “Am I the only present parent?”

The guilt sank in immediately. Heavy. Familiar.

His birthday… was tomorrow.

That’s when it hit me, hard. I was becoming my father. That same drifting shadow. The one thing I swore I’d never be.

So, I left for work, phone in hand, frantically googling last-minute clowns, magicians—anything. But everything was booked. Solid. No one was free.

Really? *All* of them?

Were clowns seriously that in demand?

I parked my car in the driveway and just sat there for a minute, the engine ticking as it cooled. My fingers gripped the steering wheel. I needed to fix this. Today. No more putting things off like my old man. My son deserved better.

By the time I reached the office, the elevator smelled like burnt coffee and that lemon-scented floor cleaner the janitors used. I barely noticed. My *mind was buzzing*….party hats, cakes, clown rentals, balloon animals. I had to line something up.

The elevator dinged on my floor. Just before I stepped out, Mark slipped in, coffee in one hand, tablet in the other.

“Hey, man,” he said, raising his brows. “You look like hell. Everything okay?”

“It’s Liam’s birthday tomorrow,” I muttered. “Completely forgot to book entertainment. No clown. No nothing. I’m scrambling.”

Mark chuckled, slapping my shoulder. “Classic dad move. So what are we thinking; pony rides? Fire breathers? Or do we just roll out the ol’ iPad and hope for the best?”

“Come on, man. I’m serious. Know anyone?”

He shook his head, grinning. “I’ve got two left feet and crippling social anxiety. You don’t want me around kids. Sorry, can’t help you.”

“Useless,” I said with a smirk as we stepped off. “You’re lucky your daughter likes you.”

“Yeah, yeah. Good luck finding a clown on 24 hours’ notice.” He peeled off toward his own office.

I sat in mine for about an hour, shuffling through emails and going through the motions, but my brain wasn’t there. My phone’s search history had become a desperate list of terms like *last-minute birthday clown*, *kids party magician now*, *PR dad failure*. Nothing new. Nothing available.

I had a client meeting downstairs just before noon. Same building, just one floor down in the glass conference room. On my way back, my head buried in my notes, I bumped into someone.

“Oh….*sorry, man*,” I said, backing up quickly.

The janitor looked up at me. Old guy. Pale skin. Blue coveralls. He had one of those rubber gloves half-hanging out of his back pocket and a mop handle resting lightly against the wall.

“Birthday party?” he said suddenly.

I blinked. “Uh… sorry?”

“For your son,” he said, a slow grin creeping across his face. “You’re looking for a clown, right?”

Something inside me froze. “How did you…?”

He pointed upward with a greasy thumb. “Heard you and your buddy talking. Thin walls in that elevator.”

“Oh,” I said. “Right. Yeah. You wouldn’t happen to…..?”

“I know just the guy,” he interrupted. That grin of his stayed in place. Wide. Wrong. “Old-school type. Real classic. Kids love him. Always available, too.”

Before I could say anything else, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, crumpled card. It wasn’t even laminated. Just a torn piece of yellow paper with a number written in sharp red ink.

No name. No logo. Just the digits.

He placed it in my hand like it was fragile.

“Give him a call,” he said. “He never disappoints.”

“Thanks,” I said, still caught off guard. “You…uh….you work here long? I don’t think I’ve seen you around.”

But he was already walking away, mop in hand, disappearing around the corner.

I stood there for a moment, watching the empty hallway, the card still in my hand. I should’ve asked his name. Maybe I should’ve been more polite. I worked in PR, after all….keeping track of people is part of the job.

Still… something about him felt off. Like a face you only see once in a dream and never forget.

But I had a number now. Maybe a solution. And if this guy came through, well... maybe I owed the creepy janitor a beer.

Or a raise.

I wrapped up at the office just as the sky started turning orange, the end-of-day glow stretching across the city like it was holding its breath. I didn’t waste any time. Drove straight to the biggest toy store in town and loaded a cart with everything that screamed "guilt money." Remote control cars, action figures, a Lego set big enough to bankrupt me twice. I didn’t even check prices. I just grabbed what looked shiny and loud and fun.

Part of me still didn’t want to call that clown.

The janitor’s words rang in my mind the entire time I stood in the checkout line.  
*"He never disappoints."*

That smile. That **teeth-too-many** kind of smile.

I kept the card tucked in my wallet like it might poison me through the fabric.

He was my last resort. A backup plan for a promise I should’ve made weeks ago.

By the time I got home, it was dark. The porch light flickered once as I turned the key. Inside, the scent of cinnamon and fabric softener hit me like a hug. Home.

I barely had time to put the gifts down before Liam ran up the hallway in his rocket pajamas, arms wide open.

“Daaaad!” he shouted, slamming into me with full six-year-old force. “Is the clown coming tomorrow?!”

I knelt and wrapped my arms around him, feeling his excitement pulsing through every hug and every bounce of his little feet.

“Hey, champ!” I ruffled his hair. “That’s a surprise. You’ll just have to wait and see, alright?”

He grinned, eyes sparkling.

“You should be in bed right now,” I added with mock sternness. “It’s way past your bedtime, okay?”

“Okay, Dad!” he chirped, already half-turning down the hallway.

He didn’t even wait for a goodnight kiss. Just zipped back to his room like he’d explode if he didn’t fall asleep fast enough to get to tomorrow.

I stood there in the foyer a moment longer, the Superman-wrapped presents glinting under the ceiling light.

As I was laying the last of the Superman-wrapped gifts near the living room table, I heard her footsteps.

My wife came around the corner, tired eyes, hair tied up, hoodie hanging off one shoulder. She kissed me on the cheek more habit than affection and asked quietly, “Did you get the clown?”

I looked away.

“Everything’s booked,” I muttered. “I don’t know what to do.”

She sighed. That kind of sigh that makes your stomach twist before the words even hit.

“You had *weeks*, Michael,” she said, arms crossed. “Weeks to figure this out. It’s like you *want* to disappoint him.”

“That’s not fair,” I replied, half-heartedly.

“No?” she snapped. “Then what would you call forgetting his birthday entertainment until the *night before*? You think buying him a stack of toys makes up for that?”

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. She was right.

She shook her head slowly. “You promised me you’d do better. That you wouldn’t turn into your father.”

That one hit harder than I expected.

Then she turned, without another word, and went upstairs. The sound of the bedroom door clicking shut might as well have been a coffin lid.

I sat there for a long time. Staring at the floor. My reflection warped in the gloss of the wooden tiles. I *was* a terrible father. No arguing that now.

It was 10:00 PM when I stepped outside for a smoke. The air was cool, still. Even the streetlights seemed dimmer than usual.

I reached into my wallet.

Pulled out the crumpled card.

Stared at the number, my thumb hovering over the screen.

I had no idea who I was inviting into my home. But Liam… *Liam wanted magic.*

And I was out of options.

I dialed.

The phone rang *once*.

Then a rasping voice came through….*gritty and wet*, like someone dragging glass over wet concrete.

***“You’ve reached him.”***

“…Uh. Hey. I was told you do birthday parties.”

Silence….Then  
  
***“How old is the boy?”***

“Six,” I replied slowly.

***“Good age. Still soft.”***

My throat tightened.

“Excuse me?”

No answer, only muffled breathing….”*You were saying?”*

“You….uh, you come highly recommended. Can you make it tomorrow?”

**“Address?”**

It’s 438 Willow Bend Lane, Cresthill Meadows.  Twelve ‘O Clock. Our house. Please don’t be late.”

A low chuckle bled through the line.

***“I am never late. And never early. I arrive when I’m needed most.”***

The line went dead.

No goodbye. No confirmation. Just the hollow click of a call cut short.

The morning came like any other. Sunlight streamed through the curtains, birds chirped in the garden. Normal. Too normal.

We decorated the backyard…streamers, balloons, even some makeshift graffiti banners that said “Super Liam” in big red letters. My wife lit the candles on a gorgeous blue and red cake shaped like a superhero mask. It was perfect.

But I didn’t care about any of it.

My eyes kept drifting to the front gate.

*Waiting.*

*Watching.*

Noon rolled around. The yard filled with laughter and bright little voices. Liam’s friends arrived, their parents trailing behind with gift bags and juice boxes. Music played from the speakers. Everything *looked* like a dream.

But Liam kept glancing at me. Searching the yard. Searching faces.

*The clown hadn’t come*.

Twelve-thirty. Still nothing.

His smile began to fade.

I checked my phone. Tried calling the number again.

Nothing. Just static. Then silence.

I felt sick.

And just when I was ready to break down and tell Liam the clown wasn’t coming, the doorbell rang.

I opened it.

There stood *Mark*….wearing a baggy clown suit and smeared face paint, holding a balloon sword and grinning like an idiot.

His daughter peeked out from behind him.

“Surprise, asshole,” he said. “I figured you were balls deep in failure by now.”

Behind me, Liam let out a scream of pure joy. All the kids gathered around Mark like he was Santa in greasepaint.

He juggled, made balloon animals, tripped over his own shoes. The works. Even my wife cracked a smile.

It was a good party.

Until the music faded and the parents started collecting their sugar-crazed children.

As Mark helped fold the last table, I pulled him aside.

“Hey, listen… thanks. Seriously. You saved me today.”

He nodded. “Yeah. I could see the panic in your face yesterday. I threw something together with some old Halloween gear.”

I blinked. “Wait…..what?”

“Yesterday,” I repeated. “I called you last night. The voice. That creepy-ass whisper. You asked for my address.”

Mark furrowed his brow.

“Dude… what? You didn’t call me. I just showed up because your wife texted me that you were losing it.”

My mouth went dry. “So you didn’t… you didn’t talk to me on the phone?”

“No?” He gave me a weird look. “I hate clowns.” He laughed nervously. “Why? Did I sound creepy or something?”

I didn’t answer.

Because in that moment, the realization struck me cold.

*Mark wasn’t the one I spoke to last night.*

Then who was?

And where was *he*?

The sun had long dipped below the horizon, leaving behind the last gold streaks fading into purple. The backyard was a mess….balloons popped, paper plates scattered, and half-melted cake left out on the table. But the laughter had been real. The smiles genuine.

The party, somehow, had been a success.

After the last guest waved goodbye and the door clicked shut, I carried Liam upstairs. He was half-asleep, cheek resting against my shoulder, still clutching the balloon sword Mark gave him.

I tucked him into bed, pulling the covers up to his chin.

He blinked sleepily at me. “Dad…”

“Yeah, buddy?”

“Today was… *awesome*.” He yawned. “You didn’t forget, right?”

I smiled, brushing his hair back. “Forget what? Your big day? Never.”

He reached up, small fingers curling around mine. “You're the best dad ever.”

That hit harder than any guilt ever could. I leaned down and kissed his forehead.

“Sleep tight, Super Liam.”

“Night, Dad.”

I turned off the light and gently closed his door behind me, standing there for a moment in the dark hallway, just breathing.

Then I made my way to our bedroom.

My wife was already under the covers, scrolling through her phone. She looked up when I entered, set the phone aside, and opened her arms. I slid into bed beside her, and she pulled me close.

“Don’t worry,” she whispered, resting her head against mine. “We’re a team. We got through it.”

I exhaled. “Yeah… it just bugs me. The clown. The one I *actually* called… he never showed.”

She shifted to face me.

“What time did you tell him to come?”

“Twelve o’clock. Noon.”

She raised a brow, a teasing smile creeping in. “Maybe he thought you meant twelve a.m.”

I blinked. “Midnight? What kind of children’s birthday party happens at *midnight*?”

She laughed softly. “Who knows? Maybe he’s just old-school. Or maybe you hired a vampire clown.”

I chuckled, but something about her joke felt just a little too close to something I didn’t want to think about.

“Don’t think too hard about it,” she murmured, eyes already fluttering closed. “The birthday was saved. Your son thinks you’re a hero. End of discussion.”

I leaned over and kissed her.

“Thanks for helping me pull it off,” I said quietly.

She just smiled sleepily and pulled the blanket over her shoulder.

I lay back, staring at the ceiling for a while, my thoughts drifting to that crumpled card still in my wallet… and the voice on the other end of the line.

And somewhere far off….maybe in my bones….*I felt something shifting.* But I closed my eyes And let sleep take me.

I woke to the sound of footsteps outside our bedroom door.

My eyes shifted to the clock.

**12:00 AM.**

Right on the dot.

For a second, I thought I imagined it. Maybe it was the wind. A tree branch. Some part of the house settling.

Then I heard it again; slow, deliberate steps on the hallway floor.

I reached over instinctively. My hand found my wife's arm. Still asleep. Breathing gently.

So then… who was out there?

Burglar.

That was my first thought. Someone trying to break in.

I rolled out of bed silently and opened the dresser drawer. My fingers wrapped around the cold steel of the handgun I kept locked away for emergencies. Safety off. Finger alongside the trigger.

I crept down the hallway, every creak of the wooden floor like thunder under my feet. The living room was empty. So was the den. I swept the front door—locked.

I moved into the kitchen.

That’s when I saw them.

*Muddy footprints.*

Not mine.

Too small to be mine. But too large to be Liam’s.

They trailed across the tiles and stopped near the refrigerator. Then nothing.

I took another step…..

And a **scream** shattered the silence.

High-pitched. Raw. Agonizing.

**“DADDY!!!”**

My heart seized.

It was Liam.

I sprinted down the hallway to his room. The door wouldn’t budge.

It was **locked**.

“LIAM!” I shouted. “Open the door, baby! It’s Daddy!”

No answer—just muffled sobs from the other side.

I didn’t hesitate.

**BANG!**

I fired at the knob. The wood splintered. I kicked it open.

The room was empty.

The window was wide open.

Curtains fluttering in the cold night air.

I rushed to the sill and looked outside.

Down in the backyard….barely visible in the moonlight….. I saw something that stopped my breath.

**A figure.** In a bright **white costume**. Dragging my son by the leg across the grass. Toward the trees. Toward the dark.

“LIAM!” I screamed, stumbling back from the window and tearing through the house to the back door.

I fumbled with the lock and burst into the yard barefoot, the grass cold and wet beneath me.

**“DADDDDY!”** his voice cried again, echoing through the night.

I ran.

I ran like I had never run before, lungs burning, heart pounding in my ears.

But the laughter…

That laughter.

It started low. Almost playful.

Then it twisted into something *feral*.

It grew fainter, deeper into the woods, until it vanished completely....like it was swallowed by the night.

And suddenly, everything was silent.

I slowed, panting, eyes darting in every direction.

And then I saw it.

Right at the edge of the forest.

**A red clown nose.**

Lying in the dirt.

Beside it…..**Liam’s Spider-Man pajama shirt.**

*Torn. Blood on the collar.*

There was something pinned to it. A piece of yellow paper. Same texture as the card from before.

It read:

*“Thank you for the invitation.*

*He smiled just like you said he would.”*

 

By the time I stumbled back to the house, my wife was on the front lawn, screaming into the phone. I could already see the flicker of red and blue lights washing over the street.

The cops questioned me.

I told them **everything**.

The clown.

The card.

The janitor.

The voice on the phone.

They exchanged looks like I was delirious. One of them gently patted my shoulder and said, “We’ll do our best, sir.”

I wanted to scream.

My wife didn’t say anything to me that night.

She just sat on the couch, rocking, sobbing, blaming herself… then blaming me.

But she was right.

*It was my fault.*

I went to work the next morning.

Not to work.

To find the janitor.

The man who handed me that cursed card.

I asked security. HR. Maintenance.

They pulled up the building’s employee registry.

No one by that description.

I stared at the blank hallway near the elevator where I met him, and for a moment, I could almost hear the squeak of his mop again.

**Months passed.**

My wife stopped looking at me.

First, it was subtle. Eyes that once lingered now passed over me like I was furniture. Then she stopped sleeping next to me. She claimed the couch at first said it helped her back. Eventually, she stopped being my wife altogether.

Two weeks after the funeral…..*if you could even call it that….* she moved out. Left behind her keys, her ring, and a silence that settled into the corners of the house like dust.

The detectives arrived on a Thursday. Rain fell in sheets, streaking down the glass and pooling at their feet when I opened the door. I remember one of them tall, hollow-eyed refused to look me in the face. The other held a file to his chest like a shield.

They had found something. *Remains.*

Deep in the woods. *Scattered.*

*DNA confirmed it.*

They told me with measured words and soft tones, voices wrapped in caution like I was fragile. Like I might break. I didn’t say anything. I just stared at the floor. And the sound of the rain filled everything else.

*It’s been over a year now.*

Sometimes, I still wake up at midnight.

Eyes wide, breath caught, heart thudding like it knows something I don’t. In that fragile moment between sleep and reality, I let myself hope.....just for a second.....that it was all a nightmare. That none of it really happened. That I’ll pad downstairs and find my world whole again.

But the footprints are still there.

Tiny, muddy impressions trailing across the kitchen floor. I’ve scrubbed them more times than I can count. Bleach. Vinegar. Baking soda. On my knees until they bruised. But no matter what I do, they always return. Smudged. Wet. Fresh.

And sometimes, when the wind dies down and the night holds its breath, I hear laughter.

Soft. High-pitched. Childlike. Coming from the woods just beyond the edge of our yard. It never lasts more than a moment, but it freezes me in place every time. I don’t dare go looking.

I don’t own a phone anymore. I haven’t in years.

But I kept the card.

It’s old now. Worn around the edges. The ink has begun to fade, and there’s a crease right through the middle where I must’ve clutched it too tightly.

Still, I carry it with me. In my wallet. Always.

Just in case.

In case one day, I work up the nerve to call him back. The clown.

*And ask what he did with the smile I used to see on my son’s face.*
