I hope this reaches you and I hope I'm still alive by the time it does.

I know I didn't update in some time. There's a good reason for that. That reason being the fact that I'm currently hiding. 

Let's start from the beginning. 

A lot of you advised me to stop eating my "husband's" breakfasts. At this point I'm going to have to find him a nickname, because I am so sick and tired of referring to him as "my husband". Can we go with The Impostor? Yeah, that sounds good.

Ok, so... I read your advice and absolutely, I thought it was a great idea. What I didn't anticipate was the amount of suspicion it was going to bring upon me.

The day after my last post, I woke up in the morning to the smell of bacon, eggs and toast. I closed my eyes and sighed, bracing myself to what was coming. 

I got up, put on my slippers and headed for the kitchen, where the Impostor had my breakfast ready as per usual. I gave him my best fake smile and said "good morning honey!" to which he replied in the same fashion. I looked at the breakfast and said "oh, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to eat today... I'm feeling a bit nauseated". He stared at me. There was a long silence that I decided to break by saying "I'm sorry babe". 

He just sat there in silence for what felt like an eternity, staring at me. I was about to break the silence again when he sighed deeply and said "not this shit again...".

-Huh? What do you mean? - I asked, visibly confused.

-You found it, didn't you?

-I found... What exactly?

I knew damn well what he was talking about, but I did my best to feign ignorance. Apparently it worked, because he stared at me briefly, uncrossed his arms and said

-Well... Nevermind. I'm still sleepy, don't mind me.

He unlocked his wheelchair and I asked what was he doing. He answered 

-You're not leaving home without breakfast. I'm preparing you some tea at least.

-Don't worry, I'll do it - I said, in hopes he would leave it at that.

-I said - he lowered his voice - *I* will do it. Go get dressed.

-But...

-I said go!

Not sure if it was the fact that he was clearly mad or the fact I hadn't heard him yell at me for 20 years, but this made me shiver and whimper. I thanked him and went away to get dressed, knowing fully well I'd have to drink the tea.

At least at this point it was fairly clear to me you guys were right. It was also extremely clear I wouldn't be able to skip breakfast. 

I left to work while giving my best act of "everything is fine".

On my way to work, I called my boss. Told her I had some important stuff to do and I'd come in later. I also told her if anyone calls asking for me, tell them I'm working but I'm busy. She understood in my voice something was seriously wrong and ended the call with "please, stay safe".

I drove to the police station and parked behind it, in an alley away from the eyes of the crowd. Even though I knew he was in a wheelchair, I couldn't shake the feeling he was going to follow me. I didn't know how, but I just had this gut feeling, you know?

I entered the station and looked around. I couldn't see the officer I had talked to last time. 

-Can I help you ma'am?

-Huh... Yes. I was looking for officer... Atkins?

-Oh, Oliver Atkins? Sure, wait here ma'am. Atkins!

The man I had talked to previously approached with a smile. I sighed in relieve.

-Hey there Mrs. Smith! What can I do for you?

-Hello officer. I... I need your help. Can we talk somewhere more private?

Officer Atkins looked at me with a serious face as his ever-lasting smile faded away.

-Come with me.

I followed him to a small room in the back. It was something between a meeting room and an interrogation room. It had only a desk and two chairs, one on each side, no windows, but a very normal door, which didn't strike me as the entrance of a place they'd put criminals in.

Atkins motioned me to sit and sat in front of me. 

-So Mrs. Smith. You're safe here. What can I help you with?

-This might be hard to believe. Trust me, I've been trying to wrap my head around it for some days too...

-Is it about that man who lives with you?

I froze in place. I wasn't expecting that. 

-Well... Yes.

Atkins looked at me and sighed. 

-Ma'am, I won't lie to you. And don't take this as a judgement. But when I saw that man at your house right after Jim died, I had a weird feeling. You didn't strike me as someone who would move on that fast and you were devastated at the funeral. And then, not even a week later, you give up Elisa for adoption and this guy moves in...

-ADOPTION? - I'm not sure what my face looked like, but he looked frightened.

-Y... Yes ma'am... Don't you remember?

I realized I was now up and stiff as a log. I looked around in confusion and then succumbed back down to my chair.

-I... I don't remember... I don't remember anything... I... I...

At this point I was sobbing. Atkins got up to try to comfort me. 

-I... Think he's been drugging me... I thought he was Jim...

Atkins stopped comforting me out of shock. 

-Wait... What? Jim is dead! How could it be Jim? What led you to think that?

I took a few deep breaths trying to compose myself. When I could finally talk, I explained everything I explained you guys so far. The breakfasts, the death certificate, what I remember, what I apparently don't, everything.

Atkins sat on his chair, trying to process what I had just told him.

-Ma'am, I... Can I call you Allison?

-Of course.

-Allison, that's a lot. And I don't think I can help you as an officer. The obvious procedure here would be to take you to be evaluated by a psychiatrist and you would likely be sent to an unit for treatment...

-Oh my God... Please don't... - I pleaded.

-Of course not. Call me crazy, but I believe you. Hell, this could cost me my job, but I do. And I think you're in danger. Did it occur to you this man might be Jim's killer? I mean, that would explain why we can't find him.

I told him the truth: it did. It would make perfect sense. Being at home all the time, nobody being aware of his identity... According to Atkins they did look into him as a suspect, but he had a pretty strong alibi: he was at the hospital.

-Ok Allison, here's what we're going to do: go home after work, I'll go there later today about an anonymous tip. Act surprised. I'll try my best to see if he let's me check the house. Then we'll see how it plays out.

I agreed, thinking to myself it was a shabby plan but still, it was the best I had. 

As I was leaving, I heard Atkins yell "Allison, get down!"

Across the door, came a bullet. I looked ahead to see where it came from... To see the Impostor standing, fully capable, his gun pointing at me.
