I have a wife and a seven years old daughter. I love them more than anything. Every morning, I make my daughter pancakes, and I let her put on way too much syrup. Every evening, I kiss my wife and tell her about my boring day at the office. I am a normal, boring, loving husband and father. And I have built this life, brick by boring brick, as a fortress against the man I came from. And i want you to know that my entire existence is a reaction to him, and my greatest fear, is that one day... I will become my father.

And now, I think it’s happening.

My father was a hard man. He came from a long line of hard men who worked with their hands and believed the all existence will bend the knee to them by mere force. He worked in construction, and he carried the hardness of his work into our home. Our house was his property, my mother and me were his property too. He told us this, often.

“You belong to me,” he’d say, his voice a low, rumbling threat. “This family, this bloodline… it will not be weak. You will be made in my image.”

To him, pain is the way to bend anything to your well. When I was eight, I got a B+ on a math test. He took off his belt, and the lesson I learned that night had nothing to do with long division. It was about the sting of leather on skin, the hot shame, the metallic taste of blood in my mouth, and to be frank i never got another B+.

When I was twelve, I wanted to quit the soccer team. I wasn’t the best player, and the coach was a screamer just like him. My father’s response was simple. He locked the pantry and the refrigerator. “The strong eat,” he said, sitting at the dinner table, eating his own steak while I watched. “The weak learn to be strong.” I didn’t eat for two days. I didn’t quit the team.

My mother tried. In the beginning, she was a buffer, a soft place to land. She’d tend to my bruises, sneak me food when he was out. But years of his cruelty eroded her. She became quiet, jumpy, a ghost in her own home. The beatings weren't just for me. A dish dropped, dinner five minutes late, a glance he misinterpreted as defiance....anything was a reason. I’d lie in my bed at night, listening to the muffled thumps from their bedroom, my hands clenched into fists under the covers, hating him with a purity that felt holy. Hating him for his cruelty, and hating her, just a little, for enduring it.

When I was sixteen, she left. She packed a single bag while he was at work and just… disappeared. She didn’t leave a note. She didn’t say goodbye. She didn’t look back, not even for the son she was leaving alone with the monster. I can’t blame her. Not really. You can only live in a warzone for so long before you flee. But her absence created a vacuum, and his attention fell solely on me, and the forging intensified.

The day I turned twenty one, I left, too. I walked out with a backpack and two hundred dollars to my name. He stood on the porch, his arms crossed over his thick chest. He didn’t try to stop me.

“The world will break you,” he said, his voice flat. “And you’ll come crawling back. You’re my son. You can’t escape what you are.”

I didn’t look back. I swore to myself that day that he was wrong. I would not be him. I would be kind. I would be gentle. I would build a life so full of love and warmth that it would burn away his shadow.

And for ten years, I thought I had succeeded. I met a wonderful woman. We got married. We had a beautiful daughter. I built my fortress. I was safe.

Then, three weeks ago, the call came.

It was a hospice nurse. Her voice was .... detached. My father was dying. He had Lung cancer, and it was aggressive and fast. He didn’t have much time. And he was asking for me.

"its his final wish."

she said

My first, my decision was absolute : No. Good. Let him die alone. Let him face his end without the son he tried to break. Let him rot. The hatred, which I had thought I’d buried, was still there, hot and alive.

I told my wife I wasn’t going. I saw the look on her face, it was not a judgment, but a deep, sad understanding.

“I know what he did to you,” she said softly, taking my hand. “And you don’t owe him a thing. But… our daughter. She’s never met her grandfather. Maybe… maybe this is the only chance she’ll ever have. Not for him. For her. So one day she can know where half of her comes from.” She paused. “And maybe for you, too. So you can see him as just… a dying old man. So you can finally let him go.”

Her kindness is my greatest weakness. She was right. I was doing it for her, and for our little girl. I was doing it to prove, once and for all, that I was not my father. A kind man sees his dying parent, no matter what they’d done.

The hospice was a quiet, sterile place that smelled of bleach and fading hope. He was in a private room. When I walked in, I barely recognized him. The man who had been a titan of muscle and rage, a roaring fire that had consumed my childhood, was now just… a pile of sticks under a thin white blanket. His skin was yellow and translucent, his breathing a shallow, wet rattle. All the strength, all the power, was gone. All that was left was the hardness in his eyes.

He saw me, and a flicker of something passed over his face. Not joy. Not relief. Something else. Recognition.

I stood by the bed, my wife and daughter waiting nervously in the hallway. I didn’t know what to say. “You wanted to see me,” was all I could manage.

He coughed, a dry, rattling sound. “The girl,” he rasped, his voice a ghost of its former power. “Is she strong?”

“She’s happy,” I said, my voice cold.

He held my gaze. “Not the same thing.” He was quiet for a long time, his eyes searching my face. Then he said the words I never thought I’d hear. “I’m sorry.”

The words hung in the air, heavy and strange. I waited. For the excuses. For the justifications. They didn’t come.

“I’m sorry,” he repeated, his voice barely a whisper. “For what I did. And… for what will happen.”

“What does that mean?” I asked, a strange knot of dread tightening in my stomach. “What’s going to happen?”

He tried to smile, but it was just a grimace of pain. He reached out a trembling, skeletal hand and gripped my wrist. His skin was cold, but his grip had a shocking, wiry strength.

“It’s a full circle, son,” he whispered, his eyes boring into mine. “We all end as we began. It’s just… the way of things.”

And that was it. His eyes lost their focus. The hand gripping my wrist went limp. He made A long, final rattle from his chest, and then he was still. He was gone.

The funeral was a small, awkward affair. A few of his old work buddies, a distant cousin. I said the words you’re supposed to say. I accepted the condolences. And then I went home, feeling… empty. I didn’t feel relief. I didn’t feel closure. I just felt… hollow.

The first week was normal. But then, I started to notice things. Small things.

It started with my hand. I was washing dishes, and I noticed a strange, dry patch on the back of my hand. I looked closer. It wasn’t just dry skin. It was a fine, web-like pattern of cracks, like a drying riverbed. I put lotion on it, but it didn’t help. The next day, the patch was larger.

Then, it was my eyes. I’ve always had my mother’s eyes. A light, warm hazel. One morning, I was brushing my teeth, and I looked in the mirror and I froze. My eyes weren’t hazel anymore. They were a cold, steely, unforgiving grey. They were my father’s eyes.

I stumbled back from the sink, my heart pounding. It was a trick of the light. It had to be. I spent the next hour flicking the bathroom light on and off, moving to different rooms, staring at my reflection in windows and spoons. It wasn’t a trick. They were grey. They were his.

My temper started to fray. I was always a patient man. But I found myself snapping. My wife asked me a simple question about a bill, and I bit her head off. My daughter spilled her juice, and I yelled at her, my voice so sharp and loud it made her cry. The moment the words were out of my mouth, I was horrified. I would apologize, profusely. I’d hug them, tell them I was sorry, that I was just tired, stressed from my father’s death. They were forgiving. But it kept happening. This core of cold, hard anger was growing inside me, an invasive weed in the garden of the life I’d so carefully cultivated.

The breaking point, the moment that sent me here, to you, happened last night. My daughter brought home a drawing from school. It was a picture of our family. Me, my wife, her. She’d gotten a gold star on it. She was so proud. I told her it was wonderful. Then she showed me a math worksheet from her backpack. She’d gotten two questions wrong.

Something inside me snapped. The disappointment I felt was irrational, outsized, and it was not my own. It was his.

I heard myself speaking, but the voice felt like it was coming from someone else. “This is not good enough,” I said, my voice low and cold. I tapped the paper, my finger jabbing at the red X’s. “Two wrong? Two? I don’t raise daughters who make mistakes. I don’t allow for weakness. You will be the best. You will not fail. You will be made in my image.”

The words hung in the air, echoing in the quiet kitchen. My daughter’s face crumpled. Tears streamed down her cheeks. My wife just stared at me, her face a mask of shock and a dawning, terrible fear.

And I stared back, horrified. Because I had just spoken my father’s creed. The poison I had spent my entire life running from had just poured from my own lips.

I ran to the bathroom and locked the door. I looked in the mirror. My father’s grey eyes stared back at me, full of a cold fire. The cracks on my hand had spread up my arm, a network of fine, grey lines. And my hair… my hairline was receding, thinning at the crown, in the exact pattern as his.

It’s a full circle. We end as we began.

I’m so scared. I’m scared of what I’m becoming. Most of all, I’m terrified of what I’ll do to my family when there’s nothing left of me. I look at my daughter, and I see the fear in her eyes when I walk into a room. And that’s how I know the forging has already begun.

Please. Is there anyone out there who knows what this is? A curse? A possession? Is there a way to fight it? A way to stop the circle from completing? I built a fortress of love to keep him out, but he was inside me all along. And he’s finally breaking through the walls.
