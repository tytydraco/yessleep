Part one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1htk3sm/the_lavender_room_part_i/).

I had no idea how long it had been since I had started working at the Lavender room. What I did know however, was that I had been drinking far too much. The revelation came on a day when I hadn't taken a shot before leaving my room for my shift dealing cards to the regulars. Occasionally a new face would come through the doors and I would want to tell them to run, to put as much distance between them and the building and themselves as they could, but my throat seemed to seal up, and my lips would freeze in a professional smile.

It didn't matter that my cheeks were tired and sore, the muscles of my face refused to relax. I also found that I was unable to say anything that was not related to whatever game I was working that night as long as I was on the clock. When iit was my day off, I seemed to have more free will but still found myself unable to say anything negative about the place. I also had no desire to leave. I began to wonder if everyone who lived and worked at the place had the same issues that I was having. I got an opportunity a few days later while I was sitting at my usual table after work.

I spotted one of my co-workers at the bar. She was a rather attractive middle-aged woman with red hair, named Nadine. Her voice still held a trace of her original Irish accent though it had definitely been weathered by her time in America.

“How are you tonight?” I asked, taking a seat next to her.

“I can't really complain, how about you?” she replied, turning her attention from me to her drink as it arrived.

My food arrived along with my own beverage.

'It can wait.' I thought, though my stomach rumbled as the aroma of the food wafted into my nostrils.

“I'm actually curious. Have you ever noticed the effect having negative thoughts about this place has on your mind and body?” I blurted, though I had intended to be more subtle about it, my brain took advantage of the fact it wasn't being forced to stifle itself.

“Oh, that. It gets less painful over time.” she assured me with a faint smile.

I wondered for a moment if that expression was genuine or not.

“That's good to know, I guess.” I admitted, and got the sense that I wouldn't get anywhere if I pushed the older woman any further on the topic.

I excused myself back to my own table and finally gave in to my thirst and hunger. I went back to my room, and laid down on the bed. The next day was my day off, and as I laid there, staring at the ceiling, I began to conceive of an experiment that I decided I would carry out the next day. I set an alarm for just after dawn and tried to get some sleep. I tossed and turned, barely dozing until the noise shook me awake for the final time. I rose from the soft mattress and shaved my face, then took a long, hot shower. Once I got dressed, I headed down to breakfast.

I made my usual order, and ate quickly. Starting for the door as soon as I finished. Employees ate for free so I didn't even have to stop at the counter in front of the place. As I stepped out the door, I heard someone call my name. I turned back, stepping aside.

“Where are you going?” Mark, the slick haired manager I had met upon my first visit to this place enquired, hurrying down the hall toward me. His smile didn't match the urgency of his pace.

“I need to pick up some essentials. Is that a problem?” there was no malice behind the question, my voice calm and neutral.

“Not at all. I'm just concerned about you.” the other man replied.

“I'm fine.” I tried to soothe him, and continued on my earlier path through the door before he could say anything further.

I stepped away from the door and hurried to my car. I hadn't been lying, and my first stop was the store. Once I got those items, my experiment officially began. I went to a coffee shop first, settling in at a window seat to enjoy my first drink. I ordered a second beverage to go before I stepped back onto the street. I had only been gone almost an hour and I could already feel the desire to return scratching at the surface of my brain. I went to a park nearby instead, finding a seat on a bench near a bike path. I sipped the hot, vanilla flavored coffee as I watched other people enjoying the area.

A woman jogged along the path, and we exchanged a quick nod as she passed me by. The longer I sat there, the more intense the feeling I needed to get back 'home' became. I waited until I began to develop a slight headache, the pain starting like the jabbing of a needle just behind my left eye. I began to feel hot, as if I had a fever. I went back to my car and started back toward the less busy part of town, and the nearer I got, the more the negative feelings began to fade away. I decided I would push a little harder the next day even as I stepped through the door, into the club.

It was as if I had never felt ill at all. My stomach even rumbled, reminding me that I hadn't eaten since breakfast. I wondered for a moment if that was why I had been feeling strange earlier, my mind at war with itself. Half wanted to blame the Lavender Room itself for the way I had felt. The other half dismissed that thought as ridiculous. It was just a building, after all. There had to be something more to it. The thoughts faded away as the day went on and eventually I made my way back to my private room, putting away my things and setting an alarm.

I spent a little bit of time dancing with strangers at the nightclub, having been unable to sleep so early in the evening. I also took a few shots of whiskey because it was free for employees, just as our meals were. I eventually returned to my room, but still spent hours staring at the ceiling in total darkness for hours. When I did fall asleep, I was plagued with very strange dreams about being lost and homeless, adrift in the world. No one seemed to see or hear me, even when I began to bleed. Bright red blood ran from every one of my pores.

I woke as the clock screamed into the silence and darkness. I sat up and hurried through my shower and getting dressed. I tried to leave without being noticed by most of my co-workers, and it seemed to work as I made it outside without being accosted that time. I went to breakfast and spent A little longer than I needed, lingering long enough to drink an extra cup of coffee before getting back into my car. On a whim, I navigated my way onto the freeway. As I suspected as I got further out of town I began to feel unwell.

I got off the road at the next available exit, and made my way back to the city. I didn't return to the Lavender room, yet however, exercising what little bit of free will that still remained mine to enjoy. I ate lunch at the same diner I had visited the day before, rushing to the toilet to purge the food I had just eaten moments after paying my bill. I knew I had to return to the place I had to be living and working, and so I did.

I barely made it into the door before I collapsed into unconsciousness. I woke in my room, stripped to my waste and with cool cloths pressed over the exposed parts of my body. I sat up, removing the rags, still feeling somewhat dazed and weak. Nadine was in my living area.

“You gave us quite a fright, my friend.” she said when she heard my bedroom door open.

“I'm sorry about that, but what exactly just happened to me?” I asked, unable to contain my curiosity.

“I don't think that I am at liberty to tell you.” she replied.

I stared at the woman for a long time, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of regret and even pity in her eyes. The look was quickly replaced by her usual mask of cool indifference. I wanted to prod, but instead I cleared my throat.

“I appreciate you helping me, but you can leave now. I feel better.” I told her, though I was lying.

I still felt very weak as I watched the woman go, and then moved to my bedroom to pull on a new shirt. I decided that isolating myself was a bad idea after sitting around in silence until my strength began to return. As I made my way up the stairs, I also made up my mind that I would confront Matt and get some real answers, since Nadine didn't seem interested in enlightening me. I went to his office first, but the lights inside were dark, and I got no response when I knocked anyway. I checked the club on the top floor, and there were some familiar faces, but not the one I was looking for.

I ended up at the bar, where I ordered a soda instead of alcohol. As I sipped my beverage, I couldn't resist the urge when the bartender approached me again, and spoke up.

“Have you seen Matt today?” I asked.

Joe, the man slinging drinks gave a shake of his head.

“I think it's one of his days off, actually.” he said after a moment.

I felt a flash of frustration.

“Can you call my room if he comes in, please?” I requested.

He nodded, and I finished my drink, but didn't linger afterward. Instead, I returned to my room, surfing through the channels, waiting for the man behind the bar to call me. He didn't and when I emerged onto the first floor, he had been replaced behind the counter. I felt defeated as I ordered dinner and ate my meal alone as I usually did. This time, I didn't go back to my room, heading down to the gambling parlor instead. I nodded to one of the regulars as I approached the cage, exchanging some cash for chips.

I approached the roulette table, where Nadine stood, and took a seat. Her eyes skimmed over me briefly.

“Are you here to play or to ask me more questions that I can't answer?” she greeted me coldly.

Instead of speaking, I placed a chip on seven red. She let the ball roll and to my surprise, it landed in the same slot that I had bet on. I moved my initial bet along with my winnings to thirteen black, and once again that was where the little sphere landed. That made me think about the second time I had visited the place. The fact that I won that night had brought me back. Just as I began to think I was on to something, I lost. Nadine smiled at me.

“Another game?” she prodded.

I stood up and shook my head, retreating to my room. I watched T.V. For a while longer, pouring myself a shot of tequila while I flipped through the channels. My landline phone rang, which surprised me. I stood and walked to it, lifting the old-fashioned, corded handset from the cradle.

“Hello?” the word left my lips after a moment.

“This is Avery, at the bar. I was told to call you when Matt returned.” the semi-familiar female voice informed me.

“Where is he?” I enquired in return.

“On his way to his office.” she answered, sounding confused and more than a little irritated.

“Thank you. I'll be right up.” I told her, and then hung up before she could speak up again.

I hurried from my room and up the stairs, finding my way into the corridor for the second time that day. This time, the lights in the office were glowing behind the tightly closed blinds as I approached the manager's door. I knocked on the glass panel in the door and almost immediately heard shuffling noises behind it before the slick-haired man's words penetrated the door.

“One minute, please.” he called.

The door unlocked and opened moments later, and I stepped inside the room before he could say anything else.

“What is this place?” I demanded.

“What do you mean? It's a multi-level club. One of the first of its kind...” he began.

“Bullshit.” I interjected, though my tone remained calm.

“I don't know what you're talking about.” he denied again.

“I want answers, Matt.” I said, making direct eye contact with the man.

That's when I saw it. He was afraid, but not of me. I sighed, feeling the anger that had fueled me since my sudden bout of illness begin to melt out of my muscles, my strength seeming to follow it, draining out through the bottom of my feet. I collapsed into a chair.

I felt defeated, and even felt tears stinging my eyes.

“You wouldn't tell me anything if you could.” I said, the feelings in my head rendering my voice quiet and weak.

“I can't.” he replied, his eyes darting from me to his door, as if someone could be listening right outside of it.

The frustration I had been feeling for the previous week returned.

“Who can?” I demanded.

“You know the answer to that. If you want the truth, you have to go to the source.” Matt answered, seemingly uncomfortable even disclosing that much.

I stood up and left without speaking again. I started to think about what he had said. The source. He had to have meant the other man I had met my first night there. The one who had claimed to be the owner. I tried to remember his face, but there was a blank spot where his features could have been. All I could mentally picture was his purple suit. Even his hair color escaped me. The more I thought about him, the more I began to feel ill again.

I gave up, once again resigning myself to my fate. The desire to escape gnawed at the back of my mind like a hungry rat. 

I had to get out.
