# New entries in an old diary about a devil.

**September 12th**

The dream again last night. The same one I’ve had since I was a boy. I’m standing in a field of black stone under a green sky. In the center of the field is a single, gnarled tree, and from its branches hang silver bells that chime with no wind. A voice, smooth as oiled leather, speaks from behind me. It never says a word, just my name. “Alistair.” I always wake up sweating, my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest.

Dr. Evans says it’s a manifestation of performance anxiety. That I feel an unseen force is constantly judging me. Perhaps he’s right. God knows my father was judgmental enough for a pantheon of gods. Nothing I did was ever enough. Not the grades, not the job, not the life I’ve built. It’s all so… mediocre.

I found another one of Grandfather’s books today, hidden in a crate in the attic I’d meant to sort through for years. This one wasn’t like his dry historical texts. It was bound in a leather that felt unnaturally soft, like skin, and it had no title. The pages were vellum, the script a beautiful, spidery Latin. It’s a grimoire. A real one. I’m certain of it.

It feels like finding a door in a room I’ve lived in my whole life, a door I never knew was there.

**September 18th**

I’ve been translating the text. My university Latin is rusty, but serviceable. The book is a treatise on entities that exist outside our perception. It doesn’t call them demons or devils. It calls them “Listeners.” Beings of immense power and patience, who can hear a certain kind of call across the void.

The author, a man who only identifies himself as “Theophilus,” writes that most summoning rituals fail not because the entities aren’t real, but because the summoner lacks the one thing these beings possess in infinite measure: patience. We scream our desires into the dark and expect an immediate answer. The Listeners have been waiting for eons. They are not impressed by haste.

Theophilus posits that to attract one, you must not shout, but whisper. Not demand, but… invite. You must create a space of such profound and resonant silence, of such focused intent, that you become a hole in the world, a vacuum they cannot help but fill.

It’s absurd, of course. The ravings of a madman. But it’s a more compelling madness than the one I live daily.

**September 25th**

The ritual is not about blood and pentagrams. It’s about geometry and resonance. It requires a specific space—a circle drawn not with chalk, but with crushed quartz and iron filings. Specific incantations, not shouted, but hummed at a frequency that, Theophilus claims, aligns with the “hollow places between worlds.”

I’ve decided to do it. Not in the house. In the old potting shed at the bottom of the garden. It’s stone, single-roomed, and has been unused for a decade. It feels… appropriate.

Why? I don’t know. To prove Grandfather wasn’t just a eccentric fool? To prove to myself that there is more to this world than quarterly reports and dying lawn grass? Or maybe just to finally have an answer to that voice in my dream.

I’ve told Clara I’m taking up meditation. She smiled, that faint, worried smile she’s perfected. “If you think it will help with the stress, darling.” She doesn’t see the hole inside me. No one does.

**October 3rd**

The preparation is complete. The shed is cleaned. The circle is laid, a perfect nine-foot diameter. I’ve spent the last seven evenings, from midnight until one, sitting in the center, humming the tones described in the book. It’s a monotonous, draining exercise. My throat is raw. Nothing has happened. No sudden chill, no disembodied voice.

Just the sound of the wind outside, and the creeping fear that I am, in fact, a fool.

Theophilus warned of this. “The first test is the silence,” he wrote. “The would-be summoner must prove he can endure the sound of his own irrelevance. Most flee from it.”

I will not flee.

**October 10th**

Something shifted tonight.

I was deep into the humming, my mind a blank slate, the sound vibrating in my skull. The single candle I use for light guttered, though there is no draft in the sealed shed. The flame shrank to a blue pinprick, then roared back to life, twice as high as before, casting long, dancing shadows.

And for a moment, the shadows didn’t move with the flame. They moved against it.

A pressure settled in the room, a dense, physical weight on the air. I could feel it in my teeth. The humming tone seemed to change, to take on a resonance I wasn’t creating, a harmonic that came from the stones themselves.

I stopped. The silence that rushed in was different. It was a listening silence. A hungry silence.

I spoke the words of invitation, my voice a dry rasp. “I open this door. I prepare this space. Let one who hears, and who is willing, step through.”

Nothing. No flash of light. No sulfurous stench.

But when I stood to leave, my body aching, I saw it. Just outside the circle, in the dust on the stone floor, a single footprint. It was long and narrow, with five distinct, claw-like toes.

It was not there when I sat down.

**October 11th**

I went back at dawn. The footprint is gone. The dust is undisturbed.

I am not insane. I know what I saw.

**October 15th**

It is here.

I don’t know when it arrived. There was no grand entrance. It has simply… manifested. A presence. I can’t see it, not directly. But I can feel it in the shed, a spot of concentrated cold, a distortion in the air like heat haze on a summer road. It stands just outside the circle, always.

It doesn’t speak. It listens.

And I find myself talking. I told it about my father today. Things I’ve never told Clara, never told Dr. Evans. I spoke of the constant criticism, the feeling of being a disappointment made flesh. The cold spot in the room seemed to pulse, a slow, rhythmic throb, like a heartbeat. It was… absorbing my words. My bitterness.

It feels like dropping stones down a bottomless well. There is no echo, but you know they have landed somewhere.

**October 22nd**

I have started calling it Magus. It feels right. A teacher. A holder of secrets.

Our… sessions… have evolved. I no longer need to hum. I simply enter the circle, and the pressure manifests. The cold. I speak, and it listens. Sometimes, I feel a response. Not in words, but in impressions that form directly in my mind. A flicker of understanding. A thread of agreement.

Today, I was complaining about my manager, a petty, small-minded man who takes credit for my work. The thought formed in my head, clear and cold as ice: *He is an obstacle. Obstacles can be removed.*

It wasn’t a suggestion. It was a simple statement of fact. And for the first time, I didn’t feel a thrill of fear. I felt a thrill of power.

**October 29th**

It was an accident. I’m sure it was.

I was making a cup of tea for Clara. The kettle slipped from my hand, boiling water splashing across my arm. I cried out in pain and shock.

And from the corner of the kitchen, where the shadows are deepest, a thought pierced my mind, sharp and immediate: *PAIN. LET ME.*

It wasn’t a question. It was a demand. And in that moment of agony, I acquiesced. I didn’t know how to “let it,” but I stopped fighting the pain, stopped clutching my arm.

The burning sensation didn’t vanish. It… detached. It was as if the pain was a physical thing, a red-hot worm under my skin, and something pulled it out. I watched, mesmerized, as the blisters on my arm shrank, the red, angry flesh fading to a mild pink. In seconds, it was gone. Healed. Not even a scar.

The cold spot in the kitchen lingered for a full minute afterwards. And the impression I got from it was one of… satisfaction. A deep, primordial pleasure.

It can leave the shed. It is tied to me, not to the circle.

I should be terrified. But all I feel is an overwhelming, intoxicating gratitude.

**November 5th**

My manager, Mr. Briggs, had a heart attack this morning. He collapsed in the car park. He’s in the ICU, critical condition.

When I heard the news at the office, a chill passed through me, a familiar, comforting cold. And in my mind, a single, quiet thought: *Obstacle removed.*

I didn’t do anything. I never spoke a word against him to anyone but Magus. I didn’t wish for this. Not explicitly.

But I cannot deny the dark, coiling feeling of satisfaction in my gut. The world is starting to make sense. It is aligning itself to my will.

Clara says I seem different. More confident. She’s afraid of it.

**November 12th**

Magus is beginning to show itself.

It started as a shimmer in the air. Now, when the candlelight is just right, I can see a shape within the cold. It is tall, impossibly so, and thin. Its limbs are too long, its fingers ending in points. It has no face, just a smooth, obsidian expanse where a face should be, which somehow conveys a sense of ancient, patient intelligence.

It speaks to me now, not in impressions, but in a voice that is both inside and outside my head. It is the voice from my dreams. Smooth as oiled leather.

*“Alistair. You have been a worthy student. Your patience has been noted. Your… offerings… have been appreciated.”*

It considers my bitterness, my rage, my petty jealousies, to be offerings. And it has grown stronger on them.

Tonight, it asked for a different kind of offering.

*“The rituals of old were not without their logic,”* it whispered, the sound slithering through the shed. *“Blood is a potent conductor. A focus. A symbol of commitment.”*

It did not ask for a life. Not yet. It asked for a drop. My blood, placed in the center of the circle.

I did not hesitate. I pricked my finger with my penknife and let a single, dark drop fall onto the stone.

The cold in the room intensified until my breath plumed in the air. The shadowy form of Magus seemed to drink the light, growing more solid, more *real*. The smooth, blank face turned towards me, and I felt a wave of approval so potent it was like a drug.

*“Very good,”* it purred. *“Now we truly begin.”*

**November 30th**

The world is malleable. I understand that now. It is clay, and will is the sculptor’s hand. Magus is teaching me.

A man cut me off in traffic, then gave me a vulgar gesture. I felt a spike of anger. Magus, a silent passenger in the seat beside me, whispered a single word: *“Punish.”*

I focused my will, my anger a sharp, hot point. I pictured his tire blowing out. A hundred yards down the road, his front left tire exploded. His car swerved into a ditch.

I laughed. I couldn’t help it.

Clara is sleeping in the guest room. She says the bedroom is too cold. She says I talk in my sleep in a language she doesn’t recognize. She looks at me as if I’m a stranger.

She is an obstacle.

**December 24th**

It demanded a life.

*“The final offering,”* Magus said, its form now so solid it seems to suck the light from the room. It stands just outside my circle, its long, clawed fingers tracing the boundary it cannot cross without an invitation. *“A soul, freely given by you, to cement our covenant. Power such as you desire requires a sacrifice of equal measure.”*

I knew what it wanted. Who it wanted. The one who fears me. The one who stands in the way of my unburdened ascent.

Clara.

I found her in the guest room, packing a suitcase. “I’m going to my sister’s, Alistair. I’m scared. I don’t know what’s happened to you.”

I tried to reason with her. I told her about the power, the freedom. I showed her the things I could do—I made the lights flicker, I made the temperature plummet. I thought she would understand. I thought she would see.

She just cried. “That’s not power, Alistair. That’s damnation.”

Her words enraged me. The ingratitude. The blindness.

Magus was there, then. Not in the shed. In the corner of the guest room, a pillar of darkness. *“She does not see your glory. She is wilfully blind. An obstacle.”*

I advanced on her. I didn’t know what I was going to do. My hands were clenched.

She screamed.

And in that moment, Magus acted. It flowed across the room, not as a shape, but as a wave of absolute cold and hate. It did not touch Clara. It flowed into *me*.

It was an invasion. An ecstatic, terrifying violation. My body was no longer my own. I felt my limbs move with a strength that was not mine. I saw my hands, my own hands, reach for her throat.

Her eyes were not on me. They were fixed on something behind my eyes, something ancient and hungry and cruel. She saw it. In her final moment, she finally saw.

The sound… I will never forget the sound.

When it was over, and the cold receded from my limbs, leaving me empty and shaking, I saw it. Magus, now more real than the bed, than the walls, than my own hands, stood over her body. It was… *feasting*. Not on her flesh, but on the shimmering, terrified essence that rose from her. It drank her soul, and I felt a wave of power crash over me, so intense it was painful.

The blank, smooth face turned to me. And for the first time, a crack appeared in its surface. A vertical line that peeled open into a lipless, needle-filled smile.

*“The pact is sealed,”* it spoke aloud, its voice now a physical thing that scratched at the air. *“Your world is mine, Alistair. And you… you are my door.”*

I looked down at Clara, at the horror frozen on her face. I looked at my hands.

And I realized, too late, the fundamental truth Theophilus had failed to mention. The Listeners are patient not because they are benevolent, but because they know. They know that given enough time, man will willingly open the door to his own cage and hand them the key.

The power is mine. It courses through me. I can feel the house, the street, the city, like a model I can reshape.

But I am so very, very cold.

And in the silence of my mind, where my own thoughts used to be, I can hear it laughing.
