 

“The Road Trip Project” was a placeholder name for a found footage horror film my friends and I wanted to produce.  The script was a producer’s dream.  Ultra-low budget.  Great story and characters.  Infinitely editable footage.  And even if it didn’t smash the box office, it was destined to be at least a cult hit.  It was the sort of project you can get so excited about that it’s easy to get tunnel vision.  You start to fail to notice things, you make decisions that maybe you shouldn’t have.

For my part, I was so excited that I wanted to start filming some B-roll.  That meant installing a dashcam in my car, and driving around my local area, late in the evening or in the dark of night.  I’d been doing it for a few weeks and getting some great shots.  I hadn’t any idea I could have been putting myself in danger.  

I was almost done with the B-roll when I found something on the map that I hadn’t noticed before.  It was a section of land not far away, but surprisingly difficult to access.  “Off the beaten path” was putting it mildly.  That meant anything could have been there.  I thought that could have been cinematographic gold.  That wasn’t what I found.

If you want to read the backstory, if you want to understand what had made me so excited that I almost lost everything, if you’d like to know what could have possessed me to explore where I wasn’t supposed to go, that’s all over on my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EBDavis/comments/11z548b/i_was_shooting_broll_for_a_found_footage_horror/)

I found a place I hadn’t explored yet, a pretty big place I didn’t even really know existed.  It sparked my interest. I’d collected more B-roll than I needed, but I was also still having fun, so I thought one more trip wouldn’t hurt.

The section of land was cut off on three sides by a great big curving meander of the river, with no bridges.  The other side was cut off by the freeway. The only way to access it was through this long winding road that passed underneath the freeway, and that road itself was hard to access.  I could tell from Google Earth that there were still people who went there.  I’d see some farmers’ fields.  That dark green of hazelnut orchards, and a few scattered houses.  No towns, no businesses.  The freeway was built back in the sixties, and I’d guess if anybody ever had an interest in developing that weird peninsula of land, that interest would have disappeared when the freeway went up.  It was sort of like a little lost piece of land, in the middle of a well-populated larger valley.  It piqued my curiosity.

At any rate, I got in my car, headed out just before sunset, and started recording.  Just like I’d done plenty of times before.

I started feeling creeped out even before I reached that place.  I got turned around a bit even trying to find the access road.  Maybe I should have taken that as a hint.  I can remember rounding a forested hill and then almost coming to a complete stop when I came to the point where the road dipped below the freeway.  It was a low clearance, and there was a large brightly colored sign on the roadway.  It was battered and dented, clearly, it had been struck many times by trucks that hadn’t been heading the warnings.  There were also plenty of high water/flood signs, though they weren’t relevant that night.  Underneath the freeway, where the road dipped down, there was a thin layer of dust.  It would have been mud when the road flooded after heavy rains.  I could see it rising up the pillars that held up the freeway.  It meant that when this flooded, the entire section of land would be inaccessible.  Just beyond that was a small bridge over a small creek, no doubt the source of seasonal flooding.

It was almost completely dark when I finally crossed under the freeway and over the bridge into that lost land.  I was worried if there was anything really good to film it’d be too dark, but more I had this uncomfortable indistinct sense of dread, and I didn’t know why.  I guess at the time I was thinking about how easy it would be to get cut off by high water.  It felt so isolated out there.  

Then there were the hazelnut orchards.  They didn’t use the same dwarf variety.  I think I tried to reason it as maybe these were the first experimental orchards that hazelnut farmers had started planting many decades ago.  Or maybe they’d been planted before that variety was developed.  The trees here were huge, forty feet and higher.  They were still in rows but had grown so thick and twisted, roots digging up out of the ground, branches growing low to soak up every bit of light, that the rows between the trees seemed completely inaccessible.  It looked like the Black Forest from some fairy tale horror story.  Soon it became too dark to see.

For a while, I was reminded of my night drive through that wetland preserve.  I supposed whatever heavy equipment the state uses to cut foliage away from roadways wasn’t designed to fit underneath the freeway.  Grass and bushes grew right up to the shoulder.  The road itself wasn’t in good condition.  Though a lack of truck traffic seemed to leave the potholes not too bad.  There were ruts worn into the asphalt as if it hadn’t been repaved since before the freeway went up.

The big fat moths were here.  They seemed to come out of the brush, attracted by my headlights.  What was new was the bats.  They swooped and corkscrewed down out of the inky black to snatch up the moths.  They seemed reckless and unconcerned about my car, so I started to slow down a little.  Weeks earlier I’d hit a rabbit while filming.  I hit my brakes, I swerved, yet I still hit it.  There just wasn’t anything I could have done, still, I’d felt bad about it.  I didn’t want to hit anything else.  

Almost as soon as that memory came into mind I had to slam on my brakes.  Something big had started waddling out of the tall grass and directly into the path of my car.  I managed to stop just in time and got a good look at the thing right in front of me.

At first, I thought it was a feral pig, which I’d never seen before, and I hadn’t thought it was an issue in the area.  Instead, it was the fattest, biggest opossum I’d ever seen before.  I thought at first its size was explained by it being a mother, with a load of babies on her back.  Instead, it was just patches where its fur had fallen out and exposed dark sores underneath.  It stopped in its tracks and turned to look at me.  In addition to the mange, it seemed to have that disease that makes the opossum's eyes go wall-eyed.  They were reflecting my headlights and almost seemed to glow this strangely lovely shade of turquoise.  They were so bright it was almost blinding. Then, as I watched, the eyes seemed to move.  They started to converge inwards, no longer walleyed, but looking straight.  I swear, it seemed to be looking past my headlights and looking straight at me, where I sat in the driver’s seat. It couldn’t have possibly seen me, yet I felt sure it was.  It didn’t move, just stared, blocking me.  I’ve seen possums play dead, but it wasn’t doing that.  I worried it was in some weird halfway state, induced by my headlights.

Just before I convinced myself to try to squeeze around it, it started waddling off into the brush on the other side of the road and disappeared.  So I started driving again, but I swear I could hear a sound to my left in the same spot where it had vanished.  I think it was growling.  I don’t think possums do that.

I continued on my way, but I’d already had enough.  I wanted to turn around and go home, but I was looking for a good open place to do it; I didn’t want to risk a three-point turnaround on such a narrow road.  I’d seen several roads go off to either side, and I suppose I could take one of those and just loop around, yet I wasn’t quite so desperate to take one yet.  The road curved to the right and gently dipped, then sharper to the left, and for the second time I slowed to a halt.  Ahead of me was an old antique wooden covered bridge.  I’d already found several of them since I’d started shooting B-roll.  Back in the 90s, they’d been semi-popular tourist donations.  Local towns had celebrated them.  There were maps and driving tours.  I hadn’t read a thing about this one. It should have made this little lost section of the valley kind of famous.  Maybe they kept it off the lists because they didn’t want the tourists.  Or maybe it had a problem with upkeep.

Regardless, I started driving across, real slow.  There was just enough room to squeeze my car through.  Everything was wood, including the driving surface. I guess that’s why I didn’t see it until I was almost underneath it.  I was looking down at the surface.  Thick wooden planks, probably oak.  Probably from trees chopped down a hundred and fifty years ago.  They should have still been solid, but you’ll have to excuse me for being nervous.  

It was right at the end when I’d almost reconnected with pavement when I looked up.  There, at the far end of the bridge, was an effigy hanging from a rope.  It sort of looked like a scarecrow, though far more sinister.  Denim overalls, farmer’s boots, a plaid flannel shirt, work gloves, a bag over whatever formed the head.  I didn’t see the knot that was tied at the neck, but I assume it was a classic standard noose.  I tried to think of why anybody would want to hang such a thick-looking thing.  Some of the people who lived way out in the boondocks liked to fly flags that gave strong implications.  It still didn’t make sense though.  I was sure it was just an effigy, though I have no idea why I was so certain the way it hung just made it look like it only weighed a few pounds.  There’s no way that could have been a real person.  I have no idea what it was actually stuffed with.  Straw, newspaper, it doesn’t matter.

Well, I was firmly spooked, either way.  I sure as shit wasn’t going to drive under that thing and beyond the effigy.  I put it in reverse and backed out of that bridge, faster than I’d driven in.  The dashcam doesn’t show it, it was facing the wrong way, but it felt like the bridge’s wooden frame was even narrower than it had been before.  A minor annoyance had become a serious challenge.  I hardly hesitated though. I came out of that bridge, still in reverse, the green grass and gray asphalt returning in the white light of my reverse lights.  I continued on that way, looking over my shoulder, for some amount of time. I had this anxious thought I could come upon another driver heading the other way, or the same way coming from the front.

I couldn’t keep that up, there was just too far to go with no good spot to turn around.  So I finally bit the bullet and did a three-point turn.  First I backed into the tall grass on the shoulder, hearing sticks scraping against my undercarriage. I shifted into drive and this time stuck my front end over the edge of the road, just a bit, just past perpendicular to the direction of the road.  Only this time I felt this sick lurch.  My front wheels seemed to dip precipitously, like there was a huge drop-off obscured by the grass.  I slammed it back into reverse and hit the gas.  Being a front-wheel drive, my car spun out for a few terrifying seconds before catching back onto the road. I turned sharply and was facing the right direction again, back toward that access road.  

As I shifted back into drive I hesitated just a second. There was life everywhere.  It seemed I’d insulted the nature just past the road’s shoulders, and now it was streaming out of the grass.  Snakes wriggled across the road, giant black spiders, huge beetles that looked like giant cockroaches, and no such thing was supposed to live around here.  The moths swarmed, along with brown and black ones, a trillion mosquitos, swarms of gnats, huge dragonflies, some of which seemed to drag remnants of spiderwebs behind them, reflecting the light of my headlamps.  The bats swarmed too, seconds later, and when I heard a loud thump on the roof of my car, I floored it.

I drove way too fast for safety.  I wasn’t concerned about running over rabbits anymore. Or raccoons or possums for that matter.  If I hit something, I’d just deal with the bodywork later.  Then the idea of some person walking out of that grass came into my mind, an intrusive thought.  I slowed down just out of worry.  I blasted past a side road. I wish I’d taken it earlier.  Now it meant it wasn’t the shortest route out, so I ignored it.  At least until I had to slam on my brakes again.  Not past that side road, the main road was blocked.  There were little turquoise orbs impeding my path.  All of them in two-close set pairs.  I recognized the possum that was the closest pair.  To its sides were a number of other possums.  I saw raccoons as well.  There was a bunch of little nutria nearer the shoulders.  Behind them, a pack of coyotes.  I could just barely make them out.  I’d never seen a pack of coyotes before, just lone wanderers.  What I couldn’t identify were the blue-green reflective eyes standing behind the coyotes. Behind and above. Whatever was there was six feet tall if it were an inch.  The ones behind them, the ones a good eleven feet tall, I don’t even like to think about.

Again I flew into reverse, all the way back past that side road.  Back into drive, and I flew down the side road. I didn’t see any street signs.  I was hoping as hard as I could that there would be more side roads.  Hopefully two more rights, and then I could hook a left back onto the access road.

I hadn’t memorized this patch of land when I’d found it on Google Earth, but I’d remembered there were a number of roads.  And except where they were confined by rivers and streams, generally, they ran the usual grid pattern.

The brush on the side seemed to recede and was soon replaced by farmers' fields.  Off in the distance, I could see the mercury lamps of distant households and farms.  This was what most of the valley looked like by night, and while I didn’t relax, I did start to feel a little more comfortable. 

I turned my high beams on, and the darkness receded.  Ahead of me, on the right, was one of those giant oaks near the side of the road.  A section was carved out to let the power lines run through.  This time I saw it before I got close.  I saw it, but I kept going, only slowing down a little. I didn’t stop until it was at the upper edge of the cone of my high beams.  It was the effigy, hanging from the tallest branch of that tree, right over the road. 

I saw it and I watched it.  It slowly rotated as it hung.  I was sure it was the same one I’d seen earlier, impossibly moved.  Same boots, same denim overalls, same shirt, even the same color.  Then I watched as the dark spot started to spread.  At first I thought it was pissing itself. I think that was because of the overalls.  I mean, we’ve all seen people piss their pants at some point, how many times have we seen people bleed out?  The spot of wetness didn’t start in the crotch, but high up, nearer the chest, nearer the heart.  I was sure it was blood now, as sure as I was that it was the same effigy. And yet still I was convinced, despite the bleeding, that it was an effigy.  A human body should have hung heavier.

I kept going. I didn’t want to turn around and face that roadblock again.  I risked going on, though I did swerve so that I didn’t drive directly under it.  I think I saw it dripping long after it was out of my field of view.  

I drove perhaps another mile, fast as I dared.  Ahead of me, the road came to an end, but thankfully at a crossroads.  My first bit of luck, I had the chance to turn right.  Hopefully, there’d be another and connect back to the access road, on the other side of those creatures forming the roadblock.

I was always a good driver.  My father had been a good instructor when I was a teen.  He’d taught me about the petty nature of cops, and how to always follow the rules, and always use the turn signals, even if I was in a parking lot.  I pulled to a halt at the stoplight, my turn signal already on for the 100 feet previously.  I looked dutifully to the left, and there my heart rose into my throat. There was traffic approaching.  They were still far off, maybe minutes off.  I could make my turn easily.  The problem was… there were dozens of them, maybe scores of cars and pick-up trucks, or so it seemed by the headlights too many. I hadn’t thought there were that many people in this little lost section of land, yet here they were.  And they were coming in my direction, en masse.  Angry.  Determined.  The first word to properly form in my mind was “mob.”  Then I thought about the lynched effigy.

Forgetting traffic laws, I spun my steering wheel to the right and floored it.  For just the briefest fraction of a second, I looked past the road, into the brush on the far side of the crossroad.  There were eyes there. Waiting in the tall grass, watching me.  Not just that familiar turquoise, but strange blues and reds.  They weren’t possums or raccoons.  I saw faces.  Not human faces, but mockery of human faces.  Like masks.  Wrinkled.  Grooved.  Spiraled. I have no real words to describe them properly. Though I saw them clearly despite the fraction of a second before I was down the road and speeding away.

I drove like a madman, and I’m sure you would have too.  Eight, ninety miles an hour down a narrow but relatively straight country road.  After ninety I just stopped watching the speedometer, even though I drove faster, even though my tires started to shake violently. I’d like to say I was focused on the road.  I think I was more preoccupied with my rearview mirror.  Again, the dashcam never recorded it, but I was keeping an eye on all those vehicles behind me.  I wanted them to get farther away, but they weren’t.  It was the whole reason I was driving so recklessly.  The only thing it could mean is that they were driving as fast as I was, and that was no comfort at all.

When I looked forward and saw it for the third time, I slammed on my brakes again.  I was thrown against my seatbelt and it was hard enough to leave a bruise.  When braking at over a hundred miles per hour, it takes a frettingly long time to stop in an emergency.  When I finally stopped, it was right there, again at the top limit of my headlights.  It was the effigy.  Higher than it had been on the bridge, lower than it had been hanging from the tree.  The problem was… there was no tree at the side of the road.  There was no bridge, no structure of any kind.

I had to know.  I couldn’t help it.  I was already terrified beyond belief, but I couldn’t help it.  I had to know.  I opened the latch to my door.  It was locked, and I had to find the unlock button.  I always do that.  I now opened my door and finally smelled the air of this place.  It was thick.  Warmer than it should have been. It reminded me of petrichor, that heady smell after it first starts to rain after a long time, only more organic, botanical.  It smelled like what I imagine the jungle smells like. Not a real jungle.  A primitive, ancient, primordial jungle.

I opened the door just enough to lean out and look up.  I saw that effigy, no windshield between it and my eyes.  I saw a stretch of rope, lit by my headlights.  Then I saw its dark silhouette against a black starry sky. It kept going up and up until I lost it.  And above it, nothing to hang from.  Only countless distant stars, and nothing else.

I slammed the door shut and floored it again.  I didn’t bother to swerve this time, if it dropped and hit me, then it would hit me.  My biggest concern was getting out of that place.  My second biggest was doing so before the bright headlights behind me finally caught up.

I dared to hope again when I saw a crossroads to the right. I was sure this would link up with the access road and I’d have a way out.  I like to think I at least understand the physics of stunt driving, even if I’ve never done it outside of video games.  I took that corner better than any corner I’ve taken in my life.  Hard braking on a straight just before entering the line, taking the line exactly like I’d picture it in my head, hammering back down on the gas right when I need to, this time heading down the side road.  I actually started to laugh. I felt like I’d accomplished something.

The laugh died in my throat when I looked in my rearview mirror. I was certain that those other people in other cars couldn’t possibly have taken that turn as well as I had.  They weren’t bothering to.  They all turned together, leaving the road entirely.  It had turned from a single file line directly behind me to a sort of echelon, each one still pointed straight at me, plowing through some farmer’s field.  Impossibly, they weren’t losing any speed at all.  This was the point I started wondering if those were even real headlights. Part of me wishes the dashcam had caught it.  Part of me doesn’t care anymore.

I remember letting out this choking sob when I saw the access road.  Seconds later I turned a hard sharp left and headed back to where the road dipped below the freeway.  I started thinking I might actually make it, despite how close those headlights were getting.

They weren’t really headlights. They had all caught up with each other now and were all one giant mass.  They were just behind me now.  Close enough it hurt to look in the mirror.  My hand shot out and I almost knocked my mirror out of its mount.  I saw how they moved though, how they moved with respect to each other.  They were like eyes, but not eyes. They weren’t pairs.  They turned and twisted around each other, flipping and spinning like they were jockeying for a better position with other predators. They were like the tips of long-reaching things that stretched back far behind the tips.  Of course, I couldn’t see any of this.  Only the lights, and not on camera.

I saw that little bridge over the creek and started to weep.  I saw the freeway, and where the road passed underneath, leading I was certain to safety.  I took that dip way too fast.  I had that unnerving floaty feeling as my car caught air for a half second, then the terrible crunch as my poor car bottomed out on the other side of the dip.  I didn’t recognize it until I was a mile or two away, but there was that low guttural roar of my engine, now detached from my muffler.  

It didn’t matter.  I looked in my side mirror.  The lights had stopped in their tracks, still twisting and twirling, angry somehow.  They’d stopped at the edge that lost land, at the freeway, or perhaps at that little running creek just beyond.  

I was safe.  I started to laugh until I screamed.  With a terrible thump, it hit me.  That effigy.  Right on my hood and windshield.  A big wet thump, and I screamed and it obscured my vision completely.  I didn’t swerve, I didn’t break, and then it started to slide, and the effigy finally fell off, blown by the wind. I could see the road again, through a layer of blood all over my windshield.  Looking back, I think it’d been thrown in rage.

It took a lot of wiper fluid before I could see properly again, not that I slowed down. It took me a little under an hour to get back home.  There’d been a rainstorm along the way, and my car was clean by the time I pulled into my driveway.  I just grabbed my dashcam, walked in, said nothing about it to my wife, who’d been used to my shooting excursions, went to my office and cried.

The damage to my exhaust cost a couple of thousand to have fixed.  I didn’t even care.  It was the last physical evidence of what happened that night. Except for what I’d recorded on that camera.  I haven’t watched it yet.  It would show the possum.  The roadblock of the possum and its allies.  The effigy, including the last time it landed on my hood.  And those faces. I think that’s what I fear the most.  Those faces.

I haven’t watched it yet.  I don’t want to.  I know I caught them, I don’t have to look, and I’m not going to.  I don’t know what happened that night, but I’m certain it’s supernatural.  There are no doubt there are a million people who would love to see that footage.  It would change everything.  I don't want to show it.

I haven’t talked to Andy and Mike about it.  Haven’t talked to my wife or anybody else.  I’m just going to finish my duties for the Road Trip Project, and then that’s it.  I’m done.  Nobody needs that footage.  

I go out a lot less since this happened.  I think I like it that way.  It’s safe, at home. I think my wife is starting to worry.  Mike and Andy seem to have noticed I’m not as outgoing as I used to be.  That’s fine with me.  I went to a place I wasn’t supposed to go. I think that’s why I’m still alive.  I think I trespassed, and everything I saw in that lost place wanted me to leave.  I can respect that. I *will* respect that.  That’s why I don’t think I’ll show the footage to anybody.  If they do, they might be tempted to explore.  That would make them, it, whatever it was… that would make them angry.  And if I can go there, that means they could come here.
