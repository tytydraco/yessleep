Have you ever been on one of those cheesy school field trips before? It might seem a bit cynical but I never really liked them. They always struck me as a bit repetitive. It's like a job giving you free pizza instead of a raise, or a parent giving you the talk about not doing drugs whenever something shows up on the news. Anyways, we had one of those today. It was a huge thing. More so than any other field trip the school has had. Every single grade from high school came. I wouldnt have went, but my parents made me go. At least they gave me a huge breakfast before I left to make up for it. It was amazing, like a stereotypical breakfast you'd see in a movie. Only I ate it all instead of leaving because I was late.

After I got to school, I went inside to check with homeroom. Then me and Hunter went to the front where they were loading everyone up. Our school has hundreds of kids, yet only one bus left the school full. Considering how big of a deal the school made of this particular trip, it was suprising. There were posters, flyers, all kinds of stuff promoting the "Field trip of a lifetime." Even the principle came in to every single room to make sure everyones parents got the form. That was another huge red flag. Noone ever got to read the form, only our parents. It was mailed directly to them and noones parent explained it to them, and whenever asked would either divert the conversasion or say it was adult buisness. 

We left first thing in the morning. Everyones name was called down from the intercom and we loaded up, one by one. They had us line up at the door to the bus and took role call before we got on. They also handed out water bottles. It's the middle of summer, so it was a welcome suprise.

"Are we taking a trip to Hitchburg or the desert?" Hunter remarked as he was given water. 

Oh, i forgot to mention earlier, thats Hunter. I've known him since Kindergarten, and since we go to the same high school now we've been super close. We would probably take a bullet for one another if push came to shove. He's a bit of a nerd, but he's also pretty athletic. He is on the football team, so he kind of has to be. He beat me in a wrestling match one time. Which with me being on the wrestling team says something.

The teacher just gave a forced smile and checked his clipboard, ignoring Hunters comment. 

"Do you know what time we'll be back?" I asked.

The teacher only nodded his head no, checked his clip board, and handed me a water. I got on the bus and sat next to Hunter, who had already went through half his snacks.

"Jesus man, already? We havent even left yet." I said

"Well, I didnt have breakfast" he said.

"You know they serve it for free in the cafeteria, right?" I said.

Hunter sighed as he put the snacks away.

"Well i didnt mean it like that, you do you. Just dont be too suprised when you go for the goldfish and they arent there, is all im saying." I said. I should really be more mindful of other peoples feelings.

We just sat there for a while, making the occasional joke. I fell asleep somehow, and thats when I had a dream. For me, that in and of itself is a weird occurance given how often I dream. I was running through a dark tunnel. I didnt know what i was running from. I looked behind me and there was nothing. It was like I was running from the idea of something rather than an actual thing. I was the most afraid ive ever been. I felt fear stinging my body like a swarm of bees. It felt like something was right behind me, but nothing. No footsteps, no shadow, nothing. I knew I was in a dream, but I couldnt control my body either. I was just watching myself run from nothing through a labryinth of dark tunnels, terrified. I tripped, but just as I started to fall Hunter woke me up. Finally, after what felt like eons of waiting the bus rumbled to life like a semi truck hauling a bunch of chickens to slaughter. I saw a road sign that said Hitchburg was 19 miles further northbound on interstate, and we sped by it. Man, I really thought we were closer. There werent any teachers on the bus, but the driver did look up in his mirror every once and a while. He looked worried when he looked up at it. Like he was anticipating something. It reminded me of how my mom looked at me before she told me that my dog had passed away while I was at school.
I took a sip from my water. It was slightly bitter, but I'd expect no better from the cheap, off brand Dasani stuff the school got.

After about halfway there my stomach started to spin like a dryer. Im not sure if it was the big breakfast or the bumpy ride, but I threw up. Luckily I was close to the trash can near the front of the bus. As I went back to my seat, I noticed a few people drinking their water as well. It was one of the hottest days we've had in a while, I dont blame them. Hunter brought Dr pepper, and he gave me one too.

As we got closer and closer, I started to notice a few people falling asleep. I wouldnt normally notice, but Hunter pointed it out to me. Suddenly, there was a series of loud sounds that came from the bus. Id say it was like gunshots, but it wasnt quite as concussive. The bus started to squeal as the driver hastily pulled over.

"Everyone, remain seated while I go see what in the hell is goin' on out there." The driver said.

He still seemed quite worried over something. His voice sounded borderline scared. It was weird, but I didnt pay it much mind at the time.

"Looks like those cheap school tires wore down pretty fast." I joked

"Yeah, like the tires on your old shitbox back home." Hunter chuckled.

Then I noticed something weird. Half the kids on the bus were now asleep. It had been a long ride, but I still dont understand how they slept through the ruckus the bus was making. The drive stepped back inside.

"Alright kiddos, we should be back on scedule." He said.

The bus whirred to life once more and off we went. After a short while, hunter turned to me.

"Hey, I might take a short nap. Wake me up when we get there, ok?" He said.

I could tell he was tired since this morning. After all, we did stay up all night playing super smash brothers. 

"Sure man, I might take one myself." I said. 

As I started to drift off to the rumbling of the bus, something didnt add up. I turned around and saw the whole bus was asleep, aside from me. The driver was wide awake, and he seemed to be alot more chipper than when we pulled over earlier. While I was turned around, I noticed something even weirder.

There was a sign on the opposite side of the interstate saying that it was 7 miles *southbound* to Hitchburg.
