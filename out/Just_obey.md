I had started working hard to be able to make extra money and go on a trip during the holidays, I was also serving part of a punishment that my father imposed on me for some mistakes I made during the holidays last year. I knew I would get my father to pay for the entire trip because I had already come up with a plan to get "fired" in less than a week from every house I went to work at and would claim that I couldn't be responsible yet. 

In the first house, on the second day, I "accidentally" broke a very expensive vase. I was fired. In the second house, I pretended to hit on the boss and waited for the perfect moment for her wife catches us. I was fired too. My father didn't seem like he was going to give up, it seemed he knew I was being fired on purpose and soon found another home.

Now they were older children, no longer babies, they were two brothers, William and Lucas, children of a single mother who lived away from home almost all of the time. The house was quite filthy, precarious. I think dad was aware of it. The boys were little devils, on the third day, I couldn't bear to look at them.  Extremely rude and cheeky since the day one. As I spent the whole day there, I also took showers there and the kids, without any inhibitions, looked at me through the bathroom window and laughed when I argued with them asking them not to do it more.

I told all the kids' antics to their mother when she arrived at the beginning of the night, but the woman almost always smelled of cheap vodka and weed, she didn't even listen to me. She just goes to her bedroom and throw herself on a pile of dirty clothes that she called bed. It seemed like a lost cause to me.

I had never thought about doing anything against the children I was responsible for, firstly because they were always babies, secondly because it wasn't fair, there were other tactics to get fired, but, in this case, I started to come up with a plan to get fired and it would be the kids who would pay me for all the embarrassment and disrespect.

At the weekend, their mother simply said that she would only come back on monday and that I would have to stay with the kids, I said that she was crazy if she thought I was going to waste two weekend days with these naughty kids, she said that she had spoken to my father and that he agreed. I tried, in vain, to argue with dad and he didn't even listen to me. "I'm screwed!" I thought

Well, the plan I had come up with to screw the kids and get me fired had to be reformulated. I would convince them to set fire to all the school material and I would claim that I couldn't stop them, the kids would get beaten up by their drunk mom and I would be fired. There was no way it could go wrong.

When they woke up on saturday, I was at the table next to the bedroom listening to music, they went into the bathroom and said "good morning", I said "good morning" and I thought it was strange. Later, at lunch time, they washed their hands, sat at the table and ate with cutlery, as politely as possible, washed the dishes and excused themselves to go to the living room to play video games.

Those kids had made my life a hell for the last 5 days, they weren't going to fool me, "they must be up to something. I'm not going to let my guard down" I thought and went to take my shower. I always turned on the shower and waited for them to put their face in the window to spy on me, I had my clothes on and ready to close the window and end their fun. This time, I turned on the shower and waited... waited... waited... they didn't appear. I decided to take a shower and nothing happened, I was always looking out the window and no one came.

When I left the bathroom, I saw a man entering the kids' bedroom, about 6'8, black, wearing fireman's uniform, I wanted to yell "ow, who are you?", but I decided to just go there. When I opened the bedroom door there was nothing, I looked under the bed, in the wardrobe, it was impossible for a guy who was about 6'8 tall to be hiding there, in other words, I must have been delusional. By the way, for the first time in this house, I saw the kids' bedroom tidy.

I went to the living room and they were doing their homework!!! THEY TURNED OFF THE VIDEO GAME AND WERE DOING THEIR HOMEWORK! I repeat. I was in shock. They looked like other children, I swear I couldn't understand them and they just surprised me more and more, they were extremely helpful and affectionate.

By the end of sunday afternoon, I had practically forgotten about my plan, in fact, I was really enjoying the kids, they were praising me, they were even idolising me. That was like a catharsis for me, I thought "if these kids, under 10 years old, could become better people in 48 hours, I, at 20s, should do the same."

The monday has come, I woke up with a laugh, yes, the kids had come in from the guest room — where I was sleeping — and were taking photos of my panties! I ran after them and they ran into the street. I was so pissed off that I forgot to notice the mess in the house, it looked like a dumpster of rubbish had been dumped there. Their mother was already lying on the bed, next to an empty liter of brandy and had left a letter on the table saying "thank you" and with my payment inside. I thought the woman had killed herself and it was a suicide note, but she was fine when I called her and she woke up, cursed at me and asked me to go away, then closed the door in my face.

I thought about implementing the plan I had come up with myself, but the kids had left with their backpacks on the way to school. I really got nervous when I returned to that house in the afternoon, I couldn't stand the perverted kids for another 4 days until their drunkard mother disappeared over the weekend and they became angels. But I was forced again.

It was difficult to have a rational dialogue with someone who got drunk and half-naked in front of their children and strangers and left the house looking like a pig pen.

Once again, at the weekend, the kids became angels. I suspected it was their mother's bad example that influenced them, probably it was a bit.

On sunday morning, they were invited to a school friend's birthday, they took a shower, got dressed and went, they even kissed me on the cheek — they were so cute when they didn't look like devils.

And I decided to enjoy the house for myself a little bit, I turned on the music loud, took one of madame's brandy and chatted with friends on the cell phone, lying on the couch, mixing a shot of brandy with a packet of biscuits. I ended up falling asleep, I don't know what time, but when I woke up, it was close to lunch time and that man I saw last week was turning down the volume of the music, he turned around signaling for silence. I stood frozen on the couch, "was there any hallucinogenic drug in that brandy?"  I thought

"SILENCE. YOU WILL WAKE UP MY BABIES"

That black man spoke, with an absolutely frightening voice that sounded like it came from a cave because it echoed throughout the house.

The entity then walked out the door. I wanted to go after it, but I still didn't know what I had seen, my legs were shaking. I didn't even know if I was still awake, if that was a very realistic nightmare.

A few minutes later, the boys came back from the birthday party, they told me that I looked very handsome today and went towards the bedroom, I asked them to wait and asked if they knew a black man who was a firefighter and if he visited the house often.

The boys lowered their heads, I asked them again and they remained silent, I knelt down and held them steady and asked them more harshly and in a louder voice.

"FUCK LITTLE DEVILS, WHO THE FUCK IS THAT BLACK GUY THAT WAS HERE JUST NOW? TELL ME!"

I felt a hand pulling my hair and I fell, the same man was there again, but now I could see his face, it was scary

"I SAID SILENCE. YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP MY BABIES" he said again

Then I was knocked out.

It was close to midnight when I woke up on the living room floor, my head hurt a lot and I was very hungry and thirsty, I had been unconscious for almost 12 hours, everything was dark. I went to the kids' bedroom, woke up one of them and asked "what's going on? Please William, you're already a big boy, I need you to tell me, who was that guy? What do you want to tell me?"

"Dad said he doesn't want to see you at the house again next week."
Already scared enough that I could barely speak without stuttering, but I asked "who is your daddy?" 
"You talked to him this morning. He doesn't like you. He said you look like mom. You can talk to him because he's still here."

The light in the bedroom went out, I started praying and begging whatever was there to let me out. The door opened and I ran as fast as I could and left the house without even packing my stuff.

I told dad everything and he obviously didn't believe anything I said.

"Okay. You can cut off all my cards, even prohibit me from traveling on vacation. You can do anything, but I beg you to not let me work in that house anymore."

It's hard to move people who have never seen you as worthy of any compassion. But dad finally found me another job at another house. I'm still working with the Fenninghams, now it's been 3 months of caring for a disabled child.
