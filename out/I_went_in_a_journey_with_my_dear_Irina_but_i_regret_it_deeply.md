It was late in Sovanog, and I was sharpening my sword on a blazing grindstone under the fiery moon of the black sky. Wyverns and Givras flew through the twilight sky, and the castle of Kompaj could be seen in the distance, with its grand towers. I was just a knight, along with Isingar and Grenur, the brothers famous for decapitating the Observer Arthardni’son, who possessed the Blood Ring. The Blood Ring had been discovered by Giges, a servant of the king who was searching for gold in the River Bakhit. He saw a glint at the bottom of the river, mistaking it for gold, but it was a ring that shone brighter than a thousand suns, enchanting Giges' eyes like love at first sight. Giges put on the ring, and that was his corruption... The ring made him immortal and able to turn invisible; it didn't take long for him to be corrupted by the Ring and start committing horrible deeds to claim credit. If we know this story today, it's because something went wrong, and it did.  
  
Ancient Liches sensed the presence of the ring and stole it from Giges, driving him to madness and leading him to commit a massacre in the chapel of Saint Engelbert. Giges fled, and to this day, neither he nor his body have been found, but the Ring was handed by the Liches to Arthadni’son, their leader. With the Ring, Arthadni’son was able to lead an army that attacked the city of Heidrun, which would later become Ecgberht, a city where Liches, enslaved creatures, and a few Dragons lived with an immeasurable fortune, feeding on the souls of the poor Halflings from Halflingville. But it didn't last for long, as the brave brothers Isingar and Grenur, along with the legendary archer Halteven’ur, embarked on a journey and reclaimed the fortune, along with the Blood Ring, which is now guarded in the Sacred Palace, within a vault equipped with feared traps throughout the realm.  
  
For all of Sovanog, the brothers were legendary figures, but I had known them since childhood, they were as normal to me as the priests of Saint Engelbert. I was a knight after the Golden Age of Chivalry; the knights were in decline. I caught myself thinking about it while sitting on a mountain, gazing at the horizon; the feeling of being part of a faction that was coming to an end weighed heavily on my chest. But I had a motivation... Irina Yeloin, the Angelic Nymph. Irina performed in shows all over the realm; she was the private dancer of Count Aloismat Aduhr, who needed beautiful nymphs to bolster the image of the tyranny of the Red Brotherhood. Nymphs were beautiful girls who also fought for the Brotherhood, skilled in wielding curved sabers like no one else.  
  
The first time I saw Irina was in a theater performance, where she portrayed the historic defeat of the Tiefling Abagnor, the greatest con artist of Ulvenreigh, who impersonated nearly 200 people across the realm and managed to deceive even the queen.  
  
Her movements on stage were not just those of a nymph but, to my eyes, those of a goddess. Her body swayed to the rhythm of the requiem with the grace of an eagle feather in the wind. When the performance ended, I went to the back of the stage to congratulate her on the play, but I noticed that her gaze was sad, defeated, fallen like a victim. I asked what was wrong and offered support to the damsel, who spoke with me in the garden, sharing a flask of beer. She told me that her life as a nymph was difficult and that she had overheard her lord talking to the king in person, mentioning that a certain Plague was spreading and it could be the end of everything. That day, we danced in the garden to the sound of an ancient "waltz" composed by the legendary maestro Mankevikn, the beautiful piece "Path of the Empty Earth."  
  
We continued to see each other, even in secret. Knights needed to dedicate their lives to their duty, never to be distracted by carnal pleasures. But Irina wasn't a carnal pleasure; she was a flame that burned in my chest. I walked past a fallen tree, feeling the dry branches bend over me... Was this the place where we used to meet? This place we had dreamt of returning to so much? Oh, true passion, where have you gone? All that remains now is pain and suffering. I find myself sitting under the tree where we used to meet. I'm getting old and need something to lean on, to remember at least a single pleasant strand of youth, but all that's left are ruins and sorrow.  
  
Irina went to her lord and told him that she had overheard the conversation, and that her dream was to embark on an adventure, to have a purpose in life. Initially, her lord was furious for being eavesdropped on, but he eventually accepted Irina on her journey to try to contain the Plague. She came to tell me, and I felt she was crazy. I shouted at her for the risky decision, but she said that without a purpose, she didn't even know why she was alive. After much reluctance, I let her go, but I accompanied her on her journey. The days were torturous, we walked through swamps, faced dreadful creatures, like a chest I found in the middle of the forest that, when opened, turned out to be a mimic. Upon opening the "lid," its gaping maw was revealed, ripping off my hand instantly. Irina had to use pyromantic magic to stop the bleeding, but it burned my arm like lava. Although the paths were treacherous, I was no longer afraid. Irina and I faced valleys and more valleys, ruins upon ruins, and we always managed to come out on top. We were no longer afraid; whatever was going to appear, we would defeat it...  
  
I wish it were true...  
  
At one point, we entered the Gates of Heaven and were confronted by a Capra, which almost decapitated Irina with a single blow. We did an excellent job distracting it, and I tore out its heart with my bare hands, causing it to fall like a weight that shook the interior. There before us, indistinct, was the Plague. There was no doubt, it was the dreaded Plague. A source of darkness, abyss, and despair that one could feel just by looking at it. Around it, not hundreds, but thousands; not thousands, but millions; not millions, but countless skeletons of humans, orcs, dwarves, and even a few aarakocra who had tried to approach the Plague. As we gazed at it, we already knew what it meant—we would be just two more skeletons among that pile. Then, from the darkness, emerged an indescribably terrifying figure: large, hunched, with gray and thick skin marked by deep, repugnant wounds, some covered with flies and larvae devouring the creature's disgusting flesh.  
  
The creature approached us and uttered something in an unknown language, but what surprised me was what happened next: Irina seemed to understand what he was saying and communicated with him. I didn't understand anything, but I could hear them repeating something like "azgul mora" several times, until Irina came back to me and said that there was only one way to stop that plague, and that if something wasn't done, it would spread, turning the entire realm into corrupted bloodthirsty and soul-hungry creatures, and it was better to sacrifice one soul for all.  
  
I asked what she meant by that, but she just kissed me and bid me farewell. I held her hand with tears in my eyes, but inevitably her hand slipped from mine, making a tear fall from her eye before she threw herself into the darkness, leaving me there... powerless... with my beloved having just thrown herself into the abyss. After minutes had passed, the darkness dissipated, sucking the creature back into its "hole" and disappearing into the thin air. I returned home desolate, with no reason to live; my beloved had gone, and I couldn't do anything about it. I informed her lord, who congratulated Irina for her courage but took credit for the journey, forever remembered as Behnek the Brave.  
  
But Irina didn't just disappear; not long after, soldiers were found mutilated at the Gates of Heaven, on top of the mountain. Like the true knight who had been there, Behnek ordered me to go on a journey to see what was there and whether the Plague had somehow returned. I confess that I would give anything for the Plague to actually have returned, because what I saw that day was worse than any other possible possibility: There, in place of the Plague, was Irina. Unrecognizable; her body hadn't changed, but she wore a veil over her face to hide the horrendous creature she had become. The lower half of her body was black, almost like viscous branches merging with the ground; her arms were also like branches fused with the environment. Irina, my beloved, in all her innocence, was now just a corrupted creature that had mutilated all those soldiers. I stood in front of her and looked into her eyes through the veil, hoping she might recognize me. I'm not even sure if she looked into my eyes, as the veil covered her face. I got closer to her and caressed what I could call her body, hoping that deep down, within that horrendous creature, my beloved still existed.  
No matter what happened next, it doesn't really matter. Now I have my hands on my abdomen, blood gushing out, and my beloved isn't here to cauterize. Maybe she is; I look up and see her face covered by the veil, but the more blood I lose, the more I see my Irina in that horrendous creature. I only hope she's waiting for me wherever she is, and that she isn't truly bound to that creature.
