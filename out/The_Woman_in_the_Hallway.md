I had a hard time sleeping as a child, I still do. When I was a kid though, my parents said it didn’t become a problem until we moved to Arizona. I was newly 3, spunky, and not adjusting well to the new move. I got my very own bedroom, when I was used to sharing with my older brother in our old house, I didn’t like being alone.

My bedroom was at the end of a long hallway, opposite my older brother. Our house opened up into a big dining room, bright kitchen/living room, and a hallway that led to the bedrooms and bathrooms. There wasn’t any natural light in the hallway so it’s always been dark, not a huge problem. But always dark.

The hallway scared me, I would imagine monsters from Disney movies hiding in the shadows, ready to reach out and grab my nightgown. I would make my parents check for monsters every night, and then made one of them lay with me until I fell asleep.

One night, after my mom read me a book and snuggled up to me, she drifted off first. I laid next to her, closer to the wall while she was closer to the door, turning through the pages of the book we had just read to see the pictures again.

I remember the feeling.

The hair on the back of my neck shot up, I had never felt that before. I looked at my window, I didn’t see anything outside but something was still… off. I looked at my open bedroom door and my heart almost exploded.

There was a woman standing in my doorway.

But I couldn’t see her face, because she was just a dark, looming figure.

She was tall, around 6 feet. And I could tell she had bob-length hair. She was wearing what appeared to be a long flowing dress. And she was just, staring.

I started to jostle my mom, but she wasn’t waking up.

Then she started approaching my bed, reaching out her hand towards me.

Whispers sounded in the room, seemingly coming from every corner.

“Come… I’ve missed you… My baby… We can be together…”

She was now at the foot of my bed.

My breathing was heavy, and I can’t explain why, but I reached my hand towards hers.

Her shadowy hand wrapped around mine.

The moment we touched, the whispers started again.

“I’ll keep you safe.. this time..”

The grip tightened, not in an angry way, like she was scared.

She started pulling, gently. Urging me towards her, but I knew if I went.. I would never come back.

I remember I cried out quietly, pure terror ran up my arms and felt like fire. I buried my face into my mom and started to cry, and when I looked up again, she was gone.

My crying woke my mom and I told her there was a woman in our house, she woke my dad and they searched the house but found nothing. No lock had been touched, no window had been unlocked. They told me it was probably a nightmare, and to go back to sleep. I believed that, for a few days, but in the back of my mind I knew… I wasn’t dreaming.

Years and years went by, I never got another visit from the tall woman. But sometimes I felt a chill when I was in the hallway, just for a second. Or I would feel a sweeping hand on my shoulder, like someone would touch you kindly to say hello.

When I was 20 I was sitting with my mom in the backyard chatting, when I brought up the tall woman, and asked if she remembered that night. She was quiet for a moment and said she did, and surprisingly, asked what else I remembered. I described her appearance, how I felt, how my mom didn’t wake when I shook her. And my mom was staring off in the distance, contemplative look on her face.

“I didn’t tell you because you were so little, I didn’t want to scare you. But I’ve seen the woman you’re describing..”, my mom stated.

My mouth opened slightly, I was shocked.

My mom took a long sip from her tea and looked at me.

“I have seen her. In the mornings when I wake up with your dad for work.. I’ll see a figure pass through the hallway and think it’s your dad but.. The first time was the most horrifying. I saw the figure again, but when I checked, your dad was in the shower.. so it couldn’t have been him.. When I walked down the hallway to check on you and your brother, I saw both your bedroom doors were open. Which was odd, when I got closer I saw her. She was standing at your door, looking in on you. I gasped, and she turned to me. I couldn’t see her face, but she vanished. I cried out and it woke both of you up. I gathered you both and I told you we were going to get surprise pancakes to calm down.. but she was there, I know it was her..”, she stared off, fixating on the wind chime blowing in the wind.

We started talking about her, what kind of spirit she is, if we thought she was malicious or not. We were really into the conversation. I asked if she ever told my dad, she said she didn’t. My dad is not religious, doesn’t believe in ghosts, nothing of the supernatural sort. She said she wasn’t sure how he would respond to her, so she just kept it to herself because the spirit didn’t feel angry to her.

During the conversation my dad ended up coming home and walking outside, asked us who we were gossiping about, with a warm smile.

I decided I was feeling brave.

“We were talking about something I thought I saw when I was little, a shadowy woman in the hallway..”

He was still, his eyes went wide.

“You both have seen her too?”
