The police car turned on its sirens behind me. I looked down the dark forest road, seeing nobody. At 2 AM in this backwoods town, everyone had already gone to bed. Or was it even 2? My head felt fuzzy, and I couldn’t remember how I had gotten there. I just remember driving down an endless black road, and before that…

I rolled down the window. The police car stayed far behind me. I saw both police officers get out and crouch behind their open doors while they pointed black shotguns at my car.

“Driver!” the cop on the passenger’s side called. “Roll down your window and turn off your car. Do it now!” I already had the key turned to the accessory position rather than in ignition mode, but I quickly rolled the driver’s window down and plucked the keys out. My heart hammered in my chest and my mouth felt like sandpaper. I looked around worriedly, wondering what had caused all of this. I hadn’t killed or robbed anyone that I could remember, yet they acted like they had just caught Ted Bundy himself in a VW Bug with a kit containing a ski mask, handcuffs, a fake cast and a box of amyl nitrates.

“Driver!” the policeman droned. “Throw your keys out of the window! Do it now!” I threw the keys out the window.

“Driver! Open the door and put your hands out of the car! Get out slowly! Do it now!” Very slowly, I moved out of the car with my hands up. “Now, driver, keep your hands in the air. Do not make any sudden moves. Do NOT turn around. Do not move your hands anywhere near your body. I want you to walk backwards towards the sound of my voice. Do it now!”

I walked backwards down the dark side of the road, nearly tripping on stones and branches. I was terrified that if I fell, I would be filled with more lead than Flint, Michigan’s water supply. At that point, I had so many guns pointed at me that I felt like John Dillinger leaving a movie theater. Not to make light of the situation; at the time, I seriously thought I was going to die.

“Get on your knees and keep your hands in the air! Do it now!” I slowly got to the ground, kneeling. A few moments later, I felt my arms wrenched behind my back, painfully pulling at my shoulder. I swore in pain.

“Watch out, that fucking hurts!” I cried.

One of the cops roughly dragged me up my cuffed wrists, spinning me around to face him. He leaned close to me, whispering in my ear. I could smell the stale coffee on his breath.

“You fucking sicko. You are a real piece of garbage, you know that? What you did makes me want to throw up. The guys in prison hate people like you, and I’ll be glad to hear that you’re dead too, soon enough. You remember what happened to Jeffrey Dahmer?” He pushed me hard against the hood of the police car.

Then they brought me down to the station. On the way there, I thought back on how I got here, only catching glimpses of the truth.

\*\*\*

I waited in the small concrete room, looking at the white-washed brick walls, wondering what came next. A minute later, two detectives walked into the room.

The man in the lead looked like a human walrus. He had small, watery eyes, a large  bristling mustache over his thin lips, and a massive barrel-chest with a gut that pushed against the buttons of his police shirt. The buttons looked like they would fly off at any moment from the tension, yet miraculously, they stayed put.

“Hey, Gabriel,” the large man said, pulling a chair out from the table and sitting down with a heaving sigh. “My name is Detective Carmichael. This is Detective Minervini-” he gestured to the other police officer sitting next to him, a thin, serious man with dark Italian features. “-and we’re here to listen. That’s all we’re doing. We just want to hear what you have to say.” I nodded.

After they read my Miranda rights, they spent the next few minutes asking me basic information, like my address, my phone number, when I moved to my current location, how many cars I had, where I worked and so on.

I’m not a stupid man. I know how such things work. The detectives try to get a baseline reading on someone by asking them various trivial details about their lives before jumping into the crime. They notice their body language, expressions, tone and speech patterns while telling the truth.

Sometimes they would bring in a lie detector test, but what they don’t tell subjects is that lie detector tests are inadmissible in court and scientifically useless. There has never been any evidence showing a polygraph can reliably determine truth from lies. Countless psychopaths have “passed” the polygraph and proved their innocence, including the Green River Killer.

But this is irrelevant, because the real purpose of the polygraph is to allow detectives to watch the subject’s body language during questioning and compare it to their baseline response. Some people get so freaked out by the idea of a polygraph that they begin mixing up stories and sweating, not realizing that their own body language betrays them more than random electrical impulses on a chart. In a sense, the polygraph is more psychological warfare than a machine, a way to fake people out before pressuring them into confessions.

“Gabriel?” Detective Minervini asked. “You still with us?” I looked up suddenly, realizing I had gotten lost in my thoughts and stopped listening to the conversation.

“Sorry, what?” I said.

“Where were you today? Give us a timeline of events from the moment you woke up,” he said.

“Today…” I said contemplatively, reflecting back on the worst day of my life.

\*\*\*

I woke up, groggy from not getting enough sleep. I had worked late into the previous night on a novel I was hoping to publish, vaping constantly and chugging cup after cup of coffee. Eventually, around 3 AM, I gave up on editing and decided to go to bed.

I looked at the clock, noticing it was only 8 AM. I got up, showering and making breakfast, trying to figure out what to do for the day.

I had lost my job a couple months earlier, and things had started getting desperate. I had maybe $500 in my bank account, which was all the money I had in the world to pay the rent, buy food and gas and cover all my bills. I knew I was screwed.

Over the last few weeks, I had put in hundreds of job applications. A lot of them were crap, minimum-wage or temp jobs that I would only take as a last resort.

My phone started ringing, and I looked down at the screen, seeing an unfamiliar number. A surge of hope ran through me.

“Hello?” I said. Static and chaos carried through the line. I pulled the phone away from my ear. After a couple seconds, a voice started coming through.

“Mr. Guardiani?” a female voice said.

“This is him,” I said. “Who’s calling?”

“Yes, hi, my name is Becky Mayer. I’m the head of human relations for Eyes Unlimited. We do surveillance and cameras and security, among other things. I was calling about a potential opening in our company.”

“I don’t remember ever applying to any company by that name,” I said, confused. “How did you get this number?”

“Oh, you were referred to us,” she said cryptically. “Or actually, maybe we found you online. Perhaps you put your resume on a job posting website?

“Anyways, would you be able to come in for an interview sometime today?” I asked about pay and benefits, and when she told me the job paid $25 an hour, I said I’d come down immediately. She gave me the address. I wrote it down on my phone and got changed into some nicer clothes before heading out.

I drove towards the capitol, about fifteen minutes away. My GPS started taking me into rougher and rougher neighborhoods. Used needles littered the streets and drug dealers in hoodies stood at every corner, watching cars that passed with hawk’s eyes.

“You have arrived,” the female robotic voice said as I finally pulled into an abandoned slum filled with empty factory and apartment buildings. I looked around nervously.

“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” I said. “Who would want to have a business located here?” But I assumed the rent must be extremely cheap, at least.

I looked around, seeing a sign for “Eyes Unlimited” in grimy, white letters over a black background. All around it, the sign had hundreds of eyes painted in- reptilian, human, avian, insectoid, bovine and some others that I don’t think were from this world.

“Weird,” I muttered. I looked around, realizing there were no cars on the street. A homeless man a half-block away was stumbling around, yelling at invisible enemies. His mind had clearly gone over the brink. Dressed in tattered rags, he looked like a concentration camp inmate- emaciated, his legs and arms like twigs, his eyes sunken like the water at the bottom of a deep well.

I quickly turned away, walking down the alleyway that led to the front entrance for the business. I saw a door painted a fresh gold, a heavy contrast to the layers of filth and grime that covered all the walls and windows of the other abandoned buildings in the area.

It had a buzzer at the front, a red button that flashed on with an inner light when I pushed it. A static noise came through the speaker and then a woman’s voice came over the intercom.

“Who is this?” she said. I gave her my name, and the door immediately unlocked with a buzzing sound.

I opened it and found an empty, half-lit hallway lined with statues and paintings. Some of them were truly bizarre: half-human abominations with reptilian eyes and skin, or ghostly creatures with stretched out, screaming mouths. I stopped to examine one when a voice rang out directly behind me, making me jump.

“Do you like them?” a short, plump woman with blonde hair asked. “They have cameras in them, each and every one. No one would ever see them. Who would ever suspect a camera in a work of art such as this, right?” A work of art, I thought to myself sardonically, repressing a laugh.

“I’m Becky,” the woman said, walking up to me and stretching out her hand. She looked totally nondescript, a typical faceless office worker in an endless company.

She had a thin, white-gold necklace with a strange symbol hanging from the bottom. It looked like a grim reaper’s scythe with a slashing, diagonal line through it. The white metal of the pendant sparkled over her red blouse, and a sense of trepidation rose inside of me. Something about that symbol…

“Hi, I’m happy to finally meet you. I really like these statues with cameras you have here,” I lied. She smiled, absolutely beaming with pride.

“Yes, thank you. This is a lifetime’s work. Each piece is personally designed by an artist. Some are specially ordered by wealthier customers who don’t want gaudy cameras all over their property, so they had them hidden within statues and turned an eyesore into an aesthetic triumph,” she said. “Other times, we even have very special works go up on auction, especially the ones made by Mr. Bower.”

“Mr. Bower?” I asked.

“Yes, he’s the person you’re going to see right now,” she said, turning and opening the door. In the next room, I saw a receptionist’s desk with chairs for waiting customers or visitors. Potted plants were placed randomly throughout, and against the walls and hanging from the ceiling, I saw more of those “works of art”. One had a bloody knight carrying his own smiling, skeletal head in his armpit, the eyes dripping from their sockets.

Personally, I was not impressed, but I know there’s a market for everything. A niche company selling professionally-made artist’s statues with hidden cameras and surveillance equipment inside might appeal to only a small audience, but, with enough rich customers, why couldn’t they have a successful business?

Becky continued to talk about the office and the artists as she led me down a long, thin hallway. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead as we walked over a drab, gray carpet the color of razor-wire.

As we got to the door, I realized I hadn’t asked her the most fundamental question of all.

“So what do you guys actually do here?” I asked. “Is this a manufacturing place?” She shook her head.

“No, no, the artists have their own studios and spaces to work. This is just an office building,” she said. “We just store them here and deliver them from here. The open position I called you about involves transporting certain works of art to customers all over the region. It doesn’t require a CDL or anything, don’t worry. But Mr. Bower will tell you more.” She turned, waving. “OK, good luck!”

I felt I had a much better grasp of the situation now. This “business” was really just a Halloween store for rich people, and the job itself was just a delivery man. I looked up at the wooden door, seeing the name “Dennis Bower” engraved in the door. I knocked.

“Come in,” a high, feminine voice called, dragging the words out. I opened it, walking inside.

An extremely fat man sat behind the desk. He had all the hair on his body shaved off. His eyes looked like little pig’s eyes. In fact, he gave off a porcine presence as a whole. The pink color of his skin and the way the fat bulged at the back of his neck made him look like some kind of horrible half-human, half-pig hybrid.

His chair groaned as he shifted his massive bulk. The buttons on his white shirt looked as if they might pop off at any moment.

A glint of silver caught my eye. I saw the same necklace on the man as I had seen on Becky. Looking around the office, I saw more paintings and sculptures with hidden surveillance equipment. Some of them looked like creatures from an HP Lovecraft story, humanoid beings with green tentacles and large, intelligent eyes. Others looked like something from a ketamine nightmare, like the painting with prancing green aliens skinning people alive and wearing their faces as masks as they laughed and danced.

“You like what you see, huh?” Dennis Bower said in a high, girlish voice, a slight lisp coming out as he spoke. “I did them all myself.”

“Yes, they’re very… uh… unique,” I said, giving him a fake smile. “I’ve certainly never seen anything like it.”

“Well, that’s the best compliment of all!” he said, opening a can of Coke and chugging the whole thing in one gulp. He threw the empty can in the garbage and turned to me. “So the job’s yours if you want it. I already saw your resume. You can start now. Interested?” This sudden shift caught me off guard, and I stuttered for a moment, thinking.

“Oh, yeah, I mean, OK, I guess,” I said. “Like right right now?”

“Yes. Do you have a car?” he asked. I nodded. “Good. We’ll reimburse you for any miles you drive. Gas plus wear and tear on the vehicle. That’s in addition to the $25 an hour and full benefits. After three months, you become eligible for a raise, too. Assuming your work is professional.” I nodded quickly. I felt light-headed and sweaty.

“I’ll work as many hours as you need!” I said quickly. “I could really use the money.” He smiled, nodding, showing off his small, white teeth. He licked his small, greasy lips, swiveling his head and peering around the office.

Finally, he found what he sought, and pointed at a large sculpture on a table. It had a snarling half-human half-dog on a marble foundation. The creature was gnawing on a human arm still wearing its denim sleeve. Dennis Bower said something, but I didn’t understand.

“What was that?” I asked.

“Dogman,” he said again simply. I nodded, waiting for more. “That’s what that is. This guy loves Dogman crap. Anyways, this is the address.” He wrote something down on a piece of paper in a looping cursive script, ripping it in half and handing it to me. As he said goodbye, I grabbed the sculpture and started heading back out towards the decaying slum outside.

\*\*\*

I had about an hour’s ride each way. After putting on Audible, I pulled off, seeing the homeless man down the street still screaming at imaginary enemies. It looked like a methamphetamine overdose, or possibly a psychotic break. Either way, I wasn’t getting involved.

Driving from the business to the address felt almost like watching a documentary on the extremes of wealth in the USA. I started at slums filled with garbage and abandoned buildings, and ended up in a rich area filled with mansions and pristine, dark forests. As I pulled onto the street Dennis Bower had written down, “Angel Trace Road,” I marveled at just how massive and ornate some of these houses were.

Most towered at least four or five stories overhead with swimming pools and mazes and statues in the yards. I saw a couple riding their own personal horses down the side of the road, and I could almost smell the money pouring off them.

Every house also had a gate and an intercom, and most also had security guards at the front. I went slow, seeing the security guards watching my car with squinted, suspicious eyes.

Finally, I pulled up at 77 Angel Trace Road. I saw a castle looming overhead with turrets that reached ten or eleven stories high. A security guard immediately got out of the booth and knocked on my window. I rolled it down and told him my name and business. He kept his hand near the holstered pistol at his side the entire time. Sighing, he went back into the guardhouse and, a moment later, the gate started rolling slowly to the side.

\*\*\*

I got out of the car, holding the heavy statue under one arm. I walked up the wide, marble steps towards the front door. I was about to knock when I saw a note in spiky, nearly illegible handwriting taped to the mahogany door. I pulled it off, squinting.

“Please come in. We will be with you in a moment.” I read it, an eerie feeling coming over me. I looked back down the private road, seeing the security guard staring at me intently through the glass window of his booth. I turned and opened the door, deciding I would just go inside and wait like the note said.

A rancid smell hit me as I entered the castle. It smelled like a rodent had died in the vents and began to decompose. I wondered how people with so much money could live with that fetid odor, even for a single day. I tried to breathe through my mouth, wondering how long this would take.

I walked around the entrance hall, admiring the massive Persian carpets covering the floor and the statues and paintings covering the walls. I was staring at an old painting of sailors on a heaving ship at sea when I heard a creaking floorboard behind me. I jumped.

“Oh, you scared me,” I said, turning and then freezing in my tracks. Three people stood there, wearing black jumpsuits and medieval plague doctor masks. All of them had long, gleaming knives in their gloved hands. Silver pendants with grim reaper’s scythes and a slashing, diagonal line hung from each of their necks.

For a long moment, no one said anything. I put my hands up, but they made no move towards me.

“You can have my wallet or whatever you want,” I said. “Just take it.” I took my wallet out with barely ten dollars in the fold and threw it towards them. They didn’t react, still standing like mannequins, their eerie masks giving them the look of psychotic, nightmarish birds.

I tried to think fast. They blocked the front entrance, but there had to be countless doors on a place this size. I needed to get out and get help from the security guard.

The three masked figures slowly angled their heads to the right in unison, as if I had said something interesting. I looked around, seeing a heavy wooden chair tucked into a desk a couple feet behind me. With a rush of adrenaline, I grabbed the chair and threw it at them.

Without looking back, I sprinted away, going deeper into the house, hoping to find another exit on the sides or back before they caught up with me. I could only imagine the sensation of the knives going in, slicing through the skin as effortlessly as a diver through the water’s surface.

I ran through a pair of swinging doors into a huge, dirty kitchen with multiple ovens and countless counters and sinks. As I took in the scene, I realized the kitchen was worse than just dirty. It had evidence of atrocities and cannibalism on every surface and utensil.

A human head stared at me from the counter, its eyes half-closed. The tip of its tongue stuck out through blue, stiff lips. Worst of all, someone had cut the top of the skull off, and now the head had no brain.

On frying pans with coagulated grease and swarms of houseflies, I saw human eyeballs, tongues, kidneys and other organs, some of them cooked, some not. Dishes with bones and half-eaten, cooked limbs littered other counters. I saw mice and rats scurrying away as I sprinted past, interrupting their meal in this den of nightmares.

Someone stepped out from behind a large, steel fridge. I ran straight into them, catching a glimpse of a black jumpsuit and a gloved leather hand as I fell. They stumbled before quickly righting themselves. They jumped on top of me, and I saw the flash of a syringe as it stabbed into my neck. I fought, kicking and punching, but waves of nausea and weakness began to run through my body, and my vision started turning black, and soon, I was no more.

\*\*\*

I came to for a few moments, seeing double and triple images blurring across my vision. I heard voices, as if from very far away. I saw the night sky outside through the window, the moonlight streaming down over the trees.

“So this is the new one?” someone said in a low, robotic monotone.

“Yeah, another lamb,” someone responded. “We’ll take some of his hair and make sure his fingerprints are on the scene. The ketamine should cause memory problems. He probably won’t even know how he got there when the cops finally catch up with him.”

“We might as well frame him for this place, too,” someone else said. The voices laughed.

“Sure, why not? We’ve got to find another place soon anyway.”

I remember going in and out of sleep, having strange hallucinations and visions. Time and space seemed liquid. For a while, I thought the abductors were aliens, and that their plague doctor masks were the real skin on their horrible faces.

As I sobered up a little, they finally put me in the driver’s seat of my car on an isolated side street. I still didn’t know where I was or what had happened. I could barely remember my name. I saw night had come. They left. After a while, I turned on my car and started driving.

Then I saw the flashing lights behind me, and suddenly, I started feeling very sober. I tried to remember how I had gotten there, but the truth kept slipping through my fingers, the memories fading away into darkness.

\*\*\*

I gave this story to my lawyer and asked him to make sure my family received it and put it online, as a way to warn others and try to get justice. Before I did so, I slouched on the metal chair, as if a heavy weight pulled me down. The lawyer continued to speak through the round vent in the plexiglass separating us as I wrote my experiences down.

“Well, they checked out that building you talked about, this ‘Eyes Unlimited’. There’s no sign and no business there. No one has rented that space in years,” he said. “And that castle on Angel Trace Road has no security guard. In fact, that place has been empty for years. The bank foreclosed on it and no one has bought it.” I groaned.

“Right now, you’re looking at the death penalty,” he said. “The public is out for blood in this case. They’re preparing over twenty counts of first-degree murder. There were a lot of people killed in horrific ways, and they only found your DNA and fingerprints at the crime scenes…”

“But I didn’t do it!” I said. He shrugged.

“It’s not about what you did or didn’t do. Everything in life is power, and who has the will to use it.” I felt hope drain from me as I sat there, seeing the future as just a solid wall in front of me, a wall as black and empty as an endless abyss.
