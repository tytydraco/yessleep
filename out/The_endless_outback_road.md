The sun was sinking low over the Stuart Highway, a big red eye glaring down on the dusty stretch north of Alice Springs. I’d been rattling along in my beat-up Land Cruiser for hours, the kind of drive that turns your head to mush. Endless spinifex and ghost gums flashing by, the radio crackling about cattle prices and wild weather. I was on my own, no one else in the cab, no phone signal worth a cracker out here. Just me, a warm esky of VB, a shit beer, and a restless urge to shake things up.

That’s when I spotted it. About 50 kilometers past the last roadhouse, a faint track peeled off the blacktop to the east, like someone had scratched a line across the dirt with a stick. Dead straight, cutting through the scrub like it meant business. No sign, no fence, just two wheel ruts baked into the gibber, disappearing into the haze. I slowed down, idling next to it. Looked like one of those old station tracks, maybe leading to a windmill or some forgotten ruin. Five kilometers, maybe a few minutes tops. No worries, I thought. I’d have a look at whats down there, take a photo, and be back on the highway before dark.

I turned off, setting the trip meter on my odometer. The tyres crunched onto the dirt, and the world shrank. No more highway drone, just the low rumble of my engine and the tick of hot metal cooling. The track was spot-on. Straight as an arrow, edged by low mulga that brushed the sides. I figured it was some old station hand’s shortcut, left to fade away. Ten minutes in, nothing but horizon. Twenty, and the fuel gauge hadn’t twitched. “Any tick of the clock now,” I mumbled, wiping sweat off my face. The aircon was humming, but the heat snuck in anyway, a dry blast that glued my shirt to my back.

That’s when the sunk cost kicked in. It’s always that nagging voice that leads you down the worst paths: *You’ve come this far. what if it’s just over the next hill? Turn back now, and you’ll kick yourself later.* I switched off the radio to save power, cracked another beer. The track didn’t budge. No ruins, no posts, no fresh tyre marks. Just nothing. At 20 ks, it changed. The ruts curved left, dodging a dry creek bed, then swung right around a dune. Narrower now, the scrub closing in like a mate who won’t take a hint. Branches scraped the paint, and I winced, picturing the damage. But it kept pulling me deeper. The sun dipped, turning the sky a bruised purple, and shadows stretched, making every tree look like it was watching.

By 100 km, my phone was gone to shit. I’d been fiddling with it. My spotty signal teasing me. Then the screen died. Plugged in the charger, and it sparked, the cable melting into a gooey mess. “Bloody hell,” I muttered, ripping it out. No GPS, no maps, no emergency call. Just the compass on the dash, wobbling in the heat. The aircon conked out next. It was just the weak cough, then silence. The cab turned into a sauna, 50 degrees easy, the dash warping like cheap plastic. Sweat stung my eyes, tasting like regret. I wound down the windows, but the hot wind rushing in was worse, carrying a weird metallic hint of ironbark and something sharper, like a storm that never hits.

I kept going. Had to. The track wound tighter now, a twisty path through thickening mallee, branches clawing at the doors like they wanted in. No birds, no roos. just the crunch of gravel and my ragged breathing. *It’ll end,* I told myself. *Any tick of the clock now.* But the odometer kept climbing: 150… 200… 250. Night crashed down, stars stabbing through like cold pins. My headlights cut yellow paths into the dark, showing nothing but more track, more scrub. The compass said east, but it felt like nowhere. I stopped once when my legs were shaky, heart thumping. I heard a whisper in the wind. Just thirst messing with me.

At 362 kilometers, I lost it. The track stretched ahead, relentless, a pale line into forever. No end, no horizon break. My water was gone, the esky a soggy mess from spilled beers. The Cruiser’s engine sputtered, steam hissing from the hood. *Turn back,* the sane bit of me yelled. I cut the engine, sat in the dark, listening to the tick-tick-tick of cooling metal. Follow the ruts back. Easy.

It wasn’t.

The track had forked. Faint spurs I’d missed on the way in. Overgrown paths veering off into the mulga. In my panic to reverse, I took one by mistake. Or maybe not. The headlights caught it late: a narrower track, rutted deep, pulling left where I’d come straight. I corrected, but the bush thickened. acacias like barbed wire, spinifex that’d shred tyres. No way to push through; you’d need a dozer for this lot. Hours melted into loops. I’d drive, backtrack, pick a “main” line, only for it to split again. The sun rose. day two? roasting the cab into an oven. My lips cracked, tongue like sandpaper. Shadows danced at the edges, eyes in the scrub, maybe. The compass lied now, or I did, squinting through salt-blinded eyes.

Thirst tore my throat raw. I licked condensation from the windows, sipped radiator overflow when it cooled. It just tasted like copper and despair. Days? Two? Three? The odometer froze at 450 out, then back, then out again. The track mocked me, looping like a nightmare maze. No highway. No ruins. Just the endless red thread, pulsing with my tyres.

Then, a miracle. A glint ahead. White paint in the glare. A van. Parked at a dead-end where the track fizzled into scrub. Looked brand new: a Toyota HiAce, maybe, panels shiny, tyres fat with air. Relief hit like a cold drink. *Someone’s here. Help.* I lurched the Cruiser to a stop, gravel spitting. Stumbled out, legs like jelly, and staggered over. The van sat silent, the door ajar a crack. No engine hum, no radio. Just… perfect, like it’d rolled in yesterday.

I knocked on the window with three taps. “You there? Anyone?” My voice croaked, barely mine. No answer, so I looked in. The driver’s seat hosted a shadowy figure, dash lights glowing faint, clock stuck at 3:47. Desperation whispered. Smashed the window with a rock, glass shattering like brittle bones. Climbed through, shards slicing my palms, warm blood slicking the seat.

He was there. Slumped against the wheel, head dropped forward, skin pale but not dried out.Nnot outback mummified. Fresh. Too fresh. Eyes half-open, milky but clear, staring at the glovebox like it owed him something. No flies yet; just a faint blue tinge to his lips, a dark trickle from his nose. No stiffness. Limp like he’d nodded off mid-thought. The cab smelled of absolutely nothing. No rot, just that sharp ozone tang again, like a storm that wouldn’t break. A half-drunk Coke bottle in the console, cold beads on the glass. I grabbed it, gulped, the fizz scorching my throat like a lifeline.

His keys dangled in the ignition. Phone on the dash with a dead screen, same as mine. Map book open to a blank page, scribbled with loops: *Turn back? No end. Circles.* My handwriting? No. His hand, clenched on the gearstick, nails chewed to bloody stubs. I froze. In the mirror, my face stared back, with older, hollowed, eyes sunken like his. Wait. The reflection blinked out of sync.

Outside, the mallee rustled. Whispers again, louder, *any tick of the clock now.*

I slid into the passenger seat, blood smearing the door. His body slumped next to me, cool as stone, breath ghosting my neck in a sigh that wasn’t wind. The heat sank into my bones, a heat that didn’t cool. The clock froze at 3:47, flies buzzing faint at the cracked window, their hum a dirge. My lips tingled blue, mirroring his, and I knew. No escape. No horizon. Just this, sitting here, next to him, the man who’d met the same end, his milky eyes staring at nothing I could see. I accepted it, the weight settling like dust on a coffin lid. Death was the only way out, and I’d wait for it here, forever.

Thirst? Gone. Heat? A memory. Just the wheel, the ruts, the horizon pulling. Any tick of the clock now, it’ll end. The clock froze again. 3:47. Flies buzzed faint at the window.

But I could swear I was hearing whispers, twisting from laughter into words. *stay... sit... forever*. The dead man’s head lolled toward me, his milky eyes catching the dash light, pupils dilating like black holes. His mouth twitched, a blue-lipped grin cracking open, and for a heartbeat, I swore I saw teeth that weren’t his - jagged, whispering my name. Flies thickened, crawling from the vents, their legs tickling my arms like accusations. The heat turned sour, heavy with the first faint rot I’d missed, and nausea hit like a road train. Bile was rising, hot and coppery from the sun’s rays.

No. Fuck this. As bad as dying out here was, rotting slow next to *him*, that fresh-corpse stink blooming, his weight sagging against me like a lover gone wrong, sickened me deeper than the thirst. Eternity? Not like this. Not pinned in this metal coffin with a stranger’s corpse for company, watching my own skin prune and split. I’d go quick. End it on my terms. A smash, a crunch, lights out before the maggots moved in.

I shoved him off - his body flopping limp against the wheel with a wet thud - and clawed out through the shattered window, glass raking fresh lines down my arms. Blood trailed behind me, dark smears on the white paint, as I staggered back to the Cruiser. It sat there, hood still steaming faintly, a faithful wreck. Keys in the ignition, tank maybe a quarter left. Enough. I fired it up, the engine groaning back to life like an old mate dragged from the pub floor, and floored it. All I needed was a tree, a rock, something solid. The track blurred under the headlights, ruts jolting my teeth, and the whispers chased me: *turn back... sit... you’re already there.*

One kilometer. Two. The mallee closed in, branches whipping the windscreen like bony fingers. At three my vision tunneled, spots dancing, the dashboard gauges swimming in heat haze. At four the whispers howled, a chorus of *circles... endless...* and I laughed, a cracked bark that tasted like madness. Five. The track finally bent sharp at a 45-degree hook I hadn’t clocked before, snaking around a thick stand of mallee. No steering. No brake. Just the wheel locked straight, pedal buried, and the world tilting as the front guard kissed bark.

Crunch. The brittle scrub exploded inward, eucalypt limbs shattering like matchsticks, the Cruiser plowing through in a green storm of leaves and splinters. Metal screamed, tyres left the ground, and we rolled. Once, twice, a sickening barrel over gibber and roots. Glass starred, the roof buckled, and I blacked out mid-spin, the whispers fading to a dull roar.

When I came to, the world was upside down. Blood rushed to my skull, pounding like a hangover from hell, and pain lanced everywhere. Ribs cracked, arm numb, the seatbelt carving a welt across my chest. The engine ticked dead, fuel leaking sweet and acrid. I blinked through the grit, expecting the gibber plain, the endless track. But the roof wasn’t kissing dirt. It was kissing pavement, sealed smooth, dusted with red ochre. The Stuart Highway. Stars wheeled above through the cracked windscreen. Not stars. Headlights. Distant, but closing. Roaring engines, road trains maybe, their low-beams slicing the night.

I’d looped. All those circles, forks, and fever-dream detours had bent me back on myself, spitting me out just a stone’s throw from where I’d started. Hundreds of kilometers on my odometer’s trip meter, but I ended up looping my way back. The van guy... he hadn’t looped right. Had no idea he was so close to help, gave up in the heat, sitting pretty while help rumbled past unseen. Poor bastard. I cried till tears mixed with the blood on my face. Engine brakes from a truck roared nearby until it stopped, the sound of the truck door opening. Rescue. Bloody miracle.



Three months later, the pub at Hotel Victor hummed with the usual Friday arvo crowd: salt-crusted fishermen nursing schooners, grey-nomads swapping tales over bowls of chips. Victor Harbor felt a world away from the red dust. Adorned by blue bay views and seals barking on the rocks, the air felt extra crisp tonight with the beautiful scent of sea salt. I was at the corner table, half-cut on Great Northerns, mates clustered round. Big Jordy with his gut spilling over his belt, Mick nursing a stubby and a sunburn, and my missus Sarah off in the ladies’ sorting herself out.



“...and then, get this, the van’s clock ticks back to 3:47, flies everywhere, and the dead bloke’s grinning at me. Proper eerie shit. I leg it back to the Cruiser, floor it five kays, and bam. Smash into a tree, roll the bastard over. Wake up upside down, thinking I’m done for, but the roof’s kissing the bloody highway. Looped the whole way back without knowing.”

Jordy snorted into his pint. “Bullshit, mate. You reckon you pulled a U-turn through the multiverse? Next you’ll say the outback’s got wormholes.”

Mick leaned in, smirking. “Or you just nodded off after too many VBs, dreaming. That ‘fresh corpse’? Probably a scarecrow. And the whispers? Maybe it was just the wind. What a joke.”



I grinned, raising my glass. “I get it, you don’t believe me. Can’t blame you for that. But the cops towed that HiAce out the next day. They said the driver was some old pom tourist who’d wandered off three days prior. Dehydrated, heart gave out. They found my blood on the door, glass in his lap. Real as the beer in your hand.”



They chuckled, taking the piss but buying the next round anyway. The telly above the bar flickered to the races at Morphettville, nags thundering down the straight. I’d chucked $120 on a long-shot grey called Desert Whisper - a cheeky nod to my nightmare. Even at 80-to-1 odds, the horse surged past the post by a nose.



The bar erupted. “Holy shit! Yours?” Jordy bellowed, slapping my back.



Payout hit: $10,000 even, crisp notes sliding across the bar top. I pocketed it quickly, heart racing, as Sarah emerged from the bathroom, oblivious, her hair a mess, a smile lighting her face as she rejoined us. No one had spilled it yet. Perfect. I stood, the room fading to a hum, and dropped to one knee, the cash a warm secret in my pocket.

“Sarah,” I said, voice steady despite the nerves, “we’ve got a house on Surfers Parade already, a dream life built together. Marry me?”

Her eyes widened, hands flying to her mouth. Then she paused, tilting her head with a grin. “I’m speechless. You’re really going to find the money for the wedding after you just lost your favourite car?”

I held her gaze, a smirk tugging my lips. “Love finds a way,” I said, then glanced back at the mates and gave them a quick wink. They stifled laughs, catching on, while Sarah’s smile grew, her “Yes!” bursting out like a firecracker. She launched into me, a huge hug that nearly toppled us both, her laughter ringing over the pub’s chatter. Tears streaked her cheeks as she kissed me, and the room erupted in cheers. Jordy was singing AC/DC loudly, Mick clapping like a madman.

The pub owner, a grizzled bloke named Ray, waded through with a grin, hauling two dusty bottles from the cellar. “The finest champagne we’ve got is on the house for you local legends!” he boomed, popping the cork with a flourish. Golden fizz spilled over, and glasses were thrust into our hands. We clinked them, Sarah’s grip tight on mine, her eyes shining with dreams of white dresses and vows.

The outback’s nightmare shrank to a scar on my arm, a tale for the table. With the house in Adelaide ours, the $10,000 a quiet promise for the wedding, and Sarah’s “yes” echoing, the red dust was a memory drowned in champagne bubbles. We drank deep, the pub a cocoon of light and laughter, a world away from those endless tracks.
