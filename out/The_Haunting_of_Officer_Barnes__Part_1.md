PC Adam Barnes had seen his share of oddities in the twelve years he’d served with the police in Ashton Hollow, a small town nestled in the countryside. The everyday crimes - drunken arguments, petty thefts, and the occasional domestic incident - had become monotonous. But recently, something had begun to stir beneath the surface. Something had changed in the town, and the strange whispers that had always circulated around Rookwell House seemed to carry a sharper edge now.

It started with the call, just as Barnes was about to clock off for the night. A late-night dispatch, the kind that often meant little more than a noise complaint or a stray dog causing bother.

“PC Barnes,” the dispatcher’s voice crackled over the radio. “We’ve got a disturbance at the Rookwell place. Sounds like something’s off.”

Rookwell House, abandoned for as long as anyone could remember, was a derelict mansion on the outskirts of town. Old stories and rumours about the place had become local legend - disappearances, strange noises, and the odd figure glimpsed in the windows. Most folks dismissed it as nonsense, but Barnes knew that in a small town, you didn’t ignore the strange things. The town’s history was littered with oddities best left undisturbed.

Barnes grabbed his jacket and keys, and, with a sigh, slid into the driver’s seat of his patrol car. As he turned the engine over, the cold of the night seeped into the vehicle, the hum of the car engine breaking the eerie silence of the darkened roads. He turned onto the winding path that led to the house, the headlights cutting through the thick fog that had rolled in.

The air grew heavier the closer he got to Rookwell. The trees along the roadside stretched their bare limbs toward him like skeletal fingers. The mansion loomed ahead, its silhouette like a shadowed beast against the low-hanging clouds. A relic of another time, it looked as though it had been forsaken by both man and nature.

Barnes parked his car a distance from the house, its crumbling façade silhouetted against the dim glow of the town’s far-off lights. The night was bitterly cold, and as he stepped out, the gravel underfoot crunched sharply in the silence. There was something unnerving about the place. Something that made his senses tingle with warning.

He walked up the rickety steps to the front door, the hinges creaking in protest as he pushed them open. The smell inside hit him almost immediately - decay, mould, and something far more sinister. He pulled his coat collar up, instinctively.

“Hello?” Barnes called out, his voice cutting through the thick, suffocating silence.

There was no response. Just the faint sound of the wind rustling through the broken windows.

Barnes stepped cautiously into the darkened hallway, his footsteps slow but deliberate. His torchlight flickered and cast erratic shadows across the disintegrating wallpaper and old furniture strewn across the floor. The place was more than simply abandoned; it felt… wrong.

Then came a sound. Faint at first, like the scrabble of claws against stone. Barnes’ heart rate quickened. He reached for his radio.

“This is PC Barnes. I’ve entered the property. No sign of anyone yet, but something feels off. Will update shortly.”

He didn’t wait for a reply, instead moving toward the source of the noise. As he passed through the threshold of what had once been the living room, the sound came again - closer now, almost like breathing.

“Who’s there?” His voice was tight, betraying the unease beginning to settle in his gut.

The sound stopped. Everything became still.

Then, from the shadows at the top of the stairs, he saw it.

A figure. Tall, emaciated, and dressed in tattered clothes. Its skin was sickly pale, and its eyes - those eyes - were black pits that seemed to absorb the light from his torch.

Barnes froze.

The figure stood at the top of the stairs, unmoving, staring down at him with a vacant, unsettling expression. Then, in a voice that sounded both distant and all too close, it rasped, “You shouldn’t be here, officer.”

Before Barnes could react, the figure vanished, its form melting into the darkness, as though it had never existed at all. The sudden silence that followed was suffocating.

“Bloody hell,” Barnes muttered, his hand tightening around his torch as he slowly backed away. “What the hell was that?”

He shook his head, forcing his breath to steady. There had to be a logical explanation. It was likely some local kids messing about. He’d heard the stories - silly urban legends about the house - but this wasn’t supposed to be real.

His instincts told him to leave, to get back to the station and call in the situation. But something - something kept him from turning around and walking back out that door.

Barnes stepped forward again, moving towards the stairs, the floor creaking beneath his boots with each step. As he reached the top, a deep, guttural growl vibrated through the floorboards, low and menacing.

It was close.

Barnes looked up to see a shadow in the doorway at the end of the hall. The figure stood there once more, but this time, it wasn’t just watching. It was grinning.

Its lips stretched impossibly wide, revealing rows of jagged teeth, glinting in the weak light. It stepped forward, its limbs unnaturally long and jerky. “Too late,” it whispered, its voice sending a chill up Barnes’ spine. “You’ve already entered their world. Now, there’s no escape.”

A flash of movement from behind - the man. The one he’d seen earlier in the corner of the room. His mouth moved, but no words came out.

Barnes’ heart pounded in his chest. “What’s happening here?” he demanded, his voice rising in pitch. “Who are you? What is this place?”

The figure’s head cocked to one side, as though amused. “This place is ours now. And soon, you’ll be, too.”

Barnes barely had time to react before the figure lunged. It was fast - unnaturally so. It was upon him before he could draw his gun, and the sharp, ice-cold fingers wrapped around his throat with terrifying strength.

Gasping, Barnes struggled, but the figure’s grip tightened, cutting off his breath. His hands clawed at the cold skin, but it was like grasping stone.

In his fading consciousness, he heard it - a voice, deep and raspy, from behind him. “Run… officer… RUN…”

A last, desperate surge of energy brought Barnes’ elbow up into the figure’s side, breaking the hold just enough for him to stumble away. His head spun, vision blurring, but he forced himself to turn and run.

He bolted down the stairs, his feet slipping on the broken floor, every step a frantic rush to escape whatever nightmare had taken hold of Rookwell House.

Behind him, the house seemed to groan and shift, as if alive. The growls and whispers followed, growing louder and more insistent.
