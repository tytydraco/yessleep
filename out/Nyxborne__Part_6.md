Wind billowed into my face as the helicopter touched down . The snowy area was fenced off, about two football fields in size. People milled around, soldiers and scientists. Julia and I followed Nathan off the heli and toward a tent. He’d been strangely quiet during the ride, only telling me to grab everything I had that could hurt a wendigo. Apparently this hunt wasn’t optional. 

Snow was falling as the morning sun plastered the flakes with an orange shimmer. I pulled my jacket tighter in an attempt to force the cold out. Julia held the flap of the tent open for me. Inside were at least forty hunters, and a large circular table with a large map of the area. Small dark lines were drawn on an overlay, making a large connecting path. Our location had one large blot on it.

“This mission is very dangerous,” Nathan noted. Every hunter stood at attention when he spoke, “We got reports of a wendigo about a week ago. Since then, five solo hunters and three teams have gone missing hunting it.”

His words set an icy feeling of anxiety on my spine. The call in my bones was louder here, a pull towards something unseen. Julia seemed to notice my fear and shifted so her shoulder was pressed against mine. The knowledge of her presence was nice, but it didn’t help.

‘There lines represent a cave system we’ve found under the area. We’ve set up camp on top of the main cavern, what we assume to be the nest,” Nathan tapped his finger on the blot, “Assuming entire teams were unable to complete this mission, we’re under the impression that this is a pack of wendigos.”

His words hung in the air with the crisp cold, a deadly warning. Jameson, who I just noticed was there, nodded and slung his rifle over his shoulder. I tightened the sheath of my sword on my hip and took a breath before Nathan finished his orders.

“A group will move through the tunnels and into the main cavern. That group will plant charges and blow it in two hours. The camp will move to the edges of what will be the crater, and that detonation will collapse the system, flushing the beasts out into an ambush.”

“How much do you wanna bet we’re the ones going in?” Julia whispered to me and I shut my eyes in an attempt to hide from her words.

“Jason, Harper, Julia, Dray, Jameson, and Davis will be the ones entering the cavern.”  
I turned to Julia with a blank stare.

 “I hate your sense of intuition.”

\*\*\*

The gaping mouth of the cave threatened to devour us whole as we approached it. The valley behind us faded into a distant memory, like the world was already sealing us out. Jameson had the charges loaded in his bag, every step making them clink like bones. Julia stood behind me as we pushed forward, our guns raised in preparation. No one spoke, breath alone felt too loud.

“This is Echo-1, we’re entering the tunnels,” Julia whispered into her radio. Even her voice sounded reluctant, like it didn’t want to allow the words to come forth. The first step inside took the light away. Just like that, the morning was gone. We were swallowed by stone. The entrance shrank behind us until it looked miles away. 

The tunnels weren’t natural. Every wall bore violence. Claw marks slashed the stone in thick gouges, a language of rage carved into the earth itself. They were layered, hundreds deep, like the creatures sharpened their claws here every day on purpose. The light of our flashlights only made the darkness look worse. Our beams shook as we walked, and I couldn’t tell if it was our hands trembling or the cave breathing.

Something changed about the air the farther we went. It grew warm, humid, like we weren’t stepping forward, but down. The smell hit next. Damp rot. Old blood. Rusted metal. It clung to my tongue like I’d licked the cave walls themselves. Every breath tasted wrong. Jameson slipped once, and the sound echoed forever, like something deep inside heard it.

We passed the first skeleton a few minutes in. A deer. Or what was left of it. All four legs were broken backward. Spine missing. The head twisted all the way around like it had tried to see what killed it. We stopped. Not because we wanted to, but because something primal inside us still remembered fear. Julia didn’t call it in. There was nothing to call in. There would be too much to say.

Then came the second body. This one human. Less decayed. A hunter, one that came before us. His rifle lay beside him, half-buried in dirt. His helmet was crushed flat like something had stepped on it and kept stepping. But what got us was his pose. His arm was stretched out behind him, fingers digging into stone. He hadn’t died standing. He died dragging himself away.

Our flashlights clicked against our guns as we moved deeper, and the cave narrowed tighter until we had to go single file. The walls brushed our shoulders like hands. Every squeeze made us slower, like we were being forced through a path of its choosing. A controlled descent. Not a hunt. Not anymore. A guided tour.

The walls vanished, spreading far along the sides of us. We’d made it to the cavern. Our lights didn’t have to confirm what my senses told me. There were so many bodies in here, torn to shreds, ripped apart so their insides were on display. I could see their silhouettes, shadows of pain, their lives extinguished in an instant of animalistic rage.

I was pulled from my trance by Julia, who pulled my arm slightly. The group had continued forward, setting charges on the large pillars that spotted the cavern. My light caught something and I froze. In the center of the cave was a large rock, carved by wendigo claws to make a giant spike that rose toward the roof like an outstretched hand.

“You ever seen a wendigo do anything like that?” Jameson asked me. I simply shook my head. 

A crackle came from our radios. A panicked voice erupted from the speakers.

“THIS IS\~ REQUEST EVAC\~ SOUTH ENTRANCE\~ ONE W\~ CAN’T SEE IT\~”

Screams and gunfire were coming from behind the voice, terror and panic.

“THERE’S ONLY ONE-”

 The voice was cut off by the sound of flesh tearing. A gargle of blood filling the lungs came over the airwaves before the broadcast shut down. 

The southeast entrance was the one we came from.

As if an unheard command was given to our entire group, the six of us sprinted for another entrance to the cave. Jameson pulled out the detonator, holding it just in case. We clambered down the tunnel, pushing ourselves as fast as we could. I glanced at the group as we came to the entrance.

“Where’s Dray?”

We were down one member. Davis turned back to the cave to enter, but Harper, an older gentleman who’d obviously seen many hunts judging by the scars on his skin, grabbed his shoulder.  
“If he’s not with us he’s dead, best bet is to just blow this sucker.”

Davis shrugged his grip off and turned toward the dark again, “I’m not going in dumbass.”

His words echoed off the walls of the cave, “Dray? Are you there?”

For the first few seconds, nothing came of it. The ambience of the falling snow surrounded us. But then…

“See anything?” Dray called. I breathed a sigh of relief, and my motion was mirrored by the group.

“Let’s move, these things could be anywhere!” Harper shouted. There was silence again. When I heard what came out of that cave next, I moved instinctively.

“REQUEST EVAC FROM THE SOUTH ENTRANCE!”

The voice from the radio came out of the cave, and I watched terror fill Davis’ face. I back away, keeping my gun trained on the entrance. The rest of the group followed.

Davis was too far behind apparently. Inexplicably, I watched as his arms were torn from his body. Nothing grabbed them, blood simply filled the air and they crashed into the snow with a scream of pain. Before Davis could have any more of a reaction than his pain, four large claw shaped holes pierced his chest.

We opened fire, silver bullets shredding through the air, bouncing off one area in front of Davis’ body. Whatever we were shooting at was invisible. Davis dropped to the ground and I watched snow be kicked up by whatever was moving. A voice filled the air around us, calling to us. Through the jumbled distortion of screams and cries, I heard one sentence from the man who’d warned us through the radio.

“THERE’S ONLY ONE!”

Gunfire came from around us, the team guarding this entrance had revealed themselves, firing into the empty woods. I heard bullets land and saw a flicker from the trees. Tall, lanky, moving faster than a wendigo should’ve been. People began falling, men torn apart by an invisible force, bodies yanked into the trees, their screams cut off by a crunch of terror.

I took a shot toward a soldier after he was pulled to his death. I heard my slug slam into something and watched the beast flash into existence. 

It was a wendigo, there was no mistake about that, but something was wrong. The monster was taller, maybe fourteen feet. Its dark purple skin was covered in scales that reflected the light of the sun as it peeked through the trees. An extra pair of arms came from its ribcage, holding onto a soldier’s arms as he fought to escape. Fur laced the monster's neck, making what appeared to be almost a massive scarf that covered its sternum. Its head pushed fear down my throat. This beast hadn’t taken an animal as its first kill.

A human skull sat on the wendigo’s head as it stared at me. Its bottom jaw was replaced by the wendigo’s. Its dark eyes looked me up and down. I could see its deep purple pupils meet mine, and a hideous smile crossed its mouth. Its jaw unhinged and it bit down on the soldier’s head, crushing it into mush. It dropped the corpse and I watched its scaled shimmer, before the entire beast vanished once again before my eyes.

Julia grabbed me and pulled me into a run. We tore away from the cave as the screams of soldiers continued behind us. I noticed Jameson a step behind, holding the detonator still. We ducked through trees, running until the chaos behind us ceased. I knew they were wondering the same thing I was; did the noise stop because we escaped it, or because the beast finished what it was doing.

Julia slid down the crest of a hill, peeking her head over it as we landed beside her.

“What was that?” Jameson panted in horror. I couldn’t respond. The feeling in my body had risen, pushing itself through my skin. The call had led me here, yet the reason remained unknown.

“A damn apex predator,” Julia coughed, the cold air stifling her lungs.

“Apex Wendigo…” I muttered, peeking over the bank. 

The snow had cleared. I could see further ahead into the forest. The trees created a void of mystery as white powder fell around them. The snow WAS still falling, so why….

My eyes flickered up to see a thin layer of snow floating in the air, a couple inches from my face. Something hot hit my nose, the smell of flesh and death. The worst feeling I could ever have filled my chest. The call to kill mixed with unadulterated terror. My body wouldn’t react, no matter how hard I pushed my limbs to raise my gun. Luckily, Julia was there. Her rifle went off, slamming into the Apex Wendigo’s head inches in front of me, and it winced backward. Its skin flashed again and the terrible sight became visible once more.

The monster’s four arms made short work of our attempts to attack. One grabbed my shotgun, throwing it to the side, and another broke Julia’s rifle in two. Jameson managed to land three shots on its chest, but the bullets didn’t hit its heart. The beast’s natural armor was too thick. A giant claw grabbed Jameson’s face, sinking its long claws into his eyes. His pained yelps were silenced by a thumb down his throat. 

The Apex Wendigo raised him into the air, bringing him down onto a rock with a sickening crack. Blood seeped from Jameson's head but that didn’t stop the attacker. The Wendigo repeated this action, bringing the now limp man down onto the rock over and over. The crunches filled my ears as I fumbled for my shotgun. When the creature was satisfied with its work, it turned back to us. I met it with a silver slug to the face.

The skull shattered, the exo-skull fragmenting into thousands of small pieces, mixing with the white of the snow. The Apex Wendigo’s arms all covered its face and the scream that escaped its mouth rattled me. It was a mix of human noise and animal, a shout of mimicry and pain.

It stumbled back, shaking its head and pulling its arms down. I noticed something strange as it revealed its face. The slug had stopped, snagged inside thick scar tissue that was wrapped around the beast’s face, like it had met a shotgun blast previously. 

The call in me peaked, the feeling reaching its climax as I recognized what stood before me. I had seen this beast before. Even as Julia pulled me into a sprint, I knew what I was facing.

The baby wendigo from years back, when my humanity was taken from me. I hadn’t destroyed its heart. Only its head. It had regrown, evolved. Now it was looking for me. Even worse, it most likely could feel me, the same way I could feel it. The same way I was called to it. 

Its mother’s DNA flows through my body freely, the source of my strength. By blood, the Apex Wendigo and I…

…are brothers.
