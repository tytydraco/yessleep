My story happened years ago when my son Ben was only 5.  As with any kid, he was becoming obsessed with the entire lore of Santa Clause - flying reindeer, a factory full of elves, naughty and nice list - everything.  When I had to pick up a few last minute gifts at the mall the week before Christmas, I bribed Ben with a visit to the mall Santa Claus to get him to behave while shopping.

I’d tell him, “Ben you know Santa’s watching, so you have to be good while we wait in line to get rung up.”

It  works like a charm - truly genius stuff by  whoever came up with the whole naughty and nice list thing.

Anyway, Ben behaved, and after the shopping was done, we got in the line for Santa Claus pictures, something I truly regret.  The exhibit was set up in the center of the mall.  As we came down the escalator, we were greeted by a massive Christmas tree, a Christmas village set, and even teenage employees dressed up as Santa’s helpers.  In the center of the whole spectacle was Santa himself, larger than life, on a massive throne, wearing a red suit and black boots.  Ben’s face lit up with excitement, and we quickly got in line.

When it was Ben’s turn, he excitedly ran to Santa and climbed into his lap.  After listing off a few toys, and reassuring the mall Santa that he had been a good boy that year, I heard him ask Santa to visit the North Pole to see his workshop.  I chuckled and told Ben that Santa was very busy and it was too late to visit the North Pole  tonight.   I told him we might have time after the Christmas rush.   

The mall Santa turned his head towards mine, and with a perceptible threat in his voice, he said, “but he’s been such a good boy this year.  Maybe I should take him with me for a little while.”  His face was plastered with a creepy grin.  But his eyes pierced into mine and shook me to the core.  They were dead and expressionless and they were staring into my soul.   

“What do you say Ben, do you want to go to the North Pole?” he continued in a monotone voice.

Although he was speaking to Ben, he didn’t break his stare or blink as he said this, and his dead eyes were still locked into mine.  I shuddered and froze for a second.  I've never been so uncomfortable because of the way someone looked at me.    

When I finally snapped back, I told Ben it was time to go because Santa was very busy.  I tugged Ben off Santa’s lap, probably a bit too hard, and I told the teen girl working the photo stand that we didn’t need photos.  I was seriously creeped out by this guy and just wanted to get back to the car and get out of there.

We took the escalator back up and when I took one last look over the railing towards the Santa set up, our eyes locked again.  He had another child on his lap, but he was staring up across the mall right at me.  He grinned his evil grin, and then shifted his gaze towards Ben. He waved and before I could react, Ben was waving back enthusiastically.  This filled me with dread, and the knot in the pit of my stomach tightened.  I instinctually looked away, grabbed Ben, and high tailed it back to the car.  I was a little bit disturbed by the whole situation, and thought about making a complaint to the mall’s management, but I figured that the whole thing was over now.  Besides - the mall Santa didn’t really *do* anything.  Maybe I was overreacting.

Later that night, I put Ben to bed, and still a little jumpy about the whole thing, I took our dog Jasper out for his nightly walk. - There was fresh white snow blanketing the ground and snow dusted evergreen trees lined the edge of our lot where it met the woods.   The scene would have been beautiful, but unfortunately my nerves were shot and I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.  Being far off the road, the only light in the yard came from the lights on either side of the front door.  Darkness shrouded the ends of the property, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that anyone or anything could be just outside the illumination of the meager house lights watching through the darkness.  I’m not sure if it was the cold, or the thought of that mall Santa’s soulless stare, but I was shivering.  

Jasper was sniffing the air and tugging on his leash towards a bed of shrubs.  I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about the mall Santa peering at me through the darkness, but that was just paranoid talk, and I  put it out of mind.  We have all sorts of animals on the property, including a stray cat or two, and Jasper was always sniffing out something to chase.  He had quite the prey drive, and if he caught sight of a squirrel, I’d never get him inside, so I dragged him back in and shut the door to the cold night air. 

Now I wish let Jasper's leash go.

When I got back inside, I wrapped a few presents and tried to unwind by the fire, and with the help of a glass of wine, I managed to doze on the couch.

I don’t know how long I was asleep before I was awakened by Jasper’s barking, but the fire in the fireplace had been reduced to embers.  A chill filled the room.  Jasper was growling and frantically clawing at Ben’s bedroom door.  I let out a primal shriek and screamed for Ben as I ran down the hall and threw open the door.  Ben was sitting up in bed.  He looked safe and sound, but the window was wide open.  The wind howled, and the curtains billowed in the freezing air.  I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw he was okay.

“Ben it’s freezing in here, why would you open a window are you crazy?”

I walked over and slammed the window shut.

“It wasn’t me Mom, it was Santa.  He came to take me to the North Pole, but Jasper scared him away.”

My heart jumped and the knot in my stomach was back.

Looking around the room, I saw the red, fur lined Santa hat crumpled at the foot of the bed.  In horror, I glanced out the window.   illuminated by the moon was a large set of boot tracks tracing across the lawn into the darkness beyond the [tree line](https://twitter.com/_Haunted_Home).
