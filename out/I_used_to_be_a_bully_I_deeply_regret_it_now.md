This is not your average redemption story. I was a terrible person before, but I’ve been saved, all thanks to God and my boyfriend. I regret it all now, very deeply, and I’ve seen the light, the true light. 

I used to be a terrible person, especially in high school. I know it doesn’t excuse it, but I was going through a lot of trauma and shit, and I didn’t know how to cope with it except to take it out on others. I was a shitty guy. 

Growing up, I lived in a very religious household. My mom was the stereotypical trad-wife that knew how to cut you down to pieces just like carrots for a stew. My father was a pastor at our local church and made sure to instill the teachings of damnation and punishment in me in order to make me the perfect man and servant to God. 

As you can tell, this wasn’t the ideal environment to realize you were gay in. By the time I realized I liked other men, I already had a deep, seething hatred for the sinners of the gay community. It was an abomination in my father’s eyes, and like any brainwashed servant, I believed what he believed without question. So, when I started feeling these feelings, I started to hate myself deeply. 

High school was when these feelings of hatred started to externally manifest. I joined the soccer team, got a “hot” blonde girlfriend, started getting into shape, and volunteered at Bible camp. I was a model young man in the eyes of many, but not myself, and certainly not my father. 

I’d eye my teammates in the locker room after games, watching their sweaty bodies as they changed into what I thought were the sexiest blue jeans. I’d then get home, get off in the shower, then kneel by my bed with my Bible and pray through tears for salvation. It was a vicious cycle, one that started to take its toll on me. 

My grades started to slip the more I started to hate myself. I didn’t care for school anymore. My girlfriend broke up with me, and I hooked up with her sister as revenge, hating every second of it. When my parents found out about my performance in school, my father beat me in between prayers of his own. 

I don’t blame Christianity for this, in fact I don’t even hate Christians as a person of faith myself. I know my father was just sick in the head. It didn’t matter though. I started to hate god just as much as myself. Luckily, though, someone would come along and give me an outlet for my frustrations. 

Michael transferred to my high school our senior year. He was the definition of a nerd—shy, introverted and quiet, small and fragile like a house of cards. Sensitive, too. I swear, I once caught him crying in English class after we read Frankenstein. I probably would have too if I had actually read it like we were supposed to, but I still ruthlessly made fun of him for it to his face. 

The worst part about Michael, however, was that he was openly gay. 

I hated him for it, hated him until I envisioned him dancing naked with the devil in the woods, conjuring ancient magic and sodomizing himself. His wet dream, my worst nightmare. I tried to make his life hell for it, as some sort of sick payback. I shoved him in the halls, threw things at the back of his head in class, stalked his social media pages and sent demeaning and crude messages to him. I could see the toll it took on Michael, and it made me feel better. I didn’t have to be the only one who suffered for this. Maybe I could save him this way, the same way my father was trying to. I was so, so blind back then. 

After graduation, I didn’t see Michael again. I moved to another state, cut contact with my family, and vowed to start anew. It wouldn’t be my last rebirth, looking back at it, but it felt like the only one I had to go through, because life got pretty great. I went to a state college and started therapy, even though I initially hated every second of it. I knew I needed to unpack the hell I went through growing up, but I never mentioned Michael. Honestly, he was a faded memory at that point. 

Once out of college, I accepted myself and came out as gay, got a nice paying job, and started to really live life. I moved in with a friend who was pretty chill, and I honestly started thinking that this place was home. It wasn’t, but I believed it was. Life wasn’t amazing, but it was mine. 

Life would turn upside down again. I thought I regretted my past, but I wouldn’t know regret until that night everything changed. 

Two years ago I went to a gay club. It wasn’t the first time I had gone—in fact, I was something of a well-paying regular. I hooked up with plenty of guys, yeah, but that wasn’t the only reason I went. I lived for the pulsing of the beats, the vibrant flashing lights, the strongly poured drinks. I was a hedonist, but I didn’t care. 

One night, I could feel something different in the air of my beloved club. I made my way to the dance floor, expecting to just dance the night away and live in the moment. Instead, at the center of it all, I found an Adonis. 

He was dancing sensually, arms above his head, his shirt riding up to expose his midriff, though that wasn’t the only exposed part of him. His shirt was a white, mesh tank top, and his pants were tight leather, which must’ve been uncomfortable to dance in, but that thought never crossed my mind. I don’t think any coherent thoughts were in my head in that moment. He was tall and lean, messy blond hair thrashing wildly with his movements. 

I moved closer, almost as if in a trance. Two more steps, and piercing blue eyes turned to me, shooting through me. In that moment, I was hooked. I pushed through the crowd of sweaty bodies that normally would’ve attracted me, locked onto my target like a predator hunting for prey. I should’ve known it was the reverse. 

The next few moments were a blur. I approached the dancing figure, and once I was at a respectable but closer distance, I began to dance in tandem with him. He grinned, motioning me closer. I obeyed. Soon, we were grinding against each other, and he was whispering in my ear. I don’t remember what he said exactly, but I do remember nodding dumbly and following him as he led me through the club like a shepherd. Then we were back at his place, in his bedroom that smelled like incense, him on top of me. 

And then I was cuffed to the bed. 

“Uh…” I had started, testing my restraints. “This is a little…” 

It’s not that I hadn’t done anything freaky before, it was just so sudden. 

“Much?” He teased. “Don’t be a coward, James.” 

I gulped. “What did you say your name was?” 

He grinned. “Mikey. You really don’t remember me, babe?” When I shook my head, he laughed, a genuine, deep belly laugh, and tossed his head back. “Come on, don’t tell me you could really forget poor little Michael. You made my life hell, babe.”

My stomach dropped. In the moment, I’m sure my jaw did too. Fuck. 

Suddenly, I was struggling against my restraints again, babbling nonsense. “I—fuck—um. Look, this is a mistake, I’m sorry, just, um, let me go and—“ 

He put his hand over my mouth. “It’s okay, you’re okay. I’m not gonna hurt you—I’m gonna save you.”

“What the fuck are you on about?” I said. “Look, I’ve changed, and I’m sorry. Let’s just put this night behind us.” 

Michael laughed once again. He finds me so funny. 

“You’re adorable. Like I said, it’s all okay.” He got off of me, rounding the bed to the dresser on the other side. It was littered with various trinkets I now recognized as occult-like materials such as candles, incense, cards, and, most terrifying of all, a long, sharp dagger. He plucked a vial filled with red powder from a tray, alongside a candle and the dagger. 

“Please…” I whispered. 

“See, I knew you’d come around! Don’t worry, I’ll be with you in a moment.” 

He slowly walked back to the bed, making eye contact with me the whole time. Suddenly, Michael’s face grew serious as he climbed back onto the bed. 

“Just hold still for me, please. You’ll be okay soon.” 

I struggled, he slapped me. “Listen to me! I don’t want to hurt you, my love.” 

Michael popped open the vial, once again focused on this plan I couldn’t fathom. I was beyond scared, I could barely understand what I was feeling. He poured the red powder in a pattern on my abdomen, tongue poking out in concentration like some sort of school girl. As he finished, he dropped the vial and moved the hand holding the candle over the pattern. He tipped the candle over, and hit wax poured onto the center of my stomach.

I remember screaming even though it hadn’t hurt that much. Michael just sighed like an owner would at a misbehaving pet. The wax hardened on my skin like a second layer of flesh. 

“I lied,” Michael said, as if he was confessing a deep sin. “This next part has to hurt, but after that I swear to you that you’ll have a painless, blissful life.” 

Horrified, I watched as Michael raised the dagger up above his head. I became paralyzed in fear, almost not believing that this was happening to me. Surely, I had to have been dreaming. Any moment I would wake up. Michael was whispering in some foreign tongue, his words incomprehensible as he looked me in the eyes. He gave a small, pitiful smile, then wrenched back. I screwed my eyes tight.

I heard it before I felt it, the sick sound of flesh being pierced and the dagger meeting resistance, but pushing forward anyways. Then, my abdomen exploded in burning pain. It felt like a fire had been lit inside my stomach. 

Michael twisted the dagger, and I yelped. Hot tears poured down my cheeks, and he paused, the whispering chant coming to an end as he gazed down at me. Slowly, he leaned down, pushing his body weight against the dagger and driving it deeper into me, leaning and leaning until his face met mine. He kissed my cheek, softly, as if he wasn’t killing me at that moment but rather putting me to bed. His tongue poked out and he ran it up my cheek, lapping up my tears as they continued to pour. He twisted the dagger again. My eyes rolled into my skull as my vision started to darken. 

Just as I felt myself starting to lose consciousness, Michael wrenched the dagger out of me, leaning back up. I screamed, and he wrapped his hand around my mouth, not even looking at my face—but rather, the gaping hole in my stomach. His other hand danced around the wound, fingers skimming against the edges, pale, delicate skin becoming sullied by my blood. 

Looking up at me, Michael ran the dagger against his own hand, slicing a neat cut into the sensitive flesh there. His next words shook me to my core. 

“Tell me—promise me forever,” Michael strained. “Promise me.” 

Whether it was the blood loss or the compelling look in his eyes, I did. My voice croaked out as I whispered back to him my promise of forever, and he smiled. He took a deep breath in, then pressed his bleeding hand against my wound. It hurt, badly, but in an almost satisfying way. I felt vibrations wrack through his hand and into my body, like a shockwave wreaking havoc through the two of us. As I shut my eyes, I saw him, truly. My God. Not the Abrahamic god, but the real one. I saw him in the curve of Michael’s lips, the light in his eyes, and the translucent nature of his skin. They were one in the same, and in that moment I knew…

I knew he was my savior. 

Now, I write this as I kneel at his feet, his hand in my hair, nails dancing across my scalp. He reads aloud to me, even though he knows I don’t really understand literature anymore. Michael has given me permission to tell my story on one condition; I remind you all that true salvation is out there. You just have to find it in the right person, the person who has the knowledge of worlds and existences beyond your imagination. For me, that person is my beloved boyfriend, the love of my life, my savior, my deliverer of God. 

Thank you, Michael, and thank you for reading. Soon enough, you’ll find God, and he or she or they will be waiting for you with open hands.
