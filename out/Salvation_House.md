I left while Dad was still at work. I didn’t leave a note, or any indication as to where I’d gone. I didn’t tell anyone where I was going in case he asked around.

&#x200B;

I didn’t want him to find me. I didn’t want to hear his voice or see his face ever again. I knew that if I did, I’d be dead. Even if he cried and begged for me to come home the way he used to do every time Mom tried to leave him, I’d still end up dead just like she did. She’d never been able to escape him. But I would.

&#x200B;

My Dad was always an angry man, but I don’t think I ever realized just how bad it was until after my mother died. After she was gone… there was nothing stopping him from letting his rage out on me. I made the same excuses that she used to make at first.

&#x200B;

*‘He’s under a lot of stress.’*

&#x200B;

*‘It’s my fault, I shouldn’t have provoked him.’*

&#x200B;

*‘He does it because he cares.’*

&#x200B;

I did what I could not to provoke him. I tried to be a good daughter! After Mom died, I tried to pick up where she had left off.

&#x200B;

But it wasn’t enough.

&#x200B;

Some nights, he’d come home after work full of rage and lust and rum. On those nights, I could do nothing but wait for it to be over as his fists struck me and his hands tore at my clothes. He threw me on the floor, dragged me by the hair around the apartment. He did things to me… things I can’t let myself remember. On those nights, the torture would go on for hours, but I persevered to the best of my ability. My attempts to endure and my refusal to break or beg must have angered him further, or maybe he just took it as a challenge. Sooner or later, I couldn’t hold on anymore.

&#x200B;

After he put me in the hospital, I couldn’t hide behind those hollow excuses any longer. *After I had to teach my broken body to walk again,* I couldn’t do it anymore. I was 19! I was his *child!* He was supposed to take care of me, he was supposed to be my parent, not the other way around! I was the one working two jobs and paying the bills while he drank away his paycheque! I was the one keeping a roof over our heads! I was the one keeping the power on!

&#x200B;

And he was going to kill me… he was going to get angry, and he was going to hit me, just like he hit Mom and bit by bit, he’d destroy me. Ripping me apart at the seams until one day, he either went too far or I just couldn’t take it anymore.

&#x200B;

God… I wish the police had arrested him. I wish they’d taken him in after she died. But, it wasn’t his rage that killed her. Not directly, at least. No, the sleeping pills did that.

&#x200B;

I think that was the closest thing to an escape she could bring herself to do… and honestly, I don’t blame her.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t live another day in that hell. I couldn’t.

&#x200B;

It was killing me.

&#x200B;

*He* was killing me.

&#x200B;

I knew that even if I survived the next day, or the day after, sooner or later, he would go too far. It could not continue.

&#x200B;

It would not continue.

&#x200B;

So I left, hoping that maybe I’d find something better once I did.

&#x200B;

I’d heard about Salvation House from one of the nurses at the hospital. She’d taken one look at me after the ambulance dropped me off and known what had happened. It had taken a few weeks for me to actually listen to her… but eventually, she got me talking about my life at home. She told me there were resources out there to help me. She even gave me some pamphlets to look through.

&#x200B;

Salvation House was the one that seemed to be the most popular. The nurse said she hadn’t heard much about it but when I looked it up online, it seemed nice. They offered resources to help you get back on your feet, help finding a job, and even counseling! It seemed like the perfect place to help me get away from my Dad for good… and once the idea was in my head, it didn’t take long before I started planning out how I’d leave.

&#x200B;

I quit my jobs the night before I left so my Dad couldn’t use them to find me and on the day I left, I felt free for the first time in my life. I left while he was at work. I packed only the things I knew I’d need, and I left. I locked the door behind me and with every step I took away from that house I felt pieces of the weight I’d silently carried around falling off of me.

&#x200B;

I was leaving!

&#x200B;

I was going to be free!

&#x200B;

I was going to start over!

&#x200B;

I was never going to see him again!

&#x200B;

My heart was racing as I made my way further from the house. I kept expecting to hear my Dad chasing after me. I kept expecting him to somehow know that I was leaving. But he didn’t. No one saw me leave. No one knew I’d left. No one stopped me. And when I finally made my way to Salvation House, the fears that I’d been holding on to had mostly been left behind and I walked through those doors feeling hopeful for the first time in my life.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

“You can have this room for the time being, alright hun? I know it’s not a heck of a lot, but it’ll at least be somewhere to rest while you get everything in order.”

&#x200B;

The worker at the shelter had a soft, kind voice with a slight southern twang to it. Her name tag read Julia, and she’d been right there to meet me when I came in. The room I’d been taken to was small and plain. There were four beds in there. It sort of reminded me of a hospital room, only slightly less sterile. The only decoration on the plain white walls was a single crucifix between the beds. Still, this may as well have been a palace. It was everything I needed. I almost found myself crying.

&#x200B;

“Yeah… yeah, this is good…” I said quietly.

“I’ll confirm your appointment with Cheryl tomorrow morning and you can talk about some kind of work placement, as well as next steps. Alright?” Julia asked. “For tonight though, you ought to just get settled in. Just relax and take a breather.”

“Thank you,” I said and she patted me gently on the shoulder, offering me a warm, almost comforting smile.

“Course, hun. God bless.”

&#x200B;

She’d left me there and I’d gently set down my bag near the bed in the far corner in the room. As far as I could tell, the other three beds were unoccupied so I had the room to myself. I laid down on the bed, before quietly taking out my phone. There were two missed calls on the screen, both from my Dad. I ignored them and blocked his number before turning my phone off completely. I wasn’t sure if he could use it to find me, but I didn’t want to take the risk.

&#x200B;

I sank down on the bed. It was hard and not very comfortable, but I didn’t care. I was out. I was never going to see my Dad again. *He was never going to hurt me again*. As I lay in bed, I let myself fantasize about my future. I knew it wouldn’t be easy… but it would be mine. Whatever it would be, it would be mine. That thought alone made me giddy.

&#x200B;

I didn’t sleep much that night, but I was content and whatever the next day brought, I would greet it with open arms.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Sure enough, the next morning I met with Cheryl. She was a middle aged woman with long blonde hair and a thousand watt smile that sometimes looked a little forced. She wore aviator style glasses that sort of looked like they’d be more at home on an old man in the 1970s than on her, but she pulled off the look alright. We spent about an hour going over why I’d left home and discussing my next steps. She recommended a therapist they had on staff who I could speak with and set up an appointment with me, free of charge. Then we moved on to talking about how to get me back on my feet. We went over my work history, and she helped me with my resume to make it easier for me to find a job. She told me that in the meanwhile, if I wasn’t picky I could help out with some of the Salvation House’s other initiatives.

&#x200B;

“We’ve got a few other programs in the community,” She’d said. “Some of them are volunteer positions, like the soup kitchen and the homeless shelter but a couple of them do pay. Landscaping pays if you’d be up for it. It’s hard work, but it’s for a good cause!”

“Whatever you can get for me, I’d just be happy to have,” I said. “I might not be so good at landscaping, it’s still a bit difficult for me to stand too long or to walk too far, but I’ll take anything else!”

&#x200B;

Cheryl seemed to think for a moment.

“Well, right now, the homeless shelter needs people,” She said. “It can be difficult work, but it’s also very rewarding. I volunteer there myself, sometimes.”

“I wouldn’t mind giving it a shot,” I said. “It sounds like it’s for a good cause!”

“Oh I assure you, it is! I’ll reach out to Ash then to let him know you’re interested, and I’ll get back to you with a start date!”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, that sounds great!” I said.

“Perfect, I’ll pop by your room this evening… oh, and I almost forgot! We don’t have a lot of people here at the moment, but we like to encourage a sense of community. I know  some of the other girls usually get together in the common room every evening just to socialize, watch TV, play some board games. I don’t know if Julia showed you where it was, but I can if you’d like!”

“Yeah, I’d like that a lot!” I said.

&#x200B;

Cheryl smiled before getting up to show me to the common room, followed by a brief tour of the facility.

“I always heard shelters like this were hard to get into,” I said as she showed me around.

“Some are, but we try and keep ourselves available,” Cheryl replied. “There’s a lot of women out there we can help, and it’s our God given mission to help them.”

&#x200B;

She paused for a moment, before looking over at me, her stare a little more intense than usual.

“Do you believe in God, Christina?”

“Oh… um… I don’t really know,” I admitted. “I guess I do. I don’t really think about it much.”

“You should,” She said. “Personally, I find some peace in the knowledge that God has a plan for each of us.”

&#x200B;

She smiled at me, and I meekly smiled back at her.

“That does sound kind of peaceful,” I said.

“Doesn’t it?” She seemed like she was about to say something else when her phone buzzed. She looked down at it, her smile briefly fading.

“Excuse me,” She said softly. “I need to take this. Feel free to explore to your hearts content, though! I’ll talk to you later!”

&#x200B;

And just like that she was gone.

&#x200B;

I did explore the facility a little more without her, but there wasn’t much to see. Some quiet, mostly empty rooms. One of them had a TV, books, and board games that looked like they hadn’t been touched in ages, and that was really it. It did occur to me that this place seemed a little too quiet. In fact, aside from Cheryl and Julia I hadn’t seen anyone else since I’d arrived. Even when I’d had breakfast earlier, the dining room had been empty save for me. It was odd… but maybe that was normal? Either way, I didn’t really want to look my gift horse in the mouth.

&#x200B;

When I was done with my tour, I took some books from the common room and went back to my room, and that was how I passed my afternoon until dinner.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Cheryl dropped me off at the homeless shelter the next morning. It was a fairly unremarkable looking brick building with no real distinctive features. A sign reading: SALVATION COMMUNITY HOUSE was displayed out front, but other than that the outside of the building was something of a blank slate. So was the inside, actually. The walls were a pale off yellow color that matched the floor and the ceiling. The rooms were somewhat bare, with people sleeping on old mats on the floor, and yet this place felt as sterile as the shelter I’d come from.

&#x200B;

“It’s a shame, isn’t it?” Cheryl asked when she noticed me staring into some of the rooms that we passed. My eyes lingered on a dark haired woman with roman features, wearing a red beanie who was asleep on one of the mats, before returning to Cheryl.

“We do what we can with the funding we’ve got, but it’s not really enough to help these people half as much as we’d like to. It’s… difficult, being here sometimes. It’s why we’re hurting so badly for volunteers like you.”

“Yeah… I can see why…” I said quietly.

&#x200B;

She led me into the back, where there was a large kitchen that was thankfully just as sterile as everything else. The walls were bare, save for a small crucifix and one motivational poster by the door.

&#x200B;

***Without God one week would be***

***Sinday***

&#x200B;

***Mournday***

***Tearsday***

***Wasteday***

***Thirstday***

***Fightday***

***Shatterday***

***Seven Days without God makes one weak!***

&#x200B;

Subtle.

&#x200B;

Among the small handful of workers in the kitchen, one of them turned to look at us. He was a tall, clean cut man with handsome rounded features, a friendly smile and wavy brown hair.

“You must be Christina!” He said, offering me a hand to shake. “Ash Babineau. Pleased to meet you!”

“Likewise,” I said quietly.

“Ash is good people,” Cheryl said. “He’s actually with the local police, and he’s a huge help around here.”

“Hey, a lotta people just need a hand,” Ash said, “And thank the good Lord that I’ve got two!”

&#x200B;

He laughed at his own joke, before gesturing for me to follow him. I took one parting look at Cheryl, before doing so.

“Cheryl tells me you’ve got some cooking experience, honestly we could use that!” He said. “The people here deserve a *proper* meal, and I’ve never really been much of a cook!”

“I’ll do my best!” I promised him.

&#x200B;

And that’s exactly what I did.

&#x200B;

Working at the shelter wasn’t actually that bad.  I was always a decent cook, and making food for these people who had it far worse than I did was… well… it was sort of fulfilling. I got to talk to some of them, listen to their stories, learn about their lives and how they’d ended up on the street. When I wasn’t in the kitchen, I was helping with various other things around the shelter, setting out cots for people to sleep in, helping distribute medicine to the more sickly residents.

&#x200B;

Most of the time, I was working fairly closely with Ash, which was actually kind of nice. He was good with the residents, always taking the time to try and make sure they were comfortable. He took some of them to a local doctors office, and paid for it out of pocket, he brought in prescriptions and other special requests they made, even if it was just for small things like candy bars or a snack. Something to make their lives a little less miserable.

&#x200B;

I’d never seen someone behave so kindly before, and it was a little inspiring. I’d never put too much thought into the person I’d wanted to be before. For most of my life, I’d just sort of existed, trying not get through each day without a beating. But now that my Dad was slowly fading into a bad memory, I could finally start thinking about my future!

&#x200B;

My future… I’d never thought I’d be so lucky to have a future before.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

“You heading out, Christina?” Ask asked me.

&#x200B;

It’d been about two weeks since I’d started volunteering at the homeless shelter, and I was just cleaning up the kitchen at the end of my shift.

“Yeah, I was just about to head to the bus stop,” I said.

“No need, I’ll drive you.” He replied.

“Are you sure? I wouldn’t want to-”

“Trust me, it’s on the way,” He said. “You want some water?”

I noticed him heading for the fridge and nodded.

“Yes please.”

&#x200B;

He grabbed two bottles, opened one of them and handed it over to me with a smile.

“There you go. I’m parked out back. C’mon.”

He grabbed his coat out of the back room, and gestured for me to follow him. He led me through the back door and out into the parking lot. His car was the only one parked there. It was an expensive looking Audi sedan. He unlocked the doors and we got in.

&#x200B;

“Thanks for this,” I said, taking a sip of the water. It tasted a little off, but it was refreshing.

“No problem,” He assured me as he keyed the engine, “How’s the job hunt going?”

“It’s going. Cheryl’s been helping me apply to places,” I said. “But I’ve been reaching out to any place that’s hiring in the meanwhile. And once I’ve got a job, I can start looking for a place to live!”

“Hey, baby steps.” He said as we left the parking lot behind. “You should be proud of yourself. Not a lotta kids out there have your drive.”

“Um, thanks…” I said, and took another sip of my water.

“I mean it. You’re a good girl, Christina. You’re gonna make somebody a damn fine wife someday.”

&#x200B;

I almost laughed.

“Maybe,” I said.

“You don’t think so?”

“I’m not really sure how I feel about ever getting married right now after seeing how things worked out for my parents. Besides, I want to try and focus on myself for a bit first.”

“I get that, but you really should still consider it. It’s better for a woman to be married young, while she’s still in her prime. I always thought it was essential to the bedrock of a proper family.”

&#x200B;

I… genuinely did not have an answer for that. I’d thought we’d been in the middle of a normal conversation and he’d just sort of come at me with *that* out of left field. I stared at him for a moment, not really sure how to respond to what he’d just said, although really I didn’t have to say anything at all.

&#x200B;

“Sorry,” He said with a slightly sheepish smile. “Guess I’ve got a stronger opinion than most on this sort of thing.”

“Yeah… I guess you do…” I said quietly, still not entirely sure how to respond. I was starting to get a slight headache and I wasn’t sure if I was just tired or if it was something else. I felt a little… floaty. Maybe I was coming down with something?

“To be fair, a lot of my colleagues feel pretty strongly about this too. Actually… it’s something of a side project of ours, helping young women like you find their way into a fulfilling relationship with a good man.”

“What?” I asked, looking over at him, confused and feeling worse by the second.

&#x200B;

“Families are the bedrock of society,” Ash said. “People function at their best when they’re in a solid family role. When families come apart… so does society. And make no mistake, Christina. Society is coming apart. I mean, you can see it every day at the shelter… those people, cast out, lost, forced to fend for themselves. A lot of my colleagues aren’t interested in helping them. Hell… some of the Grandmasters would rather we just kill them. Remove them from society outright. My colleagues just want to fix things and put things back the way they need to be because it’s God’s will… and I respect that! I do! But I don’t just do what I do because it’s God’s will. I do what I do because  I want to do it, because I truly want to fix things. I want to make things better!”

“What the… what the hell are you…”

&#x200B;

My words were slurred. I found myself struggling to keep my eyes open. I looked down at the water bottle, then back at Ash.

“What did you do to me…?”

&#x200B;

He just smiled at me.

“I’m going to help you, Christina,” He said. “You’re someone who’s worth saving. I’ve seen it firsthand now. Some of the girls we’ve saved… I don’t think they were worth it. But you are.”

He reached out, putting a hand over mine.

“I’m going to save you, Christina. I promise”

The last thing I remember seeing was Ash’s smiling face… and then everything went black.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

When I woke up, I was in a brightly lit room, laying on some kind of cot.

&#x200B;

I flinched and blinked, trying to adjust to the blinding light around me. I could hear whispered voices nearby but I wasn’t sure if any of them were talking to me. I rolled onto my side, covering my eyes and trying to look at the room around me. The room somewhat resembled one of the rooms we had at the homeless shelter… although this one was a little nicer. There were several cots, and somewhere between 6 to 8 other women in the room with me. All of them were around my age dressed in white scrubs. Some of them were talking amongst each other, but none of them seemed to pay me much mine. Where the hell was I? Slowly I sat up, only to hear a whispered voice beside me.

&#x200B;

“Hey… take it slow,”

I looked over to see a woman sitting beside me. She looked to be a few years older than me and had dark hair with roman features. She seemed vaguely familiar although I couldn’t quite recall where I’d seen her before.

“What’s going on…?” I murmured.

“Cheryl dropped you off a couple of hours ago. I don’t know where you came from but… well… you’re here now.”

“Here…?” I asked, “Cheryl…?”

&#x200B;

Now I just had more questions. Why had Cheryl brought me here? The woman beside me offered a sympathetic smile.

“Yeah… I’m not really sure how to give you a satisfying answer to any of this,” She admitted. “Truth be told, I’m not even entirely sure where *here* is. But I’m guessing it’s under one of the buildings Salvation House owns.”

“Salvation House…?”

“You came here through them, didn’t you?” She asked. “They picked me up from the homeless shelter. I lost my job, couldn’t afford my apartment and ended up out on the street. Someone said that Salvation House would help me. Instead I ended up here.”

&#x200B;

The shelter… suddenly it clicked. I *did* recognize her! I’d seen her staying at the shelter up until about a week ago, although we hadn’t really interacted at all.

“Yeah, Cheryl said they had a ‘*program*’ that could help me get back on my feet. When I signed up, I didn’t really think *this* was what they had in mind.”

&#x200B;

Somewhere over the chatter, I heard a woman screaming in another room and bolted up, my mind suddenly a little less hazy. The woman beside me pursed her lips, before patting me on the back.

“It’s alright…” She said.

“What the hell is this place?” I asked.

“Some kind of re-education camp,” She replied.

“Re-education camp?!” I asked, looking over at her. “You’re not serious…”

&#x200B;

I heard another scream, and the woman beside me just offered me a somber smile. The conversation I’d been having with Ash before I’d passed out came rushing back to me. He’d mentioned some kind of ‘side-project’, then he’d said something about saving me while talking about how families were the bedrock of society or something.

&#x200B;

“Cheryl says we’re here to become the ‘ideal mates’, to form the new bedrock of society or something.” The woman beside me said, “From what I’ve seen over the past few days, girls come in, they go through the program, they *graduate* and then they leave.”

“What the fuck…” I said, “H-how do we get out of here? I need to get out of here…”

&#x200B;

I tried to get off the cot, but my legs weren’t working just yet. The woman beside me caught me, stopping me from falling.

“Hey, hey, hey. Remember what I said about taking it slow?” She asked.

“How do I get out of here?” I asked again.

“Well there’s two ways,” She said. “You either graduate…”

&#x200B;

Another scream echoed from the next room. My new friend flinched a little.

“Or you don’t.”

“W-what?” I looked her in the eye, a mounting dread in my chest rearing as I realized what she was talking about.

“Truth be told, I’m not sure there’s much of a difference between the two…” My new friend said. “The girls I’ve seen leaving… they’re not really themselves anymore. After all the drugs and the surgery… it’s like someone scooped them out, and didn’t put anything back in. Dunno if I’d call that living or not.”

“A-and is that going to happen to us?” I asked.

&#x200B;

My new friend nodded.

“Far as I can tell…” She said softly.

There was a loud buzzing noise by a locked metal door on one side of the room, and the door opened. A burly looking man in a black T-shirt stepped inside, holding a police baton and I could see more men just like him outside.

&#x200B;

“Alright, try to stand,” My new friend said. “Looks like you’re just in time for dinner. Just stay close to me, alright? The guards tend to freak out if you break formation.”

&#x200B;

She let me hold on to her and walk the first few steps with her, as we got into line along with the other women in the room. Once we were all lined up, the guards led us out. We were led down a short hall toward a small dining room, where several plates of food had been set out on paper plates, with plastic cutlery.

&#x200B;

The food looked like frozen vegetables and a slab of meat, with a modest amount of gravy. My new friend helped me into one of the seats, and I looked down at the food, before reaching for one of the forks. She reached out a hand to stop me before I could take a bite.

“Chew. Don’t swallow,” She whispered.

“Why not?” I asked.

“Just trust me.”

&#x200B;

I looked down at the food, before cutting into the meat. It looked and smelled like turkey, although the taste of it was a little strong. It reminded me a little bit of the odd taste I’d noticed in the water that Ash had given me. It was mostly in the gravy. I chewed it, but didn’t swallow, just like my new friend suggested. I watched her do the same, and while the guards were busy talking, she discreetly spit out the food into her napkin while wiping her face. I copied her, before quietly pushing the gravy off of my turkey like I’d seen some of the other girls do.

“So… what’s your name anyways?” My new friend asked me.

“I’m Christina.”

“Well Christina, I’m Karly.” She offered me a hand to shake, and I gingerly shook it, before trying the turkey again. The taste was still there, so I spit it out.

&#x200B;

“Yeah… whatever they put in the food an the water, it keeps your head all fogged up,” Karly said quietly. “You should see some of the girls in the other rooms… I don’t even think they know where they are anymore.”

There were other rooms?

My heart sank a little bit. How big was this operation?

“If you can’t eat the food they give you, what do you eat then?” I asked.

“We don’t,” Karly said quietly. “Don’t drink the water either. The stuff they give you isn’t safe. The stuff in the toilet is though.”

&#x200B;

The toilet?!

&#x200B;

“Yeah… it’s not glamorous but it makes do,” Karly said. “But we just need to stick with it for a little longer. Any day now, we’re making our move.”

“Shh…” One of the other girls said, shooting Karly a death glare.

&#x200B;

She smiled sheepishly, before making a zipping motion over her lips before changing the subject. She went around the table as we pretended to eat, introducing me to the other girls. Rebecca, Sadie, Penelope, Daniella, Carly with a C and Paula. I can’t say I got a chance to know any of them that well though. I almost regret to admit that over dinner, they didn’t become much more to be than half remembered names and familiar faces.

&#x200B;

After a dinner that was mostly chewed into a pulp and folded into my napkin, we were escorted back to our room. I mostly stayed with Karly the whole time, if for no other reason than because I felt a little bit safer with her. We didn’t really talk much again until we were back in our rooms, but when we were I felt obligated to pick up our conversation from earlier.

“You said something about making a move,” I said as she settled down on a cot beside mine. “What did you mean by that?”

&#x200B;

She glanced over toward the door, before moving to sit beside me on my cot.

“It was Daniella’s idea.” She said quietly, “Usually there’s only a couple of guards around when they take us out for meals. One comes in, the rest stay out. But she was thinking… with all the drugs they give us, they probably don’t expect us to be that sharp. And if we were to rush the guy who came in… well. They all carry a gun. If we could get our hands on his, then we’d have a hostage. These people are fucking animals… you heard that girl in the other room getting her head cut open. But I don’t think they’d let one of their own die.”

“And if they would?” I asked gravely.

&#x200B;

“Then we start shooting and we start running,” Karly replied. “Look, the way I see it, we’re coming out ahead either way. We either get out, or we die on our own terms… if you ask me, that’s better than whatever they’re going to do to us.”

“You’re sure?” I asked.

“If you’re not, then you will be soon,” Karly said, before returning to her cot. “I know you just got here, but you’ve got to be able to see just how fucked this situation is! Hell… I’ve only been here a few days, and I know that I’m not going to be here for much longer. Now that you’re here, this room is full. They’re going to take us, and it’s going to happen soon. After that, there isn’t going to *be* any chance at escape.”

&#x200B;

She lay down to rest, but I couldn’t sleep a wink. I just lay on my cot, thinking about my future.

&#x200B;

Through the evening, I heard the distant screams of women. Voices crying out, pleading for mercy.

*“N-no! Don’t do this, please! I… I’ll be good! I’ll do what you want! Please, please NO!!!”*

&#x200B;

I heard one girl crying for her Mom to come and save her. I heard her sobbing in terror before she too went silent.

&#x200B;

The voices changed every thirty minutes or so, and carried on until shortly before the lights went out. Although the silence that replaced them wasn’t much better. I still heard their screams in my head.

&#x200B;

I lay in my cot, trying to make sense of the hell I’d been sent to… the hell Ash and Cheryl had sent me to, with the promise of *saving me.*

Saving me from what? A life where I could choose my own future? I doubted that either Ash or Cheryl would’ve understood or cared about the irony in their actions. I’d come to them looking to escape a man who’d hurt me, who’d broken me in every sense of the word. And here they were, promising to send whatever would be left of me when they were done to another man, one who might not be any better than my Dad had been. And even if they were… it wouldn’t be *me* they’d be sending.

&#x200B;

I didn’t know what they’d been doing to the girls in the other room… but I doubted what Karly had said about them was exaggerated. I thought about the plan she’d shared with me… a plan I admittedly didn’t have a lot of faith in. The idea of possibly dying terrified me, even if it would be ‘*on my own terms*’ as she put it. I just wasn’t sure if death scared me more than the fate this place promised to me. And in the end… would it even matter what I chose? The guards might just kill me for being in the same room as them. I had no idea how ruthless they were.

I might be dead either way.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The next few days passed in somber monotony. We were let out two times a day for meals we only pretended to eat, and in the evening we listened to the screams of the girls from other rooms.

&#x200B;

On my third day there, I saw Ash and Cheryl in the hall, watching as a girl was pushed out of a room at the end of the hall in a wheelchair. I paused to look at her. She was clearly still alive, although she had a vacant expression on her face. Her eyes seemed to focus on me for a moment, and I could see a single bloody tear running down her cheek. Cheryl stopped her in the hall to wipe it away. Neither she nor Ash seemed to actually notice me. The vacant look in that girls eyes… the lack of any emotion on her face, and the memory of the screams I’d heard a few minutes before lingered in my mind.

&#x200B;

I remembered the way she’d sobbed. She’d been one of the girls who’d begged for her mother and now… nothing. She was alive, yet dead at the same time. I caught Karly staring at me as we sat down to eat, although she didn’t say a word to me. She didn’t need to. They came for us the next evening. The alarm sounded. The door opened and I saw Cheryl walk in, accompanied by one of the guards.

&#x200B;

“Morning girls!” She said, cheerful as ever. “Big day for you today. Today’s the day of your purification! Isn’t that exciting?”

I think it might’ve been Carly with a C who’d responded to her.

“The hell are you going to do to us?” She asked, and Cheryl fixed her in a knowing gaze. She started walking toward Carly’s cot.

“Exactly what we promised,” She said softly. “We’re going to grant you your salvation. Purify you, in the eyes of God and in the eyes of Society. Remove the sin from the sinner, as it were…”

&#x200B;

She put a hand on Carly’s shoulder, before giving a nod toward the guards behind her.

“Wait… WAIT, WAIT WAIT!” Carly cried, although she couldn’t put up much of a fight. Two men dragged her away, and the rest of us could do nothing but watch.

&#x200B;

She screamed all the way down the hall, first in rage, then in terror. Those screams were enough to curdle my blood.

&#x200B;

Carly didn’t last any longer than any other girl, but the ten minutes where she screamed felt almost like ten hours.

&#x200B;

There was a grave look on the face of every other girl in the room, and I understood its meaning. The moment had come, as we knew it would.

&#x200B;

When Carly went silent, we waited. I closed my eyes, but I didn’t have it in me to hope that I’d survive. I just hoped that dying wouldn’t hurt. After a while, the alarm on the door sounded again. A single guard came in, and looked around quietly. His eyes settled on me.

“You’re up next,” He said gruffly, “Come on.”

&#x200B;

Slowly I rose to my feet, although my legs were trembling so badly  I could barely even walk. My breathing grew heavier as panic set in and the guard glared at me before losing his patience and storming toward me. He grabbed me by the arm, and as he did, I saw Karly behind him, with her pillow case gripped tight between her hands as a makeshift garrote.

&#x200B;

It all happened so fast.

&#x200B;

She grabbed him, pulling the pillowcase tight against his throat. The guard tried to scream, but one of the other girls (Daniella, I think) had already gone for his gun.

&#x200B;

Two other guards came in through the door, and Daniella pointed at the guard Karly held hostage.

“STOP!” She snapped, “Take one more step and I’ll blow this asshole's head off, I swear to fucking God!”

Her voice was trembling, but I knew she meant what she said. I suspect the guards did too.

&#x200B;

They took aim at her, and just looking into their eyes, I knew they weren’t going to hesitate. I heard the gunfire, and the only thing I could think to do was dive behind the nearest cot.

&#x200B;

Daniella cried out in pain, and I saw her fall. I could see blood trickling from her head, although she was still alive. She still held the gun though, and gritted her teeth as she took aim at the guards, firing wildly at them. I know she hit them. I know the bullets hurt them. But they didn’t die.

&#x200B;

Of course they didn’t.

&#x200B;

Of course they weren’t going to use real bullets in their weapons… they didn’t want us dead! Why would they waste us!

&#x200B;

No. The guns they carried were only meant to suppress us. Not to kill us.

&#x200B;

I could hear the other girls screaming, although Karly held fast to the guard she’d taken captive. His body had shielded her from their bullets, and I could see her desperately trying to think. Trying to figure a way out of this situation. And in the end the only thing she seemed to be able to think to do was to charge ahead like a bull, she dragged the man she’d captured toward the door, using him as a human shield before hurling him toward his comrades and running out into the hall. I watched her go, before following her.

&#x200B;

I could hear my heart racing in my ears as I burst out of the room. I saw Karly just ahead of me, and turned to follow her, running as fast as my legs would carry me. There was a set of stairs just up ahead, and I saw her going up them.

&#x200B;

I followed her through the doors at the top… and I found myself back in Salvation House. I saw Karly freeze, looking around at the halls, trying to figure out where to run to next and I grabbed her by the wrist.

“This way!” I called, as I led her to the door, and a few moments later, we were free.

&#x200B;

We burst out into the evening air, and found ourselves immediately drenched by the rain. Karly paused, staring wide eyed at the open street, as if she couldn’t believe she’d made it. But our victory was short lived.

“*They’re heading for the door!”* I heard a distant voice call.

&#x200B;

Ash.

&#x200B;

*“Get them back. NOW!”*

&#x200B;

Karly head him too, and I saw her start running again.

“WAIT!” I called, but she didn’t listen. She ran out into the open street. An open street with nowhere to hide. I could hear Ash’s voice getting closer, and my eyes darted toward one of the nearby cars parked on the street.

&#x200B;

Without a second thought, I crawled under it, making it out of sight just as Ash and Cheryl came through the doors. I saw Ash staring in Karly’s direction, and I saw his eyes narrow in rage. I watched him go for the gun on his hip… and I heard him fire one single shot. From the corner of my eye, I could see Karly crashing to the ground in the middle of the street.

&#x200B;

Then there was silence.

&#x200B;

Ash stared at the body, before huffing in frustration and looking over at Cheryl.

“Next time, lock the goddamn doors!” He snapped.

“I’m sorry Mr. Babineau… I didn’t…”

“Don’t be *sorry*! Be *better!* Go find the other one!”

“Y-yes sir…”

Cheryl took off, while Ash took out his phone and went back inside. I knew that he was probably calling the police… and when they came, he could probably tell them whatever he needed to. After all, Karly was just some homeless girl. Nobody was going to miss her.... nobody but me.

&#x200B;

I stayed under the car until I knew that Cheryl was gone, but I knew I couldn’t stay for long. When I knew the coast was clear, I left my hiding place and started running again, listening for the sound of a gunshot, although the sound never came.

&#x200B;

I got away. But I didn’t believe for one second that I was free.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I broke into Dad’s house the next day while he was at work. I knew he kept some money in his bedroom, and there was enough there for me to get a bus ticket out of Chicago.

&#x200B;

I won’t say where I am now, and I can’t confidently say that I’m safe either. But I’m alive, and I’m still me.

&#x200B;

I’ve considered going to the police with what I know… but I have a feeling all that would do is send me right back to Ash and the Salvation House.

&#x200B;

Posting this is really the next best thing that I can think to do, so that’s what I’m doing. After it posts, I’m going to start running again. Maybe someday I’ll finally be safe, and if that day ever comes, I’ll have finally found my [future.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
