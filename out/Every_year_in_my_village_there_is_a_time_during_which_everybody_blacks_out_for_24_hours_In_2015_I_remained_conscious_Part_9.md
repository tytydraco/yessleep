Under the red sky and the numerous pairs of bright eyes, I remained still for a few seconds before I chose to exploit the circumstances and the tension. I threw the bottle high in the air and in their direction, and of course, they froze, watching the container and expecting an occurrence, while I ran back inside the bar. It only took them a few seconds to realize the little trick before officially launching a new chase.

"OUTLANDER!!!" I heard from outside.

Once again, they made those animalistic sounds while pursuing me. I never knew why they made them, and why Edlynn never made those noises. I felt like a prey, hunted to be devoured in a sick ceremony. I found my way back into the wine cellar, hearing them getting close, and about to finally corner me.

"Terrence." I heard, distinctively. It did not come from any direction, instead, it seemed to come from my own head. "Terrence. Can you hear me?" I heard more clearly. The voice, the tone, they did not leave much room for mistakes. It was the voice of Edlynn.

"Edlynn? Edlynn is that you?" I asked.

"Listen very good Terrence, we don't have much time. They close. I need you to do exactly what I'll tell you to do. But before, I want you to remove all the glowing sticks." She requested.

"What? I won't see a thing without these." I said, right when the souls tore down the wine cellar's door.

"Trust me! I won't let you get hurt. They here, you need to move!"

"O— okay!" I responded and obeyed, completely confused and lost, plunging myself in absolute darkness.

"Run!" Edlynn shouted.

I dashed forward, expecting to bump into bottles and hurt myself or into a hostile soul and death itself.

"Turn left!" I obeyed, with no idea of what I was doing and hearing the souls getting closer.

"Turn left!" Again, I obeyed and already, I could no longer see the glowing sticks that I had left behind.

"Outlander? Where are you?" I heard a few meters away from me. I stopped in fear and looked around me but I could not see any vessel, not even their white shining eyes.

Terrence don't stop! Run! Turn right!" I did, even though it started to seem illogical for me to not meet any obstacle from what I remembered to be the layout of that place.

"Turn left!" She said again.

"What's that? What are we doing?" I questioned, almost out of breath.

"Just obey! Turn back! Keep running!" She yelled.

Other bizarre instructions followed: jump forward, crawl forward, walk backwards until the left and right commands were getting so frequent that I started to feel dizzy. The more I obeyed, the less I heard the souls, but at some point, my head was spinning so fast that I crashed on the floor. Yes, I was in a wine cellar, yet I did not plan to get drunk, talk more of doing so without a single sip. I shook my head and widened my eyes while standing up. I was no longer in the wine cellar. I was in a corridor. 

"Edlynn?" I called while looking around me. The two ends of the long corridor were plunged in darkness despite the walls and ceiling slightly glowing in a pale blue. They were decorated with strange representations and symbols, including drawings of Redeye that were scratched up for reasons I was about to know and understand.

"Terrence." She responded calmly.

"What's this place? Where are you? So, you came back?" I asked. She did not respond and that alone was enough to send me back into the pit of guilt I spent hours to climb out from after her death.

"Terrence." She simply called again as I perceived a certain sadness in her voice.

"Edlynn I'm so sorry for what happened with the hybrid." I apologized.

"You fool!" I heard multiple voices say at the same time, and feared in a split second that another hybrid had me at its mercy. Multiple red eyes shone at the end of the corridor I had my eyes on. I turned around to flee, but saw the exact same eyes on the other end and realized that I just fell into a trap. "I, and I alone lured you into this realm." The voices added.

"Edlynn?" I called in despair, refusing to believe that those things had used her voice to trick me.

"You smell just like him." The red-eyed shadows said as they began to approach.

They seemed cloaked with a cloud of darkness transporting them in all their movements, hence plunging the corridor in more darkness as they approached from both ends. I took all the remaining salt bags that I had and threw them at the two shadows with no effect. Those things were no vessels, those things were not Redeye, they were much more terrifying beings. I was convinced to be a witness to my own end fast approaching. My heart pounding, my eyes hurting, I stood in the middle expecting to be tore to shreds, while goosebumps invaded my whole body as I could feel the absolute evil emanating from the two entities. In a desperate attempt to survive, I took out the two sticks to fight them and they both stopped, a few meters away from me.

"It is clear that foolishness runs in your family." The multiple voices said, still speaking at the same time.

"What's this? What you want?" I shouted, trembling and on the verge of tears.

"How low I have fallen. Calling on such a primitive being." They said.

"Who are you?" I asked.

"The child that you are lacks the wisdom to comprehend who and what I am." They replied. "You should ask that question to yourself. Who are you?" They asked back.

"I'm— I'm the Outlander." I answered.

The voices burst out laughing at my answer for a very brief moment before regaining their seriousness.

"I have lived for thousands of years, yet I have never witnessed such profound ignorance. I can understand why he has gone that far to reach transcendance. Your kind is doomed with foolishness and ignorance. Let me enlighten you on what you are and your purpose." They spoke.

"Why should I listen to you? Why should I believe you? Who are you?" I asked but they ignored my questions.

"After summoning me, Redeye, as that fool prefers to call himself, stole something very precious from me. Since, my powers have been limited and restricted to this dimension and this specific part of the underground temple I summoned you in. In another words, since you lack intelligence, this is my prison. If you want to free your people, take the red eye from him and place it back on the statue. Then, I shall do the rest." They said, still referring to themselves as one entity.

"What? I— I don't understand." I said.

"I shall not repeat myself. Not to beings like you. Such ignorant fools, yet so full of pride. You endure a ritual for several decades yet you remain in the same place. You desire to leave, yet you never fulfill that wish. You are oblivious to how Hazel escaped this place and what it actually cost her." They spoke.

"Hazel?" I said.

"You barely receive any visitor yet you never wonder the reason why. You are a community yet you do not have a clear place of worship, and most of you are ignorant of this very temple under your feet, ignorant of the spiritual and hidden realm. All of this is far from ordinary, yet you remain too proud to accept the fact that you are manipulated. Why? Because that would be admitting your weaknesses and limitations. You disgust me." It said.

"From what I heard, it's clear that you're the one who need my help." I responded, and the provocation made it approach the more from both sides, before it stopped again, now a few inches away from me.

"Child, I have lived for thousands of years and shall continue to live until the end of everything. You on the other end do not possess such privilege. I could rip you apart this instant and indent the plans of that fool, but what consequences will this have for you? For Carla? For Vivian? For your parents? For the promise you made to Edlynn?" It questioned, each time taking the voice of the person it referred to while speaking, and silencing me with its insightful response. "That fool will slaughter them all." It added, with its multiple voices.

"How— how do I do that? I don't know about the things you talk about." I replied. "Why is he doing all that? All that evil?" I asked.

"You will come to know when it is time. For now, you have an important meeting ahead." It said.

"The West Altar?" I spoke, checking on the watch and saw that it had stopped at 3:41 pm. "We're still far from 9 pm. There's still a lot of time left." I added.

"Ignorant fool! I already revealed to you that this place I inhabit is a different dimension where your rules do not apply. Learn to hear the words in between words. Remember what I have told you and fulfill your true purpose." It said while blinding me with its multiple red eyes that suddenly shone brighter.

After closing and covering my eyes with my forearms, I then felt a soft breeze caress my skin and heard several souls screaming randomly from afar and different directions. I opened my eyes and found myself outside in front of a familiar place during the night. The coast was clear, therefore, I quickly checked the time on the watch and read 8:17 pm. What I thought were a few minutes encounter happened to be hours long in the real world. Above me, I could then see red lightnings occasionally tearing the still red sky. Redeye was getting close and things were getting worse.

Better hurry, I thought, putting my weapons back in the bag before checking on the location of the West Altar. It did not take long and I quickly understood why the entity made me appear right at that familiar place. The map showed that the West Altar was precisely in the house behind me. I slowly turned around and approached the dark entrance left ajar as if I was expected. I stood in front of it, overwhelmed by a disturbing mix of dread and nostalgia. After all, I was home.
