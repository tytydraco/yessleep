Hello, my name is Alejandro, I was never a good person, I killed, tortured and did all kinds of atrocities, and throughout my life, I never regretted anything, not until I got to hell, you see, I have an extreme phobia of everything related to the sea, and I would much rather spend eternity trapped at the bottom of the sea than go to this shitty place I'm in today.

Many think that hell is a place where demons enslave you for eternity, and in fact it can be even worse than that, hell is a place where there are only damned people, so you will see all the time tribes, governments and even empires that share different goals with each other, so don't think it will be easy, you will have a lot of competition ahead of you.

My first experience in hell was not a very pleasant one, as when I died, I simply teleported into a dark and cramped pouch of flesh, while drowning in a thick and dark liquid, the only thing I could do was to try to tear at the walls in desperation, where after a long and desperate 10 minutes I eventually succeeded, I fell out of the pouch totally naked and dirty from the black liquid I was drowning in minutes ago.

I realized that I was in a place where the sky was totally reddish, the ground was made of a red hail, the bags of meat were located in a tree with dry black branches, I walked around the place, and ended up seeing a person sitting near the branches, I approached her, and noticed something different about her, she seemed to be days without eating a single thing, her skin was totally pale and with burns all over her body.

I asked that person for information, but she just looked at me and started whispering "Ты умрешь" "Ты умрешь" "Ты умрешь" and right after that she gave me an unprepared kick in my legs, which made me fall, and she kept hitting me continuously with punches on my head, I couldn't defend myself, so I ended up passing out.

When I woke up, I was tied to a tree, I couldn't escape, the more I moved the more I was trapped, until I saw the same person that I had seen before, he had a saw in his hand, at that moment I started to despair, since I knew very well what he was going to do, that's where the torture began, he started sawing my legs off and eating them in front of me, I asked God for forgiveness for all my sins, but it was no use, since I had been in a hole for a long time.

I ended up dying in the process, as I had lost a lot of blood, so I ended up returning in the same bag of flesh that I was in the beginning, only I was in a completely different place than last time, it was a hilly place, the ground was made of boulders, and the weather was totally cloudy, unlike last time which was a climate of terror, here it was much calmer.

I explored there for hours, until I saw a village, it was simple and the technology was basically medieval...
