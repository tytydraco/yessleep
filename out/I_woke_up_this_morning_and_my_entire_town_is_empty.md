To preface this, my town has a very small population. I’m not exactly sure how many people lived here, but it was at least a couple thousand. It’s the type of town you pass through on a roadtrip, lots of fields and farmhouses and some neighborhoods. A lot of people in town knew each other due to how small the town is. I was home for Christmas Break from College and enjoyed my stay. But I was getting ready to go back to school. Last night I packed my bags, as I only had two days left in my break. 
Last night I was sitting in the living room with my Dad, drinking a beer with him while the football game was on and shortly after I went to bed. 
When I woke up this morning, I did as usual. I showered, brushed my teeth and ate some breakfast. My parents weren’t home, and I figured they were at work. But when I looked at the driveway, I was confused, there cars were still here. How would they have gotten to work without their cars? 

I searched the entire house and nobody was here. It was so strange, and I decided to call them. When I called my mom, I could hear a phone ring from her and my dad’s bedroom. When I looked inside I could see that both of their phones were still on the chargers. At this point, I was getting a little freaked out. Who goes somewhere without their phones? What if something bad happened? 

I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this and call the police so I walked over to my next door neighbors house. My neighbor has a wife and young son, and from what I could tell, they were home as their cars were in the driveway. I knocked on the front door and asked, “hello? Is anyone home?” There was no answer, all I could hear was the sound of a few birds chirping but other than that, it was silent. I went back inside my house and stayed at the living room window to see if the neighbor would go outside, even just to see if a car would drive down my road. There was nothing. I’m really confused as to where everyone is. I even tried to call one of my friends who lives in town and all I got was ringing and eventually voicemail. 

Around noon I decided that I should go fill my car up on gas. I figured that my parents might be home by the time I got back. 
I grabbed my keys and put on my winter coat. 
When I was driving, I noticed that there were no cars on the road. Not a single car, as if everyone had decided to stay inside today. I looked at the parking lot at Walmart and saw that it was completely empty. It felt so surreal, like I was in a dream. I pulled into the gas station and started filling up my car. 
There was silence. Nothing but the sound of the wind and the gas filling up my tank. I had a feeling that I was being watched, you probably know the feeling. You’re alone in your house or in a room and you get that feeling. “Hello?!” I shouted, but there was no answer, just the echo of my voice. The silence started to creep me out so after I was done filling up my car, I drove back home. 
I ran throughout my house and found that my parents were still not home. There was no noise, aside from the radiator and the creaking from the wooden floor boards. 

It’s now the late evening, and I’m writing this. I have no idea what to do, could I please get some advice of what to do tomorrow? I will update with a part 2 when I wake up.
