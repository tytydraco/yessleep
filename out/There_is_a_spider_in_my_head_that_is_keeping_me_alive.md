There's an urban myth that says the average person will swallow eight spiders a year while they sleep.

The crunch they make is the worst part but she said I would get used to it and I did.

Sometimes their legs get stuck in my gums and I won't be able to pry them out for days. It keeps me occupied. 

When I was younger and stupider I was terrified of the idea of it. 

I can't remember where I heard it first but from then on it was all I thought about and occasionally it would keep me up until the early hours of the morning until I either slept with my face in the pillow or had to go to work.

I didn't sleep for nearly three days once but then I started to see little black spiders out of the corner of my eyes and when I woke up in hospital they told me I was going to die. 

I had about a year left. Eight spiders.

They said I had an incurable neurodegenerative disease and by the way he looked at me I could tell the doctor was shocked I hadn't died already. 

They told me I had holes in my brain and the holes were going to get bigger and bigger and that there was nothing they could do.

I didn't really say anything and then the doctors left to get my family from the crowded waiting room down the hall after they'd gone over the whole thing with me a couple more times. 

That's when I saw her. 

She was small and black like buttons on a funeral suit cuff, six little beads of onyx rested atop her head like a crown. Her legs carried her with an air of royalty as she manipulated each stalk of slender chitinous elegance one after another as she crawled along my skin. 

She wanted me to know she was there.

I remained still as she crawled up my arm and onto the itchy wafer thin hospital gown draped across my shoulder. 

She told me not to be frightened and I listened to her because I knew something this beautiful could never lie to me. 

She promised she would help me. She said if she could crawl into my ear and live inside my skull she would plug all those holes inside my brain with her webs. 

I thought she was crazy but I agreed. 

It's been six years since then and the only things I miss are hotdogs and my mother. 

Most of the time she's busy because the holes keep getting bigger and bigger but whenever she has time to spare we chat for a bit. 

Most of the time she talks about how hungry she is and I tell her it's getting harder and harder to find more spiders nowadays since I'm barred from the petshop and the shed collapsed. 

I thought it was a little weird at first that a spider would want to eat other spiders but I googled it and apparently they eat each other all the time. Even the baby spiders (they're called spiderlings) do it. 

I thought that was gross too but she told me it wasn't and that it was beautiful because it was family you were eating and after you ate them they were a part of you and you were a part of them and you both became something more. Then I told her I understood and I realised that it was beautiful and she was right. She‘s right about a lot of things. 

She tells me she's excited because soon we’ll be family as well. 

I think I'm excited too.
