I've been wanting to tell this story to many people, friends, family and girlfriend but i'm all to scared they wont believe me.

It all started a few days ago at 10:21PM I was relaxing, waiting for my girlfriend to get home when suddenly the doorbell rang. The loud dinging noise startled me, I got up, opened the door, fully expecting a hug and a kiss from my her, but no one. Not a single living soul out on the porch. All i could see though was only several feet in front of me, everywhere else was black. I'm a pretty paranoid person, but at this time of night I wasn't feeling it, so, I yelled "Who ever doorbell ditched me, please don't do it again."

I went back to my room and waited for the love of my life to come back. But all I heard was that dreaded doorbell, three more times. The third time I waited by the door and the millisecond the door bell rang I looked in the peep hole but it was black. Until suddenly it was uncovered and all I saw was empty porch. The fourth time the bell rang I instead opened the door this time immediately, but, there was nothing. I decided to lock the door and go to sleep to try and make who ever was doing this to get bored and give up. I couldn't sleep though, the suffocating silence made me so anxious to hear the door bell again I couldn't think straight. At this point the paranoia was in full effect, but, nothing else happened no doorbell rings.

Eventually though the exhaustion took me into the safety of slumber. I must have woken up not to long after because my girlfriend was still nowhere to be seen. But that's not what woke me, at this point I noticed it, the doorbell was ringing, so many times a second I couldn't even click that fast on a mouse. I ran to the door, the doorbell was still going crazy so I rammed as hard as i humanly could, and broke the door, landing on the porch. Luckily my girlfriend moved out of the way and yelled "What the hell are you doing!" I told her about the doorbell ringing inhumanly fast, but, absolutely no knowledge about the doorbell. Like it didn't even happen. Now, I honestly think I might have been lost my mind, as i'm typing this my girlfriend is sleeping at her grandparents house because she said she was afriad of me, from what I done about the door and breaking it. But, I wait, I wait for that single ding to happen and when it does, I'll be ready. 

&#x200B;

I wait, so intently, my mind almost makes the sound in my head for a moment. This is the worst kind of fear knowing, your worst fear is going to happen, and just waiting for it at any moment, and not being able to do anything about it. But as I sit so scared about that single noise, it finally happened. The single metallic ring came out from the living room. All that was going through my mind at that point was getting the hell out of that house. I had already set a plan to jump out the bed room window and run to the neighbors house. As I started to open the window the doorbell started to ring now         
 at least a few times a second. I thought very quickly there was no way they was getting through the new door we bought, but that was the last thing that was going through my mind at that moment.

 I jumped out of the window and looked over at the porch and saw nothing. I continued to run and eventually the door, with no one around suddenly collapsed inward toward the house into the living room. "The fuck?" I thought, At this point I was ringing the neighbors door bell so fast it doesn't even sound normal anymore. I eventually gave up, and decided to sit on their doorstep for the next few minutes and calm my nerves and to go back into that house. I could still see it, from here, dead and empty not a single person is near that house, and yet, it still seems like a million pounds on my shoulders every time i look near that place. Eventually i'm gonna have to come back, as I thought about that my heart sunk knowing there could be anyone or anything inside that place.

&#x200B;

 As I thought about running in the house and grabbing my keys to drive to my parents house, each thought causing more and more fear to erupt in my delusional state of fear and panic about the events that had transpired over the last couple of minutes. I very carefully walked closer and closer to the house each step adding a million more pounds of fear and panic on to me. As i got about 15 feet away i heard that doorbell going off almost as fast as that one night. No one was pressing it to though. Not a single person on the porch is even close to ringing the bell, like its just ringing it's self. I did eventually step inside, doorbell still going crazy I very quickly walked into the bedroom to grab my keys, heart pounding a million miles an hour. I found them and ran toward the door.

As I got one step from the outside, I looked back into that house and into the bathroom, I saw a giant, white creature feasting on my girlfriend. Each time it would take a bite It would make the exact noise a doorbell would make. I got the hell out of there and drove to my parents house.

 I was so shocked and scared I couldn't even tell them the truth, I just ended up lying and saying I got into a fight with her. They wanted to call her but I stopped them. Now, I'm in the guest bedroom wondering what the fuck happened the past few days, I really hope the people reading this would help me and give me an explanation. I think i'm starting to calm down until, I heard a single metallic doorbell noise come from inside my parents room.
