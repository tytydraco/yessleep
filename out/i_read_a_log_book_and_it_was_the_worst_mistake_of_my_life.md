Before i start this story let me tell you a bit about myself,  
you can call me OP, im 19 and i live with my mom, my dad left me at a young age so ive always had to help out around the house more  
you can call me mom M, and heres how this story starts  
  
One day i was helping my mom and my moms friend, we can refer to her as F, i was helping out M and F cleaning out Fs basement.  
it was alyways so dusty, M and F had been friends ever since i was born, so i used to always play at her house, but as kids we were never aloud to go into the basement, so this is my 1st time seeing it, but as a kid it would always scare me. so as i was cleaning out the basement F told me that if theres anything i wanted i could talk to her about it and i might be able to keep it, but nothing in here really seemed that cool. after about 3 hours of cleaning i had found something. a notebook? or maybe a journal. it seemed interesting, and old, as i read i realized it was more of a log book, and it kept getting weirder and weirder, heres what it said.  
 "monday july 16th ----" the year was to hard to read cause of how old it was, i continued to read. "today was as normal as most days, i fed my cats, and ate breakfest, things didnt start getting weird til the afternoon,"  
it seems that the book had time stamps as well, maybe it might be usefull? "1:30 pm, i went to watch my show, since it started at 1:45, i had gotten some snacks since 2 new ep were supposed to come out today,"  
 "2:15 pm, the 1st ep had just finished, and now the 2nd one is starting, about half way through it the news came on, interupting my show, i was worried since this only happens if something really bad is going on. The news said that everyone had to lock their doors, and get away from any windows but never said why, i assumed that it had something to do with a tornado since usually thats why we would do something like that, but i stopped thinking about it and grabbed my cats to go hide in my basement, i had food down there so i should be fine for a couple of days."  
that was the 1st day in the log book, or the 1st day of something weird going on, and it only gets weirder in the next day, "tuesday, july 17th ----" "ive been staying in my basement, nothing weird has happened, its one crazy storm and its not stopping, i got a notification on my phone, the alert says as followed "please stay indoors away from any windows, make as little noise as possible, and dont come out of hiding until you feel as if its safe." it basically said the same thing as the news, but what does it mean by dont make noise if its just a storm then noise shouldnt matter,"  
"2:51 am" "i woke up in the middle of the night to my cats hissing at something.. but i couldnt see anything, its as if they were talking to a wall, or through a wall? theres no windows in my basement exept for one at the very back of the basement, i went to check it and found my other cat, she was looking outside as if in horror, but i couldnt see anything maybe its just one of those things cats do."  
"wednesday july 18th ----" "i woke up in horror, usually when i write these entrys i write them at the end of the day, but now im writing them as it happens, but that doesnt matter, theres something there, the windows broken and theres something standing there, i see its eyes, its long skinny legs, but i cant make out any other details, its foggy, and hard to breath, im trying to stay still and not make noise but i noticed something, its my cat, but it doesnt seem to be moving, did the thing get to it 1st, theres no sign of my other cat."  
i continue to make eye contact with "it" trying as little to blink, cause im worried if i do i might die, i read about this one time, i think they call it a weeping angel, i thought that stuff was fake, and now im worried that it might be that, i take a breather and as i start i blink i run up my stairs, out of the basement and to the bathroom,"  
"thursday july 19th ----" if your reading this, i may already be gone, last night i passed out in the bathroom and woke up in a pool of blood, i cant make out if its my own or not, i used the rest of my strength to get down to the basement, i only wanted to check on my cats, one of them is dead and i cant find the other, im in a pool of my own blood and tears, that thing couldnt even spare my cat. i see something, it looks like a statue, a very strang statue, its not the same thing as last time. but it seems to be more blocky then the other thing, i dont care anymore, if you reading this its already to late, that thing is already looking for you to, hide. and make sure not to-"  
and thats where it ends, im now hiding in the same basement i just cleaned out, after reading it i went to talk to M and shes no where to be found, as if they left or disappeared. and now that your reading this it might already be to late for you to, hide somewhere safe and make sure your animals are okay, if you dont hear from me again im most likely dead, thanks for reading and hopefully you'll have more luck then i did.
