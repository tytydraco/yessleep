Hi! Im( 23 enby) a student at a medical university and I'm studying to become a doctor.It was my dream to become a doctor from when I was little. 

  I moved from home 4 years ago when I was 19.Right now it's takes you 4 hours and something with the plane from my home town to here so my relatives don't come often.I think I just saw my family 2 times this year.I have insomnia,ADHD and possibly PTSD.I think this is all you need to know about me.

  On 1 St June is my birthday and it was also the pride month parade there I meat a lot of friends.After the parade we gone to a local shop to get some ice cream there I found my home town ice cream.It's very rare to find my home town ice cream here.I bought it and I was really happy that I found that ice cream.A friend of mine asked me why I was so happy.I responded with "Because this is my favourite ice cream!! I love it! I love it! I love it!"

 After I said that they all started to laugh and then that friend told me "Ohh so..you like this ice cream...got it!" All started to laugh so I laugh with them too because I didn't want to ruin the mood. 

  After that some of them including that person who ask me let's call her Amy.So including Amy they told us that they need to go home.So I and the rest of the people that stayed we planned to go wach a movie.

  After the movie I got home and I opened the refrigerator to take out the veggies. Then I saw my favourite ice cream. I was confused but I brushed off and thought that maybe I bought it a long time ago so I just eat it.After I eat it I put the veggies to cook and then I saw that I was added to a group with the people from the parade.They were talking about ice cream so I told them that I actually had an ice cream like what I ate it today in my refrigerator and just didn't know.They all laughed about this except Amy.Amy said something like "Hmm are you sure you bought it?". 

  When I saw that message I was stunned. Then people said "Amy! Don't be like this." Then Amy said "They know that was a joke. They aren't 3. You knew that was a joke right?"
And my replay was "Yeah! And the joke was really funny!".After that Amy replay with "Finally a fan of my jokes!".But I was thinking only at that question she put.Ok so fast forward we planned to meet the next day all at the book store.

 After I came from the book store I opened my refrigerator to take my energy drink and then I saw my favourite ice cream again.I realised that I got a message from our group asking us what we were up to.I said that I found again my favourite ice cream in the refrigerator.And they all told me that my refrigerator must be magic or something. 

  I tried to not really think about it and I ate the ice cream.The next day I was gone to buy some food.When I came home I was curious if I had another ice cream in my fridge.When I opened the refrigerator I saw again that ice cream.Then I started to freak out because I knew the other day I saw only one ice cream.

  I tried to not think that much about it so I put the food that I bought that day in the fridge and I took the ice cream and I dumped it.Btw I'm the only one that has keys to my apartment soo yeah...
