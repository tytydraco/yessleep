My name is Tamantha ‘Trouble’ Turrell, if you're reading this, then Hikatoba, Idaho is gone.

It all started on September 21st. I woke up and went to my little dead-end job at Marinette's coffee house. A small mom-and-pop style coffee shop. Since our podunk town was too small for a Starbucks, this was the best we could do. I unlocked the employee entrance, got the machines up and running, and started making Mr. Sampson's order. Once the coffee was percolating, I unlocked the front door and flipped the sign. The same as always, nothing ever changes in Hikatoba.

At exactly 6:45 A.M., Mr. Sampson walked through the front door, like always. He was a large man; he towered over my staggering 5’5” like some biblical giant. He kind of looked like someone gave a gorilla a terrible haircut, all muscle and hair. His pug-like face scrunched up in what could be generously described as a smile, with his prominent canines on full display. “Good morning, Mr. Sampson, having a good day?” I asked in my best customer service voice, a fake smile on my face.

“Morning, Miss Turrell. I'm having a wonderful day! Excited for the festival tonight?” His voice boomed out, shaking me from my routine momentarily. He was normally a very reserved man.

“Festival? I haven't heard anything about it.” I had lived here my entire life, and we had never had a festival around this time.

“Ah, it’s the full moon harvest festival. Mayor Prescott decided to revive it this year. We haven't done it since I was a pup.” He gave a hearty chuckle after he spoke. “It’ll be in the town square tomorrow night, make sure to show up, lass. It’ll be a celebration of a lifetime.” He paid and left shortly after.

Overly exuberant potato farmers aside, the rest of my shift passed like normal. With me doom-scrolling on my phone most of my shift, unfortunately interrupted on occasion to do my job. At 8:30 P.M., I wrapped up my shift by vaulting the day's meager earnings and cleaning the machines. It was 9 P.M. when I locked up the door and started on my way back home. The moon was out softly illuminating the two-lane road that ran through the center of town. Scattered street lamps lit up parts of the street better, but the majority of them were broken from generations of bored teenagers. Our small village couldn't even afford to replace them until next year.

I was about halfway back to my duplex when I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise. It felt like someone or something was watching me. Glancing around, the only thing I saw was the mist from my breath in the chilly autumn air. As I passed by an alleyway, I heard a trash can get knocked over and a loud gravelly hiss. The sound nearly made me jump out of my skin, and I spun around, quickly getting into what could liberally be called a boxer's stance. A large tomcat came streaking out of the alley and ran across the street. The relief I felt nearly sent me to my knees until I heard a howl.

We don't have a ton of wolves in Idaho, but we do have a decent population. Not enough to be hearing them in town, however. Later I figured it was probably someone’s hound dog or a coyote howling out. That fact didn't stop me from immediately racing back to my crappy little duplex, nearly dropping my keys as I hurriedly tried to unlock my door. When I finally got inside, I all but slammed the door shut, locking it before collapsing onto my rear right in front of it, sighing in relief at being safe in my home. The feeling of being watched was finally gone.

After a little while of calming myself down, I set about my nightly routine, turning on some music, showering, and reheating leftovers from 3 days ago. My half of the house was on the ground floor, and thankfully my upstairs neighbor was a truck driver who wouldn't be home for three more days, so I wouldn't have to listen to his booming footsteps all night. Turning off my music and flipping on the SYFY channel, I passed out on my hand-me-down couch to the dulcet tones of some B-rate horror flick about the Beast from the mountains or something equally cheesy.

Around midnight, I got woken up by some dumb werewolf movie. The howling and various other noises like scratching, sniffing, and growling must have gotten my sleep-addled brain to throw up some terrible dream thinking there was something at my own door, or at least that's what I thought at the time.

When morning arrived, I set about the herculean task of waking up. I was halted in my epic quest by my phone ringing. It was my boss, Mrs. Harriet. She was a sweet old lady whose husband had passed away a few years ago. “Hello, Tammy dear, I just wanted to let you know you won't be needed at the shop today. I'm closing down for the festival, so go have fun and maybe meet a boy tonight. Like that Carson's boy, you know he's carried a torch for you since you both were in diapers.” She also elected herself my personal matchmaker.

“I’ll be at that festival, Mrs. Harriet, and no, I will not be going with Scott Carson.” The jerk stole my cookies in elementary school and I will never forgive him. Her grandmotherly chuckle told me that she was by no means deterred.

“We’ll see, dearie. Ah, I can't wait for you young’uns to see your first harvest. It was always such a treat as a child; the sky would light up like the Fourth back in the day.” Her wistful tone was almost reverent as if she was remembering an almost religious experience. “Well, I’ll let you go now, sweetie. Come say hello before the big finale, and if you bring a boy I'll buy you both a treat.” She bribed, making me roll my eyes.

We said our goodbyes and I promptly flopped back onto the couch, excited to relax for a little while longer than normal. By the time I actually got up and ready, it was noon. When I stepped outside, I could already hear the hustle and bustle of the locals setting up in the center of town about three blocks away. When I went to lock my door, I noticed it. The upper half of the windowless metal door was covered in claw marks: shallow furrows, widely spaced on its surface far too high for any hound or coyote.

A cold sense of dread filled me from the cruel revelation. I fled towards the center of town, not quite jogging but definitely fast walking. I hoped that being around others would keep me safe and calm me down. Even the scent of vinegar-covered French fries, finger steaks, and ice cream potatoes couldn't keep my mind off of the fear lancing through me. The festival was little more than a glorified street fair early in the day with small groups of teens and young adults milling about buying food and various knickknacks from street vendors, while the village elders set up street games and stalls. I meandered about, finding myself drawn to the large stage being set up at the center of the small park that was the town square.

I could recognize everyone setting up the stage with sound equipment and small braziers. It was mostly the male teachers from the local public school, but one face stood out, Mayor Prescott. Once I got to the foot of the stage, he greeted me with a warm smile. “Ms. Tamantha Turrel, not causing any problems today?”

I winced at his words; this was the problem with tiny towns and villages. Everyone knew everyone and, worse, knew all the nonsense they got up to as kids. “No, sir, Mayor Prescott, I'm just enjoying the fair. Promise.” I was a bit of a hellion growing up, and frequently got stern talking-to’s by the mayor and local sheriff, Tom Carson. Despite my reservations on dating the damnable cookie thief, Scott and I were thick as thieves when we were kids, always getting into trouble, and thankfully his dad would let us go with a slap on the wrist. Yay nepotism.

“Mhmm, I’m sure, Trouble.” I blushed at the old nickname. “Scott is helping out with the dunk tank, would you mind lending him a hand? Someone needs to run the game while he gets drenched.”

A smirk filled with schadenfreude crossed my face as I happily agreed. He pointed me in the right direction and I made my way through the milling throngs that only seemed to grow as the day wore on. When I got to the tank, the six-foot, ginger lunk was sitting on the small diving board looking exceptionally bored. When he saw me approaching, he immediately groaned. “No. No. No, not you, come on” He whined out, dragging out the n of on like a petulant child.

“Sorry, Scooter, mayor's orders,” I grinned up at him maliciously. He rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue.

“How ya been, Trouble, break anyone's nose recently?” the bakery burglar cheeked back.

“Steal any poor defenseless maiden’s sweets recently?” I asked in reply.

He snorted. “I never once stole any maiden’s sweets. I valiantly fought a dragon for her hoard,” He defended his honor with lies and slander.

I stared at him with a raised eyebrow, before raising my fist to the target that served as the idiot’s drop switch. He scoffed, “Cheater. For real though, Tammy, how ya been? I hardly ever see you anymore.”

“If you left that farm of yours more than once a year, maybe I’d grace you with my beautiful visage,” I let my words linger for a second in false pretension before letting out a long sigh, the weight of last night’s events coming back in full force. “Honestly though, something followed me home last night. I'm a little freaked out.”

That got his attention quickly and he straightened up like a soldier on his little plywood seat. “What the hell? You’re not hurt, are you?”

“I’m fine, Scott. I won't get my deposit back though. Whatever it was scratched my door the hell up. It might have been a wolf.” After a quick glance around, seeing no one coming toward us, I leaned closer to his Plexiglas tank. “Promise not to laugh?” He nodded and leaned in. “I think it was a huge werewolf,” I whispered to him. He immediately reeled back, laughing. His stupid belly laugh only infuriated me. “I’m serious, Scott! There are freaking claw marks at the top of my door!" I stamped my foot, my face flushing red at the admittedly crazy things leaving my mouth.

His peels of laughter died down, seeing my pissed-off face. “All right, fine, fine, you got a werewolf stalker. Want me to get some silver bullets and come over tonight?” He could barely hide his building giggle fit behind a poker face that had gotten us into trouble more than once. The not-so-little shit.

“Yes,” I pouted, turning my crimson face away from him. I noticed with vindictive glee a group of teens heading our way. “Hey, come on over and try to dunk the village idiot!” I yelled out, pointing to the poorly painted graphic on the side of the dunk tank showing the price. “Only a dollar a throw!” The surge of euphoria I felt as they hurried our way and Scott's squawk of indignation was glorious.

The boys walked up, forking over the cash quickly. After I handed them their baseballs, they got lined up behind the line painted into the grass with spray paint, and immediately sent the big moron to his watery punishment. Peals of laughter escaped the boys at Scott's horrified yelp as he plunged into the chill water; his shaggy orange hair made him look like a wet sheepdog as he emerged from the depths grumbling about evil women. The rest of our afternoon continued like that: banter, fake arguments, and me egging passersby to come dunk him whenever he got the upper hand. I wish I knew it would be the last time I ever heard the big guy’s laugh.

As sunset rolled around, I helped Scott out of the tank and followed him over to the nearby ice cream parlor that was being used as a public restroom. He dried off and got changed before rejoining me. “Hey Tam, sorry for laughing earlier. My offer still stands if you're not feeling safe. Although I don’t think I have any silver bullets. A .45 usually stops whatever you put it into,” he said, showing me the pistol he's keeping hidden under a button-up shirt. It was hanging in an appendix carry holster, looking like his dad’s old 1911.

“I… I’d appreciate that," I told him haltingly. We strolled for a few minutes, the sunset’s purple and orange hues illuminating the world in a soft glow. The braziers scattered around the park were lit by volunteers, casting an almost comforting glow around the quickly darkening world. That's when I saw Mrs. Harriet.

“Mrs. Harriet!” I ran up, Scott on my heels like a lovesick puppy as I jogged up to my boss. She kept walking toward the stage oblivious to us. “Mrs. Harriet, how are you?” I asked once we got to her side.

She kept walking, not looking over at us. “Come on, dear, we can’t be late for the prayer.” She led the way to the stage in a quick old lady shuffle, excited to share a moment of her youth with us. I could do without praying to a God I don't believe in, but I supposed indulging an old lady wouldn't kill me, so I followed. As we arrived, we were a bit late, managing to snag the lucrative spot at the very back of the crowd. She finally acknowledged our presence fully. “Oh, so you did take my advice, dear?” Her smirk was insufferable. “No sneaking off to go make out, the end of the festival is the best part, dear.” Turning from my flustered self, she looked over at Scott. “You behave too, little scooter.”

Seeing she turned us both into tongue-tied messes, she gave out a quick cackle of old-lady laughter before turning to the stage, as the mayor walked out to the center of it wearing a weird cloak. It was a shade of green that reminded me of the deep woods right at the cusp of night, or the depths of the ocean. “Dwellers of Hikatoba!” The mayor’s voice boomed out, the speakers on stage barely working but in the hushed silence of twilight his voice carried far and loud. “Tonight we celebrate the equinox, and harvest for the Lord.”

“Rush’tavg,” the voices of the older villagers resonated out in the park. It was then I noticed everyone under 30 was in the center of the group with only me and Scott being outliers. I looked at him quizzically, silent, trying to ask him if he knew what the hell the old folks just said. He just shrugged, shaking his head no.

“When the moon is at its zenith, the harvest shall begin and our worship shall be rewarded!” the mayor continued, uncaring of the confusion spreading among the youngest members of the village. Some fearfully chatted, and looked around.

“Rush’tavg,” the elders chanted once more, and I was brutally reminded of last night's events as the feeling of being watched resurfaced once again. The moon began to rise, a sickly pale green glow emanating off of it as it peeked through the tree line, looking far larger than ever before. It was like someone had pulled it hundreds of miles toward the earth, and it felt like it was staring down on the village's ritual.

“The time of celestial alignment is upon us, my flock, raise your voice and bring forth your prayers for the Lord,” the mayor intoned to the gathered mass as a slow fog crept into the clearing.

“Rush’tavg,” the monotone chant echoed out once more. I looked over and saw Mrs. Harriet's eyes were clouded over in a midnight black. She looked like she was possessed. With a loud thud, my eyes were wrenched back to the stage as a new, large, inhuman figure took up its place behind the mayor. It was shaped like a hound, but completely wrong. It was about ten feet tall, sitting on its haunches. Its body seemed to shift and rip open, revealing maws lined with sharpened canines, and eyes that looked to be cut from jade—all color, no pupil, no cornea. Where eyes would be on a normal dog, the mutant mutt had additional slobbering maws, tongues hanging freely, pointed and coated in sickening red goopy slobber. Its eyeless head fixated on me for a moment, and the feeling of being watched increased a thousandfold.

“The Lord is pleased with this season's harvest! He has sent his carrier to us.” The mayor preached to his faithful, uncaring of the fearful murmurs of the gathered young at the center of the crowd. Scott grabbed my arm, pulling my attention from the hound’s unfaltering stare. My mind pounded as he motioned with his head. I nodded in agreement to his unspoken plan to run while we could.

“Rush’tavg Nah Vir Sah’tohem,” the crowd began to chant and raise their arms. Scott and I slowly backed away, keeping our eyes locked on the occult scene before us. I swear the sky flashed, lit up in an ethereal green like the aurora borealis had decided to appear. It was gone before I could blink, and the hound stood, its eyeless sockets in its face still locked on us. The elders’ arms lowered, locking in a ring around the younger townsfolk, and the beast stepped down among them. Its eye tongues lashed out, tasting and sampling frightened young adults and children. It stopped in front of Susan Chalimege, a 7-year-old kid who would come by the coffee shop for baked goods we’d sell. It took a long sniff of her face before snorting and looking back up at me, the various shifting eyes across its body squinting before it gave out a low bark. The bass of it reverberated through my bones even though Scott and I were almost a football field away. The sky flashed again, longer this time. There were swirls of the cloudy green substance in the sky writhing through the air like great worms swimming through the ether. They were gone a moment later.

Scott and I turned after the abomination barked and started sprinting down the road. We could hear the creature's thunderous paws pound the ground behind us in a haunting rhythm. It felt like death itself was chasing us down the road. Its low, resonating howl echoed in the night air. The fearful cries of the children in the park and the mayor's elated shout of “The carrier has chosen this season's harvest!” acted as sickening backup singers to the howl’s lead vocals. Realizing either Scott or I was chosen by some fucked-up mix of hound and demon as a sacrifice made us run even harder.

Once we made it halfway to my place, Scott turned to me, his face hauntingly gorgeous backlit by the ever-flickering sky, black tendrils now sweeping the cosmic green slurry in the flashes. “Go, I’ll slow it down. Get somewhere safe, Trouble,” His words greatly irked me as he pulled the pistol and started to slow down.

“The hell you will, Scott Mathias Carson! You have to protect me from werewolves tonight!” I screamed at him, tears beginning to form in my eyes knowing what the idiot was planning.

He just gave me that damn lopsided smile before whispering, “I am.” He stopped completely and turned. “Get safe and leave this shithole like ya always wanted to, Trouble! I got this!” His yell was accompanied by hot stinging trails of tears scorching down my cheeks as I kept running. The gunshots behind me echoed hollowly into the night, each blast emphasized with another flash from the sky, its eyes watching me in cruel indifference. They were emeralds, like the abomination’s eyes but blown up to massive size like blimps in the sky. At that scale you could see the center looked like waterfalls into endless voids of green, a strange depth endless but visible. My head throbbed in pain as I ran into my door. The gunshots went silent and the screaming started as I fumbled my keys trying desperately to get them into the damn lock. The key slotted into the lock and the screaming stopped with a sickening squelching pop.

I slammed my door shut, hoping it was up for a repeat of last night's performance, as I huddled in my closet. I pulled out my phone and started to write this warning. Hopefully whatever is covering the sky can't block wifi. Even now, after writing this all out, I can hear the beast pounding on my door using Scott’s voice trying to get me to leave. “Trouble, come on. You were chosen. It's a great honor.” I can feel the moon's loving gaze bearing down fully on the village, its tendrils reaching down and tenderly caressing the streets. Please heed my warning: Hikatoba is gone, do not come.
