**Northern France, 1277**

Jehan de Beauvais, born 1220 in the vast, sprawling Beauvais countryside. In his earlier writings he speaks of the clerics, how they had taught him the Latin psalms, and *Musica Mensurata*. Jehan was mystified by the poetic models like the *Canticles* and Ovid’s *Ars Amatoria*. Jongleurs — itinerant performers — sang tales of romance and uproarious crusader songs.

The busy mind, as well as the shaking hands of a young Jehan, only became steady in times of deep, thoughtful composition. As a young man, Jehan entered the service of a local noble household. With years of dedication and miraculous talent, his works were praised far beyond his patron’s court, performed at many noble gatherings in Arras.

I came to discover the firsthand account of the last days and hauntings of Jehan de Beauvais. I had inherited his writings from my uncle, who ran a small monastic archive. Within them, he described at length the darkness upon his very soul. Whilst he had lived an opulent, privileged existence, it would turn out that there was more to his success than merely a lifetime of dedication. The following are translated recollections of the night that made him legend — the night that shattered both mind and body.



**“The Lord of Air and Song has been said to enfold the human form and breathe the gifts of the gods into men such as I. Though I toil, I dream to be the greatest, the most legendary conveyer of art the world has ever known. If such a divine teacher exists, it shall be my life’s ambition to summon him and learn every lesson he has to offer. Inquiring in circles less savory, I acquired a ritual — a ritual said to call forth the very being I had long sought to see.”**

**“On the eve of St. John’s Night” (June 23rd). “I took to the valley, far from the light of the village. I trod beyond the distance my feet had been prepared for, and they bled. The wind rose, and I knew at once: this would be the place. According to the ritual, scratched deep upon brittle parchment, I took from my waist a sack of salt and spread it across the soil. The night itself seemed alive — the insects, the wind, and the very trees sang in quiet chorus.”**

**“I placed my lute upon the ground, drew my dagger, and with deliberate purpose dragged it across the length of my palm, letting the blood drip to my fingertips. The warm crimson fell in slow motion upon the earth. Time itself stilled. I was certain every sound upon this world had ceased. I clutched my ears, struck dumb by the magnitude of the sensation.”**

**“A sound cleaved the night — a voice. Turning faster than my body would allow, I nearly folded in upon myself. I had come that night seeking a master of the soul, the Lord of the Air and Song, yet what I encountered was no lord I had imagined.”**

**“He appeared as a man might, without cloak or shadow. Tall, pale as morning milk, yet no dawn would claim him. His eyes held the patience of a scholar and the hunger of a beast. No dust clung to his feet, though the road was mud. His hands were clean, uncalloused — the hands of one who had never labored with mortal toil.”**

**“The figure smiled without warmth and spoke as if the air itself bent to attend his words. I heard no thunder, no hiss — only the cadence of a voice, measured as a priest reciting words too ancient to be taken for Latin. When I gazed upon his face, I felt not fear, but the terrible certainty that all beauty is but imitation — and he was the original of the imitation.”**

**“He reached for my lute. Through the void it rose to my hands, thrumming rhythmically as if a heart had begun anew in a body for the first time. As my blood streaked the delicate wood, my eyes met the pale giant. ‘No parchment, no quill,’ he said. I extended my hand in token of payment. ‘No blood,’ he replied. ‘You have given what was yours to give.’”**

**“My new hands began to dance. I beckoned the wind to rise, and gusts threw soil against my back. The once-quiet valley became filled with a chorus impossible to behold — angels and demons singing in dueling harmony. The trees leaned closer to listen; the stones wept dew; the night itself folded about me. A heavy mist carried rosemary and yew upon us. As the godlike figure danced, blood fell to the trembling earth — and then, he was gone.”**

**“I would have been called mad to recount these facts before. Yet the Lord of Song — that very Lord of Chaos — has returned to me. I had labored in youth to master the lessons he offered, but such effort pales against the work required to deny the truth: this night was no dream. I, Jehan de Beauvais, am cursed. I have sold my soul to the Lord of Air and Song. I have sold my soul to the Devil.”**



The texts before me now detail the descent into madness Jehan experienced on his deathbed. Many pages are faded, hundreds of years old. I must assume much is miswritten, likely the product of extreme delirium. I have done my best to fill the gaps left by sprawling garnet stains across the parchment.



**“That time, which felt like dream, was no dream. Had I stood upon that ground and made such a pact, I would pay in this lifetime. Visions of an impending end weigh upon me still, crushing as stone. The wasting sickness has rested within every shadow of my body. My lungs rot; death waits just beyond my heavy door.”**

**“Now I have seen it! There is a hell, and I have stood upon its threshold. I awoke choking upon bile and blood. The tremble through my hands carries the memory of its agony. I can still scent that furnace as I write. The wooden and steel gears beneath us all turned endlessly — the fire raged with my screams as its billows.”**

**“Clutching my Bible as I write these final words, I pray some mercy may yet be found for me, in this life or the next. My blood-stained lips beckon in my own reflection, calling me back to ponder how little time remains. Since the year of the Great Frost, I have not smelled such a scent, nor heard such profound silence fall upon the world.”**

**“Unlike before, the soundlessness was broken by no voice. My vocal cords dissolved in the dry death within me, incapable of piercing the nothingness that hung about. Moments passed like a bird in flight — then struck by lightning, I fell still. Thoughts, once fleeting, now piled at the forefront of my mind.”**

**“I lay curled upon myself, the silence boring a void into the very seat of my mind. Between choking on my mortality and praying to God for succor, no answer came. The sun never rose, and the pain through my body, searing my very soul, never waned. In desperation to endure, I called upon the source of the silence — the rot within my lungs.”**

**“The godlike figure appeared suddenly; all at once he was before me. The silence that had torn my soul was filled with the humming of his presence. The sound nearly suffused my lungs as he reclaimed them. My hands moved frantically against time — my final, strangled blink.”**

**“He who would buy beauty with his soul,**  
**shall find the price grows dearer each refrain.**  
**For music is no art of man.**  
**The gods wept for your art —**  
**they will hear your song no more.**  
**In the valley of the wretched**  
**there lies a stage.**  
**You will count the notes,**  
**like a rat counting silver in the dark.**  
**You shall keep your undoing,**  
**but I will keep the time.”**

The last entry on the final stained piece of parchment differed from all that came before. The writing had grown large, misshapen, nearly illegible, executed with an ornate precision almost never seen on pieces this old. Then it became clear: the ink was still wet, smudging beneath my finger, as if written right before my eyes — by the Lord of Air and Song himself. The faint scent of rosemary and smoke danced around me.
