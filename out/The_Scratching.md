Dr. Silas’s office doesn’t breathe; it *vibrates*. No sterile, cold steel furniture. No clinical white lights. Just walls that *hum*, a pulse crawling through the air, slithering into my skin. The frequency—it’s not loud, not at first—but it grows, winding tighter, until it feels like it’s found the rhythm of my heartbeat. Breathing becomes a task, my lungs working through thick, metallic air. Not sharp, no, but dull, suffocating, like inhaling the aftermath of rusted metal and decay.

"You won't see them," Silas had said, his voice flat, words spilling slow, deliberate. Every syllable sits heavy, sinking into my thoughts, sticking there. “There are no rats."

No rats. Sure. Fine. But then—what is this? My muscles twitch, my bones itch. It's nothing at first, just a tremor. Anxiety, I think. But it doesn’t stop. It doesn’t *leave.* The tremor becomes a pull—small at first, then deeper, like my body is fighting itself.

I tell my fingers to stop. They won’t. My hand jerks in quick, erratic spasms, twitching like something’s crawling under the skin.

Twitch. Stop. Stop. They don’t listen, they won’t listen. My fingers—they’re someone else’s now, hooked on a string, jerking, shaking. No control. None left.

Silas watches. Always watching. His pen, poised. His eyes, cold, black. A gleam there, something too still, too calm.

"Hypervigilance," he says. “It’s all in your head."

But is it? My body—my *bones*—disagree. There's something under the surface. I know it. A scraping, maybe. No. Not scraping. Chewing. Yes, chewing, slow and deliberate, biting down on muscle and marrow. There’s no blood, no marks. But I can *feel* it, deep in the tissue, something moving, gnawing through the tendons like they’re strings to be plucked.

Jason, one of the others—his hands don’t shake anymore. No, they convulse. I saw him try to open a door earlier, but his fingers—those fingers—they’ve started curling, nails splitting down the middle, peeling back like rotten fruit, curling into jagged hooks. He didn’t scream. Didn’t even flinch. Just… stared.

I asked Silas if this was part of the process. He didn’t blink. “You’re imagining it,” he says. His voice—too calm. It doesn’t match the vibrations clawing through my skin, doesn’t match the cracking sounds I hear deep in my bones. The gnawing—it’s louder now. Sharper. There’s an edge to it, like a blade dragging through tissue, carving, digging. I feel my spine *shift* when I try to stand, like something inside is pushing, hollowing me out. My legs twitch. My fingers jerk. My body doesn’t feel like mine anymore.

By now, Jason’s silent. Just sits there, eyes wide, staring at his hands. His hands… I can’t look at them anymore. There’s nothing human about them. His nails are jagged hooks, his fingers snapped back at impossible angles. But it’s not just his hands. His arms—they jerk now, too. I hear the same sound in him that I hear in me. The gnawing, chewing, breaking.

I don’t know how long it’s been. Days blur, melt together. Time doesn’t hold here, not when every minute stretches into something unbearable. My body? Barely holding. My nails have started splitting like Jason’s, curling inward. My skin—tight, stretched, paper-thin. I can feel the gnawing in my bones, chewing through marrow. I’m hollow. I’m becoming something else, something that doesn’t belong to me.

I look at Silas. He’s watching. Of course he is. His pen, still poised, never quite touches the paper. It’s as if he’s waiting for something specific, something only he understands. He doesn’t blink, doesn’t move, except for that split-second flicker of his lips, too fast to be a smile, but… there’s something. His eyes, gleaming like glass, too still, like he already knows what I’m turning into.

"Stop it," I tell him. My voice comes out hoarse, barely a whisper. My throat, dry, cracked. "Make it stop."

But Silas’s gaze is distant, indifferent. "There’s nothing to stop," he says, almost like he’s talking to himself. He looks back down at his pen, but there’s that gleam again—too sharp, too controlled. His hand hovers just above the page, like he’s savoring every second before the ink finally spills.

Day seven, maybe eight. The gnawing never stops. It’s worse now. I feel it deep in my spine, burrowing through tissue, eating its way into my skull. My teeth—they’ve started to *shift*, too. I can’t bite down without feeling them crack, the pressure building behind my gums. I wonder if they’ll fall out. I wonder if they’ll split open like my nails.

Jason… he doesn’t move anymore. But I see it. His chest. It’s *moving.* No, not breathing—pulsing. Like something inside him is trying to escape. And me? My muscles twitch, my legs convulse, my hands jerk without command. The gnawing doesn’t hurt anymore, not really. It’s just… there. Constant. Familiar. I don’t fight it.

There’s a moment when the fight drains out of you. When you realize that it’s not just your body betraying you—it’s everything. Your thoughts, your will, even your sense of time… all slipping through your fingers. The gnawing isn’t something I can stop because it’s already finished. What I was? Gone. And the worst part? It’s not even pain anymore. It’s just… *change.*

I stand in front of the mirror, or at least I think it’s me in there. The thing in the glass looks back with hollow eyes, nails curling into grotesque hooks. Is this what I am now? Or is it what I’ve always been, slowly emerging from beneath the skin? The hum in the walls feels closer, pressing in on me, wrapping around my bones. I don’t fight anymore. There’s nothing left to resist.

Jason’s body twitches in the corner. His chest, still pulsing. I wonder if he’s still in there, screaming somewhere deep inside his own skull, buried under the same gnawing that’s eating away at me. But even if he is—there’s no getting out. Not from this.

Silas’s eyes gleam again, his pen scratching the paper like it’s mimicking the *scratching inside me*. And I understand now. There never were rats. There never needed to be.

The real monster? It’s in all of us.

Always has been.
