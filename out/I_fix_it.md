It all began when I was nine years old. Me and my brother just came home from school when suddenly our mom was crying in the kitchen. My dad had committed suicide. The pain in my hart was indescribable. That was until I woke up. I was in my bed still with the tears in my eyes, same clothes on. Just a day earlier. I ran downstairs and there he was! Still smiling. I hugged my dad like it was the last day on earth. Literally.

For the past 10 years I've been waking up after something bad happends. When dad tried again, and again... and again... When my brother had a car accident. When my boyfriend cheated on me. When my hamster Timmy died. When I broke my arm. When my mother was crying again. Everytime, I just fix it! There was nothing bad about that, right? Right?

At least I believed it until a week ago. It was just a normal thursday. As always I got off work, got some groceries went home and started cooking. It was only until dinner that I started to notice things that weren't prefect. Everbody was so quiet. Not like my normal perfect life. There also was this smell... The worst smell imaginable. Like 50 dead rats had been rotting in the house. I seemed to be the only one noticing so I ignored it. We started eating like always. Just in quiet. Until my dad whispered something. I couldn't hear it at first but he kept going on. After a while I heard him. "Let, us, die" on repeat. It felt like a nightmare. I woke up. I ALWAYS, wake up. I fix it!


A week had past and there were no issues. Just a perfect day again. Went to school, got to work and after went to my boyfriend Erik. We were just hanging out but that's where it started to get weird. He asked me if I could cheat death, would I? I explained that I definetly would. "Why not?" I asked. "You could save everyone and everything you love." He did not agree. He actually, got super angry. But not just angry.. His eyes were all black and his screams had echo's. Screaming again, "Let, us, die". So I did the only logical thing. I fixed it.

This was starting to get creepy. Nothing so repeating like this has ever happend. This day was finally a normal one. Not perfect, but normal at least. All the family foto's all turned white. But everything else was ok. We were happy again. Just a normal day. No voices, no cries.. Just happines. 

I woke up to my dad standing right in front of me. He looked angry so I asked what was going on. "Come with me to the backyard." He said. I was confused, but I went with him anyway. Nothing to bad could be going on. I was wrong. Everyone I had ever saved was there. Hanging from the trees. But still alive. There were 2 empty ropes. "For us." he said. All saying together, "Let, us, die. Let, us, die." I woke up. I FIXED it.

I woke up with tears in my eyes. This didn't happen for a long time. But it did. I decide when they die! That's why I got these powers. I decide! I ran downstairs and there was no one. I searched the house with my hart beating so hard. But it was ok. They were just sitting at the kitchen table having dinner. I quickly joined them. I didn't even mind the blood in there eyes this time. I was just happy I could have a perfect dinner again.

Normally when there eyes would bleed I'd need to stab them right in between their eyes, wake up and it would stop. So I did. We were done eating and I picked up my knife. Saving them one by one. And boom. Wake up. I walked down stairs but they.. were still bleeding. Oddly enough, as long as they were alive, I didn't care. I could hear them whisper it to me sometimes. "Let, us, die." I didn't care. They're just a little confused. That's all. 

I woke up to again, something strange. More stuff began to dissapear. Not just the family foto's. The side walk, walls, doors. Just all white. I accepted that, as long as they live, my life is perfect. 

Next day more and more things began to dissapear. I'm scared to go outside becouse of it. Waking up doesn't fix it. It also appears that the eyes are not the only thing bleeding on my family. Everything is. But they're happy. So it's alright! I fix it!

Help! Help! Help! I have locked myself into my closet. Dad is trying to kill me. It's been four days and I can't wake up anymore. I need help! I can't fix this!

It's been 8 days. The white walls say they can help me if I give them something. Daddy has been quiet. 

There is blood on the walls. The door is now white. I haven't heard daddy in weeks. But I'm to scared to come out. My life is perfect in the closet. I fixed it.

My name is Docter Henderson. What you just read was the journal of one of our patients Ellie. She's been with us for the past five years, since she was nine. Her family died in a horrible house fire and ever since she's been here in the clinic. Or at least phisically hear. Her mind has been.. somewhere else ever since. This is the stuff she is writing usually. She doesn't talk to anyone but herself and her.. thoughts. I wanted to share her story here.
