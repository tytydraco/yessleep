I wasn’t the only person to call it quits after the visit from Antonio Garibaldi. Right after he had left to attend to whatever had happened to his circus tent, every member of the kitchen staff up and left. I would not blame them after what they had been made to cook. Unlike me though, they didn’t bother putting in their two weeks. They were up and gone as fast as they could. And because they didn’t do the proper thing when they quit, Sinclair made it so they would not be hired by any restaurant in all of New England. A couple of the poor bastards came crawling back with a much-reduced paycheck. 

I, on the other hand, was resolute about my quitting. And since I was making it plain that I was quitting, my already low effort plummeted even further as I went through the motions of someone who’s already quit and is just here to earn the last bit of tips and paycheck. No matter how hard he tried, Harold could not convince me to stay. He offered me better hours and more pay, even a month of paid vacation, but after seeing that thing in the stew pot, I had already made up my mind. 

It was the beginning of the last week I was to work at St. Mihel when I saw the car of my dreams again. The 1957 Chevy Bel Air came tearing up the driveway as I was on my third smoke break of the day. The cigarette fell out of my mouth when I saw it again, and a sudden flash of heat came over my face as I quickly stomped on the cigarette to put it out. I fixed my hair and uniform as quickly as I could, to go down and meet the occupant of my dream car. 

“Theodore! It’s so good to see you again,” Dr. James Harrison’s soft-spoken voice told me as he exited the car and closed the door behind him. His perfect face and big green eyes seemed even more perfect than the last time I had seen him with Sinclair’s group of friends. I found the words hard to get out of my throat but finally managed to squeak out a few words. 

“W-well this will probably be the last time. Quitting at the end of the week,” I told him, with a voice that squeaked and begged me to drench it with some water. Dr. Harrison looked almost offended when I told him that I was going to up and quit on him. Even if he didn’t exactly own this place. 

“Well, I better get you all to myself then.” He winked at me and threw his arms around me. He was still wearing his scrubs and lab coat, but at least this time these items of clothing were clean of any visible bodily fluids. “Come on, you can help coach me on my golf swing.” He told me as he dragged me inside the lobby. Despite being so close to the most good-looking man I’d ever seen I still couldn’t help but roll my eyes at the mention of golf. 

Don’t get me wrong, I like to golf as much as the next white guy. But having to coach so many rich guys day in and day out really wears down your enjoyment of something you enjoy. I closed my eyes and felt a slight pounding at my temples like I was about to get a great big migraine over this. I got a set of golf clubs for Dr. Harrison and loaded them into the cart and getting into the driver’s seat I waited for Dr. Harrison while he went and changed out of his work clothes. Drumming my fingers on the steering wheel I went over what I was going to do for a job now. Literally, anything would be better than doing this. And I hopefully wouldn’t be blacklisted from any of the jobs that I had lined up. 

Before that line of thought went any further, I was startled by Dr. Harrison sitting down in the passenger seat. Looking over at him I quickly snapped my head back to look straight ahead. He was wearing the typical polo shirt and the golf pants that most of our patrons wear, but god fucking damn it did he look so hot in them. 

“How about a little wager, Theodore,” he said with a perfect smile on his face as I started up the engine and began driving us over to the first hole. Doing my best to just try and act somewhat normal. 

“Ted is fine, Dr. Harrison,” I told him, being the most robotic I had ever been in my years of being alive. 

“Well, Ted,” he said, nearly melting my heart at the mention of my name. “If I beat you in a game of golf, then you continue working here,” he said with a perfect smile. I stared at him for a moment as I continued to drive the cart. I shook my head and stared straight ahead. 

“You couldn’t offer me anything that would make me stay here,” I told him. Not letting his stupid perfect face get to me. I gripped the steering wheel as we, at last, approached the first hole. 

“What about my Chevy Bel Air?” he asked me as I parked the golf cart. I stared at him like he was insane. He wanted me to stay here so badly that he was willing to wager his car for it? I looked into his beautiful green eyes. They seemed to sparkle like great big jewels. Staring at them felt like a safe place from all the shit I had been going through. It took every bit of mental strength I had to tear my eyes away from his. 

“T-that’s a tempting offer, b-but I’ve already made up my mind, Dr. Harrison,” I told him, quickly getting out of the cart and heading to the rear to get his golf clubs. Slinging them on my back I made my way back to the passenger side to begin helping Dr. Harrison. 

When I rounded the corner and locked eyes with him again, he seemed different. Not like slightly different, he seemed like a different person. He seemed pissed off and angry, and I could tell that he wanted to do something to me, but he closed his eyes and let out a long breath. His smile returned and he cleared his throat and followed me over to the first hole of the course. 

Dr. Harrison wasn’t the best golfer I’d ever seen, but he was at least better than a grand majority of our clients here. His swing was decent but his accuracy left much to be desired. I did my best to give him as many pointers as I could off the top of my head. But like I said I wasn’t much of a golfer either. 

“So tell me, Ted.” He was at the green and analyzing the slope he had to putt down. “Why exactly are you quitting?” He stood up from his analysis and carefully tapped the ball toward the hole. The ball stopped just short of the hole and I couldn’t help but wince at how close he had gotten. He grumbled a little but simply tapped the ball in and sighed. 

“Something happened when Mr. Garibaldi visited, and I just can’t work at a place like this,” I told him, taking the putter from him and placing it back in the bag. He nodded as he got into the passenger seat. Getting into the driver’s side I started up the cart again and made sure not to look Dr. Harrison in the eyes. 

“Ah, I assume he ordered from the special menu?” I nodded. “Yes, well he and Monsuier LeBlanc are the reason that menu exists. Be lucky it was only Antonio that you had to deal with,” he said with a smile. A hard shiver went through my spine at the mere mention of LeBlanc. Whatever he was, I didn’t want to end up like the members of staff that had the misfortune of crossing his path. 

“I can stomach a lot of shit. But when I looked into the pot after Mr. Garibaldi was finished was way too much even for me. So I’m getting the fuck out of here before anything happens to me,” I told him as we reached the second hole. “So you got a triple bogey on the first hole correct?” I asked him trying to change the subject. 

“I did, yes. I can’t believe a brave guy like you was scared off by Antonio of all people. I thought for sure you could handle him! He spoke so highly of you as well.” Harrison smiled as he took the driver I offered him. He teed up the ball and took the position to swing. 

“I appreciate the compliment, Dr. Harrison. But no offense, I’d rather work anywhere else than here.” He stopped mid-swing to look over at me. We locked eyes for a moment, my head throbbing as I stared into those perfect green eyes. Pulling away I cleared my throat to allow him to swing. 

He continued to stare at me and I felt like those green eyes were about to burn a hole through me. At long last he took position and swung the driver. Needless to say, it wasn’t a very good swing and he landed right into the rough. “Son of a fucking bitch,” he snarled angrily, quickly clearing his throat and sighing. 

“I think it’s best that you focus on the game instead of me, sir,” I told him as I took his driver and began to fix the damage to the grass that he had done with his subpar swing. He stood and watched me fix his damage. Standing up, I looked over at him and was very careful not to look into his eyes. “For this, I recommend the 9-iron. You want a lot of lift to get you out of the rough and back over to the green.” 

“Right. Right.” He nodded and followed me down to where his ball had landed. Handing him his 9-iron, I watched as he once again took position to swing it. Just before he went to swing it a ringtone went off. Dr. Harrison let out an almost animalistic growl as he dug in his pockets and put the phone to his ear. “I told you not to fucking call me-” He quickly looked over at me and cleared his throat again. “Er, sorry Maggie. N-not having the best of luck at the moment.” 

I had seen plenty of golf rage before. One time a banker who had come here to convince a client had literally broken his golf club against the golf cart in pure rage at losing the match and the client. But something about Dr. Harrison’s rage seemed different. It was like he wasn’t mad at the game, but something else. 

“Yea? Yes. That’s fine. I don’t care. Sure that works as well. Uh-huh. Have Rachel handle it. Yes, whatever, don’t call me again.” He finally put his phone back and looked back over to me with the most forced smile I’d ever seen. “My receptionist had some ‘urgent’ questions she needed to be handled.” He finally got back to his golf swing and actually got a good hit. The second hole was completed with only a bogey this time. 

We both filed back into the golf cart and I could tell that Dr. Harrison was getting irritated by something. It seemed like it was all just building on top of him. Fishing around the center console of the golf cart I pulled out a cigar and offered it to him, thinking that maybe a smoke would calm him down for a bit. He took one look at the cigar and grabbed it before chucking it as hard as he could out of the cart. 

“Those things damage your skin,” he told me, bringing up his hand to his cheek and giving it a few scratches. I pursed my lips at this and simply shrugged as I kept driving us toward the third hole. “Common, Ted. There has to be something I can do for you to get you to keep working here. How bout a free consultation?” He offered me, his once genuine smile replaced with a forced one. 

“I already told you, there’s nothing on this planet that could convince me to stay here,” I told him, getting his golf clubs out from the back and handing him the driver. In doing so we locked eyes again and that throbbing in my head returned. “W-well maybe…I do need some work on getting rid of my acne scars.” I found myself thinking, staring at his eyes the idea seemed to grow on me the more I stared at him. 

“Certainly. Your skin may be damaged but I can fix that. All you have to do is continue to work here. After all, it isn’t so bad here, right?” he told me. His voice echoed in my head like it was a cave. I’d always been so self-conscience about my acne scars. Wait, no I hadn’t. I could give a rat's ass about how I looked. 

“No. No, I’m fine with it,” I told him, shaking my head and groaning at how hard it hurt all of a sudden. I once again attempted to hand him the driver this time not even bothering to look at him in the eyes. He swiped the item from me and walked silently over to the tee box. I rubbed my temples with my thumbs as I waited for him to take his swing so I could see where it landed without having to look at him. 

“Ted,” he suddenly told me, his voice reverberating in my head like a gong. “Look at me,” he told me, I did my best to try and ignore him, but it was a mantra that continued over and over until it was so loud I just had to look over at him to make it stop. “You’re going to keep working here. No matter what else happens here. You will still work here,” he told me, a scowl across his face as he gripped his driver as hard as he could. 

“N-no. Fuck that, I’m leaving this place and never looking back,” I told him, yanking my gaze away from him and groaning loudly at just how badly my head hurt. I was so focused on my aching head that I didn’t notice or hear him approach me and grab my whole face with his hand and forced me to look at him. 

“Listen you ugly piece of fucking shit. You're going to do what I tell you to do. Do I make myself, clear?” His gaze was as intense as an inferno and he was pissed right the fuck off with me. I struggled to get him off of me trying to keep my eyes closed and thinking what I could do to get him off of me. Fishing in my pocket for anything, my hands brushed against the divot tool I’d used to fix the hole he’d made with his first swing. 

Pulling the tool out I stuck it in his cheek as hard as I could and pushed him away quickly as he recoiled in pain. He stared at the object in his skin at the peripheries of his vision and then stared back at me. 

“You piece of filth! Do you have any idea how long it’s going to take me to fix this?!” he shouted at me, raising the driver and trying to bash my skull in with it. Dodging his attack, I threw the whole golf bag at him and quickly got into the cart, and started it up. Putting that shit in reverse, I left him on the course flinging every insult known to man at me. 

Arriving back at the parking lot for the golf carts, I left it on not even giving a shit, and stormed right through the lobby and headed up towards Harold’s office. Barging in and not even bothering to knock I caught him right in the middle of some paperwork. 

“I quit. I’m done. Bye.” And I promptly turned around and started right for the main entrance. Harold quickly followed after me and began to beg me not to leave. But I was fucking done, I didn’t even care about earning one last paycheck from this cursed fucking place. I walked out from the lobby only to be met with Dr. Harrison standing there panting. 

“You fucking asshole,” he hissed. The stab wound in his cheek looked worse than what I had initially given him. His skin was hanging off in chunks and looked like a hanging wrapper off of a candy bar. He scared the shit out of me and forced me backward into Harold who was rushing after me. Harrison closed the gap between the two of us and grabbed me by the throat. 

“L-let go of me!” I gagged as he began to squeeze my throat tightly. I looked down at him and saw the pure rage and anger in his big green beautiful eyes. How could I have damaged the beautiful skin that he possessed? I watched as he grabbed the loose flap of skin with his other hand and began to tear off the skin that covered his face. I watched as his beautiful skin gave way to another layer of skin beneath it that was heavily damaged and covered in scars. 

“If Mr. Sinclair didn’t want you alive I would skin you right on these fucking steps.” He pulled me mere inches from his face as he forced me to look into those still beautiful sparkling eyes. “You’ve caused me such a headache today. So you’re going to stay here and continue to work. Correct?” he told me, his gaze as intense as a forest fire. 

“M-Mr. Harrison, I-I don’t think this is the right way to do this.” Harold tried to tell him, grabbing him by the arm to try and get it off of my throat. Reaching into his pocket, Dr. Harrison pulled out the golf divot tool and plunged it right into Harold’s throat. 

“That’s enough out of you, Harold,” Dr. Harrison told him, as Harold fell to the floor and clutched his throat in a vain attempt to stop the bleeding. “Serves you right for touching me you disgusting piece of shit.” He spat at Harold as he lay bleeding out on the steps. Turning his attention back to me, Harrison continued his gaze at me. “You’re going to keep working here. And no matter what happens you will never once think of quitting. You understand, don’t you?” 

No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t pull my gaze away from his. And his words echoed in my head like a mantra that was repeated over and over again. At last, I nodded in understanding and he finally let go of me and allowed me to breathe again. Turning over to Harold, Dr. Harrison bent over and looked him over. 

“He’ll have to do until I can find better skin. Help me load him into my car, Ted.” I wordlessly obeyed. After all, it was an honor to be helping someone as beautiful as Dr. James Harrison. I dragged Harold’s body over to the trunk of Dr. Harrison’s Chevy Bel Air. I closed the lid on Harold and walked back over to the driver's side of the convertible. 

“I-I’m sorry about damaging your face, Dr. Harrison.” I apologized to him, having a hard time looking at his heavily damaged and scarred face. He was missing one of his ears and most of his lovely brown hair was gone. 

“It’s fine. I’m just glad you finally saw reason. Now, you’re going to have to call Mr. Sinclair about needing a new manager. Tell him it was my fault. I wouldn’t wanna ruin that perfect record that you have.” He chuckled at me and started the car up. He rolled away and left me standing there with an excruciating headache. Looking down at the trail of blood, I groaned at no doubt having to wash it. 

Making my way up to Harold’s office, I picked up his landline phone and dialed the number I found on his desk for Sinclair. I waited as the tone dialed and sighed as I just wanted to go home and go look for a new job. Or…go home and wait for my next shift here. Yeah, that’s what I was thinking at the time. 

“What do you want Harold? I told you not to call me on this line.” Sinclair’s stern and annoyed voice came over the line. On the other side, I also heard some sort of struggle going on. But I didn’t exactly know or care what was happening. 

“No, sir. This is Theodore Fairfax,” I told him. And it obviously took him a moment to remember who I was. 

“Ah, yes. What is it?” he asked me, whatever struggle was going on over the line was now cut short. 

“Uhm, Dr. Harrison killed Harold. And we need a new manager now.” He groaned audibly and I could already tell that he was rubbing his eyes. He was silent for a few more seconds before he cleared his throat. 

“Thanks for telling me, Theodore. I’ll have someone for you at the end of the week. Just handle whatever comes up until then.” And without waiting for my response he hung up and left me standing there in Harold's office. I decided to just go home and worry about everything tomorrow. I might be stuck working there but at the very least I don’t have to worry about any of Sinclair’s other freaky friends from visiting. And hopefully, maybe, Dr. Harrison will come for another visit.
