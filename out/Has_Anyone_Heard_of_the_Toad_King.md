I work at a national state park, and we've recently had a string of incidents that all started after my crew and I saw 3 toads. We were cleaning out a campsite when my coworker, T, found three cute little toads under a pile of wood. We moved the little creatures, and we thought that was that. On our way back to the maintenance shop that day, our cart's belt blew out. Of course, there could be a million reasons, but we decided to blame the 3 toads we encountered, calling them a sign of bad things to come. If we only knew how right we were going to be.

The next thing to happen after seeing 3 toads was a jump from a blown belt. T and I were cleaning out a bathroom when we saw 3 of those little bastards in it. We moved them with the broom and finished up our morning routine. That's when the bad things started to come. Over the radio, we heard "...missing boy, last seen running from concessions...". The entire maintenance department went right to looking, and unfortunately, we never did find him. The search lasted about 2 weeks before the state came to the conclusion he had fallen off one of the cliffs into the water and drowned. Most of us accepted this as it seemed the most realistic, as we did have quite a few cliffs that dropped off into the lake, the park was known for. I say most of us, as there was one worker who has been there for quite a while, said "It was that goddamn Toad King. That's where that boy went." one day at lunch. Now I'm one for the supernatural and cryptozoology but that just sounded silly. I brushed it off and went on with my day and so did everyone else.

The next incident came, and they came fast. One crew would come in and say they found 3 toads at shelter 2, or 3 toads were hanging around their carts after lunch. Now, for my animal lovers, this is where you should stop reading. Those same crews would respond to a call about an animal's body being found strung about in the trees or on the beach. This had never happened before, and we couldn't figure out anything these incidents had in common besides the three toads. That's when I approached the old man, who said something about the "Toad King". "J, what is the Toad King? You mentioned it when that little boy went missing." "The Toad King is the protector of the town of ----. He has haunted this state park since the state itself decided to drown the town of -----, so the city down the road had water running to it." 

After that conversation, I was left with a few unanswered questions, but there was a storm on the horizon. 3 coworkers had been attacked by what I assume is the creature known as the "Toad King". Z was the first. He had come to me after he cleaned the beach house and told me the following. "Hey, P, I have a question. Are the 3 toads being bad omens a thing?" I told him I didn't know and that the new hires believed it, but I told him I didn't think it had too much weight to it. We worked in a state park, and they aren't exactly known for being the most normal places. Bad things happen all over the world; we just got unlucky and were dealing with a lot. He simply nodded his head and went off to clean up some campsites. A couple of hours later, we found his cart with no sign of him being around. After that, the feds got involved and started monitoring our park 24/7 and made, at the very least, a 2-man team mandatory.

The next attack happened with a coworker who worked a lot in a 3-man group. I don't know how many state parks follow a grid pattern, but we are supposed to split up but be within earshot of each other when clearing out the woods. Almost like a 3x3 box, with each passing 3 boxes. Anyways, this group is clearing out the woods, and the one who is attacked is nowhere to be found when they meet the end of their boxes. The other 2 go off looking in the woods, screaming for their friend, but with no luck or sign of him in sight. By the time most of the maintenance crew arrives to help with the search, the feds and S&R teams are leaving with no signs of going back in to look for our lost crewmate. Nobody asked, but I heard through the grapevine that the group had run into 3 toads during the morning shift.

Now I had mentioned 3 coworkers getting attacked and have only gone over 2. The third person who was attacked survived and is currently in a mental institution. I took this attack personally as this was one of my members of the 3-man team that T and I started. A was a new addition after the rules were implemented, and he fit right in. When we encountered those damn toads, I knew shit was going to hit the fan but I didn't think any of us would get attacked. We had gotten slammed with assignments during the day, so we were cleaning out campsites when it was dark out. We arrived to the site that started all of this, T would point this out later on and found 3 toads just sitting there. Like they were waiting for us. 

I passed out, and T said he heard something to the right of us. Leaving A with my body alone. When T came back, A was screaming in the water, fighting with something, and that's when T ran into the water to help our crewmate out. They made it, but A was left with severe mental scars. He tried committing while he was in the hospital. He kept screaming about the things it showed him. I always told myself I would make sure everyone comes home before we clock out. I can't help but feel like I failed. All of them, not just A. The supervisors don't acknowledge anything, the suits have left, and we don't get many campers. If we do it's just because any other park around is booked and they're looking for a quick night's rest.

As for why I'm posting this, it's how all of this started. We're closing soon, permanently or just for the season, I don't know. I've been camping at sites by the water in hopes of recreating the first time we encountered its callsign. And wouldn't you know it, while I was cleaning out the bathroom, three toads were hopping around. It's 9:03 pm, and I see movement in the water. It's just me, my father's revolver, and whatever lurks below the depths. This is a warning. The state parks are not safe. And neither am I.
