I think there's something wrong with my dog.  
  
Maybe I should introduce myself before getting into it. My name's Greg, I'm 32 years old, and a published author. I'm single, don't have kids, and live alone, with the exception of my Belgian Malinois Carver. I'm pretty athletic and healthy, living a very active lifestyle, spending the majority of my time when I'm not writing out hiking in the mountains with Carver in tow, fishing, biking, going to the gym, etc.  
  
About a week ago, I was hiking in the Avalanche Lake area in my home state of Montana, when something odd happened.  
  
I had let Carver off the leash to run wild and explore, but after losing track of him for a bit, I started calling out his name and looking for him in the tree line. I heard him bark in response, and upon making my way to him, I could see what he had found.  
  
What kind of looked like a 3 foot tall boulder sat on the ground before him, though it's dark gray exterior looked oddly fleshy, and it was cracked open at the top, with slimey green ooze running down its side.  
  
Carver sniffed the green ooze, staring at it intently, and then began licking it up.  
  
"Hey, leave it," I called out to him, stepping closer and reaching out to grab him.  
  
He turned and snapped, biting my outstretched hand and sinking his teeth briefly into my flesh before pulling back.  
  
"What the fuck!?" I snapped in pain. He had never bitten anyone before or shown any aggression, except for during his training classes where he was learning how to defend against intruders or attackers, and was supposed to be aggressive in that moment.  
  
He turned back to licking at the ooze without hesitation, and I reached out again with a now bloody hand, grabbing him by the collar, yanking him back, and clipping his leash back to it.  
  
He whined and fought against me, yanking at the leash as he desperately tried to go back to licking the ooze, something he had also never done before due to his intense training as a puppy. It took quite a bit of strength to pull him away, and I decided to end the day early, immediately hiking back to the car and dragging Carver along behind me.  
  
All night after we got home, he would just stand at the front door, staring past it, and whining, and I could only help but imagine he was desperate to get back to the ooze. He would even refuse to eat or drink water, and wouldn't come to his dog bed in the bedroom when I went to sleep like he does every night.  
  
When I woke up the next day, he was acting pretty normal and had clearly slept on his bed in the living room, but everytime I'd try to go near him, he'd back away and either whine like he was in fear, or bark aggressively if I pushed the issue and got too close.  
  
He would normally sit right next to me and watch as I poured his food, immediately digging in once I was done, but now to get food or water, he waits until I'm several feet away and he keeps one eye on me at all times.  
  
I keep catching him hiding from me, watching me from around corners or from under my bed, not wanting anything to do with me, and acting like he's afraid of me.  
  
I called the vet and told her about his weird behavior and what had happened in the mountains, leaving out the fact that he bit me out of fear of them reporting him or something, and she told me to bring him in for a check up.  
  
Everytime I'd try to leash him up to take him, however, he would run away from me, or even get aggressive to the point I'd worry he was going to attack me.  
  
I ended up paying the expensive fee to have a house call vet come over to check on him instead, and although he still acted strange towards me, he was nothing but friendly to the vet, and after the check up, the vet told me everything seemed fine, but noted that he was treating me like how he would someone that consistently abused him.  
  
I took some offense to that, as I've never even hit him once and never would, he's my best friend, I love him and take great care of him. But I understood where the vet was coming from.  
  
The vet told me I should try to get a sample of the ooze he consumed to have it tested, but other than that, he didn't really know what else could be done.  
  
He did note the white bandage wrapped around my right hand and the bit of blood staining it, and asked me if he bit me, but I lied, worried that he would try to have him put down or something if I admitted it, and instead said I had cut it while doing some work around the house.  
  
I went back to the mountains the next day, leaving Carver at home this time, but when I made my way to the area we had found the boulder at, it and any evidence of it being there besides the small crater in the ground were gone.  
  
I did notice, however, that there was a small military presence in the area that was not there before, but rather than let my mind race with conspiracy theories, I just decided that they were there conducting training exercises of some sort.  
  
Returning home, Carver growled at me as if I were an intruder upon entering my own house.  
  
I removed the bandaging wrapped around my hand after a few days, seeing that the area around the bite is starting to turn a greenish gray hue, and that the teeth punctures are refusing to heal.  
  
I went to the doctors about it, and they gave me some antibiotic cream and pills, and treated the wound the best they could. They said that they don't know what sort of infection I have, and that it's not gangrene or anything like that, but some sort of weird skin reaction my body is having, telling me that the antibiotics should take care of it.  
  
They asked what bit me and I told them that it was a stray dog. They insisted on me getting rabies shots, and I conceded to getting them, even though I know Carver is not rabid. The shots have added another level of discomfort as well, causing me to feel very ill and have terrible nightmares.  
  
The wound hasn't begun improving yet, and the green-gray flesh has even began to peel off in patches, leaving behind the bloody and exposed flesh beneath.  
  
Carver's behavior has not only not improved, but has continued to worsen.  
  
I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm losing my best friend and I don't know why this is happening. It's starting to seriously scare me. I'm afraid of my own dog and what is happening to him.  
  
I think there's something seriously wrong with my dog.  
  
Can anyone give any advice that could help?
