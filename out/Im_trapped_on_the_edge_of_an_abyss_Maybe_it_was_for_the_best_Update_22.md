I could barely keep up with Hope as she lumbered down the hallway, her mutated, boney hand clamped over mine. My one leg I was using to support myself certainly wasn’t enough to fight back her new, goliath form into slowing her pace either. All I could do was hop along and hope I didn’t fall, lest I let out a yelp and invoke whatever demon I’d awoken moments ago.

Finally, it became too much to bear, and though I knew I ran the risk of her trying to ‘help’ me again, I had to speak up. I did so gently and with caution, “H-Hope, can we slow down a bit? My leg—it’s hurt too. I broke my arm and leg.”

She turned back to me, thankfully acquiescing to my request. She looked me up and down, and for a moment I was worried that she might try to lay her hands on the wound, but thankfully, she just leaned her gaunt face close.

“Oh my g-goodness! June, what did you d-do? What happened out there?” Her eyes turned back up to me, her figure nearly down on all fours. The way they felt like a predator’s scared me. The question she followed up with scared me even more, “Where is Hensley?”

It scared me because I didn’t know how to answer. I looked up at the ceiling, noting more cameras in this wing, and knew that this time, I was absolutely being watched. After closing the door, Ann wouldn’t be able to resist spying on my first few moments to make sure I survived, especially since she’d be near the control room. I couldn’t blow my cover so soon, and on top of that, there was no telling what Hope might do if I ‘rocked the boat’ on her.

If I told her that I *was* Hensley, I’d have to explain what happened to the real June, and I had a feeling that would go even worse.

“She and I got separated,” I told her, “There was a creature that made it onto the shelf after we finally made it out of the hospital, and she ran off to distract it while I got to the door.”

I saw her smile begin to fade, and her pupils begin to shift, so I quickly put on damage control.

“S-She’s got to still be out there. She’s always made it back so far, right?”

It seemed to stop her progress of rage, but something was clearly bothering her. She made it known in a low growl, “She always does that… w-why does she keep trying to get herself killed… We have p-people back home who need us!”

She was heating up again, so I worked at my sweetest voice and placed a hand on her jagged shoulder, “H-Hey, I don’t think it’s like that, Hope. She just wants us to make it home too—she cares about us.”

I saw the fire in her eyes fizzle out, and she turned her eyes back to mine, a blank, analyzing stare shooting through me. With a plain, cold tone, she spoke two words that cut me to my core.

“Does she?”

It wasn’t a genuine question. It was almost rhetorical. Like she was shocked I would even think that. What shook me the most was the lack of beast in her voice. It sounded more akin to a rattled, tire Hope.

I didn’t even know how to respond. I’d said the words so many times to her since we’d been here that I never stopped to wonder if I’d actually filled them with meaning. How was it possible that she thought I wouldn’t care about her? I’d made it clear several times that, out of all the fragments of myself, she was the dearest to me.

I didn’t have time to ponder it any further. Like before, Hope’s clarity quickly faded, she turned back down the corridor, and a hand slipped into mine to bring me with her.

It was strange watching her; especially seeing the flips in her persona. What she said to me in her last bout of clarity turned over and over like a bad melody in my mind.

‘*There’s something in my head, but it's not me.’*

I couldn’t help but call back to Hen 5, the way that her feral-ness had consumed her until the moment I shocked her clarity back out with a bottle to the neck. I looked at Hope as she guided me and shivered at the thought. Even if I was in any shape to do that all again, I didn’t think I was capable of it.

Something in her smile made me feel sick. It was so familiar—actually *hers,* not whatever was currently piloting her. She was corrupted, undoubtedly, but she was still in there.

I hated seeing her like this. It reminded me too much of Mom in her final days. The more her body shut down, the more she became an entirely different person until the real her became the minority in her own body. Just glimpses of someone I loved under a hardening shell of a stranger.

Hope wasn’t Mom, though, and she wasn’t dying just yet. There had to be a way to get her out. To draw that clarity back for good. I wasn’t leaving this place until I figured it out, which meant Ann wasn’t either.

Hope continued to lead me down the hallway until she stopped at an open room to our left. The lights were off inside, and when we stepped in, I was hit with a sour odor. Rot and what I could only assume to be old food was the culprit, and as Hope moved inside, I saw I was correct. Christmas lights were stuck to the perimeter of the ceiling, held by stick on hooks, and they illuminated the scene.

It was another apartment like the one I’d found Ann in, but this one was still mostly intact. There were dishes hanging from racks in the kitchen and pictures on nightstands of friends and family. I could see stuffed animals on the floor that had been tossed off the bed, which I found funny, as well as the numerous posters on the wall of colorful cartoon animals and characters.

Whatever scientist had this room was not the kind of person I’d expect coming to the Abyss. Then again, when they signed on, perhaps they didn’t know what they were getting themselves into…

“This is where I’ve been sleeping!” Hope informed me, finally letting my hand go so she could roam around the space, “Eating too! Isn’t it so n-nice?”

“Yeah, it sure is something…” I offered, looking around. I finally saw the source of the smell over by the bed. The sheets were covered in blood and black gunk, and on the nightstand next to it were a couple cans of soup that were opened and half eaten.

“Hope, you’ve been *sleeping* here?” I pointed, unable to hide the concern in my tone.

She looked to the bed, then ran and leaped onto it, causing the springs in the mattress to squeal in protest, “Yeah! I-It’s not so bad! I know it’s a little messy, but that’s only because it’s where Ann helped me when I was hurt! I got a little blood on the sheets.”

Stepping a little closer, I noticed a few other things by the mattress. A first aid kit with its contents strewn about, as well as wadded gauze and towels covered in the same ichor all over Hope.

“It doesn’t look like she did a very good job of taking care of you…” I muttered.

Hope still heard me and shook her head, “N-No! She did! I c-couldn’t move for a while—I felt really sleepy. I remember her crying a whole bunch and a lot of stinging on my head.”

Hope's eyes went distant as she recalled the scene, and her hand glided to her head to touch the wound she was referring to. When she made contact, the pain jarred her back to reality, and she continued with a smile once more.

“I was o-okay though, and the band-dages she put on me made me itchy, so I took them off. She also t-tried to make me eat that yucky soup,” Hope told me, pointing to the cans and going blank once more, “It was n-nice, but I couldn’t breathe too well, and I got angry when I choked.”

She slipped off the bed, then moved to a spot on the other side of the nightstand. I hadn’t noticed it at first, but there was a tall, skinny shelf with belongings on the surrounding floor, as if they’d all been knocked off.

“I think I hurt her, and she stopped feeding me after that…”

My hair slowly stood on end at the vacancy in her words.

Like a rubber band, she shot back up with a smirk and cocked her head, “That’s okay though, cause she had work to do to get us out of here! I w-wanted to help, but she t-told me that since I’m sick, the monsters might be drawn to me, so I should s-stay hidden here.”

“That makes sense,” I lied with a smile.

I suddenly felt a little guilty about Ann. I had given her a lot of flak for not properly taking care of Hope, but I really hadn’t known just how bad the damage was. What could she have possibly done to save her from the venom of a place that not even the scientists studying it knew what it was? On top of that, instead of immediately ditching her for the drill, she’d actually tried to nurse our better half back to health for at least the better part of yesterday before Hope snapped at her.

I wasn’t about to give her an apology, but it helped ease my frustration just a little more.

Wanting to see the scene a little better to know if I’d missed any clues, I reached over to the switch beside me and flicked it on, jolting the bulbs above to life.

This turned out to be a big mistake.

Hope let out a scream and fell to the floor, burying her face in the rug and thrashing her body as if she was in pain.

“No! No light! Turn it off!!”

I instantly flicked the switch back off, nearly toppling over in my fearful scramble. Hope thrashed for a bit longer before her screams subsided into gentle panting, and she raised her head to me.

“Too bright…” She growled.

I put my hands up, “R-Right—I’m so sorry, Hope, I didn’t realize it would hurt you. I won’t do that again—I promise.”

The monster that had consumed my friend stared at me with her beady eyes for a long beat, almost trying to decide whether she could believe my words or not. Thankfully, she gave one last huff, then as if she’d forgotten the situation entirely, looked out the door and took off, grabbing my hand as she passed.

“Come on! There’s m-more to show you!”

It was another game of catch-up as I tried to hop behind Hope, her already forgetting about my earlier request. Her excitement seemed unprecedented toward the cold, brutalist compound, but the more she started to show me things, the more I realized that the people of Kingfisher really did have it made down here.

There was everything anyone would need for an extended period away from home just in this one wing alone. A gym full of machines and weights, a media room with a massive theater screen and rows of seats, several lounges and fake plants designed to mimic an outdoor space back in the real world. Hope didn’t take me in that last one, however, as the daylight-mimicking light was too bright, and she didn’t know how to turn it off.

There was also a library, but it wasn’t that large. The shelves were the kind with a crank on the side that slid them along a rail to save space. It reminded me of the one on my old college campus, not that I visited often.

As we stopped in, using the glow from the entrance to look around, I noted some of the books on the shelves out of curiosity. Not many were for leisure; a lot looked to be academic books on topics that I knew nothing about. There was one set of leather-bound tomes sitting on a wooden bookcase that I noted as we turned to leave however; not because their titles were any clearer, but because they stood out from the rest.

They were sleek, shiny hardcovers of leather, their spines sporting gold trims. Their titles mentioned things like ‘*The Basin*’ and ‘*The nature of Roots’*, all terms that I remembered Shae using in his logs—their nicknames for the abyss. The tomes looked old, so it was clear they weren’t new research, but something else stood out to me about them.

Near the bottom of the spine, there was a crest on each book. Most of them mentioning things relating to the abyss had the kingfisher logo, but there were different ones too. A wolf, a marlin, a stag with massive antlers. I couldn’t even make all of them out in the dim light bleeding in, but I didn’t have to for it to make my stomach churn at the implications.

Kingfisher was not the only compound these people were operating in, and there was no telling just how many more there were.

I suppose it made sense. The amount of money needed for what these people accomplished would be immense. There was no way it was a small operation. Still, it made me feel small. Was this our own government funding this? Or were these people operating on their own interests?

I didn’t dwell on it too much. Ultimately, I didn’t care. Even if I got out of here, I wouldn’t be able to stop it, and that wasn’t my goal anyway. I just wanted to go home. To get out of here and never think about this place ever again. Odds are if this place failed so miserably, these people would be ruined anyway.

That being said, I still needed to be careful. With ties so widespread, my leaving from this place would put a target on my back for anyone who found out I knew their little secret.

Hope had concluded our little tour and was leading me back to the media room when I noticed something else she hadn’t pointed out yet. We were in the main circular hub with the chandelier above, sticking against the wall to minimize the light when we passed a little alcove. I turned to see a machine in the nook like a payphone, save for the phone itself.

It was just the box; a vintage-looking machine to match the other tech of this place. A screen read ‘*Provide ID for Access’* with a slot for a card and some buttons beneath it. From the bottom, cables dangled loosely a few inches, each a charging cable for a different type of cell phone. The sign above the machine made my heart stop.

*‘E.C.T’*

*‘External Communication Terminal.’*

I stopped so hard that for a moment, I was actually able to anchor Hope in place.

She let out a loose growl of surprise, then turned back to see what had stopped me. When she did, I spoke fast before she could return to her own musings.

“Hope, is this… is this what I think it is?”

My gangly clone shivered forward and reached a long arm out, strumming the chords beneath like they were guitar strings.

“I t-think it can call h-home, but we need the p-phone. Hensley h-has it.”

She was right. I did. It was currently burning a hole through the loose, baggy pocket that Ann hadn’t bothered to check, completely undetectable.

I felt my hand begin to struggle free from Hopes, lost in a trance as I stared at the machine. I was ready to dart into my pocket. To rip the cell out, jam in the cable, then produce my keycard so I could finally call home. So that I could contact the world and truly let them know I was alright. To hear Dad’s voice, then Trevor’s, and tell them both how sorry I was that I left them. That I’d simply vanished from the world over the last few months.

I stopped before I could do that, however. My fingers had barely made it out of Hope’s palm before I subtly slipped them back in.

I couldn’t yet. Not right now. There was a camera right above the terminal, and Ann would see everything. That I was Hensley, that I had the keycard, and that I was trying to warn home. I could tell them what’s going on, and that would blow her cover when she tried to take over my life.

Not to mention, Hope still had my hand viced, and she wasn’t going to leave my side. If I gave away that I had the phone, there was no telling what her unpredictable self would do, and if I actually made the call, that could end even worse. Dad and Trevor would hear two of my voices screaming into the mic, and either think it was a prank, or be so overwhelmed that it would haunt them forever should I die here. They’d spend forever wondering what horrible mystery befell me, and I couldn’t do that to them.

I wanted to call so badly. I felt like my broken limbs could be healed and my willpower would become unstoppable if I could just hear their voices one last time. On top of that, I was just scared. I had no idea what was going to happen here, and there was still such a high chance I might not make it out alive. It could be the last opportunity I ever had to say goodbye…

But that wasn’t for certain, and right now, if I wanted a better chance of it not being the case, my best course was to continue lying low. Keep my cards close until the perfect moment to play them.

My heart tugged as if it was attached to one of those cables as I turned and pulled Hope onward away from the thing, tears watering my eyes.

My focus needed to be on her right now anyway.

I still needed to fix her. To find a way of saving the only good thing that ever came out of me. I had no idea how I was going to do that, though. What was afflicting Hope was a poison unseen by man, and there was no way someone like me with no prior medical knowledge would have a way of fixing it. Hell, Ann *was* me, and even she couldn’t figure it out.

I looked at Hope and took her in, that crooked smile still on her lips. She led me into the dark theater, then plucked a remote near one of the chairs, clumsily fumbling with it till she got the screen on. It sprang to life, and she gave a harsh growl of disapproval, but after her eyes adjusted to the bright surface, she eased back, sitting in her chair as if she’d forgotten how to use one.

It was the perfect scene to spectate. The perfect image for what I was pondering. Hope trying to do something as mundane as turn on a TV and find something to watch.

I couldn’t take her back to the real world. There was no way she would last. Nobody there would be able to fix the disease in her brain, and worse, it might draw Kingfisher to us if doctors began asking questions. Even if I found a way, and even if she rejoined society, she’d be a monster. A barely functioning beast of a thing with a violent temper and the strength to back it. One stranger pisses her off, and she smashes them. One fight with Trevor, and…

I shivered and felt tears begin welling once more. Behind that smile and those unfamiliar eyes, I still saw her. It wasn’t fair. Why out of all people, did it have to be Hope? Why couldn’t it have been me? I was already the bi-polar rage beast that she was, just in human form. Why couldn’t Hope have been the one where I was sitting, so close to making it out?

She’d been so excited to make it home with me. She’d been the one constantly encouraging me that if we’d just pushed a little further, we’d make it out okay. She was the one with all of her namesake, and it was repaid to her so that she couldn’t leave.

I wanted to puke as she so innocently browsed the extensive catalogue of movies stored on the TV and picked one, folding her hands over her lap and rocking back and forth. It was like abandoning a child. Like putting down a dog who didn’t know any better than to bite the neighbor who’d startled it.

There was really no other way. I was going to have to either kill her like I had with Hensley 5, or…

Or…

I gnawed on my tongue as I recounted the scene I’d had with June earlier today. Her turning to dust in my arms like Hen 5 even though she was in perfectly fine shape. Killing that first clone had led me to believe that death was the only way to reabsorb the girls, but what if it wasn’t as harsh as that?

Sure, I had fatally wounded my depravity before she went, but she didn’t vanish immediately, did she? She only did after I embraced her.

The same way I had to June.

Suddenly, what had happened to my innocence didn’t make my heart ache anymore. The strange reabsorption into my being didn’t feel like a death. It felt like a necessary step. Like a metamorphosis from something I’d made into something it was supposed to be.

Back when I’d explained what happened to Hen 5 to June, I’d said that if we did the same to Ann, it wouldn’t technically be death. She’d still be living inside me. At the time, I don’t think I fully believed what I was saying. I think maybe I was just trying to lessen the blow.

Now though? The more I meditated on it, the more I truly believed it. It all lined up.

June didn’t fade because she was injured. June faded because I’d finally remembered why I needed her in the first place.

She wasn’t dead; she was just back where she belonged. I could hear her nagging at my conscience as I walked along with Ann in the halls moments ago, urging me to be merciful with her innocent nature. A fragment of myself found that I’d long left behind.

I’d become the very roots that pulled her out of me in the first place, drawing her back in.

If I could find a way to reach that level with Hope, then maybe I could bring her home after all. Maybe I could still save her…

“Isn’t this place incredible?” She prodded, waking me from my thoughts, “It h-has everything we’d ever need! E-Even if we don’t esc-cape, we’ll be okay. We can live h-here and be happy.”

“Oh, um, yeah,” I dismissed, trying to appease her. If I wanted my theory to work, however, I needed to dive deeper. Reach that vulnerable place I had with the others. “Hey, Hope? Earlier when we were talking about Hensley, you said that you didn’t know if she cared about us… You don’t believe that, do you?”

Hope’s gaze went glassy and emotionless, and she turned on me, her pupils dilating like I’d struck a nerve. I flinched internally, worried that the girl might snap again, but she just made a low growl and then spoke.

“Why doesn’t she love us, June?”

That question really took me aback. I hadn’t really thought about the concept of ‘loving’ my clones. We’d had much more important things to worry about, and the bond we shared was a much more complicated one than that of the average family member. Love? I mean, I *cared,* and that was a form of love at the end of the day, right?”

“What? Of course she loved you,” I told her, “She loved all of us.”

“Lies.” Hope barked violently, pounding her fist on the arm of her seat and causing the frame beneath to crack. She saw me flinch back as her eyes bored into me, then after holding the intense glare, she fell into a fit of laughter like I’d forget about it, “S-She hated us. We were in her remember? We were her.”

“Hope, we didn’t exist before this place.”

“Y-Yes we d-did, June. We always have. People just couldn’t s-see us.” She turned away coldly, “And Hensley hated us. At l-least most of us. A-Ann was too loud, and you were too w-weak. I don’t know who the other clone was going to be, but she prob-b-bably hated her too.”

I swallowed hard the sour taste coming from the lump in my throat. I wanted to deny what she was saying—that there was parts of myself that I did truly care for. The problem was, even though I could potentially deny it, there was no evidence in my favor.

I forced myself to ask the important question, “What about you? If she loved any of us, she at least loved you.”

Hope looked at me then smiled, letting out a laugh between nervous and angry, “Me? N-No, I think I was the worst for her.”

I furrowed my brow, “Hope, that’s not true—”

“She forgot me, June,” Hope whipped around, putting her face close to mine. She fell back in her chair with a wild laugh again, the emotions overwhelming her, then continued, “Not like she did to you t-though; she *buried* me. Nasty em-motions are easy to feel because they’re all around. Things are always bad, so it’s easier to expect them. B-But the good things—those are harder. Good memories remind you of what you lost. Good memories make you ache for things you can’t have. Good memories make you afraid that you might lose the things helping you make them.”

Hope rolled up and bared her teeth, looking at the floor. Her feral nature was once again taking hold, but behind her stare, I still saw her true self, grief and heartbreak welling in her eyes.

“Hensley buried me bec-cause she was afraid. Because she didn’t want to feel me anymore. It hurt her too much to love me, s-so it was easier to just forget.”

I was holding myself now; I didn’t even need to pretend to look like June in that moment. My heart felt weak as it thumped in my chest, pressure crushing it from all sides. Once again, I wanted to deny everything Hope was saying, but there was no way that I could.

It was like she said a moment ago, she was me at one point.

She may have come out our happiest self, but she still knew me inside and out. She knew why I went to the warehouse every night. She knew why I spent so many years drowning out any feeling other than a blissful numbness. She knew why I pushed Trevor away anytime I felt like our relationship might be getting a little too close to perfect.

I was afraid. I was afraid of anything good that might happen to me.

I was afraid of hope.

The thing that she knew best, though, that made every part of me ache with sharp, stinging nerves, was what she finished her thoughts with.

“Hensley doesn’t love us, J-June. That’s why even though she knew what was going on inside of our bodies, s-she never went to check on it. She just wanted to rot us away and die.”

I could deny that one least of all.

Tears were now rolling silently down my cheeks as I watched Hope pour out messy, angry ones of her own. I felt small. Smaller than I’d ever had. Smaller than when I’d punched that girl at the warehouse or when I’d yelled at Trevor or when I’d never told Dad about my cancer. I felt small because if I’d just done what Hope wanted—if I’d just kept her close to my heart—none of those things would have ever happened. I’d still be home with them trying to clean up a much smaller mess than I was covered in now.

It hurt to hear Hope of all people say all this. Ann I had expected the resentment from, and June had masked her words behind her shyness, but Hope? Hearing the only person who ever saw good in ourselves tear me down and lay it out bluntly cut me deep to my core, and it made it hard to even know what I should say next.

There was really nothing. Nothing that I could say would make what I did to her any less horrible. What I did to *myself*. No words to justify and no gestures to make up for it. Instead, there was only one thing I could do. One thing that I owed her more than anything.

I pushed past my fear as Hope growled and huffed in her seat, holding her knees and staring at the floor. I’d conjured up a storm of emotions and bad thoughts in her mind, and in her confused state, she was trying to get ahold of them. My hand seemed to give her stability among the crashing waves as it landed on her shoulder.

Her tears eyes met mine, and all I could utter was, “I’m sorry, Hope…”

I thought that moment was it. The words flowed out with all intention I had, and I’d never meant them more in my entire life than when they’d just fallen from my lips.

Hope stared at me with a sense of understanding, and I almost believed that she understood the subtle implications behind my apology. That I really was Hensley, and that I understood how I’d hurt her. I braced my hand to begin feeling grains of sand, but then—

“June! Why are you crying? I d-didn’t make you sad, did I?” Hope chirped, her smile coming back in a near instant as she jabbed a thumb to my cheek and wiped it for me. “Sorry about th-hat! Let’s stop talking about sad things, ok-kay?”

The whiplash of her switch made me physically flinch, and I furrowed my brow in confusion. How had it not worked? I was certain that was going to be it. Had my theory been wrong? Was the idea of ‘saving’ my clones just a dumb concept I had tacked on to an unexplainable phenomenon?

I almost swallowed that pill, but it stuck to my tongue. That couldn’t be it. I had felt the exact same guilt and remorse the last two times it had happened with Depravity and June. Something was missing. A piece that I hadn’t accounted for yet. As I watched Hope turn back to the screen with her empty smile and distant eyes, it came to me.

I may have accepted Hope and come to terms with what she’d always wanted from me, but that didn’t mean she accepted *me*.

In her final moments, June and I had seen eye to eye, and in that, we were both able to become one again. Hen 5 must have too when I showed that I cared in my attempt to calm her down. I’d broken through her shell at the end and pulled the ‘real her’ back out, and though she was further gone, that moment showed that it was possible to reach the logical side of her, no matter how deep.

Hope wasn’t nearly as possessed by the poison of the roots, but she wasn’t going to hear me out until the real her was present, and so far, there was only a few times that I noticed she would break through.

I needed to make her really mad.

If I did, whatever shame Hope still had would crack through the surface. It’d happened back in the hall when she’d hurt my arm, and it’d been happening each time she’d had an outburst.

The problem was, poking the bear came with a good chance of getting mauled.

I didn’t care at this point. Escape was still hot on my mind, but after what Hope had just told me, what good was I back home without her? What did I amount to if I couldn’t fight for the part myself who gave so much for nothing in return?

I needed to save Hope, and I would do so or die trying.

“Hope, is there a bathroom somewhere?” I questioned, standing weakly from my seat.

“Oh! Just go back out the d-door, remember? I sho-o-owed you one on the tour. Here, I’ll come w-with you—”

“N-No! That’s alright,” I quickly spoke, “I’ll go myself. You keep enjoying the movie.”

Her eyes went stern, “N-No, I should come with you. You and A-Ann keep saying it’s dangerous, so we should s-stay together.”

“Not out here though,” I chuckled, trying to diffuse her a bit, “I’ll be okay, I promise! It’s just right across the hall!”

She eyed me cautiously for a long time, her pupils shifting from big to small in an animalistic way that made my skin crawl. Finally, she let out a dismissive growl and snapped her head back to the TV, her silent way of a ‘fine’.

I took it quickly, slipping out of the row and hobbling toward the back. As I did, I eyed the ceiling and its fluorescent white tubes that were currently powered off. When I reached the back doors, I did the same with the switch, then slipped outside, setting my eyes on a new target.

The double doors were the classic kind you’d see at a theater, so all I needed was a rod that I could slip through the handles to bar her in. I didn’t know if it would hold long given how easily Depravity had broken out of the freezer, but Hope wasn’t nearly as well formed, and I would only need her locked up long enough to burn out.

I noticed a cart across the hall filled with janitors equipment, among it a mop and two brooms. I grabbed all three, and then used them as walking sticks back to the theater door. My chest thundered fast as I pulled on the handles, worried that Hope may have changed her mind and come to find me already. Luckily, she was still in her seat, and as my eyes scanned the wall, I focused on the switch again.

Slipping my hand through, I took a deep breath and poised my fingers on it. I looked to Hope one last time and released the air. This had to work the first time, or not at all. My body would crumple under another injury.

“I’m sorry, Hope,” I told her, “but this is for your own good.”

She barely had time to turn her head before I flicked the lights on, and everything was washed in a white glow.

She screamed as I ducked back into the hall and pressed the door shut, slipping all three bars through the handles and stepping back. Within, I could hear my clone thrashing about and destroying furniture as she fumbled her way toward the switch.

Through the cracks at the bottom of the barrier, I saw her finally flick it off, and my heart stood still as I heard her shallow growls on the other side of the door.

“Hope? Are you okay?”

I nearly fell over as the doors pounded outward, the brooms groaning and bending beneath the power of the punch. They held though, and through the center crack, I saw Hope’s wild eyes stabbing at me.

“JUNE!” She howled with an unmatched fury, her voice not even resembling our own.

I stood my ground, swallowing hard then speaking, “Hope, I know this isn’t you! I need you to calm down—just snap out of it!”

My words didn’t help. If anything, they just enraged her more as she bashed her whole figure against it.

The brooms bowed more, and I heard a snap from the thick wood of the door. I took one more step back, then tried again.

“Hope, please! Everything you just told me in there—you were right! I don’t want you to hurt anymore, I want to help—but please, you need to calm down!”

Hope didn’t respond. She just unleashed a feral scream and smashed again, loosening the handles enough for me to see most of her face now. She slammed it into the gap then gnashed her teeth at me, spit and slobber slopping my way as if she were a rabid dog. After she’d done that for some time, she slipped and arm through and grappled at me, though I barely managed to step back in time.

Her bony limb speared at me over and over to no avail, but after a few more attempts, she looked down and saw the brooms, then froze. Her target suddenly changed, and she moved her hand up to grab the small section that she could.

Violently, she began rattling them back and forth, trying to figure them out. I knew it wouldn’t be long, so I tried one more time.

“Hope, please…” I mumbled desperately, just loud enough for her to hear over her cries.

For a second, her eyes met mine, but there was no mercy behind them. She wasn’t cooling off anytime soon, and what was worse, she was about to be free.

I took off down the hallway just as she realized she needed to slide the brooms to the side. I couldn’t run and hide in a room because only a few of them were unlocked, and it wouldn’t take long for her to track me in the tiny space. I needed somewhere large to outmaneuver her, so I went to the best place I could; the library.

The shelves would be the perfect cover to stall, and a large enough space to juke around her if need be. As I reached its door, I heard the brooms clatter the ground, and the doors slammed open. I looked back just in time to see Hope come flying into the hall, seeing me and charging like a rhino.

I shambled into the study then moved quickly up the main aisle, leaning on the shelves for support as I went. Hope’s bare feet slapped on the concrete from the hall, and I knew I didn’t have much time, so I ducked into an aisle and began moving for its far side. It was a tight fit as the shelf was cracked partially shut, and my coat slapped the edges of books and labels as I ran. Once I got to the end, and turned back, though, an idea dawned on me.

One that I didn’t like, but seemed to be my best way out.

I reached the end of the shelf just in time for June to enter the room, then I clasped my palm over my mouth to muffle my breathing.

I didn’t think Hope would hear me over her own labored growls as she looked around, but I couldn’t be too careful. I needed her not to find me until she was closer. Slowly, she began stalking up the main aisle, her knuckles scraping the floor as she dragged along. She peered up and down each corridor, looking to find me, and as she drew closer, I peeked around the corner down my neighboring lane.

I saw her come fully into view, and when she looked the other way, I stepped fully out.

“Hey!” I shouted, my hands trembling as they cupped my mouth.

Hope snapped around toward me, then let out a howl as she started down the aisle, this one much wider than the one I’d come down. As soon as she stepped into it, I grabbed the crank on the side and began turning.

Its weight gave resistance, but it was no match for my raw adrenaline. The knobs spun wildly as my arm pumped, and slowly, the steel shelf began rolling in on Hope like a train on a track.

She was nearly all the way when she attempted to shoot and arm out, but it was too late. Only her head, arm, and shoulders made it through before the wall collided with her, making a sickening *‘Crunch!’.*

Her arm had caught me, but it went limp fast as the pain hit her. She thrashed against the restraint of the shelf for a moment, but as she did, her breaths came out short and spliced like her lungs weren’t working right. Her eyes bulged in surprise, and her pupils danced in size, then she rolled her head across the floor to look up at me.

I took a step back and stared down breathlessly, half in shock, and half in fear she might get back up. I couldn’t move, not knowing fully what I’d just done. I didn’t think the shelves would be so heavy, and that it would hurt her so badly.

“J-J-une…” She mumbled.

I didn’t move or answer. Just kept looking into her eyes. Her pupils dilated one more time, landing on a size that was much more human, and I saw her expression completely change. Her hand slipped across the floor, her fingers tensing toward me.

“June?” she muttered again, more certain this time.

I dropped to my knees fast and scrambled toward her, tears already stinging at my vision, “Hope? Is that really you?”

She swallowed hard, and her eyes skimmed the space, “W-What happened? Did I hurt you?”

That question made my dam break, and I couldn’t help but snicker softly through the tears as I shook my head, “No, Hope, you didn’t. I promise you didn’t.”

She attempted her best nod, then tried to cough. It sounded like there was broken glass in her throat. “June… is Hensley really okay?”

I reached for her hand and took it, curling over her and letting my tears fall onto her cheek, “Hope, it’s me. I’m Hensley. June is okay, I promise, but—I’m right here.”

I saw her eyes flicker with recognition, and though I knew a million questions ran through her in that moment, she thankfully didn’t ask them. She just squeezed my hand tighter and continued to try to breathe.

“I’m s-sorry… for what I s-said…”

“No—no, Hope, stop,” I cooed softly.

I fell next to her and pressed my forehead to hers, our tears mingling in the carpet between us.

“I’m sorry, Hope. I’m so, so sorry. For everything. For all of this. For the cancer. For costing you Trevor. I’m so sorry.”

She didn’t respond. She just blinked tears away with a smile before finally letting her eyes slide shut for good.

My breath shuddered through my windpipe as I stifled a sob, and I shut my eyes too.

“I won’t forget you this time, okay?” I told her, “I promise.”

“Okay…” She mumbled softly. Dreamily. Like she were falling asleep.

She lay with her hand in mine like that for a few more minutes. It was warm and still and comforting; a hug that returned breath to my lungs and energy to my chest.

It was that way until it turned to tiny cool stones in my palm, and my breath became tight. With my eyes still closed, I let the light dance across my eyelids, then inhaled deep as it passed into me.

I didn’t feel like getting back up.

The journey wasn’t over, and it could still have a bad ending.

What a gentle ending that would have been instead. Lying there with my goodness and just drifting off. I couldn’t, though. I had to scrape myself from the floor. The other side of that coin was still out there trying to take my life, and I couldn’t let her do that.

It was time to finally end this.
