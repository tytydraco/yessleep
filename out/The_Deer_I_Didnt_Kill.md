It was past midnight when I was driving back from my business trip. I had been on the road for over six hours, and all I wanted was to be in my own bed. I still had about two more hours to go, but exhaustion was creeping in. The wipers barely kept up with the rain, and my headlights cut through the dense fog that curled over the empty highway like something alive.

Then I saw the sign—a side road cutting through the forest, promising to shave at least thirty minutes off my trip.

I didn’t think twice. I turned.

The road was narrow, empty, and eerily silent. Rain drummed against the hood, and the trees on either side seemed to lean in, watching me with unseen eyes. For a brief moment, I thought maybe this wasn’t the best idea, but it was too late to turn back.

That’s when I saw it.

A deer. Standing in the middle of the road, motionless like a statue. Its antlers were massive, unnaturally twisted into strange shapes. Its eyes gleamed dully in the headlights, not with the usual reflection, but with something… else.

I didn’t have time to brake.

The impact was brutal—the deer rolled over my hood and landed somewhere in the ditch. My heart pounded, my breath came in ragged gasps.

I got out, even though every part of me screamed not to.

The deer lay on the side of the road, its body contorted at odd angles, its neck twisted unnaturally as if something had wrung it at the last moment. And then I noticed something else.

There was no blood.

None.

I shuddered. I needed to get out of there.

A few miles later, I came across a small town. A gas station, a bar, a few houses. The perfect place to stop for the night and gather my thoughts.

The bar was the only place still open. As I walked in, the conversation inside halted. Everyone turned to look at me like they could sense I didn’t belong.

I took a seat at the counter and ordered a coffee.

“You’re far from the highway,” the bartender said, an older man with a wrinkled face. “Not many people take that road.”

“I hit a deer,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Figured I shouldn’t keep driving in this state.”

The bar grew even quieter.

“Was it big?” someone asked from the back.

I nodded.

“With antlers?”

“Yeah. Huge ones. Twisted, almost.”

The bartender gave me a strange look.

“You sure you killed it?”

“Positive. Its body was wrecked.”

An old man at a nearby table shook his head.

“Don’t worry,” he muttered. “It’ll come back for you.”

I let out a nervous laugh.

“Excuse me?”

The bartender sighed and leaned in closer.

“You ever heard of the ‘Night Deer’?”

“Sounds like a local legend.”

“That’s because it is,” a woman chimed in. She wore a thick jacket and had the look of someone who had seen too much. “There are deer in these woods that don’t belong to this world. They aren’t animals—not entirely. They… remember.”

“Remember what?”

“The faces of those who kill them.”

I scoffed.

“Okay, that’s interesting, but—”

“If you hit it,” the bartender interrupted, “it’s coming for you.”

I chuckled, but no one else did.

The motel I checked into was… questionable. The sheets smelled musty, and the bedside lamp barely worked. But I was too exhausted to care.

I fell asleep fast.

A knock woke me.

Soft at first. Then louder.

“Who is it?” I called, but only silence answered.

The knocking came again.

I walked to the door and peeked through the peephole.

Nothing.

I crawled back into bed, but just as I shut my eyes, another sound filled the room.

This time, it was closer.

A slow, scraping sound against the window.

My pulse pounded. I moved the curtain aside.

And then I saw it.

A deer.

Standing right outside, staring at me with dead eyes. Its body was broken, just as I had left it. But it was still moving.

Then its mouth opened… and it whispered my name.

I ran.

Didn’t look back. I sprinted through the parking lot, jumped into my car, and peeled out, not caring that the engine sputtered and struggled to start.


---

I don’t remember how I made it home. I don’t know how I drove that far without crashing.

But ever since that night, I haven’t been alone.

Sometimes, when night falls, I hear a soft knocking on my door. Or the slow, deliberate scratching against my window.

I never open it.

But I know it’s there.

Waiting.
