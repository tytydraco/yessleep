“Can’t you stay the night?” my mother asked, her voice tinged with worry. “I’d feel much more at ease if you didn’t have to drive through the mountains in the dark.”

“Sorry, Mom,” I sighed. “I’ve got an important meeting first thing tomorrow. And Alex has school as well.”

Her face softened when she glanced at my son, already tucked into his jacket and rubbing his eyes. “He looks tired.”

“He’ll sleep most of the way,” I said. “If I don’t leave now, I’ll be the one nodding off at my desk.”

She gave a small, defeated laugh before patting my shoulder and following me onto the porch. My father met us outside, his embrace carrying more weight than usual, before helping me load the bags into the trunk.

I lingered a moment in the driver’s seat, staring back at the old house, its windows glowing with the warmth from a lifetime of memories. For a breath, I thought about giving in - about staying one more night.

But the clock was already ticking in the back of my mind. Tomorrow’s spreadsheets. Tomorrow’s commute. Tomorrow’s bills.

I leaned out the window, kissed her cheek, and promised, “We’ll take it slow. I’ll text when we’re home.”

I eased the car down the crunchy gravel drive, watching Alex leaning against a window in my periphery, already half-asleep. In the mirror, my parents stood together on the porch, their shoulders brushing, waving back with weary smiles. A subtle pang of guilt crawled over my heart, as I wondered how many more times I would be able to see them again. My eyes lingered on their silhouettes as long as they were able, until the road finally bent, and the house slipped from sight.

I sighed and set my eyes back forward.

Not like I really had a choice in the matter.

My hometown spread out in sparse fragments as we rolled through it. I recognized the weathered storefronts with hand-painted signs, and all the shuttered diners that had once bustled when I was a kid, their neon now sputtering or gone altogether. The only places still lit were the gas station by the highway, and the bar across from it, its smoke-stained door spilling drunken laughter into the night air.

Even in the dark, I knew every corner, every fence line. The town was stitched into me: baseball games in the summer fields, bikes rattling over cracked sidewalks, that first awkward kiss in the alley behind the church. 

All those ghosts, pressed against a place that looked smaller every year I returned.

I found myself thinking of when I was Alex’s age, running wild through those same streets. Summer evenings that stretched forever, chasing fireflies with a gang of friends until our mothers called us in. Winter mornings when the snow came down so thick school was canceled, and the whole world turned into a playground.

It hadn’t felt like much back then. Just… everyday life.

 Only now do I realize how full it was, how I was never really alone. There was always someone knocking at the door, always a game being planned, always a cousin or neighbor ready to drag me along.

I glanced in the mirror. Alex’s small face rested against the glass, half-hidden by his jacket’s collar. He doesn’t have that world, not in the same way. He has a room with toys, a screen that keeps him company, and a father who rushes in late, too tired to do more than ask about homework before collapsing into bed.

He should’ve had more. A mother to soften the edges, to fill the house with something warmer than the hum of appliances. 

But she’d been gone since the day he arrived, leaving me to stumble through it all on my own.

I’ve done what I can. I keep telling myself it’s enough.

That showing up eventually, putting food on the table, keeping the lights on, that it all adds up to something he’ll understand one day.

I tell myself it’s necessary.

That the hours I trade now will buy him something better later. A bigger house, a safer life, the kind of certainty my parents scraped for but could never reach.

And maybe that’s true. Maybe he’ll thank me for it someday. That’s what I whisper to myself when I get home too late to tuck him in.

Still, there’s a pinch in my chest when I see him like this: quiet, patient, asking for so little.

A child shouldn’t have to be so patient.

Alex stirred, blinking at the dim streetlights. “Are we almost home?” he murmured.

“Not yet, buddy,” I said softly. “Go back to sleep. We’ve still got a long drive ahead of us.”

The last lamplight fell behind, and soon it was just the two of us, the car, and the long road curling up into the mountains. 

…

The fog pressed thicker against the windows, softening the edges of the headlights until the road seemed less like asphalt and more like a gray ribbon suspended in nothing.

“Dad?”

Alex’s voice was small, scratchy with drowsiness.

“Yeah, bud?”

“I can’t sleep.”

I glanced in the mirror. His eyes were open, pale in the dim glow from the dashboard.

I hesitated, searching for something - anything - that might help the miles pass. “Why don’t you play one of your iPad games? The ones you like so much.”

He nodded without a word and dug it out of his backpack. The glow of the screen lit up his face, painting him in pale blue as his fingers tapped and swiped.

I never really understood those games. The noises, the colors, the endless little battles on tiny glowing maps - it all felt like nonsense to me. But he seemed to like them. And more often than not, it was the only thing that kept him occupied when I didn’t have the energy to do so myself.

The road coiled and meandered, climbing higher into the mountains at unintuitive angles, and after a while he let the tablet fall into his lap with a sigh. “It’s making me dizzy,” he muttered. He pressed his cheek to the cold window instead, eyes unfocused, watching the mist roll past.

I tightened my grip on the wheel, lips pressed thin. Maybe I should have said something; offered to play some music or tell a story. Anything. But the words never came.

“I guess that works too,” I thought, and let the silence settle in.

The forest pressed close on either side now, just a blur of trunks and branches caught between the rolls of fog. I let my mind wander again, as it always does on long drives.

I thought about my own father, how he used to work himself raw at the mill and still somehow managed to make it home for dinner, to sit at the table with us every night. 

Maybe he wasn’t always cheerful, maybe he carried the day’s weight in his silence, but he was always there. I wonder - I hope - sometimes if Alex will remember me that way: always tired, always on the move, but trying. Or if he’ll remember mostly the empty rooms, the waiting.

…

“Dad?”

This time his voice cut through, sharper, urgent enough to jolt me back.

I glanced in the mirror. “What’s up, buddy?”

The fog had thickened while I wasn’t paying attention, billowing in pale sheets across the road and slipping between the trees like slow smoke. It made the headlights blur and halo, as though we were driving through water.

Alex’s eyes were wide now, no trace of sleep in them. He leaned closer to the glass, his breath feathering against it, mingling with the vapor outside until I couldn’t tell where the inside ended and the night began.

“There’s someone,” he whispered, “in the trees.”

A disturbance crept along my spine before I could stop it. 

For half a second I actually flicked my eyes toward the tree line, headlights carving only shifting fog and the blur of trunks. Nothing there, of course. Just shadows and mist.

I forced a quiet laugh, more for myself than for him. “You’ve got a wild imagination, bud. Out here it’s just trees and more trees. Nobody’s hanging around in the middle of the woods at this hour.”

Alex didn’t move, still pressed close to the glass, watching something I couldn’t see.

“Maybe you’re just tired,” I added, softening my voice. “When I was your age, I used to think I saw things on long drives too. That’s how your brain tricks you when it’s fighting sleep.”

His breath lingered on the window, clouding the glass. He didn’t answer right away.

Alex stayed there for a long moment, eyes searching the blur of trunks sliding past, his breath dimming the glass. Then, slowly, he sat back against the seat.

“Maybe you’re right,” he murmured, though it sounded more like surrender than agreement.

“Of course I’m right,” I said, forcing a smile into my voice. “Nothing out there but trees. You’ll see plenty more of them in the morning, I promise.”

I let out a quiet breath, loosening my grip on the wheel. Kids get restless on long drives; I knew that. Their minds start filling the silence with shapes and shadows, anything to make the minutes pass faster. I remembered doing it myself, watching the dark roll by and convincing myself there were faces in the hedgerows, ghosts hitchhiking at the roadside. Just tricks of a bored brain.

His eyelids fluttered, the fight draining from him as the rhythm of the car took over. Within minutes, his head lolled against the seatbelt, his breathing soft and even.

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding and turned my eyes back to the road. The fog pressed closer still, thick enough now that the headlights seemed to dissolve into it after a few feet. The world outside felt muffled, distant, as though we were the only ones left awake in it.

…

For a while, there was only the hum of the tires and the faint rattle of the heater. I almost let myself believe the rest of the drive would be this way. Quiet and uneventful.

Then Alex stirred again. I caught his reflection in the rearview, his eyes wide open, blinking as though he’d never slept at all. He leaned forward slightly, peering through the side window.

“Dad…” His voice was low, careful. “He’s still there.”

A prickle ran down my neck before he’d even finished speaking. I gripped the wheel tighter, blinking against the fog, which pressed thicker now, turning the road into a gray ribbon with no edges. The last thing I needed was another distraction. My eyes already burned from the drive, and now Alex was fixating on shadows.

I cleared my throat. “Still there, huh?” I said lightly, though it came out thinner than I meant, more strained than amused.

Alex nodded without looking away from the window.

I sighed through my nose, fingers flexing on the wheel. “Alright,” I went on, forcing a half-smile he couldn’t see. “If he’s there, why don’t you tell me what he looks like? Let’s make a picture of him. Might help you get him out of your head.”

For a moment, Alex was silent, his breath clouding the glass. Then, very softly, he said:

“He looks like a little tree.”

I forced out a laugh. “Sure you aren’t just seeing a plain ol’ tree, bud?”

Alex shook his head. “No… he looks like a tree, but he has a head, and shoulders, and arms.”

He paused, eyes fixed on the window.

“And he has eyes.”

“...Eyes?”

“Yeah… big, glowy ones. Kind of like an owl.”

A shiver worked its way down my arms. I forced myself to glance at the trees anyway, eyes darting between the trunks. Nothing there. Just the fog, pale and restless, folding over itself in the beams of the headlights.

“Must be the way the light’s hitting,” I said, making my voice steady. “Headlights and mist can play tricks. Trust me, I’ve seen it plenty of times.”

Alex didn’t answer. He sat back, still watching the glass, his breath fogging it in small, uneven bursts.

We drove like that for a long while. The hum of the tires smoothed into something almost calming, and the silence between us settled heavy but familiar, the kind that fills long roads at night. I even felt my grip ease on the wheel. Maybe he’d fall asleep again. Maybe the fog would thin out before the summit.

Then Alex’s voice broke the quiet, soft but edged with something new.

“Dad?”

“Yeah, bud?”

“He’s right outside the window now.”

My throat went dry. I flicked my eyes toward him, but saw only the fog pressing close, the forest swallowed in pale gray.

Alex leaned toward the glass, squinting. “He’s trying to talk to me.”

Before I could respond, he thumbed the latch and rolled the window down a crack. Cold air spilled in, sharp and damp, curling through the heater’s warmth.

“Alex- hey.” I reached across, fumbling for the controls on the driver’s side, but his hand was already on the glass. He leaned into the gap, lips moving, his voice soft and low, as though answering someone I couldn’t hear.

“Alex.” My tone came out sharper this time. “It’s freezing out. Roll it back up.”

No reaction. His face was tilted toward the dark, his words too faint for me to catch, his breath vanishing into the mist outside.

I gritted my teeth, fighting the urge to snap. “Alex! Window. Up. Now.”

Still nothing. It was as if I wasn’t even in the car with him.

“Alex,” I said, softer now, “come on, bud. Roll it up. You’ll catch a cold.”

The window stayed cracked, cold mist spilling into the car. Alex leaned toward it, his breath feathering into the dark. His lips kept moving, quiet, steady, as if he were carrying on a conversation I couldn’t hear.

My jaw clenched. Every mile of this road had already been a fight to keep my eyes open, and now this - this game, this fixation, whatever it was. I wanted to shout, to shake him back into himself.

“Alex,” I snapped, sharper now.

“Enough. Roll the damn window up.”

He didn’t flinch. Didn’t even look at me.

I sighed, defeatedly, before turning my head back.

But as I did, I thought I saw the outline of a figure at the edge of my vision - arms crooked like broken branches.

My chest tightened. I blinked hard, forcing my gaze forward again. Nothing there. Just fog slipping between the trees, making shapes where none existed. A trick of the light. A trick of exhaustion.

I let out another sigh, shaking my head at the nonsense of it all, and fixed my eyes back on the road. We just had to get home. Once we were there, he’d be back in school, back with his friends, back to normal. Something to pull his mind away from these little fantasies. That was what he needed. Structure. Routine. 

Distractions.

…

But of course, that wasn’t the end of it.

Alex started talking to whatever it was he saw beyond the window, his voice startling me out of my inner monologue.

“What game? …Really? You know how to play tag in the dark? I’ve never tried that before!” 

He let out a shy giggle. 

“Oh, Dad? Don’t bother. He never has time to play.”

A knot tightened in my chest. I cleared my throat, tried to sound casual. “Alex, it’s freezing out. You don’t want to be sticking your head in the fog like that.”

In truth, though, those words hit me like a stab in the back. I thought he knew what I was sacrificing for his sake.

I thought he understood.

Was this his way of telling me I wasn’t doing enough?

Alex didn’t seem to hear me. His fingers traced the sill, brushing against the cold air as though something waited just beyond.

For a while I just heard him murmuring, voice low and steady, like he was carrying on a secret conversation with the fog. At first I tried to ignore it, to keep my eyes fixed on the road, but the longer it went on, the tighter my chest felt.

“Alex,” I said finally, trying to keep my tone calm. “What are you two talking about?”

He didn’t turn toward me at first. His face was tilted toward the mist, eyes wide and shining as if he were watching something unfold just beyond the glass. When he finally spoke, his voice was hushed, almost reverent.

“He says he’s the king of the forest.”

A chill brushed the back of my neck.

“All the animals come to him,” Alex went on, his words drifting, dreamlike. “The deer, the foxes, the owls… they all bow down, and stay very still. They pay their respects.”

He paused, listening, nodding faintly, then continued, his voice softer now, almost awed.

“He says there’s a palace under the roots. Bigger than anything I’ve ever seen. With doors carved from the oldest trees, so tall you can’t see the top. When they open, they make the whole forest shake.”

His gaze drifted upward, as if picturing it.

“There are halls that stretch forever, and the walls glow, like they’ve got fireflies trapped inside them. He says the light never goes out. Not ever. And there are rooms filled with leaves that never dry, rivers that run under the floor, and staircases that twist all the way down into the dark.”

Alex gave a faint, almost secretive smile. “He says it’s all waiting for me.”

I pressed harder on the gas without meaning to, just to get us farther down the road.

“There are kids there too,” Alex said after a pause, his breath curling against the glass. “He says they laugh and play all the time, in the big halls and the gardens under the roots. They don’t get tired, and they never have to go inside when it’s dark.”

His smile widened, dreamy. “They climb the trees as high as they want, and nobody calls them down. And at night he takes them up above the branches, all the way to the stars, so close you can almost touch them.”

A chill ran through me at the way he said it, like he was half here and half somewhere else. For a moment, I almost let myself believe he was listening to something real, something outside the car.

I shook the thought off. Just a story. Just a tired kid letting his imagination spin itself out. I’d done the same when I was his age - made up kingdoms in the shadows, heard voices in the wind, anything to keep from being bored.

But then Alex’s voice dropped even lower, the words stretching out: “He says they don’t even miss their moms and dads. They forget all about them.”

That one landed like a punch. My grip on the wheel tightened until it creaked. Of course. Of all the things to repeat back to me, that was the one.

I ground my teeth, irritation spiking through the tiredness. I’d been driving for hours, working myself raw week after week to keep us afloat, and this was what I got - my son whispering about some make-believe king - or whatever he called it - who promised him a better deal.

A bedtime story designed to cut right where it hurt.

Alex leaned closer to the crack in the window, his voice soft, lilting.

“He says he’ll always be around to play. Even when it’s late. Even if he’s tired after a long day of ruling the forest.”

“He says he doesn’t mind telling stories every night. Long ones that go on until you fall asleep. He says he has all the time in the world. Just for me, and the other kids.”

“And he says…” Alex smiled faintly, eyes half-closed, “he’ll always love me. More than anything. He says he’ll never be too busy, never too tired. He’ll have all the time in the world, just for me.”

The cold gnawed at my hands - knuckles white against the wheel, at my jaw, at the back of my neck. Alex was still smiling faintly into the fog, whispering things I couldn’t hear. My patience broke.

“That’s enough,” I muttered, reaching across. My thumb jabbed the switch, and the motor whined as the window crawled shut. The mist thinned, sealed out by the pane.

“You don’t get it!” His voice shattered into a screech, high and raw. “He was talking to me!”

“There’s no one there,” I said, trying to steady my tone. “Just fog, just trees -”

But Alex’s face twisted, blotched and wet, and he screamed through the tears, “I thought I could finally have someone to play with! Someone who wouldn’t leave me alone!”

Something in me snapped. I slammed my palm against the wheel so hard it rattled. “Play? Is that all you think about? Do you have any idea what I’ve sacrificed for you?”

My voice was hoarse, cracking, but I couldn’t stop. “While you’re at home, I’m out there breaking myself so you can eat, so you can have clothes, so you can have a future! Do you think any of that just appears out of thin air?”

Alex sobbed, his hands balled into fists, but I kept going, louder, angrier, as if every mile of exhaustion was spilling out at once. “Do you think I *like* coming home late? Do you think I want to miss dinner, miss bedtime? You think I don’t hate it every single time I can’t be there?” My chest heaved, heat pounding in my skull. “But somebody has to keep this family standing, and it sure as hell can’t be you!”

I barely heard him anymore, his cries fading beneath the weight of my own voice. I couldn’t stop. The words kept tearing out of me, each one sharper than the last. “So don’t you dare tell me I don’t care. Don’t you dare say I don’t want you. Everything I have left, everything I’ve ever done - it’s been for you!”

My chest burned, words spilling out before I could stop them. “Do you think I wanted this life? Do you think I asked to raise you alone, to-”

I bit the rest off, choking on it. My throat closed around the words I’d almost said, words I couldn’t ever take back.

And then-

*Click.*

The latch’s sound cut through everything, leaving a sudden and absolute silence in its wake.

“...Alex?”

My blood froze. I snapped my head around.

The seat was empty.

“Alex!”

The car swerved as I slammed the brakes, gravel spitting beneath the tires. I threw the shifter into park and lunged out, the night air hitting me like ice. The fog clung heavy to the mountainside, swallowing the road, the trees, everything.

“Alex!” My voice cracked. I fumbled for the flashlight under the seat, my hands shaking as I swept the beam through the mist. Trunks. Rocks. Shadows. Nothing.

Then- movement. 

A shape cutting through the fog at the edge of the tree-line. Small, quick.

“Alex!” My heart lurched. I stumbled down the embankment, gravel shifting under my boots, the beam jerking wildly as I pushed after him.

Branches whipped at my arms, brambles clawed at my jeans, but I hardly felt them. I could see the figure darting ahead between the trunks, vanishing and reappearing in the folds of mist.

“Please!” My throat tore with the word. “Wait! I’m sorry, buddy - I’m so sorry. I’ll do better, I promise. Just… just stop!”

The ground dipped under my feet, roots rising up like knotted steps, and for a moment the fog pooled thick around them, like the threshold of something vast and hidden beneath. Then the figure slipped out of sight, and the silence pressed close again.

My light swung desperately from tree to tree, catching the mist rolling past trunks; branches shifting like pale arms. “Alex!” I screamed into the mist. “Please, don’t leave me!”

And then, at last, movement again - smaller this time, slower.

The beam caught him: a slight figure, shoulders hunched, trudging up from the gray. Alex. His dark jacket blurred with the fog, his steps heavy and tired, but his outline was real.

Relief ripped through me so hard I almost collapsed. I ran to him, dropped to my knees, tried to wrap him in my arms. “Thank God - thank God, you’re okay - I thought I lost you, I thought-”

But he stood stiff in my grasp, eyes dull, jaw set. He didn’t look at me. He didn’t say a word.

When I let go, he turned without speaking, and began walking back toward the car. I followed, broken, the beam of the flashlight trembling across the ground.

We didn’t speak when I led him back to the car. Alex climbed in without looking at me, buckled his belt, and turned his face to the window.

The engine coughed to life, headlights cutting tunnels through the fog. I tried to find words, any words, to fill the void.

“Hey, bud… maybe this weekend, we could go to the park. Play some catch. What do you think?”

No answer. His breath fogged the glass.

“Or the arcade. You always beat me at those racing games.” I forced a weak laugh. “Bet you’d win again. Oh- maybe you could teach me to play one of those iPad games you like?”

The tires hummed, steady and endless.

“We could even go camping. Just you and me. Build a fire, roast some marshmallows.”

Still nothing. Not a nod, not a glance. Just silence, as though the fog had seeped into the car itself.

By the time we pulled into the driveway, dawn was breaking pale and gray. Alex unbuckled his belt, opened the door, and padded into the house without a word. I trailed after him, the silence heavier than any scream.

He climbed the stairs, disappeared into his room, and shut the door. When I peeked in a few minutes later, he was already curled beneath the blankets, his small back to me.

I stood there in the doorway, throat tight, the apology still caught behind my teeth.

He didn’t stir.

…

He hasn’t been the same since then.

It’s hard to explain. He still eats his breakfast, still does his homework, still even laughs sometimes at something on TV. But there’s a weight to him now, a distance in the way he looks at me. As if a line was drawn that night, and he stepped across it, leaving me on the other side.

I’ve gone over it again and again. The fog, the road, the things he said. The man in the trees. I tell myself it could’ve been real, that something out there whispered to him, reached for him, tried to take him. Some nights, that’s easier to believe.

But the truth is simpler. And worse. It doesn’t matter what was out there. What matters is that I wasn’t.

I told myself I was working for him, that all the long nights and empty rooms would add up to something better. But children don’t wait for “later.” They only get one childhood, and I let his slip past while I kept promising myself there’d be time.

If the fog took anything from my son that night, it only carried off what I had already let slip away.

And now… now when I look at him, I see only what’s missing. I see the patience that shouldn’t have been asked of him, the quiet where joy used to live. He still sits across from me, still answers when I speak, but it feels like he’s further away with every passing year.

Sometimes I try to tell myself there’s still time - that maybe I can reach him, somehow. But when I meet his eyes, I don’t see a child waiting anymore. Only the silence he left behind.

And every so often, when the nights are very still, I catch him staring out the window, as if listening for something I can’t hear.
