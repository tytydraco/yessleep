A Night with A Beast

  


The top of Covington’s Peak stretched a rocky finger out over the hills of the damp Ozarks. Below sat the small town of Covington, where our family had wasted away on the banks of the Arkansas River. In the late ’70s, come spring, the river would whip its serpent tail back and forth, floodplain to floodplain.



Daddy had quite the hatchery, and little baby Ros and I would hang around on the banks below Covington’s Peak. You see, the eddies had cut a deep channel into the face of the peak, and just beneath the river’s edge—on the steep side of Covington—they’d cleared a cave. We’d strap all sorts of shit to us, wrap it in plastic, and dive deep into the side of the mountain: porno mags, M-80 firecrackers, old license plates—anything and everything we could pilfer that would catch the gaze of our squirrel-brained eyes.



Those days, before we were grown, before the mine and dam had drained the banks and left only a trickle of bayou below, we still had hope for our family. Now, a barren hill, a bricked-in trailer, and the ghostly remains of a hatchery and an abandoned mine are all that’s left of our name. The river dried long ago, leaving only a rocky bluff. The verdant current that once filled our pockets and hearts each spring is now nothing more than a dried and winding ligature mark on a town too old—too stubborn—to die.



A hill cursed since the days when white men chased plantation workers to their deaths upon it, and a man—nah, a fucking child—stands watching the specters of his past dance on the remains of his life. Fitting, I suppose, that this place would be where it all ends.



Those days in the caves below, staring at the nudy magazines—that’s when I realized I was different. A rebirth of sorts. But different in ways a boy had best not say; keep it to himself and puke it up in hushed conversations in his room. I felt so afraid of the truth. But the truth was clouded by my cock-filled, adolescent mind. It didn’t matter who I was. We all had secrets, and in some grotesque way, this town wrenched our jaws shut. We all slept and walked through life, zombified beneath the weight of truth and oath-bound by the traditions of our elders—a burden bore by the young, squirming in their wretched silence.



I’m tired now. It’s warm here. This late Indian summer grants me one last moment of happiness. Crisp, sun-scorched leaves fall around me, and the moon shines dim tonight behind the threat of rain. I’ll sip this moment like hot cocoa, think of my little baby brother, and take these final steps.



In the cruel satire that is my life, the jarring realization of floodwaters assaulted my vision. Just as peace had settled over me—satisfied with the outcome—I realized the morning’s rain had sent a torrent up over the rocky bluff below. It wasn’t quick; I had plenty of time to regret my misaligned, theatrical exit. Jumping off a fucking cliff—who the hell does that? Why couldn’t I have been simpler? Why couldn’t I have just been like my father? A .45 did the trick for him, and I even had the same…



It turns out, most people leave this world the way they lived in it. I used my last moments regretting myself—a tragic opera of kismet, destined for nothing more than what we all are. There was no savior for me, just the bone-jarring rush of water and a slightly softened impact—enough to crack my bones in nearly every way imaginable and leave me floating face up, drifting in the pain of my choices.



A sense of clarity rushed over my panic-stricken body. With so much pain, it was like I couldn’t focus enough to feel a single one of them individually. So instead—clarity. The warm ache of too much pain was certainly there, but it felt distant, as if I were floating above it. I coughed a wet laugh, tasted the unforgettable tang of iron, and slowly watched the stars fade above.



I awoke in burning agony, my scream slowly subduing itself into a deep, cooling numbness—like too much Vick’s from Mama’s cold, rough hands. Through blurry, wet eyes, the room glowed orange from a cackling fire. I was sitting upright, body bound, yet somehow comforted. Rags and cloth had been stuffed into the rope’s pinch points.



“Ahh, so soon, so soon. I could never get this right.” A voice rolled over my shoulder, jovial and uneven. The words felt clumsy and misspoken—like a dog trying to mimic its master—a vernacular so familiar, yet altogether foreign.



“Oh, my mask!” The blurred image of branches and leaves pushed its way past, scraping against my aching flesh. “Oh dear, no, no, no. Ugh.” The voice scoffed. “This just isn’t right. You must forgive me—where is that blasted mask?”



As my vision sharpened, the hobbled mass before me rifled through an old trunk, tossing items with reckless abandon. The room creaked and moaned; the moss-covered stones that made up the walls dripped with freshly fallen rain. The roof above was lashed with limbs that had grown purposefully into a braid that—mostly—served its purpose, save for the few holes where moonlight plunged through.



The table in front of me was familiar. It was the old gutting table Daddy set up down by the bend—the one we’d thought had washed away in the flood. Now it was adorned with the broken china and kitchenware long since trashed.



“Here it is!” the voice exclaimed, pulling something from the trunk and holding it up to the moonlight. “I think you’re going to like it too!” The object was lowered into the huddled limbs with deliberate care and, in a whoosh, the thing spun around.



The light illuminated an old Garfield mask—strung from knotted wood, patches of moss, and limbs twisted into a grotesque caricature of what was once human.



“Do you like spaghetti?” it chuckled, proud of its humanization. “Wait—no, lasagna! Damn it…” The beast shook its head. “No matter. Do you like it? Do you remember it? The very one you wore in ’86—you were so proud, so sporting, if I do recall! The way you pranced, catsuit and mask, shouting ‘I love lasagna!’ over and over…”



It lifted its arms, long, gnarled birch limbs rippling up from a knotted trunk. The beast was entirely made of birch, except for the dripping ichor that hung from the base of the Garfield mask. Slowly, it removed the mask to reveal a face calloused by growths of bark and moss that hung like a beard. Pieces of bone glinted in the moonlight, and just barely—almost completely overtaken by the growth around it—a spongy red eye darted within the remnant of a socket.



“You must excuse me,” it said, shrinking with embarrassment. “You’re the first guest I’ve had in quite some time. Many rings!” It chuckled and slapped the roots of the tree beside it. “Little tree joke. Sorry—where was I? Ah, yes. Little Gussy Oliver! I’ve been so excited for this day.”



It stood, arching its back to keep from breaking through the low roof of the cabin. “This cramped little place—ugh, to still be human…” With its back turned, it fetched a kettle from the fire. “You know, part of me still remembers. Hard to get rid of, even after all those years… My brother, the warmth of my mother’s milk. Her warm, dark skin.”



The damp room flickered with wild shadows in the creature’s presence. A pervading chill gripped the air, wrestling with the fire’s warmth that now invaded my shins and feet.



“You think elephants don’t forget? Ha! Just you wait—trees are something else!” It placed a cup on the table and plucked some fresh growth from a patch near the hearth. The smell of sweet mint erupted from the steaming water. The creature slowly crouched before me, holding the cup to my lips.



“I know—you think I’m a monster.” The tea was soothing, but I spat in defiance.



“Now, now… it’s just tea. If I meant to poison you, would I have made sure you were lashed with comfort?” A patch of moss raised like a grotesque imitation of an eyebrow. “Hmm? Besides, if I wanted you dead, it seems all I had to do was let nature take its course. Poor Gussy. A cliff. Even your abhorrent wretch of a father had better ideas than that.”



It pressed the cup back to my lips. I thought, what the fuck, and drank deeply.



“See?” it said proudly, smiling.



“Who are you?” I rasped through shredded vocal cords.



“Please, you mustn’t…” A sincere look of concern and pity wrinkled its wooden face. “Okay, okay…” It jostled through 



knick-knacks and trinkets hidden in shadowy wells within its body. “Little memory game.”



It scrunched its face, digging deeper until it pulled out a series of wet papers and a small notebook. “Well, that’s a little hard to say,” it muttered, thumbing through the pages with humanlike dexterity. “My mother named me Ezekiel—and despite its poor literary reference, I’ve come to quite like it. But I’ve had many names. To the people who roamed these lands—to my native tribe—I was Betula. To your father? A ghost. Bad luck. Everything and everyone he ever blamed for his misfortune. The reason he took his life—and the accident that shut down his insidious mine.”



Ezekiel’s voice grew sharp. “A mine! A claim on a forest he had no right to. No stake! No claim!”



The room clamored, the sound vibrating through the wood and stone, and then fell silent under the weight of his voice.



“No matter. You see, Gussy, his irreverence was his undoing—hell, the whole town’s. I didn’t want to, oh no!” He waddled to the fireplace and grabbed a worn yearbook from the mantle. “But ritual is ritual, and blood is blood, and we had a deal!” He swung around with fervor and skuttled up close, book open, wood-rot fingers jabbing tight to a picture.



“Dear brother,” his voice fluttered. “I do believe this is… ugh, ugh… 1965! He died in a war, and I was… born… of sorts. Your slimy father had just made a nasty deal with a worm of a man, in an effort to take land that wasn’t his. He and this man—your very own Senator Covington—commissioned a bill that would grant him war-time hardship and the ability to produce coal as a means of energy for the Arkansas River. You see,” he jammed the book into my face, “I’ve always watched closely, followed, nudged and tripped the right wires in my brother’s favor. Elijah would have the benefit of his dear brother by his side, even if he didn’t know it…”



He thumbed the pages to a picture all too familiar—a newspaper clipping of the day my dad coached his way to a state championship. “See, that’s your dad, the basketball coach, and my sweet Elijah.” A mournful grimace wrinkled his face as his body shook it off like a dog shedding water. “Elijah would inherit the bountiful gifts of our family’s sacrifice. But your father…” He dipped his head to his chest. “Sold majority ownership of the hatchery, commissioned the rights to a mine, and became a town hero! Woo, so many jobs.” He flailed his arms and launched the book across the room.



“And convinced my brother to comply with the draft…” The tone of his voice coiled in wrath, and I could hear the creaking of wooden muscles tightening. “It was not his burden to bear. Our poor mama had already lost too much.”



The mood grew more somber, and the limbs of foliage wilted with reverence around me.



“A boy, missing in the woods—they all knew the deal. I believe I knew as well, even at just three years old. The woods out my window always called to me. Always watched over us. Always watched over Keokuk.”



I wrinkled my nose. “Keokuk, the old abandoned village?” I asked.



“Hah, doesn’t look abandoned to me. Ole Mr. Covington just threw a new coat of paint, that’s all.”



“That’s just not true! My daddy said to never go down to them abandoned shacks in them woods.”



“Your daddy is a liar…” It drew its words in an irritated, slow, deep cadence. “Haven’t we already established that?”



The moist air grew silent, and the distant hum of cicadas could be heard over the bramble of the river.



“Brady Covington was a serpent of a man. State senator, newly elected…” he scoffed. “And your hero daddy had him commission a bill for new land, just as soon as your family inheritance checks cashed.”



“I’ve always liked you, Gussy. I knew you were different, and so was I, so…” He reached into a dingy old backpack that stung with familiarity.



“That couldn’t be!” I wrenched at my restraints.



“I thought if he knew, you two could be happy.” He slumped his shrubby shoulders in shame—shame that fell flat against the rage boiling in my half-dead body.



“You fucking outed me!”



“I figured if he found your letters, he would realize… I didn’t think his buddies would find ’em first,” he wailed, begging forgiveness.



“I was beaten, I was molested, I was mocked and tortured because of you!” Outrage poured out in bloody saliva down my shirt. I could feel hot tears stinging the fresh wounds on my face.



He slumped to the ground, and a faint whimpering cry rustled through his leaves. “I know, I know. I always think I know best—wise, ancient, and all. Hubris grows in the roots of ancient trees just before they’re toppled by the wind. That night, at ranger’s camp, when they found ’em… and you two… I thought your brother would help. I thought I would too…”



Real tears welled in his broken socket and wet his moss beard like dew. “I wanted to help…” He puffed his chest and drew an enormous breath that creaked like wind through dead branches. “But we had plans,” he smirked.



“Brady’s boy was the first to go—an accidental slip off the edge of Covington’s Peak.” He cackled with wry irony. “Seems fitting, doesn’t it? The town your father stole from us, and Brady’s subsequent mountainous namesake, would be the same stump”—he laughed, raising air quotes—“his boy would topple over and off to his death. Talk about tripping on your family’s ambitions. The mine that bankrupted the city… no coal to be found.”



“That one I was quite proud of. Had to use some wit to achieve that feat.”



“What about the collapse?” I screamed, shaking in anger. “The collapse that killed Henry!” I pulled tight against my restraints, drawing hot streams of blood that dripped to the floor.



“He was part of the problem too!” He rose in demonic fervor, slowly stomping his way across the room. “He wasn’t going to love you, Gussy! Not like I do! And when I saw him huddled in the corner… with what his friends did to you—”



“What you did to me! What you fucking did to me!” I spat what bloody saliva I could muster.



“He was a coward!” My head collapsed to my chest. “Kill me. Kill me, please.” I whimpered, dejectedly.



“A dream died that day, Gussy. The idea that purity and understanding could survive. I longed for human connection—I pained for it. I watched my brother, my mother grow old, reminiscing over photo albums, when our family was whole. I wanted her to hold me so bad, Gussy!” Streams of tears poured from his face. “I wouldn’t dare show my face. I couldn’t. They already hurt too much.”



He stopped—collected his presence. “I’m sorry for the collapse. That was particularly vengeful.”



I scoffed.



“It doesn’t mean anything, I know. But I am sorry… I watched, and I protected, and I felt abandoned with all that had been taking place in our beautiful Keokuk. But I stood by while the Covington family hacked away everything I had given up and was born to protect. Then I realized…”



A bright smile illuminated his face. “This was why I was needed—why the ritual was here in the first place, why it must continue. I am here to stop the world from encroaching on our land. And if the modern-washed Covingtons,” he gestured with disgust, “had forgotten its ritual and oath, I would have to make it remember why.”



“Please kill me,” I cried.



“Oh no. Not for a long time—ages, I dare say.”



He shuffled over to a kettle and snatched herbs growing from his chest, hurriedly muddling them before tossing them into the kettle. He poured a dark liquid from a tan-stitched canteen, and it hissed as it met the boiling water. An acrid scent rose from the fire and whirled into a cloud that seemed to awaken the forest around us.



The scampering, wails, and howls of animals surrounded us. And something more ancient creaked and groaned below—bellowed in feverish rumbles beneath our feet.



“It’s not pleasant. I’ll wear the mask, though—to take you home. You know, fond memories. You’ll have to be awake, but…” He pulled a sharp, stone-fashioned knife from a moss pouch and slid over to me. I struggled at first as he lifted my head but sank into futility as he poured the awful liquid down my throat.



The forest came alive, and an aura glowed from every corner. Humming and buzzing rushed past in a torrent of tones that slowly melted into a soft melody. I felt warm, numb, scared—but mostly warm. I had literally just tried to kill myself, so I mean… fuck it.



As I drifted in the daze, letting the buzz wash over me, he held my head gently and slid the stone knife into my throat.



“I wanted this talk, Gussy. I had to confess. I love you, and this is an honor. But I can’t have you call for help. You will be reborn, like me—and then you will consume what’s left of my husk, and with it, the knowledge of everything that is around you.”



The hike to the top of Covington Peak was a blur. The forest’s wildlife moved around us in respect and esteem. I swear the deer were looking right at me. The parade was alive.



At the peak, I saw a grove of birch trees—one splayed open like a womb. The air around me teemed with energy that pricked like needles. The horror of my limbs being removed almost went unnoticed, except for the arterial splatters that bathed his face.



I slid into the tree, much as I would imagine a nesting squirrel, and I felt the squirm of limbs—or roots—entering my wounds. Not in a way to hurt or devour, but to hold me, like a mother would.



I felt silence. I couldn’t speak if I wanted to, but I wouldn’t have. The beauty of the forest and trees was omnipresent. I felt loved. I felt accepted—something I hadn’t felt in a long time. The womb slowly wrapped around me like a blanket.



He slid the Garfield mask on, and just before it closed, I saw a tear roll down the mask.



“I love you, Gussy.”
