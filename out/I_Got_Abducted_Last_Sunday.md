When you first read the title you probably think of a kidnapping in which happened to me. But no. Thats not what this is about. I don't know what happened to me, I don't know where I was, or what took me, and this has been eating away at me in my mind to the point I desperately need to share my experience.

I always had an interest in astronomy, and upon the trillions of galaxies out there I knew there was no chance Earth was the only place with life. However, I didn't believe any potential extra terrestrial beings  are smart enough to have or visited Earth. And to be honest i'm still somewhat skeptical, but this experience changed my thoughts forever.

This all happened in Ohio, where I was born. Me and my two other friends were camping in Hawking Hills Nature Park fishing near a lone lake in the twilight, the view of the night sky was amazing, due to there being little light pollution to drown the views of the Milky Way. We cracked jokes and sat in our foldable chairs and made a mini bonfire to accompany us for some light and warmth. Now I'm an avid nature guy but when it comes to waiting for something to catch your line, I get pretty impatient.

We enjoyed some drinks and s'mores occasionally pulling in a Bluegill or Bass throwing back into the water after some pretty sick pictures with them. We had drove to this place by car with foldable tents, meaning using the bathroom was just directly towards the undisclosed part of the forest. I excused myself as I got up and trotted through the weeds making sure not to stray too far from our camp site.   


Thats when things got weird. I remember being blinded by a neon white light shining through the foliage about 200 or so feet away. a bird or too fluttered away as I finished, zipping my pants back up assuming the light to be some other person exploring the trail with a very, very bright flashlight so bright in fact, my eyes stung from looking at them. The flashlight stayed positioned as if someone was purposely pointing it at me before the light multiplied into seven others all rotating clockwise in silence. 

Surprised by the sight, I turned to yell for one of my friends to get over here with a light while the other watched over our site for any raccoons or any fish. My Friend Ashton flashed his flashlight around the trees scanning the area for my silhouette among the trees, after jumping from my ghostly appearance he trotted down the small weed covered hill towards my direction. The seven lights had stopped rotating, and now began to glow a faint red. I asked him if he had brought his phone, But we both left them in our handbags in the car. 

We spent a moment staring at the light, the faint red glow silently beckoning us to go towards it. I wasn't thinking, Im not sure why or how but I started to walk towards it. Like something was moving me like a puppet. My friends followed after me trying to get my attention but I just couldn't talk, I was at a loss for words and short of breath. The light got closer and closer to us. I walked towards It. It felt like the most beautiful, magnificent thing I've ever saw. I Lost all sense of thought other than to walk towards the ever-glowing light. The sounds around me turned to a fain humming. Thats all I remember. Being enveloped in a warm blanket of light. The world around me disappearing. 

I came to my senses feeling like I was on a wheeled bed being spun around like a rollercoaster. It felt like I was rolling down a steep hill in a bed. Once I came to my senses, I couldn't move, and I had no energy to talk. 4 tubes were stuck to my sides and ends. My eyes were fixed on a brightly lit metal, blurry ceiling. I could feel myself on a table, or countertop. I had no recollection of how I even got here. But as I woke up, the sense of touch began again. Something was holding my right arm out gripping my wrist with its dry hands. I moved my blurred eyes in curiosity. 

A old, Brown, Frail skinned figure reached a metal device up to my arm, barely bothering to look at me. It held it up to my arms and legs before placing the measuring tool behind it. I was nude, On a random table in front of what looked like the chocolate obsessed old lady from Spongebob. It took a glowing rod surveying every inch of below my neck. I could barely make out its face or black eyes. 

The things murmured to each other, there were others in the room. All surrounded in a circle around me, paralyzed, unable to yell or ask what the hell is going on. Without any anesthesia or morse, I felt them slice a small chunk of my leg off with out having any skin contact with me. I wanted to scream in the pain, get up and get out. But I was frozen, lifeless like a statue. I heard as they placed the flesh into a jar with prongs as an arm extended from the ceiling wrapped my leg in a sticky liquid. 

They cut pieces of my hair off, them too placing it into a jar, avoiding any visual or hand to hand contact with me like I was infected with the plague. I wanted this to end, to leave, I wanted to know who these were and why they were doing this. they extracted my blood via a needle to the arm, and pried open my mouth shining the rod inside like they seemed to be scanning my teeth and gums. Closing my mouth with the prongs. I closed my eyes praying for this to end as I felt the hard pressure of the tubes release from me with a pop. Immediately Just like that everything had disappeared. And I woke up in a sweat on the forest floor. 

The night sky above me, accompanied a large, triangular floating "island" with dazzling rotating lights floated above me, before floating away in the blink of an eye. Ashton cam to me helping me up, He too had been knocked out, claiming he woke up near a tree. In no way did he mention any of what I had witnessed, except for the comment on my now bloodied right leg assuming me to have scrapped it badly on a rock.

I agreed with what he said, too afraid to tell the truth, we both saw those lights, and we both don't know what that was. And we had only been gone for 20 minutes, for what seemed like hours to me. I don't know what happened. I don't know if I should say this, but I truly experienced something beyond imaginable.
