My grandfather often told me stories of the accursed trenches from the First World War, not about the thunderous battles or the hellish misery and constant torture that surrounded him. Nor the sound of the metallic war that covered the sky in white flashes of bullets and bombs that killed millions of fathers, brothers and sons. Instead, he would talk about the rat-ridden trenches they lived in, side by side with God’s uglier creations.  

He would talk about his fellow soldiers, their eyes before they turned hollow, the letters and poems they wrote before they turned to bloodied swirls of madness. He would speak of the vermin that strayed the hunger away and kept Death at bay for just a few seconds longer—laughing as he recounted the story of eating mites that found home on the hills of a soldier’s arse.  

“The only time we were truly together was when we were all shaking hands with the Grim Reaper.” He would often say. The robed skeleton had carried everyone he knew to their grave. They held his bony hand as they walked into the light. However, he had to drag some away, fighting God until their last breath.  

But there was no god; no man could look down upon his creation and be proud of what he saw. He left long ago, letting his toys play with themselves until we all heard his metal scythe. That’s not how my grandfather pictures them. Instead, he remembers the songs they sang in the cold mud, the jokes they made as the old man in his black coat stared at them with non-existent eyes and a bony smile as he laughed a dark laugh alongside them.  

His eyes grew with joy as he recounted the six that joined him, all wide-eyed with excitement, imagining how they would all come home together after kicking Germany's butt, celebrating and acting like heroes. Imagining the pretty girls would fall in love with the ones who saved the world; their future children would stop playing with their toys, look up at them full of wonder and ask, “Daddy, what did you do in the great war?”  

I will never forget his face as he recounted his last story. He would often trail off and remember the other tales he refused to tell. He was staring with shrunken eyes at something invisible hiding right behind me. Nan often used to say how he would stay up at all hours of the night, shrieking an ungodly sound, begging for his robed friend to take him away from all this pain.  

My grandfather was lucky that he found love before the war; he came back with hideous scars covering his face. I used to ask him how he got them, but he would get angry and lock himself in his room for days. Sometimes, I could hear him cry for help as his wife tried to comfort him.  

Granddad was lying on his deathbed at the old age of 96. He’s been getting sicker over the past couple of years, but the doctors say he only had a few days left. I remember walking into his hospital room, mechanical medicine surrounding him, all making constant beeping noises. An unchanging warning sound that lets you know that one day it will flatline, almost like it’s mocking you. 

I sat down next to him, the man who brought me up when my parents couldn’t—the man who sat in the front row of my wedding—now, lying there, his heart almost at peace, knowing that I won’t be alone but still had one more story to tell.  

His voice pained him; agonising wheezing restrained his every breath, and he forced his collapsing lungs to work. He stared past me into the corridor, eyes wide and gazing like something horrific was watching him. I’ve seen him recall the past countless times, but this is the first time I’ve seen him emote true dread. He babbles like he needs to get out before it’s too late. He struggled to dig deep into his mind and remember what he had once lost, stuttering and repeating sentences. 

It was the final great assault, the battle of Ancre. He returned from leave after being injured and joined the fifth British army. The generals hid safely in their cocoons far away from the gates of Hell, waiting for their commanders to tell them to go home to their wives and let the soldiers do the work. Seven days of non-stop bombardment on the enemy lines, yet they still delayed until they were ready to do the most heinous of acts. Picking up a pen and writing ink on a piece of paper. The pen is mightier than the sword; they would proclaim while locking the door and hiding the key.  

It was dawn, early in the morning, where even the sun wouldn’t dare to witness the world below. A thick fog covered no-man's-land, burying thousands of bodies across the battlefield. It was almost like it was letting Death do his work in private.  

My grandfather was alone; all his friends had died, buried in unmarked graves to be forgotten. Some died quickly, others in agony, crying alone and surrounded by strangers they came with. He forced himself over the trenches and roared as he ran towards the enemy. He had prepared himself to die, just one bullet to kill him and generations to come.   

He felt like a fool, a dead man running into the bony arms of the grim reaper like all his friends before him. They wanted to be treated like heroes, remembering how people celebrated as they all left their homes for the last time. Parents standing in the doorways, all proud of their little boys going off to war. The entire street celebrated before they left. People dragged their tables outside and put them together, making one long table full of food and cake. Everyone chipped in, praising them all for protecting their country. Stuffing their mouths with food and listening to music, they all talked about what they would do when they got home. Some spoke of marriage, some spoke of kids, and some spoke of getting as drunk as possible.  

People celebrate the ones who saved the world, but now they’re somewhere in the middle of a random field with thousands of others. A single flick of a finger and not only would he die, but hundreds of others down the line. He thought about the unborn children that would cease to exist because of a single moment.  

He ran until his lungs ballooned to where they were about to rip apart. Only the ribcage kept them in place; no matter how long he ran, he was still alive. Surely, he would have made it to the enemy by now, right? The trenches are miles and miles long; you can’t just miss them. Right? 

He stopped running, listening for the sound of battle that never came. He knew he was supposed to be quiet, but did not know where he was. Even if the enemy found him, at least it was another human being. He shouts into the fog, begging for help, but only silence answers his screams. Was he dead? Did a bullet hit him, but he never felt a thing? Was this his unmarked grave, a never-ending fog, never to be found? Screaming until his voice was shot, no longer being able even to see his own feet. My granddad picked a single direction and started walking.  

The fog became increasingly dense around him as he ventured further into this formless oblivion. No features or landmarks remained to show him the way back to the light. The white mist that had eaten everything in sight had swallowed whole the ground. Its jaws are waiting to clasp down on him. No matter how long he walked, there was no one; even Death seemed to have forgotten about him.  

Feet aching, legs shaking; eventually, he collapsed in the place between heaven and Hell. The invisible void between the two worlds where neither God nor the devil lives. During his time in the war, there were many moments when my grandfather accepted he wouldn’t make it alive. He would never hear the celebrations from his family waiting on the doorsteps for his arrival. The streets would be empty, and crying parents would fill the silence, wailing over their loss as only the grim reaper walked down the deathly quiet street. But he didn’t expect to die like this, utterly alone with no battle or glory in sight—just the vacant fog.  

He collapsed onto the floor, his voice now so croaky that even his cries were silent. Incoherent babbling escaped his cracked lips, his tongue so dry that even the desert had more moisture. He whispered the word pathetic, which he constantly repeated in his mind; my grandfather tried again to fight against the fear and gain the valour that had led him so far past the gates of Hell. But no matter how hard he tried, he could no longer prevail. His fear had won; he would be happy to be killed for cowardice if it meant he could see another soul.  

Lying in the fog, folded in on himself, knees pushed against his chest and sobbing for his mommy. A small groan echoes throughout the mist. Prove that there was another living soul in this smog. My grandfather gazes up through stale eyes to behold a motionless figure in the distance, awaiting my grandfather.  

Gripped by desperation, his last bit of hope was slowly dying. He dragged himself forward, crawling on his hands and knees towards the emotionless figure. Closer and closer he got, forcing himself on his agonising feet, screaming at him to stop walking. Everything was wailing at him to stop: his legs, his mind, his stomach, all aching in a painful cramp.  

A patting comes from behind him, and wet footsteps whisper in his ears as a hidden shadow dances behind him. He couldn’t look behind him; he was too afraid of the malevolent demon that cursed him to be here. The one he can feel breathing down his neck.  

With the last of his strength, he yelled in deviance and sprinted towards the figure. Mud covered his entire body from a ground he couldn’t even see. The muscles of his body screamed as he pushed his way through the thick mist that had been suffocating him for so long. The only landmark in this empty world was before him, getting ever closer; he dared not look back.  

Steps raced behind him, never leaving him, always directly in kill range. He could feel the malignant spirit reaching out at his ragged clothes, swiping and ripping his back. He could feel the fierce pain, but his attention remained fixed on the body ahead, his last hope.  

A hand grabbed my grandfather’s shoulder and flung him onto his back, but he had lived through the great war. He had spent years in trenches fighting other people just like him. Other people who were supposedly evil but just wanted to get home. He was angry at his family for letting him come here; he was angry at his commanders for hiding while calling him a coward, and he was angry at himself for convincing his friends to die.  

My grandfather swung his gun around, roaring at whatever foul creature dared to bring him here. It wore a German uniform, surrounded by barbed wire that stuck into its skin, causing it to spurt blood out of its degraded body.  

My grandfather screamed as he crawled away from the hideous creature. Just as he did, the wrapped figure opened its bloodied eyes and fell forward. Falling on top of my grandfather, cutting all over his body. He tried to push it away, but it was too heavy. Hands shot out of the ground and held him down. My grandfather fought them all off as the barbed wire wrapped around him, stabbing into his skin as blood oozed out of his body. 

The wire unhooked from the creature and wrapped around my grandfather’s head. The pain suffocated him, along with the wire that squeezed his head. He could feel it digging into his brain and down into his mouth. The last thing my grandfather saw was the creature dislocating its own jaw and about to bite down on my grandfather. After much struggling, he unfree his arm, punched it and hit it in the face, falling its flesh against his fist.  

A woman’s cry digs into his ears like the wire did as he realises the mist was gone. He could see again, and he saw many humans holding him down. All were dressed in medical clothing and covered in blood. He made a deal that he would calm down if they let go of him, and they all did. The nurse’s attention was frantic as the reaper held the hands of many shoulders that day.   

My grandfather thought it was all a dream at first, but he lifted his hand and felt bloodied bandages all over his face. His eyes were the only bit of flesh not covered in the now-red reminder of his torture. Not long after, the commanders sent him home, and the war ended before he could fight again. He expected his face would bring dread to the other soldiers, but they had lost their smiles long ago. 

He died only a few hours later, the final story he ever told, and I could never forget it. I wish I could say he died peacefully, but he didn’t. He died in fear, recounting the same story repeatedly until his final breath. He never stopped talking until the reaper finally collected his due and held his hand away from his broken mind.
