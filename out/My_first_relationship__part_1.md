There is something I need to get off my chest, and I know I’m not in the right but Idk if I am not in the wrong either. This story will be cut off into many parts and different names will be used to protect others and myself. This story is based off past tense and it lasted 3 years.

I have never been in any serious relationships prior to this, they were relationships that lasted at times almost a week. I always saw it as people come and people go because of how fast people left. It never bothered me because I would rather be alone. I guess you could say I was antisocial.
I was always belittled, lied to, walked on, called bad names, and was just treated bad overall by the parent I lived with and they always made me guess if every decision I made was the right decision. I was treated so poorly that I isolated myself, and stayed away from others and was just always chill by myself even tho I had siblings in the house. I ran away at a young age and stayed with other family I felt more comfortable living with and didn’t cause any problems. But due to me living in that household for as long as I did I became very indecisive about everything and many other problems was there.


Fast forward a few years, I was going to high school and was in my sophomore year and met my now ex. I was 17 turning 18 in a couple of months and she turned 17 two months before I met her. We will call my ex “CC”. Me and CC met in the lunch room cafeteria through a friend and we hit it off just fine. Since I was used to people coming in and leaving right away I expected her to blow me off by the second week but I was wrong.


 She said she was in a relationship and I respected it. During the first week of knowing CC, she piled all of her past experiences onto me and her current problems. She showed me all of her cut marks she had on her arms which were really deep. Like they were so deep that you could think that she bleed out a few times deep. told me that every relationship she had ever been in she was either raped, neglected, mentally abused, cheated on or beat, and plenty of times it was all the above. She also told me her and another sibling was raped by a family friend growing up when they were young, beaten and neglected by her parent, and that she had D.I.D (multiple personality disorder) and I met the personalities. They all claimed they had powers and I just played along cause I just wanted to be a good friend. In my head I thought that this girl lived a harsh life and I just wanted to help her out. 


Now I was never told about these type of women growing up due to always being treated unfairly and was never given any proper guidance so I was naive about all these red flags. But during the first week she skipped class to hang out with me, found my Facebook account and texted me out the blue, and snuck into my lunch period to hang out with me every day. I never had anyone did this for me before so I felt special and wanted. I forgot to mention that CC current boyfriend at the time did not like any of this, and me and him had the same class together. He would always stare me down with hateful eyes but I always shrugged it off.


I ended up going back to the parent that treated me poorly once again to see if they have changed. they said I could stay with them for a few days if I liked and I took the offer. I went to school with CC the next day and offered for her to meet my parent and she agreed. We took the bus back to my place and I told her to wait downstairs. I went upstairs to see if they would like to meet my new 
friend but what I saw next was not pleasant.
