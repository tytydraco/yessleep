**WARNING: Bugs, Blood, Bodily Substances**

On my first day of school, I met this friend. We'll call her Jenny. Jenny and I met while walking the track in gym class. We made small talk about how cold it was outside, and why they didn't let us do anything inside as an alternative. We then found out we had the same lunch period, and decided to meet up in front of the school's auditorium, then go into the cafeteria. When I saw her I gave a wide grin and yelled.  
  
"Hey, over here!"  
  
"Oh hey! Navigating this school is sooooo annoying."  
  
"I know right? It's pretty big. Let's go in."  
  
Once we got a seat in the cafeteria, we started to talk about our classes, teachers, all of that. From that, she noticed my phone case. It has a photo-card of a K-POP idol on it. She noticed.  
  
"OH MY GOD!!" She screamed. "YOU LISTEN TO THEM?"  
  
"YEAH!!" I responded.  
  
We then started to talk about music. We both listen to a bunch of different stuff. I listen mainly to K-POP and heavy rock. From what I gathered from Jenny's rambling, she listens to indie pop and K-POP. When I say indie pop, it's the 2020 TikTok music. I get chills just thinking about it. It's a little bit of a red flag in my book, but I just brushed it off my shoulders. Once lunch ended, we parted our separate ways to our next classes.  
  
The next day, I saw her again in the gym. We walked the track and bonded even further. Talking about movies, TV shows, video games, blah blah blah.  
  
I also have to establish that I have wireless earbuds. They were cheap and good enough to my liking and I use them everyday.  
  
One day, she saw me take the case out of my backpack. I opened it and put the left earbud in.  
  
"Mind if I listen?"  
  
“Go right ahead, here.” I offered her my right earbud. I then played my daily playlist for her. She was rocking her head up and down as I played some rock music, System of a Down if you're interested, and I think she enjoyed it. As the song ended, a more upbeat K-POP song came on in the shuffle. It was “Russian Roulette” by Red Velvet. She kept bobbing her head to it.  
  
“You know what the song is about right?”  
  
“Uhm, yeah! Sure, of course..” She said hesitantly. Obviously she didn't, but that was okay. It isn't everyday where you meet someone who knows every meaning to everything, right?  
  
Before the bell was going to ring, she gave me back the earbud. When I got it back, I held in the gasp I had almost let out..  
  
***It had a clump of earwax in it.***  
  
“Okay, uhm that's gross..” I thought. But I just chuckled awkwardly, then the bell rang.  
  
“Okay see you tomorrow..” I mumbled. I kept staring at the earbud.  
  
*“What the hell?”* I thought. I just wiped it off with my white t-shirt and put it back in its case.  
  
When I left school that day, I kept thinking about it. It was such a pretty big clump too.. It was just really fucking gross.  
  
Everyday since then, she kept asking for an earbud. And since I didn't have many friends, and I didn't want to lose her, I didn't say no. Jenny started asking for it during gym when we played volleyball, during lunch, and during every class we had together.  
  
Every time I walked into the door of a class I had with her, she would silently appear out of nowhere and yank the strap of my backpack to the point where I almost fell back.  
  
“Can I have one?” She’d ask. I gave it to her, then entered the room.  
  
Every time she gave it back to me, there was always a clump of ear crust in it. Jenny needed to start cleaning her ears. I tried to bring it up to her, but she just changed the subject every time.  
  
One day, Jenny was a little *off*. She asked me for an earbud, as per usual, I gave it to her. But I accidentally gave her the right earbud. I usually have that one, but today I was stuck with the left.  
  
I played my usual playlist and let it go for around 10 minutes. Around the 11 minute mark, there was some weird interference in the music. It only somehow happened for me, Jenny wasn't affected by it by the looks of it. I then felt something moving around. Sometimes, my hair gets stuck behind my earbud and it doesn't bother me as much so I just left it as it was. It then just kept annoying me. Moving around felt kind of like crawling.  
  
It wasn't my hair. ***Something was in my ear.***  
  
“Uhm, I need to go to the bathroom really quickly.” I ran to the bathroom before Jenny had the chance to answer. Once in there, I took it out of my ear.  
  
**It was a maggot.** ***A maggot was in my goddamn ear.*** It was attached to the earbud. I flicked it off. I almost threw up.  
  
**“What the** ***fuck*** **was that?”**  
**“*****Why*** **was it** ***in*** **my ear?”**  
**“*****How*** **did it get** ***in*** **my ear?”**  
  
All of these questions just kept running through my brain. It was crawling around in the sink. I smushed it with a towel and a red substance splat out of it. My first thought, *blood*. I’m pretty sure it was. I got another towel and I wet it under the sink, while also washing away the maggot. I cleaned off the earbud, along with the rubber part that made it fit into my ear. Once I was sure that it was clean, I put it back into the case and never put it in again that day.  
  
I got back to the table, but Jenny was gone. All of her stuff was gone from her seat. I have no clue where she went, if she had a meeting, if she sat with someone else, I don't know where she went.  
  
Luckily, I had class with her later that day. Once I got to that class, she wasn't in her seat. Did she go home early? Was she skipping? Who knows. Jenny was a good student, but I still wasn't sure where she went.  
  
The next day she finally showed up. I saw her in the gym’s locker room. I said hello but she didn't say a word to me. All she did was give me my earbud back. It was, once again, covered in ear crust. It was a larger clump this time around, larger than usual. Gross to think about, I know, but I got past the point where I was on the brink of puking. I didn’t use that earbud the rest of the day.  
  
When I got home, I decided it was time for me to deep-clean them.  
  
9:28  
I got some alcohol wipes from the closet and a couple of q-tips from the cabinet and went into the bathroom.  
  
9:32  
I took off the rubber covering of the left earbud and was met with clumps of yellow and brown. I wiped them off carefully with the q-tip.  
  
9:38  
I took off the covering of the right earbud. I was met with the same fate. Clumps of yellow and green this time. There was also what looked like a leg of a small bug. *Gross*..  
  
9:43  
I looked at both of the earbuds. They still had some debris on them. I took the alcohol wipe and wiped down the left earbud. Then the right earbud.  
  
9:49  
I looked at my work, then noticed something.  
  
Something was inside of the left earbud. The one Emily mainly used. What's the deal with this girl?  
  
9:53  
It took me a while to muster up the courage to look inside of the earbud. I had to very carefully take off the grid part of the earbud to keep outside substances out. Like water and earwax. Obviously, it isn't doing its job correctly.  
  
9:55  
I got some needle-nose tweezers from the cabinet.  
  
9:56  
I finally took off the grid of mesh-like fabric to peer into the earbud.  
  
***I was right.***  
  
9:57  
A bug I had never seen before proceeded to crawl out of the left earbud. It had too many legs to count, along with way too many eyes for its body. Its body was rather small, almost the size of a large ant. Y’know, one of those flying ones. It had two small wings, I bet they couldn't even lift that bug off the ground.

It was covered in what looked like blood, it was *definitely* blood.  
  
10:00  
Another bug crawled out of the earbud. These weren't very big earbuds, but I was still backed up against the bathroom wall, scared for my life. My heart was going so fast, I literally thought it would burst out of my chest and crawl away too. Into the sink.  
  
10:05  
I was scared to check the other earbud. But I did. I took off the grid covering of the right earbud.  
  
Several minutes passed.  
  
10:23  
  
Five bugs in total came out of the left earbud, and four came out of the right.  
  
*“What the fuck?”* I thought. I left the earbuds in the bathroom for me to deal with the next morning before I left for school. I then went to bed. 10:52.  
  
I woke up the next morning, not wanting to get up.  
  
I made my way to the bathroom. I saw the earbuds on the counter. I looked at them in disgust. I looked at myself. I looked as pale as a ghost. My eye-bags were darker than the day before, but it wasn't my biggest worry at the moment. I got ready then left for school.  
  
Jenny was waiting for me in front of the school gate.  
  
“Hey Jen.” I said tiredly.  
  
“Heyyyyy! You alright? You look like you just crawled out of bed.” She emphasized on *"crawled,"* with weird hand movements that weren't her own.  
  
I gave a meek smile. Before we went in, I paused. Time almost seemed to stop entirely.  
  
Jenny had her hair up that day. When she dragged a loose piece of her hair behind her ear, I could see dried skin fall onto her dark brown hair. White flakes of her pale skin.  
  
I then saw a centipede, **a fucking centipede,** crawl out of her ear, into and around her hair, and then back into her ear.  
  
I am still haunted to this day. I stopped speaking to her. I moved seats in all of our classes and stopped being on her team in gym. It's rude, I know, but I *had* to do it.  
  
I saw her on the city bus one day. Seven months had passed. She staring at me with her deep cold brown eyes.  
  
I then saw a cockroach crawl across Jenny’s face. She didn't flinch a muscle. It crawled out of her ear, across her eyes, up her nose and out the other nostril, then into her mouth. *She smiled.* It was crawling around her crooked yellow teeth.  
  
I knew that she liked bugs. I never thought that she liked them *this* much..
