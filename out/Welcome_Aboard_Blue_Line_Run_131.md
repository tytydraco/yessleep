[CTA Blue Line Automated Annoucements, For Context](https://youtu.be/Q5NM5B-VeTg?si=qd-y69_06zjeSdqa)

*This is Clinton*

A warm, familiar, robotic voice echoes into my subconscious. 

Clinton? That can’t be right? We’ve never passed through Clinton, even on our longest subway trips.

*Next is LaSalle. Doors open on the left at LaSalle.*

I force my heavy eyelids open. How long have I been asleep? I lift my head to look for Jay.

During the day, the subway cars boasted shiny chrome features and a well-maintained paint job. Newer LCD screens that confidently display each stop felt like compensation for the seedy reputation that the Windy City held. The cars rode smoothly for the most part, even if you had to stand. The clear windows confidently display the sprawling cityscape, freckled occasionally with large trees, whose leaves are changing color in preparation for winter. 

After midnight, however, the train really shows its age. The tattered seats, sprawling with deep scratches and scribbled graffiti, bear a sickly beige color, once popular at a time I will never remember. The harsh darkness of the windows made the space feel even more confined. The floor, cracked and weathered, reeks of Chicago’s finest scent: thin layers of tarry, ashy, cheap cigarettes balanced, almost intentionally, with piss.

“Have you not been paying attention to our stops?” I scold Jay.

“Of course I have, do you not trust me? We’ve only been on the train for 15 minutes,” he hisses back.

“If we’ve only been on for 15 minutes, how the hell did we make it to Clinton? And how could you let me sleep?” I whisper scathingly.

“Clinton? We’ve been on track so far. And you’ve been in so much pain, I wanted to let you rest,” he replies.

He’s right. While I really looked forward to the trip, it’s obvious how much of a toll it’s taking on me, both physically and mentally. While I wouldn’t call it a disability, walking is difficult for me. But if God gives me legs that work well enough to get me somewhere, I’m going to use them. There’s no way I can swallow my pride enough to call an Uber. Instead, I just keep pushing myself, and now I’m starting to feel the consequences.

Our trip to the city had a rough start. We have been to big cities before, but never one quite this large, and never without a car. Our first encounter happened just moments after setting foot into Union Station. Jay walked off with a stranger who “needed help with Apple Pay.” He claimed that he was just trying to protect me. 

After that, we spent the first few days of our vacation reliving memories from my childhood. Eating hot dogs in the park. Sitting in the aquarium watching the dolphins that I once watched with my mom and dad. Walking through the same ancient Egyptian exhibit at the museum, where Papa joked about “turning himself into a mummy some day.” I was too young to understand how unsafe the city could be. I was too young to worry. 

Even if I want to prove him wrong, there’s no route tracker in this train car. Just the old pasted signs were barely visible through layers of Sharpie. I pull out my phone to check the route, but it is of no use, just one big blue circle around the station we boarded, as if we never left.

“What if something happened?” I argue.

“Hun, there’s no one here.”

I look out into the train car, and to my surprise, there is not a soul on our car. I usually enjoy spending my time alone. But now, I have gotten so accustomed to seeing hundreds of new faces every day that this silent moment feels unnatural. 

I think back to the station that we boarded from. Nothing felt unusual, other than it being super late. I could have sworn that another person boarded the train with us. Maybe he had gotten off by now. 

*This is LaSalle. Doors Closing*

The man from the intercom confirms my suspicions.

“See, I told you?” I say, trying to keep my voice down. But what is the point? 

There it is, plain as day. Shining on the wall in little off-white aged pixels: O’Hare. We are going in the right direction.

“Maybe we’ve heard it wrong. The train loops around, so if we miss the stop the first time, we’ll make it back eventually.”

I slouch back into the seat, letting my sweatshirt protect me from its slightly sticky exterior. I go to lay my head back and feel a cold wetness kiss the back of my neck. Nope, never mind.

*This is Jackson.*

I peer out the window. We’ve stopped at Jackson a few times over the last few days. When the doors open, people usually flood in and out, making connections to other trains. The subway stations themselves served as stages for various street performers. But as I look out the window tonight, my chest tightens. 

*Doors Closing.*

The intercom announces.

The door chime keeps ringing incessantly but the doors remain open.

At this point, the train car has been stopped for much longer than usual. I gently stand up from my seat, step to the doorway, and poke my head out. 

Right

Then left

Then right. 

“Do you not know how to mind your own business? Come sit down,” Jay begs.

I think he is trying to comfort me, but I can’t help but feel that he’s more annoyed with me than he is concerned. So I do what he asks, I walk back and sit down.

*Doors Closing.*

The train groans to life then we are on again.

*Next is Monroe. This is a Blue Line Train to O’Hare*.

I pull my phone from my pocket. I try refreshing, closing, even forcing a restart—nothing works. The map won’t move. 

Frustrated, I looked at Jay. “Hey, do you think you could pull up directions on your phone?”

“No,” he jokes.

“What do you mean, no?” I question.

“My phone’s dead.”

My throat starts to burn.

“What do you mean it’s dead? We’ve talked about this! I even reminded you last night to plug it in!”

“I’m sorry, I forgot,” he pouts.

The automated message from the intercom interrupts us before I can chew him to bits.

*Next is Washington. Please keep your belongings off the seat next to you so others may sit down.*

I slump back, face red hot, swelling with anger. As I feel myself go to speak, my anger is washed away quickly with an overwhelming fear. 

12AM. Do I see that right? The show ended at 12AM. It should be well past 1AM.

I feel down in my pocket to make sure I still have my bus ticket, not that it will do me any good.

*This is Washington. Doors closing.*

The automated message echos through the empty car. I turn my head towards the entrance but quickly change my mind when I hear a faint sound break the cold night air.

\*Clack\*

Draaaaaaag

\*Clack\* - the heavy sound of polished wood driven into the concrete platform.

Draaaaaaag - the laborious scraping sound of fabric

\*Clack\* - it is different this time, smacking down against the worn metallic floor of the train car. The doors are still open, and now it is on board.

Draaaaag

Jay grabs my hand and squeezes. I need to mind my business.

The repetitive, rhythmic sounds echo through the vacant train car like a small rock falling down an empty cave.

“Can you spare something for the homeless tonight?”

For a split second, I feel relief, just a homeless man. But, his movements sound unnaturally machine-like. Like a single shoe clunking against the walls of an old washer. And his voice, weak and strained, pushes the syllables over his tired larynx robotically, as if he’s said this one million times before.

“Do you have any water? God Bless you.”

Worse yet, who is he speaking to?

He shuffles through the train car, smacking his cane, dragging his heavy feet. I can feel his presence getting closer, and I nearly jump from my skin as he speaks again.

“Can you spare something for the homeless tonight? God Bless you.”

In a moment, I let my guard down, and look up. His body, shrunken and contorted, follows his outstretched arms, his feet dragging behind him as he pulls himself along with a tall knotted cane. In the other hand, his long, gangly fingers dip down into a disposable paper cup, with a coin in the bottom. His head bobs with his steady movement along the train car, staring straight ahead. His worn and tattered clothes hang over his frail body like an oversized curtain. Before I catch myself looking, he turns his eyes toward me.

“Do you have any water? God bless you”

His eyes, bulging and glossy, somehow stare right through me, while looking at nothing at all. His face is gaunt and tight, like an undersized fitted sheet pulled too tightly on a large mattress.

I choke. I throw my eyes to the floor. Jay squeezes my hand tighter.

“Can you spare something for the homeless tonight? God bless you.”

And just as soon as he is on the train car, he exits through the other door.

Even as the train rears back to life, I can hear the man

clack and drag 

through the empty station.

*Next is Clarke and Lake*

“What… was that?” I mutter, dumbfounded.

“It was just a homeless man,” Jay responds, as if he’s trying to reassure himself as much as he is me. “We only have a few more stops.”

Just a few more stops. The graffiti-covered map shows we still have more than ten stops. I try my best to read advertisements to kill time, but it feels like I’ve seen them all hundreds of times at this point.

I tilt my head towards the doors where the homeless man exited the train car. Sitting on the edge of the seat was the tiny, crumpled paper cup, now overflowing with coins and bills.

The train screeches to a stop.

*This is Clark and Lake. Connect to Orange, Green, Purple, Pink, and Crimson Line Trains at Clark and Lake.*

I reference the shrouded line map again. Clark and Lake, Orange, Green, Purple, Pink, and Brown. Where does the Crimson line go?

“Something feels really off.”

“Just sit down and try to rest, it’ll make the time go faster,” he tries to comfort me.

*Please familiarize yourself with the train communication and evacuation procedures, posted in each car.*

The gentle interruption of the prerecorded message startles me from my deep staring.“I’ve memorized the emergency procedures already, long commutes will do that. I place my hands on my knees and push myself up, too on edge to sit down any longer. I reach for a glaring yellow hand strap and grasp it tightly. I swing towards the next strap, using the momentum to propel me down the length of the moving train car. I plant my feet in front of the emergency exit and peer through the small window hoping to see something in one of the adjacent cars. I lean in close and squint. About 3 cars down, I can see the outline of a figure. That’s right, the other man from the station we boarded. Though, as late as it is, I don’t know if I can trust my eyes. 

*This is Division.* 

The whooshing sound of the doors opening and closing takes my attention, just for a moment. I look over my shoulder again, down the length of the train cars. I see the figure again, but this time I can make it out better. I must have judged the distance wrong before. I can see the figure about one car away now. A clean cut gentleman, in what seems to be a three-piece suit. He is standing in the empty car looking down at his hand. Probably using his phone.

I place my hand onto the emergency door button. The plastic is aged and worn, the text on its exterior sharp and ragged. It fought against my fingers as I tried to depress it, albeit not very hard. I give up my test and shift my attention back to the man, still transfixed on his phone.

*…Damen…*

The prerecorded message falls on deaf ears. The train needlessly pushed open its doors to a barren platform. With both hands on one yellow handle, I swing myself back and forth, trying to outpace both the terror and boredom that are welling deep within me. I peer over at the emergency exit again to take a better look at the man. Maybe I could get his attention. As I take a closer look, I notice that there is no phone in the man’s hand, just his upward facing, empty palm. 

“Jay, I think there’s someone…”

*Western. Next is California.*

The train lurches forward with a force we haven’t felt before. I quickly bend my knees and shift my weight to keep myself from falling over.

*This is California.*

California already? It’s only been a few minutes since the last stop. The train doesn’t slow as we approach the station. If anything, it feels like it is accelerating. I peek through the car doors again, the man is there. Standing in the middle of the train car, looking directly at me.

*This is Logan Square.* 

The train barrels across the track, hitting what feels like inhuman speeds. I desperately wrap my body against the railing, praying that I won’t slip. I remember the man and glance up, but he is gone.

Wait. He’s not gone. He’s three cars down now. Standing… no, not standing.

I think he’s running towards me.

Smack. The train squeals to a sudden halt, and I am flung face first against the emergency exit, cracking my nose and falling to a heap on the floor.

*This is Belmont.* 

“See! This is what I told you!” Jay scolds as he runs to me. “You need to sit the fuck down. Stop psyching yourself out before you get seriously hurt.”

I look up at him as blood runs down toward my mouth. Cheeks soaked with tears, I pinch my nose and tilt my head back, reaching out for Jay. He does his best to steady himself against a seat as the train rears up again. Slowly, he helps me get my footing and I plop down into a seat.

I choke on my tears, trying not to wail. My head is pounding from the impact. When I try to let go of my nose, instead I sneeze, turning the seat in front of me into a miniature crime scene.

Jay looks at me, still annoyed but deeply concerned, takes off his jacket and hands it to me. I hold one sleeve to my face to stop the bleeding, and with the other, in a vain attempt to clean up after myself, I smear the blood around all over the seat. Jay nudges me, it is obviously no use, so I quit.

*This is Addison. Your safety is important. If you observe unattended packages, vandalism, or suspicious activity, inform CTA personnel immediately.*

I wonder if blood counts as vandalism. I feel a pang of shame in my gut, like I am getting scolded by my mother. -Your safety is important- I’m such a dumbass.

I lift the sleeve from my nose. The bleeding has stopped, finally. We’re less than five stops now and we just have to make it to our station, get off, and walk to our hotel.

*This is Harlem.* 

Didn’t I hit my head at Addison? We skipped like five stops.

*Next is Harlem.*

“Didn’t we just stop at Harlem?” I say.

“I…I don’t know… I think so. But that’s not right. It’ll be fine. Our stop is after Harlem. We just have to wait.” For the first time, Jay seems shaken.

I peer out the window, trying to get my bearings. The train comes to a stop and the doors swish open.

*This is Harlem. Doors closing.*

I nudge Jay. “Do you see that?”

Under a lone, flickering light in the middle of the station, there is a person. Standing bent in half, completely slack from the waist up.

“Stop,” he hisses.

My eyes are transfixed on the folded person.

*Doors closing*

Suddenly, in swift moments, the figure swings its legs out, one after the other, making haste in long, elegant strides towards the train car. The upper half of its body swings like a pendulum with each step. Please don’t get on the train. But to my horror, with two long swings of her legs, there she is. She keeps her same positioning even now, standing motionless in the middle of the car. Her long, matted hair brushes against the putrid, soiled floor.

As the train starts moving, she takes one step and sits in a seat at the back of the car.

Even now, I can’t look away. The car cracks and jerks along the rickety track. With every movement her body is tossed from side to side.

Through my anxiety, I still pity the girl. Her skin is smooth and young, not yet folded with the years of old age. And yet her clothes have lived a lifetime without her, soiled and full of holes. Her hair, in its knots, holds their own treasures. Small pieces of plastic, crumbs, and smatters of stretched out gum. I can’t smell her over the cacophony of scents that already lingers in the train car, thank God.

At full speed, the car jerks around the corner and the woman is flung from her seat, onto the floor. Her arm smacks violently against the paper cup, scattering its contents like heavy confetti.

When I was about 6, we got a phone call very early in the morning. Papa found Maw-Maw unconscious on the floor. He tried his best in his frailty, but he could do nothing but sit by her side. By the time the ambulance came, Maw-Maw was gone. I will never forget sitting with Papa on the couch, looking into his worn and tired eyes as he put a hand on my shoulder and handed me the gift my grandma planned to give me that weekend. A small pouch of chocolate coins. Little, flat, shiny tokens that almost felt real when you held it, and tasted like eating cheap easter candy out of an aluminum can. 

“She wanted you to have these. I did everything I could to make sure she could give them to you herself, but it wasn’t enough.” Papa said to me, choking back tears.

I remember, with my little hand clasped in my father’s hands, we walked into a funeral home, surrounded by quiet chatter, desperate sobs, and melancholic laughter. I saw Papa in the crowd of people, and we walked to him. 

“Do you want to see Maw-Maw?” Papa smiled and said to me. 

A little burst of joy ran through me. I couldn’t wait to hug her, tell her thank you, and that I loved her. He took my gentle hand in his warm and wrinkled fingers and led me through the room. Then, he lifted me up on his hip, just high enough to see Maw-Maw laying in her casket. She looked beautiful, dressed in a sparkly evening gown, just perfect for Maw-Maw. 

“I love you Maw-Maw!” I say enthusiastically. But she didn’t respond. 

I pet her face and touch her hands. I pull a little chocolate coin from my pocket and I place it under cold hands. I always heard that it took a lot to get to heaven, hopefully what I gave her would be enough. 

I look at Jay. “Should we do something?”

He looks at me, empty. I carefully stand up and make my way towards the woman. I kneel down beside her.

Drool pools like a puddle in her mouth. Her eyes are open, but lifeless, and she stares into nothing. I quickly push the woman to her side, drool pouring from her mouth. I put two fingers to her neck. Nothing.

“She’s dead”

Jay rushes over, flips her to her back, and puts his head to her chest. Nothing.

“We’ve got to do something! CPR, chest compressions, something? Anything?” I pleaded desperately.

“We don’t know where she’s been or what’s wrong with her. We have to focus on keeping ourselves safe. She’s made her choices already, so let’s make ours and leave it alone” Jay said coldly 

“But… We can..” 

“No!” Jay snapped.

I freeze.

I look down at the woman, far too young to be where she is now. It’s a beast I’ve never seen before, only online. Fent, that is. I’ve had my fair share of encounters, I’ve worked in rehab, I administered narcan. But nothing like this. This isn’t home, there is no Narcan. 

She’s made her choices, and now I’m making mine. I reach out for the woman as Jay grabs my arm. I shook him off. 

I use Jay’s bloodied jacket to prop her head up. With my sweatshirt I cover her torso. I stretch out and grab a few of the small, soiled coins and place them in her cold hands. Hopefully that’s enough to get her where she’s going. I lay a hand on her and look to the sky. God please forgive me for what I cannot do. 

The train slows to a stop, finally we can get off.

*This is Harlem. Doors Closing*

Jay runs to the door and tries to pry it open but it won’t budge. Frantically, he follows the seam of the door, pulling, trying to dig in his fingers. Growing frustrated he rears back, throws his fist into the door. But nothing. He takes a few steps back, and flings his whole weight against it. He bounces back, stunned, and I rush over.

“Please stop!” I scream

The intercom buzzes. “Attention please. We are standing temporarily for signal clearings. We expect to be moving shortly.”

“Well what do you want me to do? We NEED to get off the train. We haven’t seen anyone but a dead woman for hours and a homeless man for hours. We’re not getting fucking stuck here!” Jay screams furiously.

A tear runs down my face.

“Even if we get off now, I have no idea where we are going. My phone’s not working and yours is dead.”

He slumps down in a seat. “Then tell me what to do.”

I give him my phone. “Try to restart this. I’m calling the operator.”

I press the button near the door. It blinks, but nothing happens. I choke on my words.

“Please…anyone. Please. She’s dead and… I..”

I start to sob, releasing a tidal wave of tears that’s been building since we stepped foot in Chicago.

I press the button again. In my blurry vision I see a sign “Please wait for the green light before speaking.”

I back away from the intercom and sit down, eyes locked waiting for a green light. But all there is is more blinking. The gentleman’s prerecorded voice peaks through the car's speakers, but I can’t make out the words over the sounds of my own lamentations. Jay silently sits beside me and puts a hand on my head to calm me. I look back up at the intercom for the light, and I swear I see the man in the reflection of the window. I close my eyes tight. And then the train starts moving. 

*Next is Harlem. Doors open at the left at Harlem*

The train is calm again, moving at a steady pace. Just as I can feel my body start to relax, I hear a faint noise. A faint crackling noise, like fresh cereal in a bowl of milk.

The train starts to slow. Suddenly, the cracking gets louder and Jay and I jerk our heads toward its origin.

*This is Harlem.*

 The doors rush open.

In an instant, she slams her feet down, joints snapping into place with a deafening crack—her body twisting upright like magnets snapping together. In two long strides she hops off the train and sprints down the station hall, bounding up the stairs like a wild beast.

*Next is…*

Before I can get my bearings, the train car jets forward, faster than we’ve ever felt. As we bound down the track, holding onto whatever we can get a grip on. A once tolerable droning of everyday travel morphs into a deafening, nightmarish screech, akin to an air raid siren. I instinctively throw up my hands to keep the noise from bursting my eardrums, and Jay does the same. We are thrown from our seats, laying our full bodies against the vile corrugated ground to keep from being jostled any further. In an instant, the screaming stops. Gravity threatens to throw our bodies forward as the car comes to a quick, hard stop. The familiar whooshing sound of the doors felt like whispers in our ears.

*This is Cumberland. Thank you for riding the CTA Blue Line.*
