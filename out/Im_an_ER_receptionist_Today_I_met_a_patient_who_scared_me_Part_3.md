I’m back. I feel slightly better than yesterday. But this morning I woke up with the most awful taste in my mouth ever. And another agonizing headache. I took 5 acetaminophens and it still hurts but I’ll try my best. My breath was awful too. I brushed my teeth 3 times and ate 10 mints, but it won’t go away.What woke me up was a text from an unknown number. *“Melissa please. Help. I’m in HUGE trouble. Help me. Please call this number at 3:00am. – Travis.”*

I still don’t know what happened yesterday after I passed out. I know I woke up in Sam’s exam room with a cold compress, hyperventilating and with hot flashes. 

Also, for some reason, I don’t feel like myself. I feel like... I can’t explain. I answered the phone to my friend this morning and when I said “Hello”, it didn’t feel like me. It didn’t sound like me either. It sounded more deep than my actual voice and came out way more serious than I intended.Or when I was brushing my teeth this morning, I randomly blurted out “*AAAAHHHHHH*” when I was done. My mouth opened all by its own and suddenly let out the “*AAAAAAAHHHHHH*” without me wanting to. I couldn’t do anything about it.

Another weird thing happened on my way to work. As I walked across the street to reach the hospital I work at, my arm raised itself and pointed in the right direction. It felt like a “zombie arm”. It moved on its own, without me wanting to. I tried to get my arm back into normal position but it only worked after a few seconds. As I walked straight ahead across the street, I got a stinging sensation in my head. Like a migraine headache, it stung really bad around my eyes. I almost felt compelled to turn right but I had to go to work. I ignored all bad feelings and went into the hospital.The whole walk, I couldn’t get that message out of my head. Travis wants me to call him at 3am? Wasn’t he tied up and in shackles? How do I know this was him? Or someone else pretending to be him? And why 3am? None of that makes any sense.

More importantly – what’s up with ME? Why am I feeling so weird? I have a feeling it’s been getting worse since waking up in Sam’s office. Am I allergic to the IV he gave me or something? I sure hope Jason is back today. Because (yes, alright, fine, I will admit it) I miss him. I am very worried about him. Leaving work for 4 consecutive days does not seem like him at all. Something awful must have happened to him. I don’t know why, but it’s just an intuition I have.

Normally he wouldn’t stay off work for that long even if he were seriously sick.I do remember how he brushed off my experience on Friday, though. And how he frantically wiped that black stuff away. I know that another redditor pointed this out. “He has what the man had and now you’ve got it too”. But I can’t think of anything I might have. I don’t feel sick. I feel quite normal. Except for these weird intrusive thoughts I’ve been having.

Anyway, I arrived at my desk and the intrusive thoughts to leave and turn in the direction my arm pointed into earlier became stronger. I started my computer. I was a bit early. My shift hadn’t started yet. I can’t stop thinking about the message.

If the weird man came back to the ER to look for me and show me the video – wouldn’t it make sense that he would come back again? But if so, when would he? And what will he bring or show me this time? I am scared. But I did try to remember and recap what happened yesterday. So I was sitting here. The weird man arrived. He wanted to move towards me but was stopped by the salt bottles. He showed me the video. He told me the story of his dad and how he blames me for it. I was the one who made his father wait and he thinks his would have lived if I didn’t. that’s why he is angry at ME and not Jason or Sam. Wait... when was the incident? The man said his dad died 5 years ago. Around the same time Travis went missing. I figured I should check the patient archive and *OWWWWW MY HEAD OH GOD IT HURTS PLEASE KILL ME*. I tried to remember what happened before I was knocked out. Right. The weird man said he brought his father in here. What was the name of his father? Luckily my memory is a 10/10, so I remembered. It was someone named Joseph something. but surely the case would still be in the patient records somewhere. Maybe in the archive. There I could find all detail about the patient's history, clinical findings, diagnostic test results, etc.. I opened the folder with the patient record archive. what year? 2018. Yup. What month? September. Bingo. There was a file called “Crick\_Joseph\_Brian”. I opened it.

Before you say anything – what I do here does NOT break my obligation for patient confidentiality. I am not sharing any confidential information or any medical history records that could get me in trouble later. (and if I am, I’m just repeating what the weird evil man already told me). And this is an emergency so I MUST look up the info.

Anyway. I read the file, and it got confirmed that this Joseph person WAS indeed put in an artificial coma. And the machines had to be turned off. It was too late; we couldn’t help him anymore. But the signature at the bottom of the patient file looked strange. Joseph B. Crick was born in 1940. I remember that he couldn’t sign the paperwork himself. He was brought here by his son. So, it must have been the son who signed the paperwork as he checked his father in. I tried to decipher the name in the signature. It said “Peter crick”. So the evil man’s name is (likely) Peter Crick. HE’S COMING FOR YOU MMMMMMM. And this Peter person very likely knows Travis’ whereabouts.

I am too nervous to focus on my shift today. And I hope *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-*

I don’t know why I wrote that.

Whatever. I need to continue. My shift is starting in a bit. I haven’t seen Jason yet. Normally he should already be here. I’m really starting to think something happened. I don’t like this. It’s all so strange. Suddenly this man shows up, suddenly Travis shows up again, and suddenly Jason disappears too? Those are too many coincidences for my liking. Something does not quite add up here.
But another person is missing today. Where the FUCK did Sam go? I’m sure that the doctor should be the first one to be here when my shift starts. He’s always on time.It’s very strange that they BOTH disappear at once. None of this makes sense anymore. It’s getting weirder every day and I’m not liking this.

At least I have a clue now. I know the name of the weird man. Now I just need him to show up here again and somehow grab a hold of his phone.How will I do that? If you have any tips, let me know in the comments. I need to somehow... incapacitate him. But I have no idea how to pull it off.I would use chloroform, but I don’t have access to the med room. Same with using an epidural and sneakily injecting Peter with it. That would at least numb his legs for a while so he wouldn’t be able to walk. But then again, I’d need a swipecard to get into the meds room. The only two people who have one are Sam and the security guard. Sam’s not here, and there is no way I can steal or take the guard’s swipecard. So I have to try something else.

Also, I can't ask the security guard for help. He will laugh in my face and transfer me to the psych ward if I were to tell him what happened. No way he would take that seriously. I have to take matters in my own hands. Hmm. It looks like there are no other alternatives. If you have ANY ideas, give them to me. I NEED to find out where Travis is.

Oh by the way – I just realized the cleaner took all my salt away. Great.

And why do I keep having this very strong urge to run away from work and go where my arm pointed?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh, ok. Sam is coming through the door. But he looks weird. He’s looking kind of scared, stressed and sweaty. As if he really had to make a run. I might even say he looks shaken. Also, he is 45 minutes late. Is he hungover? I briefly laughed, raised my eyebrows, and then looked at him half-mocking, with a side-eye.

“Wow, YOU are coming late. And you haven’t called either. By the way, what happened to your hair?” It was only now that I noticed how messy and spikey his hair looked. Normally he wears dreadlocks and his hair is very neat. Sam didn’t answer. He just scurried across the hotel lobby. Alright, whatever.Back to topic - I can’t stop thinking about the text I got this morning. Was it really from Travis? and if it was, why does he text me exactly after a stranger shows up at my workplace and shows me a video of him? That doesn't exactly make sense. And why would he text me at 9:45am to call me at 3am the next night? All of that is very weird. Should I call the number or not? *AAAAAAAA YOU MUST CALL.*

What else did Peter show me in the video... what else was there? Right. He wanted Travis to sign something. But what? He asked Travis “will you sign now?”, Travis said “Fuck you”, and Peter then threatened to keep him hostage longer. But what was Travis supposed to sign? 
Travis worked as an insurance broker. He worked at the insurance the day he disappeared too. And he called me about having an ear infection and having been prescribed an antibiotic. (the SAME antibiotic that Peter slided to me on Friday). That was the last time I heard from him. Ever. So why did Peter kidnap Travis and hold him hostage right after his dad died? And what did he want from Travis? What did he need his signature for? Was it for something insurance-related? Why would he get so angry with Travis for NOT wanting to sign it?

And why did he exactly blame ME for his dad’s death? What role did I have in his father dying? I wasn’t the one who put his father in a coma, Jason and Sam did. So why is he angry at ME? All I did was do my job and say that his father had to wait, as we had other emergencies that needed immediate attention. He then yelled at me that his dad was also an emergency. I explained the policy to Peter and he was angry. That’s what I remember from 5 years ago. God, I feel so guilty. Perhaps it WAS my fault after all. I can’t help but feel kind of bad for him, regardless of what happened. *AS YOU SHOULD, YOU DUMB BITCH. NOW YOU WILL SUFFER.*

I tried to find more info in the patient records but there was no other useful information. But now that I had Peter’s name, I decided to give Facebook and google a try. Bingo. There he was. And wow. He had quite an abundant lifestyle. Apparently he owned a finca on Mallorca, and he ... How can he afford all of that? The only way to gather that much money as a bank clerk (his facebook says he is one) is by either winning the lottery or collecting huge amounts of life insurance.

Wait. No. Is this what I think it is?

I need to find out more as soon as my shift is over. I need to be prepared when Peter comes back here again. I gotta stop here. I will keep you posted when I can.

EDIT: No, IF. I'll keep updating you IF I can. I'm not sure at this point.
