For the past i dont now how many years well i know exactly how many years i have hated this life not necessarily my own life but this boring life on earth. Watching movies and TV shows really has affected my brain and i always go to sleep expecting some supernatural will occur when i wake up the next morning .I had tried every thing putting up charms when i go to sleep or researching about astral travels and how people have been able to go to other world through it . It has been about 6 years since i have been expecting something like that to happen.

But i thought to myself to put an end to it. i wanted myself to pull out from this world that i had created myself in my head that didn't exist i thought that maybe something really supernatural will happen and i will be able to live the life that i wanted to live. A  life full of hope and adventure and i would have gladly given up this life of mine to live that life at any cost. I thought that maybe that is something i always had been using to cope and escape from my real world problems, so i gave it up I STOPPED hoping for anything supernatural or out of this word to happen and when i went to sleep forever letting go of that hope that something will finally change.

The first few weeks i felt happier than i had ever been before . But something really were changing at that time that i had put up a blind eye to. The G string of my guitar that would always go out of tune or that face of a baby i saw when ever i entered my room. I thought these were mere nothings and coincidences cause i didn't want my self to expect something magical to happen to me again  and cling on to that world of imagination and runaway from my life. The "coincidences" that i thought that were mere nothings really started to pile up in my 3rd week. Now, at this point my house was filled with eyes that were constantly staring at me but i thought of this as something my brain was creating out of frustration.

Months passed, but i never stopped seeing weird things now i had been basically living with them. Everywhere i went i  saw them staring at me every moment. My life had been filled with them but i pretended not to notice them at all and kept continuing with my ordinary life. After about a month i stopped seeing those faces but the eyes haunted me every where i went. I started doubting if i was the only one who saw these things so i asked my coworker but he reacted weirdly. That's then i knew that something was wrong with me i hoped that just like how those faces disappeared these eyes would too but 3 months passed nothing happened. At this moment i started seeing eyes Infront of my mirror when i tried to see my reflection and in photos when i clicked a picture of myself. I started to look at my old group photos in my highschool days what i found shocked me there was just a big eye instead of me. I started to freak out i panicked I started vomiting because of the disgust but later those vomits would also contain eyes who would only look at me.

Several months had passed but one day i was able to astral travel a thing that i had not been able to do in my entire life. I saw a dark room whispereing one sentence in a loop "you want a different word?". At that moment i was happy that what had been a dream for so long would finally come true. My brain stopped thinking because of my happiness. I said yes in a loud manner the moment i answered yes i woke up. I was happy to know that i would be in a different world.

I RAN outside to see but what i saw was a world where there was no one and that word which resembeled mine a word where there were eyes every where staring at me constantly not only in my house but in the buildings, sewers, i look up tp the sun but there was a massive  eyeball looking down on my i was terrified i saw shadows of people i knew whispering i just saw shadows roaming around my i was so terrifies that i could have gotten a heart attack. Breathing heavily i continued to explore this world i saw dead bodies of people i didn't know. Bodies that were hanging in the streets.

I felt like i needed to leave this world i started to notice notice loud noises from the sewers. I cried and begged and cried so hard that my eyes would have popped out i begged so hard that my lungs would come out i begged and begged to get out of this world. 3 days i begged and cried. My vocal chords were destroyed. I realized that no matter how much i begged this eyes would just stare at me. One more month passed, then i realized everything. I was the one who chose this world i kept seeing eyes everywhere because i was still wishing for something supernatural to happen. Deep down i still hated my own world and at the end when i was given an option to accept that word i rejected it without thinking twice. As a result my own world rejected me that was the reason no matter how much i begged i couldn't go back. i thought to my self if i had answered "no" maybe i could have lived a live worth living with no eyes staring at me i would have made friends, got married and had children and lived an ordinary life.

At the end i grabbed a rope which was on dead body. I went up to a building i found a fan and i hung myself while i was surrounded my the eyes. I regretted the decision that i had made. When i was close to death i saw the faces that i used to see in my room that had disappeared surrounding me and staring at me. Thats where i closed my eyes forever. THE END.
