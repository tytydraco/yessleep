 **This was written shortly after moving into a trailer home in Minnesota. I was writing it both as a means of making an interesting story and also just as a way for me to explore what my extreme fear response is after I've calmed down. I did a mild proofread, (very basic fixed done while scanning over it) but I don't care enough about it to properly finish it. I thought some of you would find it interesting.**

*This room isn't good for my sleep. Maybe I'm just not used to the sounds of a trailer house nearing the start of a Minnesota winter halfway in the wilderness.* 

*The vent near my door is loose and full of small junk that accumulated from the previous tenants. All night it makes clicking sounds with a changing pattern I can never pin down. No matter how long much time I spend thinking about it. That vent has a special way of throwing the sound across the room. Sometimes it sounds as if there was a hard tap on the window right next to the head of my bed, but it doesn't quite sound like glass. Not that it stops me from freezing to listen intently for something beyond my curtained window.*

*There are always sounds outside my room. I'm sure part of it is snow building upon the roof and then falling off, sometimes small, sometimes large, and often I can hear it roll on the ground. The corner of my room is also the corner of the house so the sound wrap around me. There's also something about the paneling of this house. If something creaks at the other end I hear it through my walls, not because they are thin, but because there is some method in which the vibration moves through the walls. Is my brother rolling in his bed at one AM or was it snow drifting off the roof near his room? You can hardly tell the difference, and they both sound like it's happening just to the right of me, but at a distance, I just can't seem to measure.*

*There are animals here, I've seen a bunch of deer no more than eight meters from our porch. I even caught a glimpse of a bear cub not far down the road. We're those sounds outside an animal's step crunching the snow, was it my brother getting up to get water, could snow roll of the roof in such a pattern that it sounded like footsteps.* 

*And I know my neighbors come out late at night at least briefly, I have of them. About where I lay in my bed, there is a house not far behind me separated only by a single line of small trees as a fence, one to the left of me, further down but equally visible, and then one in front of me, past my sister's room and across a narrow driveway. Speaking of the driveway there's one right behind me, the neighbors to the left of me sometimes drive a vehicle home at 11 pm across it, one one of my neighbors likes to take their dog to do their business there. Even just an hour ago while I was writing I heard two people chatting no doubt on their way inside, and it's 1:30 am, and I know it was people because one clearly laughed.* 

*Sometimes I hear a sound I cant imagine a likely cause for. Like when I hear wood creek on the wall left to me, why would an external wall creek out of nowhere when there's nothing on the other side? It doesn't take much to get me thinking and it only takes some bad luck for it to spook me. I come across one thing mentioning a serial killer, an unfortunate event, or even a certain.kind of action scene in a movie and then for the next minute or so I'll be reminded of the many unnerving stories and topics I've researched, its probably my adhd that does that.* 

*And then the wall creaks, and some snow falls, or my brother rolled over. It throws you off and then the clicking of the vent which was quiet for about five minutes suddenly kicks back into action with the sound of a loud metallic tap on your window. Now you're reminding yourself what every on of those sounds could be, often the multiple of things it could be. And you listen to the sounds trying to reassure yourself that these things are actually understandable, and its just long enough to hear something different. Something you weren't prepared to explain.* 

*Now what you were doing before doesn't matter because these sounds will haunt you until you've figured it out. So you stop your breathing for a moment just to be sure and maybe it goes silent, or sometimes worse a number of things happen at the same time so it seems like something is happening in every conceivable direction. Then that's when you realize that weird sound from earlier that started the paranoid episode was more than likely your sister snoring irregularly, but just as you start to feel like the episode might be able to start winding down, the air ventilation system kicks on and its whirring mechanical wind muddies everything to the near indecipherable.* 

*Now for the next two to five minutes every single sound is causing alarm, and you are fighting the impossible battle of a single human minds coping and compartmentalizing the patterns of several unrelated systems, most of them rivaling the complexity of ecological systems still in research today on the fly, and you do it just praying that your monkey brain can construct a powerful enough illusion that you understand these things just long enough so you can calm down and get some sleep. You are at the mercy of unknowable forces outside of your control, put on edge by an irrational fear of your safety, forced to ride this train until those forces finally give you a predictable enough pattern that your heart stops pounding and you're brave enough to drown out the sound with some tv. Except every few days these forces show no mercy and send you a pattern louder and sometimes stranger than normal so that the amygdala is convinced there are things just outside your room moving in a way that doesn't make sense for earthly creatures to move, and it hits a climax! You jump out of your bed with 91 already typed on your phone and the flashlight on because you just can't be caught unprepared. For the briefest moment your brain conjures the most horrifying cause to this stuff outside the house. You either double down on it being impossible and pull the curtain from your window, or you go across the house to speak to your brother just so that you have security in numbers and he can tell you its nothing. Opening that window never helps, at night I cant make out anything unless it was only a fee inches away, between the double-paned glass and the trees blocking viable angles for moonlight, you just stare into black. Oh hey, we had some issues with out toilet plumbing, maybe the pipes were part of it. Or the cats, yeah, the cats.*

*At least two times every night I go through a panic mode where I have to rationalize all the sounds to calm my beating heart. I never feel okay until I can see sunlight through the crack between the window and its curtain. I haven't been here long enough for it to happen, but usually once every fifty days or so I'll get an intense feeling that I'm in danger. I'm always perfectly safe and it usually happens at night but its been light out a few times. I've never felt as much fear as I did when a garbage truck broke the silence of early morning while I was like that. If I ever experience that here I'll make someone stay awake with me until its over, I couldn't face that alone. The scary part of this is if I get used to it, if I come to accept these sounds then I would notice if something really was happening outside my window. If the horrors I pictured at the worst moment we're completely real would I even notice? I wouldn't, not unless the window broke.*  


  
**For those curious: I started sleeping normally about a week and a half after writing this story, and now although the sounds. Nowadays I'm so good at blocking the sounds out that I don't notice I'm doing it. And I did figure out what a lot of the rumbling footsteps are from though it does ruin some of this stories atmosphere to know:** >!?the trees outside my window have a short fence that the branches hit agianst when its windy. I wasnt aware of this at the time and the bulk of footsteps and unpredictability of the sounds were due to this fence.!<
