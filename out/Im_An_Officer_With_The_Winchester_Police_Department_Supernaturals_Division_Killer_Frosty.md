"Are you *sure* this is going to work?" Rudy asked as I placed a sturdy piece of duct tape on the back of a fresh-out-of-the-box Apple AirTag.

I shrugged, handing the device to him. "Hopefully."

If you're new, you can read what I've been covering in my therapy sessions: [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/comments/1gpe8cd/guide_to_im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police/)

He pressed his lips into a thin line and stared at me blankly before getting out of the vehicle. We were back outside of the Danvers residence. The plan was to stealthily stick the air tag somewhere beneath the scarf where the snowman wouldn’t notice it, which, was simple enough to execute with Rudy’s supernatural capabilities.

I watched as Rudy slowly made his way over to Killer Frosty, being careful not to slip on any patches of ice and break the thirty dollar piece of equipment. After a safe passage through the treacherous unsalted sidewalk, Rudy grabbed both ends of the snowman’s scarf like he’d done earlier, and slickly placed the air tag. At the same time, he leaned in to where its ear would be and whispered something. Probably another childish taunt. Then, he simply turned away and started making his way back to the truck.

Aided by his unnatural reflexes and knowing what to expect, Rudy expertly dodged the icy snowball the snowman had thrown at him. He smiled a sly, shit-eating grin, as he continued walking back to the truck, obscuring my view of Killer Frosty. In one last attempt to say “Fuck you,” to the thing, Rudy turned to flip the snowman the bird. But, it had once again disappeared.

Once he was back in the truck, I pulled up the app to start tracking the AirTag’s location. All we had to do was wait and see where it blipped to on the map, then *Bam!* We’d, hopefully, find a handful of missing children.

I frowned as the app finally loaded up. It read: signal lost.

A notification then chimed out as the AirTag came back online, though it seemed to be a little glitchy. The green tracking dot was all over the place. One second it would be on one side of town then the opposite the next. It went east then west then north then south. Finally, after a minute of this erratic movement, the dot seemed to stay in one place on the map. According to the tracker, Killer Frosty was in the middle of Providence Park, just before the outskirts of Winchester.

“You ready, Rookie?” I asked Rudy while changing gears.

He chuckled confidently, rolling up his jacket sleeves after fastening his seatbelt. “Let’s go get us a snowman!”

I nodded determinedly, turning out into the street, feeling way better compared to how I’d felt an hour ago. Things were starting to look up, but we still had a lot of work ahead of before we could rest easy.

Rudy called out directions as I pushed the pedal to the metal. Neither of us knew how long Killer Frosty would stay there before returning back to its spot in the Danvers front yard. After impressively cutting down a fifteen minute drive into an eight minute one,  I pulled into the Providence Park parking lot. After comparing the park map to the one on my phone, we found which walking trail would lead us closest to the tracker.

A look filled Rudy’s eyes, one I was starting to get to know well. He was thinking of doing something impulsive, and my gut was telling me he was trying to go in there guns-a-blazing.

As it looked like he was about to take off, I grabbed his forearm, demanding his attention. “Remember, we don’t know who or what’s out there. We go as quickly and quietly as we can, but don’t do *anything* until I’ve got a lay of the land. Got it? I cannot stress to you how important it is that we don’t mess this up, Rudy.”

That mischievous look in his eye was replaced with one of understanding as reason returned to him.

Speaking with only a nod, the two of us started making our way down the trail.

When we were about a quarter-mile away from the AirTag’s current location, something happened. The sky suddenly became overcast and gray. Snowflakes swiftly started falling to the ground as a flurry made its way through the area. As we continued along the path, the air grew significantly colder as a strong, icy wind blew through the trees, almost as if it was trying to push us back. Something told me that meant we were going in the right direction. Braving the cold, we pressed on.

My partner and I made our way off the walking path and stalked deeper into the woods.

Now, I’ve seen a lot of bizarre things in my time since becoming a cop, both human and supernatural side. But never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I’d stumble across an entire igloo in the middle of the woods.

Rudy and I first got a visual on the primitive structure when we were about twenty yards away from the clearing it was in. The faint glow of a fire burning inside lighting the area around it.

The both of us turned our stealth stats up to one-hundred percent as we drew closer and closer. Only when we got to the edge of the clearing did I get the full scope of what was going on. Killer Frosty, now somehow animated, was off in the opposite side of the clearing gathering firewood. Through the Igloo’s opening I spotted a couple of children wearing snow pants, winter coats, gloves, and beanies. There was no doubt in my mind they were the missing children. And from what I could see, they were sitting next to each other, huddled around the fire. After squinting my eyes, it looked like they each held a steaming mug of… hot chocolate?

*Had Killer Frosty been taking care of them?*

“Okay,” I very carefully whispered to Rudy as a rudimentary plan formed in my mind. “Do you think you can distract and handle the snowman while I get in the kids out of the igloo?”

“On it,” he confirmed, then he paused. "What should I do if things get dicey?" Rudy pointed to the large stack of firewood. "Do you think you could start a fire? He is made of snow after all, I could try to get him to melt."

My pockets were empty. The only things I had on me were my service weapon, badge, and my work belt, which didn't have anything useful for the situation. "Depending on how dry that wood is and the kind of enchantment on that hat, it might work. But I don't have a light. Don't suppose you have one on you either?"

He pressed his lips into a thin line, then he lit up. "What if you used your magic? I'm pretty sure I saw you use it to start a fire before. The other night with that match-"

"Rudy," I warned.

"H-hypothetically, then," he stuttered.

I shook my head. "Out of the question. Cursed objects have a sort of magnetic field surrounding them, so they're really sensitive around different sources of magic. If I did have magic and tried to use it on or around Killer Frosty,  who knows what kind of volatile reaction would occur."

"Well that's just great," my partner lamented, "I really wish I could've burned the motherfucker."

“I know, but you're smart. Resourceful. You'll figure something out. Now, on my count, you move then I’ll sneak in behind you. In one, two, three-“

After giving a hand signal, Rudy jumped out from behind the bush we’d been hiding in and ran over to our suspect.

“Hey big guy, remember me?” He taunted, eyes glowing red, waving the snowman towards him and away from the igloo. “Got anything else you want to throw at me?”

As if on cue, an ice ball was summoned out of thin air. Killer Frosty chucked it at Rudy, but he once again moved out of the way at the last second. “That all you got?” the revenant yelled, bending down and making a snowball of his own. With impeccable aim, the snowball hit Killer Frosty in the lower abdomen. This landing pissed the snowman off, causing its stick smile to frown and its twig eyebrows to furrow.

As the two of them engaged in a fierce snowball fight, I made my way to the igloo for a head count of the children.

After getting in the igloo I could confirm all five of the missing children were there, alive and well for the most part. Including David Danvers.

Being the first human being they’d seen in days, the kids lit up excitedly, ready to go home. Seeing the winter uniform and badge eased their minds even more, allowing them to follow my directives eagerly. We lined up follow-the-leader style at the mouth of the igloo.

I peeked my head out of the entrance, seeing Rudy was doing pretty well for himself, though he had a few bruises on his face from a couple of ice-balls hitting him.

“How we doing over there?” I shouted. “We’re ready to go.”

“Yeah, I don’t think it’s going to let us take them without a fight, Lucky!” my trainee worriedly called out over his shoulder. As tensions rose and Killer Frosty felt cornered, the snow started falling in droves and the wind picked up even more. We were in the middle of a full blown blizzard. It was so bad it was almost white-out conditions. “I’ve got a feeling only one of us is getting out of this.”

“Then give you him Hell, Rudy!” I yelled supportively, giving him the go ahead to do whatever he needed to do to end this once and for all.

The time for petty snowball fights and taunts were over. Rudy was in the ring for real.

He threw the first punch, but the snowman blipped a few feet away before it could land.

Having learned his lesson after his fight with Sage Walker, Rudy counter-balanced and righted himself quickly. He turned and used his enhanced speed to run up to Killer Frosty and throw another punch.

As expected, Frosty teleported away again. After a minute of this, Rudy seemed to figure out the snowman’s pattern while the two of them practically flew around the clearing. Finally, he was able to get his hands on the creature. With a solid grab, Rudy managed to yank both of the stick arms off, snapping them ferociously with his knee.

With the small win, he deciding to go after the main prize. The cursed object.

Sharp, icy shards exploded onto the top layer of Rudy’s skin as he swiped at the snowman’s magical hat. He grunted in pain before promptly smashing his fist against the creature’s head so hard the ice cube that surrounded his hand crumbled into a crystal dust, freeing the appendage.

The stinging pain pissed Rudy off good, so good that his eyes started burning a deeper shade of red. And surprisingly, in the aftermath of the punch, a good chunk of the snowman’s top snowball had fallen off.

Rudy continued to fight and I could see him coming up with a plan of attack from the look on his face. I had faith it was a good one.

Every time he went after the hat it would retaliate the same way, in which Rudy would attack with the same, if not more, ferocity.

The anguish worsened with every cry he let out as ice kept exploding out of different parts of his body with each connecting hit. But, every time this happened, he somehow managed to hit back even *harder.*

I had told Rudy not to underestimate the power of cursed objects before, but it looks like *I* should’ve known not to underestimate the strength of a revenant. They are supernatural fighting machines after all.

Before I knew it, Killer Frosty was no more. Its seemingly impenetrable icy core reduced to rubble. Though, that wasn’t the only thing that was destroyed. During his ambush, Rudy managed to tear everything to shreds. And I mean *everything*.

Cursed objects are not easily destroyed. Disposing of one with one’s bare hands is practically unheard of. Yet, Rudy did it, the impossible. I swear, with each day that passes his case only grows curiouser and curiouser.

Essentially, that top hat would no longer be a problem. Definitely not after I burned the remains.

“Ope, that’s not good,” I said to myself as Rudy took a faltering step. I ran out of the igloo to catch him.

His skin was ice cold to the touch and he was shivering like crazy. Rudy had used up a lot of energy during that fight and took some brutal hits. He was weak, bruised, and beat up, barely able to carry his own weight.

Using me as a crutch, he walked to the fire in the igloo to warm up. The kids sat around and comforted Rudy in his half awake state while I gathered all the torn pieces of cloth I could find.

After ensuring all the fabric had been burned up, I swiped my arm under Rudy’s legs and hoisted him up princess style, carrying him the whole way back while leading a horde of children behind me.

The first thing I did was radio for EMS and backup. These kids needed medical attention asap. And David, he needed to be reunited with his dad. Just as bad as his dad wanted to reunite with him.

Once help had arrived and the children were getting taken care of, I carted Rudy off to my truck where he could thaw out while the heat blasted. There, I also gave him a blood pack (filled with non human blood of course). After getting some sustenance in him, Rudy slowly but surely started to heal.

“Where did you get a bag of blood from?” Rudy asked as he came to, slurping the last bit of liquid out of the receptacle like it was a juice box.

“Well, I have you, a vampiric creature, as a partner/trainee. I thought it would be a good idea to keep a blood bag or two in my car in case of emergencies.” I chuckled, “good thing too. You were in pretty rough shape back there.”

Rudy exhaled, satisfied, crumbling the plastic bag, tossing it in the back seat. He turned to me and flashed a tired smiled. “Thanks for that, takin’ care of me.”

My heart started racing as the image of Dustin smiling at me after he’d lied about getting discharged from the hospital filled my mind. I balled my fists tight and blinked rapidly, reminding myself he wasn’t Dustin. And he wasn’t Henry either.

Rudy was Rudy. A former monster hunter turned revenant with memory loss. He might’ve been assigned to me as my partner, but that’s all he was. Nothing more, nothing less.

“You okay?” He asked, concern rife in his tone.

I inhaled, trying to calm my anxiety, playing it off by brushing a piece of my hair behind my ear. “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just been a long day.”

“Preaching to the choir,”Rudy said, starting to rubbing his hands together in front of the air vent. His skin stilled looked cold and raw to the touch. A silent moment had passed before he said, “Ya know, I-it’s fuzzy, but I got the general picture of the story.”

I furrowed my brows and stared at him in confusion. “What are you going on about?”

“The hat,” he took a beat, allowing me the chance to understand. When I did, I gave him a small nod to continue. “As I tore it up, flashes of these brief moments would appear in my mind, like I was watching a movie. It was as if the hat was telling me its story.”

Intrigued, I nodded along, rubbing my thumb under my lip in anticipation. “What is it? What’s its story, Rudy?”

A far off look filled his face as he recalled the memories the cursed object had shown him. “A Man. He took a little girl and together they hid in woods. I got the impression that he was protecting her from something. Whatever it was, it was dark and nasty. Their only option was to flee, in which they succeeded, but in the end they both died from exposure. The only thing left of the two was his top hat. The negative energy that surrounded the circumstances in which they perished caused the hat to become cursed. From then on who of whatever wore the hat felt the need to kidnap children who they deem to be in danger and keep them safe.”

“Damn…” was all I had to say. “That’s tragic.”

Rudy tried and failed to hide that he had wiped a tear from his waterline after finishing. He sniffled, glancing at me before putting his head down and twiddling with his thumbs. “Do you think I could go pick up my stuff now? Our shift is almost over and I’d like to see this apartment the division set me up with.”

“Of course,” I responded, straining to look out my driver’s side mirror at all the first responders that filled the parking lot. “I think some members of our Narrative and Damage Control unit just arrived. Once I talk to them we should be good to go.”

Rudy perked up in his seat, looking behind him at the young witches that occupied the unit. “That’s a thing?”

“Yup,” I told him, opening my door and jumping out. “I’ll tell you all about it on the way back to the precinct.”

“Damn this job might be cooler than I thought it would be,” I heard him mumble under his breath as I closed the door.

***

While Rudy was off getting his things, I decided to take a trip downstairs and pay Dustin a little visit. He was probably scared, confused, and all alone down there. After seeing how Jeff Danvers had faired going through the loss of his wife coupled with his child going missing in the span of a week, I figured Detective Davidson would benefit from seeing a friendly face. Even if our last interaction hadn’t gone so well.

I bit my lip upon seeing Dustin sitting there in his cell. He’d been forced into a straitjacket and muzzle. Small grunts and growls bounced off the walls as he swayed back and forth. Judging by the glaze over his glowing blue eyes, he’d been dosed with something to keep himself somewhat under control. I stood there for a minute, taking it all in. Stifling a cry, I turned away from the cell door, unable to see him in that state anymore.

The biker man who was in Lieutenant Dawn’s office earlier greeted me as we came face to face. Startled, I sheepishly greeted him back.

I hadn’t heard him come in behind me.

“I should get going now,” I said ducking out of his way.

The man didn’t say anything, just took a step forward. A step that led him right to Dustin’s cell.

Why would he-?

A chill crawled up my spine as I froze, finally recognizing the man standing next to me. He was Rafael Robbin, an Alpha to one of the werewolf packs in Winchester.

We never did figure out which pack Noah had belonged to, so if he was here at the police precinct then that could only mean…

“Relax, I’m not here to hurt you,” Rafael said as I drew in a deep breath. He could sense my apprehension. “I’m here for him.”

I took a cautious step back, taking the werewolf’s words with a grain of salt. “B-but that note-“

Rafael brought his hands to his hips and shook his head disappointingly. “Ma’am, on behalf of those idiots, I sincerely apologize.”

Hearing that, I didn’t know what to say. It took me by surprise.

“The wolves responsible for causing your distress have been reprimanded. At that time, they only knew that their pack-mate had been killed. Not that you had acted out of self-defense or that Noah hadn’t been in his right mind for weeks. That’s another thing I should apologize for. It’s my fault for not acting sooner. This all could’ve been avoided if-“

I put my hand on the man’s very big forearm, interrupting him. “It’s okay,” I spoke gently, trying to deliver a comforting squeeze. “I appreciate your apologies but it’s not your fault. What’s happened, happened. And from what I’ve learned, the best we can do is try to move forward from it and learn to become better people because of it.”

Rafael chuckled. “You’re very wise for your age, young lady.”

I shrugged my shoulders, easing up to him a bit. Rafael Robbin, one of the strongest alphas in the area, didn’t seem too bad. His physique was strong and powerful, demanding respect, but he carried himself with confidence and grace making him easy to talk to. “Since taking this job, it feels like I’ve been here a lifetime.”

“So,” Rafael said, steering the conversation back on course. “While my wolves were completely out of line with leaving that message, it does bear some weight. There was a reason you were being tracked down and it’s because of your friend in there. You see, in the aftermath of Noah’s death, I knew a new werewolf had been turned but not where to find him. At the scene, your scent was strong and overbearing completely masking his. It was faint, but not easily traceable. So to find him, we had to follow you.”

A spike of adrenaline shot through my veins as I began to panic. “Please, don’t kill him,” I begged. “He didn’t hurt Noah and he didn’t mean to hurt me.”

Rafael just waved my concern off. “I will do nothing of the sort. You seem to be misinterpreting this life for a life thing, my dear.”

I crossed my arms into my chest, waiting for him to explain it to me.

Rafael then asked me in a way that wasn’t really asking, “If it is okay with you, I’d like to take him in as part of our pack. In exchange for taking Noah’s spot, we’ll help him learn to control himself and function in the real world.”

I uncrossed my arms and looked at the man, hopefully. “If he goes with you, Dustin would be able to come back, right?”

“Once he gets everything under control, I don’t see how that’d be a problem. Besides a couple of things, his life would go back to normal. But, I don’t see why he’d be out of work. I thought you people employed supernaturals, no?” Rafael asked, confused.

“Yes,” I answered with a heavy sigh, “which is why, for the life of me, I can’t understand why he tried to hide it. Hide the fact that he’d been turned into a werewolf.”

Rafael shrugged. “Who knows, everyone reacts differently to the bite. But, it could have something to do with your scent. It really is *prominent*, you know. Maybe try a few little spritz of perfume here or there? It’s honestly starting to drive me a little crazy.”

With a nervous chuckle, I bid my farewell and pivoted on my feet, leaving Rafael to his business.

As I traveled back upstairs, an overwhelming pit formed in the bottom of my stomach as the little voice in the back of my mind started screaming at me. Regrettably, I knew what I had to do to stop it.

“Lucy?” Jane asked after she saw it was me who’d knocked on her door.

With an unsteady deep breath, I shakily admitted, “I’m ready to face the music.”

With a victorious smile, Jane quickly ushered me in to her office, gently closing the door behind her.

Edit: I think you’d all be pleased to know that  due to the extent of injuries to both of Milo Briggs’s hands, they were irreparable. He underwent a necessary double amputation operation, and because of the damage, wearing prosthetics will be very painful for him.
