“I’ll just take these boxes downstairs to the garage..”, I tell my boyfriend, Chase, putting another holiday serving platter in the cardboard box.

“I’ll take it for you sweetheart, I know how heavy all 100 of your Christmas platters are.” he says, smiling mischievously and kissing me on the cheek.

“Hey!”, I laugh, swatting his arm, “I want to be prepared if we ever have one of those Christmas parties like the movies where dozens of people come and I save Christmas somehow!”

He laughs, and picks up the box.

“You’re right, I need to be manifesting that for you.” He winks, and disappears down the stairs, shutting the door behind him.

My spring cleaning has run amuck in the house, but I think I’ve got the last of it sorted.

Our house isn’t huge, we have a 2 story house with 4 bedrooms. Beautiful exterior, I just wish it had more storage.

I smooth the bedspread on the (now cleaned) guest bedroom, and smile at the room, before closing the door behind me.

Chase is coming in from the garage when I come downstairs.

“Boxes all put away?”, I ask.

“Yes, but we officially can never buy anything else ever again.” He laughs, opening the fridge to grab a beer.

“Well when we get our next house, I need more storage. The attic is too small, and I want a basement. We can turn it into your man-cave too..”, I smile, wiggling my eyebrows.

He smiles at me, a lazy smile.

After 5 years together, he still gives me butterflies.

“Anything you want, sweetheart. And that goes for dinner too, what are you thinking?”, he leans back on the counter, opening a food delivery app on his phone.

“Chinese? I would love to learn how to make Mongolian Beef at home to save money, but unfortunately you do not love me for my cooking skills..”, I tell him, looking into the fridge with a sigh.

“Ah yes, how could I forget when you so infamously almost burned down this very kitchen the first time you came over. After you insisted you could cook us a whole meal?”, He sneaks up behind me and wraps his arms around me, making me squeal.

“See! I can’t possibly be your dream woman, I can’t even cook!”, I whine, between giggles.

He smooths my hair.

“I have everything I need.”, He says earnestly.

More butterflies.

Once our takeout comes, we are eating in front of the tv when I hear a tapping sound.

“Do you hear that?”, I ask.

“Hmm?”, Chase responds, not looking up from his takeout container.

“It’s a tapping sound.. Is it coming from the dining room?”, I put my food down, and get up to walk that way.

“Babe, I don’t hear anything. Could be a pipe, this house was old when I got it and it’s even older now!” He calls from the living room.

When I reach the dining room, I still hear it. I’m starting to pull out furniture to inspect when I hear a hard thump.

Then the tapping stops.

I rush back into the room, and Chase is picking up his beer bottle off the floor.

Foamy, brown liquid is now staining the rug.

“God, I’m so sorry. I reached for my beer and I knocked it off the table, could you grab me a towel?”, He asks, moving his food to the coffee table.

“Of course! I’ll be right back!”

I grab him a towel and we clean it together, comes right up.

“Did you figure out the tapping?”, He asks me, picking up our trash.

“Oh.. No I didn’t, must have been a pipe.”,  I respond, looking back towards the dining room.

He nods.

“If you want, I can call the plumber to come out and check everything. Just to make sure it’s not something important.”, He says, heading towards the kitchen.

“Oh no, I’m sure it’s fine. I’ll let you know if I hear it again.”, I smile.

*

Later that night, after we had gone to bed, I wake up with a startle.

I’m gasping, covered in sweat, and shakily looking for the switch to the lamp at my bedside table.

“Chase? Chase?”, I whisper.

The lamp flares to light.

Chase isn’t next to me.

“Chase?”, I say, a little louder.

Silence.

I get up, and walk to the bathroom. Sometimes when he can’t sleep, he will take a shower.

The bathroom is empty, but I take time to splash my face with water.

He must have wanted a midnight snack, he’s probably downstairs.

“Chase?”, I call out at normal volume.

I am just passing my doorway, heading towards the stairs, when I see Chase.

He’s halfway up, he looks relieved to see me.

“Sweetie, hey. Are you okay?”, He asks quickly, taking my hands and looking at my face.

“Oh, yes. I just had a nightmare, I think, I can’t even remember what it was about…”, I trail off, looking at him. 

He looks red, and like he broke a sweat running to the stairs.

“Are you alright?”, I ask.

“Yeah.. Yeah I’m good. Sorry, I went downstairs to watch tv and I must have dozed off. You calling my name woke me up and I thought you were hurt so I ran upstairs to check on you. My adrenaline is through the roof right now.”, He laughs, but it doesn’t meet his eyes.

“Oh honey,” I coo, “You’re my white knight, always trying to save me. What do you say.. We make use of that adrenaline..”

I playfully tease my finger on his shoulder.

He smiles and shakes his head.

“Oh I would love to, but I’m all frazzled right now. How about I take a shower and we snuggle instead?”, He asks, wrapping me into a hug.

“Of course, that’s probably the right idea.”, I respond.

Once he’s done in the shower, we do exactly that.

*

The next evening, Chase has his monthly work dinner. He’s an anesthesiologist, so the money is great, but his coworkers.. not so much.

“You sure you’ll be alright?”, He asks, checking his tie in our hallway mirror.

“Yes I’ll be fine,” I respond, we do this little routine every month, “I’ll catch up on all my obnoxious reality TV you hate.”

“Ah, I don’t know about that. TV is broken.”, He responds, still focusing on the mirror.

“Since when?”, I ask.

“Dinner yesterday, some of the beer splashed on the box. I’ll get a new one this weekend, don’t worry.”, He says smiling, turning towards me.

“But you were watching it last night, I thought. That’s why you came downstairs..”, I say, and it comes out sharper than I intend.

His expression doesn’t change.

“Oh, well yeah, I tried to come down to watch it. That’s when I noticed it was broken, so I fell asleep. Sorry, I thought I mentioned that.”, He explains with that easy smile.

“No worries, I’ll just read. Go knock them dead tonight, you always do!”, I say, giving him a good-luck kiss.

I wave at his car leaving the driveway, and I turn and go back to the living room.

I pick up my current book club read, and open up the next chapter.

I start to hear it again.

Tapping.

“Jesus, really?”, I say, putting my bookmark back in and heading to the dining room.

It’s softer tapping this time, but still steady.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

I take out my phone and send a message to Chase.

“Tapping is back, we should call plumber tomorrow.”

I put my phone in my pocket, and look around.

I pull up rugs, looking for any pipe leaking.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“This is so weird..”, I mumble.

I look at the China hutch, it’s been there since I moved in. It’s ugly as sin but Chase says it’s a pain to move. It belonged to his grandmother, I think.

If any pipe is broken, it’s behind that old thing.

I push my shoulder into it, and start to scoot it.

To my shock, it moves pretty easily.

I move it a few inches, when my phone starts to ring.

It’s Chase’s ringtone.

I hit the green answer button.

“Hey, sorry I know you’re driving..”, I start.

“Hey!”, He says, “So the tapping is back? Same room?”

“Yeah, I’ve been moving stuff around to see if there’s any water leakage but I don’t see anything..”, I trail off, looking at the floor next to the massive hutch I just moved.

“Oh, oh sweetie you don’t need to move anything around, you’ll hurt yourself. Just go relax in a bath, I’ll check it out tomorrow.”, He tells me.

He sounds off, I can’t tell why.

“Yeah, maybe you’re right. I just tried to move your Grandma’s hutch and it is pretty heavy.”, I laugh softly into the phone.

He’s quiet for a moment.

Then he bursts out in an exaggerated laugh.

“Yeah! It’s really heavy, such a pain! I’ll get the plumber to help tomorrow. Just.. Just don’t touch anything else tonight, just relax.”, He says frantically.

“Okay, I won’t..”, I reply cautiously.

“Ugh, I’m sorry. I’m just worried about you hurting yourself. I’ll deal with all that stuff tomorrow, just go and try to relax.”

“Okay,” I tell him, “I will.”

“Promise?”, He asks, and I can hear his blinker turn on.

“Yes.. I promise..”, I respond, still looking at the hutch.

“Okay, I love you. I’ll call you when I’m on the way home.”, He tells me, and I can hear him putting the car in park. He must be at the restaurant.

“Love you, bye.”, I tell him before hanging up, and sliding my phone back into my pocket.

Why didn’t he want me moving things? I’m not picking things up really.. I’m just.. Scooting. 

He seemed to get really stressed about me moving the hutch.

The tapping starts again.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

I don’t think it’s a pipe.

Maybe an animal got in the wall?

I put my ear up to the sliver of wall I cleared from moving the hutch and listen.

The tapping is coming from this wall.

Against Chase’s wishes, I put my side against the hutch and move it the rest of the way.

It moves easily, too easily.

I lean down, and notice tiny furniture slides have been placed underneath it already.

That’s odd, I’ve never seen this thing moved before.

When I stand back up, the wall seems blank, the wood paneling uniform.

I start knocking on the wall, trying to figure out if some critter is hiding.

Once I move over the panel directly in front of me, the sound changes.

The wall seems different here.

I run my fingers along the panel, and lightly push.

The wall moves.

I jump back, and gasp.

It’s a door.

It slowly opens, and reveals a staircase.

The tapping continues, and it’s louder.

I’m shaking by this point, how did I not know there was a basement? All our neighbors had one, and I was so confused why we didn’t.

I take out my phone flashlight, and head towards the stairs, slowly.

The tapping grows louder as I descend the dark stairs.

The light is shaking from my hands.

When I reach the bottom step, I flash the light around.

It looks like a seemingly normal basement, just some old boxes.

The tapping is coming from my right.

I shine my light over there, and I see a door.

With a key next to it, hanging on the wall.

I put my ear up to the door, and I hear the tapping mixed with soft music.

“What the hell..”, I whisper.

I try the door, but it’s locked. So I try the key hanging next to it.

It opens, slowly.

Warm light fills the basement as the door opens, and the music grows louder.

I look around the room, and it.. is not what I expected.

It looks like an apartment. There’s a couch, a tv, a hallway leading to more rooms. 

I follow the tapping to the kitchen.

There’s a woman standing there, at the counter. Her back is to me

But I can tell what she’s doing.

She’s chopping vegetables.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap.. 

The knife rocking back and forth against a wooden cutting board.

She chops something green and then slides it into a bowl.

“Darling! You’re early! Dinner is almost ready!”, She sings, turning over her shoulder.

She gasps when she sees me.

She steps back, holding a knife.

“Who are you??”, She demands.

“Who am I? You’re in my basement!”, I yell.

She studies me.

“This is my home, and I will kindly ask you to leave. It isn’t time yet.”, She says calmly, still holding the knife.

I’m in shock.

She has an apron, her hair and makeup are done, and she’s wearing heels.

“What is.. I don’t know what..”, I’m stammering. I can feel myself getting nauseous, and I’m trying to breathe.

Something over my shoulder catches her attention and she sighs in relief.

“Darling! I’m so glad you’re home, is this her? She seems confused!”, She says, putting the knife down.

I slowly turn over my shoulder.

And standing in the doorway, is Chase.

His face is a picture, it’s a mixture of horror and shock.

“Darling…?”, I whisper.

“Baby, I can explain.”, He takes a step towards me.

“Daddy!!!”, a little voice squeals from the hallway to my right.

A small boy runs up to Chase with his arms in the air.

Chase picks him up, but his eyes haven’t left me the whole time.

The woman walks over to Chase, and kisses him on the cheek.

“She is just dreadful, walking into my home and yelling at me? I thought she would be nicer.”, She shakes her head at me in disapproval.

“You thought… What??”, I shriek.

“I can explain, please just try to listen.”, Chase says, putting the child down and walking to me.

“Come on Liam, I’ll give you your bath..”, The woman says, pushing past us into the hallway with the boy.

“I’m going to be sick..”, I say outloud.

Chase reaches for me.

“Don’t touch me!”, I scream.

He freezes.

“How long?”, I demand, “How long has she been down here?”

He smiles sadly, and I have my answer.

“You’re disgusting.”, I seethe, “And we are done.” 

I push past him and head for the stairs.

“Baby. Baby, please. Just listen. This could work. Her name is Julia, and she is almost perfect. She can’t make me laugh like you can, we don’t get along as well. But she cooks, and she cleans, all the stuff you hate. So together, you’re a perfect woman. Am I wrong for wanting my two girls under one roof?”, He asks, crossing into the dining room with me.

“So you locked her down there???”, I yell.

“No! Well, yes, just until you were okay with the arrangement! And then we could all live together!”, He pleads.

“We’ve been together 5 years.. You’re sick.”, I whisper.

“Baby, just hear me out. This could work, you could be best friends, sisters even!”, He follows me up the stairs into our shared bedroom.

“We will not be SISTERS, I am getting my things and leaving, NOW! And you can have Julia and your SON!”, I scream, throwing things in my suitcase.

“You’re not even giving it a chance.. I thought you were different..”, He whispers.

“Yeah well I thought you didn’t want kids so we are both surprised right now.”, I say, slamming the suitcase and heading to the stairs.

“I already have Liam, I don’t need another. He wasn’t planned.”, He tells me, following me.

“I really don’t care anymore. You are sick, and disgusting, and I am leaving.”, I say, turning to face the door.

From behind me, his voice changes.

“I’m sorry, in advance.”, He says.

I feel a sharp pinch of pain.

And then everything goes dark.

*

When I wake up, warm light fills my vision.

Am I.. Dreaming?

I lift my head, I feel hungover.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

I look up and realize where I am.

I’m in the apartment, from the basement.

I go to stand, and I see my clothes are different.

I’m wearing heels, my hair feels curled, and I can feel lipstick on my lips.

Liam is sitting on the floor in front of me, watching an old cartoon.

I stand, and run to the door I entered from the last time I was here.

It’s locked.

I cry in frustration.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“Are you okay?”, a tiny voice asks.

I just stare at the boy, and shake my head slowly.

“I have candy, I can give you some, if you want.”, He states, with a smile.

I shake my head.

“No, thank you though.”, I answer.

“I colored you this, while you were sleeping..”, He shuffles papers in front of him before handing me a picture.

It’s a pink flower.

“Thank you…”, I say hesitantly.

He smiles at me, I think he’s waiting for me to say something else.

“Where.. is your mom…”, I ask him.

He shrugs, and turns back to the tv.

I turn around, and slowly step towards the kitchen.

Julia is cutting vegetables, for what looks like a pot roast.

Soft music is playing from a radio next to her.

When she hears me, she turns to me smiling.

“Oh good! You’re awake! You can help me make the salad.”, She says, handing me a head of lettuce.

“What.. What is going on?”, I ask her, looking around the room.

She puts down the vegetables, and crosses to me.

She puts her hand on my arm, and smiles sadly.

“I know this is hard, but trust me, it’s easier to just do what he says.”, She tells me.

“What do you mean?”, I ask her.

“Just trust me.”, She says, before turning back to her cooking, and that insufferable sound.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“W-Why.. Are you so calm?”, I ask her.

She puts her knife down, and turns to me.

A forced smile.

“Chase and I used to fight a lot, he said it wasn’t working. And it wasn’t, he was right, but then I was pregnant.. And it was.. A wonderful surprise..”, She says, smiling at Liam engrossed in a kids show about a boy with a magic flute.

“Liam is my life,” She continues, “Chase made me an offer. He said if I stay down here, cook dinner for him every night, clean the upstairs when asked, and get along with whatever new wife he brings in, listen to his cues, basically be on-call for all his.. needs. He will take care of us financially forever. I don’t have any family, any education, and.. he’s helping me.”, She smiles tightly.

It doesn’t reach her eyes.

“His cues?”, I ask.

“Like if I’m being too loud, he will stomp his foot or something as a warning. He gets upset if I don’t listen, so you’ll have to learn that..”, She says, turning back around.

The beer bottle.

He didn’t accidentally knock it over.

“So he expects me to just.. live down here?”, I ask.

“Oh no, not forever. Just until you’re trained.”, She answers bluntly.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“He thinks we can be the perfect wife..”, She whispers, putting the lid on the Dutch oven.

“And besides..”, She says, putting the roast in the oven, “He tells me we can teach each other things, maybe you can give Liam a sibling one day.”

I’m going to be sick.

The clock on the wall chimes.

“Oh, Chase will be here any minute. I’ll pick up. You, check yourself so you look perfect. He likes that.”, She rushes out, before disappearing to the living room.

In her movements, I finally see 

She’s terrified.

I hear the door begin to unlock.

“Quick!”, she says, “Clear the dishes for me off the counter!”

In a haze, I turn around and put the cutting board and dirty bowls in the sink.

The door opens.

“Honey’s, I’m home!”, Chase’s booming voice calls.

Julia goes up to him immediately to offer him a kiss.

I’m still standing by the counter, when he approaches me, ruffling Liam’s hair along the way.

“And how are my favorite girls today?”, he says, but directed towards me.

I see Julia over his shoulder have a panicked look on her face.

And I don’t know why, but I want to protect her.

I give him an easy smile, like I used to.

“We are great, Julia and I are fast friends, and she is a whiz in the kitchen! Would you like your salad now?”, I smile.

His eyes sparkle in happiness.

“Yes I would, thank you,” he kisses my forehead, “I’m going to go wash up, let’s go buddy.”

He takes Liam down the hallway to where I’m assuming the bathroom is.

“I’ll set the table.”, Julia says, lightly touching my arm.

Then she mouthes “thank you” before turning away to the table.

I watch her with curiosity, while I hear Liam giggling down the hallway.

I will save them both.

I clutch the knife behind my back that Julia was chopping the vegetables with, and slide it into my apron pocket while Julia’s back is turned. 

I will save all of us.
