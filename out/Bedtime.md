For most people at my age, sleeping is their favorite time of the day. The time when you escape all of your problems and trouble. The moment of peace and silence can change people. But for some people, bedtime can be a nightmare. And those people are afraid of sleeping. The feeling of being without controll on their choices and their reactions, can be extremely creepy. Just think about it for a moment, You close your eyes, and you start to hear things and see thing that are not real, but for you... they are. And you don't know what they really are.

My name is Richard, and I am going to tell you my story... I hate to talk about it, but I feel like I have to. My story begins like this.

When I was a 17 year old student, things didn't go as planned. I wanted to be successful, and make my family happy. see, my parents didn't get along together, and the vibe in our house was toxic. So I thought that if I will be good at school, then it will bring some joy into their lives. Most of the time I was just spending outside with my little brother. Alan. Alan and me were kind of best friends. He was full with excitement when I was with him, I really didn't know why but I liked it. He made me feel important and desirable, which was something that I didn't feel at most of the time... I was kind of lonely in my school, everybody was making fun of me because of how short I was... Everyone except for Alan. So I could not imagine a world that I am happy without him... Alan was 11 and he was so childish and he always made me laugh. Even at my worst moments, he was there, smiling to me.

One morning, I woke up to the sound of sirens. It wasn't the first time it happend... My father was in jail long time ago for using drugs, so I wasn't suprised. I just hoped he didn't use again, even thogh my father was not the best dad ever, I still loved him. But when I opened my door, I saw something I didn't expect... I saw dad and mom crying uncontrollably. That was rare. They never cried, and the fact that they did, scared me the most. It was very early, and the cops weren't just here. Something bad happened. After some time, I managed to calm down my mom, while my dad was talking to the policeman. I asked her " Are you okay ? what happened ? " while I said that, her hands began shaking and I knew that her heart was racing. Then, she said very slowly...

" It's... It's you-your broth-brother... He is missing " As soon as she said that... I lost myself. The only one that I felt a connection with... The only one that was really close to me... Is gone. I went straight into his room. I opened the door and I didn't see him. I opened his closet, and he wasnt there. I searched everywhere, but he wasn't there. All of a sudden my hand hurt,, and I couldn't breath. But it didn't make any sense... Why him ? He didn't harm anyone, he was a good kid. So why him ?

when a person is missing, every day that passes by, the chances of returning become lower... But when its a 11 year old kid, every day is like a week.

Three days have passed, three days that I couldn't sleep, eat, drink or even laugh. Nothing was the same anymore... Nothing made me feel happy... And dad ? He started using drugs again. I didn't tell anyone but I saw him and I was disappointed. It didn't take long for mom to notice it. They were arguing even more since Alan went missing. At one point, it was too much, and dad left the house and never came back. So it was just mom and me... Alone.

Four days have passed, and I was exhausted. And I felt that if I will not go to sleep I will officially go crazy.

" Sweety... " mom said. " I understand your feellings. But you have to go to bed. You can't stay like that forever..." I knew she was right. But I was afraid... What if I will see Alan ? But I had to sleep. " You're right" I said. And so... I opened my door, I went to bed, and I closed my eyes.

In my dream, I saw dad... staring at me. He was disappointed as if I did something wrong, But I didn't know what. He looked sad...But he wasn't mad. I never saw him like that. Slowly, dad began to move further and further... but he kept staring at me. And then I woke up. I looked at the clock and it was 11 AM. Usually, I would wake up at 7 AM to get ready for school. But as I said, nothing was the same.

I never believed in dreams or nightmares. Some people say that they have meanings, and that dreams are special. But it seemed to me that it was all lies. A dream is a dream and a nightmare is a nightmare. They are random, they mean nothing.

I didn't think much about that night. I knew that my dream was a bit strange, but it didn't bother me. I didn't really care. I was glad I managed to sleep. At dinner, mom and me didn't say a word. It was like we didn't know each other. I asked her " Whats wrong?" and she said "Nothing" but I didn't believe her... I finished eating and went into my room. "I am so tired" I said to myself. It was getting kind of late, so I got into bed, I laid my head on the pillow, and closed my eyes.

In my dream, I went to brush my teeth in the bathroom. When I was done, I fixed my hair with both hands. Then, I smiled to the mirror but... the figure didn't smile back. I was in shock and couldn't believe it. I tried to smile again, but the figue in the mirror still didn't smile back. But then, the figure got angry. It started pointing at me. It was like me in the mirror hated the real me. The figure started to crack. I didn't even touch it, it did it on it's own. It kept cracking until I couldn't see my face anymore...

I woke up. This time, I was frustrated. It was the second time that I had a strange dream. I thought that was weird and it kind of streesed me out. I didn't believe in dreams, but they were different. It was like they tried to tell me something that I did not understand. But I denied it.

During the day, all I could think of was that dream. But I didn't tell anyone about that. If I would, everybody will think that I went crazy and that I have issues. Even if I would've told my mom, she would not listen. She never did. Everytime I talked to her, she would just ignore me. She didn't seem like she cared about me enough to help me. At that time, it was even worse.

At around 11 PM, I got tired again. Usually, I would just go to bed at around 12 PM, but I felt so exhausted ever since Alan was lost. so I went to sleep.

At the third dream, I was playing games with Alan. I couldn't remember what games we played, but it was so fun. Then, we went to a restaurant to eat some pasta, his favorite... When we were done eating, we went to the park to play hide and seek. I remember when I thought to myself "What a beatiful day it is" it was too good to be true. After all of that, we went home. Alan was so happy, he was jumping from joy. Once we made our way home, Alan went to rest in his room, and I went to my room to think about everything that Alan and me did. But then, the dream became a nightmare. I heard Alan screaming for his life. I rushed to his room but the door was locked. I called mom but she wasn't home. I tried to kick the door but it didn't work. It was like something was blocking it from the inside of Alan's room. But then all of a sudden, the screaming stopped. But I heard Alan, suffering from pain, saying "I-I wi-wii-wiil never for-g-iv-e you, but I wi-wiil alw-a-ys love you" I shouted his name but he didn't answer.

I woke up... and I was in shock. The dream... it terrified me. I knew that they weren't normal. But Alan's words... they made me feel uncomfortable. He died in my dream... but who killed him ? who would do such thing ? I wanted to vomit and I became sick.

But then, I started to try and connect my dreams together.

My first dream, The disappointed of my dad's face symbolized my disappopintment. In the second dream, the cracking in the mirror symbolized my regret. The third dream, meant that it was my fault...

All of these dreams combined together meant that it was my fault, that I regret, that I am disappointed. They made me all realize...

I KILLED ALAN.
