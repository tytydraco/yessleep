I don’t live there anymore. I moved away from Flint Hill, and I’ve tried to forget most of what happened that summer. But sometimes, especially when the nights start getting warm like they used to, I think about it. And when I do, I can't shake that feeling of something being wrong. Something lurking in the air that made it impossible to breathe.

The night we went to that party, the air was thick with a dry heat that felt unnatural. Summer in the North isn’t supposed to feel like that—it's supposed to be a brief break from the constant chill. But that night, it felt like the town was holding its breath, and so was I. I remember how the sun was setting, casting a dim orange glow over the trees as I walked behind Yazmin.

Yazmin always knew how to make everything feel exciting, even when it shouldn’t have. She was the one who convinced me to go to that party. She’d been talking about it all week, telling me how everyone would be there, how I’d finally “fit in.” I should’ve known better. I should’ve listened to that nagging voice in the back of my mind, but I didn’t.

We walked down the street, past rows of houses that all looked the same, but tonight they seemed different. Darker. Their windows reflecting the orange sky, empty but watching. The world around us felt quieter than usual, and the closer we got to the party, the heavier the air seemed. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as we approached 901 Greenley Lane.

The house stood there, huge and imposing, like something straight out of a movie. Columns, a manicured lawn, sleek cars parked in the driveway. The kind of house that felt like it was designed to be perfect, to intimidate. I didn’t belong there, and I knew it. But Yazmin was already walking up to the door, her eyes glimmering with excitement.

“Come on,” she said, glancing back at me. Her voice was too bright. “It’s going to be great. You’re going to love it.”

I followed her inside, though my feet felt like they were glued to the floor. My hands were clammy, and my throat was dry. The moment we stepped into the house, I could feel the atmosphere shift. It wasn’t the usual buzz of a party—it was darker. The bass from the music was so deep I could feel it in my bones, and the red strobe lights flashed wildly, making everything look like a nightmare.

The house was packed. It was a mix of older kids and people I didn’t recognize, all of them laughing, talking, too loud, too sharp. It felt like they were trying to drown something out, but I couldn’t figure out what. And then I saw them—the girls, standing around in their designer clothes, looking at me like I wasn’t even there. Their smiles didn’t reach their eyes, and something in their gaze made me want to turn around and leave right then.

I wanted to leave. But Yazmin was gone.

I looked around, trying to spot her in the crowd. I felt lost, the walls closing in on me. The music was pounding, vibrating through my body, but all I could hear was my own heartbeat, quick and frantic. I couldn’t find her.

I turned around, hoping to see her standing nearby, but there was nothing. No one.

A cold sweat broke out across my forehead. It wasn’t just that I couldn’t find her—it was like she’d never been there at all. The air felt colder. The room felt emptier. The music had stopped, but no one seemed to notice. It was as if the whole world had held its breath, waiting.

That’s when I heard the voice. It was just behind me, close enough to make my skin crawl.

"She’s not the same anymore."

I whipped around, panic rising in my chest, but there was no one there. Just the shadows shifting in the corners of the room, stretching long and thin.

I stumbled backward, my heart hammering in my chest. The house seemed to stretch, the walls warping around me. I reached out, my fingers grazing the edge of a table, but it felt wrong—like I was touching something that wasn’t meant to be touched. The wood was cold, too cold.

I had to find Yazmin. I had to get out of there.

I pushed through the crowd, but no one seemed to notice me. Their faces were too still, too vacant. The room felt like it was holding its breath, just like the air outside, thick and suffocating.

And then I saw her.

Yazmin was standing across the room, but something about her was wrong. She was too still. Too silent. Her smile was wide—too wide—and her eyes... her eyes were black, like there was nothing behind them.

I froze. I couldn’t breathe. My body locked in place, my heart thumping painfully against my chest. Yazmin was no longer Yazmin.

I called her name, but it was barely a whisper. Her head tilted slightly, as if she heard me but didn’t really care. She didn’t move. Didn’t acknowledge me.

And then, I saw it. In her hand.

A knife.

I don’t know how it happened, but I turned around, and I was running. The strobe lights were flashing again, blinding me. The house seemed to grow, to stretch around me like some monstrous thing. The laughter from the party had turned into something else—something guttural, like an animalistic growl, echoing through the walls.

I reached the door, but it wouldn’t open. My hands were shaking so badly I couldn’t get a grip on the handle. I pounded on it, my fists scraping against the wood, but no one came.

Then, just as suddenly as it started, everything went silent.

I don’t know how long I stood there, pounding on the door, screaming for help. But by the time the door finally creaked open, the house was empty. The music had stopped. The laughter had died down.

And Yazmin was gone.
