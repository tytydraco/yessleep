Twenty-four times.

  
  
I’ve likely died twenty-four times.

  
  
I don’t have superpowers, some mythical gift, or anything that would otherwise warrant this survivability.   
  


I’m just some below-average undergraduate researcher that just so happened to stumble upon some of the most significant yet disturbing evidence in scientific history.  
  


First, let me start by introducing myself; I’m Finn. I’m twenty-five, somewhat un-outstanding, and deeply haunted by my scientific prowess. I graduated from a local community college med-tech program four months ago with barely passing marks and scored a largely under-paying job at a local hospital. For the first few weeks everything was relatively normal. While thrilled to be making more than my previous line-cook position I still owed north of seven-thousand in student loans, so my income was scarcely spent recreationally. It hardly bothered me though, as my colleagues were rather enjoyable to be around and I’d begun to consider a few of them acquaintances. Likewise, my supervisor, an old doctor known for his cane and dated sense of humor, was amiable with my need for more hours.

  
  
Fast forward one month, and we’ll find ourselves at the start of this shitshow. The building had been expanded, and the new wing included a brand-new MRI machine. One of my responsibilities was to calibrate the machine, which entailed a full shift of sitting at the desk in another room and repeatedly setting it off for seven hours. Overall, it wasn’t that bad of a deal. I got to basically sit around all day and still get paid for it, so I certainly wasn’t complaining. However, around hour three I’d become mind-shatteringly bored. The room I was in was still being constructed, so the only outlet that worked was the one the MRI-linked computer was connected to. Unfortunately for me, I’d forgotten to charge my phone the night before and couldn’t unplug the expensive medical equipment to do so.

  
  
Then an idea came to me.

  
  
Considering that I was unattended with the machine, and freshly trained to operate it, I chose to start scanning myself out of sheer curiosity. The calibration was done for the most part, so I had a whole four-hours to kick back a bit. Even then, the old man told me to use the full shift to practice how to use it regardless.

  
  
So, with the help of a colleague I enlisted, I did nothing but scan myself using the world’s most expensive photocopier for two hours.

  
  
For the most part, I saw nothing out of the ordinary. Every image returned on the screen in the adjacent room looked relatively bland, and nearly identical to what could be found online with a simple search. All-in-all, I’m sure it’s a great analogy for how we’re all the same deep down, but regardless I was still somewhat letdown by the results. 

  
  
By that point, with time at my disposal and my colleague having left for the evening, I sat in silence and meticulously combed over each of my scans. With some luck I was hoping to maybe find something interesting, or at the very least pass the remaining time on my shift.

  
  
However, there was a single thing that stood out very faintly in every scan of my chest.

  
  
On the far-left side of my heart, extending almost unnoticeably, was a tiny set of lines. They were hardly visible and could only be viewed with twenty-twenty vision and the scan zoomed into its maximum setting. Even then they were hardly perceivable, but something about the strange uniformity of the lines caught my attention.

  
  
I summoned the old doctor to look at it, and he was largely unimpressed. Stating that it was simply background noise that made itself visible, he ran himself through the machine as well to prove his theory. However, upon closely inspecting his results as well, his heart showed the exact same barely distinguishable lines.   
  


In fact, he actually had far more than me. After painstakingly counting the nearly pixel-wide lines on both of our scans, my total came out to twenty-three, and his thirty-seven. By that point we’d consulted a couple other doctors in the building, including a cardiac specialist. Everyone showed evidence of these lines, but nobody had a clear explanation for them and largely dismissed them as noise. With more questions than answers, both me and the old doctor left for the day and figured that it was likely nothing significant.

  
  
This is where things began to get somewhat weird, however. The following morning, as I was heading back to work, I’d dropped my phone and was reaching for it as I drove through an intersection. Through some sick luck, someone honking in the distance caught my attention enough to look up at the road once more, only to realize that a truck had flown through the red light and was in a collision course for my car. Since I’d noticed this in time, I was able to swerve out of the way and make it to work unharmed with an exception to the experience having shook me up bit. I walked into work and was once more instructed to go calibrate the machine again. Some intern had completely butchered the settings I’d spent a whole day perfecting, so to my dismay and somewhat happiness, I’d earned another day messing with the medical fax machine.

  
  
As with the previous day, boredom kicked in and I ultimately ended up running myself through the machine again. Remembering the same lines from the day before, I looked at the scans and attempted to find them again. Not only did I spot them once more, but they were somewhat different this time. Instead of twenty-three, I then had twenty-four. Thinking back to the close call from that morning, I’d begun to wonder if extreme stress perhaps played a factor in the marks; and ended up summoning the old doctor yet again. To my surprise, upon hearing about my close call that morning, he likewise stated that on the way back home the previous day he’d similarly also been nearly pancaked by an oblivious driver. It hardly bothered him however, and he shrugged it off with a laugh as he looked at the screen. Upon noticing the new line on the screen, and with little explanation for it, he instructed that I run him through the machine again as well.

  
  
To our surprise, he likewise had an extra line. Now intrigued by this strange phenomenon, the old man called down the same doctors as the day before and ran them through the machine again. Four out of five of the doctors showed the lines, but not no change from the day before. One of them, however, had gained an extra line.

  
  
Upon questioning him as to any significant events that happened recently, he jokingly mentioned how the night before he’d almost consumed a dish containing shellfish, something he was highly allergic to, at a restaurant. Had someone at a nearby table not complained about their seafood being undercooked to their waiter, he would’ve never noticed and likely suffered a fatal reaction in that establishment.

  
  
With all this strange evidence stacking up, the old doctor and I enlisted a few more colleagues and set out on our own small research project. Having linked near-death experiences to these strange lines, we set up a basic experiment where ten of the co-workers we enlisted would scan themselves each day. If something happened on or off the clock, where at least one extreme outcome could have resulted in their demise, everyone was instructed to record it in a notebook. For the first two weeks, the pattern continued. While there was certainly noise in the measurements where things such as tripping on the sidewalk were attributed to these experiences, the overall results were for the most part indicative of this phenomenon.

  
  
If there was a relative near-death experience, an extra line was usually gained without fail.

  
  
Eventually, word of this spread throughout the hospital relatively quickly, and a select few other doctors offered their assistance as well.

  
Specifically, a doctor from the ICU unit offered some insight. Upon hearing about our experiment, he took it upon himself to test the validity of it in his own ward. A critical patient, a middle-aged man with a tumor in his lungs, had nearly passed away a few days prior. Had a passing nurse not noticed his vitals dropping rapidly and acted to stabilize him before he flat-lined, he almost certainly would have died. As expected, an MRI scan before this showed eighteen faint lines on the left side of his heart. 

  
  
After the fact, this number had increased to nineteen.

  
  
With the doctor’s suggestion, and permission from this individual, we were able to enlist the end-of-life patient into our experiment.

  
  
The overall procedure was relatively simple, the patient would be placed in a separate room of the hospital, checked up every twelve hours, would be asked to record any significant events they noticed, and then subsequently be sent through the machine accordingly.

  
  
I should add that the patient agreed to only be resuscitated once, and after that would be DNR, meaning he’d be dead for good should he flat-line.

  
  
With everything set up, the new phase of the experiment began without incident. For the first week nothing changed, and the patient didn’t get any noticeably better or worse. The Monday of the following week, however, the patient stopped breathing during a bi-daily checkup and was immediately brought back once more.

  
  
As expected, the number of lines on his heart had risen from nineteen to twenty.  
  


The patient, standing by his request before starting the experiment, was thrilled to be contributing to the scientific cause, but likewise reminded us that he’d rather not be revived again.

  
  
With that, another three days went by somewhat uneventfully.  
  


The patient stayed somewhat stable, and the other colleagues participating likewise didn’t experience any change. Everyone had the same number of lines on their heart. No more, no less.

  
  
By day four of no change, things once again got interesting.

  
  
During one of the check-ups, the patient mentioned how he’d felt a stabbing pain in his chest the night before which subsided somewhat rapidly within twenty minutes. As usual, the patient was run through the machine, revealing that he then had twenty-one lines.  
  


Speechless at this strange pattern, and with little scientific explanation for it, the experiment continued.

  
  
Unfortunately, the patient passed away that night.

  
  
Between checkups, with no medical personnel nearby, and only a lone security camera in the hallway bearing witness, he started screaming. Not normally, mind you. This wasn’t a scream from basic physical pain, it was a deep, guttural cry of fear in its purest, unadulterated form.

  
  
It continued for five minutes.

  
  
By the time someone was within earshot and rushed into his room, he had already passed away for good. Utilizing the permissions he granted us at the start of the experiment, we ran him through the MRI one last time before wheeling him down to the morgue.

  
  
To our surprise, all the lines had vanished. Not even the most remote trace of them could be found. To those not familiar with the medical field, such a significant anomaly vanishing from someone’s body overnight isn’t exactly common. Having mentioned concern of his death along with the strange circumstances surrounding it, an autopsy was performed; only to reveal that he’d passed away from alarmingly natural causes. The lines on his heart were no longer there, and nothing except for the tumor in his lungs stood out as abnormal.

  
  
With that, the experiment ended, and each of my colleagues collectively agreed to try and move on for the sake of our own psychological well-being. Despite the medical significance of what we’d found, nobody was willing to continue, and we simply buried our findings and tried our best to move on with our lives. We’re still not sure what exactly we discovered. Ideas such as quantum immortality and such were thrown around, but we lacked significant enough evidence to make any theory stick.

  
  
The fact that haunted all of us, however, was that each line emerged following near-death experiences. The old man somewhat grimly theorized that each line signified a close call, or potentially an instance where death would have normally occurred. The only question we were left with, is how many of those lines each of us could accrue before we bit the dust for good. The old man and I already had far more than that patient, and judging by the seemingly terrible circumstances of his demise we’d be lying if we claimed that we weren’t somewhat unnerved.

  
  
As for why I’m uploading this, I’m still not too positive. I’m frankly not sure if I’m whistleblowing on the experiment that I personally created, or perhaps just trying find some insight and peace of mind. 

  
  
Regardless, thanks for bearing with me on this long-winded account and do be careful. It seems we have a set number of retries, and from what I witnessed, it’s better to avoid seeing what happens when we run out.
