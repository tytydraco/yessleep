Finding the door unlocked, we entered quietly. The reception desk was dirty, and the lights were losing their battle with the shadows that danced around the room.  
  
“I’ll be right out!”  
  
Kate fell back into the door in fright, and I felt my feet leave the ground. Before either of us had recovered enough to respond, a doctor poked his head out from a door in the hall, his pristine white jacket mercifully catching and amplifying the light from above him.  
  
“Come on back.”  
  
We looked at each other, both uncomfortable as he slid back inside. Kate motioned to go forward, and as we moved toward the room I took a look behind the desk to see if there was anything I could pocket for protection. Aside from the monitors, the desk was completely bare. No papers, pencils, pens or even keyboards.  
  
The lights in the clinic’s examination room still struggled against the darkness, but mercifully the room was small enough that they illuminated the walls around us. The doctor put his pen down on top of a file and spun in his chair to look at us.  
  
“Why don’t you tell me what’s going on, Kate?”  
  
I bristled in surprise, but she turned to me.  
  
“He’s our family doctor, I’ve been seeing him since we moved up here.”  
  
Kate turned back to the doctor.  
  
“I hurt my ankle, Dr. Renier, I need to get a brace or something.” She paused, but spoke again before he could open his mouth. “Have you been outside tonight? What the hell is happening out there?”  
  
Dr. Renier cocked his head in confusion.  
  
“Slow night at the bar? What do you mean?”  
  
“No, doctor, the-“ Kate gestured back toward the wall, looking for words to describe the night.  
  
“The town is completely different. It’s messed up, it’s… there’s something wrong out there. Really badly wrong.”  
  
The doctor scrunched his face, looking both confused and amused while Kate sighed in frustration. I interjected.  
  
“Doctor, the snow is red. None of the lights work, or they aren’t working well enough. Even in here-“ I gestured up at his submissive light fixture, “it’s all dark. The librarian is unresponsive and my uncle just went completely ballistic and chased me out of his house, threatening to kill me.”  
  
I figured it safest to leave the giant spiders out of the story until I’d established my credibility.  
  
“Well if Matt chased you out of the house that’s between you and him. What's that about Arnie at the library though, what do you mean he’s unresponsive?”  
  
“No, he’s fine as far as it goes, but he doesn’t understand what’s going on around him at all.”  
  
The doctor shrugged.  
  
“Well one thing at a time. I need to draw a little blood first, and then we can see about your ankle.”  
  
Kate and I looked at each other first in frustration, then in relief. A moment later the relief became confused alarm.  
  
“What do you need blood for? It’s just my ankle that’s hurt.”  
  
Dr. Renier put his hands up disarmingly.  
  
“You didn’t have a blood draw with your last physical, and I need to run labs. You’d be surprised at the things we catch in bloodwork, even in young adults. Prevention is always better than treatment.”  
  
Kate shook her head.  
  
“Thank you, but I would really rather just get my ankle treated. I can come back for labs another time.”  
  
Dr. Renier flashed a frustrated glance at her, but it disappeared as quickly as it had come.  
  
“I understand, please make sure you do. I can only do half the job keeping you healthy on the outside, and a little poke never hurt anyone.”  
  
The doctor reached down to Kate’s ankle, probing at it through her jeans. She winced painfully as he prodded at the swollen joint.  
  
“It’s definitely sprained badly, possibly broken. What have you been up to?” He asked, an odd smile playing at his mouth.  
  
“I tripped at the bottom of the stairs.” Kate said with a rehearsed quickness. Dr. Renier nodded.  
  
“You’ll want to get it X-rayed when you can. Until then we’ll bandage and splint it, give me just a second to grab what we need and I can fix you up.”  
  
He stood slowly and looked at Kate, then at me.  
  
“I can help with anything.” His voice was soft, enunciating each word carefully and slowly.  
  
The comment seemed half directed at us, and half to himself. With that, he shuffled past me and across the hall, closing the door behind him. I glanced at Kate, who was already looking at me nervously. She shook her head behind her, mouthing “quickly”, and I quietly opened the door. A weak light stretched painfully thin under the closed door as I heard Renier rummaging through supplies. I turned my head, seeing two unlit rooms further in the murky hall, and silently stepped toward one.  
  
Opening the first door, I could barely make out a figure lying back on the examination table. I stifled my surprise with a short, heavy breath, and quietly fumbling for the light I turned it on.  
  
In front of me was Sean, his eyes rolled back and sunken into his cold, blue face. An incision right above his collar bone told a horrible story: he had been completely drained of blood. His skin was shriveled like dried leather, looking more like a corpse in an exhibit than anything that had ever been alive. His mouth was cracked open, revealing a swollen tongue beginning to bulge between his teeth, which themselves were hard to discern from his whitened blue gums. His arms had contorted painfully in toward his chest, giving the impression of an agonized hug, one last attempt at comfort as his life left his tormented body. The room around him was spotless - he had been drained carefully elsewhere, and while he was still alive to see and feel it. There was a noise as the door to my left opened and quickly closed, and instinctively I backed away from the corpse and into the hall.  
  
Dr. Renier looked at me, and I looked back at him. Out of his grasp a long, thick, dagger like needle reached out for a body to puncture as his eyes met mine with annoyance.  
  
“You murdered Sean?”  
  
Even with adrenaline flooding I was still overwhelmed, throwing the words out of my chest more than speaking them.  
  
“Murdered? I’m a doctor.” His voice was cold and expressionless, stating his words as if reading them from a chart. Kate screamed from her room, having just caught sight of the needle.  
  
I said a million things in my mind, but Kate told me later she only heard a scream from me as I ran and tackled Renier. I reached for his hand, but felt the his needle pierce my stomach. I winced in pain as I felt it drive deep enough into my gut to jab the inside of my lower back. Screaming even louder I drew it out, overpowering him with my two hands as I pinned his arm to the ground.  
  
“Kate, get the damn bandage and let’s get out!”  
  
Kate hobbled across the hall behind us, knocking supplies off the shelves in her panic. My body and mind both screamed to escape, my eyes constantly darting to the door to will us out.  
  
I grabbed the needle and ripped it from the doctor’s hand. I held it over my head, anger and fear exploding in my chest.  
  
  
  
"Burn in Hell!"  
  
Kate limped as quickly as she could out of the supply room, bandages in hand.  
  
“Let’s get out of here now!”  
  
I brought the needle into the doctor’s chest, the full force of my weight behind it. He grunted in surprise, then let out a screechy laugh.  
  
“You think you’re going to kill me? You think I’m going to die here, in my own clinic?” Then his eyes shifted past me and he shouted, “Feeling better yet?”  
  
I began to shout as I raised my hand for another strike, only to hear scuttling behind me. I spun around just as Sean - or what was left or him- let out a moan, a cry and a shout all at once, pouncing on me.  
  
The body was lighter than I expected as he tackled me off of Renier. He wheezed as his cracked fingernails dug into the sides of my neck with surprising force, beginning to gouge and slash. I felt my skin tear and bleed, but my free hand was occupied pushing his face away to keep his gnashing teeth away from my throat. The doctor started to get up behind him, before grabbing his chest and slumping back down, still painfully snorting in laughter. With all my thoughts bent toward escape, I strained my arm to push him further away, stabbing into Sean’s torso with my weapon.  
  
Kate screamed as she swung a chair over top of me, crashing into Sean’s head and slamming it into the wall. I closed my eyes as she wound for another swing, connecting before the shriveled abomination had a chance to recover. Her second swing was hard enough to phase him and as it made a forceful, meaty connection he slumped down limp over my hip, twitching and jolting. My feet nearly slipped from under me as I scrambled from underneath him, and Kate and I sprinted out of the clinic, nearly tripping on the weedy obstructions that scaled the front of the doors.  
  
Unlike my escape from the house, we didn’t stop running until Kate collapsed, holding her ankle with tears streaming down her face near the library. I picked her up and carried her the rest of the way, my body burning from inside with pain and exhaustion. Straining our ears and keeping one set of eyes behind us, thankfully nothing seemed to have followed us out of the clinic, and as we entered the library again we slumped down on the floor.  
  
“Welcome to the library, please let me know if I can be of assistance.”  
  
I raised my eyes up and rested them on the politely smiling man sitting at his desk. Helpfulness be damned, he was a welcome sight.  
  
“Thank you Arnie.” I sighed. He tipped his glasses to me and returned to his book.  
  
Kate put her foot up on the table. It was now severely bruised and badly swollen, bulging over the sides of her shoe. I shook my head.  
  
“The fact you could walk on that at all is impressive.”  
  
I was trying to summon again the feeling of safety we’d had last time we were here. Neither of us could afford to process what we’d just seen, or to feel grief for Sean’s terrible fate.  
  
“If walking is the thing getting me compliments you should just put me down now.” She said, tilting her head back and letting out a pained sigh.  
  
We exchanged a look and broke out into a laugh.  
  
“I think the bar is low right now,” I shot back, “take your pick of walking across the street or swinging a chair.” She gave a chuckle we both knew she didn’t mean. No humor could lighten some burdens.  
  
That moment brought the awkward realization that I’d never bandaged a foot before. Kate picked up on my uncomfortable silence, and the look of irritation and disappointment she gave drew another true laugh out of us both.  
  
“I’ll be right back. Let’s see if Arnie’s got something.”  
  
When asked specifically for a book, Arnie was shockingly lucid.  
  
“Of course, why don’t you follow me.”  
  
He took me to a nearby shelf and quickly ran a finger across several books.  
  
“These will all do, but I’ll bet you but this one,” he said, pointing to the title “Sports Medicine: First Aid for the Field”, “this ought to be the most helpful to you.”  
  
I thanked him, brought the book back, and found the chapter on sprains. With careful study and extensive criticism from Kate, I was able to tape her ankle into a passable support. She stood up, and after an initial wince she walked a few steps and gave a shrug and a nod.  
  
“I’ll give it a C, but that isn’t bad for the first test.”  
  
I gave her a certain gesture with one of my fingers.  
  
“On an open book test? You’ve got to give me more credit than that.“  
  
Kate smirked and shook her head.  
  
“Careful there Einstein, I’m already grading on a curve.”  
  
We sat, doing our best to forget the situation we were in while trying to find a way out. Kate thought we should return to her house, and if we made it there to leave in my car. I was cautious, unsure how safe the roads and sidewalks were, thinking we should wait for daylight before making our break. We glanced back at Arnie, and down at our phones. It was 2:45 in the morning, and he was showing no signs of closing for the night. Kate tapped her knuckles on the table, glancing at me and gesturing back to Arnie with her head. Immediately I caught on to her meaning.  
  
“Hey Arnie,” I said, returning to his desk, “do you have any books about what’s going on in the town outside right now?”  
  
For the first time the old man froze for a second, then looked sideways at me with what seemed to be a knowing smile. Despite what Kate and I had seen in town, he still seemed to be harmless.  
  
“I do, but it’s on hold for someone.” He paused, looking me in the eyes and holding his smile. “I suppose I can let you read it though, I doubt they’ll be coming in this late.”  
  
He reached under his desk and handed me a book. I read the title and frowned.  
  
“Sorry Arnie, but I was wondering if you had books about what’s happening in the town. I don’t know if you meant to give me the ‘Amateur Botanist’s Encyclopedia’, but-“  
  
Arnie tapped the cover, looking over his glasses at me with a slow nod.  
  
“You never know where a good book can take you, young man.”  
  
As I set the book back down on the table with Kate, I immediately noticed something folded between the pages. Opening it, we found a small note hidden inside. Before I could begin to read it Kate called my name quietly and pointed to the page. The Latin name was gibberish to me, but the colloquial name rang out like a printed gunshot; it was the Hornflower. The picture featured a bright white flower otherwise identical to the one we’d consumed earlier. I looked at Kate, whose face was a collage of confusion, fear and regret.  
  
“We’re going to figure this out Kate.” I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt. For the first time, she stared blankly back, unable to respond.  
  
The note was hand written, a strange mixture of occultism and science. I can’t remember word for word what it said, but will try to come as close to the original phrasing as I can.  
  
“Hornflowers are known to cause delirium if overingested, but it seems that the state of delirium is actually a window into another pocket of reality rather than a twisting of our existing physical perceptions. The flowers are plentiful in the woods, and should be easy to find.  
  
Once you find a Hornflower, carefully pull and pot it. Make sure the root structure stays intact, as this is key to your own rooting.  
  
Once you have potted the flower properly, you must water it with as much of your own blood as you are safely able to. Over a short span of time this will begin to cause the petals to change color, and you will imprint upon it.  
  
Once the color is sufficiently changed, go back and re-plant the flower. If it does not survive the replanting you will be unsuccessful, so take care. After replanting, harvest a single seed from your flower and bring it to the Room.  
  
Once there we will plant the seeds, and will finish the process in person.”  
  
Kate and I looked at each other, processing what we’d read. We were past the point of skepticism, but couldn’t begin to understand what the “process” was intended to do. More frighteningly, it contained no details on what to do once we were trapped in whatever reality this was. We sat in confused silence, which turned to fear, then despair.  
  
“Are we stuck here?” Kate finally asked, her voice quiet and even.  
  
“I don’t know.” I racked my brain to think of any possible escape.  
  
Suddenly a noise like a door locking cut through the silence. Our eyes bolted to one another’s, then we jumped up and moved toward the door as quickly as we could. Arnie was still seated calmly at his desk, but as we grabbed the door handles they came off in our hands, the doors not moving an inch. I threw myself into the door, but it felt like a concrete wall. In a panic, my eyes looked around and fixed on a window, the red snow was coming down heavier now, looking like a ruby haze across the street.  
  
I grabbed a chair and swung it at the window, damaging neither. Pounding my hand on it and feeling no more give in it than the door had I spun to Arnie.  
  
“What the hell are you doing? What did we do to you Arnie?”  
  
Arnie met my panicked shout with the same tone of voice he’d kept the whole night.  
  
“If you’d like help finding a book, I’m happy to give it. Just let me know what you’re looking for.“  
  
In a rage I ran to Arnie, the wound in my stomach flaring alongside my anger. I grabbed him, but wasn’t able to move him any more than I could’ve moved a statue. Fear began to overwhelm my anger, and I dropped my hands and my head. Through the tears that were beginning to well up in my eyes, I noticed a picture on Arnie’s desk, settled neatly beside his computer.  
  
“Arnie, who is that?”  
  
Arnie’s slight smile wavered, then disappeared into a blank expression. Still, he didn’t acknowledge the question.  
  
“Who is that with you in the picture Arnie? Do you have grandkids? You love them, right?”  
  
Arnie moved his head to look away, but seemed uncomfortable and turned to look at his computer. His eyes looked heavy and sad.  
  
“Look Arnie I know you aren’t like the other people here. You love your family. Kate and I love our family. We don’t mean anybody any harm, we just want to go see them again. Please let us out of here Arnie. We won’t bother you if you don’t want us to.”  
  
Arnie took a moment, then looked up at my eyes. For the first time his eyes looked clear, and his words were lucid.  
  
“Young man I haven’t done anything. You’re the one who has locked the doors. And as long as you’re here they won’t open again. But there is still one way to leave, if that’s what you’d like. In the back there are stairs to the basement, there will be a way out down there.”  
  
“What do you mean I did this?” I looked to Kate for clarity, as she shook her head firmly against the thought of the basement.  
  
“You’ve trapped yourself in here, young man. But you haven’t locked up the basement. I promise you’ll be safe there.” Arnie reassured us in a paternal voice. “Keep your wits about you. That’s the only way out now. In it you’ll find a tunnel into the town hall, you can find the truth there.”  
  
“We don’t want the truth Arnie, we want to get the hell out of town. Can you please just tell us how to do that?” Kate asked forcefully, interjecting into the conversation before I could respond. Arnie shook his head.  
  
“There is no ‘out of town’ for us. For you maybe, but I don’t know. If there’s anything you could learn that will help you, it’ll be in the town hall. You will see when you get there.”  
  
Kate wanted to argue, but couldn’t seem to find the words. I looked over at her for a long moment, her internal conflict raging. After several tense moments her shoulders relaxed and she shrugged.  
  
“Where’s the basement, Arnie?”  
  
Arnie stood up and moved from behind his desk. My eyes drying in relief, I took another look at his picture. He was sitting in a dated home on a stair as two toddlers played by his feet. He had a smile on his face that radiated contentment and joy. The closer I looked however, the eerier the picture became. At a glance the twins looked normal, but no matter how hard I looked I couldn’t make out their faces. They were there, but my eyes couldn’t recognize or process any of their features, and the harder I looked, the hazier they got. It reminded me of trying to remember someone’s face that I’d met in a dream. I looked back at Arnie’s radiant smile one more time, before a sharp call commanded my attention.  
  
“Come over here young man, it’s time for you to go.”  
  
The staircase was ordinary enough that our trust wasn’t immediately broken, so we began our descent. Kate turned back to Arnie.  
  
“Thank you, Arnie, for helping us. I’m not going to ask you to come with us if you can’t, but I hope you see your grandkids soon.”  
  
Arnie’s face contorted into a sorrowful grimace that broke our hearts.  
  
“I have tried, young lady. But I don’t think that I will.“  
  
With that Arnie slowly closed the door behind us. Kate and I shared a look, each wanting to return to him and offer comfort. But the turning of a lock on the other side was soon enough of a response for us, and we slowly continued down.  
  
“Be safe.” His muffled voice came through the door behind us.  
  
As Arnie had said, among dusty books and boxes there was a heavy iron door, standing in stark contrast to the rest of the basement. I stood for a moment, thinking of something to say that would lighten the mood before we did what we knew we needed to. Kate stepped in first, opening the door with surprisingly little effort, and aggressively offering the darkened hall the same one fingered gesture I’d given her earlier. Neither of us smiling, we moved on.  
  
The tunnel was surprisingly short, with another door on the far end. With grim determination, we walked quickly toward it, never allowing our minds to wander further than the next step. When we arrived Kate nodded.  
  
“This is about where the town hall would be. Never knew we had a presidential evac tunnel for the mayor though.”  
  
“Small town politics are a dangerous game, huh?” I quipped. She shook her head, giving me a side eye.  
  
“A town of 400 is an army if you try and close the bar at midnight.”  
  
I rolled my eyes, feeling no better about what awaited us.  
  
Nor should I have. The room we walked into didn’t belong in any civic building. As the door swung open we were greeted by a pedestal holding a large, marble bowl, its outside smeared with a brown liquid we had no desire to identify. Two large bookcases on the far wall held books unlike any the library had held - everything from holy texts to alchemical writings to unlabeled tomes bound in haphazardly stitched leather. Symbols I’d never seen surrounded the pedestal, carefully drawn on the floor. Frighteningly out of place, an old revolver lay discarded, as if it had simply been dropped and forgotten.  
  
The bowl was half full of dirt, and a giant Hornflower stood tall inside, its shade of dark red seeming to glow in the musty, sickly smelling room. Countless roots crept down from the bowl, crawling up through the walls and out of the building through the bricks. The sight of it all burned into my mind like a twisted photograph, until I was jarred out of my stupor by a loud, shrill grating sound from the door’s hinges.  
  
My jaw went slack as I turned to Kate, whose color had drained completely. Immediately there was an enraged scream from above us, followed quickly by heavy footsteps. We spun around, only to see that the tunnel behind us was gone, with the iron door protecting only a brick wall. I sprung for the pistol, picking it up as I desperately gestured to Kate. She moved toward me, slowly at first and then came up to a full sprint. We ran up the stairs, barging into the administrative hall.  
  
Before we could take the room in around us there was another shriek, and we turned to see a man and a woman standing at the far end of the room.  
  
“Oh my God,” Kate rasped. “That’s our mayor and his wife. He’s been dead for years, almost as long as mom has.”  
  
The information didn’t have a chance to settle in to fear. The woman stepped slowly and firmly forward, pointing a bony finger at us.  
  
“What the hell are you doing here?” Then more quietly and eerily, “People shouldn’t come back up those stairs.”  
  
“We want to leave!” I shouted, not sure whether to sound aggressive or to plead with her. “We want to let you do whatever it is you do here, we just want to get out!”  
  
The mayor stepped forward. I hadn’t realized how tall he was at a distance, but the man was closer to seven feet tall than six.  
  
“You don’t belong here.” His voice groaned, unnaturally deep and yet oddly sickly. “People shouldn’t come back up those stairs.” Even as he echoed his wife’s words, the inflection in his deep voice mirrored hers like a decaying duet.  
  
The woman stepped closer to her husband, threading her arm through his elbow.  
  
“My husband is going to throw you back down there, and I’m going to pay your respects to the flowers for you!” Her voice started quiet, leading to a crescendo back into an accusatory scream as if we’d desecrated something holy.  
  
Kate stepped forward, hobbling much less on her newly bandaged foot.  
  
“What the hell are you talking about? Are you worshipping your garden now, with all this shit about your flower?” She pointed at the mayor. “Did the flowers tell you to dig him up? Because no matter how the hell he’s standing here, there is no way that’s your husband!” Her boldness shocked me, until I realized the pistol I had was concealed, our one and only card to play.  
  
The woman pulled herself closer to her husband, the deranged smile never leaving her face.  
  
“We aren’t meant to be apart. My husband was taken from me too soon, but I found him after all this time, and he found me.” Her voice was steadier, but careened between love and lunacy.  
  
“You found him? He died! He died years ago, and no matter what you’re on you can’t bring him back!”  
  
Kate’s numbed fear had given way to anger. I thought of her feelings for her mother, and wondered if this woman had shared her insanity with my uncle.  
  
“You have no idea what we can do. You’ve never tried to discover it. Love can bring us together, no matter where we are. No truth is unbreakable. No reality! We can exist as beings wherever we truly want to be. But if you haven’t felt that pain yet, we will be happy to help you learn it.”  
  
The woman’s last sentence fell off her tongue like dripping poison as she let go of her husband. Her smile contorted again, as the mayor reached behind a chair, producing a hand saw. Kate spun to face me, fear and trust side by side in her eyes.  
  
“Shoot them! Put them down and let’s get the hell out of here!”  
  
“Grab them! Grab them and bring them downstairs!”  
  
“I’ll bring you downstairs!” Their two voices could be no more different, but again the mayor mimicked her inflection like a monstrous parrot.  
  
In moments the charging giant was no more than 20 feet from me, and drawing a steady aim I hit him directly in the heart. He shouted and sprawled forward, and we ran toward his wife. She bellowed out in rage, beginning to stomp in our direction. I stopped for a second, drew aim, and pulled the trigger again. As she fell backward, footsteps thundered from behind us. I spun just in time to see the mayor take a powerful swing at Kate, slashing her deep across her back with the jagged teeth of his rusted weapon. She fell forward, screaming in pain, as I roared, pulling the trigger feet from his chest.  
  
Three clicks. Four. There had only been two rounds in the revolver. The mayor swung the saw back at me, missing narrowly as I stepped back.  
  
“Nothing will ever come between us again!” His wife cackled shrilly from behind us. I stood, stunned. Sobbing in pain, Kate forcefully staggered back to her feet and slapped me on the chest, starting to run.  
  
“Move your ass!”  
  
I spun, sprinting after her. As we ran I watched, horrified as the back of her jacket showed more and more crimson, her wound leaking badly as she ran for her life. Behind me I heard footsteps lumbering alarmingly nearby. A deep shout made me wince in anticipation, but if the mayor cut me I wasn’t able to feel it.  
  
“The exit… up here” Kate said, her voice coming out in agonized, crying gasps. We ran to a bend in the hall, rounding the corner as swiftly as possible. Ahead of us the doors stood, holding out the blood red blizzard enclosing us on all sides.  
  
“They’re locked! The doors are locked and you’re not getting out!” The mayors wife cackled from behind us. Kate was beginning to slow, her desperate exertion not enough to hold her pace.  
  
“Come the hell on!” I shouted as we closed the distance to our escape. Knowing there was no time to test the doors, I lowered my head, ran ahead of her and vaulted through the window, shattering it as I flew.  
  
My face crashed through the surface of the snow and I slid forward on the lawn. I turned just in time to see Kate, trying and failing to hurdle over the window frame, fall awkwardly forward and land in the snow directly under the broken glass. Barely a moment later the mayor, seeming to have grown even larger, crashed into view, seeming for a moment to consider if he could fit through the small opening. Using the last of her strength, Kate crawled from under mayor to the side of the root covered building, shortly before he reached his arm out and slashed at her with the saw.  
  
The mayor disappeared for a brief, hopeful moment, but then my heart sank as the door of the town hall shook. I looked up into the dark red sky, wishing hopelessly for an escape. I wished the sky would return to black. Wished the northern lights would cut through the haze. Wished I could have seen even a single normal, white Hornflower. I pictured it as I’d seen in Arnie’s book - a bright, untainted white. As the picture left my mind, my hand brushed something in that dark, crimson snow. As I pulled it out I saw, through the melting red in my hand a clear, white flower.  
  
I stared dumbly at it for a moment, then was brought to by the sound of glass falling as the mayor’s wife reached the window.  
  
“Kate!” I screamed. She turned her head, her body resting still against the roots coating the outside of the building as her face paled from shock. The white flower shone bright in my hand.  
  
She looked over, struggling but unable to move her body. She reached her hand out in feeble desperation as her eyes met mine. Peeling a flower petal off for myself I ran to her, pressing a petal urgently into her palm. She again made a frail effort to come up to her knees, but she could do no more than shake with exertion. The door shattered as the mayor, looking like a human only in shape, stumbled forward, his head snapping to find us instantly. Kate ate the petal whole, then shut her eyes, knowing there was nothing else to be done. I followed her lead, chewing the petal a single time before gulping it down and closing my own eyes, accepting whatever fate I was given.  
  
I kept my eyes closed. Long after everything grew quiet. The black was no different than I imagined death would be, and I wasn’t ready to know which darkness I beheld. Eventually I opened my eyes and fell to my knees. The moon shone piercingly bright on the white snow, unopposed in a starry, cloudless sky. I could see Kate’s breath still faintly from her nose in front of me. I looked up, mystified. The town hall was completely gone. In its place was nothing but an undisturbed, snowy lot. Most of the town remained, and as I began screaming for help it didn’t take long for someone to come to my aid. A man helped me bandage Kate’s back as best he could as we scrambled to load her into his car, speeding off to the nearest hospital.  
  
The rest of the story is a blur, the days blending together as shock set in. The police came to the hospital and interviewed me. Kate had a bad blood infection, and was on a heavy dose of antibiotics. It took her a full day to regain consciousness, after which she was in and out of lucidity due to her pain meds. In the moments when she knew who and where she was she corroborated my story, saying we were both attacked by the same person. They’re still out looking for a tall, drugged up man in a coat. Neither of us got a good look at his face.  
  
The next day I got a ride from a Good Samaritan from the hospital back to my car. Kate’s house was completely gone, without a trace of the home that once stood there. Nobody acknowledged the missing buildings, and I never got out of my car to ask any questions. The clinic, library and a few additional buildings had disappeared alongside the town hall. I sat in my car outside the vacant, snowy lot where Arnie’s library had once been, silently wondering if I even wanted to process any of what I’d been through. These people - Arnie, my Uncle, the Mayor’s wife and who knows who else - did something horrible that I couldn’t even begin to comprehend. Kate told me that while she hadn’t known Arnie well, Dr. Renier had seen both her mother and they mayor both before and after they’d been sick, and had been unequipped to offer any help. I wondered what depth of hopelessness someone had to fall to before they began to lose themselves like he had. After all, Arnie’s book had been reserved.  
  
When I left town that day, I never looked back. Kate and I are still close, and we talk often. As soon as she was discharged she moved in with a friend, and now she has an apartment the city. I told her what I’d seen when I collected my car, and she’d had no desire to look for herself.  
  
Eventually she did return to try and find some closure, and called me in tears. The entire town is gone now, not a single building left. Just a flat, open snowy clearing in the middle of the woods. As we talked, we did our best to keep our conversations focused on the good times she’d had there over the past years - the happy memories before that night. After walking the clearing, she sat down in the snow, still giving a small grunt of pain from her wounds. Suddenly, in the middle of a thought, her voice went silent.  
  
“You still there?” I asked, as I heard rustling, and Kate’s breathing becoming heavier and heavier. I began to hear her cry.  
  
“Kate, what’s happening? Are you okay?”  
  
“Just look.” Her voice returned, breaking as she spoke. I pulled my phone from my ear and waited. The moment I was notified of her text I opened it, seeing a single picture. In front of her brown winter boots, still powdered with the bright, white snow her hands had shoveled I saw it.  
  
Staring up from the camera against the dead grass stood a dark, vibrant, red Hornflower.
