I died at the young age of 15. Scott Fitzgerald commited su\*cideon February 9th 1985. I can’t really remember what made me do it,it was twenty odd years ago. I know I should remember why I died but with most self mutilation  cases we don’t remember when we get sent upstairs or downstairs. I wish I could tell you why I was sent to hell but I don’t remember anything from my short lived life.I must of done something really bad and self mutilated out of guilt? Considering I was sent to the Ring of Wrath I’m assuming it’s some act of violence.

Anyways,Today Satan came to me with some news.

\*“*Scott,God and I have decided to put you on the su\*cide rebornation project list”*\*His voice was deep and boomed across my apartment.

*“What’s that?”* I asked with confusion,putting my beer on my table counter.

*“You’re going back down to earth to live a new life”* I widened my eyes with shock and froze for a second.

*“So..-So I’ll get to experience a new life?!”*

Satan replied with a raspy voice;

*“Your soul will be put into the body of a newborn and you will live their life and forget about your time here”* Then,as soon as he appeared he dissolved into thin air.

Life on earth again wasn’t so bad in the beginning. Entering my new body felt exhilarating.I felt a new presence of life, a new [light. It](https://light.It) was only when I awoke behind a man,probably in his forties,slumped over his computer typing like he was a robot programmed to do so. My initial thoughts were *\*What the eff?\**.

I don’t think he noticed my presence. I towered over the man even with his long legs stretching past the end of his desk. I was snapped out of my trance of confusion when I heard a strangely familiar laugh get closer to the room me and the man where occupying.

*“Haha! Good one Stacy! Marino, me and the girls are out for the night!”* A beautiful girl looking younger than him swung the door open to the room.Her long blonde shining hair glimmered even in the dim yellow lighting from the centre of the room.

\*“Yeah..yeah have fun honey”\*The man who I assumed was Marino replied in a lazy uninterested tone.The girl closed the door and I could hear the giggles becoming farther and farther away. Me and Marino were left in silence once again with only the clicking of keys to break it.I skimmed my eyes around the room and a mirror caught my eye looming in the left corner beside a stack of books.Walking to it I felt [light.Like](https://light.Like) air.What I seen in the mirror was unspeakable.I can barely describe it.What I seen staring back at me in that mirror was a tall,ebony black figure with a deep black aura surrounding it.I was in such shock I didn’t see the note at first in the top right corner of the mirror.

*-\*Read the handbook\*-*

I stared at it.What handbook?I turned around and looked at the books stacked around me. A dusty brown book with yellow pages caught my eye.

*-\*Soul-Eater Handbook\*-*

I slowly bent down to pick it up.I carefully inspected the cover and back of it.Then,I cautiously flipped to the first page…
