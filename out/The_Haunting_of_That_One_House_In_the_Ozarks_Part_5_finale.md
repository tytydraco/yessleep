What did I just witness? Dad killed himself didn’t he. 

I thought he died of skin cancer? I don’t understand! Why does everything I find just lead to more fucking questions? 

What did Dad mean by loving his children but despising his child?

I sat on the couch in silence. Not the kind of silence that makes every other sound louder, rather the silence that beats like a heart; a silence louder than any sound I had ever heard. 

Thousands of thoughts and questions stood tangled like metal cables in my head, occupying every neuron in my brain like an invasive vine. 

I stood up, dizzy and disoriented by the crying and sheer shock.

At this point I didn’t know if there were even enough answers for all the questions. I don’t think I wanted to stay around long enough to gather any answers. 

“Trey, go to your room.”

A familiar voice shot through the air like a lighting bolt hitting me in the back and flowing through my whole body. 

“Mom?”

Turning around and there she was. Just how I remembered her. She had a ghostly fairness to her skin, her hair was so blonde it was almost white as clouds. She spoke softly and with intention. 

“Treyton Jack, go to your room, you’re dreaming.”

“Mom I- you- You died? I-“

“Don’t be silly son. I am old now. I’m what your mind wants to believe, that I’m old and happy.”

“Mom, is this really a dream?”

“Of course it is, you don’t think I actually died do you?”

I didn’t know what to think anymore. This didn’t feel like a dream, if so where did I go to sleep? was opening the box a part of it? Crawling through the attic? A dream would explain all of this insanity. 

Maybe I wanted to believe this was all a dream. Maybe I wanted to believe going to the hardware store was a dream too. Maybe this having all been a dream, I would wake up at my house in oklahoma, happy and safe. 

“Mom, I don’t know what to believe. I just wish this weren’t a dream. I wish Dad never made you leave, I wish we could have all been a happy family.”

Once again the familiar sting of tears swelling up started to grip me. 

“I know son, I wish I could have seen you grow up, but you known couldn’t stand being here anymore.”

“Did you have to leave momma? Couldn’t you have taken us with you?”

She started to sniffle, as in stage one weeping.

“I feel so selfish that I didn’t. It haunts me every day.”

She put her head into her hands and started to cry, her blue lips poking out just below her pointy nose. 

“I love you momma” I said going in for a hug.

We embraced. Her skin was cold and slimy, her hands were ice cold and her skin shrunk around her finger tips. 

Through tears with my face buried in her shoulder I said, “Do you remember when we were 5 and went to visit Grandma and Grandpa in Kentucky?”

“I uh- yes I do son.”

“You tripped and dropped Grandma’s apple pie?”

“Ye-Yes son I do, we all laughed didn’t we and Grandma made a n-n-new pie?”

“Yes momma, and we ate it with homemade ice cream around the fire place.”

“Yes son, such great memories.”

“I love you momma.”

“I luh- luh- luh-v you too son”

She seemed unfamiliar with the words.

“It’s way past your bed time Trey, it’s almost time to wake up.”

“Okay mom, I’ll just head to my room then.”

We squeezed each other tight and I departed for the stairs.

As I walked up the stairs I walked with dread. You see, I never met my Grandma and Grandpa, and even so they lived in Maine, not Kentucky. 

I walked back to my room, shutting the door and locking it. I turned off the lights but I wasn’t going to sleep. Especially not after that. 

I wanted to believe it was a dream so hard. But no matter how hard I tried to wake up, I couldn’t sleep. 

If this wasn’t a dream, then dad did kill himself, mom died having Haley, and Neil lied to me about dad’s death. What the fuck is going on? 

I had to get answers, and to me there was only one place to get them. Dad’s room.

Sneaking once again down the hallway, I tried the door to dad’s room. Locked. 

I needed to find a way to get this door unlocked. 

That’s when an idea came to me. 

When me and Neil were in our early teens, we would sneak into Dad’s room to steal cigarettes while he was passed out drunk. To unlock the door, we would use a bobby pin or something similar to turn the lock from the other side. Now I just needed a bobby pin, not to steal cigarettes, but secrets. 

I’m sure Hayley has some in her bathroom. 

Sneaking over back to my room and grabbing a bobby pin, I unlocked the door and peered inside. His room was just how I remembered when I left. No hospital bed, no monitors, nothing medical except for 2 or 3 heavily reused brown stained syringes on the ground next to the king sized bed. I never thought he’d get that low. 

I started searching the room. Dad seemed to become a hoarder of family heirlooms in his final days. Pictures of a once happy family scattered across boxes and broken frames; old VBS arts and crafts sitting beside them on window frames and desks. 

I searched for about ten minutes. Nothing. Just old family photos. It wasn’t until I searched his bedside drawer when I found something useful. 

A parchment, folded into a neat square in an otherwise empty drawer. It was coffee stained and the bottom left corner was burned. 

I unfolded it to see the words “Gilbert and Sons Mining LLC.” stamped across the top. The handwriting was difficult to discern but it looked like a set of instructions. 

“Grab a lock of hair, a vial of blood, and a picture or rough drawing (it does not have to be a good one, intention is all that matters). Carve a stone box from the stone of nearest cave and place each of the items inside with soil, sticks of an oak tree, and leaves. If you follow the instructions correctly, you should be able to see your wife again.”

Written below all of that in bold read, “One other thing. It will demand a living sacrifice.”

The name at the bottom was signed “David Tiger.”

I knew that name. He was a native american man who worked with my dad for the mining company. He was also an unofficial medicine man for the local cherokee tribe members, though many considered his practice to be sponsored by evil spirits. 

“What the fuck,” I whispered to myself. “What the fuck did you do dad.”

“I didn’t do anything you little shit stain.”

I whipped around and in the doorway stood dad, he was standing taller than he was alive. He looked like a corpse that had baked in the sun, his face covered in blood and red and white lumps folding over his body. 

“Why do you keep looking for answers Trey, there’s nothing for you in here.”

I stood there frozen in place. The all too familiar fear I knew and hated rushed me like a swift and powerful wind. 

“Do you really want answers? Then find me.” As he spoke the flaps of skin from his blown open scalp would jump and flop like fish dripping with blood. 

“Wh- Where will you be.”

“The cave, you know wh-wh-which one.” His voice changed pitch and resembled a growling hound when he stuttered. 

“Okay” I sheepishly muttered.

“I’ll see you there.” 

He lumbered out of the hallway, and when I went out to look he had disappeared.

I had to sit down. 

I started to hyperventilate and shake violently. 

This wasn’t happening was it? If it was then why was it happening to me?

The cave my dad talked about was a natural cave near our house about a mile away deep in the woods. 

I wasn’t going to leave without Neil, but when I went to check his room he was gone. Where did he go? 

I considered just leaving back to Oklahoma, but after everything I’ve seen thus far, if I didn’t find these promised answers I would lead a life of regret and dissatisfaction. But I would still be alive.

After prepping myself, I slipped on my shoes and began the hike to the old cave. 

The woods were pitch black. Shadows and silhouettes danced in the corners of my eyes. They no longer were the scariest things I knew. 

Halfway down the trail I stepped on something that crunched beneath my feet. Using my phone’s flashlight, it was revealed to be a human bone, a humerus to be specific. 

Spinning the view of the flashlight actually revealed hundreds of bones, possibly thousands. Small bones, big bones, children’s bones. Some had chunks of hairy greenish brown flesh still connected to them. 

“What the fuck?” I spoke in a shaky whisper, “What..what happened here??”

Every step through the boneyard was met with a crunch. It felt disrespectful to step on what was essentially a mass grave. 

The bones started to dissipate, the ground crunching less and less. 

Eventually I beheld the gaping maw of the old cave. Vines had grown over the entrance and all along the outer walls of the cave. 

I parted the vines and continued walking. The esophagus of the cave was darker than anything I had ever not seen. 

Human hair covered the floor. All of it was coated in coagulated brown blood. 

Deeper into the cave I went. The air started to feel heavy, so heavy in fact I felt short of breath. 

That’s when I reached the end of the cave. 

Shining my phones flashlight revealed to me a nest of sort. It was comprised of twigs, hair, hay, and bones. 

Lying beside the nest on the right was a pile of hundreds of stolen family photos, each from different families across town. On the left is what shook me to my core. 

Four skeletons laid propped up, two adults, one teenager, and the skeleton of what had to be a small child. 

It was my family. The two adults still wearing their wedding rings, with the larger adult skeleton having pieces of the top part of its skull missing. Dad. 

“Did you find what you were looking for?” Spoke Neil’s voice.

Turning around, I saw a figure standing 10 feet behind me. 

Shining my flashlight in its direction revealed, to my surprise that it was me. My face, perfectly replicated. 

“What did you do to them.” I asked

“There could only be one.”

“Did dad create you?”

“No, I was here when man first created fire.”

“If you have my face, then why don’t you sound like me.”

The imitation took a step closer. “Because there can only be one.”

It started to move closer, slowly moving towards me. 

It switched its voice to Hayley, “I watched you grow up. I watched you all grow up. So innocent.”

It stepped closer, switching its voice again to Mom’s “For years I planned on how to get you back here, my hunger became unbearable.”

It stepped closer still, its hands transforming into massive claws. It spoke again, this time in Mr. Smith’s voice, “For the past few days, I salivated at the thought of my limitless hunger becoming satiated.”

Stepping ever so closer, it switched voices again, only this time it used every voice it collected at the same time, resulting in a pained and barely legible cacophony of voices; as if I were standing at the gates of hell and could hear the agony of millions of sinners.

“There can only be one.”

It lunged at me. It ripped through the air like a beast towards prey. 

Survival took over and grabbing a rock I just barely swung in time to knock it down in mid air. 

This gave me a hopeless opening to run. 

I ran through the cave somehow not tripping on any of the rocks or slipping on the hair. 

The angered shriek of 1,000 familiar voices all at once echoed through the cave and loud thunderous footsteps started charging forward towards me.

Pushing through the vines and out of the Mouth of the beasts cave, I continued running. 

Bones crunched under my feet. Air was in limited supply but regardless I kept running. 

Behind me I heard grunting coming from the beast. Its footsteps accompanied by the crunching of bones. 

“TREYYYYY” It screamed, I could almost pick out a few voices from the carnal desire in its screech. 

It continued down my path, only it was faster. 

Past the boneyard I could see my house in the distance, lit by a pole light. 

Then I felt long tendrils wrap around my abdomen, it squeezed as it flung me around like a rag doll. I hit the ground with incredible force. It had grown much taller but in the darkness I couldn’t make out anything more than its shape. It bit into my leg and I yelled out in pain. It moaned in ecstasy, having its hunger fulfilled. 

Full of adrenaline and having nothing to lose, I hit its gaping maw with all of my strength and it let out a deafening screech. 

I landed on the ground but immediately got up. I couldn’t give this thing another chance. 

I ran into the house and grabbed my keys. 

In the living room I heard a crash in the kitchen and saw the beast had broken through the wall in its murderous and hunger fueled rage. 

I burst through the front door, and ran to my car. My car started immediately and I peeled out as quickly as possible. 

Looking behind my shoulder while barreling down the driveway I saw what I the beast’s silhouette illuminated by the telephone pole light. 

It was tall, about as tall as a 20 year old pine tree. It was covered head to toe with wailing and shaking heads, some I had recognized, others I did not. 

I heard it’s wailing and shrieks all the way down the driveway. If there was at least one thing I could make out from its shrieks, it was one phrase. 

“THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE”
