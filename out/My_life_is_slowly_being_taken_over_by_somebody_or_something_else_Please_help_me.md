It started off innocuously enough. You know, misplacing things and being generally forgetful. 



I put it down to tiredness and stress until I couldn't. 



I'd wake up with strange, barely visible marks on my body. Things started feeling badly wrong at this point, deep down in my gut. It screamed at me, unintelligibly, but screaming nonetheless. Then came the photos. Again, it started off in a manner such that I was able to lie to myself just about enough to maintain my sanity. Stuff showing up in my camera roll I didn't remember taking or being in after a drunken night out. People I didn't remember being with or didn't even recognise at all. Things I wouldn't have ever done anyway, like the three-minute video of me singing karaoke at the bar we'd hang out at every weekend. I hated karaoke. Always had. But there I was, bellowing the words to "*Holding Out for a Hero*" like my life depended on it. 



I tried to shake it off as best I could and get on with living my life, but that proved far too difficult. As if in tune with my very thoughts themselves, the marks I'd wake up grew larger and more painful the more I tried to ignore it all. At this point, I'd had enough and given the doctor's inability to either explain or help in any meaningful way I decided to figure it out on my own. I went online and ordered a camera tucked away into an unsuspecting nightstand lamp and proceeded to position it as best I could the night it arrived. Now, I'd never been one to believe in the paranormal so what exactly I expected to come of this gambit I'm not quite able to explain. I'm not sure I can explain what actually came of it, either. 



I woke up exhausted the next morning, eager to find out what the camera captured. Strangely, and for the first time since all the weirdness began, I woke up mark-free. Not a strand of hair was out of place. I plugged the tiny USB component of the lamp into my laptop and upon navigating to the newest recording pressed play. 8 hours was far more time than I could bear to sit through, and I motioned to fast forward before something caught my attention. It was barely visible at first, nothing more than a shadow lingering in the corner of the room just beyond my feet. Then the features came into focus. Jet black hair. A wiry frame. *Familiarity*. Too much familiarity. 



Me. 



I'm sure most of you have heard of that one theory behind the uncanny valley phenomenon. The one that claims it's something that evolved within us eons ago because there was something out there that looked just like us. *Almost* exactly like us. But not quite. 



On the surface, there I was, standing over myself. But even there whilst staring at a grainy video shot in the dark I could feel it. Instinct. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something about that thing standing there was off. Badly. 



The following days were a blur, but the occurrences that led to my grand hidden camera idea only grew in number and seriousness following my discovery. The marks I woke up were now freshly bleeding upon discovery. The photos I didn't recognise were straying further and further away from my actual life. Photos of me doing terrible, heinous things were invading my camera roll like parasites. Photos that, if anybody were to see them, would end my life as I knew it. I was at my wit's end, considering going to the police even, but I knew they wouldn't believe me. I wouldn't believe me, either. The one piece of evidence I had would have taken an amateur video editor less than an hour to make. I went to bed last night defeated beyond belief, wishing for nothing more than for this to finally end. One way or the other. 



In a twisted way, I suppose I may get my wish soon.



Work was supposed to start early today, and after a shower and a quick coffee, I was all ready to leave. I was just about to swing the front door open when I noticed a small white slip of paper lying beneath my feet. A Polaroid photo was attached to it. The word "copy" was scrawled in the white space framing the photo. At the same time, a text notification pinged. It was from my boss. "*Thanks for letting me know you won't be able to make it in today, get well soon.*" My heart sank and I bent over to grab whatever was beneath me.



A photo of me. Gripping a bloody knife. A guy and a girl, in their early 20s maybe, slumped at my feet. Drained of anything even resembling life. I wore a sick smile on my face. A smile of deceit. Satisfaction. Beyond our shared knowledge, I was it and it was me.



A memento of a job well done. 



And the note? One word.



"*Shhhh. :)"*
