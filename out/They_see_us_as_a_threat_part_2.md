Police at the station in New Jersey have been going on about a letter that was shared regarding a werewolf pack that was running from the government being killed off one by one. 

 This rumor became so popular that it circulated between departments and jurisdictions.  When I read the letter I didn't believe it. Apparently police in New Jersey went to a house to investigate a noise complaint and found a letter.  The letter became a legend among the stations and within the police departments. One any given staff member among the police knew about. I would be surprised if this story had reached other countries by now. In my department, we had all seen drafts of it at least once. 

 We all summed it up as fan fiction or bad writing, and if anyone ever brought it up, we would feel stupid. It's obviously a hoax. A lot of these things we have come across are.  This was ofcourse until my friends and I was called to a fire at a farmhouse in Tennessee when something happened that would arouse my suspicions and make me question reality.  No survivors were found. In the charred up remains I found a note, it was well preserved in the hand of one of the bodies.

This is what the note read:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Hi, this is Eric. You may have received my previous letters. I hope you did. As you may know we are being hunted for things we didn’t do and i attempted to reach out to warn people that there is something greater happening among us and a large portion is hidden from the public.  I wanted people to know we are innocent and perhaps they would identify us as innocent through my story.
Where I left off we were running from the hunters, all our friends had been killed and we were hiding in an abandoned house in Jersey. In the last few weeks these are the events that followed.

The most unexpected things occurred after we ended up running; A whole new world unveiled in front of us, so to say.  We managed to leave the house, stole a car and ended up in Tennessee. That is very far away from where we started.   Now that we are free we would never be able to settle in one town for too long.  

 There was never any werewolf handbook that we could whip out that would tell us to "stay away from the public eye" or the intentions of the government. Neither were their any teachings on how to stay unnoticed.  We have had some interesting lessons along the way but nothing changed our lives quite as the moment we realised we were caught right in the middle of a war between the werewolves and the hunters. 

Maybe Alicia knew this but truthfully that wouldn't change anything. Innocent people and creatures need to be protected at all cost. Life is sacred. All of it.   Not everyone believes this obviously.

So as it happens there are your violent werewolves that want revenge and they make a living off killing humans and on your other side, you have the hunters who make it a point to end all lycanthrope life and anything supernatural, in fact. 

The men with their guns and the monsters with their teeth are to us exactly the same. There is no difference.  Many innocent will die because of it and I think everyone needs to know.
This is why I had to reach out to you hoping that this letter will wind up in the hands of someone open minded willing to ask the right questions.
If we are really monsters how can we feel so much fear?

There are many disappearances within a deadly civil war of which you do not have any idea about. Due to the supernatural extent of the situation, most will either shrug it off or be kept in the dark by well laid out lies that they are told by their politicians.  Don't believe them.

Anyway, we wound up in Tennessee but didn't realise that we had been followed. Neither did we understand that the situation around here is much worse. More people are involved, more creatures have gotten violent and any innocent wolves or paranormal creatures have been destroyed in the crossfire.    
It did not take long before we found ourselves running again. This time there was a lot of empty land in between with lot of open places where we would all be easier to find.

It was about 24 hours before we discovered the bodies.  We could smell them. All buried shallow in the fields, right underneath everyone's eyes.  These bodies did not only belong to wolves. There were people, there were wolves, there were children for god’s sake and any creature that dared to intervene.

Another 12 hours and we could hear the whistling again.  We had already been found.
We ran to far excluded farmhouse where a very lovely family hid us.  It took them a minute to warm up to us while we explained our predicament. How fortunate were we that they were open minded people and knew a bit more than most would. Were they human? I had my suspicions but Alicia said not to focus on those kind of things and it was rude to be fixated on whether anyone was human or not. So I let it go.

We were fed, we were sheltered but we knew that it wouldn't last long. We just needed to build up some strength.

Our new friends were old fashioned; they advised us that we will have to fight if we wanted to stay alive. Turn against our own, turn against all who wanted to hurt us.  They even gave us guns.

I will admit I was intrigued by all the guns and the possibilities.  Sure, we couldn't directly fight but the guns will give us enough to try and protect ourselves.  No one wants to die. 

I was the one watching observantly as they went through the arsenal and even allowed the Lady of the house to show me how to use a revolver, load it with bullets.
Alicia took me aside and said that wasn't the way to conquer evil.  But I was scared. I didn't know what else I could really do to stay alive.  I am so tired.

Apparently anyone who was a sympathizer was considered an enemy now. It's gotten out of hand.
They are all but ready for violence.  

I follow Alicia and she says violence will never end well and all we can do is wait for the truth to prevail or for these people to get old and die, whichever happens first.  Therefore when she asked me to put the weapons away even though I was afraid I listened. I knew she couldn't protect me anymore but I also knew she had a point.  How can we be seen as good if we behave the same as the bad?

Night came and along with the night so did the overpowering fear that I had become so familiar with.
We stayed a bit too long and we could hear their commotion in the distance. 

 There was so much smoke in the air that seemed to come out of nowhere. Everything went dark and time suddenly changed.

 Everything was in slowmotion and immediately I felt strange. What I felt instantly made me both terrified and angry and this is what compelled me to want to take up arms.

 It was like my thoughts were not my own and every dark instinct and thought I had were being forced out of me and I turned full wolf for hours. It took a lot of effort from Alicia to subside me but thanks to her overpowering love she did and thankfully I didn't hurt anyone. 

 As long as it was dark, I could hear voice calling and telling me to give into my worst desires. This scared me.  I just needed to get out of there. Something really weird is happening and I don't know what else to do but run even more, faster and further.

There remained a darkness that almost seemed alive and A smell, i couldn’t describe even if i tried was surrounding us. It was aweful. What is this?

Our friends had a car that we could borrow so we packed our bags with whatever meat they had to offer, left the guns behind so that we can start driving not knowing how far we can go or whether it would be fast enough.  I even think we could run faster that this prius.

Even now as i speak, it is getting darker all over and where I could previously see light, there is none. You can see light over the horizon and that’s where we are going to rush off to. 

We are trying to stay calm but I think we are going to die.  I can see the fear in Alicia’s eyes as well. Something that I've never seen before and it gets to me the most.
It's only us left, all our friends are gone and a lot of the wolves in the areas up until this far have been found and killed.  

I hope it's not our fault. What if they found these creatures because they were chasing us?
What scares me is that they keep finding us, wherever we go, whenever we find a place to rest. They are less than a day behind.

I write this because we have nothing left to try other than to keep running but it's not working anymore.
If you hear from me again, we thankfully survived.

 I will update you on the matter of we do live.

Somehow, regardless of things happening in the background, something clear to me is that people want enemies. They deliberately choose to see evil so that they can focus on hate and blame. Even when presented with contrary facts or no evidence at all to back what they believe, they conjure up some so they continue feeling like heroes while causing damage.

That was where the letter ended. They still don't know who wrote it. It was either the dead person holding it or someone else. Could be anyone.
