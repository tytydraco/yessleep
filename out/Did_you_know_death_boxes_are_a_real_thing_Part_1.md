Last week I was hiking one of my favorite places to sight see, its a small trail outside of Strawberry AZ.

I enjoy going there to get away from everything, I don't work a high stress job nor do I really have anything to get away from. I just enjoy the ambiance of nature.

While making my way down my typical path I saw a smaller animal path intersecting the trail, I hadn't noticed it before but I was never really looking for something like that. I decided to follow it and after about a fifteen minute walk I came across a small weathered hut, these are common for hunters who may get lost or caught in a snow storm during the winter.

I was oddly drawn to inspect the hut and check for any possible goodies that may have been left in there. Slowly I made my way closer watching for any movement inside, I wasn't worried about seeing another human but startling an animal and placing myself in the way of its only exit.

I decided that throwing a small stone at it would startle anything inside and I would hear it. I found a good size pebble and lobbed it at the side of it, the ambiance of nature was cut silent by the crack of the impact.

I didn't hear anything inside. I felt a little let down because a part of me was looking forward to some excitement but I expected that nothing would happen. I walked towards the hut, the front door was half open. The inside was dimly lit through the cracks in the wood, I could see a table, small stove and mattress inside. I stepped in and looked around at the decaying state of everything.

Sadly there wasn't anything left over, no cool guns, animal skulls or anything of the sort. Tucked away behind the stove was a small box, I bent down and pulled it out. The box was in great condition given the state of everything else, it looked like something that would be used for jewelry. I tried to open the box but it was glued shut, this made me think something of value may be inside.

When I got home later that evening I went to work on how to open this box without harming what goodies it may harbor. I tried all night to open the box, I tried everything I possibly could with no success. Today was busy so I was more tired than normal and decided I would continue my business with the box in the morning.

The dream I had that night was horrible. I was back hiking out in the middle of nowhere and the same hut appeared in the distant view. As I got closer I saw a small witch like woman was laying on the roof of it, she wore a black dress that was riddled with small holes and tears. When I approached she shot a glance in my direction and began laughing, her laugh sounded like it was coming from a very young child. She picked herself up and dropped off the side of the roof breaking her neck when she landed. I heard the bones in her neck crack as blood began to come out of her mouth, the way her neck was contorted made me vomit.

I turned back to face her when I heard the sound of bones cracking, she turned her head and faced me wearing a disturbing smirk.

"You should have left the box alone." She croaked.

I recoiled back and fell to the floor, she didn't say anything else just continued to stare at me with eyes void of life.

The next morning after eating breakfast I continued my attempts at opening this little box without damaging it. It is seriously unbelievable how strong this little thing is, frustration got the better of me and I decided that I would just smash the little thing open. I managed to bash it a few times with a hammer and a large crack went around the box, I shined my phone light through the narrow crack to see if anything was inside.

Sadly the box was empty. I sat and laughed to myself for a few moments before throwing the box out. If there wasn't anything inside of it what's the point in keeping it? Flash backs of the hut with that old woman flooded my mind and I decided to burn the creepy little box.

The rest of the day was normal, after work I went on another hike. It was a shorter hike this time, something about the area seemed off. I thought nothing of it and went home to watch some television before I wind down for bed. I laid down on my bed, while watching some "daily dose of internet" on YouTube I felt something under my pillow. What I pulled out shook me to my core, the box I burned earlier today was under my pillow.

It had the same marking on it from where I had tried to pry it open and a few marks from where I bashed it with the hammer. There was no large crack running along the box anymore, everything about this box was odd. I Shook it off as maybe I thought I burned the box but actually didn't, I couldn't explain where the crack in it had gone.

That night's dream was one of the worst in my life, I walked back along the same trail and there were faceless beings watching me from behind trees. Peeking their heads out in my direction with the candor of a young child playing hide and seek. The hut was off in the distance again, this time the woman was standing on top of the hut, holding a piece of paper towards the sky. When I got close enough I could hear her mumbling something to herself, I couldn't make out what she was saying. I walked closer to the hut and the woman hurled herself off of the hut again, breaking her neck and that's when the faceless creatures started screaming. It wasn't like normal screaming, I don't think we have any words to describe the pain and anger behind those screams. They ran up to her and began to rip this small woman apart, separating skin from bone. They took the pieces of this woman they ripped apart and began dancing around like a young child who got exactly what they wanted for Christmas.

I stood there in shock at what I was watching, Unable to process the gruesome scene unfolding before my eyes. I ran into the hut and slammed the door behind me with all my might, once inside the screaming stopped and there was a envelope on the bed with my name on it.
