How do I explain this without sounding crazy? Well, I can’t, it’s that bizarre. To put it literally there is a big hole in my basement. I’ve been living in this house for most of my childhood. My parents left it for me in their will and after their car accident a few years back I got full ownership of the place. Mind you, they didn’t tell me anything about some giant hole in the basement, there were no weird stories spun around from my parents, no ghost stories of any kind, no dark tragedies that lurked somewhere here and believe me I checked. This hole might be a haunting but Me and my folks were straight, at least I hope we are unless they secretly didn’t want me or if I was an accident or something like that. I’m sorry for dragging this on it’s just weird, this whole thing is strange and confusing. There was never anything like this in there and it is very deep. I cannot stress how deep it is. It’s like when your scuba diving in the middle of the ocean, no coral reefs or sand to stand on, you’re just floating in blue nothingness and then you look down and all you see is black. The thing is also wide. I could say that it encompassed about eighty percent of the basement. It probably swallowed most of my dad’s tools, his work bench, and my box of cassette tapes. Like I said it’s a gigantic hole, but that wasn’t the only thing strange about it.

 When I found the hole a couple of days ago, I was moving stuff for my new couch. I almost fell in the damn thing believe it or not but luckily my balance saved me. Who knows what would’ve happened to me if I fell. Anyway, I called up my buddy right after this discovery, Let’s call him Percy. Now Percy was a seismologist, the fellas that study earthquakes. I was thinking if anyone knew anything about this it would be a scientist. I had high hopes for some sort of explanation, a rational chain of events that could lead to something like this happening in my house.

When he got here the hole was gone. Filled up with the same old concrete that made up the walls of the basement. Heck I even jumped onto the spot for safe measure and there weren’t any breaks or wobble shit. It was solid, real solid. My buddy was obviously annoyed by this so as a form of apology I offered to pay for some beers, and we went out to a bar. A couple of bottles afterwards I went back home and wouldn’t you know it. The damn thing came back. I tried to sleep it off after that and in the morning, it was still there. I figured a couple of videos or pictures would give me some evidence to work with, then my friend wouldn’t think of me as some complete nutjob. So, I took some pictures and videos and all of them turned out blank completely white. My camera stopped working after that.

I’m open to any suggestions. Fill it up, climb in it, chuck stuff in it, whatever. Just not anything too expensive because I’m kind of in a rough spot right now. Nothing has been the same since Covid and my shitty job wasn’t paying me enough. Also no this hole is not bigger than my moms.
