Ho boy... Well, that was thrilling. Some shit has gone down in the last few days. For one, I think I’m in love with Abby. For two, the police showed up at my house. Third, and most alarming of all…I’m now ninety percent convinced that the corpses in my living room… aren’t just in my head... All three of these things are scaring the ever loving shit out of me.

Last time I posted, I was freaking out about how I couldn’t move Frank and Tina, as well as my upcoming date with Abby. After writing, I sprinted through the house, cleaning as best I could. I was spared the horror of having to clean guts and corpse juice off my TV, which was a huge plus. I think I stopped briefly to plead with my spectral roomates. “Please don’t freak me out tonight. I’m sorry I tried to move you, please let this date go smooth.”

Abby showed up a little early, but that was okay. I tried to smooth myself over as best I could, but she could tell that something was off as soon as I opened the door. “Hey Jack! Are you alright? You don’t look so good.” I might have gawked for a second, Abby isn’t big on makeup (total sucker for eyeshadow though) but she’d definitely applied some today. She looked beautiful… Her pretty blue shirt and the makeup she’d applied really made her eyes pop (Fuck… that reminded me of Frank…).

“I don’t? Shit... cuz you look amazing.” I was only half kidding there. I felt genuine remorse that I hadn’t put in the same amount of effort. She smiled, and... did I make her blush? When have I ever made pretty ladies blush? “Sorry, I didn’t sleep very well...  or at all... last night. But come in! I’ve been looking forward to this all week!”

The date went amazing. We popped a pizza in the oven, shared a few glasses of wine, we got her HBO account working and watched the latest incarnation of my favorite movie star in “Godzilla Vs. Kong.” Hail to the king (you know which one)! The evening was just... too perfect. We struggled a bit on whether or not to open another bottle of wine, we don’t like the idea of agreeing to sleep together, while inebriated, but in the end we decided some more wine would be fun, so she ran out to her car to grab another bottle she’d brought with her. I risked a short glance over at my rotting roommates, who’d been quiet spectators of
 the whole evening. “Thanks for keeping quiet.” I whispered.

Abby partially stumbled back in, landing in my lap on the couch, and she giggled up at me. I thought to myself how lucky I am, corpses aside. Then she spoke. “Jack? Before I have any more to drink, there’s something I want to say...”

“Uh oh, you sound serious...” she playfully socked my arm, before sitting up and turning to face me, looking me in the eye.

“I really like you Jack. These past few months... they’ve been a lot of fun. I’ve had some shitty relationships in the past... but I don’t think I had one where I was... this excited just to spend time with someone. You’re sweet, you respect my boundaries, you’re self sufficient, you put up with my bullshit and my boy band obsession, and, most importantly... you’re not a crazy person.” That one hit me like an icelance to the heart. All the warm fuzzy feelings that had been building almost snuffed themselves out completely. But... damnit, I couldn’t bring myself to speak. “I think... if you feel the same... I’m okay kinda... moving to the next level? I mean... what is the next level? We’re dating, so we’re already boyfriend and girlfriend. I guess... I’m ready to be more serious about us... not that we haven’t been serious already...”

She’s as awkward as I am, I swear... once she finished speaking, I finally mustered my courage. “Abby... everything you just said... you have no idea what it all means to me. You put up with my bullshit too, and... we just... click so well, but I’ve told you, I’ve struggled in the past with just letting things happen... So I can’t agree to move forward until I... tell you something...” she cocked her head, but her face was... hard to read. “I might be a crazy person...” she laughed. Damn it. I let her laugh. That is totally a joke I would make if the circumstances were different. “unfortunately, I’m not kidding.”

“What do you mean?”

“I see a corpse... two corpses in this house... and nobody else can see them.” Her eyes widened a bit at that... I would have stopped there to gauge her reaction, but instead, the floodgates opened… and next thing I knew, I was spilling everything to her about Frank and Tina, including my grizzly attempt to move them the previous night. She listened stoically until I was finished. “I was afraid to say anything… I didn’t want to scare you... or anyone. I have no idea what’s going on or why... I’m seeing my therapist, and I’m doing everything I can to make them go away.”

She put a finger to my lips. I think she meant to silence me, but in the end she just stuck her finger into my gums. “That’s what matters Jack. You’re working to fix it, and you haven’t asked me to shoulder any other burden, Im sorry you’ve had to deal with that alone. It’s... a weird one. Are they... Are they in the room with us?”

“Yeah..  Frank is right next to my chair.”

She looked towards the spot. “What about the cheerleader?” I pointed towards the hall. She looked there too. “Oh man... that gives me chills. How could you ignore them?”

“I just keep insisting to myself that they aren’t real... besides... I wasn’t going to let them ruin the evening.”

She looked back at me, and stared thoughtfully for a moment. “Okay Jack, so long as you keep seeing help and all, this isn’t a deal breaker... in fact, I’ll be glad to support you through all this. Maybe you’ve got ghosts!”

“Ugh. Maybe... I can’t decide which is worse. Haunted? Or crazy?”

“Whatever the case may be... you’re Jack. And I still... really really like you.”

“You... you want to stay? I really like you too...”

“Hold on... for the sake of full disclosure... I have a confession to make too.”

“Oh god, what could be worse than a literal skeleton in the closet... living room... you know what I mean” I quipped. She actually looked away from me, and gave a nervous sigh before she continued.

“I told you I had some shitty relationships in the past. That was true, but one of them was... particularly bad. I was in high school, he was in college... It didn’t seem weird to me at the time... I just thought “hey! Hot college guy is into me!” I thought I loved him..  but he was cruel, selfish and... manipulative...”

“Did he hurt you?” I asked after she paused.

“No... I got lucky. My mom somehow got the message through to me that this guy was bad news. So I sent him a breakup text... and tried to just pretend it never happened. But that guy... his name is Sherman. He didn’t give up. He showed up at my house, and wouldn’t leave until my parents called the cops. He stalked me on all my social media accounts... I blocked him and so many others that I’m pretty sure were also him. Then he figured out where I went to college. Finally, after trying to corner me in a classroom, I was able to successfully get a legal restraining order... I hoped that would be the end if it... but it wasn’t. I can’t prove anything yet, but I’ve seen signs of that asshole. Weird anonymous comments online, little notes in odd places,  and I swear I see him sitting in cars sometimes...he might know where I live...” she was clearly upset by the time she finished.

“Wow... suddenly my “stalkers” don’t seem so scary.” I squeezed her hand as reassuringly as I could. “I’m sorry Abby. That’s really creepy.”

“Yeah... well. You know now. It’s something you might have to deal with if you want to stay with me. That’s what sucks the most... This asshole makes me drag him through my whole life.”

“What do you mean ‘if?’I bought a house with corpses in it. You really think a creepy ex is gonna stop me?” She smiled. “If you’re willing to support me, I’d be glad to support you too. I would be proud to be “more serious” with you. I looooo....” shit, I was about to drop the l word. Is three months too soon? I’m not just saying it to get laid... what should I do... should I finish? Shit... too strong... fuck. “ooooo…” (inhale) “ I love you Abby. I think... I mean... Was that too soon? Too strong? Is it getting hot in here?”

She smirked at me. “God you’re a goof... and I love you too.”

Next thing I knew... we were kissing. Details there are ours but I’ll just say... we’ve kissed before, and we’ve even slept together a few times, but this? This was something special. We stopped ourselves before it got too heated. “Damn. Stupid wine... I wore some really nice underwear too” she said with a grin. I had a small heart attack at that. “No worries though. I don’t have anywhere to be tomorrow... the alcohol will be gone by then...” she winked at me before just... lying down with me. 

The rest of the night was magical. We moved to the bedroom and spent the night laughing, lightly flirting, and watching silly things on YouTube, before falling asleep, wrapped up in one another’s arms… I had honestly completely forgotten about the rest of the stress in my life. 

At about four-thirty in the morning, we were rudely awoken by a blood curdling scream. It pierced our warm little bubble and ripped us awake. “What the fuck!?” Abby shouted.

All I could do was make weird noises and whimper. I scrambled out of bed, trying to figure out what to do. “Uh. Uh. Uh... you heard that?”

“Yes. Someone screamed! I think someone’s broken in!”

That hadn’t even occurred to me. I just assumed Frank and Tina were punishing me for having a good time. “Um… stay here?” I’m not sure why it came out as a question. I was trying to be brave so I could heroically investigate myself… but I failed miserably.

“Fuck no!” She replied, grabbing her keys, and the pepper spray attached to them. I searched for a weapon, and settled on my bedside lamp... then I led us into the living room where the scream originated.

As the bedroom door creaked open and I stepped in… the first thing I noticed was the god damned graveyard stillness of the room. With all the lights off, it was hard to see, but enough moonlight came through the window to illuminate things. I was in full blown panic mode. I half expected the corpses to be standing there waiting to scream at me some more. My heart pounded so hard I could feel it in my ears. I scanned the room. Nothing moved. Everything was as silent as the dead... which wasn’t helped at all by the dead body on my living room floor… but then I fucking froze.

Abby darted out from behind me, flicking on the lights when I forgot to, and keeping her finger on the trigger of her pepper spray. “I don’t see anything, Jack.” She turned to look at me..  I imagine I looked pale and terrified. “Jack? What’s wrong?”

“I uh...” I struggled to form words. Abby turning the lights on had confirmed that what I thought I saw in the dark was absolutely true. I looked at Abby. “Tina is missing.”

“Wait... the cheerleader?”

I could only nod. Frank lay right where he always did, but he was alone. Tina was just... gone. ‘Oh fuck. What is going on?’ The phrase kept repeating in my mind. The spot where Tina had lay was still brown... then I noticed another bone chilling detail... a brown smear lead from the spot, and into the hallway towards the front door, out of sight. Had someone dragged her away? I looked closer. There were these... splotches, evenly spaced on either side of the smear. I stepped forward for a closer look... and if I could have gotten any paler, I’m sure I would have. The splotches were handprints... they looked mostly human... but bizarrely thin… almost  like Tina’s desiccated corpse hands. I looked back at Abby. “I... I...” I couldn’t get another word out.

“What is it Jack?” She put a hand on my shoulder... it made me feel better.

“I think she crawled away...” Abby’s eyes were wide. She was scared now too. Why wouldn’t she be? 

“Okay... Um… where did she crawl?”

I cautiously approached the hall, to see where the prints lead. I actually did shriek then, as I rounded the corner and spotted the figure on the ground. It was Tina. She lay on the floor, face down (which is not her usual pose) just as dead and unmoving as she always was. The “crawl stain” and handprints lead right to her, but she just lay there in the middle of the hallway, about ten feet away from her normal spot. Only after I’d stared for a moment, did I realize the front door was wide open. “Uh. The door’s open” I said... “And I found Tina.”

“Jesus Jack. That corpse thing is freaking me out.” 

“Yeah... me too.”

Abby gathered her wits before I did. She stepped into the hall and looked around. “Okay, I still don’t see a body, but you’re right, the door is definitely open. Also, what’s this? She walked down the hall as I sheepishly followed her. She bent over and stared at a white boxy thing lying under one of Tina’s hands.

“Is that a camera?” It was. I think it was some sort of hybrid of digital and Polaroid. 

“Yes... shit. Call the police, tell them you think you’ve had a break in.”

“What? Why?”

“My stalker ex had a camera like this.”

“Oh… Oh shit. Why did Tina grab the camera?”

“Tina grabbed it?” 

“Her hand is on it.”

“Seriously, call the cops. And don’t touch the camera!”

“What if they see the body?” 

“I don’t see it. Why would they?”

I almost continued to argue… But damn it... I have to stop “letting things happen” right?

So I called the police. A patrolman arrived about 15 minutes later. The early morning sun was starting to come up when he arrived. He knocked on the door, shouting “open up! Police.” I’m pretty sure it was just in my head… but boy did he sound accusatory… I nervously opened the door for him.

“Sorry to bother you this morning sir, but we’ve got a slightly unusual situation here. I understand that you called to report a break in?” 

“Yeah. We heard a scream or something at like, 4:30 in the morning.”

“We?”

“Oh yeah… Abby… my girlfriend, spent the night here.” Abby stepped up beside me as I spoke. “We went to investigate, and we found the door open, and that camera on the floor” I nervously pointed back towards Tina... praying the officer didn’t see her like I could.

“Alright, mam? Can you corroborate all of that?”

“Yeah. That’s what happened officer. I have to admit something though. I might have left the front door unlocked last night... I don’t remember locking it after I came out to my car.”

“You still had an uninvited intruder who screamed and dropped that camera right?”

“Yes sir.” The officer kept jotting things down on his clipboard. 

“Okay. So here’s the weird part. We got another call from a distraught individual a few seconds before we got yours. He claims to have seen a dead woman in this house, but he was scarce on details. I don’t have a warrant or anything but would you mind if I took a quick look around?”

“Uh… sure!?” I can’t even describe how terrified I was. I think the officer noticed, but Abby stayed nice and calm. We stayed right there in the doorway while the officer stepped into the hall, eyeing the camera… then stepping right over Tina and into the living room. He didn’t see her. I let out a relieved sigh. 

While we stood there waiting for a few minutes, someone started yelling.

“Abby! Get away from him Abby! He’s a killer! I’m saving you!” A man dressed in black clothes came running up to us. “Don’t worry Abby!”

“Sherman...” Abby freaking growled the name through her teeth. “Stay the fuck back Sherman!” She shouted. 

Ah, so this was Sherman. Other than being sweaty looking at the moment... he really didn’t look like a shady creepy stalker. He just looked like some dude... Abby’s shout stopped him in his tracks. “Abby! The corpse!”

“I said STAY BACK!” She shouted.

“You ungrateful bitch! I’m saving your life!” 

“What’s going on up here?” The officer had returned.

Sherman began shouting before anyone else could. “Officer! I’m the one who called the police about the murders! Arrest him and get her out of here!” 

“Sir? Im going to need you to calm down. Why don’t you explain to us what happened?”

“What’s there to explain!? The body is right... “ he suddenly looked confused as he peered past us into the hallway. “It was right there. In the hallway. I was just looking at it.” I quizzically looked back. I still saw Tina lying there in the hallway. 

“There’s no bodies in this house sir.”

“It was RIGHT there! I JUST saw it! He moved it!”

“Sir? He’s been standing right here this whole time. Now why don’t you explain to me why you came to believe there was a body in the hallway?”

“I...” he paused.

“Because you broke in?” Abby finished for him.

“NO! YOU left the door unlocked. You clearly invited me!”

“No I did not.”

“Then why did you leave the door unlocked? You needed me to save you!”

“I left the door unlocked by mistake, Sherman. You aren’t saving me from shit.”

The officer quieted them both down. “Mam? Do you know this man?”

“Unfortunately. I was granted a restraining order against him, which he is currently violating.”

“Is that so... Sir. I’m gonna need you to get on your knees and put your hands on your head for me.”

Creepy Sherman didn’t take that well. Next thing we knew, he was screaming about how much Abby “owed” him. How she was “his.” How she’d been “leading him on all along.” 

“Sir. Stop shouting, and get on your knees.”

“I’m saving her from him! He’s not stealing her from me! He killed a cheerleader!” I just stood there... with what I hope was a poker face. “I’m telling you officer! It was there! There was a dead body of a cheerleader! It chased me down the fucking hall!”

“The dead body chased you?” The officer asked incredulously. There was fear in Sherman’s eyes now. He hadn’t meant to say that part. “I’m going to ask you one more time. Get on your knees.” Sherman did not cooperate. So the kind officer tasered him into submission, cuffed him, and escorted him away. 

Abby and I both had to go down to the station to give statements. I tactfully omitted the part about me seeing the bodies too. I’d feel worse about that... but the officer picked up the camera (Tina had returned to her old spot by then) and he found it both on, and with its password mysteriously unlocked. Within his image files were dozens of images of Abby. She wasn’t aware of the camera in ANY of them. He’d been following her for months. The police found that suspicious enough that they searched his car, and found duct tape, rags, and ether in his trunk. Who knows what that unassuming shitstain of a human being was planning to do... but he won’t be able to haunt Abby ever again. There’s more than enough evidence of conspiracy, along with violating a restraining order, breaking and entering, and filing a false claim with the police.

I gave Abby some space, but told her if she needed me, I’d be there. She came over a day later. She hasn’t left.

So yeah... it’s been a hectic week. I’ll be scheduling another visit with my therapist to talk about all of this. I think I know for sure now though. Sherman saw Tina when he broke into my house to do... whatever it was he was going to do. He saw the same dead woman in the same yellow cheerleader outfit. He even claimed that the dead woman chased him out of the house. That he’d screamed and dropped his camera as she crawled towards him, “growling.” The police used that as more evidence of lying. But I don’t think creepy old Sherman was lying about that. Not that I’ll ever say that. It has convinced both me, and Abby, that what I’m experiencing isn’t just in my head... Something I can’t explain is going on. There’s… some sort of ghosts in my house. Apparently they can move more than I’ve been led to believe if they so choose. They seem to have done us a favor, but I can’t help feeling scared. What if it was more of a warning?
