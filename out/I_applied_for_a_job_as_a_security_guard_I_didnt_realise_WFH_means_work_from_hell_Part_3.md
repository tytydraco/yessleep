I have seen the devil and his many faces.



I’d like to start by thanking you all for checking in on me. Your messages and kind words mean a lot. To those of you that still want me to put in a good word with the boss, it’s not going to happen. This is not a place you ever want to see, let alone work in. It’s took me much longer than I thought to update you guys, time is convoluted in hell. I have stopped referring to it as H.E.L.L. Let’s call a spade, a spade. I believe that the sights you see when you imagine the underworld would closely resemble what we have just been through. The suburbs were where we were heading last time I updated you. As you can tell from reading this, I got out…. Left a lot behind though.

  
  
  


The air burnt my throat as we entered through the gateway. A metallic taste I was unsure if it was in the air or if my throat was bleeding. I made sure to take a dose of the antidote before we left. Mark had assured us this trip would be no longer than a few days but I couldn’t take the chance and the team didn’t want another remnant to deal with. While we prepped for this mission I asked the guys how the creatures are named. Mark told me I should be worrying about real concerns, not trivial matters. He then went on to spend thirty minutes breaking down the difference between the normal run of the mill creatures that we call grunts. The remnants which are humans that mutate, keeping most of their appearance in relation to size and shape however their skin turns a pale shade of grey. Their arms elongate and morph into a three pronged claw and their face melts into a featureless mess of teeth and yellow eyes. There are only three reports of ‘general’ sightings, each one different to the other. The only correlation is their size, each standing at about eight feet tall and where chest plates inlaid with insignias that the team believes aligns them with a faction the command. Each one wields a sword  made from the material we are looking to extract. Their brute strength and speed is their main attribute, they lead by fear and power. No one has ever made it back from an encounter with one of these foes. Only video that is streamed to out watchers in the dark has provided evidence that they exist. I felt even more frightened of what lay ahead.



As we closed in on the suburbs,  a gathering of grunts feasted on a carcass of one of their brethren. The hut-like structures that made up the area were decrepit and rotting. Dust clouds dispersed from the crowd to suggest a struggle was required for their feast. Ian crouched low and pulled out his knife from his chest holder.

“I’ll take care of this lot quietly.” He went to move towards the crowd but Mark grabbed him.

“Get a hold of yourself Rambo, otherwise you’ll be dessert.  The mission is grab some of the metal and run back to the gateway as fast as fucking possible. No heroics, we go loud and quick. The noise might scare off the rest of the grunts.” 

Mark arranged the formation of the strike and told us to fire as soon as he flung the grenade. The bullets dispelled the silence of the town as screams of agony followed. I struck the first target in the chest with a short burst, the explosion followed, shrapnel dispersed and tore through the flesh of the creature. A green mist of their blood settled onto the dusty road. Mark pushed forward and called each mark. He put a bullet into one that still twitched. We pushed deeper into the buildings.



The paths between the huts grew tighter as we progressed. The grunts in the surrounding area had mostly dispersed when the explosion was set off. The stragglers were easy enough to dispatch at first, the narrowing of the paths had made us move in single file and now we were even squeezing through some gaps. This claustrophobic environment usually wouldn’t bother me but with the landscape we were in I could feel the panic rising in the pit of my stomach. We may have been kitted out with military grade gear and my time within the forces had made me reliable with a weapon, but we were dealing with creatures of another world. The monsters of our nightmares were our opposition and we were the infection spreading through their land. Things weren’t going so smoothly now. Rosco had a deep gash across the top of his back from a grunt resembling a gargoyle of gothic cathedrals, burst from a window above head height in one of the huts and landed amongst the four of us. Mark was leading the line and was blocked by Evan. Evan had froze up in the moment and was more of a hindrance than help. I was at the back watching on helplessly, I had no clear shot and Ian was in my way. The creature scratched and clawed for Rosco’s eyes after swiping at his back. Ian threw punches but his arms were restricted by the walls, more struck Rosco than the grunt.

“ will you stab that fucker.” Rosco was sweating profusely as he fought like a wounded animal to remove the grunt from his back. Its talons were digging into his shoulder as Ian drove the blade into the creature's skull. 

“Jesus Christ Ian, I don’t know if that thing hit me harder or if you did.” Rosco was bent over from the exertion.. 

There was a moment when each of us individually looked at Mark, each glance increased his grin ever so slightly. Even this hard ass saw the humour in the mortality of the situation. We all erupted into laughter, counting or blessings to have made it out of that encounter with no casualties. Evan was quiet for some time, he knew he had let the team down with his hesitation. Mark dropped back along the line as we marched on. Whispering words of comfort to the young man. He was starting to grow on me, his abrupt demeanour was required to lead men into hell's paradise but knew when to offer comfort and lift the spirits of the disheartened.



We ventured further into the deteriorating landscape, cautious of every shadow and creak from the wooden structures looming overhead. There was a clearing, almost like a town square. Buildings enclosed the area with balconies facing towards a podium in the centre. At the foot of the structure was our prize. A silver shining metal with a tint of red was spurting from the ground like thick vines. The light bounced off the metal, throwing reddish beams across the buildings. Rosco made a dash towards it. The thoughts of heading home clouding his judgement. He ran a finger across the metal and it cut clean through his gloved appendage. Blood ran along the metal and glowed as it absorbed the crimson fluid. It seemed to pulse a darker shade of red. Rosco had let out a cry of agony that reverberated for what seemed like forever. I stood there, praying to whatever opposes this forsaken land. Praying that the eerie silence that followed would stay in place 5 minutes more. Mark had already started extracting veins of the metal using a laser cutter and obsidian tongs Div Inv had provided. Sweat was dripping from his brow but it was not from the heat of the searing hot laser cutting through the devilish metal. Mark feared what we all did and that fear started with a single growl in the distance.



The initial growl game from the direction we had arrived from. That was followed by another to my left. cacophony of inhuman screams began at once, from all directions. 

“Tommy, grab what you can and let’s get moving. The rest of you… Marks shouting was cut short as the first grotesque shapes came into view over the rooftops. All instructions are left unsaid as Evan and Ian pump rounds of hot lead towards the oncoming beasts. Rosco has switched to his off hand, as his trigger finger is currently on the floor. I hold out the lead lined bag as Mark flings rods of the hell spawned metal into it. The bag doesn’t seem to increase in weight but it’s filling up quickly. I lay out the second bag and turn to help the other. I turn and see the squad seems to be holding their own. Blood and body parts of the grunts litter the floor. Some are a bit too close for comfort but otherwise they are unharmed and have advanced several paces towards some rubble allowing them to rest their weapons and fire in precise bursts. I rush towards Evan and cover him as he reloads. The first shots I fire miss wildly. Adrenaline coursing through my veins. I take a deep breath and try to calm my nerves. The next burst meets an onrushing, snarky demon as it leaps towards us. The bullets disintegrate its skull and a green mist is left in its place. The grunts don’t seem to have the intelligence to move out of the way. They run straight towards us, and meet their death head on. 



Mark calls to us as he places a final rod into the second bag. I race to him and pull the pack tight around my shoulders.

“Topside, double time”  he bellows. Mark is securing the second bag as he starts making his way towards the exit. The others surround him in a protective formation. I see a stray piece of metal  and I  secure it in the tongs. I ran towards Mark to put it into his bag. As I get close the air seems to shiver and melt behind Mark in the middle of the group. Out steps the embodiment of nightmares. A behemoth with rock like scales, bulging muscles and deep gashes running over its visible flesh. It wore dark metal armour, beaten and scuffed from many battles. Light seemed to be repelled by its existence, adding to an already ominous presence. A jagged blade as tall as a man it's only weapon, heavy enough to dig into the stone on the ground as the creature dragged it behind. It kicked Mark in the back, sending him sprawling, along with most of the contents of his bag. Evan jumped between them, Eager to make up for his earlier hesitation, unloaded round after round into the creature.

“Pathetic” it sneered. A voice  like gravel being ground together boomed. With a mighty swing the sword split Evan down the middle burying into the cobble ground. I screamed and pounced on the creatures back as Evan’s body fell in opposite directions. His bowels sloshing to the ground with a disgusting squelch. I tried to slow its movements, distract it enough for Mark and the others to make a run for it but I may have been an insect on the windscreen of a speeding car holding on for dear life. Ian swung hard with the machete he carried. The blade bounced off the General's skin, the sound ringing out across the battlefield. Ian's arm went numb from the reverb and he dropped the weapon. I swung the obsidian tongs hard into the side of its head. A roar of agony emerged from the beast as the sharp metal rod I had picked up shank deep into its skull. I was flung off its back as it tried desperately to pull out the rod  burning deeper every second. Mark grabbed the half empty bag and ran hard. Rosco was fast on his heels. Ian was nursing his injured arm while helping me to my feet. We start to follow, a slight glimmer of hope driving us forward. Ian is stopped short in his tracks, lifted off the ground by his head. The general had managed to remove the spike, the resulting mess of his burly hand dripping a black blood on the ground. He applied pressure and Ian popped. Brain matter splattered my face and I vomited. Tears began to flow down my cheeks but not for my fallen comrades. At least they perished quickly, the look in the demon's eyes told me I would not be so fortunate.
