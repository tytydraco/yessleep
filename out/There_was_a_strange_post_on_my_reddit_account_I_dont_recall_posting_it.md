It's said that no matter what happens, the average person will experience multiple paranormal events in their lifetime. They might choose to ignore them or attempt to come up with a reasonable and alternative explanation for most of these events. However, at least once in their life there will be an alarming supernatural event or series of events that they experience. This time, they won't be able to simply ignore or explain them no matter how hard they try. 

The most recent of these events to happen to me involve an online account of mine. Specifically, this one. I noticed it this morning when I saw a post that was made on my account that I don’t ever remember posting. It seemed to imply a possible sinister force behind a string of recent abductions in my area. 

Sure, it could've been a hacker but no would gain anything from simply posting a weird SOS-like post on my account. I can't explain it as some sort of health issue as I don’t have any signs, medical history, or family history of memory-related disorders. When it comes to possible drug use as the cause, I'm clean and sober. 

Therefore, I should’ve remembered posting what I'm about to repost and yet I don’t. The original post was titled, “A former work partner sent me a strange email last night, now I fear for my safety.” I discovered the unknown yet vaguely familiar post this morning right after I woke up to a loud tune. It was my computer's low battery notification. 

"Had I left my laptop unplugged? Why would I do that? Why can't I remember anything from last night?" Before I could ponder these questions any further, I had the sudden urge to vomit. I ran to the bathroom and for the first time since a horrible sickness I had in 2019, I puked.

The cause of me vomiting was unknown however, that wasn’t what worried me. At least not as much as the fact that the puke was mostly black. While closing the lid of the toilet to then flush the vomit in it, I noticed something on the underside of my left forearm. “Subject Number 9: Attempt number 1; Result: Conversion Rejected; minimal to no physical alteration; failure” where the words printed on my arm with no explanation. That was the final straw and that’s why I’ve decided to repost the original post rather than simply deleting it.

\-Original Post-

It happened last night around 11:30pm. I was getting ready to go to bed when I heard a notification sound from my laptop. It was an email titled, "If you get this email, you’ve been selected for a true opportunity. Don’t resist it!" and attached to it, was a Word Document. It was from an ex-coworker whose name I will blur out. Not wanting to stay up for what I thought was an advertisement or promotion of some kind, I simply saved the attachment after verifying the email's origin.

I then went to bed before being woken up around 3:00 at night to a loud thumping sound and my laptop being turned on seemingly by itself. Upon opening the laptop, I saw that it was opened to the word document while a page to reddit had been open. After reading the Word Document in its entirety, I was dumbfounded. It wasn’t an advertisement; it was a warning. At first, I would’ve assumed it was just a dumb, ridiculous prank. However, the following events made me convinced that’s not the case.

I attempted to delete the word document and close reddit with no success and the only windows my laptop would open were Outlook, Word and this site. I then tried to turn off my computer, but it only gave an error sound in response. There's definitely a virus on my laptop. Worse yet, my phone won’t even turn on for some reason so calling for help via my phone isn’t an option. Furthermore, in the process of then trying to leave my apartment the door wouldn’t unlock, and the peep hole was obstructed. Since my apartment is on the fifth floor, leaving through the window isn't an option. Following the failed attempt to exit, I tried to scream for help, but nothing happened. This only made me more desperate and nervous. That's why I've decided to post the document I received here so the hack will stop.

To give context on how I knew this former coworker in question, we met each other when we were both hired in the same new hire group at our previous job. Long story short, the job simply wasn't for us, and we were both let go the same day right before the end of our job's probationary period ended. Right After that we parted ways but kept in touch via Outlook and WhatsApp. I went to work for a warehouse job to continue paying for monthly bills. I'll admit it's not the best job, but I won't complain because it pays enough for me to afford my monthly expenses. However, that didn't stop me from being jealous of \[\*\*\*\] once I had learned that he had found work in some mysterious, experimental bioengineering facility that paid him handsomely by the hour.

I reside in an area on the southeast coast of North America that's known for constant innovation. My ex-coworker, on the other hand, lived 20 minutes away from me. That's partially why it wasn't so hard for both of us to find replacement jobs. However, it didn't explain his luck as I never took him as the kind of guy to work in the field of Biology and Gene Therapy. He seemed more of a mechanic than a scientist. Regardless, I was happy for him and moved on with my typical life.

That was all about 2 months ago.

The document that was attached to the email was a letter from my former coworker. Any details such as my name, the CEO's employee name, or the company they worked for have been removed. This was the message I saw when I read the document.

\-Message Starts-

If you’re one of the people, I sent this to. You need to read everything that is in this document very carefully, word for word and then post this to a site that it is or will be pulled up on your device. I’ve installed a virus on your computer that will only be nullified once this document has been posted onto a specific internet page designated as “Safe to post” by the virus’ code. I’ve only done this to ensure that the truth gets out there, not to harm you. I’m sorry it had to be this way.

However, I shall give you some context first.

It all started after I didn't make my previous job's probationary period. I had moved to the local area just for that job. So, when I didn’t make the cut, I originally was planning on moving back to my home state. However, that soon changed as two nights before I was going to begin the move. I had gotten a letter from \[\*\*\*\] Inc. It was a job offer.

"Hello \[\*\*\*\], we've heard about your recent and unfortunate separation from \[\*\*\*\]. We would like to extend a job offer after reviewing your skills and experience as we’ve determined that you'd be a better fit here with us and your contributions valued. Your job would be relatively simple, safe, and rewarding. You will be trained, costs covered by us. Should you choose to stay, you’ll enjoy our amazing benefits including, but not limited to, full insurance coverage, competitive pay, and 152 hours of PTO! All we ask is that you're willing and able to work 12-hour shifts, lift more than 50lbs, comply with our reasonable NDAs and do the job with quality and safety in mind. Should this offer pique your interest, don't hesitate to call us or email us!

Sincerely, \[\*\*\*\].”

“Today’s biological questions are tomorrow’s biological achievements here at \[\*\*\*\].”

I must've read it twice before deeming it as "too good to be true" However, the truth is, I was desperate. Desperate enough to take the time and reach out to the company. The fact is, I didn't want to go back to my home state. If I had a chance to stay here, why not try and see if the job is genuine. “The worst thing that can happen is I get my time wasted” I thought.

I called the CEO the next day and to my surprise, long story short, it was successful! I was hired! Not only that but the job's hourly wage was $10 more than my previous job and I only had to work 3 days a week! I was told to come in the next available shift for training.

I eagerly began my first two weeks here normal enough. It was mostly training videos relating to our job procedure, receiving hands-on training for simple tasks, and meeting my coworkers. On the first day, I noticed that all the coworkers barely ever talked. I chalked it all up as, "they're simply being standoffish to me because I'm the new hire". I figured they just needed to warm up to me.

After the first 2 weeks were done, I had a good idea of what I'd be doing. I would be experimenting on human and wild animal tissue as well as live animals. This was to study the effects of mutating and altering certain genetic codes. I know the last part might seem unethical, but it was to discover cures for diseases using gene therapy. I wasn’t hurting animals; I was helping them. However, the job still began to feel wrong in other ways.

It started with me meeting the CEO on day 7. Immediately I noticed something was different about her. Specifically, the way she looked for a CEO. She towered above me at almost seven feet in height and her skin was insanely pale. Her hair was jet-black as was the color of her eye’s irises. Her pupils being indistinguishable, and the shape of her upturned eyes made her gaze very intimidating. She looked young, perhaps 25 at the oldest. Furthermore, the way she dressed; she wore a black and grey camo military-style uniform didn’t help. There was what looked to be the patch of a flag or symbol on her left shoulder, but it wasn’t that of any nation or group I recognized. The symbol/flag in question was a red-letter X in the middle of a red outline of an eye with a black background. Her voice was also very off.

After meeting the strange matriarch-like figure, I was then made to sign several NDAs and other contractual documents. The documents I was signing seemed standard but something in me felt wrong with it. After signing the NDAs, I was then introduced to Arin, the person I'd be job shadowing. Everything went downhill from there. Immediately, within 5 minutes of meeting him, Arin began to give me a list of ominous, strange suggestions that sounded more like warnings.

1. If you hear the CEO seemingly talking to herself behind a locked door with the hallway lights flickering outside, walk away. She’s talking to the voice. Whatever they are talking about is none of your business and you want to keep it that way.
2. If you are working by yourself and the lights turn off. Don't move. You will hear a voice, cooperate with it, answer any questions it has and do what it says. I don't want to have to clean up after another, "unfortunate work accident."
3. Though this is unlikely, if the CEO tells you to meet them in their room. Do not keep them waiting. She doesn't like it when you're late because it is likely demanding your presence.
4. If you have questions about what exactly we do, don't ask. Don't try to tell anyone outside of this facility the nature of our work and its end goal should you find out. It's not us that will come for you, it's the voice.
5. If you happen to see the figure that the voice belongs to, it has respect for you. Keep it that way but avoid eye contact with it.
6. Do not refer to the voice as the CEO or a mental illness. Even if that’s what it seems like, I promise you It not that. You treat it with the utmost respect and legitimacy even when it's not around.
7. None of the previous suggestions I gave you were a joke of any kind.

I didn't say anything, but I was more than confused. I could tell by his face that he was intent on convincing me. In fact, he had the most serious look I had ever seen on anyone’s face. He then said, "I have your back but don't get yourself in trouble. Don't mention what I've told you at lunch either. Everyone learns in their third week. Now, you know what they say about Rome? When in Rome, do as the romans do yeah? Well, you're in Rome so do as we do. Oh, and I'll say this one final time, nothing I've told you is to be talked about outside of the workplace. Don't think about it too hard though. Just don't forget either." My heart began to race slightly after hearing this as I struggled to go about the work routine of isolating and studying DNA strands, reorganizing documents, Injecting certain labelled syringes into various lab animals, etc.

The next 4 days went roughly the same as I got into the routine of things. I got better at my tasks and was even allowed to work alone by the end of the week. All the other coworkers at lunch would say things like, "I went to go work at my station but the door to the room was locked, I then heard the CEO talking on the other end." or "The lights went out at my station yesterday, IT didn't say anything. The lights came on after 2 minutes. IT must've been observing." As these things were said, they exchanged knowing looks with no sign of any joking going on. At this point I was beginning to be convinced that the CEO was insane just by that alone.

The following 4 weeks were almost completely normal. There was no mention of "The Voice" except towards the end of my 4th week when Arin said, "IT must be taking a break or a vacation if it does that sort of thing." before one of our coworkers apparently got a little too clever and said, "IT might just decide to screw off for once." Everyone then stopped to look at him with stern expressions and no one even smiled. No one else said anything about the voice for the rest of lunch that day. The whole event made me nervous even more.

Midway through my 5th week, I had my first encounter with the voice while working the last hour of my shift. I was in a level A biohazard suit and about to mix two separate solutions in a petri dish based on instructions projected on my station's computer screen. One was dark red and labelled, "Human Blood; O- Type" and the other was black and simply labelled, "Black Mutagen." I was just about to mix them when the all the lights, including the light from my computer monitor cut out. Then, I heard a low-pitched, inhuman voice speak, "So interesting.” It spoke before continuing, “Tomorrow you will be made to do something dangerous but very important. In fact, that's why we brought you here. You are expendable due to your lack of prior experience and knowledge. However, I know you need the money and if you come in tomorrow, I’ll pay you 100k after you complete the task.”

The voice was beyond haunting because of how abnormal it sounded. It was like 3 people speaking at once. One voice was a deep, yet feminine, prominent, and loud voice while the two sounded like a man’s faint whispers echoing the same words. The voice then continued to my dismay, “Now, you were about to mix the two agents. Remember to destroy the petri dish after 3 minutes.” I didn't even ask how it knew to respond with that. I just stood there drenched in sweat and shaking, horrified at the whole experience. Then I thought back to the rules I was told on day seven. There was no doubt in my mind that this place was insane!

The voice then left without a trace as the lights came back on. I then completed the task according to instructions given. I watched as the Human Blood mixed with the Black substance. The entire petri dish became black within 1 minute before reverting to blood. When analyzing the liquid under a microscope, I saw that the cells had their entire genetic code rewritten. There were also what appeared to be stem cell like cell in the blood. They were black and moved through the other cells mutating any that hadn’t been converted. I immediately stepped away from the microscope as I gasped and then disposed of the mutagenic waste by placing it in the incinerator. The day then ended not long after that. I was reluctant to come back but the money promised was undeniable.

When I got to my assigned station at the basement level of the facility the next day, I was greeted by the CEO again who told me we’d be working on a "willing test subject" for an experiment. She also told me that I and my immediate coworkers were the only employees on site except for a few executives that would also be present. I was still shaken up from the previous day’s experience and the weirdness of that current day. However, I was then fully convinced with the promise of an additional 100k being deposited into my account immediately after successfully completing my task. I would've turned back had I known what would happen less than 30 minutes later.

I was escorted by the CEO to an all-steel room except for a panel of heavily reinforced, thick observation glass and door that looked like it belonged in Fort Knox. In the middle of the room lies a medical bed with a tube full of black fluid beside it. Several of my coworkers then stepped in the room with me as they saw my confusion. The door then closed behind them. Then Arin spoke, “So I guess the CEO didn’t tell you. Listen, there’s a reason why our team is the only one here today. It's to put you on that bed.” I shouted in protest, “What! No! I don’t agree with this! Please! You can’t do this to me! This is illegal! Stop it!” Arin then replied with the last words I ever heard him speak, “Sorry buddy, this is why we brought you here. No one’s going to find out! We are all getting 100k individually to do this. You’re not the only one who needs money right now. Now let’s just make this easy for everyone. Get on there!” I then replied with, “Fuck you! I kill all of you!” as all 6 of them wrestled me to bed with ease. They then cuffed my feet and hands to the bed with metallic restraints. The last thing I remember is a cloth being put over my nose as a strong scent filled my nostrils and the world went dark.

The next thing I remember was my eyes being covered by my hands as cried. I then pulled my hands away to see that they had become elongated, and my fingers had become claw-like. I then looked down at my mutated, blood-soaked body in horror. All around me was death and bodily destruction. I didn’t recognize a single body. The bed, equipment, walls, and floor were painted with blood and littered with human tissue. I immediately froze for a second time before retching. As a towered above the destruction, I realized I was significantly taller than I remembered. Then I looked ahead of me and saw that the tube with the black fluid was empty. “…No” Was the only word I could get out. That was when I noticed that my voice was altered. I sounded like the voice except prominent voice was a demonic version of my original voice and the faint whispering voices that came from my throat afterwards were feminine. Then I heard The Voice call out to me from the direction of the door behind me. I turned and saw the CEO. “It’s okay child, you’re mine now.” Were the words she spoke to me… and they will be the words she speaks to you.

To the person this letter is addressed to, I'd like to introduce myself. I am known by many names, one of them is Cerridwen. You've received this message because were meant to be transformed into something more than your current self and soon you will be. You will be one of the first as well everyone else receiving an email supposedly from \[\*\*\*\]. Your device will be tracked at time the virus has been installed onto it. Know that I’m on my way to save you. You may spread the word. It will do you no good, no one will believe you.

\-Message ends-

After I first got done reading this, I thought it was some ridiculous joke but now I no longer feel that way as the lights have begun to flicker and I’m beginning to hear whispering sounds from my closet. I’m going to try one more thing to escape.

I thought of an idea to get out of this situation and that was to start a fire in my kitchen to trip the fire alarm and get help. However, as I went over to the stove the power shut out and all the light from the outside streetlights seemed to dim unnaturally until no light came through. The only thing illuminating my entire apartment was my now laptop with its now eerie blue glow lighting up the dark world around me.

I decided to do the only thing I could think of, post the document on reddit. However, just as I was about to do this, I heard what sounded like three demonic voices speaking at once coming from behind me. Then I lost all hope of escape as the horror of reality sunk in and froze my body still as Cerridwen spoke, “Once your device was fully hacked, I simply manifested myself near your device’s location. I then waited for the perfect time to introduce myself. That’s how I’ll get the first of the other ones too. You are mine and there's nothing you can do about it. Now go on, post it.”

\-End of Original Post-

As I’m reposting this on the web, there’ve been several local reports of people in my area going missing with no trace. It's likely that whatever "Cerridwen" is, It's responsible for the disappearances in my area and it's not human.

“The first 10 of the missing people had received an email from an individual identified as \[\*\*\*\]. However, now people are going missing without having received any previous let-” I turned off the TV after hearing that. The local news had also been saying that some other people had been waking up with words stamped on their arms. Some of these people that had reported words stamped on their forearms have since gone missing as well.

Either way, it's coming for me now and I know this for a fact. I say this because the light coming through my apartment windows has begun to dim considerably despite it still being mid-daytime with no clouds in sight. There are faint whispers coming from all around me and the lights of my apartment have begun to flicker and turn off. I feel like this isn't the first time this has happened.
