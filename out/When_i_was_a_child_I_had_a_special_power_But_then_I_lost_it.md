I was eight when I realised that I can see who will be murdered in the next 24 hours.

I had known something was wrong with me, ever since I saw Auntie Lisa, mommy’s best friend fall down the stairs when in fact Aunt Lisa was sitting with mommy in the living room, talking about their husbands. I had screamed, but I was only five then, and when mommy and Aunt Lisa rushed to see what had upset me, the terrible vision of Aunt Lisa lying all broken on the landing had faded.

The next day, I saw mommy weeping in the phone. When she saw me, she gasped “Aunt Lisa - she’s not coming round anymore.”

Later I picked up that Aunt Lisa had been killed.

I still didn’t quite understand the extent of my terrible power. When out and about, I would fleetingly glimpse people with cut or bruised throats, broken bodies, gaping wounds in their chests where their hearts should have been, exploding heads. But these were strangers, and the visions would fade in seconds.

Then one morning, I knew for sure. Katie Gill came in the school yard with her head sitting all wrong on her shoulders, her neck twisted round and bent down in a terrible way. I wasn’t friends with Katie, a sullen girl, but I couldn’t help going up to her.

“Hey Katie” I said. I knew Katie was going to have her neck broken, but I didn’t have the words to tell her.

Katie looked at me through her wrong eyes, that only I could see were wrongly placed. The bell rang, and we all began lining up to enter the school.

“Hey” she answered with her deformed lips.

There was nothing more to be said. I walked in with Katie, and tried to be nice to her all day, including her in our games and helping her with schoolwork, even though the sight of her twisted neck and crooked head churned my stomach.

Katie didn’t come back to school the next day, as I knew she wouldn’t, and the teachers told us later she’d gone to heaven with her baby brother and her mom.

As I grew older, I became better at blocking out the murder visions. There weren’t that many, murder after all thankfully is not such a common crime, though perhaps more common than we think. And I couldn’t really help anyone, even though there were times like the crying baby with the battered skull wrapped up in its mother’s chest at the grocery store I really wished I could.

And then one day I did.

I was eleven, and I had crush on Andy, one of the neighbourhood kids. It’s so funny, I can barely remember what he looks like now. But we used to hang out a lot for a while, his dad had passed and his mom had remarried and he hated his stepdad.

It was early afternoon, after school, and I was hanging out with some kids in the street outside our place.

Andy ran out from his house. I had seen him earlier that day, his body all crushed and bleeding, his limbs lying at wrong angles on the street. I knew it would happen then. I jumped forward.

A car skidded into the street - I knew it was his stepdad’s car. I moved as fast as I could, pushing him out of the way. The car hit me instead.

I remember looking at the sky, feeling the warm blood on my skin, and hearing shouts and screams. But the main feeling that flooded me was not pain, but relief. As I lost consciousness, I knew it was gone, I didn’t know how or why, but I knew I'd no longer see murdered people. I smiled at the paramedics, my relief and happiness at the realization so great it outweighed any pain.

Later, weeks after I was released from hospital, my mom told me Andy and his family had moved away. By then, I was so focused on healing that I didn’t care anymore, and I never found out if he survived his stepdad or not.
