This all started probably when I was nine
As a kid I would like to stay up all the time my hallway was always dark so when I would glance at it would be a sp either staring at me or walking by and it isn’t just people it’s also these really weird creatures

 Like one time where are my parents went out to see a movie I’m not sure which one but it doesn’t matter anyway I heard a really weird noise outside of my front door

 like a continuous thud I was pretty scared but I gathered some courage and looked out it was a shadow but it wasn’t a person it appeared to be a body of a dog specifically a pug and it had the head of a baby

 I was pretty scared when I saw it I told my brothers what I had saw but they didn’t care nor believe me I kept looking at it this was about 30 minutes after my parents left but when they got home like two hours later

 I told them and of course they just said it was the tree in our front yard but I know what I saw and it was not a tree about two-three years later at my new house it’s even worse

 instead of sp it’s deformed looking people like my mom or my brother one time I was trying to sleep and I was staring at the hallway and saw a deformed person that looks like my mom

 and they walk even faster it looked like something out of a horror movie and mind you this was at 3am my mom was not walking in the hallway at 3 in the morning and I know what your thinking “what if she’s getting a glass of water or going to the bathroom”

 my mom has her own bathroom and she always has water by her bed and then the time I saw my brother it was 10 or 11 pm so my brother was in the living room watching something 

I call for him because I needed him for something and right as I did a deformed thing that looked like my brother speed walked towards me I almost had a heart attack 

and I knew it wasn’t my brother because I heard him walking up the stairs I told him about it but I kinda scared him but it still doesn’t end there

 one time I was laying down and I heard what sounded like a little girl whispering some thing in my ears I’m not sure what she said but it was creepy

 and when ever I’m trying to sleep I hear a banging noise and usually it will be by my window or my brothers room wall

 and I know it isn’t him and sometimes I hear a digging noise by there too but sp still visit me in the corners of my room not often though.

 I’m new to Reddit and I love the no sleep community I just wanted to share my experiences with people and I’m bored so it’s something pretty fun to do thank for reading this
