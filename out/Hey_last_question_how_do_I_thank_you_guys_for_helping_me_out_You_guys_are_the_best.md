 Thank you so, so much for helping me. I know I’ve said this before, but you guys have helped me out a lot, and I really appreciate it. I’ve got all the [answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yn8zrh/hey_follow_up_question_now_that_i_know_that/)I need, thanks to you.

This is going to be my last update for now. If something else happens, I’ll let you guys know, but until then, consider this the last one.

I talked to my parents. Both of my parents. I found a way to talk to my dad. And I got more information from my mom, too.

I pretended I had to interview her for a school project about my family. I knew she wouldn’t tell me everything, because I was pretending it was for school, but it was worth a shot.

“So what’s your full name?”

“Annalise Miller.”

“Okay, what do you do for a living?”

“I’m a biologist.”

“What’s a biologist?”

“...Don’t you already know the answer to that one, honey?”

“Yeah, but I want the interview to be super-thorough so I can get the best grades!”

“A biologist is a scientist that studies living things.”

“...I know you don’t like talking about him…but what was my Dad’s name?”

“...I..do you really have to talk about your father for this?”

“...Everyone else is gonna talk about both of their parents, but-”

“His name was Derek.”

“Derek?”

*That was the name in the video.*

“What happened to him?”

“Huh?”

“Why did he leave?”

“...Ainsley.”

“Yes?”

“Do you actually have a school project, or did you just want to ask me about your father?”

*Great. I was only a couple questions in, and she already found out I didn’t actually have a school project. I’m a terrible liar.*

“I just…I wanted to know about my dad, and some other stuff. Everyone at school, things are so different for them.”

“...Ainsley, things are just different for us.”

“I want to know why.”

She sighed.

“I…I knew this day would come eventually, but I just…”

“Other people’s hands don’t grow back when they get cut off, right? That’s why you were so mad when I sent that video to Celeste.”

“Yes. Other people’s hands don’t grow back.”

“And…most people…when they die, they don’t come back, right?”

“Yes. You’re…you’re the only one that does.”

*She was lying, but I couldn’t call her out on it, otherwise she’d know I went through her stuff.*

“My friend told me about the way her parents ground her. It’s way different than the way you do it.”

“I see…I should’ve expected this after putting you in public school. Ainsley, remember when we had to move here all of a sudden?”

“Yeah. You said it was for work.”

“It was for work, yes, but it was mostly for you. Do you know what the company I work at does?”

*Play dumb, Ainsley. Don’t screw this up.*

“Science stuff?”

“Well, yes, but more specifically, we study special things and people. We want to find a way to make life easier for people. Your father was...he wanted to become special, so he could help people. He essentially gave up his life to give them the ability to talk to the dead.”

“Why?”

“It was supposed to aid in police investigations. Eventually, there was an added goal-creating eternal life for others. Basically, they were going to make everyone special, like you, except they wouldn’t age.”

“Did they?”

“They were going to, but they stopped before they actually got there. See, after your father became special, they needed someone to have a special child, and I volunteered. Eventually, you were going to assist them in making a truly immortal person, but they changed their minds.”

“Is that what my lessons were?”

“Yes. Eventually, you were going to work at the same company as me as a bodyguard for really important people there. But they stopped because…”

“Because why?”

“They were afraid you’d be dangerous. If you decided to start hurting people, it would be really hard to stop you because you’d be immune to any weapon others could use on you.”

“Do you think I’m dangerous?”

“Of course not, honey. But not everyone could see that. Now, there are many special people that our company helps. Most of them are allowed to live normal lives, but the ones they consider dangerous are typically locked away.”

“Where?”

“I can’t tell you that. It’s a secret. But basically, it’s like going to jail.”

“Oh.”

“I didn’t want that for you, because I know you aren’t dangerous. And because you are my daughter. I wasn’t going to let them take you away from me. So after a lot of arguing, they finally agreed to let you stay with me, but you’d have to pretend you weren’t special anymore. That’s why we moved to this house. That’s why I put you in school.”

“...Why didn’t you tell me about this before?”

“I didn’t want you to be upset, sweetie.”

“But how am I going to learn what I’m supposed to do and what I’m not supposed to do if you don’t tell me anything? How am I supposed to act like I’m normal, if you don’t treat me like I am?”

“I don’t know.”

The room went quiet for a couple minutes.

“I guess I just assumed you’d be able to grasp it easily…look. Ainsley, there’s a lot of stuff that you’re still too young to know about. So, for now, why don’t we just put it all aside and talk about it when you’re older.”

“Okay…”

“We won’t do lessons anymore, unless you decide you want to do them again in the future. We’ll do everything the normal way.”

“So when I get grounded, it’ll be like how my friend’s parents do it?”

“Yes. We’re going to do everything normally for a while, until…until I think you’re ready to know more about things. Deal?”

“Deal.”

I know she wasn’t being a hundred percent honest about everything. I know there’s still a lot of things she’s kept hidden from me.

But I also know, that when she says she loves me, she’s being honest about that. And right now, that’s the only thing I need to know for sure.

There was only one loose end I needed to tie up. Talking to my dad.

I didn’t know how at first, but I realized that if my dad truly was the last voice I hear every time I get grounded, the way to reach him might be easier than I thought.

I went into the woods with a shovel, and dug a deep hole- but not a hole too deep that I couldn’t climb out of.

Then, I laid there in the soil, waiting.

It took a while, but eventually, I could hear a voice from deep in the ground, one that I’ve heard for years, but never truly known what it meant until today.

*What are you doing, little one? You’re never here unless you’re punished.*

Just like usual, I can’t respond to it. But this time, instead of sitting there, listening to it, I try to respond.

I use all the strength I can muster, and I choke out a single word.

“D-Dad?”

“...*How did you figure that out, little one? Did you finally decide to do what they wanted, or did you try and run?”*

“What?”

“*How. Did. You. Figure. Out. That. I’m. Your. Father.”*

“My mom…told me some stuff, and I…I filled in the gaps.”

“*So they haven’t sealed you away yet. Interesting.”*

“What do you mean, sealed away?”

*“Why, sealed in the earth below, of course. There were others that came before you. Once they were deemed too dangerous, they were locked below in one of those containment facilities.”*

“So…so those kids were…”

“*I believe your mother would say they were grounded forever.”*

“Why? Why would they lock kids up like that?”

*“Several of those children killed their parents. And more and more were going insane. The more times they died, the more their mental state decayed. They weren’t deemed safe any longer. It’s not just them. It’s other people too. Once you’re deemed “dangerous”, you’re locked away somewhere, either above or below, and that’s where you stay.”*

“But, if that’s true, why haven’t I gone crazy?”

*“Who knows? Maybe it’s because of the way your mother raised you, or you go crazy slower, or you’re more special than we realized. It takes a lot of willpower to resist the decay inside you.”*

“I don’t understand.”

“*You are a child of decay. A child with anomalous and nonanomalous DNA. That typically doesn’t go over well. Most would say you’re destined to go insane, to turn into a force even more dangerous than anyone could predict, but that’s up to you.”*

“...Can I help them?”

*“Help who?*”

“Those kids that are trapped.”

*“Maybe. They may be beyond saving at this point though.”*

“I still want to try. I want…I want to use my powers to help people.”

*“Maybe you will. If that’s what you decide. Maybe you’ll go rogue and help them. Maybe you’ll go rogue and hurt others. Maybe you’ll get locked away. Maybe you’ll help the company that assisted in creating you. All these futures are possible. I’ve seen them.”*

And then, just for a moment, I saw them all too. I saw me as a monster, me as a savior, me falling to madness, and me overcoming it. I saw me as everything I could ever possibly be.

“*The choice is yours, little one.*”

And then the vision ended, and his voice faded away.

I don’t know what I’m going to do with my life yet. I want to help those kids that are trapped-my half siblings, but I’m not sure if it’s safe, or even the right thing.

I’m not sure if siding with or against the company my mom works for is right or wrong.

I’m not even sure I’ll remain completely sane forever.

But I’m still too young to worry about those things. For now, I’m just going to keep the information I learned in the back of my mind, and pretend to be completely normal for a while. I’ll go to school. I’ll hang out with my friends, and I’ll pretend that there’s absolutely nothing special about me, until I learn more, until I choose my own destiny.

Because the choice is mine now.

And I’m choosing to just be Ainsley for as long as I possibly can.
