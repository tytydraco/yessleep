I got this email in the middle of the night with a... strange proposition. No one asks you how you got the money, though, and once you have the sum in your hand, what you did for it vanishes completely.

The guy who hired me had an independent studio, and I don't really want to know who he sold his... productions to. I did not care. The most of my activity consisted in student films and ads, so I wasn't exactly making a lot of cash. This opportunity, however, brought in 10k.

His requirements were clear. The main actors would say their lines, do their thing, whatever, and when they were in the middle of... it, someone would come in through the back door and murder the man while the woman watched. That was my cue. A fake fight scene would start, and I was to replace the guy being murdered. Take some hits, fall, get slammed against the wall and so on. Until he'd take his spot back for a close-up of his face and 'die'.

That's what me and the producer-slash-director negotiated through the phone.

When the big day came, I headed to the studio - his garage, and met the... actors. The air was thick with an unsettling sense of anticipation as I stepped into the dimly lit garage. The walls were lined with various film equipment, cables snaking across the concrete floor. The smell of stale cigarettes and coffee lingered in the air, blending with the faint scent of motor oil.

I got to know, quickly, that the woman was the director's wife, which, at the time, didn't disturb me that much. Her on-screen lover was to be beaten up by a policeman for 'trespassing', and murdered. Then, the policeman and the woman would run off together.

This director-actress couple was definitely weird as fuck, but I didn't care.

The first few takes were okay-ish. They would get it on, Mr. Policeman would come in, and then I'd switch and get 'killed'. Then, the woman would thank him for saving her from the boring sex and they'd leave together. I assumed this was some weird fantasy the married couple had. The scene played out repetitively, each take blurring into the next. The director’s voice echoed commands, his eyes scrutinizing every movement. The actors performed with a mechanical precision, their eyes void of true emotion. It was all just another day at the 'office'.

The last take, however, was different.

The camera was rolling. After my 'death', the policeman didn't say his usual line. Instead, he leaned in to kiss the woman. The atmosphere shifted, a palpable tension seeping into the room.

I didn't know they'd improvise.

'Thank you for saving me. It felt like it would never end, and not in a good way,' the woman exclaimed, her voice trembling slightly.

'Was that your husband?' the policeman actor said, his grip tightening on her hand.

The woman looked confused for a second, then snapped back into her dramatic character. 'Why, no! He was just an intruder.'

The policeman took her hand in his. 'Right. Is that common? Sleeping with guys that aren't your husband?'

She stared at him, then her eyes darted to the producer. 'Well,' she began, laughing nervously, 'a girl has to do what she has to do...'

'Is that what you told Ronan?' the producer said, from behind the camera. 'When you met with him, behind my back?'

I saw the blood drain from the woman's face, as the other actor gripped her hand tighter. I felt like I didn't belong there, and everything suddenly became incredibly real. The air grew thick, suffocating. The realization that this was no longer an act hit me like a punch to the gut.

'I don't know what you're talking about,' she murmured, her voice barely a whisper.

Suddenly, as the producer brought the camera closer, the policeman took out one of his guns and, in a split second, my ears exploded. The sound reverberated off the walls, a deafening crack that made my heart race. I covered my head and when I looked back up, the woman was laying lifeless on the bloody mattress.

'I think that's a wrap. Thank you for the wonderful work,' the man said, as the two actors (her 'lover' and the policeman) were wrapping up her body. Their movements were methodical, almost practiced, as if they had done this before. Then, he turned to me. 'I wouldn't care if you tell anyone. I would just pin it on you. You see, I draw the line at cheaters. Now get out.'

He didn't need to tell me twice. My legs moved on their own, propelling me out of the garage and into the cool night air. The world outside felt strangely detached, a stark contrast to the horror I had just witnessed.

I knew there was no use in going to the police, so I tried to live a normal life after that. 

The days that followed felt like walking through a fog. Every moment was a struggle to maintain a semblance of normalcy while the horrific images played on a loop in my mind. I tried to lose myself in the mundane tasks of everyday life—grocery shopping, cleaning my tiny apartment, and attending casting calls—but the gruesome scene would creep back in, unbidden. 

Nightmares haunted my sleep, leaving me drenched in sweat and gasping for breath. The money, now just a stack of tainted bills, sat untouched in a drawer. Every time I thought of using it, a wave of nausea would hit, reminding me of the blood that had been spilled for it.

Social interactions became a minefield. Friends and acquaintances noticed the change in me, their casual questions about my well-being feeling like interrogations. I avoided eye contact, fearing that they might somehow see the truth in my eyes. 

The once-familiar streets of my neighborhood now felt alien, every shadow a potential threat. I sought solace in alcohol, hoping to numb the relentless anxiety, but it only provided temporary relief. The isolation grew, a cocoon of silence where I could pretend, even for a moment, that none of it had happened. But the reality was inescapable: I was a witness to a crime that went beyond mere murder, and the weight of that knowledge was crushing me from within. 

When I'd thought I had finally gotten over it, I got another email.

*I need you for another project. Bring a friend.*
