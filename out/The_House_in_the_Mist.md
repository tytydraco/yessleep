It's a foggy Friday evening as I'm walking home and as always, I'm taking the shortcut road through the forest. As I walk the road that I stepped through so many times in my life, I see something strange, I know the forest is empty apart from the trees and the occasional deer I spot, but I swear I see a faint black outline of a house far away through the fog.  I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, it can't be, I know this forest since I was a kid and no one ever lived here, they couldn't just build a house in one day, could they?

The curiosity gets the better of me so I step away from the road and walk towards the house. The weird thing is, it seems like I don't get closer to it and the more I walk in its direction, the more dense the mist is getting, it felt like I'm walking for an hour, or was it just a few minutes, the fog is getting so dense that the trees are disappearing and I can barely see my hands in front of my face and I'm left in a grey void, yet the black outline remains as visible as at the beginning, and I'm finally feeling like it's getting closer.

I kept walking in a straight line for all this time through this unreal fog yet I never stumped into anything, not even a bush, it feels like there's nothing in here, but just as I'm about to despair I notice something strange, I start seeing tons of small little lights all around through the fog and just as they get as bright as they can, I suddenly step out of the fog like I exited a cloud.

In front of me there is a very strange house, the eerie house was unlike anything I had ever seen before, it  looks both ancient and futuristic, made out of wood the blackest metal I've ever seen on the edges, but that's not the weirdest part, what I'm sitting on is just a small perfectly circular platform, and all those starts that I saw in front of me, are also below me, there is nothing else here apart from the platform and the house resting on it and all the starts as above so below, like I'm sitting at the edge of the earth and peeking at a crystal clear sky filled with stars and far away galaxies and star dust forming in strange shapes.

What is this place? How did I get here? Who lives here? Did I drink too much? And what secrets did this bizarre house hold?  So many questions are racing through my mind as I get closer to its wooden structure that was bordered by the blackest metal I had ever laid eyes on and see colorful lights flashing through its windows but just as I get to the black door scribbled with strange yet perfectly shaped symbols, it slides to the side, welcoming me inside...
