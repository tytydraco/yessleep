[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ifi7b8/box_baby_part_1/)

I remember staring at that piece of paper, taking it in. I’m not sure what I was expecting - maybe the baby’s name or birthdate scrawled by a desperate mother. But this wasn’t a baby left on the doorstep of a hospital or home. This baby was left in a box in the middle of a quiet road in the bush. The block capital letters were written in a neat, steady hand. My scalp prickled, and all at once, the baby felt very heavy in my arms.  

‘What does that mean? I mean…’ I scanned Natia’s face. ‘Whoever left him out here is crazy,’ I whispered, dropping my voice, my eyes darting to the watching trees. 

When I looked back at Natia, she was looking at the baby in my arms like it had just morphed into a goblin. 

I pressed on - surely she wasn’t taking that note seriously… ‘That box isn’t wet,’ I whispered. ‘Whoever put it on the road did that after the rain stopped. How long ago was that? Maybe Twenty minutes before I woke you?’ 

Natia tore her eyes away from the sleeping baby, ‘Did you see any cars parked back there?’ 

‘No, nothing. There’s been nothing for ages. Maybe they’re parked up ahead though?’ 

Natia sat back into her seat. ‘We gotta move,’ she said. ‘Let’s get out of here, quick.’ 

‘Here, take him,’ I said. 

I passed her the sleeping baby and she grappled with it reluctantly. 

‘Watch his head.’ 

‘Fuck, this thing is so cold!’ Natia said, wrapping her arms around the pale little thing. 

I turned the key in the ignition, and the car’s engine slowly turned over, caught for a moment and then died. The silence that followed roared louder than any engine. 

Natia gasped loudly. 

‘I know,’ I said, turning the key again, flustered at her over-dramatic reaction.  

The engine turned slower this time, the headlights dimming. 

‘Fucking car!’ I turned to Natia. ‘We might have t-‘ 

The word dried on my tongue at the sight of Natia’s face. She hadn’t gasped at the car situation.  

She was staring over my right shoulder, and her eyes were wide. I turned my head. There was someone standing outside the car.  

A man was standing out on the dark road, lit by the dimming headlights, and now he lunged forward and bashed the window with his fist. 

I yelled and fumbled with the door lock just as the man reached for the outside handle. Natia held the baby tight in her arms, a protective hand over its head. 

 The man leaned in close to the glass. He was thin, dressed in dark pants and a crumpled white business shirt, jacket and tie. His eyes were red and glassy, as if he had been crying for days on end, and his gaze shook from side to side. He wore a pair of orange ear muffs, the kind that you pick up at Bunnings when your lawn mower’s too loud. He looked completely unhinged. 

‘You luh..leave that here,’ he stammered. His voice was cracked and hoarse, and he slurred his words as though his tongue was swollen. ‘Put it b... back.’ 

My body had taken over and was leaning as far away from the window as possible. I could feel the adrenaline pumping through me, turning my nerves to steel. I straightened up, put my face near the glass and said, 

‘We’ve called the cops already. They’re coming now.’ I swallowed despite myself before roaring, ‘You FUCK OFF!’  

The man looked as though I’d just lit the fuse on a stick of dynamite, he looked past me and glared at Natia with his shaking red eyes. 

Natia clutched the baby and shouted, ‘I know KARATE!’ forgetting to pronounce it correctly in the heat of the moment.  

‘She will FUCK YOU UP!’ I bellowed at the man. I could hear Natia fumbling with something beside me, but my eyes remained fixed on the man. He had turned and was looking down the road ahead, as if expecting to see a police car baring down on him.   

Before I could fully register what was happening, Natia thrust the baby towards me. ‘Take it.’ 

The baby’s head lolled on its tiny neck and I hurried to support it. ‘What are you doing?!’ 

‘I’m gonna punch his lights out.’ She opened her car door and stepped out into the night, just as I had retaken possession of the baby.  

Its head rolled around as I gathered it up. ‘What have you done to him?!” I shrieked at the man, who now straightened up as Natia marched around the front of the car towards him.  

‘You get the fuck away from us.’ I heard her say, muffled by the windscreen.  The headlights lit her from below. Her eyes were wild. 

The man stepped back away from the car, putting his hand up towards the advancing Natia in a ‘stop’ position. ‘L..listen... keep your v...v... don’t... you hafta...’ 

Natia was within striking distance now, squaring up against him, fists raised. 

He reached a shaking hand into the inside of his jacket.  

She leapt forward and popped him square on the chin with a swift right hook. He stumbled backwards across the road and fell flat on his back, his head striking the gravel on the opposite side of the road. He was out cold.  

Natia dashed across the road and crouched over him. 

‘No, no no... get away from him!’ I groaned through the rain spattered side window. 

Natia spent what seemed like five minutes moving around the man’s crumpled body. His legs were splayed, his heels sitting in the road. ‘Come onnn, girl. Get back here!’ 

Finally, Natia straightened up and jogged across the road to her still-open door. 

‘Shit I thought I’d killed him,’ she panted as she climbed back into her seat, ‘My mum would be so mad at me.’ 

‘He’s alive?’ 

‘More or less, yeah. Did you see him reaching in his jacket? Thought he might have a knife... it was just some old photos.’ 

‘Old photos?’ 

‘Yeah like proper old timey shit. Family photos. Dude’s mad as a cut snake. He has earbuds under those earmuffs.  Who does that?!’ 

We stared at the pair of prone legs that protruded from the other side of the road into the dim light reflected by the headlights. The wind shook a branch high above us, and the fat drops of water tapped heavily on the roof of the car. I remember my breathing was heavy, as if I'd just finished running a marathon. Natia’s dark eyes shifted to the road ahead, 'His car must be up ahead somewhere. He has keys in his pocket. I didn’t take ‘em.’ 

’That was really dangerous,’ I breathed.  

‘Guess I do know some karateh!’ 

I was far too rattled to have a sense of humour about it just yet. ‘He’d better not come to. Did you see his eyes?’ 

Natia nodded, still scanning the road ahead. ‘So our car’s dead, do you reckon? Battery?’  

‘I think so. I shouldn’t have left the lights on full-beam when we stopped. Stupid old car.’ I bit my lip and gazed out of the windscreen at the darkness. 

‘It’s okay. Someone will come past. There’s always traffic just before dawn. The tradeys will save us. What time is it now?’ 

'Two A.M.’ 

The baby moved suddenly, a quick jolt from whatever it was dreaming about. We both jumped, catching each other’s eye and laughing, despite ourselves.  

‘Poor lamb. Thank God we found him,’ I said, clutching at the baby’s balled fist, trying to get some warmth into it. 

She nodded.  

‘He’s not warming up.’  I cradled him gently in my arms. 

‘It’s going to start getting cold in here now that we can’t start the engine,’ Natia said, ‘You keep an eye on him out there.’ She locked her door. 

‘Could you grab my jacket for me?’ I asked, ‘Under the box on the back seat…yeah.’  

Natia grabbed the jacket, fetching one for herself from the depths of her backpack while she was back there. She passed me mine. It was a seventies-style sheepskin number, with a woollen lining. Gabe had always hated it, which is why I’d brought it along on the trip. I had planned to be wearing it when I dumped him. Now I draped it over the sleeping baby, leaving a small space for its weary little face, so that it could breathe.  

Natia’s coat was hairy – covered in bright purple fake fur. She turned it inside out so that the fur was against her skin and laid it across herself like a blanket. ‘You don’t wanna know how many muppets died to make this thing,’ she muttered, squirming around until she was comfortable. 

My eyes were glued to the man’s legs across the road. ‘I’m sure they had it coming,’ I said absently. ‘Hey I’m going to turn the headlights off now. I really want to keep an eye on him, but the car might start if we give the battery a rest?’ 

‘Yeah worth a shot.’ 

I twisted a knob on the dashboard, and in a snap, the road and its unconscious man were swallowed up by the night. The dim green light from the radio did its best to compensate. I reached out and turned the keys in the ignition to ‘off.’ The radio blinked out, and a profound darkness flooded the car.  

I could have sworn that I could feel it seeping into my skin, penetrating my bones like an x-ray. I listened to the rain that was now drumming against the roof, and to the wind whispering its soft threats through the thin crack somewhere behind me. 

‘Can we turn it on again?’ Natia asked. ‘Just the radio? Is that okay?’ 

‘Hell yes,’  

I turned it back on. 

Natia re-appeared like a green ghost beside me. She was sitting with her back to the door, sideways in the seat, facing me. 

‘Hey,’ she said, her dark eyes flashing in the weak green light. 

‘Yeah?’ 

‘What if he isn’t crazy?’ 

‘What?! Did you see him?!’ 

‘Yeah! Up close. But… okay, I thought whoever left it in the box would have to have been some crusty meth-head, y’know? But that fella's dressed like a banker or something.’ 

‘Bankers do meth.’ 

Natia pursed her lips and tilted her head. 

‘Well… everyone does ice these days, right?’ I offered. ‘It’s an epidemic.’ 

‘He looked strung out, yeah,’ Natia admitted. ‘But I would be too if I had some …devil baby in the house.’ 

‘He’s not a devilbaby!’ I cooed, putting my hand over the jacket where the baby’s ear would be. 

‘It might be! Why else would a banker leave a baby on the road… with THAT note?’ 

‘Meth!’ I announced to the ceiling. ‘Mental illness? Both probably, I don’t know. Look, let’s not go blaming the poor baby for this situation, okay? Meth-dad is way more likely than a devilbaby.’ 

‘Okay, you’re right. I’m sorry.’ Natia shook her head and closed her eyes.  ‘It’s stupid. But…’ 

‘But what?’ 

‘Maybe don’t use our names? While it’s listening. Just in case.’ 

I sighed, adjusting the jacket, worrying that I might have closed the little opening for the baby’s face when I was covering his ear. 

‘Okay, sure.’ 

‘Like it’s 99% not a devil baby. But I’m real unlucky.’ 

I sighed a shaky sigh and stared out at the night. I couldn’t see the other side of the road now that the headlights were off. For all I knew, he could be slinking around the back of the car now. 

‘Don’t worry girl, someone’s gonna drive past in a minute. They’ll stop when they see him lying there.’ 

‘Okay.’ 

‘Anyway, I’ll protect you.’ 

 

..... 

The night howled on. Cold rain fell through the wind in heavy, unending sheets. The bush rang with the sound of it, and I can hear it now as I sit here safe in my apartment, sitting at the desk at my laptop with every single light in my apartment firmly switched on.  Even now, the sound of rain on a car roof sends me into a deep, unhinged panic. My heart takes off at a gallop and I feel like I’m suffocating in my own skin, like I need to get away from myself somehow. And when this happens, if I don’t leave the car immediately, my mind can feel like it’s about to unravel. I don’t know if that’s what everyone else feels when they have a panic attack.  I never had one before that night to compare notes.  

Not a single car came along that road. I don’t remember falling asleep. Natia had drifted off first, after what seemed like hours of silence. I had fought it for as long as I could, keeping watch for the man outside, and checking on the baby, who still showed no signs of stirring. Eventually, the steady drumming of the rain and Natia’s soft breathing led me to sleep. My head would drop forwards, jerk back with a snap five or six times before finally finding comfort against the headrest behind me. 

I felt a tugging at my lap. My dream painted a picture of Bowie, my cat moving about on my knees. I put a hand out to quiet the restless animal, but my fingers didn’t find his familiar soft fur. They brushed against something cold.

‘Something old,’ my sleeping mind told me. The words tumbled lazily over each other:  

… old… cold… old… cold…

I frowned at the persistent loop, throwing a sturdier word at the annoying rhyme. ‘Very,’ I murmured in the dark. 

The sound of my own voice woke me, and I blinked groggily at the ceiling of the car. For a minute, I had no idea where I was and I almost called out for Gabe. No, not Gabe. That was over. I saw his face swimming in the waters of my retreating dream. I dissolved the vision of him with a lazy flick of my thoughts. Who was I with now?  

Someone was here - a friend …and something else. 

I could feel it sitting on my knees, and I knew that it was looking at me. I clenched my eyes tighter, shutting out the very idea.  

‘Don’t look,’ I thought. ‘Don’t look.’ It was the voice that speaks to you when you’re in danger that usually says ‘run,’ or ‘hide.’ 

The thing grabbed at my thigh with its little clawed hand, and I found myself glaring at it before I could stop myself.  

The baby was sitting upright at the end of my knees. Its back was bent slightly forwards, for balance. It tilted its heavy head at me in a slow measured movement. With its face in shadow, lit from behind by the green light of the radio, it looked for all the world like a tiny old man perched there. I had stopped breathing. The thing watched me with wide blue eyes. It released my thigh from its grip and leaned forward, its eyes widening.  

It’s hard to describe the way it moved. It was steady and measured - so unlike a newborn. Its head wobbled slightly as it shifted its weight to keep itself upright.  

’What’s your name?’…’ it asked in a soft, sweet voice.  

I gasped. My knee-jerk reaction was to answer, ‘Kate’ out of sheer shock. I actually went to answer, if you can believe that, but no word would come. It’s one of the few times in my life that I have forgotten my own name, probably because I’d just woken up, and I’d just been startled by a talking newborn.   

It sensed my hesitation immediately and its eyes flicked to the box in the back seat. I thought of the hand written note, and the baby’s eyes shot to me, flashing in the dark.  

What happened next is impossible to put into words. I’m embarrassed to even try, but I’m almost drunk enough to take a stab at it. I’m going to take a break to polish off this bottle and then I’m going to sit back down at the laptop and drag this private trauma of mine out into the light. Just know that there are no words in any language that can describe what that thing did to me.
