I was a sixteen-year-old loser, or at least that's what everyone at school said. My lanky frame, oversized glasses, and love for books made me an easy target. Every day felt like an uphill battle, with bullies always finding new ways to make me feel smaller.



Home wasn't much better. My mom had left us a year ago, and her absence was a wound that never healed. Dad and I barely spoke, and when we did, it was usually a fight. Like tonight.



"I'm trying my best, Dad!" I shouted, my voice trembling with frustration.



"Well, your best isn't good enough, Jacob!" he yelled back, his face red with anger. "Your mother left because she couldn't handle this... this mess."



His words cut deeper than any bully's fist. I stormed out of the living room, slamming the door behind me. I retreated to my sanctuary, my bedroom, and threw myself onto the bed. Tears stung my eyes as I stared at the ceiling, feeling utterly hopeless.



It was then that I noticed something strange. A tall, shadowy figure standing on my balcony, barely visible in the moonlight. My heart pounded in my chest as I watched it move closer, and then, a knock on the door.



I hesitated, fear and curiosity warring within me. Slowly, I got up and opened the door. The figure stepped into the light, revealing an eerie, almost otherworldly presence. It was tall, impossibly so, with eyes that seemed to pierce right through me.



"Who are you?" I managed to stammer.



"I am Jyestha, a harbinger of change," the figure said in a voice that was both soothing and terrifying. "I can grant you one wish, Jacob. Anything your heart desires."



My mind raced. One wish. Anything. The possibilities were endless, but only one thing came to mind. "I wish for power," I said, my voice steady. "I want to be strong, so no one can ever hurt me again."



Jyestha's eyes seemed to glow with approval. "Very well. But remember, power comes with a price."



Before I could ask what that meant, Jyestha vanished, leaving me alone in my room. I felt a strange sensation course through my body, a surge of energy that made me feel invincible. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw the changes immediately. My scrawny frame was gone, replaced by a muscular, imposing figure. I felt stronger, more confident than ever before.



The next day at school, I walked through the halls with my head held high. The bullies who had tormented me for years cowered in my presence. I reveled in my newfound power, but something felt off. As the days passed, I noticed a growing darkness within me, a rage that I couldn't control.



One evening, as I stood on the balcony, Jyestha appeared again. "How do you like your wish?" it asked.



"It's... different," I admitted. "But I feel like something's wrong."



Jyestha nodded. "Power without control is a dangerous thing, Jacob. And now, it is time to pay the price."



Suddenly, I felt an unbearable pain in my chest. I doubled over, gasping for breath. The darkness inside me grew, consuming me from within. My vision blurred, and I collapsed to the floor, my body convulsing.



As I lay there, struggling to breathe, Jyestha's voice echoed in my mind. "You wished for power, but power without restraint leads to destruction. Your wish has become your fatality."



The last thing I saw before everything went black was Jyestha, watching me with those piercing eyes, as if it had known all along what would happen. My final thought was a regretful realization: some wishes are better left unmade.

Days turned into weeks, and the halls of my school were quieter now. My absence left a mark, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked desires. The bullies no longer had their favorite target, but the atmosphere was heavy with an unspoken lesson.



At home, Dad was a different man. The arguments ceased, replaced by a somber silence. He never spoke about the night I collapsed, but I knew he blamed himself. He spent hours in my room, sitting on my bed, staring at the walls covered in posters of heroes and worlds I once dreamed of.



One night, I found myself on that same balcony, looking at the stars. The pain in my chest was a constant reminder of my choice. I wished for power, but it came at a cost I hadn't foreseen. Jyestha had given me what I asked for, but I was paying the price every day.



Jyestha appeared again, a shadowy silhouette against the moonlit sky. "Regret is a heavy burden, Jacob," it said softly.



"Why?" I asked, my voice weak. "Why did you grant my wish if it would destroy me?"



Jyestha's eyes glowed with a mix of pity and wisdom. "Every choice has consequences, Jacob. I am not here to judge, only to fulfill. You sought power to escape pain, but true strength lies in understanding and accepting our vulnerabilities."



Tears streamed down my face. "I didn't know. I just wanted the pain to stop."



Jyestha nodded. "Pain is part of growth, Jacob. It shapes us, makes us who we are. Power without understanding leads to ruin. Remember this."



With that, Jyestha vanished once more, leaving me alone with my thoughts. The darkness inside me was still there, but I felt a flicker of something else—hope. Maybe, just maybe, I could learn from this. I could find a way to rebuild, to become stronger in a different way.



The road ahead was uncertain, but I knew one thing for sure: I would face it, not with unchecked power, but with the strength to endure, to learn, and to grow. And perhaps, one day, I would find a way to forgive myself for the wish that changed everything.

Weeks passed, and I struggled with the weight of my decisions and the unrelenting pain. My body had become a battleground of power and darkness, each fighting for dominance. Despite my efforts to control it, the darkness grew stronger each day, and my strength waned.



I often thought of my mom, wondering if she would have been able to help me. The longing for her warmth and understanding was a constant ache. Dad tried his best, but the guilt and sorrow in his eyes were too much to bear.



One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of red and gold, I felt an overwhelming surge of darkness. It was unlike anything I'd felt before—an ominous, all-consuming void that threatened to swallow me whole.



I knew then that my time was running out. I stumbled to the balcony, clutching my chest as the pain intensified. The world around me seemed to blur and fade, and I could barely keep my balance.



Jyestha appeared once more, standing tall and silent, an imposing shadow against the twilight. "Jacob," it said softly, "the time has come."



I looked up at Jyestha, tears streaming down my face. "Is there no way to undo this? To go back to how things were?"



Jyestha shook its head. "The choices we make cannot be undone, Jacob. They shape our destiny. But there is peace to be found in acceptance."



As the darkness consumed me, I felt a strange sense of calm. The pain began to fade, replaced by a numbness that spread through my body. I sank to the floor, my vision growing dimmer with each passing moment.



My last thoughts were of my dad, and of the life I had wished to escape. I realized then that true strength wasn't about power or control, but about facing our fears and embracing our vulnerabilities.



Jyestha knelt beside me, its eyes filled with a sorrow that mirrored my own. "Rest now, Jacob," it whispered. "Your journey is over."



As I closed my eyes for the last time, I felt a profound sense of peace. The darkness that had once consumed me was now a distant memory, and I drifted into the abyss, free from the burdens of my wishes and regrets.

In the days that followed, the news of my passing spread through the school, leaving a void that was felt by all who knew me. My dad, though heartbroken, found solace in the memories we had shared. He often visited my room, finding comfort in the remnants of the life I had lived.



The bullies who had tormented me were left to ponder the consequences of their actions, and a sense of remorse began to take root in their hearts. The lesson of my story became a silent reminder of the importance of compassion and understanding.



Jyestha, the harbinger of change, vanished into the shadows, its role fulfilled. It knew that my story would serve as a beacon for others, a testament to the power of choice and the true meaning of strength.



And so, my legacy lived on, not in the power I had sought, but in the lessons learned and the hearts touched by my journey. My story was a reminder that some wishes are better left unmade, and that true strength lies in accepting and embracing our vulnerabilities.

My heart did the final steps
