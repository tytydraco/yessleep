Growing up in the remote wilderness of northern Canada, I always heard stories of the Wendigo. My grandfather told me tales of a creature so terrifying that even the bravest of men trembled at the mere mention of its name. But I never truly believed in the legend until one dark, snowy night.

&#x200B;

The whistling started faintly at first, like a haunting tune carried on the frigid wind. But it grew louder and more insistent like it was calling out to me personally. I tried to ignore it and kept hiking, but the whistling persisted, creeping closer and closer until I couldn’t ignore it any longer.

&#x200B;

I peered into the darkness beside me and saw a figure standing in the woods. It was tall and thin, with skin stretched tightly over its bones, and its eyes glowed grey with a fierce hunger. I knew instantly what it was - the Wendigo. The instant I noticed it in the woods, it stopped whistling for a moment and twisted its head like it was intrigued that I had given in to its call.

&#x200B;

It began to whistle again, a melody so haunting that it seemed to penetrate my very soul. It was like it was trying to hypnotize me, to lure me into the woods where it could claim me for its own.

&#x200B;

I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move as it began to creep closer and closer. Its claws and teeth gleamed in the moonlight, and I knew that if it reached me, it would be the end.

&#x200B;

I turned to continue hiking, I just needed to get back to my cabin I told myself. But then, it started snarling. The whistling faltered for just a moment as I heard its footsteps thumping through the woods. I grabbed the knife my grandfather gave me as a boy from my bag ready to strike. When my grandfather gave me this knife he told me to always keep it close because it might just save my life one day. 

&#x200B;

As soon as I heard the Wendigo break through the tree line I threw it with all my might. It hit the creature square in the chest, and it let out a blood-curdling scream. It writhed in agony as I watched, frozen with terror. But then, to my horror, it began to change.

&#x200B;

Its skin began to peel away in strips, revealing a twisted and gnarled form underneath. Its limbs elongated and twisted into new shapes, its jaws unhinged to reveal rows of razor-sharp teeth. It was transforming into something even more monstrous than before.

&#x200B;

I turned and ran as fast as I could, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear the Wendigo behind me, its ragged breaths and pounding footsteps echoing through the trees. I struggled with all my might to get away, my feet slipping and sliding on the snow and ice.

&#x200B;

Just as I thought I wouldn't be able to escape, I heard a branch snap behind me. I didn’t dare look back, but I felt in my stomach that the creature was still close behind.

&#x200B;

I pushed myself harder, running as fast as I could. I could see the lights of my cabin in the distance, a beacon of safety in the darkness. With a final burst of adrenaline, I threw myself through the door of my cabin and slammed it shut behind me. I leaned against the door, gasping for breath and shaking with fear.

&#x200B;

I could hear the Wendigo outside, snarling and whistling. But my grandfather always told me they couldn’t come inside as long as I kept the door locked.

&#x200B;

I stayed there for what felt like hours, too scared to move. But eventually, the snarling and whistling stopped, and I knew that the creature had moved on. I didn't manage to sleep that night, but hours after the sun came up, I carefully opened the door and went back outside and into the woods.

&#x200B;

I followed my own footsteps in the snow. The Wendigo's nowhere to be seen, as if it hadn't been stomping into the ground with what sounded like an earth-shattering force. About halfway to where I thought I had first seen the Wendigo, I found a tree. Mangled, split in half and laid out diagonally across the path, I realized this tree was how I was able to get away. Then I thought back to what my grandfather said about the knife. Maybe the knife made the tree get in the way. Maybe not.

&#x200B;

Either way, I never forgot that night. For years after that night, I lived in constant fear of the Wendigo's return. Every time the wind whistled through the trees, or a stray twig snapped in the woods, I would freeze, waiting for the sound of that haunting melody.
