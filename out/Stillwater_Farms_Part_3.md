***— Day 3 —***

I woke to light pressing through the curtains, soft and too clean, as if the night before hadn’t happened at all. My body ached in a dozen quiet places—legs, shoulders, throat—the kind of ache that feels earned but not remembered. The room smelled faintly of wet clothes and wine, a ghost of a night that was left in the dark.

El lay half-turned toward me, her hair tangled across the pillow, humming under her breath. A tune I recognized only by rhythm: slow, circling, the same one that had pulsed through the fields the night before. She opened her eyes and smiled like she’d been awake for hours.

“Morning,” she whispered. “I haven’t slept that well in forever.”

Her calm felt foreign. My mind still buzzed with flashes of the festival: the pounding drum, the blur of movement, the shadow at the treeline that hadn’t joined in. I told her about it, careful not to sound afraid, but she only laughed softly.

“You probably just drank too much,” she said. “Or got spooked by Abel without a shirt on.”

I tried to smile. “Yeah. Probably.”

“It was fun though, right? For once we didn’t have to think.”

She sat up, stretching until her joints popped.

“This place… it feels different. Like I can just exist for a second without feeling like I’m falling behind.”

I wanted to agree, but the words stuck in my throat. The image of that dark figure lingered behind my eyelids.

I kissed El on the forehead and smiled. My fear wouldn’t be hers.

The breakfast bell carried through the fields, clear and steady. El was already on her feet, pulling on her boots with the half-dance of someone still in last night’s mood. I followed slower, every motion deliberate, grounding myself in ordinary things: laces, sleeves, the weight of my jacket.

The kitchen was bright when we entered. Mae moved between stove and counter with her usual ease, flipping hot cakes that hissed against the pan. Ruth stood by the open door, sleeves rolled, letting in the smell of morning grass. Jonah was already seated, a bandage on his hand that he claimed was from “drumming too hard.” Abel watched from the head of the table, eyes half-closed, content.

“Morning, loves,” Mae said as we came in. “You all danced yourselves half to death last night.”

El grinned, sliding into a chair. “Worth it.”

Nick and Hailey followed a minute later: him bleary-eyed, her appearing chipper and yet oddly quiet.

Ruth poured water into glasses. “The ground’s quiet today,” she said without turning. “Still listening.”

I glanced up. “Listening for what?”

“For the next thing worth hearing.” She smiled faintly, as if that explained everything.

Mae set down a plate in front of me. “Eat up, sweetheart. You look like you’ve been wrestling ghosts.”

I forced a small laugh and picked up my fork.

The table filled with clinking and chatter. Jonah teased Hailey about her dance moves; Nick fired back with something about rhythm. Even Harlan cracked a smile. It all sounded normal—light, warm, human.

I watched them through the steam of my plate, searching for any hint of recognition of the fever that had taken us over the night before. But there was nothing. Just sunlight in the windows, the scrape of cutlery, and the easy murmur of people who had decided to start fresh.

I felt like an outsider, unable to shake the sense that something here was being carefully hidden. If I hadn’t been so afraid of ruining the mood, so desperate not to be the skeptic in the room, maybe things would’ve turned out differently.

\*\*\*

By late morning, the air had grown heavy and still, the kind of heat that presses down on everything until even the birds stop moving.

The others drifted toward their chores without being told: El helping Mae with dishes, Nick volunteering to haul feed from the shed, Hailey following just to stay close.

I lingered by the porch, watching the field bend under the wind, the rhythm of the place too steady to be natural.

From where I stood, I could see Ruth hanging white linens on the line near the well. They swayed like ghosts, their edges brushing the damp grass.

A few steps away, Jonah crouched beside a block of wood, sharpening tools with slow, deliberate strokes. The sound carried—steel scraping stone—measured, patient, endless.

Down near the barn, Harlan sat on an overturned bucket, his big hands moving carefully through Clara’s hair as he braided it. She sat cross-legged at his feet, still as a doll, her fingers stained red, while he worked with the focus of someone mending something precious.

Abel stepped outside with a basket of jars, sunlight glinting off the glass.

“Don’t just stand there brooding,” he said, his voice light and steady. “There’s always something to lend a hand to.”

“I’m just catching my breath,” I said.

He smiled, though his eyes didn’t quite follow the expression. “Then breathe deep. The air’s good for you here.”

Nick returned from the shed, shirt clinging to his back, irritation already burning behind his eyes.

“Been looking for that feed scoop for fifteen minutes,” he said, frustrated.

Hailey trailed behind him, voice low. “Maybe just ask next time?”

He spun, not unkind, but sharper than needed. “I did. Jonah said it’s ‘where it needs to be.’ Whatever that means.”

I tried to laugh it off. “Maybe it’s farmer code for ‘figure it out yourself.’”

Nick didn’t laugh. He wiped his hands on his jeans and muttered, “Can’t wait to get out of here tomorrow.”

El appeared then, wiping flour from her hands, her cheeks flushed. “Mae wants help with lunch,” she said to me, a smile beaming from her face like the sun.

Her smile always warmed my spirit.

Ruth called from across the yard, “Don’t wander far, darlings. Heat like this turns quick.”

I didn’t know what she meant until I realized the horizon had gone pale, the air shivering faintly above the fields.

For a second, everything went quiet again.

Just the hum of flies, the soft swing of the laundry line, and the metallic ring of Jonah’s sharpening stone.

\*\*\*

By noon, the house had truly settled into its quiet rhythm.

El stayed behind with Mae, helping in the kitchen; the sound of pots clattered faintly through the open windows.

Nick had gone with Jonah and Harlan to split firewood near the treeline, their laughter carrying now and then through the trees.

That left Hailey and me.

Ruth pressed a burlap sack into my hands and told us to gather herbs and kindling “before the light goes soft.”

Her tone was casual, but her eyes lingered a second too long.

We set off toward the meadow, the heat humming over the fields, air thick enough to chew.

Hailey walked a few paces ahead, a sickle glinting at her side, her braid sticking to the back of her neck.

For a while, neither of us spoke. Just the rasp of grass brushing our legs, the low buzz of insects, the throb of the sun.

Then she said, without looking at me, “Feels weird being here with you.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Honestly, I didn’t think I’d ever see you again, let alone… this.”

She laughed under her breath: quick, real, almost nostalgic.

“Remember that party behind Miller’s barn? You said you could shotgun a beer faster than me.”

“I could,” I said.

“You threw up.”

“Strategic distraction.”

She smiled at that, finally glancing over her shoulder. “You haven’t changed much.”

“Neither have you,” I said.

“Yeah, I have.” She bent to cut a sprig of mint. “I used to think people always said that because they didn’t pay attention. Now I think it’s because they don’t want to.”

The humor drained slowly, replaced by the kind of silence that sits heavy between breaths.

She kept her eyes on the plants as she spoke again. “You believe all this?”

“All what?”

“This whole setup. The smiles, the rules, the weird speeches about the land.”

I shrugged, trying not to show my cards fully. “Yeah, it’s, uh… felt off.”

She clipped another stem, her knuckles pale. “Last night I woke up. Heard footsteps outside our cabin—and then they were inside. Slow, dragging ones. They stopped at our door. Then nothing.”

Her voice thinned, eyes shimmering, clearly shaken. “Nick was passed out drunk. He didn’t even try to wake up.”

The wind shifted, and I caught the scent of rain—or something that wanted to be rain.

“I believe you,” I said quietly. “You know I heard something too. In the barn, before the festival.”

She looked up. “What kind of something?”

I hesitated. “Silas and Harlan. They were cutting animals apart—not in the normal way either. These animals had no business being skinned together. And they said something about being ready for tomorrow night.”

Hailey’s eyes flicked to mine. “Tomorrow night? So like… tonight?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Didn’t sound like another celebration.”

For a long moment, neither of us moved. The whole meadow felt like it was holding its breath.

Then she said, “We should go. Tonight, before the sun goes down.”

I nodded. “I’ve been thinking the same thing.”

We walked in silence after that, gathering herbs we didn’t care to name. The wind hissed through the grass, and somewhere far off, a crow called once and didn’t call again.

She handed me the bag, her hand brushing mine. “If something happens, we stick together, yeah?”

I hesitated, thinking of El.

“Ew—not like that, asshole,” Hailey said, catching my pause. “Nick’s just— I just need to know someone’s got my back, okay?”

“Yeah,” I said. “I’ve got your back, Hails.”

She smiled.

When we turned back, Ruth was already waiting at the edge of the field, her arms crossed, the sun flaring behind her.

She smiled that calm, careful smile. “Find what you needed?”

Hailey held up the bag. “More or less.”

Ruth’s eyes lingered on her for a beat, then on me. “Good. Mae’s calling everyone in. Best not keep her waiting.”

As we followed her back toward the house, Hailey whispered, “She’s suspicious.”

I didn’t answer. Because I’d seen it too: the faint shimmer of recognition in Ruth’s eyes, like she’d already heard every word we’d said before we’d even spoken it.

\*\*\*

The house felt heavier after lunch.

The others drifted off to their tasks again. El stayed in the kitchen, humming beside Mae as they cleaned the dishes. I caught sight of Hailey carrying folded sheets toward the clothesline, and Nick was passed out on the couch, clearly trying to fight off a hangover and the heat.

No one noticed when I slipped down the hall.

The hallway creaked differently when I was alone: the sound sharp, uncertain, like it disapproved of where I was going. At the end, past the parlor and the old cabinet full of porcelain saints, sat a door I hadn’t seen open since we’d arrived: Mae and Abel’s room.

I waited a long moment, listening. Only the slow tick of the grandfather clock downstairs. 

I slid into the room, closing the door behind me.

The smell hit first: lavender and old paper, a sweetness gone stale, the scent of age.

The curtains were drawn tight, the air unmoving. Everything in the room was neat to the point of obsession: a perfectly made bed, an old Bible on the nightstand, a half-knitted scarf resting beside a glass of cloudy water.

I didn’t know what I was looking for. Proof, maybe. Or just a reason to trust my own paranoia.

I started with the drawers: socks, folded handkerchiefs, a small wooden comb. Nothing strange. Then I opened the wardrobe.

Hanging dresses lined one side, pressed so close together they looked like a single body. The other side held coats, a walking stick, and a tin box on the floor.

When I lifted the lid, my stomach turned.

Inside were the condoms El and I had packed. I stared at them for a long time, the implication crawling in slow.

Below the box lay a leather-bound book. Small and ancient: plain, worn at the corners, its spine reinforced with twine. No title. Just initials stamped faintly in the corner: *M.S.*

I opened it.

The first few pages were dated so far back the ink had turned brown. Each entry was short, careful, written in the same elegant hand:

*Ruth \[redacted\] — Water given, age 37.*

*Jonah \[redacted\] — Water given, age 29.*

*Silas \[redacted\] — Water given, age 18.*

*Abel \[redacted\] — Water given, age 56.*

Each line clean, deliberate. 

Then, a different surname:

*Harlan \[redacted // different from the rest\] — Water given, age 35. Spared. Biological father of Clara \[redacted\].*

I turned the page.

*Clara \[redacted\] — Water given, age 13. Premature. Illness cured.*

The handwriting dipped slightly there, the pen pressed harder into the page. Below it were faint smudges—fingerprints, maybe tears—and then newer entries. Names I didn’t know. Couples. Dates. Some followed by *returned.* Others simply stopped.

My mouth went dry.

I flipped further and found sketches in the margins—outlines of cabins, lists of supplies, small notes: *arrival confirmed, water prepared, child carried to term.*

Every word hummed with precision, with control.

A floorboard creaked behind me.

I snapped the book shut and froze.

Then the doorknob turned.

I dipped into the wardrobe without thinking, pulling the doors nearly closed but leaving a sliver to breathe through. My pulse thudded in my ears, so loud I thought it might give me away.

The door opened.

Abel’s silhouette filled the doorway, haloed faintly by the dim hall light. He didn’t speak. Just stood there a moment, listening.

The air seemed to fold in on itself.

Abel stepped inside. His boots moved slow across the floorboards: soft, deliberate thuds, like he was counting each step. I could see him through the narrow seam of light between the wardrobe doors. His outline drifted between the bed and the dresser, the slope of his shoulders hunched in thought.

He murmured something under his breath, too quiet to catch, and set something down on the nightstand. Glass clinked faintly.

I pressed myself back against the coats, trying to keep the wood from creaking. My throat itched, desperate for a swallow that would sound too loud.

Abel moved to the window and drew the curtains back. Light spilled across the room, cutting the wardrobe in half. I could see the edge of his reflection in the mirror; his pale eyes, scanning the space, unfocused yet searching.

He stayed there for a long time, breathing through his nose. Slow. Controlled.

Then he whispered—not to me, not to anyone.

“Can’t keep outrunning the well forever.”

The words settled in the room like dust.

He reached for the glass on the nightstand and drank. The sound of it—the soft glug of water, the sigh that followed—felt unbearably human.

Then he left.

The floor creaked again, once, twice, then silence.

I stayed inside the wardrobe for what felt like hours, afraid that if I moved too soon, the house would hear me.

When I finally pushed the doors open, the air outside felt cooler, like I’d climbed out of a grave.

I forced myself to breathe again, leaving the room exactly how I had found it—except for the ledger now hidden in my waistband.

\*\*\*

I lived the next few hours entirely inside my own head.

Every sound felt sharper: the creak of a floorboard, the buzz of a fly against the window, the low murmur of voices from the kitchen. I moved through it all half-aware, waiting for a moment when the others would be separated from the family, when I could finally show them what I’d found.

By the time the sun dipped low and the air turned syrupy with evening, we had all drifted back to the guest cabin to change before dinner. For the first time all day, we were alone.

And that’s when everything broke loose.

I closed the door behind me and pulled the ledger from my waistband, setting it hard on the table.

Hailey jumped at the sound. “What the hell is that?”

“My proof,” I said. “That we need to leave. Tonight.”

Nick groaned from where he sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing his eyes. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”

“Just read it,” I said.

Hailey was the first to step forward. She flipped the cover open, fingers shaking just slightly. Her eyes traced the page, her mouth parting as she read the careful lines. “Ruth—Water given, age thirty-seven… Harlan—spared…” She turned another page, her voice lowering. “It goes back generations.”

Nick snorted. “So what? Maybe it’s genealogy. Families keep records.”

“This isn’t a family tree,” I said. “It’s a list. Names, ages, what they did to them. It’s organized like an inventory.”

Hailey shut the book and stared at me. “So you’re saying what? They’re… drowning people?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “But something’s happening here. And it’s not a vacation.”

Hailey’s jaw tightened. She took a breath, then another, her voice trembling but strong.

“You want to know what I think?” she said. “I think something’s wrong here. Every time I look around, it’s like they already know what we’re going to do next—like they’re moving us around on some board we can’t see. And then last night I woke up and heard the same sounds Alex did. Someone, or something, is fucking with us.”

Her eyes flicked to Nick. “You were out cold. I tried to shake you awake.”

Nick sighed. “Hailey, I was drunk. You probably heard Jonah going to the barn.”

“It wasn’t Jonah,” she said. “It felt like something was looking right at me.”

She swallowed, anger catching in her throat. “And Ruth—she keeps staring. Every time she passes me, she smiles like she knows something I don’t. Like she’s already decided what I am to her.”

Nick straightened. “Oh, so that’s what this is about.”

She blinked. “What?”

“You’re still hung up on Ruth. I thought we got past that jealousy thing.”

Hailey’s face went blank, then cold.

“That’s what you think this is? Jealousy?”

He rubbed his temples. “Hailey, I’m saying you’re reading into things again. You do this—”

“No,” she snapped, standing. “You don’t get it. You never listen until it’s too late.”

The room went still.

“Fine,” she said, voice shaking now. “Guess we’ll all just die then. Maybe that’ll finally get your attention.”

She shoved past me and slammed the door hard enough to rattle the glass.

The silence that followed was thick, claustrophobic.

El sighed and sat on the bed beside Nick, her tone soft but steady. “She’s scared. We all are. But running off in the dark isn’t the answer.”

“Staying isn’t either,” I said. “They’ve lied to us since the moment we got here. This book proves it.”

“Or maybe it’s just history,” El said gently. “You’re seeing patterns that aren’t there, Alex. You’ve done that before.”

I flinched like she’d slapped me.

Nick looked up from his hands. “She’s right, man. You’ve been wound tight since we got here. Let it go for one night. We’ll head out in the morning, clear heads, full tank.”

“One night,” I repeated, barely recognizing my own voice.

El reached over, brushing her hand against my arm. “It’s almost over. Just breathe, okay?”

I looked at her, at the calm certainty in her eyes, the way she trusted this place completely—and I felt something inside me start to unravel.

“Fine,” I said finally. “We stay. But don’t drink the water. Any of it.”

Nick frowned. “The hell does that mean?”

“Just don’t,” I said. “Please.”

No one answered. The air felt thick with unspoken things.

Nick leaned back on the bed, muttering something about headaches and superstition. El stayed by the window, the last of the light catching her hair like something holy.

I sat at the table, staring at the closed ledger, listening to the slow tick of the clock above the door.

In the heat of everything I forgot to mention the condoms. Looking back, maybe that would’ve convinced her.

\*\*\*

The dinner bell rang while the sky was still streaked with gold, the kind of sunset that pretends everything’s fine.

Nick was already up and stretching, pretending not to look at me. El was brushing out her hair in the mirror, her reflection soft, distant.

We walked back to the main house together, the air heavy and sweet with the smell of bread and smoke.

Hailey didn’t reappear until we reached the porch—her eyes red, her mouth set. She didn’t look at any of us, except a quick glance of defeat in my direction.

Mae met us at the door, beaming like a hostess expecting company.

“There you are,” she said, voice warm as syrup. “Thought you’d gone and forgotten us.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Nick said, forcing a grin.

Inside, the long table was set with candles and polished silver, more formal than any meal before. Plates were already waiting, steaming with roast and vegetables glistening with butter.

Glasses sat beside each one, filled halfway with clear water. That was the first thing I noticed.

Abel sat at the head, his expression calm but distant, the faintest tremor in his hand as he reached for his napkin. Ruth and Jonah spoke in low tones at the far end, their laughter practiced. Silas kept glancing toward the windows, toward the woods, like he was waiting for something.

Mae clasped her hands together. “Before we eat,” she said, “we give thanks to the land that keeps us.”

The family followed suit, heads bowed.

I hesitated, then did the same.

Abel’s voice came next, low and deliberate:

“From the water we’re born. To the water we return.”

The family echoed in unison, the words soft but full.

Then the clinking began: utensils against plates, chatter returning. Everything resumed as though the moment hadn’t happened.

El smiled at Mae. “This looks incredible.”

Mae reached across to touch her hand. “Cooked with love, dear. And patience.”

I watched their fingers meet, the faintest brush, and saw how El relaxed under the gesture.

Nick dug into his food with the appetite of someone determined to prove a point.

Hailey didn’t eat at all. She just kept turning her fork, eyes darting between the glasses and the door.

I reached for my glass, pretending to take a sip, letting the rim brush my lip without swallowing.

Across the table, Ruth raised her own glass. “To new friends,” she said.

Mae smiled, lifting hers. “And safe travels tomorrow.”

Her gaze lingered on us a moment too long.

I hesitated just long enough for Mae’s eyes to flick toward me. It wasn’t suspicion exactly, more like curiosity, like she could see the thought forming in my head before I had it.

I forced a smile and lifted my glass just high enough to catch the candlelight. “To... good company,” I said.

Hailey didn’t raise hers. She just kept her gaze fixed on the table, her knuckles white around the fork.

Dinner carried on. Laughter. Compliments. The hum of comfort that didn’t belong to me.

When the plates were cleared, Mae stood, smoothing her apron.

“Well,” she said, her tone soft and final, “let’s call it an early night. You all have quite the journey ahead of you tomorrow.”

Nick laughed lightly. “You trying to get rid of us already?”

Mae smiled. “Never, dear. But the land knows when to rest, and so should we.”

As we filed out, I caught movement at the top of the stairs—a shape half-lost in shadow.

An old man, tall and thin, watching from the landing. His skin pale as dust, his eyes black and still as glass.

He didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Just watched.

When I looked again, he was gone.

We stepped back into the night, the air cooler now, the last traces of daylight gone from the hills.

El laughed about something Jonah said, her voice small against the emptiness around us.

But all I could hear was the echo of Abel’s voice at the table: *from the water we’re born, to the water we return.*

\*\*\*

We decided to all sleep in the same room that night.

I asked for it over the soft clatter of teeth-brushing and the tired shuffle of getting ready—said it was just for tonight, just to make me feel better, just in case. El smiled like I was being sweet. Hailey gave me a soft smile and agreed. Nick rolled his eyes and dragged a spare blanket to the couch without comment.

We left the lamp low. Shadows from the window slats lay across the floorboards like a rib cage.

I sat in the chair at the corner of the room, boots still on, jacket folded within reach. I had told the girls to take the bed, and that I couldn’t get to sleep anyway. El’s breathing settled first. Hailey’s took longer, thinning out from tight and restless to slow, controlled. Nick tried to pretend he’d fallen asleep as soon as he hit the couch, but the couch springs gave him away every time he shifted.

The house clicked and ticked, a body cooling.

I waited for the world to grow heavy, the particular weight of night when the air itself feels like it’s listening. When it came, it came all at once. The crickets dulled. The wind went thin.

I stood up.

Hailey’s eyes were open, watching me from the bed. She didn’t say anything, just lifted her chin toward the door and mouthed, *Go.* Then she glanced at El and added, *I’ve got her.*

I nodded, laced my boots, shrugged into my jacket, and eased the door latch with two fingers, slow enough that the metal barely whispered.

I had one foot outside when the couch springs popped.

“Alex.”

Nick’s voice, low and sharp. “Where do you think you’re going?”

I turned. He was already on his feet, hair smashed to one side, face set.

“Keep your voice down,” I said.

“Not until you tell me what you’re doing.”

“Following them.”

“Following who?”

I tipped my head toward the dark window—toward the fields, the treeline. “You know who.”

He swore under his breath and crossed the room in three quick steps. “You’ve wound Hailey up. Now you’re sneaking out? Jesus, man.”

“I heard them yesterday,” I said. “At the barn. Silas. Harlan. Skinning animals into something that wasn’t one animal anymore. And they said something about being ready for ‘tomorrow night.’ That’s tonight.”

Nick rubbed a hand over his face. “You don’t know what you heard.”

“I know exactly what I heard.”

He let out a sound that wanted to be a laugh and wasn’t. “You sound like Mom.”

I felt that in my teeth. “Don’t.”

“You do,” he pressed, quieter now, mean only because he was scared. “The patterns. The cults she saw in mailmen and dog walkers. I’m not doing that again.”

“This isn’t like her,” I said. “I’m not guessing. I’m going to see.”

He stared at me, jaw tight, then past me to Hailey, who had sat up and was watching both of us like a referee already sick of the game.

“Then I’m coming with you,” he said. “Five minutes, then we’re done.”

“Fine.”

I looked at Hailey sitting up in the bed, Elenor still breathing in a soft sleep next to her.

“Lock the door,” I said.

She nodded once. “Go.”

We slipped into the hallway, then into the night.
