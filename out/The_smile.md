I paid more attention to the sound of the fan whirring than the man in front of me. I’ve heard a similar spiel four times—one for each moving van. It was near the start of my senior year, so my mom didn’t have much time to squeeze in another move before I was eighteen, but she would certainly try. At one point, I must have become too distracted because my mom was aggressively snapping her fingers in front of my face. 

“Oh, sorry, I missed that last part.” 

“You don’t have any extracurricular credits. Most students ignore it until graduation is in their faces. Please don’t be like most students.” I let out a little air at the last bit, not seeing the serious look on the man’s face. I’ve seen a fair share of principles. He looked more tired than most. “Don’t worry, I’ll sign up as quickly as possible.” The principal smiled. It was small, but enough to show he cared about the effort. 

“You won’t have to wait long. The only thing left is a tour where you can sign up, well me and your mom cover the specifics. I can get one of the students to show you around” He clicked the pager and asked for “Ivy”. While I waited for Ivy, I turned to my mom. I didn’t look like her. Unfortunately, my dad won in that department. Where her hair was brown, mine was black, her eyes were blue, mine were green. I was like her in every other way, though, and for that I was glad. I loved her dearly, but I couldn’t tell her what had happened the night before, for fear of sounding crazy.

The door creaked open and in stepped who I assumed to be Ivy. She was pretty. She had clearly dyed black shoulder-length hair and a scowl. 

“Hey Ivy, can you show this gentleman around?”

“Sure, I guess”

“Alright and show him the clubs”

“Can do”. With that and a quick goodbye saying I’d meet my mom at the house, we were off. She was quick, so quick there wasn’t much time for small talk. We winded through hallways, only stopping at the most important parts, like the bathrooms and the gym. The school was old. One hallway we walked down sported pictures of all the past senior classes, dating back to the 40s. It was apparent that most things in the school had been here since the start. Rusty lockers spanned most of the hallways, with breaks for water fountains that I certainly wouldn’t be trusting. We finally reached the poster with all the clubs.

“Got any good recommendations?” 

“Not really” It was clear she didn’t want to talk from the scowl she still wore, but I pushed forward.

“Well, which one did you pick?”

She didn’t answer for what felt like an eternity, and meanwhile, she seemed to be sizing me up. I grew increasingly uncomfortable. The clock above our heads seemed to signify each second she didn’t speak. The tenth click sounded, and she finally deemed me worthy.

“Have you noticed anything weird around town?” Despite the odd question, she was seemingly serious. I hadn’t been in town long. This was only my second day, but something stuck out 

“Yes?” 

“Were they smiling?” 

Last night, after a good chunk of the unpacking was over, I finally sat down, and then my mom called from the kitchen. 

“Hunny can you take out the garbage, please”

I let out a half groan, half yes, and made my way out of my room. She always managed to call at the worst times. I avoided some boxes that remained in my room and made my way to the door. The house was older, so it came with the occasional creak and groan. I was seventeen, so I was more than equipped to handle creaky floorboards. But it was still eerie. The one place that needed a light bulb was the hallway where I was currently making my way down. Each step resounded in a creak. My brain knew my mom was right around the corner in the living room, but my body didn’t. The feeling of dread was similar to when I was a child, weighing the risks of leaving my safe bed to walk to the bathroom where anything could lie in wait. I turned the corner, expecting to see my mom on the sofa. She wasn’t. The feeling persisted. I was (almost) a grown man whose nerves were shot over something like low lighting and creaky floorboards. I subconsciously slapped myself and made my way to the kitchen. My back faced the living room as I pulled the garbage bag out. Not bothering to put another in, I made my way to the front door. 

The door was in between the hallway and the living room. The only source of lighting in the living room was an antique lamp that let off more noise than light. It had lasted through many miles and I prayed tonight wouldn’t be the night it would quit. I stepped out into the cool night air and walked at a brisk pace to the garbage can. I didn’t run in fear of looking stupid. The garbage can faced the street where few streetlights were on. I made my way to the garbage can as dread swelled up in my stomach. I threw it in with force. As I turned around quickly, I managed to glimpse a man on the other side of the street. It was nothing, just a neighbor. I had seen the man before when the U-Haul pulled in, but I still turned around again to face the man. He looked normal in a suit with a loosened tie, but as I met his face, he spoke, but it sounded like a woman.

“Hunny can you take out the garbage, please” I backpedaled and ran as fast as I could but not before seeing the smile on the man’s face.
