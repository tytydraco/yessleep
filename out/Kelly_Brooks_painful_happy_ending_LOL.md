Once upon a time, there was a very evil and sexy femme fatale named Kelly Brook. She was the kind of woman who loved nothing more than causing chaos and destruction wherever she went. She was always looking for her next big thrill, and she was always on the lookout for new ways to get revenge on those who had wronged her.

One day, Kelly decided to treat herself to a lovely hot stone massage at her favorite spa. She had heard that the spa's massage therapist, Tabatha, was the best in the business, and she couldn't wait to see what she could do.

As Tabatha began to work her magic on Kelly's lower back, Kelly could feel the tension and pain melting away. She moaned softly as Tabatha worked her way down her spine, using her skilled hands to relieve the knots and aches that had been plaguing her for so long.

But as the massage progressed, Kelly began to feel something else. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but she knew that something was different. Tabatha was being seductive, almost as if she was trying to seduce Kelly. Kelly couldn't help but feel a tingling sensation in her lower back as Tabatha's hands worked their way down her spine.

"This is amazing," Kelly moaned. "I've never felt this good before. Can you do something to fix this back pain permanently?"

Tabatha smiled wickedly. "I can do that," she said. "But I'll need to use a tool on your back."

Kelly nodded eagerly, and Tabatha began to massage her lower back even more intently. But then, just as Kelly was starting to relax, Tabatha suddenly stabbed her in the lower back with a knife.

Kelly let out a shocked and pained moan - "ahhhhh!!!", as she felt the knife enter her flesh. She couldn't believe what was happening. She had been betrayed by her favorite massage therapist, the one person she had trusted to make her feel good. Tabatha looked proudly over the deceased body of Kelly and had an evil smirk on her face. 

Tabatha laughed as Kelly gasped for breath, her life slipping away. "Looks like you won't have to worry about your back pain anymore," she said, chuckling.

The spa manager named Jenny arrived and couldn't help but make a joke about the situation. "Looks like Kelly got a little too relaxed and got a backstabbed," she said, with a hint of sarcasm.

Tabatha laughed along with her, "Yeah, and now she's dead. I guess you could say her back pain is permanently fixed now."

Jenny walked over to Kelly's corpse, "I'm sure she's not complaining now. She's got a one-way ticket to the afterlife and no lower back pain."

Tabatha and Jenny laughed together as they walked away from Kelly's lifeless body, leaving her there on the massage table, a twisted and dark joke on the way she died. Kelly Brook had finally met her demise, and the only thing left to do was to make fun of her death from a backstab and her back pain, the very thing she had begged to be fixed permanently.

The moral of the story is never to trust anyone, especially when they offer to fix your back pain permanently. They might just stab you in the back (literally) and make jokes about it after your death. The end.
