I don’t usually write, and I’m definitely not the kind of person who signs up for forums out there, but over the past few months, ever since the files leaked, some people have started reaching out to me.

Some say I’m “one of the only ones left” from the Rawley case. Others want interviews. There was even a true crime channel trying to dramatize everything with terrible actors and suspense music on loop, a web series or something like that. I’ll say it upfront: if you’re wondering which series or where to find the info, well, the first video is already off YouTube, they deleted everything two days ago. They say it was due to pressure from the family. Others feed conspiracies about what the government might be hiding.

The series is still in production, but the original writer vanished. Literally. Just disappeared, like, didn’t show up for a team meeting and never replied again. The pilot episode ended up leaking on a private server, but someone made sure to take it down quickly.

There’s not much left. And what’s left is being told by people who shouldn’t be telling it.

That’s why I’m here. To tell what really happened to us. And what happened to Ben Rawley. I thought I’d ignore it, like I did with everything else these past few months. I thought time would be enough to bury that story. But now that they’re telling it the wrong way, I need to record how it actually happened.

And before anyone who saw any of the content asks: yes. The train is real, but it doesn’t start with it.

My whole role in this delicate plot began when I moved back to my hometown. It was kind of a cowardly decision, I admit. I hid behind an acceptable reason: I was hired to restore the murals at St. Luke’s Chapel, down in the rail district. Sacred painting, something I’ve done for years and that many people assume requires some kind of faith.

I don’t know if I have faith.

But I like the silence that hangs between the stone walls, the old paint creaking on the brush, the smell of incense that never seems to leave the floor. I like the illusion of eternity.

And maybe it was because of that, or maybe because, deep down, I knew I’d end up passing close to the tracks, that I accepted.

The neighborhood I grew up in isn’t far from the freight station. In fact, everything in that town revolves around the tracks, even after the railway died. They cut through streets, divide neighborhoods, sink beneath cracked concrete walkways. They’re everywhere. Like old scars no one dares to remove.

The station where everything happened, where Ben disappeared, is still there, though they say it’s deactivated. No one goes there. There haven’t been any trains registered on that line for years. But what everyone knows is that, from time to time, a whistle can still be heard.

I heard it too, on my second night in town. I was painting alone, like I always do, when something echoed low, metallic, like a wagon being dragged by a heavy chain miles beneath the ground. You know that kind of low rumble that makes your chest tremble? Yeah.

The sound was brief, but it left an echo. My hand shook. The paint fell. And in that moment, for the first time in years, something inside me resonated. Something deep, buried since childhood, a reverse nostalgia, an aversion to the past, as if something *in* the past wanted to come back, even though it should’ve stayed there. I couldn’t fall asleep for a long time that night, and when I finally did, it was a restless, unsettled kind of sleep.

The next day, coming back from downtown with some cans of varnish (and an energy drink) and a new fine-tipped brush, I saw the poster on the pole near the hardware store:

“Regional Tournament – Connors Team”

“Connors,” I muttered to myself. “No, it can’t be.”

My small childhood group had five kids. We all lived in the same neighborhood, no more than two streets apart. One of those friends was Jake Connor. A chubby little redhead with freckles and messy hair, always wearing a shirt that showed the bottom of his belly, which earned him the nickname “Jake Piggy.”

Of course he was still around. But as a coach? Well, he didn’t have siblings or any relatives to share that last name with, so it was either that or a new resident totally unrelated to my past and honestly, no one moves to this godforsaken place.

I don’t know what came over me. Maybe just curiosity. Maybe some instinctive need to see something that was still familiar. I went to the game that night. I stayed in the back of the bleachers, near the metal fence, holding a warm Coke and trying to look casual.

Jake saw me in the second half. I don’t know what he did, but his muscles were seriously built, an enviable physique that betrayed years of training and probably a domestication of his once wild appetite. Still, I recognized him: The same friendly eyes of the kid who held out his hand to me when I showed up crying on the first day of school. Even from afar, I noticed he still had that slightly mocking way about him, like the whole world was a soccer practice and he was the only one with a whistle.

After the game, he came right up:

— *Caleb Morgan? THAT YOU?!* — He pulled me into a hug, lifting me off the ground — *Look who decided to rise from the dead!*

I nodded, a bit embarrassed. Then we went to the tech school parking lot to have a beer on the hood of his stylish EcoSport.

— *So you’re painting saints now, is that it?* — he asked.

— *Something like that.* — I said.

— *And why here?*

— *They paid well.*

— *And it’s got nothing to do with Ben, huh?*

Silence.

Ben was also one of our group, along with his now-fiancée, Amy. I kind of liked her back then, and when she and Ben started dating, that was the final straw for me leaving town. I told Jake about it at the time and he was the only one who knew how I felt. He looked off into the distance, like he didn’t want to pressure me.

— *Come on, Jake, you know I don’t hold grudges. That was young stuff. It’s all good now.*

He gave me a puzzled look.

— *So you don’t know?*

— *Don’t know what?*

*— Caleb, Ben’s missing. It’s been months since anyone’s seen him...*

I stood frozen, trying to process it. We hadn’t spoken in a long time, but still... it was Ben. Jake saw my reaction, but went on anyway:

*— Wes says the train started running again. Not officially, of course. His usual crazy stuff, you know? He believes Ben mapped everything before he vanished, that he knew where to catch it. And that he left clues...*

I took a while to answer. My heart already knew what I was going to say before my mouth even decided.

*— Is he still living around here?*

*— Same place as always. Wanna see him?*

I nodded, and Jake smiled with that look of someone who thinks they’re about to show you something amazing. We drove there, he let me pick the music, like the old days, and somehow that gave me a kind of comfort even if uncomfortable. *Tears for Fears*, a classic I loved. A kind of nostalgia with rust along the edges.

The neighborhood where Wes lived looked the same, only more... hollow, I’d say. Not physically, the houses were still there, most with curtains in the windows, peeling fences, crooked antennas. But there was something in the air, as if the neighborhood was trying to hide.

We stopped at a low house with a wide roof, its façade painted a beige that had once been white but had since lost its name. In the front yard, a pile of junk: bikes without wheels, torn cardboard boxes, a “Restricted Area” sign stuck in the weeds. It was the kind of place that makes you think twice before knocking.

But Jake walked right up and knocked three times. Once, twice and on the third, the handle turned.

Wes showed up with the face of someone who hasn’t slept in days. Army t-shirt, sunken eyes, messy hair. When he saw me, he paused for a second. Then smiled a smile that almost hurt his cheeks.

— *I knew it,* he said. *I knew you’d come back.*

— *That’s becoming a catchphrase,* I muttered, and he laughed.

He led us straight to the garage, which had clearly been converted into a conspiracy HQ. Maps, wires, papers scattered around, red markings, post-its with dates, handwritten notes, one of the walls covered in a plastic sheet with fluorescent marker trails connecting names, times, and... tracks.

He opened a kraft paper folder and pulled out a stack of pages.

— *This… this is what’s left of Ben’s stuff. He gave it to Amy, and she gave it to me when she didn’t know what else to do with it. She figured I was the only crazy one who might understand. And she was right.*

— *You really believe in all this?* I asked, but it didn’t come out ironic. It was more like trying to gauge how deep he’d gone.

Wes looked at me, that gleam in his eyes wasn’t just excitement. It was faith. The kind of faith that doesn’t need to convince anyone.

— *He was trying to track the train. Map the times, the sounds. The sequence. Like… like a stop pattern. He was piecing things together, Caleb. And I think he found the boarding point.*

I stayed quiet. Something about the way he said “boarding point” gave me a strange chill. Boarding what? I remembered that last night I’d heard the mechanical whistles of invisible gears. Jake stood leaning against the door, watching without saying much. From what I knew of him, he thought it was all nonsense but deep down, he was waiting for something to happen.

— *Tomorrow,* Wes said, *I want to take you there. It’s not far. But you need to see it with your own eyes. And…* — he paused, almost embarrassed — *maybe hear it too.*

— *Hear what?*

He just smiled. The kind of smile that bothered me more than any direct answer would’ve.

Was I stupid to say yes? For sure. But the next morning, I woke before sunrise. My head was heavy, the kind of heaviness that comes from a night without real sleep, like Wes’s insomnia had rubbed off on me. The sound... it was there again. That deep, buried vibration, like something ancient trying to wake beneath the city. Work passed without anything unusual, and my attempts to talk to the priest about these strange events led nowhere.

By late afternoon, we met at the old station. A rusted structure, partially swallowed by vegetation. Part of the platform had collapsed years ago, and the upper sign no longer had letters, just holes where something like “District A Station” used to be. No one remembered anymore.

Wes was already there, with his backpack, the same one as always, which made me wonder how it was still standing after over a decade, and a folder stuffed with crumpled papers. He was crouched near the tracks, recorder running. When he saw us, he stood.

— *He came here. I’m sure of it. There are footprints. Sometimes fresh. Sometimes just a mark in the dust.*

— *And Amy...* —  I asked. — *Does she know you’re doing this?*

Wes hesitated.

— *She follows me sometimes. But she doesn’t say anything. Since Ben disappeared… she’s changed. She thinks he might still come back.*

— *And you?*

He just looked at me.

Wes was about to answer when we heard footsteps coming from the blind side of the station. The vegetation rustled slightly, and Amy appeared, slowly. For a moment, no one said anything. And even though we were outdoors, surrounded by grass and metal, her presence brought a deathly, sterile silence. She wore a thin coat, far too big for her like time had shrunk someone who once took up more space in the world. Even so, she was as beautiful as I remembered (if not more!), her reddish-brown hair down to her shoulders, dark, piercing eyes staring at us, heavy with dark circles against her pale skin.

She was holding a brown envelope to her chest. With both hands. I didn’t ask how she knew we were there. Maybe she just… knew.

She walked up to us and stopped two steps away. Looked at me, then Jake, then Wes. Her gaze lingered longest on mine.

— *This was his* —  she said, holding out the envelope.

No one moved at first. Then Wes stepped forward and took it carefully.

— *Did you open it?* — he asked.

Amy shook her head.

— *I tried. But... it always felt wrong.*

She looked around.

— *He wanted us to come back here. That I know. I just don’t understand why.*

The envelope was slightly creased, with a soft fold in the upper left corner. There was nothing written on the outside. Wes opened it with trembling hands. Inside, a pile of papers: handwritten notes, small drawings, cut-out newspaper clippings glued together like a puzzle only the person who made it could understand.

I recognized Ben’s handwriting instantly.

That cramped script, with uneven spacing between the words. As a kid, he used to write like he was afraid of wasting paper. One page stood out to me. It had only a single word in the upper corner:

**“Pairs?”**

Next to it, a simple diagram: the inside of a train car, with seats drawn in rows and a red X over one of them.

Jake scoffed, running his hand over his face.

— *This looks like some ritual crap, man. Like… sick stuff.*

Wes stared at the pages like he was trying to remember something.

Amy stepped back.

— *I don’t know if I want to keep going with this. I shouldn’t have come.*

She turned to leave, but hesitated. Looked at me one last time, her eyes more alive than I remembered but also more distant. Like she was looking through me.

— *Caleb… if he really is out there, for whatever reason, just… bring him back. Please.*

And then she left.

The sky was already starting to darken, and the golden light of late afternoon gave the station a stage-like look, like someone had built the whole place just for that moment.

Jake crossed his arms.

— *This is giving me a bad feeling, man.*

He turned to me.

— *Are you seriously thinking about following through with this?*

— *I don’t know* —  I replied —  *But I know that if I leave now, I won’t sleep tonight. Maybe not the next either.*

Wes grinned, nudging Jake with his elbow.

— *Told you he’d be in. Boarding point shows up at midnight, sir* — and gave me an ironic bow.

— *You’ve seen it?* I asked.

He hesitated. Looked away.

— *I heard it. And I saw a light, once. Something… running along the tracks. But too fast to make out.*

A silence.

— *And there was something else.*

— *What?*

He looked back up, staring into my eyes, more serious than ever.

— *I think I saw someone inside one of the cars. Standing still. Staring at me.*

It was already night when I got back to the chapel. The air was dense, stifling, even a bit warm for that time of year. I locked the door, dropped my things on the floor, and sat for a few minutes on the dusty altar, trying to gather my thoughts. But they wouldn’t gather. They just spun around a single point: the note on the paper.

**“Pairs?”**

Pairs of what? An instruction? A password?

I turned off the light in the main hall and walked down the side corridor toward the small back room where I was sleeping during the project. The window looked out onto the side street, where the old stretch of track began, the one that ran through the town. I looked through the curtains. Not a soul in sight.

But as I turned to close the door, I saw something reflected in the glass.

Small. Low. Standing still in the middle of the street.

I froze in fright. Turned slowly, but there was no one there. Opened the door and stepped out. Took two steps. Nothing. Just the sound of wind passing through cracks in the concrete.

But the smell… A strange smell. Bitter. Something between sulfur and wet iron.

I went back inside. Locked up. Stood still for a few seconds, listening.

Nothing.

And when I turned again to go up the narrow staircase, I saw a handprint. On the inside of the glass door.

Too low and small to be from an adult. Too warm to be old.

I left just before midnight. Put on a light jacket, switched my phone to airplane mode (don’t ask me why, I just did), and walked to the station. It was close, no more than twenty minutes on foot, and I needed to feel the city again, its sounds, its smells, its shadows. I couldn’t face this thing from inside a car with the radio on.

Ironically enough, the streets were empty. Unnaturally quiet. Even the backyard dogs seemed to know better than to bark that night. When I got there, Wes was already waiting. Sitting in the middle of the broken platform, staring at nothing like he was watching time go by. If I didn’t know him, I’d say he was high. We just nodded at each other and stayed there in silence. Jake showed up a few minutes later, muttering that he’d lost sleep over “some goddamn ghost train,” but brought a Gatorade and tossed me half a bag of Doritos.

—  *Alright, ghost-hunting Sherlocks*, — he said, yawning. —  *What time does the clown show start?*

— *Midnight, obviously* — Wes replied.

The whole city felt suspended. No wind, no insects, no sound coming from anywhere. Just the three of us, lit by a flashlight Wes had strapped to a makeshift tripod made out of broken chair legs.

Midnight came.

Nothing.

Wes started pacing. Back and forth, like something was off with the world's clock. Jake, naturally, started mocking. Even I began to doubt. For a moment, it was just this: three grown men in a forgotten place, haunted by ghosts of the past.

And then, it happened.

No warning. No rumble. The train just appeared. Not arriving from afar, not emerging from the horizon: it was simply *there*.

A long, black train with darkened windows, metal stained by time, just... existing less than five meters from us. I felt the gust of air hit me like a punch to the chest. The sound was deafening, like a living machine groaning, and the headlight if it even *was* a light, looked more like a white hole, leaking pressure.

I was so terrified I forgot one crucial thing: **I was on the tracks.**

I had stepped down earlier to snap a few “aesthetic” shots for inspiration, figuring midnight had already passed and I didn’t want the night to be a waste. Even if the train did show up, I thought I’d have enough time and space to run. But suddenly the train was barreling right at me. A steel monster, absurd, aimless, just raw magnitude and a scream that seemed to come from *inside* my head.

Jake saved me.

He grabbed my collar and yanked me back onto the platform with a strength I’d never seen in him. I hit the ground, elbow throbbing and heart trying to leap from my throat.

The train thundered past us, car after car, with no end in sight. It wasn’t just dragging metal, it was warping time itself. The windows… my God. Some were fogged up. Others were covered in something dark. And one of them just a few feet from me, revealed a figure.

Still. Seated. Staring right at me.

I couldn’t make out many details of the face. Just the eyes. Big, black, like wet coal. And the mouth… slightly open, like it was about to speak. Wes was recording. I saw it. He was shaking (we all were), but he held the recorder steady, pointed at the tracks, like it was the only thing keeping it real.

When the last car passed, there was no sound of brakes, no fading distance.  
The train was just… gone.

— *You saw that, right?* — Jake shouted, dripping sweat. —  *You fucking saw that?*

Wes stared at the recorder. Hit stop. Took two steps back and sat down.

I couldn’t speak. The sound still echoed not in my ears, but in my chest.

Wes stood, pulled out one of the papers from the envelope. The map. The red mark pointed exactly to where the train had appeared.

— *He found it*  —  Wes murmured. —  *Ben found the point!*

Jake threw his Gatorade at the metal wall.

— *So what now? We get in? Take a one-way trip to hell?*

— *No one’s getting in yet,* — I said. My voice came out hoarse. —  *We need to think.*

— *Oh, so you’re in charge of this field trip now?*

— *If that’s how it is, let me just say I’ve been on this ride way longer* — Wes added, raising a hand.

— *No, I just don’t think it’s smart to jump on ghost trains, that’s all. Think about Ben…*

The conversation faded eventually, even though all of us were buzzing from the experience. We said our goodbyes shortly before 1 a.m. and I headed home. I walked in a daze, distracted, for about 15 minutes. I was nearing the church when... I felt it.

Something behind me. I turned slowly, praying to see nothing.

But I saw.

A child. Standing in the street. Again. Wearing a train conductor’s outfit, hat crooked. Closer this time, maybe 10 meters away. He took one step.

Then another.

His face...

Something was wrong. Like it had been assembled. Drawn, cut from magazines, pasted together.  
Eyes too deep. Mouth too wide. And the smell now unbearable, burnt sulfur and basement mold.

I ran.

Didn’t even think. Just ran. The sound of his steps didn’t come from the ground, they came from **inside my head**, like he was riding on my shoulders, whispering:

“***All aboard! All aboard!***”

I turned the corner, reached the church street, almost tripped on the curb, dropped my keys and nearly vomited from fear. I could feel the heat radiating from behind me. I snatched the keys off the ground, shaking, and by some miracle (or maybe just the monster’s twisted sense of sport), I made it to safety. When I finally slammed the door shut, my eyes filled with tears.

She was out there. And it wasn’t a delusion. It wasn’t urban legend.

I approached the small glass window.  
The child stood in the street, staring. Not blinking. Not moving.  
Its smile glowed with a fiery hue, and as if that wasn’t enough to unhinge me, it spoke, in a deep, doubled voice:

— ***At the next station, Caleb***...

At the next station...

It vanished with a pop of air and a stench of spoiled meat and hot iron.

And I just stood there, back against the wall, trembling.  
My heart pounding in a steady rhythm — "*chuff chuff"* — like a train on the tracks...
