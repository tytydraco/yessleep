I found the job on Craigslist. **“Night Shift Security – Minimal Work, Easy Pay.”** $25 an hour just to sit in a room and monitor security cameras. The ad mentioned it was for an **old research facility**, now abandoned except for occasional maintenance visits.

The listing seemed almost **too good to be true**. But I needed the money.

I applied, got a one-minute phone interview (they barely asked anything), and was hired on the spot. The only instructions were simple:

* **Watch the cameras**
* **Log any unusual activity**
* **Do NOT leave the security room between midnight and 6 AM**

That last part seemed odd. But hey, I wasn’t planning on wandering around anyway.



# Night One: The Silence

I arrived at 11:45 PM. The facility was huge—six floors, long empty hallways, and labs filled with dust-covered equipment. My security room was a **tiny, windowless space** lined with monitors, showing grainy black-and-white footage of the building.

Nothing happened. No movement, no weird noises—just a few flickering lights. The silence was thick, pressing. But I convinced myself it was just an **easy paycheck**.

I left at 6 AM, feeling relieved.



# Night Two: The Static

1:42 AM.

One of the monitors flickered—**Camera 6**. It watched a hallway on the third floor, just outside **Lab B7**.

The screen cut to static. Just for a second. When it came back, **the hallway looked… different**. The shadows seemed darker, stretched in ways that didn’t make sense. Like the lights had shifted—**but they hadn’t**. I stared at the screen, heart pounding. Then, just as suddenly, everything went back to normal. 

I wrote it off as a **faulty camera** and made a note in my log. But when I checked the previous security logs, I noticed something strange. Every night, for **the past three weeks**, someone had logged a **Camera 6 malfunction** at exactly the same time: **1:42 AM**.



# Night Three: The Figure

At 3:13 AM, I noticed it.

**A figure.**

Tall. **Too tall.** It stood at the very edge of the frame on **Camera 6**, right outside Lab B7. Its limbs were long, spindly, **wrong**. I leaned closer to the screen. The figure wasn’t moving. But its head was **tilted sharply**, almost **unnaturally far to the side**. Like a broken mannequin. It was **watching the camera**.

I grabbed my radio. “Uh, control? Do we have someone in the building?” Silence. Just static.

I looked back at the monitor. **It was gone.** I rewound the footage, my hands shaking. But when I played it back—**there was nothing there**. The hallway was empty. I stared at the screen for the rest of the night, barely breathing. Nothing else happened. But I left at 6 AM with an uneasy feeling in my chest.



# Night Four: The Smile

I almost didn’t come back. But I needed the money. The first few hours were quiet. But then—**3:13 AM. Camera 6.** It was back. Only this time, it was **closer**. It stood **directly beneath the camera**, its head still tilted, but now… it was **grinning**. Its mouth was **too wide**, stretching far beyond where human lips should end. And even though the footage was grainy, I could see—**its teeth were sharp**. I felt something shift in the room. **Like the air changed.** And then, on the monitor—**it moved**.

**It turned its head.**

Not toward the camera. **Toward me.** I swear to God, in that moment, I felt something **breathing behind me**. I spun around, but the room was empty. My heart was hammering in my chest. I turned back to the monitor—**the figure was gone**. I lasted the rest of the shift, somehow. But I was shaking when I left.



# Night Five: The Knock

I wasn’t going to go back. But my boss called. **“We need you tonight. Last minute. You’ll get a bonus.”** So, like an idiot, I said yes. The shift started like normal. Cameras were clear. I tried to ignore the pounding in my chest every time I glanced at **Camera 6**.

But then— At **3:13 AM**, something **knocked on the security room door**.

**Three slow, heavy knocks.**

I nearly jumped out of my chair. My first thought was a maintenance worker—but no one else was **supposed** to be in the building. The monitors showed **nothing outside the door**. I grabbed my radio. “Who’s there?”

Static.

The knocks came again. **Louder this time.** I checked the monitors again. And then I saw it. On **Camera 6**, the figure was back. But now— **It was inside the building.**

Standing in the hallway, closer to the security room. And then, as I watched, it took a step forward. Then another. I reached for the door handle, ready to **bolt**, but— The **power cut out**. Every monitor **went black**. For a full **ten seconds**, the room was silent. Then, just as suddenly, the power flickered back on. The screens rebooted. The monitors showed the empty hallways again. The **figure was gone**. I didn’t wait. I grabbed my stuff, ran out of the building, and drove home. I called my boss the next morning and **quit on the spot**.

# The Job Listing Is Still Up.

Today, I went back to check the Craigslist listing. And I noticed something I hadn’t seen before. At the bottom of the post, in small, faded text, it said:

**“Position Open Until Filled. Previous Employee Missing.”**

I don’t know what they were researching in that building. I don’t know what that **thing** is. But I know one thing for sure—

**I was never supposed to leave.**
