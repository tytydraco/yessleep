I was 24 at the time. And it was a simple, well paying job. At least before our great comrade died.  My job was easy, I was told to sit in a tower during the farming season and radio in any sightings of the monster.  It was not strong. It was not fast. But it was resilient, enduring. Much more than we ever were. When the only thing surrounding you is a hundred kilometer radius of fields of wheat and corn and sunflower. Those muddy rows tire you out and it takes advantage of that. So this was the simplest solution. I tell them when its near, they sit inside their tractors until it leaves. Even the village children could wrestle it down if they wanted to. 

  
I share a portion of my work logs, or diary with you today as something has been eating at me for a while now. I hope that this may ease the biting. 

  


15th October 1991. 



\-Spotted around 14h in the southern fields. Villagers stayed in their tractors until it left roughly 5 minutes later. No note. 



20th October 1991.



\-Spotted around 19h in the southern fields. Slept in the plowed rows until villagers began working. It left towards the northern fields and slept there until night. No note. 



21st October 1991. 



\-Spotted outside my window around 4h. Left upon me banging my crutch against the floor. No shots fired. 



12th November 1991. 



\-Spotted in the eastern fields around 7h. Ivan D. did not have his radio turned on. Left pinky finger bitten off. First aid administered. 



23rd January 1992. 



\-Spotted at the base of my tower around 15h. Twitching at the distant explosions. Stayed until night. No note.



24th January 1992. 



Nobody is going to read this. A commissar and two soldiers came to my tower to drag me into the war. They barely looked at me and told me I didn't need to fight.

They gave me food and water for the next week and an extra thirty rounds of amuntion for my rifle. Told me to shoot at anyone coming from the hill. 



2nd February 1992. 



A soldier had marched from the hill. One of ours. He was filthy and tired and rude. Threatened me with an empty rifle to give him food. I gave him some dried sausage and a bottle of water. Demanded my ammo as well, I threatened him back with my own rifle and shot a single round through the floor as a warning. He left and didn't return.





3rd February 1992.



The wind made a whistling noise through the bullet hole last night. Nailed a coaster over it. The monster was looking up at me while I did so. Weird eyes. 



19th February 1992. 



Soldiers saluted and waved at me from their army trucks as they went west. I waved back and they tossed something onto the road. It was a pack of cigarettes and a lighter with a piece of paper attached to it with a rubber band. "For the Fatherland, fight!". I enjoyed the cigarettes on the tower stairs. Tossed one to the monster which proceeded to eat it and spit out the filter. 



28th February 1992.



I've named it Maya. The able men are fighting and the other villagers are all hiding in their homes or left to go east or north. Something to keep mе company at lest. Might go take a look at it tomorrow. 



29th February 1992. 



It tried to bite my fingers. It's not that fast or strong. Even I managed to put it in a headlock. Or her. I'm not sure I want to humanize this thing. It's skin is like that of a human, but in a strange scale pattern. Like someone pressed a heated metal fence against it's body and left that texture. It has hair, just not like us. The 'hair' is made of skin too, long thin strands with each having a flattened water-drop shape on the end. Warm to the touch. The water-drop shapes expand slightly and shrink with it's breathing. It was yellow-green in the summer. Now its brown-black. 



7th March 1992.



I saw another army truck coming from the hill, one of ours again. My radio managed to pick up their signal and I said hello. They told me fuck off and called my Mother a whore. They stopped in the village and went to Pavle J's house. 



19th March 1992.



Anya D. Daughter of Ivan D. came to my tower today. She thanked me for bandaging her fathers finger and gave me a bottle of plum brandy and a tin of coffee. She spent an hour with me and I escorted her back to the village. Maya was circling us but I chased it away by waving my crutch at it. I suppose one of them finally figured out I'm still here. 



13th April 1992. 



I woke up early in the morning to gunfire and stepped out onto the balcony to look out towards the hill. I saw another soldier stumbling across the western field. He was bleeding.

Maya was circling him as he attempted to reload his rifle. He fired another burst towards Maya before falling onto the ground. He stopped moving and Maya came closer and wrapped its jaw around his neck, slowly closing it. I only saw a quick spasm before his body went limp. When day came I went out to see who it was. Maya had eaten a good piece of his left shoulder and seemed to have bitten off his left ear and dragged it somewhere else. It was one of theirs. 

Told the villagers and they buried him the evening. His name was Hamza. 





28th April 1992.



The gunfire is getting closer every day. I think I might need to leave soon. I already saw most of the villagers leave and go east. But I don't think there will be a safe plot of land soon. 

I know Petar N. is still in the village. I see him chop fire wood and split it into tiny kindling. He tends to cook his meals outside in his yard. Those old hands are getting slower. 



5th May 1992. 



The last week has been eventful. The enemy had advanced into our lands, not many of them but at least twenty. They stormed the village but found no one of note. They left Petar N. alone. I didn't show my face the entire week. Ate as little as I could and only watched them between the boards. One of them wanted to come into my tower as well.

I thank God that he changed his mind. They left around 17h today. They've burned down some of the houses. 



6th May 1992.



I carried my rifle today and went into the village to see if anyone was hurt. The Petrovic family was dead. Me and Petar N. spent the day burying them. We drank an entire bottle of plum brandy. The good stuff from his attic. Jovan P. is still on the lines. My condolences to him. 



7th May 1992.



I see it in the fields again. It is the first time I have seen it confused. Or what I think it's expression of confusion is. It's skin is once again a mix of gold and green sprinkled with a dry sandy beige. It tries gnawing on the wheat as it passes by the rows only to spit it out. I see it look out towards the hill. It hears something I don't. I am afraid they will become desperate and I will be there as well.
