As a kid, I loved and always believed in the tooth fairy, I mean, who doesn't like free cash anyways? Since I was about 8yo I always was mindful of tooth fairy coming at night and always checked constantly if she took my tooth. 

With years passing, my schoolmates kept making fun of me for still believing the existence of the tooth fairy but I never actually listened to them. At school I was the smartest kid with the best grades and because of society, I was considered a nerd and no one is willing to become friends with a nerd...

That didn't bother me much, all i kept thinking about is my teeth gradually falling because that would make me gain some money. However, there's one particular thing that is still... I don't know what is the most-matching word... Unknown? Clear? Well you get the point.

What I mean is, usually my teeths usually fall off when I normally have dinner but the fact is, after it does fall off, as everyone would do, I instantly sprint to my bedroom to put it under my pillow and wait for the tooth fairy to come exchange it but growing up I was curious about how she looked and one night, decided to place cameras.

As everytime I wait for her to come and exchange it while I'm talking with family in the kitchen (I was sure none of my family was faking to be the tooth fairy because it's impossible that they instantly went to my bedroom and exchanged my tooth even though they were in the kitchen the whole time). I come back into my bedroom and check under the pillow, yeah my tooth is gone and there's cash... But!!! I caught the tooth fairy on tape!

I decide to take my hidden camera and check the recordings. Nothing happened for a few minutes, until I actually saw something move. It's her, I'm sure!!!

The glance on my eyes suddenly fades... The file for some reason corrupted right when I was about see what she looked like, however... I was kinda able to see what she looked like but she looks nothing like described normally though??? I saw like just 3-4 frames of the video and here what she looked like:

She looked absolutely nothing like a fairy, she looked made out of wood, she looked like a total tree, had a rather wood-ish texture. I'm quite perplexed because why would something described tiny and generous look like absolute monster.

Shocked from what happened I go back to bed and fall asleep. A few months pass by and another tooth falls out. As everytime I put it under my pillow. I went to sleep, fell asleep. The night passes, I'm awake. I wake up and immediately check under my pillow. What the heck?!?!? There's no cash, I grab my tooth, rotate it and actually saw something quite astonishing... My tooth had something written on. It definitely was "her" who wrote it.

It was something in capital letters, I can't remember what it really said, I was 9 at the time and now I'm close to graduating school but I remember it was something like "DON'T.TRY.AGAIN" written in a dark red colour. After this one tooth, my teeth never fell out again... I'm still quite confused of what happened...
