Prologue.

A burst of cheers filled the air. Spectators were participating in an event at the French Quarter, watching floats, marching bands, and entertainers on the parade. Mardi Gras has arrived, and everyone is joining in to watch. partying and dancing to the lively music, drinking and laughing, as residents from the balconies are throwing beads and flowers. 
Two hooded men walk into an apartment in downtown New Orleans. Carrying backpacks over their shoulders, they entered the main lobby, as no employee or security was inside, either taking part in the festivities or taking a lunch break. They took the stairs. 
 
taking advantage of the celebration that everyone was engaged in. They walked into the hallway and heard commotion from each unit. There, they found what they were looking for. a suite where they got information from one of their contacts a few nights ago that belonged to a creole woman that has antique relics and riches from the Caribbean, and if they were to steal one of them and sell it to any high bidder,
 
"Are you ready?"
 
"Yeah, let me just take out my tools."
 
"Alright, but make it quick." "We don't want to get any attention."
 
"I know, I know." "Let me do my shit."
 
One man stood guard while the other used a wipe to scrub the door lock, used his hook and pick to place it within the knob lock, and within seconds, unlocked it. There, they broke into the suite and saw that what the contact said was true. In the living room, they discovered three opened wooden boxes with artifacts and relics. As they rummage through it, they discover that it looks like gold jewelry and golden idols. They looked at each other in disbelief. Their eyes widened, and their arms were weak with shock. They could not believe what they were seeing. It was too good to be true. 
 
"Holy shit!  "Yer seein' what I'm seeing."
 
"Yeah, but we don't have time." "Let's grab what we can 'n' amscray outta here." 
 
"But look at this." This…is…fuckin' gold.  "Real fuckin' gold, mah man."
 
"Yes, yes, I know." Now hurry and put the fuckin' gold in your backpack. "We can talk about it once we get away."
 
The burglar was captivated by the sight of gold. as he has never seen such a thing in his life. a once-in-a-lifetime experience that he now holds in his hands. 
 
"Dude!  What the fuck are you doing? Put the goddamn thing in the backpack. "Jesus fuckin' Christ."
 
"B-But, but, but..."
 
"Wat da fuck is wrong with..."
 
His eyes dilated, and blood began to shed from them. The burglar was pale, yet firmly holding the golden relic. mumbling to himself as if he were speaking a different language. His partner watched in utter surprise. He grabbed him by the collar and shook him.
 
"Dammit man, what's going on with you?" "Snap the fuck out of it."
 
The man paid no attention, still gazing at the relic. when he suddenly spewed blood from his mouth. There, his partner slapped him in the face with his right hand, trying to wake him up from his bewitchment. Sitting in the shadows was a beautiful Creole woman wearing her dress, which is both elegant and casual, and a blazer over it. Her hands, covered in cashmere-lined gloves, are placed on her lap as the woman watches the situation unfold. She grinned in silence as she gazed upon the two men. Whispering her incantations, she raised her right hand, and with the snap of her fingers, the burglar abruptly dropped the golden relic and started to scream in agony. With both hands on his face, he turned around as he fell to the ground. His partner slowly backed away with each step. Watching the terror before him unfold.  Not wanting to stay any longer, he hurriedly ran out of the suite. The burglar scratched his face, as the pain was too much for him. His eyes bulged out, and his face bloated with the crack of his skull. until he no longer screamed as he was now gurgling blood and saliva. 
 
His eyes finally popped out of their sockets, and his whole body was shaking wildly on the floor. The flesh on his head tore itself apart. The woman stood up and walked towards the man in agony. Seeing that his head is swollen and knowing his skull is cracked She chanted as she made preparations. She placed a bowl with a strange powder beside the man. With a grimoire in hand, she began chanting her spells. With an unsettling grin, she laid the book down before her and grabbed a dagger from the stand. There she sliced the flesh off the burglar's head. already shattered by the woman's black magic and by him falling to the floor pretty hard. Blood spilled onto the floor as she removed his brain. Blood and matter dripped profusely as nerves, veins, and arteries covered the man's brain as the stem and spinal cord hung from underneath it.
 
She placed the brain in the bowl with the powder. She spread the powder over the twitching organ as if she were preparing a turkey for Thanksgiving. Four men in suits soon entered the suite. With stone faces, the woman gazed at them with little annoyance.
 
"You can now take those boxes and be careful with them." "They are for the ceremony."
 
"Yes ma'am"
 
"Handle them with care and do not lose them." "If one of you does, then one of you will surely be part of the ceremony."
 
 
as she proceeded to focus on the organ. The men did as they were asked. Each carrying the boxes, one by one, walked out. She then sealed the bowl, washed her hands, and left the premises of her residency. Upon leaving, a large-breasted blonde woman, half drunk, stumbles as she walks. There, the blonde clenches her chest, feeling the pain that is ensuing. as her heart was pounding hard against the ribs and beating unsteadily. He saw the beautiful Creole woman. Her heart was beating with rage as jealousy took over her after seeing such a gorgeous person. 
 
"Hey!  You think you're beautiful. Well, you're not. You…you…stupid bitch."
 
The creole woman ignored the blonde woman who continued on spouting hateful remarks; she always knew this blonde woman as she was her neighbor. Sometimes seeing the blonde's racism But as for the Creole woman, she has something in store for her in the coming months. 
 
walking towards her luxury Rolls-Royce with a black Dodge SUV from behind. Her chauffeur stood by the door and opened it for her. She got inside and drank the wine glass that was already prepared for her. The chauffeur got into the driver's seat and drove off, with the SUV following from behind. about the care of the world, as the people from the outside continued on with their celebration. 

On the following day, a detective watches the corpse of the dead burglar. smoking his cigarette and with his hand inside his right pocket. With wary eyes, he glanced at the yawning hole in the man's head. He then looked around on the floor, seeing anything he could find. Then he gazed up, scanning the living room like a sentinel. slowly puffing his cigarette. The scene was hectic, with officers coming to and fro from the suite. as forensics took evidence. And when paramedics arrived, they placed the corpse in the body bag and sealed it up. 
 
But as for the detective, He just stood there like a Roman statue. with everybody no longer present. He finally took his step. The aura of his smoke filled the air. Step by step, he watched, looking to his left and then to his right. At first, he didn't see anything out of the ordinary. but he discovered an error. Unbeknownst to his colleagues, he had discovered an ivory chest with paper sticking out of it. something so trivial yet so important to the eyes of the investigator that his own colleagues completely failed.
 
"Well, looky here." That's one nice-looking ivory chest. "Now show papa whatcha got inside."
 
Upon opening the ivory chest, he discovered stacks of paper. paper made from papyrus. Already intrigued, he put on his gloves and examined these interesting papers. Upon reading it, the first one was that of a list. Then the others, well, indicate a ceremonial ritual taking place. 
 
"My my.  "Now that is interesting."
 
placing the papers in his pockets. The man made a final observation and left the suite. for the following days and soon weeks, as he continues on his investigations. He and his partner Jean have been collecting all of the evidence and watching reports of people missing. He had to get to the bottom of it and find out who is causing this and why. and a few months passed by. And soon he'll come to face an unspeakable horror that will be presented to him. a horror that he wished he hadn't investigated.
