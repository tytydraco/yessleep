It’s been weeks. Or maybe just days. I’ve lost the ability to tell. I’ve been trapped in my house, unable to leave. Every window is covered, every reflective surface shattered. The man, the one who looks like my wife, who looks like me, haunts me even now. I can’t see his face without feeling my chest tighten, my breath catch, my entire body seize in panic.

He’s gone, but he’s everywhere. I told him to leave, to go far, far away, but the weight of him remains. I smashed the mirrors to escape that cursed reflection, but I still feel it, the wrongness in my face. My hands tremble as they touch the angles of my cheeks, the shape of my jaw, all unfamiliar now. Every brush of my fingers sends a jolt of nausea through me.

Today, I couldn’t take it anymore.

I stepped outside for the first time since it happened. The sunlight hit me like a physical force, blinding and harsh. My legs wobbled beneath me, but I kept moving, squinting as the light burned into my vision. A breeze swept past, cool and indifferent. I barely felt it.

I reached my car, each step a monumental effort. My hands fumbled with the keys as though they belonged to someone else. When the engine roared to life, it was the first sound that didn’t terrify me in days. I gripped the wheel, took a deep breath, and pulled out of the driveway.

Anywhere but here.

I didn’t care where I ended up, as long as it wasn’t this cursed place. The road stretched ahead, empty and endless, and I drove like my life depended on it. I didn’t dare look at the other drivers, afraid of what I might see. What if they all had his face? What if they all had mine?

The highway felt like salvation. Each mile that passed should have been a step closer to freedom, but the knot in my chest didn’t loosen. I felt like ripping my face off, right then and there. My hands shook on the wheel, and my breath came in shallow, uneven gasps. The gas light finally blinked on, snapping me back to reality.

I took the next exit, hoping for a new town, a new beginning. My heart sank as I saw the sign.

It was my hometown.

No.

This couldn’t be. I had driven for hours, taken every turn I could to escape, but here it was. The café came into view, and my stomach churned violently. No matter how I turned, how I tried to reroute, the café was always there, waiting.

I had no choice.

My legs felt like they weighed a thousand pounds as I climbed out of the car. My body trembled with every step toward the door. The closer I got, the more suffocating the air became. My vision blurred, and my ears rang. My hand reached for the handle, and I almost pulled away, but something inside me pushed forward.

The bell above the door chimed as I stepped inside.

He was there. The waiter. Myself. Everyone else.

“Good morning, Mr. Mill. The usual?” he asked, his voice unnervingly cheerful.

I froze, my mind blank. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat a hammer against my ribs. The waiter disappeared for a moment and returned with a coffee cup. I couldn’t look away from it.

Inside the cup was a heart.

“Your favorite,” he said, smiling that too-familiar smile. “I put extra effort into this one.”

I felt my knees buckle as the room spun around me. My breath caught in my throat, and I gripped the nearest table to steady myself. “WHY? WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? AM I DREAMING?” I screamed, my voice cracking with desperation.

“Don’t you remember?” the waiter said, his tone almost pitying. “You prayed to me that lonely day in the hospital. On your wife’s deathbed.”

His words hit me like a physical blow. My mind raced, fragments of memory clawing their way to the surface.

“I remember,” I whispered, my voice trembling. “I remember everything.”

“That’s my heart, Mr. Mill,” he said, his smile widening. “You prayed, and I answered. You said you loved her so much that her heart belonged to you. So now, here I am. I belong to you, don’t I?”

“No,” I choked out, tears streaming down my face.

“Oh well,” he said with a shrug, picking up the cup. “If you don’t want it, I can take it back. But remember, no refunds.”

“NO! PLEASE DON’T!” I screamed, lunging toward him. “SHE’LL DIE!”

His grin twisted into something darker, something hungry. “I can however, swap your order for something of the same cost. I heard you wanted to try ripping your face off. Let’s see how that feels.”

Before I could react, his hand shot out, cold and unyielding. His fingers sank into my skin, tearing through flesh like paper. I felt the ripping, the burning agony as he started at my ear and dragged toward the center of my face.

I screamed.

I begged.

I pleaded....

I entered the building, took the elevator and landed on the second floor.

The hum of the office surrounded me, the sounds of keyboards and quiet chatter filling the air. Tim or whatever used to be Tim was talking nearby, his voice as grating as ever. I didn’t look at him. I didn’t look at anyone.

My hands reached for the photo of my wife on my desk. She was smiling, her hair catching the sunlight just right, the way it always did.

But in the reflection of the frame, I saw it.

My face...
