I honestly don't even know how to start telling this story. It just seems so unbelievable and something that was created by my fucked up brain, but after seeing other stories on this subredit, I convinced myself that I needed to share this. Just a heads-up, I'm not a native english speaker, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes.

It happened yesterday night. Me and some friends decided to go to a pub and deink until we forget our names. I was reluctant to go at first, since I wasn't in a good place mentally and emotionally, but after some convincing from my friends, I accepted. 

For context, I had broken up with my girlfriend and it was awful. We were dating for four years and completely smitten with eachother. We made so many plans for our future, our wedding, our babies' names... I know this may sound a bit like I'm overreacting, since a break up is not the end of the world, but she helped *a lot*. I always suffered from low self-esteem and had some problems with drugs and she was basically my saving angel at that dark time of my life, so it felt like losing the only thing keeping me sane. 

At the bar, I wasn't able to drink anything. I tried, but the smell of the alcohol made me tear up and I almost puked. My friends then offered me a bit of weed and again, I reluctantly agreed to smoke a bit. I'm a pretty chill guy, I don't like to argue and I almost always just follow whatever others say in order to not get my ass into trouble. After that, my friends went home completely drunk. I was extremely worried for them, but the drugs, the sadness and my lack of sleep started to kick in and I hardly reacted when they got into my friend's car and went off. I checked my phone's watch and saw it was almost midnight, so I decided to go home and try to get some sleep.

For the first minutes everything was normal, I was a bit sleepy, so things seemed slightly blurred. It didn't cause any troubles, so I just kept driving. Entering the city's center road my eyes started to burn, things became even more hazy and black dots formed on my vision. I tried to shake it off, but when I opened my eyes, I immediately saw a big image of my girlfriend. It was a add for a brand being displayed on a big shopping and I almost felt like audibly groaning. In a childish act, I did a U turn and started driving back. I knew there was a new road at that direction and decided to risk it. I did not need to look at my girlfriend's image right now.

The "shortcut" I decided to take was desert, no cars and almost no lights. It was mostly trees and leaves on borh sides. It felt slightly off, but I just kept driving. As I passed the tenth broken pole, I started to feel weird. It was like I was walking in circles, never making progress. My first instinct was to blame it my sleep deprivation, but I soon felt a chill running down my spine. I felt the blood drain from my face and a buzzing static noise pierced my eardrums. It felt weird, too weird. You know that feeling you gt when you're expecting something to happen, but it never comes? That tension is what I felt. 

My foot stomped hard on the pedal and I heard the static sound getting louder. I kept staring straight forward, afraid of looking back, I *didn't* want to look back, I felt as if something was behind me, trying to chase after my car. My vision became even blurrier and I could feel tears build up in my eyes. At this point I couldn't see anything ahead on the road, my vision was almost black and I could faintly see the outline of faces. Some looked like my friends, others like my ex-girlfriend... and others were unrecognizable, they looked demonic and felt like I shouldn't be looking at them. After what felt like hours in this limbo-like state, I saw a shiny bright ahead of me, it was a truck's lights. I figured it meant I was out of that awful "place". 

When I finally got home, I slept so much, it almost looked like I was dead. It was a good night's sleep, but that exlerience still makes me nervous and confused. I try ro convince myself it was my mind playing tricks on me + the weed, but honestly? I'm not sure... the only thing I know, is that I'll never take that short-cut, ever again.
