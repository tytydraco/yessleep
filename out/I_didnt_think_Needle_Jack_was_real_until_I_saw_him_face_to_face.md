No one knows who Needle Jack is or where he comes from. But every time someone goes to our local clinic to get their blood drawn, he’s there.

He’s always humming his strange tune and asking people how they feel about syringes.

“How many times have you drawn this year?” He asked one patient.

“Want to pull more blood?” He questioned another.

It’s so odd.

The nurses call him *Needle Jack* because that’s all he seems to care about.

The staff have tried to get rid of him. Many have asked the police to escort him off grounds. But no matter how many times he’s arrested, he comes back, as cheerful as ever.

At first, I thought this was all a made-up legend, something to scare people off who were afraid to get their blood drawn. But when I went to the clinic to do my own work, I ran into him.

***

As soon as I entered the building, the staff seemed amped up, like they were at the end of their nerves. 

“I don’t think we have any space today,” the receptionist said, tapping keys on her computer.

I glanced out the window, exhausted, then pivoted back to the clock. My husband, Greg, was at home watching our newborn, Chloe. Today was the only day I could make an appointment. I begged her to let me in.

“I’ll see what I can do.” She recorded my information. “Please have a seat. If there’s an opening, a nurse will call you.”

I transferred my belongings to a chair and waited. I found it frightening that everyone seemed so on edge. The janitor mopping the floor kept his eyes on the doors and windows at all times. An older patient next to me peered over her shoulder as if expecting someone to harass her. 

Now I understand why everyone appeared so disturbed. They were waiting for Needle Jack to arrive.

And arrive he did.

***

After about five minutes, a nurse came out and called my name: “Sara?”

I stood and followed her into the back. I settled into a chair and extended my arm to allow easy access to a vein.

As soon as she inserted the point, a loud humming grew from the hall.

“What is that?”

“Oh, that’s just Jack. He’s a patient at this location. Do your best to ignore him.”

I darted my eyes away from the noise. But his grating voice filled my ears.

“Can you ask him to pipe down?”  

“Of course…” She glanced toward the hall, her voice shaking. “Jack, will you please be quiet? You’re disturbing a patient.” 

“Yes… oh yes… I’m sorry…”

For the next thirty seconds, the only sound came from the nurse as she switched out the vials on my syringe.

One click. Then another.

“All done.” She taped gauze onto my arm. “Feel free to sit for a few moments. You might feel dizzy.”

I glanced at my phone. It was almost one o’clock, well past time to get back home and feed Chloe. 

I stood slowly and progressed toward the hall. When I stepped inside…

… there he was… 

… a long-legged, skinny man who wore black jeans and a striped shirt. His arms appeared too short for his body and his hair was trimmed into a bowl cut.

“I see you got your blood work done,” he said, grinning. “My name is Jack. I just *love* getting my blood drawn.”

He waddled up to me and got inches from my face. 

*Dude!* My mind screamed as I scooted past him. *Back off!*

“Would you like to see my blood drawn?”

“No!”

“Too bad.” He pulled out an unused syringe and jammed it into his vein. “Ah… feels so good…”

***

I was so mortified that I sprinted to the counter and told the receptionist what had happened. “Yes, I know…” she admitted. “That’s Jack… he’s a regular here.”

“Why does everyone keep saying that?!”

“Because he’s here almost every day.” 

“Do something about it! Throw him out!”

“I’m sorry…” I heard his wispy voice behind me. 

Needle Jack was holding the blood-filled syringe he had just pulled from his vein. 

*Oh god…* I nearly gagged as he licked the vial.

“Beautiful…” he said. “So beautiful…” 

***

On the drive home, I was stunned. *Who was he? Why was he there? Why couldn’t anyone get rid of him?*

Once I got home and fed Chloe, I did some digging online. Turns out Needle Jack was a bit of a local legend.

Apparently, he’d been terrified of needles as a child. Whenever his mom had brought him to a clinic, he’d scream, “No, Mommy, please! Don’t let them poke me!”

But then one day, a mysterious woman came in and whispered something into his ear. He calmed down instantly and allowed the nurses to draw his blood. 

From that day on, the boy became obsessed with needles, even going so far as to demonstrate how to insert them into his veins for all to see.

Even some of the clinic’s online reviews mentioned him: “Service is fine but that needle guy is weird. Every time I go in he’s there talking to people, and it creeps me out. Why won’t the staff get rid of him?”

Two months later, I found out why. 

***

I was on my way home and headed downtown for an errand. Along the route, my front driver-side tire blew out. 

*Shit!*

I pulled into the nearest repair shop. Coincidentally, it just so happened to be a block away from the clinic. 

*No way.* I mused, taking in the scene.

I swaddled Chloe and wandered out to the sidewalk, figuring, *maybe I should drop in.* I had thirty minutes to kill. I could ask the nurses a few more questions. But it all seemed so silly.  

Regardless, I felt compelled to visit the building.

***

When I entered, the front desk was empty. There were no patients in the lobby either.

*Must be a slow day.*

“Yes… oh yes…” 

*Oh god.* I spun on my heel, my stomach turning. *There he is. Why did I come here?*

I pulled Chloe close and headed for the exit. But before I could reach the door, Needle Jack stepped in, blocking my path. 

“I was hoping you’d return. And even better, you've brought your child.”

“What do you want from me?”

“Your blood…” He gestured to my arm. “… her blood. It’s essential to my survival.”

My eyes darted to the door at the other end of the lobby.

“After each test, I take a sample. A little taste here and there. Blood keeps me strong. But a child’s is best.”

He pulled a syringe from his pocket. “If I could just draw a little… I promise it won’t hurt.” 

“Get away from me!” I cradled Chloe’s head and dashed to the far end of the room, sprinting outside.

***

I’d nearly reached the crosswalk when I glanced back and saw Jack gaining on us.

“Please, Sara! Give me her blood!”

I stopped at the end of the sidewalk. The auto shop was just across the street. But traffic was blazing.

*Damn!*

I glanced both ways and dashed into the road, barely missing a semi. A loud honk split my ears as I reached the shop’s parking lot, not even blinking. 

When I made it to the main doors, an agonizing scream caught my ears.

I turned and gasped at the sight of… 

… Needle Jack, sprawled in the road, his torso twisted like a rotini noodle. A car had struck him head-on. Vehicles screeched to a halt on all sides of him.

“Don’t worry, Sara!” he gasped and fell back into a mix of his own entrails. “I’ll be back. I always come back.”

***

The strangest thing happened after Needle Jack died. Almost instantly, the nurses and patients at the clinic seemed to come to their senses. It was like a long-held curse had been lifted off them.

“What was it like working there?” a news anchor asked one of the staff members. 

“A prison,” they responded. “Jack made us give him every patient’s blood. He’d torture us if we refused.”

Greg became disgusted with all the media attention. He begged us to move so we could enjoy a fresh start, but how could we do that? 

Chloe is older now and thriving in preschool. Our friendships with other parents have grown and our careers have blossomed.

The only thing that bothers me are Jack’s last words:

“Don’t worry, Sara. I’ll be back. I always come back.”

I wonder if he ever will.
