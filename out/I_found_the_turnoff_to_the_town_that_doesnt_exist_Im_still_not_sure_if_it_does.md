Alright, I just got back from Winewater Springs. I’ve got a couple shots of bad vodka in me, and I think my nerves are steady enough to write this. But I know less about what is going on than I did before. 


I was driving to Port Erehwon on my day off to see a movie and decided to take a weird route, north through Mudsark, then back south on back roads by Dutch Hollow. I did this for one reason and one reason only, I won’t disguise that fact. I was still hoping to find some evidence of a community just north of the gas station. 


I found it just at the end of the trees where the cornfields begin, curving back into the woods. 
The road was overgrown and looked more like a maintenance trail for a power line, but even still, I’m convinced it hadn’t been there before. I’ve been driving this route my whole life, I would have noticed it, right? Maybe not. I don’t know! 


I got out of my car to look around, and sure enough, there was a green turnoff sign next to it, face down in the ditch, covered in mud, mind you. But it existed. 


So I got back in my car and turned down the old trail. I knew there wasn’t a town down here, but the sign had read Winewater Springs (I think, once I lifted it up, only about a third was legible) 
The path was so overgrown and my car was far from an off-road vehicle that it took perhaps half an hour to go a mile down the track, but then the road started to improve. Turning at first to clear dirt, then soon to gravel, and finally to asphalt. It appeared to be in better condition than most roads in the county, and I wondered what it was doing out here, unfinished.


I didn’t have long to wonder, however, as I soon reached a small parking lot, beyond it the hillside had been blasted away to a flat cliff, and two large metal doors were embedded in it. It looked like a hangar for an airplane, but there was no runway to provide an explanation. I parked at the entrance to the parking lot, in the middle of the road, next to it was a sign made of carved whitewashed wood that read in a retro font “Welcome to Winewater Springs,” and below that in cursive the words “A dandy place to live!” 


The cheesy 1950s styling of the sign and the cold metal of the doors were at odds and yet somehow complementary, like a sports car and a pickup both made by the same company; some subtle quality remained that left them familiar to each other on first glance. 


Erehwon does have some old bunkers and forts, it’s so far from anything worth nuking that it was considered for a continuity of government site, or so local legend goes. With explanations of why other places on the mainland had been chosen instead, ranging from locals not liking it to the water table being too high. And about a dozen other stories, changing with the teller and sometimes with the telling. Something you should understand about us out on this rock is that we have very little to do, so we have developed a strong tradition of storytelling and folklore. At least that’s what I want to believe, could just be that we’re assholes who like scaring our girlfriends with ghost stories. 


Either way, I had heard stories about bunkers, even seen a few on school trips. There was one in Port Erehwon under the courthouse that we toured in the 7th grade. 


But I’m rambling because I don’t really want to explain the rest of what happened. I got out of my car and slowly walked across the parking lot. The door looked like something from the 50s, but it also looked new; it was so clean and unrusted (unheard of on this rain-sodden island) that I expected a security guard to appear at any moment and ask me what I was doing. The door was hanging just slightly ajar, and no sound could be heard anywhere around. I didn’t realize at the time, at least not with my head. But even the birds had fallen silent, I think. 


I peeked my head through the door, and saw a tunnel sloping down with bright light spilling up at the bottom, for some reason that I’m not entirely sure now, I felt I needed to go in. I think I did anyway, frankly, I’m not convinced I didn’t hallucinate everything after I turned off that road. And I hope I did, being crazy would be easier to rationalize than what I saw in there. 


My feet echoed on the smooth stone floor as I wandered down, the light growing brighter as I went. What I found at the bottom is…


Well, it’s hard to describe, not because it was so out of the ordinary you can’t imagine it. But because of how weirdly normal, almost artificially so, it was, except for its location. The best way I can describe the “vibe” of what I saw is to compare it to Main Street USA at Disney World, but even higher quality. 


The tunnel let out onto a street of paved blacktop. Raised sidewalks next to it, with facades of brick and stone and wood on either side. It looked like the Main Street of any small town in America, idyllic but instantly familiar. Flags hung from light poles, and bunting lined windows as I slowly walked through the echoing cavern. Above me, the ceiling was rough stone, but painted a bright robin’s egg blue with fluffy white clouds drawn on by some artist with a scaffold. 


The buildings themselves were as clean as if they had been built yesterday, but all had that subtle patina of age that makes old buildings special. The air smelled of nothing, not even the normal “rock” smell of a cave.  As silently as though I were in church, I walked with slow footsteps to the sidewalk and then up to the window of a storefront. The text “Main Street Drug Store” was emblazoned across the glass, and looking through, I could see shelves of merchandise and a long bar counter running one side of the room. A sign hung over it advertising “Ice Cream! Seven Flavors!” And a chalkboard behind the counter listed prices with nothing costing more than twenty cents. 


What was this place? I wondered at the time, though in hindsight not as strongly as I should have. Across the street, I found a barber shop, its striped pole slowly spinning outside its door, trying the handle. I found it unlocked and stepped inside. It was a perfect recreation of a 1950s barber shop, as near as I could tell. Though I admit any inaccuracies would probably slip past me unnoticed if they were not too far out of pocket for the time period. 


I wandered back out into the street and followed it to an intersection, the tunnel splitting in a 4-way cross. The buildings still lined every bit of their walls, ending at the stone roof of the cavern. Glancing around, I saw the left path narrow, slightly, with the roof lowering from three or four stories high to only about one and a half. Perhaps two at the most. Slowly, I made my way that way and found houses, ranch styles, and a few split levels built like the main street buildings as facades into the sides of the rock. 


Walking into one, I found it furnished and clean, lacking any trace of dust or age. With a pantry still stocked and a refrigerator still cold. It was as if someone were already living here. And they probably were, I told myself with a shake. I had allowed the shock of finding this place to hypnotize me into a lack of judgment, but clearly, I had broken into someone’s lived-in home. And they could be back any moment. 


More clearly now, I wondered what this place was; people clearly lived here, as some had come to my gas station, but where were they? Why build all of this and maintain it? Who had paid for it? These were all questions that seemed important to me in that moment. 


Walking faster now, but still trying to be quiet, I walked back towards the intersection. I reached it in about half the time it had taken me to find the house, and I was just turning to leave when I heard a faint sound from a brick building farther up the street, away from where I had come in. 


It may sound insane, hell, it DOES sound insane. But if you are judging me, so am I, believe it. I felt at that instant that I needed to find the source of the sound. I realized then that other than footsteps and my own breathing, that faint noise was it music? It was the only thing I had heard since turning off my car. 


As I got closer, it was clear to me that it was indeed music. The sounds of children singing the national anthem were drifting from what I saw now was a two-story brick schoolhouse. The words “Memorial School” are carved above the door. As I stepped through its front door, the sound of singing grew louder, and for the first time since entering this weird simulacrum of the 1950s, I smelled something: a faint acrid chemical tang that I could not place. Only noticeable because of how little smell anything else in this place had. 


I followed the sound up the stairs, they creaked faintly underneath my feet, but I kept going. When I reached the door to a classroom labeled “207,” I could tell that the sound was coming from just on the other side. And slowly, I reached out to turn the handle


It was unlocked as all the other doors had been and swung open with a faint creak. Inside was an empty room, fear and disappointment rushed through me in equal measure as I stared around the room looking for the source of the singing. A fairly typical classroom, posters depicting things relevant to the subjects at hand lined the walls. And colorful paper shapes like stars and snowflakes were tacked to the walls. I slowly scanned the room, turning in a circle, and finally, I found it, the source of the noise. 


A lone record player sat on the teacher’s desk spinning as it belted out the final lines of the anthem. The childlike voices, already not great singers rendered ethereal, by the scratchy recording. Slowly, I reached out with my hand to raise the needle from the record and restore the funeral-esque silence of this place. But the instant my fingers lifted the arm from the vinyl, everything was engulfed in a pure, unpierced darkness


For a moment, I was in panic, underground, as I was it was not only dark, it was fully and truly lacking in light. Not darkness, but blindness. And my other senses were already compensating. I could hear the faint creaking of the building, smell that same chemical smell stronger now, and mixed with the smells of mold and damp. Then my senses started to return to me and I fished my phone from my pocket, turning on its flashlight setting. It took a second for my eyes to adjust, but when they did, I screamed with terror.


The light had played across the desks as I turned it on, but they were no longer devoid of students; the room had changed, paint peeled from the walls, and the posters were yellowed and curled by moisture. But I didn’t notice any of that, though I remember it now, so some part of me must have logged it. All I could see was the children’s skeletal remains propped in each of the chairs, partially mummified and seeming to watch me with their dead, empty eyes. Bodies twisted oddly with hands over mouths and heads under tables.


I backed up, breathing heavily until my legs collided with the teacher's desk, and spinning in fear, I saw him too, frozen forever as if grabbing at his throat. His empty, rotted eyes stared questioningly into my soul, asking why I had dared disturb his rest. And I ran, headlong down the stairs, light flashing around wildly and out onto the street. More were dead on the street, twisted or captured in the midst of some last heroic act, a mother forever mummified over the corpse of her baby, and a police man holding a little girl as she died, himself following her by mere moments. All these signs and more were implied by the poses I saw, but I didn’t care for their story, only for my escape. I ran feet slamming into the ground like jackhammers as I reached the end of the town. Here, the road curved back up to the surface. 


I stopped for a moment to catch my breath, and playing the light around the space, saw something I had missed before. Above the exit tunnel, in faded and peeling paint, was a faint grinning yellow smiley face. “Have a nice day” forever left underneath, its unblinking eyes a silent witness to whatever unknown horror had happened here. 


And then I was off again, running up the sloping path and out through the crack in the doors. My legs were burning, but I shot across the parking lot and threw myself into my car. But something was wrong, I hadn’t run across a parking lot. I had run across grass, dotted with low shrubs, and my car, where I had parked it beside the wooden sign on the access road, was now sitting on a simple dirt track. Overgrown and hard to see as it snaked into the woods. 


I stared in disbelief at the hillside where the doors had been and saw only stone, blasted clearly, at some point far in the past, eroded back to something almost natural. But that was all, no entrance tunnel or cave. This place had the look of an abandoned construction site now, there were signs of rock having been blasted and not cleared. Some rusted things that might have been equipment lay strewn about this empty lot. But nothing remained of the town that I had just left, and its scene. Of its mass death and massacre. 


I somehow made it home, though I don’t remember much about that trip, just that it was getting dark by the time I made it to the road an hour later. I checked my watch. And saw that somehow I had spent 12 hours in that place, if it ever even existed at all. 


One last thing to note, I went back the next day, you can call me an idiot all you want, but I need answers. I didn’t get any. It was still nothing more than a long-abandoned construction site. I post this here both as a record of what I saw and as a cry for help. Please! Please, if anyone has any idea what I saw, please let me know. 



And a word from the wise, if you start hearing people talking about somewhere that doesn’t exist, just ignore them.
