When my wife and I had our first son, we were more than delighted. I had two children from my previous marriage, but this was the first child we had together. We figured that our first child would strengthen our marriage. Later my wife gave birth to a daughter and another son. We truly felt blessed.

However, it wasn't long until tragedy struck and we had our boys taken from us. Not long after that their sister followed them to the grave as well. The grief was overbearing. What had we done to deserve this?

We had more children over the following years. Despite the experienced grief, we were more than joyful to welcome another son to this world. As time went on however, I began to notice how sickly this child was. I didn't want to grow more attached than I already was. So I made a conscious decision to emotionally distance myself from the child. In retrospect, I know how wrong I was to do that. I left most of the burden involved with taking care of the child to my wife. I spent a large amount of my time drinking and neglecting my family.

One time I returned home after a night of spending time with my friends at the local bar. As I entered my apartment, I heard some noise in the darkness. I thought it was one of my older children staying up later than they were allowed to. This annoyed me to a great extend. I stepped further into the apartment ready to teach them a lesson. To my surprise, I saw a dark silhouette looming over our baby. I started shouting at the figure, asking who they were. The figure seemed startled. The person I thought to be a burglar tried to say something to me in a hasty voice, but I couldn't understand him. I was angry, and in my anger I picked up a glass bottle from the counter. I then hit this intruder in the head with the bottle. The bottle broke and the intruder lost his balance. He tried to get back up, but I kept hitting him with the shards of the broken bottle.

Amidst the chaos, the rest of my family woke up. My daughter started screaming. Apparently while I was distracted fighting with this man, another one had snatched our baby from his crib. The other man was making his way to the window. It was thanks to my eldest son that he didn't get any further. He saved his younger half-brother by grabbing the man's strange robes. The man dropped our baby to the floor, though. This further enraged me. The baby's mother and sister picked him up as he started crying. In the mean time I tried to question this man. It turned out that he didn't speak our language either. I told my son to go and fetch the police. I was certain that the neighbours were awake at this point. They probably thought that I was just acting violently on my own.

I checked up on my baby son, and the man I tried to question took an advantage of the situation. He ran to the window and started swiftly climbing down a rope attached near it. I went to glance down the window, but the intruder had vanished into the night. We were left with the corpse of the other one. When the police arrived, they investigated what had happened as a burglary. Neither of the men were ever identified. I was exempted from any legal charges as I had been deemed to have acted in self-defense.

Much to our grief, this wouldn't be the only such incident. Over the years we had several similar experiences of strange people targeting our child. These people with odd clothing would escape and quickly vanish every time after we intervened. What made the situation even more strange is the fact that they only seemed to target this child and not his siblings. 

I tried to tell others about these experiences, but I was dismissed. I gained the reputation of a mad drunk. Honestly, if it weren't for my family members being able to recall the same events, I would have questioned my sanity too. As confused as I was, I knew one thing:
They couldn't have him. Not my baby. I've lost too many children already. My wife couldn't bear to lose another one.

As the child grew, we tried moving away to a small farm in the countryside. At the same time this seemed like a nice opportunity to escape the reputation I had gained in town.

It wasn't long until it was made apparent that the strange people had followed us there. During our last encounter I heard a man and a woman talk outside of our house at night. They were the first ones to speak our language, though, they spoke in some unfamiliar dialect. Yet, what they were saying was mostly understandable. They kept rambling about how something had to be done. This raised my curiosity. Before I could hear more, they headed to the barn. I guess that perhaps they were waiting there for a better opportunity to strike. 

I took my pistol and slowly snuck towards the barn. Curious to learn more, I decided to eavesdrop on them before shooting. Unfortunately, I lost my balance. I fell and the two strangers ganged up on me. They disarmed me before I could reach for my pistol. 

Out of nowhere some bald man charged against one of the attackers. They wrestled on the ground. The other attacker holding my pistol tried to aim for the bald man, but couldn't get a clear line of sight. While she was distracted, I stood back up and jumped her. The pistol fell from her hands. She pulled out a knife from her belt. She stabbed my arm, after which I pushed her so that she fell on her own knife. 

Then I searched for the pistol that was dropped on the ground. I was too late to help the man who had saved me just seconds before. The attacker struck the man that had just saved me. Even if he won the fight, he was still laying down on the floor, so I managed to prevent him from getting up by kicking him until he lost his counsciousness. In my mind I thanked the random stranger that had just saved me. 

Once the man woke up, I tried to question him about the intentions of this strange group targeting my son. From what I gathered, it wasn't just one singular group, but many different groups trying the same thing. This intrigued me further. What is so important about our son to warrant all of this? Why would all these different entities try to take him away?

When I questioned him on this, he kept trying to convince me that something was necessary for the future of humanity. When I kept pressing him on what exactly it was that is necessary, he eventually started screaming in tears that it was the killing of my son that was necessary. Anger took over me when he said that. I don't even want to describe what I did to him after that.

I need to protect my baby no matter what. Oh my sweet Adolf, your father is going to protect you from these monsters.
