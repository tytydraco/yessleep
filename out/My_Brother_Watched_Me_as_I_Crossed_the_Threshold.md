I’m Elizabeth. Twenty-six, three kids, no husband. My brother lives with us. He’s quiet, helpful, and keeps to himself—which I used to appreciate.

Lately, the walls in this house feel thinner. Not just the kind of thin where you can hear someone snore, but too thin. Like the drywall’s losing the will to separate one room from another.

It started last week.

Every morning, I wake up before sunrise, make breakfast, drop the kids off at school, and come back to an empty house. I love those quiet hours—coffee, laundry, a little peace before the day begins.

But last Monday, when I came home, the front door was locked from the inside. I could see through the glass—my brother standing in the hallway, facing the door.

“Hey, can you unlock it?” I asked, knocking lightly.

He didn’t move. Just stared. Then, as soon as I slid my key into the lock, he bolted down the hall, laughing like a kid hiding from a parent. The sound of his bedroom door slamming was sharp enough to make me drop my keys.

When I went to ask what that was about, he just smiled, like I’d imagined it.

⸻

Tuesday, it got worse.

He started asking me things—small, normal things—but in a way that felt wrong.

“Can I have a cup?” he’d say.

“For what?”

He’d stare, dead serious. “To get something to drink.”

And then… it’s like he’d blink out of it. Eyes soften. Posture relaxes. “Never mind,” he’d laugh.

I told myself he was just tired. But it kept happening. He’d ask to use things he already owned, like he was rehearsing how to be human.

That night, I woke up to his shadow under my door. Just standing there.

⸻

By Wednesday, I was shaking every time I saw him.

Thursday through Saturday—nothing.

No weird questions.
No laughter.
No watching.

Just my routine again. Dropping the kids off. Coming home. Quiet.

I started thinking maybe I’d overreacted. Memories twist when you don’t sleep enough. Maybe I’d confused real things with imagined ones. Maybe he’d just been joking.

⸻

Then came Sunday.

After church, the kids and I pulled into the driveway. Their chatter died mid-sentence. Through the glass of the front door, we all saw him—standing in the hallway again, facing us.

His head tilted slowly, like he was listening to something we couldn’t hear.

When I unlocked the door, he grinned—not the grin of a grown man, but a child trying to hide a secret.

“Do you wanna play hide‑and‑seek, Liz?” he asked, voice small and playful.

The kids clung to me. I told him to stop. He only laughed and walked away down the hall.

⸻

Then, around 5 a.m., I woke to a sound I’ll never forget.

Teeth.
Grinding.

Right beside my ear.

The vibration of it shook through the pillow, scraping rhythmically: left, right, left, right. I opened my eyes to see him hunched over me, eyes closed, jaw working so violently I thought his teeth might break.

Then he stopped. His mouth didn’t move, but his voice came through it anyway.

“Follow me.”

He stepped backward from the bed in jerky, too‑quick motions, blocking the doorway. Every step he took landed perfectly in front of the other, like his body was skipping frames.

He laughed the whole time—soft, breathy, like he was holding in a giggle.

Then he turned, still laughing, and opened his bedroom door.

The darkness inside wasn’t natural. It looked heavy—like someone had painted the air with wet charcoal. The light from the hallway bent toward it and disappeared.

From within, his voice came out again, high and childish.

“Come through the threshold. It’s fun.”

I wanted to run. To grab the kids and leave. But I didn’t.
Because I knew if I didn’t follow him, he’d find them instead.

So I stepped through.

⸻

Now it’s Monday again. We just finished playing hide‑and‑seek with the kids.

He was right.

I don’t regret crossing the threshold.

I love the sound of laughter now—especially when the kids start to cry, when we hide.
