When I was a kid, about like six years old, I had the smallest room in the house. My family had a small house in general. My two older brothers shared a room up to when I was about 10 and my middle sibling got the attic after it was renovated. Because my room was so small, I had a loft bed. Still because it stood against the inner side of the sloping roof it only gave a small room underneath it. But I made the best of it and stored many many boxes of Lego under it. On the foot and head side of the bed were small spaces. Only 20 centimeters wide but wide enough so I could climb up and down my bed with them. Another cool feature of the bed was the desk attached to it. It was facing the window on the opposite side of the door. It was supposed to be a place where I could do my homework, but as if I ever did my homework at that age. You may wonder why I am telling you all of this. Why you need to know how my room looked when I was a small child. But that’s were this one night came. I don´t remember how old I was but I guess I was seven. Far above the age when you can´t distinguish between a dream and reality. Far above the age when you put pieces of Lego up your nose and just in general are just a stupid child. And that’s what makes my experience even more weird.

I always had trouble falling asleep and still have. Back then I would always not close the door entirely, so a bit of light entered the room. I needed that because I was a bit of a squeamish kid. As it is usual when you have older brothers, they exposed me to many things I wasn´t ready for. My first time learning about World War two was when I watched a let’s play of Wolfenstein: The new order with my oldest brothers. When a scene showing the aftermath of human experiments came, he paused and said something along the lines of “Maybe you shouldn’t watch this.” This was after I had already seen BJ gun down countless soldiers and stabbing them to death. He took me down into the kitchen and told me about WW2. The whole time I was thinking about those corpses I had seen on his screen. To sum it up, I saw some shit at a young age and didn´t like falling asleep in total darkness. Now you know everything you need to know to understand this night. Or at least kinda understand it. Not even I fully grasp it.

It was the middle of the night. I woke up feeling the desire to go to the toilette. But something was off. My room was clad in total darkness. Not a single bit of light. The way to the toilette wasn´t long. Just walk down the ladder that was next to the door and walk through the small corridor and open the bathroom door. All in all maybe 7 meters to walk. But for some reason I didn´t took the obvious path. No. I raised my body and climbed down the small opening between bed and wall. My feet touched the ground and I let go off the wooden bedframe. Ahead of me was now a small path. The bed and the desk. Then I would get to the opening and could walk to the door. Of course, I didn´t see anything but with a room so small as mine, I knew every centimeter. I began to set one foot after the other. A second later I left could feel the desk. It touched my chest and was like a barrier I had to go around of. Another few steps and I would be finally able to go to the toilette.

I took those steps, expecting to feel the clearing. But the clearing didn´t came. Instead, the barrier I felt at my chest let me in a turn. “What?”, I asked myself. This wasn´t how I knew my room. My back was still touching the wall when normally I was touch the window. I felt dread creeping through my body. My throat became as dry as a desert. “This can´t be.”, I mumbled. I felt goosebumps on my arms but no matter what, I would reach the toilette. Maybe I just had turned around unknowingly and that was why it felt so weird. I reached out to the barrier and wall and began to walk again. Expecting to soon reach the clearing I upped my pace and walked further. But the clearing didn´t came. Just more wall and more desk. As if the space had been stretched out impossibly.

That’s when the fear broke me. A tear fell down my cheek. I was somewhere other than my room. I thought about just screaming but a small voice in my head told me: “What if you are just stupid? If you scream now, your parents will wake up and be very angry at you. Papa has to work tomorrow.” I felt so hopeless in that moment. Defeated there was just one exit. Try to get back to my bed. I turned around and took three or four steps. Suddenly my hand felt the bedframe. “What?”, I asked my self again. It just made the whole scene so much weirder. But I should be grateful. I reached out my hands and grabbed the upper part of the bedframe before pulling my self up and climbing back under my now cold blanket. Still crying a bit, I somehow fell asleep.

The next morning, I was woken up by my mom. Light filled the room and it looked just normal. So otherworldly stretching. I climbed down the ladder and walked down into the kitchen. Not mentioning the weird events of the night.
