I left the hospital.

I couldn’t avoid ‘The Real World’. My character was withering away, and I was following suit.

Firstly, to update all of you, I tried to resolve the situation whilst I was in the hospital. I called my girlfriend, Darcy, and asked her to play the game for me. She didn’t accuse me of lying, but she thought I’d hit my head and imagined the entire thing. She suggested psychiatric help. I said I’d do whatever she wanted, but I just wanted her to go over to my house and take care of my character. I wanted her to do it for me.

“Okay. I’ll go over to your house and play the game, but I’m coming to the hospital after work. I want to see you. I love you.”

That was the last thing Darcy said before hanging up. When she stopped replying to my texts, I found myself succumbing to intrusive thoughts about awful scenarios that might have taken place. *What if the game has chosen her as its new host? What if my dad caught her and hurt her?*

I had to go home.

As I hobbled out of the building on crutches, I looked down at my left foot, which was being held together by a metal rod. Still, there was no physical evidence that, less than a day prior, it had been a mangled mess. And yet, I experienced a phantom sensation. My foot still felt as if it were twisted around. I still endured excruciating pain. *Maybe I need to take my injured character to the medical centre, too*, I thought.

The taxi driver attempted to engage in small talk about my injury, but my mind was vacant. My eyesight had become hazy, and I had a throbbing headache. I was experiencing dehydration, starvation, sleep-deprivation, and (possibly) blood loss. My character was suffering, so I was suffering.

When I leapt out of the taxi, I was on the verge of passing out. I burst through the front door, ready to apprehend my dad and ask him what the fuck he had bought for me. *Where did you find the game? Are you trying to kill me?* I imagined the things I’d say.

My dad wasn’t home.

I didn’t think anything of it. I was close to collapsing. I sprinted to the study and found that the computer was still switched on. The game window for ‘The Real World’ was open. I slumped into my chair and hurriedly raced into action. ‘Drink’ was my first move. My throat soon felt soothed. ‘Eat’ followed. The searing pain in my stomach subsided. Then, I moved my character to the upstairs bedroom and selected ‘Sleep’. Though I (the real me) remained awake, I slowly started to feel revitalised.

I survived by the skin of my teeth. The knot in my chest started to loosen, if only a little. Everything in ‘The Real World’ happens in real-time, of course, so I realised I would have to leave my character in bed for several hours. I was still drained of energy, but after an hour or so of digital sleep, I no longer felt *entirely* depleted. My character’s ‘ENERGY’ bar was gradually filling up.

I decided that it was time to figure out how to stop the madness. I had work to do. Of course, I didn’t want to exert too much real-life energy. But I still wasn’t exactly sure of the mechanics behind this computerised voodoo doll magic. And that was why I started to browse the internet on my phone, searching for answers. There was no time to waste.

I revisited the forum I mentioned in the first post. I found the user, ‘Guest17’, who had told me about something called Veilbreaking. It’s the act of recovering a soul from the world of the dead. I told Guest17 that it didn’t really seem applicable to my predicament. This was his exact reply:

*“Think about it. Veilbreaking allows you to move your soul between realities. It might detach you from the voodoo doll, given that your soul seems to currently be tied to it.”*

Yeah, I wasn’t buying any of that shit. I didn’t want to add more curses to the pile. That being said, it wasn’t a fruitless chat. I knew I needed some sort of “magic” solution, so I asked Guest17 where he learnt so much about Veilbreaking. And that’s when he popped up in my private messages on the forum.

*“Not everything’s on Google, you know. \[link redacted\].”*

The link was an invitation to a Discord server called ‘XI’. I knew it was sketchy, but I was out of fucking options. I couldn’t depend on a video game for the rest of my life. I couldn’t keep completing deadly challenges, living every moment in utter dread. It had to stop.

I accepted the invite.

The ‘XI’ server had 547 members. And they seemed obsessed with all manner of supernatural things. There were numerous rooms:

‘Discussion’

‘Entities’

‘Exorcisms’

‘Heart Charms’

‘Navigators of the Void’

‘Veilbreaking’

‘Voodoo’

‘Witchcraft’

‘11’

I immediately went to the ‘Voodoo’ section and explained my predicament. I know nothing about the supernatural, but it certainly seemed that someone had made a virtual voodoo doll of me. I hoped somebody on the forum might be able to help. The first reply was a little harsh:

RRen: Effigies (Voodoo dolls) aren’t actually linked to Voodoo culture, you filthy casual. Who let you onto this server? It’s private.

Fortunately, one of the other replies was a little friendlier:

Tuscan: RRen is right, but he’s also a dickhead. You’re in serious danger, \[my username\]. Technological magic is the specialty of riprip78. Message him.

I messaged riprip78. I waited and waited. No reply.

Around 3pm, six hours after returning from the hospital, my stomach started to rumble. *Really? My character’s sleeping, and he ate before going to bed,* I thought to myself, sighing. I looked at the game window for ‘The Real World’, and my jaw froze.

My character’s ‘FOOD’ bar was practically full.

It dawned on me that I didn’t just have to keep myself alive in the game. I still had to eat, drink, and sleep in the real world. I would have to survive through two different bodies.

I stumbled into the darkened kitchen, overcome with a terrible feeling of powerlessness. *How long can I keep this up?* I wondered, as I eyeballed the ready meal that was rotating in the microwave. I’d have to keep performing deadly challenges to earn Tokens *and* keep working in the real world to earn money. My manager had taken me off the kitchen rota whilst I recovered, but there were still real-life bills to be paid. And it seemed my dad had finally left town, so he wasn’t going to be paying his way.

I strolled back into the study, tucking into my bowl of macaroni and cheese. Still no reply from riprip78. Whilst I waited, I decided that I had to do something about the agonising pain in my foot. It had been treated in the real world, but it still had that phantom sensation of being twisted and mutilated. I looked at the game window. My character’s ‘HEALTH’ bar had been depleted to the extent that it was orange in colour. If I could heal him, perhaps my real-world pain would subside. It was worth a try.

I decided that six hours of rest would be sufficient, so I tore my character out of bed. It was time to finally explore the ‘MEDICAL’ building. I had to be quick. It would be shutting shortly, after all.

My character limped out of the front door, facing the white nothingness of the horrendous hellscape. Turning to my right, I strolled over to the building beside me. This time, the door wasn’t locked. I strolled through it, feeling uneasy about the potential horrors that might lie within.

I had expected a local health clinic. I had expected to be told that I needed to ring and come back when I had an appointment. Instead, I was faced with a bizarrely-enormous hospital. There was an expansive waiting area, and it was overflowing with silhouetted NPCs. This was even more detailed than the shop.

There had been jolly, elevator-style music in the ‘FOOD’ store. In the ‘MEDICAL’ building, however, there were sparse, dissonant piano notes playing. It filled me with both sorrow and horror in equal measure. There was something wrong with the idea of cold piano plinks being chosen as the background music for a building filled with such life, even though it was artificial life.

Additionally, the building, like a Tardis, was far larger on the inside. In the centre of the open-plan ground floor, there was a staircase which led up to numerous levels. Moving my character’s POV upwards, I could see the interior of the hospital building all of the way up to the very top floor. The staircase zigzagged upwards. I counted six levels to the building.

Remembering why I came, I walked over to the reception desk. I prayed for a brief break from realism. *No waiting times. No need for appointments. Just let me see a doctor.*

My wish was granted. The silhouetted woman spoke through text boxes, much like the cashier at the ‘FOOD’ shop:

“Hello! My name’s Kiera. How can I help you?”

‘I need to see a doctor’

‘I want to volunteer’

The second option unnerved me. *Volunteer to do what?* I wondered. I selected the first option, obviously.

“Dr Ted will see you on the third floor. Room 319. That’ll cost 500 tokens. Thank you!”

*Figures*, I thought, watching the ‘-500’ pop-up window come and go. I strolled up the stairs, trying my very best to ignore the haunting piano music that filled this eerie, white, black-outlined building. I thought about muting the game. Believe me. But two things stopped me:

1. I didn’t want the game to penalise me again. I might not survive my next trip to the hospital.
2. I didn’t want to miss anything.

For all I knew, I might miss something important if I were to mute the game. I decided to soldier onwards, weaving in and out of silhouetted doctors and civilians.

When I reached the third floor, I followed the numbers until I reached Room 319. I strolled inside, and a silhouetted doctor was waiting for me. A text box appeared:

“My name is Dr Ted. What seems to be the problem?”

‘I have a headache’

‘I have a mental health problem’

‘I severed a bone in the challenge’

I selected the sadistic option at the bottom, obviously. It felt as if the game were tormenting me. It knew exactly why I had come into the ‘MEDICAL’ building. I was horrified by the prospect of some intelligent entity watching my every move and terrorising me. Another text box popped up:

“Let me have a look. Ah, okay. That’s an easy fix.”

Seconds later, the pain in my real-life ankle subsided. My character stood upright, seemingly better.

“Thank you, Archie Bolton. *Come again*!”

My blood turned to ice in my veins. I’d never specified my name whilst playing the game. ‘The Real World’ knew me. Of course it knew me. Why should I be so shocked by that? And yet, something about seeing my name on the screen made the curse feel so much more unbelievably frightening. The torture felt personal, I suppose.

With full bars across the board, I exited Room 319 and strolled over to the third-floor balcony that overlooked everything from the ground floor below to the very top floor. Every moment of time that I spent in the game was chilling, but I didn’t see what other option I had. There had still been no reply from riprip78 on my phone. I had to learn about the mechanics of ‘The Real World’. If I could figure out the game, maybe I could beat it.

That was when I noticed something. The dissonant piano was no longer the only audible sound in the hospital. I could hear voices. Shouting. I saw movement on the other side of the building. Silhouetted NPCs were dragging two squirming silhouettes along the second-floor hallway.

“Where the fuck are we?” A girl wailed.

“Let me go!” A man bellowed.

I immediately recognised both voices. The girl was Darcy, and the man was my dad.

Unable to accept this dreadful twist in the game’s hellish vendetta against me, I found myself disassociating from everything. There was ringing in my ears, as I fervently struggled to process what was happening. I scrambled for some sort of explanation. I had nothing.

I moved my character down the stairs, exiting onto the second floor. Following the silhouetted figures from a safe distance, I hoped with every fibre of my being to ascertain that they were *not*, in fact, capturing my girlfriend and my dad. The large group of striding shadows entered a door on their right. The sign above it read ‘SURGERY’.

I burst through the doorway, throwing caution to the wind in my blind panic. Behind the door, of course, was yet another narrow hallway, and I could hear Darcy at the end of the corridor. She was bawling her eyes out.

“DARCY!” I bellowed.

She didn’t respond, but she kept crying. I had a microphone connected to my computer, but I realised that Darcy probably couldn’t hear me. The game had no settings, after all. There was no option to switch a microphone on or off. I was unable to communicate. So, I watched helplessly as the five silhouetted NPCs dragged Darcy and my dad into an operating room on their left.

I realised that long windows spanned the entire hallway, so I could see into the room. My hands froze on the keyboard. I stood and watched. The voices within the room were muffled, but Darcy was shouting at such volume that I could hear her clearly.

“What have you done to us? What is this place?” She cried.

“I’ll fucking kill you!” My dad raged, frothing at the mouth.

The five silent NPCs started to strap my girlfriend and my dad to two separate operating tables. The hospital’s background music became foreground music. The slightly out-of-tune piano plinks now resonated powerfully atop the screams of the two victims. Even in such a desolate world of black, outlined shapes, painted against a white backdrop, everything felt real. In fact, what followed was the most real thing I’ve ever seen.

I could see one of the NPCs fiddling on a computer. As if they’d transmitted a message to me, a pop-up box appeared on my screen. It read:

“How should we proceed?”

‘Save them (-10,000 Tokens)’

‘Kill them (+10,000 Tokens)’

I repeatedly clicked ‘Save them’, but a deafening buzzing noise sounded with every click, and the same message incessantly popped up:

‘Insufficient Tokens’

“Give me a fucking challenge to earn some Tokens, then!” I screamed at the screen, tears rolling down my cheeks.

Another window popped up:

“Only the original player can operate the simulated character. Unauthorised players must face trial in ‘The Real World’. Select an option.”

‘Save them (-10,000 Tokens)’

‘Kill them (+10,000 Tokens)’

I placed my face in my palms and sobbed. Truthfully, I didn’t give a moment’s thought for my villainous father. I was thinking of Darcy. Only Darcy. The beautiful, redheaded girl who radiated such warmth and vibrant colour. Now, she was reduced to a black silhouette, writhing on an outlined operating table.

Another window popped up:

“Pick an option. You have 10 seconds.”

“You won’t let me… You won’t let me pick the option I want…” I blubbered.

“The offer has timed out. ‘The Real World’ has chosen to kill them.”

“NO!” I screeched.

One of the figures picked up a large bucket and started pouring a white liquid with a black outline over Darcy’s body. Horrifyingly, as loudly as she screamed, her voice was mostly lost in the sea of piercing piano notes that seemed to be building towards a vile crescendo.

As the piano played, cheapening the very real terror that my girlfriend was enduring, I had never felt so utterly powerless and petrified. She emitted a scream that I am sure barely began to express the gruelling brutality of her suffering. As the white liquid poured over Darcy, her body started to melt, transforming before my eyes from a black silhouette into a black pool of liquid.

Her final, pained wail swiftly transitioned into a haunting, warbling whisper, as if she were gargling water, and she became a black, gooey liquid that trickled down the sides of the outlined operating table. I could not speak. I could not blink. I could not move.

“Don’t you bring that shit near me!” My dad growled. “Fucking… NO! Let me out of these restraints! Let’s fight properly!”

I hated him. I hated my dad more than I’d ever hated anything. He bought ‘The Real World’ as a form of psychological torture, even if he hadn’t quite anticipated the supernatural horrors that would unfold. It was his fault that Darcy was dead.

“Hey!” My dad shouted. “Who’s watching us from the hallway? Is that… ARCHIE? Are you playing the game? Archie, it’s your dad! HELP!”

I didn’t respond. I was completely devoid of feeling for the monster in the shackles.

“Archie?” My dad gasped, seemingly stung by my inaction.

He soon showed his true colours.

“You fucking waste of space!” He yelled. “I nearly smothered you in your fucking sleep when you were a kid, you know. I could’ve crushed you like a bug! I *should’ve* done it, you fucking- ARGHHHH!”

I locked my gaze onto Darcy’s liquified body, tears stinging my eyes and dread consuming my heart, as the NPC with the bucket started to pour. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my dad melt into the same pool of gore as Darcy. It was a gruesome sight, even though I despised him. His screams rapidly dissipated.

Everything was still.

There was no sound, other than the sinister piano melody that played ceaselessly.

I wiped the tears from my eyes and looked at my screen. As I watched the NPCs, my heart started to thump frantically against the inside of my ribcage.

The motionless silhouettes were facing the window. They were facing *me*.

Pulling me back into the ‘real’ world, my phone buzzed.
