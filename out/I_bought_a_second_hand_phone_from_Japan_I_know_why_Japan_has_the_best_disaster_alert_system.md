Hey guys, my name is Abel or atleast that is what people always call me. I dont like to socialize with people around me.

I do have some friends and they are kind to me. One day people at school started talking about this Battle Ground mobile game series. This is because of it new in game season.

My phone is kinda crappy and playing intense game like that might cause it to explode. So, I browse the internet to find second hand phone.

I want to buy new phone but Im out of budget to say in the first place. So I take my shot into the second hand market.

After browsing for a while I saw a phone. LG v35, and it is a good condition. It is a clearance stock sale and the seller stated that the phone is relatively good beside he never reset it yet.

That's mean I need to reset the phone myself. So the phone are about 40 dollar so I bought it. Around a week later the phone arrived.

I charge it full and browse inside it. It seems like this phone old owner is an office lady. Last picture taken is around one year ago. It had some picture and apps but this phone still had around 80gb storage left so I said to myself. "Well some picture woulndt bother me. Besides, this girl is kinda cute"

I honestly admired the girl, she looks cute and energetic. Atleast from her video and picture. She also have media social account but I will not go into detail to protect her privacy.

After all of that I manage to set the phone to my regional simcard setting. It is a bit of work but I got it done

Suddenly a pop out come. 「In order to fully guarantee your safety, au disaster alert need to ignore your location privacy」

I look at it and I click yes, I said to myself "Well this is just my secondary phone, I'll just used it tto pplay games"

Everything went normal for couples of weeks. One night when Im at the libary, my phone buzz brutally. The LG phone. I pick it up and there is a pop up saying

[You are is a dangerous area, follow the following instruction to guarantee your safety.]


I look the phone for a bit and after that I heard a heavy object crash on the first floor of the libary, I peak from the second floor and saw something that might haunted me forever.

A creature with a long hair and limb is eating the librarian. This is so sudden for me, Im glad that I didnt scream as my natural reaction. I look at the creature and my phone buzz again.

[Go the the third floor and use the emergency stair to get out of the building. Dont make any loud sound]

I dash my way to the third floor qith the tip of my feet to avoind any noise.

Once I arrived at the emergency stair. I heard something rushing towards me. The emergency alert system started to give me warning.

[Run as fast as you can to the parking lot]

I do as instructed and when I arrived. The phine started to give instruction again.

[To the Ford fiesta car, the door is not locked]

I dash my way, open the door and slammed it.

[Lock the door and laid down at the back seat]

Again I do as instructed.

I heard something outside the car. I didnt dare to peak, slowly I began to fall asleep.

Before dawn, the LG phone ring. I pick it up, and a voice talk to me.

"Hello, nice to meet you"

From her voice, I knew. It is the previous owner. We had some conversation even thou we barely understand each other.

She allow me to keep her picture in exchange of some of my picture, she want to be friend. Im delighted and happy.

I almost forgot about that night case.

I snapback to reality and no one is outside. When I get out just then I saw police car. And a smal crowd outside the libary. 

I knew what happen so Im not that shocked. When I get to the edge of the crowd, I saw it. This cant be real.

A women with office clothing on. Staring at me from the other side if the road. The previous owner, it cant be. She is in Japan.


Suddenly.... my phone buzz again........
