I had never thought of this as a "paranormal" experience though looking at the Black Eyed Kids stuff I think it's maybe similar.

In 2010 I was driving up my own street with a girl I hung out with sometimes. Not often/consistent enough for us to have alot of shared experiences or much influence on eachother. Anyway the street were driving on is a long residential street going through the city of Cleveland as well as out through it's suburbs. There are a bunch of horse-shoe side streets that branch off it and come back to it (this will come into play later)  


Anyway as we're driving the girl R gasps and says something to the effect of "Look at the bunnies" and pointed to the sidewalk, which was a heavily pedestrian trafficked sidewalk. Now I dont want to shame anyone, but what she point at was a regular looking woman walking and holding hands with two "children"? who were about 3.5 feet tall but disfigured in ways that go far beyond some type of accident. By this I mean, the one girl had a single arm as long as her body and the other arm normal, and her head was at some uneven angle having like totally sagged downwards on one side. They were covered in loose skin too I remember. The other child was a little boy who was equally shocking though I dont remember him much. When we passed them we were both wigged out, she kept calling them "The Bunnies" which is how we would refer to them when discussing this.

They looked like like they had something like The Elephant Man rather than something paranormal, and I guess it could be that this woman was the caretaker of two children with that type of condition, but their bone structures and anatomy were like a Dali painting. 

Well, maybe a year later I was with that girl again, we had probably seen eachother like 3 times in the intermediary. We were driving on that same street and started talking about the "Bunnies" (I want to make it clear we were liek 17 and 16 hence all this immaturity) and how weird that was. Well, we had to turn around for some reason so I took one of the horeshoe cul de sacs and like maybe 6 houses up (I still know this house, though its been 14 years) she like screams and points, and I kid you not, the girl from before, the one with the long arm, once again wearing some classic like 1940s/50s looking dress (total ghost girl type dress) is standing dead center in the yard just totally still looking at the road. We freaked out and kept driving.

THIS PART I could have made up, but I think we turned around to see her again and she was gone. The rest I remember clear as day, this part I dont remember as well.

Anyway at the time we figured it was just some incredibly unfortunately disfigured children, 2 no less with similar features, being taken care of by someone local. The second experience, where the girl was completely still and alone on a lawn, directly after we talked about her was creepier though it only took place like 100-200 yards (300-600 feet) from the original place we saw them so it is in the realm of logic.

I apologize if it seems like I am just being disrespectful to someone with disabilities, but Im here to say I have never again seen anything like it, and they way they were just being "walked" as well as the catatonic state the girl was in the second time I saw them were both really ghastly and strange scenarios. I understand it could have just been an incredibly rare case of someone with something like Elephantitis and maybe mental issues but as a young person having both of those interactions play out, it seemed eerie and in retrospect kind of fits some of the tropes I've seen on here. Both times took place in broad daylight mid day.
