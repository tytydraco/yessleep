**07-24-2021**

I woke up on my back, sunken into my soft bed. Today is Saturday. I didn’t really *need* to get out of bed today… and nor did I want to, but if I hadn’t, I don’t know what would’ve happened. I dragged myself out of bed, got dressed, made myself a cup of coffee, sat on the couch for a little while, made myself look as presentable as possible and put my shoes on. So far, things were as normal and *slow* as any Saturday morning, although that wouldn’t last long. 



I have a bit of a weird habit of peeking through the peephole of my apartment door before I make my way out. I started doing it as a kid when I pretended to be a spec-ops soldier sweeping the apartment. And this morning, I did just that, I peeked through the peephole (while *not* pretending to be a spec-ops soldier) although this time I saw more than just my neighbor’s dark-brown door starkly contrasted by the mint-green walls of the apartment stairwell. My neighbor’s front door was still there, *naturally*, only, it was open. He had left a plastic bag from the drugstore in front of it. Maybe he was leaving and forgot something inside? Had he forgotten the bag while unlocking his door and accidentally not closed it properly? No, that couldn’t have been it, his keys were still in the keyhole. I turned away from the door to call out to my mother, before remembering she had already left for work before I even woke up. 



I stood almost pressed up against the door, hand still gripping the door handle. I began to ponder a little bit about how it would feel to grow up in a household with both parents in the same house, I wondered how I would’ve turned out and so on. Not being in the mood for sentimentality, I shrugged it off and opened the door. I walked out, locked the door behind me and started descending the steps. As the music started blasting in my earphones, my thoughts about my family life were already gone. 



“Hello? Is anybody there? Hello?” - A faint voice grew louder and louder as I gradually turned down the volume of my music. The sound was undoubtedly coming from my neighbor’s open door.



I slowly approached the open door, the man’s voice sounded beaten and exhausted. Was I about to walk in on someone about to have a heart attack? Could my 17 year old self even handle that? My heart began beating faster and faster.



“H-hello? Do you need help?” - I called out, my voice sounding a little more timid than I had hoped it would.



“Yes.” - A weak voice answered.



“Alright uh, I’m coming in.”



It was incredibly well-kept, way more so than my own home even though I lived right next door. Newly renovated floors and walls and everything looked clean and nice. The only colors present were gray and white. Not what I had expected from this guy. As I continued my extremely slow walk through the foyer of his apartment, I could hear the man grunting and moaning as if he was in pain. It was coming from the living room. I stepped into the room, shoes still on, which did make me feel a little bad considering how pristine everything looked. The man was sitting on his knees, feet folded.



“Um… You can’t get up?” - I regretted the stupid question as soon as it had left my mouth.



“No” - The man answered quietly, his gaze wandering around the gray wooden flooring.



He looked embarrassed and annoyed at the same time. He was shaking pretty badly, he tried pushing off of the floor with his knuckles but couldn’t move himself up a single inch. He wasn’t skinny but he wasn’t fat, he wasn’t *that* old either. He was definitely sick. As I approached the man I thought back to my previous interactions with him, just a few months prior he was healthy and lively, it felt weird thinking about just how fast your health can decline.



“Have your legs fallen asleep… sir?” - I asked, trying not to sound like I was mocking him.



“Yeah…” - He responded as he let out another groan in pain.



I scanned my surroundings, looking for anything that could help me get him up from the floor. I knew I wasn’t gonna be able to lift him up to his feet by myself, I’ve been going to the gym for about six months at this point, but haven’t made that much progress mostly because of my bad diet and bad sleeping habits. Could he even stand on his feet if I *did* somehow get him up? As I continued looking around I noticed a black leather armchair standing in the corner of the living room a few feet to my left. I had an idea.



“Um, maybe we could put that armchair behind you and I’ll try lifting you up so you can sit down in it?”



“Yeah… Good idea.”



I dragged it over so it stood behind him, having to struggle an embarrassing amount to do so. I tried lifting him up into the armchair five times, but couldn’t quite get him up far enough on my own. I didn’t want to use all my might, mostly out of fear of dropping him and making it even worse, but also out of fear of my knee caving in again. That ACL injury I sustained last year really did mess me up.



I asked him if we should call an ambulance, to which he answered that he just had some “knee problems” and that it wasn’t necessary. I couldn’t get him up by myself so I told him I’d go ask a neighbor for help. I quickly walked out of the apartment and began walking up the stairs to the third level, I thought about how it definitely wasn’t just his knee. The way he was shaking, how pale he looked and how weak he was; it had to be something else.



“Oh God damn it!” - Is the answer I got when I knocked on my upstairs neighbor’s door.



What an *asshole.* But luckily, there are more doors to knock on. I went down to the first level and knocked on the elderly couple’s door, the Grants. I’ll admit, I *was* a little nervous when I did so. They didn’t like me very much, I’ve lived in this apartment since I was eight years old, to say the least, I’ve caused quite a ruckus *more* than a handful of times over the years. The old lady opened the door and politely asked what I wanted.



“Um, the guy upstairs needs help.”



“What now? I’m sorry dear you’ll have to speak up a little.”



“The guy upstairs needs help… Mr. Wilson.” - I said as I recalled the name on his door.



“Oh? What’s going on?”



“Well he’s sitting on his knees and can’t get up and… I can’t get him up on my own.”



“I’ll be damned, good on you for telling us kid, we’ll be right there.”

  


As she called out for her husband I began walking back up the stairs. As I got closer, I noticed how silent it was. That same anxiety I had felt when I first went in there materialized in my stomach, I feared I was going to walk in only to see him lying limp on the floor. I slowly walked through the foyer once again, taking deep breaths as if I was preparing myself for the worst. As I turned the corner, I felt immense relief. He was still conscious, still struggling.



“Hey uh, the Grants are coming up to help, how’re you holding up?”



“Yeah, I’m fine.”



"Heyy, Ben! You’re lookin’ rough.” - A strong voice erupted behind me, slightly startling me.



“Yep.” - Is all the sickly old man could give for an answer.



“Alright, let’s get you up in that armchair. Kid, you look pretty strong, wanna help?” - I knew he was lying about the part where he said I looked strong but it *was* flattering nonetheless.



“Yeah, yeah of course.”



“Alright kid, on the count of three… one, two, three!”



“Agh, God damn Ben! You’re heavy as stone!” - Mr. Grant said and chuckled, definitely feeling a little embarrassed over the fact that he couldn’t get him up either.



After a couple more tries, we eventually got him up. We talked to Mr. Wilson about how he needs to get help. He mostly shrugged it off as if it wasn’t a big deal but the Grants eventually convinced him. After a few minutes of back and forth, he confessed, it was cancer; brain cancer. Once we made sure he was alright for the time being, I thanked Mr. and Mrs. Grant for their help and walked out shocked. I’ve never been in a situation like this. I felt disappointed over the fact that I couldn’t get him up on my own. Every boy dreams of being a superhero, and I think it never goes away, we just suppress it. I put my headphones back into their case and resumed my daily walk to the local convenience store.



**08/27-2021**

I overslept today, Friday of the second week of school after summer break. Kind of embarrassing but what else would anyone expect from a 17-year old teenage boy? Or maybe that’s just what I tell myself to make myself feel better. I’ll probably oversleep tomorrow too, I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep tonight considering what happened.



After school, me and a few friends walked around downtown, mostly just talking shit and doing what typical 17-year olds do. After a few hours we’d all had enough of walking around in the blazing sun so we all took the bus home since we live in pretty much the same area. Once we arrived at the bus stop, I said goodbye to my friends and we went our separate ways. It was around 7 PM at that point, but still pretty bright outside, perks of living far up in the northern hemisphere I guess. As I got closer to home though, something started feeling… *strange.* It felt like everything was moving slower, like time itself was slowing down, it also felt like there was a certain *echo,* hanging in the air; my footsteps seemed to be “louder”. I guess the closest thing to it would be that feeling you get while walking outside at night during winter while it’s snowing, the snowflakes slowly floating down and blending into the endless sea of white all around you; it’s an eerie feeling.



Just as this feeling I just described was at its peak, I heard a voice call out. Someone was calling for help. As I realized what I was hearing, I got chills while thinking of that incident with my neighbor last month. I stopped to focus on finding out exactly *where* the voice was coming from, it was coming from my right, from an apartment building. I got closer and quickly realized it was coming from a balcony on the first floor which is basically at ground level. The sliding glass doors were open and so was the glass pane door leading into the apartment itself.



“Help! Please, Please Help!”



The voice clearly belonged to an old lady. Another elderly person who couldn’t get up? No, it was way too frantic. What was I about to walk in on? *Should* I even walk in? Was this really any of my business?



“Please! Someone help!”



What was I thinking? There’s no chance it was a break in, nothing like that *happens* around here. I’d help out the old lady and be completely safe, no worries at all. The lights were on but dimmed down, I was still in a little bit of doubt.



“HELP!” 



The voice was so loud it almost made my ears ring, my heart felt like it skipped a beat as a surge of adrenaline coursed through my blood igniting every single muscle fiber in my body. I quickly climbed over the balcony railing and ran inside. I ran around the apartment calling out to whoever needed help, until I stopped in the middle of the living room. It was pitch black and dead quiet but I felt like I could see everything; like I could hear everything.



“Oh God please Oh God please Oh God please Oh God please Oh God please.”



The voice was now lower pitched and *way* too calm, it was guttural and unnatural. Almost like someone… or some-*thing* pretending to be human. The tables had turned, I was now the one in danger. I felt it in my bones, something was about to attack. I frantically snapped my head around looking for a threat, that’s when I saw her. An old, frail lady in a white nightgown. She was sitting in the corner of the living room on her bottom, hugging her knees. Her thin, long gray hair was draped over her face. She was incredibly skinny, she looked as though a slight gust of wind could send her to the next town over. I calmed down, thinking she might’ve been mentally ill. I slowly approached her and knelt down next to her, even though my gut was telling me to do the exact opposite.



“Jonah.”



My name, she knew my name. How was this possible? I sat there frozen, couldn’t talk, couldn’t move.



“They call for help Jonah, they call for help. You have to help them Jonah, you have to help them or they’ll die, they’ll die Jonah, they’ll die.”

“W-what? Who? Who’s gonna die? How do you know my name? Who are you?!”



I finally managed to force myself to speak, my tongue felt like an icicle in my mouth.



“Why didn’t you help me Jonah?”



The voice grew even more disfigured, my heart was pounding in my chest, I could feel my pulse in my ears, I could hear the blood circulating through them. I almost lost my balance, I had been sitting hunched down in a squat for about a minute, as I caught myself with my finger tips, I felt something wet. I looked down to see my fingers soaked in a thick, crimson, coagulated fluid. It was blood. This was the last straw. My body moved on its own, in less than a *second* I was standing up, fully ready to sprint with all my might, no matter what would happen with my knee. 



A stabbing pain, around my achilles tendon. It forced me to cry out in pain as I fell forward onto the floor. I turned to see the old lady, her fingers halfway jabbed into my lower calf. Her face was utterly disfigured and disgusting. Her mouth was gaping to show her unnaturally long, yellow teeth. No one can open their mouth that far, the skin of her cheeks was stretched so thin you could almost see through it. She let out an animalistic growl as her pitch black eyes looked deep into my own. I shifted my body before pulling my uninjured leg back, like a coiled spring. I kicked her in the face as hard as I could, I could feel her nose shatter under the sole of my sneaker. I kicked and kicked until she was completely limp.



I stood up slowly and looked down at her, witnessing the carnage I had caused. I immediately started bawling my eyes out, fearing that, I had hallucinated the whole thing and had just brutally murdered an elderly woman. I was going to end up in juvenile prison, my future was over. I thought about what my mom would think, what dad would think, all of my friends would see me as a ruthless, psychopathic killer; no one would believe me. However, in the middle of my frantic crying, the old lady stood up on all fours and jumped through the living room window, all within barely two seconds, I didn’t even have time to react. Not taking any chances, I ran in the opposite direction, jumped out onto the pavement under the balcony and ran all the way home. I can’t even remember the last time I ran that fast.



When I got home, as soon as I closed the door behind me, it was like my mind went blank. It was as if entering my home somehow caused my brain to restart. I could hear the faint sound of the TV in the living room. I slowly walked into the living room. My mother was there, laying on the couch watching the TV. As she turned her head towards me to welcome me home, the words got stuck in her throat.



“Oh my God! What happened Jonah?!”



I couldn’t even respond, I tried but my lips couldn’t move an inch. My hands, forearms, elbows and knees were all scraped up. I still don’t really know how that happened. The worst part was obviously my leg, it's like I can still feel her stone cold fingers planted into my flesh.



The rest of what happened is kind of a blur, even just a few hours later. My mother took me to the hospital after putting some bandage over my inch-deep stab wounds. We apparently waited for two hours before I would receive any care. The doctor examined me, which I don’t even remember. They patched me up, gave me some painkillers and sent me on my way.



Now back home, I laid down in bed and looked up at the ceiling. The soft, heavy covers didn’t offer a single ounce of comfort. My mind was still empty. As of writing this down, it’s around 2 AM, I can’t sleep, even the thought of *attempting* to sleep sounds completely ludicrous in my mind. Good thing there’s no school tomorrow.
