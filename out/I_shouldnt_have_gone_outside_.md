I don't know if this is the best place for this, but it is very real. It just happened and now I want to leave...


My family is camping this weekend in an rv park beside a lake in central Alberta. Tonight, we found out there was a high chance we would potentially see the northern lights, which felt like such an exciting bonus for us.


After getting the kids to bed in the trailer, the plan was to sit outside by the fire, and wait for a light show with my husband, but he called it an early night, so I decided to scan the sky through my trailer window since 
 I don't love the dark, especially not while I'm alone (or hopefully alone).


I noticed faint signs of the lights starting, and debated just getting photos from the window, but I knew I would get far better ones outside, facing a more clear direction, so I rushed outside and decided I would just swallow that fear for something so worth it. I could easily justify it. Lots of other campers are in nearby lots, it's a gated rv park which doesn't allow vehicle entry after 10pm, and it's mostly just other families like mine keeping to themselves, so I didn't let myself get in my own way for once. I figured if something did happen, the sound of me screaming my face off would likely wake my husband who would rush out.


The shots were awesome, and although it was nearly pitch black, I didn't feel too scared. I decided to walk closer to the water to attempt a photo of the northern lights reflecting from the sky.


No one else was outside. I felt sad so many people were missing out. I walked passed dimly lit sites and was practically spinning with my phone towards the sky trying to get great shots on my phone camera set to night mode so I could actually see something. As I got closer to the boat launch area, something suddenly felt off. I noticed a dark figure? Or I remember thinking maybe it was a weird bush or even sign. It was pitch black and it looked like it could be anything with barely any light to reflect off of it. 


I decided to get a photo of it since on night mode, it would appear much brighter, and I'd have a better chance of figuring it out, but I was too afraid to look. I felt like I knew I wasn't going to like what I saw, and figured o would look once back inside the trailer instead. 


Just as I was about to blurt out "We've got the best spot to watch, huh", or something similar to determine if the figure was a person, or an inanimate object, something in me said no. 


I thought to myself "Back away and pretend you are alone" (I was alone?), and "get back to the trailer, now!". 


My heart was racing, and honestly, it still is, but I quickly got myself back and slammed the door shut behind me, then ran to the bedroom and slammed the pull down blinds down really fast. 


I figured I was getting myself worked up for nothing, and flipped through the photos hoping my heart would return to a regular pace, but it didn't. Just off the the far right side of the last photo I took was something I don't even have a name for, I just know it was looking at me, and it wasn't right.


I am terrified and I don't know what will happen if I stay, make too much noise, go, or remain silent until the sun rises again.
