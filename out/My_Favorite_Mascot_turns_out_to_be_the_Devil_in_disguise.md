Runky the Clown…

 Oh where do I even start?

 That demon tried to kill me 3 times and has killed my family… and took my daughter.. I gained Phasmaphobia and even paranoia... I still see him in my sleep.

Runky the clown is a man wearing black and white makeup for a clown like appearance and he also likes to make kids happy and gives them animal style like balloons and he gives adults candy but… 

do not be fooled.. 

as runky the clown was my favourite character but…

 in 1997 I went to my parents and asked them if we can go to Runky World to which they said no multiple times until finally.. they gave in..

 I was jumping with joy and went to runky world with my parents and older sister… 

then my sister went to talk with other people and go on rides and I decided to go meet the friends of Runky but… when I got to Runky he felt off.. 

as his teeth were way sharper and he just held two children with one arm holding one and other holding a fat one, It was weird but never questioned it so I decided to go to him but as soon as I hugged him… 

he smelled weird.. like.. human blood..

 but I was a kid, I didn’t understand or care.. 

Well I should’ve.. 

then Runky took me to a place where the other kids were sitting and I was happy and Runky made jokes, made ballon’s and sang songs.. until.. 

Runky told us to go to a place where no one ever went to..

 I remember vaguely one time I went with him with the other kids…

 I was the only one that escaped that hellhole… 

The first kid was beheaded and was put in a pole and I mean he was violently shoved inside of the small pole hole and one kid was tied to a chair and runky took a chainsaw and split him in half vertically. he also manipulated another kid and put a rod and a thing from drum when u hit it makes a "BANG" noise and the kids head was then put in half, needless to say his brain was demolished and runky ate the brain whole. The final kid was having the worst thing ever..

 he was dragged into a dark place with other people and they chanted about Boreal and then… 

I saw a figurine that was seven feet tall and looked very skeletal, it has a red melted face and it stabbed the last kid and sent him straight into a pit of hell… 

then when I went in I got a gun and shot Runky 7 times and somehow he made an illusion of security and safeness…

as I saw him dead I ran but then.. 

he got up and he roared as loud as possible and ran towards me.

I went and opened the door to the light and Runky backed away..

 I looked back and he smiled widely and closed the door forever… 

It’s been nearly 30 years and no one is believing me… not even the police or my neighbors..

I went to therapy and yet I still see him.. Waiting for the Right time to kill me...

Have I gone Insane? What should I do?
