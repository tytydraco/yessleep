The silence here is not empty; it is heavy, viscous, broken only by a faint rustle... the rattling of chains dragged slowly through the darkness like a viper coiling to strike. Suddenly, the iron groans—a violent, wrenching sound, as if something is attempting to uproot the entire wall.

Though her body has not left this spot, and despite her absolute lack of need for food or hygiene, the room was becoming saturated with a stench beyond human endurance: a suffocating mix of rancid sulfur and living, decomposing flesh. The spray of pus erupting from her mouth made the floor sticky, reflecting a meager light, as if the air itself had to pass through a filter of filth before daring to enter my lungs.

She is oblivious to place and time, yet her broken record never stops: "Hello, dear... your mother is sick, the iron is eating the flesh of my hand. Does this please you? Does it please you to see your mother wailing? I am not a monster... I am only sick."

Words she regurgitates from the bottom of a bottomless well, spoken in a tone I know all too well, though I know for a certainty that she died long ago. The thing lurking there is not her... it is "It."

My hand tightened around the sledgehammer—not out of fear, but resistance. That voice knows how to exhume the graves inside my chest; it knows how to press down on the open wound of my "humanity." It wants me to hesitate, to soften, so it might find a crack to escape through.

I will not grant it that pleasure.

I will silence her tonight... just as I did yesterday, and as I will do tomorrow when this cursed body reconstructs itself to torment me once more. My knuckles whitened against the wooden handle, now slick with my sweat and the room’s chill. She—or It—realized what was coming.

In the blink of an eye, the mask of the sick mother fell.

The voice shifted; it became coarse, a guttural roar, vomiting foul obscenities at me and the woman whose skin it wore. Its words were poisoned arrows, driving me toward the edge... or perhaps, inviting the blow. I raised the demolition hammer high. And I swung.

The sound of the skull shattering drowned out everything—a muffled thud that exploded inside my own head, not in the room.

She gasped... one final gasp carrying pure human sorrow, as if the blow had liberated a shard of my true mother’s soul for a single moment before it vanished. The head, matted with filthy yellow hair, slumped and hit the floor with utter helplessness.

I cried.

I could not stop myself. I pressed my rough palm against my face and bowed. My muffled sobs echoed back from the damp walls, as if the room itself were mocking my recurring weakness. What a torment it is... for your heart to beat with mercy for a monster, simply because it wears a face you love.

I left the body lifeless.

The blood began to evaporate the moment it touched the cold air, rising as a warm mist that smelled of rusted iron. As the mist thickened, the place transformed into a suffocating slaughterhouse. I pinched my nose and staggered against the wall, but the stench had already colonized my throat. I rushed to the bathroom and retched everything inside me... it was nothing but sour, burning, transparent bile. I threw the tap open frantically, drenching the floor to wash away the remnants of blood and pus from the tiles, watching the murky liquid swirl into the drain. But the smell remained stuck—in my pores, in my hair, and in the corridors of my memory.

I stepped out and locked the door firmly. I pushed once, then twice, to be sure. Things behind this door cannot be trusted, even when they are dead.

Outside, the polluted city air felt pure compared to what I had just inhaled. The cats greeted me at the garage as usual, rubbing their bodies against my legs and meowing in a harmony that briefly silenced the noise from the basement. I ran my hand over their warm fur, searching for a touch of innocent life to scrub away the grime of death.

But... something was wrong in the middle of the street.

A black smudge broke the monotony of the scene. I approached. It was a small kitten; its body was still warm, but its head... its head was gone. It was completely pulverized, as if a giant hammer had leveled it with the asphalt. This was no roadkill accident; it was an execution.

I picked up the tiny body, feeling the chill of death seep into my palm. I buried it in a shallow, hurried grave and leveled the earth with my boot.

I pulled the radio from my pocket, raised the metal antenna, and brought it to my lips, my eyes scanning the street with suspicion. "Hassan, do you copy? We have a breach... I believe it's a Type E."

Silence.

No static, no sound of breathing. Just an absolute, crushing silence. I repeated the call, my voice sharper this time. No response. Suddenly, I noticed something that made the blood freeze in my veins. I looked around... the cats were gone. The cats that were rubbing against my legs seconds ago had vanished as if they had never existed. The street was void of everything but me.

I lowered the radio slowly as the terrifying truth settled in. This is not a Type E breach. It appears we are facing Type S. I turned back toward the house, a cold certainty crawling down my spine: The breach... is not in the neighborhood. The breach is here, with me.

I returned to the house, sensing the breach was near. I closed the door softly.
