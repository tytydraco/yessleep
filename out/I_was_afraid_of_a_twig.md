Back in the fall of last year me and 1/3 of my family, my sister, my mom, and I went down to the park in the area where my other sister works. I went to fish in the river/creek (as there were both at the park) and my mom and sister went to bike the road inside the park. The park was very green because fall weather had not set in at all. We walked across a bridge and parted ways where the bike path parted with a trail that went out onto a peninsula of sorts you could fish off of

Mom told me “you've got maybe an hour-ish then meet us at your sisters job”

I nodded then went down the path that entered into the mass of land jutting into the river.

I trekked through the little forest on the peninsula making it to a freshwater beach. Walking over and around driftwood on the sand I was thinking about muay thai as I had been taking that and jiu jitsu for two years now (important for later). I made it to the spot at the very tip where there were tons of fish swimming in the harsh waters because it rained the night before. I then fished for an hour and fifteen minutes not catching any fish even though there were obviously a ton right off the bank. Then I saw a kid about 12-14 in a light grey tracksuit without stripes and wearing glasses and on the phone.



I was packing up my gear when the kid came up to me and started talking to me like he knew me. I also noticed he was so thin a swift breeze could blow him over, he was 5’1” and must've weighed 90 pounds and I never saw his face. He said he was exploring for a few hours and had to leave soon. Then he said something odd, “do you think i could walk on the river?”. It was a weird question, I didn't think much of it as he could have misspoke. I replied with “no, the water is too harsh and it would be dumb, so don’t”. The kid then said “it would be fun to walk out on the top huh?” another odd question, he then ran off into the trees before I could reply. I couldn't see him at all in my peripherals anymore and an immense sense of impending doom had come over me and fear of the child. Me walking around 180 at the time I could have easily kicked his ass but, I was having animalistic fear the kind of adrenaline pump fear you would get in a home invasion. I waited a good while so he would be far ahead. I then bolted to the treeline from the beach and started retracing the path taken to get in and then I saw the kid to the right on a separate path also seemingly taking a path out. He got engulfed in the bushes and I could no longer see him. Then as fast as he vanished he reappeared on a different path to the right. He must have moved so fast it would have broken the sound barrier.



I kept seeing him left and right all over only ahead of me by 50 feet. I was terrified for no reason seeing as I was trained and 6-7 weight classes above him. I thought I had made some headway thinking he was in my dust and started to see more and more people trickling around and I was no longer afraid. I felt normal, in perfect spirit, and as I walked to the bridge that met with the other path I felt a sense of dread creep back in noticing no one being there. Then I saw him, he was ahead of me by a bit the kid that made me feel like I was near a demon. I kept trying to stay far behind then he slowed down so much I was right up his butt. I couldn't pass him nor could I stay behind far enough to feel ok. Then he started to go right across the train tracks where I had to go to get to my sis’s job so I went left to a little pavilion that housed a piano. I sat on the bar stool for the piano watching from behind the piano where he was going. He went towards the building my sister worked at. Then I waited for a bit contemplating the strange way I felt.
