Walking along merryweather was a routine practice for me, Every afternoon I would walk along the sandy banks admiring the calm stillness of the water and the peace the wind brought me. I love collecting sea shells matter of fact I love it so much I have a display cabinet dedicated to the coolest ones I have found. I was walking along the rock pools as usual when I noticed an orange and white shell resting on the crest of one of the pools. The first thing I noticed was that it was perfectly intact not very common for a shell of this size. Normally there would be a hole or a crack but this one was special. 

  
I picked it up carefully looking to investigate, Upon closer observation you could tell this shell was truely something remarkable, Unoticable to the eye at first I noticed speckles of pink and purple cascading with the orange creating a beautiful clash of colour almost replicating that of the night sky. I flipped it over to look at the bottom, A shell this size usually always contains a hermit crab and I wanted to greet the little guy before leaving him back to his ways. 

To my surprise it was empty, I was excited to have scored another sick shell for my collection and so I gently put it in my pocket and continued my walk.

Fast forward to when Im back. I've placed the shell in my cabinet, I noticed the shell has an odd smell to it, Very fishy, I chalked it up exclusively to the fact It had rested by that rock pool for god knows how long and so I thought nothing of it.

  
I wake up the next morning to chaos, The entire cabinet full of shells had collapsed sometime throughout the night and so naturally I tried to scavenge all the intact shells that I could, I could identify the shells that had broke and I noticed I was missing the orange and white shell I had picked up the night before.

Im a firm believer in the unknown and spiritualism so It didnt take me long to connect some sort of dots with this shell, It could've been a coincidence sure but I liked the idea that this mystery shell contained some sort of power, I dwelled on the topic for the day and my final conclusion was that the cabinet had given out at some point and I was just fooling myself with childish Ideas.

  
I woke up that night at 2:19 am. I could hear something, It sounded like waves crashing and people speaking, I got up thinking I had left my tv or phone on but I couldn't locate the source. Confused I went back to bed hoping it was just my neighbors.

When I finally got up at the brisk hours of the morning I looked to my nightstand and to my bewilderment the shell was placed neatly in the center. The first thing that I clocked was that I did not place the shell on my nightstand. I said "fuck this" and grabbed the shell and took a 10 minute drive to merryweather to throw the shell into the water and to forget this weird event that had happened. 

now you probably think that It's going to be some cliche, I go home and the shell is magically back but funny enough I forgot about this after the following weeks, months and eventually 4 or 5 years passed. I finished my degree and met the woman of my dreams and so we moved away to the far beaches of queensland, We were both big beach people, There is simply not much that can beat sitting on the dunes and enjoying the peace.

  
So imagine my shock when we were walking along the beaches one afternoon near the rock pools and I noticed something. It was a shape I recognised it was almost like deja vu actually It felt exactly like it did when I originally crossed paths with the shell, It rested on the crest of another rock pool patiently waiting for someone eager enough to pick it up. and this time it was my wife.

  
I didn't draw attention to the shell, I tried to detour away from it as I could clearly recognise it to be the exact same shell, Same purple, orange and pink lines, Same shape and size.

  
My wife never noticed it or so I thought but when we got home she said she had a surprise for me and pulled it out of her purse. I tried not to react negatively, She had no idea I crossed paths with this shell before and I didn't want her to think I was some schizo.

  
She put it up as a  
 sort of center piece for our shared collection in our room. I was uncomfortable but I began second guessing myself, Maybe I did place the shell on my nightstand and I had forgotten? Maybe I was just forgetful when I was younger. 

  
The day went on as usual, We ate had a drink or 2 and then went to bed.

3:20am

  
"babe, babe... Wake up... babe.."

I was shooken awake by my wife who seemed a bit panicked

"eh.... whats wrong... baby?"

My wife was frozen in place upright looking to the cabinet, I already knew what this was about.

"I.. can hear my mothers voice coming from somewhere... It sounds like-"

**"SHHHHHH"**

Clear as day from the shell. We both looked at eachother, I was scared but she seemed more entranced, She got up and went closer to try and adjust her hearing, Faintly you could hear a womans voice saying something but neither of us could discern it. 

She finally traced it to the shell, She picked it up and looked at it, I noticed her body was shaking.

I pointed it out and said "baby whats wrong" trying to push past the impossibility and all around supernatural nature of the situation.

My wife is a secretive woman, She hails from vanuatu and I really don't know much about her past or her family, We met at university while she was in DOCS care, She always told me her family disowned her over some sort of cultural thing but she never dwelled on the topic.

"baby..."

"whats wrong?"

**"My mother died when I was 14."**

Immediately upon hearing this I got up to comfort her, I pryed the shell from her grip, She was holding it surprisingly tight. I could now get a better ear range of what was being said, It was less discernable now as if the woman she claimed to be her mothers voice was moving away further then we could catch up.

"what should we do with it" 

She asked.

"I don't know should we... get rid of it?"

"I don't want to do that.."

my wife replied, She was holding back tears.

I told her to put it down and I would move it somewhere else as to not disturb our sleep.

She hugged me and layed back down in bed clearly distraught. I went down stairs placing the shell on a shelf tucked away with candles and other trinkets. I took a minute to really investigate while she was upstairs, I put the shell to my ear and listened intently awaiting something to speak but it never came. I sighed thinking we were undergoing carbon monoxide poisoning or something, I decided I was going to get our house inspected for a variety of things that could cause this type of delirium.

I mean the whole improbability of it all, Where would the voice come from? The only logic I could find was that someone had placed a voice recorded onto a playback into the shell but how did we find it twice? How is it my wifes mothers voice?

I finally went upstairs and said to my wife "Somethings wrong I don't think It's the shell."

She didn't reply simply sighing and falling asleep.

  
6th of december 2023

the next morning after the incident was a solem one, My wife was clearly moved from this experience hearing her mothers voice come from a fucking seashell, I had inspectors come to check for mold and I had our monoxide detectors inspected and changed. Nothing.

Now that the excuse of deliria was out of question what could it have been? I was still very firm that this wasn't anything supernatural, When you hear supernatural you attribute it to ghosts, ghouls, cryptids etc; this was nothing like I had heard of or seen before.

My wife came up to me at sometime during the afternoon asking to go for a walk, She had a stressful day at work and so did I so I was more then happy to oblige.

We set off to the beaches ready to relax and unwind, The past events seemed almost forgotten until we reached the rock pools once more.

Another shell sat perfect in the crest of this rock pool, This time it was a blue and green almost iradescent shade, We looked at eachother and ignored it, On our way back we saw a mother and her kids pick up the shell to investigate, The youngest put the shell up to his ear and in an instant he threw the shell not out of rage but out of fear, He began crying running to his mother.

We didn't need to investigate any further, This was real.

I finally opened up to my wife about my past experience explaining how I didn't want to come off as deluded but she understood me quite well and resonated with me.

"we must throw it away" she said   
I briskly agreed and so we set off to the peaks and lookouts to find a suitable place for the departure of the shell.

On the way there my wife put the shell up to her ear. I noticed once she started she did not stop and I swear I could hear voices coming from it once more. I asked her what she was hearing and she briskly replied 

"nothing.. nothing Just listening to the ocean"

Had I not tried to listen beforehand understanding that this thing choicefully speaks I would not have believed her but alas I let it go, After all It had her mothers voice tied to it.

I also noticed that she didn't stop listening once she had started the whole hour drive. Constant listening, I let her have the moment choosing not to disrupt. Finally she spoke up.

"It's saying your name.."

"What?"

"It's saying your name.... Daniel.."

I felt on edge but more relieved that we were getting rid of it once and for all.

We finally reached the peak Blackstone summit. 

  
6:48pm

  
My wife looked over to the crashing waves and immense rock formations that littered the landscape below, The concaving cliffs and fading sun that created a solemn vibe. She listened to the shell more.

She jolted away suddenly looking panicked.

"It's screaming.."

I finally decided to interject until... I heard it too.

Clear as day the screams of a 1000 men and women erupted from the sea shell. My ears vibrated so tenaciously I felt my jaw began to lock and my throat begin to swell. My wife covered her ears too. I looked to her as she began crying.

**"I love you honey... I love you so much... Im sorry..."**

The seemingly now sentient shell erupted almost joyfully, It was presumably my wifes mothers voice. 

I wish so bad I could hear what was said next but I passed out, The screams were tangent with the voice almost like a fucked up opera of impossibility.

I woke up to the sea shell next to me. 

My wife was never found she is missing to this day, I was actually facing jail until I went intensive psychological evaluation and they found I was likely innocent, I was shattered and in grief.

that was 10 years ago.

  
Today I was walking the sands of Perth when I heard something.

"daniel!"

"daniel!"

I tensed immediately feeling my eyes begin to water. It was my wifes voice. I ran to the source briskly trying to find her. I searched and searched and searched until I was led to the pools... And there, Sat neatly and perfectly. Was a white and orange seashell calling my name.
