Hi everyone!

Quick question: what is your very first memory?

Not something that’s only in your head because your relatives told you it happened, neither a vague flash of a childhood event, nor a strong feeling you can’t quite place in the timeline of your life.

My family says that, when I was very little, I imagined myself a friend that I called my brother. It was an older-brother fantasy, which my therapist later told me is very rare in two-year-olds.

The thing is, I’ve forgotten almost everything about this imaginary friend I supposedly had. I believe my parents when they recall me speaking to someone who wasn’t there, because I strongly feel that what they’re saying is true. I just can’t dive deep enough into my memory to bring his image back.

No. I am asking for a full, structured memory of your own—a conscious observation, existing in your mind independently of what others have told you.

My name is Ann, by the way, and the reason I’m asking is that I’ve been taking some extra English classes in creative writing. Recently, I got an assignment to write a story based on a personal experience.

I’m also taking part in a mentorship program at my high school, and after reading the story you’re about to see, my mentor talked me into sharing it online. He tried to justify it with some coaching nonsense, but I think he’s just one of those guys who enjoy seeing people’s reactions to this kind of thing.

If you are reading this Mr. Klein—yeah, me too. Thank you. You da best.

I chose to write about my first memory, which is also one of my most traumatic experiences. So posting it here felt like a no-brainer.

Just to clarify: yes, I wrote this for a course to get some measly college credits. However, in the story I am staying true to my recollection of events, no matter how batshit crazy they are. That’s probably why I got such a high score on this assignment—for batshit parts, not honesty. But that’s cool—being wacko finally paid off.

Back on track: after thinking about it for some time—taking trips down the memory lane—I’ve come to the conclusion that in my mind there is nothing from before that event, and nothing so certain and of such vividness for years after.

The rest of my earliest childhood is all flashes, pinpoints, fragments I am aware are either warped by insomnia or filtered through my later interpretations. But this one memory replays in my head without cuts, loose ends or blurs, sharp and full, filled with colors, depth, voices and feelings. Like a tape playing on a TV in a dark room of my consciousness, it loops endlessly, showing the same scene and I am watching it with the fixation of a child.

I’m burying myself in exposition here. Okay—here goes nothing. Don’t judge me.

I was two and a half years old.

 

My very first memory is from kindergarten. To those who might be confused about what a two-year-old is doing in a kindergarten—in my country, kindergarten can start at the age of three, but in special cases, when a child is deemed ready by their parents and they receive approval from the kindergarten director, they can start as early as two and a half. And, if the director is also your aunt, like in my case—two years old will do just fine.

I remember a boy next to whom I was taking an after-lunch nap. What happened made me avoid naps—to say the least, I became gravely afraid of sleeping. It was so bad, that I was even diagnosed with childhood insomnia. Thank god I got better before I went to high school.

Except for occasional nightmares, my sleep is normal now—though I suppose having nightmares from time to time is nothing strange, right? I just wish mine had a little variety instead of being the same recurring one.

It was my first year of kindergarten, and as my mother told me in therapy, I had been in the same group with that boy for about five months before that day. I truly have no memories of him before that event.

His name was Jack – that’s all I can remember.

I can’t recall what toys he liked, whether I ever played with him, or his nickname (we all had silly nicknames given to us by our educators; mine was “Egg” because my surname sounds like “egg” in my native language).

I’ve been told it’s very unusual for children that young to form lasting memories, but right now, when I am sitting cross-legged in my bed in a dark room, if I were to close my eyes and go back, I can trace my finger across the intersections on the worn-out children’s carpet of my kindergarten classroom. I can feel the material of those little blue cots they would laid out in rows for us during after-lunch naps, chipped edges of wooden blocks, plastic oversized puzzle pieces. Can even taste them too. I can hear the voices of our guardians and my, back then, young parents. I can feel the warmth of the sun on that winter day on my face.

I can see his grey eyes gazing straight into mine—and his bloodied smile.

It was a smile of great relief: chin up, subtle. People smile that way when they feel calm having achieved an excruciating goal–the catharsis smile.

Jack must have been my age or a year older. I think the missing posters said three but I am not sure.

Oh man, I get shivers just writing this down. I have never shared it online, but as Mr. Klein said, maybe doing so will help me—paradoxically—forget it, leave it behind for good.

You see, I have rationalized the events of this memory in a million different ways. I won’t do it here. I want to read your thoughts on what I am about to say and I will present it unfiltered.

So, this is how it pretty much went down.

 

Opening scene: two-and-a-half-year-old me is sitting on a tiny chair, frowning, arms crossed, head down.

“Eat up, darling! Chop! Chop!” said Mrs. Eva, the kindergarten cook and caretaker.

Her voice was like sandpaper—her vocal cords damaged and stripped from years of smoking—but it fit her personality well, as she was a really bitter curmudgeon of an old woman. Everyone had an apprehensive attitude toward her, educators included.

She was scrutinizing me and my plastic plate. On it—three brussels sprouts, slightly charred yet soggy, unseasoned tiny green brains. Oh, the trauma.

Was I a regular child when it came to an absolute disgust for brussels sprouts? Yes.

“One for your mommy, to her health. Come on darling. You want mommy to stay healthy?” She lifts the fork with the impaled brussels sprout to my mouth. I, reluctantly, swallow it whole, to avoid feeling the texture and to keep the brussels sprout juices from squirting out.

“Hey! Use your teeth or you’ll choke, stupid! Do I really have to serve everything to you as a puree? Them are soft, but you need to chew. If you don’t eat properly and choke, you’ll make your mama sick and sad. Chew well if you care for your mom’s health. Now, one more for your daddy—a toast to his health, to make him strong. Be a gooood egg. Come on!”

I dodged a fork coming at me to force-feed me my vegies. The other kids at the table—the eight of us sitting around it—were all trying to look invisible to Mrs. Eva. Except for Jack. He was drawing something with crayons, tongue-out, without a care in the world.

“Dammit girl eat!” She grabbed my chin. “Or I’ll put you in timeout!”

So I ate. And I chewed, looking at Jack angrily, because he didn’t have to. He had also left them—heck, everybody left them—because the sprouts were simply inedible.

“And the last one, little last delicious one. To your brother’s health.”

I am of the strong opinion it was overall unhealthy for me when she indulged my “brother fantasy”, but it helped. He appeared behind me, holding my shoulder and encouraging me to eat.

When I say I remember the whole thing I mean that everything in that memory is so clear and vivid, yes, but my brother’s voice is just static noise, like ocean waves.

After I finished, she hobbled over to another girl and started forcing her to eat her leftovers. She didn’t bother any of the boys—she didn’t even look at Jack’s half-eaten, messy plate. He was too busy drawing stick figures to eat.

After lunch, we were told to use the bathroom, even if we didn’t feel like it, brush our teeth, get changed into pajamas, and lie down on cots with the blanket on. I was so proud that I was one of the few who didn’t need help with any of that. Every time I did all of that by myself I got an animal sticker to put on my classroom shelf.

Jack’s shelf was almost empty of animal stickers, except the ones I gave him and the ones he got for encouragement.

His cot was right next to mine. Mrs. Eva rolled down the window blinds. The classroom got darker, but everything was still visible just fine.

I was laying down calmly—neither tossing nor turning, nor attempting to play with toys under the blanket like Jack. Zero-problem child, I was.

I felt my eyes getting heavier. It was so easy to fall asleep back then. How could I have known that this was the last time I would sleep like a child. I was dozing off.

Suddenly, he lets out the deepest gasp and starts yelling at the top of his lungs, ecstatic:   
  
“O my God, yes! O my God, it worked! Am I really here!?”

That scared me so much I almost jumped out of my cot. I turned my head, and he was sitting down—looking at his shaking hands, then glancing around. He saw me staring at him. He smiled. The biggest fucking grin on his face.

He opened his mouth to say something but immediately stopped. Just like that, his lips dropped, his eyes widened, and his face turned pale. He was gravely terrified.

“Noo!” He screeched! “Why would I do that to mysel —”

He held his head between his hands and then it flung backwards with great force. His body hit the carpet so hard it bounced. He immediately tried to get on his knees. He was crying.

“No! God! Please! Get out! Go back! Please make it stop. I am not going to loop again! I am not going to loop again! Why did I loop again? Why? Why? Why?” He kept repeating it endlessly, wheezing through nose discharge, mucus and tears. His voice dimming as he ran out of air. “Why? Why? Why?...”

His countenance shifted. He was smiling again. Then terror returned to his face. He flung backward again, and again immediately tried getting up. The whole thing repeated over and over, the same every time, until he was almost against the yellow wall.

I clawed at the blanket like I was holding it for my life, as if it were a barrier shielding me from him. I was petrified, but he wasn’t stopping. After what felt like an eternity, I mustered all the courage to peak from under the blanket and beg him, “Jack, please don’t.”

He simply would not stop repeating, “Why? Why? Why?”

I remember my feet being stone cold and my bladder screaming for a relief when I finally got up. I was sobbing.

Then he arched his back like a string about to break, only for his whole body to go completely limp shortly after. He dropped motionless.

I booked it to Mrs. Eva. I clutched her apron, burying my face deep in her long skirt.

I don’t know how much time had passed. Everything was so quiet. She wasn’t moving.

When I finally stepped back, leaving wet markings on her flowery apron, I saw she was completely still. Not only her—everybody in the class was stock-still. No one was blinking, not even breathing, frozen in place. All.

Except Jack.

He got up, his legs uneasy. He had soiled himself, and a wet patch was growing on his pajama pants. Blood poured from his nose. His cheeks shone with tears. His facial expression was absent, his gray stare vacant, when he calmly said:

“I don’t blame you for what happened. I know, in reality, you had no say in this. It was a cosmic-sized accident—absolutely outside human scale—that we got pulled into,” he wasn’t talking to me.

“Jack, I love you.” said my imaginary brother. He was standing at the door. I remember only his silhouette—and that… he looked so terribly sad.

The bloodied kid turned to face my so-called brother.

“I love you too,” he said, walking toward the figment of my imagination. “I hope they teach you how to forgive me for what I am about to do.”

“Wait. How did you set the arch?” But Jack touched my imaginary brother with the tip of his finger, making him instantaneously disappear forever. After that moment, he never appeared to me again. The brother fantasy had simply ceased.

“Excuse me, Annie. I’m happy to see you moving, and since you are able to respond, could I borrow your spare trousers?” he asked me, wearing that damned cathartic smile, blood dripping from his chin. Without looking, he stepped over the other kids, still lying motionless, marshalled in rows. I looked at Mrs. Eva with hope, but she had the same expression as before and hadn’t moved an inch. I was not able to respond.

“I’ve made a mess of myself.” He took my sweatpants from a colorful shelf with my name and animal stickers on it. He grabbed a clean shirt from someone else’s. “It gets worse every time I go back.”

He entered the bathroom casually.

The world around me was still while my whole body shivered. Even though I could move I didn’t have the courage to muster a scream in this dead silence.

He came back clean, holding his dirty pajamas under his arm.

“I deeply apologize Annie. You have caring parents. They will find you a good therapist. I am sure of it. See you around, little egg,” he said strolling out of the classroom. That day, I learned the words “cosmic”, “development” and “therapist”.

I watched Jack disappearing behind the door, walking through the spot where my imaginary brother had stood. After a while, Mrs. Eva screamed.

“AAA!”

All the startled kids got up.

“Don’t sneak up on me like that, Annie! You scared me!” she said. “What is this? Did you have a nightmare? It’s okay, go back to your cot.” She tucked me back onto the cot. I was unable to speak.

“Did Jack go to the bathroom again? My goodness, you are all supposed to sleep. So sleep! I told him to use it before nap-time! That oafish child.” she stopped. “What are all those stains?”

She hurried to get him from the bathroom, but of course, he wasn’t there.

“Jack? Jacky boy, what are you doing in there? What happened?”. The sound of her opening all the tiny bathroom stalls.

That’s where my memory ends.

 

I remember talking to anxious Mrs. Eva, to my aunt, the kindergarten director, to my parents, and a kind police lady. They were flooding me with questions about Jack.

The boy was declared missing the same day. I saw his picture on TV and on posters glued to poles on the whole way from home to kindergarten. There was a country-wide search that never led to any findings. My aunt and Mrs. Eva lost their jobs. Cameras were installed in the kindergarten.

The talks with questions repeated for some time. I remember them very vaguely. At kindergarten, in the presence of my parents, staff, and police, I was asked to reenact what happened. I imagine they did it with a child psychiatrist and spoke to me appropriately, but I don’t remember.

I do remember that they never believed me. Jack’s parents got in a fight with mine, because they called me—a two-and-a-half-year-old—a compulsive liar.

I was taken to a building I had never been to before. My parents didn’t see the effect of my therapy there, so I was taken to a different, nicer building.

The following years are blurry. I couldn’t sleep. I was tired all the time. I had regular nightmares about Jack, about what happened.

Over time, it got better. A child’s mind is very flexible.

Was this really what happened? It is all there in my head, but it is so bizarre that even I am not sure anymore. I must have missed something, but I don’t know what. This memory doesn’t feel like a memory of child Ann—a child that no longer exists. It feels mine, adult. I will never forget it.
