“Hello? I-is this thing on? I hope it is. I-I’m Mark, I’m from southern Washington and I’m currently on a tour with a couple friends in Yachats. Well, I was at least. They sort of left me here. My phones broken, I-I don’t think I can fix it. B-but maybe I’ll get someone to help me. This cave is really dark, and I can barely see. I-I’ve got my audio recorder, that’s what you're on right now. I’ve also got my camera, it’s really old though. On the bright side, the camera’s flash will provide light ever so often. I’ll figure out something, hopefully. I-I think that’s all for now. I’ll hopefully talk to you soon.”

“H-Hello? I’m gonna save these under log numbers, so this is Log number two. A-anyways, um. I started moving again, the cave is really dark, but my camera’s doing well so far. I don’t have film in it right now, but I have a few packs on me. Maybe that could be useful if I find something…But yeah, nothing really interesting yet. It’s really damp in here, I guess that’s expected with the ocean nearby. My shoes are uh, a bit wet, and sleeping is really difficult in the layer of water that sits here. But I think I’ll manage alright, just gotta wait for rescue. You know? Oh, what am I kidding. The only chance I've found of escape was blocked off by that cave in. I’m quite lucky that I’m unscathed. A-anyway, I’ll be signing off again.”

“L-Log three, I’ve heard some noises recently. Little taps and such. At first I thought it was just water from how damp they are, but it’s not the same. It just feels off, something isn’t right. But I’m not the best person to decide that I guess. So, I’ll just hope that, if someone, or something is in here with me, it’ll be friendly. I wouldn’t like to spend some time with something that wants to kill me. Well, on the brightside they can’t call me cowardly Mark anymore. Haha… If they see me that is. Anyway, not much to talk about this time other than those noises. I’ll be signing off again.”

“Log four, I’m getting better at this. There’s mushrooms around here, and the water isn’t as salty. It’s nowhere near healthy but it’s something. I’ve been hearing those noises still, they’re getting a bit louder. Maybe I’m near the source? I’m not really sure… I’m starting to feel a bit better about my situation. Hopefully if I die, it’ll be in a peaceful place. This isn’t the worst thing that could happen to me. I think I’ll sign off, I need to try to sleep.”

“Log five. I’ve got a headache, it’s nothing bad but it’s noticeable. I’m surprised my diet hasn’t killed me, or the lack of heat in this cave. It seems to go on forever here…As I was saying…What was I saying? That’s…Strange. I can’t remember. Anyway, my camera’s almost dead. Hopefully I can find something to charge it with…Hahaha…I’m only joking, there’s no batteries in a cave. I’m signing off tonight, I feel quite tired.”  

“Log six…I uh, got some stuff uhh. Those noises…I think they’re louder. I can’t really tell. It’s something, I’m finally in the dark here, using the caves walls to find my way around…I think I’ve been seeing…W-What was I talking about? Oh, those mushrooms have finally started to taste better. Maybe I can survive long enough for me to be pulled out. I…I’m gonna…Go to sleep.”

“Log seven. I’ve been pulled out of my daze long enough to give a partial story, hopefully this warning gets out to people. There’s a creature in here. It’s big and fast, and I think it’s doing something with my head. These mushrooms ar-

I… What was I on about? I’m not sure anymore. I’m feeling tired again…I’m going to…Going to sleep.”

“Log eight, I think this is my last log guys…I uh, can’t pull myself along further. I feel so tired. There’s a beast here. It’s got milky eyes, and smooth black skin. I could see it with my camera, but that’s not something I have anymore…I… I’m signing off…Mark here, I’m done for now…”

\*Static noise\* “I…n’t…hol…Sor…Lov…Bye…”

That's all we were able to recover of the last message Miss Ludsley. I'm not sure where you found it but with the amount of water damage it sustained, I'm surprised we managed to save any of the recordings." Mr. Greenwell told me, looking surprised as I was at the tape we just listened to."What happened to my son, Mr. Greenwell?" I demanded, I wanted answers, and maybe those friends thrown in prison for leaving him there."I'm not sure Miss Ludsley, but how long did you say he was missing?" He looked at me with some form of pity, but I wasn't ready to accept that. My own son, the glimmer of hope I had at possibly finding him. It was gone."Around 6 months now." I stated, matter of factly. It was like I expected him to know all the answers I needed. Perhaps I was desperate.So, here I am. A grown lady, talking to social media about my discoveries. My son is missing, and by now he's dead. But I'd like to hope he's still out there. He's around 18 now. Tall but skinny, green eyes, red hair. He's almost always in a hoodie and I don't know how he does it. His name is Mark Ludsley, and I beg you. If any of you know where he is, or maybe what cave he's talking about. Let me know, because I miss my baby so much. I guess that's all. Just a mother, looking for her child. I hope I find him, I pray he's not dead, and I'm sorry that it turned out this way for him. I miss you Mark. I hope you're safe and playing a prank on me or something. It'd be something I'd ground you for, but at this point I'll take it over you being dead. I can't lose you. Ara Ludsley, signing off.
