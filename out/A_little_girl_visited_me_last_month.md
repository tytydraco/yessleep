I've never really believed in ghosts. Sure, I was superstitious enough to never even touch a ouji bord and I've never done the bloody mary challenge or anything like that, but still. That was more of a "if" precaution, you know? If they exist, better to not fuck around with them.  
But then she visited.  
It was late, maybe one or two am. I had been mindlessly scrolling on tiktok, trying to stay awake until I knew it was time to sleep or I'd be barebly functional during the day. So I put down my phone and rolled around for a bit. But I couldn't sleep. I had the eery feeling someone was watching me. We all know that gut feeling that makes the hairs on the back of your neck rise? That. A two circulair reflections were barely visible in the corner of the room. I remember thinking that was odd, since that corner was empty and there weren't any light sources. Still, I didn't think much of it, as I knew I was tired and maybe just seeing things.   
After a while, I looked back, still unable to fall asleep, and they were gone. I chalked it up to a car light turning off and rolled on my side. That was when I saw her.

A young girl, maybe eight or nine, sitting on the side of my bed. It wasn't like an actual child was sitting there, like with shadows and all. No, this child didn't have any color or anything. The shadows seemed to warp around nothing. Light reflected from the street light outside highlighted parts of the darkness. I could make out a face, hair and her general shape. I couldn't see if it was a girl, or maybe I don't remember, but I just know she was feminine. She didn't move, didn't breath or anything. Just stared back at me. I wasn't feeling very scared, since she looked pretty ok, not like gaunt or something. And still, it was late, maybe I was dreaming while awake, you know. I looked away for a second because of reasons I don't remember. When I looked back around to the side of my bed, she was gone. That kinda freaked me out. You know when you have a spider in your room, and it's gets worse when it dissapears because you don't know where the fuck it is? That. I turned my head to look at the rest of my bedroom. And there she was. Maybe five centimeters, (two inches) away. All I could see were those big black eyes. Now I could see more details. Choppy hair, freckles, chubby cheeks. Looked a bit like my little sister. Only, my younger sister is eleven and sleeping in the room next to me, not eight and standing by my bed. I couldn't breath. My mouth was dry as bone. The calmth vanished as she kept staring. I blinked. She came closer. My hearth just about stopped. Stretching out my hand to turn on the light was almost impossible. Yet I did it.   
After that, she didn't return. Hasn't returned since, and I doubt she ever will.   
When I asked my family about it, they didn't really reply. It wasn't until today I found out my grandpa's sister, who had lived in this house, had died at the age of eight.
