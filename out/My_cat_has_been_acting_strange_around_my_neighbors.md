The last few weeks have been some of the most frightening and disturbing days of my life. Three years ago,  I adopted a small white kitten from the local animal shelter. His name was Larry and he was a very energetic cat. He would always run off and chase everything he saw. He was a good kitten. 

The reason I talk about him in past-tense is because he is no longer with us. His body was found on a road a few miles away. I got to see his body one last time and turned away immediately in disgust. Let's just say it was not in one piece. I can only hope he went quickly. We cremated his body. This story is not about him. 

A few months ago, I got a new cat from the local animal shelter. The white ones reminded me too much of Larry, so I picked up a black one. His name was Ace. Another kitten. Ace was a very strange cat. He was pensive. He never wanted to go outside. I guess I understand, it's not like I want to go outside that much either. My experiences with people have not been great. I've also had dreams where his eyes glow and he looks up to stare at me. He also had a weird thing where sometimes his body would just twitch. It wouldn't be long or anything, just one small twitch and he would continue with whatever he was doing. Sometimes in these dreams, he would disappear and appear someplace else. I would look away from him and he would just be there. My stomach would start to feel weird whenever I was around him. It would only get worse from there.

The weirdest part about Ace is sometimes he would find his way outside of the house. There is only one place  he would go. The neighbor's. I don't talk to these guy's much but they're an old couple. The only time I really had a good conversation with them was when they brought over cookies when I moved over. They asked if they could come inside and I'm like sure, why not? They were very kind and nothing seemed wrong with them. So why is my cat going over there? Even when he's not at the neighbor's place, he sits on the couch and looks over at their house. At this point, the nightmares were getting worse and I felt the need to puke every time I saw him. 

I'm not sure if this weird stuff has anything to do with my previous trauma from Larry or if it's just that something is really wrong with this cat. I don't really care at this point. I just want him gone. I considered taking him to the vet, but I was too afraid to even go near him. I had to call someone from the adoption center to pick him up. The second he left, it felt like I was free. I felt less heavy like a massive weight had been lifted. The nightmares still continued. 

*"They're just nightmares, right?" I thought.*

So, I decided I would book a therapy session. My computer was in another room, though, so I got out of bed and walked out of my room. I saw it. It was back on my couch, staring at the neighbor's house. This time, he slowly turned around and stared me dead in the eyes. I don't know why. I froze. He just turned around and went back to staring at the neighbor's house. What should my next move be? That was the question that burned in my head. Talk to the neighbor's. Yes, the neighbor's could fix all of this. 

So, I went over to the neighbor's and gently knocked on the door. The wife opened the door.

"Hi! Do you need anything?" says the wife.

"Can... Can I ask you something?" I asked.

"Sure, head inside and I'll bring over Gary."

I went inside. 

"Oh, Gary! Come on down!" the wife shouted.

Gary, who I assume is the husband, walked down the stairs in the room to the left. 

"You're the neighbor guy, right?" asked Gary.

"Yeah." I replied.

"How about we head on over to the dinner table" he suggested.

We went over to the dinner table.

"So, what's your name?" I asked the wife.

"I'm Susan. This over here is Gary as I assume you already knew," she answered, "What did you want to talk about?"

"Oh, um, it's kind of a bit weird. So, I got this cat a while ago, right? It has... strange and disturbing habits but one of them includes going over to your place and just hanging around there for hours on end." I explained

"Yeah, we've seen it. I swear I thought that was a stray for the longest time. You say he's actually yours? I wouldn't lose sleep over it, maybe he just thinks he can go over here for some extra food" asked Gary. 

"We've fed it quite a bit, haven't we, Gary?" remarks Susan.

I realized that this conversation probably was not going to lead me to any conclusions, so I decided that this would be a good time to make an offer.

"Gary, Susan? Would you guy's like to have Ace? I've been thinking about getting a puppy soon and from my experience they have not been compatible" I said, chuckling a bit near the end.

"Oh, I would love to have another cat! Wouldn't you, Gary? I'd hate to take your cat away from you though. Promise you'll come visit him?" Susan cheered.

"Wait, wait. What do you mean by 'strange and disturbing behaviors?'" asked Gary.

My heart sank. 

"Oh, haha. He can just be a little overly stoic, y'know? It's nothing that bad. It just struck me as kind of odd because my last kitten, may he rest in peace, was a lot more energetic." I said. 

"Alright, we'll take him. What harm could one little kitten do?" he chuckled. 

Once again, a massive weight had been lifted off of my back. It felt like I could finally breathe again. 

"Alright, well that settles it. I'll bring him over right now" I said.

I walked over to the front door, opened it, and there he was. He was nuzzling the neighbor's car.

"Oh, there you are. Of course. Come here, you little bastard." I laughed.

I gently grabbed him and brought him to Gary in my arms.

"He's all yours" I said.

I went back home, the nightmares had finally stopped. For the first time in months, I could finally sleep.

Gary was found dead the next day. A part of his throat was ripped out. The cat was nowhere to be found. Some neighbor's have claimed that they still see him nuzzling the neighbor's car or waiting at his doorstep. My blood ran cold at the thought of him being anywhere near my house. It didn't help at all that Gary's blood was on my hand. The past week, the nightmare's have started up again and they've been worse than ever. The new nightmares seem to have one sentence that keeps popping up over and over.

*It wasn't fast.*
