I grew up in a pretty rundown trailer park in the Midwest, gravel roads, surrounded by the ugly Midwestern wilderness. Over grown and full of disgusting bugs that'll make your day miserable. All my neighbors were certified crack heads that we tended to avoid, hell my own household avoided each other, staying each in our own rooms, even eating dinners in our rooms was the norm, but to make a long story short we were extremely poor and nothing in life was exciting enough to bring us together. 

Years later as an adult I look back and still feel some nostalgia, my life wasn't perfect and my family was ultimately doomed but I have some good memories. I'd spend nights out in the backyard on the our old janky trampoline, curled up in a sleeping bag, little boom box playing some old cassettes my grandmother had given me, think Buddy Holly Era. I'd stare up at the stars all night, millions of them clouding my vision, catching the occasional shooting star. It fascinated me to think about what could exist up there in the great unknown. The crickets and low hum of the highway in the distance as semis rolled by combine with my boom box was hypnotizing. 

Anyways, the reason I bring all this up is because as an adult I became extremely fascinated with space, taking in all the technical knowledge I could, I majored in Physics and after graduating got a job as a high school physics teacher. Now I try really hard to stick to hard science and the facts but tonights events have given me the concrete evidence I've needed to start talking. When I was a kid, I used to sleep with my bed tucked against the window wall so I could stare out the window and fall asleep. Well one night a massive ball of white light sped by about 30 feet from my house, I could clearly see it as I was staring out the window, I was in complete shock but ended up falling asleep shortly after. For years I wondered if my brain had confused this memory with a dream, until the sleep paralysis started.

My parents divorced in my late teens, my dad, brother and I moved to another shitty house in the woods in the next town over, leaving my mother to her own wits at the old house. Not to get too far into but life still wasn't great and my father hadn't thought of getting us beds so I slept on some blankets in my new room. This was my first instance of sleep paralysis, if you've experienced this you know exactly the feelings I'll try to describe. My body felt as if it had been pinned to the floor, I was unable to breath, speak, or move, out of the corner of my room where I was facing was a window, and black figure stepped up to the window on the outside, slowly opened it and slicked its way through as if it had no bones, and walked towards me, coming down to its knees and bringing its completely black face inches from mine. Immediately waking up as it would've touched my face to its own, I was out of breath and completely terrified. Instances of these dreams carried on for my whole life, but I noticed I pattern, when I slept near a window and could see outside, a ball of light would speed by before I'd fall into my nightmares. 

I've never told anyone about the dreams, not even my wife. Life's been fine, I mean great without bringing up my strange traumas. She's perfect and I didn't want to disturb the life we've made. We just recently had a baby, a girl we named Sadie, after my wife's grandmother, and also bought our first home. Today changes all of that though, I saw the light and had another dream. The figure was many, and came through every entrance into the room, closet, windows, master bath, but they didn't come to me. They came for her, my sweet baby girl, they wanted my Sadie, I couldn't move, breath, I tried screaming, I wanted to scream so fucking bad, but nothing worked, as a collective they surrounded her crib and the one who entered through the window picked her up and slinked out the window while the others went back to their respective holes. When I awoke she was gone. 

I'm writing this now because I don't know what's going to happen next. I know for sure that I'll never see my daughter again and just in case something happens to me, I just want there to be documentation. Look, in my field and in my studies you hear a lot wacko stories about space aliens and rogue asteroids and just the general end of the world nonsense, so I know how this sounds but this is real. If you have seen the shadow people in your dreams or the glowing orbs  you and your loved ones are in danger. They aren't from here. My names Bill Harken and let my story be a warning.
