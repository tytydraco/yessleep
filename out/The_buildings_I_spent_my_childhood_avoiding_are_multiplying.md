I’m writing this because I honestly don’t know how to make sense of what’s happening in my home town. Buildings are inanimate and concrete can’t just materialise but *something* is going on. It’s affecting the people too… I’m terrified for my mum, she’s like a completely different person and I can’t snap her out of it. I’m really hoping some of you can help me make sense of whatever this is because right now I’m struggling to find a reasonable explanation.

Around 10 years ago a construction company bought the largely unused plot of land beside the quiet suburbs where I grew up. The plan was to turn it into luxury high-rises, flashy, soulless buildings that mirrored the ones ever prevalent in the city. It was unsurprisingly not a popular investment for locals who valued quiet, community and the strong sense of identity that came from differentiating themselves from city-residents. 

I didn’t think much of it at the time. I was 11 and the desperate pleas of my mum and her friends on the local community Facebook group to ‘stop the destruction of our beautiful town’ was the least of my worries. 

I didn’t particularly like the whirring cranes that began to loom over the short tree-line that trickled out behind our home. I definitely didn’t like the town hall meetings that I was dragged to. Our proximity to the actual buildings site itself also meant that every lulling drill and clink of metal reverberated into my bedroom.

But, as mentioned, I was 11. If I wanted to tune out of the chaos I could always put my headphones on, and let whatever song or video carry me off to a short-lived fantasy. And I did just that.

Two years later everything ground to a halt. The company that had so abrasively forced its way into our town had now retreated. Filed for bankruptcy. I remember the day I found out because my mum was sat at the table, gleaming. Shiny brown eyes pumping with adrenaline as if to say *we won.*

I thought the days of community melodrama and an annoying hum of disapproval that lingered like background radiation were over. The problem was gone. Erased. Dead.

But it wasn’t that simple.

Bankruptcy doesn’t equal demolition.  The unfinished buildings stayed put. Not abandoned in the most commonly depicted way. Not furnished and polished and finished. Not lived in then left to deteriorate slowly. 

The buildings were shells of themselves from the point they were left.

Two concrete masses. Harsh squares cosplaying windows, still visible construction markings etched into the walls. The nauseating height which permeated the relatively flat level of the town. The awkward space between them where paths had been mapped out but left as a gritty open space of dirt.

Odd offshoots of concrete were more visible in the second building, even more unfinished. The divisions between each floors stacked up like a real life game of Jenga and the thin metal fence meant to keep you out groaned tirelessly.

I saw them on the odd occasion I travelled that way, mainly through the dim-view of the car window. It was at this point that I was forced to take more notice.

Every time I saw them they made me feel a strange wave of sickness. The fact I could see through the window-holes, make out the dark insides, made it worse. It was as if I was staring straight into carcasses. Crows rested in the open gaps, nature making the whole… *unnatural* element even more glaringly obvious. 

My irrational fear got worse the longer they stayed there.

The cranes which were once visible from my window were now replaced with the tops of those concrete monsters. The roofs. Like two spying eyes fixed on me at all times. The strangest part was that it was the buildings themselves that scared me. Not what ghosts or creatures could be hiding within, just the structures themselves. I couldn’t bare them.

By the time I was 15 I would actively go out of my way to avoid them. While everyone else in town complained about them being an eyesore and a ‘stain on historic features’ I wanted them out of conversation, out of my mind and mostly out of my eyeline.

I would keep my curtains pulled shut tightly at all times, confining myself to a room filled with only the yellow buzzing of artificial light. If I passed it in the car I would glue my eyes to the floor. I stopped walking that direction all together. 

My precautionary measures proved useless though because I could still *feel* them. The nausea, the unease, it didn’t go away just because I couldn’t see them. It clung to me like a twisted thread was tied between us.

I was too embarrassed to tell tell anyone, to tell people about my fear of old concrete structures that were so hollow and lacked any substance. So boring that they couldn’t even make for a good ghost story or urban legend. It seemed like an easy way to get myself bullied. I wish I had said something at the time.

When I was 16 I had to move schools. My local secondary school didn’t have a sixth form and by some dreaded curse the next closest one was in *that* direction. 

By the time I was enrolled and the start of the year came around it was only me, my bike and those two haunting buildings left. My mum couldn’t drive me no matter how much I begged, she had work and as she was the only breadwinner, I couldn’t really argue. The towns tired and severely underfunded bus only ran down that road an hour *after* I had to be through those school gates.

So I took my bike as most people did around there.

The first day was the hardest. It was like jumping headfirst into the middle of a volcano. I did mental gymnastics trying to force myself to push that first peddle, not to freeze the second I could see them peering through the trees. My fingers trembled on the handles, anticipating seeing them whole again.

The carcusses. The shells. The skeletons.

After I’d taken some deep breaths and told myself to *just look forward* I found it in me somewhere to just go. The images I had were mental screenshots I’d taken when I was 13, surely I had to be exaggerating? Maybe it was just pre-teen anxieties that I’d blown out of proportion? I tried to gaslight myself out of pent-up paranoia.

The tree line paused. I looked forward. 

My bike creaked, loud in the silence. I looked forward.

The wave of sickness hit me, harder than it had done since I left my curtains open. I looked forward.

And then it was over.

It was back to temporary forest until finally it blended into the nearby town. I could see my school and the impending doom gurgling in my stomach settled. The threat of a new school, new people and new classes could never match the dread of that place.

I’d wanted a friend to cycle with in the beginning but I never had any. I wasn’t good at anything but being alone and often self-sabotaged myself by not making an effort. But, a few weeks into school I’d forgotten all about that, I’d mastered speeding past without so much as a second of broken eye contact.

I continued this all throughout my last two years of school - it was easy. If I kept my eyes ahead, that unavoidable sickness was the only thing to touch me. I didn’t have to look at that place ever again. Sure, I kept my curtains closed and quietly exited the room the second anyone brought them up but I was successfully blocking them out of my life, more than when I was 15 and paranoid.

At this point I understand that it really sounds like I was a kid with a fear of abandoned buildings. Buildings can be objectively creepy and hell, people are scared of much weirder shit. But this is where I’m convinced it’s more than what was just in my head, or at least connected to it. 

My last day of school. I had an offer at a university I really wanted to go to and was so relived to be free of my childhood terror that spent its time picking at my brain. No more sickness, no more curtains, no more looking at the floor. 

Just one last bike ride.

It was too easy at this point. I think that’s why everything went wrong. Or maybe that big, uneven piece of concrete debris *right* in the middle of the road wasn’t an accident. 

My wheel got caught and everything stopped, flinging me off and into the grassy ditch. It took me a moment to understand what happened. When your caught off guard it doesn’t matter what mantra you’ve been chanting to yourself or whatever thoughts were at the front of your mind before. I didn’t think to look ahead I just looked *up.*

Up at the concrete giants.

It threw me so much that it took me too long to realise what was so wrong. 

Everything was how I remembered. Jagged, looming structures with hard-cut windowless holes, scratchy markings, the frame of different floors partially visible and looking so eerily devoid of anything.

Everything expect for the fact there was now a third building.

It stood to the left of the others, slightly further back but still and sturdy as if it had *always* been there. 

But it hadn’t been there. 

I knew that for certain because I’d spent so much of my time being terrorised by the image. I’d seen the roofs looking through my bedroom window. I’d heard the townsfolk talking about it for years, even before they were built.

It was only ever supposed to be two… so why was there a third structure?

My eyes locked to it. It was identical to the others. The cold, grainy material, the cuts and carvings, the dirt road circled round it to make way for a path that never was. 

I wanted to throw up immediately. The nausea I had always known felt like nothing compared to this, an overwhelming illness that put my heart in my throat and made my mind fog up. I suddenly couldn’t breathe, or think or move. It wasn’t possible for a building to just *appear* like that? 

But it was there and I was seeing it.

After what felt like minutes I finally scrambled back up. Blood seeped from the scratch on my knee but I didn’t do anything expect grab my bike and get on it. I immediately directed myself back towards home, instinctual, delayed tears forming behind my eyes.

*Look forward. Look forward. Look Forward.*

When I made it home I could barely process anything. It felt like I’d undone all my years of progress, ended up back where I first begun. I’d seen it now and the passing sickness was now a permanent pit in my stomach.

I remember clutching the walls, almost as if that place had physically altered me. There were three buildings. How the hell had another one of those *things* just appeared? It made no sense and was made worse by the pounding slowly getting louder in my head.

I rushed up to my room and pulled back the curtain. Maybe I’d imagined it, maybe my shock had plummeted into full blown schizophrenia or something. I would look out my window and see two roofs.

But I was met with three.

Like it had been copy and pasted, that third building stood beside the others, smothered in the deep green of the forest. It distorted the picture I had always imagined through my curtains, questioned everything I thought I knew.

Seriously, how the fuck is that even possible?

When my mum got home I bombarded her before she even got through the door. I had been in a barely responsive ball for the hours since I looked through my window.

“There’s three of them,” I said.

She frowned, “Three of what?”

“The-the abandoned buildings, theres always been two. Now there’s three.” I continued to ramble, frightening her with my harsh eye contact.

My mum broke free from my gaze and went to put her stuff down on the table slowly. I could tell immediately that she thought I was insane, but not for the reason she said next.

“Arlo, there’s always been three buildings.”

“What? No there hasn't.”

“Yes,” She smiled, “there has.”

My mind froze, my words clammed up. Was she gaslighting me? Was this some strange joke I didn’t understand? 

Before I could say anything she lifted up two leaflets from a pile of random letters that had been accumulating on the table for years.

“Look,” She pointed at the first leaflet, one from the original construction company with designs for the luxury apartments, “There was *always* going to be three.”

As much as I remembered the original plans having two this felt slightly explainable.

What if they never finished construction of the third building? They did go bankrupt barely into construction.

When I articulated this point my mum showed me the other leaflet. 

A leaflet for a town committee meeting a year ago. 

With a photo of those three abandoned buildings.

It was the same on the Facebook group. Recently, 3 years ago, back when I was 11 - every single photo had three. It was like a twisted Mandela effect.

How could I have been so sure?

How could I have been so wrong about something occupying my mind so often?

This wasn’t the only thing that fucked with me. My mum said something after that just doesn’t make sense.

“They’re nice though aren’t they? They add to the neighbourhood.”

I glared at her.

“Nice? You’ve spent years trying to get them torn down.”

“Well, they’re not too bad. What harm is a little bit of concrete, hm?” She muttered.

It might sound mundane but if you know my mum you *know* that she is a headstrong, borderline ‘Karen’ community member who has devoted most of her free time into protesting the building. Where the hell was the woman who gave me lectures on preserving small town authenticity when I was 11?

That and her *creepy* smile. It was so… placid. Like she thought I was insane, like she’d always been in favour of those buildings the same way there’d always been three.

After that I got the *fuck* out of that town and went to university. It was alright, made some friends for the first time in my life and started to realise how much of weight those stupid buildings were on my shoulders. 

Holidays were hard because I couldn’t go home. My weird mental block didn’t go away and as much I wanted to see my mum something wouldn’t let me. 

She became more distant too, it wasn’t as if she was *begging* for me to come home. I guess she grew to assume I was busy or travel was too expensive. By the time I graduated a month ago we barely spoke.

But I went home last week for the first time in three years and it’s got *so much worse*.

Enough for me to know I didn’t just misremember something.

Mum is…off. Like an elevated version of that slightly creepy woman I left.

She welcomed me in like I’d never left, hugged me like she’s actually responded to any of my texts in the last year (beside the one where I said I was visiting home.)

I didn’t want to acknowledge the buildings, they felt so far away from who I was now. I was here to see my only family, not the things that plagued my childhood.

She seemed to pleased to see me. She had a constant smile, vacant eyes and this thing where if I asked for anything she would immediately spring up like she was on a time limit or something.

If I asked her anything about her self, *especially* about what she’s been doing to keep herself busy all these years she’d switch the topic back to me - well, until I brought up the community centre.

“Do you not go to those cooking classes anymore? You loved those.”

She looked at me, almost robotically. 

“No. I am part of the preservation society.”

Sounded harmless enough.

“Preservation of what?” I replied assuming it was something nature or history related.

“Preservation of those wonderful concrete buildings.”

My heart plummeted.

There was no way she was serious, right?

But she was. I could see it in her eyes.

She almost looked *through* me, like I was in the way of whoever she was really talking too. I tried to respond but my mouth moved up down almost mechanically.

It wasn’t just her years of hatred and protest down the drain that threw me but also how violent the emergence of their presence was in my own mind. I could see the window holes, feel the nausea, taste the dirt that hit my face when I fell off my bike all those years ago.

“What? I thought you and the town wanted to tear them down? What happened?” I questioned frantically.

“We all decided they make a nice addition to the community. What harm is a little bit of concrete, hm?” She purred in response.

This was when that thing she said to me that day came back to me, held some significance. That same sentence. Who says that twice?

*What harm is a little bit of concrete, hm?*

I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe that her whole stance would change like that in three years. A preservation committee too? The town who I grew up watching attacking, fighting, clawing at protecting their community now wants to protect those monstrosities?

It doesn’t make any sense.

I didn’t want to fight. I arrived close to midnight and I was so tired from travel that it just didn’t seem worth it. I was also so freaked out that I needed to be away from her and *those eyes*. It was all too intense.

In my bedroom the curtains were shut, just as I left them. It was as if I was suddenly living my old life again. I could feel the invisible gaze of those peering roofs and I couldn’t find it in me to reveal them. The irrational fear came flooding back and images that had been so deeply lost in my mind came back in flashes. The two that became three (that was supposedly, always, three.)

I went straight to sleep, my doziness luckily outweighing the nausea. I woke with a headache though and that uncomfortable feeling that told me I’d only been sleeping lightly. One night back and my body had already resumed the patterns I’d so desperately escaped.

I hadn’t missed the darkness either. Not being able to open my curtains, living like I was in some underground bunker. I hesitated beside the light switch and before I resumed that cycle of artificial light and dread of the concrete outside, something changed.

Maybe its because I’d arrived in the darkness, maybe it was just my mums strange behaviour and the rush of being back here but I was hit with an air of defiance. I couldn’t deal with this weirdness anymore.

I wasn’t 15 anymore.

I wasn’t scared of stupid buildings.

I’d moved on from the me who’d been convinced the third building appeared.

So I opened the curtains.

I wish I hadn't.

I wish I never went back to that place at all.

It was *so* close to my room.

Another one. Another building.

A sixth one to be exact.

Three had grown, spawned, *appeared,* whatever it is they do, in the time I was gone.

One of them right opposite my room. 

So close that I could see inside, face to face with withering grey concrete, chipped and crumbling inside. Every bit of jagged building was glaring right at me, every forgotten construction marking and remnant of human attempt at creating a home was seeping into my eyes.

It was too far to touch it but enough that it shaded a large part of the sun from my room. Enough that I could see bird nests wound amongst some of pillars. Enough that I could see every dent and imperfection in the hellish carcass structure 

So many of the trees were just *gone* too. Ploughed down to make way for trails surrounding the three new buildings They were so static, so still, so inanimate but it felt like they were all staring at me. Taunting me. Reaching out and choking me with a mangled hand from the past.

I’m not sure if it was the intensity of the sickness or the shock of having one of those things so close to me but my knees immediately buckled. I collapsed onto the carpet and froze. The same way I did when I fell off my bike. Unable to move, unable to speak, unable to do anything but stare.

When I was snapped out my trace, I had to put my hand to my mouth, stifling gagging from the ripples of nausea feasting in my stomach. It was more vicious, more violent than any other sickness that I'd grappled with. Worse than when I fell off my bike.

I rushed downstairs to my mum immediately, the world spinning. 

I feared what she’d say to me.

Would she call me crazy again?

There was no denying it this time. No acting as if I was stupid or the victim of some Mandela effect. There were *never* six buildings, and there was definitely never a building so close to me it felt as if I was baring my soul to it.

“There are six of them!” Is all I managed to muster up, “There were never that many… mum, tell me how that’s possible?”

She looked up like a robot, that stupid smile that I was beginning to resent so much. Before the words even left her mouth I could tell exactly what she was going to say to me.

“Arlo, there’s always been six buildings.”

Another wave of sickness. I clutched the side of the kitchen table.

“There’s always been six? There’s one right outside my window!” I almost yelled in disbelief, “That has never been there, you know that!”

I was loosing my mind. This was a weird distorted dream. I wish I had been in a dream since the day those buildings were announced.

Mum grinned and flashed vacant eyes. I grabbed those same leaflets from the same position on the table. They hadn’t moved. Nothing in the house had moved. It was all so pristine. Like mum hadn’t even been living here at all.

But the leaflets themselves were different.

Three instead of two.

Now six instead of three.

Six buildings the whole time. 

At this point I could barely find anything to say at all. The sickness was unbearable, my mind was breaking and nothing made any logical sense. 

It was mums voice breaking the silence that finally gave me the push to get out.

“Even if they had multiplied, what harm is a little bit of concrete, hm?” She repeated like a broken record.

“Stop saying that! God, what’s wrong with you?” I yelled, completely freaked the fuck out at this point, “Can’t you see these things, they’re… alive or something.”

Mum didn’t even look up at me, ignoring my pleas.

“There were always six, Arlo.” She spoke in a cheery, almost sing-along voice.

Her voice grated against my mind.

I slammed my hand down against the table. I was so frustrated, and the fact that I was being gripped by a nausea that was so violent but never *actully* let me be sick was starting to gnaw away at me. I couldn’t be there anymore. Be around her.

I could tell mum was gone.

She wouldn’t listen.

She’s like a voice for those things now.

So I left the house.

I’ve been in a hotel around two hours away for a few days now. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what’s happened to my mum. I don’t believe those buildings aren’t growing. 

I don’t know what any of it means.

I don’t want to leave her there but I can’t go back. I can’t deal with the looping sentences, the concrete carcass gaping into my room or being *gaslit* anymore. I can’t just go back to my flat in a city miles away either, not when something so weird is fucking happening. 

I’m stuck.
