Have you ever thought about something that happened to you during a car drive or when you are laying in bed? I have, but I let that thought eclipse every other thought recently.

You see, this thought has captured my mind so badly that I cannot help but to keep researching it to see what exactly happened to me and why.

I keep looking up the date it happened and what happened on it in the news in vain even though it happened in the middle of a populated suburb. I retrace my steps over and over again during the same time of the day, it never repeats.

I am left clueless and without anymore resort. All I have is you guys to maybe answer my questions.

It started last summer when it was a hot, humid day. If you ever lived in the Deep South, you know how crappy the summers can be. Sweat all over and your skin burning from the harsh sun. Anyhow, I was trying to take a nap in only my Edgar Allan Poe-themed boxers (Yes they exist.) when a loud boom echoed, shaking the walls of my house.

I shot up and raced out of bed, nearly getting tripped over by two of the large tall fans I used to cool myself down. I practically broke down the front door of my home before rushing out and looking around along with several of my neighbors. We all saw nothing. My friend Tammy was already on her phone calling the police while everyone else seemed just as confused as I was. It must have been a serious explosion. We have a military base close by, so I thought perhaps it might have come from there.

I went back inside like everyone else there after a minute or two of searching while stood on our porches, not really worried but not settled either when I saw it, off the corner of my eye in the backdoor window. I snapped my head back over and watched in awe.

It was a purple ball of pure light with bits of violet leaking out in sharp sparks of energy. Reminded me of ball lightening if you have ever heard of that before. Before it were two figures, one was bright orange with black on the sides of its body, slender yet muscular in frame and the other was this wide, black-as-night with a spine of gold sticking out from its back. They were too busy staring at the orb to pay attention to me, if they had noticed me at all that is. I gawked before they suddenly jumped in, almost 20 feet up in the air, to the strange power source and disappeared within it before the purple thing vanished without a trace.

I stood there, frozen. The rest of the day was spent in my bed, thinking and staring up at the ceiling. What did I see? Please tell me. I am at the end of my wits and I can't stop thinking about it. Please, help me.
