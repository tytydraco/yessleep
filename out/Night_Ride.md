Through the smog hanging over the night winter roads outside the city, the driver and his car glided. The driver was experienced enough in driving on the Old Continent to feel confident in his skills, the car of such class that he didn't have to prove anything to anyone.

 

Earlier, as he went through the zebra crossing into the parking lot, he had checked the road with his shoe – dry, he had judged, but years behind the wheel had taught him that on a humid day and frosty night, a road that was dry in one place would not necessarily be so in another.

 

He was a serious man in a serious car, and the contrast was the sound of Molly's Lips by Nrvana playing from the speakers and it was his conscious choice, not a random old-timer’s radio station, where rock songs are interspersed with ads for incontinence pills. The song was a portal to another time, when his now short, thinning, slicked-back hair reached his shoulders, and instead of a casual blazer, he wore a casual flannel shirt, a portal to when he was alive.

 

He only half-registered the car that was overtaking him, at first he wondered if it was just a memory – bald tires, too many young, clearly drunk people inside; only the music didn't match, the other one was electronic too, but it was just a regular oompa-oompa , this one, despite its intensity, was darker, and the choice of sounds was more interesting, he liked it, which he could rarely say in the case of electronic music.

He himself had something in the trunk, but he also had two rules: the first was his personal one, after all, as a European he inherited individualism from the Enlightenment and could have his own rules – he never drinks when he has to drive, the second rule is social, because as a man he was a herd animal – he never drinks alone, he only drank with his demons.

It wasn't supposed to be like this then, he was supposed to get drunk with his friends at a party, but friends of friends showed up and it ended with them driving for another bottle, laughing, screaming, drunk guys, drunk girls and that awful music. There were seven of them, three got out of the car, three stayed, he was kind of in between, he supposedly got out, but actually died then and for 20 years now he's been sitting in a wrecked car under a tree. He joined the ranks of those people who supposedly came back, but kind of stayed; survivors of disasters, war veterans etc. If he read internet forums he would hear to go to therapy. Do you feel bad? - go to therapy, is your conscience bothering you? - go to therapy, is your wife cheating on you? - go to therapy, are you poor? - go to therapy. However, he was a serious man and didn't have time to read internet forums.

 

The youth from the car next to him waved their hands through the windows, the car flashed its lights, tried to block his path, but he – the serious one, continued driving at a constant speed in his serious car. And the youth, seeing that they would not be able to provoke him into a race, and not knowing that it was because crazy driving that could result in death did not appeal so much to those who were already dead, spat on the hood of his car and moved quickly forward, the finish line was two kilometers ahead of them and it was a quercus rubra, or red oak, as some would like.
