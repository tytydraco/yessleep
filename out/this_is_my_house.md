I've never liked guests for as long as I've known. I find it extremely annoying when people come to visit for various reasons. It feels like everybody is walking all over our privacy and I seem to be the only one bothered by it. My mother whom we do almost everything together enjoys guests more than anything, making me feel I'm never good enough of a company for  her.

She always has dinner parties, invites her cousins over etc. During all these visits, I either choose to stay in my room and play on my own or never answer a question that's directed at me when I have to have meals with them. My mom always jokes about it and tries to make this seem unimportant, putting their feelings before mine.

Our regular visitors have seemed to accept that I didn't like their presence, not that they care though. Because lately we have even more guests! Since it's spring, our garden is thriving and everyone who comes to visit says we're so lucky to have our every meal in a place like this. But they do too, almost every day to my annoyence. At least, thankfully they learnt not to say more than hi to me.

Even though I'd found this acceptable first, I'd be lying if it didn't start to get on my nerves. It feels like I don't even exist anymore, only my mother and whatever she and her guests feel matter the most.

Even my own mom looks like she doesn't care about me any longer. We used to cook, bake, go on walks and feed the ducks together. Now I have to do all of that alone and it's not as fun.

So I picked on a new hobby. A hobby that only I know about.

All these guests coming to our house had stolen my most precious thing from me, my mother. Now it was my turn. Whenever they come for a visit, I steal something important from them. A family heirloom brooch, an embroidered hand-fan, a hand-carved emerald ring etc.

I watch the guests and my mom frantically look for these, sometimes I even help! I give tips for where to look at but since I'm just a child, they mostly don't care. Which is a shame because I sometimes want to give them a chance, I actually tell them where their belongings are. But they never listen. Not even my own mother.

It was again one of those days where mom invited over friends. This time our neighbour's toddler had also been brought along. Quite noisy little thing. With his rosy cheeks and constant giggles, it seemed like he'd captured everybody's attention.

So I knew what I would steal from the guests today. 

Little Tommy.

He was already following me everywhere, so it wasn't hard to make him follow me to the basement door while our parents were on their third bottle of wine, too distracted to care.

I opened the door of the basement slowly, we almost never used here, mom would say it was too scary.

A few steps looked visibly and the rest was complete darkness. Tommy watched me go down a few steps in the dark and decided to follow me once again after a few encouraging words.

I watched him fall on his neck after the second step and never move again, it was quiter than I'd thought. And a bit too quick. But I closed the door behind me with a smile on my face that I later noticed and went to my room to play with my dolls. At least now I know we won't have any guests for a long time and it'll be just mother and me.

I can't believe I found this page of a diary hidden near what seems to be a little boy's bones according to the police! I was so happy to finally be able to afford a house and this happens... The police said they also found various pet bones buried around the house and behind the walls during their search, now I don't know how to continue living in this house, I feel like the souls that diary owner took are still here. So I wanted to share and ask for help. Should I stay or should I go?
