I was a domestic IT employee in the Canadian Armed Forces, and while I traveled more than most in my industry, I still have a relatively boring career. This story I’m going to tell stems back from 2011. Following Windows 7’s debut, large organizations like the one I worked for were doing computer fleet refreshes for software and hardware alike, migrating from the legacy XP stuff of assorted vendors to the then fresh Intel Core.

I never really got close to any specialized servers with military data or fancy hardware. I dealt with the end user side of things. My work on CAF installations was really no different than stuff one would be doing at a large corporation or a university. Minus, of course, the setting. Installations varied, heavily. There could be super modern, fresh and vibrant places adjacent busy roads. Those were lovely. But at the same time, there’d be locations that might consistent of two dusty buildings next to an airfield. The amount and the variety of the places the CAF owned, staffed, and needed hardware at would amaze you, seriously.

So, think: interior British Columbia. Eight buildings servicing a general surveillance radar station. Thirty or so staff while active. Constructed in what I guess would’ve been the 1950s. One road running parallel. Forest on every side. Sounds bland, right? Depends if you like quiet. Anyway, as much as I would’ve liked, the CAF was hard pressed to get any sort of fancy travel for me. My drive up there from Vancouver was a boring one. The majesty of natural scenery gets lost on you when you drive eight monotonous hours. Even before seeing the base, I could tell the surrounding town was a snoozefest. That opinion didn’t change after leaving my hotel and arriving onsite the next morning. It was as described. Old, but not old enough to have been mothballed.

When I got in, I was greeted by a senior tech I was familiar with, who I won’t assign a name to since, as he told me, he would soon be leaving. His assessment was done, hardware had been requisitioned and would be in by the end of the week. That comment irked me because it was, well, a Monday. So, as I came to realize, he explained my work until then would be decommissioning and piling up the old machines, wrapping them on pallets and sending them who knows where. Now, ordinarily, we did this to the old computers simultaneously while deploying the new computers to minimize downtime. But, this time, whatever radar apparatus the station used was being upgraded at the same time the computers were, so we had free reign to rip the old computers out as we pleased with no downtime considerations.

I say we, but, really, it was “I.” The senior tech was leaving, and I was the only one who was actually going to be on site for the process, as he informed me. Weird. While it was small location, policy was to have any junior accompanied by, at least, one senior. But this time, there was an exception. The tech was needed elsewhere, and I wasn’t actually being left alone, at least not for the whole week. Whatever information the radar station was managing necessitated specialized database software, one that during the upgrade we’d be migrating from the CAF’s proprietary outdated junk to a more conventional enterprise sequel platform. And, to facilitate that, we’d have a specialized database admin working there. With many more years of experience, she’d be serving the role as my manager in place of the senior tech. Her name was Mary. Prior to her arrival, I’d be following on the tickets assigned. He handed me a security card, as well as a few printed documents of computer inventory, labels to be filled for the pallets, and miscellaneous stuff.

I gained a sort of familiarity with the majority of the people I’ve been working with the past couple of years. Even at remote installations, I’d be with a team member or two that I knew prior. So it was a little strange being left on my own, and not only that, suddenly having to delegate through a woman I’d never met, one arriving late no less. I didn’t dwell on this, though, as my impressions of her came quite quickly after. My first work item was unboxing the specialized hardware for the new server – they had arrived earlier, and I was supposed to ready it for Mary’s arrival. I actually had to leave the building I had met the other tech in and travel a little ways across the installation to the building that connected to the large physical radar equipment. It was smaller than the others. As I entered, I noted the big array of boxes for new equipment – Hewlitt-Packward servers and networking appliances. Weirdly, they’d already been partially unboxed, so I assumed the senior tech had been working on it.

A few more steps in, I remember picking up on the fan noise of the room next over. I entered it, or tried, only realizing then that the doors were locked. I produced my swipe card, a simple magnetic strip one you use on the embedded readers, and tried the door. I was denied access. Apparently, I hadn’t been authorized the room in question. I knocked, unsure why because nobody else was supposed to be there, but a few seconds later, I saw someone stir through the small glass of the door window, coming over and opening it. Immediately the ridiculous fan noise permeated the air. She ushered me back the way I had came, shutting the door behind her and mitigating the noise to reasonable levels once again.

Mary introduced herself then. She was not at all what I was expecting – pretty, early thirties, brown hair. I was in uniform and she meanwhile was in a comfortable blouse and skirt. Professional, and casual. She was friendly, initially. With her she had this very old looking leather bound notebook. She seemed nice enough. I prompted her about the server boxes in the space around us, asking why they arrived before everything else. She said they weren’t apart of the standard computers coming later, and that she’d already started working on them. I asked if she wanted help setting them up, only really offering to render physical assistance with the hardware as I had no clue what OS or database software we would be running.

That’s when something bizarre happened. She seemed to freeze up for a moment, and then she curled over like she was gonna be sick. I bent down, asking her if she was alright, and she dry heaved. It was really odd to watch. She aligned herself with the floor, on her stomach, before heaving again and coughing loudly. Then, she pushed herself back up. Looking at me. She paused for a few seconds. I still remember how she stared at me, complete neutrality, no telling on her face. It was so odd. And then she smiled, telling me sure, before informing me I could only ever be in the server room if she was present alongside. I followed her along as she swiped her card, entering the room. I kept pushing, asking if she was alright, and she just ignored me. I wrote it off as something trivial, I don’t recall what, but it was so strange. She wasn’t embarrassed. Offered no explanation. Just, continued.

There was a desk first and foremost in the room, where Mary had already placed two of the large 2U form factor rack servers atop of and had powered them on. Those weren’t what was making the fan noise, though.  Past them, there was a maze, a literal maze, of server racks. Specialized CAF junk, and I do mean junk. So much of it. It was almost like a corn field. Each rack was ten feet high, with navigational spaces in between. And the room was icy cold. HVAC, I guessed. Now, they weren’t as loud as what I had thought initially. We could talk at normal volume. Still, though, they were a little oppressive. I asked her what it was all these devices did, and she replied that she didn’t know entirely. She knew one of them ran the old tech database, and all she was doing was migrating it to our new hardware. First, though, we had to set it up. And we did.

We had an empty rack at the far end of the maze. The servers that Mary had been unboxing needed to go into them. Now, these things were heavy. You can imagine the kind of weight suitable compute and storage in the era would take up. There was a cart, somewhere, which I offered to go find, but what Mary insisted we do is just run the devices over on one of her rolling lab chairs. That’s when I came to realize she was a little bit of an oddball, well, putting the bizarre heaving from minutes prior aside anyways. It was a ludicrous site, really, me stacking a device across the two armrests and wheeling it over, ensuring she was, in fact, in approval at every step. But I got it done, slotting it into the rack. It already had power cabling from the various power supplies and patch cabling embedded, so we connected those to the respective interfaces and we were done relatively quickly.

When it came to the networking appliances, ones I weren’t really familiar with, Mary told me she needed to configure them on her desk before deployment. Things got very strange quickly here, though. I figured I’d sit around a little and wait, more than happy to refresh my Cisco IOS command line by watching her. She told me that I could go, and she’d be fine installing them. Now, she was perfectly fine, here, right. Relaxed. Friendly. And then I insisted, saying it was no trouble waiting, before she looked at me and snapped. Quite aggressively. She stood up, waving her hand at me, and telling me loudly, almost as if she was talking to an animal, “no!” Then she doubled down, telling me to go away. I stood there, stunned, not quite sure if she was joking or not. In the motion, she had dropped the notebook she was carrying, and I bent down to pick it up for her, before she swooped and picked it up, aggressively wrenching it away from me.

She then walked around the far side of her desk, watching me all the while, clutching her notebook across her chest with two arms. It was incredibly bizarre. So, of course, I left. I was racking my mind. Nothing I did should’ve elicited that kind of reaction. There wasn’t an element of hostility in anything she had said prior, nor was there any hint of anything beyond friendly professionalism. She had snapped. Without warning. It took me a good bit to calm down after that as I hunted down the old computer assets. After some time, I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt; given the scale of her one woman project, she might’ve been under high levels of stress. Really, it was a crazy interaction. Maybe food poisoning? Maybe because of the gender dynamic I thought I had done something wrong, even something incredibly subtle, but now I look back and realize I should’ve known just how weird it as.

Anyways, my duties continued. I spent a good amount of the morning establishing where I was going to eat lunch and hang out during down time. At a lot of sites there’d be computer labs we wouldn’t have to be modifying, ones I could sit in and play a videogame or two I’d be porting around on my external hard drive. But not here. Every single computer was being swapped out, and so I got to work. Something that had slipped my mind at the time was that I had left my bag with my lunch back in the database server room with Mary. By then I was two buildings away, starting on one of the rooms on the upper floor of a structure. I remember undoing the lock securing the desktop to its cage, sliding the bar out, picking the computer up, and turning around. I almost dropped the unit on my foot then and there as I saw Mary, staring at me, a smile on her face.

She seemed friendly. Polite. No sense of the tension of her last words with me. And yet, totally out of place, too. I was confused how she had found me, and what she was doing there, when, without warning, she dropped my leather messenger bag squarely onto the ground in front of me. It thudded on the ground. I hadn’t even been noticing her carrying it. She then apparently finished, not even so much as acknowledging me, before turning and leaving. I noted I could hear her heels clicking down the hall, yet somehow missed them on her approach.

Anyway, I was creeped out. I was positive she hated me, for some reason. The way she had smiled, and just uncaringly dropped my bag on the ground was so incredibly cold. Even still, I found it weird she had followed me, and wondered how she had done it. Granted, we probably were the only two people on the installation at that time, minus any radar techs that may or may not have been around. Anyway, I begin mentally preparing for a week with a bizarre stand in boss. Things go normally as I work on my own. I stack old machines onto pallets, being sure to strip any non volatile storage media from within first, primarily mechanical hard drives. Something to note, the drives have, again, military data on them, so I need to dispose of them secrely. For that, we have a special “degaussing” machine. Effectively, a fancy magnet that wrecks the HDDs data planes, making stuff irrecoverable. Every site had its own. Think size of a microwave, slot a drive in, listen to it make funny noises. So I fill a box with these used hard drives, before heading over to where it was – not Mary’s building, but the first one I had entered that day. I get in, my massive box of drives with me, and plop it down next to the machine. Weirdly, though, I note the thing is on. Clearly active. It didn’t make much sense to me. It was grunt work, even if Mary needed media done, which she almost certainly didn’t, she would’ve gotten me to do it. Even weirder, the process for an HDD would take no more than two minutes on a unit like this, and yet, I didn’t see anyone exit on my way down. Nobody was there now.

I wait a little, and the machine quiets. So I slowly open up the tray, and inside, I find no drive. Initially I thought nothing at all. Then I realize against the dark painted tray, there is a small black ring. I pick it up. It’s hot to the touch. No, that isn’t normal for a machine like this. Even weirder, there’s this smell in the air. It doesn’t seem to be coming from the machine, but instead, just throughout the room. It’s like a palpable tension, a little coppery, ozone. Think thunderstorm. Keep in mind the skies were clear. It was bizarre. So I try not to pay it much mind. I pocket the ring – it appeared to just be a simple, black, metal band – deciding to confront Mary about it, assuming I could work up the nerve. Then I start my batch of hard drives. Nobody comes down into the space while I run through my batch. No issues with the machine, though that ozone smell permeates until I’m finished. It hangs around as I leave the place, too.

End of day rolls around pretty soon after. So, I, timidly, make my way over to Mary’s server room. I knock on the same door I had previous, only to realize the small LED on the access panel was green, signifying it had been swiped and coded to remain unlocked without any timer. I enter, looking over at the desk to find nobody there. Actually, there was a laptop with a rollover cable still consoled into one of the networking switches I had seen that morning. I glance at the terminal, seeing it was still on its generic welcome message. Apparently she hadn’t begun configuring it for the new infrastructure yet, in the span of nearly eight hours. Mary isn’t anywhere to be seen, until I look past into the little server maze. Through the gaps in the racks and appliances, I spot her. So I move over, being careful and calling out to her as polite as I could muster so as not to upset her again. She doesn’t respond. I get a little closer. Even with the ambient noise of the fans, I knew she’d be able to hear me fine. So, slowly, I approach, steeping into the server maze. It’s actually a good bit quieter inside, despite me being in the hot aisle.

It’s really strange. She’s just standing there, staring directly at one of the racks. One that appears to be off, mind you. It’s old CAF hardware that I couldn’t really identify, and she’s just sort of, stood in front of it. Mesmerized by something. I say her name once. And then twice. And then, both scared of her snapping but also legitimately concerned, I tap her on the shoulder. She doesn’t whip around, like I had thought, instead coming about to look at me. Where she is, an air ejection from one of the other racks is blowing some stands of hair up into her face, and she looks completely glazed over. Tired, I don’t know. Just unavailable. I notice she’s still clutching her notebook. And then, seconds later, she blinks. She corrects her posture, shaking her head quickly, before smiling at me.

She says hey, asking what I’m doing there. And I just blink, before asking her if she’s alright. I had such an itchy feeling across my skin then. It’s hard to explain. It was just unbearable. I felt like I had to leave. I didn’t know why. Hurriedly she moves past me, out of the hot aisle and back towards her desk. She specifies that she had gotten distracted, before sitting down at her laptop. Now, I don’t know for sure, because she masterfully caught and corrected herself. But for a split second, this look of shock came over her face as she sat down. Then it was gone instantly. She then mentioned something about letting the day get away from her. Incredibly weirded out, I told her I was headed home for the day, receiving but not really waiting for her approval.

I didn’t end up asking her about the ring. I’d forgotten because of the weird daze I had found her in. I took it out of my pocket when I was back at my hotel, throwing it onto my nightstand, not before examining it. It wasn’t a simple black band like I had thought, but rather many tight individual metal fibers pressed together. It looked pretty intricate. When I went in the next morning I decided I wasn’t going to bother her about it. I wanted to minimize the unnecessary interactions we had because of how weird her character was, and it wasn’t like the degaussing machine had been damaged.

So I stop by her lab, noting again that the door was swiped green so I didn’t have to knock. I’m directly on time – like I said, I wanted to minimize interactions. No plans to chat with her, nothing like that. The room is mostly the same as I enter. I notice, though she’s absent at her desk, the networking device from the day previous was gone, apparently installed. I didn’t see her anywhere in the room, so I call her name. No response. I take a little scan, peeking through the maze of hardware racks and not seeing her anywhere. She was absent, so I figured she was just late. I go off to continue my work from yesterday. I checked back in both at nine and ten thirty, but she wasn’t in either of those times.

Around eleven, I have another box of scalped hard drives I set off to degauss. As soon as I open the doorway to the staircase with the room, Mary brushes past me. She’s wearing the same outfit as the day prior, something I picked up on for reasons that’ll soon become clear. I notice then the same ozone smell I had sniffed out previously. It’s oozing off of what I presumed to be her, and I wrinkle my nose. There’s this palpable tension in the air, like I’m about to get a static shock. So, I look at her, and she smiles relatively normally. Greets me. I ask her where she’s been all morning, if she was degaussing drives. And she has this look. Like, one where she blanked out for a second and just stared at me, dull and bored, before she came back to life. She tells me not to worry about it. And I don’t push.

So, I start efficiently explaining what I’d be doing that day – she was my stand-in manager, after all. But she doesn’t really seem to care. Just nodding, passively. Then I say I’m about to go start the degausser, and she stops me. She raises her hand squarely, before again that dull kind of expressionless face takes over, before snapping back to normal. It’s really hard to explain. It’s just, like she cut out for a minute. She then asks me if I was messing with the degausser the day before, and I said yes, and then, she zeroes in. Gets real close, like real close. I would’ve thought she was leaning in for a kiss if the context was different, but she has the most narrow eyed serious look on her face ever. She then asks, sternly, monotonously, if I had taken anything out of the machine, specifically, anything that wasn’t mine.

I’d like to say I’m not easily intimidated, let alone by someone a good bit smaller than me, but she was just exuding this tension. Mad and angry but masked. And that stupid metallic ozone stink is all I could smell. Obviously, my mind goes back to the ring, but the way she’s in my space, I think she might snap if I even acknowledge it. So I tell her, “no.” And there’s another three seconds of just maintaining eye contact, staring, before her expression eases up. And she cocks her head, still smiling, before saying, in a bizarrely friendly and upbeat tone, “are you sure?”

I knew I was lying. Lying through my teeth. But the way she swapped emotions just then made me want to say anything to discontinue the conversation. So, I remained steadfast. Insisted I hadn’t taken anything. And then, to get the focus away from what I had assumed was her missing the bizarre ring, I countered and asked her what she was doing in the degausser’s room. Rather than replying, she just smiled again. Her face relaxed, and she sort of shrugged her shoulders before she continued up the remainder of the stairs and out of the room. Only did I realize after she had gone that I was sweating.

Mary was so damned bizarre. I had no means by which to understand her emotions. I wondered if she was having a mental health struggle. Was she even fit to be working in that condition? I didn’t know. I know I briefly explained the supervisor dynamic, but there wasn’t much I could do. Trust me. At my position, back then, me checking in with the senior tech and saying “hey, the lady you left to manage me is crazy!” would not go over well. So I bit the bullet. Told myself I’d just keep my head down. Minimize interactions. Do what was needed, so I couldn’t be fired. And, yes, I was going to return the ring. I just felt like revealing it there, in that interrogation, would’ve caused her to lash out. She looked so predatory. I planned to return it the next morning, placing it somewhere where she’d be likely to find it.

The day went quick. Each time I brought a new batch of drives to degauss, I felt like the pressure in the air and the ozone smell had gotten worse. And it was extending outside the building, too. Not everywhere, just around the two primaries, the degausser’s and Mary’s. I went to see her again as the day ramped up, but the server room was empty. Weird as it was, it was relieving. Back at my hotel, I put the ring in the pants pocket of what I wanted to wear the next day so I wouldn’t forget.

Here’s where things get strange. I arrive on site the next morning, parking and heading in. For a better visual layout, there’s a building directly in front of me, and to the left is where the land raises and the radar installation lives with Mary’s server room at the base. Between those two, though, is a pretty clear stretch that leads to the woods bordering the site. It’s about sixty meters wide. The treeline itself isn’t that far away. I could see to the end. Really clear and visible. Now, I tell you this to accentuate the following: I could see someone, standing far at the edge, right in front of the trees. It’s raining out that day, not a lot but even still they had no extra layers on. And while she was far away, I could tell because of the identical clothes from the previous two days and the color of her hair that it was Mary. Standing, staring into the trees. Not moving. No coat, just her blouse and skirt from before.

I’m watching her for a minute, weirded out, when I hear this “yoohoo” from the left of me. I turn, and again, I see Mary. Only, not Mary. She looks like Mary, but her clothes are different. Different top and bottom, and a lab coat. She’s hanging out from the overhang of the building, trying to get my attention. So I look at her. Then I look back, down to the treeline where I thought she just was, only there’s nobody there. I get this chill, and notice the smell from before is palpable and thick. Then Mary calls out to me again, asking if I’m coming inside.

I think I must’ve given her a look that sold exactly what I was feeling on the inside, because she asks if something is wrong, and I just say nothing. So, I follow her into her server room. As I do, though, she starts introducing herself. She’s telling me about her history with the CAF and other stuff, and I’m just nodding along, confused. She then confirms my name, and I’m like, yes, that’s me. It’s like, in her mind, it was our first ever interaction. And she’s friendly now, mind you. Civil. Professional. Like a normal person. She again catches on to just how weirded out I was, and asks me if I was alright. So, after a breath, not even mentioning the fact that I could swear I just saw her in another place, I ask her why she was so weird the past two days.

And she looks at me like I’m stupid. She asks what I mean. And then I realize. I’m looking at her, right? It’s the same face. The same girl. But her hair is a good bit longer than it was before. Like, the past two days, it was cropped back pretty aggressively. And now it’s flowing, even a little past where her coat began. It’s a small detail, yeah, but even the same it was noticeable. And her face, I dunno. It was just a little different. Not like a change in makeup, but the composition. The angles. It was just slightly off. The more I looked at her, the more it became clear it wasn’t the same person I had met before.

So, hesitantly, I ask her if it was her first day here, feeling really stupid while doing so, and she says that it was ever since last year, anyways, but she’d been around the site fairly regularly in times previous to manage the database array – the one she was now planning to migrate. And before I even say anything else, she thanks me for getting a head start on deploying the new servers. Yes. The same activity I had done with her – well, more accurately, for her, two days prior. So I feel silly. I’m almost laughing, wondering what the heck had occurred the past two days. Jokingly, but also legitimately wanting to know, I ask if she has a twin sister, and she says no, asking me why I’d bother with a random question like that. I just shake my head.

I’m just kind of wondering, then. I don’t know what to think. She then says she’s not the type to micromanage, telling me I probably knew more about what I was doing than she did. She tells me to get started, and that she’ll be here if I need anything. Supportive. Professional. Everything, all the weirdness of the Mary from the past two days ago was gone. Then she sits down at her desk. I notice, idly, that she doesn’t have her notebook. Realizing that, I think to bug her about it, only instead to interject with something else as I realize I have the weird ring in my pocket.

I place it on the desk, asking if it was hers. She picks it up, examining it, before asking me if she looked like a goth. Confused, I ask what she meant, only for her to say it was hideous, and that she’d never seen it before. She points out, eerily, an etched cross that ran nearly the entire length of the band on the inside of the ring, one I hadn’t noticed. She then asks me where I found it. I didn’t have the mind to tell her it was inside the degausser, so instead I say it was on the ground. She laughs, pushing it back towards me as she brings out her laptop. I guess I just sort of stared at her for a bit, still bewildered at the whole thing, cause she looks at me and asks if there was something else. Realizing I was probably coming off as a creep, I quickly left.

The air outside stunk. Way worse than it had before. I was almost inclined to believe some sort of industrial line had spilled because of how bad it was. It wasn’t so much magnetism and ozone as it was copper and sulfur. Gross and irritating. Anyway, again I look over at the tree line. Nobody there. So I get back to work. There’s only one building left on my sheet, and only three workstations. So I bring over a small cart to grab them all. This one was really small. I couldn’t even tell you its purpose, it was a garage and a small office on one floor with two more offices up above.

I get to the top. The station IDs on my sheet have no hints what floor each computer is on so I get to look around. On the top of the building, I check each office, finding all three devices tucked away in a single room. Since my cart is downstairs with no elevator, I have to take a few trips, one at a time, stacking the workstations on each other. Now, the first two trips are fine. But the third, when I reach the top of the flight of stairs with the computer in hand, there’s this laugh. Almost. It’s like a dry, sick, grotesque heaving coming from the bottom of the stairs. So I freeze. It stops as quickly as it started. There’s no sound of footsteps or anything moving around. None of that. I half expect to see a really sick dog or something when I get down there. But, there was nothing. The cart and other computers were untouched. The smell from before, which was almost nonexistent in that building, mind you, is there, and it follows me along.

Bringing those three back, I rip the drives out, carrying them to the degausser. Now, when I get down there, the machine was running. And the cycle finishes seconds within seconds of me getting inside. I head over, and open it up. Nothing. No drives. Certainly no rings. It had just, apparently, been turned on. Anyway, I pay it no mind. Of course I feel really weirded out, but I just keep working. Run through each drive, before trashing them in a special bin and bringing the machines back up to my palette. Once I wrap it, I had finished up for the day, so I go and check in with Mary.

Seeing her is still bizarre. She’s nice and everything, but the juxtaposition is really screwing with me. After I explain I was gonna head out, she gets from her desk and asks me to come over so she can show me something. I follow her into the maze of servers, and we stop in front of an older piece of hardware. It occurs to me after a second that it was the same device she – well, previous Mary – was at the day prior, when I had found her in her trance like state. So I ask why she’s showing me this, and she grabs something from atop the block of hardware I didn’t even see. It turns out to be the leatherbound, black notebook.

So she starts laughing, telling me to flip through it. As I do so, she’s telling me she had found it tucked in between two servers on the rack. Now, the notebook is literally trash. Like unintelligible chicken scratch garbage. Each page is heavier with ink than the last. It looks like whoever was using it was trying to darken every page with nothing but a ballpoint pen. Sometimes there’s symbols cut out among the scribblings. At least, I call them symbols, but they were just rudimentary shapes. It was just nonsense. Mary, though, finds it humorous. She says it’s the funniest thing she’s seen in a while, especially in a server room. And I might’ve found it funny, too, had I not seen her, or at least, somebody who looks like her, clutching it a few days prior. The day ends. I arrive Thursday. I’m afraid Mary is gonna swap back to the bizarre persona I had seen, but she’s just fine. Pleasant. My work with the old machines are done, and I’m waiting for the new to arrive, so I tell her that I’d be helping with whatever she needs. But her kind of work, rebuilding and converting database schema from proprietary military jargon from old to new, is far beyond my paygrade. So I just sort of talk with her all morning. I don’t bring up the strange events, because I don’t wanna seem crazy. But, even still, that damned smell is around in the server room. Not strong, but noticeable. I ask her about it, and she says she smelled it too, thinking there was going to be a thunderstorm soon.

So it hits around 11:30. Nothing of incident happened. Then Mary sighs, getting up from her station. She says she’s gonna go microwave her lunch, asking me to come eat with her. I say sure, and as she leaves I get up to grab my own bag with my food. I remember the room gets a noticeable bit cooler for a second, as the door shuts behind her, and I swear I picked up another note of that smell from before. Like it just got a little bit stronger. And as I turn around, food in hand, I look back at Mary’s station. And, somehow, she’s sitting there, even though I just heard her leave.

But, it wasn’t her sitting there. It was the version of her I saw on my first two days. Exact same clothes. Shorter hair. And she’s just, lying there. Slouched into the chair. Eyes open, staring at nothing. I remember my face flushing because it was just so bizarre. So, hesitantly, I say, “Mary?” from across the room. And she turns, and looks at me, and it’s the most dead eyed expression I’ve ever seen. I legitimately mean dead eyed. I don’t think I saw her pupils. It was just gross. They were eyes, just not the ones that belonged in a human face. Sickly and weird and just out of place. And then, there’s the briefest flash of movement. The slightest indication she was getting up from her chair. And a second later, I’m on the ground, on my back, the air completely knocked out of me.

When I say the only thing that I could smell was that damned coppery stink, I mean it. As I struggled to pull in air it was the only thing that filled my nostrils. Disgusting and gross. When I finally got myself up, still unaware if I had been struck or rather just collapsed away from whatever it was in the chair, I felt sick. The room was empty. No indication of anything aside from me having been there. Even the rolling chair it was sat in was still as the air. But, lord, it stunk in there. Mary comes back a few minutes later. My intention to follow her to the kitchen in the other building had been lost, and she stands half in the door frame, asking me if I’m coming or not. Then she sniffs, asking jokingly if one of the servers had caught fire, because of how rancid the air was.

So, maybe I should’ve. Maybe I should’ve. But I don’t say anything. How should I put it? Explain to her that a doppelganger of hers was in the room just as she left? That I was interacting with it on Monday and Tuesday? How do I sell that without being sent home and terminated on mental health grounds? The answer is, I don’t. And so I say nothing. I get up, looking at her, and realizing then that she is so different from the thing I saw. Yes, there were slight physical differences like I mentioned before, but Mary – the real Mary – had light to her. Life. That thing was just vacant. Void.

I go eat with her. I just pick around my lunch. I don’t remember how I rationalized it. A delusion of some kind, brought on by stress, I think. Still there was too much to explain. But as I sit there, playing with my fork, I fumble around in my pockets, looking for a way to distract myself. I find the black ring from before. And then I just get this wave. This itching thought. I excuse myself, confusing her, but even still I don’t care. I take the ring with me back to the degausser. And to paint a picture, the stairway to this was in the same building. While not adjacent to the lunch room, it certainly was close, and so Mary knew I was going down there with no hard drives or anything else.

So, when I get down there, I put the ring into the tray. I couldn’t really tell you why. I just do. It’s a mix of wanting to get it off my person, and a pointless effort in trying to rid myself of whatever nonsense was happening. Mary, well, the Mary thing wanted the ring. At least I thought so. So in it went. I placed it in the tray, and started the degaussing cycle. I don’t want for it to finish. I just leave. As I do, though, I turn and see Mary standing right against the stairs. The actual Mary, mind you. She had followed me from the lunch room, and plainly asks what I was doing, as she very well knew I had no disks left to scrub.

I look at her, before deciding to lie. I tell her I set the maintenance cycle on the degausser. Now, this was nonsense. I don’t even know if those giant things have triggerable maintenance cycles. Clearly, she didn’t buy it. She didn’t say anything but she knew I was acting weird at lunch. So she moves past me, over to the degausser. The thing is buzzing as it uses its magnetic nonsense on the contents of the tray. And then, it quiets. Finishing its cycle. Mary has her arms crossed and is looking at me with a bizarre expression. I don’t have the heart to tell her not to open the tray as she reaches down, pulling it out. I see her look for a second, before reaching in and pulling out a ring. A plain, silver ring.

It was totally different. The black was gone. There was no interwoven fibrous texture. Certainly no cross. It was bright and shiny and just a simple, plain old wedding band. She looks at it, before flicking it at me. I fail to catch it, mind you, bending down to pick it up. And, unlike when I had first found the black ring, it’s cold to the touch. Icy. She then jokes that she didn’t know I was married, and I stammer that it wasn’t mine, and then she adopts a bit sterner of a tone and tells me not to put junk in the machine, before leaving.

And so I was left with the bizarrely cold, silver ring. What did I do with it? I placed it back in the tray. Back where I had found the black one. Then I shut the machine, and left. The smell from before is gone, I noticed, though I wasn’t sure if it had even persisted while we were eating lunch. I head back upstairs. Mary had already wrapped up. I look out the window of the kitchen and see her walking to the other building. She stops for a second, looking across the gap of the two buildings, down to the length of woods I had seen her, or the other her, standing at the previous day. Then she keeps moving. I don’t even know why I remember that part. It was odd.

Anyway, beyond being petrified the whole remainder of the day, nothing that creepy happens. Mary is fine, working away. I just sit in the server room with her. We leave for the day, and when we come back the next, a delivery truck arrives at the very same time – the new assets I had to start deploying. So I work on that for the length of Friday. I get all the stations imaged and maybe eight physically out where they should be, before checking in with her. All is well, only, get this, she asks me where the creepy notebook went. Confused, I ask what she meant. Apparently it was gone. She went to check it out, only to find it missing from atop the server rack where she had found it.

And that’s pretty much it. Nothing happens throughout all of the next week. I don’t see anything weird. A single time I did head back to the degausser after finding a really old, unlisted machine that needed to be junked. The ring was gone from the tray when I looked. Kind of a weak wrap up, right? Since then, I did a lot of googling. There’s a few urban legends that intersect with this kind of thing, nothing so purposeful though, and that’s if I assume the Mary of the first two days was something supernatural. With the book, and the ring, assuming they were even related, there was some kind of intelligent intention. That, I’m still sure of. The kind of shapeshifter you see in urban legend rarely speaks, let alone intelligently, let alone being able to operate computers. Knowing technical things. Maybe it was some elaborate prank. I won’t ever know. Somebody out there might. But honestly, missing closure on something like this isn’t all that bad for my peace of mind.
