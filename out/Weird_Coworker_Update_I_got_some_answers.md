The churel is back, but this time, I found her in the last place I ever expected to see her: behind the reception desk at work. 

I froze in place when I saw her. She did a double take, then narrowed her eyes at me. The same thought appeared to be running through both of our heads at once: *'What the fuck are you doing here?'*

I found myself unconsciously touching the scar her teeth had left on my neck, flashing back to the memory of her drinking my blood. Between her and the [long woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/okmYIiRY6T), I honestly should just give up on going to bars altogether. 

I assured myself that the churel couldn't do anything. It was okay. Everything was going to be okay. 

(If you haven't seen my previous updates, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/NWJnO2Gtx1) to see my life fall apart in real time.)

The churel called out to me with exaggerated politeness, "Sir, I need to check your ID badge."

She had a fake smile plastered on her face as she held out a hand for my employee ID. Stomach in knots, I reluctantly held it out to her. Our fingers brushed against each other during the transaction. To my shock, her hand didn't burn. 

Her plastic grin stayed where it was as she chirped, "I've just started here, so please be patient with me! I don't want to make a mistake on my first day, you know?"

The churel's ID badge hung from a pocket on her blue, professional-looking jacket. For the sake of not pissing her off or giving away our employer's location, we'll say that the name on it was Aanya Kaur. 

After studying my badge for a moment, she handed it back to me, cheerfully saying, "Have the day you deserve!"

*Yeah, fuck you, too.*

Of course, I didn't say that. I may not make the best decisions, but I don't have a death wish. Instead, I returned her smile, nodded, and went through the door without daring to take my eyes off of her. In turn, she watched me like a hawk as I departed. 

According to my sixth sense, Ramy was  around the corner in the main hallway. It took a lot of effort not to run there. The placard on the door denoted that he was in a server room. Before I could touch the doorknob, it swung open, revealing a tired-looking Ramy. 

After peeking around to make sure that we were alone, I spoke above the hum of machinery, "Did you see our new receptionist?"

He went back to messing with one of the servers as he replied, "Yup. She'll be back here in a moment."

I balked, "What?!"

"She said she wants to talk." Seeing my expression, he added, "Don't worry. After last time, she knows better than to try anything." 

There was a light knock on the door. When Ramy let Aanya in, she did her best to keep as much distance from him as possible. Meanwhile, Ramy simply went back to screwing with the server, not appearing to notice or care about her obvious unease.  

Aanya got straight to the point, announcing that she wanted a truce. She swore not to lay a hand on me as long as Ramy agreed to leave her alone. Though instead of using my name, she referred to me as Ramy's 'boy toy.' 

Hoping that neither of them could see my face reddening from her humiliating nickname, I got the bravery to utter, "Please don't talk about me like I'm not here."

She spared me a glance, "You got your voice back! Good for you!"

Ramy finally spoke, but didn't bother to stop his maintenance in order to look up at her, "That's all up to him."

I hadn't expected the choice to be mine. At his response, Aanya's jaw clenched as she side-eyed me. I got the impression that she wished that she could tear into me again. 

I questioned, "Will this truce just be at work or... does that also extend to outside?"

"Both, preferably." She replied curtly. "I want nothing to do with this jinn."

I nodded, "I'm think that would be best for all of us. We just... show up, do what we need to do, and leave each other alone."

Aanya hesitated, gathering herself before she said, "For the record, it was nothing personal, jinn. I am being tested, same as you."

Tested? 

Ramy simply waved her off, "Yeah, okay. See you around. Just a heads up though, the coffee here sucks, so you might want to bring your own."

Her brow furrowed and she opened her mouth, but reconsidered whatever it was she was going to say. She threw me one last dirty look before her long skirt rustled, showing a brief glimpse of her backwards feet as she exited. 

After she was gone, Ramy glanced at me, "I'm not trying to be a dick Lab Rat, but I've *really* got my hands full with this, so would you mind leaving me to it?"

I started to oblige, but then paused, gathering as much courage as I could to ask him to come visit the house later. He agreed to it, then kicked me out. 

There was a lot that needed addressed, the most pressing thing being how I could grow up here without any unnatural encounters, yet the moment Ramy showed up, my hometown suddenly seemed to be crawling with horrible things. 

It might sound na√Øve, but I felt like we were at a point in our relationship where I could begin to pry into his world without getting cursed again. At least, I hoped that was the case. If I hadn't told anyone his secrets already (this subreddit excluded), I probably never would.  

It had also become increasingly clear that I couldn't ignore my feelings towards Ramy anymore. I just wasn't entirely sure how. In yet another installment of how pathetic I am, I admit that I have almost no experience with things like this. The closest I've ever come to any sort of 'romance' (and that term is used *very* generously here) were some awkward dates in college that never went anywhere. I don't know if you can count the two times Ramy locked lips with me, considering that they both occurred in relation to the voice theft. 

What do normal people do in situations like this? Do they just... *say* it? Was I overthinking it? I had to have been. This was stupid. I wished I could just put my brain in a bag of rice until it started working correctly. 

By the time my shift was over, I had worked myself up into nervous wreck. Ramy was going meet me at my house after stopping by his apartment. Apparently, his water was back on. This gave me extra time to pace around my living room, unable to stop agonizing. 

You'd think after all that's happened, a simple conversation wouldn't get me so anxious. 

It didn't help that when I turned around to make another nervous lap, Ramy was suddenly *right there.* I almost ran into him, jumping back with a sharp intake of breath, causing me to choke on my own spit. 

He stared at me as if my reaction was outlandish, "You good?"

After I stopped drowning in my own saliva, I rasped, "Just a heart attack." 

Ciri trotted over to him, not startled by his abrupt appearance in the slightest. He scooped her up, cradling her like a baby as she purred. 

Scratching the kitty's chin, he asked, "You wanted to talk, didn't you?"

Unsure of where to start, I picked the first thing that popped into my head, and unfortunately, it was barely coherent, "So, I've lived here for... *ever.* Until I met you, nothing strange has ever happened to me. Now, it's pretty much constant. Like that woman from the bar. That wasn't random, right? It *felt* random at the time, but it wasn't!"

He gave me a small smile, "You're right. That encounter wasn't random. Neither was the one with Aanya."

Out of the blue, Ciri bit Ramy. She does that sometimes. He gave her a disapproving look before setting her back onto the carpet.  

He continued, "Long story short, the entities that reside here are territorial. They aren't too welcoming to newcomers."

That's how I learned that Ramy is 200 years old, which is apparently young for a jinn. 

"So... the old fucks want you to get off their lawn?" I replied, making sure I was understanding correctly. 

Ramy seemed to like that comparison, "Pretty much."

As we all already knew, Ramy had originally come here to satisfy his vendetta against the brothers. However, the entities that dwell here interpreted that as an affront; he had indirectly undermined their claim on the land and its residents. The implication that the mysterious entities he's been referring to felt like they *owned* the people here, myself included, made me feel somewhat sick. 

Without thinking about it, I started pacing again. Ramy settled comfortably on my couch, shining eyes tracing my movements.

As I circled the living room like a caged tiger, I asked, "Alright, if there have been these... *things* living here this whole time, why did I never see them until recently?"

That earned me a smirk, "Oh, you probably have, Lab Rat. You just didn't know it."

I thought back to the woman at the bar. How I could only see what she truly was from the corner of my eye. 

Pushing my discomfort to the back of my mind, I moved on to my next question, "Before Aanya bit me that one time, she said that she could smell you on me. Is that why these things have been coming after me, too?"

He nodded, "You're guilty by association." 

"Okay, so going off of that other shit Aanya said earlier today, was that incident with the long-armed woman in the bar some sort of test?"

"It was, one that I knew you'd pass because I did a *hell* of a job on that wish. As much as I wanted to stop her, and believe me, I *did* want to, that would've given the impression that I wasn't confident in my own abilties."

When I made another pass by him, I suddenly felt his cool hand gently catch my wrist. He advised me to take a deep breath. I obliged him, closing my eyes, trying to get my bearings. His thumb traced delicate circles along my skin, giving me something to focus on besides driving myself crazy. 

After a another heavy exhale, I felt that I had myself as under control as I could be. His hand slid from my wrist as I joined him on the couch. 

"What exactly are *'they'?* The ones you keep mentioning?" I finally asked. 

Ramy shrugged, "Eh, some German spirits, and I've seen a few things from my neck of the woods here and there. It's a diverse mix of jackasses."

"Would it help if I used my last wish to get rid of them?"

He snorted, "That'd be a waste. I can handle anything that comes our way." 

Feeling brave, I retorted, "But for how long? When does it end? When one or both of us dies?"

As unruffled as ever, Ramy answered, "No, it will end, eventually. As long as I can keep on proving that I'm capable of defending us both, which I *will,* they'll back off. If you're that concerned, you can always use your last wish to save yourself. Otherwise, you're just going to have to trust me."

I took my glasses off and rubbed my eyes. As ridiculous as it sounds, I honestly *was* beginning to trust him. Not fully, since I know that at the end of the day, Ramy is arrogant and self-serving, but I truly believe that he does care, in his own way. 

Speaking of caring... I decided it would be best to not to give myself the chance to overthink, causing me to blurt out, "I'm attracted to you."

I remember thinking, 'Well. I *definitely* did not do that right.'

Shows how much I know. The only warning I had was Ramy saying, "It's about fucking time." Before his lips were on mine. 

I'm pleased to report that nothing horrible happened during or after the kiss. No burning blood or tar. Just a kiss. One that I'm not going to stop thinking about any time soon. 

I'm not going to share what else happened that night, so I hope you all can respect that there are some things that I would like to keep private. It has nothing to do with The Horrors anyways, and that's what you're all here for, right? 

And *boy,* have The Horrors found me. 

Before I delve into that, I think it's fair to warn anyone that's sensitive to the topic of lab animals, particularly the death of a mouse, to take caution before reading ahead. I will only touch on it briefly and I won't go into graphic detail, but I thought it best to give you all a heads up. 

My lab coordinator needed someone to go down to the animal facility in order to check on one of the mouse litters. Since the person on first shift is absolutely useless, the task fell to me.  

Unfortunately, one of the mouse pups had been cannibalized by its littermates. This is why I'm glad that I do mostly cell cultures; mice are *vicious* to one another. I placed what was left of the poor thing into a paper bag, as protocol dictates.

 When a lab animal dies, it has to be taken to the post mortem room for proper disposal. The bodies are left in a walk-in refrigerator for the animal husbandry technicians to cremate. Naturally, the walk-in is usually kept closed for obvious reasons. 

But this time, when I entered the post mortem room, the walk-in was wide open. At first, I thought that maybe it was one of the animal husbandry staff, until I heard crunching. 

Protocol be damned, I was *not* sticking around to find out what that was about. 

Cautiously, I started to back out of the room, paper bag still clutched in my hand. The crunching continued. Whatever it was, it didn't know I was there yet. I kept going, not daring to even breathe out of fear that it would alert that thing to my presence. 

I reached behind me, feeling for the door. As soon as my fingers grazed it, the crunching stopped. I froze, listening, hand paused on the handle. The clopping of what sounded like hooves on the tile floor echoed throughout the room as whatever was in the walk-in started to come out. 

A whispery, childlike voice drifted from the open walk-in, *"I can help you."*

Hair standing on end, I slammed the door shut and darted away. At some point, I must have dropped the bag, but in my haste it became an afterthought. I turned a corner as I heard the door slam against the wall, followed by the stomping of hooves. I passed a room labeled 'chemical storage' that required an ID card to enter. I scanned my badge, almost cheered when the card reader turned green and beeped, then ducked inside. 

Despite having a locked door between us, I still didn't feel safe. Without turning the lights on, I read the labels on various bottles, looking for something that could be useful. I found a bottle of 10N sodium hydroxide. If you've never used this before, just know it burns like hell when it gets on your skin, which is a lesson I learned the hard way in undergrad. I clutched the bottle, hid behind a nearby shelf, and tried to listen for my pursuer. 

The ghastly voice spoke again, "*I'm not like the other one. You can trust me.*"

It was getting close. The next time it spoke, its voice sounded different. More feminine. "*You have nothing to be afraid of.*"

The card reader beeped twice. Whatever was chasing me worked somewhere in the facility. 

Thankfully, two beeps meant that my pursuer's card was denied. Either it didn't read the card correctly or it didn't have the right security clearance. I hoped it was the latter. The door handle rattled impatiently. I clutched the bottle of sodium hydroxide tighter, praying that the hoofed being outside wouldn't break the door down. 

The handle rattled again as the creature rasped, "*You left me a present. A small thing.*"

The mouse pup. *God.* 

What the creature said next made my heart sink, "*But I need more. I need something fresh.*" 

It tried its card again. One beep. *Shit!*

The door opened slowly; I think it did this to make me more nervous. It worked. I began to unscrew the cap on the sodium hydroxide, steeling myself as I watched it step into the room through a gap in the shelf. 

Grey, donkey-like hooves poked out of green scrubs. The uniform for animal husbandry staff. 

"*Your heart is beating so hard.*"

My muscles stiffened, both from fear and anticipation, as its hooves tapped next to the shelf. I took in a shaky breath before I jumped up, swinging the sodium hydroxide in a wide arc. It splashed on the creature's face. 

Its face changed in front of my eyes. At first, it looked like a young woman, but as it cried out, its mouth morphed into a cat-like snout, revealing sharp, yellowing teeth. It clutched its eyes, howling in what sounded more like rage than pain. 

I shoved past it on my way out the door. Blinded, it grabbed for me, missed, and stumbled into the shelves. 

"*I can hear every breath you take, you piece of shit!*" It roared, it's voice now unnervingly deep as its hooves pounded on the tile after me. 

I ran for my life. The hoofed creature continued to berate me, insisting that it could find me wherever I went. Thankfully, with it being blinded and disoriented, it had a hard time navigating the hallways, but even so, it was *fast.* Distantly, I noted that the back of my right hand was stinging. Some of the sodium hydroxide must've splashed on me. 

I crashed through the door out of the animal facility, making a beeline for the stairwell. My lungs were burning by this point, but I kept pushing myself, getting to the second level faster than I ever have before. My lab and the IT room were on the third floor. Just one more to go. 

The echo of the thing's hooves bounced off the walls of the stairwell, making it hard to judge how close it was without risking a glance over my shoulder. 

By the time I reached the third floor, I was exhausted, panting, legs feeling like wet noodles. But still, I kept going, knowing that Ramy would be in the IT office. I expected the door to the stairwell to fly open at any second, but it never happened. 

It looked like Ramy was in the middle of a conversation with the other IT guy, but as soon as he saw the state I was in, he went to me without explanation, leaving his coworker incredibly confused. 

He helped me get to the bathroom so I could rinse the sodium hydroxide off. The skin was a deep shade of red, but thankfully, it didnt blister. It's probably going to peel off later. Can't wait. 

Still trying to catch my breath, I eloquently explained what happened, "Animals... hooves... it-it's down there! It's *eating* them!" 

Ramy's hand was on the small of my back, calming me as he studied the chemical burn. "It doesn't look that bad."

Since this wasn't my first caustic burn, I already knew that I had to rinse it for twenty minutes. In the meantime, Ramy asked his coworker to stay with me with the excuse that he was going to get the first aid kit. I sensed that he was in the animal facility shortly afterwards. 

Once we were alone again and my hand was taken care of, Ramy informed me that he didn't find the hoofed creature. It must've known he'd be coming for it. 

As of right now, I'm safe at home, all gauzed up. It hurts to move, but again, this isn't my first chemical burn. And as far as injuries go, it could be worse. 

I've only just started looking into it, but so far, I think the hoofed creature is another type of jinn.
