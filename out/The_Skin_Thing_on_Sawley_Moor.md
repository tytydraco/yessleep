I trudged up the winding path to Sawley Moor with my fathers’ ashes cradled against my chest. The winter wind bit at my cheeks, carrying the distant cry of a lone curlew across the heather. Each step I took, the frozen ground crunched under my boots as if the moor itself was whispering a warning. A silvery frost was already creeping over the tufts of grass and the rough stones lining the path, glinting in the last light. I had been away from Sawley for years, living in the city, and perhaps I’d forgotten how the moor can play tricks on the mind. 

Evening was coming on fast, washing the sky in bruised purples and dark greys. I tightened my scarf and tried to ignore the uneasy feeling twisting in my gut – I told myself it was just the chill and my grief.

A rough stone fence lined part of the trail, its ancient posts sticking up like the worn teeth of some giant. On one of those posts, something fluttered in the corner of my eye. I paused and saw a strip of cloth tied there, flapping in the wind. It was stained a rusty red brown. A bloodied rag on a fence. The sight of it made me shiver, and not from the cold.

••

I hadn’t seen one of these in years. The last time must have been when I was a child, when old Mrs. Pritchard hung a lambs blood soaked rag at her gate after her dog was found dead.

Back then, I hadn’t understood – it seemed a gruesome, senseless thing to do. But everyone in the village knew what it was for, even if they never spoke it aloud. It was a ward, a warning, and perhaps and offering.

I took a shaky breath and moved on. The urn in my arms felt heavier with each step. *Focus on Dad* I thought. *You’re here for him.* My father had wanted his ashes scattered on this moor, on the high ground overlooking the valley. It was his favourite spot in the world. He used to bring me here on long walks and admire the view when I was younger, in brighter, carefree days – long before the stories sank their claws into me.

Now he was gone, and I was fulfilling his last wish.
Yet even as I walked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was not alone. The superstitions I’d tried to leave behind with my childhood were now making their way back, unbidden, from the darkest corners of my memory.

••

Growing up, *The Legend of Sawley Moor* was an intricate tapestry that wove into our lives. We rarely spoke its name in daylight. In whispers at bedtime or scary stories at sleepovers, we called it ***The Skin Thing.***

The older folks, like my grandparents, used a different name when they thought I wasn’t listening. *Fien Beorh*, they hushed, their voices trembling over strange and ancient pronunciation.

I remember the first time I heard that word. I was 10, playing beneath the pub’s oak table while my dad and Mr Grainger shared pints and stories above. They spoke in a serious, low tone about a hiker who had gone missing and how *“the Fien-Beorh walks in winter”.* I didn’t understand them, but that word burrowed into my mind like a splinter. Even at 10, I could hear the tremor in their voices as they spoke, and that frightened me more than any ghost story ever could.

••

The legend was older than any of us, some say it dates to Anglo – Saxon times, that the *Fien-Beorh* was a name from a forgotten tongue meaning something like *“flayed skin on the hill”.* Others claimed it was an old folktale to keep children indoors and off the moors at night. But I think we all knew it was more than a tale.

Everyone had a story. I remember Mr. Trumble stumbling into the pub, ashen faced after finding out that his prize ewe was found flayed in his field – he swore to God that no fox or hound could have done such a thing.

Others whispered of darker happenings: a travelling salesman who vanished one winter, leaving only a bloodied scrap of his coat on a thorn bush; eerie echoes and cried coming from the mist when the nights were long and moonless. Too many strange things happened on the moor for it to be dismissed as the imagination.

I could almost hear those old whispers riding in the wind as I walked. The heather snagged at my ankles and the gorse rustled as if there was something moving inside. I remembered the half-forgotten rhyme we used to tease each other with as children:

***”Fien-Beorh, Fien-Beorh, out on the moor,***
***Patchwork skin and nothing more.***
***Hide your heads and bar the door,***
***Or he’ll come at night to settle the score.”***

We never knew what the “score” was, but the words alone would send us into fits of terrified giggles. We would recite the rhyme in a sing song fashion, secretly hoping not to be the last to finish the final line – because that was our game, the last one to speak it might catch the Skin Things eye. I can still recall my friend Sam’s face, pale as milk and he hurried through the words one night by torch, desperate not to be last.

••

Every village has its traditions, it’s ways of warding off whatever lurked on the moors. I recall helping my grandmother with an odd task on a cold winter night, I must have been no more than 7. We crept out to the back garden; she carried a small bowl filled with milk and ashes from some moor flowers. I watched her kneel and pour it out along the fence line, her old hands steady despite the weather. I tugged at her wool coat and asked why

*“For peace, darling.”*

Grandma whispered, *“We leave milk for peace.”*
At the time I thought she meant peace for the world or our ancestors, or to soothe wandering spirits on the moors. Only later did I make the connection: ash mixed with milk, life and death combined – an offering to the restless soul wearing stolen pelt. *The Fien-Beorh.*

Other kids experienced the same thing, my friend Chloe’s mum made her tie red ribbons on her front gate every Halloween – a happy sight that took on a more eery tone by nighttime.

*“Red to remember the blood.”* She told me, parroting her parents.

••

And then there were the carvings. In my old secondary school, nearly every desk had a scratch, or a symbol etched into it by several generations of terrified kids. Most were just initials or crude drawings, but the one carving on my desk always scared me. It was a terribly etched figure with what looked like crisscross pattern on it, underneath read the word **“SKIN”.**

I used to trace that carving with my fingertip during long lessons, heart pounding as I imagined what inspired a child from years past to draw it. I wasn’t the only one who found reminders of the legend in the most unexpected places – on a mossy stone by the creek, the oak on the village green burned into the bark, there were similar carvings. We all grew up under the shadow of the *Fien-Beorh’s* patchwork coat, whether we accepted it or not.

For years I slept with the curtains drawn tight. Even then, I’d sometimes snap awake, convinced I could hear scratching at my window or saw a tall, crooked shadow lurking in our garden. I never knew if those glimpses were real or fake, tricks of the moonlight on my young, terrified mind – but I would never dare to look twice.

••

As I neared the top of the moor, I walked past a crooked Hawthorn that was locally infamous in local story telling. It branches were covered from root to branch in faded cloth, many so old they were disintegrating. Some were just coloured ribbons left by the hopeful *(that was one story at least)*, but the others… they were different. 

There was one dangling piece of tartan wool, dark with what looked like old blood. It swung in the breeze gently as I approached, almost calling me closer.

I thought of everything, the bloodied rags, the stories. They were superstition or decoration, they were appeasements. The idea was that if you offered blood, usually animal blood, the Skin Thing would take that rather than taking something (or someone) else.

A chill went through me as I recalled how Mr. O’Connor, the butcher, always splashed blood on his doorstep after slaughtering a hog, muttering a prayer under his breath as he did so.

The sky above was losing light, the sun a faint glow buried behind the clouds. In the distance, I noticed an odd shape protruding from the earth: the old stone cairn that locals simply called The Sentinel. 

My father once told me it was a Bronze Age marker or a burial mound—one of many ancient graves scattered on these moors. Folks around here had a knack for tying every weathered rock and lonesome tree to the legend somehow. Some claimed The Sentinel was where the Flen-beorh crawled out of the ground ages ago, born from a cursed burial. 

Others said it was just the place where a witch had been interred upright, the stone pile meant to pin her down. Either way, it was an omen of sorts—if you saw a crow perched on that cairn at dusk, it meant something bad was coming. I quickened my pace, eager to finish my task before true dark set in.

Not far from The Sentinel, along a bend in the path, I nearly stumbled over something in the grass. Steadying myself, I looked down and my stomach lurched. There, nailed to a fencepost, was the hide of a hare, dried and stiff. The poor creature’s skin had been staked up, the fur still on it, fluttering slightly. It looked recent; I could see dark, sinewy bits where the skin had been torn off. My throat tightened. 

This was no common sight—this was a warning, or perhaps a desperate offering. Someone in the village must have had a scare. Maybe a lamb gone missing, or a calf found mutilated. These were signs that the *Flen-beorh* had been roaming.

I forced myself to swallow the rising bile and pressed on. I tried to focus on the sound of my breathing and the weight of the urn in my arms, on the simple, sacred duty I was here to perform. But the moor was alive with reminders that tonight was not just any night. 

The wind had died to an unnatural hush; no owls hooted, no fox barked. It was as if the creatures of the heath had buried themselves to hide from a predator, leaving me the only living thing daring to move in the open.

••

At last I reached the spot: a gentle slope of the moor that my father favored, marked by a solitary stone jutting up from the earth like a stoic sentry. From here, I could see the outline of our village far below—warm lights beginning to flicker in cottage windows, promising comfort and safety. 

I knelt by the stone and set down the urn. My hands were trembling as I worked the lid off. *“I’m here, Dad,”* I whispered, my voice barely carrying over the moaning wind. *“Just like you wanted. Home on the moor.”* 

My eyes stung, tears threatening, as I tipped the urn. Ashes, lighter than I expected, poured out onto the cold ground and caught on the breeze. The grey flakes twirled and danced away over the heather. I could almost imagine it was my father himself becoming part of the landscape he loved—free at last, a sweet release from the pains of the world.

I stayed there a moment, head bowed, thinking of the man my father was. Stubborn and strong, with a deep love for these hills. He’d never let fear rule him, not even the fear of the Skin Thing that haunted so many of us. In fact, he rarely acknowledged it. 

Once, when I was a teenager, brash and curious, I asked him if he believed in the Flen-beorh. He had fixed me with a hard stare and said, *“I’ve lived here all my life and never seen it. Sometimes stories are just stories, son.”* But then he added in a softer tone, *“Still, mind you respect the moor, and what’s on it. There’s more to this place than we know.”* That line always stuck with me. A refusal to believe, tempered by a cautious reverence—just in case. I think now that was his way of admitting some part of him wondered, even if he’d never say so outright.

Now here I was, alone on the moor at nightfall, hoping my cautious respect would be enough. The urn was empty. I sealed it and placed it gently beside the stone. *“Goodbye,”* I murmured. I stood up slowly, knees aching from the cold and the weight of the moment.

••

Just then, a sound cut through the silence—a low, distant ***[keening](https://youtu.be/vgts7_b1JWY?si=oXyGF2I0hShkOHGy)***. It was a horrible sound, like wind through a cracked door coupled with a high-pitched moan. Every hair on my neck stood up. I knew that sound. God help me, I had heard it once before, years ago, on a night when a hot-tempered neighbor died in a drunken brawl. The very evening the man was buried, a wail like this swept over the moor, setting all the dogs in the village to howling. The old men whispered the next day that it was the *Flen-beorh* mourning… or celebrating the arrival of a fresh angry soul.

I spun around, my boots scuffing the frozen earth. The light was almost gone now, just a dim ember glow on the western horizon. I squinted toward where the sound seemed to come from—the direction of The Sentinel cairn. 

For a long moment, I saw nothing but shifting shadows and the outline of the cairn against the sky. The wailing had stopped, leaving an oppressive quiet in its wake.

And then I saw it. At first, I thought my eyes were tricking me. A darker shadow among the shadows, moving. About thirty yards away, just beyond a cluster of boulders and gorse, something was standing between two leafless blackthorn bushes. 

It was tall—taller than any man—its form gaunt and oddly misshapen. My breath caught in my throat. I wanted to believe it was a deer, or the twisted stump of a tree, or anything familiar. But then it lurched forward with a jerky, unnatural gait, stepping into a patch of weak moonlight.

••

In the gloom, I glimpsed pale, sickly flesh reflecting the faint light—too pale for an animal, and arranged in irregular patches. It looked as if someone had draped various hides together onto a spindly frame. One arm—if it was an arm—hung longer than the other, jointed in the wrong place, and it was covered in what appeared to be the hide of a deer, patches of coarse hair still visible. The other limb was thinner, almost human-looking, but mottled and fused at the elbow with a different piece of skin, as though sewn together. Its torso was a grotesque quilt of skin and fur—bits of different colors and textures: human tan flesh here, fish-belly white there, a patch of fox-red fur, a tuft of sheep’s wool—all clinging to a lanky, skeletal figure. I couldn’t see its face clearly (praise God for that small mercy), but I caught the glint of an eye reflecting dull red in the twilight. 

Below that eye, a slither of something wet and white—teeth, I realized—peeked out from between loose strips of hanging skin where a mouth might be.

My heart thundered in my chest so hard I thought I might faint. This was real. *The Skin Thing—the Flen-beorh—was real*, and it was here, barely a stone’s throw away. I felt an involuntary *whimper* escape my throat as the creature raised its head slightly, as if sniffing the air. 

Did it smell my father’s ashes? Did it smell me? My heel bumped against the empty urn behind me with a hollow *clink.*

The metallic sound rang out sharply across the quiet moor.

In that instant, the creature’s head snapped toward me. 

It saw me. 

*I was sure of it.*

Though its eyes were lost in shadow, I felt its gaze like two icy fingers trailing down my spine. My legs refused to budge, as if the moor itself held me in place.

In that breathless moment of terror, I understood that every whisper and rhyme had spoken the truth. The legend of Sawley Moor stood before me in hideous flesh—and now it had fixed its hungry eyes on me.
