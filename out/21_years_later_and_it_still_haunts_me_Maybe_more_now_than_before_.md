I’m in my mid 30s now and have a productive career and a family. Gym, books, projects. But no really close friends anymore. But two decades ago I had, and lost, the closest friend I ever had. We were young teens doing what young teenage boys do. Trying to figure out how to score some grass, talking about girls, riding around on bikes, complaining about class etc. We bonded over music and GTA Vice city. 

Pretty standard stuff honestly but at the time it was our whole world. I hated being home at the time. I had issues there. Family issues as well as terrible sleep issues. Constant sleep paralysis. But, the stories from that house may be told another time. My friend, I’ll call him John, and I had seen something once in that house I used to live in. Something that brought on many conversations. Ghosts and the supernatural. At the time the cultural relevance of “shadow people” had not exactly caught on yet. But, in hindsight they have always been there. 

So, one day John and I were out after school riding bikes. He told me about an abandoned house that we could sneak into. We had all seen the big case about the teens breaking into a house and while filming themselves they had trashed the place. It resulted in a court case and fines and all that. I was always scared back then so I said No to going to this house John had mentioned. I regret that I thought he would trash it. He’d get us in trouble. 

I couldn’t handle trouble at my home. Honestly I could barely handle anything back then. I wouldn’t even ride my bike in the street for fear a car would hit me. And, I think that’s why I looked up to John. More than the bonding I mentioned earlier, John was strong. He was charismatic, smart, cunning, and thoughtful. I wanted to be like him at the time. 
Well, after a bit of nagging and joking around with me he talked me into going to this abandoned house he mentioned. We went. Explored around a bit. Nothing of interest. But, it was thrilling. When we left I felt like I was cool. Like I had earned even more of John’s respect. Years later I would find out that at that same time he also looked up to me for the same reasons I looked up to him. 

A few weeks passed after we explored the house and he said he had another one. But it would be more risky. It was an abandoned house directly behind his own home. I was feeling more confident at this point so I said I was game. We couldn’t just go through his back yard and hope a fence though, his next door neighbors might say something to his parents. So we went around the block. This time on foot so we didn’t have to worry about hiding the bikes. I should mention that we live in a city that has large suburban neighborhoods all throughout it. We weren’t out in the woods or anything. 

So we went around the block. From just one street over the atmosphere changed. I felt uneasy, my confidence left me. I carried on with John but I desperately wanted to not just leave here but to go home. Home would have been better than what would transpire. We made it to the house and just stared at it. A two story white house with an overgrown backyard. Nothing special. We did our due diligence and check around the street. Even though it was maybe 4 pm, no one was outside. We continued on by checking this abandoned house’s backyard. Just overgrown grass and a dog chain on a post. But no dog. 

We made our way back around to the front door and check again for people outside. The coast was clear. As we began to turn the know to the front door we both became surprised that it actually turned. I wish now that it hadn’t. As the knob turned we heard the chain in the backyard rustle. We both stopped and check in the backyard to see what had caused that to happen. But, the chain was in the same place it was the first time. Very strange, I thought to myself. But, we were dumb kids. We carried on. 

We opened the front door and entered the house. A staircase was to our left in front of us, a living room to our right. And dead center in front of us was a hallway that would lead to a bathroom, a family room with fireplace, and a garage. Looking back on these events I can not fathom why we never looked in the living room at all. It was there. Plain as day. But, it also wasn’t there. Like a blind spot on the edge of our eyes. We were here to explore. But that room was left untouched. I don’t have an explanation for this. And that might be for the best. 

John made his way down the hallway that lay in front of us. He made it to the end of the hallway and was standing in front of the bathroom. I followed him, unprompted. I still wanted to appear strong and confident even though my heart was already racing. We turned right and walked to the garage. We figured that garages have tools, maybe a gun or some weed in a dad’s left behind tool chest. Who knows what we could find. Just the thought and some passing words about the potential prospects perked us both up. I hadn’t realized it at the time but John was also not his same cavalier self. We entered the garage and the brief moment of joy died instantly. 

The garage had a full red tent to the lighting. The windows had read tissue paper on them, casting in red stained light. An old beat up looking chair sat in the middle of the garage. No tools were left. Nothing worth taking. A fridge sat in a corner. We opened it and just saw a pair of rusty pliers sitting on a shelf. We closed the fridge and left the garage. We kept the door open though. We made our way down the the family room which would be on the opposite end of the house from the garage, also on the first floor. A completely empty room that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the 80s. Wood panel walls and brown carpet with a beautiful  red brick fireplace. 

Inside the fireplace was something though. An old cardboard box of Tide detergent. John once again perked up, “maybe money” he exclaimed. He opened it and jumped while dropping the box. A small dead black bird rolled out onto the floor along with some jacks. For those that don’t know what I mean by jacks, I mean like the pieces that you would use to play jacks were you bounced a ball and swiped up jacks that were also on the floor. Small pointy metallic objects all with different colors of paint on them. 

I stated to John that I felt like someone put the bird and the jacks into the box to shake it around until the bird died. He said I was full of shit and didn’t know what I was talking about. We moved on. The bathroom at the end of the hallway was out next stop. It stunk. Just a normal bathroom, but the newspaper that rested by the toilet stood out. I looked at the date and it was dated about a week prior to this day. “I thought you said this house had been abandoned for years, John?” He looked confused, “it has been, must be a squatter or some contractor left it behind after doing some work. A contractor would explain the random chair, the pliers. He probably just found the dead bird and put it in the box like he was collecting trash.” 

I nodded in agreement. I didn’t know what to think though. I told him I wanted to leave. He agreed, but not before we checked the upstairs. As if the house was in sync with our thoughts we heard a radio turn on upstairs. At this point we KNEW we where the only people inside this house. But we also knew that we might not be entirely alone. Stupidly we both walked down the hallway and started to walk upstairs. The radio wasn’t playing music but instead was playing the muffled sounds of a little girl complaining to her parents that her brother had ripped the heads off of all of her toys. The girl on the radio then began to cry and sob. The closer we got to the radio the louder it became until it was almost unbearable. The crying turned to screaming which then turned to a static roar. 

When we reached the radio it was not plugged in. Quickly, I thought, I’ll check for batteries. There were none. John and I both looked at each other in disbelief and panic. Then the radio instantly stopped. Almost with a snap. By this point I was sweating. The upstairs of this house had an open area at the top of the stairs with countertop space. This open area also acted as a kind of hallway which lead to what I assume were three bedrooms. 

We were no longer interested in finding trinkets or anything. Now we just wanted answers. Anything to help make sense of this. We tried each of the three “bedroom” doors but none of them opened at all. They didn’t even budge. So we started walking downstairs to leave. We had enough of this. Right before we exited the front door, John said he had to pee. I told him to hurry it up. He walked down to the bathroom and did his business. As he was finishing I heard the doors open from upstairs and he heard it too. He started panicking and shaking at this point. This was his last straw. I couldn’t move. I was petrified. 

John exited the bathroom and then stopped and looked down to the family room. Because I was next to the front door I couldn’t see what he saw. But, then he turned and looked at me and a tear trailed down his cheek. Then every open door in the house slammed shut all at once making an echoing cracking sound. More tears ran down his face. He couldn’t move. I surprised myself this day though. I found my strength. I don’t know from where as I thought of myself as a coward. But I walked down the hallway, I was sure I was going to die-but from what I don’t know-and I grabbed John’s wrist and walked him out of the house. 

John didn’t say a word. He just had tears rolling down his cheeks. But, he wasn’t flushed or red in the face at all. He was pale as a ghost. He walked home after that without saying a word. I made it home too to. He and I continued on with school over the months. We never talked about that house. He dropped out of Highschool. We, at the time of this story were both athletic and only smoked some green from time to time. But, John got into opiates. Then he got in to meth. 

Years later while working for a supermarket I saw him. He had put on about 100 pounds. Looked dead inside. He was excited to see me, and I him. I didn’t even think about that house when I saw him. I was just so happy to see my old friend. We exchanged phone numbers , as we now had cell phones at this point. 

We figured out a day and I came over to his apartment. At this point I was in my early 20s. He was too but looked like late 30s. We caught up and had some beers. Laughing and all that. But something seemed off. No shoes inside his home, no big deal. Use a coaster for the beer, alright no worries. Don’t lean against the wall or it’ll smudge, alright then. All these things are perfectly reasonable. It is his home after all. 

John had a cute girlfriend there. She was very nice to me too. But she seemed unhappy. She seemed bothered and distant, like she wanted to leave. We began talking about one of my own events in life, I can’t remember what exactly and mid conversation he stops. John gets up and just starts vacuuming his carpet. His girlfriend storms off out of the living room. John vacuums for five minutes straight. 

John apologizes. I say it’s no big deal of course. Then I have an idea. “Hey, remember when we were kids and we broke into that abandoned house behind your…” John stops me mid sentence, “No. I don’t want to fucking talk about that ever. I never want to think about that place ever again. And, you probably need to get going anyways. Let’s call it a night”. I nod my head and brush it off. He won’t shake my hand but he gives me an elbow bump like we are fry cooks and I depart. 

A few weeks pass and we talk a couple times on the phone and try to set up another time to hang out. But he stops responding. I left it alone. I was also dumb in my 20s, probably still am, but I knew to stop digging. That was the last time I ever saw him. 
I think about that house all the time. How it ate my friend. How it stole my sleep. How I’ll never have an answer to that house. I’ll never know what he saw. What broke him. What broke him?

I’ll never know. I could dig more and maybe find out. Or, my digging could cause him to spiral out of control again. Or, maybe at this time he would be completely fine with telling me everything I wanted to know and maybe it would break me. I have guilt over this. I can’t exactly explain why. But, I know it’ll stick with me until the end.
