 

In my city, there aren’t a lot of good “ghost hunting” places. I guess you could go hang around at the cemetery after midnight or try to summon a demon through an antique mirror, but as far as local urban legends go, we’re sparse over here.

However, one paranormal hotspot we do have is the abandoned group home centre. As far as I’m aware, for several years it was the home of adults often with severe intellectual disabilities or complex medical needs that their family was unable to care for. It closed when I was in middle school. I only remember this because it caused quite a controversial stir when it was closing. People feared for the lives of those who stayed at the facility. Where would they go? 

It closed anyway. As for all who lived there, well, I’m not sure what happened to them all. I hope they found their specialized care through somewhere else or someone else. Really, I can’t tell you what happened after it closed. All I know is that it closed. I was probably 12 or 13.

The facility has been abandoned since. It now has a significantly tall barbed wire fence around the perimeter like a prison. The building itself is covered in leaves and bird shit. Windows are cracked. Litter blown though the openings in the fence is scattered all about. Beer cans have been thrown onto the property. The front half of a stolen bike almost seems to be decomposing among the litter. It’s a mess. The city seems to have just... completely left this old place to the mercy of the elements. No rebranding or refurbishing plans in sight. Just an abandoned facility that no one wants to take claim of.

My dad likes to walk his dog around that area because he can let him off leash to run around. I like to go for walks with him because it’s always a joy to get to visit with the dog I lived with before I moved out. My dad will swing by and pick me up at my place and then we’ll go take puppy out for a romp.

It’s kinda creepy being over there. Even though the property is protected by an enormous fence, I sometimes shudder with chills when I look past the fence. In the confines of the barbed wire fence, there is a swing set. Two swings. I guess maybe when folks lived there, they could go outside and swing for a while. Not a bad idea. Sometimes though, I find myself staring too long at the swing set, mentally daring the swings to start moving on their own as if occupied by a ghost. Once I freak myself out bad enough, I go back to playing with the dog, who is completely clueless to the abandoned facility and just excited to be outside sniffing and running around off leash.

Only once did I visit that area by myself. No protection from my dog or my dad. Just me. 

The reason I was there was rather mundane. See, my friend’s new album was coming out and he needed a cool cover photo for it. He wanted to stick with a creepy theme. His artist boyfriend sketched him a bunch of different evil jack-o-lantern faces and skulls with worms coming out the eye holes and stuff, but that “wasn’t quite the vibe he was going for.” His words. Instead of sketches or doodles, he thought it would be cool to use a real photograph for the cover. Maybe edit it a bit for the extra creep factor. The boys were brainstorming. Maybe they could take a picture of their black cat? Maybe they could deck someone out in SFX makeup? Maybe they could add red food colouring to a puddle outside to make it look like blood?

The old abandoned facility was my idea. Having not grown up in the city, they didn’t even know about this place! I told them I’d be glad to go down there and snap some photos and they could decide if they wanted to use them. They offered to pay me but I’m no professional photographer by a long shot. I said I’d head down one day after work and see if I could get any cool pics. My friend was thrilled with this idea. He was excited to see how my pictures would turn out. His excitement gave me excitement, and I couldn’t wait for my spooky photography session.

Only a couple days later, I found myself staring through the fence of the facility with camera in hand. I had never been there alone before and there wasn’t a soul to be found. It felt like I was all alone in the world. I started to feel pretty uneasy and nervous. I wanted to get this done as quick as possible. The excitement I had felt had completely dwindled away and been replaced by a primal fear.

I snapped a couple pics of a cracked window. Took a shot of a crow perched on the railing. Then, I had an idea. Maybe I could get some pics of the swing set. Something about the innocence of a swing set contrasted with the rotting and decaying abandoned building behind it.. yeah, that seemed like it would make for a good creepy album cover.

Once I got over to the other side of the building where the swings were, I noticed one of them slightly swaying. Just the one. The other one was still.

This didn’t immediately creep me out. I mean, it could’ve been the wind, a bird could’ve perched on it and then flew off, some bolts and chains could’ve been loose, it could’ve been a million things.

But as I watched and prepared my camera, it began to swing, well, more obviously. As if someone was on it.

It’s the wind, right?

But then why was the second swing not affected?

I watched the swing for a good couple minutes. I didn’t get any photos with the camera in my trembling hands. During those two minutes, I watched intently as the swing would move back and forth as if in use, then suddenly pause as if the occupant dug their feet into the sand to depart. This happened several times. It really truly did look like someone was playing on it, but today they decided to wear their cloak of invisibility or something. 

Like I said, this lasted a good couple minutes, and in those minutes, I did not get one single photo of the swings. The hair on the back of my neck was at attention. At that point, I planned to head back around to the other side of the building, see what else I could snap, then take the hell off. My shoes crunching the leaves underneath my feet, I walked back around. The crow had flown away but the cracked window was still present as ever. I took about five pictures that looked like exact copies of pics I had already taken there. My creativity was running dry.

Then, something was..... purple.

The purple colour stood out from the plain greys and browns of the rest of the property. It was a pop of colour, hard not to notice. I wondered how I hadn’t noticed it earlier. 

Since I do not have the eyesight ability of a hawk scrounging for a mouse to eat, I used my camera to get a closer look at this purple object. I zoomed in real close and studied the camera screen. It was hard to see with my naked eyes but looking into the screen, it was obvious that this was a little purple coin purse with a button clasp. So, that’s not super scary. Just an innocent little coin purse among the death and decay that surrounded this place. Maybe some poor child lost it when their bully of an older brother whipped it over the fence.  Poor kid. I bet they lost a whole 75 cents that day.

My pictures were taken and I was ready to head ‘er. Even though I was a bit spooked, I felt that the photography session had been a success. Maybe one of my photos was soon to become an album cover! I hoped my friend liked them!

I turned around, back facing the abandoned facility, and walked no more than five steps before something soft and light hit my shoulder. It didn’t cause pain. It was just, sort of, a little tap. My initial thought was that a crow had just shit on me.

I did a quick shoulder examination and determined that I was indeed shit-free. I spun around so I was again facing the abandoned facility. Everything looked the same as it did before and everything looked to be in order until, wait, what is this?

The little purple coin purse lay at my feet. It had somehow made its way over (or maybe through?) the fence and was now... here. 

You ever seen those horror movies with the really dumb characters? You know, like the ones that go “oh, I heard a noise downstairs, better go check it out!” Or “I don’t know who this masked hitchhiker on these back country roads is but I’ll give him a ride!” You’re watching this and just thinking to yourself, if that character had just gotten the fuck outta’ there, this would never even have to be a horror movie.

I think I’m a dumb horror movie character, because I squatted down to the ground and picked up the little purple coin purse. Something was inside, so I unbuttoned it and poured out the contents. Two simple dice fell out. By some chance, I had unintentionally rolled doubles. I had rolled 2 ones. Snake eyes. I’m not much of a card player. Is that supposed to be good luck or bad luck? 

Whatever. I carelessly flung the purse back over the fence. The dice remained on the ground where I had poured them. I didn’t care much about them. Again, I started walking away. I’d had enough of this creepy old abandoned ghost hunting hotspot. 

My camera was feeling heavy in my hand. Well, that’s no problem. This is why they make neck straps for cameras. I’d just wear it like a necklace so I wouldn’t have to carry it. 

I know my neck strap was attached when I had got there and I didn’t have any memory of taking it off. Even so, I found my neck strap missing from my camera. And, once again, I turned back around and walked towards the facility that just couldn’t seem to get enough of me. I walked the perimeter of the fence eyeing the ground for my missing strap.

It wasn’t on the ground. It was kind of wrapped around and intertwined in the chain link fence. All I had to do was pull it off. Weird how I didn’t remember putting it there though. I don’t even know why I would’ve taken it off in the first place. 

Squuueeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaak.

The swing was swinging on its own again and making an awfully annoying squeaking sound indicative of a swing set that hadn’t had maintenance in years.

Squuuuueeeeeeaaaaaaaaaak.

Worse than nails on a chalkboard. The sound made me physically cringe. 

I attached the neck strap to the camera, gave it a little tug to make sure it would stay put, and threw the strap over my head. My necklace camera was back. No longer would the heaviness be a pain to carry in hand. 

In bold orange letters, my camera’s neck strap displays its brand proudly. NIKON.

But now there were some other words inscribed into the strap. NIKON was as orange as ever. What were these smaller black letters mere centimetres down from the brand label?

“SNAKE EYES PLAYER DIES” 

You mean like... the snake eyes I had accidentally rolled when I poured the dice out of the purple purse. Snake eyes.. player dies? Was I the player?

Out loud, not to anyone specific, I shouted “I’M NOT PLAYING!”

At that exact moment, a frail old woman walking her way home with a couple bags of groceries met my eye. My shout had startled her. She hesitantly asked me if I was okay. I told her I was fine. She seemed relieved that she didn’t have to deal with me.

I watched her for a little bit while she walked away. Not to be a creepy stalker or anything, but because I was standing there undoing my camera’s neck strap. Once detached, I read the words again.

SNAKE EYES PLAYER DIES

I dropped the strap on the ground, clutched my heavy camera close to my chest, and ran like hell. Sorry dad, I don’t think I can come for a walk this week.
