As much as I hated to admit it, I was lost.

My map, or rather, my phone was dead and soaked. Any marker ribbon I had attached to some of the trees on my way in must've blown away with this morning's heavy winds. All while I was now aimlessly walking through the swamps and shrubs desperate to find my jeep and get the hell home. All the trees looked the same, too. 

All I wanted was a simple bushcrafting trip for a night. While that went well, I must've taken a wrong turn on my way out the next morning. 

The only vantage point I could make out was a watchtower maybe an hour away on foot. Since retracing my steps in this fucking maze of a swamp. I had about forty-five minutes of sunlight left if I was to wager, so I upped my pace through the bogs. It was my best bet, and best case scenario there'd be a ranger positioned there to save my ass.

If that wasn't bad enough, something knew I was lost, and it was following me. 

Whatever it was, it was far too heavy to be something like a deer. Maybe a large boar? Didn't think lots of them were here in Michigan. I could hear it in the distance behind me, splashing as it stepped into the creeks. 

Thinking it may of been another person, I called out to it.

"Hello!?"

My voice echoed across the swamps, and only silence answered me. Nothing scurried away in the distance like some animals would. Was I hearing things? I had my gun loaded and in my hands afterwards and pressed on.

Every ten minutes a branch would snap, something would cross through a creek, but it never closed the distance. It was stalking me, my hair stood up on end. I fired a shot in the air, that's when I noticed something strange.

No ducks or birds cleared out after I shot my rifle. It's like nothing else at all was living in the area. I was alone. 

I was alone with something following me. I heard it run after I shot, but it didn't seem to run away, but circling me like it would flank me.

"I'm warning you! You don't want this!" I yelled out. I got nothing in response once again.

I decided after nearly an hour of being on edge I'd sprint as soon as I had a clearing. 

It was all swamp water ahead, and I recklessly charged through it. I admittedly made a lot of noise. If this thing was to follow me, it would no doubt come into the water and I'd be able to see it coming, and deal with whatever was following me. 

I was completely drained after wading through water for twenty minutes as fast as I could. I stopped for a breather on some dryer land. I was almost out of water. If I were to drink any water from the swamp here, I'd get sick in a day or so. 

Something was in the water, ever so distant. I got the rifle ready just in case. There were still so many trees, but eventually I saw *something.*

It was large and hairy, and darted between two trees in the distance. I couldn't make out much, and it certainly didn't have the proportions of a bear. I fired another shot and ran for it. The watchtower wasn't too far now, looming in the closing distance every clearing I could see it through. 

As I was loosing sunlight, the noises of something behind me persisted. It sounded slightly closer than before.

Then I heard it bellow. It sounded like a bear grunt mixed with a human groan at the end. It sparked my adrenaline into overdrive and I managed to run nearly the entire rest of the way.

I puked from the exhaustion upon reaching the base of the watchtower. I mustered up the last sliver of stamina I had and made my way up the stairs. To my luck, the door at the top was open. I quickly ran inside and slammed the door behind me. I frantically scrambled to lock the door while I processed how loud that slam probably was. That thing would've heard that. 

There was power in here, and a cup of lukewarm coffee sitting by the comms system. Someone was here at least today. Sure they'd be pissed that a squatter was inside, so I made the conscious effort to signal for help. A phone right next to the door seemed like the simplest way to reach someone. It dialled in the number for me and began ringing. 

"Hello? Come in?" a calm voice answered the phone.

It wasn't time to celebrate yet...I heard the noise from the creature at the base of the tower.

"TRACK THIS SIGNAL!" I demanded. "SOMETHING IS OUT HERE! I'M STRANDED AND SOME MONSTER IS HUNTING ME DOWN!"

I peeked out the window and looked down below which made me lose my cool even more.

A large humanoid creature with horns, covered in matted fur was prostrate on the ground. It was sniffing and examining the vomit that I had involuntarily left there. It had long arms with an extra bend, and the light from the tower that automatically turned on reflected off its red eyes. I don't think it noticed me. I ducked away from the window. 

"Oh god it's here..." I whimpered, in case this thing could hear me. "It's below the tower, you gotta save me man I'm so sorry..."

"Stay calm sir, we'll send someone your way. Is anybody else with you?" the dispatch asked me.

"No, someone's been here earlier though the coffee isn't completely cold yet," I forced a chuckle. 

My eyes darted back to the window, the thing was gone. But not gone away.

I saw it walking, circling the tower. It glanced around but not directly upwards. If I were to guess, it was six feet. It's long arms nearly dragged on the ground on its side. It retreated into the woods only to come out again by the base of the tower's stairs. 

I made sure it couldn't see me entirely, pathetically hiding myself with just the top of my head peeking out the window. 

It looked up. It looked up towards me. I bloodstained teeth form into a grin.  I hid back down and prepared myself. I barricaded the door with the heavy chair. I had my gun ready, and began thinking about how my family would feel if I didn't make it out of this. 

Instead, it made that awful sound before retreating into the swamp. I heard the water splash as this thing took off in a frenzy towards something. Whatever it was, I pray that creature didn't find it. 

After maybe half an hour, I saw lights in the distance. It was all dry land beyond the tower, even a dirt road. It was good to know a vehicle could come through to rescue me. 

It didn't take long for the ranger to get inside. It took him very little coaxing to get me out of there. I could see he was armed, and he seemed compassionate to my anxious and terrified state. 

I explained what I saw to him, and he seemed rather dismissive, saying it was probably a sick bear or something. I could see in his eyes, part of him was taking me seriously . Did he see it too? Why would he blow it off if so? 

We made it onto the main road eventually, where I gave my saviour directions back to where I'd parked my jeep. I was on edge the whole way to it, and even in the comfort of my own vehicle driving back home.

Don't get lost when bushcraft camping, you might not believe what's out there. I'm fairly lucky, albeit scarred for life.[I hope others survived it, but more than anything I hope nobody else ever sees it again.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowAwaytheCJ)
