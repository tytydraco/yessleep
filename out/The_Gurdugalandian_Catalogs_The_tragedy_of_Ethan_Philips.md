On the 14th of October of 2006 the Philips family went to visit Gurdugalandia, it was supposed to be a fun getaway from their tiring life in NYC, the happy family landed in JUNGA BUNGA International Airport where they were welcomed by a group of UGUBUGUUS which led them to the car rental booth, Mr Philips showed the worker his reservation to book a car and just like that the family were on their way to Gurdugburdug 5 star hotel and resort.



After a long and boring car ride from the airport the family finally arrived.


As the family entered the hotel they were welcomed by a JUGJUGLUGLUG who took their bags and carried them to the room, Mr Philips went to check in while Mrs Caroline Philips and the 3 kids, John, Arthur and Jimmy explored the lobby, the kids ran and played excitedly while an embarrassed Mrs Philips tried to quiet them down then Mr Philips called


"Cmon yall I got the key!"


The disappointed kids said


"But dad we only just arri-"


Ethan: No buts cmon we're all tired, let's go get some rest, eat and then we can go to the Arcade or the pool to play.

The disappointed kids, with a grumpy and disappointed face said

"Fine"

The family went up to their room and went to sleep,  Mr Philips woke his family up at 7 in the morning while saying 


"Wake up sleepy heads we're gonna miss the breakfast buffet"

The rest of the family slowly got up, brushed their teeth, changed their clothes and went to the hotel restaurant to eat breakfast.


As the family arrived at the restaurant they began filling up their plates and eventually they sat down to eat, John, Arthur and Jimmy all got some fried chicken, or atleast they thought it was fried chicken, as Arthur took a bite he threw away the piece of fried Chicken and started screaming and crying, Ethan picked it up and it was no fried chicken  it was a newborn's decapitated head Ethan gasped in horror he panickly shouted


"EVERYONE MOVE WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS SICK PLACE"


Caroline: What's wrong? Let the kids eat!


Ethan: THE FOOD IS HUMAN FLESH, MOVE!!!!!


The family sprinted out the restaurant in a panic and made their way to the parking lot where they started their car and set a route to JUNGA BUNGA International Airport...



Everyone was terrified!


"What is this horrific place that we got sucked into?"


Said the father with a sense of panic in his voice


"How much longer until the airport dad?"

Said Jimmy with tears in his eyes

Ethan: I don't know, I don't know, just stay calm, we're safe here, we're in the middle of nowhere away from that crazy city, the airport shouldn't be that far just please stay calm

Mrs Philips started reading the children some of their favorite stories to get their minds off the horrific scene that happened a while ago


Mrs Philips: And just like Adrian and Rose the bears got married and lived happily ever aft- AAAAAAAAAA ETHAN

In a quick move a mutilated, stretched horrifying arm broke through the glass and snatched all three kids as Ethan and Caroline tried to fight it but to their despair it barely did a thing, Caroline started crying as Ethan angerly started cursing when suddenly


BAM!!!!!


A creature know as a JURDUGURDUBURDUGA jumped off of the roof of the landing on the ground with the screaming children in its hand, Caroline blinded by the goal of saving her children jumped out of the car and ran towards the 10ft creature screaming at the top of her lungs when suddenly


*SLASH*

With one quick move the horrifying creature slashed off Caroline's head as her husband and Children watched in terror, Ethan tried to run over the creature with his car but it jumped, it jumped over a horrific distance, with one single jump the creature was out of sight...


Ethan sat crying in his car, crying like a child, after all the poor man had lost everything in one single morning, his wife, his kids, his entire life was gone...


It has been almost a week since the horrible incident happened, Ethan was now living off of snacks he brought for his kids when all of a sudden a chopper approached


"We found him I repeat we have found Ethan Philips"

The Philips family didn't tell anyone about their vacation, so their neighbors got worried and filed a missing person's report.


So here is Ethan sitting in the Military chopper getting carried safely to his home in the US, Ethan safely arrived home but he hasn't forgotten the horrors he experienced in Gurdugalandia...


Ethan regularly visited a therapist but it was no help, Ethan eventually got depressed, neighbors reported hearing Ethan sob continously for up to 10 hours...


Ethan eventually went insane and committed suicide on the 28th of June 2008
