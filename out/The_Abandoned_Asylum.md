It was an old asylum that had been lost to time and was hidden away in a jungle. Most people were either unaware that it existed or were too frightened to approach it. The most dangerous criminals and the criminally insane allegedly lived in the asylum before it was closed after a large fire killed everyone inside. Some even assert that the ghosts of the deceased still linger there, seeking revenge from those who mistreated them.

As a thrill-seeker and avid explorer, I couldn't resist the temptation to investigate the abandoned asylum. I didn't believe in curses, despite the fact that it was supposedly cursed. Alex and Rachel, two of my buddies, agreed to accompany me. We prepared our bags with snacks, water, and flashlights before starting our adventure.

We finally arrived at the asylum's entrance after a long and exhausting journey there. We were able to climb over the rusted-shut gate and the crumbling walls to enter the grounds. As soon as we stepped inside, we felt a sense of unease. The silence was oppressive and the air smelled musty.

We proceeded floor by floor, room by room, through the abandoned building. The floors creaked as we walked on them, and the walls were covered in peeling paint. We found old equipment and furniture strewn about, evidence of the asylum's past. However, the further we went, the more we became aware that something was off.

The whispers were the beginning. We initially ignored it as our imagination, but after paying closer attention, we realized that voices were coming from the walls. The words were unclear, but we could still make them out. "Help us," they whispered. "Get out before it's too late."

We made an effort to ignore the voices and carry on with our exploration, but things quickly got worse. Despite turning around after hearing footsteps behind us, nobody was there. The doors automatically shut, enclosing us in areas that we had already explored. The shadows then appeared. They were constantly just out of reach, lurking in the corners of our vision. We couldn't get rid of the feeling that someone was watching us.

At that point, we realized we had to leave. However, when we went to leave, we got lost in a maze of staircases and hallways. The walls seemed to shift and move, and the doors led to dead-ends. We were trapped.

That's when we saw it. Standing at the end of the hallway was the figure in white. We had never seen anything like it before. It had empty eye sockets and a disgusting grin on its wrapped mouth. We felt drawn towards it as it called us in closer.

But we didn't make it.  The ground shook beneath us, and the walls started to fall down before we could get to the figure. Our screams resounded through the corridors as we were engulfed by the darkness. And then there was nothing.

The next day, the authorities found our bags outside the abandoned asylum's gate. They searched the area but found no trace of us. We'd vanished into the madness of the cursed asylum. Some claim that our spirits still haunt the location, warning others to avoid it. However, the majority of people do not believe in such things. They claim we were just stupid kids who got lost in an old building. They, however, did not see what we saw. They weren't aware of any whispers or shadows following them.

It's now been several weeks since the accident occurred, and my phone still mysteriously has internet connection, my friends and I are writing this before anything worse could happen to us, this is not just proof of what happened to us, but a warning, a warning that these paranormal cases are real, and that you should be careful, very careful.
