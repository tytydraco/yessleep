Well, my [last cry for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iyjd12/i_know_for_a_fact_my_best_friend_died_so_why_is/?share_id=SYavoTRoSsZwQ0uTXASOo&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) didn't gain much traction, but that's how it goes I guess. In hindsight maybe it's a good thing, because I've had to do a lot of my own research. Unfortunately, I'm still not really sure what I'm dealing with. 

It’s been quite a wild few days, ending with me sitting here in a Waffle House, scared out of my fucking wits. I'm confident that I'm safe here, though, so let's go back a bit.

While I was waiting around for answers here and for Diego to come home, I decided to poke around this “fascination-endss” blog. I was hoping for some possible evidence leading to it being poached by a random who was just heartlessly fucking with me. Luka had used this blog quite regularly, and yet no matter how much I refreshed, everything had been wiped. The theme was the same, his icon was still that same Pierrot clown from some obscure Eastern European film, and the blog title and bio were the same as the day he'd set it up. But the posts were all gone prior to me interacting with…whoever was messaging me.

But after? One post. One post remained. Nothing that really stood out, it was a reblogged picture of some aesthetic-y cemetery. It looked like half a dozen other “aesthetic” pictures on the site, so in ordinary circumstances, it would not have meant much. But my circumstances were anything but ordinary, and I found myself dissecting each aspect of the post since I was done humoring whoever messaging me. 

A cemetery. Gravestones, specifically. Luka was dead, so the symbolism felt rather on the nose. The blog that posted was nonalimmen, and after some Googling, I found that nona meant “ninth”. It was originally posted April 9th, 2020. That date didn't really mean anything to me, but Luka supposedly reblogged it May 19th, 2020. When he was alive, Luka was very interested in numerology. I know fuckall about it, so if anyone can tell me if there's something here, please share. The only conclusion I came to was the number nine popped up a few times, but what's nine mean? Or am I missing something. The link is [here](https://fascination-endss.tumblr.com/?source=share), by the way. The blog is still up, though I’ve tried to report the account multiple times now. 

As soon as Uncle Diego came home, I showed him the Tumblr messages from “Luka” on my phone. It didn’t take him long to read through them and completely dismiss my growing unease. 

“It's just someone being a dick on the internet.”

I figured he was going to say as much, but it was still frustrating. “But how would they know I was back in town? And when I came back? That's clearly someone who knows me.” 

Diego couldn't really argue with that point. He was quiet for a minute before handing me back his phone. “I just don't know why you'd automatically assumed it was Luka. You know he's gone. You've got to move on.”

“Who else could it be?”

“I don't know, you have anyone that hates you? What about Rosette's ex, didn't he hate your guts in school?”

I frowned. “This isn't some high school bully, Mike wouldn't stoop that fucking low, would he?”

Diego shrugged. “Well I don't fucking know then. Say it is Luka. Why is a ghost messaging you on Tumblr? Why is his ghost haunting you of all people? He died on his sister's property, why wouldn't he haunt her?”

I was speechless for a moment. “I was his best friend,” I whispered, a little hurt. “Maybe he's still mad at me for leaving.”

Diego sighed and shook his head. “Block that person,” he said. “They've got you all messed up. You've gotta get over this stuff.” 

He was probably right, but that wasn't what I wanted to hear. But it was easier to leave it at that than fight it. 

I debated whether or not I should reply to the message before finally deciding it was in my best interest to block the account. And yet, when I got out of the shower, I had a new notification on my phone:


fascination-endss: ghost?

“What the…” I knew I blocked the account. I was sure of it. And yet he was no longer on my blocklist. Still, I knew Tumblr wasn't a well oiled machine, so maybe it was a glitch? Against better judgement, I responded. 

Me: ghost? What, like you?

fascination-endss: you're ghosting me again 

Me: please leave me alone, whoever you are

fascination-endss: why? Now we can't be friends?

Me: you're not my friend

fascination-endss: Im not?

Me: You're not Luka. He's dead.

fascination-endss: im dead?

Me: stop fucking with me

fascination-endss: I know I'm dead but I'm here :)

Me: who's here?

fascination-endss: Luka

Me: OK troll, if you're Luka, what was he like? 

fascination-endss: Mute. Didnt have many friends. And then I died

At this point it was late, I was in bed on my phone, absolutely losing it. I should have just gone to bed, but I kept it going. 

Me: Ok smart guy, how did you die?

I figured maybe, in the rational part of my brain I was trying to listen to, before deleting them all, this person just saw Luka's posts and gathered that much about him. He did often use this blog as a diary, after all. But all that thought went out the window once they, he, replied.

fascination-endss: you were there, you should know. I fell down the gully. My neck snapped on the way down. My ribs tore into my lungs. By the time you made it down I was already suffocating on my own blood. And then I died :)

I threw my phone away from me, scared it was haunted or something. It smacked the wall and landed with an unceremonious thud on the floor, and I didn't hear another notification. Fine by me. 

I was in a cold sweat, and suddenly felt like I was being watched. But the idea of leaving the bed felt weirdly terrifying, and like a child, I hid under the covers with my inhaler and my thoughts. My entire being trembled with fear, making sleep impossible. 

After hours of silence, I slowly pulled the sheet away and sat up. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could see the room was empty. The few things I had unpacked were untouched, and the curtain on the window danced delicately in the breeze. I figured I should probably grab my phone off the floor. 

Slowly, I placed a foot on the cold hardwood and immediately regretted it. The feeling I felt around my ankle can only be described as a cold hand, gripping and pulling. I yanked back in fear, letting out a yelp as I did so, but I got tangled in my sheet and ended up falling on the floor instead. 

“Fuck fuck fuck fuck--” I was now terrified that whatever the fuck grabbed my ankle was now able to get the rest of me. I grabbed my phone and scrambled out of the room like a bat out of hell, too scared to peek under the bed in fear that something would peek back. I finished the night on the couch, relieved that at least there were no new messages awaiting me. When I told Diego about it in the morning, he chastised me for cracking my phone screen (I threw it pretty hard) and said it was probably just a night terror.

Just a night terror. I guess you can call it that.

Diego was sure that I just needed to get out of the house. He lent me his truck and told me to go link up with old friends, as I had to get out of my head. Will had left town to live with an girl he met in Pennsylvania, but Rosette was still around, still working at the same diner she was when I first left the state. 

“Well shit on my ass, is that Benny Gomez!?” Clearly, she was happy to see me, and she practically leapt over the counter to hug me. 

“In the flesh,” I replied. She may have been my ex from high school, but we had remained close friends despite it all and I was grateful for her. Her excitement to see me lifted my spirits. 

“I heard you'd be coming back but you never told us when, how ya been Benny-boy?” 

“I've been better.”

“That's code for you're not doin’ well. I heard about your Mama, I'm really sorry. But it's good to see ya, really. We're all gonna help ya get through this.”

She had me a little misty eyed at the mention of mom, and it wasn't long before she and I were sharing a booth and I was crying my eyes out, telling her my woes.

“Yanno your uncle don't live that far from me. Come over any time.”

I nodded, trying to compose myself. I'd already gone through at least thirty napkins. “It's just, Luka and Mom back to back, I think it's got me going a little crazy.” I let out a nervous laughter. “H-hey, uh, by the way, do you know what Mike's doing these days?”

The mention of her ex had her visibly confused. “Mike? Why?”

I hesitated for a moment, but ultimately decided to show her the Tumblr messages I'd gotten. “I can't think of anyone who hates me so much they'd fuck with me like this. And it has to be someone who knows me.”

Her face was pale as she read through each message, and her hand was shaky when she slid my phone back. “I, I don't think Mike would stoop that low. He beat you up in school but I don't think he's a psychopath, yanno?”

“Then who is it?”

She shook her head. “I don't know, Benny. That's really weird.”

“That's not all.” I told her about the other strange happenings. The clown on the side of the road. The scratching under the bed. The thing grabbing my ankle. 

Unlike Diego, she didn't immediately just dismiss my experiences. But she was obviously confused. “That's weird. That's really weird. But I mean, why, if this is what you're implyin’ and it's Luka's ghost, why's he bein’ so mean to you? You were his best friend, Benny.”

I felt my old guilt bubble up within me. “What if he's angry? I was his best friend and I left to go live my life while he was stuck here. And I drifted away. And then I show back up, and I was right there-- and I didn't catch him. It's like symbolic, you know? Failing to be there for him.”

“You gotta let that go, that don't even make sense. He was so happy for you, we all were. You were trying to follow your dreams, we all supported and understood that. He wouldn't be resentful.”

“Then why's he doing this?”

“Why are you so sure it's him? They say demons like to feed off of bad energy, and you're carrying a lot of bad energy my friend.”

For some reason, I was skeptical of her theory, mostly because I wasn't religious. But she was Catholic, so of course her mind went there. Out of respect, I didn't argue. 

“You need a priest,” she continued. “Or some sage or something.”

“I'll think about it.”

“Think about it? You should just do it.”

“I dunno,” I sighed. There was an odd part of me that didn't want to exorcise what this was, because if it was Luka, for as cruel as he was being, I found some strange comfort in the fact he was still around. 

I came home to an box of things in my room. “Diego, what's this?,” I called, hoping it was something he knew about and not more of Luka's tricks. 

“Huh?” Diego wandered in half dressed and reeking of cologne. “Oh yeah, Gia dropped that off for you. Only open it if you're ready though-- she said it's some of Luka's old stuff. She's trying to get rid of a lot but she figured he'd want you to have some of those things.”

“I missed Gia? Damn…”

“She ain't too far,” he assured. “You gonna be alright with this tonight? I kinda got a date tonight, I didn't expect Gia to drop by. I can cancel if you need me to.”

I shook my head. I had to face this. “Nah, have fun,” I said, waving him off. 

Gia was Luka's sister. On top of the box was a note from her: “Benny: Heard you were back in town. I hope you're doing ok. I'm sorry about your mother, especially so soon after Luka. He'd want you to have this stuff, they meant a lot to him. Try to visit soon, I would like to see you before I move. -Gia”

She also left me her current phone number and email. Setting the note aside, I opened the box up. Memories of Luka flooded in. She left me his prized comics, his CDs and his old sketchbook. There were also a few of his weird little porcelain Pierrot clowns.

“You really were into these guys, huh?,” I laughed to myself. They creeped me out, but I displayed them anyways out of respect. 

The two biggest, and probably most impactful, items in the box were Luka's old radio and his omnichord. Luka was very into music, not just listening to it but listening to it. I figured it was his way of having a voice since he was mute. 

To my dismay, I couldn't get the radio to work. A shame since I rather liked some of these CDs. I hoped to have some luck with the omnichord-- and I did. 

Hearing some of Luka's old saved music instantly got tears flowing. It was as nostalgic as it was melancholy. I set it aside and let it play through before continuing to sort through what was left to me.

It suddenly crackled a bit before shitting out. “Ah, no…” I wondered if the batteries died. As I flipped it over to see what size I needed, however, the speaker played sound once more. 

But it wasn't Luka's music. It was a voice. It caught me off guard, and I told myself it was just something he'd sampled. 

There was no way he could have sampled this, though. This wasn't the voice of an actor or a song. That was MY voice. It was shaky and out of breath.

“You're gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok. Just hang on.” It crackled, and then repeated. “You're gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok. Just hang on.”

I dropped the instrument on my bed and stared on in utter horror. Not only was that my voice, it was my voice from that night. My words of assurance that night. The last words I said to Luka. I ripped the batteries out and it stopped. 

“There's no shot,” I breathed. “No fucking shot.” Had I said those same things some other time we'd hung out? And he recorded me without knowing? But what would have been the context? My thoughts raced like mad, but I couldn't come up with a memory to explain what I'd heard.

The fear had me nearly hyperventilating, and I reached for my inhaler. Strange, I thought I'd left it on the nightstand. I lifted the bed skirt to see if it'd fallen, but no luck. I ripped the covers off and shook them out, at this point getting a little worried now. “Diego!,” I shouted. “Diego!”

Oh right, he wasn't home. I searched the house, the truck, and still, no inhaler. My chest felt tight now. I returned to my room, continuing to tear it apart in search. I checked under the bed one more time-- there it was. How had I missed that? 

It was all the way under though, and I was straining to reach it. My panic grew as I squeezed myself in the tight space, especially since it was under this bed that weird shit was happening. 

“Gotcha--” Sweet relief flooded in as I was able to secure it, and I sat on the bedroom floor as I took a few puffs, breathing deep despite how shaken up I was. 

Once I was sure I wasn't going to have a real attack, I started to calm down. But as my heart pounding stopped flooding my ears, another sound became clear. That radio was finally working. 

And it was playing a song called “Suffocation”. 

“No way…” Of all the songs to crackle out of that old speaker, it was called “Suffocation”, and I couldn't breathe. I shuddered, afraid to approach the radio.

Out of nowhere, it stopped.

“Luka?,” I asked aloud. No response. “Luka, was that you?”

Silence. 

“Strange,” I muttered to myself. It wasn't strange though. It was horrifying. 

The rest of the night was quiet, which almost scared me more. It was the anticipation. I was waiting for Luka to do something again, whether through the radio or under the bed or something. I half expected those Pierrot dolls to get up and dance. But it was a quiet night, as was the following. 

Diego was confused by the omnichord, but he tried to assure me that I was misremembering, no matter how creepy it was. However, he struggled to convince himself, as I detected a lot of doubt in his voice. Same when he tried to blame the radio on faulty wiring. I didn't press him, as the doubt told me he was starting to believe me regardless. Maybe he was just trying to make me feel better. 

The following night was full of scratching under the floorboards. It was incessant and went on all. Night. Long. I couldn't sleep at all. 

In the morning, I saw I had a cheeky little message from Tumblr. Despite blocking the account, again. 


fascination-endss: Bennyyyy


This was the first time he used my name. 

fascination-endss: Benny you're not replying to me anymore. Tired?

Tired? Of course I was tired. I had been kept up the whole damn night. Still, I didn't reply. 


fascination-endss: come on Sleepyhead :(


Sleepyhead was always his nickname for me, and for some reason, it got me a little soft. What if Luka was just trying to make himself known, but just didn't know how? I mean, how does one haunt someone without being so…terrifying?


Me: Im very tired yes


fascination-endss: not sleeping well?


Me: you would know, wouldn't you?


fascination-endss: how would I know silly? Take good care of my stuff :) Those comics are a good read


Me: the trick with the radio wasn't funny


fascination-endss: What trick?


Me: you know


fascination-endss: I might :)


Me: why are you being so mean?


I didn't get a response. Of course I didn't. 

The following day, I decided to visit Gia. I wanted to thank her in person, but also, share all the insanity I'd witnessed.

Like Luka, Gia was a little eccentric. He made art with his music, she painted. She also like clowns, though not the black and white Pierrots like he did. She liked those creepy, rainbow circus clowns. Even though most of her stuff was packed up, there were still a few clowns out here and there. They gave me the creeps. 

“I'm so sorry about your mother.” Gia had waited to have a real conversation with me until we were sat with coffee, as she'd wanted the “vibes” to be right. Sitting on the patio with a Mason jar of iced coffee definitely brought back memories. 

I had grown a little tired of hearing it, but I knew she meant well. “Thank you,” I said, not sure if that was the right response. “Same to you about Luka.” Though I'm sure she was tired of hearing that. 

“I still can't believe he's really gone. It's so quiet here now without his little bloopy noises.”

“I bet. Do you ever…” I hesitated a moment. 

Gia was always pretty open to most things. She was one of those free spirits, and it was her who told me stories about how supposedly haunted this property was. So I figured it would be safe to ask.

“Do you ever think maybe he's like, still around? Like, you know, like spiritually or something?”

The question clearly caught her off guard, as she about choked on her coffee. “What do you mean?”

“Well…” I told her just about everything. 

When I finished, she was quiet a moment. “I do think he's around sometimes.” Her face looked disturbed. “But nothing so frightening. Sometimes, the windchimes will sound like his music, or the things I thought I'd lost will pop back up. But nothing ever bad. Luka was always such a sweet, timid soul. Why would you think he'd do those things?”

I feared I had offended her. “I mean, maybe he's just mad at me?”

“He'd never be that mad.”

“But maybe that's how it like, manifests? As a spirit.”

She pursed her lips in thought, looking a little upset. “I still don't think he'd do such a thing, but I'm not denying what you're experiencing so don't think that, please. I just, I couldn't see Luka being so upset with you.”

“Maybe I just really hurt him.”

Gia stood, looking out across her property. A long, sad sigh left her. “I don't know. I don't know what to tell you, but I think I don't want to talk about it anymore. I mean, I kind of wish I could have such experiences to, you know, know he was listening or something. But, I'm trying to sell this place so I can move on. I think you need to find a way to do the same. Call me if you need anything, ok?” She turned to me. “I think you should go now.”

That could have gone better. But it could have gone worse, I told myself. I could only imagine how unsettling this was for Gia. Maybe I shouldn't have told her as much as I had. I probably did nothing but stir up old trauma.

That brings us to last night, the most active night thus far. You might be wondering why the fuck I'd still choose to sleep in this room after everything that's happened so far. Up until this point, thought, while scared, I haven't felt I was in any real danger. The closest I got to that was my ankle being grabbed, but given that nothing happened after, even as I was there on the floor, I figured he was just still trying to scare me. But last night, I felt real danger for the first time. 

After a shower, I decided to get back on my laptop to do some paranormal research. Did I have a ghost on my hands? A poltergeist? I needed answers and solutions, and at this point, I still had yet to get a response on my last post. My phone buzzed.

Another Tumblr message. I opened it up on my laptop. 

fascination-endss: up late?


Me: it's only nine.


fascination-endss: you'll be up late 


Me: for the last time really, who is this???? 


fascination-endss: it's Luka! Promise :)


Me: Luka's gone


fascination-endss: then who's messaging you?


Me: that's what I'm trying to figure out


fascination-endss: so you don't believe me? :(


Me: why should I?


fascination-endss: why not?


Me: because he's dead 


fascination-endss: and who's fault is that? 


I felt sick to my stomach, not wanting to respond. My hands hovered over the keyboard when I felt the absolutely unmistakable feeling of hot breath on my neck. Chills gripped me as I whipped my head around, expecting to see a face or something.

Nothing behind me. 

“Of course not…” I muttered to myself, shudderkng before turning back to my laptop. “No…no no no no!” Every message was gone. Every last one. Any proof I had that this was still happening was gone. 


fascination-endss: They'll never believe it! :D


Then, in front of my eyes, that message disappeared as well, before the whole laptop shut off. “What the fuck,” I whispered, trembling as I set the laptop on the nightstand. Maybe the evidence would still be on my phone?

No dice.

I sat quiet in the dark, wondering what to do now. It was early, but I figured all I could do was sleep on it. As soon as I laid down, it started.

Scratch scratch scratch. 

It was louder and more violent than it had ever been, and even though I knew I shouldn't, I mustered up the courage to lean over the bed and look. A shaky hand lifted the bed skirt, and eyes met my own. 

A scream couldn't escape my mouth before before cold, stiff hands were over it, hands full of malice. Even in the dark there was no mistaking the face that stared back at me. Blood, twigs, white and black makeup. He twitched, causing me to close my eyes and flinch, and soon as I opened them again, he was gone. The hands were as well, but at this point I was so scared I couldn't even scream.

Too scared to leave the bed in fear he'd grab me, I backed myself into the corner, the sheets over my head like I was a scared child. That was certainly how I felt, helpless and small. The scratching started once more, but this time, it didn't sound like it was under the floorboards. It sounded close, like it was on the wall, the same wall I was now pressed to.

A hand started tugging on the sheet, but I refused to let go. I couldn't face him, not again. I didn't want to see him like that ever again. He pulled harder, and I started to plead with him.

“If this is Luka, stop! Why are you being so mean to me? Please!,” I wailed. “I'm sorry, ok? I'm so sorry, please!” 

The scratching just grew louder and more violent, the sheet was pulled so hard that I was now exposed. I saw nothing in the shadows, but felt something. Something cold and suffocating. That unmistakable sensation of hot breath came once more, this time against my cheek. My teeth chattered as I squeezed my eyes shut, continuing to whisper apologies. I felt something warm and wet slide from my chin to my eye-- a tongue?

My pleads grew louder, until tears spilled forth. “Why are you being so cruel!?,” I sobbed. “You were my best friend, weren't you?”

I cowered with my hands over my head as the sheets continued to be ripped off the bed. The scratching was now deafening, and the windows shook like there was a bad storm outside. I felt the sensation of what seemed like hundreds of hands all petting and pulling at me, and I was helpless as I curled tighter and tighter into a ball.

“Please stop--” I gasped, my sobs uncontrollable at this point. And somehow, it did. All at once, the room grew eerily still. I couldn't even hear crickets outside. It was just me and my own sobbing. Slowly, I uncurled myself, shivering as I looked around. Nothing was out of place. The paint should have been peeled off the walls with how violent that scratching was, and yet it wasn't. 

Mustering up every ounce of courage I could, got out of bed and peeked under. Nothing. 

“Wh-what the fuck, Luka?!,” I sobbed, dropping to my knees. “Why are you doing this?”

The radio crackled. The song? 

“Boys Don't Cry”.

Was he making fun of me? It felt like salt in the wound. 

I didn't even ask Diego to borrow his truck, I just had to get out of there. That brings me to now, feeling somewhat calmer. I'm typing this on my phone in a Waffle House, waiting for Rosette to return my call. If anyone knows what I'm dealing with, please let me know.
