I should have known taking a 30 ft boat out right before a storm wasn't a great idea, but I did. Usually the incoming swell brings in the biggest fish, this time was different. The storm came out of no where, It started as thick fog but slowly morphed into a churning hellscape of wind, lightning, and dark water. I locked myself in the cabin in hopes that the storm wouldn't kill me. It honestly wasn't that bad but it was rocking the boat around a lot. It was pitch black out the windows besides the lightning flashes every couple minutes or so. The wind at this point had died down, but i was still surrounded by a pretty crazy lightning storm and fog. Ahead of my boat during one of the lightning flashes I noticed a shape in the fog.

The shape ahead of my boat was what looked like some 17th century whaling ship. It had no sails besides some torn cloth hanging from the masts. I could also hear what sounded like soft wailing coming from its direction. I attempted to start the boat so I could move out of its path but the engine failed. The ship grew bigger and bigger as I inched closer to it. The hulking behemoth of a ship towering over mine as I brush against the side of it. All of a sudden my boat stops as its resting against the ships Hull. I hear a man with an evil almost spirit like voice say clear as day

"Avast, we seem to have caught us a wee vessel aye". He said.

My heart sunk and my mind began to race. I must be hallucinating I thought to myself as a rope dropped down to my boats deck. I sat in the corner of the cabin trembling watching the rope waiting for something to come down it. Nothing came down and it was eerily quiet. I didn't notice it at first but the fog had encircled both my boat and the ship so I could no longer see or hear the storm.

 I stood up still shaking from the adrenaline. Did I just hear a pirate? I thought to myself thinking how crazy that sounded. To me it seemed like this was paranormal. I unfortunately drifted into the path of a ghost ship and now my soul was damned, or at least that's what my mind was telling me. The rope started to sway left and right, someone was coming down the rope.

I began to try and start the motor again. The engine was turning over but it wasn't catching. I sprinted out to the deck and hit the choke on the motor. I turned to make my way back to the cabin and that's when i seen it. A pirates black cavalier boots were coming out of the fog down the rope. I ran back to the cabin, slammed the door shut and began to try and start the engine again. This time it kicked to life but i needed to go shut off the choke to keep it going. I ran out to the engine and shut the choke off and it instantly shut off. I turned the choke back on and ran to the cabin again.

 I ran one last time to the engine and it purred like a kitten this time I turned off the choke. I stood up from the motor and turned to make my way back to the cabin so I could make my escape but there was one problem. A man with a rotted face in clothes that had to be from the 1600s dangled from the rope 3 ft from my deck. He didn't say anything to me, he just hung there by one hand staring and smiling at me.

"Ahoy me hearties". He said.

"May I trouble ye for a bit of grog"? He asked.

I was in absolute shock, frozen in my fear. If the giant ghost ship wasn't enough this would definitely be. The mans expression went from smiling to frowning in an instant. My lack of reply bothering him.

"Arrrggghhh, Shark got yer tongue lad"? He asked thru his clinched teeth.

"I... I'm sorry I.....yo....you're a." I said fumbling over my words.

"Well spit it out ye coward, have ye never seen a man o the seas be-fur?" He said smiling again.

"You're a pirate"? I said finally calming down enough to answer.

"Aye, it was always a pirates life for me!' He said happier than before.

How does someone live life after encountering something like this, I began to wonder. Will I be able to go on with life after encountering something like this or will I go crazy? I began to relax thinking that if this ghost wanted to kill me it would have by now.. Right?

"so y.. you're a ghost and that's a ghost ship?" I asked still terrified.

"Ay lad, the seas are a treacherous place where dead men tell no tales." He said. "Now about that grog."

I stood up and remembered what grog was. I made my way slowly past the man, his eyes following me all the way to the cabin. I went into the mini fridge and grabbed the 4 beers I was saving and took them to the man. He grabbed the beers and began to chuckle as he made his way back up the rope.

"Well lad now I don't have to maroon ye!" He said maniacally laughing as he floated up alongside the rope.

The man chanted Yo ho ho as he slowly made his way up and out of the fog. The ship pulled away from my boat and disappeared into the fog. I went into the cabin and grabbed the wheel. I pointed the boat in the opposite direction of the ship and just went. My compass was going crazy so I really had no idea which direction I was going.

All of a sudden I broke thru the fog and was on my way home. The compass corrected and the storm cleared. The fog had disappeared and the ship was no where to be seen. It was strange but I felt almost peaceful. I didnt tell people about my encounter, they would think I was nuts. So I bottled it up and don't think about it to much. I still fish to this day always keeping my eyes open for anything strange out there. Always a few beers in my fridge.
