Old Delhi is a city steeped in history, where every lane seems to hide a story, and every stone has witnessed secrets that have been forgotten with time. It was in one such forgotten corner that I found myself, a place where the air was thick with the weight of centuries past.

The haveli I moved into was the kind you might find in a travelogue—a grand, crumbling mansion that had seen better days. Once the home of a wealthy merchant, it was now divided into several apartments, each rented out to those who didn’t mind a bit of old-world charm mixed with decay. The locals had their stories, of course—whispers of ghosts, curses, and shadows that moved on their own—but I was skeptical. I had spent most of my life in Mumbai, where the hustle of the city leaves little room for such superstitions. This was just another old building to me, nothing more.

My apartment was small but full of character. The walls were painted in a faded shade of ochre, and the wooden beams on the ceiling were darkened with age. The windows overlooked a narrow alley that twisted and turned, eventually leading to a crowded marketplace. It was the kind of place where you could get lost if you weren’t careful.

The first few weeks were uneventful. I spent my days exploring the bustling streets of Old Delhi, getting lost in the maze of lanes that seemed to have a life of their own. The smell of spices, the clamor of voices, and the sight of ancient buildings crammed together in a chaotic yet beautiful dance became my new reality. At night, the city would quiet down, and I would return to my apartment, where the silence was almost oppressive. But it was a peaceful kind of silence, one that I had begun to enjoy.

Until the whispers began.

It was a night like any other, the monsoon rains hammering against the windows as I tried to read by the dim light of a single candle. The power had gone out, a common occurrence in this part of the city, and I had grown used to the flickering shadows that the candlelight cast on the walls. I was just about to call it a night when I heard it—a soft whisper, almost too faint to be real.

I looked up, convinced it was my imagination, but the whisper came again. It was a sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once, a low murmur that sent a chill down my spine. I couldn’t make out the words, but there was something unsettling in the tone, something that made me feel like I wasn’t alone.

I stood up, the floorboards creaking under my feet as I moved towards the source of the sound. The whispering grew louder, more insistent, leading me to a small alcove in the corner of the room. I had noticed it before—a small door, no more than a couple of feet high, covered in cobwebs and dust. It looked like a storage space, something I had intended to check out but never got around to.

The whispering seemed to be coming from behind the door.

My heart pounded as I reached for the handle. It was cold to the touch, and it took a few tries before I managed to turn it. The door creaked open, revealing a dark, narrow passage that seemed to lead deeper into the haveli. The air that wafted out was stale and cold, carrying with it the scent of something long forgotten.

I hesitated, every instinct telling me to close the door and walk away. But curiosity got the better of me. I grabbed my flashlight and crouched down to peer inside. The passage was even narrower than I had imagined, barely wide enough for me to crawl through. The walls were lined with bricks, some of them crumbling and covered in a thick layer of dust. As I shone the light down the passage, I could see that it led to another room, much smaller than the one I was in.

The whispering was louder now, almost urgent. I took a deep breath and crawled inside, the cold bricks pressing against my back as I squeezed through the tight space. The passage seemed to go on forever, and I could feel the walls closing in around me. But finally, after what felt like an eternity, I emerged into the small room.

It was pitch black, the air thick with dust. I waved the flashlight around, trying to get a sense of the space. The room was empty, save for a few broken pieces of furniture scattered on the floor. The walls were covered in old, faded wallpaper that was peeling away in long strips, revealing the bare brick underneath. The floor was uneven, as if it had sunk in places, and there was a damp, musty smell that made me gag.

But what caught my attention was the far wall. There was something carved into it, a pattern of symbols and shapes that I didn’t recognize. The carvings were old, worn down by time, but I could still make out the faint outline of a figure—a figure that seemed to be watching me.

As I stepped closer, the whispering stopped abruptly. The sudden silence was deafening, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I reached out to touch the carvings, but as soon as my fingers brushed against the cold stone, the room was plunged into darkness.

The flashlight flickered and died, leaving me in complete blackness. Panic surged through me as I fumbled with the flashlight, trying to get it to work. But it was no use. I was trapped in the dark, with nothing but the sound of my own breathing and the oppressive weight of the silence.

And then, just as suddenly as it had stopped, the whispering began again. But this time, it was different. The voices were louder, closer, and there was something else—a low, guttural growl that seemed to come from the very walls of the room.

I backed away, my hand still pressed against the cold stone. The growling grew louder, more menacing, and I could feel the ground trembling beneath my feet. The walls seemed to close in around me, the air growing thicker, making it harder to breathe.

In a blind panic, I turned and crawled back through the passage, my heart racing as the growling followed me. The narrow space seemed even tighter now, the walls scraping against my skin as I desperately tried to escape. The whispering was deafening, the growling so close that I could feel its hot breath on the back of my neck.

I burst out of the passage, scrambling to my feet and slamming the small door shut behind me. The room was silent once more, the only sound the rain pounding against the windows. I stood there, gasping for breath, my mind racing as I tried to make sense of what had just happened.

But before I could gather my thoughts, the door to my apartment creaked open. My blood ran cold as I turned to face the hallway, expecting to see… something. But the hallway was empty, the door swinging gently on its hinges.

And then, from the darkness of the hallway, I heard it again. The whispering. Closer this time, clearer. And it wasn’t just one voice. It was many. And they were all calling my name.

In that one moment, in a rush of emotions I wished I had never come here in the first place, but I didn't have anywhere else to go, [not since](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1f8eaj4/the_whispering_shadows_in_space_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)...
