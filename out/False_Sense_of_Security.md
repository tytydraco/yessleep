When the love of my life started working nights we decided that it was time that I was armed. We live in a state where I could purchase and carry a firearm. We went to the local store. We found one that fit my hand nicely and that I was comfortable with. We purchased my firearm and went to the range. I learned how to load my gun, how to fire my gun, and most importantly, how to become comfortable with it. We practiced enough over a few weeks that my gun became something I was not only at peace with, but comfortable with too. The fact is that in this day and age it seemed smarter to be armed than not to be.



Say what you will, but a woman alone in this day and age can be a scary situation, and we would both rather err on the side of caution.



And from there a habit was created. I did not leave the house without my gun. When he wasn't working at night, we would sit on the couch in the evenings with the door open with it at our sides. When we went to bed at night we would bring it with us and set it on my nightstand. When I got up in the morning I carried it to the living room with me. I cannot say that it was ingrained in me to grab for it if trouble arose, but I did have it if I needed it.



The minute we knew he would be working out of town we decided that we needed to up our home security. I hated that he was away. This man was the epitome of my security. He made me feel safe in all that I did and all that I faced. Without him there with me I began to have home invasion nightmares. They were so realistic and terrifying. I would wake up breathing hard with my heart racing and sometimes even tears still wet on my face. So to make me feel less afraid, the next step to our personal comfort was to install security cameras. I got on Amazon and found ones that looked like they would serve us well. Our home is on an island about 300 yards from the beach and it is elevated like almost all the homes here on The Gulf, so I knew I needed several of them. He was already out or town, so I installed them myself. I put one pointing at our front door, one pointing down the stairs that led up to our porch, and one pointing at the driveway.



With the way I had them set up we could clearly see anyone approaching. The cameras are sensitive and they pick up any motion at all. This turned out to be both a good and a bad thing. In the beginning I had all three on at all times. I had them set to alert me any time they picked something up. This ended up getting me hundreds of alerts a day. No exaggeration. Every car that went by, even the road adjacent to ours, every bird that landed on our railing, every time the wind blew hard and moved the plants or trees. This wasn't going to work. I couldn't turn down the sensitivity, and I couldn't deal with them going off every few seconds and having to delete hundreds of meaningless videos every day. That led to a new habit. In the morning, I would turn the cameras off while I was at home. Then I had an alarm set that would remind me every evening to turn them all on again. This arrangement worked out really well. And, it led to an amazing discovery. Coyotes.



Now I know that coyotes can be dangerous animals. But to me they were just doggies. I didn't try to tame them. I didn't try to approach them. But I did start disposing of leftovers in the yard right below the camera that covered the driveway. It became a happy thing to watch them. I would get an alert and that the camera picked something up and would turn on the live feed. When the cameras are activated at night, they have lights that light up the area, and I could see them very well. There was a “family” of three. They didn't always come together. Sometimes it would be two, or just one but no matter how many showed up, it always made me happy. So much so that I became upset when they didn't come. I would be watching tv on the couch and the app would alert me, my doggies, aka the coyotes were here. I would watch as they would eat their small offering then go on their way. They were timid. If a car went down the adjacent street they would hide in the shadows before returning to their food. They showed no signs of aggression or being rabid and they quickly became a remote pet of sort. They would come early evening, usually around 8pm, while it was already very dark. Then they would return early morning, while still dark, usually around 4am.



In the beginning the alerts for the cameras would wake me up when they went off at those odd hours. I would look at my phone and see that it said motion was detected in the driveway. I would check it, it was the coyotes. I would go back to sleep. After about a month of this, I stopped waking up to the alerts. They had become part of my routine and therefore no longer woke me. It was just the coyotes. I would get up in the morning, make my coffee and sit down with a steaming mug to watch my distant pets and deactivate the cameras.



Last night I had another one of my nightmares. In my dream there were two men at my front door. I could hear them talking to one another right outside my front door. I reached for my gun on the nightstand and it wasn't there. I reasoned that I must have left it on the couch after a late night of binge-watching Christmas movies. There was no way I could get to it without passing by the glass front door. They would see me. I was filled with panic and terror. I woke up shouting the name of my love. My heart was beating so hard. Tears were streaming down my face. I laid still for a minute getting my breathing under control. I got an alarm tone, there was motion detected in the driveway. My coyotes. Just knowing they were out there helped me calm down. I reached to my night stand. I was stunned to find that my gun was truly not on there. I had indeed forgotten it on the couch. I got up and went to the living room. There it was. Right where I had been sitting last night. I sat on the couch and held it in my hand, my head sinking low. I was ashamed of myself. What if I had indeed had intruders and not just a nightmare of them.



Well there was no way I was getting back to sleep after this. It was 4:30am and I usually get up at 6:30 anyway so I might as well just make a cup of coffee, find a movie to distract me from my self-disappointment and then watch my “doggies” videos. And so it was. With my warm mug of peppermint mocha coffee, I turned on the tv and searched for something cute to watch, a feel-good holiday movie. Finding one, I started it playing and picked up my phone to check my app.



It didn't show the just the couple of alerts that I normally woke up to. There we more than double the normal alerts. Thinking they must have come several times during the night I opened it up. It showed that I had alerts of motion on the stairs, which sometimes happens as the coyotes pass in the covered area at the bottom of the stairs. This didn't alarm me. What did alarm me was alerts to motion at the front door. The coyotes have never ever come upstairs. I opened that on first. Tears ran down my face as I watched and listened. There were two men at my door. They were talking to each other while trying to get in door. Then suddenly they react and take off away from the door. I opened every video. I watched them walk up to my house. I saw them ascend the stairs. I watched them at the door. I watched them leaving. What I didn’t watch was the video of my coyotes this morning that helped to calm me down. There was no coyotes. The alert to motion on the driveway that I thought was them was two men fleeing my yard.
