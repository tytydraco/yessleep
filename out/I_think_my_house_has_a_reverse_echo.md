It was a surprise when my parents’ investment business skyrocketed out of nowhere.  
It was also a surprise when, from one day to the next, we left our old house with leaking ceilings and creaking doors, and moved into a high-society neighborhood, into a house that hadn’t been sold in decades.

When we arrived, it felt outdated, too big… or maybe it was that heavy atmosphere.  
Maybe that was why no one wanted it, but that wasn’t something I could say to an excited man with money like my father.

He fixed that quickly —or rather, hired people to do it— and we ended up with a vintage, polished, elegant house… that, somehow, didn’t make me feel comfortable at all.  
I never said anything.

It didn’t help when they announced a couples’ trip, the first one they had taken in many, many years, since before I was born.  
They left early in the morning and would return the night of the next day.

Two days and one night alone.  
Two days in that heavy emptiness that, somehow, didn’t feel as lonely as it should’ve.

  


The first hours were strangely relaxing: junk food, trash TV, and me sinking into those velvet red cushions, staining them with nacho cheese and lemon soda.

A life that didn’t feel like mine.  
And still… something was wrong.

After midnight, I went up to my room.  
I lay down in the bed —that bed with silk sheets and a wooden frame that, despite being new, creaked as if protesting— and a cold sweat washed over me.

A knot in my stomach… like I was expecting something.  
Something that was already happening.

To calm myself down, I took out the small knife I used to carry in my old neighborhood.  
I left it on the desk within reach and forced myself to sleep.

  


I don’t know how long I slept before I woke up to a creak and a metallic sound in my room.  
I looked at the clock, but the numbers looked… wrong.  
Like a tangled mess with no meaning.

I looked at the door just in time to see the silhouette of someone slipping out.  
I blinked.  
The door was closed, like always.

I got up immediately, feeling strangely light.  
I grabbed the knife from the desk and, taking a deep breath, reached for the doorknob.

Before turning it, I heard something:  
a woman’s voice whispering on the other side.

I swallowed hard and finally opened the door.

  


The hallway was dark and freezing.  
The marble floor burned my bare feet.

I looked in both directions.

>

I asked with a trembling voice, gripping the knife tightly.

Then I heard it:  
hurried footsteps going down the stairs, muffled by the carpet.

Without thinking, I ran after them, trying to make as little noise as possible.

I reached the railing just as something hit the floor below with a dry thud.  
Like a body collapsing.

My heart sped up.  
I rushed downstairs toward the shape I thought I saw, but when I was almost there, my nightgown caught on my foot and I tripped.

I fell.

I fell right where I thought that stranger was.

I squeezed my eyes shut, expecting to crash into another body, but instead the freezing floor hit me.

The impact made a thin stream of blood drip from my nose.  
Dazed, I blinked… and that’s when I saw her.

  


A woman.  
At least I assumed from the long black hair.  
Her face was swallowed by the shadows, but for some reason, I **knew** she was looking at me in terror.  
She was holding something sharp.

I covered my head, bracing myself… but when I dared to look again, she was gone.

I stood up.  
At the spot where I fell, there was a small pool of blood, bright against the polished white floor.

But there was something else…  
like a shadow, a silhouette… something that seemed to be there and not at the same time.

I blamed the darkness.

I took a few steps into the living room, breathing hard.  
Maybe that strange person had already escaped…  
but I hadn’t heard the door.  
Nor a window breaking.  
Nothing.

Then a **scream** shattered the silence from the kitchen.

  


I ran.

When I arrived, it took my eyes a second to process the scene:

Blood on the floor.  
Blood on the counter.  
Someone lying on the ground.  
And a third person kneeling beside the body… trembling.

I screamed and raised the knife.

The person turned to me, terrified.  
A girl with long black hair, almost melting into the darkness, with red drops sliding from her nose, staining everything they touched.

>

Everything happened so fast.  
Maybe it was the knife.  
Maybe that face I already knew.  
Maybe the echo of steps in the hall.  
Maybe…

Maybe **my hand plunging forward**, the splash, until she finally collapsed to the floor.  
And then I understood everything.

  


But it was too late anyway, because I heard a scream behind me and turned around.

And there she was.

**Me.**  
Standing.  
Holding a knife.

Looking at me with the same terror on my face.

>

Exactly thirty seconds later…

  


A brief burn.  
A void.

And there I was again.

Lying in my bed.  
Sweating.  
Shaking.

Whatever happened, here I am, writing this while still lying down, trying to convince myself it was just a nightmare… even though I know how real it felt, However silly a reverse echo may sound.

But…  
I think I heard something.  
A creak.  
Something… metallic?

I think I should go check.
