 This story was written by me :P

In a peaceful town, a mysterious DVD appeared on the shelf of a small rental store. The DVD was titled "The Infinite Series" and seemed to have endless seasons. The author was unknown, and the store owner didn't realize that someone had intentionally left the DVD there. He hadn't ordered them. Nevertheless, the DVD became popular, and everyone wanted to rent them, which was difficult because there was only one copy of the DVD. People lined up outside in a frenzied race to see who could get there first. There wasn't anyone in that town who didn't know about those DVDs or who wasn't completely addicted, as some would rent the DVD over and over again, even though they had already seen them several times. But what was recorded on those DVD anyway? Well, nobody knew. It turns out that people watched the DVDs but then turned off the DVD player and forgot everything they had just seen. They suffered a horrific urge to put the DVD back in the player.  
People started going crazy because everyone wanted the DVD but no one wanted to return it. It was a kind of amnesia. Concerned about the situation, the store owner wanted to put an end to it because people were going mad and destroyed his entire store in fits of rage when they realized the DVD had been taken. He decided to go to the house of the last customer who took the DVD to retrieve it and subsequently destroy it. Upon arriving there, the customer seemed delusional and refused to return the DVD, saying he couldn't do it at all. With much insistence, the store owner managed to get the DVD returned. And now, it was time to destroy it. He took a hammer and prepared to strike, but he began to feel an overwhelming urge to see what was on that DVD.  
He picked up the DVD, turned on the player... It was nothing but an endless black screen. People would spend hours staring at that black screen, and when they turned off the player, they felt the urge to watch it again because, in reality, they hadn't seen anything. However, even though there was no image, you could hear moans and feel physical and mental pain for no apparent reason. The store owner decided to destroy the DVD, and so he did.  
But the next day, upon entering the store, he found the same DVD once again displayed on the shelf. At that moment, he felt that trying to destroy it again was futile; it would return, and they were all condemned to live that curse. It was an unrelenting addiction. Months passed, and more and more people came to the store to rent the cursed DVD. Even people from other cities. The store owner decided to close the doors and move to another town, never opening another rental store, fearing to have the dreadful DVD displayed on his shelves again. But he knew things were worse; now it wasn't just one DVD; several started to appear as rental stores kept popping up everywhere, waiting for viewers who had no idea of the nightmare they were about to face. There were copies that appeared so that every person in the city had their own DVD. The DVDs were infinite, the people were infinite, their addiction was infinite; it was as if the entire city was living in an endless series.
