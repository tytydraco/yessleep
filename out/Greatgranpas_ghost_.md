A little backstory; the house we live in is an ancestral house. This means that over 150 years, generations, and generations of my family have lived in it. Died in it. And even before all of this, before my family first purchased and moved in years and years ago, the house was owned by this rich family. The husband found his wife cheating and in a fit of rage, he killed every single person in the house, including the staff (which were about 30) before turning the gun on himself. (This last part is not relevant to the story, it's just extra background information.)

  
With that being said, the house is bound to be haunted or have at-least some sort of 'paranormal' things going on. Stuff used to happen all the time; creaking noises, footsteps, doors swinging open and shut, the lights turning on and off by themselves, etc. These things are considered normal and no one would get freaked out. But one thing that stuck with my parents was this. 

  
Years ago, my older brother, who was 4 at the time, was playing in his room, when he went to my mom asking about 'why is the old man sitting on my bed'. My mom freaked out and thought someone had broken in somehow, went to check, and....nothing was there. This kept on occurring multiple times within the same day until my mom got fed up and told my dad. My dad started playing with my brother and asking him questions about the old man while carrying him down the hallway. My brother stopped and said 'That's him.' He was pointing at my great-grandpa's photo. After that, they took down the photos of my great-grandpa, because I kid you not, almost every single kid that came over to my house, said that they saw him. The photos were taken and placed in the attic. 

Years went by and kids stopped talking about him. So now, almost twenty years later, my family was going through the attic and saw the photos, and they decided to put the photos on the wall again. This was weeks ago. This particular evening we were having a little family get-together. My nephew, who's about two and a half years old, was playing with my other nephew, who's 5. They were playing and yelling, usually what happens when they play. Suddenly, both of them started laughing really loud, to the point everyone stopped and was just laughing at how loud the kids were. Sounds of really fast footsteps came along and here they came running, laughing and out of breath, talking about how 'the old man' was chasing and tickling them. Everyone, besides the kids, was in the living room. This kept on going for hours at end until we started to get a little freaked out. I planned to ask them about who this old man was, but I didn't want to scare them or make it seem as if something was wrong. I was walking with them by the hallway and asking them about this 'old man'. 'Oh, he is tall, old, funny...', they were describing 'him', until they stopped and pointed at the hallway photo wall. 'That's him!'. They were pointing at my great-grandpa's photo. As it happens, years and years ago, my great-grandpa, aka my dad's grandpa, was living in the house with his wife and kids. I'm not going into detail as to why but he died. He was described as a very bubbly, happy old man who loves playing with kids in a certain way. His favorite game? chasing and tickling them. That's the only way he'd play with them, and this is coming from my mom and her cousins, his granddaughters. 

  
Mind you, no one obviously would tell kids about their dead family members, and certainly not about your dead GREAT GRANDPA that you've never met and his signature way of playing with kids.

  
\*\*Side note; I'm not scared of this experience. Stuff happens in my house all the time and although sometimes it does get overwhelming and freaky, this one's different. As weird as it may sound, it's comforting and I'm not the only one who feels this way. It was just a \*little\* freaky and a wtf moment. I never met my great-grandpa obviously but I love the vibe and the feelings I felt when we realized it may be him.
