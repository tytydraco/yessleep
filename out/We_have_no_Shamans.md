"We have to go back now."  
   
"Can you see, there is no way back."  
   
Josh, consumed by the terror of our situation thought only of escape, meanwhile I couldn't help but think of how we got in this situation in the first place.  
   
It began on a humid summer day in Belize. Josh and I, ambitious film students, had embarked on a journey to document the remnants of the Mayan Shamanic Culture.  
   
Our first day there we began our search for a shaman. The only problem was, every local we asked seemed to give the same answer "We have no shamans". I could tell by the look in their eyes and their changing faces what they were saying wasn't true.  
   
It wasn't until one day a man approached us as we were eating, recognizing we were outsiders, he asked us what brought us to Belize. After telling him our business a happy but questionable smile grew across his face. He told us if we seek a shaman, he would take us to him. Our desperation and the air of mystery behind our interactions led us to agree, despite concerns for the awkward situation.  
   
Guided by the stranger, we ventured to the edge of the town, where the jungle loomed. "Entering the jungle, we will pick up the pace" he muttered. We obeyed, not fully grasping the gravity of his words. He sprinted ahead, forcing us to follow, gasping for breath. The running was relentless, our hearts pounding, and our energy dwindling. We ran for what seemed like an eternity before the man suddenly halted.  
   
"We stop here" he announced clearly with no signs of fatigue.  
   
Exhausted we collapsed to the ground against trees. After a moment of recovering, I finally looked up and was met with disbelief. Day had turned to night, how could this be, we left at one in the afternoon. We were still in the jungle, no sign of any civilization in sight.  
   
The real surprise came when I looked at the sky. It had ten times the stars I had ever seen, each connected by what looked like a thin straight rainbow. The moon cast down the brightest rays, emanating a luminescent glow upon our surroundings. A minute, film like grain filled my vision.  
   
"Where are we?" Josh stuttered still catching his breathe.  
   
"This is what we call "The Realm of The Ancients". I am the man you have been searching for. For centuries men with no right have heard legend and searched for this place. Conquistadors, archeologists, even the government. All have failed because they were searching, holding an image in their mind, thoughts directed towards something inaccurate. The only way to enter this realm is to not think about it, that is why we ran, your minds were too distracted to think. Now you must venture further into the jungle, and it will reveal what it has in store for you."  
   
Josh and I stared at each other in disbelief and confusion.   
   
"This is where your journey begins, it is not my journey, so i must leave you."  
   
The shaman then began walking and on the fifth step vanished.  
   
"Did he slip something in our drinks" Josh asked in confusion.  
   
"He never came close to them" I answered.  
   
"Something doesn't seem right about this" Josh remarked.  
   
"Can't imagine what gave you that idea. Were already here though so theres no point in stopping."  
   
"This is literally a setup for a horror movie" Josh remarked frustrated.  
   
"Your paran-"  
   
The ground began trembling as we heard rustling emanate from the trees. We leapt to our feet in fear and began to flee.  
   
"I don't think this place is giving us any options" i shouted.  
   
We continued running until the world stopped shaking and the jungle grew eerily silent. We saw a faint, flickering flame the distance. We approached cautiously, noticing a silhouette of a man sitting at a desk.   
   
"Who goes there!" The man shouted, his voice echoing in the night.  
   
"Umm... travelers" I answered, edging closer.  
   
"Ahh, I see you found your way here to" the man replied, face still hidden in the shadows.  
   
"Kind of... who are you?" I replied.  
   
"I am Fredrick Eckhartt," the man revealed. "I came to Belize in 1924, searching for the legendary El Dorado. After two years, my funding ran out, and I walked into the forest, seeking my own demise. Instead, I found myself here."  
   
"So, you've been here for a hundred years" Josh questioned, bewildered by Fredrick's statement.  
   
Fredrick chuckled, pulling out a gold pocket watch that let out a loud tick with every second that passed.  
   
"What do you mean chap, it's been only 9 months, I've kept track with my watch."  
   
I hesitated, reluctant to disclose the true passage of time, and uncertain of Fredrick's reaction.  
   
I could feel hair of my neck stand at attention as a cold sweat dripped down my brow. My spine felt like it was protruding as I contemplated the idea of being stuck in a never-ending nightmare.  
   
The rustling of the bushes behind started once again. We looked back to see nothing, then to Fredrick who had pulled the candle closer to his face revealing the insanity that had made its home in his eyes.   
   
"Looks like your friends aren't happy you ran from them" Fredrick said with a menacing grin.  
   
I Grabbed Josh's arm and began sprinting deeper into the forest as Fredrick's malevolent laugh echoed behind us. I took a glance back in an attempt to see what was chasing us, only to be met with the piercing violet eyes of shadow figures moving through the trees as if they were ghosts. Their bodies holding no comprehensible shape, but something I could only describe as an evil Rorschach. Images of chaos and agony infected my mind every second my eyes were directed towards them.  
   
"We have to go back now" Josh yelled, tears rolling down his cheek.  
   
"Can't you see, there is no way back!" I shouted.  
   
Full of adrenaline and fear we persisted into the night until we were confident, we lost the shadows. An enormous tree with a hollow trunk stood close to us. Exhausted, we agreed to hide and sleep inside.   
   
I fell into a coma like sleep, Fredrick's laugh echoing through my nightmares. As my eyes opened, I looked out and noticed the sky had not changed. The moon sat in the same position as I had seen when we first got here.   
   
I turned to wake Josh only to find no trace of him. The possibilities of what happened flooded my mind. Fearful of what might have happened to my friend, I climbed out of the tree. My feet pressed into the wet cluster of mud and leaves. A cold heavy wind blew against my skin, raising goosebumps. I rose my head only to see the worst possible outcome, I saw Josh.   
  
He was suspended in mid-air, surrounded by the shadows. Time stood still as thoughts raced through my mind at 100 miles an hour. How did they find us? Do I flee? Do I fight? Is this all a dream? Knowing I had to do something, I mustered up what courage I had and slowly inched closer. The shadows stared at me with their malevolent eyes, although faceless I could tell they were smiling. As soon as I got within ten feet Josh's eyes jolted open revealing the same luminous violet color.  
   
Anguish stuck my heart knowing there was nothing I could do to help my friend. So I ran, I ran until the bones in my feet felt like powder and my heart felt like it was pumping molasses. The thought that I was now completely alone echoed through my mind.  
   
Eventually, I stumbled upon a small cave near a stream. I decided to make it my base while I tried to find a way out of this dimension. I survived by drinking from the stream and foraging whatever nuts and berries I could find. The night never changed, time was an enigma, I could never tell how many days had passed. Every time I woke up, I set out to discover more territory, desperately in search of an exit. It was either keep trying or suffer in the face of hopelessness.  
  
Eternity felt as though it had passed. Occasionally I would see the shadows, the more time passed, the less the came after me. Eventually they didn’t even notice me or possibly weren’t concerned with me. I contemplated if they began to see me as part of this dimension as well. Every time I witnessed their passing I questioned if it was Josh.   
   
One day, as I sat by the stream collecting water, three figures began to emerge from the dense forest. Able to make out silhouettes I knew it wasn't the shadows. My heart raced as a mixture of hope and panic coursed through my veins. As they drew closer, I shouted the only thing that came to mind.  
   
"Who goes there!"
