“Kevin!” I shouted, dashing through the trees and underhanging branches. “Kevin!” Dusk was quickly approaching, and though I had spent my life in the woods of Kentucky, the fearful imaginings of what crept in the dark of the trees still frightened my 12-year-old self. Caught up in the moment of summer vacation, Kevin and I had already stayed out longer than both of us should have, and now we were separated.  

My heart dropped to my stomach and I fell forward straight into a thorn bush as my friend burst around a tree trunk and shouted “found me!” 

“What are you doing!” I yelled as I scrambled to my feet.  

“Hide and seek,” he responded nonchalantly with a big grin on his face.  

“Hide and seek?” I said in an exasperated voice, I was still trying to catch my breath. “Is that what you call randomly disappearing for nearly an hour?”  

“It adds tension” Kevin responded with a laugh.  

I was angry, but I was mostly glad I had found my friend. We were both awkward 12-year-old boys with no friends other than each other. As upset as I was, I was just happy he was ok.  

“Whatever,” I said while plucking a thorn out of my shoulder, “we need to get home. It’s almost dark.” He looked up and saw the familiar grey of the July sky that signaled night was close. He looked slightly shocked as if he just noticed the time. Without saying a word, he nodded at me and began pacing back towards my house.  

It didn’t take long for us to realize we were lost. Kevin and I had spent our childhood in the woods of rural Kentucky. We knew the land better than any other kids our age, but my friend’s “game” had taken us far from our normal play areas.  

As the last rays of light faded, I could see the scared look on my friend’s face. I suppressed the anger I felt rising in my chest and in as calm of a voice I could muster, I told him we would be fine. He nodded, but I knew the tone to my voice was hardly convincing. We might have been two stereotypical redneck kids, but we were still children. The imaginative fear of what lurks in the shadows of trees scared us both.  

“Wait!” Kevin shouted as he came to a halt and began digging in his backpack. “I forgot, I brought this!” In the pale moonlight, I could see the look of victory creep across his face as a small flashlight emerged in his hand.  

Guided by the small beam of light, we stumbled our way through the trees. We walked for hours through the woods, but we saw no familiar sights. I didn’t want to admit it, but we were more lost than before. Worst, the comforting glow of the flashlight was clearly dimming.  

“We should stop,” I said to Kevin.  

“What? Why?” His voice was shacky.  

“We’re just getting more lost,” I said. “Our parents will be looking for us. We should wait on them. “  

He opened his mouth to protest, but Kevin knew I was right. “I saw a small opening in the rocks not far behind us,” he said.  

Without word and with the little bit of juice left in the batteries of the flashlight, we made our way back to what we discovered was a small cave. Or, at least what we thought was small.  

The entrance to the cave was cramped and we could barely fit, but we discovered that the back opened into a much larger area. It wasn’t huge, but it was roughly the size of the average living room.  

“Woah,” Kevin said in a half-whisper. “Mark, check this out.” He kicked aside a pile of of sticks and other debris to reveal a hole blacker than anything I had ever seen. The night sky appeared bright in comparison.  

“How deep do you think that is?” I asked while reaching for the flashlight.  

The light from the flashlight seemed to have no effect on the blackness. No bottom or sides came into view. Lost in amazement, the light fell from my hands as the screams from my friend behind me made me jump. 

Now in total blackness, I turned to yell at Kevin who was shouting something about a spider web. Just as the words were forming on my lips, I was cut off by a bright beam of light bursting from the other side of the cave.  

There, less than 20 feet away, our flashlight-or what used to be our flashlight-laid in front of another hole.  

“What the he-” Kevin said as he moved towards the light. “Mark...”  

The old flashlight that was previously barely functioning was now a high-powered torch that perfectly illuminated the cave.  

Natural curiosity took over, and we spent the rest of the night dropping other objects in the hole. Everything we dropped into the hole shot out the other hole as an upgraded item. My worn Walmart shoes emerged as a fresh pair of Nike’s. Kevin’s rusted pocket knife became an expensive survival knife neither of us recognized. It didn’t truly dawn on us what we had discovered until Kevin dropped his cheap wristwatch into the hole and a Rolex emerged.  

Our lives were forever changed. Our parents found us the next day, but Kevin and I frequently returned to what we called our “changing hole.” At first we were carried away. Imagine the enthusiasm of tween boys when they discovered they could turn 1$ bills into 100$ bills. Neither of us spent much time with our families, but eventually our parents did begin to question where all our new stuff was coming from. We decided that we would need to be more discreet with what we changed until we were older, and we both vowed to never tell another soul about the “changing hole.”  

Life was good. We kept our changing within reason, but we always had the newest gadgets, the best clothes, and so on throughout Middle and High School. Sometimes our parents would question where we had acquired such items, but nothing was too extravagant and we were able to come up with a convincing enough lie.  

By the time we were in our 20’s, both of us lived like millionaires. Coming up with believable lies about how we had acquired our fortune was easier than you would expect. Gambling, the stock market, etc proved to be convincing enough to most people. We went from two kids from broke families to being able to literally have anything we wanted.  

Despite all of this, at 27, Kevin had fallen into a crippling depression. He had the money, the clothes, the cars, everything you could want. But aside from me, he had no other people who cared about him. His mom passed away a few years earlier, and his dad took his own life shortly after. As much as he wanted a family of his own, the “changing hole” couldn’t fix his looks, the large scar on the left side of his face, or awkwardness. Other than obvious gold diggers, Kevin had no success with women. The final straw came when his dog, his only friend other than me, passed away.  

After nearly a week without seeing or hearing from him, I began to truly worry about my friend. I had already planned to call him later that night after eating dinner when I felt my phone vibrate. A text from Kevin read “meet me at the changing hole tomorrow afternoon.” I sent him several texts back and tried calling him multiple times, but he wouldn’t answer. I rarely visited the changing hole anymore since moving out of my hometown, but I had this unsettling feeling that I should go.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

“You’re late” Kevin said as I squeezed myself into the cave. It was a tight fit as a child, but as adults we were barely able to squirm our way in. At least it gave us reason to stay fit.  

“This better be-” I stopped as I saw Kevin standing over the body of his German Shepherd. The signs of decay were evident on her body, and dirt still lingered on her fur from being exhumed.  

Kevin looked at her body then back at me “I guess you know what I’m about to do,” he said.  

“We never tried this on an animal” I shouted at Kevin, “you have no idea what’s going to happen.”  

 

“Yeah,” he responded. “That’s kinda why I want you here. For all I know, a wolf might come flying through the other hole.”  

 

I wanted to protest and tell him not too, but I knew he had already made up his mind. Nothing I said would change that. “You could’ve at least told me to bring a weapon,” I said.  

He let out a low chuckle and began dragging the corpse of his deceased friend to the hole. With a final push, her body tumbled in.  

We waited for around five minutes with nothing happening. “It must not work on living things” I said as I pat Kevin on the back in an attempt at comforting him. “Yeah,” he said in a trembling voice. I could tell he was trying to hold back tears. Suddenly, scraping noises could be heard from the other end of the cave. Paws emerged from the exit hole followed by the head of a German Shepherd struggling to climb out of a hole.  

“Maggie!” Kevin shouted as he ran to his resurrected dog. Grabbing her by her front paws, he lifted her out of the hole. Even though the changing hole had brought me so much fortune, I was still amazed to see that it had the power to bring the dead back to life. Kevin smiled and laughed as Maggie slobbered all over his face. Though I was happy for my friend, I couldn’t shake this feeling of unease. Transforming inanimate objects into more valuable ones was one thing, resurrecting the dead was another.  

On our walk out of the woods, I brought up my concerns to Kevin.  

“But look at her!” he shouted, pointing at the dog that gleefully trotted behind us. “She’s healthier than ever.”  

“Yeah, but we’ve never tried anything like this. How does this even work?” I asked.  

He shrugged his shoulders. The joy of having his canine friend back clearly outweighed any worries.  

“Look,” I said. “At least promise me you wont do this with any other animals, at least not until we know what happens.” He agreed and we carried on our way. The changing hole got its name because it changed things. Nothing ever came back the same. What I didn’t want to say is that we don’t know for sure the dog he put in is the same one that came out.  

I kept in touch with Kevin over the next few weeks to make sure “Maggie” was ok. He assured me each time that things were great, that he hadn’t seen her so full of energy in years. I still wasn’t fully convinced, but I was just happy for my friend. Eventually, however, the enthusiasm of his resurrected dog faded and he began to fall back into his lonely depression. One night, he asked if I thought the changing well could give him a woman if he put a mannequin in it. I told him no and that he better not try anything like that, and he assured me he was only joking. “I wouldn’t want fake love anyway,” he said. Even though he claimed it was a joke, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was something he had considered.  

Then, one night, I got a familiar text: “meet me at the changing hole tomorrow afternoon,” it read. Once again, he wouldn’t respond to any of my texts or calls.  

I couldn’t sleep that night. Kevin’s mental state had deteriorated to its lowest point. The week before, he had informed me that he had seriously been contemplating suicide, and he had developed a terrible alcohol addiction. Though I loved my friend, I was terrified of what he might be planning at the changing hole.  

I was relieved to find only Kevin sitting in the cave the next day. Throughout the night, I had imagined everything from him actually trying to change a mannequin into a person to possible kidnapping some woman.  

“I’m going to jump into the hole,” he somberly said.  

“Like hell you are,” I responded.  

“I almost did it a few days ago,” he said, looking at the ground. “I loaded a gun and put it to my head. The only reason I decided not to was to see if this can fix me.”  

“Fix what,” I yelled.  

“Fix my personality. Fix my hairline. Fix my face and this awful scar,” he pointed to the long scar that stretched from his chin to his left eye that was caused by a motorcycle accident several years earlier.  

“You’re rich, “I said, in an attempt to reason with him. “Plastic surgery, therapy, why don’t you try one of those?”  

He shook his head. “I don’t care to try anymore. Look, I called you here just...In case. I’m gonna do it either way. You can leave if you want.”  

“You have no idea what’s going to happen, Kevin,” I said.  

“It worked on Maggie,” he responded.  

“You don’t even know for sure that’s her!” I shouted. “It never brings things back, *it changes* them!” 

“I know,” he said. “She acts a little differently than before. Anyway, I don’t really care. I want it to change me.”  

Briefly, I considered calling the police, but then I realized there would be no way for me to explain the hole. I was bigger than Kevin, I could physically restrain him if I wanted to, but he would just come back later on his own. With no other options, I walked up to my friend and hugged him. “You better come back.”  

With that, Kevin jumped in the hole. I waited, unsure of what would happen. Other than Maggie, we had only ever changed objects, nothing close to a living human.  

After what seemed like forever, I heard grunting followed by hands climbing out of the hole. I went to grab Kevin’s hand, but he emerged with ease. *He’s stronger, clearly,* I thought to myself as I remembered my previously scrawny friend.  

Kevin looked totally different. I don’t know how to describe it. He was still Kevin, but every feature and aspect of his body was *better.* His jaw was sharper, his skin and hair perfect. His figure resembled that of a male model, and he had gained at least 2 or 3 inches in height. 

And most of all, judging by the quick flash of black I could see in his eyes, whatever emerged from that hole was *not* my friend.
