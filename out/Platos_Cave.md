They who control the present, can write the past, and thus paint the future. Mix this with the overall average majority in society stuck in a representation of Plato's Cave... and then you will understand my mentality on the world. 

You can call me a conspiracy theorist, and it is thrown as an insult but means nothing to me. On average you can try to tell someone a truth and they wouldn't believe you, for many reasons, and vise versa as far as lies are concerned. In my life, however, it seems people will believe a lie rather than the truth for whichever reason.

Does anyone think it strange how many people can see the bullshit on the worldstage, and still be manipulated into trusting whatever governments and geopolitical NPOs say? I really think we are meaty, squishy, emotional computers... in which case we can be programmable by the content that fills our eyes and ears.

I have traditional conservative values but wouldn't be caught dead siding with conservatives or any political alignment.

I'm a Christian, but I struggle with lying, lust, hate (which isn't as bad as it used to be, just flairs up like a bad case of a cold sore), greed, laziness, and pride (same case as hate), and if I don't actively try to fix these issues of mine I'm going to be in hell because I am a bad person. You couldn't convince me otherwise, though I appreciate those who would try but please don't... it would be in vain and you shouldn't waste your precious time (not being facetious).

I don't think the world has much time left, and sure as a jackrabbit fleeing from a fox... I know it's not going to end because of climate change from 7 billion people living their lives. Shit, I just looked into the commercial fishing/fish farming industry and that bullshit is why there's so much death coming our direction by way of the oceans.

We've all been conditioned into believing that the world is evolving through technology... all I see are kidults acting excited waiting for the next new toy while arguing on this site, YouTube, tik tok, Facebook, and what the fuck else they make to entertain humanity.

This world is so fucked it makes me sad, that someone can try to talk about real issues (and just because it's important to you doesn't make it a "real" issue in my book). Not negating that issues that mean something to you, whatever it may be, isn't important but just that it doesn't wake you up to that simple fact: If enough money is being made, nothing will change regardless of how fucked up it is. Only when enough attention is payed that the ugly truth comes to light and makes a few little waves... and with a little time, that shit that humans always do: move on and put those thoughts in a filing cabinet... It happens like clockwork and nothing really changes that.

The things that most people talk about and focus on is what's popular, and what's popular means it's important to those who want us focused on distractions. They're magicians... pedophile, cannibalistic, evil fucking magicians...



and nobody really gives a shit, and that's why this world will, must, die eventually. Take care folks, stranger days ahead of us.
