It all started about three months ago. I was just a normal person, living a normal life in my small apartment. But one day, I found a finger on my kitchen counter. It was just lying there as if someone had placed it there intentionally. I didn't know what to do, so I wrapped it up in a plastic bag and threw it in the trash.

At first, I tried to brush it off as some kind of sick joke. But then, more body parts started appearing in my apartment. A hand in my bedroom, an ear in the bathroom, a foot in the living room. It was like a nightmare that I couldn't wake up from.

I tried to stay calm, but I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching me. Every time I turned around, I felt like someone was standing just behind me, out of sight.

I didn't know who to turn to. I didn't want to go to the police and sound like some kind of lunatic, telling them that I kept finding body parts in my apartment. So, I started doing my investigation.

I searched online, trying to find any information about missing people in the area. I even went door to door, asking my neighbours if they had noticed anything strange. But no one seemed to know anything.

As the weeks went on, the body parts kept appearing. It was like a twisted game, with someone taunting me, leaving these gruesome reminders of their presence. I started to feel like I was going crazy.

As the body parts kept appearing, I found myself becoming more and more paranoid. I couldn't shake the feeling that something dark and malevolent was lurking in the shadows of my apartment, watching my every move.

I started seeing things out of the corner of my eye and hearing strange noises in the night. I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't eat. I was barely holding on to my sanity.

One night, I couldn't take it anymore. I snapped. I grabbed a kitchen knife and started tearing apart my apartment, looking for whatever was causing this nightmare.

And that's when I found it. Hidden in the walls, behind a loose panel in the bedroom. It was a portal, a gateway to another world. A world of darkness and twisted, demonic creatures.

I knew I shouldn't have looked, but I couldn't resist the temptation. I peered into the portal, and that's when I saw it. The source of all my nightmares.

It was a creature, unlike any I had ever seen before. Its body was writhing and shifting, constantly changing form. Its eyes were glowing red orbs, filled with malevolent intent.

I knew I had to get out of there. I ran, not stopping until I was miles away from my apartment. I never went back.

But even now, as I try to put the pieces of my shattered life back together, I can't shake the feeling that the creature is still out there, waiting for me. Watching me. And one day, it will come for me.
