Thunk. Thunk. Screech. I tried to focus on the sounds of my morning commute and avoid touching the people packed in the subway around me. I glanced upwards, bleary eyed, to avoid making eye contact with anyone around me. I try not to do that anymore. Not after I zoned out for three stops while staring at a woman's face. I didn't realize I had been doing it until she practically flew off the train. I have the sneaking suspicion it wasn't even her stop. She probably just waited for the next one.

I've got the male equivalent of a resting bitch face. Which I guess is just resting bitch face. I glanced up at the endless litany of advertisements. Car dealership here, four depression clinical studies there, something about Jesus. And then in bold blue lettering on a lemon yellow background: trouble sleeping?

I don't make a personal habit of calling the numbers on signs that I see. So I didn't. 

I went to work. My boss harangued me for being six minutes late. She never congratulates me for showing up twenty minutes early, something that happens with equal frequency to being slightly tardy, on account of public transit. But I was too tired to care. 

I probably made small talk with my coworkers. They all laugh too much when they're talking to me. I can't tell if they think I'm impaired in some way. Or maybe I'm the butt of some long running joke. It's all very unclear. I don't even know what their names are. One of them is Sarah, but whether it's the blond or the brunette woman I don't know and I'm too afraid to ask after all this time. Or in a real upset, maybe it's the man's name. But I'm pretty sure he's a Brian.

I mostly work in the back office. That day I was stuffing flyers into a mailer. We were sending out our own mailers but there were a handful of magazine-print advertisements going in the envelopes which I assume covered the price of postage. And there it was again, the bright yellow background printed in bold, round letters: trouble sleeping? Not that I cared. I shuffled them into the envelopes.

My eyes sting all the time. When I shut them they water too much to overcompensate for some fundamental dryness. An ex-girlfriend left an eye cream at my place, either by mistake or as a quiet passive-aggressive jab. I dab it on when I want to look presentable. I'm not sure it does much. My swollen capillaries make me look like a goddamn racoon. It's why they keep me in the back office. 

I like doing menial tasks like mailers anyway. My brain shuts off and I enter a meditative state that's sleep-adjacent. My coworker, the blonde one - maybe Sarah - was standing in front of me. She was talking.

“Huh?” I asked. I wiped my mouth with the back of my sleeve. I wasn't sleeping but I suppose it never hurts to make sure you aren't drooling. 

“Mary wants you out front.”

“What for?”

“She's ‘running errands.’ She needs someone to man her desk.” Sarah rolled her eyes. “Must be nice to not have a real job.” She smiled, inviting me in on the joke, which was that our manager was banging the FedEx guy every chance she got.

Mary wasn't too pleased when she saw me. “What took you so long?” she asked impatiently, pulling her coat on. “I've got to run to the bank. Don’t give away any free stuff, I don’t care how upset the customer is. No returns.”

I told myself to stay focused and pulled out my phone. I hoped reading would keep me alert. I came to and the phone was ringing. Shit. Who knows how many rings. Sometimes Mary calls to make sure we're doing all right. And to make sure I'm doing my job. I've only missed her call once, thankfully, and I told her I was in the bathroom. She didn't really buy it but it wasn't quite enough to write me up.

I snatched the receiver and gave the full thirty second spiel about the store, location, and how happy we are to be of service. It was a spam call. Mary came back after about an hour or so. Her hair was in a ponytail now. It had been down earlier. 

“Have fun?” I asked. 

“What?” She asked me sharply.

“At the bank,” I said.

“Oh. No. There was a bit of a line.”

Anyway, the rest of the day was uneventful. And a bit of a blur, to be honest. Most of my days are a blur.

I was on the subway and headed home when I saw another one of those ads. I copied the number into my phone from one of the similar placards inside the car. 

I do have trouble sleeping. I have insomnia. And even when I do sleep I have strange dreams. There's never any people or color. Just shifting monochrome shapes that are vaguely unsettling. 

I got home, microwaved a frozen dinner, and watched some Netflix. Then it was time for bed. I maintain good sleep hygiene, out of habit now more than anything. A relic from more hopeful times. I watch TV in the living room only. No screens in the bedroom. I drink herbal tea, no caffeine after noon. When you’re as tired as I am it doesn’t make much of a difference anyway.

When I closed my eyes I could see shapes dancing behind my eyelids. I tried counting to 100. That never works. Then I rolled over and opened my eyes, staring into the blackness of the room. I have heavy blinds so once the lights are out, it's dark in there. It’s hard to tell the difference between my eyes being open or closed when it's that dark, except having my eyes open seems to reinforce how tired I am. I thought about how heavy my eyelids were, and how badly they wanted to close. I think I dozed off for a bit but the shapes dancing in the static were... distracting. When I cheated and checked my phone it had only been an hour.

Much of the night passed that way. Most nights passed that way. I tried Ambien once but it only made the shapes worse. I slept through the night even with the shapes, but then I started seeing them during the day too, which was worse.

Some days I get my best sleeping done right as the sun is rising. But not that day. The view that morning was spectacular. Gold, blood orange, and crimson. I kept my eye on it as I made coffee in the kitchen. I stood in the window and watched the color bloom over the horizon, the day creeping forward and the clouds like finger shaped bruises in the distance. I stared at them as they moved slowly and changed shape almost imperceptibly, driven onward by the wind. The shapes of them, shifting, ever shifting. 

I burned my foot. I came to after I spilled some coffee on the floor. It wasn't a bad burn, but it worried me. I zone out often. I'm not blacked out, I'm just not totally with it. Like I said, I don't usually see the shapes during the day. I mopped up the spill and decided my foot didn't hurt that badly. I hopped in the shower, changed into work clothes, and got ready to go. 

I was about two hours early. I sat and skimmed a few news articles on my phone. The banner on one of the websites was another one of those ads. Big blue letters on a lemon yellow background. I sighed, and pinched the bridge of my nose. I'd tried a slew of things over the years. One more wouldn't help. But it wouldn't hurt, either.

I didn't click on the link, because I'm morally opposed to web ads, but I did dial the number.

A cheerful sounding man answered the phone. “Good morning! Trouble sleeping last night?”

I laughed, a tired, rasping, worn out sound. “Try every night,” I said.

“I’m sorry to hear that,” the man replied. “This is a clinical study. If you pass the screening we will pay you $500 per night, if you'll come in and do some sleep studies with us.”

I perked up at that.

“May I ask your symptoms?”

“Insomnia, mostly. But I have trouble staying asleep.”

“I see. Do you ever have racing, intrusive thoughts when trying to sleep?”

“No.”

“How about sensory experiences? Sensation of falling, twitching limbs, inexplicable loud noises?”

“No.”

“Bad dreams?”

“Well -” I said. I wasn't sure how to describe it.

“Do you dream?”

“Yes, always.”

“What are your dreams like? Do they recur or are they different?”

“They're all pretty similar. I see these shapes - patterns - sort of like a kaleidoscope. They're always folding in on themselves and reforming. It's sort of uncomfortable to watch. It usually wakes me up if I stare at them for too long.”

“Are you in these dreams, then?”

“Well, I mean I’m watching them. But I don’t do anything. I’m kind of like a camera that’s just there viewing.”

“No other people?”

“No.”

“Do you ever have thoughts, in these dreams? Do you move around? Do anything besides watch?”

“No.”

“Ever get night terrors? Sleep paralysis?”

“No.”

“Have you been to a doctor to treat your insomnia?” 

“I've tried every treatment there is,” I said. “None of them helped.”

“Well I'm happy to inform you, you've passed our initial screen. Our study is for atypical forms of insomnia that are resistant to treatment. We try to rule out anxiety disorders, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, things of that nature. We'd like to have you in for a more in-depth screening before we proceed to the sleep study. The doctor will want to examine you and he can explain a bit more about what the study entails. He can also tell you how many sleep studies to expect. Usually patients do three, minimum, but it can go up to eight.”

“Okay,” I said. “Can we do lunchtime? I go on break at 12:00. So I can be there by 12:30.”

“Perfect. And what day works for you? Today would be great. Or I can do Friday, or let's see...”

“Today is fine,” I said. What was Mary going to do? Fire me? From my low paying, unskilled job? The horror. 

He gave me their address, the Behavioral Science building at the nearby university, and the name of the head researcher. I googled and it was all on the up and up. The school has a decent BS unit (ha ha, very funny, I know). The head researcher was a real person with some published papers on things I didn't understand, but sounded legitimate.

At 11:30 I made a point of checking my phone. “Oh shit,” I said. “I forgot I had a doctor's appointment. Could you cover for me?” Sarah agreed. Mary took off for her nooner and I left right afterwards. With luck I would be back before her and she wouldn’t know I was gone. 

I got to the clinic a bit early. I was surprised; it was a real clinic. It looked more like a hospital than a college. I wandered up to the receptionist and he pointed me in the right direction. I took a narrow beige corridor to a bank of elevators. Just three, actually, but even that seemed like a lot. The building wasn't huge.

I got off on the fifth floor and followed some crude word art signs with arrows that said “Sleep Study.”

I made it to the office. There was a small lobby area with several doors. It looked like a mix of offices and exam rooms. A bell chimed as I entered through the heavy glass door. I was ushered into an exam room by what I suspect was an undergraduate student. She vanished before I could ask anything. There was only one real chair so I sat tentatively on the battered exam table. 

The doctor swept in after a brief wait, tablet in hand. “You're early,” he said, extending a hand with a smile. “Doctor Smith.” 

“Michael,” I replied.

He was tall, and had the kind of face people would describe as patrician, or my sister would describe as a silver fox. He had his hair neatly combed back and his streaks of gray formed crisp waves.

He sat down in the chair across from me and leaned back. “Let me tell you a little bit about the study. My research is primarily based on neurons. Synapses, the neurotransmitters that travel between them, that kind of thing. If you remember your high school biology classes, the brain is basically an organic computer. Your thoughts are made up of billions of neurons firing electro-chemical signals to communicate with other neurons. The synapses are the links between the neurons. They're the circuits on the circuit board.

“What we've found in some of our studies are certain markers of a certain kind of abnormal brain activity. As far as I know, it's never been documented before. So we’re exploring it. The people who exhibit this type of abnormal brain activity experience it when they sleep. It disrupts their sleep, in fact. They usually suffer from what we are calling treatment-resistant insomnia.

“Medications like Ambien will force you to ‘sleep.’ They flood your system with the shut-down neurotransmitters. It's like a hard power cycle, so to speak. Your body powers down. But we've found it doesn't affect the abnormal brain activity. That continues. It disrupts the other functions your body is supposed to perform, so even when you are unconscious, you're not truly sleeping, and you do not feel refreshed.

“Our funding for the initial research is to determine what the abnormal brain function *is*. However, we've found that attempting to measure and record this brain activity actually tends to improve patients’ symptoms.

“Think of it this way. We give you an agent that binds to your neurons. It lets all the normal signals through, but not the abnormal signals. It absorbs those signals, and they activate the agent. They light up like Christmas lights, showing which neurons are being sent a signal. We can monitor them and start to piece together a picture.

“The cure for your insomnia is for us actually just a side effect of the research. However we've found that it is quite effective - in people with this specific disorder. There are other kinds of treatment resistant insomnia that unfortunately are not responsive to this treatment, since it is very specific. 

“But that brings us to you. You're here today so I can determine if you have the kind of insomnia that we are looking for. Sound good?”

“Yeah,” I said. I followed about half of what he said, but he sounded smart. “Are there side effects?”

“Well, patients who respond to treatment report a total cessation of dreaming. The agent itself is harmless. If you have this type of insomnia, we will be able to measure it. If you don't, nothing will happen. The possible side effects are nausea and vertigo, usually seen within the first few days. Occasionally nighttime headaches. But those are rare and subside. In my experience, most patients have no side effects whatsoever. I should also mention, it is permanent. The effects cannot easily be reversed. They may wear off over time, but we haven't had enough long range studies to know.”

“Okay,” I said. “Where do I sign?”

He laughed. “Let's do the screening,” he said. “You scored highly on the initial questionnaire. Non-narrative dreams, trouble staying asleep, resistance to other treatments. And the... shapes, as you call them.”

“Yep.”

He unlocked his tablet screen and started scrolling through it. He asked me a fairly exhaustive list of questions, starting with my medical history, my family's medical history, and then moving on to the specifics of my sleeping habits. He seemed excited about the MRI I had for my concussion when I was 19. My poor reaction to Ambien. And the sleep studies I'd had done, though I told him they were unhelpful for me. “All data points,” he said cheerfully. “We're trying to build a profile for sufferers of this condition. Old medical records will help.”

He then asked me a series of questions about my dreams. He wanted to know all about the shapes, whether they had ‘auras’ or ‘intentions.’ He talked about them like they were people, almost. He asked how I felt when I looked at them, how I felt about them, what I thought they were. 

It kind of stumped me, to be honest. I had never really thought about what they were. “They're just... They've always been there,” I said. “It's like seeing a floater in your eye. It's not anything. They're distracting but just white noise.”

“But you describe feeling upset when you look at them.”

“I mean, not, like, upset upset,” I said. “It's like in the movies, how acid trips look. Just off kilter and not how shapes are supposed to look.”

He was writing on the tablet with his stylus.

“Look, that sounds stupid,” I said. “I wish you could see them. You'd understand what I meant.”

“Let me show you something,” Dr. Smith said. He tapped on his tablet. “Hold on one moment please.”

He held up the screen and *the fucking shapes were on it*, in some video. “Where the fuck did you get that?” I asked. I turned my head but kept my eyes on the screen. I wanted to look away but couldn't. There was something mesmerizing about the gentle undulating shapes, a monochromatic shimmer that made me think of an oil slick somehow. A dark rainbow. I could almost feel my brain puckering and twisting, trying to grasp the strange rhythm of the thing. It was dizzying. I clutched the edges of the table. 

“What do you see?” he asked.

“You know,” I said. “The fucking *shapes*.”

“And how do you feel?”

“Just turn it off, okay? Bad. I feel bad. Turn the damn screen off.”

He obliged, glancing down and hitting the pause button as if he didn't see what was wrong with the infernal things. He opened his notes back up. “I'm writing down that you are distressed,” he said.

“Fine.”

He checked my vital signs and my pupils. “Consistent with a stress reaction,” he said. “Elevated pulse, pupils dilated. Sorry about that.”

“How did you get that video?” I asked.

“We got that from another patient,” he said.

“How? An artist recreation?” I asked.

“Actually, it's created from the measurements we take. Before the sleep studies we're going to need to do another assessment. It's a fairly intensive brain mapping exercise. Cutting-edge stuff, really. We can map the way your brain reacts to stimuli, and later, when you're sleeping, track which neurons are lighting up in your brain. Some of our graduate students wrote a really ingenious little program that can translate between your brain mapping results and the data we get from your dreams.”

“And you can make a video of it? Just like that?”

“More or less.”

“That’s incredible! It’s like science fiction or something!”

“The technology has been in development for several years now. A researcher in Japan did some groundbreaking work a few years ago and the team here has really refined the methods. It's not perfect and it doesn't seem to work as well in other applications, but in settings with only small amounts of sensory input, when your brain is not otherwise engaged in complex processes, we've had… results.”

“Results?”

“It's hard to say whether they're good or bad. You're an unusual case. Most people can't see the phenomenon - the shapes. And if they can, they can't recall them for long after waking. They all, however, seem to have the same aversion to the video I just showed you. It's unclear why. The research team and I can't see anything when we watch it. It's just static. But our test subjects all have a similar reaction to what you are seeing.”

“Why? Why does it look different to me than it does to you?”

“Have you ever seen one of those magic eye pictures?”

“Of course.”

“There's a subset of the population who can't see them. They see the colors and the shapes of the flat image, of course, but they cannot see the hidden three dimensional image. I'm not talking about the people who don’t know how to cross their eyes, either. There is a subset of the population for whom stereopsis - depth perception - never developed. Their individual eyes work just fine. But their brain doesn't know how to process the information it receives, to translate it into depth. Their brain never learned to coordinate the input of both eyes.” 

“I… don't have any problems with depth perception.”

“Of course you don't. I do.”

I rubbed my eyes. It's tough to follow conversations when you're working on about two hours of sleep. The doctor didn't seem to mind. I got the feeling he really liked talking about this subject. 

“In this metaphor, you can see the extra dimension. Space. Depth. Whatever you want to call it. Your brain possesses the function to calculate it. You developed the skill at a critical age. Or, possibly, you possess some fundamentally different brain structure from me, in a subtle way that we have yet to recognize. But the fact remains, I cannot see the Magic Eye. For some reason, I, and most people, lack the capacity. Does that make sense?”

“Oh. I guess so,” I said. “My brain invented a magic eye.”

He smiled. “It's all a hypothesis, of course. That's how we got our funding. To test it. It’s an interesting phenomenon, really because it raises so many more questions about what we can and cannot see. As a species, and as individuals. But don’t get me started, I’ll go on for hours.” He waved a hand and stood. “Do you have any questions for me?”

“So how does this all..work? I mean, the brain mapping and the sleep studies and stuff.” I was fairly excited, to be honest. This guy sounded like he knew what was wrong with me. And like he could fix it. This was completely different from the  many doctors I'd seen before, who shuffled me from specialist to specialist and ordered the same battery of tests over and over again.

“Well, we’re going to want to have you in to do the brain mapping first. Unfortunately that is time consuming and you have to be awake. We’ll need two roughly eight hour sessions, though you’ll have breaks during them. It’s $400 per session.” He crossed his arms, tablet tucked into his armpit. “After that we’ll start with the sleep studies. We will do once a week for as many follow ups as we deem necessary - and as long as you’re willing to participate, of course. Some people we have all the data we need after the first three. Some people take a little longer. We compensate those $500 per session plus travel, with a $250 bonus at the end for completing all the sessions in the full course, as determined by me and the other clinicians. Where do you work? Near here?”

“About twenty minutes, I took an uber here.”

“Keep your receipts for the travel next time and we can submit them for reimbursement.”

“And the...mapping. What is that?”

“Well, we’re going to put you in an fMRI machine and measure your responses to things. Colors, images, things like that. We’ll map which parts of your brain light up when you’re thinking about a particular subject. 

“Let’s say we want to isolate the color red. We’ll say ‘red’ and see what happens. But there is so much context your brain carries around with it all the time. So it helps to try it a bunch of different ways. We’ll say, ‘tomato,’ and ‘rainbow,’ and other words that relate to colors to try and pinpoint the ‘red’ brainwaves. So if someone says ‘fire truck,’ a hundred parts of your brain might light up, but we should be able to positively identify the red center is one of them. In theory, anyway. We’ve found this works in simple cases and laboratory settings. Not as well in complex ones.

“We’re primarily interested in the visual cortex so we’ll be showing you a lot of images.” He must have seen the look on my face because he added quickly, “Not that video. We actually want to show you everything *but* that. We want to map what *you* see when you sleep, not what we’ve already shown you. The goal is to see if your brainwaves can create an identical video.” He glanced at his watch. “I'm happy to answer any questions you have, but I have another appointment in a few minutes. Can we get you started on the paperwork?”

“Sure.”

He handed me his card. “I'll always answer my cell. You can email me too, of course, but if you have any side effects during the study and want to call me up, please do. Someone will be in shortly to go over all the release forms with you,” he said. “It was a pleasure to meet you.” He shook my hand and left. 

A different undergraduate (or maybe graduate) student than the one I saw before came to get me. “If you'll step into this office here,” she said, gesturing. I caught a glimpse of another person in one of the occupied offices. He was working on his computer and I had the sneaking suspicion he had a *shape* on his monitor but I looked away before I could be sure.

The office was cluttered. The woman apologized for the mess and laid out several packets of forms. 

She walked me through the medical release forms, the payment terms, and the NDA. Her voice rolled on in a soothing accent I didn't recognize. She gathered up my signatures and put them in a file folder. She produced one last sheet of paper, with another line at the bottom for my name and the date. It simply stated that the research team/university owned all of the data collected from my brain and that they were allowed to use it for research purposes. I touched the pen to the page but before I could sign, she put a hand on my wrist. I looked up. Her eyes were hazel. They had little flecks of green in them which I noticed because she was trying to bore a hole in me with her stare.

“You understand this means we will own your dreams,” she said. 

I laughed, but she didn’t join in. 

“That’s a strange way to put it,” I said. 

“But not wrong. They put the receptors in your brain. We intercept the signal. It never reaches you. It’s like someone taking your mail out of your mailbox before you ever get to see it.”

“If it means I never have to see another one of those goddamn things again, I don’t care. Hell, I’d pay *you* to take them. The money is really just extra.”

She looked down at the page, and took her hand off my wrist. “Do you believe that dreams have power, Michael?” she asked. The emphasis was on the wrong syllable of my name.

“No,” I said. “Is there something about this study you’re not telling me?”

She shook her head. “The doctor dresses it up and makes it sound clinical. I just want to make sure you understand exactly what you’re signing up for when you do this. Many cultures have special beliefs about dreams. It’s not too late to back out, if you feel uncomfortable. If you don’t sign this form, we won’t treat you.”

“Are there any bad side effects I don’t know about? Bad reactions?”

“No. We have nearly a 100% success rate. We think that people who don’t respond to the treatment may not have the kind of dreams you have, despite making it through the screening. Though we can’t be completely sure. As the doctor said, the main side effect is no dreams. This is the first study of its kind, so we can’t guarantee long term effects. The drug itself is safe, but you may acclimate and start dreaming again. We don’t know.”

“Why are you working here? It seems like you don’t want me to participate in this study.”

“If I leave, they replace me, with someone less concerned about getting your informed consent. I don’t think helping you sleep is a bad thing. But my mother would be furious if I didn’t at least explain to you. She was very spiritual. She believed in dreams. I do too, but in a different way. That’s why I’m here.”

She looked like she was about to say something else, but I signed my name and pushed the paper towards her. She spun it around to look at my signature for a moment, her fingertips pressed to the paper in a gesture that reminded me of a salute, before slipping it into the manilla folder with the rest. 

“Okay, Michael,” she said. “That’s all for today.”

I was cheerful at work when I got back. In a stroke of luck Mary wasn’t back yet. So I’m not going to lie to you, I put a normal half hour lunch break on my timecard and figured what she didn’t know didn’t hurt her.

Saturday rolled around and I headed back to the clinic. I had to answer another impossibly long questionnaire about my medical history before they would put me in the fMRI machine. The brain mapping itself was actually quite boring. They would flash an image of a square on the screen for a few seconds. Then a circle. Then a triangle. They would ask me to say out loud the name of every shape. We did colors, weird squiggly lines, simple patterns, things like that. They let me take a break every hour or so. I made it quick though, sipped some water or ate a complimentary bag of chips and then hopped back in. I was anxious to get through it and on to the main event. Both days were uneventful. 

Over lunch I got to chatting with one of the tech guys. I was asking him about the study and he shook his head. “Weird stuff, man.”

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“Well, I’m not as involved on the research side of things,” he said. “I really just run a lot of the equipment. But the stuff they’re doing... I mean I’m sure it’s all fine,” he said, realizing who he was talking to. “I just wouldn’t want people poking around my dreams, you know? I’ve had too many about Scarlett Johansson.”

We laughed, but I was starting to feel a little uncomfortable. Was it so wrong of me to want to get rid of my dreams? Maybe they were a part of me, after all. Some crucial, subconscious part. I did some googling about what dreams are. Turns out people have guesses but no one actually knows. 

But then again, I reasoned, people get parts of them removed all the time. All kinds of amputations and -ectomies. I was just having a dream-ectomy. They go in and literally slice up your brain if you’re epileptic. Taking a pill to divert some chemicals is pretty tame in comparison to that.

I asked the doctor when I saw him what they were going to do with the data they were collecting. The videos. 

“We’re not sure yet,” he said. “A couple of the students here want to base their thesis on interpreting the things. If you recall the release form you signed, it was designating your data for this purpose. We’re all taking cracks at it. The person who can come up with some kind of explanation for this may end up being the next Freud.” He laughed. “Well, as famous, but hopefully not as infamous.”

“Can I - could I see them when you’re done?” I asked. “The videos, I mean. Not the dissertations or whatever. I assume those take a while.”

“Of course,” Dr. Smith said.

The brain mapping went off without a hitch. It was a week between the brain mapping and the first appointment, to give them time to set up the program that would interpret my dream.

The days sped by. The shapes were no less unsettling or distracting, though I wondered often what it would be like if they disappeared. I wasn’t sure what I would be like. Would I have a lot of energy? A better mood? A better complexion? I wondered about this better version of Michael. He had never seemed more possible.

I took the drug the morning before the sleep study, as instructed. I went to work like normal. The day was, like so many others, unpleasant but uneventful. After work I went to the clinic. I had laughed when they asked me to come in around my normal bedtime. “I’m an insomniac,” I said. “I fall asleep at four in the morning.” They scheduled me for 9 p.m.

They hooked me up to a bunch of sensors. Head electrodes and a bunch of other stuff. I was laying on a hospital bed in a small pink room with what I assume was a one way mirror. They had said they would be monitoring me throughout the night. 

I was just as tired as I always was. The nurse prepped me and left the room. She turned the lights off on the way out. I lay in the dark and let the red static of my eyelids play across my eyes. I thought about how one way mirror and two way mirror mean the same thing, kind of like flammable and inflammable. 

And when I opened my eyes again, it was because a different nurse was shaking my shoulder. 

“What?” I asked groggily.

“It's six a.m.” she said. “Time to get up.”

I sat bolt upright, startling her backwards. “What?” I said again, in shock. I started ripping things off of me and swung my legs off the bed. 

“Please don't do that, let me help you,” she said, reaching for my arm. But I tore every electrode and pulse monitor off my body and was storming towards the door.

“I need to speak with the doctor.”

I slammed the door open and he was there, in the brightly lit hallway, looking alarmed and holding out his hands to placate me. “Look, Michael, please-”

I wrapped him in a bear hug. And then I cried like a baby. He patted my back awkwardly and after a moment, peeled me off of him. “Karen, could you...?” 

The nurse sighed. “Please, Michael, let's sit you down,” she said. 

Dr. Smith said he would be back shortly and the nurse guided me back to the cot. I was still crying a little. “I haven't slept in years,” I said. I felt wonderful. I guess that's how most people feel all the time.

“I know,” she said, not unsympathetically. She handed me some tissues and didn't interrupt as I spoke at length about how awake I felt. She simply gathered up the discarded medical equipment and arranged it precisely in order. When Dr. Smith came back she left with it.

He handed me a steaming cup of coffee. It smelled bitter. It was crappy hospital coffee. “I don't need it,” I said. 

He shrugged. “I'll leave it here. Years of caffeine addiction isn't going to go away overnight,” he said. 

I don't know,” I replied. “You might be a miracle worker.”

“I have to do your status evaluation now,” he said. “You feel good? Rested?” 

I laughed. 

“When did you fall asleep?”

“Right away,” I said. Couldn't have been more than a few minutes.”

“Any dreams?”

“None.”

“No shapes?”

“Not a goddamn one.”

“Good, good.”

“It's too early to have anything definitive but the data we pulled looks promising. Your brain was lighting up like Times Square. I think this will be quite useful in my research.”

“Glad to help,” I said.

They ushered me to the showers to get ready for work. When I got out I headed to the sink to brush my teeth. I slicked back my wet hair and smiled. The bags under my eyes were still there, but I fancied they looked less pronounced. I didn't have much time to admire myself because I was interrupted by a noise in one of the stalls.

“You okay?” I asked. It was clearly someone crying. I only said something because it seemed weirder to let them keep crying if they hadn't heard me come in. 

The door creaked open and a young man came out. His dark eyes were bloodshot. His skin was dark enough that he didn't have obvious racoon eyes like me, but I imagined if he was as pale as I was he could have given me a run for my money. 

“Hey man,” I said. 

“Hey,” he said hoarsely. 

“You okay?”

“I'm fine,” he said. “Just trouble sleeping.”

“Oh, are you in the study?” I asked. 

He laughed; a rasping, unamused sound that I knew all too well. “No. I work here.”

I realized he had a badge on. His name was Darrell Wilkins. “You work for Dr. Smith?”

“Yep. I'll be watching your dreams in a couple hours. We need to have some idea of the direction to take our research soon. So that we have time to analyze all the data.”

“Ironic, isn't it?”

“What?” He was splashing water on his face.

“Well, you're losing sleep over helping other people get to sleep.”

“Yeah,” he said. He didn't sound amused.

“Well, thanks for your work,” I said.

“Yeah, sure,” he mumbled, examining his eyes.

The rest of the day was uneventful. I got to work and was happy to be there for the first time. It was the same old shit but I had energy. I paced around and whistled. I didn't make any mistakes, which was new for me. 

Night rolled around and I went in for the second sleep study. I was out like a light as soon as I closed my eyes. Next thing I knew they had pulled the bed out from the machine and a nurse was shaking me awake.

Dr. Smith took me aside and showed me my video. The one they made from my dream. It was me and a couple of grad students crowded around a monitor. The shapes started moving when they hit play. The strange pattern within a pattern began to undulate, folding in on itself like a sentient wormhole and my skin started to crawl.

The grad students seemed mesmerized, leaning it to get a closer look. “Do you guys see the shapes?” I asked.

Darrell was there, and he said, “I can almost make out something,” he said. “It's like a pattern in the static...” He trailed off. 

“I can't see a thing,” a woman declared.

Another woman said, “Well, we don't have to be able to understand them to compare them. I'm going to have Steven do a statistical analysis between these and the other subjects to see if there are any similarities in the frequency of...”

Dr. Smith ushered me out as they began arguing. Darrell stared at the screen, pensive.

The third sleep study started off fine. I fell asleep quickly and awoke to a hand on my shoulder.

“Morning already?” I asked. I opened my eyes. It was still dark in the room but I could tell the bed had been pulled out from the belly of the machine. There was a man standing by my bedside.

“Hey, don't you usually turn the lights on?” I moved to sit but his hand was pressing down on my shoulder.

I rolled sideways and grabbed his arm. “What the fuck, man?” As soon as I laid a hand on him, his other hand slammed down on my chest, pushing me down into the bed. He found my neck and started choking me. I started flailing, scratching at his arms. I hit his face and my palm came back wet. Something was dripping on me. 

He was screaming, “I can see them. I can see them. They're here for you. Take them.” His voice sounded strange. Like a man who wasn't accustomed to yelling. Or maybe who had been yelling too much. It was hoarse and crackling.

A nurse burst into the room, flicked the lights on and pulled him off me. It was Darrell. He was a pretty fit dude but this 5'3" nurse was an absolute champion. She dragged him backwards while screaming colors, and names, and for security. It was a losing battle; she had got his hands off my neck through sheer surprise but he elbowed her in the face and lunged at me again. He fell onto me, hands on my chest, when two more nurses sprinted in and came to restrain him. The first nurse regained her footing and helped them. He was still screaming. Security arrived shortly after. The guard tazed him and he went down. He and the male nurse dragged him out of the room and closed the door. The remaining nurse examined the first nurse's face. "Broken nose," she said. "Better get down to the first floor." The first nurse sighed and pressed a paper hospital gown to her face to staunch the blood. She left. 

The nurse turned to me. "I want to say you're lucky Carmen was about to check up on you when she was, but I guess it's not lucky that one of the researchers had a psychotic break. So it's probably a wash." She was examining my neck. "Any sharp pains? Tenderness?"

She continued to palpate my bruised neck, but found nothing out of the ordinary - besides what you would from a failed murder attempt, I suppose.

The rest of the day was a blur - not a sleep-induced blur, but a series of hectic new situations. I had to give a statement to the police, the university strong-armed me into being thoroughly checked out and getting some scans (at their expense), and I had to sit through a confusing meeting with a bunch of administrative staff and Dr. Smith where they discussed the implications of me remaining in the study.

For better or for worse I waived most of my legal rights. I didn't want to sue the university; not after their research program had cured me. Not like I had the money to sue anyway. I heard that Darrell got admitted to the psych ward. I and several other witnesses attested to the fact that he was a nice enough, not-psycho dude, without ulterior motives - when he wasn't, you know, trying to murder me. They said it was probably stress induced, possibly the onset of a mental disorder. He was in his late twenties which the doctor said is about the right age for that.

I had to call out sick from work to deal with the whole mess. The university said they would take care of the lost wages. They also promised to get me ten counseling sessions to process the trauma of nearly being murdered in my sleep. By the end of the day I was feeling strangely calm. None of it mattered; not really. I felt well-rested and clear headed. Even my tiredness had the sharp, pressing sensation of something new. It was different from the persistent, dull ache I had lived with for well over a decade. I went home for the night and when I lay down to go to sleep, I fell asleep almost immediately. I did not dream.
