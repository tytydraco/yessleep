**Chapter 3: Dionysus** 

 Augustine Dubois enjoyed a party. He believed it to be ultimate expression of human freedom. 

“*If I was to imagine heaven it would be a never ending celebration. Food and drink from every part of the world. With music that makes you dance. So if we are too make paradise on Earth it must be a celebration. Gare must be a celebration for it is those that are truly free that can attain heaven”* ***Augustine Dubois Memoirs 1871***

It was under this philosophy what we would call a beer hall was built in Gare in 1846, Dionysus’. The establishment would be owned and operated by Augustine and his family until its destruction in 1937. Dionysus’ derived its name from the Greek god of wine making as Augustine and later several of the inhabitants of Gare brewed their own liquor. The building, originally just a small single room hut would become the cultural heart of Gare. When a new group arrived from the USA a celebration was held in Dionysus’. The local Sioux and some traveling Europeans would infrequently join in the festivities

*“While crossing through the* *prairies we came upon a colony of freed slaves. They invited us to their local saloon, nothing more than a small hut. It was without a doubt the most interesting experience of my life. They gave us some of their local liquor and we danced and sang all night. Never have I felt such joy and warmth”* ***Juan Pierre Nault, Fur-trapper 1851*** 

In 1863 after the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation by USA President Abraham Lincoln it is said that the sounds of celebration could be heard for miles. Augustine now a grandfather is said to have danced and sang until dawn. Dionysus’ the coming summer would be renovated into a modern two story building with a stage. In 1864 Augustine’s eldest son Augustine Gomez II began operating the establishment from his father. His younger brother, Toussaint would assist him starting in 1866

Between 1866 and 1874 Dionysus’ was in a period of renaissance: 

*“With the end of the American Civil War in 1865 many freed slaves began to make the journey back south. However a few traveled north to Gare. They had heard of Dionysus’ from other free men and wanted to see it for themselves. What made the establishment special was its mix of differing African, French, Indigenous and Caribbean cuisine. The Gomez family had an open kitchen policy and would serve any liquor their patrons brought. It can be said that Dionysus’ was a celebration of the African experience in North America”* ***Thomas Jefferson: Hidden African History of Canada 2014*** 

However the party would begin to slow in the late 1870s as more Europeans began to move into the area and free-men abandon Gare for metropolitan areas. Some of the immigrating Europeans would venture into Dionysus’ but would find the establishment too foreign and alien. Due to the dwindling African community the more exotic foods and drinks disappeared from the menu. Conflict would arise in 1878 when Manitoba’s first Liquor commission stated that only one bar was allowed per 300 people. The few Europeans, mainly Irish in the area had started their own small drinking club. But fortunately the group agreed to drink in Dionysus

However a deeper conflict was brewing with the Mennonites and Noah Meyer. Under their religious doctrine the consumption of alcohol was viewed as a sin. Furthermore there where racial tensions between the groups, in particular Meyer and Augustine Gomez II the latter viewing Meyer a thief who had stolen his father’s legacy. While Meyer viewed Gomez as a drunk and practicing witchcraft due to the various traditional African ornaments in Dionysus’

The first battle of this conflict would be fought in 1883 when the province requested Dionysus’ obtain a licence to operate. Meyer took the opportunity to write a letter of protest to the provincial capital in Winnipeg: 

*“…Dionysus’ is a den of iniquity. If it is allowed to continue operating it will pollute the good Christian people of Gare with drunkenness and vagrancy. I implore you to up hold the morality of our province and refuse Augustine Gomez a licence to sell alcohol. Furthermore I request a formal inquiry into the activates conducted at Dionysus’ as it is the belief of myself and the good people of Gare that witchcraft is practiced there”* ***Noah Meyer letter to Manitoba Provincial Liquor Commission August 21st 1883***

Meyer’s request was denied and Dionysus’ was allowed to operate. However the growing religious population in Gare resulted in fewer customers and soon Dionysus’ was a shell of its former self. In 1892 the Province of Manitoba voted for Prohibition but it wasn’t enforced. In 1899 the province once more voted for prohibition but the resulted was nullified due to poor voter turnout. However Augustine Gomez II was feeling the pressure mounting. Several of the African residence of Gare had begun to go to Meyer’s services and attendance was dwindling month to month

It was in 1902 that the Gomez family decided to focus on converting Dionysus’ into a restaurant. They would continue to serve alcohol but only with meals. Their traditional menu full of exotic foods would also be abandoned for a more traditional European palate. The open kitchen policy started by Augustine Dubois would come to an end. An Irish bartender and cook would be hired to attract the second growing demographic in Gare

In December 1904 the murder and disappearance of members of the Byrne family would make international headlines. Locally the town was devastated and opportunistic members of the church blamed the tragedy on Thomas Byrne’s love of the drink. Several would even attempt to blame Arnold Gomez, claiming he had killed the family due to Thomas’s disapproval of his and Edith Byrne’s relationship. The police would investigate the Gomez family in relation to the murder of the two Byrne boys in 1905. But the entire Gomez family was cleared of all charges. Unfortunately Augustine Gomez would die due to a heart attack the same year. His brother, Toussaint had moved Ontario several years earlier so Dionysus’ became the responsibility of Augustine Gomez II’s only son, Arnold

In 1907 Arnold would marry Edith Byrne and the two would operate the Dionysus’ until the tragedy of 1937. Arnold would bar-tend and Edith became the cook. In 1909 the couple welcomed a daughter, Maeve. In 1911 they had a son, Alexander Gomez. In 1916 the province instituted prohibition and Dionysus’ officially became an Irish family restaurant.
