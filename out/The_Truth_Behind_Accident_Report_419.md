That is the official report of what happened and already anyone could smell something off about it, I am William Woods, the very same listed above. I was the only one to make it out of that hell hole alive. They told me to keep quiet and forget that this ever happened, they also told me if I told anyone about what I saw I would never make it to my 30’s. Jokes on them, I don't want to live with what I saw. On that day, August, 28th, 2013, it was like any other, we were excavating for a new sub-level when Anna started shouting to Dean about a slab of concrete in the ground, as you saw from the report Dean called Jack and Jack told us to bust it open, so we did and we must have woken up that thing.  


We clambered in to find a concrete room with stairs down. As we went down them the signal to Jack got weaker and weaker until we got nothing but static. We started to hear scratching behind the concrete wall that lined the stairs. After what felt like an eternity we finally made it to the bottom of the stairs that then led to an even bigger plain concrete room. I almost threw up with the stitch of death that lingered in that room that had been there for god knows how long. Once I got over it enough to move I shined my flashlight across the room only for it to die halfway across. I smacked the thing but I got nothing, Anna’s died in the same way, all that was left was Dean’s. That's when the scratching started again but instead of it being on the other side of the wall, it was on the floor in front of us. Dean shined his light as the sound to see a bone being dragged into the darkness.  


I couldn’t describe to you the feeling of a primal instinct but it is powerful. Despite my urge to run being strong my will to know what was back there was stronger. Apparently Dean and Anna had the same feeling because all at once the three of us walked forward. When we made it close to the other wall we heard something scurry further back. We should have left right then because I saw it, just before it ran away. It was emaciated and almost human, but it was too long to be human. The flashlight illuminated a doorway and I stopped moving instinctually but Dean and Anna didn’t, I was just about to call out to them about cornering animals when it grabbed Anna with the speed and ferocity of a person who hadn’t eaten in weeks but just made it to an all you can eat. In the blink of an eye Anna was gone and I heard her screams but it was silenced by a deafening crunch.  


Dean and I turned to run but again in the blink of an eye Dean was gone and his flashlight dropped, once more with a sickening crunch he was silenced. I didn’t look back, I didn’t dare. I ran up the stairs at a speed I didn’t think was possible. I never stopped, not when Dean told me to help him, and not when Anna told me to wait up. I didn’t slow, I didn’t falter, I didn’t hesitate. I finally made it up to the first room, and for once my luck was on my side, the team had a ladder set up and I climbed it faster than I ran up the stairs. I continued to run until I was a good distance away, a roar was heard that shook the building above us and I saw it start to clamber out of the hole when 5 huge flood lights shone on it, and for the first time I saw it, it looked human other than the strangely elongated head, the beast had no hair, and no mouth but it still roared again then retreated.  


The hole was filled and the plans for sub-level 4 were canceled. The government, posing as the construction team, reassured the company that the roar was faulty equipment and due to the structural integrity of the soil, and natural gasses being nearby they could no longer work on the sub-level. The company was not happy with it, I was put in a form of witness protection, I was given a new name, a new home far from that godforsaken place, and a new job. By all accounts William Woods died in a tragic collapse in an unmarked basement of an abandoned building. It's been years and I finally have the balls to tell the world about that damned creature.
