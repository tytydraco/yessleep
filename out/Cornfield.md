I am a hunter on the western side of Texas, I am writing this in my notebook because I don’t think I am ever going to escape this cornfield. 

Yesterday at around 1 P.M. I got in my Bronco and drove out to a brand new hunting spot that I had yet to see. My brother had told me he was going there 2 days ago and that was the last anyone in my family heard from him. I drove for around 3 hours and turned down a dark dirt road. I turned on my headlights and slowly navigated my way down it, at this time the sun had begun to set over the horizon and the pitch black invaded the road in front of me. I followed it for around 2 miles before a sign jumped in front of my lights. I pulled in front of it, it read “Private Property”. Against my better judgement I grabbed my rifle and flashlight out of the back seat and climbed out of the Bronco. 

I started down the path and eventually it led to a cornfield, looking back now I wish I had turned back there and never pushed further. The path had stopped in front of it and there was no place to go but into the field. I slung my rifle around my body and held the flashlight above my head, pushing through the corn in search of my brother. I had been searching and yelling his name for around 10 minutes when I realized I would be better off trying again in the morning. I was worried however as it would be 3 days with nobody seeing him then and I doubt he brought enough water for one. I started walking before stopping, I realized I had no clue where my truck was, as the sound of the crickets infested my ears and the beads of sweat dripped off of my brow I started to worry. I decided to choose a direction and stick with it, I spun around looking for any indication of a specific direction to go but it was all the same. 

I started down one way and walked for around 5 minutes before tripping over something large and fleshy, It startled me, causing me to drop my flashlight. Getting up I retrieved the flashlight and when I shined it upon the rotting horse carcass I yelled a few obscenities and dropped the light again I snatched it up off the soil and began sprinting away, I didn’t want anything to do with whatever the hell that was. 

I had ran for around 10 minutes straight before I came to a stop and began drudging my way forwards. I noticed the crickets had stopped chirping and it was eerily quiet. I was stumbling along when the beam from my flashlight was interrupted by yet another rotting horse, this one was rougher than the last, dry blood covering the upper half of its body. Its throat had been slit and  it appeared to have been mangled by a pack of wild dogs. There was something off about it however, more off than the fact is was mutilated beyond belief but it looked as though it was bloated by something inside of it. I ripped my bowie knife out of my leg holster and slowly cut into the horse, I had sliced a good foot along the belly of the horse before something horrifying appeared, a hand popped out of the horses abdomen. I stood up and threw up on the ground next to the horse carcass and gathered myself. I had to know what it was, I sliced open the horse more and discovered that it wasn’t just a hand but an entire body stuffed into the horse. I was horrified, almost threw up a second time but held myself back, I began looking for some sort of identification of the person, however I was shocked to see my brothers gun sticking out of the waistband of the body inside of the horse. I screamed and fell back on my back, knocking the wind out of me, I began hyperventilating and almost passed out. I knew then I had to get out of there. 

I thought of all the possibilities of what could’ve happened and came to the conclusion that some psycho must have killed him and stuffed him inside of the horse. Then a horrid thought crept into the back of my mind, did the other horse have a body as well? I didn’t want to find out, I started a slow jog continuing through the cornfield. 

I was walking along when I stumbled into a clearing, I was horrified when I saw all of the rotting horse carcasses, there was at least 10 of them, but in the middle of them all was a rock that i’m sat upon now. I have cut open all the horses and every one has a body inside of them. I don’t know how to get out of this hell or what is even happening but I believe the only thing left to is pray to whatever god is watching over this place, if any.
