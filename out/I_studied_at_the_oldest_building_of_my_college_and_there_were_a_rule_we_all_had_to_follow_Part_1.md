 How to begin? or should I say if I should begin or not because I have been warned not to tell anyone. But I can't keep this to myself anymore especially if it means I can save someone. So, okay. Let's begin.

This all started ten years ago when I first started college, the same college my dad went to (in fact I pursued the same bachelor's degree). With all the bright-eyed and hopeful and slightly scared group of students I walked to the building where I would learn how to become the best civil engineer the world has ever seen. It's a beautiful building and it has supposedly been in existence since 1840s but I'm in love. It's absolutely stunning. Every single detail is so intricately made that I can't wait to study.

We have our student orientation so we move to the auditorium and I make a few friends, well expected future friends. It goes as expected, you know- word hard, be punctual, blahbitty, blahbitty, blah. But then our Head of Department turned serious like really serious and went

"Please don't go into rooms that are out of order or locked." He looked at us with all the seriousness a HOD can muster, which is a lot.

I giggle thinking of Harry Potter and how Dumbledore warned student about the fluffy room and the dark forest, in fact many students chuckle but none of the teachers do in fact they all have the same look of extreme fear. This makes me stop laughing. Why were they scared? Was it because of our HOD most likely.

As our classes start, I forget about all the forbidden stuff. I'm here to study, have fun, make friends, basically have a proper college life. It isn't until our first year almost passes that something happens. It was our Basic Physics class and we were trying really hard not to sleep when a scream pierces the quiet. Our professor and all of us tagging along run outside. There's a girl screaming her head off while looking at the classroom. The professor runs to the girl trying to calm her but she pushes him off with a force so great that he lands about 2 feet from where he was. Everyone is quiet now; the only noise now is of the girl's scream and the professor's quiet voice trying to calm her. But nothing happens. The girl now walks near the wall beside the room and grabs it before, we all knew this was coming but all us yell in shock when it happens, she bangs her head against it. It's not light, it is skull denting- the force with which her head collides with the wall. Our professor gets up and runs to her but it's as if she's possessed.

"Get help!" He screams at us while trying to save the girl.

No one moves until I push two of students towards the stairs that lead to the ground floor. It's as if our whole floor has come out of a collective stupor. Half of us rush to help the professor while the other half calls an ambulance and other things.

It takes a combined effort of ten people to pull her away from the room's side. As soon as we are back a sufficient distance, she collapses like a rag doll.

"Close the damn door." Professor says as he tried to ebb the flow of blood from her forehead.

No one moves. It's one of those locked rooms that we aren't supposed to open. How is it open?

I look at the unconscious form of the girl and gather my courage. I move forward but my friend grabs my hand.

"Not alone." Ana says looking scared but then she squares her shoulder. "I'm coming with you."

I nod. Thankful to have such a friend. We move closer to the room and a chill seep into my bones. The chill that tells you to run, run as far as possible. Ignoring it, we move closer. As we reach the door, Ana let's out a scream and my heart stops.

It's a boy revolving in air a few feet above ground like he is being roasted over a flame (and why we didn't see him from the window).

As soon as I touch the door the body falls with a thud and for a brief moment, I think I heard something. Something that sounded close to *Finally!*

Edit: There's a grammatical mistake in the title. I'm sorry.
