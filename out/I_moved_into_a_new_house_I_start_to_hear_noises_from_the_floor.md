I've recently moved into a new house after a family of four moved out, I didn't know them, but their house was a steal, so I just had to buy it. I check through my boxes of stuff and seeing they didn't pack my medication so I have to stop by the pharmacy later. It wasn't long until everything was strange. I heard noises and speaking coming from the floorboards and the basement. At first I couldn't sleep, not even a wink, the agonizing noises just terrified me. I couldn’t understand any of what was being said. Eventually I got used to it, I even responded to many things spoken by this thing, I humanized it by giving it a name, David. Our conversations weren't much, we only spoke when I layed in bed since thats when David wanted to talk the most. I never started our conversations too, I just waited for the gurgling and spoke.

"Gragggaggaag...!!"

I awaited that noise, it gave me joy in my boring life.

"Ah, why hello David! Ive been waiting, bit late are we?"

I responded calmy, despite the obvious issues and problems with talking to a random voice. Perhaps it was some ghost.

"Gahrahrahragggg!!"

David said back in some kind of a neutral way, I don't understand him. Our talks didn't last way to long, but I liked the company. Suddenly one day, the walls have spoken to me, it’s always only been the floorboards and basement. It caught me off guard. And now, what was before just random gurgling and just some random mess of words. The floor became understandable, now it tells me it was my fault. I tell it that it’s crazy. I can’t be blamed for all of it. However the floor seems to be different from the basement, I can't make out the voices in the basement. Those voices sound different though. Not different because of the tone and pitch. Different because it’s like they were talking about something else but I can never hear them. Only faint mumbles and whispers. I decide, tomorrow I’m going to go into the basement so I can ask them to leave. Tonight I will sleep though.  

 In the morning I drink some coffee and walk to my basement entrance. I walk down the steps, creaking can be heard upon my feet landing on each step. As I reach the last step. They speak up. The whispers. The darkness was just as empty as the black of night. I pull the string hanging from the ceiling to turn the lights on. Oh, theres David and his family. They are still rotting. I meant to take those out. I make the mental note to burn them in the backyard of my property as that'd be the easiest way to dispose of them. I couldn't believe I forgot about them. Perhaps I should've packed extra medication? I'll make sure to pick up more Chlorpromazine after I'm done with the family. I slowly drag the parents out from the basement, they're the heaviest so the kids will be next. As I continue to the patio door I can still hear the screams from the kids, they must be upset, but I keep moving onwards. The smell is horrific, better get done fast. My posture is slumped as I go back down to the basement to get the kids this time. Their heads keep thumping against the stairs, it annoys me. Finally, when they are all reunited, I grab the gas can I conviently have next to my barbecue grill and I proceed to pour everything over their bodies. I grab the matches I keep on me and light their bodies ablaze. I feel relieved. I go back inside to sleep, the voices can be heard but it's more like screams now then gurgling. I feel at ease as I drift off to sleep.
