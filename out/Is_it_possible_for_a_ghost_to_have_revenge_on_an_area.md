I live in a small town in New York. My father’s side of the family has been in the area since the early sixties when my great grandfather immigrated from the Dominican Republic. When I was 14 me and my father took a trip to Philadelphia to continue our quest to go to every baseball stadium in the US and Toronto. 
We went to the Betsy Ross house and at the time I was obsessed with ghosts, ghost adventures was my favorite show back then now I’m 17. 

Some old tour guide did tell us that a ghost does preside in an upstairs bedroom. I was psyched and I asked my dad if he ever saw a ghost. He said he was close, there was an old church in the middle of nowhere in a nearby small city where my dad went to school. It was built in the 1900’s and it was used as a school. But in the 1970’s it burned down and everyone unfortunately died. Many children and one nun was in the building at the time and she hung herself knowing that god would punish her. For some reason the city kept it up it has been demolished in 2013, my dad heard of this story and when he was 18 him and his cousin went into the old church.

He went through the back and had flashlights to see in the dark. My dad went through the entire building the old gym the old classrooms most were in ruin from the fire 20 years eariler, Things fell off shelves! ooooh nah im lying the whole exploration went well. Until somebody in a nearby apartment complex saw the flashlights and called the police my dad was arrested for incriminating a minor because my dad’s cousin was 15 at the time. 

Thankfully my grandmother got him out because she said to the police that he is a good kid and he is a very good soccer player. I thought it was the most intense story I ever heard because I could have not existed if my grandmother didn’t step in. I searched the place up and saw articles from the area I live in kinda spooked me. 
2 articles saying that condominiums on the exact spot where the church stood caught on fire and has been burned to the ground. Once would be a one off thing but twice in the same spot where a massive tragedy took place has some supernatural events to be involved. Like I said it was demolished in 2013 and condo’s have been built on the spot and surrounding woods since then. It is pretty weird that houses on the same spot burned down maybe the ghost nun wanted revenge on the land i don’t know. I went to the spot and as of know there is no house on the exact spot where the church was but the houses before it is still there. Maybe the city knows of the ghost nun

I always joke to my cousin Nick who is the son of my dad’s cousin that when I am 18 and he is 15 we are going to an abandoned building and exploring like our fathers did all those years ago. But the example of the houses burning does give me the theory of ghosts are real and it could have life changing effects.
