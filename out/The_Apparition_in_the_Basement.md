I grew up in a small town in the Midwest with my mom and my four years younger brother. The house we lived in wasn't particularly remarkable; a small blue one-story villa with a finished basement and a small garden filled with large lilac bushes. The lilac house, as the neighbors in the block used to call it. I loved growing up there; my brother and I played in the garden year-round, and we always had our friends from nearby houses close by. When we were little, my brother and I had separate small rooms on the ground floor, and my mom slept in the large room in the basement. When I became a teenager, my mom suggested I take her room in the basement instead, which was a bit more private and larger.



I accepted somewhat reluctantly. You get to the basement through a winding staircase in the hallway. Upon descending into the basement, you enter a corridor about ten meters long leading to several smaller rooms: two storerooms to the left, an old boiler room to the right, and straight ahead, the bedroom. Standing in the doorway to the bedroom, there's a frosted glass door to a larger, private bathroom immediately to the left, and then the main part of the bedroom to the right. The best way to arrange the room is to position the bed so you always have a view of the frosted glass door to the bathroom and the door leading out to the hallway.



When I was very young, I had recurring nightmares about standing in the middle of the room with the feeling of being watched. In the dream, when I would start running upstairs in panic, there was always someone chasing me and grabbing my foot just as I almost reached the top step of the winding staircase. The dreams always ended with me being dragged back down to the basement. I always woke up drenched in sweat and terrified. But now I was twelve, and those earlier nightmares were just that. Dreams. Nothing to be afraid of, right?



So, I moved down to the basement. A larger bedroom and my very own bathroom outweighed any nightmares I'd had as a child. At first, things were fine, but after just a few nights, strange things started happening. A couple of months after moving down, I turned off the lights in the basement as usual and got into bed when I heard creaking from the stairs at the other end of the hallway, as if someone was walking on them.



"Mom?" I called out.



No answer.



"My brother?" I tried next.



Still no response.



I figured it might be someone's footsteps from upstairs echoing down, so I pulled the covers tighter, closed my eyes, and tried to sleep. But the footsteps continued. One by one, they descended the stairs and entered the corridor. I was certain: these were footsteps. I called out to my parents again, to check if maybe it was one of them coming down to say goodnight again. But there was no answer. Then, it went silent.



I lay there listening for more sounds, but heard nothing, and eventually must have fallen asleep. But that's how it continued, night after night. The only change was that each evening, the footsteps seemed to come closer.

One dreadful night, to my horror, I heard the footsteps reach right outside the door to my room. I sat bolt upright in bed, turned on the lamp on my bedside table, and stared at the door, but saw nothing.



I sank back into bed and reached for the lamp switch when my gaze caught the frosted glass door to the bathroom, and I froze. Behind the frosted glass, in the dim light from my bedside lamp, I could discern a blurry dark figure. It stood close to the frosted glass, but I couldn't make out any facial features.



For a couple of terrified seconds, all I could do was stare at the figure, which was about as tall as an adult man. Then the paralysis broke, and I curled up in bed, pulled the blanket over my head, and hid. I slept very, very poorly that night, of course with the bedside lamp on.



The following week, I convinced my mom to buy a curtain to hang over the bathroom door. Additionally, I started leaving a small lamp on at the end of the corridor by the stairs each night to have some form of light in the corridor. It didn't make things much better, though.



The next evening, I heard the footsteps on the stairs again. Slow creaking. One step at a time until I could hear them in the corridor outside. They stopped just outside the opening to the bedroom, and then silence fell. I lay with my eyes shut against my pillow for a while, feeling the thick silence in the room as if all the air had gone. Eventually, I dared to glance towards the bathroom door. The curtain hung loosely over it. I lifted my head from the pillow and peered into the dimness of the room. That's when my heart stopped.



In the doorway stood the same figure that had been in the bathroom before. It was partially hidden by the wall but peeked out into the opening. Half of its body was inside the room, as if it had been trying to sneak in but got caught halfway. The dark shadowy body faced me, slightly crouched, and the black gaze was fixed on me. I couldn't see its eyes, but I was certain it was staring directly at me. I screamed and threw myself back into bed, pulling the blanket over my head. From the stairs, I heard loud thuds, and then the ceiling light in my room turned on.



"What's wrong?"



It was my mom's worried voice. I looked up. There she stood, disheveled in her nightgown with her hair askew. What could I say? I must have been dreaming, even though the unsettling feeling lingered. I blamed it on a nightmare but followed her upstairs. For the remaining few hours of the night, I slept on the couch.



Seeing ghosts is hardly a sign of sanity. Instead of telling my mom and risking being locked up in a psychiatric ward for the rest of my life, I began meticulously following a routine every night:



I played my favorite CD on repeat. That way, I wouldn't hear the dreadful footsteps on the stairs.



I wrapped myself completely in my blanket. From toes to ears, I buried myself in the bedclothes. I'm not sure if my hope was that "it" wouldn't see me, or at least I wouldn't have to see "it."



I slept with the lamp on. I have no idea how this would help, but it felt slightly safer in the light of my ceiling lamp, not having to be aware of the dark corners of the basement. After all, "it" had never dared to approach when it was light.

To my great relief, I noticed over time that if I followed this routine and neither saw nor heard "it," I could eventually relax and sleep through the night. I slept in that room for four or five more years. Every night, I adhered to the same routine.



As time went on, I grew older, and although my nighttime habits never changed, the memory of the entity became hazier and hazier. I never completely forgot, but the feeling of unease faded until after years passed, I didn't know what I was afraid of anymore. My younger brother became a teenager and started talking about how much he would like to have the larger bedroom. Since I was only a year away from adulthood and moving out, I felt it was only fair for him to take the more secluded room in the basement. I could live with the smaller bedroom for another year. So, we switched. After all, no one else in my family had ever complained about discomfort in the basement, so maybe it had just been nightmares those nights long ago?



It was summer, I remember that. The last year I lived at home. I had been accepted into a program in Gothenburg, and I was getting ready to try something new. The moving boxes were packed, and I was excited. Among the last days I was home, we were supposed to have lunch together, my family and I. My brother, as usual, groggy in the morning, needed a little help. As lunchtime approached and my mom had set up snacks in the garden, my brother still hadn't gotten up. My mom asked me to go downstairs and wake him up. Who would refuse to wake their younger sibling from a good night's sleep? Certainly not me.



I went down to the basement, making sure to turn on all the lights. In his, previously my, bedroom, I paused. His radio was on. Not so strange perhaps, except it wasn't tuned to any station. It just emitted static. I turned it off, woke up my brother, and told him to come upstairs.



Later, as we sat in the garden having snacks under the lilac bushes, I asked him about his radio, if he knew he had accidentally turned it on during the night. He went silent. Looked down at the ground and quietly chewed on a cinnamon bun. Swallowed.



"No, I turned it on before I fell asleep."



Something grew in my stomach. I tried to laugh it off, but the laughter caught in my throat.



"But... you know you didn't have any channel on, right?"



My brother looked up at me.



"Yeah... but it doesn't matter."



I was silent. Mom fell silent too, looking at my brother.



"It doesn't matter... As long as the radio makes noise, then... Yeah."



I didn't know if I wanted to hear the rest.



"As long as the radio makes noise, I can't hear it."



I don't know what was worse. My brother's experience... Or my mom's silence, and the pale look on her face that betrayed she had always known exactly what was down [there.](https://www.youtube.com/@luridhub)
