This is just a simple 'one time' thing that occured to me and my sister awhile back on a drive to our local YMCA. And before I begin, this is a true, and isolated incident that happened once and has never, thankfully, happened to me again. Do I lose sleep over it? Not really, but I do get goosebumps each time I drive down that hill, especially at night. This is one of those things that you want to have a reasonable explanation for but just don't have one. Sometimes reality can be stranger than fiction. 

This took setting back in February of this year. A few months short before our family YMCA membership would be cancelled for good, due to my dad being unable to find work. We would usually visit this community gym and pool about two to three times a month anyways. But we were trying to go more often, to use it while we still could. That day my younger sister and I set out late to the gym. At 8:00 pm the night sky was pitch black in colour and only fleeting grey clouds could be viewed against its still backdrop. There was nothing scary about night time in the outskirts of the city where I live in and the weather was nice. So we had no fear of getting snowed in or dealing with crazy drivers. In fact it's kind of rare to see drivers on the the road that takes you there. 

To paint a better picture of the route. We live in a suburban neighborhood at the far north end of a major city in our province. The YMCA is located 15 minutes south west of us. There's two ways to go about getting there. First one is to use the major roads and spend 30 minutes driving. Second and most commonly used route by my family was to head momentarily out of the city using the back roads to the west until you turn onto a road leading you south, back into the city limits. It's more fuel efficient and buys you time. The catch is, there's no lamp posts, it's your typical country road after all. You have to be thankful at the very least that it's paved. Now the reason why this area has not been put under the knife of suburbia directors and city managers is because its rather hilly. There is especially a part in the road trip that we call 'the rollercoaster'. Because in a symmetrical U shape - like that you'd see if you perform the cos function on your calculator - there's a sudden drop and rise of the road. It's a two way road divided by two yellow do-not-pass stripes. Each time you'd get other way traffic you'd watch your vehicle plunge down and pass by the opposing vehicle with such closeness and force that you'd both hear and feel the wind thrash against the metal body of your car. The engineers were thoughtful enough to put guardrails throughout this whole hill segment. However, this will just make what I'm about to tell you a bit more unnerving.

My sister and I were listening to her playlist and talking about something small, and not memorable, as our car went through one of the smaller hills that would prepare us for this mammoth of a hill. As we got to the peak I let my foot fall off the gas to prepare for the descent and surveyed the absolute darkness of what lay in front of us. You could only tell apart the sky from where the top of the hill was because the latter was a few shades darker. However all other details of the hill, especially the road on the hill were completely impenetrable to our sight. I could only see what my headlights allowed me to and as they pointed down to the descent that is where my focus shifted to as well. Before we could reach the foot of the hill we both saw the two headlights flash on the top. Now it is rare to see traffic on these roads at our hour but of course it's not impossible, we were on it too afterall. We simply watched as the two headlights also began to make their way down the hill towards us. I reached the bottom first, and my car smoothly transitioned into the climbing portion of the hill as my foot rejoined the gas pedal. We were both nonchalantly observing the road when the two headlights, located midway on their descent, suddenly and inexplicably vanished. It was as if the driver decided to turn off their lights just moments before passing us. 

Ofcourse this panicked me, I swerved as close as I could go to the guardrail and laid off the gas. My sister exclaimed in surprise and braced. However, the car which was supposed to pass us any second now, never came. My sister looked all around us, and per my request looked back to see if the red light of the tail could be made out. Just in case if the vehicle did pass us by and we just so happened to not feel it. However there was nothing, no sign of it even being there in the first place. I made my way up the hill indecisively, dropping from 100km/h to 60. 

We were quiet with disbelief as we let the music play. I almost wanted to stop at the top just to look back for any signs of the vehicle. However, the whole incident really freaked me out at the time, and so I continued to drive. My sister, recovering quickly from the shock, would be the one to break the silence. She would throw out many theories of what could've happened. Maybe there was an opening in the guard rail and the car, after turning off its headlights, pulled to the side? After a closer inspection on a different drive during the day, we both grimly observed that the guard rails were lining the road throughout the descent on both sides. If that were true would've seen it as we passed by. In any case, if it were a freak accident, and the car hit the guard rails and flew out into the hill, we would've been able to see the vehicle on the drive back. Since we made sure to examine the sides of the hill carefully. Unless, ofcourse help had arrived and resolved the situation within the hour or so that we were at the gym. Which I doubt that it'd give enough time for all the emergency vehicles to clear the area. The second theory was more outlandish. But, something that would suit our family history, given my grandma claimed to have seen aliens before. Yes, my sister suggested it was an alien abduction. Not going to lie, this theory is what makes me never want to drive on that road again. I am not a fan of aliens. 

I've driven on that road at night before, and after the incident. But I've always driven with someone else in the car with me. If there is anything supernatural that happened to me on that day. I'm atleast assured, that I'm hopefully doing something within the rules of avoiding an abduction by not being in the vehicle alone. Eitherway, this is one of those events I have absolutely no answer to. Whether it was a mirage car, or an alien abduction, or even a car wreck we failed to catch. I wouldn't be able to confirm it to you. My sister and I sometimes joke on our late night rides that we'll encounter something like it again. But to be frank with you, I hope this remains an isolated case.
