I need to get this off my chest. What happened last night has me so shaken that I can barely function. I hope someone out there understands or has experienced something similar. I swear this is real, and I need to share it.

Last night, my boyfriend and I decided to go to a secluded spot in the woods. It was supposed to be romantic, just the two of us. You know, an isolated place where we could be alone, away from everything…

Anyway, while we were driving there, we had the radio on. They were reporting on a criminal who had escaped from prison. The segment was brief but unsettling. I turned off the radio immediately because it was ruining the mood and, honestly, it scared me a bit.

When we arrived at the remote spot, it was dark, but we didn’t care. We were wrapped up in each other, kissing, lost in the moment. Then, out of nowhere, I heard a noise. It was faint but definitely there. It wasn’t just the usual night sounds. I freaked out and asked him to drive us home, but i guess he wanted to impress me. He said he’d check it out and told me to lock the car and wait for him.

So, I did as he said. I locked the doors, my heart racing, but I tried to stay calm. The woods were silent, except for the occasional rustling of leaves. I waited, counting the minutes. After ten minutes, I was already feeling uneasy. Fifteen minutes in, I was practically on the verge of a panic attack. My mind raced with every possible scenario, especially given the escaped criminal.

Just as I was about to get out of the car to find him, I heard it again - the noise. It was coming from the roof of the car. At first, it was a soft scratching, like something lightly scraping across the metal. I tried to convince myself it was just an animal, but the noise persisted, growing more intense and frantic. My breathing was shallow. I felt paralyzed with fear.

I couldn’t stay there any longer. I was terrified. I had to get out of there, but I didn’t want to leave my boyfriend behind. I took out my phone and called the police. My hands were shaking as I explained everything.

--------------------------------------------

Me: “Hello, I really need your help. I’m at a small spot in the woods with my boyfriend, and I’m really scared. There was this weird noise, and he went to check it out but hasn’t come back for about half an hour now. Please, you need to come right away!”

Police Dispatcher:  “Calm down. Can you give me the exact location?”

Me: “I’m not sure of the exact address, but it’s a secluded area off Pinewood Lane. You’ll need to drive up the dirt road and then it’s a little ways in.”

Police Dispatcher: “Okay, stay on the line. I’m sending officers out to your location. Try to stay in the car and lock the doors. Do you have any idea what the noise was?”

Me: “I-I don’t know. It’s been coming from the roof of the car. It sounds like scratching, and it’s getting worse. I’m so scared.”

Police Dispatcher: “We’ll be there as soon as possible. Try to stay calm and keep the line open.”

------------------------------------------

Minutes felt like hours as I waited for the police to arrive. The scratching on the roof continued, and my fear intensified. I felt like I was losing my mind, imagining all sorts of horrors.

Finally, I saw the flashing lights of the police cars cutting through the darkness. Relief washed over me, but it was short-lived. The officers arrived swiftly and began to approach the area.

I watched from the safety of my car as the officers moved with purpose. One of them, a tall officer with a stern face, started speaking into his radio. “We’ve arrived at the scene. There’s something not right here.”

I heard him say something to his partner, and they began to shine their flashlights around the area. As they got closer, their expressions changed from focused concern to something darker, a mix of shock and horror.

Then, before they even reached the car, I saw the moment they spotted it. The tall officer’s face went pale, and he shouted, “Over here! Call for backup!”

I didn’t understand at first, but then one of the officers came back to me, his face grim. “We’ve found your boyfriend. He’s… he’s dead. The noise you heard was his hand brushing against the top of the car. He is hanging from the tree above you.”

The world spun around me. The horrifying realization sank in. The scratching sound wasn’t something trying to get in. It was his hand, desperately brushing against the metal as he hung there.

The officers were kind but firm, guiding me through the process and trying to provide comfort. I’m still in shock. I can’t believe this happened. I keep replaying it in my mind, wishing I had done something differently. But the truth is, I was paralyzed by fear, and now I’m left with this horrifying memory.

I hope sharing this helps me make sense of it. Please, if anyone has any advice or similar experiences, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.

Stay safe, and don’t let your guard down.
