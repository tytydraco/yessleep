Leane and I have been having a bit of a problem, every morning around 01:01 am there's knock at our window. Here's why I think its gotten outta hand.

The first time I woke up to get a glass of water that's always next to me, that's when I heard it *"Tap tap tap"*, weird I thought to myself. I looked at the time 01:01,I shifted in my bed *Tap tap tap*, it sounded quicker. I chocked it off to my neighbors or whatever at that point I just wanted to sleep. Next day the whole thing was erased from my mind. I went on about my day as usual, came around midnight. 

I woke up to the voice of my girlfriend in my ear "Bae, bae, babe!" she yelled a bit louder as if I hadn't heard her for the past five times, I rolled over "Wha - what? Geez", she had a bewildered look in her eyes "There's someone tapping at the window", she pointed towards the window. The room was dark, except from the light from the moon that snuck through the bottom of the curtains. I shook my head "Babe there's no one--", *tap tap tap*, I heard it. I glanced at the clock 01:01 am it read. And the tapping sounded like someone was using their fingernail to knock on the window. I froze, the room was silent. Straining my ear to listen carefully . Then the tapping grew a bit louder *Tap Tap Tap!*, then a pause. I didn't know what to do but I froze, it was 1 am for crying out loud then after what felt like a long long time I gathered enough courage, I got off the bed and walked towards the window.

My heart hammered in my chest, I don't know what I expected to find. Pictures of ghouls or a clown wielding a quadruple shaped sex toy plagued my mind I had to shake those thoughts off. Each step felt heavier than the previous one, I pulled back the curtains and to no one's surprise it was empty. No one there, except a fogged up window with a message that faded as soon as I read it *_I want in_* I rubbed my eyes, sometimes I have a wild imagination I'm not even sure it was written there. 

I turned around with a smile on my face, trying to act tough "It was probably a brunch, I think", I could tell by the look in her eyes she wasn't convinced, "Now that you woke me can I get a little sucky sucky tucky tucky", I wiggled my waist and pointed towards my penis and she clicked her tongue, "Eww No! No way l'm going to bed", she pulled the blankets over her head. I was too tired to even think about the whole ordeal. 

When morning came the day passed by without any problems, later on it started raining. We somehow fell asleep on the couch watching a Lord of the Rings Marathon for like the 10th time. The rain was faint, signaling it coming to an end, then there it was those knocks *tap tap tap*, the sound was drowned by the sound of rain falling down but sure it was the same knocking, I pulled the covers over my head and snuggled with my girlfriend pretending I couldn't hear a thing. *Tap Tap Tap!* in that same rhythm, I kept quiet, *Tap Tap Tap!* this time it sounded urgent, I squeezed Leane and buried my face on her back. The tapping was faster now *Tap Tap tap* short pause *Tap Tap Tap*, I closed my eyes tight. Somehow I fell asleep.

"So how did you sleep?", she asked me as she handed a cup of coffee "I 'on know", she place her hands on the sides of my face "Are you sure?", she's so pretty I thought to myself "Yes babe I am", Later on that night the knock came at the same time as usual, *Tap tap tap*, I was up doing some work and Leane was finishing her knitting. A moment of silence fell upon us, *Tap tap tap!*, I stood up, making sure not to make any nose, slowly opened the kitchen drawer and pulled out a kitchen knife. I looked towards Leane and she shook her head, then I moved towards the window *Tap. Tap. Tap*, I froze, the knocking was mimicking my steps, I took a step *Tap*, another *Tap*, I ran *Tap Tap Tap* I stopped right near the window, I could see a silhouette illuminated by the moon's light. It looked like a head then quickly disappeared. I couldn't make out any more features, then the scratching began, nails running across glass piercing my eardrums. I dropped the knife and covered my ears. Leane did the same, the scratching off glass seemed to come from nowhere but everywhere at once. It sounded like it was right next to me, just scratching and scratching and more scratching I thought I was going to go deaf.

It got loud and louder, with the rhythmic tapping underneath the glass scratching *Tap Tap tap*! I hurried and pulled back the curtain and Nothing.

I was dumbfounded, "What the fuck. What?", Leane was crouching behind the couch, her head poking out "What the fuck?!" then she stood up and came to where I was. There was nothing on the other side of the window. Well not nothing perse there was a bloody handprint, and scratch marks that ran across the glass. There were so deep you'd think it was a knife that carved them. I had to swallow the bile that was rising from my throat, my heart pounded so loud it mummed Leane's voice she had to poke me "Bryce are you listening", I nodded "Yea yea, what was that babe?", there was a look of fear in her eyes "I don't want to stay here anymore", she was hugging herself. I pulled her close "It's gonna be okay babe it's gonna be fine... It's probably a prank", I wasn't fully convinced.

I know she knew I wasn't even convincing, the truth is I was dumbfounded, I was in total lost as to how could someone let alone a bloody hand print ended up on top of a 12 storey apartment building mind you we're on the 10th floor there's no fire escape no nothing not even a ledge to stand on. So how did whatever that thing was ended up outside my window. The blood was pretty fresh

Morning took longer to come, we spent our day outside. Dreading to go back home, I couldn't take Leane back there so I made her stay at her friend's place. She was adamant at first "Babe I'll have to check it out and see. If the house is safe we'll go there and finish the rest of the month since we already paid rent. If not I'll grab our stuff okay", I gave her a kiss on the forehead, she pulled me closer "Be careful okay Bry", I pulled out my old baseball bat from underneath the bed and wore my old Spiderman costume for assurance. I sat there, near the window watching the clock. Formulating a plan and plotting every move or strategy I could use during these circumstances, they all ended the same. With me winning. Little did I know what awaited me.

01:01 no tap, 01:02 no tap on the window still, 01:03 no tap and yes 01: 04 no tap, I took a deep sigh and laughed at no one in particular, laughing at my own foolishness for thinking up a monster that wasn't there. Then my phone rang "Bry- Bryce it's here it's here" Leane was panicking, I could hear slight tapping at the background of her voice, "Please please come get me please. I'm scared", I jumped off the chair, rushing to get my keys, staggering all over the place "Stay on the phone talk to me Leane!", I was struggling to put on my shoes with the costume on, "Bryce please open the window", she pleaded I could hear the panic in her voice I was already at the doorstep, thoughts of my girlfriend getting mauled or worse flooded my mind and- wait a minute I thought "What the fuck do you mean open the window Leane?", I asked. There was panting on the other side of the phone, a low growl that made the phone vibrate in my ear. Followed was a pause, then I heard the tapping *Tap tap tap*, the window shook "Yes Bryce open the window" her voice seemed to crackle, then it sounded like a mixture of voices, I don't know how to explain it but it sounded evil "I will give you a sucky sucky tucky tucky Bryce" the voice was malicious. I felt a shiver down my spine. The tapping increased its pace *tap tap tap tap*.

I stepped back from the door, then there was a bang! a knock followed, I ignored it, the door knob rattled. The knocks became aggressive, the door shook on its hinges I was afraid whatever was outside was going to break the door. The window shattered, glass flying everywhere I turned around to hear crackling, and sounds of teeth grinding glass. My whole body shook to the core, the baseball bat felt like coal in my hands I dropped it, legs turned to jelly. I felt the weight of the situation falling on me, at that moment I knew fear in more languages than one. The banging from my door was loud and louder it got, I couldn't take it anymore I wanted to crawl into some hole and bury myself hopefully escape this torment. I curled up into a little ball, hugging my knees and buried my head between my legs. The sound of glass grinding escalated, fueled by the banging of the door. Everything, all sounds at once crashed onto me like a wave. I didn't know what to do, run or hide, fight or die. Images of what awaits me outside flashed before my eyes. My life, I had wasted my life and now I'm about to die to God knows what. 

By the time Leane found me I was a sobbing mess. She said I was mumbling something , my costume wet from piss and my own tears. My whole manhood declined that day, there's things in this world bigger than us things that can strip away your very being and leave you feeling exposed. Glass laid all over the floor, scratch marks were found outside my door. And outside the window there were bloody hand prints and foot prints different sizes. Foot prints ran across the ceiling, bloody with claw marks dragging across the room. Ever since that day, I've avoided staying in apartments, I've avoided being near that building.
