I, julie (22F), just might have been the only survivor of this game. There’s no information on the internet, there aren’t any people who have told their stories… or maybe they know better than to tell this to any living soul. But I, you see, am here to warn you. If you hear about the red game. DO NOT DO IT. 

This all happened 2 years ago, just imagine a broke college student on the verge of homelessness. You bet i was ready to do anything to have even an ounce of stability in my life. Money, that’s all i needed, all everyone needs tbh. For student loans, rent and bills. One day i was desperately searching for something, job, donation, scholarship, even one of those woo woo manifestations, anything that might work. Anything that can help, when i came across a manifestation forum, there was only one comment seemingly unnoticed by anyone but me explaining the red game. It read something like:

Do you want one wish that can grant you anything you ask for? TRY THE RED GAME

Things you need: 
1. A room with no windows
2. A lighter or match
3. 1 black, 1 red and 1 white candle
4. 3 mirrors 
5. A chair
6. A knife or something sharm
7. A paper

Procedure:
This HAS to be done at 3 A.M. on the night of the new moon. (I repeat, ONLY THE NIGHT OF NEW MOON) Enter the room where all the things you need are (you should have put them inside the room a day before), place the three mirrors in shape of a triangle, put three candles in front of each mirror and sit on the chair with your back facing the red candle (this is important, never face the red candle).

Once all this has been set up you’ll switch off the lights and cut your wrist, put 3 drops of blood on all the three mirrors, not less than 3 not more than 3. Write your name and the thing you choose to wish for and what you are willing to offer for that wish to be true. Because remember, everything comes with a price. 

Check once to make sure you followed all the rules till now. Now chant this 3 times while keeping your eyes unfocused, YOU ARE NOT TO LOOK INTO ANY MIRRORS AT ANY GIVEN TIME AFTER THIS:

"Hear me,the infernal realm, King of shadows, master of the night. From the abyss, descend and heed my plea. Grant me the power, the wish I seek."

"By ancient rites, I summon thee. Come forth, O king, and hear my prayer. And grant my wish, beyond compare."

After repeating this three times, 1 out of 5 things shall happen, one of the 3 candles will go out or all candles will go out or all candles will remain lit. Follow the next instructions for survival:

If all candle remain lit:
1.) you are to apologise and rub the blood off of the mirror.
2.) blow the candles off and slowly walk away while bowing
3.) do NOT look at the mirrors or look back into the room 
4.) this means that the ritual did not work, you can enter the room on the night of full moon and use it as usual but do NOT enter before the next full moon.

If all candles go out: 
1.) can’t help you with this one, it means that you made a mistake while completing the ritual and have angered the demons.
2.) i’d just advice to pray to whatever gods you think will help or simply wait for death to take you.

If the white candle blows out: 
1.) we suggest you out yourself because this means multiple entities are present in the room and they are NOT happy. 

This is the only way, you don't want to see what they do. 

If the black candle goes out: 
1.) you may proceed but with extreme caution because you have done something wrong but the entity took interest in you and if willing to hear you out
(Further instructions in down below)

If the red candle blows out:
1.) you’ll notice that the room has a very slight and barely noticeable red tint and you’ll smell blood and rotten meat.
2.) wait for the mirror in front of the red candle to crack before you proceed with the procedu-

I don’t think i have enough time, i heard the growl again. I’ll be continuing this if i make it to a safe place alive. Please god please stop the noises for the love of go-
