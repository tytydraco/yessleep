Do you know what *really* causes a haunting?



If you watch TV or look on the internet, people will try to convince you that it has something to do with the undead; wayward spirits, demons, something of that sort. These stories are almost always bombastic and exaggerated, made to promote fear and intrigue, rather than actual science. They are crafted to be the most engaging, keeping you hooked for as long as possible with obviously fabricated drama that features these “creatures from the other side.” 

Ask around town and you’ll find that many people have their own stories about these otherworldly spirits, adding in who they believed those spirits to be in a previous life. You may hear stories of an old underpass haunted by the spirit of the victim of a traffic accident, or the classic house haunted by someone murdered inside years prior. 

All of these get somewhat close to the truth, but ask anybody if they’ve ever actually seen a “ghost,” and you’ll get wishy-washy, half remembered anecdotes that include unexplained movement or feelings of a “presence.” If you’re lucky, you may even get a laughable story including EMF readers, spirit boxes, and proton packs.

All of these people may believe in the supernatural, but they’ve never really experienced it. How could they? Any unexplained occurrence could be described as “supernatural,” literally, “outside of what is natural.” Just as fortunate coincidences may be attributed to divine intervention, frightening phenomena can easily be attributed to restless spirits. No, in order to understand what is truly supernatural, one must first understand where the supernatural comes from.

So to answer this question, I need to explain a little bit about what I do for work. I work for a private security company in an urban area. The company specializes in routine security for apartment buildings, office buildings, and whatever other building needs someone to look after it. Generally, I get assigned to the apartment buildings. 

Usually, it’s a pretty easy job. There isn’t a particularly high crime rate in the city I live in, and most of the apartments are newer and have up-to-date security systems and locks that keep unwanted people out. And really, to tell the truth, it’s not people from the outside that I’m worried about. 

There’s an uncomfortable feeling that accompanies an evening patrol through a quiet apartment complex. Empty halls and silent lobbies lend themselves to a feeling of… longing. Longing for presence. Places like these want to be used, interacted with. However, in these cases, the longing is marked by anticipation. 

These lobbies have chairs that have been sat in. The hallways include various doormats betraying the already existent, if perhaps temporarily muted, presence of someone. These complexes, having already felt the touch of humanity, are content, if not yearning for more.

What I’m getting at is that spaces built for habitation need to be inhabited. When something is built for a certain purpose, it desires, if not demands, to be used for that purpose. This goes for anything built by human hands, whether they be massive monuments or everyday household items. Some objects are better able to communicate that than others and some are content to be used at all, even if incorrectly, but there is always a want. 

Nowadays, with everything being manufactured by machines, this want is diluted to a point that it’s too weak to make itself known. This, in effect, has led to the reduction of reports of poltergeists since the early 20th century.

When it comes to items that were meant to be displayed, generally, these are content to sit and be observed. Monuments are visited frequently enough, and seen even more so, to satiate them. Art pieces in galleries can sit for centuries without problem, but there have been cases of paintings in storage deteriorating, requiring human intervention to restore them before it’s too late. 

This is why many paintings are kept on rotation, in order to fulfill their need to be seen. One of the most famous cases of in-storage painting deterioration is the famous “black painting” series by Goya. Generally believed to be the disturbing works of a man overwhelmed by inevitability, the black paintings show what happens when things created to be seen stay unseen for years. 

There is evidence that the paintings were not originally as disturbing as they appear now, however this has been suppressed by most major news outlets. This is heightened by the fact that Goya starved the works from any form of interaction. Without a reference point, the paintings attempted to approximate what they longed for, but knowing only the pain from which they were born, deteriorated into the vague shadows of scenes and people we have today.

From here, we return to the original question, and to apartment complexes. I’ve walked through numerous apartment buildings, whether they be downtown or in the suburbs, and I’ve learned which are safe and which are dangerous. I don’t mark it on any official report, of course, but everyone I know at the office is aware of what’s going on. 

Contrary to what you might think, it’s not the old, rundown apartments that are the most dangerous. Older buildings are bloated corpses of presence. Peeling wallpaper and exposed subfloors may seem to denote negligence, but they also represent use, or misuse. Stains and dents are evidence of living beings existing in and around those spaces, fulfilling the purpose that they were created to perform. 

These apartments, having gorged themselves on being useful for years and decades, are now in a slow process of decomposition. They pose no real threat, except perhaps to themselves.

No, the buildings that are the most dangerous are those that are void of any life, past or otherwise. Pristine walls, untouched pools, clean carpets. Painter’s tape still on walls and doors. Bright, loud, fluorescent light. Those are the buildings you need to watch out for. Those are the buildings that still frighten me when I’m assigned to them.



Those are the buildings where you’ll find a *real* haunt.



You can feel it as soon as you enter, before even observing your surroundings. Imagine feeling imposter syndrome, but for someone else. Like watching someone try to find a spot in a group they’re not a part of, or that guy trying to crack a joke between every sentence said by someone else. 

It’s an uncomfortable feeling, something between disgust and pity. Now imagine feeling that, but towards your surroundings. The lamps on the wall feeling like they’re trying too hard to impress you, or the carpet holding its breath to see whether or not you’ll like it. It's like it expects something of you, not really approval, not really rejection, but something that’s… part of you. Or perhaps, it wishes to *be* a part of you.

Anyway, that’s sort of what you feel when you first step in. The areas near the entrances usually aren’t too perilous. These spaces have had some people pass through them, whether they be leasing agents or cleaners or what have you. They’re able to watch the people walk or drive by from the window, getting a taste of what it would feel like to be in use. These spaces haven’t yet made it to the level of desperation that deeper chambers have.

As you move inside to the hallways, I want to mention that it’s really useful to have a floorplan of the building. As of late, the office has stopped giving my floor plans for these new buildings, no matter how many times I ask. They claim that the apartment manager refuses to give them one, but I’m not sure if they even ask anymore. If the office doesn’t give you one, you do have other options. Most elevators or emergency exits will have some sort of map near them describing emergency exit procedures. Snap a picture of this as soon as you find it, because you may not have another chance later. 

It’s usually at about this point that I start to feel like someone is watching me. I have to do a routine check to make sure the security cameras don’t have obstructed views, so I take that feeling as a reminder to start to do so. Seeing the security cameras re-centers me, they remind me that there’s at least some form of human presence in the building. 

The first major danger can come from looking down a hallway. In buildings that are half-filled or more, A steady row of doormats can almost always be seen lining the floor. If you see doormats, especially at the doors nearest to you, you can reasonably assume that this will be a safe tour. If you’re lucky, some of the residents will have put up decorations outside their units. Doormats and decorations are markers of a safe building. You might also see a few bins of trash or recycling, depending on the apartment building. These are a good sign as well, and they’re much easier to see, making them effective landmarks. Up to a certain point.

There are two levels of danger when looking down hallways. The first, and more minor, can be identified by a hallway that is completely empty. No mats, no bins, no decorations, nothing. This is common in brand-new buildings, and while hallways like this provoke a certain fear, they are usually in the early stages of haunting, and do not pose much of a direct threat. Still, it’s always better to be on alert. Don’t let your guard down.

The final level is much harder to identify, which makes it all the more important to learn now how to do so. At first, they look similar to level two, but you need to look closer. Level three hallways are marked by normal-looking halls in the space nearest to you, but the further down the hall you look, the more you notice that something isn’t quite right. Almost like a mirage, near the end of what you can see before things get blurry, you start to notice apparition-like doormats. Phantom trash bins. False decorations. Nothing solid, nothing you can really define, but a shape close enough to what you expect to be there that your mind fills in the rest. 

If, and I don’t recommend doing this without further preparation, you start walking towards those decorations, they may start to seem further and further away, like a fixed point on the horizon, moving with you towards the end. Be very careful when trying to follow hallway anomalies, because if you focus too much on the apparitions and start moving towards them, you may find that when you turn around… the way you came has disappeared. It’s like standing between two mirrors, endless copies of the same doors stretching on and on in both directions into infinity. 

If you find yourself in a situation like this, and I pray that you don’t, you can’t panic. Depending on the structure of the hallway, there are a few ways out. If you managed to get a floor plan or a picture of one earlier, now is the time to use it. Try to find where you think you are on the map, turn towards where the nearest exit should be, and start walking until you make it to where you’re trying to go. This has always worked for me, but you never know. If you don’t have a map, look for exit signs on the ceiling or walls. Follow where the signs are pointing and you should find a door that leads to a stairwell. 

If you’re lucky, and the architecture of the building hasn’t become too corrupted, there should be a door, either to the outside of the building or, at the very least, the parking garage. If you get outside you’re safe, but if you make it to a parking garage you’re not out of the woods yet. Most level three buildings will have one or two cars per level of garage, but if you see any with rear license plates, you’re in luck. If you can find a car with a rear license plate with a legible license number, chances are that it’s real. This means that if you follow the road down -or up, if it’s a below ground garage-, you should be able to find the exit and get out that way. Even if there aren’t any legible license plates, there’s still a chance that the architecture is intact enough to include the exit, so it’s worth looking for it anyway. 

If you can’t find an exit, or if there isn’t a parking garage in the stairwell, your best bet, unfortunately, is to go back into the hallway. Depending on how far along the building is, you may or may not recognize the hallway you step back into. There’s always a chance that, by some miracle, you end up back near the leasing office or wherever you entered from. If you end up back in the hallway you were in before, keep moving along and look for another stairwell. Repeat the previous steps, and hopefully you’ll find a way outside.

There’s a chance that when you go back into the hallway, it will be a completely different layout or design. Convex doors instead of indented, overhead lights instead of wall lamps. They may even be different in the slightest way, like a reversed carpet pattern or a lack of peepholes. I’m gonna be honest, if you notice something different after re-entering the hallway, you’re in a really tough spot. I’ve only had this happen to me one or two times. The first time, I was lucky enough to find a stairwell not far from the last one, and this one led outside. The other time… well, let’s just hope you don’t get in a situation like that.

This is just the first step in what you may encounter on the job. It’s hard at first, but you do get used to it. Once you’ve been to a building a few times, it starts to get to know you, recognize your presence. You’ll understand it better, and it will understand you better. Once you’ve been on a building for a few weeks, you start to learn its quirks, remember your way through, and things get easier. Unfortunately, that’s when you’ve got another problem. That’s when the dreams start.



The first haunted apartment building I encountered was called Everview.



I was assigned to it in Fall of last year. I’d only been a security officer for a few months at that point, but I had started to get the feel for the job. I liked it. I enjoyed the flexible hours and being paid per night instead of by the hour. I just had to walk through the building, note anything that was off, and leave. I had gotten really good at being quick but perceptive, and my boss had recently given me a raise for my proficiency. Needless to say, I was overconfident going into Everview. I really thought I had the job down pat. How wrong I was.

Everview isn’t that big of a building. It’s 6 floors, only one elevator, with a small underground parking garage. It’s snuggled between two big complexes downtown, you might mistake it as part of one of its larger brothers. In fact, when I first got there, I spent more time than I’d like to admit trying my key fob on the door to the building on the right. The sheet I got for the building didn’t have a floor plan, so I wasn’t sure from which side I was supposed to enter. Eventually, I found the signs pointing to the leasing office, and I was able to get in.

I entered the leasing office at 11:15. As I walked towards what I assumed to be the hallway, I looked at my phone. No service. Typical. Mountains of concrete aren’t known for their ability to conduct wireless signals, so I didn’t think much of it, since I had already clocked in to my job before going inside. I had on the usual outfit, padded vest, taser, pepper spray, flashlight. I had come to rely on these to protect me during my patrols. I’ve only encountered dangerous situations a handful of times, and only one of those situations had turned violent, and my equipment was more than sufficient to deal with them. I was confident that I could take anything that the building could throw at me.

As I started my patrol, I didn’t notice anything strange. It was obvious that very few, if any, people had moved into the complex. There was a sign to the right of the leasing office that said something like “pardon our dust.” I figured I would take a walk around the first floor to get a feel for the building, then take the elevator up to the top floor and work down from there. I didn’t see the elevator immediately outside of the leasing office, so I set off to the left. 

It wasn’t until I turned a corner that I started to feel like something was off. It was subtle, it always is at first. A slight bend in the beam of light from a lamp on the wall. A slight warp in the pattern of the carpet. The hallway stretches just past where you might expect it to end. It’s nearly imperceptible, but even if you can’t consciously see it, your mind knows that something is off. It plants a seed in your mind, one that festers and grows in the back of your brain, spreading dread as it creeps ever closer into your consciousness. That night at Everview, that seed was first planted in my mind. Even now, I still feel it, growing. Feeding on my thoughts and fears. I can’t even close my eyes without… Seeing it.

The first thing I noticed about that hallway at Everview was a misplaced exit sign. I saw it after I turned the corner, it was the clear kind that hangs from the ceiling, an arrow on the sign pointed to the right. It stuck out to me for some reason, and it wasn’t until I got closer that I realized why. As I approached the sign, I felt a sudden drop in my stomach, the kind of feeling you get when a roller coaster goes over a hill. 

I stumbled back, not understanding this reaction. Nothing had moved, nothing changed, at least not that I could see. I shook my head, trying to shake out the fog that was quickly developing inside of it. Why did I have such a strange reaction to nothing? To this day… I still don’t know why I acted that way. I have my theories, but nothing concrete. Trying to recover, I turned my attention back to the exit sign. It seemed brighter than it was three seconds ago, for some reason. 

I looked in the direction that the arrow was pointing, and it was then that I finally understood. I don’t know how I hadn’t noticed it before, but instead of pointing to an exit, or a door of any kind, the exit sign was pointing to… nothing. A blank wall. I spun around and checked the other side of the hall just to be sure. Same thing, or lack thereof, I guess. 

Turning back towards where I came from, I realized that the pattern of doors to apartments had ended a few feet from where I was standing, and started up again a few feet ahead of me. It was almost as if there was an exit or some other entryway here, but for some reason, somehow, it had been… removed. I could feel myself starting to sweat. Something was seriously wrong here, if not with the building, then with me. Either way, I should try to find a way out. 

I once again looked back at the hallway I had come from, and somehow, it seemed to stretch for longer than I had walked to get here. I could barely see the end of the hall where the corner was. Ahead of me, I don’t even think I could see where the hallway ended. I stood still for a moment, frozen in the impossibility of what I was experiencing, before I turned and tore back down the hall towards the leasing office.

Nothing was chasing me, at least, not anything I could see. I kept my eyes forward and focused on the end of the hallway. Best case scenario, I was just going crazy. If that was the case, I could probably get some workers comp or something.

I started to feel relieved as it grew closer,  and just as I was about to reach the end, I stopped dead in my tracks. A sound. Loud enough for me to hear it, but quiet enough for me not to know which way it was coming from. It was a jingling sound, rhythmic and echoing. I knew this sound. I had heard it before. Keys, hanging from a belt loop on a carabiner, rising and falling with the motion of legs walking. 

I instinctively reached for my keys on my waist. Still in place. The sound stopped, as abruptly as it had started. The silence that quickly filled the hallway was deafening. It couldn’t have come from behind me… could it? Against my better judgement, and in the spur of the moment, I turned my head to look behind me. As I was doing it, I could feel my brain screaming at me not to, but when my eyes focused, what I saw was…

Nothing. The hallway looked as normal as it had when I first entered the building. In fact… it looked almost as if it had gotten shorter. Exhaling, I turned my head back towards the corner.

That’s when I saw it.

It was as brief as a flash, and disappeared before I could even blink. But I know that I saw it. A figure, or maybe just a leg, stepping back around the corner, out of sight. My breath caught in my throat, and my heart sank into my stomach. Nobody was supposed to be here, my manager assured me that nobody had moved into the building yet. 

Maybe it was a leasing agent? A tenant I didn’t know about? My mind filled with possibilities, and before I could decide on the most likely one, I moved around the corner, hand hovering over the pepper spray on my vest. Whoever it was, they had some explaining to do. I whipped around the corner to uncover…

Nothing. Again.

That sense of dread, which before had only gnawed at the back of my mind, now had started to spread throughout my entire body. Something very wrong was happening here. There’s no way that the figure I saw could have hidden themselves before I had the chance to see them. Maybe I was going crazy. Was I under the influence of something? I don’t remember taking anything today. 

I had to get out of there… but now I had a new problem. If, somehow, there was actually someone in the building with me, I had to find them and report them. That’s probably the most important part of being a security guard, even for a half rate newbie like me. My boss would kill me if she found out I had bailed after having reasonable cause to think there was an intruder in the building. I checked my phone again. Still no service, great. Well, I knew that if I continued down the hallway, I would eventually find the leasing office and the exit, and I’d be able to call my boss or the police or something.

With caution, I began walking down the hallway. My entire body was screaming at me to stop where I was, but I knew this wasn’t an option. At this point, I was spooked enough that I had unholstered my taser. I hadn’t loaded it yet, but even the weight of the weapon in my hand was enough to give me a semblance of security. It was at this point that I made my greatest mistake. I spoke to Everview.

“Is somebody there?” I yelled down the hallway. I waited, squeezing the handle of my taser. Silence. More than silence, actually. It was as if instead of the sound waves of my question bouncing off the walls, they were being absorbed, sucked in hungrily. I yelled again: “This is CIPS security, please identify yourself.” Same phenomenon, same silence. I took another step down the hallway, and realized that another strange thing was happening. 

My shoe, if only ever so slightly, sank deeper in the carpet than it should. I lifted my foot out, and saw that it had left a small imprint of my footprint where I had stepped. My other foot, now carrying more weight, began to sink faster into the carpet. Losing balance, I tried to get it unstuck and almost toppled over. In my struggle, I heard something. A whisper, so quiet that all I could make out was one word… 

“*...there…”*

I needed to get out of here by any means necessary. I didn’t give a shit if I got fired at that point, I’d rather be fired than get sucked into the building, or whatever was happening. I had given up on finding the leasing office at that point, all I wanted to do was find an exit by any means necessary. 

I moved as fast as I could through the hallway, my feet sticking farther in with each step. The whispering was getting louder now, and I could make out more and more. 

*“...you’re… there… somebody…”* 

The carpet started sucking my shoes harder, I was worried that they might come off. It was as if Everview was desperate to keep me from leaving, as if it cared about keeping me inside its walls more than anything else. Finally, an exit sign pointing towards an actual door. 

*“…I…*

*…see…* 

*…you…”* 

I pushed on the door, finally feeling the cold, fresh air on my face. I stumbled through the doorway, and the door shut quickly behind me with a loud *thud*. I looked back. The door had no handle. No keypad, no scanner, nothing. I wouldn’t have even known it was a door if I hadn’t just come out of it.

I stood for a moment. Looking forward, I could see my truck, right where I had parked it on the other side of the building. I checked my phone. 11:15. That couldn’t be right…

Deciding not to question fate, I got in my truck and drove home, paranoid the entire way. I didn’t sleep at all that night, as you may imagine, and when I called my boss to tell her about what happened, she thought I was crazy, or worse, under the influence. I was put on probation for a few weeks, but not fired.

Since then… I can’t stop thinking about Everview. I’ve been assigned to a few empty buildings since them, but none of them seemed as far gone as Everview. I’ve become fascinated with them, and something is calling me back… 

It’s like a part of it still lives in me. I dream of it. Those hallways… I know them now better than I know my own home. It’s driving me insane. As terrified as it makes me… I think I’m ready to figure out what’s going on in there. 

I’ve begged my boss to let me cover Everview again, but it seems like the apartment manager dropped us and hired another security contractor. Although… I have a sneaking suspicion that they’ve actually just been going without security detail. After all, with a building like that, it probably takes care of intruders on its own…

My suspicions were confirmed this morning when I got a text from my boss. All it said was “Everview tonight. You already have the sheet for it.” It’s been a few months, and she would have told me if anybody had moved in, that’s standard procedure.

So tonight, I’m going back in. I don’t know what I’ll find, but I’m more prepared than I was last fall. I’ve made sure people know where I’m going — just in case. Even if no one believes this story, someone needs to hear it.

Because Everview is calling me again.

And this time, I’m going to answer without fear.
