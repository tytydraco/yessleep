Working as a nurse in a mental health institution had been my passion for years. The patients in our facility had a variety of mental health issues, ranging from severe depression and schizophrenia to rare and puzzling disorders. I'd seen my fair share of strange and disturbing cases, but nothing prepared me for the patient in Room 314.

We called her Jane. She was found wandering the streets, muttering incomprehensible words, her eyes wide with terror. No identification, no family, no history – just a broken, frightened woman who desperately needed help.

From the moment she was admitted to our facility, Jane displayed peculiar behaviors. She'd often be found staring blankly at the walls or ceilings, as if she was seeing something the rest of us couldn't. At night, she would let out blood-curdling screams that echoed through the hallways, leaving even the most seasoned staff members shaken.

One day, I was assigned to Jane's room. As I entered, I found her sitting on the floor, rocking back and forth. Her eyes were fixated on a particular spot on the wall, and she was murmuring something under her breath. I crouched down next to her, trying to make out her words.

"It's coming... The darkness... Swallowing everything... There's no escape," she whispered. I couldn't help but shiver, feeling a sudden chill in the room.

"Jane, can you tell me what you see?" I asked gently. She turned to look at me, her eyes full of fear.

"You can't see it? It's here... It's watching us... Waiting," she replied, her voice barely audible.

Over the next few weeks, Jane's condition worsened. The things she whispered became darker, more disturbing. She would talk about unimaginable horrors, about darkness that swallowed light and left only emptiness in its wake. She would talk about a malevolent presence that fed on human suffering, always lurking in the shadows.

One day, I walked into Jane's room to find her huddled in a corner, weeping. I tried to console her, but she recoiled from me, screaming.

"Get away! Can't you see it? It's right behind you!" Her eyes were wild, full of sheer terror. I turned around, but there was nothing there – just an empty room.

I tried to convince myself that it was just her disorder, but her words haunted me. I began to notice strange things happening around the hospital. Unexplainable cold spots, objects moving on their own, and other staff members reporting the feeling of being watched.

As the weeks turned into months, Jane's state continued to deteriorate. Her once vivid descriptions became garbled and disjointed. One day, she handed me a crumpled piece of paper, her hands shaking. I unfolded it to reveal a crude drawing – a twisted, grotesque creature with too many limbs and eyes that seemed to bore into my soul. She looked at me, tears streaming down her face.

"Please... Make it stop," she begged.

A few days later, Jane was found dead in her room, her face twisted into an expression of pure terror. The cause of death was ruled as sudden cardiac arrest, but something about it felt off.

And then, it started happening to others. Patients and staff members reported nightmares, visions of unspeakable horrors, and the ever-present feeling of being watched. Even I began to see things – fleeting glimpses of a darkness that defied explanation.

Jane's words haunt me to this day. Was she really seeing something the rest of us couldn't? Was there truly a malevolent force feeding on our fear and suffering?

 Now, even outside the hospital, I can't shake the feeling that something sinister is lurking just beyond the edge of my perception. The feeling of being watched follows me everywhere, like an ever-present shadow. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I see that grotesque creature from Jane's drawing, its eyes staring back at me.

I've tried to rationalize it, to convince myself that it's just the stress of working in such a demanding environment. But deep down, I can't shake the growing fear that Jane was right all along – that there is something incomprehensible and malevolent lurking in the darkness, waiting to consume us all.

The horrors that once seemed contained within the walls of the hospital have now invaded my everyday life. I see glimpses of the darkness in the faces of strangers on the street, in the corners of my home, and in the nightmares that plague my sleep.

As the darkness continues to encroach upon my life, I'm left questioning the nature of reality itself. If there truly is a force so terrifying and powerful that it can invade the minds of the most vulnerable, what hope do any of us have? What can we do to protect ourselves from the horrors that lie in wait, hidden in the shadows?

The legacy of Jane's terror has left a lasting impact on my life, forcing me to confront the possibility that there are things beyond our understanding, things that defy explanation, and things that should never be brought to light.

Every day, I struggle with the fear that I've been marked, forever changed by my encounter with the patient in Room 314. And as I continue to see glimpses of the darkness, I can't help but wonder if it's only a matter of time before it swallows me whole.

That thought alone is enough to keep me up at night, leaving me questioning my own sanity and the limits of human comprehension. Even now, as I write this, I can feel the darkness creeping in around me, threatening to consume everything I hold dear.

It's a haunting and disturbing reality that I'll carry with me for the rest of my days, and I know that I'll never be able to escape the horrifying truth that was revealed to me through the patient in Room 314 – that some things are better left unseen, and some darkness should never be brought into the light.
