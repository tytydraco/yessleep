I spent the first few days ranting, throwing a full-time tantrum. I banged my fists against the walls, destroyed the furniture, smashed the art on the ground and stomped on the pieces. I could punch through the wall, but what appeared to be drywall on the other side may as well have been concrete. I bruised my knuckles slamming against them, always waking up the next day healed. I wondered if I killed myself somehow if I'd wake up the next day? If so, would that make the time jump forward?

I guess I hoped whoever was doing this to me could hear me. Best case, they weren't doing it on purpose and maybe I could somehow alert them. That hope died pretty fast, though. Around day 3, the idea occurred to me that I might be being recorded, and embarrassment peeked it's head through the constant terror I was living in. That embarrassment died quickly, as well, the passage of time wearing down my emotions like water over soil. 

Luckily for me, I appeared to be in some kind of simulated environment, so the sun rose and set, allowing me to keep some semblance of sanity and time. But if I tried to leave the room, even to explore the rest of the house, I'd glitch back to sitting up on the bed. I spent a lot of time jumping out the window or walking through the door, just to end up bouncing on the soft quilted mattress. 

The furthest I peeked my head out the window, it looked like a random suburb, crowded with shaped greenery and cloned houses. The sprinklers even came on once a day, watering the lush green yards, but there were no people. I yelled out the window a lot the first few days. I call this my rainbow period. I had a lot of hope that I would be out soon, I was still brainstorming options. 

I was a little panicked about food, but once I spent a few days there, I realized I had bottomed out in hunger. I was hungry, but I wasn't dying, not wasting away like someone who hadn't eaten for four days should have been. It sucked feeling hungry and thirsty all the time, but I knew I wouldn't die from it. 

Day 15 was the day I really woke up and panicked. The constant hunger, never waning or deepening, was driving me crazy. When I woke, it was dusk, my sleep schedule having disappeared now that I had nothing to do. 

Somewhere in my mind, averse to all logic, I was measuring by weeks. Now that more than two weeks had passed, I began to really think about how long I would be in here and what the purpose of me being here was. 

My despair whispered in my ear, an anonymous fear mongerer. 

*What if this is a test?* it asked.

*What if you've already failed?* it snickered. 

If this were a test, what could possibly be the purpose? If I'd never discovered the supernatural, I'd maybe think I was stuck in a VR or that this were a stupidly realistic dream. Worst case that I'd been kidnapped and kept heavily drugged. The kidnappers could come in while I was sleeping, inject me with whatever and sneak back out. 

But now that I knew how tiny, how insignificant we were in the grand scale, I worried over the perspective of whoever put me here. Do they want to kill me? Are they just hoping I'll do it for them?

Is this some kind of life-force thief, and this is what it feels like, them stealing every peak and valley in my life, leaving me a dried out husk?

Or was this some kind of puzzle I was supposed to solve? What if this is a test for someone who has powers? Maybe no human could ever escape this place and I was just going to rot here, a small forgotten running program. 

The room had a 90's computer in it, on top of a worn tan desk, but it didn't turn on. Neither did the lights. My light came from the simulated sun, or the glow of the street lights that came on at night. It was like I was stuck in a picture, facing the sky, just watching the sun pass over and over again. 

The third week was mostly sobbing. I felt delirious even though I knew I couldn't be. I was mostly ignoring the hunger at this point, having gotten used to it. The thirst was way worse, anyways, my throat a raging mess after screaming half the day. 

I daydreamed about the tiniest sip of the flattest sprite. Among about a billion other things.

Daydreaming was mostly all I had. My dreams at night were filled with terror, faceless clawed creatures pulling me apart. Without a culprit to blame, my unconscious loosely coiled raw horror into a gollum and unleashed it on me. As soon as the demons would pull my flesh apart enough to be unrecognizable, all the scrapped pieces of me would slimily scoot together, smushing back until I was whole again. 

I know it's impossible but I felt like I could feel it the whole time. The widest divide of mushy organs and skin compiling again, shrinking in pain from a huge gash to the tiniest scrape. Until I was uninjured, set loose to be hunted again. 

The thing that bothered me the most about the dreams is that I never stopped running. Somehow, every time felt like a fresh horror, injected with a fresh batch of useless hope. I always ran, and I was always caught. 

On day 29, I made a decision. If midnight of day 30 didn't bring me any new information, I was going to find a way to kill myself. I didn't even know where my real body was, the hours before my entrapment murky and blurred. The life could already be draining from my body, who knows the translation of time from here to the real world?

12:01 rolled around, and I blew out a breath, trying to steel myself. I had basically memorized the layout of the room, so I knew I had a couple basic options. I could try to hang myself with the sheets, use the bedframe to sharpen the desk legs, or use the pillowcase to asphyxiate. 

I've always had a fear of choking to death, so I decided to try the desk legs first. I broke one off easily, grating it against the frame of the bed until it was pointed. 

Tears streamed down my face. Of all the shit I'd gone through in my teens and early 20's, I had left the thought of taking my own life behind. I felt the heaviest sort of despair, one of having every possibly option stripped away and a boot on my neck. 

Desperately, hoping I wasn't playing into anyone's hands, I started to drag the point down my wrist. Staring through my blurred, teary vision, I tried to push as hard as I could. But even with all hope drained from my body, the will to live is hard to extinguish. 

"FUCK," I screamed. My wrist was bleeding, but I knew it wasn't enough. I got up to wearily strip the sheets, when I noticed my hands vibrating, like they'd just woken up, that TV static traveling up my wrist. I shook my hand as it became painful, pins and needles making their way across my whole body. 

I cried out and flapped my hands around like there was a bug on them, crumpling to the ground as my legs went weak with the same static. 

I groaned, trying to curl up into as small a ball as I could, when the pain came to a head in my belly, the streams of electricity meeting and combusting. 

I opened my eyes, panting. 

I was on the ground of a large warehouse. It looked somewhat familiar, but I was too busy rolling around miserably to analyze it. 

I clutched my stomach, the raw ache there stealing my breath. Taking a huge breath of air in, I gingerly rolled to sit up. 

In front of me were three women. A short black woman I recognized after a moment as Moira, the owner of Evans Arcade. A tall Japanese woman that I did not recognize. And to my baffled reaction, Monica, a being I'd met while working a corporate case for Eli. 

I don't know what she is, but I do know she stole my finger. She told me she had gifted me some magic when she returned it, but I hadn't noticed a difference. I was mostly happy about that, magic always came at a cost and I wasn't sure I wanted to pay. 

Besides, of the two, Moira is far more dangerous. Through my muddled memories, I saw her transformation into that of a Jaguar, a gigantic, muscled black cat. I remember her enormous maw tearing into the flesh of...someone? I can't remember who they were, pre-slashing, but the mess afterwards is imprinted on my brain. As frozen in terror as I was, I couldn't help thinking she'd have killed me in a split second if that's what she'd wanted. 

I've known two out of three of these women to be teasing, mischevious, but two wore solemn looks at the moment. Moira looked, if I had to guess, a little surprised and a lot satisfied. 

Monica leaned down, squatting and helping me to shakily stand. As she pulled me up by my arm with way too much ease, she whispered in my ear, "Say thank you, bow, and leave. I'll speak to you soon."

Thinking back, I should have been furious. I know I should be thankful to be alive, but thinking of all the time I spent in torture, miserable and terrified, not knowing when it would end, still sets my teeth on edge. 

But at the time, a gust of wind would have blown me over and I couldn't remember half my vocabulary. So I did as she said, slinking out the door and limping my way a safe distance away before slumping to the ground and weeping. 

I hope I didn't shatter anyone's idea that I'm some supernaturally strong person just because I deal with them regularly. I was shaken after that and it took time to stop living in the fear that I would wake up on that bed, staring at that awful wallpaper and that impotent door. 

By the time I'd cleaned myself up, wiping my wet face on my sleeve, Monica had slipped out and paced over to me. 

"Hi, Sweetie," she said, softly. 

"What the fuck was that?" I asked, still shaking. 

She sighed, "It's a long story, but here are the important bits. If I'd known you were coming here, none of this would have happened. But you did, and worse, you came back."

Weirdly, I was starting to feel a lot less shaken. I wondered if some of my terror and panic in the room had been simulated as well. 

"Moira tricked you out of one of your memories, and when you returned to haggle for it, she tricked you again. I don't blame you," as she finished, she pushed a piece of hair away from my forehead, and I flinched back. 

"Sorry," I mumbled, even though I wasn't sure why.

She smiled, "The trick is on her, actually. She didn't think you would survive the trial, but you did."

"The trial?"

"Ah, yes. Moira is a shapeshifter, as you know. What you don't know is her species is an old one, with a name you couldn't remember if I told you."

I gave her a side-eye, resenting her underestimating me after I'd apparently passed a trial, and she laughed. 

She made a sound that I cannot repeat to you. New letters, new ideas began to fill my mind, and I swayed dizzily, feeling some of that cosmic horror all the kids are talking about. 

The more time that passed, however, the less of the sound, and the mysterious forbidden information, I could recall, and I was grateful.

"All you need to know is that she has a box, a challenge box, that sucks the victims soul into it. It alternates between mind-numbing boredom, whatever your version of that is, and absolute horror. Again, whatever your version of that may be," she finished gently. 

"Souls are real?" I blurted, dumbfounded. Of all the things she just said, that was the thing I stuck on. 

"Well, energy, essence. I don't know, soul is the closest word I know to use that you'll understand. When she pulled you into the box, I was notified through our link."

I raised an eyebrow, lifting the middle finger, the one she stole.

"I thought this was a gift," I said mildly.

She just smiled again, continuing in her rugged Romanian accent "It is. She wasn't sure how to pull you back out, she's never seen anyone survive. So, I came over to get you out."

"Do you know each other already?"

She seemed to start to say something, but hesitated, "That's all I can really tell you for now without putting you in more danger."

I was just about back to myself. The long hours and terror filled nights already beginning to fade away. I was almost angry. I didn't want to forget, I wanted to keep it and obsess over it and never forgive it. 

But I could already feel myself slipping back into my body, back into me. And I soon realized that forgetting would be a mercy. As evidenced here, I didn't forget it all. But the heart-pounding terror of awakening slowly seeped away, day by day. 

"One last question, please. Who was that woman next to Moira?"

"She's...well, she's a demon, sort of."

She laughed at my bug-eyed stare.

"She's Moira's sister. She's who the box belongs to. Apparently, Moira wasn't supposed to be using it, but she let Moira off since you survived."

"Oh, good, I'm so glad to have helped her out," I said bitterly. 

"Hey, having a demon and a shapeshifter on your side could be a real asset," she grinned.

"Oh yeah, they definitely seemed 'on my side', Monica," I couldn't even boil to a good mad. I just got up off the ground and wiped the gravel from my slacks. 

"Okay." I said wearily, rubbing my still sore stomach, "I'm going to go order like 6 cheeseburgers. The next time I see you, I'm going to want more answers."

"Of course, Dear," she winked and curled her middle finger at me. 

I felt just good enough to scowl, waving mine back mockingly before achily climbing into [my truck](https://www.reddit.com/r/foxtales/).
