After what I’ve seen tonight, I don’t think my life would ever be the same. We’re running away from our own home as I write this. Dad has been driving at full speed for the past hour. His forehead hasn’t stopped sweating ever since we left. Mum’s sitting next to me in the backseat, trying to stay calm, but I can see the fear in her eyes. And I? I don’t know how I’m still breathing. I have to remember what happened. I can’t let it go. I have to make sense of it somehow.

An hour ago, I was in my bed, terrified, wondering if Rufus was going to come for me too. I tried to lock my door, but it's been broken for ages, so I just shoved it as far as it would go, praying no shadows would slip through the narrow gap at the bottom.

At some point, I asked myself, *If he comes for me, can I do anything? Is there a way I can save myself?* My room’s on the ground floor. I could jump out the window and hide somewhere, but he's a dog, he’d sniff me out, and when he does, there would be no one to save me outside the house. My only chance was to get to Dad, somehow.

I sat wide awake in my bed for what felt like an eternity. Everything was silent. When the clock struck 2, I thought maybe it really *was* just a nightmare. My eyes finally started to feel heavy, the exhaustion pulled at me but just as I began to drift off, I heard it—the faint sound of a single footstep from the hallway. My eyes snapped open at once. A wave of terror shot through my veins. I had never felt such despair in my life.

But I couldn’t freeze up this time. I couldn't let myself be that scared girl who did nothing. I had an idea. It was a silly idea, but I didn’t have any other choice. I stood up, opened the window, and placed one of my slippers on the windowsill. Then, I grabbed an old, stinky blanket from my cupboard and wrapped myself in it, hoping the scent would mask my presence. It was my only chance. I crawled under my bed and waited.

A few minutes later, the door creaked opened. I felt the fear searing through me. Two legs. Twisted. Unnatural. Skin, muscle, and bone grotesquely tangled. The bones jutted out at odd angles, sharp and brittle-looking. The skin stretched over them was torn in places. Its claws looked—bloodthirsty. But what really made my skin crawl was seeing the fur, Rufus’s beautiful golden fur, now matted and knotted, clinging to the twisted limbs like it had been sewn onto the creature. It really was him. I couldn’t hold back my tears.

He went to the window, grabbed my slipper, and looked out over the yard. I could hardly breathe. I was barely moving, barely thinking. Slowly, I crawled out from under the bed on the other side and began to move toward the door, crouching low, trying to stay hidden. But then, I looked at him. He was directly staring back at me.

My heart slammed into my throat. I bolted. I ripped the blanket off and made for the door. His growl echoed through my chest. I stumbled, nearly tripping over my own feet, but I couldn’t stop. "DAD!" I screamed, voice raw. "DAD!" The creature lunged. His hand hit the jug by my bed. It went flying across the room, spilling water everywhere.

I hit the hallway, but it felt like it stretched for miles. I ran, my legs burning, but my feet barely touched the ground. I could hear him behind me, his footsteps faint but there. “DAD!” I screamed, my voice hoarse with fear. I tripped just before his bedroom door, crashing to the ground. And then Dad opened it.

He saw me, terrified, barely able to breathe. "DAD!" I gasped, throwing myself into his arms. He held me, but his eyes were already on the dog. He was back to his normal self, acting confused and innocent.

A wave of despair hit me. *He won’t believe me! He’ll think I’m crazy!*

But then Dad’s eyes fell to the floor behind Rufus. Water footprints. They weren’t from a dog. He froze, his face draining of color. His eyes locked with Rufus's. For a moment, everything was still. Then, he grabbed me softly, lifting me up, trying to steady my shaking body.

“Clara, honey,” he whispered, “Did you have a bad dream?” His words didn't match the panic in his eyes. He was pretending. I could see it.

"Go on, you can sleep with your mum tonight." he said and nudged me toward their bedroom. I started walking in and Dad followed behind. I held his hand tightly, never looking back at Rufus.

The dog didn’t move, just sat there, watching. But as soon as Dad put one foot in the bedroom, we felt it standing up. We heard its body contorting, muscles twitching, skin splitting, and bones cracking. I had never heard something so grotesque in my life. Dad’s face went pale, his breath caught in his chest. He averted his eyes from the creature, as if looking at it would do something bad to his mind. He pushed me in with all his strength and locked the door behind us.

I could hear the creature just outside, breathing. Its shadow loomed beneath the door. It was standing right there. Dad stood frozen, holding the doorknob in place.

“What the hell are you?” he shouted, voice breaking. Dad had seen it now. It was real. Everything was real. Meanwhile, Mum was still asleep in their bed. She had probably taken sleeping pills.

The creature didn’t respond. Instead, it chuckled—soft, cold. Then it spoke, its voice guttural and wrong. Latin, maybe. It didn’t matter. It was demonic.

Dad spoke again, his voice quivering, “What are you saying? Get out of my house!”

We heard nothing for a minute, then the creature answered, “Martin, you should’ve believed.”

Everything went silent. I remember Dad breathing so heavy. He turned to me, his face full of terror. He whispered, “Clara, get out the window. Now.”

“What?!” I whispered in panic, but he just looked at me with frantic eyes. “Go, now!” he hissed urgently.

I didn’t ask again. I opened the window and jumped. I hit the cold ground hard and ran to the closest bush to hide. I had left Mum and Dad alone in there, but what else could I do? At least this way, Dad didn't have to worry about me.

A minute or two later, I heard Dad shout, “Clara, get the truck!” I sprang up and ran as fast as I could to the driveway, praying I wouldn’t run into the creature. My heart was pounding. I reached the truck, jumped in, and started it. As soon as the headlights flashed on, I saw it. Standing on the roof, just out of the light’s reach. I couldn’t see its face, but I knew it was grinning at me.

When I saw it, I remember a horrible thought crossing my mind, *Did it get p-past Dad?* But before that thought could consume me, I saw Dad running toward me. He was carrying Mum in his arms. She was barely awake. He put her in the backseat and took the wheel from me.

I’d never seen Dad like this before. He floored the pedal, the truck almost tipping over. As soon as it faced the road, the tires screamed, and we were gone. I didn’t dare look back.

“Martin, what’s happening? Where’s Amelia?” Mum asked from the backseat, still groggy.

"Sarah, I-I... Clara, move to the backseat and talk to your mum," Dad replied, his eyes glued to the road.

I moved to the backseat and tried to explain it to Mum while Dad drove at full speed toward the town. She didn’t believe me. She even got angry. But then, Dad snapped.

"Sarah! It's true! I saw it myself, heard it myself!" he said, wiping sweat off his forehead. "I need you to be calm, okay? I'm sorry I shouted at you."

I saw Mum's face change from angry to scared. She looked at me, and I mouthed, "It's true," and my eyes welled up. She took me in her arms, and I held her back. I needed it so much from her.

“But Martin, where are we going now?” Mum asked calmly.

Dad gripped the wheel, his knuckles white. He didn’t answer right away. A minute later, he halted the truck and took his face in his palms. He does that sometimes when he really needs to think.

"Dad, what's wrong? Please, can we not stop?" I said instantly. It felt so vulnerable not to be moving.

"I was taking us to the neighbors. But we can't go there."

"Why not?" Mum asked.

"They won’t believe us. Like I didn’t believe you, Clara. They'll say it must have been a wild animal. If we mention to them that it spoke, they'll think we’re insane. They’ll let us stay the night, sure, but they'll do nothing else. They *can't* do anything else."

"Where else then?" Mum asked again.

"To Elias," he replied.

I hadn’t heard that name in a long time. Elias Moretti is one of the old inhabitants of Millbrook. He used to be the priest of the old church on the hill when I was little. Dad once told me that it was the Moretti family who built that church over a century ago. People used to believe back then, but a lot has changed since.

Millbrook has produced philosophers, physicists, doctors—people who traveled the world and came back with different views. Over the last couple of decades, faith slowly left Millbrook. Father Elias tried to revive it, but he failed. There was a year when no one stepped foot in the Moretti church; not a single person in the entire year. That’s when Father Moretti left his family church and Millbrook. He now lives about forty miles outside town, in solitude.

"Father Elias? Martin, are you sure?" Mum said to him.

"Here, people will call us crazy, Sarah, you know that. Elias will listen to us. He might even be able to d-do something," he said, stepping on the pedal once again.

The truck lurched forward, Dad’s eyes went back to the road. And I couldn’t stop thinking about those words the creature said, *You should have believed.*
