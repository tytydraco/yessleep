A few day ago, I shared a story here about something I experienced while working late at my office job in Denmark. I’ve always been a skeptic — I still want to be — but what happened that night shook me to my core.

After I posted, I started quietly asking around the building. I didn’t tell anyone exactly what I saw. I just asked if they’d ever felt like something wasn’t quite *right* in the building after dark.

What I found out was worse than I expected.

I’m not the only one who’s seen something.

And now I think… it knows who I am.

If people are interested, I’ll try to keep asking around — but I’m starting to worry that talking about it might be making it worse.

  
After I shared my story here, I started asking around. Quietly. I didn’t mention what I saw. I just asked if anyone ever felt… off, being here alone. Late at night. Or on weekends.

Three people gave me that same look.

That pause.

That slight narrowing of the eyes, like they weren’t sure whether I was messing with them — or whether *I’d seen it too.*

And when they finally told me what they’d experienced, I realized something terrifying:

It’s not haunting one office.

It’s *moving.*

The first was Henrik, a tax consultant down the hall. He told me that for months, he thought he was going crazy. Papers moving, lights turning on at night even when he was the last to leave. He once found his office door *open* in the morning — and he always locks it.

But one night, he stayed until close to midnight. And as he walked toward the exit, he saw something in the reflection of the glass doors.

Behind him.

A figure. Thin. With *arms too long* and something growing from its head. At first, he thought it was some weird art poster on the wall behind him — until it *tilted its head.*

He turned. Nothing there.

But when he turned back toward the glass again, the figure was *closer*.

He ran. And just before the doors closed behind him, he swears he heard something scrape along the tile floor — like hooves.

Another woman, Emilie, said she once got stuck in the hallway during a power outage. It lasted only a few minutes, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that she wasn’t alone.

She turned on her phone flashlight and started walking. That’s when she saw something dart across the hallway — not running. *Crawling.* Fast. Like a spider.

She screamed. But the building was empty.

When the lights came back, everything looked normal. Except for a wet smear on the wall, low to the ground. Like something had pressed its *face* against it, dragging sideways.

She moved out a month later.

But the worst story came last week.

And it wasn’t a story.

It was a warning.

It was late Friday afternoon. I was packing up to leave when a man I’d never seen before approached me near the stairwell. Mid-50s, worn-down blazer, gray in his beard. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days.

“Are you the one asking questions?” he said.

I nodded.

He didn’t introduce himself. Just stared at me for a second, then said:

“Stop. Don’t look for it. Don’t *talk* about it. That’s how it finds you.”

I asked him what he meant, and he just shook his head.

“It’s old. Older than this building. Older than the city. You think it lives here, but it doesn’t. It just… follows the echo.”

Before I could ask more, he turned and walked away — fast. I haven’t seen him since. I don’t even know what office he worked in. There’s no name on his door.

But here’s the thing.

That same night, I stayed just ten minutes late. Just ten. Long enough to double-check a bug in some microcontroller code. I didn’t even think about it. I was deep in work, earbuds in, lights on.

Then I looked up — and saw the hallway lights *were off*.

Every single one.

My office was the only one still lit.

I stood up. Took out my earbuds.

Nothing.

Then something scraped against the outside of my door. Low. Like nails or claws. A slow, *dragging* sound.

Then a knock.

Three, deliberate taps.

I held my breath.

Then — silence.

I crept to the door, heart beating so hard I thought it would break my ribs. I didn’t open it, obviously. But I leaned close, just to listen.

And something — *right on the other side* — whispered:

“I know your name now.”

The voice was my own.

Not similar.

**Mine.**

I didn’t sleep that night.

Didn’t sleep the next one either.

And every time I walk into that hallway now — even during the day — I feel like something’s *watching*. Like something’s hiding in the geometry of the building. In the repetition of the walls. In the spaces between the motion sensors.

I think the man was right.

Talking about it *calls* it. Asking questions *feeds* it.

And now… it knows me.

If you’ve ever worked alone, late at night, and felt like you weren’t really alone — like something was *mirroring you*, just a step behind — I want to hear your story.

Maybe together we can figure out what it is.

Before it finds someone else’s name.
