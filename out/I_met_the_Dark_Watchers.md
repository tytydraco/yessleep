I’ve been sitting on this one for a little while, but I think it’s time.

This happened about three years ago. I was, without a doubt, the worst kind of hiker. You know those guys who are all “leave no sign”, bagging their garbage, burying their poop, cleaning up their campsite, respecting nature's natural beauty, and all that? Ya, that wasn’t me. I like camping, my parents like camping, but there was always a mentality of “the woods will take care of things.” I watched my dad leave a whole cooler full of empty beer cans at the site one time when I was eight. We brought a couch with us on a camping trip once just cause Dad knew there was a ravine nearby. Broken fishing rods? Left by the creek. Garbage? Right on the ground. Hell, we left a whole tent once cause Dad couldn’t get it back in the bag. We didn’t use campgrounds either. Dad and Mom would pack up and find somewhere in the middle of nowhere and just live off the land for a couple of days, and then leave their crap behind.

I can’t say that this is why I am the way I am. I know better than to litter and be a pig, but, in my head, the woods will always just take care of themselves. It’s been here for millions of years, why is my trash and stuff gonna mess with that? If my styrofoam cooler kills a couple of trees then they didn’t deserve to be there, right?

That was what I thought, at least.

I go camping about three times a year; the start of spring, the start of summer, and the end of summer. I live in California, so I always just pack up my pickup, get some food and beer and “recreational greenery”, and head out to somewhere remote. A buddy of mine from work hadn’t shut up about this overlook about an hour from the city, right outside the Santa Lucia Mountain range, and I figured I’d go crash out there for a weekend. Unlike my parents, I am not a “living off the land” kind of person. I brought food, I brought stuff, and I intended to do nothing but sit in the wilderness, sleep in my hammock, and get high.

I called out Friday and found the perfect spot by lunchtime. It was gorgeous, overlooking the valley and so remote that if I were to get really hurt I’d prolly die out here with no one the wiser. I set up my hammock, set out my fire logs, got some water (just in case) and just kinda spread out a bit. I made some lunch, sandwiches, rolled a joint, and just kinda got mellow for a bit as the day rolled on. It was nice out here, just watching the clouds and listening to nature. I was soon pretty well-lit and as the sun started creeping down I set about lighting my fire. There was probably a burn ban in effect but I had water and I didn’t care. Out here, no one was going to see me anyway, and I started roasting hotdogs as the sun cut a fantastic line across the sky.

That was the first time I noticed them.

I remember looking up and whispering shit as I mistook them for Rangers or Cops or something. They were just silhouettes on the ridge not far from my camp, three or four of them, and they had these wide, flat-topped hats like park rangers or the guy on the oatmeal box. I watched them for a minute, thinking I was busted, but they just stood there. They didn’t move, they didn’t call out, but I know they saw me. My fire had to be visible for a ways at this height, and the longer they stayed there, the more creeped out I felt. Why were they just standing there? If they wanted me to leave, then why not tell me to leave?

I didn’t know, but once the sun set, I noticed they had vanished and just kinda kept an eye peeled. I had my gun, a big ole .45, so I wasn’t worried, but I suddenly wished I had a tent to sleep in instead of just a hammock. I sparked up again after eating a pack of dogs, though, and that took care of any thoughts of shadow guys or whatever. 

I dozed off in my hammock but I dreamed about them that night too. 

I dreamed that they were in my campsite, just standing around and watching me. They were like the outlines of people, like when someone stands in front of the sun and all you get is a burnt-out image of them. They didn’t have any features, no eyes or anything, and I was frozen there as they looked at me. They didn’t say anything, they just watched me, and it felt like being sleep-paralyzed the whole night.

I woke up after dawn, almost fell out of my hammock, and started making breakfast as I stirred up the ashes of last night's fire. I wondered if it had really been a dream or not, but I felt like it must have been. Why would they come and look but not say anything? All my stuff was there, too, down to the hot dog wrapper I'd left on the ground next to the fire, and I tossed it in absentmindedly as I ate my eggs and ham. The ice was still holding out, it was spring and not too hot yet, so I decided to go on a forest pub crawl today.

Translation: I put a bunch of beer into my backpack and walked out into the woods so I could have a drunk hike.

I spent about five hours hiking in the woods, tossing my dead soldiers into the trees as I finished them. Some of them broke, most of them didn’t, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was following me as I hiked in the woods. I never saw anything, it wasn’t like I spotted someone hiding behind a tree, but it was, like, deep pockets of shadow that shouldn’t have been there. It was midday, the sun was high, and I should have had major visibility. Even so, I found myself looking around as the crawling feeling just got worse and worse. Some of it was being drunk in the hot woods with no water, and when I found a stream I plunged my face in to get a little clarity. I drank a little, Dad always said running water was fine to drink from, and when something snapped not far from me, I looked up like a zebra at a watering hole.

I looked around, trying to find what was stalking me.

There was nothing, just the quiet forest, and the gently rushing stream. 

No, no, I didn't believe that. I had felt stalked all day, and as I watched the trees I felt sure that something moved out there. I got up and started running, the zebra analogy too hard to break, and I kept waiting for the claws to sink in, the teeth to bite, and the hot breath to fall on my neck. It was going to come at any minute, I could feel it, and when I tripped over a fallen log I just lay there and waited for the end. It would get me now. It would get me and I'd be dead, I'd be dead, I'd be...

Nothing happened.

I lay there for nearly ten minutes, just knowing it would get me when I moved, but it never came.

When the ants started to bite my legs I sat up and swiped at them. I had fallen next to an ant bed that I had accidentally stomped on in my haste and they were mad as hell about it. I ended up going back to the creek to wash them off, a haphazard trip that took another ten minutes, and I was still looking around like a scared animal. I sat with my legs in the creek until they stopped throbbing and then made my miserable way back to camp. It was not as much fun walking back as it had been walking out, and I was jittery and tense the whole way. The sun was starting to slip down and I absolutely didn't want to be out here when it got dark. 

Too many things could be crunching around out here in the dark.

I made it back to camp before it got dark, and as I cooked my dinner the sun started to ride low again. It was more hotdogs tonight, cooked over the fire, but I couldn't finish all of them. I was too scared to look away from the ridge and I ended up burning more than one of them. They tasted fine either way, but I had eyes only for the shadows on the ridge.

They had the same wide-brimmed hats, a few of them had canes, but none of them were really people. They were like shadows, the burned images at Hiroshima, the photo negatives that sometimes get burned into old photographs, all of them at once, and none of them at all. They just stood there, watching me. They didn't move, they didn't stir, and as the sun sank I became colder and colder. I should have gone to my truck and left, but I didn't. I made myself put it out of my mind, I convinced myself that I was being foolish. 

When it got dark I got in my hammock and tried to get comfortable, but it wouldn't come. My leg hurt, I was sunburnt, I was hungover, I was dehydrated, I was, I was, I was, I was, but ultimately I was afraid. I was afraid that when I closed my eyes they would get me. I was afraid they would just carry me off in the night and I would never be seen again. They would find my truck and my campsite, but never me.

Maybe, I thought as I finally nodded off, someone would look up one afternoon at sunset and see me on that ridge, just watching.

I must have fallen asleep, and I like to think I dreamed what came next.

I want to, but I can't convince myself that I did.

I "woke up" and saw them standing around me. I could see them, and not just the ones in front of the fire. They were darker than the night somehow, and they began to creep closer to me. Crept is the wrong word, though. They slid along the ground like the ghosts in some of the horror movies I'd watched as a kid. They hemmed me in, my body shaking but my voice stuck in my throat. I didn't dare move, I didn't dare speak, and as they knelt around me, I heard whispering. It was a terrible sound, and it follows me into sleep sometimes.

"You come here to the womb of creation and leave your waste."

"You are a brainless creature fit only to destroy things made by your betters."

"You burn the wood of a creature who has existed before you were more than a twinkling in your father's eye, you destroy a place that was new when this planet cooled, you throw your trash into a home shared by a hundred billion organisms, and you claim to be the superior here, the better. You are nothing, and you will die and be forgotten."

On and on and on. They whispered endlessly to me, telling me how worthless I was, how I was a nuisance and a nothing, and how I would never change. Then, one of them rose up over my hammock, his body seeming to hang over me like a shadow cast from above. He looked like them, but he was clearly their boss or something, and when he brought the cane down on nothing but air, I heard it crack like a thunderbolt.

"Go back to your stinking pit, but be warned. The next time you come to our woods and ruin our place, you will not be allowed to scamper off so easily. You are a stunted thing who was taught badly, but ignorance is forgivable. If you persist in this folly, however, we will not be so kind again. Now GO!" it yelled, and I opened my eyes to find that it was morning.

I was laying in my hammock, piss dribbling down my leg, and I knew that I better not be here when the sun set again.  

I cleaned up everything. I picked up all my garbage, I cleaned up the site, I poured water over the fire, and mixed it with dirt like they always say to on TV, and then I took everything with me and ran for the truck. 

That was Sunday, and I've been kind of afraid to leave my apartment. What if they are waiting out there for me? What if they find me slipping or don't like that I don't recycle or something like that? What if I offend them and they drag me back to the woods to be punished?

That's part of why I'm writing this. If you're like me, someone who doesn't care about their mess or just leaves the woods wrecked, then watch out. Don't let the Dark Watchers catch you messing up their forest because they do more than just watch. Don't let them see you slipping, or you might find out what sort of punishment awaits those who anger them.
