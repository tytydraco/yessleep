I didn’t want to move into that building. I really didn’t. But my situation was desperate, and at the time, I couldn’t afford to be picky. I had just been evicted from a place I had spent far too long in, with roommates who fought constantly, stealing my space, my peace. I needed somewhere cheap, somewhere quiet, somewhere where I could just be alone. And then I found it: this old, crumbling building with an even older landlord who seemed desperate to rent out his apartment.

Mr. Templeton was an odd one. Tall, thin, with gaunt features and eyes that always seemed to dart around like he was trying to avoid looking directly at you. I remember he looked at me strangely when he handed me the keys, his hand shaking just slightly as he placed them in my palm. There was something in his eyes that I couldn’t quite place, something guarded, like he was keeping a secret. But at the time, I was too desperate for a place to stay to care.

“This place…” he began in a soft, gravelly voice, glancing back at the building like he was making sure no one was listening. “It’s… old. It has its quirks. Just keep to yourself. Don’t ask about the other tenants. And most importantly, don’t go next door. Not after dark. You understand?”

I nodded, but I didn’t understand. He seemed to be warning me, but about what, exactly?

The apartment was as dreary as the building. The moment I stepped inside, a damp, musty smell hit me. The floors creaked under my feet, and the wallpaper peeled away in places, revealing old stains that were hard to ignore. But it wasn’t the apartment that made me feel unsettled. It was the silence.

The kind of silence that felt suffocating. The kind that makes you feel like you’re being watched, like the air around you is waiting for something to happen. But I ignored it. I had no choice. I told myself I could handle it.

The first few days passed uneventfully. Too uneventfully, in fact. The building had a stillness about it that made me uncomfortable. When I tried to strike up a conversation with a few of the other tenants in the hallways, they either ignored me or gave me brief, nervous glances before quickly walking away. Everyone seemed to keep to themselves. And there was something about their eyes—vacant, distant—that unsettled me.

But then, the tapping started.

At first, I thought it was just the building settling. Old houses make noise, right? But it was different. It was too rhythmic. Too deliberate. Tap-tap-tap. Tap-tap-tap. I heard it coming from the wall beside my bed, faint at first, but growing louder as the night went on. I tried to ignore it. It had to be something mundane—plumbing, maybe? A pipe leaking? But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t stop hearing it. The tapping never stopped.

I got out of bed, my heart pounding. I moved to the wall and pressed my ear against it. The sound was so close, so distinct. Tap-tap-tap. It was coming from next door.

I backed away slowly, the tapping echoing in my ears, gnawing at my sanity. I wasn’t sure what to do. Was it someone on the other side of the wall? Moving furniture? Knocking on the door? But no—this was no ordinary knocking. There was something methodical about it, something almost... suspicious. I went to the door of the apartment next to mine, hesitant, but my curiosity drove me forward. I knocked. Nothing. I knocked again. No answer.

I was about to leave when I noticed something strange. The door was slightly ajar. Just enough that I could slip inside unnoticed.

For a moment, I hesitated. But then the tapping grew louder—closer. Almost frantic. I pushed the door open, stepping into the dark apartment.

I froze.

The room was pitch black, save for a single shaft of moonlight shining through a crack in the curtains. But there was something else—something that made my skin crawl. The air inside was thick, heavy, like it had been closed off for years. The stale scent of dust and decay assaulted my senses. I stepped further in, my heart hammering, the hair on the back of my neck standing up.

Everything was gone. The apartment was completely bare. No furniture. No personal items. Just cold, empty walls and a floor that looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in decades. It was as if no one had lived there for years—or maybe... it was as if someone had left in a hurry.

I moved cautiously, every step echoing in the silence. The longer I stood there, the more oppressive the atmosphere became. The room felt like it was closing in around me, and every part of my body screamed for me to leave. But I couldn’t. Something was drawing me deeper into the apartment.

And then I saw it.

A photograph, lying on the floor. A picture of a man standing in front of the building. He was smiling, but there was something wrong about it. His smile was too wide, too forced. His eyes... they were too large. They seemed to follow me, no matter where I moved.

My stomach turned as I picked up the photo, trembling in my hands. Who was this man? Why was his photo just lying there, discarded? I placed it back on the floor quickly, like I had just touched something foul.

But then I noticed something else. A single word had been scratched into the wooden floorboards beneath the photo: Stay.

A cold shiver ran down my spine. I turned to leave, but the door slammed shut behind me, as if something was locking me in. Panic surged through me as I backed away from the door, trying desperately to pull it open, but it was stuck. I was trapped.

The whispers began then. Low, unintelligible whispers that seemed to come from every direction, circling around me.

“Stay…”

“It’s your turn now…”

I screamed and backed away, my heart pounding, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The whispers grew louder, more insistent.

I shoved at the door with everything I had, but nothing happened. The air was thick with dread, and my chest felt heavy as I struggled for breath. The whispers didn’t stop. They only grew more frantic.

“Stay… Come closer… You’re next…”

Then, the tapping started again, this time from the far corner of the apartment, slow and deliberate. Tap-tap-tap. Tap-tap-tap. But this time, it was accompanied by a shadow. A figure in the corner. A man, standing motionless, watching me.

It was the same man from the photograph.

He smiled at me. That same wide, forced smile that sent a shudder through my bones. I backed away, the fear surging through me. My body was on autopilot now, fighting to get away, to escape this nightmare. But every time I moved, the man moved with me, his presence growing closer. Tap-tap-tap. Closer. Tap-tap-tap.

I turned to face the door again. Desperation clawed at my insides. I had to get out. I had to escape. But the door… it wouldn’t budge.

I turned back to the man.

“Who are you?” I screamed, my voice trembling.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he pointed toward the photograph I had found earlier. He was still smiling.

“Stay…” His voice was faint but chilling. “It’s your turn now…”

I fell to my knees, tears streaming down my face. I was choking on the realization. The truth was too much to bear.

The tapping, the whispers, the man—it wasn’t some supernatural force or ghost. It was a cycle. A curse. The man in the photograph had once been like me—a new tenant, unaware of the building’s dark secret. He had been replaced. And now it was my turn.

I was the new tenant.

I stumbled back, shaking. The man’s smile widened impossibly, his eyes glowing with a hollow, empty light.

“Stay…”

I realized then. The tenants didn’t die. They were trapped. The building kept them. It didn’t let anyone leave. When the new tenant arrived, they replaced the last one, and that person became part of the building. It was a cycle that never ended.

I was already gone. I just didn’t know it yet.

And as the man in the corner stepped forward, his smile never fading, I felt the walls close in around me. I was swallowed by the building, my own body becoming another shadow in its dark history.

There was no escape. There was only the next one to replace me.
