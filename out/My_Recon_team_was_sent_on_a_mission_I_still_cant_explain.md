When you do any sort of dirty work for any government, it becomes natural that you become numb to most things others would find disturbing. Be it killing enemies of the state or raiding local cults or terrorist cells, you naturally start developing thicker skin to cope with the horrible things the government asks you to clean up for it. If not, you are to be replaced and accounted for. Think of yourself as a cog in its machine. Nothing but replaceable scrap. What me and my team found was something no one should ever witness, but we need people to know. 

 My name is Jackson Matting, and I am a Sergeant on the American Security and Recon team “Dying Star,” and I’m currently on a non traceable laptop in a non disclosable location, currently writing out this story as to let as many people I can speak to know the things I encountered with my team. The American government is currently attempting to cover up what we discovered that day, which involved the death of two of my teammates. I believe we encountered the most dangerous bioweapon known to humanity, and the American government is trying to cover it up. I still don’t fully grasp the picture, but it doesn’t matter. 

 People deserve to know. 

 It was a cold day in May when me and my team were contacted by government officials. Apparently, in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of California, the FBI got anomalous leads to an oil rig about how a company, BioTech, was stationed there and developing something potentially harmful to animal life. Soon, my team, codenamed “Dying Stars,” was sent to deal with it. 

 Although there were hints of the danger being biological, our team was sent in, which I found odd. If there were biological dangers, shouldn’t the CDC be dealing with it? As I thought over this, I shifted in my seat, my shoulders rubbing against my teammates shoulder.

 “Testing radio equipment.” - I listened to our commander, Alex, speak into his radio in a loud enough voice over the spinning blades of the helicopter for something to pick up. Sure enough, all of our radios crackled to life, catching the Lieutenants check. 

 “Seems to be functional.” - I heard Ramirez chime in as he hoisted his rifle into his lap, his legs hanging outside of the helicopter.

I guess I should introduce my teammates, as all of them we’re with me at the start, and it’ll help keep I’ll start with the leader of our unit, Alex.

Alex is a gruff, older man, with greying hair and sagging eyes. He’d been with this team at the start, being the former second-in-command alongside me and Lt. Jacques. When Jacques died during one of our missions, he was promoted to Lieutenant and given control over our unit. Alex is nearing around his 40’s, but he acts like one of those stereotypical 60’s guys, complaining about technology and the new generation. Made sense, since he originally fought in the War against Terror before eventually becoming Navy SEALs. His above average skills managed to land him here in this job, where he continues to fight against those who would wish to tear down America.

Following him is Cpl. Ramirez. He was around his mid 20s, had blonde hair, blue eyes, and a chipped tooth that loved to show itself whenever he had that big grin of his. Ramirez, although we’d say was a general asshat and prankster, was most likely our glue. Whenever things felt like they went wrong pr we had a bad day, he always attempted to cheer us up. It usually worked, because, as much as Alex would deny it, the man had charisma. His reasoning for joining was because his Mom died in a terrorist attack and ever since he’s been wanting to get at the people who killed her along with every other innocent soul taken. His talent is his above average intelligence, which allowed him to basically crack open anything if given enough time and resources, which proved vital in our missions.

Next was Cpl. Hoffman. He was a middle aged man with black hair, green eyes, and a permanent scar across his right cheek, which he said came from when he was attacked by a dog in his youth. I don’t know much about the man, other than he’s somewhat quiet and standoffish. What I did know was that he liked Solitaire and had a boyfriend. When I asked him about it, he showed me a picture of his boyfriend and him relaxing in the smoky mountains of Tennessee. It’s one of the few times I’ve seen the man smile. Ramirez often joked about his sexuality, but they weren’t ill willed and more or less something he poked some fun at, which Hoffman allowed. He was a distant man, but he could understand emotions. Hoffman’s skill was his ability to handle most explosives with ease, which he out to good use several times. Why he joined is still something I don’t know.

Following him was the only female of our group, Sam. She had turned 22 a few days prior to the mission, had black wavy hair, and silky smooth mixed skin. She was the most recent member and joined the year prior. She simply joined as to feel she was doing something for the greater good, along with the great pay it provided. I quickly became close friends with her, realizing our similar interests in a variety of subjects, such as sci-fi media. She was simply a good shot and often acted as our sniper.

And then there was me. I’m 23 years old, both as I’m writing this and when the mission happened back in March. I grew up in Indiana most of my life and was used to the simple urban lifestyle. My reason for joining was simply for the pay, as otherwise, I would’ve taken another job. I’ve come to appreciate my job. Or, at least, I did until this mission. My job was to make sure everything mechanical was working, in case one of our flashlights broke or if one of the radio’s were busted.

Now, back to the mission at hand. We were briefed slightly on the situation, but for the most part, we were just as in the dark as the FBI in what was truly going on at the time, especially because everything was radio silence. Ergo, we were sent it to see what was happening and to eliminate any potential problems.

As the five of us waited to arrive at the oil rig, the co-pilot suddenly spoke out to us. 

“We’re currently experiencing radio silence on the other end, and we aren’t sure what is currently happening on the rig. What we do know is there’s a threat on board.”

“What kind of threat?” - Alex blurted out, his rifle sitting upright in his arms as he checked the magazine.

“We believe it to be biological in nature, hence why you were provided with military gas masks.”

“If that’s the case, why isn’t the CDC looking into this?” - I spoke out, wanting the answer to the question as it nagged at me. Unfortunately, the co-pilot shrugged in response.

“Not sure. Whatever the case is, they’re sending you all in to eradicate any threat and to reestablish   radio contact.”

“Yeah, they want to make sure they can radio over the lottery numbers.” - Ramirez chuckled to himself, shaking his head.

Alex clearly wasn’t amused about the joke and grunted at Ramirez. - “Corporal, take this seriously, we aren’t sure what could be waiting us on that rig.” - Ramirez gave back an annoyed expression and sighed, looking out at the sea.

“Hooah, Lieutenant.”

After about 10 more minutes, the rig was now in sight. Seeing one in person is definitely off putting, as it’s a crazy thought that it’s possible to even build these in the ocean, let alone to siphon out oil. When we closer to the rig to search for a landing spot, it became clear that there was no activity on the top deck at all. 

“No activity on the deck, however there appears to be several signs of struggle.” - Alex muttered through his gas mask, observing the deck. He always had a knack for scanning his surroundings thoroughly.

After a few seconds of searching, we found a landing pad in the northeastern corner of the rig. As we land, Ramirez hopped off the helicopter, scanning the landing pad and area around us before turning his head back slightly.

“Landing area clear.”

One by one each of us jumped off the helicopter, making sure our rifles were topper off as we prepare to commence with the operation. As we prepared ourselves, Alex waved off the helicopter. As the helicopter lifted off and began to fly off, our radio’s crackled to life with the co-pilots voice

“Dying Star, we are on our way back to base to refuel. You are free to commence with the mission as planned. Secure any civilians and neutralize any potential threats.”

Alex leaned into his radio. - “Copy that, Black Cat. We’ll commence a sweep on the top deck before exploring the rest of the rig.”

“Copy that, Dying Star. Good luck.” - And with that, the radio crackled and went silence. Now alone, Alex turned off the safety on his rifle.

“Alright, we’re gonna commence a full sweep of the top deck first before moving down to the inner parts of the structure. Matt, take Hoffman and Sam and explore the rest of this deck. Ramirez, with me, we’ll be checking the Control Deck to see if there’s any critical damage.”

With Alex’s orders, our two groups begin to search the entire top deck. As Hoffman, Sam, and I walked throughout the deck, we didn’t find a single body, nor any clothing, but we saw chairs and tables flipped, crates and equipment destroyed, and multiple pools and streaks of blood and what appeared to be some type of green fungus or mold in the occasional patches here and there.

“Damn, what happened here?” -Sam broke the silence, kneeling down as she inspected that strange fungus.

“That’s our job to find out.” -Hoffman spoke as he then spoke into his radio. “Alex, do you copy? We’re seeing signs of struggle, blood, and what appears to be some type of moss or fungus strewn about. Anything on your end?”

After a few moments of silence, the radio managed to crackle to life. - “We copy you, Hoffman. We have seen broken equipment and traces of blood, can you confirm?”

I then chimed in through my radio. - “Yeah, we’re seeing what you see. Any bodies, though?”

“No, no signs of any bodies anywhere. We’re just reaching the-“ - Suddenly, the radio cut off. We all looked at each other, confused. I assumed the radio simply didn’t catch what he said and responded. - “Alex? Ramirez? You two copy?”
 
After a few seconds, the radio crackled to life. - “If you three can hear me, get up to the Control Deck right now. We got a dead body, but it’s not from any normal wounds. Christ… just get up here.”

Now that was something none of us were expecting. The body part didn’t really worry us, that was one of the things we were expecting. It was Alex’s tone that made us anxious. He sounded… shocked. Anxious, even. Alex wasn’t a soft man. Hell, he barely even showed any weakness. Whatever this was, he was clearly nervous about it, which in turn made us nervous. We finished sweeping the top deck, not finding much before heading up to the control deck. The whole rig shook and turn from the waves crashing below, it’s rusted legs groaning beneath us. I have to be honest, I thought the thing was going to give way any second.

After a small trek up some stairs, we managed to find the Control Deck. Looking inside, we saw Ramirez standing over the controls and Alex kneeling next to the corpse he mentioned. It didn’t take long until we knew why he seemed so anxious.

The corpse had that ugly bright orange construction suit on, which was stained in blood and that strange fungus. But the worst part was half of the left part of his head was coated in that green organism, which was visibly moving down his arm on the jumpsuit. Upon seeing us, Alex looked up, and we could see under his gas mask his face was completely pale.

“Just what the hell is going on here?”
