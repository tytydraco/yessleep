I immediately pulled out the gun and pointed it at her. Blair looked at her, then at me. 

“*Wow, that’s a nice gun*,” she said. And immediately she started clawing for it with no real regard for her own safety. I put up a fight before remembering that my ‘paper tiger’ version of a pistol probably wasn’t worth dying for. She tore it from my hands, laughing as red droplets flicked from her mouth. 

Then she just held it and looked at us. And I knew the second the *click* came through, we’d have to run, *not* crawl.

But instead, after giving us a look of contemplation, she just backed away, continuing to giggle. “Hey, *hey all of you fuckheads,*” she shouted, garnering attention, desperately looking behind her to make sure no one was closing in. “Fuck *all of your dumb alliances*.” And I watched the bottom half of her step out of frame and closer to the center of the chaos. “*Matt*,” *she said.* “Remember when you forgot to cc me on the Tradewinds report and made me look like a fucking moron for not knowing about it? Maybe I should blow your brains out for that, hey?” And then her body pivoted. “Or *Terry.* Where the fuck’s Terry? I heard what you said about me—that I *derail meetings?* Fuck you I do! My shit *ends on time.*”

Blair and I went for it—a mad dash this time.

“Go, go,” I said, as we sprinted around tables, bodies, and violent strangers to close the last few meters between us and the hallway. I heard multiple “Hey’s!” coming from distant corners and from folks crawling out from cover. I prayed Blair still had her half of a scissor blade if needed, but as we stepped out of the open office, it was clear that the department fights, megaphones, and now—Lindsey’s hollow gun—served as enough of a powder keg to make our small fireworks presentation seem lame in comparison. 

I turned to look—no one was after us.

We bolted down the hallway. The distant door to the stairwell was wide open.

“Please, please for the *love of God,*” Blair said as we made it and stepped through the propped-open passage and descended into the stairwell. I looked up. I looked down. No life—only the remnants of blood and chaos. *Empty.* We thundered down the taps. 

“What happens if the tallies aren’t gone when we step outside?” she asked me.

“Then we’ll figure something out, because at that point there’d be no other choice, but *right now*, much as I hate the word, let’s hope. Let’s *fucking hope.*” 

Our boots slammed the last few steps before we hit the second floor. I awaited jumpscares but was met with nothing. We continued on desperately towards ground level. 

“I just want a shower, and fucking ice cream, and—oh—yeah, I’m gonna *finally* see my therapist,” Blair said, and I almost laughed.

And then we reached the bottom. The back exit to the outside world. I held the handle. I turned and pushed.

*Nothing.* Locked.

“No. No, *fucking please—-*” I started, frantically trying to twist the handle.

“It’s locked,” I heard a voice say. We both turned—-a man with a stab wound in his stomach **crawled** from his hiding space underneath the stairs. “I already tried it.”

I took the lead as we moved towards him cautiously. He held a light smile on his face. “It’s funny. It feels like *mortally injured people* are probably the new currency in our fucked up workplace economy.”

“We’re not gonna hurt you,” Blair said. He reacted with a face I couldn’t place. “It’s been—*this has been enough as is*. We just wanted to see if there was a way we could get out.”

He shifted a bit. Looked like he was deep in thought. Then, “you guys got two left each on your tallies. And still a bit of time I’d imagine. I’ll let one of you kill me, but on one condition.”

Blair and I immediately turned to each other. “We’re not gonna—” I started.

“Shh,” he said. “I left my phone upstairs. I dropped it. I just want to… call my son. Tell him I love him.”

“We just came from the third floor,” I said. “*It’s gonna be a shitshow.*”

“What’s his number? I can call him,” from Blair.

“I don’t… I can’t remember his number.”

Blair pulled me aside, whispered. “*What the fuck do we do? Just leave him?*”

It was no ‘trolley problem’, but it still the strangest moral quandary I’d ever been faced with. Was this… *ethical murder,* if we fulfilled his last wishes first?

“But maybe it’s a good thing,” Blair continued, low. “I don’t think we have enough time to… y’know… *beat this whole tally thing*.” She looked down at her marking. “The megaphone psycho dude asked—*what kind of people do we want to die as,* right? Or something like that?” 

And it was partially the mania and the adrenaline, but I was endeared to the idea.

“I’ll sign my life to you both,” he said, “if you do this favor—”

“It’s on the house,” I said. And strange as it was, we hoisted the stranger between us—and started the slow ascent. *Step after step.* It had been a weird life.

“Never thought two girls from marketing would ever give me the time of day,” he said. It was a weird note—I guess he knew us, despite him being a complete stranger to me at least. I looked at his arm. 

*Step. Step.*

# I

He didn’t *seem* like a fighter, so maybe the guy must’ve had the best and worst simultaneous luck in this whole game. Born on fourth base with the ‘I,’ *shanked* immediately.

*More steps.* We’d arrived back at the second floor, en route to the third. The word ‘seem’ lingered in my mind—after today’s learnings, did anyone actually *act* how they *seemed?*

“Where did you leave your phone?” Blair asked.

He groaned in pain as we continued the grinding climb. “It… must’ve been in the bathroom,” he said. “On the third floor. So… we’re almost there.” 

And our footfalls echoed on, but I could feel something tense in Blair, much as it did it in me. And I snuck a hand, ever so carefully, on *instinct* rather than intention, into his jeans pocket, tracing what I’d first thought was the sound of pocket change clinking. I carefully pulled out what was, without a shadow of a doubt, a *shell casing.* A bullet. 

*Step. Step.*

“Was it gonna be today?” I asked him, brazen. I noticed Blair quietly reach for something.

“Today that wha—”

“Blair, do it!” I screamed, but before she could strike with her scissors, he *kicked* her leg back and she fell, toppling down four or five stairs, slamming her head *hard* against one of them, the office weapon tumbling down further.

“No!” I screamed, and immediately he went for me next, overpowering me with a quick, desperate burst of strength and flipping me onto my back. Before he could catch me with a swing, *I stuck my fingers deep into his wound.* He screamed in response. I placed my free hand on his neck and with whatever strength I had left tried to choke him.

“It’s funny… you’re seeing me as the bad guy now,” he said, struggling, between pained gasps, “*when everyone with a fucking pulse is tearing each other apart today—*”

“*Being miserable doesn’t give you the right to make it the world’s problem.* Don’t compare everyone’s shittiness in the face of something *incomprehensible* to you being willing to kill people on a *sunny fucking day—*”

He rocked me with a punch, my head bouncing against the step. I involuntarily detached, almost forgetting where I was. And then the words just came out of me. “You’re gonna—fucking—die here,” I said.

“*So are you,*” and his smarmy tone suddenly gave me a second wind and this time I secured both of my hands around his neck. It didn’t stop him. He swung again, and again, but I held on, trying to squeeze air out of his windpipe. 

I heard the rush of footsteps coming up the stairs. Blair, having come to, swung at the back of his head a few times. It didn’t stop him. In a frantic blitz, she reached to dig her nails into his face—his eyes. He groaned. “Help me… choke him…” I said. She tried to join me in grabbing his neck, but he shifted to the side, catching both of us with flailing jabs and elbows. 

She switched strategy, desperately jamming her hand into his mouth, pinching his nose closed with her other, while I continued to try to force the oxygen out of him. “Just fucking die!” she screamed. He thrashed violently, bit down—Blair screamed—but she held on and the messiness of a *long, weak* strangulation played out in front of us. No instruments to help the murder, just brute force with what we’d been born with, and soon—his eyes fixed and the fight drained out of him. 

And then, he really *was* dead. We both let go and lifted ourselves up evenly on the stairs. I looked at the torn-up, destroyed mess of Blair’s hand. And her tally. And my tally. They were both the same.

# I

“Hey,” I said, “I guess whatever this is, it *counts* teamwork. That’s a silver lining I gu—”

“*I can’t fucking do this anymore!*” she screamed. 

“Fair, totally *fair—”* and then immediately my head shot up as I heard people rushing down the stairs from above. “We need to fucking *go*,” I said, accidentally grabbing her busted-up hand by mistake, causing her to wince, and then gripping her arm instead. We stormed back down the steps and pushed through the door to the second floor. We charged past occupied rooms, barricaded hallways, and bodies galore as I tried to spot somewhere—anywhere—we could catch respite. The small kitchen in the corner that showed up in my line of sight seemed like the best bet.

We hurried to it as an injured, feral-seeming survivor heard us from a distance and gave chase. We slipped in, I smashed the door behind us, then locked it. The stranger banged at the door for a beat before giving up.

Blair looked around for a second, then sat back against the refrigerator and slowly slid herself to the ground. A long exhale. “*How much time do we have left?*” she asked. 

I walked up to the microwave on the counter. *5:13 PM.* Three minutes until we’d supposedly die.

Beside the microwave: a knife block that had been nearly completely raided. There was a single blade left lodged in one of the wooden slots.

Both Blair and I were down to one tally. There was no time left.

I grabbed the knife.   

I walked back over to her. Crouched down to her level. It took her a second to look at me. Confusion in her expression once she realized what I was holding. 

Slowly, I placed the handle of the blade into her mangled hand.

I sat down beside her. I closed my eyes.

After a few seconds—“what are you doing?” she asked.

“Time’s almost up. You have one left on your tally. Let’s not waste the horror.”

“*So do you.*” Then—“I’m not going to kill you.”

“You *actually* have something to live for. You have *friends* and a *life* and a *boyfriend who loves you* and you seem to, give a shit to like—*actually* live your—”

“*So do you!*”

“I am an empty person. I feel, like, *nothing,* most of the time. Otherwise, it’s like, *slight comfort* or anxiety or stress, I am—*I, this”* I motioned to myself, “Doesn’t need to continue.” I thought back to the one unnecessary kill I made. “But maybe it can end on like, an *okay* note. Maybe *I* can end… on an okay note.”

“You are *fucked,*” she said.

I laughed. “No kidding.” Then—“I hope it’s like, easy. The way we die. Like, *not brutal,* just like… the way the Avengers go out, y’know? Like, I start fading away and turning into leaves or whatever, and it’s like—and then I go like—Mr. Stark, I don’t feel so good.” I started snickering. She looked at me like I was fucking gone. “*I’m melting, Mr. Stark,*” I snickered again.

“How the fuck were *you* playing the straight man in our friendship?”

“Mr. Stark, stick a fork in me—I’m cooked.”

“Do you really want those to be your last words?” she said.

“*Come on*,” I said. “Live a little.”

She smiled. Shook her head. “Fine,” she said, caving. “Mr. Stark… I dunno, clear my search history for me or something. *Please.*”

I laughed. “Je m’appelle Stark, je suis triste.”

“That means, *I am Stark, I am sad.*”

“He *is* sad,” I said. “*Spiderman* just died!” 

And then, from that same PA that came the initial mandate, came a new beeping sound. A countdown, it seemed. For how long it would run for, who knew.

She rested her head on my shoulder.

“We did alright, right?” she asked.

“Yeah, we *tried.*” Then—”You said *our friendship* earlier?”

“Easy *cancer,* let’s not end this on too saccharine a note.”

“*Hey,*” I said. “*Big word, look at you.*”

“Fuck you,” she laughed.

“Fuck you too,” I said, and I closed my eyes, and the *beep beep beep* intensified until—

It stopped.

Silence. Deafening silence.

And that tinny voice returned to the PA system.

**“Thanks. That was great. The test is now complete. You’re free to go.”** 

As I sat with the revelation, a follow-up came a split-second afterwards: **“P.S. If you want great seats for the next phase, feel free to go to the roof.”**

It took us a good while—minutes that felt like hours—to finally slide up from our seats. I was afraid that instant death in the form of an invisible shock collar or something would knock me out, but… nothing.

Blair used her miserable hand to return the knife into the knife block. I unlocked the door.

We limped to the elevators. Called them.

*DING.*

They opened near-immediately. A few dead bodies lined the back. We got in.

I looked at the “ground floor” button and the tenth floor button. She pressed the tenth floor. I looked at her.

“Five minutes ago I thought we were absolutely dead. Fuck it,” she said. The doors closed. The elevator went up.

*DING.* Third floor. Lindsey—project manager, frequent all-hands presenter and gun thief entered. She limped in. Took a spot near the back.

“Sorry,” she said.

“All good,” I said. 

“That gun didn’t have any—”

“Bullets,” I said. 

“Yes,” she said. “Wait. You knew?”

“Yes,” I said.

“Makes sense.”

The doors started closing—until a hand slipped in, stopping them.

They slid open again. Chris, the man with the megaphone entered. “*Ladies*,” he said. They closed again. “We all going up?”

“Yes,” both Blair and I said in unison, to Lindsey’s shock.

“Wait,” she said. “This is going up?”

—

It didn’t take too long to figure out what the man on the PA had meant.

I looked out from the rooftop to the neighboring buildings. For many blocks out, it looked like the lights had been killed dead—pitch black. We kept eyeing until they suddenly came back. With the returned illumination, I spotted something else through all the windows. The people inside were thrown, confused, wondering what’d happened, and then suddenly—in a stark throwback to only an hour ago—looking down at their arms with concern. I could feel the panic from my *distant enough* vantage point.

And I wondered what my—*our*—civic duty was at this moment. Chris, in an extension of his previous attempts to quell group mania, turned on the megaphone again and leaned over the ledge to try—likely to no avail—to get the folks to not panic. “*People!”* he started. *“You don’t need to fulfill the tallies—*”

“Kay,” said Blair off the distorted backdrop, “I already know your birthday and where you were born. But do you know what *time* you were born? Like, exactly.” 

I thought for a second. “Why?”

“Just answer the question. I’m doing your star chart.”

“Hmm.” Funny enough, it was a piece of personal trivia I actually had the answer to. “Time of birth for me was… 2:02 AM. Ish.”

And then she clicked away at her phone, really taking her time with it, wincing with every button press that required the input of an injured digit. And then—

“Oh shit,” she said, fixated on the result, while I watched, like clockwork, the neighbouring buildings fall to greater confusion, greater hiding, escalating violence, and people defaulting to their spots on the ever-so-violent fight, flight, and freeze continuum. “*Capricorn moon*.” She looked at me, *really* looked at me. “I mean, I fucking love that [for you.](https://www.reddit.com/user/WorldAwayTweedy/comments/16r75hk/master_story_list_and_narration_policy/)”
