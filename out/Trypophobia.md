Dr. Nouman: "Hello, Brittney. This is your first counseling session with me. Do you feel comfortable?"

Brittney: "As comfortable as I'll ever be, I guess."

Dr. Nouman: "Our sessions together will be recorded in audio format so they can be used as... er... case studies for future psychiatrists. Is that alright with you?"

Brittney: "Um, fine. Whatever."

Dr. Nouman: "If so I will have to ask you to please state your name for the recording."

Brittney: "Okay. My name is Brittney DeSouza."

Dr. Nouman: "Excellent. What brings you here today, Brittney?"

Brittney: "Ever since the accident I can't stop thinking about him. He shouldn't have died, it's all my fault I..."

Dr. Nouman: "Okay, Brittney, please calm down. Can you explain what accident you are referring to?"

Brittney: "It was a week ago. Me and Ethan went to the old abandoned school for fun. We didn't know the floorboards on the top floor were rotten, and he just... fell. He broke his neck on impact and it's all my fault."

Dr. Nouman: "I understand why you would think that way. Tell me, when you said you suffered from hallucinations, what did you mean?"

Brittney: "I keep seeing holes everywhere. I haven't tried to touch them or anything, but I know, I just know that if I fall down I'll keep falling forever. I just... I want Ethan back."

Dr. Nouman: "Okay, Brittney, I can see that you are very distressed right now. Would you want to stop now and come back next time?"

Brittney: "Yes, I guess. Yes. Yes. That would be better."

Dr. Nouman: "Excellent, I'll prescribe you some olanzapine for your hallucinations, and next week we'll check again on you."

Dr. Nouman: "This is Dr. Nouman, here with patient Brittney DeSouza. Brittney, how are you feeling today?"

Brittney: "Better, I guess. The medicine is helping. I'm seeing lesser holes."

Dr. Nouman: "Good, good. Now, how about you talk more about what happened during the incident?"

(Silence)

Brittney: "Well, me and Ethan were at the abandoned school. We just wanted a thrill, you know? Like all teenagers. Anyways, we went to the too floor and started chasing each other around, seeing who could spook the other the best. I was hiding in a doorway, waiting for him. When I jumped out at him, he staggered back a bit, abd the floor just... gave out. The hole was a perfect circle as well, unlike the hole that appears when you step on rotten floorboards and the fall away. I went to check on him, and he wasn't moving. I called an ambulance, but he was already gone."

Dr. Nouman: "I understand that it must be distressing for you to lose your friend like that."

Brittney: "No, you don't understand. It's my fault. I was the one who made him go with me. He didn't want to, but I pleaded. Oh god, there's one!"

(A chair can be heard scraping againste the floor)

Brittney: "Dr. Nouman get away from the hole! It's right beside you! Can't you see?"

(Sobbing can be heard)

Dr. Nouman: "There's nothing there. Trust me, Brittney. How about you come back next week? We'll end this session here."

(Recording stops)

(Recording starts)

Dr. Nouman: "Hello, Brittney. How are you today?"

Brittney: "They're back."

Dr. Nouman: "Who's back, Brittney? Can you explain?"

Brittney: "Not who. The holes. They show up more often now."

Dr. Nouman: "I see. The medicine isn't helping?"

Brittney: "Medicine can't fix this. Oh god, they're in the office. They're in here."

Dr. Nouman: "Calm down, Brittney."

(A slam can be heard)

Brittney: "How can you expect me to be calm?! Oh god, the holes are gonna keep showing up, aren't they? Until I'm gone."

Dr. Nouman: "Brittney, calm down. Sit back down, and we can talk about this."

Brittney: "No. No. There's nothing to talk about. I have to get out of this offi-"

(Brittney can be heard screaming, and her screams slowly fade. There is silence.)

(Recording stops)

(Recording starts)

Dr. Nouman: "Oh god, I think I'm going crazy. She just vanished into the floor, just like that. I'm losing my mind. This can't be happening. She didn't fall into the ground. Definitely not. I'm doing this to convince myself I'm sane, but what the hell do I know anymore? I-I think I should go get a glass of water."

(Footsteps can be heard. A gasp, and then sobbing.)

Dr. Nouman: "No no no this can't be happening why is there a hole in my kitchen this hole wasn't here before I'm losing my mind someone help please help me. I should go see someone. T-they can help me, right?"
