There is no red more red than freshly spilt blood on freshly fallen snow. 

Just-plucked rose petals on white satin sheets? Overripe strawberries in a saucer of cream? Lust is certainly a deep shade of crimson. Gluttony has its hues of rouge, too. But both pale in comparison to the ruby red glow of fresh death frozen in time.

I'd noticed the first flakes slowly drifting down outside the window of a Denny's about two hours into our drive up north. My best friend and I were headed up for deer season rifle opener, and this lunch stop had become a part of the weekend tradition. Everett was absolutely destroying his Moons Over My Hammy. I nodded out the window and his eyes went wide.

"Gopher twerking!" he exclaimed, mouth full of breakfast sandwich. 

Almost spit out my diner coffee. "What in the actual fuck did you just say!?" I choked, laughing.

He swallowed and took a sip of his OJ with an exasperated sigh and a satisfied pause. 

"Good for tracking."

"Ah. Right. Yeah. Good for freezing your ass off, too." I complained but I was happy to see it coming down already. It would be heavier further north, too. And not just good for tracking, better for spotting game against. Quieter movement, too. A bed of snow is like a layer of soundproofing on the forest floor, dampening all the sounds, sucking in any breath of an echo. And the soft styrofoam squeak of snow crunching under foot is preferable to the sharp snap of a twig or rustle of dry leaves. As much as it has a reputation for violence, hunting is mostly a mastery of silence and stillness. And violence.

Just 20 minutes after pulling back onto the highway, the flurries were getting thicker. By nightfall, we were flying through hyperspace, lines of snow zipping past through the high beams. Everett even put the Star Wars Main Titles theme on Spotify and did his best Wookie cry, giving me a good laugh. That calmed my driving-backroads-through-a-blizzard nerves a bit. That and the joint he sparked helped my knuckles death-gripping the steering wheel regain some of their color. 

In addition to the unnerving road conditions, I was a little antsy driving in unknown territory. In past years Everett's cousins let us hunt on their land, but they unfortunately had to sell. So we rented a VRBO cabin on some state forest land in the same area this year. Not as swanky as the hunting lodge we were used to, but two less idiot redneck cousins to deal with all weekend. We weren't far from the cabin according to the navigation, but something was wrong with the display. 

"Hey, what's up with that?" I pointed at the screen. The color path marking our route showed a right turn ahead, but just after that the map went blank. I pinched the screen to zoom out but the whole section of map to the east was just black, no roads or features displayed.

"Maybe it's loading?" Ev shrugged, "or maybe the Google cars don't do dirt roads."

"Dirt road?"

"Yeah, remember? The guy said the last 10 or so miles are on an old gravel pit access road through the state forest." I slowed as we approached where the navigation path showed our correct turn into oblivion. Glancing between the nav and out the windshield, I searched the edge of the beams for a break in the trees. Suddenly there was something in the road.

I slammed on the breaks. We start fishtailing. Then spinning out. Fuck fuck fuck. 

"FUCK!" I lent my vocal chords to the voice screaming in my head. I looked to Everett who has one hand on the above Oh-Shit handle, the other outstretched, fumbling at his feet for the joint he dropped. For a split second I thought I saw something behind him outside the passenger window. Two floating orbs of light. No. Eyes. But so big and set so far apart they couldn't have possibly been human eyes. Plus, whatever was out there would have to be attached to the car spinning like a top down the road with us. I snapped out of it.

THUNK. The car slid abruptly to a halt in a massive embankment of snow on the roadside. It hadn't been snowing that long or hard, had it? Maybe since we're further north, they've been getting winter weather longer than I'd realized. Luckily I'd already slowed enough to look for our turn that the "crash" had done little more than rattle our gear and our nerves a bit. Then I remembered breathing is a thing. 

"You good?" I gasped. Everett did not need to be reminded to breathe, he was already taking a long drag from the bent joint, slumping into his seat.

"All good," he replied, in that pinched, holding-a-couple-lungfuls-of-weed-smoke-in sorta way. Blowing out a huge cloud of smoke, he coughed, "Why the fuck did you brake?!"

"There was a...I thought I saw...I'm sorry man. My bad." One fist over mouth in the throes of a nasty coughing-and-laughing jag, he gave me a few brotherly slaps on the back and an I-love-you-but-fuck-you shake of the shoulder.

We got out to survey damage, stretch legs, count blessings, etc. Apparently we'd slid to a stop right at our turn, the embankment being a pile of snow plowed from the access drive into the woods. A small metal gate propped halfway open marked the entrance of the forest road. It only took us a few minutes to get dislodged from the snow, but cost a lot of energy and dryness. Damp and dog-tired, we were ready to reach our destination and start a fire, so we got in and headed into the woods. I let Ev drive this time.

Minutes creeped by. It was hard to tell how far we'd traveled, only moving 5-10 Mph. The road seemed like something more meant for recreational all terrain vehicles, real narrow and rugged, branches scraping at the side mirrors. I was distracted and not really paying attention, looking out the window between the trees and in the rearview for any sign of the thing I'd seen in the road, or outside the Ev's window.

If I'm honest, at the time I couldn't say what it was I thought I saw. Each time I tried to conjure the image in my head, I saw something different. An animal of sorts. A deer? Or a person. Yes, a woman. In a white dress, and bright glowing eyes. No. Not eyes. Headlights. Another car coming head on. Fuck. When I tried to focus harder, the visions only got more confused. Strange combinations of these things. A chimera with hoofed feet, cloven legs, but a human female torso and arms, and six exposed breasts like utters. She had antlers, but where a face would be was just a single bright glowing light. Like the face of the guy on the poster for The Thing. But even this bizarrely specific image did not seem to trigger any actual recollection. It was as though I was simply mixing all of the excuses my brain could invent for what could have been in the road together. I couldn't shake this feeling that my brain was filling in details not because it couldn't recall what was in the road...but because it couldn't comprehend what was in the road.

"We should be seeing the cabin soon, eh?" Everett snapped me back to reality. The navigation still showed a blue path traveling forward, surrounded by nothingness. I pinched to zoom out and saw that ahead there was a little circle marking our destination. The map scale looked like we had just over a mile to go. 

"Aha! Nice," Everett said, seeing the display, "To be honest, I was kinda freaking out. Thought we'd missed it for sure, been bumping along this horse trail for like an hour."

"Really? An hour?" I lost time making monsters in my mind.

"At least. And there was this...tree." I expected him to elaborate, but when he didn't I glanced over at him. 

"A tree?" He looked a little embarrassed. Or scared. 

"...Yeah it was weird." Everett hesitated. Unsure. Not like him. "This kinda gnarled sickly looking oak, with scorch marks on it like it got some lightning." I half remembered my attention snagging briefly on a tree like this on the periphery of my ghoulish visions. 

"Huh...and what about the tree?"

"...I think we passed it a few times." Well that wouldn't make any sense.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean I've seen it four times."

"You sure it's the same-"

"It's the same tree," He stammered, a little aggressive. "Sorry, I...It's stupid. I was going to say something before because I thought for sure we were going in circles." 

"How can it be the same tree? This road goes relatively straight, you haven't turned..."

"I know. It doesn't make sense, that's why I didn't say shit. The first time I thought, 'cool tree.' I even said 'cool tree' and tried to point it out to you, but you were staring out your window. Second time I thought, 'wtf, is that the same tree?'. But I didn't remember what the burns looked like, so chalked it up to two burned out gnarly trees. Third time, I saw the burns. This weird Y-shape. Fourth time, I saw the same burns." He was talking rapidly now, getting elevated. I've never seen Everett like this. Excited sure, but always in a positive way. Otherwise he was always calm cool and collected, never anxious like this.

"Okay...okay. How long since you last saw it?" 

"Right before you adjusted the navigation and we saw the cabin ahead. Shouldn't we be there by now?"

I looked back at the screen. It still showed us moving toward the destination dot, but it was hard to tell whether we'd moved any closer, with nothing around it for context. The mileage scale still showed it as just over a mile ahead. What the fuck?

"I don't know man, this thing's fucked. Maybe GPS is off?" I tried to reassure him that we were just normal lost, not liminal-backwoods-glitch-in-the-forest lost. But I wasn't even really convincing myself. 

"Well if you see that tree again let's..." And there it was. "...stop."

We sat staring out the windshield as the car idled, headlights spilling over the tree exactly as Ev had described it. Exactly as I'd seen it, too, each time before. There was something more than familiar about this tree, the Y-shaped pattern of burns up the side. I traced it's lines with my eyes like a fingertip subconsciously traces an old scar. Gently, thoughtfully, like I remember it's pain. As I stared transfixed by this tree, suddenly an image flashed so violently in my mind I had to close my eyes. 

I was back behind the wheel, glancing up from the navigation at the creature in the road. No longer sporting antlers, but gnarled oak branches growing out the sides of her head. A gruesome Y-shaped scar from her shoulders to chest, then bisecting her six teats down to her belly button. And then, it began to open. The seams of the scars slowly splitting at the middle, the flesh peeling back. Blood dripping out, then oozing out, then pouring out in torrential gushes, mixing with the snow at her feet in a most unholy carmine slurry. As the car approached in slow motion, the gaping maw of flesh and viscera in her chest opened further and further, impossibly far, spanning the entire width of the road. Slamming on the brakes, our car spun into this tunnel of gore, all at once swallowed by a deep red throbbing darkness.

I woke up vomiting out the open passenger car door. Everett was already outside the car on my side, rubbing my back while avoiding my intermittent heaves. 

"Get a little carsick, eh?" Everett laughed and stood back to light another joint. He seemed in brighter spirits. I spat some last little chunks of my Grand Slam out and took a swig of some water to slosh around and spit again. "Don't blame the Denny's, I stand by their quality and service. Fine dining establishment." Okay his spirits seemed a little too fucking bright.

"I don't get carsick," I replied. He looked at the puddle of sick at my feet then back at me and winked.

"No worries bud. Anyways, your little spasms have a knack of keeping us on course. Check it out." He pointed at the base of the gnarled oak tree in the headlights. Sticking out of some hedge and brush was a rusted out old mailbox. Beyond that, a narrow drive lead up to a small cabin, barely visibly in the dark save for a little headlight glinting off it's windows.

Still reeling a bit, my lazy gaze fell back down the drive to the gnarled oak tree. The Y-shaped burns on the trunk...were gone.

"The tree..." I slurred. Everett glanced nonchalantly up at it's canopy, a few dead leaves still clinging to branches here and there.

"Yeah. Cool tree. Decent climbing if you can get up to that first big branch." What was he talking about?

"No, I mean, what happened to the burns?" He looked at me confused. "You said it was the same tree you saw before? The cool tree, with the Y-shape burns. Like it got hit by lightning. Is this the same tree?" I was beginning to feel a little crazy. The way his goofy, ready-for-tree-climbing-in-the-dark smile melted into a look of genuine concern did not help this feeling.

"Lightning burns? I don't- I mean I think it's a cool tree, but I didn't say anything about it til you pointed it out just now. I've never seen this tree before. What's going on, dude?"

I finally stood up and walked over, examining the trunk further. We'd been parked right where the car was parked. Both staring up through the windshield at this tree. He'd sounded so anxious talking about it, more than just nervous about being lost or going in circles. More like there was something about the tree itself that scared him. Or the burns. Had he seen the same gut wrenching vision of the woman in the road with the scars? Why was he acting so fucking chill now all of a sudden? Like he didn't remember the tree? 

I reached up to where the bottom of the Y-shape burn would have begun on the twisted, bulbous trunk. Had there been some trick of the light to cast a Y-shape shadow? Did the grooves of the bark create the illusion of a seam? I realized Ev was just standing behind me, looking increasingly worried.

"Okay," I said, "Just tell me what you remember about driving down this access road after we spun out."

He cocked an eyebrow and shrugged, "I mean, not much to remember. We were bumpin along this skinny ass horse trail for 20 minutes or so, listening to tunes. You were staring out the window then all of a sudden you opened the door and started spewing your guts out. I pulled to a stop and let ya yack it out. Now we're here."

"And you've never seen this tree before."

"Nope."

What the fuck. Did I hallucinate an entire conversation? Or had Everett somehow forgot? And what about the fever dream with the thing in the road? My mind was beginning to really swim. Luckily, just then a slight creaking noise from the direction of the cabin snapped me back to reality.

"Was that the door to our cabin?" I asked. 

Everett stared back blankly. He took a step towards me.

Another noise from the drive. Crunching footsteps, soft but audible. Getting closer. My rifle was packed away in the trunk, in a locked case. Not enough time to get it out and load it.

Everett stepped to my side and I glanced up at him, seeing an impish grin creep over his face. 

"There's something I did forget to tell you, though." He smiled and took another hit of his joint, passing it to me. I looked down at it. Had he laced it with something? To give me these visions? Why would my oldest friend fuck with me like this? What was he planning? The footsteps crunching on the snow were growing louder. It sounded like more than one person, too. Or something big.

"What?" I asked. The hedge near the mailbox rustled and two large, dark figures stepped out. Suddenly something was hurling rapidly through the air right at my head. I threw both my hands up and something cold and metallic struck them and bounced to the ground. Everett reached down to pick up our attackers projectile, I'd assumed to throw it back. Then I saw he was still grinning, and I looked at what he held in his hands. 

I would recognize the classic lettering and pin-up girl anywhere. Old Milwaukee Beer, Since 1849. Everett cracked it open and foam erupted out the top, spilling over the sides. 

"Heads up, pussy!" came a voice from the hedge. Stepping out from the shadows and tossing another cold beer my way was Everett's cousin Tommy followed by his younger brother Jay. 

Everett took a deep swig of beer foam and laughed, "I invited the idiots."
