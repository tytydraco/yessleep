**These are the first two entries from my exploration journal. I was documenting the ABC Cinema for a personal project, but things went sideways. I don’t know if I’ll post the rest, but if anyone’s experienced something similar—please let me know. I need to know I’m not the only one.**



**08/11** 



There were two places I had in mind for next time. The old fruit market, down by the Clyde, or the dilapidated building that used to be the ABC Cinema. 



The cinema stood out to me the most, but I was pretty sure that was because I had read strange articles about its closure. I had never gone inside, mind you, but something about it lingered in my mind. It would be cool to see what was left inside.



The old fruit market would have been fun too, though—it was where my Aunt used to sell her fruit and veg before she passed. I never got to visit her at work. Better late than never.



**09/11**



I ran into Michael down at the photography club. He said the old fruit market had been cordoned off due to a stabbing, so I guessed that was off the list.

The plan was to head to the ABC building the day after tomorrow.



**10/11**



I knew I had said two days but I just wanted to have a look around the outside— to see if there was any real way to get inside without someone calling the police. 



There seemed to be an unbarricaded entrance right at the front, the only thing I had to watch out for was other people.



If I went early enough, there wouldn't be anyone around. It was still winter, which meant it would be pitch black before 8am. I would head there for 7am just to be sure. The street was so deserted, it felt like another world— and that was just from the outside.



Just before I left I realised I had been watching the exterior of the building for longer than I thought. The sun had almost set and I could have sworn I had heard laughter coming from inside the cinema. 



Maybe someone else had the same idea, or maybe it was just the way sound carried in empty places. Either way, I thought I’d go for a pint before heading home.

  


**11/11**



**5AM.**



I had been worried that there would be early commuters who might’ve seen me trying to get into the ABC. I thought I’d head down earlier since I was already awake.



**6AM.**



I stood outside, coffee in hand. There really was something otherworldly about this place— it was as if time had stood still. Old ‘70s showings were still lettered on the marquee: *Grease* and *Jaws 2.* The cracks in the facade looked like they had always been there, while the vines and ivy desperately grasped at the broken windows. It felt more like a theatre than a cinema. A half-torn ‘Closed for Renovation’ sign hung lopsided on the front doors, its letters bleached almost white by time.



My fears of being seen by commuters faded when I realised I’d been standing here for over 25 minutes and hadn’t seen a single person—not even a fox. I stepped closer to the entrance and caught a faint whiff of something sweet. Popcorn? 



Everything was in ruins but the marquee. It remained pristine, almost untarnished, as if the years hadn’t dared touch it. The ticket booth’s glass was shattered, old ticket stubs littered the ground, and deep cracks ran through the stonework, spidering up the walls like veins. 



The moment I stepped into the foyer, the outside world fell silent. Not gradually, like walking into an empty building, but all at once—like a switch had been flipped. The air inside was thick, humid, almost oppressive—even though it was a crisp 5°C outside.



I took my time, carefully photographing every piece of history I could find, focusing on the things left behind—pieces of clothing, tills, machinery. It seemed as though people had left in a hurry. No company would abandon tills full of money unless there was a good reason for it. And why hadn’t the money been stolen after all these years?



I climbed the five steps leading deeper inside the cinema, inspecting the movie posters as I went. The ones that were behind glass had hardly aged a day in almost 20 years—movies I’d never heard of, from times I’d never experienced. 



Thinking of this place bustling and full of life gave me a strange sense of loss. 



Why had they never completed the renovations, surely this was a listed building?

  


**7AM** 



I found one of those “You Are Here” maps on the wall and used it as a guide, planning my route through the womb of the building and up into its heart—the projection room. I had read somewhere years ago that it might still be operable, and wanted to take a look for myself.



As I traced my path and tried to commit it to memory, I thought I heard distant murmuring voices. Immediately, my mind went to the laughter I had heard yesterday while standing outside. 



It was entirely possible that people were living in this building, and it was just as possible that my ears were playing tricks on me. 



I hesitated for a moment, but I knew I would still go deeper inside. 



There was something else, though—something I couldn't put my finger on. It hung in the air, distant yet rancid, like the stench of a dying animal.



**7:30AM.**



I stepped through the shattered door leading further inside; the ivy crawled around the frame as if it were reclaiming it. I shone my torch ahead, catching a flicker of movement at the edge of the light. I adjusted the angle—nothing. Just an empty waiting room, the old concession stand looming in the middle, swallowed by darkness. 



At the concession stand stood an old popcorn machine, its interior coated in a blackened substance. It was probably mould, but when the beam from my torch hit it, it looked alive—shiny and glistening, as if waiting for someone to touch it. 



The “You Are Here” map had shown a clear path to the projection room, but as I moved deeper into the building, it felt like wandering through a forest at night—my sense of direction fading, replaced by a growing sense of unease. The murmuring I thought I heard before was gone now, leaving only the silence ringing in my ears. 



**8AM.**



I cautiously stepped through the debris and broken glass, each crunch underfoot like tiny bombs exploding in the silence. I had documented the concession stand and then turned to visualise my route. I wanted to check out some of the cinema rooms before I headed upstairs. I swung my torch around, scanning the numbers on the cinema room doors. I chose one at random—Screen 6—walked toward it, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.



The walkway into the theatre was so dark it seemed to swallow my torchlight—so thick, I thought I could feel it brush against me. Without my torch, navigating this space would be impossible. I tried not to dwell on the fact that I had only brought one torch and a single set of batteries. 



I pushed open the double doors and was instantly struck by the overwhelming red. The walls, seats, carpets, and curtains—all red. As I scanned the room, I realized it was much larger than the building’s exterior had suggested. The walls loomed tall and fractured, and where ceiling lights once hung, only gaping black voids remained.



The ceiling itself, though cracked enough to expose the outside, let in little natural light—only making the room feel even redder.



Amid the sea of seats, one stood out—a single chair pushed down, as if someone was sitting there.



I walked over to investigate, expecting to find a broken mechanism or rusted hinges keeping it down. Instead, I found a perfectly functional seat, undamaged by time. Not a single piece of debris rested on it. It looked sterile compared to everything around it. 



At first, I didn’t think much of it. A bit strange, maybe, how clean it was. Just a seat, nothing more. 



But the longer I stared at it, the more certain I became—someone was sitting there. 



I shifted on my feet, suddenly aware of how wild my thoughts had become and decided now would be a good time to head upstairs. 



My mouth was so dry it felt like I had eaten sand, I quickly shuffled my way out of the row of seats back onto the stepped aisle. While walking up the steps to the exit, a burning desire crept over me—I needed to turn around.



I turned, almost expecting to see someone staring back at me. Instead I found everything exactly as it was. The strange seat still down, everything else still in its place. 



I shook my head, how had my thoughts become so fantastical? I winced at myself. How many years have you done urban exploration? The only scary thing here is my imagination. 



I hurriedly pushed the door open, which led directly back into the thick black walkway. 



As I took my first step into the abyss, I heard it. 



The familiar sound of a cinema seat, returning to its normal upright position.
