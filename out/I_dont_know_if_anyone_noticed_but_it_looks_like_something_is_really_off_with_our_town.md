Hi there.
I'm not usually an emotional type. I mean, I'm not depressed or anything like that, it's just that I don't really care that much. I go to work, do my job, come home, and chill on my couch, watching some BS on TV just for the sake of it. I'm not sure why people see it as something problematic, but I simply couldn't care less. You can call me autistic or a psycho, like my ma, but I'd rather identify as content. I never strived for the stars and do the bare minimum. And I only bother to tell you this in anticipation of you questioning my actions, behaviors, and motivation, which I have none of.

Since y'all are smart and all here, maybe you can clear something up for me.

As indifferent as I am, I'm still just a human, and recently, something sparked my interest.

So... Did you notice anything weird recently? I mean, for quite some time now, I've seen our town get a little... off, if that makes sense. Have you noticed it too? 
Like that old traffic light on Sunny Street? It's been flickering randomly for a while now, so I can imagine it being annoying, especially at nights, and nobody seems to bother fixing it. I don't have any good faith in our services and shit, but why is nobody doing anything about it? Shouldn't there be a bunch of middle-aged ladies blowing up the phones of the town's administration? 

Then there were some suspicious cars with number plates from all over the states, while normally, it takes an eternity till someone just passes by. Like, donâ€™t I know something is up? I can imagine that with my lifestyle, I can easily miss out on many events, but there's nothing I can find online or whatever. Maybe you heard something? 

I mean, I'm not into putting on a detective cap and digging into things like that, at least usually, but the atmosphere here got weird too. Maybe I'm tripping, I don't know, but going back to Sunny Street, what's with the trees here, too? It's springtime, yet it looks like they already have leaves, and they are yellowing? Is that normal? I wouldn't be surprised if it's some environmental BS or something, but all of it together? With birds and shit vanishing? When was the last  time you heard a bird chirping? Plus I don't think y'all just decided to get rid of your pets, too? So where's the animals? Not to mention that when our tap water was nasty already, now it has this weird rusty taste to it? Is it like government doing whatever they doing, or we're overlooking some ecological disaster or so? 
Like all this together is weird, and I'm not a big lover of conspiracy theories, but something is really off, no? So anyone knows anything?

If you live at or near Sunny Street, please contact me. I really don't want to think it's just me. And no, I don't do any drugs or drink to the point I lose touch with reality.
