 It started at the beginning of this week, together with Lex and Nina, my 2 closest friends, I went for a drink:

“I am just wondering, as humans, why do we have two hands?”, I asked. 

“Easy.”, Lex answered. 

He came closer to me and gave me a slap with his right hand on my left cheek. 

“So I could hit you”, he smirked. 

“What about the le…”

But before his words were spoken out, Lex gave me another slap, this time with his left hand on my right cheek. 

“So I could hit you with the other”, He sat down and took a sip from his drink. 

“Good thing he only has two hands, right?”, Nina joked. 

“Congratulations, Lex, you just beat out the drunkenness out of me.”, I said, I tried to hide a grimace, but it wasn’t particularly a very soft slap. 

&#x200B;

\- “Oh, please, no one can do that. It’s a power only reserved for the gods.” 

“Fire. Water. Burn!”, Nina said. 

“Now…speaking of hands…”, I continued.

&#x200B;

“I don’t like where this is going”, Nina intervened again. 

“Dirty mind much, Nina?”, I countered. 

&#x200B;

“That is what you make of it”, she said, giving me a wink. 

“Let the boy talk, he has something to say.”, His glass in his hand, Lex pointed at me and I continued my dialogue.

“Much appreciated”, I said “…anyway what I was about to say … there’s this fortune teller at the town’s fair this week.”

“So? I mean it’s probably some old lady gibbering some stuff…”, Nina responded. 

“I could be, but come on… wouldn’t it be fun to if we all went over there and get our future, destiny, whatnot … told!” 

“I already know my fate, it’s a gorgeous blonde with a Brazilian bum lift.”

&#x200B;

“Lex gosh…”, Nina rolled her eyes.  

“And if it isn’t my fate, it sure is my destiny.” 

At that moment the bar boy headed to our table. 

“Anything else for drinks?”, he said. 

“No no, I think we have had enough, you can bring the bill please”, Nina answered. 

“Sure.”, the boy answered. He cleaned up our drinks and went to the bar. 

“…and your phone number”, Nina whispered as soon he was gone. 

“I’m afraid he doesn’t hear you”, I whispered to her. 

&#x200B;

\- “Too bad…he was my crush in high school … you know.”

“That guy?”, it was Lex who questioned it, looking back despite the fact the boy was no longer standing there. 

\- “Yeah, but he has been with one of the girls that used to be in my class for a life time now: Lucy, she’s a total B.” 

“And you’re an A?”, Lex asked.  

“I’m an A++”, she said while hitting Lex on his upper-arm.

“Okay…okay…so you should triumph with ease.” 

\- “Not exactly, she has rich parents, which makes her the queen B. A rare case of a B that could triumph over an A++.”

“Queen B, ain’t that Beyoncé?” 

Nina sighed. “Ugh boys, you always have to explain them so much…” 

Someone headed back to our table, it wasn’t the bar boy from earlier, but an older looking lady - I guess she was in her late sixties - who came with the bill. 

“Please and thank you.”, she said.

“Thank you!”, Nina replied. 

As soon as she was gone, Nina whispered to Lex: 

“Should I fix her number for you?”

&#x200B;

\- “Shut up, Nina…”

“I will not if you pay… you’ll never pay, Lex, when we go out.”,

“That is true”, I said and stood up from my seat, ready to leave. 

“See? So what do you say? You pay or one-way ticket to cougar town?”

\- “I guess I’ll pay then.” 

“Good boy!”, Nina whispered, her head was barely inches from Lex's. That ‘fake’ flirting between them has been a running gag for ages now. Although I couldn't figure out if it was really still a gag.  

Lex payed the bill and we went outside. 

&#x200B;

“So…what shall we do now?”, Lex started off.

“I guess we could go visit that fortune teller”, Nina said. 

“You changed your mind?”, I asked surprisingly. 

\- “Yeah, either I get to know I’ll be rich or I have a funny story to tell.”

“You’re both too excited for this”, Lex said. 

“It could be fun I guess, even if it's just so I can tease you what demons will haunt you for the rest of your life”, Nina said, teasing Lex again.

\- “If these demons exist out of hot blondes like these Victoria Secret models I’m all down for it”

“Ugh, you know these models are called angels, right? Not demons!” 

\- “They will be demons, when I lay my hands on them”

Lex whispered in Nina’s ear: “I will awake the devil within them!”

“You’re so…” 

\- “Hot?”

“Un-woke. If you would be a celebrity, they would have cancelled you 5 times over already. Twitter would explode cause of all these people tweeting what a massive, misogynist piece of shit you are. ”

\- “I do it all for my boy, Elon.” 

“Tom, will you please tell Lex that he is a sad…very sad man.”

“I’m not ready to get hurt again.”, I said.  

“The boy gets it.”, Lex laughed. “But hey… no jokes… you’re okay, right, I didn’t hit you too hard?”

“Nah, I’m fine”, I said. 

Something in my voice must have sounded with little self-confidence as it triggered Nina to hug me and hold me close to her. 

“Oooh, poor Tom”, she said while giving me a kiss on the cheek. “Stay away from him, Lex, Tommy-boy is a treasure.”

\- “Sorry, buddy, I didn’t mean to…” 

“But I said it’s fine right? Oh hey… look we’re almost there.”, I said. 

And yes, we were a few steps away from the plaza where the fair was set up. The fortune tellers' tent was closest to us and was a bit separated from the rest of the fair’s attractions. 

Outside hung a board with the drawing of hand where the lines had been made clearly visible. At the bottom of the drawing was a price list. 

“15 dollars for adults and 10 dollar for kids starting price for half an hour? Damn!”, Lex said. 

“Should be a fair price, for you, Lex!”, Nina said. 

\- “Why for me?”

“You know…getting to know when exactly in your life, you will suffer from erectile dysfunction would be invaluable to me.”, Nina winked. 

\- “Looks like the A++ just made herself a total B.” 

“Oh… so you figured it out. The grade system? Whaaat…?” 

“Be gentle to each other, please”, I said. 

“Sir, she started it”. While Lex and Nina continued their tit-for-tat game, I looked at the board and turned back to them.

“Hang on… hang on…" I said. "Ok, here’s the deal… it’s my treat.”

“You’re gonna pay 45 dollars for the three of us … seriously?”, Lex asked. 

“I told you, he is a treasure”, repeated Nina. 

“Of course… after all it’s my birthday!”

“It’s your birthday?!”, Nina’s mouth fell open. “Why haven’t you told us? Oh god, I feel so bad.” 

“Yeah, me too, oh dude … I feel so bad for slapping you earlier. You know what… you can give me a free slap. Here. Here.”, Lex said while pointing at his left cheek. 

“No no no, here’s what we’re gonna do. We’ll pay the tickets. ”, Nina countered. 

“Ok… wait …”, it was Lex doubting if a slap in his face would be more beneficial than paying money. I bet he was making a pros and cons list in his head. 

“We…”, emphasised Nina “pay the tickets. Oh my god, that’s why you invited us to grab some drinks today. To celebrate…it all makes sense. God, I feel so bad. Why haven’t you told us, Tom, why haven’t you told us.” 

“You. Should. Have. Told. Us.”, Nina said while punching me on the shoulder. 

“We”, Lex intervened again, “should have remembered it”. 

“Shut up, Lex, you’re a bad friend too!” and she tried to gave him a slap in his face which was a rather funny sight, because of Lex being a head taller than she is, she didn’t really succeed. Instead, she waved her arms near his shoulders. 

“That is uncalled for!”, Lex responded. 

“But necessary!”, Nina replied. 

And so we waited in line at the fortune tellers’ tent for like half an hour. Lex started to get hungry and went in search of a burger joint nearby, without us noticing at first. A few moments later he returned to the queue, his hands and mouth smeared with ketchup dripping off the burger. 

“Yeah, thanks for bringing something for us!”, Nina said sarcastically.  

“I… didn’t…”, Lex said not fully realising his mistake. 

“Yes, indeed, you didn’t!”, Nina snarled. 

We got to the cash register where Nina spoke up. 

“Three tickets please.”

“Three adults?”, the cash registrant asked. 

Nina looked behind her for a second where she saw Lex still struggling with his hamburger. 

She pointed at him and looked back to the cashier. 

“Does he count for a child?”

The cashier smiled and shook her head. 

“I’m afraid not.”, she responded. 

\- “Not even an immaturity discount?”, 

“Alas,”, the cashier responded. “If we would have that it would rather be a tax than a discount”, she said while taking a glimpse of Lex who was still battling his teeth through the hamburger.

“Ok, here’s 45.”, Nina said drily. 

&#x200B;

We returned to Lex who was standing at the back still eating his hamburger. 

“For God’s sake, Lex, be careful before you gonna spill some on the tapestry.” 

“I came well prepared”, he said and reached with his right hand to his right pocket unveiling several napkins. 

\- “Great. So you thought about thát, but not about us?”

“You should have asked.”, Lex answered drily.  

\- “Right… You owe me $7.50 for Tom’s ticket, by the way.”

“I’ll send my payment as soon as I can.”

\- “I would make haste though, otherwise your fate will be decided before a fortune teller even can speak off it”.

&#x200B;

At all of a sudden a rather old looking man with thick, greying hair and crooked glasses came out the corridor that must have led to the fortune teller’s tent. 

He looked at us for a brief moment and then at the cashier. He gave a soft smile and said thank you, his big eyes continuously staring at the floor, he made his way outside. I noticed he had a handkerchief covering his left hand. It had blood stains on it…

The woman was not quite gone or I heard Lex's chuckle. He had finished his hamburger by now. Nina gave him an elbow bump, rolled her eyes, but couldn’t suppress a smile herself and shook her head. 

“Come on Lex…”, she said. 

“She is expecting you…”, the cashier said.  

“Can we go together?”, Nina asked. 

“Yes, of course you can”, the cashier answered as if it were an obvious question. 

&#x200B;

The three of us went trough the small, dark corridor leading to the tent. Nina was in the lead and slowly bent her way forward, fearful she might break the entire tent’s construction otherwise. 

We reached the end of the corridor and a dim light in the center of the tent lit up a part of the area. 

Behind the round, small table sat - I guess to each of our amazement - a young woman. She had pitch-black eyes, dark-brown eyebrows and a thin, pale face. Around her small, tall neck she wore a necklace from which hung a gold jewel in the shape of an upside-down hand with a silver eye in the centre. 

She spoke to us with a soft voice. 

“Welcome, which of you shall I start with?” 

“That would be our birthday boy!”, Nina shouted, pulling me to the front and seemingly a bit too excited to the likings of the soothsayer. 

“Hmm… on second thought… I’d like to start with you.”, She said while looking at Nina.

“Me?”, Nina said astonished. 

“Okay… to be clear… if I am about to die or something…I’d like to call in ambulance in advance. Just to be sure.” 

The young lady kept silent. 

“Please sit down and show me your hands”, she said. 

Nina sat down and brought her hands above the table. She looked at them, gave a soft smile and looked then back in the eyes of the soothsayer. 

But as soon as Nina’s hands were visible, the soothsayer focus’ was on them. 

Nina seemingly felt a bit uncomfortable about the fortune teller lady staring at her fingers.

Eventually, the lady spoke up: “Is this your first time you’ll undergo hand reading?” 

“Yes, I guess this is the first time”, she paused and then said; “I do get a nail polish at times”. 

Lex gagged, when I saw the lady face’ stayed neutral, I made a sign to Lex to cut it off. 

He cleared his throat and went quiet again. 

The lady kept looking at Nina’s hands, seemingly examining every slightest detail of it. Nina made her eyes small and pursed her lips. 

“Can I hold them”, the lady eventually said. 

“Sure!”, Nina responded. 

Nina reacted with a light shock as soon as The Lady grabbed both her hands, still examining their backs. 

“Oeh, cold hands!”, she said. 

“You endured quite a lot”, the fortune teller spoke. 

“She knows!”, Nina whispered to Lex. 

“That’s from hanging out with these boys, of course”, Nina said while winking to the fortune teller. But she didn’t seem to give it any attention. 

\- “No…your father…” 

Nina stopped breathing for a second. The fortune teller turned both her hands. 

“He died not so long ago, right?”, the young woman went with her index finger over a line close to her palm. Nina tried to give a slight pull in attempt to retract her hands. I felt like it already became too personal to her liking. But the fortune teller’s grip was stronger and was determined not to let go of her hands.

“Nina?”, I heard Lex saying.  

“Your life line is quite a bit shattered, more than most of your age. And someone is responsible.”, The fortune teller moved with her middle finger to the area below Nina’s index finger and her thumb. She pressed on it. 

“And you hate them for it. You curse their names, you shout, you cry, you bang on walls so loud that neighbours complain they can’t sleep at night. These men took away who you always loved the most in this world. Who was always there for you. In absence of your mother…”, The fortune teller kept pressing the area. 

“Stop…”, Nina said. Tears came to her eyes. “Stop!”, her voice grew louder. “STOP!”, and she pulled her hands away. The fortune teller wouldn’t let go again. Lex and I both came closer, but now Nina managed to withdraw her hands. 

I have never seen Nina panic like that in my life. She held both her hands to her head. Her eyes turned red from the heavy tears she was crying out. 

Nina's hand was bleeding at the spot where the fortune teller had pressed several times.

I couldn't believe it, how was it possible that her hand was bleeding. I had seen it with my own eyes as the fortune teller pressed on it. She didn’t use something sharp or pinched it, nor were her nails long enough to cause that. 

Nina was crying out loud, as if she was in severe pain. “I could help you, this should not be your destiny”, The fortune teller said. 

Lex intervened: “You’ve done enough!”. 

He dragged Nina out of the tent. I couldn't grasp what was happening. I immediately followed Lex and Nina, until all of a sudden I felt a hand grabbing my shoulder.

“I could help her. I could really help her… This shouldn’t be her destiny.”, the soothsayer said. I turned around and and it was only since then that I noticed she was wearing a glove on her other hand. The hand that hadn’t touched Nina. 

I heard her words, but I kept moving, I wanted to be with my friends. I was mad the soothsayer did hurt Nina even if it was maybe unintentional…

I met again with Lex and Nina outside the tent. Lex had given her a napkin for her hand to steep the bleeding. She sobbed.

“You sure your hand is okay?”, I said. “Do we have to go to a hospital?”

“No, it’s fine … it’s fine.”, she said with a soft voice, “Just bring me home. Just bring me home.”

We accompanied her to her home that was a few metres away from where the fair was located. 

“You sure we don’t need to go to a hospital?”, Lex repeated. 

“No, it’s okay, it’s okay. I just need a bit of rest now, that’s all.” 

“What about your hand?”, I asked. 

\- “The bleeding has stopped anyway. It will be okay. It will be okay. I just have to lay in my bed now.”, She said with a crackling voice. 

“You have to explain to us what happened, Nina?”, I said, “We want to help you!”

\- “I’ll explain later. Let’s meet this Saturday again at the same bar as today. I’ll text you the details.”

“It’ll be fine boys”, She smiled. 

For the first time since the incident she seemed to recover at least a bit. 

“See you Saturday!”, She turned around and went into her apartment.

&#x200B;

Feeling so guilty about my suggestion to go to that fortune teller, Lex tried to take away my guilt. He believes a certain something in that tent had sparked an earlier trauma in Nina or something like that.

We agreed to get together again this weekend, hopefully that can shine a light on the events that happened today. I hope she will be okay…
