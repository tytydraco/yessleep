I don’t scare easy. After so many years in the Russian police, you grow numb to blood and tragedy. But a handful of cases still make my skin crawl.

# The Address

Stalin-era six-story building. We’re headed to the fourth floor.

The smell is there, strong, steady.

The door’s wooden, flimsy, but barred from the inside. Which means no choice but to break it. We wait for the local beat cop, smoke a cigarette.

We break in. Step inside.

First thought I had: who the hell was he locking out with that bar? Why?

Inside — poor but neat. Classic pensioner setup.

And in the room — a a hanged man.

First thing I notice — no chair tipped over beneath him.

This is a Stalin-build, high ceilings. Old man, heavy, no way in hell he could’ve just “jumped” into the noose on his own.

The rope was good quality, sturdy stuff. The kind you wouldn’t be embarrassed to hang yourself with.

Anchored to the ceiling using a drill, screws, dowels. I didn’t see any of that hardware anywhere in the apartment, and I looked.

What I did see — were tracks.

On the ceiling.

Right across the whitewash, someone had been running. Not just brushing against it with their feet, but full weight, sprinting. Disregarding physics and gravity like it didn’t exist. Sprinting, not walking — the pattern was clear.

And there’s the hanged man, who couldn’t have hung himself.

And the apartment, locked from the inside, no one leaving.

And those tracks.

All my life I was a cynical realist, atheist, didn’t believe in any crap. But this? I just can’t explain it.

# The Fingers

Another call from my ever-vigilant fellow citizens.

A bag was found. With fingers.

Just like that, neatly packed in a plastic bag.

I like tidy maniacs — makes my job easier.

Exactly 20 fingers. Human. Cut clean at the base. Very neat work, no amateur could’ve done that.

Carefully bagged. Shame they didn’t bother burying them properly.

Female fingers. Forensics confirmed it, I saw it myself — manicured nails, the works.

They’d been in the ground for a while, but it was winter. In winter, you can pull that off.

Investigative work, as usual, gave us nothing.

But forensics did manage to surprise us — all 20 fingers belonged to the same woman.

Yeah. They double-checked. Over and over. Same conclusion.

# The Spirals

Daytime call, for once — thanks for that. Siren, car ride, I’m half-asleep in the back anyway.

Outskirts. Strip of forest. Dead woman with one leg.

Some winter tourist found her. They can’t sit at home, apparently.

The other leg — sawn off with something. Roughly. Could’ve been anything: saw, axe, even teeth.

Forensics later didn’t clarify much — looked like multiple tools were used.

But here’s the thing — almost no tracks around. Just the woman.

Time of year: winter. Snow.

No snowfall recently, and in the old snow there’s a single trail — one footprint.

A single leg hopping. In spirals. For five kilometers.

In a boot. Matching the one still on the body.

Stride length matched, too. Like an average woman hopping on one leg.

Five kilometers. In winter. Through the woods.

The sever point of the missing leg wasn’t found.

What we do have: clear track of a woman entering the forest on two legs.

A point where she continues alone on one — no blood, no foreign tracks.

And from there, she abandons the straight path… starts hopping in spirals.
