I have had sleep paralysis/lucid dreaming that would come and go for as long as I can remember. I have felt it all- being unable to move, watching myself sleep, my chest being pressed down, even at one point feeling that my arms were pressed down in my back. I am now 25, and I have pretty much gotten used to them. I have learned to live with them and have found ways to force myself to wake up and go back to sleep after a while and it has helped. In my adolescent years they were more frequent and severe but have progressively decreased after I got married and moved homes. 

However, I have noticed that in the last year not only my sleep paralysis has increased, but also that I have developed other sleep disturbances. My sleep paralysis experience has not been as severe as before as I just become unable to move or wake up but they have increased in occurrences. I experience them almost every night. My other disturbances include waking up screaming or crying after hearing any external sounds (e.g my dogs barking, the air moving paper and even when my husband moves positions). I also experience night terrors and would wake up crying completely terrified without remembering what I had dreamed. Another thing (probably the most concerning) is that I have also been experiencing audio and visual hallucinations that ONLY occur when I am waking up and goes away once I am fully awake. This started severe as I would hear a lady whispering my name and insulting me nonstop. When the whispering happened I would feel a tingling sensation in my ear, and the heat of the voice. I later developed bruxism and strangely chronic pain (as a result of bruxism) that mostly happened in the exact ear where I would hear the whispering of the lady. Since this obviously scared the shit out of me I went to a catholic priest, which gave me the Saint Archangel Michael prayer which surprisingly (whether it was placebo or not) led me to not experience hallucinations or paralysis for months.

Unfortunately, I have recently started again to experience paralysis, terrors and disturbances multiple times a week. The hallucinations have only become auditory and still only happen when I waking up and stop always once I am fully awake. I don't hear, feel or see anything scary, as I would just hear a phone ringing, my alarm or doors opening which of course disturbs my sleep but is better than the lady. I have not experienced anything paranormal ever since I went with the priest but I have become extremely fearful and paranoid to sleep at night because I fear that I will wake up screaming or experience paralysis since they have become much more frequent. Just yesterday I experienced them nonstop for two hours. I am curious to know if anybody else has experienced this as I have only seen paralysis and terrors in this group. What are your thoughts? Has anybody else been experiencing anything similar?
