I'm a veterinarian and in my last visit I found a terrible letter in my last visit to a very way farm. The letter goes as follows:

I live in a far a way farm in a country side away from any form of interaction or civilization.

&#x200B;

This is important because what I saw could not be a person.

&#x200B;

In the middle of the night after a long day of working I was just trying to relaxing read a good old book. Then it started.The animals were acting different. It started with the horses. They were neighing in a weird way. I would have checked it, but as soon as it started it stoped.

&#x200B;

The next few days weren't different from the usual, until, maybe a week after the horses, the cows started to moo. But just like the horses it was different. I got out to check it, but as the last time it ended before I could check.

&#x200B;

The next few days passed normally, I still felt uneasy so I passed the nights sleeping in the couch next to the door. I was about to give up when it happened again. This time it wasn't just the horses and cows. It was the entire fucking farm! 

&#x200B;

I got up to a run to see that the pigs and the sheep, even my loyal dog was barking weird. But this time was different. It was more as a scream than a call or anything. I tried to call them with ration, a special call, touch, everything I could think of I tried. Then all of a sudden they all stopped and fall to the ground, like they were worshipping someone, or something. They might have been done that the other two time and I just couldn't notice.

&#x200B;

The first time I was annoyed by it, the second I was worry, but this time... I was trembling to my knees. I wasn't easily scared or afraid. But those sounds weren't normal. The first thing I did in in the morning was to call a veterinarian. But I wasn't taking any chances. I call all veterinarians I could afford. If my life stock is dead I can't make money. As I said before I live very far way so it would take them a day or two so every thing I could do as wait and hope this happens again.

&#x200B;

To my surprise, I was hopping this was just some in a lifetime thing, they were weirder. The pigs and sheep were running in circles and in the walls. The horses were jumping around and hitting each other. The cows were laying and rolling around. And my dog, who is usually very energetic were stand still like a statue. I was starting to think it was dead but somehow still up in all four, because of all the craziness that have been happening. If it wasn't for the dog's faint and weak gasps for air I would have digged a grave for the dog.

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to do. I was just... Out of my mind. When I was about to cry and run to the city to get something. They all made a sound like to call me, now I know why, and when I got there to check they were acting completely normal.  I should have suspect it, but a felling told me it was ok to get back. So I just went back like nothing happened. And in fact nothing extraordinary happened, until the night.

&#x200B;

Now they were quite, except for the dog. The dog called me, we have a special sound we do to each other when we need. I got there to check it and in the corner of my eye, in the horazion I saw a human figure. And then I tried to get closer.

&#x200B;

I thought it was one of the veterinarians. And the closer I get the further it seems to be. I should stopped there, but something in me told me it was someone who needed help. I normally don't help other people. Hell! Why do you think I set up a farm so far away. But ignore the feeling made me sick and getting near the figure was satisfying.

&#x200B;

I have been walking for some time when I notice an old and rotting trough, the ones we put salt on to the life stock eat. It was there that hit me how much I have been walking, that trough is in the border of the farm, that's why it was rotting it is so far way it's not used anymore. That moment I tried to fled. I actually tried, but at that moment I saw it figure. He was like a young boy in a red coat and a short jeans. I was intrigued and continue to follow him in the middle of a dense forest. 

&#x200B;

I follow him for what it felt to be six hours, but I don't know if I can trust this because the stars and the moon were still out. And it wasn't like he was moving fast, he actually wasn't moving at all the distance just seems to stay the same. After a lot more time walking I began to see that there were less distance and I could finally picture his face. For my surprise his face was normal. At this point if his face was of my dog I would be less surprised. 

&#x200B;

But his face was normal and for some reason his face was scarier than it should be. Up close inspection he wasn't a kid he was more of an adult but in a small size. Then the kid just talked. His voice was monotone and calm yet distant, disturbing and creepy. He didn't say much, but it was enough to get to my bones, literally. He just said:

&#x200B;

"I have played with you enough. Go home..."

&#x200B;

The kid then just disappear like foam in the beach. I would try to find him, but that felling of sickness come back when I think of it. With fear I simply try to get back home and in just about ten minutes walking in the forest I got to what was supposed to be my farm. But it was different.

&#x200B;

The placement of the corral, the main house and the dog's house were it was supposed to be, but they also we're distorted. It was like half of the main house were being built yesterday and the other half was abandoned for centuries. The corral were made of the animals I had, just then I realized it I was without any animals. The dog's house was like it was paint in the floor.

&#x200B;

Before I could feel grief I felt a chill to my bones... literally. I realized I could feel my meat and my bones rubbing against it other, it felt great at first. But just soon after it start to feel the rubbing getting worse and worse. I'm writing this if the few strength I have left.

&#x200B;

I know my time is coming, so now all can hope is that the veterinarians, or who the fuck comes first, to see what happened to my farm and take this as a warning.

&#x200B;

DON'T TALK WITH THIS KID!

The rest of the letter was just scribbles in gibberish.

This was expected as the corpse it was near had pitch black eyeballs and it's skin was all over the floor, his members were also twisted and broken. And I know the letter is true because I saw the rotting living corral and that made me sick to my stomach.

As I could do nothing more I decided to ignore it, ride back home and pass all that of as a weird dream. Wich let me to post this.

I also have a dog and yesterday it was barking in a weird way to something. And when I tried to look at it, all I saw was... A kid... In a red coat... And short jeans. I don't know if the farmer's story is true, but I hope it is otherwise I don't think I have much time.
