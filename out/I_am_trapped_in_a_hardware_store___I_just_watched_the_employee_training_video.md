 My world narrows until the only thing left  is the price tag, the warmth from the flickering screen, the shifting text, and my name. Korynn Wallace. And beneath it, in bold black letters: LOW STOCK.

I can’t move. I can’t think. There’s something fundamentally wrong about seeing my own name printed there—like I’m not a person, just an item waiting to be pulled from the shelf.

The intercom crackles, a slow hiss that coils in my ears.

“Aisle associate Korynn please make your way to the Employee Lounge.”

My stomach plummets as the floor shifts dramatically, and throws me off balance. I try to resist it, but the Store doesn’t care what I want. My boots lose traction. My body lurches forward, weight pulling me down like I’ve stepped onto the edge of a slide I didn’t know was there.

I throw my hands out, reaching for anything—the floor, the base of a shelf, a loose product—but it’s useless. The ground is too smooth, the tiles too slick beneath my fingertips. I slam against a metal shelf, fingers clawing at the edge, but it tilts with me, the products shifting, sliding, tumbling past me in a slow-motion avalanche. A box clips my shoulder.

I try to grab anything. My nails scrape against the tile. The friction rips at them. Something sharp splits the edge of my thumb. A flare of pain. I feel the sticky warmth of blood. Still, I scramble, dig, claw, but the Store isn’t letting me stop. It wants me to go forward. Toward him. I slam into the Manager. I choke on a breath as I stumble back to my feet, the shock of it knocking the panic loose. The Manager doesn’t flinch.He doesn’t even acknowledge that I just crashed into him. 

The Store stops tilting. The floor settles. The movement ceases. I stand there, panting, heart hammering. Blood wells from the split edge of my nail. My fingers sting. I stumble back from the Manager, gasping, my balance still unsteady, my fingers burning from the futile attempt to claw onto something—anything.

But as my breath rattles in my throat, as the blood from my broken nail drips onto the tile, I realize— The Store has changed again. The shelves are gone. The aisles have disappeared. I am somewhere else. A hallway. And I know this hallway. Even before my brain fully registers where I am, I feel my muscles clench.

The words rip out of my mouth before my brain can even catch up. 

**"No! No, no, no—Not here. Not here. Please, anywhere but here!"**

I’ve seen this place before, but only in glimpses—from a distance, in the gaps between shifting aisles. Once, when I was running from a fight near the Iron Fang’s territory, I turned a corner and saw it.

A long, windowless corridor, lined with more  fluorescent lights. It’s too clean, too perfect. It didn’t look like it belonged in the store at all. I ran the other way. Everyone did. The factions don’t talk about it much, but when they do, they call it the Employee Lounge. No one who goes in has ever come back.

And now, I’m the one stepping inside. 

The hallway ends abruptly. One moment, I’m being led through the impossible corridor. The next, the Manager in front of me steps aside, and I am somewhere else.

The Employee Lounge. I don’t step in. I don’t want to. But the Manager doesn’t force me, it doesn’t need to. Because as I blink and take in my surroundings - I see the door that was just in front of me has already closed behind me.

I take a breath and I regret it immediately. The air is thick and stale. Not like the rest of the Store. The Lounge is sealed. Preserved. Like no air has moved in years. I get the strange feeling that  no one ever really breathes here.

There is furniture. Chairs. A seemingly cheap plastic couch. A table with old magazines whose pages are blank. A vending machine glows softly in the corner. Perfectly stocked. But something about it makes my skin crawl. Everything feels off, even the the coffee brewing in the corner.  I don’t know why, until I realize—The vending machine should be whirring, the coffee should be making a sound with each drip into the pot. I wait, but sound never comes. Then i realized something else - the coffee never finishes brewing. The pot is half full. But it never fills more than that. It just keeps going. 

I turn my gaze away from the pot, trying not to think about it. Then, I see them. I see people. They’re sitting at the tables, still, silent, staring at the TV. They aren’t moving or blinking. They aren’t bound or restrained. But they don’t try to leave. They just… sit. Their faces are expressionless. Their eyes fixed forward as if they’ve forgotten how to move.

Something churns in my gut. My chest tightens. I don’t know what I expected—something violent, something immediate. But I think this is worse. The Manager moves toward the center of the room. It doesn’t look at the others because they are exactly where they should be. Instead, it turns toward me. And sits. He just sits down, like this is just a breakroom, like we are just in the middle of an interview, like this is simply another day.

And then it gestures to me in a  slow, deliberate movement. His hand, palm up toward the seat across from him. He’s telling me to sit. I don’t move. I won’t.

The Manager tilts its head—a fraction too far. A burst of static, shrieks overhead,  my pulse slams against my neck, my heart beating wildly in its cage. Then I hear a voice.

“Thank you for joining us”

My body locks up. The Manager’s mouth doesn’t move. But it keeps gesturing. Like it’s the one speaking. But it isn’t, the intercom is. The words are perfectly clear, perfectly calm. Like something isn’t just saying them—it’s reading them.

The Manager tilts its head again, motions toward the chair across from it. The intercom speaks again.

“We are delighted you've joined us.”

I swallow. My mouth is dry. Then the vending machine hums, shortly after another  sudden noise makes my breath catch in my throat. I hear a soft clunk as something drops into the tray. My fingers twitch at my sides. I know better than to check. I know whatever’s inside isn’t something I want.

The intercom crackles.

“Collect your uniform.”

I glance at the Manager. It hasn’t moved, but its hand has shifted, gesturing toward the vending machine.

Again, the intercom repeats itself, like a mother correcting  a child who has been misbehaving.

“Collect your uniform.”

I force myself forward. My boots echo loud against the carpet. The vending machine buzzes softly. The buttons are blank. I crouch. My fingers hover over the tray. I hesitate. I pull it out slowly, carefully. It’s neatly folded. Pressed. Clean. A blue vest with a logo that reads Pinnacle Hardware.

And pinned to the front—My name tag.

KORYNN WALLACE

Like it’s always been mine. My breath shudders. The intercom crackles again.

“Proceed to the viewing area.”

I look up.

The Manager is waiting. And  beyond it—There are rows of chairs, sat in them are people staring at the screen. The TV flickers. The training video is about to begin.

A moment of static, then a corporate jingle plays—soft, generic, and friendly.

“Welcome to Pinnacle Hardware! Where quality and service never run out.” 

The screen fades in. A man in a neat blue vest stands in front of a fully stocked shelf, holding a clipboard. He has brown hair, parted to the side,one side of his face stretched slightly further then the other and pressed on his face is a smile.

“Hello, and welcome to the team!”

His voice is surprisingly cheerful and warm. I barely register his  words because my gaze is locked on the people watching.

They sit in perfect rows, unmoving, eyes locked on the screen. And in the middle of them—Liam

He went missing three days ago. And now he’s here. Wearing a blue vest. There’s no name on his nametag . His face is blank. But his eyes are open.

I inhale sharply, a sound that seems to scream in the dead silence of the room. The video continues.

“At Pinnacle Hardware, we value hard work, dedication, and customer satisfaction.”

A slogan flashes across the screen:

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IS TOP PRIORITY.

For a second—no, it was less than a second, it was just a moment—I saw the screen distort. The words change and before I even finish blinking they’re back to normal.

My heartbeat pounds in my ears. The host is still talking, but the words don’t feel like they matter anymore. Because something is wrong with the sound.

Under the cheerful voice, there’s something else. Something faint. A whisper, a second voice, buried beneath the music. I strain to hear it. The TV glitches again. The smiling man’s mouth moves, but the words don’t match.

The whispering grows. A voice. Not from the intercom. Not from the video. A real voice. Speaking my name.

“…Korynn.”

I freeze. The screen flickers violently. The music distorts. The man’s face warps. And the voice—The voice is right behind me.
