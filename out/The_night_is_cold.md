I am writing this shacking so please forgive me for any grammatical errors. I don’t think I have ever felt fear this intense for a long long time. 

I am currently in a small farm house in styria Austria. I doubt many of you have been here given the stories I usually read but maybe some of you have. It’s a beautiful place really. Mainly green hills plastered with farms. The people are nice and there’s nothing around except for animals and cats. I loved this place because I have visited it ever since I had been a kid. My grandparents own this farm house that is basically just a cottage. It sits right next to a real farm that houses mainly cows. We are friends with the farmers there and we routinely invite them over and when me and my brother were kids we used to play with their kids or with the animals. 

Now what you have to understand is that this house is old. Old enough to make eerie creaking noises every now and then. This never really freaked me out but it would get louder every now and then. A week ago me and my mother came up here to spend a while in nature and recharge ourselves. She got the room upstairs and I chose the room downstairs. I could’ve stayed up there but I liked the children’s room. It was big and dark but it reminded me of the fun times me and my brother used to have when we were kids. 

Anyway me and my mother were playing cards but I got tired and decided to go to bed. I laid down in those old rickety beds and closed my eyes. I couldn’t sleep however. How much I tossed and turned I couldn’t fall asleep. I felt watched. Then I heard it. A whisper. 

“Hey.”

You have to imagine that it sounded like a child that was trying to get my attention without alerting anyone else. My eyes flicked open immediately and I scanned the room. 

“Over here.” 

Again eerily quiet but eerily close at the same time. It was sort of muffled so it must’ve come from outside. I looked over to the window and still saw nothing. I grabbed a flashlight and peered through the window outside were boot prints. In the mud. I didn’t recognize the make but it looked like the size of a fully grown man and not a child. 

“Outside.” 

The whisper felt like it was right into my ear. It was so close but so silent that it made my skin crawl. My nerves were set on fire. Outside where? Outside the window or outside in the hall? I walked over to the door and glanced down the dark hallway. Still nothing. A headache began in the back of my head but I wouldn’t sleep until this was resolved. 

The hallway is long and along the left side of it are windows. This time however the windows weren’t empty. There was something obscuring them. It seemed to be some sort of mud or liquid. It was red. In a child’s handwriting each window had a word written on it. 

The. 

Night. 

Is. 

Cold. 

I was confused. Was there a crazy person outside? Was someone fucking with me? My head began to hurt even more and that made me angry. I decided to call the police even though I knew it was a fruitless effort. They would take ages to get up here and by then whoever was harassing us might’ve already disappeared. I walked down the hallway and looked for my phone that I had left in the kitchen. Across from the kitchen was the main room where my mother was still playing. I could hear the flipping of cards in there. I called the police but I was interrupted by another whisper. 

“Not here.”

This voice was starting to really piss me off. I didn’t know what it wanted and I wanted it to go away. My head was pounding and I wanted to go to bed and have this resolved. My phone kept ringing and I couldn’t get through. I started to talk to myself to calm myself down. Yk stuff like calm down and this is all just in your head. But I was interrupted once more. 

“Not in your head but in front of you.”

This time I didn’t get angry. I looked up. There was nothing there but the entrance to the main room. My mom hadn’t stopped flipping the cards yet. No she was still going. But it was too rhythmic. 

Flip. Flip. Flip. Flip. 

It didn’t really sound like cards. It sounded more like water dripping maybe? At this point I felt like my head was splitting apart. I continued on and thought maybe the voice was trying to get me to talk to my mom? Maybe to get some pain medication? Maybe to go to the doctor?

I stumbled forward and grasped at the door. I managed to open it and what greeted me was a waft of sticky warm air. The flipping was in fact the sound of liquid dripping. It just wasn’t water. The liquid ran from the table. It soaked the cards from the deep wound that had been torn in my mother’s neck. Her eyes looked at me. There was absolutely nothing behind them. I had never in my life seen such an expressionless face. I stumbled backwards as my headache and shock overtook me. 

I woke up in a police station. Apparently our neighbors had checked on us and found my mother dead and me passed out on the floor. I was suspected but I tried to tell them that it must’ve been whoever was whispering to me. I’m currently in some sort of interrogation room? The two thoughts that keep spinning around my head are why whoever had murdered my mom directed me to her. Was this some sort of sick game? The other thought is the last thing I saw before everything went black. I fell and hit my head hard but before that I saw the door. The door that led outside. And right next to the door were my boots. Covered in fresh mud.
