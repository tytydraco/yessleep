My name is Tracey Butser . I found a [cult](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/yVOBEypLn6) who worship creepy supernatural beings and got saved by an organization fighting against those creatures.


After an hour , The vehicle finally stopped. I quickly hid the book I found in my overcoat before an armed man escorted me and Jason out of the vehicle.


We entered a modern looking building and they took us to an elevator, The elevator kept going down for what seemed like forever.


Once we reached the floor we need to be on , They took us to a room and asked us to wait.


"This place is pretty cool , isn't it?" Jason said to me


I didn't respond


"Is everything ok?" He asked


Something about this organisation is really off. Unnatural Detainment Association....Why do they detain those creatures rather than eliminate them? If their goal is to protect the public then detaining them doesn't seem to be the best idea.


"Nothing" I replied 


He won't get it, There's no point asking him.


Then 2 women came into the room and escorted us into seperate rooms. They questioned me about what happened. I told them everything about Britney , the cult , Ray's death but didn't mention the book. 


Once we were done, They handed us a book.


"This is the manual with all the rules broadcasted until now, You can also use the website to get broadcast of new rules" the women told us.


Then we were let go. I went to my home trying to figure out what's going on. I read the book they gave me , It had rules and Unnatural sightings.


When I was done reading that , I started reading the UNF rituals book. There were many rituals in there but one that caught my eye was "ritual to form a pact with an Unnatural" 


I read the book but didn't realise how late it had gotten, I was about to get ready to sleep but then I noticed something. There was a silhouette behind my mailbox.


I took the biggest knife I had in my kitchen and went out, There was nobody there. I opened my mailbox and there it was.


[A black letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/s/D2BjZhq4wT)


Suddenly my surroundings turned red, I looked at the ground and ran back inside my home. That is when I regretted putting a mirror behind my front door.


The black creature started emerging from the mirror , I tried to stab it but the knife flew out of my hand and hit one of the stairs behind me.


I then punched the mirror to break it , It broke. The thing was no longer there. But my fist got injured and blood was dripping. From the blood emerged the creature with 6 arms and 3 bloodshot eyes.


I tried to run upstairs but it grabbed my left arm , I managed to grab the knife by my right hand. That's when I suddenly remembered the ritual.


"A fresh meat offering huh" I mumbled


I then cut my left arm off using the knife and said "Custodi me et esto mihi custos. Hic contractus manebit donec unus ex nobis pereat".


Then I started losing consciousness, Possibly due to the blood loss. The last thing I saw was the creature eating my arm before passing out.


When I woke up the next day, Everything was a mess. It was not a dream and I knew it. Something felt different about me , Something...... That's when I noticed the blood red symbols on my left arm which was still attached to my body. 


I was processing what happened when 2 armed men walked into my home. They started shooting at me , but.....the bullets were slow..... slow as a ball being thrown by a toddler.


I dodged them and then I lost consciousness again , Next thing I knew was that the two were dead.


There were more of them outside my front door , So I took the ritual book and escaped from the back door.


I don't know what happened to me but there's only one thing I can do


**RUN**
