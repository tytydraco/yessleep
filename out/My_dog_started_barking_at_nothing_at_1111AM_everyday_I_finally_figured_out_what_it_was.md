 

Recently, my dog has been barking at nothing. Usually, we pet owners would find this behavior normal as our furry little friends tend to have a keen sense for small changes in the environment. It wasn’t uncommon to find Boo jumping at a bird or squirrel running by the window outside. Although he was a quiet little boy, he always took the chance to alert me of critters, the occasional revving motorcycle or a leaf flying quickly off of a tree during the fall. Its his favorite season. I always praised him with enthusiasm for his attentiveness.

This barking was different. For the first time in over 9 years, Boo sounded angry. 

My 14 pound, elderly shih tzu was usually mild-mannered and polite. I even came up with a theory for his gentlemanly personality: he was a 17th century archeologist and renowned scholar that found an ancient relic, pissed off some tricky spirit, and was cursed to spend eternity in a dog’s body.

You could always see a hint of humanity and understanding in his eyes; one of them going bad from age and a tussle with another neighborhood pet years before.

His regular routine included a morning walk, where he extended his time sniffing anything he could reach. Then he had breakfast that he horfed down, beating his record time from the day before. The rest of the day, he would nap, never failing to break the silence with his pig-like snoring. He would also make time to quietly window watch and look for something to yell at. As an elderly dog, Boo reserved enough energy to leave his post throughout the day and sniff the shoes left out, check to see if I had any treats laying around for him, and dig into dirty bathroom tissues if the waste bin was full that day. Boo followed this schedule for years after he grew out of running around and destroying chew toys.

One Spring afternoon, he was planted by the open front door, as he did everyday, waiting for something to happen. I was preparing his lunch when I heard the unfamiliar tone of his bark. I rushed over to praise him as I always do when he finds something but instead of turning to receive a belly rub, his eyes stayed fixed on the screen door. Boo continued to bark incessantly. His ears were flat against his head as he bared his small teeth and released a low snarl followed by more aggressive barking.

I immediately walked out the screen door and looked around the front yard to find nothing out of place. 

“What is it, Boobear?” I asked, concerned.

He just cocked his head at me with some frustration, but relieved that what he saw left. I may have chased away a fox or another animal bigger than him. We saw a lot of animals bigger than him, after all. Boo could easily fit into a tote bag and still have plenty of leg room.

The little dog calmed down once I returned inside and kept close to me the rest of the day.

As the weeks went by, Boo would start up again at nothing. After his incessant barking became a daily event, I soon realized it started at exactly 11:11AM. By 11:15AM, Boo would calm down and go back to attending his dogly duties.

I began to study Boo more closely after this realization. Every day at 11:11AM, he would bark at something outside with the same defensive stance and anger in his voice. I sat with him one day to see if there was an animal or person following a routine that involved passing our home at the same time.

11AM rolled around and Boo was planted in his regular seat in front of the screen door. I planted myself adjacent and stroked his tangled, long fur as we waited. 11 minutes later, he stood on all fours and resumed the stance, barking and snarling at the same spot in the front yard. I didn’t see anything move outside nor did I feel a temperature change or chill as you would expect if something paranormal passed by. Boo continued his barking until 11:15AM, just as expected.

“Boobear, are you okay?” Scared for my sweet boy, I held him close.

He nuzzled into my chest for a moment and promptly ran to the kitchen for lunch time.

Summer came around and it was time for Boo’s seasonal haircut and wellness check. The daily barking didn’t stop but the little dog was always ready to fight off whatever he saw.

During his morning vet visit, the doctor alerted me of something stuck on the right side of his upper gums. The stubborn dog didn’t let any of us fully see the inside of his mouth but as he was pretty lively, the doctor scheduled another time to take a closer look. They said it might require a full dental cleaning or surgery since they couldn’t quite see what was going on in there.

Although we were in a closed room with no windows, Boo began his barking again. Not at me or the doctor, but at the corner of the office.

“He probably knows we want to dig around in there, haha!”, the doctor joked.

I laughed nervously and checked my watch. 

11:11AM.

“Yeah, haha. I wonder if he’s hiding something! What’s going on, Boobear?” I reached for the little guy and tried to get him to calm down.

At 11:15AM, he finally stopped and went back to his polite self.

——————-

I spent the next few months saving money to get him a proper dental cleaning or worse yet, oral surgery. Vet bills are not cheap.

After so much time putting myself through crazy work hours along with university classes, I accidentally strayed from our routine. I slept through our morning.

I woke up to see Boo standing at the foot of our bed whining. He’s probably upset about his breakfast being late. I propped myself up to see my little fur baby in his defensive stance staring at the dark corner of my bedroom.

“Good morning, Boo! Let’s go pee pee outside!”. I was about to remove the covers and hop off the mattress when my dog ran towards me and nudged me back under the blanket.

Confused, I sat up again as Boo worked his hardest to pin my chest down with his fluffy butt. I picked up the boy and set him on my shoulder to look at what he was whining at. I was surprised to feel that he was a lot lighter than usual. Still, I moved my head past his small body to see the corner.

The dark corner stared back. I saw nothing. Heard nothing. Felt absolutely nothing.

The static air held my breath as I sat there paralyzed for what felt like hours. It was like the wires in my brain just burnt out. My mind completely blanked. 

Finally, an overwhelming sadness washed over me and I began to burst into tears. As I cried, I felt the warmth of my sweet boy licking my face. I calmed down and didn’t bother checking the time.

Autumn arrived and I finally saved enough for Boo’s vet appointment.

We were finally going to figure out what he was hiding in that mouth.

I took extra time to save up for any surprise tooth extractions he might need or a more thorough dental cleaning. I was not at all prepared for the outcome.

The vet said we needed to run more tests. His gums were in disarray and some teeth were loose enough to fall out all on their own.

I was to stop giving him dental chews or treats and start giving him painkillers and antibiotics.

“It’s gonna be okay, Boo”, I said trying to maintain my composure on the ride home.

As the medicine kept him mildly sedated, the daily barking slowly ceased. Boo strayed more and more from his regular routine everyday, replacing most activities with sleeping. At 11:11AM, he still visited the open front door. 

He didn’t bark at the door anymore, rather, he greeted whatever he saw everyday with a relaxed wagging of the tail and sniff at the screen.

Boo’s condition got worse shortly after I got the call.

The doctors ran the tests. He was diagnosed with a very aggressive cancer. I couldn’t catch the name of it as they immediately jumped to oncology referrals and next steps of care.

I looked over at my sweet boy. As he met my gaze, the nothingness of the dark corner of my bedroom seeped back into my mind. I blanked. 

The stillness was broken by warm fur brushing against my ankle.

It was time for his lunch.

A few more weeks went by and I spent as much time as possible with my sick sweet boy.

I think we both knew his time was coming soon.

We ate our favorite foods, revisited our favorite places to watch the leaves fall, and slept in, breaking our routine. Who the fuck cares what time it is or what’s waiting outside?

Then, all Boo wanted to do was sleep. The dreaded day finally arrived.

The vet and her assistant gently walked me through the process.

“I think you’re making the right choice. I would do the same for my pet and I know he was so lucky to have you”, the vet whispered.

They gave me as much time as I needed to say goodbye.

I kissed him and thanked him for offering me every ounce of happiness he could give. I hoped he knew how lucky I felt to have him.

The vet returned to put my sweet boy to sleep. After a quick injection, she read her watch, “Time of death, 11:15AM. He’s gone”.

They gave me more time afterwards. He looked so peaceful in his sleeping position. I gave him one last kiss.

It’s currently a few days later and I haven’t been sleeping well. All I do is scroll through our old pictures together. I keep thinking of what I could have done to prevent his illness or catch it sooner. I think about all the times we missed out on. Places I could have shown him. Days I could have dedicated just to him when he could truly enjoy it. I'm writing this now hoping he'll see it. Or that it'll immortalize him. Maybe they gain the use of the Internet in dog heaven.

In a restless fit, I sit up from staring endlessly at a phone screen, and find myself drawn to the dark corner of my bedroom again. I wipe away snot and tears from my face. I try looking deeper. Trying to figure out what he saw that I couldn’t.

Now, I feel it.

Warmth. All over my body.

Something just nudged at my chest to get back under the covers.

My sweet boy.

Thank you, Boobear. Rest well.
