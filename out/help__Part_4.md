Hey, 

So you know how in my last entry I was somewhat calm, needless to say I had gotten somewhat used to the idea of *them* being on my front stoop. Well, I think that level of desensitization has dissipated because, Something happened, and I know most of my entries here start with some version of “something happened” but SOMETHING HAPPENED. I got a doorbell camera for one. 

Long story short;  *they* don't like to be filmed! In fact *they* fucking hate it! To make a long story long I hung the camera on my door. It opens inward so I didn't have to step outside to put it up. As soon as I opened it *they* started with what has become their typical spiel. 

“Can you let us in?” 

“Nope”

“You have to let us in” 

“No I do not”

“Why do you not let us in?”

“Let me think, oh yeah, because, you're fucking creepy“

“We need to phone our mother”  
 “Yeah,I think you've exhausted the mom lie by now”

“Let us in”

“You've been here two months try a different fucking house!” I slammed the door at that point. As soon as I did the knocking started again the drumming felt as though it was on the back of my skull. I stayed near the door.  In all honesty I haven't (for the most part ) left my doorway since last entry winnie is planted there and I don't want her to be alone. I don't want to be alone. All that is to say I was next to the door when it happened so I heard the knocking fade as it was usurped by a

The sound of the camera breaking, crushing plastic and breaking screws. It lasted a long time. Then the knocking resumed as if it hadn't happened. All I could do was sit there and listen. My heart started going fast pounding out of my chest as if it had become synchronized to the pounding at the door. 

I gave it a day before I checked to see the damage and as expected the camera was completely destroyed. bits of plastic, glass, and wire a strew across my front stoop. 

“Can we come in?” *they* asked again and again and again as I just stared at the mess. And then I shut it again. Sense then the knocking has not stopped, the lulls of the last few weeks are gone. 

All I can do is sit here and listen to this endless thunder.

I need to leave. 

I need to leave *tonight*. I can't take it anymore. I can't live like this anymore. I need to leave. Everyday I feel weaker and more tired. I feel as though I'm dying, I sound dramatic but I swear *they’re* taking my life from me. It's hard to explain but If I don't leave soon I know, one day, I won't be able to. I'm leaving tonight. I don't know what *they’ll* do when I step outside.  I guess I'll find out.

I’ll keep you updated.
