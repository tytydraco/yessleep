I needed a job—badly. So when an office assistant position opened up at a company I’d never heard of, I jumped on it. The interview was weird. No talk of salary, benefits, or even job duties. Just a single sheet of paper slid across the desk with a list of ten rules.

“Follow these exactly,” the interviewer, a pale man in a gray suit, said. “You’ll do just fine.”

I should have walked out. But desperation makes you ignore red flags.

  
**RULES FOR EMPLOYMENT:**

1. Arrive at 8:00 AM sharp. No earlier, no later.
2. Do not acknowledge the man in the janitor’s closet.
3. If the phone rings at exactly 12:15 PM, do not answer it.
4. Always leave before 6:00 PM.
5. If you hear typing from the empty cubicle, ignore it.
6. The coffee in the breakroom is not for you.
7. Never take the elevator alone.
8. If you see your own reflection smile at you, look away immediately.
9. The emergency exit is for emergencies only. Real emergencies.
10. Never, under any circumstances, break a rule.

I should have run. But the salary was listed at an obscene number. Enough to dig me out of debt and start over. I signed the contract.

For the first few days, nothing happened. I did mindless paperwork, ignored the janitor’s closet, and pretended not to hear the occasional burst of typing from an empty desk. My coworkers were polite but distant. No one talked about the rules. No one asked questions.

By the end of my first week, I was starting to feel safe. Maybe it was all a stupid hazing ritual. A test of obedience.

Then I broke a rule.

It was an accident. I stayed late one night, caught up in a mountain of files. When I finally glanced at the clock, it was 6:17 PM.

My stomach dropped.

The office was silent. Too silent. The kind of silence that presses in on your ears. I grabbed my bag and walked quickly to the exit, my footsteps suddenly too loud. I told myself it was fine. The building hadn’t exploded. No alarms had gone off.

Then I heard it.

Click.

A single keystroke in the darkness. Then another. And another. A steady rhythm of typing coming from the empty cubicle across the room. My skin prickled. The typing stopped. I held my breath. Something shifted in the darkness. A chair creaked. Then, the whisper.

“Six.”

A cold breath of air brushed against my ear, though no one was there. I ran. The next morning, the rule sheet on my desk had changed. A new rule had appeared at the bottom, typed in the same crisp font as the rest:

**11. You have six days.**

I asked my coworkers about it. They wouldn’t meet my eyes. One finally muttered, “Don’t break any more rules.” I did everything perfectly that day. I arrived at exactly 8:00 AM. I ignored the janitor’s closet, the phantom typing, the too-warm coffee. But at 12:15 PM, the phone on my desk rang.

I stared at it. I wasn’t supposed to answer. But now I had six days to… what? To live? To work here? I needed answers. I picked up. Static hissed on the other end. Then a voice, warped and distant:

“Five.”

Click.

The rules are changing. Each morning, my countdown updates. **Four days.** **Three.**

I’ve been careful. I follow every rule. But last night, as I left the office at exactly 5:59 PM, I caught my reflection in the glass doors. It smiled. I looked away immediately, heart hammering. But in that brief moment, I saw something move behind me in the reflection. Something tall. Something wrong.

**Two days.**

I don’t know what happens when the countdown reaches zero. No one will tell me. I just know I don’t want to be here to find out. 

Tomorrow, I’m breaking Rule #9. I’m taking the emergency exit.

If I don’t post again… don’t take this job.
