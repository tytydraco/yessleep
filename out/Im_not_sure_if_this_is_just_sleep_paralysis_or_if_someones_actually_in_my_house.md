My name is Phil, and this is already the second time this week I’ve delivered the wrong order, okay, fine, it’s actually three wrong orders, and it’s only Tuesday. But you have to understand: I’m a physicist, not a barista, so it’s not like I know everything about coffee. Sure, after nearly a month doing the same thing, I *should* be at least slightly less terrible at making a simple espresso, but this job is terrifying in itself.

*Would you like ice, sir? Whole milk or soy, ma’am? Cash or card?*

And on top of that, I’m expected to be cheerful while going through a slow and excruciating six-hour torture session every day. Okay, maybe I should be more grateful to have landed a job so quickly after being kicked out of a prestigious position at Michigan State University.

For five long years, I devoted a good part of my life to the aspiring theoretical physicists of Michigan. Even though the university was about an hour’s drive from my home, it was still what I truly loved doing until I got fired for being late.

And don’t think it was just once or twice, three whole weeks without even showing up at the university. I still don’t understand how they managed to manipulate the system and log that many absences when I was, in fact, still going to work.

**That’s why I’m only writing this now.**

Patrícia (my wife) and I don’t really have the ritual of always going to bed at the same time. She’s also a teacher, but she works with preschoolers. And I must say, she’s the best. When she’s not at school, she’s researching more playful and pedagogical ways to engage her students. Many times, she takes a while to go to bed because she gets so immersed in a project that she won’t close her laptop until it’s done. At the beginning of the month, I had a dream I thought I’d forgotten the moment I woke up. It started with me or at least I assumed it was me, since I didn’t actually see my facein our living room on an afternoon when I clearly should’ve been at the university.

Then I walk toward the kitchen, which is separated from the living room only by the countertop my wife’s pride and joy, her open-concept kitchen. I go to the sink, grab a glass, fill it with water, and turn back toward the living room but this time I turn to the stairs that sit between the two rooms. I start walking up, and then the dream ends.

I don’t remember if I had another dream after that, or if I just kept sleeping without dreaming at all. Like I said, it was a pretty forgettable and ordinary dream. What made me remember it was the next night another dream, the same setting. I’m standing in the living room, facing the stairs, the front door behind me. I walk to the kitchen, grab a glass, water, and then head upstairs.

This time, I make it to the top but instead of finding the hallway with four doors, I see the stairs again. The living room to my right, the kitchen to my left. But in the kitchen

In the kitchen, there’s a tall Black man standing with his back to me. He turns around, and I see - **it’s me**. It’s me, walking toward the stairs and going up. I start to follow him, climbing the stairs behind him. But then he stops and starts to turn his head, slowly, until his eyes meet mine. And I wake up with a jolt. You know that feeling when you’re dreaming that you’re falling into a hole and you suddenly jump awake? Or when you're falling and your legs kick forward on their own? It was exactly like that. Except when I woke up, I *felt* something grab my ankle. I opened my eyes to see the silhouette of my wife in front of me, holding my leg.

  
**- What is it, sweetheart? A nightmare?**  
Patrícia asked, her hand resting gently on my leg.

**- No, I think I just got startled when you touched me**  
I replied with a shy laugh.

**- Well, I just got here. You were already awake, sitting there in the dark.**

**- Really? It felt like I’d just woken up.-**

**- When I came to talk to you and finally saw your face, you gasped and looked at me strangely. It must’ve been a nightmare, my love. I’m going to the bathroom, and then I’ll come to bed.**  
she said, giving me a gentle kiss on the forehead.

  
Honestly, I didn’t take it very seriously at first. I thought I was just too sleepy to remember what Patrícia had told me and ignored it. Then, later that same week, I had the exact same dream again no changes, just the same damn glass of water in my hand, climbing the stairs. The dream felt so real I could feel the cold wood of the steps beneath my feet. Maybe I was wrong to say “no changes.” Technically, nothing *did* change, but hear me out, you’ll understand.

There I was, climbing the cold stairs with the glass in my hand, my eyes fixed, alternating between the glass and the stairs ahead, careful not to spill a single drop or trip. Then I felt a presence. You know that feeling when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and you’re certain there’s something lurking in the dark corner of the hallway? Even though you tell yourself there’s nothing there, you still hurry back to your room and lock the door? That tightness in your chest, that chill at the back of your neck—that’s exactly what I felt. Only this time, I could feel the stairs slowly tilting downward beneath my weight and the weight behind me.

I thought about just keeping on and ignoring it, but before I knew it, I was turning my head and body backward to find out what was following me up the stairs.

And that’s it. the dream ends, and I don’t know what I saw next. Maybe I had another dream afterward, but I really can’t remember. Like I said, it was pretty forgettable, if not for the recurring details. After all, who dreams and then continues the same dream the next day?

I haven’t even gotten to the reason why I’m writing this. It wasn’t the dream that scared me, nor was it a nightmare. The truth is, after that day, I never had that dream again, only a string of strange days and unexplained dreams.

But what made me come to you and ask for help was what happened last night.

I had just woken up, but it was already night again. A faint, bluish light filtered through the crack in the curtain, from the window to my right. I imagine it was from a street lamp or the moon. I could be more certain if I could at least turn over, but all I could see was my slightly dirty ceiling and some cobwebs in the left corner.

**- Honey? \_** I whisper, glancing at my wife, who’s breathing heavily in a deep sleep beside me.

By now, the most sensible thing would be to try to fall back asleep. But before I can finish that thought, I hear the creak of the bedroom door in front of me. A chill runs through my body as I imagine a burglar stepping into the room while I’m unable to move, possibly attacking my beautiful wife as I watch helplessly, like some cruel joke. Then I realize my arms are raised, stretched out, and my legs slightly apart, also stretched. I manage to move my head down and see, through the open bedroom door, the bathroom light on at the other end of the hallway. Patrícia is brushing her teeth, wearing a pink floral pajama and her hair tied up in a lazy bun.

I could finally breathe a sigh of relief, if it weren’t for the deep breathing of my wife sleeping beside me. I slowly turn my face, and there she is, in her pink floral pajamas, a red curl falling across her face, now turned toward me. Almost like a whisper, I feel a weight pressing down on me. She’s on top of me, holding my arms, her knees pressing against my legs. Her face, which just minutes ago was the most beautiful I’d ever seen, now stared back at me with ridiculously huge, wide-open eyes, and an unnaturally open mouth almost as if she could swallow my entire head if she tried. The more I stared, the wider her mouth opened, and her head tilted back as her jaw adjusted to the size of my skull. I tried to scream. I tried to move. A terror rose up my throat and my body burned with heat. When I finally thought I might be able to move, it was already morning, and Patrícia was no longer by my side. I looked at the clock.

it was 4 PM.

Was it a dream? How the hell did I manage to sleep until the afternoon? Patrícia leaves before me; she couldn’t have woken me up. By now, I had already missed all my classes for the day, so I just packed my things for the next day. 

So the next day, I went to the university for another day of classes, just to face those semi-drunk young faces at 7 AM, apparently, there had been a party the night before. I started the roll call as usual, while rummaging through my bag for the folder with that day’s tests, my eyes shifting between the attendance sheet with all 21 names, my classroom with a little over 15 students, and my seemingly bottomless bag where I couldn’t find that damn folder. At one point, I thought I had left it at home, but finally, I found it and could continue with the roll call.

\- Philipe Martin, *I think I put my name in the wrong spot\_*

**- Here!**  
A young man who looked just like me, sitting in the second desk of the front row, raised his hand.

I could have sworn I was looking at myself sitting right in front of me when he decided to stand up and walk toward me.

**- I think you should pay more attention to who you let into your house,**  
the other Phil said.

And once again, I was staring at the same slightly dirty ceiling with cobwebs. But this time, my wife wasn’t beside me, and I could hear someone climbing the stairs. The bedroom door was already open, and the bathroom light was the only source of illumination spilling into the room. Maybe I would have preferred total darkness, because all I could see was a tall, dark silhouette coming down the stairs, backlit by the light. The figure finally stopped, standing straight and still in the hallway. *Am I dreaming?* I thought as it slowly crouched down, tilting its head to the side like a dog trying to understand a command. Then it got down on all fours and started crawling toward me, lifting one limb after another like something out of an old cartoon. Each movement was accompanied by creaks, and it moved slowly, as if its joints were extremely stiff. Finally, it reached the edge of my bed, placed what looked like an arm on it, and slowly climbed up, bringing the other limbs after it. Cold sweat was beginning to form on my forehead.

*Alright, I’m a man of science, this can’t be really happening*, I told myself as I squeezed my eyes shut, only to open them again and come face to face with a humanoid face, its eyes wide open and mouth excruciatingly stretched, revealing absolute darkness inside that slimy, fetid hole. It let out a hoarse growl. My whole body tingled with numbness, and just when I thought I was about to pee myself, I heard the bedroom door slam shut and darkness engulf the room.

*This was the end.*

Terror shook every particle of my body, forcing me to scream in fear, until my wife turned on the light and rushed to my side, worried, asking what had happened.

*Thank God, she was here. It was all just a nightmare.*

Before I could regain my senses and finally feel my limbs again, she turned to me and said:

**- You should pay more attention to who you let into your house, Phil.** \_ As she opened a wide, exaggerated smile.

Now I’m awake, I think, sitting in the living room while I write this to you. It’s 4 PM and my wife still hasn’t come home. I’m waiting for her. I don’t remember if I went to the coffe yesterday, but today my shift is already over. Honestly, I don’t know what’s happening, but after some research, I saw it might be sleep paralysis , though I’m not sure. Can someone please help me?

**Update:** I’m posting this at 9 PM because I’m afraid to sleep again. My wife still hasn’t come home. Should I call the police?
