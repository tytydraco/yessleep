Deep in the rural South I grew up with my dad in a small brick house on a ten acre plot, inherited over generations like all of our relatives’ plots from one large swathe and a common ignominious ancestor. Plowed and harvested by parallel generations of slaves and sharecroppers. Sometimes I think I can feel their sorrow still. Like it’s been sown into the soil, watered by their blood and tears. And after decades, centuries, of neglect had grown into a malicious weed. Stretching out under the surface and attacking the roots of anything that lives here. 

As a child, though, I couldn’t grasp that. My mind never connected the dilapidated old shacks and withered fields that surrounded our land. Instead I thought it was cool. It was nice being able to stay at my grandparents next door or walk to an aunt’s house for dinner. I would play with my cousins in the woods-blonde-haired, barefoot kids running through fields playing tag and variations of hide and seek. Always hiding in pairs, none of us liked being alone in those woods. Especially around Uncle’s house. 

The land was split up into separate plots of woods and fields. Cut into grids by intersecting dirt roads. Houses were built and passed down to each subsequent generation. We were a little isolated, but with such a huge family of aunts uncles and cousins of all ages. I didn’t mind. Nothing grew on the land anymore, but that didn’t stop some of my family from trying. The rest of us would hunt and fish in the woods, the older generations teaching us youngins how to track deer, train dogs, and process and cook the game we harvested. 

Dad and I were no exception. He worked way too hard for too little pay. We were poor and most of the time whether or not we had meat with our meals depended on how successful our hunts were. We would hunt deer in the fall and winter, turkeys in the spring, but both of our favourite was coon hunting. 

For the uninitiated you hunt raccoons by taking a dog out at night. We’d bring our blue tick Po out once the moon was high in the sky and let him go at the edge of a wood line. Then we’d wait. Sitting in the woods at dark is lonely. Even with my dad there I could feel the oppressive presence of the dark around me, closing in on all sides like some cheesy 80s escape room. Closing in to crush my soul while the unseen creatures in the trees and bushes watched. Waiting to feed on my flesh the way I had been feeding on their brothers and cousins.

Then Po would howl and the chase was on. Sometimes it was close, and the howl would snap me back into reality. Echoing inside my head, bouncing off one eardrum to the other like some pinball bouncing inside my skull. More times than not though Po would have traveled miles through the woods. His voice barely audible over the frantic uneven chirping of crickets. A ghostly howl that I would sometimes convince myself I didn’t really hear. That my mind had conjured it to escape that darkness. Then Po would howl again and my dad wordlessly clicked his flashlight on and began to move deeper into the woods. 

We’d go for miles. Traipsing through the woods as fast as we could. We wanted Po to know we appreciated his hard work by getting there as quickly as possible. Plus the quality of the next days meal was at stake. Sprinting across creeks, water blacker than pitch hiding the deep pools the beaver dams made. At any point I could step into one of those spots. Sink down in the mud where i couldn’t pull myself free and choke on the swamp. Roots seemed to reach out like hands to pull me to the leaf litter. Their tendrils snaking through those decaying leaves; I knew they wanted to take me into their cold wet embrace. To decay with them. Keeping one eye on my father’s flashlight beam and one eye on the ground, I’d hop skip my way towards those ghostly howls. Like a procession following a church bell I’d wade forward through that forest. 

Once we found Po he’d be at the base of some tree. Howling his head off as he looked up into it. Sometimes trying to climb the tree to retrieve his quarry. He’d jump as high as he could and dig his claws into the trunk. Scraping bark and splinters off as he fell back to the ground. He loved it and I loved him for it. Dad’s light would shine up, searching branch to branch like a policeman’s spotlight. Looking for the masked bandit who’d be pressing his little body tight to the top of one of the limbs. If that light landed on him my dad would hand me the torch, and raise a small rifle to his shoulder. 

We did this a lot. Hunting over the hundreds of acres that our kin had split into subsections. Crossing creeks and rivers, hopping the small fences that marked each plot as separate from the last. Over the course of a few years we hunted it all, until one night that changed. 

We had let Po go on the edge of a distant uncle’s farmland. I don’t remember his name, there’s too many to keep track of and this one was rather unsocial. As we held Po at the edge of the tree line something seemed off. Usually he was pulling at the leash with anticipation. Jerking my dad’s arm back and forth as he smelled the earth with his instinctive urges. This time he was walking slowly behind dad. Looking back and forth to him and I almost questioningly. When dad took the leash off he walked towards the tree line, tail between his legs, and looked over his shoulder at us before heading in. 

“He seems sad?” I looked to my dad hoping for some context for Po’s behaviour. 
“He’s just tired, it is the third night this week.  Don’t worry once he strikes a trail he’ll be back to himself.” 

Minutes turned to hours and we both fell into that silence the night beckons for. Listening to frog songs I sat in the grass looking for four leaf clovers to hide my fear from Dad. When I stole a glance at him he looked resolute. Standing still and peering into the woods the way a man looks into a fire before telling a ghost story. Only shifting his gaze to spit out a long stream of the tobacco juice he was constantly chewing. I followed his gaze to see what he was staring at. But it was just the woods staring back. 

Then like a wind moving through the willows we heard Po. His long wailing cry barely audible through the rustling leaves, he was far off. I thought my mind was playing a trick on me at first, but one glance at dad let me know he heard it too. 

“He’s got the trail, but he’s moving away from us. Get in the truck we’ve gotta move before we lose the sound.” Pa said this as if it didn’t matter if we lost him. But that scared me worse than anything. I didn’t want to lose Po. He may not have been man’s best friend, but he was definitely the boys. I hurriedly climbed into the passenger seat of my dad’s beat up truck. A gasp escaped me as a pair of yellow eyes stared unblinking through the windshield. I jumped and hit my head on the roof as dad turned the ignition over and the high beams cut into the night. A small doe was standing there but surprisingly she didn’t run. She continued to stare all too knowingly at me before turning its head and walking into the dark. 

Off we went. Tearing through the now harvested field and down one of the dirt roads that cut the plots into grid patterns. The trees seemed to lean over the road, their branches clawing at the sides of the truck and scraping the windows like nails trying to drag us back. Dad drove a while then stopped and cut the engine off. Sticking his head out the window he listened. Silence. 

“Shit” he cranked it back up and turned us around. Slinging gravel into the undergrowth he took a right hander a little to fast as the back wheel dipped off the road into the ditch. Revving the engine trying to get it to come loose again he turned to me and without emotion mumbled “stuck”. 

We jumped out. The truck was  stuck. Spinning the tire had sunk it deeper and the axle was grounded. Then I heard it. Po’s howl cut through the night air-desperate and pleading. He was close and I hopped across the ditch something grabbed me from behind. A strong grip grasped the back of my shirt and pulled hard as I fell to my back. My eyes closed shut for a moment as i struggled to regain my wind. The grass seemed to curl around my wrists and ankles like manacles holding me down. When I pried my eyes open Dad was above me. His head silhouetted by the moon behind. I couldn’t see the fear in his eyes, but as I started to protest he put a trembling finger up to his mouth. Then over the sound of his ragged breathing, I heard it too. 

Po was still there. Bellowing his deep voice to us through the pines and oaks. Letting it be known where he was and that he needed our help. But there was something else. Almost harmonising with him was a second voice. A deeper, raspier howl from a dog I’d never heard. The two dogs howled together, echoing through the trees like two opera singers in a concert hall. Then the raspier voice slowly began to overpower Pos. Like he was making way for this new talent to delve into a compelling solo. His voice rang ghostly and beautiful through the trees, a tone of despair and unrequited love. It beckoned me deeper into the woods but Dad was still squatting over me a shaky hand on my chest preventing me from moving. Then as the voice crescendoed at the peak of it’s performance. Silence.
