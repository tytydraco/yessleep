**MISSING PERSONS: Byron Lu and Jessica Polchuk (LAST SEEN March 20th, 2023)**

My cousin, Byron, is missing. He was an avid birder. A couple years ago, he fell in love with another person as enthusiastic about birds as him, Jessica (aka Jess). He thought he was the luckiest guy in the world and was planning on asking her to marry him. Jess is missing as well. 

I think I know what happened to them. I need you to read this so that someone believes me.

Byron and Jess had gone hiking by Stony Lake. The last confirmed sighting of them was on the morning of March 20th. We know this because after people in the area saw photos of Byron and Jess on missing posters, a couple of campers came forward saying they remembered crossing paths with them at the entrance to the trailhead that morning, sometime around 8:30am. 

They remembered them specifically because Jess had handed them her phone (they remembered it had a bright case with a yellow canary on it) and had asked if they could take a photo of her and Byron at the start of their hike. They said they both looked very happy.

“A perfect couple”, they described Byron and Jess as. 

We first knew something was wrong when Byron and Jess didn’t show up at our Nan’s birthday party on March 22nd. Nan was turning 99. When Byron and Jess were late arriving, everyone thought it was strange. But everyone really became worried when the party was finished and they still hadn’t shown up. There was no way Byron would miss Nan’s party, especially without telling anyone why. Messages between family and friends, that quickly became more frantic, revealed that no one had heard from either Byron or Jess since before they had left for their hiking trip. 

Search & Rescue immediately went looking for them around Stony Lake, but they could find no trace of them. Our family decided to all go out and help in the search effort. We were to follow the strict instruction of the professionals, methodically searching a gradient stretching out from where Byron and Jess were last seen. 

I drove hours to get there. I took my dog, Titania with me. She’s an Alaskan Malamute, and I always feel more comfortable when she’s with me. I was, frankly, quite scared about what we were going to find in those woods.

When I reached the trailhead, my heart was heavy with anticipation. There was a flicker of hope alight in me too, but I made sure to keep it contained because I wanted to approach the situation practically and rationally. I’ve always prided myself at being able to keep my head, especially in stressful situations. 

I knew we probably weren’t going to be able to rescue Bryon and Jess. I knew it was very likely that something terrible happened to them. 

Something at the trailhead caught my eye that made my heart sink. On the board that held the trail map, was the missing poster of Bryon and Jess (both smiling, both happy) . But what deeply unsettled me was the poster beside it. 

It was worn and laminated, held to the board with rusty old tacks. On it, there was black and white photo of a smiling young woman with dark hair and freckles. Beneath was written: 

*LOTTIE JAMES - STILL MISSING, NOT FORGOTTEN - Last seen hiking JULY 12th 1971.* 

*1971.* That was too long ago to be related to Byron and Jess’ disappearance, I thought. But the knowledge that a person went missing in these woods and was never found filled my heart with dread. 

I had been afraid of what we would find. *But what if we found nothing?*

I'm the type of person who needs answers. I knew I couldn't rest if we didn't find them. 

The day Bryon and Jess were last seen was a bright and sunny day. The day of our search was cold, rainy, and miserable. But we didn’t let that stop us. We plunged into the woods. 

It was hours before I found anything. My feet were soggy and my hands were freezing. Every branch and fern I looked at in front of me started to look the same. I was going through constant waves of distress, boredom, hope and exhaustion. 

Without Titania with me, I never would’ve found it.

I was keeping my slow and steady pace forward through the woods when suddenly, Titania pulled hard at her leash. It surprised me so much, because she had stayed faithfully by my side all day. She pulled so hard I dropped the leash. Titania ran off. 

I followed her, calling her name, but she didn’t come back to me. It was very unlike her. I saw Titania stop ahead, but still, she wouldn’t come back to me. She made me come to her. 

It was then I realized she must’ve found something. My heart started pounding.

When I reached Titania, I scanned the woods around me. We were still in sightline of the other searchers. They were waiting for me to return. 

My eyes searched for sight of clothing or hiking equipment. But I couldn’t see anything. Only trees, branches, rocks, ferns… everything I’d been seeing all day. Then my eyes caught a glint by a log. A cell phone! I dropped onto my knees to pick it up. The phone had a plain black case. *So it wasn’t Jess’. But maybe it was Byron’s.*

The battery was dead. I ran back to the search party to show them what I had found. I showed them where I had found it then ran back to my car with Titania to charge the phone. I had to plug it in to see if it was Byron's. 

When the phone turned on, I saw the photo on the lock screen and knew immediately that it was my cousin's phone. The photo was of an owl. I remembered him showing me that same photo last Christmas. He was beaming with excitement when he showed it to me; apparently it was super rare to be able to get a photo of one in the day. I also remembered the numbered passcode he tapped into his phone so he could show me the other photos he had taken of the owl. I swear I wasn’t meaning to look, but I saw it - and I have an excellent memory. 

I tapped in the code immediately and the phone was unlocked. 

I opened his photo album, hoping something there could give us a clue to what happened. The last thing in it was a video from March 20th. I pressed play. 

I’ll describe the video exactly with every detail I remember. It’s the best I can do without showing you the actual video, which is something I am unable to do. When I showed the video to Search & Rescue, they called the police. The police then came to the scene and confiscated the phone. They said it was needed for their investigation, so I handed it over willingly. 

I haven’t been able to get it back. When I ask about it, I’m told that there were no videos found on the phone. 

# The following is what I saw when I played Byron’s video:

The first thing was a blur of wilderness as the shaky camera scanned the forest.

Then I could hear a voice off screen:

*Holy crap, holy crap! Do you see that?*

I knew that voice. That was Byron. He was clearly the one shooting the video. 

Byron's voice: *Look! Right there!*

His video moved over the trees. 

Byron's voice: *It’s a red-shouldered hawk! Right there, in that tree!*

His camera frame landed on a tree - and zoomed in.

Then a female voice, off screen: 

*Really!? Where? Are you kidding? You’re kidding, right?!*

That was Jess. 

Byron’s video frantically scanned a branch. 

His voice: *Right there! It was right there, on that branch. Damn, damnit, it’s gone. Did you see it?*

Jess’s voice: *You’re lying. You didn’t see one.* 

Byron’s voice: *I did, I swear! It was a red-shouldered hawk, and it was right there! I just missed catching it on camera.*

The camera then swung around to find Jess. She was dressed for hiking with binoculars around her neck and a birding checklist in her hand. She looked healthy and happy. 

Byron’s voice: *Please, tell me you believe me.* 

Jess: *It doesn’t matter if I believe you or not, rules are we need proof for it to count, so…*

Byron’s voice: *C’mon, Jess, if you don’t believe me, no one’s going to.*

Jess: *Sorry.*

Byron turned the phone around to film himself to speak directly into the camera. He too looked healthy and happy. The familiar spark of excitement was alight in his eyes.

Byron: *I did see it. I don’t even care if I have proof or not, my eyes have seen a red-shouldered hawk, and no one can take that away from me. It is a big fat shame to miss out on the points, but the points really aren’t what matters, right? It’s the experience.*

He turned the camera away from himself towards Jess. 

Byron’s voice: *I’ll just keep this on though, so I don’t miss it if it’s still around.*

Jess: *You just said it’s the experience that matters and you want to…* 

Then she stopped because something had caught her eye above her - she craned her neck to look up. 

Jess: *What is…?*

She raised her binoculars to look through them. Byron’s video started sweeping the trees again. 

Byron’s voice: *Is it the hawk?! I knew-*

Jess’s voice: *No, look!*

The video frame found Jess again - she was pointing, wide-eyed. 

She said: *Up ther-* 

Suddenly, Jess was blasted with white light! She screamed as she shielded her face. The light was accompanied by an intense humming sound. Byron was clearly shocked as the video jumped and the frame fell away from Jess to then be aimed at the dirt, which was washed in the same white light.

Then, the sound and light were gone as quickly as they had come. Byron and Jess’ voices were still audible off screen.

Byron's voice: *Holy crap! Jess, are you ok?!*

Jess's voice: *Please tell me you got that! Byron, please tell me you got that on camera!*

Byron's voice: *Got what? What was that!?* 

Jess's voice: *Give me your phone! We have to film this.*

Jess then took the phone and the video quickly scanned the woods and the sky. The video then started moving through the woods quickly - Jess was running off the trail and into the tress.

Byron’s voice followed her: *What did you see? Did something crash?!*

A sound of a thud followed, then the camera launched forward to the dirt - it seemed Jess had tripped.

Byron’s voice: *Are you ok?!*

Jess’s voice: *Yeah, yeah. Your phone ok? Is it still recording?*

Byron picked it up - his face was visible for a bit as he examined it. 

Byron: *Yeah*. *Are you bleeding?*

Jess was then visible in the video. She examined her hand as she got up - it was scraped and bloody. 

Jess: *I’m fine. Keep filming. Follow me.*

She didn’t seem to care much about her injury; she focused more on quickly leading Byron further into the trees. 

Byron’s voice: *Why? Slow down. What did you see?* 

Jess: *It looked like... okay, this is going to sound crazy, but I swear it’s true... It looked like a... disc. In the air. A really big one.*  

Byron’s voice: *A disc... like a saucer?* 

Jess: *Yeah, like a saucer. I just didn’t want to say saucer because that would sound-*

Byron’s voice: *Crazy.* 

Jess: *I know what it sounds like. That’s why I need to- there was a big beam of light, Byron. You saw the light, right? It came right down. Over here. I think it dropped something. Just through here.* 

Byron’s hand reached out to grab Jess’s arm as he said: *Wait! Do you think this is a good idea? We’re getting far off the-*

Then something caught his attention, and the video shifted off Jess. There, in the woods, was a dark-haired woman standing in the trees. Her face wasn’t visible as her back was toward the camera. She was looking straight up into the sky. She wasn’t moving. 

Byron pointed and said: *There’s someone there.* 

Byron kept the video shooting between the woman and Jess. Jess saw the woman and called out to her: *Hello! Did you see- did you see what just came down here?!* 

Byron’s voice: *My girlfriend thinks she saw a flying saucer-*

Jess: *-I did see...* 

Jess spoke to the woman again: *Did you see it? You must’ve!* 

The camera followed as Jess approached the woman. But it was like the woman hadn’t registered them at all. She stayed completely still. 

Jess: *Sorry, are you ok?* 

Byron’s voice: *Helllloooo?* 

He then whispered to Jess: *This is weird, right? Maybe I should stop film-*

Jess: *No! She’s probably just shocked. She was really close to it. Keep filming. And don’t miss anything. This isn’t like the hawk, ok. We could have, like, major historical footage here.* 

She walked up to the woman. 

Jess: *Hi, I’m Jess. This is my boyfriend, Byron. Can you tell us what you saw?* 

The woman slowly brought her eyes down from the sky. She then turned to face them. 

Byron’s voice: *You look familiar. Have we met? Are you a birder too?* 

The woman’s eyes locked on Byron, but she said nothing. (I realized that I had seen this woman before too.) 

Jess: *What’s your name?* 

The woman looked confused. Her eyes then scanned the trees. 

Byron’s voice: *Hey, Jess... I think we should call someone…*

Jess nodded and dug deep into her backpack to find her phone. Bringing it out, she looked at it (this was the phone with the yellow canary on the case that the campers had remembered).

Jess: *There’s no signal here.* 

Jess then focused on the woman.

Jess: *Why don’t you sit down for a sec. It was pretty shocking, wasn’t it? Do you have water?* 

The woman wasn’t carrying anything. While Byron and Jess were in full hiking gear, the woman was in jeans and sneakers. Jess took a water bottle out of her backpack and gave it to the woman.  

Jess: *Here, you can have this. I haven't drunk from it yet.*

The woman didn’t drink from it. She just held the bottle, turning it slowly in her hands. Jess turned to Byron. 

Jess whispered: *She’ll be ok. Just give her a minute.* 

Byron’s voice*: Do you not think she looks familiar?*

Jess shrugged. But then she studied the woman more closely. Then, Jess’s expression changed as she realized something. She hurriedly opened her phone. 

Jess: *Remember those campers took a photo of us at the trailhead…*

Byron’s voice: *Yeah, but neither of them looked at all like-*

Then Jess turned her phone towards Byron, a photo of the two of them up on her screen. 

Jess: *Look.* 

Byron’s voice: *What am I looking at?* 

Jess whispered: *Take it, look at the poster.* 

Jess then swapped phones with Byron; she took Byron’s phone so he could look at hers while she filmed him. 

Byron looked at the photo on the phone. It was the one taken of them by the map at the trailhead. 

Jess's voice: *The missing poster.*

Byron's eyes caught the Missing Poster - it was right beside them in the photo. He zoomed up on it - to the photo of LOTTIE JAMES. Byron’s face looked shocked. 

Byron whispered: *She looks exactly like her.* 

He then turned to the woman.

Byron: *Are you… by any chance… related to Lottie James?* 

The woman just looked at Byron, but still didn’t say anything. 

Byron: *The woman who went missing here in 1971.* 

The video moved closer to the woman as Jess approached her with the phone. 

Jess’s voice: *Who are you?* 

The video got even closer to the woman. 

Jess’s voice: *Seriously, who are you?!*

The woman just stared at Jess, her eyes unblinking. 

Then- a strange set of eyelids blinked underneath! 

Jess’s voice: *What th-*

Suddenly, CRACK - the sound was horrible as the woman’s jaw snapped open, unnaturally wide. Then woman then released an unearthly piercing sound from her mouth. The video flickered and warped then-

The video ended.

Byron and Jess are still missing. 

And, as far as I know, Lottie James - or whatever it was that looked like Lottie - is still out there.
