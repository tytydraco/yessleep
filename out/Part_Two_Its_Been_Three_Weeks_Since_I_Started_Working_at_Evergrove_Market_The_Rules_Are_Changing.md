Believe it or not, I’ve made it three whole weeks in this nightmare.

Three weeks of bone-deep whispers, flickering lights, and pale things pretending to be people.

And somehow, against all odds, I keep making it to sunrise.

By now, I’ve realized something very comforting—sarcasm fully intended:

The horror here runs on a schedule.

The Pale Lady shows up every night at exactly 1:15 a.m.

Not a minute early. Not a second late.

She always asks for meat—the same meat she already knows is in the freezer behind the store.

I never see her leave. She just stands there, grinning like a damn wax statue for two straight minutes… then floats off to get it herself.

Every third night, the lights go out at 12:43 a.m.

Right on the dot.

Just long enough for me to crawl behind a shelf, hold my breath, and wonder what thing is breathing just a few feet away in the dark.

And every two days, the ancient intercom crackles to life and croaks the same cheerful death sentence:

“Attention Evergrove Staff. Remi in aisle 8, please report to the reception.”

It’s always when I’m in aisle 8.

It’s always my name.

The only thing that changes is the freak show of “customers” after 2 a.m.

They’re different from the hostile monster I met on my first shift—more… polite. Fake.

On Wednesdays, it’s an old woman with way too many teeth and no concept of personal space.

Thursdays, a smooth-talking businessman in a sharp suit follows me around, asking for the latest cigarettes.

I never respond.

Rule 4 …. is pretty clear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

And the old man—my “boss”—well, he’s always surprised to see me at the end of each shift.

Not happy. Not relieved.

Just... surprised. Like he’s been quietly rooting for the building to eat me.

This morning? Same deal. He walked in at 6:00 a.m. sharp, his coat still covered in frost that somehow never melts.

“Here’s your paycheck,” he said, sliding the envelope across the breakroom table.

$500 for another night of surviving hell. 

But this time, something was different in his face.

Less dead-eyed exhaustion, more… pity. Or maybe fear.

“So, promotion’s the golden ticket out, huh?” I said, dry as dust, like the idea didn’t make my skin crawl. Not that I’d ever take it.

That note from my first night still burned in the back of my skull like a warning:

DON’T ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

He didn’t answer right away. Just looked at me like I’d said something dangerous.

Finally, he muttered, “You better hope you don’t survive long enough to be offered one.”

Yeah. That shut me up.

He sat across from me, his eyes flicking toward the clock like something was counting down.

“This place,” he said, voice low like he was afraid it might hear him, “after midnight… it stops being a store.”

His gaze didn’t meet mine. It drifted toward the flickering ceiling light, like he was remembering something he wished he could forget.

“It looks the same. Aisles. Shelves. Registers. But underneath, it’s different. It turns into something else. A threshold. A mouth. A… trap.”

He paused, hands tightening around his mug until the ceramic creaked.

“There’s something on the other side. Watching. Waiting. And every so often… it reaches through.”

He took a breath like he’d just surfaced from deep water.

“That’s when people get ‘promoted.’”

He said the word like it tasted rotten.

I frowned. “Promoted by who?”

He looked at me then. Just for a second.

Not with fear. With resignation.

Like he’d already accepted, his answer was too late to help me.

“He wears a suit. Always a suit. Too perfect. Too still. Like he was made in a place where nothing alive should come from.”

The old man’s voice went brittle.

“You’ll know him when you see him. Something about him... it doesn’t belong in this world. Doesn’t pretend to, either. Like a mannequin that learned how to walk and smile, but not why.”

Another pause.

“Eyes like mirrors. Smile like a trap. And a voice you’ll still hear three days after he’s gone.”

His fingers trembled now, just a little.

“This place calls him the Night Manager.”

I didn’t say anything at first.

Just sat there, staring at the old man while the weight of his words sank in like cold water through a thin coat.

The Night Manager.

The name itself felt wrong. Too simple for something that didn’t sound remotely human.

I swallowed hard, suddenly aware of every flickering shadow in the corners of the breakroom.

The hum of the vending machine behind me sounded like it was breathing.

Finally, I managed to speak, voice quieter than I expected.

“…How long have you been working here?”

He stared into his coffee for a long moment. When he finally spoke, his voice was smaller.

“I was fifteen. Came here looking for my dad.”

Another pause. Longer this time. He looked like the words hurt.

“There was a girl working with me. Younger than you. Two months in, she got offered a promotion. Took it. Gone the next day. No trace. No mention. Just... erased.”

He kept going, softer now.

“Found out later my dad got the same offer. Worked four nights. Just four. Then vanished. No goodbye. No clue. Just... gone.”

Then he looked at me. And I swear, for the first time, he looked human—not like the tired crypt keeper who hands me my checks.

“That’s when I stopped looking for him,” he said. “His fate was the same as everyone else who took the promotion. Just… gone.”

And then the clock hit 6:10, and just like that, he waved me off. Like he hadn’t just dumped a lifetime of this store’s lore straight into my lap.

I went home feeling... something. Dread? Grief? Maybe both.

But here’s the thing—I still sleep like a rock. Every single night.

It’s a skill I picked up after years of dozing off to yelling matches through the walls.

I guess that’s the only upside to having nothing left to care about—silence sticks easier when there’s no one left to miss you.

There wasn’t anything left to do anyways. I’d already exhausted every half-rational plan to claw my way out of this waking nightmare.

After my first shift, I went full tinfoil-hat mode—hours lost in internet rabbit holes, digging through dead forums, broken archives, and sketchy conspiracy blogs.

Evergrove Market. The town. The things that whisper after midnight.

Nothing.

Just ancient Reddit threads with zero replies, broken links, and a wall of digital silence.

Not even my overpriced, utterly useless engineering degree could make sense of it.

By the third night, I gave up on Google and stumbled into the town library as soon as it opened at 7 a.m. I looked like hell—raccoon eyes, hoodie, stale energy drink breath. A walking red flag.

The librarian clocked me instantly. One glance, and I knew she’d mentally added me to the “trouble” list.

Still, I gave it a shot.

I asked her if they had anything on cursed buildings, haunted retail spaces, or entities shaped like oversized dogs with jaws that hinged the wrong way.

She gave me the kind of look reserved for people who mutter to themselves on public transit. One perfectly raised brow and a twitch of the hand near the desk phone, like she was debating whether to dial psych services or security.

Honestly? I wouldn’t have blamed her.

But she didn’t. And I walked out with nothing but more questions.

This morning, I slept like a corpse again.

Three weeks of surviving hell shifts had earned me one thing: the ability to pass out like the dead and wake up to return to torture I now call work.

But the moment I walked through the door, something was wrong.

Not just off—wrong. It felt like standing at the edge of a cliff, gravity whispering your name. Everything in me screamed: run.

But the contract? The contract said don’t.

And I’m more scared of breaking that than dying.

So I stepped inside.

The reception was empty.

No old man. No sarcastic remarks. No frost-covered coat.

I checked the usual places—the haunted freezer, aisle 8, even the breakroom.

Nothing. No one.

My shift started quietly. Too quietly.

It was Thursday, so I waited for the schedule to kick in.

Pale Lady at 1:15. The businessman around 3. Then the whispers. The lights. The routine nightmare.

But tonight, the system failed.

At 1:30, the freezer started humming.

In reverse.

Not a metaphor. Literally backwards. Like someone had rewound reality by mistake. The air around aisle five warped with the sound, like it was bending under the weight of something it couldn’t see.

Even the Pale Lady didn’t show up tonight. And that freak never misses her meat run.

No flickering lights. No intercom.

Just silence.

Then, at 3:00 a.m., the businessman arrived.

Same tailored suit. Same perfect hair. But no words. No stalking.

He walked up to the front doors, pulled a laminated sheet from inside his jacket, and slapped it against the glass.

Then he left.

No nod. No look. No goodbye.

Just gone.

I walked up to the door, heart already thudding. I didn’t even need to read it.

Same font. Same laminate.

Same cursed format that had already ruined any hope of a normal life.

Another list.

**NEW STAFF DIRECTIVE – PHASE TWO**

*Effective Immediately*

I started reading.

1. **The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**

Cool. Starting strong.

1. **If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**

Because babies are terrifying now, apparently.

1. **A second you may arrive at any time. Do not speak to them. Do not let them speak to you. If they say your name, cover your ears and run to the cleaning supply closet. Lock the door. Count to 200. Wait for silence.**

What the actual hell?

1. **If you find yourself outside the store without remembering how you got there—go back inside immediately. Do not look at the sky.**
2. **Something new lives behind the canned goods aisle. If you hear it breathing, whistle softly as you walk by. It hates silence.**
3. **If the intercom crackles at 4:44 a.m., stop whatever you're doing and lie face down on the floor. Do not move. You will hear your name spoken backward. Do not react.**
4. **Do not use the bathroom between 1:33 a.m. and 2:06 a.m. Someone else is in there. They do not know they are dead.**
5. **If the fluorescent lights begin to pulse in sets of three, you are being watched. Do not acknowledge it. Speak in a language you don’t know until it passes.**
6. **There will be a man in a suit standing just outside the front doors at some point. His smile will be too wide. He does not blink. Do not let him in. Do not wave. Do not turn your back.**
7. **If the emergency alarm sounds and you hear someone scream your mother’s name—run. Do not stop. Do not check the time. Run until your legs give out or the sun rises. Whichever comes first.**

I blinked.

Once.

Twice.

What the actual hell?

April Fools? Except it’s July. And no one here has a sense of humor—least of all me.

I stared at one of the lines, as if rereading it would somehow make it make sense:

"A second you may arrive tonight. Do not speak to them…"

Yeah. Totally normal. Just me and my evil doppelgänger hanging out in aisle three.

"Do not look at the sky."

"Speak in a language you don’t know."

"Run until your legs give out or the sun rises."

By the time I reached the last line, I wasn’t even scared. Not really.

I was numb.

Like someone had handed me the diary of a lunatic and said, “Live by this or die screaming.”

It was unhinged. Unfollowable. Inhuman.

And yet?

I didn’t laugh.

Because I’ve seen things.

Things that defy explanation. Things that should not exist.

The freezer humming like it’s rewinding reality.

Shadows that slither against physics. 

The businessman with the dead eyes and the too-quiet shoes who shows up only to tack new horrors to the wall like corporate memos from hell.

This place stopped pretending to make sense the moment I locked that thing in the basement on my first shift.

And that’s why this list scared the hell out of me.

Because rules—real rules—can be followed. Survived.

But this? This was a warning stapled to the jaws of something that plans to bite.

I folded the page with shaking hands, slipped it into my pocket like a sacred text, and backed away from the front door.

That’s when it happened.

That... shift.

Like gravity blinked. Like the air twitched.

The front door creaked—not the usual automatic hiss and chime, but a long, slow swing like a church door opening at a funeral.

I turned.

And he walked in.

Black shoes, polished like obsidian.

A charcoal suit that clung to him like a shadow.

Tall. Too tall to be usual but not tall enough to be impossible. And sharp—like someone had sculpted him out of glass and intent.

He looked like he belonged on a red carpet or a Wall Street throne.

But in the flickering, jaundiced lights of Evergrove Market, he didn’t look human.

Not wrong, exactly. Just... off.

Like a simulation rendered one resolution too high. Like someone had described “man” to an alien artist and this was the first draft.

His smile was perfect.

Too perfect.

Practiced, like a knife learning to grin.

The temperature dropped the moment he stepped over the threshold.

He didn’t say a word. Just stared at me.

Eyes like static—glass marbles that shimmered with a color I didn’t have a name for. A color that probably doesn’t belong in this dimension.

And I knew.

Right then, I knew why the old man warned me. Why he flinched every time I brought up promotions.

Because this was the one who offers them.

From behind the counter, the old man appeared. Quiet. Like he’d been summoned by scent or blood or fate.

He didn’t look shocked.

Just... done. Like someone waiting for the train they swore they’d never board. He gave the tiniest nod. “This,” he said, voice barely above a whisper, “is the Night Manager.”

I stared.

The thing called the night manager stared back.

No blinking.

No breathing.

Just that flawless, eerie smile.

And then, in a voice that slid under my skin and curled against my spine, he said:

“Welcome to phase two.”
