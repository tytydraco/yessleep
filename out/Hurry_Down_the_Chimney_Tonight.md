“Christ, I don’t know how you talked me into this.”

The…thing Meredith had seen in the thrift store barely fit in the back of our car, even with the seats pushed down. Getting it in had been one thing…getting it out would be another.

“Oh come *on*, it was just too cute. It’ll be like living in a Christmas card with this next to the tree!” she said brightly.

That was true. The fireplace - maybe, Fireplace with a capital *F* was more appropriate - was a five-foot-tall monstrosity made of laminate wood, plastic stonework, and fake bricks with a little bit of faux moss artfully applied with green paint. Meredith practically squealed when she saw it in the housewares section. It came with a cord in the back to plug into the wall, which lit up a small pile of plastic logs at the base. It was wide, too, wide enough for a mantlepiece that she insisted we could hang our stockings from. It looked like it came out of a Thomas Kinkade painting, if his work could somehow be more kitschy. 

I stepped forward and gave it an experimental tug. It slid a bit out of the back, but not much.

“Did this thing get bigger after we left the store?” I asked.

“Maybe we can get Misty to help.” Meredith joked.

I turned to see our cat in the window, watching us with boredom. She flicked an ear and raised her leg to begin licking her paw.

“Lucky girl. She gets to sit in the warm house while we’re out here in the cold.”

“The sooner you stop stalling, the sooner we can join her! It’ll be easy. Let’s just get it out halfway, then we can tip it to the ground. You push, I’ll pull.”

Meredith always had a better mind for these things than I did.

I took my position at the base of the Fireplace, and she opened the passenger door and placed her hands on top of the chimney.

“Ok...one…two...three...GO!”

I tugged with all my might while she put all her weight forward. It slid out much faster and easier than we’d thought. It was heavier on the bottom. I yelled in surprise and rolled to the right, barely missing having my stomach caved in, as it tumbled out and landed upright on the driveway with a loud crash. 

In doing so, something that had been stuck inside the chimney came loose, dropping out and skittering across the concrete to land near my hand.

“Matt! Are you okay?” Meredith rushed around the side of the car. I gave her a small wave from my position. She laughed. “I thought I was going to have a lonely Christmas.” She looked down. “What is that?”

It was a cardboard box, wrapped in paper decorated with snowflakes and tied with a red ribbon. It looked beaten-up and slightly old, the white of the flakes yellowed a bit.

“I thought presents were supposed to go under the tree, not up the chimney.” I said, getting back to my feet and giving the box a shake. Something rattled inside. “Previous owners probably hid their kid’s gift up there and forgot about it. I wonder if…”

Before I could stop her, Meredith snatched it out of my hands and began ripping at the paper eagerly. “I just *love* cool thrift stuff like this! Little reminders of the people things used to belong to.”

Within seconds, she had pulled off the ribbon and eagerly opened the lid. The look of excitement on her face slowly drained.

Puzzled, I peeked inside and frowned. It was a shoe, a child’s sneaker too dirty and roughed up to be new. One of the laces had been violently torn out of the eyelets, hanging limply down and swaying slightly in the breeze.

“Man…what kind of bad parents did this kid have?” Meredith said, picking up the shoe and turning it over in her hands. “It has to be a joke of some kind. A gag gift. Give Bobby his old pair of Sketchers before giving him new ones.”

She looked troubled, so I put my arm around her. “Now, madam, we can’t think such sad thoughts on the Yuletide! Now come, help be carry your hearth into thine castle.” 

She giggled and bent down to pick up one side, letting the shoe drop to the driveway. As we carried the Fireplace into the house, I stared glumly at it. What a rotten present to give to a kid.

—

Meredith took to the Fireplace immediately. She had me move the tree out of its usual place in the corner to make room for it. In a frenzy of stockings, garlands, and cards, she had the whole thing decked out in under half an hour.

“And now for the piece de resistance…” she climbed eagerly behind it and plugged the cord into the wall. The plastic logs roared to life…or rather, feebly lit up with just enough glow to be disappointing. But she’d strung lights around the mantle, and our stockings hung there, bathed slightly in the orange glow. When Meredith stepped back out and saw the whole thing, she sighed.

“Awww, it reminds me of my grandma’s fireplace. She used to decorate it like this every Christmas.” 

I had to admit, it did look charming. At least in its total affront to good taste. But if it made her happy, it made me happy.

“Now we can decorate it every year, too. Start a new tradition.”

Meredith smiled and leaned up to kiss me. 

Misty, who up to this point had been lounging with disinterest on the couch, pounced off and sauntered over. She narrowed her eyes at the new addition to our home and came closer, reaching out an experimental paw.

“Awww, this is too cute. Matt, take a picture.” 

I reached in my pocket for my phone when we heard a rattling. Misty hissed and jumped back as a second present, this time with green paper, came tumbling out of the chimney and landed haphazardly in front of the Fireplace. With a yowl, Misty bolted and disappeared down the hallway.

“Uh…guess there was one more in there.” I snatched it up and handed it to Meredith. “Things come in pairs. One shoe for the other?” 

She began tearing at the paper. “Maybe the previous owners put the receipt inside somewhere. We could try to find them. Maybe these were special presents they forgot about before donating it.” She lifted the lid off and somehow frowned deeper than she had with the first gift.

“What? Did Bobby have Athlete’s foot or something?” I peeked inside and frowned as well. It was a pair of glasses, for a kid given the size. The right lens was cracked nearly in half. The left was missing altogether.

“Matt, I don’t like this.” Meredith put the box down and began looking around the edges of the fireplace. “People usually write their names on larger things they own, right?”

I stepped up and put my hands on her shoulders. “If it’s freaking you out that much, we can just take it back to the store.” We both stepped back and looked at the decorations festooning the Fireplace. They seemed inadequate now, frivolous, even, to cover up what was really just an ugly hunk of wood and plastic. 

Meredith obviously thought differently. “But it looks so nice! Can we at least keep it up until Mom and Dad come to visit next week? Then we can take it back, I promise.”

I didn’t have the heart at the moment to tell her I’d thrown the receipt away. But no matter. I would cart it off in the car, slap a *FREE* sign on it, and leave it somewhere in town.

“Sure, babe. Anything you want.”

And we stood there, wrapped in each other’s arms, as the lights twinkled.

We had gotten the Fireplace on a chance Thursday night trip to the thrift store, so the next day we had to work. Both of our companies had gone back to the office post-COVID as quickly as they could, so we were both slow in getting ready. I eyed the dark clouds outside the bathroom window as I brushed my teeth. It was going to be a cold day.

I came downstairs to find Misty in front of the fireplace, crouched as if waiting to pounce. Her tail flicked lazily behind her. I reached down and petted her back. “What is it, girl? Are you waiting for Santa to come down with some Fancy Feast?”

I looked over and froze. There was another present, in blue wrapping, lying in front of the Fireplace. Like the other two, the paper was ripped in the corners and looked old. I snatched it up and turned it over. “What the hell?” I said to no one in particular. “How many presents can fit up that chimney?”

I set it on the coffee table and got on my hands and knees, torso inside the Fireplace. The tightness of my slacks as I awkwardly turned to reach up reminded me not to indulge so much this holiday. Maybe even start the new years’ resolutions early.

I expected my hand to hit a wall of plastic only a foot or two inside the chimney, but to my surprise, it kept going. I grunted and repositioned, trying to reach up further. Despite the extra length, I still didn’t feel an end. Oddly, the air seemed colder on my hands the further up I reached. There was enough room to get off my knees. The areas I was touching felt strange, rougher, harder than they should have been. 

I thought I would have enough space to stand up completely, but I finally hit the top of the chimney. I gave it a few experimental pushes. It felt solid. I tried to see by the light of the room seeping in from the bottom, but it was surprisingly dark. Well, I hadn’t collided with any more presents. That had to be the last of them.

Just to be sure, I began to feel around the top. Who knows, maybe the previous owners \**had*\* stuck the receipt up here. My fingers brushed on the edge of something. I frowned. It almost felt like a slot. I pushed my fingertips in and pulled. It gave slightly, almost like the hinge on a trapdoor. In doing so, a puff of air, colder than it had any right to be, ran over my fingers. Goosebumps went down my arms. What was this thing?

“Babe! Have you seen my necklace? I think I left it in the kitchen.” 

Judging by the muffled quality of Meredith’s voice, she was still upstairs. I let the slot close again and crouched, quickly backing out of the Fireplace. For some reason, I didn’t want her to see me peeking up there. Misty had apparently lost interest and took to staring wide-eyed at the lights that adorned the tree. 

“Uh, I don’t know. One second!” I quickly snatched up the present. The glasses and shoes had been bad enough; I didn’t want to know what was in there. Much less for Meredith to find out there had been another one.

“Hang on, I’m coming!” I heard her steps descending the stairs. Without thinking, I jammed the present under the couch and had just enough time to dart into the kitchen before she came down. The necklace was on the counter next to the coffee pot.

“Found it.” I said sheepishly. She smiled and turned her back so I could fasten it. “How did Misty like the Fireplace? Has she found a new scratching post?” We’d lost a few pieces of furniture to her restless claws.

“No, she doesn’t seem to mind it, actually.” I lied. She turned around and smiled. “C’mon. The sooner we start the day the sooner it’ll be over.” We left the tree on for Misty. As we stepped out the door, I glanced back at the fireplace. Only another week.

—--

Meredith’s office was closer, so she usually got home first despite both our days ending at 4:30. As I drove through town, past the shop windows covered in fake snow and garlands, I began to feel uneasy. Some Christmas song was on the radio, but I shut it off. I couldn’t put my finger on what felt wrong.

I got my answer when I walked in the door. Meredith stood near the Fireplace, another present in her hands. Her coat and bag lay forgotten on the couch. I had a moment of fear that she’d found the one I’d hidden this morning, but the paper was different. Instead of blue trees with yellow lights, a pattern of red, green, and gold decorated it. The momentary relief that had washed over me was replaced with confusion. There hadn’t been any more presents up the chimney. I’d checked.

“This was in front of the Fireplace when I came home.” She sounded like she was trying to stop from panicking. Her hands trembled slightly as she held it out. “What the hell is going on, Matt?” 

“I…I…uh…” I struggled for words. Before I could stop her she began tearing furiously at the paper. “Where the fuck do these keep coming from? Oh God, I don’t want to do this…” she ripped away the last of the paper and opened the lid. She recoiled like she’d been shocked and threw it to the carpet with a cry. The object inside bounced out and rolled across the carpet towards me.

It was a tie, an orange paisley necktie that had been torn to shreds. Only the carefully tied knot at the center of the loop kept the loose strands of fabric from falling away. A few long black hairs were tangled among the folds.

“There’s something wrong with this thing, Matt.” Meredith began tearing down the lights she’d tied around the mantle and throwing the Christmas cards to the ground. “I don’t want it in our house anymore. Whoever owned this had a sick fucking sense of humor.”

For some reason, I thought of the slot I’d felt up the chimney that morning and got an idea. Maybe the look of joy on her face when she’d finished setting it up yesterday inspired me. “Babe. Babe, wait.” She stopped her destruction and turned to look. “Maybe there’s an explanation for all this.”

She stepped back. I got on my hands and knees again and started crawling inside the Fireplace. “What are you doing?” she asked, with a slight edge of worry in her voice. I got back in the semi-crouched position I’d taken that morning and felt around for the slot. My fingers found purchase and I tugged. The cold air that shouldn’t have been there hit my hands again, but I ignored it as the compartment opened. I extended my arm as far as it could go down the new hole and felt around. Something with a cornered edge hit my palm.

“Merry, go around to the back of this thing.” I was sure my voice sounded muffled to her. 

“Why?” 

“Just do it. I think I know the source of our mystery presents.” 

I heard her clamber around to the back of the fireplace. “And what, exactly, am I looking for?”

“I don’t know, some kind of door or hatch or something.”

A few seconds passed before as a second source of light came spilling out of the small compartment door. I looked in to see a row of presents, all in their own cubbyholes, arranged around some kind of chained track. My had was inches away from a grabbing mechanism and the motorized hinge of the compartment. 

Meredith’s voice was clearer and closer, so I knew she was speaking through the hatch she’d found above. “Holy crap! What the hell is this thing?”

“I think I know.” I said. “It’s a gimmick. You put presents in the back and this system moves them around and drops them from the chimney for you. The parents can say, ‘Look, Santa is sending you one early’. It’s a thing for kids.”

There was relief in her voice when she spoke again. “Oh, thank God. I thought they were coming from a wormhole or something.”

I closed the door and retreated out of the fireplace. Meredith was already taking the presents out of the back. “I guess the parents forgot to take these out before donating it.” She gleaned up. “Well, don’t just stand there. Help me get these out.”

—-

There were six more presents altogether, each wrapped in a different style of paper. Given the glasses, shoe, and tie from earlier we weren’t expecting toys as we unwrapped them. But each passing “gift” only made us more uneasy. 

It made for an odd, disquieting tableau once we laid them all out on the coffee table. A woman’s red sweater, torn at the left shoulder. A pair of house keys. The missing lens from the pair of glasses. An empty wallet. A broken necklace, box full of separated links. And, worst of all, a dried, bloody band-aid wrapped with a crusty piece of gauze.

“Who the hell were these people?” Meredith asked, leaning back onto the couch. “There’s no way any of these were meant as real gifts, even as a white elephant. What’s the point of buying something like that if you’re only going to have it dispense \**this\** stuff? And they went to all the trouble of wrapping it all in different paper, too.”

“I don’t know. Some people just aren’t right, I guess.” It was an inadequate explanation, but it was all I dared to think at the moment.

“Well, first thing tomorrow we’re taking it right back to the sore. Let someone else take this creep’s holiday memorabilia home.” She began gathering up the wrapping paper. 

My eyes drifted over to the Fireplace and I noticed, for the first time, the scratch marks down the side. The wood and plastic stonework was slashed in multiple places. Especially around the base. The glowing logs had a number done on them as well.

“Looks like Misty used it as a scratching post after all. She doesn’t like it either. One more reason to get rid of it.” I said. 

Meredith stopped cleaning up and looked troubled. “Have you seen her since we got home? She usually comes to the door when I come in, but she didn’t tonight.” 

Now that I thought about it, I hadn’t. She usually came to supervise whatever we were doing in the living room in the evenings, but there was neither hide nor hair or our gray furball.

The next thing I knew, we were going all around the house, looking under chairs, in the bathroom, and inside the kitchen cabinets. I tried calling her name a few times before realizing she wasn’t a dog. As evening turned to night and we ran out of places to search, Meredith grew more frantic.

“Maybe she slipped out when I was coming in the door. I was checking a text from work and could’ve missed her. Or maybe she’s stuck somewhere! Oh God, Matt, what if she got inside the walls?”

I tried to calm her down. “Babe, it’s okay. Cats just disappear like this sometimes. Maybe she’s holding us being away all day against us particularly hard today. She’ll turn up. Look, why don’t we sit down and watch a movie?”

Meredith only agreed to this plan if we set Misty’s food dish on the ground beside the couch. At every commercial break she shook the bowl, hoping the sound would attract her. But as *Love Actually* reached the final airport scene, it was clear she’d stopped paying attention long ago.

“I just don’t know where she could have gone.”

I turned off the TV and started unplugging the lights. Truth be told, I was starting to lose hope too. But as we walked towards the stairs, I tried one more time to assure her. “This is her home. If she got outside somehow, she’d find her way back. I’m sure she’ll be scratching on the front door anytime now if it comes to that.”

I glanced back at the scratches on the Fireplace one last time. Misty had been right, of course. Animals have a sixth sense like that.

—--

I was woken up around 8:00 the next morning by a box being thrown onto my stomach.

“Wha…?” I was still half asleep, trying to process what was happening, when Meredith’s voice, angry and demanding, cut through the fog.

“Is this a joke, Matthew?”

I blinked a few times and sat up. It took me a second to process what was in my lap. Another gift, this one a swirling design of purple snowflakes. The paper was torn away and the lid was off.

“I found that in front of the Fireplace when I went to make coffee. Did you sneak downstairs and wrap this in the middle of the night?

I looked inside the box and my blood ran cold. I put a shaky hand inside and pulled out Misty’s collar, the red one with blue stripes. Her name tag glinted in the sunlight that streamed through the window.

“What? What are you talking about?” I turned to look at Meredith, who continued her death glare.

“It was wrapped and everything. What happened to Misty, Matt? Did you find her and think this would be cute? Because it’s not. Especially involving the Fireplace. Where is she?”

“I have no idea where this came from. I slept the whole night through. Merry, you have to believe me.” 

But it was obvious she didn’t. She began tearing through the bedroom, looking under the bed and throwing the closet apart. 

“Uh huh. And I suppose it just materialized in front of the Fireplace? We took everything out of it. It was empty. Look, just tell me where she is so we can get on with our day.”

We continued arguing, her accusing me of hiding Misty, and me trying to defend myself. The words got more heated and our voices louder. I ended up going downstairs and collapsing on the couch while she went into the bathroom and slammed the door.

She’d left a Kenny G Christmas album playing on the stereo. As the gooey saxophone ripples started to melt my brain, something came to me.

I got up and eyed the Fireplace again. The scratches in the plastic were deep, deeper than I thought. And given the location of scratched-off pieces, Misty’s claws had dragged…from inside the Fireplace. There was a bit of her gray fur on top of the logs.

I climbed behind it and opened the hatch. Just as I’d expected the slots were empty. All six. 

It clicked then. There had been six presents for six slots. That’s all that could fit in there. 

Where had the other four come from? The shoe, the glasses, the one under the couch, and especially Misty’s collar?

My thoughts were interrupted by the bedroom door slamming. I peeked out from behind the Fireplace to see Meredith coming down the stairs two at a time. Her keys jangled in her hand.

“I’m going out for a while. Maybe I’ll stop by Mom and Dad’s. Please, when I get back, stop the jokes.”

Before I could get a word in edgewise, the door slammed behind her. 

The next thing I knew, I was rummaging around under the couch. It somehow looked worse than the previous morning. The paper was more tattered, and the ribbon practically falling off.

I tore off the lid and peered inside. It was almost funny. A dog collar, with little mistletoes decorating it. I read the name *Benny* on the tag. 

I glanced up. The interior of the Fireplace looked darker than I remembered. I couldn’t even see the back wall behind the logs. With a loud thump, another present came falling out of the chimney, tumbling over itself and landing next to the coffee table.

Something snapped in me then. I don’t know if it was leftover adrenaline from the fight between Meredith and I, the sheer impossibility of it all, or the fact I missed my cat. Before I could stop myself, I was on my hands and knees and crawling inside the fireplace. 

I was slow in raising myself up, crouching slightly to not hit my head on the top of the chimney. I barely registered I was now standing at my full height before feeling around in the darkness for a second hatch, another compartment to put more presents in. But as the cool, almost Arctic air draped down my shoulders, I was increasingly aware that was an impossibility.

My finger pricked on something sharp and I drew back in surprise, banging my elbow on the opposite wall. I reached up again in the gloom and yanked it out.

It was one of Misty’s claws. It had to be. Embedded inside the chimney. A few rows up the fake stones was what appeared to be a fingernail. I spotted a second and third, jutting out from the cracks, as I gazed upward. The chimney continued, well past where it should have stopped, plastic stonework looking more like real masonry, until the shaft disappeared into darkness. 

From somewhere high above, I heard a meow. 

“Misty!?” I cried, momentarily forgetting what a terrible situation I’d gotten myself in. 

The meow came again, and I detected movement just on the edge of the shadows. If I squinted just right, it looked like a cat’s tail, swinging in a slow, lazy arc.

“Misty! That’s it, girl! Come on down!” I stretched up on my tiptoes and reached as far up as I could. When my fingers touched the fur, I registered two things at once.

First, it was cold and stiff. Not like the warm softness of a cat at all.

Second, the tail had come down a bit too far out of the shadows and I saw what was on the end, holding it out like fishing lure. A hand, old, ashen gray, and gnarled. For a moment, I thought I saw a white ruff and a red sleeve behind it.

In the seconds it took to process this, the hand dropped the tail and grasped mine, intertwining our fingers and digging its nails into my palm.

I screamed and tried to pull back, but the grip was like a vice. It began retreating upward, slowly taking me with it. I batted at it weakly with my other hand and tried to grab at something to stop the ascent, but my fingers skated uselessly over the stones. 

With mounting horror, I realized my feet were starting to leave the ground. I swung my legs outwards, trying to hook one of them on the edge of the opening, but missed.

The hand dug its nails in tighter. I felt blood well on my palm and start dripping down my arm.

I swung again and managed to catch my foot on the edge. Instantly a hot bolt of pain shot down my arm, concentrated in my wrist. I flexed my muscles and tried to hold it as long as I could. Wildly looking down, I saw the severed tail lying next to the plastic logs, like a gray worm. I swung my other foot and hooked that one as well, anchoring myself.

The pain in my wrist was getting worse, mounting in intensity with each passing second. Suddenly, a cool rush of air came upon me and something collided with my face. I cried out and nearly lost the leverage. As it slid off and tumbled to the ground below, I barely had time to register a flash of red wrapping paper.

A barrage of presents came after that, falling from the pit above me, each one landing on my head, neck, or face. My wrist felt like someone had poured molten lava on it. I looked, barely moving my head to avoid another falling gift, and looked at the thing grasping me. I could see its fingertips beneath my skin, close to breaking through the back of my hand. 

I felt my leverage start to loosen, the muscles in my legs starting to give out from the exertion. They began to relax slowly, slipping ever closer off the edge. My mind spun wildly and I thought of Meredith coming home to find a particularly large gift waiting for her. One foot slipped away. I closed my eyes…

Suddenly, my whole arm was struck by a bolt of pain. I let out another involuntary scream and the blood that was trickling down suddenly became a river, splattering down onto my face. With a sickening *crack*, the pressure suddenly let go and I was falling. The thing had something in its grip, pale and dripping, as it suddenly vanished upwards into the shadows.

I hit the ground and rolled to the side, banging my head on the plastic logs. Breathing heavily, I dragged myself out of the fireplace, leaving a wet trail behind. The presents were soaked with red. Several more come down the chimney.

I dialed on my phone, staining the screen, and set it on the coffee table. The pain in my wrist had intensified to such a degree I didn’t feel it anymore. Ignoring my slippery fingers, I reached for the nearest present.

I barely registered Meredith’s voice. “Well, are you ready to give up on the charade?”

I tore at the paper, but it wasn’t going fast enough, so I ripped the ribbon off with my teeth. I spat it out and lifted the lid.

“I found Misty. Misty’s here. She was in the Fireplace the whole time.”

Inside the box was a severed finger. A wedding ring sparkled just above the knuckle.

“They’re here too. The previous owners. No trouble getting a hold of them now.”

Gifts were still tumbling out of the fireplace, making a large pile that buried the logs. I tore open another one. An eyeball, dry, the blue of the iris faded to a murky gray.

“Matt. Matt. What are you talking about? You sound insane. Are you okay?”

“Just fine!” I cried, tearing the lid off another. An entire set of dog’s teeth, rattling inside the box like a snake. “You have fun…I’ll stay here and open everything!”

The next box was bigger than the others, and heavier. A few long dark hairs hanging out the end of the lid clued me as to what was inside. 

“What? Matt, please…” but I hung up. 

That was about twenty minutes ago. There’s been several more calls but I’ve ignored them all. The presents continue to drop down the chimney, about one a minute. It’s hard to tear the paper and arrange things with only one hand. But I’m managing. 

It’s easy to follow, like putting a Lego set together. Piece after piece. Pretty soon I’ll have the whole family laid out here on the floor. Mom, Dad, Bobby, and Benny. And Misty! Won’t Merry be pleased to have her back?

The gifts are starting to make quite a mountain. Lots of them are dripping. The carpet is soaked and matted. It’s making a terrible mess. I hope I finish before these black spots at the corners of my eyes go away.
