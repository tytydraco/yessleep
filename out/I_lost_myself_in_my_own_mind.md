Every day, every time I woke up, I felt myself becoming a little more detached from my body. I started to observe every movement and action, as if I were in the backseat of my own body, and the person outside was not my true reflection. Instead of taking action, I let myself go.



Today, it finally happened all of a sudden, a huge wave of light came through but instead of my window, where it usually shone, it came from two crystal balls. That lay on the ground. I looked around, and only darkness was in sight. I attempted to grab one of the crystal balls, but its surface was too hot for my hands. I stooped down to the floor so I could clearly see what was inside them. The floor was soft beneath my stomach, but at the same time it had the texture of sand.



Although the light attempted to blind me, I discovered that the brightness enveloping the small space surrounded by this void was a view into my own “eyes”. The eyes I had taken for granted. Taken aback, I stood up and looked around. I walked toward the place where the light ended.

I took a deep breath and moved slightly into the dark. I began to hear faint whispers; with each step I took, it felt as though death was breathing down my neck. I felt heavier, as if my soul itself were holding me down. The whispers grew louder, and more voices joined in. They started shouting but the things they shouted were self-doubt, irony, paranoia, even threats.



Yet it wasn’t directed at me but at themselves, and each time they spoke or shouted, I felt sick. I could barely move.



I crawled until I found a faint light in the distance. I remembered something and looked back; I could still see a single dot of light behind me, the light of my eyes. When I finally reached the light, I saw a moth flying there.



I came upon the circle of light, feeling its brightness on my skin. As I reached it, a silence fell over the voices. I could finally stand and see the moth clearly.



Instinctively, I tried to grab it, but it moved away. Frustration rose in me. It hissed and pulled away each time. I tripped, and the moth fell with me. While I lay on the floor with it, I stared into its eyes, feeling hatred stir within me.



In that moment, I grabbed it. I held it in the palm of my hand. But I didn’t do anything I just looked at it as a storm of violent thoughts flooded my head. As I struggled to fight them, I felt my hand being enveloped by something. And as those thoughts began to win, I tried to see the moth again only to find a cocoon embedded in my hand.

The voices didn’t return, but I felt something staring straight at me. I scanned my surroundings and saw eyes up close, so close I could almost feel them.

 They looked nervous. As they watched me, I doubted every step I took, and I felt that presence behind me again.



But this time, even with so many eyes fixed on me, I decided to turn around. A figure was following me, trailing a mass of bodies that thumped the floor with every step. I stood my ground as it approached. And as it came closer, I felt another weight lift from me.



Before I could do anything, a phone started ringing in the distance. I ignored the figure and looked around. A crack in the darkness revealed a landline phone. As I walked toward it, the figure disappeared from my area.



The phone wasn’t the only thing the light revealed. In the distance I could see a large, flesh-like thing. It moved. It shivered. The darkness didn’t reveal much, but as I walked closer to touch it, each time I laid my hands on it, a deep sound rumbled through the place.



While the phone kept ringing, I finally picked it up. A voice came through, one I didn’t recognize. The person on the other side started talking about a get-together with friends. “Our friends,” he said. He spoke as if he knew me, as if we had been friends for ages, but I couldn’t place his voice. Then he asked, “So do you want to go together?”



I stopped and thought. Did I really know this person? He spoke with such trust in his voice. I wanted to say no, and I was about to, but as the words formed in my mouth, tears welled up. I didn’t know why. Streams of tears began to run down my face, and I started to sob.



I shouted, “YES, YES I WILL GO!” and the line went dead. After I set the phone down and it clicked, another tremor ran through the place, like an earthquake. The thing looming over me began to pour out a dark red substance. It felt like something I’d done wrong, or something I shouldn’t have fought against.



As I looked around to see the effects of the quake, I felt something on my hand where the cocoon was. It had grown a little more. I didn’t know what else to do, so I left the light once again. But I felt better, in a strange way like the relief after cracking your back.



The void caressed me again, and those nervous thoughts no longer loomed over me. I looked behind me: the light shining on the phone was still there, but the light that had once come from my eyes was gone.

This time, the darkness that had once consumed the space now comforted me. I began to hear the shadow walking again. But when I turned around, a light shone from above, revealing a sky filled with hands.



When I looked at it, instead of continuing to walk, it stopped in its tracks. I could hear the hands passing through one another as I stepped carefully into the light. Once I entered it, the shadow inhaled deeply and approached me with a handshake.



As I looked at it, it reminded me of myself. It stood as I stood. But as I began to realize this, the hands in the sky grew ever more desperate; I could hear them moving, and tears of sweat fell from the sky.



The shadow, slightly annoyed, signaled for me to accept the handshake. The moment I took its hand, it moved to strike me. Each time it released something, the void around us shattered with light. And as we exchanged punches the darkness broke a little more, the fight slowly turned into an embrace. 



We laid on the floor broken, looking up at the bright sky once covered in darkness and the ground covered with hands. I looked at it; it looked at me. And together, we stood up as one.



I felt my eyes closing  and when I finally opened them again, I had control over myself at last, and saw reality.
