I awoke to my alarm blaring in my ear. I jabbed blindly at the stop button before glancing at the time. 10:02 A.M.

“Shit! I slept through my fucking alarm again!” I shouted, leaping out of bed. 

I darted around my room, throwing together an outfit, while simultaneously running through my daily hygiene regimen. Yeah, I might have left with mismatched socks, and I may have had my shirt on backwards, but I managed to make it out of the dorm in twenty minutes flat. The administration building was on the other side of campus. I had to run for it if I was going to make it on time. 

I took off into a dead sprint, adrenaline surging through my veins. A sudden thought sent me into a panic as I grinded to a stop. I frantically felt around in my pants. 

“No, no, no. Please don’t tell me.”

And then I found it. The letter. It was protruding from the back pocket of my jeans. 

“Close one,” I muttered as I resumed my mad dash for the admin building. 

By the time I arrived, I was a sweat-soaked, wheezing mess. I stumbled up to the student working the front desk at 10:30 on the nose. I’d made it by the skin of my teeth.

“H-hey. I need to- fuck, that took a lot out of me. Uh, I have an appointment with the dean. Name’s Clayton,” I sputtered, struggling to catch my breath. Both my legs and my lungs were on fire, offering me a not-so-subtle reminder to get my lazy ass in shape. 

“I’m not seeing you in the system. Are you sure you have an appointment?”

“Yeah, I got a note yesterday.” 

The boy eyed me suspiciously. “Oh yeah, where *is* the note, then?”

“It’s right- oh. I must have forgotten it in my dorm room.”

“Well, I’m sorry, then. There’s nothing I can do for-”

“Clayton. Clayton Atkinson, correct?”

A well-dressed woman carrying a clipboard marched up to me. She wore a thin, gray pencil skirt with a gray blazer and a pair of black high heels. If I hadn’t known any better, I would’ve thought *she* was the dean. 

“Uh, yeah, that’s me. Who are you?”

The woman held her chin high, glaring down at me like I was a pile of steaming garbage. “You will address me as Mrs. Thompson. I am the dean’s assistant. Now, follow me. The dean is on a *very* tight schedule, and you are late.”

*Geez, nice to meet you too, lady.* 

We proceeded down the hall and into the elevator. We stood in awkward silence for at least a solid minute on the ride up. I tried my best to break the ice, to no avail. 

“So, it’s been pretty nice outside lately.”

Mrs. Thompson scoffed, failing to offer me so much as a glance. “You have been exercising in it, I see. You smell like you’ve been living in a dumpster filled with rotting meat and raw sewage.”

“Um… thanks for letting me know?”

The gracious *ding* of the elevator couldn’t come quick enough. Of course, the dean’s office happened to be located on the top floor. Just my luck. 

I followed Mrs. Wonderful down a desolate hallway before we reached the door. An engraved, gold-plated plaque jutted from its surface. 

*Dr. Allen Michaels*

I took a deep breath as Mrs. Thompson knocked. This was it. “Dr. Michaels, your 10:30 is here.”

“Bring him in!” a muffled voice requested. Though its tone was jovial, something about it made my skin crawl. 

Mrs. Thompson pushed open the door. Inside, it was eerily dark. The blinds were drawn, and the only light source was that creeping in through the cracks. Once my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could make out a figure sitting behind a desk at the far end of the room. 

“Thank you, Justine. You are dismissed. Clayton, is it? Come, boy. Take a seat.”

I reluctantly obeyed as the door clicked shut behind me, and Mrs. Thompson disappeared from view. Blood pounded in my ears with each step I took. Every synapse in my brain screamed at me to turn around and run, but I fought off the urge. I had to follow through with this. 

Once I reached the desk, I pulled out a chair and anxiously took a seat. My heart began to palpitate wildly in my chest when I got a chance to drink in the dean’s features. 

He was ghostly white, and his hair was slicked back, cheap pomade glistening within. He wore a wide grin on his face, sharp, pointed canines gleaming at me through the inky black. His eyes looked predatory. Hungry. I couldn’t be certain, but for a moment, I could have sworn that I could see a flash of red jolt across his pupils. 

“Mr. Atkinson, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. It’s a shame that it has to be under these circumstances, but it is a pleasure nonetheless,” he stated, that manic grin never wavering. 

“Likewise.” 

“Now, to the matter at hand. I’m sure that you have no doubt in your mind about why I called you here. I wanted to offer my personal condolences in regard to your roommate, Joshua. Rest assured that his family has been notified, and the cost of funeral arrangements have been shouldered by the school. As for you,” he said, propping his elbows onto the desk and resting his chin in his hands, “You must be in a state of shock.”

“Um, yeah. I guess you could say that.”

“Alright, then. I have a proposal for you. Would you like to hear it?” he hummed, his eyes lighting up. I felt like a mouse being cornered by a cat. 

“Yeah. What do you propose?”

“Seeing as this is your freshman year, we will give you a clean slate. We’ll wipe any records of the failing grades you would receive for dropping out at this point in the semester, and we will refund your tuition payment. In return, you can take as much time as you need to grieve, and we will consider you to be reaccepted to the university once your mental state has improved. Would that be sufficient?”

“What about Josh? What are you going to tell his family? They deserve to know the truth.”

“The truth? Joshua took his own life. In his suicide note he requested to be cremated. We were only following through with his final wishes,” he snarled, producing a note from the pile on his desk. 

I read its contents in disbelief. Whoever had written it had emulated Josh’s handwriting perfectly. 

“Wh-what is that? Josh didn’t kill himself. He was murdered by one of those… monsters.”

“Oh, you have it all wrong, my boy. I’m sorry to say that your roommate did take his own life. And besides,” he said, leaning in close to my ear. He whispered softly, barely loud enough to hear, “Nobody will believe you. Just look at what happened when you reported it to the police.” 

My blood turned to ice. I didn’t have a choice. Even if I tried to tell somebody what happened, *I* would end up looking like the crazy one. He had me right where he wanted me. 

“Alright. I will consider it,” I said, taking the letter from my back pocket and extending it to him, “*if* you read my letter of resignation from the school. That’s it. Just a glance, and I’ll be out of your hair forever. You have my word that I won’t tell a soul about anything I’ve experienced in my time here,” I said, staring into the floor as the dean snatched the letter from my grip. 

“Out of my hair forever, you say? I may as well get this over with, then.”

He greedily ripped open the envelope and began to read. In a matter of seconds, his Cheshire grin flipped to a frown. He scowled at me, a menacing hatred pouring from his gaze. 

“You little shit. This isn’t a resignation letter. I swear, I’ll rip you limb from limb.”

Dean Michaels lunged at me, his icy fingers squeezing my throat with a vice grip. I smirked at him through the pain. 

“Tough luck. You just broke rule 6.”

I clenched my eyes shut as he continued to increase the pressure. I could feel myself running out of breath. I clawed and writhed and bit, with no progress. And then, just as I thought I’d pass out, I was freed. 

I hesitantly opened my eyes as the room was bathed in light. Dr. Michaels stood by the window with his hand on the blinds as the smell of burning flesh assaulted my nostrils. I watched in both amazement and disgust as he plunged his clawed fingers into his eye sockets and began to pull erratically. I turned away, unable to stomach the gruesome scene. 

“I no longer want the burden of sight. Dalia, why? Why would you write something so sinister? Why…”

His voice became weaker and weaker as the stench grew stronger. After I could no longer hear his cries, I glanced at the pile of burning flesh before me. Blood was seeping into the carpet from the dean’s empty eye sockets, and his eyeballs were nowhere to be found. I rose to my feet and powered through the rancid odor to make my way over to him. I spat on his decaying corpse, smearing the spittle into the back of his smoldering skull with the heel of my shoe. 

“That’s for all the pain you’ve inflicted. I hope you rot in Hell.”

I gave him one last hearty kick to the nose before I walked out the door. A sense of satisfaction crept over me as I walked away. After all, I planned to keep my end of the bargain. 

As I stepped into the frigid winter air, I could sense an immediate change. Once the veil was lifted, everyone began to see Eaton Hall for what it really was - a structurally failing pile of bricks that should’ve been torn down ages ago. One call to code enforcement was all it took to have the building demolished. I left immediately, so I didn’t have the fortune of seeing the place torn down, but I’m willing to bet that it was a breath-taking sight.

Of course, the school covered up the dean’s death. Headlines claimed that he was hit by a garbage truck while crossing the street. I’m one of the only ones who knows what really happened to him. I hate that I wasn’t able to bring his actions to light, but I revel in the fact that he died a painful, gruesome death. He deserved nothing less. 

I never saw Bryson again. I don’t know what became of him, but I truly hope that he’s gained the peace he sought for so long. Something tells me that he’s moved on to a better place. 

As for me, I’ve decided to go to trade school. I’m thankful for the memories I’ve made, but after everything I’ve been through, I think college life just isn’t [in the cards.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
