Operator Log #31 – 21 October 2024, 23:57

104.6 FM – Pinehaven Mountain Relay

“If anyone’s listening… good evening.”

My own voice quivers in the dusty booth, startled after months of silence.

I am Elise — Operator Thirty‑One — and tonight I restart the lonely pulse of 104.6 FM.

The red ON AIR bulb glows above me like a newly awakened heart.

Every surface smells of cold metal and old coffee. Outside the window: dark pines, the violet scrap of dusk, the slow blink of the tower’s safety light bathing the treetops in blood‑red flashes.

They call this place the Beacon. Music and human voice keep the ‘acoustic anomalies’ beyond the tree line. Last April, Operators Twenty‑Eight and Twenty‑Nine — Evelyn and Daniel — vanished on Fog Day, and the transmitter died with them. No one has broadcast since. Until now.

My first words feel fragile. I shuffle a thin stack of local bulletins:

– tomorrow’s farmer’s market,

– Friday’s roadwork speech by the mayor,

– clear skies, light valley fog after midnight.

Nothing worth the dead air I’m fighting. Still, I read them in a calm tone, as if a whole valley were listening.

Beyond the glass Marcus works the control board. He is Operator Thirty‑Two: beard, sleepless eyes, an engineer’s patience. When he meets my gaze he raises a quiet thumb. Knowing he’s on the other side of the glass steadies me.

Music break. I pick an old jazz instrumental from a directory last touched in 2019, press PLAY, and exhale. The booth fills with brushed cymbals and smoky piano.

I slip into the control room. “Well?” I whisper.

Marcus lifts one earcup. “Not bad for a resurrection,” he says. The meters flicker green. He mentions the tower’s rust, the transmitter’s feeble tubes, the backup generator thrumming below our feet. I nod, but a question claws at me: \*Why did they really shut this place?\* Marcus claims “budget issues,” but his eyes dodge the truth.

There is a dark stain under the studio linoleum — someone spilled coffee long ago, he laughed earlier. It looks more like something that once tried to breathe.

An electronic hiss crackled when we first powered the console today. Within the static I caught a woman’s voice, chopped in half, begging. Marcus blamed returning frequencies. I pretended to agree.

The song ends. Back in the booth I slide the fader up.

“Welcome back to 104.6 FM,” I say, softer now, “your modest beacon on the hill. If you’re driving the switchbacks tonight, take it slow: patchy fog is expected.” I talk about the grocery lady who sold me a sandwich this afternoon, the kind smile she gave me, the worn rosary she pressed into my palm ‘for protection.’ The wooden beads lie in my pocket, cold as the night beyond the window.

Silence presses against the glass. I choose an old local rock track and let it roll.

\*\*\*

Midnight approaches. We decide to close the inaugural show.

“And that’s all for tonight,” I sign‑off, voice steady. “Sweet dreams, Pinehaven, and stay safe out there.”

Stay safe. The words taste odd. My hands tremble when the mic lamp dies.

Marcus suggests we both crash here. The mountain road is treacherous and I am bone‑tired. I agree too quickly; truth is, I don’t want to be alone.

I curl on the lobby couch, blanket up to my chin. The building groans in the wind. From the corridor Marcus checks the generator with a flashlight, then fades into dark.

That’s when the scream rips the night.

A shrill, distant cry — half owl, half human wail — slides through the cracked window. I bolt upright. Marcus reappears instantly, torchbeam shaking.

“Did you hear—” I start.

“Probably a barn owl,” he lies. His fingers drum the flashlight barrel. In the red tower glow I swear I see guilt reflected in his irises.

He seals the window. The lobby is tomb‑silent again, save for our breathing.

“Let’s sleep,” he says. “It’ll feel less scary at sunrise.”

I nod, but I clutch the rosary so hard the beads bruise my palm. A numb cold seeps from the linoleum. I count breaths, waiting for sleep or daylight — whichever arrives first.

\*\*\*

My name is Marcus, Operator Thirty‑Two, and I do not sleep.

I watch Elise from the doorway, curled under the blanket, her face soft in the emergency lamp glow. She doesn’t know I have my father’s shotgun hidden in the closet. She doesn’t know I heard that same scream the night Evelyn and Daniel disappeared.

I step outside into the brittle starlight. The wind tastes of rust and wet pine. At the tower base I smell rot — faint but present. In the grass I find a fresh oval depression, filled with dew: an Amalgamate track.

Twin red eyes flash in my beam. A shadow launches skyward with a whip of vast wings. The air bucks. I duck, heart hammering. When I dare look up, nothing but stars shimmer.

The valley lights flicker far below, unaware. I kick dirt over the track to hide it from Elise.

Inside again, shotgun loaded, I open my old field log.

01:15 – Scream (variant‑Λ)

01:20 – Perimeter patrol.

01:30 – Track under tower (fresh). Odor: sulphur/rot.

01:35 – Eye shine in spruce, launch. Probable winged Amalgamate.

No breach.

I vow she will not vanish like the others. Not on my watch.

\*\*\*

The rest of the night coughs by in static and paranoia. At 04:55 a pale dawn creeps through east windows. I erase the track outside with my boot, lock every door, and hide the shotgun before Elise wakes. She must see only safety here — at least until I have answers.

She stirs. I practice a smile.

Dawn fog hangs over Pinehaven like damp wool. Marcus insists we take his jeep to town — says the mountain road’s easier in four‑wheel drive. I agree: the steering wheel trembles under my hands after a sleepless night.

The valley looks innocent from above: tin roofs catching silver light, a single church spire poking the mist. Yet as we coast into Main Street, eyes follow us from every porch.

The grocery owner, Adelaide, waves me over. Her cardigan is buttoned wrong in her haste.

“Did you pass a calm night, ragazza?” she asks, half Italian endearment, half worried plea.

“Quiet enough,” I lie. She squeezes my arm and whispers, “Remember the rosary.” Behind her, Marcus studies the sidewalk, pretending not to hear.

We walk toward the post office. On a public notice board, a yellowed clipping traps my attention: twin black‑and‑white portraits under a headline:

\*\*SEARCH SUSPENDED — RADIO HOSTS DISAPPEAR\*\*

Evelyn Tenner, Daniel Rhodes. Their smiles stare out between thumbtacks. The article dates six months ago — Fog Day.

Ice trickles down my spine. They never told me the previous hosts were \*missing\*.

Marcus appears, face tight. “Elise, listen—”

“You knew,” I hiss, keeping my voice low. “You brought me up there knowing they vanished.”

He begs to talk in private. We duck into the shadow of the stone church. My breath fogs in the chilly air.

“Yes, I knew,” Marcus admits. His eyes glisten. “Daniel was my friend. Evelyn too. Nobody found a trace but smashed gear and… blood.”

Anger melts into dread. I clutch the rosary beads through my pocket. “So you’re here to protect the next fool who takes the mic?”

“I’m here to protect \*anyone\*,” he says. “And to find out what took them.”

We stand amid the damp bells of morning silence, and I realize I am already entangled. Leaving now would abandon Evelyn and Daniel to rumor and forgetfulness. My voice shakes but steadies at the end: “I won’t quit. Not yet.”

Relief floods his features. Somewhere in that moment we sign an unspoken contract.

A round man in a suit — Mr. Reeves, station owner — barrels down the street, all false cheer and sweaty palms.

“Splendid first broadcast!” he trumpets. “Phones lit up with nostalgia! I’ll pop by the station later with a fresh business line.”

He calls the disappearance an “incident,” pats Marcus on the back, and waddles off to the mayor’s office. I watch him go thinking: the valley keeps its ghosts politely hidden.

\#

Later, back at the Beacon, we spend the afternoon reinforcing locks, cleaning shards the size of fingernails from forgotten corners, and installing a timer that will blast music at 104 dB if silence lasts more than fifteen seconds. We nickname it the \*\*Bell failsafe\*\*.

At dusk Marcus drives to town for supplies. I stay alone, cataloging ancient CDs. The quiet hum of the air handler is almost soothing — until it isn’t.

A low, resonant moan leaks through the ventilation grate. Not the shriek of last night, but a tremor at the edge of hearing, like a cello string bowed in the basement. It rises, falls, and fades.

I press my ear to the metal vent. Cooled air brushes my cheek. Nothing now. Still, my gut twists: someone — or something — is testing our walls.

Marcus returns before full dark. I tell him about the cello‑moan. He swears and checks the basement hatch. Dust, cobwebs, stale diesel. No footprints.

He sets the shotgun within reach behind a stack of old reel‑to‑reel tapes.

“We’ll take shifts tonight,” he says. I don’t argue.

\#

\*\*Second Night Broadcast\*\*

The clock hits 22:00. On Air lamp flicks red. I breathe.

“Good evening, Pinehaven. Operator Thirty‑One keeping you company. Clear skies tonight, though fog may creep in after two.”

A caller surprises me — crackling landline, elderly voice: “Miss Elise, bless the Beacon for lighting up again.”

I thank her. The line goes dead with a soft click and the silence feels heavier than any scream.

Between songs I read a poem Evelyn once recited on a surviving tape: \*‘Even darkness owns its music.’\* My throat tightens on the last line.

At midnight I hand off the mic to Marcus for equipment talk. His voice is steady, softer than his stance. Outside the booth window I think I see shapes shifting among the pines, but the tower light reveals nothing.

We end the show at 00:30. Timer armed. Doors barred. The Beacon hums through the small hours.

At 03:17 the moan returns, louder. It vibrates the floorboards. Somewhere downstairs glass shatters.

Marcus grabs the shotgun; I clutch a jar of consecrated salt Adelaide pressed on me ‘just in case.’

We descend the stairwell, flashlights slicing dust. A basement window lies smashed inward, glittering shards on the concrete. Moonlight reveals something darker: a smear of oily residue leading to the generator room.

We follow, hearts pounding. The residue pools beneath the fuel tank, but the metal is intact. In the corner sits an object — a single feather, glossy black, longer than my forearm. Its quill end drips the same oil.

I feel the room tilt, as if gravity points toward the feather.

“Winged Amalgamate,” Marcus mutters. He stuffs the feather into a fireproof bag. “It’s marking territory.”

The fuel gauge reads full. The Beacon still purrs. The thing hasn’t come for the power — yet.

We sweep the perimeter, patch the window with plywood, and wait for dawn.

Morning, 08:12.

We drive into town to buy plywood, sheet metal, extra fuses. Adelaide greets us with two thermos flasks of chicory coffee and a silent look that says \*I heard it too.\* She doesn’t ask for details; she simply slips a small vial of holy water into my coat pocket.

At the church we find Father Vittorio polishing the brass thurible. Marcus presents the feather. The priest’s face drains of color.

“I buried one like this after the \*Great Lull\* of ’89,” he whispers. He blesses a pouch of rock salt, adds three silver slugs from an old reliquary, and warns us not to let the Beacon fall quiet. “Sound is your shield,” he repeats, tapping his temple.

We reinforce every vent with wire mesh, bolt the plywood over the basement window, smear salt paste along sill edges and door thresholds. Marcus reroutes a second speaker line directly to the tower so the Bell failsafe will pulse through the steel lattice if triggered.

As the sun sets we test the system: cut the main audio bus. Exactly fifteen seconds later the Bell fires — a sub‑audible boom felt in the sternum rather than heard. Good.

\#

\*\*Third Night Broadcast\*\*

A pale crescent moon floats above the treetops. The forest looks carved from gunmetal.

I open with David Bowie’s \*“Sound and Vision.”\* Marcus monitors the spectrum analyzer; I see relief in his shoulders whenever the smooth green bars stay fat.

22:47 — a call from a logging trucker on Route 17. Static claws his voice.

“Signal’s strong at the old quarry,” he says, “but fog’s creeping down the ridgeline like smoke.”

I warn him to keep headlights on low beam, thank him, cut back to Bowie.

23:12 — loud clicking in the headset. I glance at Marcus; he thumbs open the shotgun but shakes his head: interference only.

23:29 — every VU meter jumps, pegged red, though I hear no change. Marcus kills the music; the meters drop. He frowns, restarts the track. Red again. He traces the feed and discovers a phantom carrier at 19 kHz modulating the program bus — too high for human ears.

A chill runs down my spine: \*something\* is broadcasting \*into\* us.

“Kill the line to Tower Aux,” he mutters. The meters settle. For now.

At 00:02, fog swallows the building. The world outside the windows is blank.

00:15 — a staccato tapping at the basement door, like claws on steel. The Bell timer looms in my mind: 15 s threshold. If we abandon the mic more than fifteen it will fire.

Marcus gestures stay put; he descends with the shotgun. I keep the needle on a looping jazz track, but my mind counts seconds anyway.

00:18 — a thud through the floorboards.

00:20 — the music hesitates, as if the air itself absorbs the saxophone line.

00:22 — Marcus shouts through the intercom: “It’s in the crawlspace!”

He fires once. The shot rolls up the ductwork like thunder. A scream replies — metallic, layered over five octaves, as if multiple throats sing at once. The floor vibrates through my shoes.

I slam the TALK button and read weather updates, traffic bulletins, recipes—anything to keep my voice running.

00:27 — shotgun boom again. Salt rounds. A hiss like boiling tar.

00:30 — the ON AIR lamp flickers. Power dip. The jazz loop stutters.

I punch in the Bell override code but hold my finger over ENTER. If Marcus is still down there—

A growl echoes up the stairwell. Marcus bursts into view, dragging a blackened, smoking wing torn at the joint. His arm bleeds from elbow to knuckle.

“Hit it,” he rasps.

I mash ENTER.

The building shudders. A low-frequency wave collapses the silence — the Bell failsafe detonating through every speaker, the tower lattice, even the metal shelves. My teeth vibrate. Light tubes in the hall explode into snowy shards.

Through the lobby window a silhouette staggers: humanoid torso, wings like burnt sailcloth, head shifting between beak and eyeless mask. The Bell pulse does not kill it but stuns; it convulses, oil‑slick feathers ripping free, red sparks darting across its surface like veins of lightning under skin.

Marcus racks another shell. We back toward the studio where the main amps still blast Bowie at an ear‑splitting level. The creature recoils from the sound, yet claws the wall seeking silence.

I grab the vial from Adelaide, splash holy water across the threshold. It hisses on contact with the oily residue, leaving pitted scars in the linoleum. The thing retreats, screeching, and slams through the side exit, wings scraping concrete.

Silence?

No. In the monitors I see the carrier at 19 kHz still riding the master bus — stronger than before.

Marcus jams a patch cable into the reel deck, queues a 1 kHz test tone at full gain, and floods the feed with pure sine wave. The phantom carrier distorts, wavers, breaks apart like shattered glass on the analyzer.

In the sudden clarity I hear a voice:

“Operator… Twenty‑Eight… still… here…”

Evelyn’s timbre, broken and faint. Then static.

The red meters fall to normal. Bowie’s chorus returns: \*Don’t you wonder sometimes, about sound and vision…\*

We leave the transmission running until 04:00, then sign off with a brief message of calm traffic and clear skies, though the fog still gnaws at the edges of the parking lot.

\#

Dawn. The parking lot is mangled: grooves where claws raked asphalt, black feathers glued to headlights. But the Beacon still stands, humming.

Marcus patches his arm and logs the encounter.

Damage:

– south exit door destroyed,

– Bell transformer burned out (requires rewind),

– phantom carrier neutralized via sine purge.

Casualties: none.

He sketches the creature: humanoid trunk, avian arms, head fluid between bone and beak. Variant‑Λ confirmed.

I brew coffee so strong it scalds my throat. The phone rings; Adelaide’s voice quivers: “The fog has lifted, cara. I think your song kept it away.”

I don’t correct her.

Marcus and I step outside. The first sunrays strike the tower dish; frost sparkles on the cables. Salt paste streaks the doors like war paint. For a heartbeat I believe we’ve won.

Then I see it: a feather planted upright in the center of the roof, quill pierced deep into tar. A calling card. And next to it — a twisted piece of studio cable tied into a noose.

Marcus follows my gaze, jaw tight. “Round three,” he says, “starts at sunset.”

Late morning. We scrub clotted oil from the lobby floor. Marcus rewinds the charred Bell transformer with copper wire stripped from an old generator coil; his fingers bleed, but he works with furious precision.

A car door slams outside. Mr. Reeves waddles in, face flushed, clutching a boxy business phone and glossy flyers: “Great buzz in town! People say you two are heroes.”

He freezes when he sees the shredded door and salt lines. “What in God’s name—”

“Wildlife broke in,” Marcus says flatly.

“Sure,” Reeves mutters, eyes flicking to the shotgun propped by the console. He sinks his bulk into a chair that creaks in protest. “Listen, keep the drama off air. Advertisers love local color, not horror stories.”

I bite back a retort. Marcus hands him a soldering gun. “Help us fix the Bell, then.”

Reeves pales, fake smile dissolving. “I… have a meeting in town.” He drops the phone on the desk and retreats, murmuring about liability insurance.

When his car disappears down the hill Marcus snorts. “Figures. Radio’s only a cash register to him.”

\*\*

Noon light slants through broken blinds. We eat cold sandwiches over the schematic of the failsafe. Marcus points to a marginal note Evelyn scribbled years ago: \*‘Sound is sanctuary. Silence is invitation.’\*

He folds the paper, pockets it like scripture.

At 14:00 Father Vittorio arrives in his dented Fiat, trunk loaded with relics:

– A brass thurible filled with lavender and rock salt,

– Five more silver slugs,

– Two old gramophone horns modified into \*\*directional sirens\*\*.

He blesses the rebuilt transformer, then nails a cedar cross over the new plywood panel. “If the creature marks territory,” he says, “reply with a stronger mark of your own.”

Marcus installs the horns on the tower catwalk, wiring them to a separate amplifier that will play continuous pink noise should the main line fail again.

I hang a new ON AIR bulb, fresher red, almost cheerful. Almost.

\*\*

Sunset bleeds orange over the ridgeline. Fog hasn’t formed yet, but a weird stillness presses the branches flat, as though the forest itself holds its breath.

We suit up: earplugs, headsets, salt grenades (mason jars stuffed with road salt and holy water), Marcus’s shotgun, my vial of holy water refilled. The Bell transformer hums with newborn energy.

19:30 — The Beacon radiates a steady 250 watts of Bowie, then Queen. I start tonight’s show with \*“Under Pressure.”\*

Calls trickle in: fishermen at the dam, teenagers on the overlook road, Adelaide from her shop. Every voice sounds grateful, but hushed, as if they fear speaking too loud might draw shadows to their doorstep.

At 21:12 static erupts. The phantom 19 kHz carrier returns, pulsing in sync with our VU meters, but this time atop it rides a fragmented whisper: \*“Elise… Elise…”\* Then the signal cuts. Silence.

The Bell timer begins its 15‑second death march.

Marcus lunges for the deck and slams the PLAY button on a reel labeled \*TEST TONE 120 dB.\* Pink noise floods the tower horns, the studio monitors, the valley below. The timer resets.

Through the control‑room window I spot movement: shapes rushing between trees, retreating from the noise bloom.

Marcus keeps the tone running thirty seconds, then crossfades to a thumping industrial track. “Let’s make the Beacon scream tonight,” he says.

22:08 — We switch to live commentary. I read a list of phone numbers for emergency road assistance. Marcus describes the rebuilt Bell and thanks Father Vittorio by name. The priest, listening on a battery radio in town, rings the station phone to promise prayers.

22:40 — First fog tendrils snake across the parking lot. The tower light stains them crimson.

23:00 — Our spotlights catch a hunched figure at the treeline. Too tall, limbs folded wrong. It paces the perimeter, talons slicing frost.

23:14 — The figure splits: wings peel from its back, and a second, smaller silhouette tumbles free, skittering on all fours. Two now.

Marcus loads silver slug #1. I grip the salt grenade.

“Remember,” he says, voice low, “sound first, bullets second.”

At 23:30 the smaller creature sprints, impossibly fast, striking the south door. The impact warps the steel inward. The jazz loop stutters but keeps playing. Timer safe.

Second impact dents the door further. Hinges shriek.

“Open the hatch!” Marcus shouts. Together we yank the backstage trapdoor and crawl into the maintenance tunnel beneath the lobby. Soundproof rock wool muffles the broadcast above; here the music is just a ghostly thud.

The tunnel ends at a grated vent under the south steps. Through it we see talons prying the doorframe. Oil drips like ink.

Marcus signals: three, two, one— He shoves the shotgun muzzle through the grate and fires. The slug punches a fist‑sized hole in the creature’s hip. It howls, staggered.

I roll the salt grenade through the gap. Glass breaks, brine and crystals explode in a white bloom. The creature screams higher, flailing.

Above us I hear the transmitter hiccup. The ON AIR lamp flickers. Timer ticking: eight, nine—

Marcus yells “Cover!” He grabs my collar and hauls me back down the tunnel just as a winged mass smashes the steps overhead. Dust rains. The lamp dies. Timer thirteen—

I rip my phone from my pocket, open the voice memo app, and start recording. My own voice fills the mic: “ELISE LIVE, 104.6 FM, WARNING—” The phone’s speaker plays it back a split second later. Feedback squeals, but sound is sound. The timer resets.

The main power flickers back. Bowie surges through the floor again. The lamp glows red.

We crawl out the east hatch, gasping in the storage closet. Marcus slams the fuse box shut; arcs dance inside but hold.

Outside the south steps, the crippled creature drags itself away, leaving a smear of feathers and brackish fluid.

The larger Amalgamate still circles. Its gaze locks onto the tower horn emitting pink noise. In two beats it launches skyward, claws anchoring on the catwalk. The horn sparks under its grip.

Marcus yanks the Bell override lever.

A colossal pulse detonates across the catwalk, reverberating through every steel joint. The creature convulses, wings flaring wide, then slips — tumbling past the window in a silent arc before it vanishes in the fog.

We hold our breath. Ten seconds. No return.

At 00:05 I kill the test tone and switch to \*Queen – “Radio Ga Ga.”\* The Beacon sings. Fog rolls back from the lot like curtains lifting.

Marcus slumps against the wall, shoulders shaking. “Two silver slugs left,” he mutters. “I hope we won’t need them.”

But both of us know the Beacon will never truly be safe again.

04:47. Pale blue leaks over the horizon. Steam rises from the Beacon’s roof where holy‑salt residue still sizzles in bullet holes.

We survey the damage:

– South door bowed like a tin drum,

– Catwalk horn crumpled but still humming faint pink noise,

– Lobby linoleum curdled into black icicles where the grenade burst.

Yet the transmitter meter glows steady green. We are, impossibly, still on air.

Marcus re‑arms the auto‑tone failsafe, then collapses in the lobby chair. I fetch the first‑aid kit. Under gauze his arm oozes but the bleeding has slowed.

“I heard Evelyn,” I whisper while wrapping his bandage. “During the carrier break. She said ‘still here.’”

He closes his eyes. “Daniel used to say sound leaves fingerprints in the ether. Maybe she’s trapped in the anomaly’s echo.”

Outside we hear engines. A small convoy creeps up the hill: Adelaide’s van, two pickup trucks, Father Vittorio’s Fiat, and a county cruiser with lights off.

Villagers climb out: weathered men, teenagers clutching baseball bats, mothers holding thermos flasks. Adelaide approaches holding a tray of steaming cornbread.

“We had a feeling the fog came calling,” she says. She sets the tray on the hood of Marcus’s jeep and gently touches the dented south door. Her fingers come away black.

Don Vittorio murmurs prayers while shaking salt around the lot. A deputy photographs claw marks, shaking his head.

Adelaide draws me aside. “Six months ago I heard the tower go silent. That same stink of rotting feathers drifted into town.” Her eyes well. “They never found Evelyn or Daniel. But maybe now, with your noise, their souls can answer.”

She presses a folded paper into my palm: a short obituary clipping for the two lost hosts, dated one week after Fog Day.

The deputy finds a trail of oily footprints leading into the treeline but no body. At the edge of the forest, Marcus and I discover a shallow pit of disturbed soil. Inside: two intertwined gold rings, initials \*E.T.\* and \*D.R.\* engraved.

We place them in a linen pouch. Father Vittorio blesses the rings, voice cracking. Adelaide weeps softly.

A makeshift memorial forms on the transmitter deck: candles in mason jars, a Polaroid of Evelyn holding a radio mug, a cassette tape labeled \*“Night Shift 17‑04.”\*

Marcus bites his lip. “They never got a funeral.”

We hold one now. Don Vittorio recites Psalm 46. Adelaide hums an old hymn. The deputy fires a single salute from his service pistol into the fog.

When the candles gutter, Marcus and I climb to the booth. We patch in Evelyn’s cassette. Her voice, crisp and bright, fills the valley:

“You are never alone in the dark, Pinehaven — you have us.”

I lean toward the mic. “This is Elise, Operator Thirty‑One, speaking across time. We hear you, Evelyn. Thank you for standing watch.”

I let the tape run, her vintage jazz segue humming, then crossfade to modern soft piano. The sun clears the ridge.

\*\*

Over the next week the Beacon becomes a fortress:

– New steel door welded.

– Catwalk horn replaced with surplus stadium speakers.

– Backup transmitter tuned, set to auto‑loop Bowie if main line fails.

Marcus maps anomaly activity: tracks appear only under full moon or dense fog and always near silence zones. Sound truly is sanctuary.

Calls increase nightly — townsfolk volunteering weather reports, truckers reading highway mile markers, children singing lullabies down crackling lines. The valley surrounds us with noise, like hundreds of small beacons echoing ours.

On the seventh day Reeves returns, a sheepish grin and a sponsorship deal for “Harlan’s Hardware & Feed.” He stares at the silver slugs on the console and nearly faints when Marcus demonstrates a salt grenade.

Reeves signs a budget for reinforced shutters and extra diesel.

The community, once wary, now treats us like wardens of the night. Baskets of vegetables pile by the lobby door; a teenage metal band drops off homemade jingles (“Stay LOUD, Pinehaven!” screamed over distorted guitars).

\*\*But the forest remains uneasy.\*\*

Each dawn Marcus checks the roof: twice he finds small feathers arranged in concentric spirals, like sonar rings. We collect them, burn them with incense, scatter the ashes into the river.

\*\*

One afternoon I search the archive room and uncover Evelyn’s final logbook, singed at the edges. Last entry: \*“Bell fuse humming. Daniel outside checking tower. Anomaly may be learning. Must stay louder.”\*

I transcribe the note into our current log. The realization bites: the enemy adapts.

That night, while music plays, Marcus and I sit in the control room, rings of Evelyn and Daniel between us.

“If we ever fall quiet…” he begins.

“We won’t,” I answer, but my gaze drifts to the south door dent, permanently imprinted like an open wound.

He closes his fingers over mine, warm despite the scar on his knuckle. “Then we owe them a promise. Keep the Beacon lit.”

I nod. Above us the ON AIR bulb bathes our clasped hands in blood‑red light.

Week 4. The full moon rises like a scarred coin over Pinehaven. Marcus finishes his newest defense: the \*\*Siren Shield\*\* — six repurposed PA horns mounted in a ring around the tower’s midpoint, each fed by its own 300‑watt amp. When triggered they emit phase‑shifted pink noise, creating a rotating acoustic wall.

“Think of it as a lighthouse whose beam is sound, not light,” he explains. Together we calibrate delay taps so the noise sweeps the treetops every six seconds.

22:00 broadcast opens with \*“Learning to Fly”\* by Pink Floyd — our private joke. I read harvest‑market announcements; Marcus details the Siren Shield for the listeners, framing it as a ‘signal‑boost experiment.’ Truth is, we expect company.

22:47 — a cold spike rolls across the valley. The thermometer drops six degrees in a minute. Fog seeds itself from nothing, crawling uphill like a live thing.

22:59 — the phantom 19 kHz carrier slams back, stronger than ever, super‑imposed over our program. My headphones pop with static. I shout weather updates louder, but the carrier grows.

Marcus triggers the Siren Shield. Six horns roar, sweeping. The carrier flutters, then stabilizes again, doubling in amplitude. An echoing voice crackles through the studio monitors, genderless, layered:

“Silence the beacon.”

Every screen flickers. The ON AIR bulb dims to sunrise‑pink. Timer still running, but the override code unresponsive.

The studio glass clouds from within, ice crystals forming fractal feathers. On the far side of the pane a silhouette appears: Evelyn — spectral, translucent, headset still on, mouth moving in panic.

I gasp her name. The figure raises a transparent hand, pointing downward. A hiss like distant brakes bleeds through the monitors.

Marcus yells, “The crawlspace!”

We sprint to the maintenance hatch. Below, oily mist pours from every vent, condensing into amorphous masses along the corridor. Unformed anomalies — smaller, larval perhaps — squirm toward the wooden joists, gnawing at them like termites.

“They’ll collapse the tower,” Marcus shouts. He hurls a salt grenade. Explosion of brine, shrieks, retreat. Too many, though.

I rip open the PA patch bay, connect the Siren Shield directly to the main amplifier, and feed a 2 kHz sine sweep climbing to 120 dB. The horns outside scream. The floor vibrates.

The larval anomalies writhe, shriveling under the tone. Through the hatch Evelyn’s apparition flickers, then steadies, mouthing two words: \*\*“Keep rising.”\*\*

I understand: raise the frequency.

Marcus cranks the sweep upward. 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 5 kHz… Human‑pain threshold. Our ears throb even through plugs. The anomalies liquefy, dripping back into cracks.

8 kHz; glass panels in the control room fracture like spiderwebs. The Siren Shield wails atop the tower in a pitch no animal in the valley will forget.

At 9.6 kHz the phantom carrier tears — a clean break on the analyzer, like a rope sliced. The voice screaming \*Silence the beacon\* vanishes.

I kill the sweep, switch to low‑volume ambient music. The ON AIR bulb snaps back to full red. Marcus slumps against the wall, blood trickling from one ear. My head rings, but the air feels lighter, unhunted.

On an impulse I return to the booth, mic live:

“Operator Twenty‑Eight, transmission received. The beacon remains alight.”

A faint burst of static answers — almost like laughter, wistful and relieved.

\*\*

Dawn. We replace broken window panes, mop brine from the crawlspace, scrape oily residue into sealed jars for Father Vittorio to bury in sanctified ground.

Marcus logs the event:

\*Carrier neutralized via ultrasonic sweep. Apparition suggests cognitive remnant of Operator #28 persists within anomaly network. Siren Shield effective above 8 kHz but risks structural damage. Recommend sonic ladder protocol only under extreme threat.\*

We both know “extreme threat” is inevitable.

In town, word spreads about the midnight shriek. Some blame faulty PA tests; others whisper of angels fighting demons above the ridge.

Adelaide sends cinnamon rolls. Each pastry bears a tiny sugar‑glaze circle with six radial spokes — her tribute to the Siren Shield.

\*\*

That evening, before airtime, I place Evelyn and Daniel’s intertwined rings beside the fader. Marcus dims the booth lights. We share a minute’s silence — the only silence the Beacon will tolerate — in honor of voices trapped between frequencies.

At 22:00 sharp the music returns, louder than ever.

Two days of brittle sunshine follow, though fog fingers linger in the gullies like bruises that won’t heal. Marcus rebuilds the backup generator’s muffler so its drone shifts above 120 Hz — less attractive to anomalies, he claims.

He also installs a seismograph app on the control‑room tablet: apparently the Amalgamate flaps register as blips in the 3–5 Hz range. If the needle jumps again we’ll have sixty seconds’ warning.

Mr. Reeves arrives unannounced, sweating under a polyester blazer.

“You two are broadcasting weaponized sirens now?” He waves a thick folder of listener complaints about last night’s ‘sky‑scream.’

“Better annoyed than eaten,” Marcus grunts. The station owner rubs his temples, then signs the purchase order for extra glass panes and acoustic foam — muttering something about “cost of doing business.”

Minutes after Reeves leaves, two carabinieri pull up. They ask about reports of gunfire, explosions, possible black‑market fireworks. Marcus shows them the dented door, the feathers sealed in specimen bags, the clergy‑certified salt lines. The officers exchange a baffled look, jot notes, and retreat politely. No one wants to write that report.

Late afternoon, Marcus spreads blueprints across the console. He draws a diagram: our tower as one node; Evelyn’s residual signal trapped in an echo pocket; anomalies feeding on \*negative\* space (silence) between nodes.

“Think of it like standing waves in a pipe,” he says. “The Beacon’s sound has to cancel the silence pocket or it stays resonant — that’s where Evelyn’s voice gets stuck.”

We need to create a \*\*counter‑resonance\*\*, directing all six Siren horns plus the studio monitors and tower dish into a focused beam constrained by time sync. In theory, flooding the pocket with perfectly out‑of‑phase noise could break the loop and set her free.

“Or rip the ether wide open,” I point out.

“Either way,” Marcus says, “we find out.”

We schedule the test for the next full fog bank, predicted tomorrow night. Father Vittorio volunteers to transmit continuous prayer from the church PA at the same frequency, bolstering our node network.

Adelaide bakes rye bread laced with lemon balm “for nerves.” The deputy loans us his personal rifle: “In case sound fails, use lead.”

Test Eve, 23:30. Fog seeps under doorframes. The thermometer plunges: classic harbinger. Marcus powers up all amps, aligns horn phase to microseconds.

The control room vibrates with low‑grade hum, like we’re inside a sleeping beast’s chest cavity.

We pin a handwritten card above the fader:

\*\*Objective: Break the Pocket — Set Her Free — Remain Loud\*\*
