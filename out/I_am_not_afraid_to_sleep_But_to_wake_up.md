I looked out of the window. It is not very clean, but I could still see through it. There were many people walking outside on the sidewalk near My home. I could join them, and I would join them. I wanted to join them. So much. But they were not joined. I can’t think of a reason for why this is happening. I don't like this. It may be because of the mistake. “I can not do this.”

There was a Silhouette hiding in the shadow in the corner of my room. It is a humanoid figure. One arm is longer than the other one. Upon looking harder. You would notice that It is slowly moving.

“l-l-leave,” I sputtered. But then I woke up. I checked my schedule on a piece of paper. It read, “BRUSH TEETH-TAKE SHOWER-EAT FOOD-LOOK OUTSIDE-RETURN-EXIT-DON’T-BASEMENT”. After following the instructions, I came upon a problem.

I decided to enter the basement. The Silhouette. This move was foolish of me.

“Come into the basement,” it said.

I tripped. When I woke up next morning I glanced over at the schedule. It read, “REMEMBER IT”. I Dont want to remember it. It makes me feel bad. I saw the silhouette again. He is standing in the corner. It feels colder now that it’s there. My right ankle stung. I could not move from the brown couch. I closed his eyes, then felt a breath on my neck. ice.

The silhouette shushed me, “Don’t worry.” “Your eyes won’t open for a long time.”

I looked out of the yellowed window. “They are gone, I cannot join them, but I really wanted to join them" There is a knife is on the floor. this brown couch here couch was all the  more uncomfortable.

“Enter Imagination,” The Silhouette said.

Imagination may be why I am here. They all know about it. Before entering the imagination, I grabbed a toy truck. The handle was moist but I wiped it on my shirt. I fell into the imagination. He remembered it. It was not good. I have made a mistake. I dropped the truck and tried to run back to the door but the sky was gone. The light was gone. I tripped over my own ankle. They all know about the mistake. They just knew that they would get me. Imagination made sure I knew. Imagination was horrific. It is not kind to me. I could hear a silhouette behind me. Silhouette was coming closer. But I will not make this mistake again. I opened my eyes.

I have now been awake for the past 19 hours. I really need to go back to sleep. But when I wake up, It may be there. I have locked myself in my room for the majority of this time, but I have water jugs and sandwich supplies. This is one hell of a night. My eyelids are feeling very heavy, but I can not go back to sleep. I have been scrolling through youtube shorts for a long time. I don't want to leave. It might be right outside my room. If any of you can help me, I will reply to as many as I can. I have done everything I can, but I might fall asleep soon.
