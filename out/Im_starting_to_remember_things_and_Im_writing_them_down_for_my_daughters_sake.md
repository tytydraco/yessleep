At first, all I felt was the wet pavement and gravel shifting beneath my cheek. Then the rest of my sensation returned and all I could think about was how everything clung to me. My gums refused to part. My arms trapped my knotted hair, and under my limp hand lay something cool and sticky. I turned it over and lifted my face to see an empty Vodka bottle. In my other hand was my phone, cracks spread across the screen. I tried to turn it on, but between the rain and the damage, nothing happened.

My focus shifted to my duffel bag lying sideways not too far from me. Then it refocused on the figure approaching down the alleyway. Lines wobbled across my vision on a horizontal path and the figure wobbled with them. He became distinct bit by bit: a baseball hat tucked into a blue hoodie, my favorite shade of blue, and my favorite team’s logo stitched on the front. Black boots. Despite the cool air, my face heated up. I sent up a prayer that he wasn’t a judgmental person.

“Woah there! Do you need help?”

I jerked my head up at the sound, slightly scraping my chin in the process.

“Maybe. Who are you?” Now that I could see his face, I felt more comfortable.

Something about his eyes and smile calmed my nerves, especially matched with his outfit.

“Jackson.”

He grabbed me around the waist and lifted me. He didn’t even ask, but his arms felt better than the rough pavement so I made no comment. Jackson’s clothes were warm like he just pulled them out of the dryer. With his other arm, he grabbed my duffel bag. “I’m the owner of the place you’re staying, remember?”

As I tried to regain my balance, an image of Jackson’s face from a screen flashed through my mind.

“Oh- oh my god. What time is it?”

“A little past 3 am. You didn’t show up to check in last night, so I thought maybe the directions weren’t clear and came looking. Pregame gone a bit too far?” He gestured to the bottle.

“Yeah..I guess so.” I looked down at it. “I don’t even remember buying this. I don’t drink Vodka. I’m a tequila girl.”

Jackson patted my back a little harder than I think he meant to.

“Maybe someone bought it for you.” He took the bottle from my hands and slung my arm over his shoulder then lifted up my chin and looked closely at the scrape. “Let’s get you home to rest. This scrape doesn’t look too bad. I think we can live with it until it heals.”

It was less than five minutes before we reached the apartment, a loft tucked into a back neighborhood of the city. The key scraped against the lock with a sound that hurt my head. I felt like I had heard something like it before, but I couldn’t place the memory. The inside was small and a little too dark to see well, but I noticed a vase of flowers on the table. They were marigolds, my favorite flower. Jackson led me straight through the kitchen to a bedroom on the left. There were locks on the outside and inside of the door. I didn’t question it. The site info on the place promised safety measures, and I was sure Jackson occasionally got some pretty shifty guests. At least, I hoped my drunk ass wasn’t his worst.

“There’s tea and coffee in the cabinet. We have to share a bathroom but don’t worry. I’m not in there much. If you need anything I’m across the hall, kay’?”

I nodded and flashed a sheepish smile as I shivered in my wet clothes. “Are there any extra blankets? It’s a little cold in here.”

“Of course! In the cabinet by the bed. I’ll turn on the heat too. We’re having a cold August I guess.”

He lingered for a moment after I thanked him until it became clear that I had everything I needed. Once he left, I set up my stuff and pulled out my shower things. The bathroom light had a tint to it that bathed the white walls in fluorescent green. It buzzed slightly as if a fly was somewhere on the ceiling, or maybe that was in my head. I stripped off my clothes, glad to wash away the grime of the street, and stepped behind the curtain. The hot shower made me feel like melting. Steam slowly started forming, and I let it drift around me until I was breathing more water than air. Every part of me felt like melted chocolate, warm and soft.

After a long sigh, my eyes flicked open and focused on the green-tinted tiles around me. Something caught my eye toward the bottom of the wall, where the tile met the acrylic, white bath. Three words were shallowly etched into the tile: COVER THE HOLES.

Crouching, I ran my finger over the words and then looked around. Maybe it meant the drain? Or maybe I was overthinking it and it was a vague quote. Whatever it was, my body no longer felt the warmth of the water. My fingertips were clammy and cold as I clutched the shower curtain to pull myself up. On the way up, I found them. Tiny holes were drilled into the wall on the far side of the shower, right at chest level. I knew they were probably nothing to be concerned about, and I knew if they were I should look away Still, I couldn’t manage to pull my gaze from them. My brain imagined all sorts of things, but the main vision in my head was a pair of hungry eyes staring through on the other side. I decided not to look. My hand had never left the curtain, and I used it mainly as support as I stepped out of the tub, trying my best to seem normal.

It took me a moment, as I dried off with the towel, to realize that the wet clothes I had dumped on the floor were gone. I took a look around, wondering if I left them on the sink or in the corner. The dread didn’t fully set in until I was sure they weren’t there.

After grabbing my things and wrapping the towel around me, I peeked out the bathroom door and jumped. It was still dark, but I could make out a tall figure standing in the hall. It turned its head to me slowly, and I realized with relief that my phantom was just Jackson.

“Hey, sorry to scare you!” He patted the washing machine set into the wall beside him. “I just thought I’d throw your wet clothes in the wash.”

“Oh.” I stepped out of the bathroom and felt a flush rising to my cheeks when Jackson looked my towel-clad body up and down. “You took them off the floor?”

His eyes traveled back up to my face.

“Yeah…I hope that doesn’t make you too uncomfortable. I just had to start this load and…”

“No! I mean, of course, I understand. I’m just going to-” I nodded to my room and clutched the top of my towel tighter. “I’ll see you later.”

I disappeared into my room and fell against the door after closing it. I would be there for a week. Plenty of time to make things less awkward, right?

I felt the blush returning to my cheeks when I remembered how he looked at me.

Jackson wasn’t a bad-looking guy, and he seemed attentive. It may have felt awkward that he was in the bathroom while I showered, but he knows the curtain isn’t transparent and he was just getting my clothes. My heartbeat slowed down to its regular rhythm and I decided to lay down for a few hours before daylight set in. I didn’t want to think about the shower and its strange message, but I decided the following day I would let Jackson know about the issue. It only took a few minutes after I collapsed onto the bed to fall asleep.

I noticed it in the morning when there was enough light streaming through the curtains to get a good look around. Carpet. The walls were covered in carpet. It was the beady, tan carpet that you slightly sink into when you step on it, and it was everywhere. It spread from the center of the room to the bottom of the walls. Then it crawled up the walls, over the place you would normally have baseboards, and only stopped at the stark white ceiling. The room suddenly felt smaller, tight…uncomfortable. I needed to get out, to breathe.

I pulled on a shirt and some cozy shorts and tiptoed out of the room. It didn’t sound like Jackson was home, but I was still feeling embarrassed about the fiasco the night before.

“Fiascos,” I mumbled to myself.

To my surprise, the kitchen was half-painted. Jackson was in the middle of renovating, which I didn’t remember seeing in the site info. He was painting the walls the same shade of blue that he was wearing the night before. It must be his favorite color too.

I scanned the kitchen and found a note stuck to the fridge.

“I’m at work, but I usually get back around four. Help yourself to anything.”

There was a little smiley face drawn below it, and I smiled slightly. I replaced the water in the vase and helped myself to the tea in the cupboard. He only had Earl Grey, but it’s always been my favorite so I didn’t mind. It was lunchtime, but I wanted to treat it like the morning and trick myself into being more productive.

After I got some tea, I grabbed my notebook from the room and poured myself a cup of Cheerios. I got cozy at the kitchen table, preferring to face the smell of fresh paint over the frankly creepy carpet walls. I’m a writer, and I came to the city to get work done. When I was in my early twenties, I moved to the country believing it would inspire me. Hasn’t everyone heard those stories of writers who fell in love with the countryside? Well, that shit doesn’t apply to me apparently. It’s quiet in the country. It’s too quiet in the country. The only upside was living in my grandma’s old farmhouse. Let’s just say my grandma wasn’t very fond of my parents, so it got passed to me. Having a free house means I can’t complain about driving thirty minutes to get anywhere.

The city sounds and fresh environment made me extra productive, and I got a few hours of work done. Jackson’s flat felt cozy to me, like I had been there before. To my surprise, I was excited when I heard his keys screeching in the lock at 4:45. He smiled at me as he swung a few bags of groceries up onto the counter.

“I know this is kind of out of our relationship bounds, but I figured you had a rough night so…” A few ingredients stuck out of the bag: chicken, parsley, and some sort of sauce. “I wanted to make you dinner.”

“Oh!” The chair scraped against the floor as I stood up and pulled my wedged shorts over my butt. “Oh my god, that’s so sweet of you. Can I help?”

“Sure! How about we both clean up some and then cook together? Like a date?”

His forwardness shocked me, but I wasn’t complaining. It was as if he was working on the clock.

“Sure. A date.” I smiled. “I’ll dress up and everything.”

“Perfect! I think I’ll hop in the shower. Meet back here in thirty minutes?”

“Yeah. Hey, speaking of the shower…I’m not sure if you noticed, but there are some holes in the wall.”

Jackson turned from the counter and leaned against it a little awkwardly.

“Oh, I’ll get those looked at. I’ve had some weird tenants so it must be damage from one of them.”

“Yeah, I can imagine you get some crazies.” I laughed slightly, and a little too loudly. “Thank you so much.”

“Of course! Hey, your phone is broken, right? I saw it when I was taking you back last night.”

“Yeah,” I pulled it out of my pocket and set it on the table, “It’s kind of nice for focus reasons, but I should really find a place for it. Do you have a suggestion?”

“I’ll just take it in for you. There’s a place right by my work.”

“Sure!” I slid it to him and he tucked it into his back pocket. “Is there a way I can pay you back? For this and everything else I mean.”

He paused for a moment then grinned. “I’m sure we’ll think of a way.”

I almost expected him to wink, but he turned around to empty the groceries into the fridge. As he turned, his eyes traveled up and down my body, lingering on my lounging shorts a little too long. I felt heat rising to my cheeks.

“I’m- I’m going to change. See you soon?”

He smiled. “See you soon.”

The cramped, Jackson-less room hardly compared to the kitchen, but I still couldn’t keep the smile from my face. I pulled my duffel out from under the bed and shuffled through it, searching for just the right outfit. There wasn’t much in there for a date, but I packed expecting to spend most of my time holed up writing. I had brought one red dress, intended for the bar. Slipping it over my head, I leaned down to look for shoes to pair with it. We weren’t going outside, but I didn’t think Jackson would mind. They might be the only thing I keep on tonight.

One heel had fallen out of the duffel bag, and I had to stretch myself partially under the bed to reach it. As I did, my head brushed against something sticking out of the mattress, something soft and thin. With a grunt, I rolled onto my back and pulled it out.

In my hands was a note, and to my surprise, my name was written on the front. If Jackson had left it for me, it was a weird spot to put it. I got to my feet and sat on the edge of the bed. The note was folded, uneven, and seemingly rushed. I unfolded it carefully. For a moment, I could barely comprehend what I saw on the paper. Before even reading the words my head and heart were pounding. It was my own handwriting, albeit sloppy and in all caps. It read:

“IT KEEPS STARTING OVER. I CAN’T EXPLAIN IT, BUT YOU HAVE TO ESCAPE.” And at the bottom in scrawling letters: “HE’LL RESET YOU.”

I didn’t have time to react. There was a shuffling at the door, and I jumped slightly. Everything around me suddenly felt dark, like a spotlight was shining on me. Someone was watching me, and I could feel it. I stood up and padded to the door, trying not to make a sound. The peephole had no cover, and I peered through. With a gasp, I fell backward. Was that an eye? Jackson’s eye? After a few moments, there was a knock on the door.

“Hey! I just wanted to check up on you. Could you maybe open the door?”

I scrambled to the bed and shoved the note back in its place.

“I’m sorry. I’m still getting ready…”

It was quiet for a moment, and then his voice came back, low and monotone.

“Open the door.” I blessed myself for having the good sense to lock it. The handle turned slowly at first, and then it started to rattle. “Open the door!”

“Leave me alone!” I screamed at him through the barrier and then pulled my bag out from beneath the bed. I didn’t have a phone or any sense of direction, but if I could just get outside I knew I’d be safe. It was around dinner time, and there should be plenty of people in the street. Jackson was banging on the door, yelling something incoherent. I only caught a few words in my panic. Mine. Obey. My right. I dashed for the window and pulled up the blinds, only to find the pane locked down. My chest heaved as I stepped back, a whimper escaping me. I was barred in. What looked like security from the outside was now my cage.

I was trapped in a room with carpet walls. There was nothing to peel away, nothing I could break, no way out except through the door. Through Jackson. And, of course, there was nothing I could weaponize in the room. I couldn’t believe things could change so quickly. A few moments ago I wanted to sleep with him. The banging had stopped, and suddenly my breathing felt like the loudest thing in the world. The only other sound was Jackson’s footsteps down the hall. I was sure he owned a spare key. I didn’t know what “reset” even meant, but it wasn’t something I wanted to find out.

The key screeched in the lock the same way it did with the front door. I held up my fists, ready to put up the fight of my life, and watched as it swung open. His grin unnerved me the most. The blue hoodie no longer felt safe. He held a wide stance, with the key in one hand and a baseball bat that ironically sported my favorite team’s logo in the other. The last thing I remembered was his words, drawn out and infused with anger and something else…excitement?

“Looks like it’s time for a reset.”

  
...



At first, all I felt was the gravel shifting beneath my cheek. Everything felt dry. My mouth was like cotton. I lifted my head, tugging my hair from beneath my arms in the process. Under my limp hand lay something cool and sticky.  I turned it over and lifted my face to see an empty Tequila bottle. My focus shifted to a figure approaching down the alleyway. Lines wobbled across my vision on a horizontal path and the figure wobbled with them.  He became distinct bit by bit: a baseball hat tucked into a blue hoodie, my favorite shade of blue and my favorite team’s logo stitched on the front. A bandage on his cheek. Black boots. A warm voice.

“Woah there!”

...

I don't remember all of the cycles. So many of them blend together now. But I do remember this one. I remember the victory I felt once my memories started returning, the victory of that bandage on his cheek. I had done something. I had scratched through his skin the way I couldn't break through those damned carpet walls. Without even realizing it, I had grown stronger. It would be a long time before I would finally escape, with my daughter Molly at my side. I'm teaching her to be a fighter though.
