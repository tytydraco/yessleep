They told me the pay was good, but they didn’t tell me the customers wouldn’t have faces.

I wish that was a punchline. I wish I was laughing. I’m typing this on my thirty-minute break in the employee “canteen,” which is a generous name for a windowless room that smells like mop water and microwaved fish. My hands are still thawing out. I’ll probably delete this later and pretend I imagined it. Or I won’t, because I need someone—anyone—to tell me this isn’t normal.

The flyer was duct-taped to a leaning phone pole, the kind with rust creeping up from the staples of a thousand lost-cat posters. HIRING NOW. NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. START TONIGHT. It had a phone number and the logo of a store I’d never heard of: GOLIATH MARKET. The name felt like a dare. I called because my rent is a calendar with torn-off days and a landlord who texts “friendly reminder” with nine exclamation points.

A woman answered on the second ring, voice flat enough to iron with.

“Name,” she said.

I told her.

“Report to 1400 Benton at nineteen hundred. Dress warm. Seafood detail. Bring steel toes if you own them.”

I asked if there was an interview.

“This is your interview,” she said, and hung up.

If you try to Google 1400 Benton, the map spins, thinks, and dumps you on a blank stretch of service road like it got bored. You have to trust the turnoff that looks like a drainage easement, then the unmarked lane that dips under a powerline field, then the squat barrier with the lifted arm. No signage. No security guard. Just a three-foot-tall LED display counting numbers that flickered as I drove past: 12,402… 12,403… I thought it was a glitch until I parked and looked up.

Goliath Market isn’t a store. It’s a country. It’s a roofline that curves with the horizon. The lot is a concrete prairie. The entrance is a pair of doors the size of semi trailers with a heat curtain blasting out like a dragon’s sigh. There’s no billboard, no “Welcome Shoppers!” banner, just a tiny, tasteful plaque set in the brick: GOLIATH. I could have walked under that sign ten times and still not noticed it if the wind hadn’t stopped exactly there, like the word itself held the air in place.

Inside, the sound swallowed me. Not noise—sound. A pressure. Imagine standing on the floor of an airplane hangar while someone whispers at the exact frequency of your skull. A man in a navy jacket that said LOGISTICS on the back handed me a high-vis vest and a parka big enough to camp in.

“You’re Landen,” he said, not asking.

“Yeah,” I said. “Do I need to… sign something?”

“You already did.”

I looked down at my empty hands.

He pointed over my shoulder. A laminated badge was clipped to my vest, my name in block letters, and beneath it a title: SEAFOOD DETAIL. I had not put that badge on. The plastic felt warm against my chest, as if it had just been pressed there by a palm.

“Follow the spine to aqua,” he said. “Pallet drops every six minutes. Stock both sides. Keep moving.”

He shoved a handheld scanner into my palm and turned away. I didn’t even get to say my line about being grateful for the opportunity.

The “spine” is a hallway as wide as a four-lane road that runs the exact center of the building. The shelves that branch off it are not shelves. They’re walls. Ten feet tall, thick enough to walk behind. The sign above the first aisle said “Fresh Produce,” but it was a lie. There is no “front” of anything here. The real store is behind the shelves, in the tunnels where the pallets appear and the workers move like bloodstream cells. Customers float on the other side, pushing carts in serene loops, and the two worlds touch only at the vents where product flows through.

You know how in normal stores there’s a “back room”? Goliath’s back room is the store.

The air got colder with every step. Not the metallic breath of a grocery freezer. A cold that felt stacked, like layers of night laid over each other and nailed down. I passed aisles for “Canned Staples,” “Bulk Paper,” “Infant Essentials,” each with a color code—red, white, yellow—until the signs turned a deep Atlantic blue. The tile underfoot wasn’t tile anymore; it was ribbed metal that sang under my boots. The wall sweated frost.

SEAFOOD, said the placard. “Aqua,” said the strip of tape at my feet. A narrow lane opened between two rear walls of shelving. Two pallets sat in the lane, shrink-wrapped towers labeled with SKUs that made no sense: 77-ICELUNG, 12-CRUST-PEEL-LIVE/LIVE. The scanner in my hand chirped, bright and eager. “Welcome, Landen!” it flashed, then immediately showed a task: 77-ICELUNG → CASE 14A-FWD, 14A-AFT. 6 MIN.

I slit the plastic with a box cutter, and fog poured out like breath. Fish—silver bodies minimal as cutlery—nested in trays, eyes filmed over. When I touched the first tray, all the fish convulsed once, in perfect unison, a muscle small as a whisper running through them.

The voice came from behind me.

“Put your hood up.”

I turned. A woman stood half in shadow, the aqua light turning her hair gunmetal. She wore the same high-vis vest and parka, her hood furred, her face red with cold. Her eyes were red in the corners, too—blood vessels spidered from iris to white like fragile cracks in porcelain. She might have been my age. She might have been forty. Here, everyone was a chapped mouth and a shadow.

“Put your hood up,” she repeated. “Trust me.”

“I’m fine,” I said, because the cold bit my ears the way fresh truth bites, and it felt better to be bitten than not. “Is there—do I—”

“You stock,” she said. “Both sides, two lanes at a time. Stay in your lanes. Do not step into a lane that isn’t yours unless a lead tells you to. If someone speaks to you, keep your head down. If you can’t keep your head down, keep your hood up. If you can’t keep your hood up—” She trailed off. “Just keep your hood up.”

“Are you my lead?” I asked.

She shook her head. “You’re new. You’ll see your lead when they need you to see them.”

“Okay,” I said. “Thanks.”

She looked like she wanted to say more. She pressed her lips together until the color drained from them. Then someone whistled from deeper in the maze behind the shelves—just one note, long and flat—and she flinched like the note tugged a string that ran through her.

“Welcome to Goliath,” she said, and left.

The scanner chirped again. I started working.

It’s simple: slice, lift, slide, scan, repeat. The trick at Goliath is not the lifting. It’s the way the world edits while you’re not looking. One moment, the pallet is a column of shrink-wrapped cases; the next, it’s the idea of a column, soft at the edges. I stocked an entire rack on the front side—hands numb, nose itching, hood up—and when I stepped back behind the shelf to grab the next tray, I was not where I had been.

You think you won’t get lost in a straight line until a straight line moves while you blink.

“Keep moving,” someone said behind me. I didn’t turn my head. I kept moving.

Customers drifted on the other side of the case, shapes blurred by fogged glass. I told myself they were normal. They had to be normal. I watched a man—broad shoulders, beanie, work boots—pause and gesture at the product label. He leaned closer to the glass, breath fanning across it, and his breath left no mark. He had no breath. He had no face.

I’m not being poetic. Where his face should have been was smooth skin, pale, like the inside of a wrist. No eyes. No mouth. No nose. Just skin stretched over a skull that must have had holes under it once. He tilted that smoothness toward me anyway, as if he could see me through the glass. As if he had never needed eyes to do it.

“Do you have snow crab?” he asked. The voice wasn’t loud. I didn’t hear it with my ears. I felt it, like you feel bass through your sternum. The sound vibrated in my teeth, and my teeth hurt.

I pointed to the wrong case. I don’t know why I lied. He pushed his cart onward, the wheels squeaking, the squeak a normal sound that made the rest of it worse.

They came like that all night. A woman in yoga pants, a boy in a baseball jersey, an old man with a cane. Ordinary clothes, ordinary movements. Smooth skin where their faces should be. “Is the salmon farmed?” one asked. “Where are the paper towels?” asked another, standing in seafood for reasons I cannot explain. “Do you carry birthday candles, the kind with the glitter?” asked a third. None of them looked concerned about the lack of face. None touched their heads or asked for help. The ones that laughed did it without opening anything at all.

Someone sneezed. The sound startled me so hard I dropped a tray. I looked up, expecting to see spray on glass. There was nothing. The sneeze had all the trappings of a sneeze with none of the mechanics. A cart rolled through the wet patch that still appeared on the floor anyway, near the wheel, the way water sometimes finds you even when you’re under an awning.

I told myself I was hallucinating. I told myself the cold was making me stupid. I told myself anything that was kinder than the thing itself.

When the first pallet emptied, the scanner beeped: GOOD JOB! I wanted to throw it into the ice. I tore down the plastic on the second pallet. The labels here were worse. CRUST-PEEL-LIVE/LIVE meant more than I wanted it to mean. The top tray writhed like a pillowcase full of breath. A lobster’s claw banged against the plastic, and another claw—no bigger than the first, but shaped wrong, as if someone had traced the idea of a claw with their left hand—banged back.

A whistle sounded. Not a human whistle. An alarm. The scanner flashed: DROP INBOUND – 90 SECONDS. I stepped into the lane to make room—and that was when I saw the middle spine open like a maintenance artery. A forklift slid into view, silent, its tires whispering over steel. No driver. The pallet it carried was shrink-wrapped with milky plastic that bulged in soft mounds, like rising bread. A line of condensation trailed behind it.

The forklift halted dead center. The pallet breathed once—a sigh that condensed in the frozen air—and then the plastic split down the middle with a noise like someone peeling skin from a lip. The shrink-wrap fell away in flakes.

Inside were not cases. Inside were jars. Jars the size of coffee cans, filled with clear syrup. Things floated inside, hair-light. Each jar had a label, and the scanner flashed them in the corner of my left eye as if the words were printing themselves on my retina. INFANT NAILS, BROWN. INFANT HAIR, DARK. DECIDUOUS TEETH, MIXED. The scanner chimed with happy suggestion: GREAT FOR SEASONAL DISPLAYS!

I took a step backward. My heel hit something soft. The soft thing groaned.

I spun. A man I hadn’t noticed lay on the metal grating in my lane, curled on his side in a high-vis vest like mine. His hood was down. His hair was clumped with frost. His face was—

His face was fine. He had a face. He had a mouth that moved, opening and closing like a fish rescued and laid on ice. No sound came out. His eyes flicked past me to the forklift, then jerked back to mine, and he shook his head minutely. His hands came up, palms out. Please. Please.

“Hey,” I whispered. “Are you okay? Do you need—”

“Keep moving,” said the voice behind me, and I knew without turning that if I looked I would see another worker, hood up, eyes red at the corners. “Do not step into a lane that isn’t yours.”

“He’s in my lane,” I said.

She said nothing. The forklift slid away on its whisper tires, the pallet of jars breathing soft as it went.

I crouched to help the man up, and he grabbed my wrist. His grip was startlingly strong. He shook his head again, harder this time, and then he released me and rolled, inch by inch, under the shelf. His parka scraped the grate. A single long hair snagged on the edge and snapped, hanging like a question mark. He disappeared into a space that did not look big enough to hold him. The shelf did not move. There was no gap. He was just gone.

“Keep moving,” the voice repeated, closer now, and this time I stood and kept moving because I did not trust my body to do otherwise.

I stocked from behind while customers shopped from the front. The scanner chirped and chirped. My fingers lost color, then sensation. I remember thinking, suddenly and stupidly, about the health video they made us watch at my last job about cold stress. Shivering is good, the video said. Shivering means your body is still trying. When you stop shivering, that’s when you need to worry. I realized I wasn’t shivering anymore. I realized my jaw felt heavy in its socket, as if someone was pressing a thumb under my chin to close my mouth.

At some point a lead must have passed down the lane, because a new strip of tape appeared at my feet: LANE 14B CLOSED. I didn’t see anyone place it. It was just there, crooked, a bubble trapped under the plastic. I stepped over it without thinking, and my breath hitched in my throat in a way that had nothing to do with cold.

“Keep moving,” said the air itself, and now it sounded like the store, the whisper frequency of the roof.

I don’t know how long I worked like that. There are no clocks in Goliath. There are no windows, no sun shadows, no stray drafts that say where a door might be. Only the spine and the lanes and the walls of shelves that make the world into a grid.

The second time someone said my name, it was a customer.

“How’s your mother, Landen?” The voice arrived like a brush of velvet across the inside of my ear.

I froze. The tray of salmon belly slid from my hands and hit the grate with a sound like a knife stepping down a staircase. I stared through the fogged glass. The shape beyond was average in every way: height, weight, the way it leaned on the cart bar with a slouch of a patient, bored person. Smooth skin where the face should have been. The smoothness tilted, attentive.

“I didn’t tell you my name,” I said. My breath came out in a cloud on my side of the glass. On his side, nothing.

“You told us when you came in,” the voice said, mild and amused. “You said it to the counter. You said it to the gate. You said it to your badge.” A soft tap came from the other side of the glass, like a finger testing a mirror. “You’re saying it now.”

I took a step backwards, then another, until the cold of the metal case pressed against my back. My hood fur rasped against the plexi edge. I wanted to call for the woman from before, the one with the red eyes. I wanted to call anyone. My mouth made shapes, and fog billowed, and no sound came out.

The customer’s smoothness inclined slightly to the left, like a head cocked. “Your mother’s favorite candle is vanilla,” the voice told me, musing. “Your favorite aisle is the one with the bulk bags of rice because you like the way they shift when you lean against them. Your favorite door is the one that opens.” The smoothness didn’t have a mouth, but somehow I felt the curl of a smile in my ear. “You won’t like the doors here.”

“Excuse me,” someone said—an actual voice, cut free in the cold—and I flinched so hard I almost fell. A guy in a navy LOGISTICS jacket appeared at my elbow, his clipboard hugged to his chest like a shield. He didn’t look at me. He looked at the customer. Or rather, he looked at the customer’s cart. He gently rotated the cart by the handle, directing it down the aisle, away from me.

“This lane’s closed to guests,” he said cheerfully. His breath smoked in the air like a human’s. “Let’s get you back to center, friend.”

The cart rolled away, cooperative. The shape behind the cart didn’t look back. It didn’t have anything to look back with.

The logistics guy stood beside me for a moment after the cart turned the corner. He didn’t face me; he studied a sheet of paper covered in numbers, or pretended to, because the paper was blank. His eyelashes were rimed with frost.

“You’re doing good,” he said conversationally. “Hood up, head down.”

“What are they?” I whispered. My voice cracked in the middle like ice.

He pretended not to hear. “When your scanner says break, take it. If you don’t want to be… popular, use the tunnel with the yellow grating and don’t make eye contact.”

“With who?”

“Exactly,” he said, and walked away.

The scanner beeped. BREAK – 00:30:00. I didn’t know where the break room was. My feet did. I don’t have another explanation. My feet turned down a lane I hadn’t stocked, crossed the spine, cut through “Seasonal,” which was all beige and gray in cardboard boxes labeled with months that didn’t exist—OCTEMBERB, NOVEMBEREST—and slid through a tunnel with yellow grating into a hall where the sound softened enough that human voices could float on top of it like leaves on floodwater.

The canteen had twelve identical round tables. Each chair was bolted to the floor, little silver round scars at the feet. A vending machine hummed in the corner with the persistence of a gnat. The offerings were industrial: soups with nouns only (CHOWDER, STEW), candy bars whose wrappers said things like PROTEIN and ENERGY in fonts that look like slogans. A bulletin board held notices with a corporate cheeriness that made my stomach drop: YOU ARE THE ENGINE! TEAMWORK IS THE FUEL! A second board held laminated photos of employees in their gear, faces blurred—not censored, not pixelated, just… soft. If you’ve ever taken a photo and the autofocus locked on the wrong thing, you know the look. Nothing in the canteen was in focus.

The woman from before sat alone at a table, stirring a foam cup of something like soup. Her hood was down. Her hair was slicked by melted frost. Up close, her lips were chapped to the point of bleeding in fine lines. She didn’t look up when I sat.

“Thank you,” I said. It sounded small in here, smaller than the whisper-store, smaller than the stretch of the roof.

“You kept your hood up,” she said. It was not praise so much as diagnosis.

“What does that do? The hood?”

“Sometimes they forget you have a face if you make it hard to see.”

“They don’t forget anything.”

“Not the customers,” she said, and finally she looked up. Her eyes were the only warm thing about her. They were brown—ordinary, real brown, flecked with gold that caught the overhead light. They made her face look… like a face. “The people you don’t make eye contact with.”

I waited. She went back to stirring.

“I saw a pallet,” I said to fill the silence. “Jars. Teeth. Hair. Infant… nails. Do we stock that? What section is that even for?”

“Seasonal,” she said. “Endcaps, but not the ones the guests see.”

“You mean the back endcaps? Who buys it?”

She gave a small, brittle smile that cracked one of the lines on her lip. “You’ll learn we don’t ask that.”

“What’s your name?” I asked.

Her hand paused on the cup. She stared at the steam, as if she could read in it whether that was a safe question.

“You don’t have to—”

“Dara,” she said, and then looked almost startled, as if someone had spoken through her. “It’s Dara.”

“I’m—”

“I know.” She tapped my badge with a finger. The plastic thudded, dull, like a heartbeat under a pillow. “Don’t say it. Not in here.”

“Why not?”

She gestured toward the vending machine with her chin. On the glass, where the light hit the reflection just right, there were handprints. Not on the surface. Inside the glass. As if something had pressed against it from the racks where the candy should be and then remembered it was candy and turned back into candy. I didn’t realize I was holding my breath until my ribs hurt.

“Don’t say it,” she repeated quietly. “Names are how they hold you steady.”

“Who is they?”

The room’s fluorescent bulbs hummed in chorus like a nest of wasps. Dara’s eyes tracked something behind me. I fought the urge to turn. Cold skated up the back of my neck as if from a door that had opened without air.

“Look at your soup,” she said. “If you didn’t bring soup, look at your hands. If you don’t want to look at your hands, look at me. But do not look behind you.”

“What’s behind me?”

She smiled without meaning it. “You don’t want to be popular.”

“I’ve been popular exactly never,” I said. It came out too loud.

The humming faltered, just for a beat. In that beat, something like breath touched the hairs at the nape of my neck and counted them. I looked at Dara. She looked at me, and because she looked at me, I didn’t turn.

The breath withdrew, bored. The humming resumed at a hair higher pitch, almost celebratory.

“You’ll learn the rules,” Dara said. “Hood up in aqua. Keep your head down in the spine. No eye contact when the floor grates are yellow—only yellow, not red—and if the pallets breathe twice, call logistics and pretend you don’t notice when the call doesn’t go through.”

“What happens if—”

“Break’s over in six,” she said. “You should eat.”

My hands shook a little as I peeled foil off a cup of CHOWDER. It tasted like salt and wet cardboard. It tasted like something that used to be food.

“How long have you worked here?” I asked.

Dara considered. “You stop counting,” she said at last. “They don’t like anniversaries.”

“They who—”

“Don’t.” She didn’t say it like a scold. She said it like you tell someone not to touch a fence because you can hear the electricity in it.

I watched her mouth the word in my head until its edges rounded. Don’t. Don’t. The cup warmed my palms. I think I would have dozed sitting there if the cold hadn’t sharpened my focus whenever it started to soften. I think that might be the point of the cold.

The scanner on my hip beeped. Dara’s beeped half a second later. BREAK – 00:00:30. Then BREAK – 00:00:05. Then it flashed a smiling face that was only lines on a screen but still managed to make my stomach muscle clench. BACK TO IT, CHAMP!

We rose together. Dara pulled her hood up until it shadowed her brow. I did the same. We passed the bulletin board. I pretended not to see that the photo in the center—the one with the employee of the month plaque screwed under it—had my orange vest in it. Not mine. A vest like mine. A person wearing a vest like mine, whose face wasn’t blurred so much as erased in a different way, the surface pulled smooth like a bedsheet over a ghost. The plaque said CONGRATULATIONS, LAND— The last letters were smeared by a drip of something that dried like sugar.

“Dara,” I said, as we reached the yellow grating. “Earlier you said if you can’t keep your hood up…” I waited.

She tied her drawstrings tighter. The ends slapped her chest like church bells.

“If you can’t keep your hood up,” she said, “keep your mouth closed.”

“That’s it?”

“That’s what you can control.” She stepped into the tunnel. The light changed. The cold came back like a hand over my mouth.

Back in aqua, a new pallet waited. The shrink-wrap had fogged from the inside. The label said 12-CRUST-PEEL-LIVE/LIVE again, but a black marker had drawn a line through the second LIVE and written something I couldn’t read, the letters overlapping like handwriting from two people on the same phone line.

I slit the plastic. The scanner chirped.

“Welcome back, Landen,” it flashed. “We missed you.”

I stacked. The customers flowed. They talked to me without mouths. I kept my head down. I kept my hood up.

When it happened, it happened quietly. No music sting. No jump-scare.

I leaned to press a tray into the front case. My breath hit the glass and smeared. My glove slipped against the fog. I swore, the word small and private under the noise. I looked down at my own reflection in the plexi to wipe where I’d smudged.

For a second I didn’t recognize the person looking back. Because there weren’t features to recognize.

It wasn’t total. Not gone. Not blank. Just… softer. My mouth had edges like a watercolor mouth, the line of the top lip blurred into the skin above, the philtrum a memory. My nose looked… correct if you didn’t look directly at it. When I tried to focus, the bridge fuzzed like heat shimmer over a road. My eyes were still there. My eyes were still mine. But when I blinked, the lids took a fraction longer than eyelids take to open, like they were lifting against syrup instead of air.

I jerked back, hard enough that the tray I was holding slipped and cracked against the grate. Fish slid like coins scattering. My hood brushed the edge of the case and popped off my head. Cold grabbed my ears with two delighted hands.

Across the glass, a customer turned its smoothness toward me with the eager attention of someone who hears their name in a crowd.

I grabbed my hood, my fingers clumsy. The fabric caught on my badge. The plastic pulled tight against my chest. I heard the tiny crack before I felt it. The clip snapped. The badge fell. It skittered across the grate and slid under the case, into the front world, the world of carts and smooth faces.

The customer reached down. Its hand—gloved in a knit glove with a snowflake pattern—picked up my badge and held it up to its blankness as if inspecting it.

“Landen,” the voice said warmly, right against my eardrum. “We’ve been trying to remember you.”

I lifted my eyes just enough to see over the edge of my hood. Dara stood at the end of the lane. She was looking right at me even though she shouldn’t have been. Her hand was up, small and hard as a stop sign. Don’t.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. The badge dangled from the knit glove like a baited lure. The scanner on my hip beamed a little chime—TASK COMPLETE!—because the fish on the floor counted as stocked so long as they were technically on the correct side.

“Welcome to the team,” the customer said lovingly, and I felt the words inside my mouth like fingers checking my teeth.

I closed my mouth. I pulled my hood up. I looked at my hands.

My break is over. I have to go back out. If you don’t hear from me by morning, don’t come looking. If you see a store this big hiring, don’t apply. And if you already did—

Keep your hood up. Keep your head down.

And whatever you do, don’t let them read your name out loud.
