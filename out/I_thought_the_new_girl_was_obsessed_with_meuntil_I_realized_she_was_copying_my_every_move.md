It all started innocently enough. Ava transferred to our school about two months ago, right in the middle of the semester. She was quiet, kept to herself, and didn’t really stand out—until she did. I don’t know why, but it felt like Ava started paying more attention to me than anyone else. At first, I brushed it off as nothing. I mean, I was a pretty average student, not the kind of person that attracted attention. But then little things started happening.

I noticed she had the same backpack as me. Not a big deal, right? Plenty of people shop at the same stores. But then, in chemistry class, she got the same binder and pens—*exactly* the same. It was weird, but not alarming. I mean, maybe she liked my style?

A week later, she joined the same clubs I was in. First, the art history club. That was weird because she didn't strike me as the artsy type. Then the creative writing club. I thought it was strange she kept signing up for the same things as me, but I told myself it was just a coincidence.

But then things got… creepier. I started noticing her clothes. She wore outfits *exactly* like mine. On the same days. If I wore my old band tee and ripped jeans, she’d be in a nearly identical outfit the next day. At first, it was small things—same hoodie, same sneakers. But then it became eerily specific. The same necklace I’d gotten from a local shop, the same hairpins I’d been wearing for weeks. It was like she was studying me, mirroring every single thing I did.

I told my best friend Claire about it, but she just laughed and said I should be flattered. “She’s probably just inspired by you,” Claire had said, but deep down, I knew something was off. This wasn’t inspiration. This was something else.

Then the real nightmare started.

It began with Instagram. Ava followed me, which seemed normal enough. But then she started posting pictures—*my* pictures. The same poses, the same angles, the same places. I’d post a photo from the park, and the next day, she’d post one in the exact same spot, wearing clothes that looked almost identical to mine. At first, I thought she was just copying my aesthetic, but then I noticed the captions. They were always eerily similar to mine. Sometimes, she’d only change a single word, but it was enough to feel like a twisted version of what I’d originally posted.

I confronted her at school one day, trying to sound casual, even though I was freaking out inside. “Hey, Ava, it’s kinda weird how we keep wearing the same things and posting similar pics, huh?”

She just smiled, but it wasn’t a friendly smile. It was the kind of smile that makes your skin crawl. “I guess we have the same taste,” she said, her voice flat. But there was something behind her eyes—something dark, something… unsettling.

Things escalated quickly after that.

A few days later, I woke up in the middle of the night to a notification on my phone. It was from Ava, but she hadn’t messaged me. She’d *tagged* me in a photo. My heart dropped into my stomach. It was a picture of *me*, sleeping in my bed, *that very night*. The blankets were exactly how I had them wrapped around me, the glow from my lamp casting the same shadow on the wall. My first thought was that someone was playing a sick joke, but then I saw the caption.

“I think I’m finally ready to *be* you.”

I jumped out of bed, heart pounding, and checked every lock in the house. How had she gotten this picture? How was she in my room without me knowing? I wanted to scream, but I was too terrified. My phone buzzed again. Another tag. This time, it was a video. My breath caught in my throat as I watched.

In the video, the camera was facing my bedroom door. It was *opening*. Slowly. The door creaked, and then I saw a figure enter—*Ava*. She was wearing the same hoodie I had on. She stood at the foot of my bed, just staring at me, watching me sleep.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I ran to my parents’ room, shaking and crying, but when I tried to explain what had happened, they didn’t believe me. They thought I was having a nightmare. The video was gone when I tried to show them.

The next day at school, Ava didn’t even look at me. But I knew what I’d seen. And I knew it wasn’t over.

I started sleeping with my door locked, but it didn’t make me feel any safer. Because if Ava could get into my room without me noticing, what else could she do?
