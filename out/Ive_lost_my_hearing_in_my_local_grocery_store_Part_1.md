Silence is beautiful, but it can’t be found anywhere in nature and certainly not in the modern world anymore. Walking through the forest the sounds of birds chirping are heard and with every step the leaves make their presence known by their crunch. Sometimes synthetic noises seep in past the barricade of leaves and trees; Planes heard overhead, car alarms heard from one side of the forest, and on the other a train rumbles and horns loudly so far away. Sounds inhabit our ears and never are we found listening to nothing; despite this, there is a primordial urge to seek silence, yet the world we live in is filtered with nothing but noise. Seek true silence and you’ll never find it; you must let the silence find you, like it found me. 

I hate the silence; I hate it because it’s never really silent. I always hear some sort of ringing noise. Who knew growing up on a farm while using heavy machinery without proper ear protection would lead to permanent hearing damage and lead to lifelong torment of ringing in my ears? My father didn’t, and I was too young to say anything. I’ve been to multiple doctors where they all told me it was called tinnitus and that there is no cure or treatment for it. They’ve recommended that I listen to white noise when I try to fall asleep, so I’m not distracted by the loud ringing that creeps in when my apartment is quiet. I’ve tried it, but I find the noise more distracting than the actual ringing I hear. Despite hearing the ringing for the majority of my life, I still find it taxing to deal with. The only peace I hear is when it rains. The rhythmic tapping of rain droplets falling on my window or the low growl of thunder in the distance has brought longstanding comfort to my need for sleep.

All this being said, I don’t want to risk myself finding a silent patch, so I’m always listening to something, whether it be a podcast or music or some random video that’s in my queue. If you’re curious about what I listen to, don’t be, because I listen to anything and everything under the sun. There used to be a time when I was defined by a single genre of music, but after milking that genre to oblivion and back, I’ve branched out and found some other genres have intrigued me and others that I can tolerate. I’ve become numb to music; I know a lot of people listen to music in hopes to connect with the lyrics or the instruments and use it for self-gratification, but I just use it to fill the surrounding silence. Same idea for podcasts too, I bounce around from genre to genre looking for something that piques my interest when music gets too stale for me. True Crime and History are my two favorite genres, but often the same topics of conversation are covered; for example, I could recite the history of the Zodiac Killer from memory.

As for my job, I update records and enter information into a computerized system that does who knows what with it. I work from my apartment and in case you were curious, that’s how I’m able to constantly listen to my distractions. I wouldn’t say my job is hard, because I have to constantly type and look at information and transcribe it correctly into the places where it needs to be transcribed; I would call it more tedious than anything. I like it because I can turn my brain off, type what I need to, and listen to what I want to.

I went to the nearby grocery store to do my normal grocery haul, and as I made my way through the parking lot, I made sure to by lock my car. I reached down to swap my keys for my earbuds, but I felt nothing. By this point, I was nearly at the entrance of the store, so I decided to venture inside without my headphones, assuring myself that the ambient noises of the life would shield me from my own ears.

I walked in, grabbed my basket, and proceeded in, where I heard the noises of crying children in the background, scuttling carts, and whatever pop music was playing at a low volume. I didn’t have to grab much because it was my midweek shopping expedition: Some fruit and veggies, bread, milk, and packaged meats. Quickly I made my way through the store, weaving in and out of the way of oncoming cart traffic, trying to make my shopping experience as seamless as possible without the need to stop and wade behind people. I grabbed everything I needed to other than the pasta sauce, where I overheard an argument over which brand of bread a couple should buy, an intercom announcement calling for the produce section to answer a call, and the constant hum of the AC above my head.

Normally each aisle is filled with people standing shoulder to shoulder waiting their turn in line to grab whatever knickknack they needed off the shelf, but to my surprise there was no one but myself in that aisle. It was empty.

I took this as a sign of good luck and strode toward the pasta sauce. At the top of the aisle stood a near empty shelf of pasta sauce, I stood on the balls of my feet to see if there were any more pasta sauce and to my luck, there was one more, but it was almost out of my reach. I strained my arm, but I couldn’t grab it, I must’ve been so focused on the sauce that I didn’t notice that the ever-buzzing AC became timid. I decided that I was going to jump for it, I looked around and didn’t see anyone in case this ended poorly, I took a deep breath and jumped. As quickly as I grabbed the sauce, it came loose plummeting toward the ground, and soon the ground met the glass bottle and died a silent death.

There was no impact, no shatter, and weirdly no noise.

I stood in awe and confusion of the silent shatter on the ground that lay in front of me.

“Did that jus-” I tried to say, choking on my own words. I didn’t hear myself. I cleared my throat,

“Am I deaf?” once again, nothing.

No longer were there the sounds of wheels turning, children laughing and crying, or any indistinct chatter coming from aisles to my left or right. I finally noticed after seconds of contemplating the functionality of my ears, the flood of silence washed over my ears in an instant, I looked around to try and find something that could possibly make a noise. I grabbed a glass sauce jar and tried to grate it over the metal shelf, expecting a sound to be made, but nothing. I shuffled backwards int the shelf behind me, small bags of rice fell on the ground and their impact fell silent.

I nearly forgot about the broken jar on the floor, a wave of blood shot to my face, filling my face red with embarrassment as this would look weird to an outside observer, but I scanned around me and didn’t see anyone. I knew I needed to tell someone about my mess, so I placed my basket down in hopes of alerting some employees about my accident.

As I walked past the aisles filled with sauces and other jarred goods, I neared the end of the aisle, but I must’ve gotten turned around. What I expected to be an open space filled with meat products was filled with what appeared to be a turn with a wall assorted with the same items I just passed, so I decided to turn around toward the front of the store. Once again, I expected a small section filled with gift cards and candy, but a similar turn and wall met my eyesight. I knew that this couldn’t be right, as I just made my way through this aisle to come here.  My stride turned to timid steps as I made my way to the turn.

Slowly I rounded the corner, and I couldn’t believe my eyes: The same aisle I came from, with the same broken red mess of glass.

I turned back to the original aisle and there it sat; I looked forward and there the same one was. My head whipped back and forth, as I was trying to wrap my head around whatever space time rift made itself known to me. I took a deep breath and approached the new aisle with small and silent steps. As I neared the other broken sauce jar, I couldn’t believe that this was the same as the one that I broke. I ran to check around the corner and the original sauce jar lay there, in a pile of its own essence.

I fell to my knees in a silent yet painful embrace, a defeated shell of a man who thought he had the world figured out.

There was no rational explanation that I could come up with to explain this phenomenon. Maybe a YouTube prankster kid replicated my sauce incident, but that wouldn’t explain the noiselessness. Maybe I was asleep, and I know how cliché this sounds, but I pinched myself to see if I’d wake, and sure enough, I was awake on the floor of my local supermarket.

I heard a sound, like someone clicking their tongue on the roof of their mouth, mixed with the metallic scraping of a worn-out blender. I swear I had heard this noise before, but I couldn’t exactly pinpoint where it was from, maybe from a TV show or a podcast. The click echoed, as if it were in an empty warehouse, travelling from the epicenter into what sounded like a never-ending void that bounced off the walls of the store for miles and miles. I don’t believe that it dissipated but rather continued to travel far enough away from me to hear it, because after a minute the click passed, and I heard two.

In an instant, I remembered what the noise reminded me of: Suits with long protruding ventilation filters, people going into situations that they know they won’t come back from, as the suits neared the epicenter of the atrocity the frantic clicking became louder and louder, replacing any other emotions beside fear. A chill ran down my spine and a cold realization filled my head with clarity.

It sounded like a Geiger Counter.

Someone, please help me, I think it's getting close.
