January 24th, 2025 was the date of my accident.  I blame myself as I was too drunk to realize how drunk Blaine was. When I got into that car after drunkenly begging Blaine to take me to his place, I sealed both of our fates. 

We came to the blind curve just a few miles away from his apartment. It was there he drove off the road and flipped the car at least three times down the steep cliff. By the time the accident was reported, I was unconscious and lost a lot of blood but still had a faint pulse. 

Blaine was pronounced dead on arrival while I was rushed into emergency surgery.  I died on the operating table. After nearly two minutes of reviving measures being taken, the medical staff was about to give up when my heartbeat slowly came back. Or so I was told. 

I woke up in a brightly lit room I didn't recognize. My last vivid memory was driving to Rico's house for the party. And of Blaine. Everything else was fuzzy. I remained in the hospital for a couple days after regaining consciousness and learning the fate of my ex boyfriend. 

Going back to my own apartment was bizarre. My parents begged me to come back home but I couldn't. I needed to be alone to come to terms with reality. 

It was hard. I was so sore and my normal movements were a struggle; walking, showering, even eating. It was the third day in my apartment when I was trying to eat microwaved soup that I first heard a voice. 

"Hey!" I heard an older female voice yell. "Where are my cigarettes?!" 

I froze as chills covered my body. I moved my stiff neck as I looked around my small apartment to find it empty except for myself.  

I shook it off. The isolation was getting to me obviously.  That night I awoke to the same voice, "Benny! Where are you?!" I jumped into full consciousness and immediately felt the pain from such a sudden movement. "Can you hear me?! Where's Benny?!" The voice cried both in my ears and my head. 

I sat up in bed feeling terrified. I almost called my mom and asked her to make the five hour drive to come get me. At day break, I finally fell back into a dreamless sleep. 

It's been a couple months and my physical health has improved. My physical therapist is impressed with my progress. I don't dare tell them my mental state has only declined.  

The random voices have only become louder, clearer and more often. The voice I hear of the older woman in my apartment is basically a daily occurrence now. Her name is Rhonda and Benny was her son. She calls for him often. I learned all of this through Cassie, the employee in the leasing office I became friends with.

Of course, I never told her I could hear Rhonda, but she did tell me the previous tenant in my apartment, named Rhonda, died of a heart attack in my apartment. This was after some pushy questions about the previous tenants. She lived with her son, Benny, who moved out after her tragic passing. 

That's not the only voice I hear now. I hear them in various places now.  The most recent being the strong male voice I heard while visiting the local park. 

"That bitch took my money!" I heard a deep male voice bellow to the right of the bench I was sitting on. "I need help!" His voice grew sharper. I looked to see who was yelling such things but wasn't surprised to see absolutely no one. 

I quickly left and headed back to my apartment. I was completely insane, there was no other explanation. 

I lost my mind when I learned Blaine had died. I had broke up with him for such a stupid reason despite the fact I was hopelessly in love with him. He'd still be alive if wasn't for me. 

I inserted the key in my door until I heard the lock turn over. I entered my small apartment hoping Rhonda wasn't feeling talkative.  I was grateful for the silence as I plopped down on my couch. 

I looked through the notifications on my phone. Texts from both my mom and dad were a daily occurrence as well. It was the text from Rico that made me pause. I clicked the notification as our text conversation spread across the screen. 
"Hiiii! I hope you are doing as well as can be expected! Are you feeling up to coffee at our usual spot?" 

I stared at the screen. Many friends had reached out since the accident and I hadn't really responded to any of them. One hadn't though. My best friend since childhood, Rico.... until now. 

I thought he was angry with me. Angry I didn't listen when he told me not to end things with Blaine. Angry I did it anyway. Angry I didn't just stay away from Blaine at the party like he had texted me to before the party. Angry Blaine, his other childhood friend, was dead now. Angry it was because of me. 

As I was debating on answering, I heard Rhonda, "Shit! Benny! I need help with dinner!" I suddenly smelled smoke. I jumped off the couch, thankful movements like that didn't hurt so much now. I hurried into the kitchen to see it empty.  No smoke or old ladies cooking. 

I scratched my head as I turned to head back to the couch, "Hey! I know you can hear me!" Rhonda huffed. 

I refused to answer the voice that wasn't really there. I sat back down on the couch to text Rico. 

Me: I'm here. That's about it. When do you want to meet?

Rico: I didn't think you'd respond but I'm glad you did! Tonight at 7pm???

I hesitated but answered:

Me: Sure. I'll see you there. 

Rico and I was always joked about being caffeine addicts. "6:00am or midnight! Coffee is the answer!" We'd chant and giggle.

I looked over my appearance one last time in the mirror. I hadn't met anyone since the accident. I had only recently returned to working my work-from-home job, and I refused to get on camera. My supervisor was, thankfully, understanding. 

As I left the apartment, I heard Rhonda call, "Hurry back!"

I locked the door to my apartment and was grateful for the relatively quiet walk to the coffee shop. I walked in and hurried to mine and Rico's normal table before any of the workers could recognize me. 

My heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest as I saw him enter the shop and immediately look to our table, his usual stunning smile on display when he saw me. He headed to the counter and I figured he'd order our usual.  

I felt like I'd throw up as he walked towards me and took a seat across from me.

Me: Uhmm... hi!?

Rico: .....Hi? That's all you can say after all this time?!

Me: I don't know what to say. It's not like you came to see me in the hospital or reached out after!

Rico froze then looked down at his lap.

Rico: You're right. I'm sorry! I'm a shitty friend! I just.... I didn't know what to do or say!

I felt myself relax a bit. 

Me: It's okay, really. I haven't been myself anyway. 

After this, Rico told me what had gone on in his life and I told him of my recovery and my physical therapy. I left out the voices, of course. It almost felt normal again.... until....

Rico: He really loved you, Kris. 

I nearly choked on the last of my iced coffee. 

Me: What???

Rico: Blaine. He absolutely loved you. Enough to propose....

I felt my head start to spin and like I would see my coffee again. 

Me: Rico, please...

Rico: He was crazy for you. He'd never do.... what you heard. 

I immediately got up. I dug in my purse for some cash then threw it on the table. 

Me: Thanks for the chat. I have to go. 

I could hear him trying to stop me and call me back but I was out the door in a flash. 

Images of that night came back to me as I practically sprinted home. The party, me approaching Blaine, me kissing him and asking him to take me to his place. 

My eyes burned with tears as I arrived at my door, rushing to unlock it and hide in my sanctuary from the rest of the world. 

As I entered my apartment and slammed the door behind me, I could feel something wasn't right. I wasn't alone. 

As I slowly turned to look at my couch, I froze. 

I had only heard things, never seen anything... until now. 

There, sitting on the edge of my couch, leaning forward with his arms resting on his thighs and looking straight ahead, was Blaine. 

"I've missed you, Kris."
