For the past few days, I’ve had this unshakable feeling of being watched—constantly. Don’t get me wrong, I checked everything, and nothing seemed out of place. But the feeling won’t leave me alone. There’s nothing wrong with my mental state. I’ll break it down for you.

I’ve always been athletic, ever since school. Even though I graduated college years ago, I kept my workout routine solid to maintain my health and discipline. Running is my go-to exercise, mainly because I love it, but also because gym memberships are ridiculously expensive.

There’s this park where I train every day. It’s small, but I like it. Being outdoors gives me some quiet, some peace—time to clear my head. But there’s a downside. It’s an old park, built decades ago, and sometimes the lights go out. When that happens, I either cancel my run or find somewhere else to go.

Back to my story—I had just finished my run and was walking towards the park entrance. It was late, 8:43 PM. I don’t know if time is important, but I feel like I should mention everything. If something happens to me, I want you to have all the details.

That night, the park was empty. It’s never empty. Usually, there are people walking their dogs, riding bikes, just hanging around. But not that night. Just me, the benches, and the lamp posts lining the path.

As I slowed my pace, something hit my shoe. I looked down and saw it—a phone. Not a smartphone, but one of those old ones with a tiny screen and a keyboard.

I picked it up. Maybe I could find the owner’s info and return it. But as I scrolled through the menu, a notification popped up.

I clicked it without thinking.

My stomach dropped.

It was a picture of me. Took from my back 

Someone had sent it to this phone. The number was hidden.

How?

Before I could react, I heard something behind me.

A whistle. Three sharp, high notes. It pierced through the silence and sent a chill down my spine.

My heart stopped. My brain screamed one word: RUN.

I bolted. Full speed.

I glanced back once. There was nothing—no one.

And yet… there was.

I can’t explain it. I saw something. A figure. Tall. Too tall. Dressed in black, standing by the bushes. Watching me from a neighbor’s yard.

But it wasn’t human.

The shape was human, but the proportions were wrong. The head was too long, stretched vertically, three times the length of a normal person’s skull. The arms were ridiculously thin and long.

Maybe I was dizzy from running, but I swear—it was real. It was staring at me, but with no eyes at all. Just two hollow cavities looking at me. 

I sprinted all the way home. Fourteen minutes. I barely remember getting inside, locking the door, and collapsing onto the couch.

And the phone? I brought it with me. Biggest mistake of my life.

I told myself I wouldn’t touch it again unless someone called. Maybe I could return it and be done with these weird stuff.

I showered, went to bed. Passed out immediately from exhaustion. Everything was fine.

Until a noise woke me up.

Glass shattering.

From the kitchen.

I flinched, heart racing. I don’t have pets. No kids around. My neighbors are all old. No one should be in my house.

I got up. Slowly. The floor creaked under my steps. Then—

The whistle.

Same three notes. Lower this time.

The sound grew louder with every step I took until, by the ninth step, it stopped.

Replaced by breathing. 

From inside the walls.

I froze. My own breath caught in my throat. The breathing went on for thirty long seconds. Then—

A whisper.

From the next room.

When I finally stepped into the kitchen, nothing was broken.

Just a plate. Sitting in the middle of the counter.

I stared at it. Confused. Too tired to care. I went back to bed.

The next morning, it was still there.

I put it away. Weird, but harmless.

Then it happened again. The next morning. The same plate. Same spot.

Then again.

By the third day, I started to feel sick. Like something was wrong with me. Like I was being pulled into something I couldn’t escape.

Then May 17th happened.

That night, the phone rang.

I picked it up.

Silence. Thirty seconds. Then—a cough.

And a voice.

Low. Raspy.

“Andrew. I see you.”

My blood turned to ice.

I hung up.

How come he knows my name? 

Hands shaking. Heart pounding. I stared at the phone, willing it to disappear.

Then my own phone buzzed.

A notification. A photo.

Taken from the top corner of my room.

Like a security camera shot. I could see myself, lying in bed, staring at my phone.

I looked up.

Nothing was there.

Then—

Another notification. A text.

“Like what you see?”

I screamed.

Called 911. The cops came, searched my house. Nothing. They stayed all night. I didn’t feel safe, even with them there.

Morning came. The plate was back.

But this time, there was something written on it.

A number.

Drawn in dark red ink.

Or… something else.

I scrubbed it. But as the water hit the plate, I realized—

It wasn’t ink. It was blood.

The next day? Another plate. Another number.

It was different though. It was written with human nails. 

Then 4.

That time, the nails were swapped with eyes. Human eyes. 

Then 3.

No numbers anymore, but organs. Fresh. Moving. As if they’d been ripped out seconds before.

By then, I was getting photos of myself sleeping. Every night.

Then day 2 came.

The plate disappeared.

I received a call.

I picked up.

The voice whispered.

“Two.”

Then a message. A photo.

I opened it.

A human face. Cautiously peeled off from a head. 

I ran.

Left my house, booked a hotel. I’m here now, writing this. It’s 9:21 PM.

I can’t do this anymore.

Tomorrow is day 1.

I know what’s coming.

If you see me on the news, know this:

Never pick up a phone from the street.
