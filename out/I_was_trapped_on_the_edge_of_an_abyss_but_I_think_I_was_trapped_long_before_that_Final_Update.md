Trevor clicked on the razor, and the bathroom filled with a sinister buzzing, like the wings of angry wasps whipping around my head.

“You ready for it?” He asked in the most upbeat tone he could muster.

“Yeah,” I told him.

He began to close it in on my scalp, but even over the loud whir of the device, my breathing betrayed me. It was fast and heavy, and my eyes looked into my reflection’s with a dull panic.

He hesitated for a moment before clicking it off.

The sound of silence rocked me from my trance, and I turned to him as he came into view, leaning against the counter to face me.

“We don’t have to do it just yet. We could wait a little while.”

I took a deep inhale to tame my wild breath and shook my head, “No, we’d better do it now before it gets any worse. You saw how much came out.”

My eyes still wouldn’t meet his, and he knew I was burying something, so he reached out and nudged my chin up with his fingers. My gaze fell on his handsome face, and he gave me a smile, “What’s going on? Talk to me.”

I could feel tears threaten to leak out, “I don’t know, Trev, I guess…” I turned back to my reflection, “It just makes it real. The last few weeks have been such a blur that I keep thinking it's gotta end soon and go back to normal. I shave my head though, and…”

With my good arm not currently bound in a cast, I reached up and combed all my locks back to my hairline, trying to get an image of my future.

“All of the sudden, it’s not normal anymore. My whole life, I’ve been afraid of this, and if I cut all my hair off, I’m making it a reality. I’m coming to terms with surrendering the next who-knows-how-many years to doctors and machines and…” My eyes met his again, now freely flowing with tears, “I’m scared, Trevor…”

He set the razor down and moved forward, taking my face into his chest just in time to dry my face. He cradled my head softly as I sobbed, brushing his hand through my locks for what I’m sure he knew might be the last time in a while.

Maybe forever.

“I don’t want this to be the way I remember myself,” I sniffled, “If this doesn’t work, I don’t want everyone’s last image of me to be frail with a shaved head—I want it to be me.” Another swell of emotion rose in my throat, and I looked up at him pathetically, “I don’t want you to think I’m ugly.”

It was a very ‘June’ thing to end that sentence on.

Trevor had been so gentle and patient with me throughout the entire chemo process so far, always being sensitive to my feelings and how things might be affecting me. He knew today was going to be an especially hard step; I’d voiced before how much seeing my mom shave her head for chemo affected me.

That’s why when he suddenly started laughing at that remark, I knew he had to have a pretty damn good reason for it.

Still, I got a little huffy, “Trevor! This isn’t funny!”

“No, I know; I’m so sorry, baby, it’s just—” he quickly gathered his composure then cupped my cheeks tenderly in his hands. “Hen, I will never not think you’re beautiful, bald or not, so let’s get that clear right now. If you not having hair is a price that comes with not losing you again, then I’d take you any way you come. Do you hear me?”

He wiped a tear away with a thumb, and I swallowed my sobs before nodding.

“I know you’re scared,” he continued, “but nobody is going to remember you like that, Hen; we’re all just happy that you’re doing this. And I promise you, when this works out—because it *is* going to work out—all of this?” he said, grabbing a ribbon of my hair and holding it up, “You won’t even remember there was a point that you didn’t have it. Because the hair doesn’t hold your memories, Hen. You’re still ‘you’ as long as you’re here with us.”

I let out a soft snicker, then wrapped his waist and closed my eyes, letting myself find ground once again under his love. The weeks since I’d returned home had been a wild clash of stress and relief, and I knew that rhythm was going to carry forward into my treatment. It was going to be a while before things felt normal again, but at least I had Trevor and my dad to help keep me anchored among the storm.

I don’t remember much of what happened after Ann faded from the physical plane and returned to me. I have hazy memories of walking up to the control room main console and punching around random inputs on the computer, but no specifics of what they were. I mainly just remember the emotions of it all.

I was tired, my body a chugging machine running on dying breath and oiled with sweat and tears. I could barely make it up the catwalk steps; my body was so worn and broken. The fear came next. Fear that everything was about to be in vain—all the progress we’d worked toward on the shelf.

When all was said and done, there was really no way of knowing if the drill would start, and if it did, would it really be able to take me home?

That was the lingering dread I felt with each screen I flicked through, looking for the right settings or program to run the massive system before me. With each error message that I didn’t understand, I winced, hoping that it wasn’t a vital process that the drill needed to function.

I did find one setting that caught my attention and made my throat dry, however. A tab dedicated to something called the *‘external gates’.* It listed that they were open, and the last passage through was listed as a few months back, the same day that I’d found myself in this awful place.

With a bitterness behind my eyes, and a sense of spiteful pride in my heart, I scrolled down to the bottom and clicked the option listed near the bottom.

*‘Shut down’.*

Finally, after poking around for several more heart-pounding minutes, I found what I was certain I was looking for.

Under operations, there was a list labeled *‘instances’*, all numbered 1 to 16. The last on the list was highlighted with a blinking box, and based on the context, it was my current location. I shuddered a bit at the thought that Kingfisher had carried out this process 16 different times, which meant at least that many innocent people had been used as ‘tributes’ to fuel the rigs.

That wasn’t even counting all the many presumed failures; lives lost in complete and utter vain for such a twisted cause.

None of that mattered anymore though. The screen blurred through my teary vision as I moved the cursor up to a slot above the instance list, an option titled *‘Open to Point of Origin’.*

My hand trembled as I clicked on it, softly muttering prayers over and over that it was the last input I’d ever have to make on these cursed machines.

The screen changed to that of a blank line that simply informed me it was processing the command, and after a few more moments, it switched back to the main screen, a new update at the bottom telling me ‘*Ready for launch’*.

I felt my breath sputter out in one final, choppy sob, then looked over to the panel next to me. There, an empty keyhole shone beneath the bright lights above with red and green buttons below them.

I slotted the key, turned it with a mechanical whir, then, when the green button illuminated, I stabbed my thumb into it.

For a moment, nothing changed. The fans on the main control panel began to hiss louder as the system crunched some unseen code, but that was about it. Then, all at once, the drill kicked to life.

The two massive brass and steel arcs of metal near the far wall began to rattle and vibrate, and all other pipes and motors encased in the wall began spooling up. The lights flickered slightly as the whole compound began to rattle, and my heart beat fast as it began to sound as if the whole place might explode. But just as it began to reach its climax, and I thought for sure my only exit would collapse and leave me stuck alone, it stopped, and the space between the columns changed.

Where the concrete wall once was, an image tore into existence, as fast and as jagged as a crack in glass. I nearly missed it by blinking, but I caught the rift tearing outward to meet the edges of the pillars, making a perfectly rectangular portal from ceiling to floor.

It wasn’t like something out of a movie. It didn’t glow or have swirling patterns contained within. Wind didn’t whip around the room, and loose papers didn’t begin getting sucked inside. In fact, it was eerily quiet and still now, nothing but a consistent, deep hum filling the air of raw energy being spent.

The ‘portal’ looked like one giant mirror that had been installed on the wall. It was clear as glass, and looking through it to the other side, I could see the exact same control room I was sitting in. Everything looked the same except for the state of decay and the only person currently standing in it. I was fascinated by the thing, but I knew that I had only one chance to cross through, and imprint was a fuel that didn’t last forever.

I hurried down the walk and started for the exit.

I moved up the large vehicle ramp that Kingfisher must have used to drive supplies through and stood like an ant before the wall of energy. The buzzing was louder now that I was nearer, and though the image was still, looking at its edges, I could see them vibrating ever so slightly, like the illusion was going to shatter any moment.

It made me anxious to touch it, but it made me even more scared that it might do just that, so holding my breath, and with one last look back at my forlorn prison, I crossed through.

I didn’t feel any different when I did. No pressure on my lungs or enhanced pain in my limbs like I’d expected. Just the usual soreness and aching that had been present for a while now.

I stood there on the other side for a beat, looking at the new, dusty, dark compound ahead until the vibrations in the air began to falter. The ringing pitch began to slow like a motor revving down, and when it became audible enough to hear each individual rotation of whatever machine was keeping it alive, it died. The portal made a small static pop, like an old CRT turning off, then the mirror was gone; just a concrete wall once more.

I turned back to the room, that numbness still heavy on me, but once it hit that I was actually through, I felt my limbs begin to jitter. My fingers twitched, my knees wobbled, and a smile began to tug at the edges of my lips. I yanked my phone out of my pocket to see that I still only had the few phantom bars I’d always had, but opening it to the dial menu and calling 911, I actually heard it begin ringing.

I didn’t even let it do so more than once. I hung up, jammed it back into my pocket, then rushed forward.

Adrenaline hit me like it never had before, the power of relief so much stronger than that of fear and anger. The smile that had been on my lips had turned into full-blown laughter that echoed off the concrete halls as I retraced my steps through the compound. It was empty and abandoned like the one back on the other side, and while this one was in better shape, I didn’t even worry about anyone being around.

Catch me if they want, I had already won. I had been to hell and come back to tell the tale.

Reaching the front doors, I was nearly jumping in place at how antsy I was to get them parted. I pounded a fist on the button to open, and with a loud screech, they began to part like the gates of heaven. Divine light shone through the crack—a sight that felt like a lifetime since I’d seen it—and I had to close my eyes; it was so foreign. That was okay though. The warmth of the sun gleaming against my face was enough to satiate me while I stood there adjusting once more to a world I’d lost.

When I could open them again, I ran out, tears streaking behind me as I took in the bright blue sky above. Birds chirped and fluttered from the forest on the cliffs high above, and from the distant shores, I could hear waves tossing violently against the rocks.

I was home. I was finally home.

But that didn’t mean I was out of the woods yet. If I had just fired up the drill and opened those compound doors, I was sure that somebody from Kingfisher’s organization would come looking soon. I didn’t intend to be here when they showed up.

I began running through the town, not even remembering that my leg was broken. It was so odd seeing it all in the daylight, still eerie in its abandonment, but not at all with the bite it once had. The tower looming over it was nothing more than a sleeping giant now, and the cliff behind me held no rusty catwalk or makeshift ladder drilled into its stone. There was no Warehouse booming its music on the far side of the shelf, and there was no Zane’s Jammin' Jungle to add color to the milquetoast palette of brick and mortar.

It was just our boring, plain world, and it was the most beautiful it had ever looked.

Back on the main road, I looked both ways, nearly falling to my knees to see that the bridges in and out of town were back. In the darkness I had ridden in on, they looked precarious so high above the sea, but now in the slowly sinking sunlight, they looked like sweet, beautiful freedom.

There was only one issue. There were miles and miles of wilderness beyond them, and in my current state, I wasn’t going to make it even a fraction of the distance I’d need to in order to find help.

I thought of a lot of ideas in that moment. I could search the town for a vehicle to use, but in my first search through when I’d arrived, looking for any people, I’d never seen any. This place was more like a nuclear testing town; all dressing with no substance.

Walking was certainly out of the picture, so that really only left me one option. I didn’t know who Kingfisher had ties to, but I just needed to trust I would be safe.

I pulled my phone back out and let out an exhausted huff, setting myself down on the nearby curb.

Dialing 911, I let it ring for real this time, then when an operator picked up, I let the woman on the other end know who I was. Told her that I’d been missing for several months now. She asked what my current location was, but I told her I didn’t quite know; just somewhere along the coast. After a bit more detail exchange, she told me to stay where I was and that she’d pinged my location for help.

I was so tired at this point that I lay back against the concrete, looking up at the sky as it began to dull into a brilliant orange.

The woman on the phone told me to stay on the line, and asked if I was in any danger. I told her I didn’t know for sure. She asked a few more questions, but her voice began to grow distant in my ears. I could tell that consciousness was fading, whether due to internal blood loss or just pure exhaustion, so with a weak apology, I told her I had to go. I don’t know if it’s wrong to hang up on an operator like that, but frankly I had a more important call I needed to make.

I pulled up my browser, and though the signal was incredibly weak, I managed to get a search out for my own name. Dozens of news articles from local stations and even a larger one came up detailing my mysterious disappearance, and in the one I clicked on, I saw they even had eye-witness accounts from the last gas station I’d stopped at, reporting that I’d been through.

Scrolling all the way to the bottom, I found their number, and I copied it to call.

The person who picked up didn’t seem like the right place to report a story, but my eyes were drooping and I didn’t care. I let them close with the phone still to my ear, and let the secretary know who I was and that I was okay. I told them that I was safe right now, and police were on their way, so if something happened to me before I was found safely, look deeper into it.

If Kingfisher had as much power as it seemed, they might have their fingers in the local police. If they did, they would certainly be able to make me disappear after finding me, so this was my half-hearted crafting of a safety blanket. A way to get word out to a mass so big they couldn’t cover it up.

I don’t know if my words made any sense to the secretary I was talking to, or if they thought it was a prank call, but it was the only attempt I had time to make. I heard them repeatedly calling my name over and over as my hand went limp and hearing began to fade, then my mind began to dull.

It wasn’t sleep like normal; it felt like what I imagine dying to be like. If it was, then suddenly all the fear I’d held for it these years, all the hushed veneration I’d had since my mothers passing—it all seemed so silly.

It was warm, and slow. My body went numb, and I could feel my thoughts going still. Just pure tranquility as I floated into a vast unknown.

I swear I heard a voice there, one last small sensory that broke through before it all shut down.

A voice much like my own, with the cadence that Hope once talked in, softly cooing, “It’s okay, Hen. It’ll be okay.”

When I woke up, I got to experience the other side of that coin. The joy that my mother must have felt each morning she opened her eyes in that hospital bed, knowing that she had one more day just to spend with her loved ones.

First the room came into view, an old familiar sight. Sterile and white; soft floral patterns tracing lines on the walls to not make things too dreary. A small TV hanging on the ceiling in front of me and a fan in the corner, then, to my sides, IV drips and humming machines. A window to my right looked out into a hallway with bustling nurses and doctors, and sitting on the seats in front of them were two people that I’d never been happier to see.

Dad was in a chair by the window, head resting against the wall as he drifted in sleep. Trevor was closer, his chair pulled to the side of my bed as he lay with his head pressed to my thigh.

Weakly, I lifted my hand and placed it on his scalp, gently brushing through it with a trembling smile. It took him a few moments to stir under the soft affection, but when he did, he lurched up in shock, his eyes going glassy and his mouth parting for his labored breath. I couldn’t hold back the tears as I met his gaze either, and without a word, we both exploded toward one another.

It was harder for me; my body was in extra agony now that the magic adrenaline was no longer coursing through it. That didn’t matter though—Trevor met me most of the way, curling his arms around me and sobbing hard into my shoulder as I kissed the side of his head repeatedly. The chaos stirred Dad, and once he saw I was up, he practically leaped from his seat and ran to my other side, leaning over to take me in too.

I’d never felt so much elation in my entire life, there among the embrace of my family. I once told Hope back in the abyss that Zane’s on my 7^(th) birthday was the last day I remember being truly happy, but right then, in that moment?

 Almost 18 years later, and it had finally been dethroned.

What followed was a whirlwind of emotions, questions, and apologies. Trevor once again tried to apologize for our fight while I begged relentlessly that they both forgive me for scaring them so badly. Dad tried to apologize for making me think that I couldn’t talk to him about my cancer, and I reassured them both that they had done nothing wrong. I was being foolish, and I had never meant to hurt them in such a way.

Between our sniffling requites, doctors began funneling in and checking on me, letting me know the state of my body and asking me how it was all feeling. I assured them that I was okay and feeling good, and for those first 30 or so minutes, everything was the perfect happy ending.

But then the police came.

I wasn’t nervous because I thought I was in any sort of trouble; after all, I was the one who had been in distress. They weren’t going to arrest me for being lost, and based on the level of my injuries when I was found, it was very believable that something terrible had happened to me.

The problem was, there was no way that I could tell them what really happened, and I hadn’t even thought about the idea of what I was going to say to authorities upon returning home. I needed an excuse that would pacify, but not raise suspicions should it get dug into more.

Being put so on the spot, I did a pretty poor job. The only thing I could think to go with was what I assumed everyone already thought of the whole ordeal.

When I stopped for gas that fateful night in that small coastal town, two men approached me and knocked me out. I was kidnapped and held for months on end, thinking they were holding me for ransom or waiting to sell me into some sort of trade.

I lied (more than I already was) and told them that they never touched me, but kept me drugged up enough to not recall much. One day though, I was lucid enough to make my escape, and so I did my best to free my bindings, resulting in the broken arm and leg. I managed to get back to my belongings, which is how I called for help, and the rest was known from there.

There were several inconsistencies that I know the officers caught on to. The town was the biggest smoking gun. They surely investigated to see it all abandoned, and I had no idea if when poking around the scene of the crime, they found the compound in the cliff side. On top of that, if the men holding me were living there, why didn’t they notice I escaped? And where were they now?

Luckily, I did have some backing on my side too. The lack of my car, the strange clothes I’d been found in, and of course, my injuries. The story wasn’t too impossible to believe, and for the time being, was enough for the officers to leave and start an official investigation.

It was a problem that I knew would rear its head another day, but for now, it would bide me some time.

At least, that’s what I thought, because there was clearly someone else who was interested in what I had to say to the police.

There was a specific doctor on the team who had been caring for me that I noticed skulking around often. He’d always pop in when I was talking to a group for a while, whether it be doctors, Dad and Trevor, or the cops. He’d enter, then either flicker through papers on my charts, or fidget with something on the machines before leaving. None of the other staff seemed to interact with him much other than knowing his name, and he never talked directly with any of them, or even me for that matter. The most I’d ever gotten from him was a smile and a nod upon meeting his eyes.

At first, I just thought he was very focused on his job, but the more I noticed him, the more suspicious he became, and then the more my heart beat faster whenever he was around. He began giving me more sidelong glances when in the room, and eventually, staring me down altogether when he noticed me doing the same. He became just as suspicious of me as I was of him, and finally, it came to a head after the second visit I’d gotten from police, one where they’d brought forth several suspects of the people who’d captured me.

I’d managed to shoo them off again, telling them that no faces matched, and after watching the doctor trail out of the room with them, I called a nurse to my side.

“Yes, honey? What can I do for you?”

“Sorry to pull you aside,” I told her, “It’s nothing important; I was just curious—that doctor that I keep seeing move through here, the tall one with the glasses—is he my primary?”

The nurse pursed her lips and looked out the window with a furrowed brow, “No, dear, he’s just a specialist. I believe there was a request put in to transfer a specialized physician for your injuries? He’s new to our hospital, only came in a day after you arrived.”

My mouth felt dry, and the bed felt like it dropped out from under me, but I did my best to put on my calm face. I also tried to sound confident as I said, “Oh, well, would it be possible for me to speak to him alone? I have some concerns over my recovery that I’d like to address.”

The nurse flashed a smile and nodded, “Sure thing. I’ll be right back.”

Luckily, Trevor and Dad were already absent from the room, Trevor having left to get food for us, and Dad having pardoned himself to sort out some insurance issues at the front desk. When the doctor came lurking back into my dim room and stood looming in the doorway with a blank expression, all the safety I’d felt since I’d left the void withered away.

“Yes, Ms. Hensley? The nurse said you wanted to speak to me?” the doctor awkwardly stated.

I smiled and nodded to the machine beside me, giving a wary expression, “Um, yeah, last time you were in here messing with this, it started making this weird buzz and it won’t stop—it’s driving me a little crazy,” I chuckled, “Could you take a look at it.”

“The machines make noise, ma’am, I assure you it will stop eventually—”

“I really think you should look at it,” I cut him off, smile still glued to my face. Behind it, my heart was racing, and my hands were shaking, but panic was urging me onward, and what’s more, I just wanted this to end. I’d just made it out of that hell of a place; I wasn’t going to have ghosts from it coming to haunt me.

Reluctantly, he moved over closer to my bed, and once he was near, I spoke again, my smile fading and voice coming out sharp.

“Are you with them?”

He paused and turned slightly to look at me, “Pardon?”

“Are you *with them?*” I asked again, venom in my voice making it clear I wasn’t going to play his game.

“I’m sorry, I don’t quite understand what you—”

“Look, you’re clearly afraid of what I might tell people, and I already know who you are, so can you just drop the act so we can draw a line in the sand?”

The doctor was fully turned to look at me now, hands still on the machine and kneeling head level to me. I could hear the blood rushing in my ears as his cold eyes met mine, his vacant expression looking much more tense so close. I feared that he may reach out and grab my throat, or snap suddenly and draw a weapon, but he never did. Instead, he slowly stood, moved back to the door, then shut it.

Turning back to me, his face was different now; still plain, but with knowing eyes.

“Are you a real doctor?” I asked him, “Or was that part a lie too?”

“I’m a real doctor.” He nodded.

“Then you’ve read my charts, and you probably know my condition past these broken limbs and bruises, yeah? Hell, I’m sure you did your digging on me the moment I went missing out near your stupid little science project.”

“We know all about you, Ms. Hensley,” he threatened, an evil burn to his gaze, “more than you possibly could imagine.”

I didn’t buy into the intimidation. Doing my best to keep my face confident and scorching, I hissed, “Then you know that once I get out of this bed, I don’t have long left to live anyway. And even if I do, why would I want to spend the rest of my life locked up in an insane asylum, or running in fear from you all?”

He didn’t respond, just kept analyzing me.

“I don’t give a shit what you were doing out there. I don’t care to get justice for what happened for me, or any of the other poor innocent souls you all fucked over with your recklessness.”

I saw a flicker of emotion on his face for the first time at my words. I couldn’t tell if it was anger or guilt, but whatever it was, it made me worried I might have crossed a line. Still, I carried on.

Ann’s callous determination helped me to carry on.

“All I want is to live the rest of my life in whatever peace I can find, then die. I don’t need to be tangled up in whatever hell you worthless assholes are trying to unleash. You heard what I told the police, you know I don’t care to tell the truth, so please. You already robbed me of enough. Just leave me. The fuck. *Alone.*”

The buzzing from the machine next to me really was driving me up the wall now in the silence that followed. I kept my fangs bared, but it was hard to maintain that air when his eyes pierced so thoroughly through me. I worried deeply about what he was thinking—what sort of scheme was going on in the man’s head, but ultimately, I’ll never know.

Softly, he spoke, “You know what will happen if you ever tell anyone?”

“I have an idea.” I growled. “The story I gave the police, can you make that go away?”

He nodded, “We’ll sort that out. For what it’s worth, Ms. Hensley, I’m sorry for what happened to you.”

I shook my head, “You know whatever you’re doing has to stop, right? If you keep picking at that well, eventually it’s going to burst, and I don’t think you’re going to be able to stop the flood that comes through.”

The doctor didn’t answer me. He just turned and crossed back to the door, placing his hand on the knob to open it. Before he did, however, he paused, turning back in thought, as if he was daring to speak again. Finally, he did.

“What did you *really* see in there?”

“Go to hell,” I told him.

With that, he left, and I never saw him again.

The other doctors, though, I saw plenty of. Recovery was slow and painful, trying to get used to the new stiff casts locking two of my major limbs. Ironically, I had more use over the things before they got properly set, but my real doctor informed me that I was lucky to have not had to lose them with how messy the injuries had been beneath the skin, so I suppose I could suffer the mild annoyance for a little longer.

Still, if I thought the aching of my bones was bad before, it was even worse now with several of them shattered.

Beyond that, though, there was one monster left for me to fight. One last demon I had decided to conquer. The same one that had chased me out onto that highway in the first place.

Dad and I had a long talk about my cancer once the main parts of my injuries had been resolved. The hospital had already taken new X-rays and tests while I was there. Big shocker, the cancer was still present, and it hadn’t gotten any better. What’s worse was that with my new injuries, it wasn’t going to be easy working chemo around them. The mass of it had started around the hip of the leg I’d broken, which made things complicated, which in turn, scared me greatly.

Still, I had made a promise to more than just Trevor when I called him back at the compound. I had made a promise to myselves.

I was going to fight.

But first, I held Dad’s hand tightly with teary eyes, unable to meet his own, “Are you sure you’re going to be okay with this?” I asked him, “I don’t want you to have to watch this happen twice, Dad… I don’t want you to have to fight along with me like you did with Mom just to lose it all.”

He pulled my hand tightly to his lips and kissed it softly, his eyes closed like I was the most precious thing in the world, “Henny, I’d go through hell and back just to have you one day more. This? This is nothing.”

I could see when he finally opened his eyes that he was scared just like I was, but he still pulled up a smile. That warm, kind smile that had cleared so many grey skies and calmed so many raging seas. I squeezed his hand that had kept me from floating away so many times even tighter, and then gave him a smile of my own.

A smile from straight from Hope.

And that leads me back to the bathroom. After several weeks of chemo, my hair began to clump out in the shower, and though I’d been expecting it, I’d at least hoped it wouldn’t begin so soon. I tried to put it off as long as I could, but eventually, I decided that I’d rather buzz it now rather than watch it go thin and patchy.

Trevor and I went out to buy a razor, then went home and set a stool in the bathroom.

“Alright. You ready for it?” he asked again.

I looked at my reflection in the mirror, then worked up a smile. With a deep breath, I said, “Go for it.”

The machine felt odd across my scalp, feeling the locks that I’d spent almost my whole life growing fall loose to the floor. It was jarring at first—how could it not be? Being ‘bald’ is something that’s a little hard to imagine when transferring from a full set of hair. Still, after a moment, it wasn’t as bad as I’d thought. I looked different, but to my surprise, I didn’t look awful.

Still, if my eyes lingered too long, I’d begin getting critical, and that was something I’d been working hard not to do.

I needed to keep my head above the water.

Instead, getting lost in my own eyes, I drifted once more into memory. The process of all the hospitals and chemo had dredged up a lot of memories of mom once again, but for once, I was seeing the world with new eyes. I was no longer trapped in my own dark, hopeless prison that I’d built for myself—the future looked new.

Even if I didn’t make it, I was happy to try, and with that new mindset, I couldn’t help but know in my heart that Mom once felt the same, despite what I had convinced myself.

I never noticed how right Hope had been about me drowning the good memories until one rose to the surface, making my chest tight and eyes water. It was painful like I’d always known, but now it felt different as it danced behind my eyes, a sense of warmth coming with its bittersweet taste.

The markets in December were always grand in our small town. While we didn’t get snow, it would always get cold, and the Christmas lights hanging about still helped it feel like a proper winter.

Mom walked with my tiny hand in hers, my face hugged close to her sweet-scented blue coat and hot chocolate heating my other hand. She chased the chill away with her warmth, stopping to admire different shop windows or market stands. Being young, I didn’t appreciate much other than toys, but her company was more than enough, and the snacks she would stop to buy me kept me plenty at bay.

On our way out, though, something did catch my eye that usually didn’t: clothes. A grand dress shop window lit with warm bulbs shimmered out into the blue light of the street, elegant dresses of my size prominently displayed in the window.

Mom noticed the sudden resistance from her hand, and turned down to look at me, tracing my gaze and smiling.

“Pretty, huh?” she asked.

I nodded, slurping the rest of my hot chocolate down.

“You all done?”

“Mhmm,” I chirped.

“Good. Let’s go inside and take a look then,” she said, plucking my cup and tossing it in a nearby bin.

I was young at the time, and I didn’t quite understand money, but I definitely knew that my family didn’t often own nice-looking things, and whenever I asked, it was usually a solemn no returned. That’s why I lit up a bit at my mother's words.

“We can’t buy one though, can we?”

“Well, there’s no harm in looking,” my mom winked, “Let’s try a few on. And who knows, maybe if you really like one of them, Santa will bring it for you.”

The cold air of the winter was chased away by the billowing warmth of the shop as we stepped inside. The older shopkeeper greeted us with a smile and asked what she could do for us, and my mom handled the rest. I wandered away from her to get lost among the stands of magnificently crafted garments as she chatted about a changing room, and when she was done, she came over to see me staring up at one flowy, glittery dress before me. It looked like a rose in clothing form, and with a hand on my shoulder, my mom spoke.

“You like that one?”

I nodded.

Before long, we were in the back room of the shop behind some curtains, a cozy, warm lounge lit with those soft golden lights. I shuffled out of my clothes, and Mom helped squeeze me into the dress, both of us giggling at how much harder it was to slip into fancy clothing than it was into our casual stuff. When I was done, though, she stood me up on a little platform they had near the mirrors, and I posed with my arms out twirling in place and feeling like a princess.

I remember thinking the mirror before me was strange; one I’d never seen before. It was a tri-fold one—the kind with one front and center and two angled in. I thought it was funny the way each one showed its own reflection, fragmenting me into four separate versions of myself. I was so entranced by this effect that I stopped moving to marvel at them all; the other three Hensley’s staring back at me.

My mom approached from behind, beaming at them in the mirror along with the other versions of herself. Of course, I know now that she was just marveling at me.

She knelt to be level with me, wrapping my waist from behind and placing her head onto my shoulder with her bright smile. I recall thinking in that moment, seeing her wild red locks next to mine, that I hoped someday I could be as pretty as she was.

Apparently, I was already more than enough for her.

“Oh, Henny, my little angel, you’re perfect,” she marveled, staring a moment longer before kissing me on the cheek, “every little part of you.”

I remember the last part stuck with me. Those five words echoed through my mind for all my life; It was what made the memory so hard to revisit, I think. Seeing myself throughout time fall into a sad, shallow husk of a girl compared to what my mother believed me to be.

For the longest time, I thought I’d become irredeemable. I thought I’d decayed so much that I could never find those parts of me that she once saw. I didn’t realize that people are much more complicated than that, though. Down isn’t out, and there’s always goodness still buried in the darkest, filthiest parts of us that we deem too lost to save.

Once upon a time, trapped on the edge of an abyss—one that I was living in long before the shelf—I never could think that every part of me was perfect the way it was.

But there, staring at myself in the mirror, my head now shaven and Trevor holding me from behind kissing my cheek.

I think I’m starting to [believe her](https://www.reddit.com/r/InkWielder/).
