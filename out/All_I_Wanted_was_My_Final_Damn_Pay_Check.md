I took this factory job just to make ends meet. The world is a load of shit right now, and all I care about it making sure the rent is paid and my dog is fed. My day job is sous chef in a mediocre restaurant downtown, and it fucking kills me. I’m exhausted in a way I didn’t think was possible. It pays shit, and that only got worse so now I work seven days a week. Five in the restaurant, and the weekend in that fucking factory.

The place makes no-name pieces for mechanics and engineering, I think. I don’t work the assembly line, just moving crates and boxes to and from storage. It’s painfully mindless. The storage facility was a living, breathing OSHA violation. The crates should be stacked no higher than three – about 18 feet in height – and the boxes should be only two to a shelf, with the shelves only built up to 40 feet. I learned all this in the two hours of ‘training’ on my first shift. By the third hour, I saw that none of those rules mattered. The storage room had no functioning locks, even a slight budge from a boot could open them. The place seemed to slope at an angle, everything was so fucking messy. There was one stack of crates, about six of them, that partially collapsed some months ago and it’s such a hazard they just left it. The workers think if they attempt to move it, it’ll just cause an avalanche. With each crate weighing almost a tonne, I don’t blame them. Not my problem. But besides those glaring issues, the place is also full of vermin. Like, I mean *full*.

I asked around eventually, being the curious piece of shit I am, if the place used to be a wholesaler or something. You know, a big food warehouse that restaurants buy from. The place my head chef bought from wasn’t far from the factory (a trip with him was actually how I found the vacancy for the job) and the whole area was rows of generic factories, warehouses, and dilapidated hovels that used to be thriving businesses. The sheer number of rat traps and bug zappers in that wholesalers outnumbered the produce two to one. If the factory had been one in the past, wouldn’t have put it passed the new owners to have just dumped the remaining produce in the basement and turned it into vermin breeding paradise. By the end of my first shift, I had saw at least four individual rats scampering along the shelves. Not one other worker gave a singular shit about it. My manager, an asshole called Gary that walked around like a stereotypical mob boss, hands covered in fake gem-encrusted rings and gold chains around a fat neck, said that as long as they weren’t getting into the staffroom and stealing his lunch, it’s not his fucking problem. The other guys were apathetic at most. I guess I don’t blame them.

 

Two weeks ago, while I was on shift, there was an accident. I was barely awake after pulling a late night at the restaurant, so I had about four hours sleep before my shift started. Not being a complete imbecile, I decided to not do the forklifting as there was no way I wasn’t going to fucking kill myself with it. This big guy called Ruiz did it instead. The place is full of immigrants and their English ain’t the best, but they’re good, hard-working guys trying to provide for their families. Ruiz, on the other hand, I can say with my no-professional-understanding is a bit slow. I don’t even know what the call what Ruiz ‘has.’ My youngest brother has that autism thing, and I know it can be different for different people, but I don’t think it’s that. I think he legit fell on his head as a kid and it knocked some wires loose. Ruiz is the first to offer to help, but he has, like, no memory retention. You can teach him the same, simple thing a dozen times and he’ll forget it instantly. But he also works nearly 24/7, sometimes just turning up and working a day for free. Asshole Gary clearly abused that shit. That day, Ruiz was not supposed to be in. But I took him up on his offer to help. As long as you stood by directing him, he’d do the job fine.

I was stood about ten feet behind Ruiz in the forklift as he manoeuvred the crate down the row. Near the end of this row was that stack of collapsed crates I mentioned earlier. There was space just enough for the forklift to pass by without issue, and Ruiz had done it a few times before. The other thing about Ruiz, is that he scares easily. A few of the other workers like scare him and see this six-and-a-half-foot toddler scream while running away. The easiest way to spook him was saying a rat was nearby. Ruiz was terrified of them. I had forgotten this in my barely awake brain that day.

Sometimes, if they were feeling really brave, a rat would pop up on the shelves where us humans were. I don’t know if like some rat badge of honor they earn, but just one would get as close as possible to a human and rear up on its little legs as if to square up for a fight. Some guys would back off, others would kick out at them to chase them off. Well, one rat decided to do just that Ruiz as he was taking the gentle turn to circumvent the collapsed crates. It appeared on one of said crates, its weird pink tail whipping about behind it. Before I could do anything, Ruiz fucking *flipped*. He stood straight up from the forklift seat screaming, and bashed his head into the seat frame, sending him right back down onto his ass. The crack that came from his skull was gut wrenching. I was frozen with shock. As he landed, he must have caught the steering wheel, as the forklift screeched towards the stack of crates.

People aren’t lying when they say time slows down during accidents. I felt like I was stood still for hours as I watched the forklift smash into the crates. It was like a movie. Ruiz climbed from the forklift, blood gushing from the indent on his forehead. I’m pretty sure I saw white bone. He looked at me and he looked fucking terrified. I couldn’t move. My feet, my arms, everything was like concrete. Somehow, I manged to look up as the crates began to fall. Ruiz had managed two wobbly steps before a crate crashed down on him like a shoe on a bug. Then another crate. And another. Somewhere in that pile of broken wood and rusted metal parts was Ruiz, but it was impossible to see as a tsunami wave of rats flooded towards me.

It’s funny, during such a traumatising event, your brain decides to think of other things. All I remember thinking was *well, I guess that’s where the rats were nesting*. It’s hard to describe the feeling of hundreds, possibly thousands, of rats running past you. You feel every whisker, every tiny, clawed hand, every oily, bristling hair. Even through thick jeans and steel-cap boots. The shock was in full gear, adrenaline rushing through me harder than the six cups of coffee I had that morning, and I was moving through the swarm towards Ruiz. The tiny bodies just moved out of the way of my steps. As soon as it began, the flood was over. A handful of victims lay dead around the crates. Some trampled by their brethren, some caught by the debris. I couldn’t see Ruiz at all. The crates had exploded open on impact and shit was everywhere. I didn’t know what I was looking for until I found it. Another step left something soft but rubbery under my boot. Expecting the corpse of a young rat, I stepped down harder. A squishy *pop* spat trails of blood and clear jelly from under my shoe. I grabbed my foot to investigate and found what remained of one of Ruiz’s eyeballs, hazel pupil and some ribbons of eyeball jelly still intact. I think that was when reality finally returned to me, and I fainted.

 

I woke up on the stained couch in the staff room. An EMT was on one side of my, and asshole Gary stood over while arguing with someone behind him.

“Hey there, I’m Paul. I believe your name is Eric. Do you know where you are, Eric?” The EMT said gently. I nodded,

“At work.”

“That’s right.” The EMT patted my shoulder. “There’s been an incident Eric. I’m here to make sure you’re doing okay. Are you injured? I have looked you over while you were unconscious, but I may have missed something. Do you remember what happened today? Do you remember if you hit your head?”

“No… I, I just fainted.”

“Do you have a headache? Will you let me give you a quick check? Just need to shine this light in your eyes to see if your pupils are dilating normally.”

The image of Ruiz’s eye flood backed to me, and I vomited there and then. The EMT gave a weak smile and helped clean me up. Gary was still shouting at whoever behind us, but I did catch snippets of it. Something about accidents happen, how no one gave Ruiz permission to work the forklift. I was too weak to protest there and then.

 

Last week was fucking chaos if you couldn’t have guessed. A whole news crew turned up to try and get some info on it, trying to use is as an ‘illegal immigrant’ horror story. I was told this by a coworker who was texting me updates. At the same time, Gary was trying to call me day and night. I never answered. He texted in crazed fashion, threatening to bargaining to begging, and back to threats. I knew it would either be an outright threat if I answered the calls, or a thinly veiled threat and pay me off to not say anything. I went back to my restaurant shifts as usual. I know, I know. Despite everything I still needed to pay my bills, as well as a nice new bill from that fucking EMT. Only the head chef knows what happened. Only minor details anyway. I didn’t tell him about the eye. He gave me a funny look when I said I was still going to my shift on Saturday. In truth I wasn’t planning on working. I just wanted to say I quit to asshole Gary’s face. Not that he’d give a shit, but if I get the chance to make his day slightly worse, it’s worth it.

To my surprise, the factory was empty when I arrived Saturday morning. My usual shifts were afternoon/nights, but there was a 24-hour shift rotation. Only one car sat in the parking lot – Gary’s shitty Toyota pickup. Good enough for me. However when I grabbed hold of the front door it was locked. I peaked in the windows. Nothing, all the lights turned off in the front office. Banged on the door. Nothing. I decided to ring the coworker who had been texting me updates.

*Oh, it got shut down man. Yeah, some guys from OSHA came in and declared it all unsafe or something. Gary lost his shit. Sorry I didn’t let you know man; I’ve been looking for a new job. Y’know he tried to get that shit cleaned up by the regular team? Crazy shit man. They walked.*

Well shit. At least all I had to do was get my final check from him and be done with it. I left my car parked close by but not within sight of the building. I just grabbed my backpack and that was all I had with me, but I did always keep a switchblade in my boot. You never know.

With the front office locked up I decided to hop the fence into the back of the storage area. The only security measure we had in the whole place were cameras in the storage room and one pointing out to the parking lot. I didn’t give a shit about them seeing me. What are they gonna do, fire me? Anyways I headed to the main door and gave it a good slam. It opened with ease. In fact, I don’t think it had even been partially locked. I shouted Garys name and there was no response. All the lights were on off so had to use my phone’s flashlight to see anything. I called out again. Nothing. I started towards the office before realising I had to pass… Where it happened. As I came to the row I slowed down involuntarily. A part of me expected Ruiz to still be there. Piles of shit still on top of him. Dead rats all over the floor. Blood still pooling.

But there was nothing. It had been cleaned up. The junk was gone, the bodies were gone, the blood cleaned away. It didn’t make me feel better. I just kept walking towards the office. All the fight had left me. I just wanted my check and to never set foot in that shithole again. I knew Gary would put up some argument. He was just that sort of asshole. But I wanted my money and then I’d be gone, and I’d even keep quiet on everything if need be. Don’t judge me.

The office was silent. I checked the staffroom, and it was empty. Only the buzz of the refrigerator. There were two ‘offices’ in there, one for Gary which was shared as the ‘security’ room, and one for the assembly line foreman. I’d never met him before, but I knocked on the door just in case. No answer, and it was locked. I expected to see a depressed and furious Gary sitting at his messy desk, security cam monitors to his left. He wasn’t in there. The door was unlocked, and I quickly noticed his keys were on the desk. Along with his phone. That was unusual – the asshole was on his phone constantly, even when he wasn’t obsessively phoning people to offer hush money. And the keys. The key ring had every key for the building, just sitting there. I decided to see if I could find my check in his desk. He was the sort of prick who wanted to hand them out manually, despite constantly complaining about it, so no ‘problems’ occurred. You know, like someone seeing the immigrants get cash instead of a cut check. If I couldn’t find any checks, there should have been a cash box in that desk somewhere. It was a Catch-22 if Gary tried to fuck me over about it. To my knowledge, OSHA closed it down for safety violations, but they weren’t aware of half of the shit Gary was up too. With keyring in hand, I tried out the keys for the desk’s locked drawers. The security monitors showed a few low-res images of the storage room and parking lot. I kept an eye on it with each attempted key. Gary could come walking back in at any time. Six keys down and nothing. My hands started to sweat. I was no thief – my mom raised me better. However, I knew what was owed to me. Anything extra I could hand out to the homeless around this area. It would be Gary’s first act of charity, and my pleasure.

Bingo. The eight key worked and the drawer fell open. A bunch of unorganised documents hid a tin box. I’d seen it before when grabbing previous checks. It also needed a key, but my hands were no longer sweating. I’d get what I was owed and be done. I unzipped my backpack and threw it inside, before starting on which key looked to be the right one.

I near jumped out of my skin when I heard a sudden crackle of static. One of the fucking monitors was crying out for a new tape. Yes, an actual *tape*. The VCR sat below them and blinked in similar frustration. The monitor in question showed the further back area of the storage area, to the right of the door I entered in from. *Shit.* If that prick came back and checked the tape he’d see me walking in. A spike of panic hit me. I had Gary to rights, I knew it, but that made me look sketchy as fuck. I searched the desk for a remote control, finding it below a pile of unopened envelopes with red text URGENT and the stamp of the Department of Labor on the front. I started pressing buttons in a bit of a craze. The thing was so old the fucking symbols had rubbed off.

Finally, something worked, and the monitor began to rewind. A sigh of relief escaped me. As the ripples of static wriggled across the screen, I could just about make out myself walking backwards through the storage room. Perfect. Problem solved. However the stupid thing kept rewinding. I had no clue which button would stop it, or eject the tape. As I stood to press the eject button on the VCR itself, I noticed something else move on the tape. I tried to pause it, but the buttons weren’t playing nice. Someone, not me, was wandering the storage area. The time read about twenty minutes before I arrived. Finally I found the play/pause button. I took a moment to check outside the office. Nothing had moved but my nerves were shot to bits. It *must* have been Gary. But where was he?

I pressed play. The resolution was awful, but a guy – about Gary’s height and weight – was stomping about between the rows. He was carelessly pushing and shoving at the crates and boxes on the shelves. Same anger issues as Gary. There was no sound, but it looked like he was cursing at them. Shaking his head and fist. He got away with a lot of shit for that long. Must have been a shock to finally get shut down. Then he stops, and looks to his left. Down into the rows of shelves. He stomps his foot hard, still staring down the aisle. With a shake of his head, he heads down into the row, just out of sight of the camera.

I don’t get spooked by much, and my nerves were already on edge, but a real chill shivered down my spine as I continued to watch the tape… And only saw me enter the storage room, about ten minutes later. I paused it. A lump caught in my fucking throat. What the *fuck*. That fucking weirdo must have watched me enter the fucking building. Waiting for me to go into the office. The fight had returned to me in full swing. I ejected the tape and threw it in my backpack. I slammed the office door open and marched towards the storage room. I didn’t know what I was planning to do. Blood was pumping through me red hot. Even as I came closer to where Ruiz died, I was completely focused on finding the asshole skulking around in there. With the lights off, it was difficult to see far down the rows that weren’t close to the open back door. I used the flashlight on my phone to head down the row I thought Gary had headed down. I was about half way along when a pair of tiny yellow lights popped up in the middle of the floor.

I near jumped out of my skin. It was a fucking rat. Fat one too. It looked straight at me and then scampered away under the right shelf, fat pink tail slapping the concrete floor. Then, another pair of shining eyes appear. And another. The hair on the back of my neck shot up. Those two didn’t scamper away. They stared back at me, completely unbothered by my appearance. One licked its paw and cleaned its face, while the other simply sniffed the air. In a flash, they both bolted for the same shelf as the fat one had scurried under. I followed them with my phone. It took a moment, but then I noticed they had run into something on the floor. Something had spilt. With the amount of shit in those shelves, it didn’t surprise me if some cannister or bottle had burst. Maybe that’s what Gary had gone to look at.

Maybe I’m just a bit dumb, or I was too stuck on finding Gary, but it took me far too long to notice the color of the liquid. I was about five steps away when it hit me. It was deep red. Some engine oil can turn a red tint. That was not oil. Engine oil doesn’t smell like copper. My head thumped with fear and flashbacks of Ruiz. I held onto the shelf to keep myself upright. Did that piece of shit not get a proper clean up crew to sort it all out? But then, that didn’t make sense. That row wasn’t the same row where the accident happened. It was two rows over. How the fuck did that blood get there?!

I can’t describe the noise I made when I felt the whiskers on my fingertips. I tore my hand from the shelf and shoved my phone’s light to where I had held onto. There sat a rat – another fat one – sitting up and staring back at me. Its fur was saturated with blood. But it wasn’t hurt. Its little black eyes kept my gaze for far too long. Then it turned and squeezed past the boxes on the shelf. Little streaks of blood were left on the cardboard. Whatever the source of the blood was, was on the next row along. It wasn’t until I was just turning onto the row that I remembered about Gary.

My blood ran cold. *Oh no*. What had this piece of shit gotten himself into. I crept around into the next row and shone my phone down it. Couldn’t see much. The shelves were so overloaded half of it hung out in the way.

*Gary* I half-whispered. *Gary, you son of a bitch. I know you’re there… Are you hurt?* Well, fucking obviously, but I still had to check. I got no answer. Instead, all I heard was the faint sound of tiny claws on concrete. A lot of them. I must have spooked the rats down there. With a deep breath, I started down the row. More tiny footsteps scampering away. The flashlight picked up the glaring, curious eyes all over the shelves. There must have been a whole fucking swarm of them. Beyond the stares, two crates sat blocking most of the aisle. I’d have to either climb over one, or squeeze past them. At six feet tall, I wasn’t climbing the damn thing. I don’t think the old wood would be able to hold my weight. The squeeze would be tight though. I put the phone through first to light the way. I was half way through when a rat ran over my feet. I instinctively kicked out and booted the crate, dropping my phone and sending the entire world into darkness. How the fuck could this week get worse.

I continued shimmying past the crates and felt out for my phone with my foot. Nowhere. The sounds of tiny feet started up again and my heart started to race to match. I got on my hands and knees, against every screaming bit of sense in my body, and pattered about for the damn thing. I yelped as I felt fur brush my fingers, a shiver rushing over my body. I no longer gave a singular shit. Once I found my phone, I was out of them. Fuck Gary, fuck that factory. I reached out again and – Yes! Got it. I fumbled with it to get the flashlight back on, sending the curious furry creatures that had surrounded me running off. I lifted it up to see where the little vermin were fucking off too when I saw the boots.

Vomit shot into my throat in an instant. About ten feet in front of me lay what was left of Gary. All my limbs went weak as the sight became clear in my head. His boots were there, and his usual work jeans were as saturated as that rat had been. I couldn’t see much else, because a dozen of fat, bloodied rats were sat on him, burrowing their faces into his torso. Smaller rats picked at his legs and what looked to be an arm. Some rats were as close as arms reach from me, washing themselves and each other of the remnants of their meal. One rat, a fat one, sat perched on its hide legs staring right at me as it gnawed away on a finger, a garish ring stuck on the torn away knuckle.

It's a bit of a blur after that. I know I squeezed back through the crates and never looked back. Before I knew it I was in the drivers seat of my car, drenched in a cold sweat. I drove home in silence, threw all of my clothes into the washing machine, and climbed into bed. I’m still here now, my dog asleep on my lap and writing this on my phone. The security tape is still in my backpack, the money tin as well. I’m going to destroy the tape tomorrow. Try and open the tin too. But right now, all I can think is. Was I hearing the sound of claws on concrete… Or teeth on bone?
