Some people think that working a job that leaves you retired by the age of 20 would be a dream. It really isn’t for two reasons: one, life is incredibly boring, retired unless you have more money than you know what to do with. Two, and most importantly, the job that leaves you retired at 20 was probably not worth working to begin with.

While life is slightly boring, being retired at the now age of 22 and working in a library of a mountain town of Colorado it surely beats fighting the supernatural. A person can only witness so many gruesome scenes before they start losing their mind. Or at least that is what my old contractor wants me to believe.

I worked for an old family; they’ve been here since the start of the Americas. You won’t ever find them because, simply, they don’t want to be found. While they paid me handsomely for only a 5-year contract, they don’t extend another one because they think minds get warped seeing the paranormal every day for five years.

While they don’t extend another contract that hasn’t stopped me from seeking out the supernatural. See I actually liked doing the work, and I was good at it, like really good. Not to brag but only one of ten people to ever live through a full contract. I think that anyone can be good at hunting the supernatural given they use their brain and aren’t just in it for the money, but most people look at the contract paying 10 million over 5 years and sign without thinking of it.

But anyway, I moved to this small town because of the supernatural. This is because it exists on a ley line. A concentration of supernatural energy that draws entities to it. And while most ‘cases’ I’ve tracked down over the last two years have only been a case of black mold that causes mild paranoia, one has just popped up locally that has piqued my interest.

It is not uncommon for people to go missing in small mountain towns. Usually, one disappearance a year or so but this winter has left four missing in the last two months. Now when I say disappearance what that usually means is they find someone’s car off in a ditch after a wreck in the snow with no trace of the person. They aren’t actually missing but the snow is too deep to search for them and they find them when the snow melts off in June.

However, these four disappearances are weird- they’re weird in the sense that the people were accounted for the night of the disappearance but in the morning are simply gone. The town’s paper is calling it a serial killer and the police are high alert, but I know better than that. I know because I’ve been to the houses where they have left from and the scene there is not one of a serial killer, at least not a human one.

See I have a gift for seeing magic; that’s one of the reasons I was so good at hunting in the first place. All supernatural entities leave behind magic, some are better than hiding it than others. Most entities don’t care about covering their trial because most people can’t see remnants of magic or if they can they don’t know what they’re looking at. But for me, who’s hunted, I can tell almost exactly how a scene played out just by looking at a place where a supernatural being has been.

These disappearances were hard to make out though. Not because the entity was good at covering its trail but because it was so bad at doing so. The houses of the missing were full of magic swirling like a tide pool. The magic danced around the houses twinkling with shimmering lights reminiscent of the aurora borealis on the brightest nights. While it won’t be easy to track what this entity is capable of, it will be easy to see it coming, like a bull in a china shop.

Hunting the supernatural isn’t all I’ve made it up to be. There is a lot of waiting around. Most times you must wait for an entity to strike before you can know what it wants. So that’s what I was doing. You do have to watch your health being a hunter as there are only so many late-night burgers you can eat while waiting for a being to appear. I didn’t have to wait long before it struck again.

It was 2 A.M. in my car listening to another repeat of my favorite album when my scanner came alive.

“Sheriff, are you awake? Sheriff Smith it’s an emergency”

On the other line that I had secretly tapped into I could hear grumbling as the town’s sheriff stirred awake.

“Uh huh. I’m awake Stacy go ahead.”

“Mrs. Benister just called in to say her husbands missing. She wants an immediate response.”

“Yeah, I’ll head over and check it but he’s probably just sundowning again in the cold.”

The Benisters live on the outskirts of our town. Nicest old couple you’ll ever meet. Highschool sweethearts and all that jazz. But the sheriff is right, Mr. Benister does have a bad case of dementia and has a habit of wandering around at night, but with not a break in the case so far, I figured I would drive and check it out.

I snuck my car down the road past the Benisters before the sheriff could get there and this was not the case of Mr. Benister taking his usual midnight stroll. The house and the road were oozing remnants of magic of a being just being there. I knew I had to act fast if I wanted to keep Mr. Benister from being the next victim of this monster.

I kept driving down the road for about another mile before seeing the trail of magic leading into the wood away from the road. I parked my car on the side of the road and swiftly threw it in park before popping the trunk and grabbing my old kit from it. I held the kit in my hand feeling its light weight but filled with versatile tools before taking off into the forest.

It had been a while since I had been on a chase like this, and it felt good to be back. Weaving through the silent trees not needing any light to guide me because the streaming trail of magic would lead me where I needed to go. It felt surreal, to be doing the thing I loved so dearly again. But I got carried away. The excitement of the chase again made me forget how many tricks these entities have up their sleeves.

As I approached a clearing, I could see Mr. Benister sitting quietly in the middle of it, fresh magic swirling all around him. Without seeing an entity, I figured I could swoop in and grab him and then return to the sight after dropping him off and then dispatching of the entity. I was too cocky though.

As I stepped into the clearing, I failed to pay attention to my surroundings. Before I knew it I heard a loud crack in the trees to watch a boulder falling down swiftly. I rolled out of the way before it could turn me into a fine mist but failed to notice the snare that had left me slamming my head into a nearby tree when pulling me up and turning my world to darkness.

I came to not long after. The night now pitch black with almost all magic dissipated. I could hear something going through my bag of tools but without any magic or light around I could not see it.

My thrashing around trying to get out of the snare caused the creature to stop. I could hear it shift its head up and while I couldn’t see it, I knew it was looking at me.

“Quite a bag of tools you have here hunter.”

I froze; this creature could not only speak but knew what I was. I knew I was in danger and for one of the only times in my career I panicked.

“When I get down from here, you’re going to be really sorry. I’m going to make you-“

“Tch tch human” The creature chittered at me.

“You aren’t getting down any time soon and when my master hears he’s gonna be thrilled to eat a hunter.”

An entity that can speak and work with other creatures. That means it could only be one thing but before I could fully wrap my head around it, I saw a blinding white light shoot up from the snow as pure magic wrapped around me.

“Don’t want you to die up there while I return the old man but don’t want you to escape either,” said the voice as the rope holding me was severed and I came crashing to the ground.

As I lay on the ground, still trying to gather my breath as the wind was knocked from me following the fall, I could see what had me in a hold. Standing eye-to-eye to me while sitting in the snow was a gnome. He was only about three feet but they are some tricky entities none the nonetheless.

“Hey why don’t you sit around for a while,” snickered the gnome before trotting over and gently touching Mr. Benister's forehead. Mr. Benister rose almost instantly in a trance ready to do whatever the little gremlin wanted.

As the gnome and Mr. Benister started walking towards me to leave the forest the gnome turned back to me mockingly.

“Don’t have too much fun while I’m gone. The real party will happen when I get back.”

I watched the gnome skip out of sight with Mr. Benister in tow.  I knew it would be a while until the gnome got back because he could only make the old man walk so fast, which meant, I had some work to do.
