I don’t remember dropping the case. One moment it was still in my hands, and the next it was gone, clattering against the wet concrete somewhere behind me. I couldn’t stop and grab it – I couldn’t do anything other than run.

The rain made the whole facility shine. Floodlights burned through the fog, and every time I crossed one, I felt like I’d be shot right there.

They were still shouting in the distance. I heard their boots following me, the cackling of the radios. I’d trained with those voices. I knew the way they’d move, the tactics they’d try to capture me. That’s why I wasn’t really scared of them.

What I was scared of was the silence that came after.

Everything suddenly just stopped. No more steps behind, no more radios, no shouting. Even the floodlights seemed to disappear. After a few seconds of this silence, I could hear something that truly terrified me.

A long, cold howl.

I’d only heard it once before, muffled through a dozen steel doors. Subject 03 – The Hound, they called it. They told us, “The Hound chases. If you run, it goes after you. If it goes after you, you’re already done.”

Well, I didn’t really have much say in the matter – if I have even the slightest chance to survive, I’ll take it.

But I knew why they’d sent it. I opened a door that should’ve stayed closed.

It wasn’t part of my assignment. I was supposed to log samples, write a report, and leave. But for some reason, after completing everything, I *couldn’t* leave. The Subject – not 03, a different one – was there, in its cage, shivering in the dark. I don’t know what came over me – maybe I was tired of being told what was dangerous and what wasn’t. Maybe the stories of rebellions inside the Order affected my judgement.

It doesn’t really matter anymore. I remember opening the door to the cage with my keycard – the one I’d just gotten two weeks ago after a promotion. It didn’t even look at me when I stepped back. Instead, it moved past me like it already knew the way out.

By the time the alarms started, it was gone. And so was I.

And now I was running away from a monster that was, according to my supervisors, impossible to outrun. I began to hear claws scratching metal behind me.

They scraped against the concrete, closing the distance every second. I’d seen 03 restrained before, but seeing it restrained and seeing it loose were two *very* different things.

The first time was years ago, during training. We weren’t even allowed to enter the same room as it was in, because the threat it posed was too substantial. We watched behind reinforced glass panels as the muzzled and chained Hound walked in circles around its enclosure, its ribs visible under the lights. Even then, it never stopped moving.

And now it’s after me. My coworkers would describe this situation, and the likely outcome, as the “worst case possible”.

As I ran, the stench of wet dog hit me. I dashed through an old warehouse, shoving over stacked crates, trying to outmaneuver my pursuer through the old machinery. My boots splashed through the puddles, and the sound gave me away – I heard the Hound sniff, searching for me in the warehouse, followed by claws on steel.

I ducked behind a forklift, my chest heavy with anxiety, trying to control my breathing. The metal frame of the forklift was cold against my back, and every sound seemed to stretch longer than it should have.

A low, animalistic growl escaped the Hound’s mouth. It was pacing somewhere between the stacks of crates, occasionally scraping the walls, as if trying to remind me of how close it was.

Although every part of my body told me not to, I peeked out, trying to catch a glimpse of 03. It was crouched low, its head positioned at an unnatural angle. The muzzle from its mouth was gone, which meant only one thing – this was a death sentence.

As the Hound turned away, I bolted from cover, trying not to slip on the wet floor, and ran to the far side of the warehouse where a door hung half-open. Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for my pursuer to notice me, as before I reached the door, I could already hear its claws slamming against the forklift.

‘The docks aren’t far,’ I thought to myself. If I could get to the water, maybe find a maintenance boat, I might make it out. Looking back, it was the *only* way I could escape.  

I hit the door at full-speed and stumbled out into the night again. I couldn’t see the floodlights anymore, and it seemed I was in the back alleys.

As I ran, for a split second I thought of training again. They made us watch the Hound circle under the lights. “It doesn’t rest,” the instructor told us. “It also doesn’t lose interest. It’s the perfect weapon if we need to catch someone.”

My boots kept splashing through puddles, and 03 was relentless. I pushed trash cans over behind me, trying to slow it down, at which I was successful.

Another flash of memory cut through the panic – the Subject I freed. What if that had been the wrong call? What if all I’d done was open the door for something worse?

The thought vanished when I heard the Hound stumble. I looked back just enough to see it hurl itself around the corner, its legs slipping. The monster’s ribs were visible through the rain, its mouth stretched wide open.

I turned and ran, trying to keep that image out of my mind.

The alleys opened onto the docks, and I saw rows of boats sitting in the fog – a fog so thick that I couldn’t make out which boats were seaworthy and which ones had been rotting there for years.

I’m not sure where the Hound disappeared to, but it wasn’t behind me – ‘Is it injured?’ I asked myself, already knowing the answer. My lungs were ready to give out, I knew I couldn’t outrun the beast for much longer.

One boat sat tied to the end of the pier – a skiff, small and battered, but intact. I didn’t dwell much on the idea, just ran straight for it.

I heard a howl again, and before I could turn around, I felt the pier shake under the weight of the Hound. I could hear it getting closer, and I was slowing down.

My fingers fumbled with the knot, for what felt like minutes, and I couldn’t untie it. I yanked until the rope bit into my hands, and my vision blurred with panic. Every step, every scratch made my heart beat faster as 03 approached.

I dropped to my knees and pushed the rope against a nail sticking out of the pier. I let out a final groan as I started pulling on the strands until they broke apart. Finally.

I jumped inside the boat and picked up the oar, trying to push myself away from the pier. And as I turned around, I could see the Hound ten feet away from me, its claws reaching deep into the planks as it rushed forward. The boards splintered and snapped under it.

I shoved the oar hard against the planks, and the boat started moving across the water just as 03 launched itself at me. Its jaw was unhinged wider than before, snapping shut where my arm had been just a moment earlier.

The boat rocked violently, water spilling over the sides as one of its claws raked against the hull. I swung the oar again, jamming it between those teeth, the wood cracking under the pressure. The Hound let out a sound that was less of a howl and more of a *scream*.

It released the boat, and managed to get out of the water by climbing back on the pier. I’m not sure whether it looked back at me or ran back to the facility, as the moment I was free, I began rowing. And I rowed until my arms gave out and the fog swallowed everything behind me – the dock, the warehouses, the facility.  

I let go of the oar and just sat there. I thought back at the events, which all happened in the span of 10 minutes at most – from the breach, to my escape from the Hound. Against every prediction and lesson I’d ever heard inside those walls… I escaped.

The current carried me further out, and I stared up at the rain as I moved. I thought I might laugh, but all that came out was a cough. As for the Subject I let out, I don’t know if they ever recaptured it. Maybe it slipped back into the ocean and they’re still searching, just like I did.

I know they’ll keep hunting me, as what I’d done was inexcusable. But for tonight, at least, I [won](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/).
