If you are reading this you need to know a bit of back story...

This happened to me a few hours ago and after I write this here I will try to forget about it as much that is humanly possible.

So please listen to my story.

&#x200B;

With a squeal from the trailer and the car stopped. "Damm," I thought after looking at my phone, "11 pm, I overdid it again." It completely slipped my mind, it had already been 2 days of driving. "I should send her a message that im fine." I started writing on my phone: "Sorry Babe, I forgot to send you a message that I stopped, I should be there tomorrow morning, right now im going to get some sleep, Love you ". A bit of a lie is not gonna hurt anyone, after all, she let me drive so far alone only after I accepted her condition that I will stop after every 8 hours and sleep for 6 more before driving again. But im so close, GPS says only 45 minutes. I closed my eyes, pretty much instantly falling asleep.

&#x200B;

BANG! I jumped in my seat, looking around at what happened. A storm came while I slept, heavy rain pouring down the windshield. FLASH followed shortly by another BANG, "The lightning must be hitting the ground close for it to be so loud" I said to myself while picking up the phone." 3:45 am, well im not going to get sleep in this storm and I feel fine, so I can drive to the seller's house and get some more sleep at his driveway, as we agreed." I started the car, putting it in the drive. With another squeal, my car with the trailer started moving again. Slowly driving out of the gas station resting area I got back on the highway.

&#x200B;

"Recalculating, a new route found." sounded from the GPS, I looked at the screen, and the new route was 10 minutes faster. "At least for something your good for," I said while driving off the highway.

&#x200B;

"F\*\*\* me this can't be right!" I screamed out loud while looking at the road in front of me. The road was narrow, for a car and a half max, I would be ok if I haven't had the trailer, but with the trailer, I knew it would take the whole road. If I meet someone driving the other way I can't do anything. I thought to myself while tapping the screen of the GPS, looking for another way. "It's the only way from here?!" Sigh, "If I will have to reverse somewhere there, I will drive the car over you," I said to my GPS while a small chuckle came out of me. Slowly driving forward into the deep forest.

&#x200B;

I had been driving for only 10 minutes, sweat was running down my head and the road was much narrower than I thought. I had a problem with every single turn, and to top it off I was on the side of some hill, one side of the road going long way down and the other a way up and the Forrest got even deeper. The only thing that ran through my mind was that if im going to drive off the road im dead, and with this rain, I can't see any..." and like that the rain stopped, not a single drop hitting the glass anymore. "Wow, that's weird".  A flash of lightning blinded me when I regained sight I could see the car is not moving anymore. Instinctively I reach for the key and turn it. Nothing, the engine doesn't even turn. "What the f\*\*\* happened !" I yelled into the darkness around me. The battery failed? no, the headlights are working fine, so the engine failed? FLASH no why would it.... my eyes drifted in front of the car.

&#x200B;

A person? There was an outline of someone or thing, tall about 2 meters? or more. long hands and those fingers only 3 per hand, grey skin with spots of fur growing sporadically. FLASH no thunder following it. Then I saw movement in the corner of my eye. Horror went through me as I looked in the passenger-side mirror. It was there leaning against the roof of my trailer like it was examining it, it was tall more than I thought about 3 and a half meters, I could see the trailer flexing under the weight of that thing, and then the head started turning, I could feel every single molecule in my body scream on me to run, there were no eyes, no mouth, no nose, nothing just ahead. FLASH. It's not there anymore. I frantically start looking around, then I stop, I can feel the drops of sweat running down my face I slowly turn my head towards the driver's window,  I could feel it looking at me, its face is just a few centimetres from the glass. FLASH, I instantly turn the ignition key, FLASH, FLASH the car starts and I floor it, going as fast as the road let me.

&#x200B;

A few minutes after all that, I started to calm myself. There is rain pouring on my windshield again. So I might be in the clear I thought to myself. "What the F\*\*\* was that thing...." I said. My eyes look at the GPS showing my goal is about two minutes from me. "In 200 meters turn left." GPS proclaimed, not caring I just nearly had a heart attack thanks to it. "Finally!" I nearly screamed out of happiness that this nightmare was about to end. Driving up the long driveway to the seller's house was one of the best feelings I ever had. I knew that I was safe from that thing for now. Stopping in front of the house and switching the ignition off I felt like a huge weight dropping from me."Finally," I said while thinking about what I saw a few minutes ago.

&#x200B;

KNOK, KNOK I jumped in my seat snapping my head to the driver's window where the sound came from. With a sigh of relief, I saw the smiling face of the guy I was supposed to meet in the morning with an umbrella over him. Rolling down the window he instantly spoke: " Hey, how was the drive from.." he stopped mid-sentence looking at my spooked face. "So my hunch was correct they scouted you too, didn't they?" My eyes widened upon hearing that "What are they and what do you mean scouted ?!" I muttered back. "Come inside, they will come after you, probably to check out the car," He said while turning away from me. "I will leave the door opened for you, collect the things that you don't want them to rummage through." the guy shouted over his shoulder while leaving me sitting in my car. I hastily collected everything I found in my car and nearly ran to the door that was left open for me, stopping only to lock my car.

&#x200B;

The second I went through the door I closed it fast not even looking around me. Then I nearly collapsed while pressing my back against it. When I collected myself when I saw the homeowner looking at me from the first room on my right side. He spoke:" Well you're taking it better than me when I saw them for the first time." With a small smile and continued: " I prepared a bed for you in here, throw your things there, I will wait in the living room, if you want to know more about what you saw I will try to explain." Then he turned away and started to walk towards a big room on the other side of the hallway. I walked to the room he came from and threw my bag on the bed not even looking where I was supposed to sleep and immediately started to walk after him.

&#x200B;

When I went through the doorway to the living room I stopped in awe I never saw such a big living room, everything was covered in wood and old Viking art with a cosy fireplace in the middle and sofas all around. The seller was standing next to a mini bar that was placed on the wall next to the doorway. "That was fast," he said while pouring a glass of some beverage "you want some too? it's homemade meed." raising the bottle for me to take a look. "Shure," I replied, " after what I saw I need a drink" I chuckled. He poured me a full glass and brought it to me then instructed me to sit down on the sofa next to the fireplace. When we settled down he started to talk: "So, which one you saw ?" I stopped mid-sip of the drink, and then he continued: " and don't worry they don't go inside the house." with an audible gulp and sigh of relive I put down the glass.

&#x200B;

"Well, it was tall, with grey skin and patches of fur..." "Kjempe" he stopped me mid-sentence. "What ?" I asked "It means giant, I call him that, thankfully he's the tamest." "What do you mean tames," I nearly screamed while jumping from my seat, " it nearly tipped over my trailer and then tried to attack me!" " Well, you left alive didn't you ?" he said calmly while I froze. "If you left then they let you leave. You're not lucky. They deemed that you will live." I set back down and answered, "You keep to referring them as they, but there was only one." "Did you ever look up ?" I froze again thinking about the encounter " no I haven't.." "Well, that would be the problem," He said while chuckling " did you wonder why the rain stopped ? " with a short pause he continued "That was because they were on top of you. They have a ship." I started to panic inside "They are not from this world, I think I have an idea why they are here. They are probably studying us. From what I know nobody disappeared and they are only at this location. And I saw only two of them Kjempe and Beist. But I know of another two." While he talked I was still processing it...

I saw an alien...

We are not alone...

&#x200B;

I don't remember much of that night after that. Probably the combination of alcohol and stress. The next day when I woke up we had breakfast and I bought the car I was there for. But my curiosity got the better of me and I, unfortunately, asked the guy a few more questions. "You said yesterday that you saw another one, how does that one look like ?" "Well, he's a bit shorter and he doesn't have the patches of fur... And he has claws instead of fingers, he split two doors on my car in half. I can show you..." We went to his garage and he showed me what were car doors. But they were split from one side to the other with distinctive slash marks. "And the other that you said you know about ?" "Well I haven't seen them with my eyes, but my wife did." Then he went silent for a minute. "Let's just say the only thing she told me was that they spoke to her... and they told her" I could visibly see him shake "What did they tell her ?" I asked, " I don't know, but she toke her life an hour after she came home..." I didn't ask any more questions and left with my purchase.

&#x200B;

Now Im halfway home, I could sleep and had to tell someone. So that's why im writing this here I won't tell anyone else in my life, I want them to live happy lives not knowing about what is watching us.

&#x200B;

I hope nobody reading this will meet those things in their life, but if you do and they talk...

DON'T LISTEN AND RUN
