*SUNDAY*

I finally made it to the end of the week. No matter what happens today, at least I know I'll be off tomorrow. I'm not even really sure what keeps me coming back to this place to be honest; I didn't sign a contract like Bob did. Sure, it's got its charms about it, but the pay isn't great, the customers are crazy and the workers are even worse. Yet, something still holds me here. I guess, in a weird way, The Emporium is just... home. 

In reality, I've only been working here just over a decade, but sometimes it feels like I've been here my whole life. Shit, maybe I was even born here. Maybe I'll die here too. Who knows. As we sometimes like to say around here, it is what it is.

On Sundays we straighten up the store. Takes us nearly the whole shift to get it done, even with all of us here. We have to go down every single aisle and fix anything out of place, while also pulling all the products to the front of the shelf to make them look nice and full. Easier said than done in this place. 

Paul, Chris and Emma are all here with me tonight. They hate the Sunday shift, but I'm used to it. I get a strange sense of pride from making this store look normal, if only for a little while. Also, since I've been here the longest, I'm basically in charge of them all, so I can make them do all the worst aisles. 

We usually start in the back of the store, and work our way up to the front. That way we avoid the customer rush at 5:00. If they catch us trying to work, they'll stop us and we'll never get it all done. If there's one thing I've learned here, it's that the customers won't ask you a question unless they think it's going to bother you. So if you see one coming your way, best to stop whatever you're trying to do and stare off into nothing with a blank look on your face. Usually does the trick. 

We all meet up in the warehouse to discuss our game plan for the day. When I get back there, the three of them have already decided they want to try a new strategy. I listen skeptically as they tell me their idea to start in the front of the store instead today. I warned them about why that's not a good idea, but they insisted it made the most sense logistically. Okay, let's see. 

Tilly's on register duty tonight. Worst day for her to be up there with the amount of customers we get, so I know I'll be called to help. Adam says he can't come to work on Sundays because he has to be in church all day. Good, the fucker needs it. I don't know how many sessions it's going to take to fully uninstall the demon, but since he won't take medicine for it, I guess that's the next best thing. 

We walk to the front in a group, since there's strength in numbers. On the way up there, we pass The Man Who Walks In Circles, as usual. Only, this time something was different. When the man sees me, he stops walking. I'm shocked because this has never happened before, so I stop dead in my tracks and stare at him. He walks up to me, looks me right in the eyes, and puts his hand down on my shoulder. I gulped hard, as the corners of his mouth begin to creep up into a smile, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth. I open my mouth to scream, but nothing comes out. He then removes his hand from my shoulder, and walks in a straight line, right out of the front doors. 

"What the hell was that about?" Paul asks me. 

"Shit if I know." I reply, trying to hide my fear. 

At least he's gone now. Thank God. One less weirdo I have to deal with around here. I shake it off, and continue walking to the front with them. When we get there, Dennis is standing down aisle 1 in what seems to be some sort of meditative state. I totally forgot about having a new hire. I should've known he'd be back the first chance he got. Guess it doesn't hurt to have an extra hand around here, unless you're Chris. 

I introduce him to the gang, and explain what we'll be doing today. Emma compliments Dennis on his fingers, and he smiles and says thanks while wiggling them around in front of her. He's gonna regret that. I tell him to shadow Paul, since he's been here the second longest, and of course Dennis takes that literally. He starts mimicking every single move Paul makes. Even sneezed when Paul did. I know this is inevitably going to piss Paul off, but he's never killed a worker here, so Dennis is safe... Probably. 

So far, straightening is going pretty smoothly. We moved through the first few aisles fairly quickly and without incident. I start to think, maybe they were right about starting in the front. Until Space Goth turns the corner and starts flailing her arms around and screaming that she needs assistance. I freeze in place, because I know her eyesight is based on movement. Dennis *doesn't* know that, so he eagerly scampers up to her and begins trying to help. Me and the gang take that opportunity to escape onto the next aisle. 

The situation there wasn't much better. Crazy Mary was wandering around, and she can see you just fine whether you're moving or not. I tell her to wait just a minute and I'll be right back with my pee cup, but she tells me not to worry about it. She's got plenty enough she says, and doesn't need anymore. *Uh oh...* I know I should be relieved, but it honestly just leaves me feeling more unsettled. Something isn't right here tonight. 

I tell the crew I'll be right back, and head to the warehouse to clear my head. As soon as I walk through the doors, a gust of wind hits me and a disembodied voice whispers my name. 

"Bob?" I ask, into the wind. 

"No, Tom. It's *me.*" It answers. 

Suddenly, the smell of rotten egg surrounds me, and I wince and start gagging. 

"Did you really think you could get rid of me so easily with just a glass jar? You fool! You've only made me stronger." 

I fall to the ground, my eyes filling with tears, trying desperately to cover my face with my jacket. I roll over to my stomach, then army crawl out of the warehouse, praying to God that The Fart Cloud doesn't follow me. It doesn't, but it screams out that I can't run forever, and it'll be waiting for me. 

"Tom, you're needed to the front registers!" I hear blasting from the intercom. 

I ignore it though, I've got my hands full back here and Tilly can just wait until her actual break to go have a smoke. 

Around 6:30, Dennis asks me what that strange sound is. My heart drops. I ask him what he means, and he tells me it's like a faint hum he can hear coming from the intercom system. *Shit.* I nervously lie and tell him I have no idea what he's talking about. He shrugs and says it must mean it's time for break. 

We aren't supposed to all take break at the same time, but since we're almost done straightening, today we decide to do it anyway. Everyone piles into the break room, and Lenny smiles and says it's a party. He's so honored that we didn't forget his birthday. *Fuck.* We all sing to him, as he blows out the candles on his sardines. He offers us all a piece, but we decline. Except for Dennis. He dips some of the sardines into Lenny's goo and says it's quite delicious. 

After break, we continue with the rest of the straightening. When we make it to aisle 13, The Spill That Never Dries has eaten the entire aisle, along with Blind Richard. His stick was being used by The Spill to pick hair out from its teeth. Poor bastard never saw it coming. Guess he really was blind. At least we don't have to straighten this aisle now, though.

We move on to the coolers and freezers, and they're a total mess. It's gonna take a while to get them all fixed up, so I decide we should all split up. I send Paul over to the freezers, and he scowls at me while muttering something about this time he won't miss the heart. Whatever, dude's got lousy aim, so I'm not worried. Just ask the urinals around here. 

Yogurt Lady was standing by the coolers slathering herself when we arrived. But, as soon as she locked eyes on Emma, she growled and ran away, leaving a slimy trail of yogurt behind her. I tell Dennis to follow me to the janitors closet so I can teach him how to handle a spill. He asked if that was supposed to be Lenny's job, and I just laughed. 

I push Dennis out in front of me and I guide him into the warehouse, thinking that if The Fart Cloud shows back up, I can shove him at it as a sacrifice. The coast is clear, so I take him to the janitors closet. As soon as we enter, I hear a strange sound coming from the corner. I lift up an empty box, and The Turd Slug is there. It's given birth, and nursing a litter of turdlets. I didn't even know the little shit was pregnant. That *does* explain why it's been eating so much lately, though. Dennis is overcome with excitement, and asks if he can have one when they're old enough to be separated from their mother. I tell him sure, then grab the mop and bucket.

While I'm trying to clean up the yogurt, Dennis is hard at work scooping as much of it up as he can with his hands, with the intent to bring it to The Turd Slug. He giggles as it laps the yogurt from his hands, exclaiming, 

"It tickles!"

I make him wash his hands, and we head back to the sales floor. Chris is missing another finger from the hand, but I know that won't stop it from doing what it does best. Emma must've gotten hungry, since the overwhelming stench of Lenny's party in the break room prevented us all from eating at that time. I decide to have a little fun before the night ends, so I throw my box cutter on the ground in front of Chris and ask Dennis if he can pick it up for me. I smile with anticipation as Dennis bends over to get it. The hand reaches for Dennis's bottom and when it gets there, Dennis' body snaps back up instantly. 

"Wow, thanks Chris! That spot's been itching me for days and I can't reach it!"

I roll my eyes. 

Finally, the store is all straight. Most of the products had cooperated with us, and I only was stung once by the scorpions/toilet paper. Tilly's night must have been stressful, too. By the time we get up to the front, she's picked herself clean right down to the bone. I feel bad for not making it up here to help her, but I just had way too much on my plate tonight. 

We all line up at the time clock, exhausted, but proud of how much work we were able to accomplish today. When I punch my numbers in, I'm pleasantly surprised to see that it's given me all of my hours today, along with Dennis'. I smile, and looking down, I notice an envelope with my name on it, sitting on the floor in front of the time clock. I open it, and it's from corporate. They want me to start the management training program next week. Comes with a hefty pay raise too. Gerold and Ruby will be pissed, and I know it means I'll have to sign a contract, but who cares. I'm finally getting the recognition I deserve for all the hard work I do around here. 

When I reach the front doors, I'm horrified to see that The Earlybirds have already begun gathering.  *Jesus Christ.* I grab an umbrella from the display, open it up, and start pushing my way through them; covering my eyes so they can't peck them out. At least I'm off [tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/pKaD3CiJAQ).
