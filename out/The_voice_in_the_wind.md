I was never much of a believer in the supernatural. I never believed in ghosts, or that there were any kind of otherworldly forces out there in the universe. That all changed when I started hearing voices.

It began when I was out in the woods one day, just walking around aimlessly and enjoying the peace and quiet of the forest. I was taking in the sights and the smells of the forest when I heard a faint whisper. At first I thought it must have been the wind, but then I heard it again. This time it was clearer, and it sounded like someone was calling my name.

I looked around, trying to find the source of the voice, but I couldn't see anyone. I started to get a bit scared and I decided to turn back and head home. As I was walking, I heard the whispering again. This time, it was a bit louder, like a voice from the other side of the woods. I stopped and listened, but I still couldn't make out what the voice was saying.

I continued walking, and the voice seemed to follow me. I started to get really scared, and I started to run. I ran as fast as I could, and the voice was still there, following me. I felt like I was being chased, and I was so scared I thought I was going to faint. I kept running until I reached the edge of the woods and I collapsed onto the ground, panting and exhausted.

That's when I heard the voice again, only this time it was much clearer. It spoke in a gentle, soothing tone and said, "It's alright, don't be scared. I'm here to help you."

I was so scared I couldn't move, and I just lay there, trembling. The voice spoke again, and this time, it said, "I know you are scared, but you don't have to be. I am here to help you, and I am here to protect you."

I didn't know what to say, so I just lay there, listening to the voice. It kept talking, and it told me that it was a spirit, sent from the other side to help me. It said it was there to guide me and protect me from harm.

At first I was skeptical, but the more I heard the voice, the more I started to believe it. I started to feel a sense of peace and comfort from the voice, and I knew that it was real.

Since that day, I have been hearing the voice more and more often. It talks to me when I'm alone and it gives me advice and guidance. I know that it is real, and I am so grateful for its help.

I don't know if there are other people out there who have had similar experiences, but I do know that I am not alone. There are otherworldly forces at work, and I am thankful to have been chosen to receive this help and guidance.

I will forever be grateful to the spirit who has been watching over me.
