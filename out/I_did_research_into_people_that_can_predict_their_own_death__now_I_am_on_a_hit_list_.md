These medical reports were, and still are, strictly confidential. I left my work (at a research hospital in the UK, which I will keep anonymous for my own safety) at the beginning of 2024. A number of us were laid off for a variety of egregious reasons that I will not bore the masses with (political mainly), but many of us left the company with a sour taste in our mouths. 

We have a UK branch and a USA branch, with the research facilities in the US being located in Texas, California and Philadelphia. Some of my former colleagues and I have recently gotten word that a few of the Americans that were laid off have begun to disappear in mysterious circumstances. We know the drill. We know the non-disclosure agreements and various contracts we sign to work at my former company are not enough to keep the head office’s minds at rest. They value the confidential information we have access to higher than any of our lives - hence why I am writing this. 

I have instructed my associate to publish this journal upon the event of my untimely death - to expose the industry and the research I was doing. I also instructed him/her to avoid news outlets, as I believe they are likely controlled by the pharmaceutical giant I used to work for as well. Instead, I would like my exposé to be published on social media outlets. Ideally ones not censorable - such as Reddit. Should it come to this, and you are one of the ones curious enough to have began reading - I urge you to share this information with your family and friends. The more people that are aware of what the elites are hiding - the safer you are for knowing it. 

I will not divulge the name of the company I worked for - yet I will say they are a titan in the pharmaceutical industry with close links to governments worldwide. 

I also won’t mention names, as to protect my own family and friends - even if I’ve now become a missing person myself by the time this is published.

First, I’ll clarify a few of the medical and scientific conspiracies that are already floating around the internet. 

**Cancer cures:**

There is a cure for most types of cancer. This includes: breast, lung, bladder, prostate, anal, liver and all skin cancers. Bone cancer and brain cancer still do not have cures, yet there is a chance that has changed even in the few months since I was working in the industry. 

The cure involves a short diet program of natural foods and antioxidants. The therapy consists of high potassium, low sodium diet, with no fats or oils, and minimal animal proteins. Juices of raw fruits and vegetables and of raw liver provide active oxidizing enzymes which facilitate rehabilitation of the liver. Iodine and niacin supplementation is used. Caffeine enemas cause dilation of bile ducts, which facilitates excretion of toxic cancer breakdown products by the liver and dialysis of toxic products from blood across the colonic wall. We found this to have a near 99% success rate in killing all cancer cells. 

This treatment has not been made public due to the amount of money in treatment. The pharmaceutical giants will work alongside governments to keep this information secret - to continue profiting from the disease. 

**Aliens:**

I have no information or knowledge of any alien life existing in space nor on our planet. We have departments that confidentially experiment on materials that are found from space to test whether they have any biological properties that can be used in warfare or medicine, but no actual aliens have ever been discovered to my knowledge. 

**Alzheimer's disease and dementia:**

Similar to cancer, Ahlzeimer's disease and dementia do have a cure and have done for the past 20 years. 

This cure is a mushroom called Lion’s mane. There are properties of this mushroom that build brain cells. In human test subjects, these properties promoted neuron growth when diluted in water, resulting in recovered hippocampal memory.

Most of this has been theorised for years however. One of the scariest, and still unexplained areas we were researching, was in the field of Mortis Oneirology: my speciality. 

**Unknown research:**

Mortis Oneirology comes from the Greek word ‘Oneiro’ which means to dream, and the Latin ‘Mortis’ to mean death. The study, put simply, is that of predicting our own deaths in dreams. 

I still did not manage to finish my research before the lay-offs, so the research field is still wildly unknown and largely speculative. 

The primary idea we were working on in 2022 through to 2024 was using the physics concept of string theory and combining that with neurological research on brain activity during the REM cycle. To put it simply, we live in a 3 dimensional world. We believe our dreams allow us to live in a 4 dimensional world, hence why dreams often make sense when you are in them but become incomprehensible and blurry when we wake up. This is because our 3 dimensional mind is now struggling to comprehend what we experienced in a 4 dimensional world. It’s like having an ant try and understand and empathise with the life of a dog - it is simply not possible for their mind. This information was highly credible due to our findings on brain activity during the REM cycle when asleep, with the brain being far more active (and active in different, previously unused areas) than when awake. We found the average person in deep REM cycle used 40% more of their brain than when they were awake. That when awake the average brain could focus on and play one game of chess at a time, but in deep sleep the average brain would have the equivalent power of focusing on and playing 8 games of chess at a time. 

Where we began to struggle was with the meanings of the dreams when participants awoke. They had clearly experienced something: some waking after a dream feeling happy, some sad, some angry, some scared, some confused and some more enlightened. The exact nature of the dream however could never be accurately examined nor explained coherently in the qualitative research. 

The common pattern we found was on dreams of death. And thus, the Mortis Oneirology department was created in the early 2010s. Over our decade or so of research and filings of dreams done by ourselves and the participants, we found a strong correlation between those who had dreams of their own death and dying in the same manner that they had dreamt. This varied from dreams of falling to death, to dying in a train crash - even as far as one participant who dreamt he would be mauled to death by a bear. All of those are real examples that seemingly manifested their own deaths. Some would happen within the same month, whereas the longest was 9 years later. We recorded 884 dreams of the dreamer dying (over the past 12 years), with 804 of those dreamers now being deceased. Of that 804, we found that a staggering 92% died in a manner that was the same/similar to the way they had dreamt it. We found that reoccurring dreams of the same death increases the chances also. 

The reason for this is still unknown. More research will likely have to be conducted on the 4th dimension to fully understand how this phenomenon occurs - but it does occur. Naturally, a number of governments worldwide are conducting their own research on Mortis Oneirology to see if it could hold military applications. I believe a breakthrough was made, and could be why a number of us were laid off. And why a number of us are now being added to the missing list - daily. 

I hope they don’t come for me, but I feel as if it’s inevitable now. I limit time spent with my family and friends, so that they don’t assume that I’m close with them and kill them too. 

Finally, should you experience the Mortis Oneirology phenomenon yourself - I’m sorry. We have found no cures or prevention techniques thus far, and it seems as if the death can occur at anytime. Good luck to you all, and good night. I hope you don't have trouble sleeping tonight.
