I have a bizarre and macabre story that I am perplexed to write; I have written it and deleted it a couple of times, concerned that it will affect the readers as terribly as it affected me. Even when I am writing, I can't tell what is real and what isn't. I am unable to distinguish reality from fiction.

In the end, I will write it as it happened to me, but I will change some details such as names, locations, and descriptions.

  


It all started with my acquaintance, let's call him John, who happens to be from Arkansas or Kansas, I can't recall. Anyway, I met him at a scientific conference overseas. We talked about a selection of topics, including science, philosophy, cinema, and pseudoscience. He also told me about a psilocybin mushroom compound that he is developing. That has the potential to expand the human brain's capacity beyond its present boundaries.

"John, you realize that we are talking about nonsensical things," I said.

"Ah, the skeptic scientist," And he adds, "What is life if we are not willing to take risks and push the boundaries of the scientific pursuit, right?"

I did not respond to him.

He went on, "How do you know right now that you are not dreaming?"

"I feel, see, and do things," I said.

"Even in your sleep, you feel and do things."

"But it isn't the same," I replied.

"Why is that?"

'When you dream, the things that happen are random," I said, "one second you're in a car, the next you're flying; the dream sequences are chaotic."

"Have you seen The Matrix?"

"Yes"

"When Neo, the protagonist, took the red pill and awakened in his new reality, how do we know he is not still sleeping?"

"We are heading towards philosophy, plus the sleep regression will stop at some point."

"But why?'

"Because it is not sound, the regression will not reach infinity."

"Why wouldn't it go for infinite?"

"It is similar to the Archimedean point, so there will be a point we identify as real or reality"

"Can this reality be real?'

"Now we're discussing semantics," I replied. "Let's say reality as opposed to not real, fiction, or dream, so when you wake up, that's reality."

"According to your conclusion, reality is subjective?"

"It's objective and if we compare it to something else, we will know it is real, just as we can presently tell the difference between the real world and the dream world."

"What about death?"

"What about it?'

"How you know that your alive and not dead?"

"I'm not following"

"How do we know that we are not actually dead and that our minds think we are alive? Don't tell me biological reasons...

I intervened, "Just like ghosts?"

He declared, "Supernatural."

I started laughing, "You know we're supposed to be scientists?"

"Just humor me."

"All right, the difference is that we are living our lives and following our passions." I add sarcastically, "I don't have a PhD in ghost studies, but I think ghosts have no purpose or passion because they are dead."

"You watched or read The Shining?"

"Yeah, I don't think movies or novels are great arguments, but even if they have a purpose, it will be related to the next life, so if someone is dead, he will be biologically dead in our world, but his soul will continue." I went on, "I suppose we need to agree on the definition of "alive." If we take it in the broader sense, then sure, spirits and ghosts are living things, but in the strict sense, it will rely on the biological definition."

"I agree, if my research result is correct, we will be able to cross the fine line of these distinctions"

"You mean there's no distinction between the living and the dead?"

"Exactly, supernatural and natural will be the same."



I didn't say anything, and I don't think he's nuts. I don't think he believed what he was saying; perhaps he needed a friend to talk to or impress. After our long and bizarre conversation, we returned to our own lives, he to the United States and I to my home country. I hadn't seen John in over 5 years, and I lost contact with him three years after our meeting.

  


I suffer from insomnia and severe headaches.

Sometimes medication help, sometimes they don't.



One night in a dream, I saw John dressed as a Native American chieftain; I forgot to mention that he has both European and Native American ancestors. He is from the Blackfoot tribe. He sat in front of a bonfire and looked sad.

"Come sit with me." he said

I sat beside him, looking at the fire, and he told me that he was dead, and he opened a door to the other side, a very terrifying place, and something has entered our world.

"What do you mean?" I asked, " What other place?"

'A place called by the Egyptian as Duat"

"The underworld?"

"Yes"

"Who came from the other side?" I exclaimed.

I saw John trying to say something, but I was unable to hear him because his sound was muffled out by another strong sound of thumping and whirring, like an earthquake, then the bonfire was extinguished and very cold darkness fell over us all, and I awakened from my sleep, sweating and breathing frantically.

And all I can hear now is the construction workers outside using their Hammer drills.

  


My apartment looks hideous and dirty, like a crime scene, yet I don't remember it that way.

I turned on my PC and looked for John on Facebook. After a while, I found him; a family member using his account. John had been dead for ten years. It is absurd; I met him at a conference five years ago; how could I met him if he is dead?



I tried to contact the conference by email, and after giving them my information and everything they required, they responded saying we did not have anyone by that name. I told them that I attended the conference and even gave them the names of some of the attendees. They apologized, "but you are not in our system," they said. I persisted, and they stopped responding.



I also attempted to contact one of John's family members, his sister, through Facebook. I informed her about the conference, and we met there. She stated John was not a scientist. And that he worked at a gas station. That's impossible, I said. I tried to say anything, including his Blackfoot heritage and my dream.

She mentioned that John had blonde hair and blue eyes, and that you should not contact her or any of her family members, She blocked me and called me weirdo!

I noticed their location was in Ohio. What special about Ohio? I thought he was from Arkansas, or whatever.

  


I felt angry and confused, and I told myself I was losing it; I needed to go outside and breathe some fresh air. Or, I will make me some coffee first, I went to the kitchen and pressed the switch and the light didn't turn on, then I pressed the other switch and there was no light, and I found myself in my bed, sleeping.



I woke up and went to the switch to open the light; when I pressed it again, with no response, I found myself back in my bed.

I opened my eyes and woke for the second time from my cursed slumber, and I began to panic. I jumped from my bed again and quickly, rushed to the wicked kitchen, pressed the switch, and found myself back in my own bed.

  


I never went to the kitchen because I feared I would get stuck in a dream loop. But instead, I went to the computer to write about my predicament, and I'm still not sure if I'm sleeping or dreaming an endless dream. I don't know if John, whether the conference or this story are real or not. And I don't know if I wake up again or press the kitchen switch, the story or I will cease to exist, like my conversation with John. If you read this, my or our story, it will only be a part of your imagination, and when you wake up, it may no longer exist.
