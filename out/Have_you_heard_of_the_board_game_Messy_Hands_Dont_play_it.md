“I brought a new game.”

The four of us crowded around the folding table in a dingy basement. Somehow, Nadia, Rupert, Tod, and I had managed to stay friends past our college days. Even though we were all graduated, working professionals with mortgages (and some of us children), every Tuesday night, we still crammed together in the basement of Nadia’s childhood home to play board games.

When our fifth member, Paul, was here, we’d continue our D&D campaign, but he was gone more and more on business trips. 

Tod pulled the lid off the board game.

“What is it?” I asked

“No idea,” Tod said. “That’s part of the fun. Found it at the back of my parents’ game closet.”

“Which means we have to take half an hour to figure out the rules.” Nadia snorted.

“It doesn’t look so bad,” Tod said. Already, he was taking the board out, unfolding it, and centering it on the table. He placed four tokens, one for each of us, on the starting line and a stack of cards in the center.

“It doesn’t,” I agreed. “Jeez, when is this game from? It’s so faded.”

“*Messy Hands,*” Rupert read from the lid of the box. “It looks like some simplified version of Life. We sure we don't want to play Catan?”

“It will be fun,” Tod insisted, an edge of annoyance in his tone. Not surprising. The four of us (five, including Paul) had been friends for years. We were masters at forgiving each other by now, which also meant we were masters at getting on each other’s nerves. Fights were common, but we always resolved them.

“Let’s give it a chance,” I said before a fight could break out.

Tod spent less than a minute scanning the rules. “Ok, pretty simple. We just take turns flipping over a card and doing what they say on the back. Nadia, ladies first.”

She shrugged, and nabbed a card. She read it, then set it on the table where we could all read it.

**DO A JUMPING JACK TO ADVANCE ONE SPACE.**

“Um, okay.” She giggled. “So it’s like some lame version of truth or dare?”

“You gotta do it,” I said.

She did and moved her token forward once.

I flipped over a card next.

**LICK YOUR NEIGHBOR’S HAND TO ADVANCE TWO SPACES.**

“Two spaces?” Nadia said. “Not fair.” Her tone was uncaring though.

None of us seemed to care much about this kid’s game. We were doing it to apprase Tod, though even he was looking skeptical now. No harm in playing along to make him less embarrassed, though, so I dropped my face dramatically, and touched my tongue to Rupert’s hand.

“Disgusting!” He laughed. I pushed my token one past Nadia’s.

Rupert was next.

**TELL A SECRET TO ADVANCE TWO SPACES. DRAW AGAIN.**

“Uh oh,” he said. “You’re right, this is like truth or dare.”

“You’re stalling,” Tod said.

He rolled his eyes. “Fine. You know how I said your new haircut looks good? Yeah, well it’s all uneven in the back.” He flipped another card.

**TELL A BIGGER SECRET TO ADVANCE ONE MORE SPACE. DRAW AGAIN.**

“What the…”  Rupert looked at Tod. “Did you set this up?”

Tod shrugged. It was odd, to get those cards one after another―then again, we hadn't  actually shuffled them. They'd probably come like that.

“Um, well, okay, ” Rupert said. “Let’s see. In high school, I was in the same Lit class my brother took two years before. He’d  given me his old computer with all his old files, so I would just turn in his same essays for homework.”

Nadia *oohs,* and we all laugh. It sounded like something Rupert would have done; he’s always been the most *amoral* of us, to say the least. He flips his third card.

**TELL YOUR BIGGEST SECRET TO ADVANCE ONE.**

Again, Rupert looked up at Tod. “Ok, not funny anymore.”

“I swear I didn’t put that there.”

“Ok well, I’m done. You take your turn.”

Tod reached for his card, but his hand jerked back. “It shocked me!”

“What?” Rupert asked.

“I’m serious, the cards shocked me.”

“That’s ridicul―” Nadia started, but her hand jerked back too when she touched them.

Rupert touched one.  Nothing happened. “You guys are hilarious.”

Curious, I tapped the pile next, with the very edge of my pinky. Intense electricity shot up my arm, into my shoulder, and down my legs. I sprang back, my chair nearly tipping.

We all looked at each other. Nobody was smiling anymore. We were all looking at each other. 

“It isn’t our turn,” I said.

Hesitantly, Rupert flipped the next card.

**TELL YOUR BIGGEST SECRET.**

“I’m out.” Red-faced, he snatched his coat from the back of the chair and stormed for the basement door. When he got there, he swore. “What is this!”

We rushed over. He was straining against the clearly-locked basement door. Why was he so angry?

“I’m sick of this game!” he screamed, and before any of us could react, he kicked at the flimsy basement door, splintering it. He threw the door open―

To reveal a wall. 

The one way out was entirely sealed, as if it had been that way for years.  We all stared.

“I swear I don’t know what’s going on,” Tod said.

Rupert stormed past us to the window. He climbed on a chair and shoved it open, but even from my spot, I could see the window was walled in too. We spent minutes exploring the basement for a way out, but it was entirely, unexplainably sealed off. None of our cell phones worked either.

“*Messy Hands,*” Nadia whispered finally. “I think― I think we have to finish the game before it lets us out.”

“I’m not doing that,” Rupert insisted.

“Why not?” asked Tod. “Come on, I don’t want to be trapped in here, just because you can’t tell us a dumb secret.”

“Yeah, why?” I asked. “What’s the secret?”

*What,* we all asked, over and over, *What couldn’t he tell us?* 

Finally, Rupert exploded. “I’m cheating on Rachel! Okay? Happy!”

We all gawked. Rachel was his wife of five years. They had a kid together. We liked Rachel.

Rupert was already trying at the basement door again, but the wall was still there, solid as before.

We had to keep playing.

Tod went next, trembling.

**POINT AT YOUR LEAST FAVORITE FRIEND TO ADVANCE TWO.**

“Everybody close your eyes,” he instructed us. We did. 

“Okay,” he said after a few seconds, and moved his piece forwards. 

Even if we hadn't seen who he’d pointed at, it surprised me how quickly he’d chosen.

Nadia was next.

**DO ANOTHER JUMPING JACK TO ADVANCE ONE.**

Not all of them were bad, not nearly as bad as Rupert’s first turn. We went one by one, doing whatever things the game said. From then on if we had to confess something distasteful, the rest of us would follow Tod’s example and plug our ears. For one turn I had to strip completely down, but the others all closed their eyes until I was dressed again.

Slowly, the cards got worse. There were still the occasional freebies (for some reason jumping jacks kept popping up for Nadia), but overall the tasks became less harmless.

**CUT SIX INCHES FROM YOUR HAIR TO ADVANCE ONE.**

Nadia teared up. Her hair wasn’t long to begin with. Six inches would make it practically a pixie cut. She took nearly an hour to work up the nerve. She tried screaming at the sealed up door and failed over and over to connect to the non-existent Wi-Fi. We didn’t coerce her, but eventually, she grabbed a pair of scissors, in tears, and seared off most of her hair.

It was nearly 8am now. Our families would be wondering where we were.

My turn.

**DRAW BLOOD TO ADVANCE ONE. DRAW AGAIN.**

The ‘Draw Agains’ were never a good sign.

I used a boxcutter to poke at my finger until a line of red appeared.

**DRAW MORE TO ADVANCE ONE. DRAW AGAIN.**

“Wonderful.”

Just great. I used the box cutter on my thigh this time. When I tried to pick up another card, though, it shocked me. I cut again, until blood was dripping onto my socks.

**DRAW MORE TO ADVANCE ONE. FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.**

“At least there’s not another draw again,” I said.

“Do me,” Rupert volunteered. He’d been pretty silent since his first turn. I knelt down to his leg.

“Wait,” said Nadia. “Head wounds bleed the most for the shallowest cuts.”

“Sorry,” I told him. It took nearly three slices along the top of his scalp before the game determined it was enough.

We were close now. My token was the farthest, on the very last space before the finish box. The others were all only a space or two behind that.

Rupert’s turn.

**TEXT YOUR WIFE YOU WANT A DIVORCE TO ADVANCE ONE.**

“But our phones don’t even―” Rupert stopped short as his phone pinged. Text after text flooded in. He tried calling, but that wouldn’t work. He tried messaging people, but nothing went through despite the full bars.

Of course, it wouldn't work. We’d accepted that by now.  We were playing by the games’ rules now. The only thing his phone would work for was texting one person one message.

Rupert pressed send, and his reception bars disappeared. He was crying now too, but at least he was with me on the board, the last space before the finish.

Tod’s turn.

**BREAK YOUR HAND TO ADVANCE ONE. DRAW AGAIN.**

This task took him nearly half an hour. We considered just having one of us do it break his hands for him, but of course, what if that didn’t work? What if it had to be him, and then he had to break both his hands, because we’d done it wrong?

Instead, Tod punched the wall in the doorway until he was screaming in pain. To his credit, he never cried.

**BREAK SOMEBODY ELSE’S HAND TO ADVANCE TWO.**

“Do me,” I said. “Rupert already got all cut up.”

“What about me?” Nadia asked. “Is this because I’m a girl?”

“How about we put off the gender equality conversation for another time, alright?”

I looked away as Tod, still trembling from his own hand, slammed the hammer against my backhand.

As it happens, I did cry.

“I can’t do it,” Nadia said in her turn. 

“We’re all almost done,” Rupert said. “You’re the only one with two spots left, and those two need to get to a hospital. We can’t take long turns anymore. Please, just go.” I knew he was thinking of his wife. She’d be awake by now with his text on her screen and him gone all night. He had to be desperate to explain.

Nadia flipped her card.

**POINT AT SOMEBODY TO ADVANCE TWO.**

That was it. No *cut off your limb* or *bite out your tongue.* Just point at somebody…

It was too easy. So far the game had been straightforward with us, but two spaces meant Nadia would win. Be done. Something was up. I was just about to say all this, when she shrugged and pointed at Rupert.

His head exploded.

My ears rang.  My mouth. The taste of him was in my gaping mouth. This couldn’t be real. Rupert couldn’t actually be… He wasn’t…

Down on the board his token had disintegrated. Just like that, a point and a snap, Rupert was gone. His child had no father.

“Finish it!” Nadia sobbed at me. “Please!” 

Tod was too in shock to move.

I flipped my last card.

**POINT AT SOMEBODY TO ADVANCE ONE.**

I’d known it was coming. After Nadia’s turn I’d just known the game would force me to make this decision, especially now we knew what the pointing meant. If it could make noise, it would be laughing.

“Choose me,” Nadia begged. “I can't do it anymore!”

“It just says *somebody*,” I said. “I’m somebody. I can choose myself.”

“Please! Look at what I did to Rupert. I can’t keep going after this.”

Even so, I readied my good hand to point at my own face. This ended now. I took one last look at my oldest friends, at Nadia bawling but kind as ever, at Tod pale-faced and guilty. 

“It’s my fault,” he whispered. “All my fault.”

And you know what? 

He was right. This *was* his fault for demanding we play this terrible board game.
