A lot happened during my prison years.

Some things were scary.

Some were terrifying.

But this one — I will never forget.

For a moment, I truly believed death had come for me.

This happened in a Siberian labor camp. I had a long sentence, time to kill, and like many others, I spent my days at the card table. Games lasted for days. Sometimes longer.

During one ten-day stretch, everything went wrong from the start.

The cards turned their backs on me. I couldn’t win a single hand. I barely even touched the deck. No pots. Nothing.

The worst part was that I missed the moment when it was still smart to walk away. Normally, I would leave, come back the next day, and recover my losses. This time, I stayed.

I told myself: I’m not leaving until I break even.

That decision cost me two more days of nerves and exhaustion.

I finally crawled back to zero. The moment my name appeared in the ledger with a plus sign, I stood up and left the table.

Back in the barracks, I collapsed onto my bunk. I expected sleep to take me instantly.

It didn’t.

I turned. I counted breaths. I shut my eyes and tried not to see cards and winning combinations flashing behind my eyelids.

Sleep wouldn’t come.

I got up, walked through the barracks, hoping to find someone else awake. Someone to talk nonsense with until morning inspection. Everyone slept, except one guy listening to music with his headphones on.

Going back to the cards would have been stupid. You don’t play when you’re that tired.

So I lay back down.

I stopped thinking. Or tried to.

My thoughts still came, but I pushed them away before they could settle.

Then my body went stiff.

It didn’t scare me at first. I thought sleep was finally arriving.

Then came a ringing in my head.

Still, I wasn’t afraid. I was curious.

And then the real horror began.

A light appeared before my eyes.

Not a glow — a small, round opening.

It was calling me.

I knew I wasn’t asleep.

I also knew I couldn’t move.

My body was completely paralyzed.

The ringing grew louder as I felt myself moving toward the light. My body stayed behind, somewhere on the bunk.

The sound became a roar, like a train passing inches away. The closer I got, the less I felt my body — and the greater the fear became. A fear I had never known before.

I snapped back into my frozen body and tried again.

Each time, panic threw me back.

Part of me knew I had to push through.

Now or never.

But the closer I got, the stronger the terror became — until it was unbearable.

After that, I started calling every psychic, magician, and mystic I could find in old newspapers. I quit gambling completely. I needed to know what had happened to me.

No one gave a clear answer.

One warned me about a “silver cord” snapping.

Another said I wasn’t ready for the crossing.

A third spoke in nonsense until I realized he was just a fraud and hung up.

Over time, something became clear.

By accident, I had found a door.

A door into another world — unknown and frightening.

I believed that if I opened it fully, something final awaited on the other side.

Soon after, things got worse in real life. New administrators came in. Order turned into chaos. Punishments were harsh. The system tightened.

I was transferred. Then punished. Isolation cells. Court again. Another prison. Another camp. Years passed.

Sometimes I lost interest in everything.

But I always remembered that door.

And every so often, with fear and trembling, I would approach it again — trying to open it just a little wider.
