I know a lot of people (especially people on this subreddit), have nightmares.

Probably really cinematic nightmares.

But I have a strange one for you that I figured I'd share.

For a long, long time, my wife and I were in a Polycule with a woman who we thought we'd be with forever.

The only reason I thought to catalogue this in such detail was because our girlfriend made it seem important.

So here we go.

This happened while we were staying in a motel in Houston, we'd just been to pride and we got to see a few officers abusing their power, knocking a good few people down who were simply participating, we were rightly more than a bit pissed about it but I was moreso because my wife wouldn't let me help, because she was worried I'd get arrested too.

Anyway, we got to the motel, ordered some takeout, ate dinner and fell asleep.

I woke up to a horrific scene.

I was sitting at the bottom of a candle lit concrete chamber, looking up into the large expanse above me, I could see these small platforms, circling the main shaft of whatever chamber I found myself in, on these platforms were hundreds of dried, dessicated corpses, reaching upwards with mummified hands, fixed looks of fear and terror on their faces.  All dead.

After I had my fill of this sight, I looked down, in front of me, and saw I was sitting at a desk, in front of me, across the desk, was a familiar face, however I couldn't place where I knew him from, what really  bothered me the most about the situation was that this familiar face was wearing a world war 2 german uniform gloves and all, but without the armband. 

We were having a discussion about the US national debt, about the problem really being the people in charge, the hyper rich and the corporate hellscape they created, leaving the rest of mankind to fumble in their wake, about how those in power care for nothing but the bottom line.

 I voiced my agreement, saying something should be done, but then saying, "But who would do it?" After this I saw the man, this nondescript, slightly familiar man, crack a smile as his skin dessicated, his eyes became flaming orbs of orange fire as he reached out a hand to me, as if to clasp my own.

Then he asked me the question, "What would you do, if I gave you the power to burn it all down?"

The question seemed to hang in the air as I contemplated the gloved hand and the glowing eyes of my new friend, a growing terror, and an elation growing in me, anticipation gnawing at me as the flushing of my face and the adrenal prickle on my scalp threatened to wake me, but instead of answering him, I asked a question, "What about the people?"

The question was innocent enough, I was always concerned that a drastic solution  was never the right one, but that didn't change the fact that I actually kind of agreed with what I believed he was proposing.

Mid musing however, the noise, what I had understood as him breathing, suddenly stopped, the orange fire in his eyes dimmed a bit and his hand dropped to the desk, and suddenly I couldn't breathe, as if all the air in the chamber had been sucked out, the candles began to extinguish as the fire died in the man's eyes, 

Before I passed out in the nightmare, his parting words as I faded into darkness were, "Think on it." And I woke up in a cold sweat.

I checked all over for info about the motel we'd been at, nothing remotely supernatural or interesting.

Those words have been dancing round my head ever since, even long after the end of our polycule.

I can't get the idea I felt, the nonverbal proposal of a total reset, a way for us as a species to start from scratch.

The messed up thing is, the way things are going now, if he asked me right now, I might agree to it...
