Yes, I know how it may sound, but I’m moving back to the house where I lived through my worst memories. The first week was weird to say the least. It didn’t bring up any past trauma; it was just hard to orient myself at first. 



The last time I lived here, I was still a child, and the house looked very different. Since then, my grandparents refurnished it, built a patio, and changed the wallpaper.



At first, my grandmother would call every day and ask if I was doing okay. Grandpa came by the first few weekends. He said that it was because he had to check something with the water and septic tank in the basement. 



I tried asking him what needed to be checked, but he insisted it was too much work and required a lot of experience to get done. He would usually finish in less than 10 minutes. After a while, I let it go and let him play around in the basement.



I used to live at this house with my mom. My father left us when I was a little child, which devastated her. For some time, we lived with our grandparents until my mother decided to divorce my dad and got a hefty sum of money from the divorce settlement. 



Apparently, my father had a large sum stashed in an account he didn’t tell anyone about. My mom decided to buy this house in a town not too far away from my grandparents. She had recently gotten a job there as a secretary at a small accounting firm. 



For a while, it was the happiest time of my childhood. My mom was her old self again and even dated a man named Dave. She seemed happy. But one day, they abruptly broke up. I tried asking her what happened, but she would not give me a reason.



After the breakup, I noticed something was going on with her. It first happened on a quiet Sunday afternoon. I woke up early in the morning, got out of bed, and started making my way towards the bathroom. 



I left my room, and there I saw her, my mother, standing next to the wall, her ear to it, silently whispering back and forth, like she was having a conversation with someone on the other end. 



I stood there frozen for a few seconds, wondering what was going on. I said “Mom?” and she quickly turned around, her face pale, her pupils dilated with black bags under her eyes like she hadn’t slept for a week. 



“Oh, nothing, sweetheart. I just thought I heard rats, so mommy had to make sure,” she said and flashed a grin that I will never forget. It made her look like a terrifying caricature. She quickly realized she was scaring me, patted my head, and told me to do my morning duties. I stayed in the bathroom for about 45 minutes, sitting on the floor, holding onto my legs, crying. 



When I finally got the courage to walk out, she was downstairs cooking breakfast. She called out to me, and I slowly walked down into the kitchen. I tried to glance at her quickly. She now seemed normal again, looking exactly like my mom. Almost like the thing I saw upstairs was not her, but some ghost.



For the next few months, I didn’t want to leave my room early in the morning. I was scared that I would see her there again, talking to the wall with that terrifying look in her eyes. Around this time, the accounting firm decided to let her go. I don’t know the exact reason. She said her old work friends started conspiring against her to get her fired. 



My mom wasn’t too moved by the firing. It almost seemed like she was excited about it. We still had money from my dad, so she didn’t try to get another job and decided that we would live off of his savings for a while. I remember my grandparents were not happy with her decision and fought with her over it, which angered my mom. 



We stopped visiting them as often, and they stopped coming over. I loved my grandparents, so this made me really unhappy, but whenever I tried to talk to my mom about it, she would say that they hate her now and there’s no reason to see them. No matter how hard I tried and argued with her, she would have her way.



One night, I woke up and heard my mom talking to somebody. At this point, I had forgotten about the wall incident, so my initial thought was that someone was trying to rob us, but after a few minutes, I realized I could only hear my mom's voice. 



She would say something, then there would be a pause, and she would speak again, almost as if replying to the silence. I didn’t dare to go and see what was actually happening, so I lay in my bed for what felt like hours until my mom finally stopped talking. 



The next morning, I asked her what was going on. She stopped for a second, looked at me strangely, and said that she was talking to somebody on the phone and not to worry. It seemed strange because my mom would always leave her phone in the kitchen, but not wanting to freak myself out, I accepted her reasoning.



These nightly conversations became a routine. Almost every night, I would wake up at 3 am to hear my mom talking to someone. Most of the time, they seemed like normal conversations, but sometimes she would argue and shout. Other times, she would start crying or laughing with joy. 



I’m not sure if my mom slept on any of those nights. Often, I would come home from school to her still asleep in her bedroom. I could mostly take care of myself, and my mom would occasionally get groceries on some nights, so there was enough food. I was tired and would fall asleep in my classes. 



The teachers would ask what was going on and if everything was okay at home. I didn’t want to tell the truth to anyone, so I’d usually say our neighbors were really loud and it kept me up at night. Luckily, before the teachers got too suspicious, my mom's nightly talks abruptly stopped, and I could sleep again.



It took me a while to figure out what was happening. At first, I was glad that it stopped, but strangely, even though I could not hear my mom talking at night, she would still be sleeping for most of the day. One night, I drank too much chocolate milk before sleep and woke up needing to use the bathroom. 



The one we had upstairs had some issues that day, so I decided to use the downstairs one. In my half-asleep state, I made my way to the first floor. The bathroom was right next to the basement door. I quickly walked in and finished my deed, but as I was about to flush, I could hear some strange noise. 



I stopped for a second. It was my mom again having another one of her conversations. My heart almost jumped out of my chest. It was coming up from the basement. The tone of her voice seemed scared, and it sounded like she was pleading with someone. 



I quickly got out and ran upstairs into my room, hoping she didn’t notice I was up. I lay in my bed shivering, but luckily, she didn’t come back up until the sun rose. 



One day, I came home from school. My mom was asleep in her room. I made myself a sandwich and sat at the kitchen table. The table was right across from the basement door. A strange feeling of curiosity overtook me. The scare I had a few nights ago was still recent in my memory, but I wanted to know what my mom was doing there. 



I laid my sandwich on the kitchen table and made my way towards the basement door. There were no windows, so to see one had to walk all the way to the back and flip a switch. I made my way to the switch and flipped it on. My stomach dropped.



All over the walls were different words and dates written in a dark red Sharpie. Most of them read “it’s coming” and then my name. The dates were set for a day a month away from then. I gasped and ran up the stairs, back to the kitchen. 



My mom had just woken up and came downstairs, still yawning, she asked me about my day at school. I could barely make a word out, and my voice was trembling. She noticed something was wrong, but I said that some teachers were being mean to me that day.



Each day, she seemed more withdrawn, barely talking to me or asking questions about my school. She didn’t try to hide her going to the basement anymore. Her conversations had gotten more energetic. I could sometimes hear her talk all the way into the living room. It was hard to make out what she was saying. 



Often, it sounded like she wasn’t saying words and was only making noises. Most of them seemed joyful; she would laugh like a drunk person, almost like a wolf howling at the moon. I would come closer to the door, trying to make up what she was saying, but with no luck. I was sure she was talking to someone, but I couldn’t understand what she said. 



I didn’t try to venture back down again, even when Mom was asleep. After what I saw last time, I was too scared to do so. 



The days passed, and slowly, the date written all over the basement walls approached. I was getting more freaked out each day. The conversations in the basement were louder. My mom was practically screaming at some points, and the laughter made my skin crawl. I knew I had to do something. Some horrible thing would happen on that day. 



I tried to get into my mom's phone to call my grandparents, but she had a password on it, which I didn’t know. I thought of taking the kitchen knives upstairs with me. The last thing I wanted was to hurt my mom, but I didn’t know what else to do. Unfortunately, she took them all away. I had no idea when she did that or where she put them. 



I resorted to a rock that was in our back garden, which I stuffed under my pillow. I thought this might be a perfect weapon. It will definitely not kill her, but maybe knock her out enough so I can go out and call for help. 



Then it came. The day I dreaded so much. Christmas break had started a day ago, a time that almost every child loves. No school and Christmas with gifts are around the corner, but I knew something else was awaiting me. 



My mom didn’t get a Christmas tree, and she rarely left the house anymore, so the chance of an actual Christmas happening was close to none, but the writing on the basement wall told me that a different kind of surprise was coming. 



That day was the same as any other. My mom went to sleep around 8 am as I was waking up. I made myself breakfast and then just waited. That’s what I did all day, sat around and waited. I couldn’t even read a comic book or play with my toys. 



The only thing on my mind was the moment my mom woke up. As the usual 4 pm approached, I went upstairs into my room. I changed into my pajamas and sat under the blanket, clutching onto the rock I found a few days ago. 



My mom woke up exactly at 4. She went into the bathroom and then climbed down the stairs, calling my name. I knew something was wrong because she rarely talked to me anymore. Why would she be calling my name now? I didn’t answer. 



I could hear her walking around the downstairs area, trying to look for me. Then she went out into the back garden and called for me again. After some time, she returned to the house, and I could hear her approaching my bedroom door. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it was going to jump out of my chest.



She knocked on my bedroom door and called my name again. I didn’t answer. She called out again. My voice was trembling. I managed to make out a silent “yes?”. 



“Oh, what’s going on with you, honey? Are you sick? Why are you in your bedroom? It’s only 4 pm.” Her voice sounded sweet again. First time I heard her talk like that in months.



“Yeah, I’m not feeling too well, Mom. I’m probably just going to stay in my room for the day.” I replied while fake coughing.



“Oh, sweetie, let me take a look at you.” She said and walked into the room. She had the same terrifying look she had when I saw her talking to a wall. Her hair was all messed up, and her nightgown was dirty from the basement dust, something I didn’t notice until she was standing so close to my bed. 



Her face had a look of horror and joy. Her pupils were dilated, and her eyes were wide open. She had this grin on that I will never forget. She looked almost inhumane. I lay frozen in my bed, staring at her. She came closer and put her hand on my forehead.



“You don’t seem to have a fever. Are you alright to get out of bed? I have something to show you.”



“No, mom, I think I’m too sick,” I said, trying to sound ill.



“Sweetie, it will only take a second. Come on out.” She took the covers off me. I saw her looking at the rock in my hand.



“Oh, what are you doing with a rock in here?” She asked and wrestled the rock out of my clenched fist. She was so quick, I didn’t have time to react.



“Okay, let’s go, sweetie.” She said and dragged me out of bed by my hand. I tried to fight her hand off and grab onto things around my room, but she felt so strong. I can’t remember her feeling so strong, even when I was a little boy. Finally, I screamed out, “No, mom, please stop, I don’t want to go into the basement.”



“Come on, sweetie, it will be so fun.” She kept repeating this phrase as she was dragging me down. I tried to grab onto anything. All the rails on the steps, the corners of the walls, even the rug on the downstairs floor. 



I could feel my fingernails ripping, but adrenaline was flowing through my body, so I didn’t feel the pain. None of my efforts helped; she still managed to take me down with ease. 



We were standing in front of the basement door. At this point, I was screaming at her, begging her to stop, let me go. She kept repeating the same phrase, “Come on, sweetie, it will be so fun.”. 



She opened up the basement door and dragged me down into the basement. It was dark at first, so I could not make out what was there. I only remember banging my arm on what felt like a wooden table.



She turned on the light, and then I saw it. The walls were covered with red writing, the same as before. There was a wooden table in the center of the room with restraints on the sides to hold a human. I screamed immediately when I saw it.



“I’m sorry we have to do it this way, honey, but it’s the only way you’ve gotta trust me. You have to wait. I’m sure they’ll show themselves to you. We’re the chosen ones, honey.” She said with joy.



“What do you mean, Mom. Make this all stop, please!” I screamed out.



“You have to trust me. Wait, and they will show themselves to you, and you will understand.”



She picked me off the ground and laid me down on the table. I tried to struggle against her grip again, but to no avail. She was too strong. No matter how hard I tried to snake my way out of her hands, she would not let go. 



Then she turned around and started digging for something under the wooden stairs. When she came back, she was holding a huge knife in one of her hands. I screamed out and started crying, begging her not to do it. I might have wet my pants at this point, too. She told me to stop worrying and started caressing my hair. 



“The beings will show themselves to you soon, and you will finally understand, honey. I know I’ve been distant and didn’t take good care of you. I’m sure I creeped you out with my trips to the basement, where it seemed like I was just talking to myself. I knew you were listening, so I had to hide my speech.” 



“They told me you couldn’t know until the day of reckoning. I wanted to tell you so much. I wanted you to be a part of this because I knew you would understand, but they gave me no other choice. This is our only chance to live in paradise forever happy, you and I, my love.”



“Please show yourselves to him, make his journey to paradise easier. He’s just a little boy; he doesn’t understand. Please make this easy on him.” My mom begged into the air. 



The awful look on her face was gone now. She looked like my mom again. The woman I loved all my childhood. Although my head was spinning around at this point, I could tell there was genuine compassion and care in her voice.



I almost passed out, but then I heard it. This small sound. It was barely noticeable. I looked around the room to see where it was coming from, but wherever I moved my head, the voice moved with it, almost like a fly following my movements around. 



What started as a faint whisper slowly turned into an audible sound. I’m not sure if I could call it an actual voice. The thing I can say for certain is that it sounded like heaven, almost like an angel spoke to me. My brain processed all the information it was trying to convey and played it like a movie in front of my eyes. 



Now I finally understand what my mom meant. I could see and hear the pictures and sounds of paradise. It’s hard to describe it with words. The Bible has come closest to describing this place, but its beauty wasn’t fully portrayed. Seeing the place on its own made me shiver in excitement like a person high on drugs. 



It made sense to me now why my mom spent all the time in the basement. If this were only the image, what did the actual place feel like? I couldn’t wait to go to the other side. At this point, I was still crying, but now it was tears of happiness and joy.



“Please, Mom, take us over. I can’t wait!” I screamed out.



I could hear my mom dropping to her knees, and she started crying too. She hugged my leg while holding the knife.



“I knew you would understand. I knew you would!” She kept repeating while crying.



“The beings are gonna help us not feel any pain, my love. It will be a smooth transition. Let me help you on our way to paradise.” 



She unbuckled the holsters. She knew what I saw now and that I would not resist. If I were left on my own in that room, I would have plunged the knife into my heart myself. I couldn’t wait to reach the other side, but then, in my dream-like state, I heard some loud bangs, and then my mother screamed. 



When I opened my eyes, two policemen were holding her down on the ground while she tried to thrash her body like a fish out of water. I got off the table and started beating one of them, but their colleague quickly ran down and held me in my place. 



The only thing I remember from that night was the ambulance medics telling me everything was going to be okay while I cried on the way to the hospital, screaming that I should have been in paradise.



My mom never stopped talking about paradise. They tried everything to change her mind, but nothing worked.



My grandparents would visit her from time to time. She seemed completely normal. The only problem was that the conversation would always end up with her rambling about the beings, what they showed to her, and how she wished to take us all up there. 



It took years for the people at the facility to decide I was ready to leave. I learned what they wanted to hear and stopped mentioning what I saw that night.



Now you can understand why they were so cautious about letting me live at our old house, but I convinced them it was the final step to move on.



A few days ago, I finally went down to the basement. The air was colder than it should’ve been. On the wall, faint red letters had appeared. 



I heard the subtle whisper again that I had heard on that fateful night. Soft, patient, and beautiful. 



This time, I whispered back.
