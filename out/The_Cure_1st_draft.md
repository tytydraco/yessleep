The world has gone mad, but for you, it's just another day. As the pandemic hits, it seems like everyone is losing their minds—stockpiling toilet paper, freaking out over lockdowns, and obsessing over the latest death tolls. But not you. You're used to working from home, alone, with no one to bother you. The isolation doesn’t feel any different from your usual routine.

Of course, the conspiracy theorists crawl out of the woodwork, as they always do when something big happens. You've seen their posts all over the internet—wild claims about how the virus is engineered by the government, about how it's all part of some sinister plan to control the population. You laugh and scroll past, shaking your head at their paranoia. Let them believe what they want. It’s not your problem.

The deaths keep climbing, and the news is relentless—grim updates, day after day, each worse than the last. But then, finally, some good news: a vaccine. Not just any vaccine, but a cure, they say. It will alter your DNA, make you immune to the virus for life. The conspiracy nuts are back at it again, screaming from their corners of the internet that it’s dangerous, that it will do more harm than good. “Don’t take it!” they warn. “It’s all part of the plan!” You ignore them, as usual. The last thing you need is to get sick because you listened to a bunch of lunatics.

So, you get the shot. It’s simple, quick, and barely hurts at all. The nurse tells you to expect some flu-like symptoms, maybe a bit of fatigue, but nothing serious. You thank her, go home, and take some aspirin just in case. Then you crawl into bed, ready to sleep off whatever is coming.

When you wake up, it feels like you’ve been hit by a truck. Your head pounds, your body aches, and your throat is on fire. You try to shake it off—just the vaccine doing its job, you tell yourself. It will pass. You drag yourself to your phone, scrolling through the news to distract yourself from the pain. The world seems even more chaotic than before—cities burning, riots breaking out, stories of parents losing their minds and harming their own children. And the conspiracy theorists? They’re ranting about body snatchers now, claiming the vaccine is some kind of trap. You roll your eyes and toss the phone aside. It’s all too much.

The days blur together in a haze of fever and pain. You lose track of time, drifting in and out of sleep, downing over-the-counter meds like candy, trying to drown out the madness with endless scrolling. Eventually, the fever breaks. You wake up, weak but relieved to feel something like normal again. Just a persistent sniffle and a mild cough—nothing to worry about. You’re over the worst of it.

Now that you're over it, your stomach reminds you that you haven't eaten much lately. You haven’t gone to the store either, and supplies are low. You resolve to make use of your new VaxPass that allows you to go out in public again. Lol, those anti-vax suckers still aren’t allowed out. "Serves 'em right," you mutter to yourself, still ruminating on it in the cereal aisle at the local market. You're surprised to see so many people out already. They all silently shuffle along the aisles, staring ahead. "They look like worker drones," your mind smirks as you notice their peculiar behavior. They're probably still recovering from the virus, and you shouldn’t judge. After all, they have the pass just like you; they aren’t the problem.

As you get back to your routine, the cough grows worse. It’s not just a tickle anymore; it’s like something is stuck deep in your chest, something thick and slimy that won’t come up no matter how hard you cough. The more you try to clear it, the worse it gets. Suddenly, your chest heaves, and a deep, gut-wrenching coughing fit almost floors you. Your throat burns like you’ve swallowed bleach. You can feel a thick mucus lodged in your throat that seems to be emitting a chemical burn. "WTF is happening?" you think.

Panic starts to creep in. You try everything—gargling with saltwater, drinking scalding hot coffee, even shoving your fingers down your throat, trying to dislodge whatever is choking you. But nothing works. The pain intensifies, the feeling of something alive inside you growing stronger with each passing moment.

And then, finally, you feel it. Something shifts in your throat, a slimy mass moving up, inch by inch. Gagging, you stumble to the bathroom mirror, forcing yourself to look. There, just behind your tonsils, you see it—a sickly, translucent mass, glistening wetly in the dim light. Your hands shake as you reach into your mouth, fingers closing around the slick, slimy thing. It’s warm, pulsating slightly as if it has a life of its own.

You pull. The thing stretches, a thick rope of mucus and something else, something wrong. It slides up from deep inside you, scraping against your throat, making you gag and retch as you yank it out. The sensation is horrific, like you’re pulling yourself inside out, your insides unraveling with each tug. The rope keeps coming, longer and longer, like one of those magician’s handkerchiefs that never end.

You pull harder, desperation clawing at your mind as the pain becomes unbearable. And then, with one final, agonizing yank, you feel something tear inside you. There’s a sickening pop, and the world goes black.

When you open your eyes, you’re not standing anymore. You’re lying on the cold bathroom floor, staring up at your own face. But something is wrong. Your perspective is all wrong. You can’t move, can’t feel anything except the cold, hard tile beneath you. You try to scream, but nothing happens. You can only watch as your body—no, the thing inside your body—stands over you, calmly picking up a mop.

The last thing you see before the darkness swallows you whole is the cold, dead eyes of the creature wearing your face. And then, finally, mercifully, nothing at all.
