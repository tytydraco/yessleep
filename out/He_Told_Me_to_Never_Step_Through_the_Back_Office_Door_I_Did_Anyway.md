TW: >!gore!<



It is quite odd to think how it is that I found sanctuary. A group that treats me with utmost respect is a privilege I fear I mustn't in any circumstance deserve, yet such seems to remain firmly in my grasp. I feel comfort in this new state of mind, comparable to that of a fantasy world which thrives in discomfort. My wings have spread wide and beautiful, and a third eye has awakened within, which guides me to a happier future and the most wonderful people I have had the pleasure of talking with.

I found it about two months ago, when I decided to pick up a second job. The decision was painful. But I desperately needed the money. And so, I called the workplace of my old high school job: a retailer that sells food and houseware products. I wanted pay and familiarity, which was promised if I got the position, for the last thing I needed was added stress. It turns out that the store was under new ownership and much of the previous staff moved on from the place, including my old manager. I still went through with the decision, and secured an interview for the upcoming Saturday.

I cannot stress enough how badly I needed the job. I had made irresponsible decisions, and many payments were due within two weeks. With the job, the deadlines would barely be made in time.

Feelings of anxiety piled before the interview. I felt restless, and I sensed an arduous, stressful feeling in the air. On Friday, I calmed my mind with online media; red light beamed through my eyes. The imagery was fascinating, and served as a good distraction from the stresses of the real world. I recall falling asleep that day to the sound of rain.

The interview was scheduled for nine in the morning. When I arrived, not a single vehicle sat parked on the lot. The building appeared bigger than I remembered and its front was dark with shadow. An eeriness emanated from the door, and when I stepped through, all was silent. But to my relief, an associate greeted me with a large smile. He wore a red vest, jeans, and average, typical sneakers. He seemed genuinely happy to be there.

“Hey, are you here for the interview?” he asked.

“Yes, that’s me.”

“Alright. Doug is waiting for you in the office. Just go through the silver doors in the back.”

“Thanks. I actually used to work here before the ownership change.”

His smile grew larger. “I’m sure he’ll hire you in a heartbeat then. Good luck!” 

The layout of the place remained the same, which could not be said about the displays and colors. The store’s new look was uncanny, at least for me, of whom expected little change in the interior’s appearance. Each isle was vacant. And the silver doors remained in the same spot and same rusted, dented state since I had left the job prior.

Beyond the silver doors lay a vast maze of boxes stacked horribly high. And to get to the office, one has to cross through such a maze. Its layout changed since I’d last seen it. Luckily, a yellow streak of paint was splattered upon the floor, and curved through the boxes, and eventually led to the office door.

An indescribable ambience haunted that back room, to which I felt the very second I stepped within. It was a new feeling to which I’d never experienced beforehand, and I could feel it in my stomach, a wriggling horror which heightened the deeper I stepped through that maze, meticulously following the yellow line, and peaked upon reaching the office door. Somehow I built up the courage to knock. Without hesitation the door swung open, and Doug shot a glare straight through me. He stood tall, almost as high as the doorway. His shadow stretched far against the boxes stacked behind me. 

“Hey there Rick,” he said with a smile. “Here, step right in. I’ve got a chair set, all nice for you.”

There was something about Doug that was off. He was too nice. And he was too prepared. The office was warm, but admittedly comfortable. He decorated the place as if it was a log cabin in the midst of the tallest mountain-peaks. A buck’s head sat above the desk, and candles were lit upon the shelves. The floor, which was once concrete, was now replaced with dark oak hardwoods. A light dangled overhead. Doug urged me to sit down and make myself comfortable, whilst he adjusted the collar of his flannel shirt. A steaming mug of coffee sat near his keyboard. He prepared some for me as well.

We went through the general motions of an interview. He asked the usual questions, wishing to hear why I wanted to work at the store, and my overall experience with retail. Twiddling his thumbs, he stared at his computer screen, and licked his cracked lips. I assume he was reading my resume.

“Alight Rick, I’m going to be honest,” he said. “You were going to get hired anyway. Previously working in this building basically secured that. It’s only company policy that I ask you all these cheesy questions.”

“That’s great, Doug, I really appreciate it. I needed this,” I said, shifting in my chair. “Well, I like what they’ve done with the place.” That was a lie.

“They’re doing a good job, aren’t they? I mean, look at this office! Just wish they’d install the new sound system already.”

“It’s a bit freaky out there with no music.”

Doug stood up and paced around the desk, placing his hand on my shoulder. “See, that’s why I fear we haven’t been getting a consistent stream of customers. Sales have been down in the mornings. Lack of music probably scares em’ away!” He laughed. “Everything eventually picks up, though.” He continued to pace around the room. “We’re probably gonna keep you in the aisles, stocking shelves and whatnot, pushing freight. I’m sure you’ll do just fine.

“There is one catch, however. And Rick, I urge you to listen to what I say: you must never step through that door.” He pointed to the back corner of the office. “Never open that door. Ever. I think I can trust you enough to listen. The previous owners urged us to keep it shut. Not that you’d be able to open it anyway; it’s locked from the inside. But don’t ever try to get in there, *ever*.”

As I peered into that dark corner of the room, evil seeped into my heart. And all went muffled, and I could hear nothing but the faintest noises throughout the store’s entirety. That door consumed me. It whispered to me. I thought of all the pretty imagery I saw the night before: the reds, the blacks, the yellows, the swirling patterns. It all came before me at once, and I snapped back into reality. Doug was shaking my hand. He was sweating.

“Alright,” he said. “You’re going to start tomorrow. You’ll get paid more because it’ll be Sunday. Be here around ten. I’ll have paperwork for you to sign.”

“Okay,” I said with a stutter. “I’ll be here. Right at ten-o-clock.”

The next morning was gray and dreadful. The sun hardly shone through the flat blanket of clouds above. I felt a bit sick whilst driving to the store. The night had been restless, yet calm. Puddles, like shattered glass, reflected the sky above. Traffic kept steady, and before I realized, I missed the turn into the store’s parking lot.

I parked the car just five minutes before ten. It wasn’t dead this time. It was quite busy, actually, as expected of a Sunday morning. Yet silence still bellowed through the customer’s footsteps. And once I talked with Doug again, he led me back into the office and plopped an unfathomably large stack of papers in front of me. It took roughly an hour to cycle through them all, harshly signing my name until my hand grew numb. By the end, the warm light which dangled above began to flicker. After that, we chatted a bit, and he took me for a tour around the place. Most of it I already knew about, which was a fact Doug loved to reinforce intensely, followed by the phrase: “it’s company policy I tell you this stuff, even if you’ve done the job before.”

At around one-o-clock, the store was empty. An ambient hum was ringing in my brain, and I phased out entirely what Doug was telling me. I thought about the door. Why did I feel that way about the door? What rests beyond the door?

Doug led me to the front of the store, and introduced me to everyone who worked there. Kindness and comfort clearly filled all of their souls. A part of me was jealous; I was fond of their smiles which I could never seem to muster in the real world. Such disgusts me. Humans are a plague that infests society with pointless problems and hatred. It seems, as a society, we will never learn to love and respect each other, and agree to disagree. That thought ruins me every day. But I’ll save those ramblings for another time.

Marie was the associate assigned to train me. She was an older woman who started working there once the new management took ownership. She absolutely loves the job, and kept telling me so over and over. I felt irritated by her, at least to start. And furthermore, she seemed to like me as well. We started in the household chemical area of the store, which Marie kept in pristine condition. For her looks, she seemed scarily efficient. 

After maintaining the chemical aisles, Marie urged we must clean up the food department. I cannot say she was wrong; it took over an hour to fix the shelves to standard. And once the aisles were recovered, we began to stock the products.

“This is my ritual every Sunday,” she explained. “Say, how was this store before the new management took over? I started here after the fact.”

“It’s honestly the same as it was a while back,” I said. “The looks have changed for sure, but the departments and store layout remain the same. Although it is quite odd not to have music playing through the speakers. And I do get weirded out a bit by the changes to the displays.” 

Marie stacked cans of soup upon the shelf and spoke: “You’ll surely get used to it. And the music should be fixed pretty soon.”

“Yes, that’s what Doug said.”

“Doug’s a nice guy. He hasn’t let me down yet. Say, you know the deer head in the office? My husband sold it to em’ a bit ago. It really brings that room together.”

“Does your husband go hunting often?”

Marie turned towards me. “It’s what pays the bills. As long as I get to stay here at the store, I’m fine with whatever he does. Hunting benefits me, too. He supplies– ouch.” Marie nicked her finger whilst cutting a box, and blood seeped down her hand. “It’s very warm. Let me run to the back real quick, I won’t be long.”

Marie sometimes exhibited very strange behavior, and as time went on, I noticed how similar the employees were. Their faces were cold without expression, yet they exuded incredible amounts of kindness. Just the place! Yes, I had finally found my people. And about two weeks later, a beautiful event solidified my feelings. Such is so great, I wish to share it here on this website to the whole wide world. Oh, how so clandestine, how such a glorious decadence, could be hidden in a retail store!

I was assigned a closing shift, and as soon as I turned the key and locked the front door, whispers spoke through the walls. They told me I must dart to receiving, and past the office door. The speakers, which were now fixed, blasted a wonderful piano ballad, which seemed to grow louder as I passed the rusted silver doors. The yellow streak upon the ground accelerated forward, and now at this moment it all made sense; the answer was in the splattered, yellow paint all along. It is the very thing which guided me to salvation! I bashed through the office door, and beheld the sight of the forbidden door, just hardly cracked open. I stepped through, despite Doug’s words, and my intuition rewarded my daringness! Red was splattered everywhere, I tell you, and amorphous piles of flesh piled around my coworkers. 

I joined them, and we all sat within the circle, chanting to the piano tune, smearing the warmth of blood across each other’s bodies. And Doug and Marie welcomed me with open arms, and they explained how all the animal parts are acquired from many people, one of them being the husband of Marie. No wonder they refused me access to the room right away! But now, after realizing the kind of being I was, they welcomed me to the prayer circle, surrounded by the aroma of rotting matter and candles, scarfing down the remains of past life! The holy grail dangled from the ceiling, and with a rope tied to her neck, we peered up to the horribly high ceiling, and felt her warmth drip to us below! It was just like the footage I’d seen online. Arousal boiled in my blood.

I know I’ve explained this all inordinately quick, but you see, when speaking about this matter, I get far too excited, and so I just skipped right to the good stuff.  I believe it is our job to control life in this world, for it is the plague of Earth. We have ruined this lovely environment. And solving such issues is exactly what Doug, and everyone else, wishes to come out of the movement. The human race, and all Animalia must be vanquished. I still refuse to fathom that there’s people out there like me. Me! Of all people, me! Who shares my motives! So join us, sisters, brothers! Help the cause!
