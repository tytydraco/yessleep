I ran into an old friend today. We'll call him Russ. Russ was the kid who actually went bigfoot hunting and took it seriously- but he's a good dude. we were both getting coffee at the same time at the gas station. Guess he's writing a book where he travels around and interviews people who believe they've experienced the paranormal. He said most of the time the people themselves are more interesting than the stories. Anyway he told me there's a guy who lives about three hours out of town up, up in a holler.

This guy sent Russ an email with all kinds of pictures of oddities. Fiji mermaids, shrunken heads, stuff like that. Mostly hoax stuff and labeled that way. Here's the kicker- he claims he has a real magical creature that he caught coming out of a cave on his property. There was a kind of blurry video of what looked to me like a slimy emaciated rabbit with some kind of skin infection. It was like it had greenish grey moss patches growing from it's skin, and some dark liquid seeping from some of the patches where it must have been scratching or something. It was in one of those cages you trap stray cats in. It could have been ai or a trick of the light but it looked like this rabbit thing had green human eyes. Russ said sometimes people fake stuff to get you to show up and then tell a story about how it escaped yada yada.

Now I've been really bored, hours cut back at work and recently single with very few friends left in town. So when Russ invited me to some out to meet this guy I just agreed. It was something to do. After dropping my car at home, making sure the cat had enough food and water, and dropping a quick note in case my ex stopped by (pathetic I know), we drove out.

The house was on a big property, we drove for at least ten minutes after getting through the gate. The guy who I'll call The Collector had set up the bottom half of his house like a museum. He gave us beers to drink while we toured. Later he told he got started when he inherited from a great uncle who ran a carnival side show and made most of the displays himself after training to be a taxidermist. The wet specimens were real, a baby pig with two heads will probably haunt my dreams for weeks. Honestly most of the time Russ was talking to him I just wandered around and looked at stuff. 



Eventually we asked about the creature. It was fucking real. I mean, I don't know if it was magic or just an ill animal but I know when I saw it I felt like I shouldn't be seeing it. It was seeping less, but you could see spots where the liquid stained the tan fur. Maybe I was just freaked out already from the Janus pig but I fucking swear that thing was hard to look at, like I couldn't really tell if I was seeing a regular rabbit or this thing. Almost like it was flickering.



I could be remembering it wrong. Because we did something stupid then and it's part of the reason I don't know if I want to go on the expedition tomorrow. See the collector said that he's collected some of the liquid that came out if you pressed on the... growths.. which in person looked less like moss and more like thick mycelium, a liquid came out. It was thick and grey. The creature didn't seem to react to being touched. The collector mixed some into a glass of water and offered us to try it, promising it had changed his life. 



We should have left then. Russ would have left. I was nearly drunk and feeling adventurous and I asked him how long it lasted. He said in this small amount just seconds. So I took the glass and at his instruction drank it all at once.

It tasted so bad. I think I can still taste it now. Sweet but also incredibly bitter and an earthy rotten aftertaste. I don't want to say what it smelled like. The effect was instant. I don't fully know how to describe it. It was one second I'm sitting in this guys living room, surrounded by display cases and being watched by this creepy ass rabbit thing and the next I'm floating in cold water. It was dark but there were shapes moving through it. I moved towards a slightly lighter area and broke through the surface of the water, gasping for air. I had only a second to look around before I was back to normal. What I saw was...somewhere else. A huge pool of water ringed in stone with raised gargoyle-like fountains in the center.



The details of the room were fuzzy, it was very big and seemed mostly empty other than the pool. It looked ancient. It felt ancient and other and yet like I should remember it. I looked down at the water and saw the dark shapes swimming around me. One of them got closer and closer to the surface. The face of a woman poked out of the water. Her big almost amphibian green eyes staring at me, her smile revealing shark-like rows of teeth. 



Then I blinked and Russ was asking me if I was okay and why I was making that rasping sound that i didn't know I was making. And I felt incredible- like I was wrapped in cotton and walking on air and dancing all at the same time but I wasn't moving at all. That feeling lasted several glorious minutes. Disclaimer, don't do random drugs especially if they come out of a freaky rabbit. Russ tried it and he saw the fountain too. That's what maybe scares me the most. We all saw the same place. Unprompted.



Part of me thinks this must be some elaborate trick, that somewhere the collector mush have a picture of this freaky fountain pool and he drugged me and held it in front of my face. Or I've lost my mind.

Anyway the collector invited us back tomorrow to check out the cave on his property. Said he plans to do an overnight trip to get in deeper than he's gotten before and he wants us to come and document it. Russ is going. I said I would sleep on it. I don't know. 



On the one hand, why the f#%% would I go where the psychedelic producing cryptid crawled out of (honestly suspect it's just a rabbit with an infection, I can't explain the effect it had on me though), on the other hand Russ practically begged. He doesn't want it to be just him and the collector if things got really weird.

Should I go?
