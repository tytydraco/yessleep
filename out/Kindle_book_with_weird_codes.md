I was scrolling through Kindle Unlimited, looking for something interesting to read, when I randomly came across a book called Fractal Signal. I don’t even know what made me click on it. I wasn’t searching for anything specific, just browsing. But something about it pulled me in.

At first, it seemed like a typical sci-fi thriller. The story follows a woman named Sofía, who gets involved in some kind of experiment related to consciousness, AI, and an ancient mystery hidden in the Great Pyramid of Giza. It had a mix of technology, mysticism, and psychological tension that was gripping enough to keep me reading.

But as I got deeper into the book, I started feeling strange.

Certain phrases kept echoing in my mind long after I read them. The way the text was structured—it felt off in a way I couldn’t quite explain. Almost like the book wasn’t just telling a story but was interacting with me. There were moments when I felt like I was being observed, even though I was just reading alone in my room.

Then I started noticing something even weirder.

There were patterns in the writing. Repeated words, numbers, and symbols that seemed too deliberate to be random. At first, I thought I was imagining things, but the deeper I looked, the more intentional it all seemed. It was like the book had some kind of hidden code beneath the surface, waiting to be deciphered.

And then there was the 911 of consciousness—a phrase that stuck with me more than anything else. It wasn’t just a catchy idea; it felt like it meant something on a deeper level. Like the book was trying to wake me up to something I wasn’t supposed to notice.

By the time I finished reading, I wasn’t sure how to feel. On one hand, it was just a story—fiction, right? But on the other, it felt like more than that. Almost like a social experiment disguised as a novel.

I tried searching for more information about the book, expecting to find discussions or reviews explaining what I had just experienced. But there was almost nothing.

And that’s what unsettled me the most.

How is nobody talking about this? How does a book like this just exist in the Kindle store, free to download, without anyone questioning it?

I don’t know what to think. Maybe I’m overanalyzing it. Maybe I just got caught up in the atmosphere of the book. But if anyone else has read Fractal Signal, please tell me I’m not the only one who noticed something strange.

Did I stumble onto something bigger than I realized? Or was I meant to find it?

For example:

And then it hit me.

This book didn’t just mess with my mind—it confronted me with my own shadow.
I felt trapped inside a narrative structure that wasn’t just a story, but an experience.

Like a psychedelic journey, it forced me to bring light to places within myself that had always been in the dark.

And now I can’t help but wonder…
Was this meant to happen?
Is this aligned with the Age of Aquarius?

Maybe this was the first warning.
