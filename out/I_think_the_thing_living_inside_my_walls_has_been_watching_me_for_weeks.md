I didn’t think much of it the first time it happened.

  


Before the horrors began, flicking the light off and watching my bedroom drown in darkness was something that brought me comfort. Watching the little slither of moonlight break through the crack in the curtains, illuminating just a little piece of my barren closet brought me a feeling of *warmth.* Now, every light in my house blazes and there is no force nature could conjure up that would inspire me to turn them off.

  


It was the scratching. Soft at first, as though someone was tentatively trying out fingernails for the first time. Rhythmic, dragging slowly across the wall where my head lay. My bed doesn’t have a headboard so the noise bounced around my skull as I squinted awake, met with nothing but that tiny slither of light. Except tonight, for the first time since I moved in a few weeks ago, it was icy cold dread that sat in the pit of my stomach with not a flicker of warmth to be felt.

  


I thought it was in my mind - because no sooner had I lifted my aching head than the scratching stopped, no longer feeling like it was close enough to reach inside me*.* Instinctively, I ghosted a hand across the wall, half expecting a mighty *rip* to sound across the paintwork, but nothing. Only the sound of my shallow breathing alone in the darkness. And so, with that cold pit swimming in my stomach, I went back to sleep.

  


The next time it happened, I almost missed it. Only the sound of my friends’ laughter bounced around my skull as I adjusted my headset, cackling as we lost our game to some dumbass mistake that barely registers as important now. I’d pulled the headset from my ears, still laughing when I froze with the mic hanging limply from my fingers. Deafening thumping*,* like boots pounding on floorboards, smashed and splintered above my head.

  


*Bang. Bang. Bang.*

  


Goosebumps exploded across my skin as I tried to pinpoint the source of the noise, cowering in my chair. To my absolute horror, I realised it was *moving.* Something - or someone - was thumping furiously across my bedroom floor above my head and maybe had been for hours. My game had been blasting directly into my ears and *someone had been walking around my bedroom the entire time.*

  


So I called the police. I called the police - even though the banging stopped shortly after I rang - and they came. Notably, they came to tell me there was no sign of a break-in. I insisted they listen- *something was pounding up there -* and they spoke of stray dogs in the neighbourhood, shrugging as though this somehow had any relevance to what I was telling them.

  


“Are you listening?” I’d asked, exasperated, “It was *pounding,* it wasn’t a fucking animal!”

  


But they insisted nobody was there, limply reassuring me so they could escape my house at the too-late hour. All my blankets lay crumpled in a basket in the bedroom so I curled up into a ball that night on the sofa, terrified and shivering in the frigid cold. And yet, from downstairs, all night long I could hear a horrible scratching from the bathroom, dragging nails so slowly and loudly it echoed around my dreams too.

  


It was easier than I’d expected, convincing myself I’d imagined the entire thing and getting on with my existence. Time has a funny way of erasing certainty and so the whole debacle was shrugged off as a fleeting bout of madness until 3:21 am the following Friday. I was slightly tipsy after a bar crawl with friends, still awake with my flickering TV offering the only light bouncing around my room in technicolour. It was why I thought the shape sliding across my closet wall was just a welcome addition to the post-alcohol light show. Why I didn’t jump out of my window when it moved agonizingly slowly across the open space, slicing right through that crack of moonlight.

  


I froze eventually, of course, my whole body tensing as I watched a steady, deliberate shadow glide across the wall to my right. Breath grew stale in my lungs as this *mass* slid along to the next wall, right as the banging started.

  


*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

  


It was back; deafening crashes of impossibly heavy feet slamming into the ground *in my bedroom as I existed in it,* while this shadow continued its assault across my wall. There are no words that exist in any language to describe how I felt in that moment. It was as though every possibility of every terrifying thing I could conjure up inside the walls of my imagination, could be true. It was the idea that this black mass stomping its way almost invisibly through my bedroom could be anything. I could imagine the worst thing a human has ever seen, and it could simply be worse.

  


Horror. Pure, undiluted horror.

  


I always thought I’d be the type of guy to sprint in that situation, but I wasn’t. It was as though bony arms had locked around my being, holding my head in place and forcing me to watch this performance open-mouthed. And so I witnessed as this shadow, tall enough to graze the ceiling, slinked opposite me while the house practically shook with the sound of mighty, hell-shaking footsteps. I even watched as it slid, so slowly, behind the TV. I watched as it began to take form, seemingly condensing down and becoming impossibly smaller till it disappeared *behind* the TV.

  


Nothing. It had become nothing.

  


Till it was everything. Everything in my house that could make noise exploded with it; crashing and screaming and banging and clattering as the man in the show ran up to the screen, contorting his face in horror as he bared his teeth in a silent, bloody scream, eyes bulging out of his head. Shadowy arms reached out threateningly from behind the television, slowly moving around both sets of walls as if to grab the entire bedroom in its clawed grasp. Those arms came at me from both directions, swallowing the space in darkness with each passing inch. Maybe I’d have been swallowed too, had I not finally found my legs and scrambled free, my screams lost in the chaos as I flew out the door.

  


And it all stopped. Just like that. Deafening noise fell to impossible silence as I slammed to the floor, my laboured shrieks swallowed by the carpet. I don’t think I moved for about two hours, terrified that the pressure on the back of my head was a gnarled face pressing nose-first into my hair. Horrified that the weight on my body was not my anxiety, but a demon lying on my back, waiting to snap my neck if I dared move.

  


When I finally gained courage I’ll likely never find again and scrambled into my living room, it was only to desperately hang a crucifix on a rusty nail on the wall, as though inviting light into my home would somehow blot out darkness so intense. I’d barely turned my back when it hammered to the floor mockingly, loud enough you could have convinced me a wall had fallen down at my feet, not a 5-inch cross.

  


Quiet thumps followed me through the walls as I padded back downstairs, so cold with fear that I was convinced each step would be my last. I could feel a thousand eyes boring into my soul from every direction, and when my eyes met the painting at the bottom of the stairs which had greeted me every day for three weeks, I could only stare blankly. It was a lakeside town with people milling around, feeding the sheep in the pen. The kind of scene to light a room up, the kind to settle your stomach. Or at least, it had been this morning.

  


But the sheep were gone. The pens were empty. And the townsfolk lay face-down in the water, dead in the crimson lake.

  


I can’t tell you much about what happened after that. It was the kind of blur years of therapy could recover for me, but I'll pay to keep it buried. Of course, I never stepped foot in that house again after I slammed my way out of the front door for the last time, falling to my knees in the gathering hailstorm and sobbing till my sanity came back. I considered my possessions tainted, the place ruined in such an unholy way that nothing could bring it back. My real estate agent has been on the phone with me in the last few days, and it’s curious that she isn’t surprised in the least I want to leave.

  


I don't know what that thing was, or how many of them there were. I don't know if one or a thousand monsters watched me in my home for three weeks, hollow eyes on me as I slept with my arm hanging off the side of the bed temptingly. I just know with every fibre of my being, that had I stayed, they would have clawed their way out of the walls and torn right through my body till I was a mess of veins and regret.
