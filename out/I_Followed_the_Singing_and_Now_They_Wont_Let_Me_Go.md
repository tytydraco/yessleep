I’m not sure how to even start writing this. I am aware I’m going to sound crazy, and, to be fair, I’m not convinced of my own sanity.

I suppose I gotta start by explaining the context that lead me into that situation. My name is Kelly, I’m 26 years old, I’ve been on and off of therapy for about seven years now; I used to live alone and I had a decent paying job that brought me no joy, way too much unnecessary stress and gave me a pretty bad burntout, then they laid me off. So I had to go back to living with my mother, my stepfather and their weird twelve years old son. My family was sort of distant, but supportive in their own way. I mean, I couldn’t complain. I was unemployed and I had a roof over my head, food on the table, and minimum expectations to meet.

My mother’s new home and it’s neighborhood was unfamiliar to me, but it wasn’t that hard to find a dealer and people to smoke pot with. Sometimes when I was feeling insomniac I would walk to this abandoned construction site near a forest and smoke by myself. It was a small town, so I had to be discreet about those habits.

So, there I was, feeling like shit most of the time, using alcohol and weed to ease the guilt I was feeling, just trying to survive day by day. Until one day I couldn’t fall asleep. I kept scrolling on social media and feeling that sense of dread, tired but unable to sleep, feeling like I needed to do something about it. It was past 2 pm when I pulled a coat on top of my sleeping gown and took my joint to the construction site.

It was always a bit scary going there by myself as a woman, but at 2 am the five minutes walk there was scarier than I’d like to admit. I passed a sleeping homeless man on my way and my heart started racing. Every little noise made me jumpy. I actually thought about going back home, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to sleep without a joint to calm me down, and I wasn't about to smoke at home. So I continued down the street, feeling my heart pounding against my chest, my quick and superficial breath forming vapors in the cold air.

The building only had the front wall up. The floor was covered in tall grass and weed. There were no doors or windows, only the frames where they were supposed to be. The wall was stained from mold and dust. It smelled faintly of pot, freshly stepped-on grass, mold and dead roaches.

I carefully checked if I was alone, and then got in and lit my joint. Inside it was just like a regular abandoned construction, except there were trees blocking the path to the rest of the place. Maybe it was the joint hitting me harder than normal, but I decided to cross the area and see if there was something behind those trees. I’ve never searched that part before.

 I walked into the trees. First, carefully, trying not to make too much noise. Then I realised the terrain was longer than I had thought. Those trees led me to the forest. And I could hear music, singing and percussion. Some sort of chanting.

Scared but curious, I followed the source of the noise. I scratched myself on a few branches, but I got going. The chanting grew louder, I felt something was calling me.

It might have been the weed or my insomnia playing tricks on my brain, I thought in the back of my mind. But I just kept going. The sound was getting easier to locate. Before the forrest opened into a meadow, I stopped.

I could see from afar about eight women, all wearing black, white or gray long flowing dresses. Except one of them, who was wearing purple. I couldn’t get closer without being seen, so their faces were blurred in the dark by some incense they were burning. Most of those women were young, around my age, but there was some older women too. Some were dark skinned and some were light skinned, thin or fat, but all had white hair and symbols draw into their faces and arms. They were chanting in a circle, unaware of my presence.

I felt unable to move. My heart was jumping and my breathing was so loud I thought they could hear me. But I could move. Nor closer, not away.

I can’t tell, from that point on, what was real or what was hallucinations from insomnia or distortions on my perceptions from the joint, or what was both. I stood there as they acted their little rite.

The oldest of the woman in black got into the center of the circle. She yelled words that made no sense for my ears. All the others knelled into the floor, with their hand threw up in the air. All, except for the lady in purple. The older woman touched her face, said something intelligible, to which she replied by lowering her head and looking at the ground. The older woman hugged her. For what felt like hours.

Then the older woman took an object out of her front pocket. I couldn’t see what it was at first, as it was wrapped in a stained white cloth. Then the moonlight hit the iron as the object was unwrapped like a present. The blade reflected the moon light. I realised it was a knife.

That had to be enough for me. Even though I was curious to know what the fuck was going on, even though I felt drawn to those strange women, I wasn’t just about to witness a crime. I forced myself to make my way back as quiet as possible.

The strange thing was that the weed seemed much stronger. I felt confused and uneasy. Walking myself home felt like a dream. One of those you can’t exactly call a nightmare, but are still anxiety inducing.

I went to my room and passed out as soon as I laid down, without even showering. When I woke up, I wasn’t sure how much of what I saw was a weed induced dream and how much of it really happened. I tried to forget about it. But unemployed people are prone to obsessions. And I spent the whole day thinking about what I saw. Should I tell someone? Should I ask around trying to get information? Was that a religious practice or some sort of gang initiation? I just couldn’t stop thinking about what I should do.

I decided to message my smoking buddy, Elena, and ask her to come to me that night. She was reluctant. Said whatever people were doing, I should just leave them alone. But I mentioned the knife and said I was scared someone might have been hurt, and she finally agreed. I didn’t tell her I was questioning my memories and perceptions at that point.

I felt like a teenager for having to ask my mom for permission to have a “sleep over” with Elena. And even more childish when we sneaked out to the abandoned site. But it felt easier to go there with someone. I took her to the spot I saw them doing their rituals last night and we chatted a little as we stood and waited. But no one showed up that night.

“Yeah, whatever it was, it’s not worth it finding out, Kelly”. Elena said on our way home. I nodded. But deep down, I didn’t agree. In fact, I went back the next time, at the same time.

To my disappointment, nobody was there. Only the trees, the owls, bats and the rest of those night animals.

“I must have been dreaming it” I said to myself on my way back home.

I tried not to dwell on that, but it became the theme for most of my nightmares. My insomnia got worse, I’d wake up sweating from a night terror, and I'd zoom out during conversations and catch myself daydreaming about it.

“How much of that was real?” was the question I kept asking myself.

Then a few weeks ago I woke up from a night terror at around 3pm. The weirdest part was I could hear a faint chanting, even thought my house was a few minutes walk from the construction site. I woke up confused, stray strands of hair sticking to my sweaty forehead. Before I could think clearly, almost compulsively, I got up and silently left the house, still wearing my nightgown.

I could hear drums, getting louder as I got closer. They were beating to the sound of my heart. And they beat faster as I walked past the door frame from the abandoned site. There seemed to be something glowing behind the trees. I walked mindlessly towards the sound, like a zombie in search of brains. I stumbled on rocks and roots on the ground, got scratched by branches, but nothing, not even the fear I felt deep inside me, seemed to make me stop.

I saw the women. This time I think there were twelve of them. Same white hair, same long flowy monochromatic dresses. I shivered.

I recognized the older woman and the girl in purple. They seemed to repeat their ritual, except this time I stayed after the knife was unwrapped. And what happened took my voice away.

The older woman held the younger one with precision and care. In a affectionate gesture, like it was a display of kindness, the older raised the knife up to the youngers neck, and cut it. Blood splashed. A faint, suppressed noise of pain, followed. And them they were all crying, some even screaming, hiding their faces in their hands, holding their heads like they were holding on to their sanity. I could smell the blood pulsing out of the girls body.

They all got involved into a collective hug, holding the dying girl. Crying, shaking, moaning. I felt dizzy. I just had to close my eyes for a second.

And I did.

And I woke up in my bed at eleven am in the next morning, feeling heavy and confused. My body was suspiciously clean, which made me wonder if all of that was just some vivid, elaborated nightmare. But my arms still had the fresh bruises from the tree branches.

I called Elena before even leaving my room. She didn’t pick up. I tried to send an audio message, but no matter how I tried to phrase it, I sounded insane. So I just texted her to call me asap.

I made the effort to hang out with my family that day. Trying to feel somewhat normal. But I couldn't focus on anything but the questions in my head. Was it real? If it was, then who took me home? Who cleaned me? Who had touched my body without my permission and how did they do that without waking up my family?

Or was it a hallucination? Was I finally losing it? Had I scratched my arms myself somehow?

My weird half brother was looking at me like I was the weird one. Did he know something? Or was I so visibly shaken that even a kid could realize it?

“Hey, you’re doing alright?” I asked him at the dinner table that night.

He nodded. What was that expression on his face? Fear? Could he have heard anything last night?

“You seem a little…” I paused “worried” I said.

“You too.” re replied, and then left the table without finishing his meal. My mother just let him, my stepfather muttered something about teenagers.

I had the unexplainable fear that if I slept again, I’d see the witches. So I tried to stay awake. I drank a lot of coffee and watched super hero movies, even though I was never into that. Anything to keep me from dreaming. Or worse, entering that trance-like state and wandering into that forest again.

I fell asleep at 5 am. My mother woke me up for lunch at 12. I was anxious, tired, confused. I couldn’t taste the food. Could barely force myself to chew and swallow it. I didn’t know what to do with my time. I had no real friends there, Elena hadn’t replied. Which was typical for her, but she decided to be her annoying self right when I needed her to act like a friend.

That day was so confusing that I don’t remember what I did or when I felt asleep. I just woke up alone in the middle of the trees. Standing up. Like my body had moved itself there.

My brain told me to run back home. But my legs kept walking towards the meadow. I was shaking.

The ritual was similar. But the girl in purple, that same girl I saw dying, was still there, in her usual place; not only alive, but apparently unharmed. The usual happened: the music, the chanting, the kneeling, the unwrapping of the knife. But this time, the girl in purple took the knife. Her hands were shaking. She looked in my direction. I didn’t know if she could see me hiding behind the trees in the dark. I saw her close her eyes. And she slashed her own neck.

This time everything was silently. They held her carefully, carried her body somewhere I couldn’t see from where I was.

That’s when I fucked up for real, I think. That’s when I sealed my fate.

I wanted… No, I needed to see where they were taking her. I needed to know what the fuck was going on, weather she was still alive.

I forgot I was hiding for a second. I started following them. This time there was no music to cover the sounds of my steps on the dry leaves on the floor. Suddenly, one by one, like it was a choreography, they turned to me. I stood there for a second. I could see each one of their faces. No emotion. Just staring for what felt like forever.

I ran. I ran back home as fast as I could. I couldn’t tell if any of them were following me. I could barely think. I stumbled and fell. But I immediately got up and started sprinting again. Only to fall one more time.

I didn’t get up. I saw the poorly illuminated floor of the forest in front of me. My body hurt. And then I was in my bed. Naked. Bruised. Weird symbols were draw on my arms and legs, in which I could only guess was blood.

That’s when I decided to talk. If I was going crazy, they’d better get me some medicine or even lock me up if they had to. If this was happening for real, somebody had drugged me (or put me under some spell or whatever) and painted my naked body in blood.

First, I messaged Elena. A short audio message: “Hey, I really need to talk. I went back to that place and I was caught. I think they drugged me. I think they… they did something to me. It’s either that or I’m going insane, so, please, answer me”.

Then I waited for my mom to get home for lunch and took her aside.

I had already washed off the painting but I had taken pictures. I told her what had been happening and showed them. Her reaction wasn’t what I expected at all.

“First your brother, now you, too” she said. “We don’t interrupt the witches. We don’t talk about them. They can hurt us if we do. That’s how it is here. They’re harmless if you let them live. Just forget about them. It will all go back to normal. You just have to never talk about it again, and they’ll leave you alone”.

Needless to say, I was appalled. I tried to argue, but she yelled at me to shut up. I went to my room and cried until I had a headache. I didn’t leave my bed. I didn’t check my phone. I didn’t eat. I just stared at the ceiling, exhausted.

Eventually, I feel asleep.

I was surprised to find out I slept really well that night. And the other nights after that. I’d wake up feeling refreshed, inspired, even. I went back to job hunting. I made the effort to reconnect with old friends. Apparently, mom was right, all I had to do was ignore them and it would be alright. I was starting to forget what had happened, attributing it to a mental breakdown caused by being burned out. My memories of the event were feeling faint, spectral, dreamy.

But I noticed something wrong one morning. After almost two weeks of undisturbed sleep, I woke up marked in blood again.

I examined the patters in the mirror. It was very similar to the first one, I even compared it to the picture. It was a series of straight lines, diagonally, that meet and crossed each other. And then here and there there were curves and circles. It looked like indigenous body paint, but somehow more other worldly.

I washed it off in the shower. I didn’t tell anyone this time. No one was willing to talk to me about it anyway. I tried to keep up with my job hunting, studying and helping around the house routine, but I’d get shivers every now and then.

Weird things kept happening. I’d see bruises on my body and not remember how I got them. I’d sleep right after a shower and wake up covered in dirt and leaves. The painting would appear, occasionally. I tried my best to ignore all of that.

This morning I thought it had finally stopped. I checked my body. No new bruises. No paintings, no dirt. But when I got up and opened my wardrobe, I saw a small, antique looking wooden box. It had patterns carved into the lid and a golden clasp.

My hands shaked when I opened it. There was a knife inside. The knife, from the ritual.

I wish I could say I don’t know what to do. But that would be a lie. Something inside me is telling me to go back there, take the knife with me… and take the place of the dying woman in purple. I know that is my purpose now. I know I have to do it. They have chosen me, marked me, for some reason. I’m scared. I don’t know what is going to happen.

There’s no one I can ask for help, so I’m just posting this before I leave in the hopes of finding some comfort. I was never one to believe in the supernatural, but now I feel it in my veins. I’m not who I used to be. I feel too weak.
