It was a cold October day, the vibrant orange leaves a stark contrast against the gray pavement. My brown slippers blended with the fallen foliage, my bare, hairy legs barely able to stand without wobbling in the breeze. The string of my stained bathrobe, some of its patterns matching the cold bottle of Jack Daniels bumping against people, didn't matter. None of it mattered as I stared at the mannequin.

It had no facial features, but the rest of its body was identical to Jessica's. The nights we spent cradled together, nothing but our naked, entangled bodies providing warmth—that soothing warmth that gives you a sense of peace. All those memories flooded into me as I stared at it. I needed it, and taking a swig of courage, it was going to be mine.

"Sir, can I help you? You've been staring at our display for 10 minutes," a bloated man stepped out of the building, his voice stern but still carrying that customer service cheer. Hopefully, all that work I did as a realtor would pay off.

"I want the mannequin." The words felt like slobber as they fell out of my mouth. A look of pity and disgust came upon his face before he took a breath and adopted a look of judgment—a common one for me to see.
"Sir, you cannot have our display mannequins. Now please go, or I'll call the co—" I interrupted him, shoving five hundred dollars cash into his face, a mix of fake and real tears streaming down my face.

"P-please, I need her again..." I'm not sure if it was the cash, the disgust, or the disruption to his business, but he took my money, undressed the mannequin, and I walked out. I took a victory shot as I headed back home with what my drunken mind called a new Jessica.

I remember getting back to my house and nothing else from that moment. I barely remembered any of that as I woke up the next morning with a glossy white mannequin standing by my bedroom door. It almost scared the crap out of me, but I remembered enough that I could get past it to the bathroom.

After my morning business, I went to the kitchen, taking a hit from the flask as I fried up some eggs and bacon. The shaking pan calmed as I took another drink, my own brain drip-feeding me what had happened the day before. After eating, I took a shower and went to my bedroom to get dressed for "work." I couldn't handle a normal job yet. Luckily, I had plenty in savings for house payments, and I recycled cans for alcohol and food, going around town and collecting. You'd be surprised how bad the competition is.

Usually, I had to scramble through my dresser for a halfway decent outfit, but when I walked into my bedroom, two things were different. The mannequin was on the other side of the room, by my dresser and closet, which were now all organized.

I should have been more concerned, but the alcohol already made plenty of excuses. Blackout drunk, I did my laundry, and when I needed to go to the bathroom, I pushed the mannequin over—that's what I told myself.
Though there were no eyes, it felt like I was being watched as I changed in front of the mannequin. I went in thinking it was no problem and ended with a chill in my spine. I went over to it, felt her arms, gliding to her shoulder and neck, the warmth coming over me again. My finger was the needle of a record player, circling along the record as my hand stopped on the fake back muscles. I pushed her forehead against my own, the silence broken by the tears from my closed eyes hitting my shoes. If I opened my eyes, I felt this composed feeling would be torn away.
I felt along the wall, closing my bedroom door, keeping my eyes closed until I was in the living room, rummaging around the garbage on the table to find my house keys. Then, I entered the cold world that was reality.

I knew it was a mannequin. I knew the glossy plastic was never going to be the real warmth that was Jessica, but it was close enough. Was I crazy? Worse, I was sad and drunk, so any comfort was good comfort. I didn't think of how odd it was; I thought of the warmth and the burn of the alcohol as the day of can collecting blurred like any other day.

I bought a box of Hamburger Helper and ground beef with a new bottle and an empty flask as I returned home, almost forgetting about the mannequin. I drifted through my house, putting my keys down on the table with a clatter, which was odd as all the garbage had been removed. I went to the kitchen; the table was clean, and all the dishes from this morning were in the dish rack, and I definitely hadn't mopped the tile floor this morning.

Overall, the house smelled nicer. I went to my washer and dryer to throw my clothes in a hamper, stumbling as I took my shirt off, ready to throw it in until I realized the hamper wasn't where it usually was. I looked around for a moment before looking toward my bedroom door as my body was drained of the warmth that the alcohol provided. I saw the door open and the light on.

I walked in to find not just the closet and dresser organized, but the whole room organized, and by the bed was a now empty hamper with clothes spread around the bed, exactly how Jessica used to organize it, making me sick to my stomach.

When it happened, I put all her clothes in a garbage bag and buried them in the closet, and now they were all organized and clean on the bed to the left of my clothes. The worst sight was the mannequin dressed in some simple basketball shorts and a shirt that left its midriff exposed—a cut black shirt with a fading picture of the monster truck Grave Digger, Jessica's lounging clothes.
I had to go to the bathroom, the gas station burrito leaving my body as all the shock hit me. Why was it mimicking Jessica? How did it know how to copy Jessica? In a moment of panic, my body wanted comfort again, craved it like a starving animal, and only two things comforted me, and I didn't even want to look at that thing. I went to the kitchen, grabbing the bottle, popping the top into the garbage as I stepped to my backyard and drank my worries away.

I hadn't been to the backyard in a week. I couldn't because I would have to look at the lukewarm sight, the fact that all this sadness was my own fault, that it wasn't just sadness but also guilt. I looked out to the center of my yard, where the soft and disturbed dirt lay. The fusion of emotions, amplified by the bottle of liquor flowing through my body, was too much. I had to let it out. I screamed. I screamed of guilt, of sadness, of pain, and defeat as I crashed to the ground, slamming my fist into the ground until finally, the hooks of alcohol intertwined into my skin and propped up the hollow, cold man that I had become.

I needed warmth. The downed bottle wasn't enough; I needed more warmth. The sizzling of meat could be heard inside. Like a scared child, I stumbled back into my home, needing to rest my weight against the wall as I made my way into the kitchen.

The mannequin was standing in front of the stove, the pan that fried eggs this morning now browning the burger, a glass measuring cup ready to add water to finish the food. I stumbled, using the dining room chairs to make my way to it until I was right behind it, placing my hands on its hips as I closed my eyes and rested my head on her shoulder.

My body lost all its weight, like the warmth from her body melted me, my fingers gliding along her stomach, the plastic feeling like her. I could hear the water being added to the sizzling meat as I rubbed my head against her neck. I tried to sway back and forth like we used to. The tears started to flow again as the stiffness of the mannequin brought me back down. But like always, her warmth burned away my tears, and slowly her hips moved in tandem with mine, the shifting of the spatula moving the burger causing more cracking, the sifting of the powder from the white bag into the meal. In a moment, I could hear the lid being put on top, and the food began to simmer.

I opened my eyes to see the mannequin's hand come to a standstill as they approached my face. If it wasn't for the fake gleam of the plastic from the lighting, it might have pulled me from this mirage. I stared at the motionless figure; it was perfectly still. I closed my eyes for a few seconds before opening them up again, and it was in the same position.

I was drunk. I missed Jessica so much that I was beyond hammered, and I was imagining this mannequin was real. Excuses, excuses, excuses—that's all I needed.

"You're not real! Stupid fake thing, I'm just drunk...I'm always drunk, that's all..." The fire of anger dampened as I remembered what I'd been trying to drown: that I lost my job, kept drinking to make up for being a failure, which just made me more of a failure, and Jessica...

I needed sleep, that's all I thought as I went to the bedroom, pushing off all the clothes and shutting the light off. I laid there, my eyes spinning in my skull before it became too difficult to stay awake, and I passed out.

My nightmares are usually darkness, nothingness. But this was so colorful. I didn't see people or things, but colors. Reds and oranges swirling together, a beating rhythm making me feel like I was surrounded in warmth, the two colors entangled themselves over and over again, like a shifting fire. This is what I wanted. This was the exact same feeling of warmth of my final day with Jessica.
My eyes were blurred and having a hard time focusing because of the gleaming light hitting my eyes. I couldn't pull my head away as something was stopping me from pulling away. I couldn't move most of my body; my legs were wrapped around something. The only thing I had was my hands.

"Get off of me," I groaned in more annoyance, though fear was building. With a shove and yanking away, I was freed, and with some blinking, I saw the mannequin that I was sleeping beside, and it had no clothes on it once more.
I rushed to the bathroom, dry heaving as nothing was in my stomach anymore, washing my face, trying to wrap my brain around what I had let into my home. I stared into my reddening eyes. "Get a hold of yourself," I stated as I finally saw the husk of a man I was. 

The only thing that pulled me out of it was when the faucet in the sink started, and I rushed over to see the mannequin standing over the sink, pouring out all the alcohol that was inside the house.

"What the fuck are you doing?!" I rushed over, pushing her over, her head smacking against the dented counter as I turned the sink off, sticking my fingers in the drain, trying to get any alcohol that was left. I even licked the grime in the drain to get any sort of alcohol.

I was so driven for my fix that I forgot about the mannequin until something cold touched my foot. I looked down to see this black ooze dripping out of her head.

"No, no, no," I got on my knees, scrambling to her as I held her head, my hands getting covered in this oily liquid. "Stay with me, Jessica, please! I didn't mean it! I need you, please! I'll stop, I swear." I made these pleas as the frozen mannequin leaked onto my clothes, covering my hands in something I could never wash away.

This was all a week ago. I buried it in a five-foot-deep hole in the backyard, and I've been on the run, going around to Alcoholics Anonymous groups and facilities.

I don't deserve peace; I deserve to be in jail, but I want to keep my promise. I want to fix myself, to make sure I don't know warmth anymore and all that I know is a cold, cold cell, or even beyond that.
