The air in Valentines Morrow hung heavy with an otherworldly tension as I navigated the narrow, cobblestone streets. The quaint town seemed frozen in time, with vintage lampposts casting eerie shadows and the ancient buildings whispering secrets of a forgotten era. I had recently moved to this peculiar place, seeking solace in a town that promised a slower pace of life. Little did I know, Valentines Morrow held a dark secret, one that would soon unravel my world.  
  
I, Jonathan Hartman, was your average guy with an affinity for solitude. My move to Valentines Morrow was meant to be a fresh start, a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. The townsfolk, however, seemed to possess an unnatural devotion to a celebration I knew nothing about – Valentine's Day.  
  
The first sign of trouble appeared on the morning of February 14th. I awoke to find my mailbox overflowing with vibrant red envelopes adorned with heart-shaped symbols. Confused, I tossed them aside, dismissing them as an eccentric local tradition. Little did I realize the gravity of my oversight.  
  
As the day unfolded, the town began to transform. Streets once tranquil transformed into bustling lanes adorned with heart-shaped decorations. Shopkeepers displayed an array of love-themed merchandise, and the town's folk donned attire resembling Cupid's ensembles. Ignorantly, I continued my routine, oblivious to the impending disaster.  
  
It was in the quaint coffee shop, "Love Brews," that I first encountered the intensity of Valentines Morrow's obsession. The barista, a middle-aged woman with piercing blue eyes, stared at me as if I had committed a grave sin. Her words were laced with both concern and disbelief.  
  
"You're not wearing red," she pointed out, her tone accusing.  
  
I chuckled nervously, glancing at my plain blue shirt. "Is there some dress code for today?"  
She sighed, her eyes narrowing. "Valentines Day isn't just a celebration here, it's a way of life. Forgetting to wear red is like turning your back on the heart of this town. You need to get changed"  
  
Confused, I left the coffee shop, vowing to pay more attention to local customs as I desperately wanted to fit in. Little did I know, this was only the beginning.  
  
As the day progressed, I noticed a growing sense of unease among the townspeople. Murmurs of disappointment and frustration filled the air. It wasn't until I overheard a hushed conversation in the town square that the gravity of my ignorance struck me.  
  
"The outsider forgot about Valentine's Day," a woman whispered, casting accusing glances in my direction.  
  
 A sense of dread washed over me, realizing I had unwittingly defied a tradition that was more than just a celebration—it was the lifeblood of Valentines Morrow.  
  
The clock struck midnight, marking the end of Valentine's Day, and that's when all hell broke loose. The once charming town transformed into a nightmarish landscape. Eerie shadows danced in the moonlight, and ghostly whispers filled the air seemingly following my every step.  
  
I stumbled upon a group of townspeople engaged in a ritualistic ceremony, their eyes filled with an otherworldly glow. The town's mayor, draped in a crimson robe, approached me with a solemn expression. I was cornered with nowhere to go.  
  
"You have defied the heart of Valentines Morrow," he declared, his voice echoing through the night.  
  
I pleaded for forgiveness, explaining my ignorance about the town's customs. The mayor's gaze, however, remained unforgiving.  
  
"Valentine's Day is not just a celebration. It is our pact with the supernatural forces that keep this town alive. Without it, chaos ensues."  
  
As he spoke, the ground beneath us trembled, and grotesque creatures emerged from the shadows. The townsfolk, now possessed by an otherworldly force, surrounded me with malicious intent.  
  
In a desperate attempt to appease the enraged entities, the mayor proposed a solution. I had to perform a ritual to restore the balance and reaffirm my commitment to the town's traditions.  
  
With trembling hands, I followed their instructions, hoping to salvage what remained of my sanity. They put a red robe over me and started the ritual. They sang haunting songs about love and hearts bound together. It was all in an ancient language but I somehow knew what they said, each word feeling me with dread. One of the creatures approached me and I recoiled in horror. "DO NOT REJECT HER" cried the mayor so with all the strength I had left I stood my ground.

Before my eyes it transformed into the most beautiful woman I had ever seen and she placed a heart locket in my hand. "Do you promise to wear this and keep our traditions alive mortal?" she asked me. "I pppromise..." I stuttered and immediately the locket burned a heart shape in my hand. 

"Very well" she said with a glint in her eyes. "Remember you will be spared only once"

As the last word left her lips, the town fell silent. The creatures retreated, and the possessed townsfolk returned to their normal selves. The mayor nodded in approval, a glimmer of relief in his eyes.  
  
"You are lucky to be spared, outsider. Remember, in Valentines Morrow, love is not just a choice but a necessity for survival. You are one of us now"  
  
I left the town the next day, haunted by the supernatural encounter. Valentines Morrow, with its dark secret and arcane traditions, was a place I could never forget. 

As I was driving my car I could swear all eyes of the town were on me and I heard a faint whisper travelling with the wind "See you next year...."
