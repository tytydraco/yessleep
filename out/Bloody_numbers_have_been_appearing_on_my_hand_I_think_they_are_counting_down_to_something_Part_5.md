I was wandering in a dazed state down a sidewalk. I had no idea where to go, where Cassandra was, or what the strange organization that had taken her was either.

I thought again that maybe I should have just stayed. But the way Stillman spoke, the way he sounded certain he would handle the problem one way or the other made me think that if all efforts failed, that I would be burned alive, rather than let whatever this was sickness was spread. Worse still, Cass would likely follow me soon after if they failed to find some cure.

I knew I couldn't go back though, partly because of that feeling of hopelessness and partly due to the disturbing voice that nagged in the back of my mind. A voice that was not my own but felt like it was in my head.

It would not allow me to go back to that place.

Just thinking about returning caused my head to start hurting and that burning sensation in my blood to start again.

I took a deep steadying breath and continued staggering in the direction I hoped my apartment was. I considered they might have people posted there as well so I reconsidered after a while and decided to make my way to a cheap motel near the outskirts of town where I had been wandering.

My phone had been lost, but I picked up a cheap burner from a crappy mobile store on the way to the motel. I got to my room and was relieved when I found out that it had free Wi-fi. I started looking up any reported incidents of odd illnesses nearby and other things I could recall, no matter how incidental they might seem.

I couldn't find much after searching for an hour.

I almost gave up, but eventually I found a strange blog that had a story that sounded a little too familiar to be a coincidence. The person claimed to have seen someone murdered in a fountain of blood by a strange, masked individual. What struck me was the way they described the mask as one looking like a gargoyle.

Normally I would think the account was from a crazy person, but it was too similar to what I had seen to be anything but a witness to whatever the hell I had seen as well.

I immediately sent a message to the blogger asking about the encounter. After waiting for another hour, I had almost fallen asleep when I received a response.

“Who is asking?.....”

I responded as directly as I could without risking exposing my identity.

“Someone who has seen them too, or at least I think I did.”

There was a long pause and a response showed up again,

“We should meet, central park. Tonight at 10pm. Don’t be late, don’t be followed. The truth is worse than you think.”

I had no idea who this person was, but if they could help with any additional information, I would be lucky.

It was cold outside, though I kept going through periods where I could feel the chill and where it felt hot under my skin. I had lost almost another day and I was getting anxious, my time was almost up I needed a solution and I hoped that this person, whoever they were would be able to help.

The park was empty and I looked around suspiciously. I had no idea if the people who had kidnapped me were still out looking for a trail. Despite the isolated state of the place I felt nervous, like I was being watched. I saw a short man walk discretely to a park bench and sit down. He had thick glasses and an almost comical looking trench coat, which made his attempts at trying to look discreet or blend in almost laughable.

I approached slowly and was about halfway to the bench when he sat up and looked at me and then quickly behind me and around the park, likely to ensure we were alone.

“Are you....” I started to speak and he held up a fist and hissed at me,

“SSSHHHH! Not so loud and no names. Wait just a second.” He pulled a small item out of his coat. At first I thought it was a gun but he tinkered momentarily with it and a small dish extended around the nod in the center and I saw what looked like a directional microphone.

He aimed it at nearly all of the dark shadows and trees that loomed behind us and around us. Once he was satisfied, he put it away and spoke again.

“Can never be too careful. Alright, talk fast, are you saying you saw someone taken by the gargoyle man too?” He has a doubtful and slightly judgmental look that annoyed me, but I answered.

“Yes near a playground at night. A woman was attacked by that man. I tried to help but he attacked me too. He knocked me out and he and the woman were gone when I came to.”

I waited and watched him digest the story, I couldn't tell if he believed me by his expression alone. Eventually he nodded his head as if accepting that he was hearing the truth .

“Alright, here is the deal. These people, the ones with the gargoyle helms. They seem to be some sort of group that find and hunts people who are sick, sick with some sort of rare blood infection that is supposedly dangerous. The person I saw get attacked was my friend Max and his story was weird. He had contracted some sort of illness that had all the hallmarks of a hemorrhagic fever. The weird part was it was not hurting him, or at least he said it wasn't. I wanted him to go to the doctor because it was freaking me out. He really was fucked up, puking blood, it was coming from his eyes, but he said he did not feel like he was sick. He said he felt strong. I didn't know what to make of it until one day when we were coming back from the bar, he was attacked. The man in the mask did something to him. He said something was inside of him and he head to do what needed to be done. Suddenly I am knocked on my ass and the man takes Max and I hear this god awful scream that didn't sound like him at all.”

The man stopped speaking and looked over my shoulder, frowned and then resumed.

“After freaking out about it I tried to find out where Max went but I found nothing. He was declared missing and I was questioned, but nothing ever came up. Eventually I found out about similar events occurring to people across the state that have all reported abductions by people in these weird masks. Always when a friend or someone they knew had been seemingly sick with something. Worse they are not the only ones taking people. Some weird government group has been abducting these sick people as well and taking them away to do God knows what to them. Knowing the government probably weaponizing the illness or whatever it is.” He snorted and was about to continue when I heard a loud beeping from his pocket and suddenly his expression changed and he looked at me and shouted,

“Run! Someone's here.” I looked behind me just in time to see men in biohazard suits coming out of the shadows. One had leveled some sort of gun at me and I fell to the ground, narrowly dodging a dart of some kind. I saw the man I had been speaking with taken off his feet as he was trying to get away.

I started to panic and felt my chest lurch and the burning feeling welling up again. I tried to move but I froze and it felt like my limbs couldn't move. I looked down and saw a dart sticking out of my leg. I slumped back down and as the men moved in with restraints to detain me, something unexpected happened.

The man who was bending down to cuff me let loose a muffled sound, followed by a wet gurgle. I paused in disbelief as I saw what looked like some strange multi bladed knife or glaive sticking out of his head.

There were panicked shouts followed by actual gunfire as the men in the hazmat suits fought back against whoever or whatever was attacking them.

The burning feeling started to increase and I could feel my limbs again. I sat up and saw another man's head vanish and it came clean off to the swing of a large doubled headed axe. The figure wielding it was unmistakable, they wore that same leering gargoyle head as I had seen before. Whoever this person was, they did not like the people who had kidnapped me. I thought I heard the figure mumbled something along the lines of,

“Blasphemous wretches, forgive them father, they know not what they do.”

I swear I saw a man in a hazmat suit fire a shotgun at the masked man, at point blank range. But he did not react, his response was neatly separating the gunman's head from his shoulders after the failed shot.

Most of the hazmat man were dead or dying and the gargoyle headed man stomped toward me, axe raised in the air.

That burning feeling increased and a wave of heat and blood came off my body as I screamed. The liquid seemed to be boiling somehow and it splashed the masked man who howled in pain and fell onto his back. Whatever I had just done had stopped him momentarily.

I got up and suppressed the strange urge to fight. Instead I ran as fast as I could.

The masked man regained his footing and shouted after me.

“You will only die tired creature. Let me give you a clean death, before the society makes you into something worse trying to cure you.”

He started moving toward me but was engaged by a group of hazmat suit wearing gunman and was forced to fight back while I fled. I ran for what felt like hours. I can scarcely remember it though, like my body was on some sort of auto pilot.

Eventually I found my way back to the motel and after checking around for a while to make sure I was not followed, I staggered back into my room and collapsed from exhaustion.

When I awoke, I did not even have to check my hand, though I did out of habit at this point.

I closed my eyes and tried to calm myself, despite the confirmation I had seen, that meant I only had three days left.
