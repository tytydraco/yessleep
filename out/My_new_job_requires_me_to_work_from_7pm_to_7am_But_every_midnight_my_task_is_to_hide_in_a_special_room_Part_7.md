The sky is darker. My kids, my lovely kids. They no longer listen to anything. All that matters for them is the black room, or should I say me getting out of the black room. They spend their nights talking simultaneously about it, like some freaking possessed twins or whatever, they sleepwalk, they skip school, they no longer play, they no longer fear any threat or punishment, and my wife sometimes catch them staring at me when I sleep. I had to explain everything to her.

I will not say that enough: my wife does not believe in those kind of things. For her, it should rather be some kind of chemical acting on my mind and the children's, except on her because she may have a different or stronger organism. That is the kind of things she can and prefer to process because she is really not in any supernatural stuff. She plans to call the help of a psychologist.

Unlike some people, my supervisor never blamed me for breaking any of the rules. This is probably because he broke them himself in the past, which resulted in the scar he got. Instead, he asked me to meet him at work last Wednesday, and showed an outstanding level of compassion and empathy, scratching his head to find solutions to problems that never happened before with the entity.

Once again, I seized the opportunity to ask questions about the entity and the black room, but still bumped into a wall, as my supervisor refused to tell me more, pretending not to have the full picture. He kept on assuring me on that, knowing that I do not believe him, since he reads my posts, and promising me that he will share some useful tips about the job with me, just like in the past. 

Darker clouds gathered when I learned that my day shift counterpart had deserted the job without any explanation. Not believing that there was no reason, I attempted to trick my way into the black room as it is also the control room for all the cameras in order to look for any interesting footage. However, I was slapped with another rule, learning that even myself could not be in the black room during the day. I remember that even when I spent the whole day at the company after my blunder, I was only allowed to sit at the open space area, right from 07:30 am.

As seeking for answers was not against any rule, I pulled informations out of several employees who did not know what exactly happened with my day shift counterpart, except for the fact that he just ran outside and never came back. On the same occasion, I gathered a few more information about the different kinds of baffling rules other employees have to follow in this institution: everyone except me shares the rule of not being around by 6:30 pm. Some could not use specific bathrooms at specific times, there is even one who has the obligation of arriving over thirty minutes late every workday.

On Thursday, when my shift started, my first personal objective was to finally see the camera recordings. Either by negligence or by complete indifference, nothing about the past days was altered or erased, allowing me to set my eyes on more horror.

The day my colleague abandoned the job, I could see him making his way back to the entrance of the building, passing the closed black room when something inside caught his attention. I could see him talking to someone inside the room, someone that seemed trapped while trying to open the door. My colleague tried to help but the door was locked. I then saw him nodding, as if receiving instructions from the 'person' inside before he rushed to the supervisor's office and then came back to the black room with the keys. He then opened the door, stood there for a few seconds and looking inside, apparently surprised of not seeing anyone before he quickly closed the door and locking it back. He stepped backwards in fear then took off running and that was the last time he has ever been seen in the facility.

Minutes later on the footage, I saw my supervisor arrive at the entrance and one of the employees around apparently notified him about my colleague running outside. The supervisor ran to his office, then to the black room, and screamed in frustration the moment he saw the keys still on the door. He chased the people who followed him away, then seemed to talk to himself in front of the door. Afterwards, he unlocked it, blindfolded himself with a black cloth or something that he pulled out of his pocket and entered in the black room. It was around 2:26 pm. I kept on wondering what kind of creepy circus was on in this company?

At midnight, for the first time in the job, nothing happened. No creepy singing, no distortion, no apparition whatsoever and no threatening. I do not know what occasioned the day off, but I just enjoyed the tranquility, achieving a fifty minutes rest until it was 01:00 am.

The next day, there was almost war at home because I could not find my gloves and I was persuaded that the kids were the culprits. Despite searching for what seemed like decades my wife and I could not find even one of them. Therefore, I had to go to work without them, and especially, I no longer had a complete uniform or armor. If you have been reading attentively since the beginning, you know what this means.

Loadshedding was scheduled for midnight once again, and I spent the first minutes of the dreaded hour checking my surroundings in the pitch black room. Soon, the radio and the phone emitted static, testifying about the entity's presence. It did not say anything out loud or through the devices, it was not in the vent like that time, so it was probably right behind the door, silent and still, like a freaking creep. Meanwhile, though bracing myself for another terrible experience, I tried to relax, playing with one of my fancy flashlights and drowning myself in my thoughts.

Why do I call them fancy flashlights since the first posts? Some of you might be wondering. It is simply because they have extra lamps. I am not an expert in these things, but if I had to describe further just like now, well, let me say that those extra lamps emit different kinds of lights: neon, fluorescent, black light, UV or whatever they can be called. At first, I was playing around by switching it on and off in the normal and usual mode. However, at 12:51 am, I decided to try the other light modes, occasionally turning the room into a nightclub with the neon lights, but, when I switched to what I think is the UV mode, the room changed completely.

I saw traces on the wall I shined the light against, lines and curves strangely glowing in red, forming very crafty patterns that covered the black paint. I changed modes, from normal to neon and the patterns disappeared. I switched back to UV and they all reappeared. The patterns were everywhere in the room and emerged from five drawn figures, one on three of the walls, one on the floor and one on the ceiling. They looked like men, with two arms and two legs, but with mangled faces and they held bizarre and uncomfortable positions. Their bodies seemed covered with paints and ceremonial robes on top. Several tribal looking masks replaced each of the monitors and there was even a hidden door next to the cupboard.

One of the figures, drawn with its head turned on its left, seemed to look at the hidden door only visible with the UV light. I approached the figure, trying to get details about its mangled face. The iris of the figure moved as it looked at me. I gasped, jumped back and switched the flashlight to normal mode and made everything disappear. My heart racing, my forehead streaming with sweat at that point, I trembled with the device between my hands before trying the UV mode again. All the five figures, in full flesh I presume, were off the walls, ceiling and floor, and then standing on my right. I only caught a glimpse of them, and could not even hold the flashlight as I ran to the main door, forgetting about the entity that waited for me on the other side.

The moment I unlocked it, the entity violently pushed the door open and made me fall on the ground as I closed my eyes in pain and fear. I could feel its light through my closed eyes and only heard all of them roaring. Whether they screamed at me or at each other, I do not know. It only lasted a few seconds before they disappear at the exact moment the electricity came back on, of course, 01:00 am. I opened my eyes, and looked at the flashlight, still in UV mode, but no longer revealing any hidden thing under the illumination of the lit corridor and the lit light bulb on the ceiling. Still on the floor, the loud noise of the thunder outside then startled me as a storm raged on the city.

I was ready. I was finally ready to run and not look back just like my colleague. Whether in or out of the black room, I do not see any safety or sanity there for me. I am about to leave this job. The company and my supervisor? They can come for me for all I care, but they better play their cards right or I 'might' officially expose them with names and locations. I will keep you updated on everything that will unfold, you know, something tells me that leaving will not be that easy. This is not the last time we will hear about the black room. Until next time on Wednesday, stay safe. This world is crazy.
