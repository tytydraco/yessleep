**Part 1:**  


Okay, so, I don’t usually post stuff like this, but I’ve been feeling... off. Shaken. Honestly, I haven’t been able to sleep since last night, and I’m hoping someone here might have some insight. Or maybe I just need to get this out and make sense of it for myself.  


I’m 38, married to a great guy, two wonderful kids. Our life is exactly the kind of life you picture when you think of "stable." Car with carseats in the driveway, playground trips, preschool paintings on the fridge, the whole thing. My husband and I, we’ve been at this for over a decade now, and while life is chaos (kids, right?), we’ve always been on the same page. Our house feels warm, safe—homey, even. Or it did.  


Last night, something shifted.  


It started like any normal bedtime routine. My youngest, Mia, is 4—full of life, always asking a million questions. I love that about her. Who am I kidding, it also drives me insane. But she keeps me grounded when everything else feels crazy. So I was getting her ready for bed, and we went through our usual routine—teeth brushed, Kitty Meow-Meow stuffed animal tucked in, nightlight on. Nothing unusual. I kissed her goodnight, and just as I was about to leave the room, she says, “Mom, when do I get to meet my real dad?”  


I froze. I think any mom would, right? It felt so *wrong*, out of nowhere. And to be clear, I’ve been with my husband for 10 years. He’s always been there, always the best dad. Mia loves him so much, so the words hit like a punch in the stomach.  


“Honey, what do you mean? Daddy’s right here,” I said, doing my best to keep my voice steady.  


She just shook her head. That look on her face—it wasn’t playful or confused. It was serious. “No, not him. My real dad. The one who watches us.”  


I can’t explain the chill that ran through me. I tried to brush it off at first, but there was something about the way she said it—so matter-of-fact, like this was a thing she had known for a long time. And that unsettled me more than the words themselves. It wasn’t like she was trying to make up a story. It was like she *believed* it. Deeply.  


I forced myself to smile. “Who watches us, Mia?”  


She didn’t blink. “He watches us when we sleep. He’s waiting to talk to me.”  


I stood there longer than I should have. I didn’t say anything because I genuinely didn’t know how to react. This wasn’t her usual playful chatter. It felt different—like she wasn’t imagining something, but repeating something she'd *learned*. My heart started racing, and I felt this sinking feeling, like there was something going on that I hadn’t seen before. Some detail I’d missed. Maybe it was her tone—calm, assured—like she was trying to tell me a fact.

  
I left her room, and it was like my body moved on its own. By the time I got to the living room, my hands were shaking. I sat down, trying to breathe, but I just kept hearing her words over and over. “He watches us when we sleep.” My husband noticed right away and asked what was wrong, but I couldn’t even bring myself to tell him at first. I couldn’t figure out if I was overreacting or if there was a genuine reason to be worried.  


When I finally told him, I expected him to laugh, but he didn’t. He just sat there, staring at me, looking almost as confused as I felt. We didn’t say much after that. Just sat there, silent, both replaying her words in our heads, letting the strangeness sink in.  


I don’t believe in ghosts or anything supernatural, but the way she said it… I don’t know. It’s messing with me. I’ve been up all night, staring at the baby monitor, terrified of seeing something—anything—out of the ordinary. I don’t know why this is getting to me so badly, but it is.  


I’m scared to ask Mia more about it, honestly. What if she says something worse? Or, what if this is all in my head and I’m making a big deal out of nothing? I don’t know. I’ve never felt like this before, not about anything.

  
Has anyone else ever had their kid say something like this? Please tell me I’m not overthinking this.

  
**Part 2:**

I wasn’t planning on posting a follow-up. Honestly, I thought maybe I’d let this sit, give it a few days, and convince myself it was just some bizarre, random thing. But no. It’s not going away, and I’m starting to think that maybe I can’t just brush this off.  


The morning after Mia dropped that bombshell on me, I tried to move on. You know how it is, right? Kids say strange things, then forget all about them. So, I thought maybe it was best to just let it fade away. But this morning at breakfast, she said it again.

  
My husband and I were sitting at the table, exhausted as usual, shoveling cereal into the kids before the day started. Mia came down the stairs in her usual way, half-asleep, dragging that damn bunny by one ear. She sat down, grabbed her spoon, and looked right at me.  


“Mom, he’s upset.”

  
I swear, my blood ran cold. I dropped the spoon I was holding, milk splashing everywhere, and just stared at her.  


“Who’s upset, sweetie?” I asked, my voice sounding way too small in that big, silent kitchen.  


She blinked, almost like she was irritated that I hadn’t caught on yet. “My real dad. He’s upset because you don’t believe me.”

  
The room felt wrong, like the air was too thick to breathe. I looked at my husband, but he wasn’t any better off than me. His face was drained of color, his hands frozen mid-bite. I was hoping he’d say something, break the spell, but he was as scared as I was.  


“He says he’s been waiting to talk to you too,” she continued, her voice soft but steady. “But you’re too scared. He doesn’t want you to be scared, Mom.”  


I could barely get through the rest of the day. Every time I looked at Mia, it felt like I didn’t know her anymore, like she was somehow *different*. And now, here I am again, sitting on the couch, staring at the baby monitor, too terrified to go to bed.  


What would you do? Because I’m at a complete loss. I’m afraid of what I’ll find if I ask her any more questions, but I’m even more terrified of what might happen if I don’t.
