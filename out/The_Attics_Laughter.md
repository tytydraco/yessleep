In the quaint town of Millbury, where the autumn leaves danced in the crisp air, a young girl named Lily moved into an old, creaking house that had been abandoned for years. The locals whispered about the house, spinning tales of its haunted past, but Lily was oblivious to the stories. She was drawn to the place, its peeling wallpaper, and the way the sunlight filtered through the dusty windows, casting ethereal shapes on the floor.

But in the attic, three clowns lurked—remnants of a forgotten carnival, twisted by time and tragedy. They were grotesque figures, their faces marred by decay and neglect. One was a hobo clown with a tattered top hat, another a jester with a permanently frozen grin, and the third a sad-faced clown whose eyes had long since been chewed away by rats. They were missing fingers, teeth, and limbs, remnants of a life spent in the shadows of the attic, waiting for the right moment to strike.

Every night, as the moon hung high and the world fell silent, the clowns would descend from the attic, their laughter echoing softly in the dark. They would gather around Lily’s bed, their grotesque forms illuminated by the faint glow of the streetlight filtering through her window. They watched her sleep, their curiosity mingling with a sinister purpose. They were drawn to her innocence, her youth, and the promise of the sacrifice they had been waiting for—every twenty years, an offering to the evil clown god who demanded young girls.

Lily often heard the strange noises from the attic—creaks and whispers that she dismissed as the house settling or the HVAC system groaning. But deep down, a nagging curiosity tugged at her. What lay hidden in the attic? She often imagined it was filled with treasures or perhaps remnants of the former occupants. But the thought of climbing those rickety stairs filled her with dread.

In the stillness of the night, the wind would howl outside, a mournful wail that sent shivers down her spine. It would whip against the walls of the house, creating an eerie symphony of sound that echoed through the empty rooms. The drafty wind would seep through the cracks in the old windows, carrying with it the scent of damp wood and decay, mixing with the stale air of the attic. It was a chilling reminder that the house, though silent, was never truly empty.

One fateful night, the clowns grew restless. They were tired of waiting, tired of being ignored. They wanted her to come to them, to willingly ascend the stairs and join them in their dark ritual. As Lily slept, they whispered among themselves, their voices a cacophony of raspy tones and maniacal giggles. They plotted, their twisted minds weaving a plan that would lure her into their clutches.

The following evening, Lily, emboldened by a mix of curiosity and the thrill of the unknown, decided to confront her fears. She climbed the stairs to the attic, her heart racing. The air grew colder, and the shadows seemed to stretch and twist around her. As she reached the top, the door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit space filled with dusty relics and cobwebs.

Suddenly, the clowns emerged from the darkness, their eyes gleaming with a malevolent hunger. “Welcome, dear Lily,” they croaked in unison, their voices a haunting melody. “We’ve been waiting for you.”

Lily’s heart raced as she realized the truth. The tales of the house weren’t just stories; they were warnings. She turned to flee, but the clowns blocked her path, their grotesque forms closing in. “Don’t be afraid,” the hobo clown rasped, his breath a foul mix of decay and desperation. “Join us. It’s your time.”


Panic surged through Lily as she backed away, her mind racing. She remembered the local legends—the sacrifices, the evil clown god, the twenty-year cycle. It was all real, and she was the chosen one. She had to escape.

With a burst of adrenaline, she dashed past the clowns, her feet pounding against the wooden floor as she raced down the stairs. But as she reached the bottom, she felt a cold hand grasp her ankle, pulling her back. She fell, the world spinning around her as she struggled against the grip.

“Don’t fight it, Lily!” the sad-faced clown cried, his voice a mix of sorrow and glee. “You belong to us now!”

Just as they began to drag her back towards the attic, Lily spotted something glinting in the moonlight—a shard of broken glass from a nearby window. With a desperate lunge, she grabbed it and slashed at the clown’s hand, breaking free from their grasp. She stumbled to her feet and bolted for the front door.

But as she reached for the doorknob, it wouldn’t budge. Panic seized her as she turned to face the clowns, who were now standing in a line, blocking her escape. Their laughter filled the air, a haunting melody that echoed through the house.

“Every twenty years, a girl is chosen,” the jester clown said, his grin wide and unsettling. “And you are our prize.”

Just then, the lights flickered, and the house groaned as if it were alive, the walls closing in around her. 

Lily’s breath quickened...
