OK, this is going to sound incredibly strange. I'm quite literally typing this on my ancient iPhone 6 on the top deck of the N250 in hopes that someone can learn something or clue me in about the anomaly I just witnessed.

I chose Reddit to post this because (and take no offence) you guys would care less than the average person in my contacts but more than the police if I try contacting them (genuinely, the Met Police these days are useless and it's a war crime that we still have to pay council tax for them but that's a whole different discussion). I want this to be something people know about, a faint note of warning or of interest in a deep corner of the Internet, but not something people swarm to. Because it's when people swarm to stuff like this that people get hurt.

Anyway, I'll start with what happened this evening, and I really don't expect to make sense of it anytime soon.

The first thing to note is that my name is Eric and I'm 31. I live in a medium-sized flat and that's about everything you need to know about my personal life.

Second thing is that I'm a journalist. Which means life is.. *conditional*. How much I earn depends on how dramatic life in the South of London is, which is unfortunate for me as nothing really happens down here. You see, contrary to the swarm of Grade I and Grade II listed buildings of central London, this part of the city is a cluster of high-rise blocky flats and claustrophobic Edwardian-era red-brick housing and an assortment of corner shops and kebab shops and barber shops, half of which probably double as money laundering fronts by night. Essentially, it's not an exactly interesting place.

There is no political drama, no protests, no strikes, no scandals, nothing worth noting about this place. Most of the time I am plucking out the best I can write from the endless grey smudge life out here has been reduced to.

Anyway, long depressing monologue aside, we can talk about the Sharif family. If you ever have the oddly specific experience of seeing a green or blue or red sports car plowing its way down the various highways of an impoverished part of South London known as Croydon with the roof down while blasting phonk remixes in the middle of the night when there is no traffic, chances are it belongs to one of the Sharif boys. They aren't exactly on the front cover of every news article but enough people in Croydon know about them to solidify them as an ever-present criminal syndicate. Kind of like the mobs you see in those American gangster movies.

It was around 6PM, having left the confines of the office, that I made my way to the police office in the South of Croydon, which by all measures is the better part of the town. They were interested in giving me information about the Sharif boys, which was certainly a first. I arrived there at precisely 7.59. The police officer there, a big ginger man calling himself DI Marcus, filled me in on what they know.

"The Sharifs are some tough bastards for sure," he began. "The whole family migrated here from Islamabad in late 2016. Three years later, we believe a massive turf war broke out between them and one of the local juvy gangs. Four homicides. Some witnesses identified this guy, Faraan Sharif, as the perp but we couldn't get him. And we've had no evidence against them since then. But that changes today!"

"Yesterday we got a report of 3 passports being found in a plastic bag roughly here," he continued, pointing to a large map of Croydon laid out on a desk, specifically at a back alley labelled Overton Yard. "2 of them had a picture of the same man, but with different names - Akshay Saha in one and Yakub Sharif in the other." Apparently Yakub Sharif was someone they'd dealt with before for theft and he'd got community service for that, so long story short, the guy was clearly a fraudster. Which was what I would get to write my article all about.

"So where is he then?" I replied, almost expecting them to already have him in handcuffs in the other room. Marcus told me they were waiting for him to return to the passports and that's when they'd take him by surprise and arrest him. He offered to let me see their operation at Overton Yard, and we boarded his BMW police car and he drove us to the alley.

The static of the police radio interrupted the silence and then that too was interrupted by a man on the end of the other line. "We found the target passing through Surrey Street, he's about to make a right turn."

I listened as the men continued their conversation, awaiting gratification.

"Target is approaching the object," the voice on the radio affirmed, before stating confidently, "Target is in possession of the object. He is rummaging through the bag."

Marcus hastily replied, "Have you got this on video?" before the other officer affirmed this and the radio cut.

"We got him," Marcus informed me. "We'll squeeze whatever we can from the wanker for your story." There was the gratification.

We pulled up to the confluence between Surrey Street and Overton Yard. The place looks very dingy, especially at this time of night. I remember the time was exactly 8.41 from the clock in Marcus' car. Surrey Street is typically full of market stalls owned by half-toothless people selling vegetables and fruit and clothing and whatever else. Honestly the place seems as if it was warped from 300 years ago to the present day. Not just that but the place is surrounded by the backsides of various brutalist buildings - the things you'll see are the unused fire escape behind a movie theatre, the trio of dumpsters behind a shopping centre full of bakeries and sandwich shops and supermarkets and the occasional drunk, or more frequently druggie, loitering and singing like a lunatic.

At this time of night the market stalls have packed up their things and gone home, and the street is occupied only by the stench of something I don't want to think about. And then, hiding itself behind the mess of all of this, is Overton Yard. The kind of back alley that feels like some corporation tried using it to deliver shipments but ultimately decided it was a liability and left it be. It's the kind of back alley where you might find fresh red liquid on the ground and you'd be left to wonder whether some idiot spilt their tomato ketchup from their McDonalds meal they got at one of the five locations in the area or some even bigger idiot got into trouble with one of the gangs and had to experience the body of a Rambo knife.

We squinted from the BMW down the narrow sleeve of this alley, and in the distance, where the light was harshest and most minimal, there were four men lying on top of each other.

I immediately had a dirty thought and then rubbed it off. "Is that Yakub down there?" I hesitantly asked DI Marcus.

He looked concerned but unabashedly opened the car door and said, "We'll see."

I got out as well and watched, gradually following him as our view of this place got clearer. The face was clearly the same as the picture Marcus had shown me earlier that day. But as for the other three men, I presumed one of them was the guy we'd just heard from. Marcus crouched down as I observed from afar and held his finger on one of these men's necks. He looked back and solemnly shook his head. At once I understood that these guys were dead.

Marcus returned and shouted, perplexed, holding his hand on his sweating forehead, "What the fuck?!". I was going to try to get him to calm down but he went on, "No bullet wounds, no knife wounds, nothing. They're just *dead*."

I said, "I guess it's fine if we don't publish this," thinking it was some sort of consolation, before I silently chastised myself for saying something so foolish and insensitive.

Marcus stopped fuming with anger and pulled out his police radio and reported to the police station, "We've got a triple homicide at the passport location. I need backup." before awaiting a response. No response came. He examined the useless plastic thing and exclaimed, "No bloody battery!". He tossed it into the smiling darkness of the alleyway.

I passed him a bottle of water from his car and he accepted it and thanked me, sitting on the side of the road and hanging his head in grief or shame or whatever. He then marched back into Overton Yard to retrieve his walkie-talkie.

And this was the anomaly that I witnessed.

The time was exactly 8.55. Marcus' stride suddenly looked much less natural, and by that I mean the way he was walking looked different to how I'd seen him walk for the last hour. The way he turned back to face me also looked different. His facial expression looked different. It almost looked as if someone else entirely was staring back at me. I heard a faint whistle eminate from his mouth, a tune I was not familiar with at all but sounded oddly comforting, before he fell to his knees right next to the stack of dead people, and collapsed onto the ground. And when that happened the whistle immediately came to an abrupt suicidal end.

I was horrified to say the least. I ran down Surrey Street as quick as I could. I wasn't going in any particular direction, just away from whatever I just witnessed.

There was clearly some sort of logic to *that*. There had to be. I tried to formulate and calculate what that logic was.

If you go too close to the bodies, you too will become a body.

But I was close to the bodies. I saw them clear as day. The pile of 4 bodies turn into a pile of 5 bodies. That image was stained onto my retina and it would not dissolve away.

It was mortifyingly non-graphic. It wasn't the grainy CCTV videos of soldiers continents away being riddled with bulletholes that I was accustomed to reporting on - it was a real guy that I had seen and heard and joked with. It was a real guy who gave me the first nice car ride I'd experienced in months.

And then the whistle echoed through me. I didn't just hear it endlessly looping like a broken cassette tape, I could feel its exact vibrations in my skin and in my blood. And then I had the chilling thought of if I was singing that tune right now and if I was next.

And while I had this thought, I looked right and was blinded by the white light of a charging tram and deafened by its bell. I don't know how conscious I was as my arm was grabbed and yanked out of the way.

It was a woman, an old woman probably above 60. "You alright?" she asked me quite calmly and I shakily nodded in response, not able to say anything. After a few seconds of glancing me up and down she smiled and turned to walk off down Surrey Street. I got up and exclaimed, "Please do not go down there!" repeatedly and eventually I saw her, clearly frustrated, cave into my demand and walk in a different direction. She gave me a dirty eye as she passed me and muttered something.

As my heart pounded in decreasingly intense motions, I walked through the shopping centre to get to the bus stop. The place was still open as it really wasn't that late (around 9.32), but nobody was there and most if not all of the shops were closed. Not because it was night but because the place is heavily underfunded and the pandemic really did it damage. The main hall was strikingly bright as nobody wanted to turn the lights off and littered with wet floor signs.

These were the things I tried to think about, returning to my complaining ordinary British self, to drown the wave of thoughts of the anomaly - and as a side note, this is where I first decided to call it "The Anomaly". But this wave was too large, and inevitably I ended up storming my own head with a multitude of different questions.

What the fuck did I see?  
Who the fuck killed them?  
Why the fuck did they just die?  
How were they made to drop dead with no injury?  
What was the song that guy was humming?  
Were they under psychosis?  
Am I being pranked? By the useless Met Police bobbies?  
Or am I fucking crazy? Am I psychotic right now? Am I on some acid drug or something?

"You're not crazy. And there is no prank."

That voice was real. I turned and saw a bloke, a white man with black hair and a pronounced moustache in a T-shirt and jeans. He was mopping the floor of this hall and calmly turned to face me.

"My name's Eddie," he said to me. He had a strong Chicago accent which was weird because you don't ever see Americans in Croydon, especially not working jobs like this one.

"How do you know about it?" I fearfully probed. Instantly I knew, without a doubt, that he must have been involved in killing them.

He groaned as if in disgust and said, "I didn't kill them," reading my thoughts for a second time. "But we need to talk. Like, right now."

This 'Eddie' fellow began to approach me, incredibly slowly, and I backed off and ran through a hallway as he and his riveting voice followed behind. "Hey, I only want to talk. Look at me, I got no weapons or anything. Come back!"

The hallway felt unusually long. It kept drawing itself out as if forcing me to turn back and face him. As I slowed down, becoming more and more out of breath, the bright white-yellow light flickered, before erratically switching on and off as if a child had gotten into the electrical control room. I looked back, expecting to see a demon stretching itself out to consume me, but all I saw was the same man approaching me. "Jesus, you're fast," he said. I wasn't all that fast.

"What do you want?" I asked him.

He looked at me, then replied, "I want to make a deal. You're a journalist, right?"

I nodded.

"OK. What I want from you is to not put this in the media. What you saw earlier, that is."

"Why should I listen to you then?" I defiantly spat back at him.

He muttered something before replying, "We had a malfunction in the system. An anomaly, as you're calling it. I can't allow you to tell other people of it. So it's either I don't trust you and I sacrifice the rest of your life right here, right now, or I do trust you and you zip it for the rest of your life and you get to keep the rest of your life. What's it gonna be, pal?"

Knowing what this man could do I complied.

"Good. You fear me," he smiled as he held my arms. "Do you, Eric Lawson, wish to make the years of your life liable in the event you speak information about the events of this night?"

"Yes," I agreed.

"Good," he smiled again, before he returned to his mop and began whistling as he cleaned. It was the exact same whistle.

I was overcome with a visceral reaction to it and ran down another set of corridors before I felt myself skid off the ground and into the air and fall back onto the ground and land on my back in a wet patch of the floor. And as I landed I couldn't help but feel the same sharp thud of DI Marcus falling flat on the ground.

I got up and booked it out of there and to the first bus stop I could find. I got on the first bus that came, the N250 (a common night route), and I went straight to the top deck, which was completely empty. The time was 10.07 when I began writing this.

Now, I should mention that when I got to the bit about the pile of four men lying on top of each other, something even weirder happened. These buses have a voice system where there's a fairly robotic female voice that announces the next stop and says messages like "Please move down and use every seat" or "The driver has been told to wait at this bus stop". Then I heard her say something I'd never heard on any bus before.

"Eric Lawson. This action will remove 3 months. You have been warned."

My first thought was: fuck you, Eddie. My second thought was: is this even worth doing now? If I post this I lose 3 months of my life. That sounds oddly significant. What if I'm supposed to die in 2 months from now? Do I just drop dead right here?

But that made no sense to me. Who's dictating how long I live for in the first place? And why should I trust Eddie after he threatened me like that?

Then I thought, if I have a good 40 or 50 years ahead of me, why should 3 months matter? It's very worth it if other people know of this. I've decided now that I'm going to take a risk and post this. I'm going to try to figure out what the hell kind of supernatural or paranormal bonkers are going on around here and I'll probably make another entry in this "log" of sorts tomorrow if I survive pressing post (which I probably will). So wish me luck and I'll see you guys then!
