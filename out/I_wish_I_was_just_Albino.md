I have always been pale, like milk-white pale. The only color that peaked through my skin was the red and blue veins that webbed under my skin. It wasn't just my white skin; my hair was a slick light silver, and I had nearly wholly pinkish-red eyes. I also still had a few of my baby teeth. The teeth that were too small for my growing head made me look like a ghoul. I was picked on for it quite a lot.

So much so that most of my teachers at the revolving door of schools I went to never let me go outside during recess because the bullying was so rampant. I never complained, though; I hated recess. One school in Iowa when I was thirteen was the worst of all; we had the worst of all seasons. Most days, it was too cold. Ms. Morse worried I'd get hypothermia for the second time that year despite my cheap black sweatshirt doing its best. I didn't have enough muscle for shivering to work its natural function. On top of thinking I was albino, they also thought I was anemic. I don't blame them either. At first, I believed it, too; who would ever think they were monsters? During other recesses near the start of the school year and the springtime, it was way too sunny, and I'd still be wearing my sweatshirt. It would draw in the sun rather than help repel it, so I just hugged the walls to stay in the shade. This caused some more alienation from my new classmates and made me an easy target for name-calling. Since I couldn't stand up for myself, it came to the sixty-eight-year-old Ms. Morse to defend me. So she pulled me from recess.

This gave me much-needed time to get the extra help on my assignments. I am struggling not only socially with my peers, but I also was failing academically. Which isolated me even more. I was nodding off almost every day in class; I couldn't stay awake. I was missing lessons daily. It took me over a month to finally connect that the George Washington that we had been talking about all month was not the president. Instead, he was a peanut guy. 

Ms. Morse was determined to assist me in any way necessary. When she wasn't on recess duty, she was in the classroom with me, personally tutoring me in every subject. In Ambergrain, population 402, Ms. Morse was the solitary fifth-grade teacher, so she was forced to be the master in all of the curriculum. She was putting in the work that I wasn't, but I was passing. Or at least doing well enough that they never had to call "home." I also didn't care enough to try; this was my second try at fifth grade, and I knew we would move within a year. Small towns notice when people go missing and missing people follow us everywhere. 

As much as school sucked, it was better than home. After school, I had a three-mile walk to get home. Once I turned left on Huxley Court, It was 2.8 miles straight of lonely strolling on a gravel road beat down by the sun on every step. There are no trees for shade or speeding cars to offer a sliver of fleeting darkness. Eventually, coming to our "house." It could barely be considered one; we never paid for it. We were squatters, and whoever owned the place would never have cared that we were staying there anyway. The place looked like shit. At one point, it might've been a mighty fine trailer home, but it was far beyond its glory days. There were holes in the walls from what looked like shotgun blasts; the stairs to the door were now a pile of loose lumber on the ground, a roof that had caved in, various animal dwellings scattered on lights, and fallen gutters. Our beat-up Chevrolet Citation sat rusted out halfway into the ditch in front. Beer cans and bottles were scattered throughout the yard; you would have been lucky to find one that was fully intact. Not exactly the pinnacle of luxury, but it was home, for now.

When I got home from school, I would not be greeted by anyone at all. It was just the silence and stench of the place. There was only a kitchen and living room because the roof had collapsed over the rest of the trailer. The carpet had so many stains that it almost looked like a watercolor piece. The kitchen was godless and organized without reason. There was no space for much because the cabinets had either fallen down or their bottom had rotted out, so nothing could be stored there. The living room was the worst of all; trash scattered the floor, and the stains got worse. They darken as they get closer to the couch. The stains were the darkest under where he slept. The layers of curtains were pinned into the wall because the rod broke, letting in no light from the shattered window. The one couch was torn on the cushions and armrests, spewing foam out and onto the floor when you moved while on it. My uncle was lying on the sofa, covered in our one blanket. Looking back on this now, it's hard to believe I ever thought that he was my uncle. And at this point, he certainly wasn't my guardian. 

While he would sleep, I had to clean up his mess. As per usual, he hadn't done me any favors. He had grabbed a black trash bag for me, at least, an uncommon courtesy. He didn't even wash his face. I never wanted to be like him. I went out back to find the scraps, dried out and stiff, sitting where they usually are each afternoon. I picked up the leftovers and threw them in the bag. I then dragged the bag to the makeshift fire pit and tossed it in. The pit was getting pretty full, we would probably need to light it up within the week. If he keeps getting lucky, that is.

 He worked nights at the gas station since we first arrived in Ambergrain. He lucked out because they were so desperate for people to work the graveyard shift that there was almost no paperwork. So the Social Security Card he got didn't even matter. It was registered under a different name anyway. He even got paid in cash. Made it even simpler. No cameras either, it's like they were begging for it. From there, he would find the runaways, homeless, drifters, etc., anybody who came in and wouldn't be missed. It was the easiest he had ever had. At nights, when he came home with a bloody corner of his lips, soaked chin staining his bleached skin, he would try to spin wisdom on me as I curled up trying to ignore him. He would always talk about how smart he was, slurring each word. "Think about it, the people who go to gas stations at two to four in the morning. They're no one. Have you ever seen someone important in a gas station that late?" Then he babbles to himself and eventually leaves me alone.

After doing my "chores," I curled up in the living room corner and fell asleep. Most days, I'd wake up before sunrise and see him sleeping on the couch. We had some dry cereal on the cramped counter, which I grabbed a handful of as I walked out the door. Then I'd stroll all the way to the school and sit by the door in the shade until the sun rose or an equally early rising teacher would come and open the door for me. Most times, it was Ms. Morse. She was a very early riser. Which, unfortunately, was her downfall. 

About a week later, something was off when I arrived at the school. Ms. Morse's Mercury Lynx wasn't there. That wasn't too odd, because sometimes she graded paper before school and would roll up later, still before everyone else. But when later came, she didn't show. I was sitting there much later than I normally would be. The rising sun slowly shrunk the shadows around me, taking away my safety. Later, Principal Starley opened the doors for me, and even he was shocked at the absence of Ms. Morse. In her entire thirty-plus-year career, she had never not been the first to arrive or take a sick day. She was an employer's dream. On this day, she was her employer's nightmare. She had no spouse, no kids, no emergency contact. Mrs. Fergusen, the fourth-grade teacher, had to step in and teach fifth-grade as well. In the afternoon, when Mrs. Fergusen was taking us back a year, Principal Starley went to Ms. Morse's house and couldn't find her. Her car was in the driveway. When she didn't answer the door, the cops had to get involved. They searched the house, and she couldn't find anything. They did find the absence of some things, nothing expensive. She typically brought with her to school things like her black leather purse and her satchel, which is where she kept all the graded papers. She lived on the edge of town, nearly a block away from the gas station. The cops had no idea where she could be, but I did. 

When school ended that day, I began to walk home. I had to weave through the police interviews and squad cars from Wesley and Algona, neighboring towns. Avoiding eye contact so nobody would think I was a part of the incident, but I knew I was. In a way. There were more cars on the road on the way home that day. Granting me temporary respite from the sun's death rays more than I was used to. When I got back home, I opened the screen door to find him exactly where I knew he would be. Covered in sanguine fluid. I looked in the kitchen, he didn't even leave me a bag today. I went out back to find exactly what I dreaded. 

A black leather purse and a satchel stained with a splatter of red. Her head sat eviscerated nearly six feet away from the pile with a trail of blood leading to it, suggesting that it had rolled away after being discarded. The rest of the body was completely exsanguinated. Dry and stiff. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. My body refused. I didn't understand it. I should have been crying, but my eyes didn't even water. So I grabbed her carcass, her decapitated head, and dragged them to the pit. We would have to do the fire today.

I walked inside. I saw the blood of the only person who had ever respected dried around his lips. I never wanted to be like him, but I needed to be today. I tore down the curtains, and the rays burnt me, but they would hurt him more. The beams fell on his face, and his skin began to jump and bubble. He immediately shot up. He clutched his blistered skin, trying to block the beam with his hand, scarring it as he ran to the shade. His eyes fell on me. The curtains were still in my hand. The only thing stopping him was the ray of sunshine in between us. He looked at me, fuming, hate burning in his eyes. 

"They are looking for her," I said to explain myself. "We have to leave." He stared at me, silent. "I didn't know how else to wake you up." I somewhat lied; I wanted to do it, but it was also the easiest way I could think of to wake him up.

"Did you burn them?" he said, rubbing his face as puss squeezed through his fingers. I was hoping that it would have gotten him more. 

"Not yet; we should wait until the sun goes down. The smoke," I said, and he nodded.

"Then you could've waited to wake me up. The sun won't go down for at least an hour." He snarled.

"Sorry," I lied. "I'll start packing the car," I muttered as I walked through the beam, wincing. I grabbed what little we had in the kitchen and walked out to the car. Throwing it into the back seat.

Once the sun had set, we watched the fire grow, burning everything it touched. I stared at the satchel, slowly cracking and peeling. The flames revealed the papers inside. Between the flicks of fire, I saw mine at the top. I got a 12/12 with a note that said, "I'm so PROUD". That was the best grade that I had gotten all year. 

We watched until the blaze died and made sure there were no vestiges of what lives ended in our wake. We lit up what remained and buried the ashes and bones behind the house. Then we stepped into the car and kept driving north. This was the first step in my transformation. 

My incisors began to feel loose.
