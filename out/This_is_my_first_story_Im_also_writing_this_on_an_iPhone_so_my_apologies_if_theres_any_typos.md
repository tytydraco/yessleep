“January never ends” my little brother says to me as we bury our cat. Buddy was a fat orange and white tabby cat. Pathetic, but adorable and a very kind cat. 

“Yeah” I said with a tear in my eye
“When it rains it pours.”

There’s something about January and this time of year when stuff goes bad. Last year our parents got into a huge fight which ended up with cops showing up and arresting my dad. I’m supposed to see him in a couple days.

“Logan! Owen! Dinner!” My mom was making chili and hollered for us to come eat.

“Tell her I’m not hungry, I got some stuff to do anyway.” Owen’s eyes seemed to sink even more when I said I wasn’t eating.

“You can play fortnite after dinner b-“ I stopped myself “just go eat dude” I gave him a hug and told him not to think about buddy. I watched his coat flail in the wind as he ran back inside. I told mom it would be to big for him. I picked up the shovel and took one last look at buddy’s grave. “You were the best cat buddy” I said it as if he were still here. I walked to the garage and put the shovel back. “Ding” I pulled out my phone to see a message from Jake.

“Yo dude there’s a party going on tonight at Jerome’s if you wanna come.”
I do need a distraction I thought.
“I’ll be over in 20 min” my hands were almost shaking as I typed the message. Somethings off I thought. I’m never this worried about going to a party. I stepped out of the garage and stared across the street. There was a man standing in front of my neighbors house but something was off. He wasn’t walking or doing anything. Just standing on the street staring down at the pavement. He was wearing all black clothes and his face was ghost white but I never got a look at his eyes. I watched a squirrel run behind him and just as the squirrel came back into my line of sight, it dropped dead. Then the guy disappeared. Just vanished while I was fixated on the newly dead squirrel. This should’ve been my first sign to stay home that night. But I was ignorant. I grabbed my weed from my dads old tool box and went to jakes.

Walking was never my first choice but I promised mom I’d never take the car to a party. I got to jakes house and there wasn’t a single car in the driveway. 
“That’s odd” I thought. His mom usually goes to bed early so I can’t Imagine why she wouldn’t be there. I knocked on the door and waited a few minutes, no answer. I try calling Jake but he doesn’t pick up. At this point I’m starting to get worried so I just walk in and go upstairs to jakes room.

I found him unconscious on the floor with a bunch of crushed up oxys on his desk. I started giving cpr and dialed 911 when something out the window caught my attention. It was the same man from before except this time, I could see his eyes. His dark, lifeless, disgusting eyes. That was the last thing I saw before I felt my own eyes roll into the back of my head. Then I felt the thud as my body collapsed to the floor.

Something soft was brushing up against me. I opened my eyes and saw the familiar ball of fluff that I loved so much.
“Hey buddy” I said as I stroked his soft little head.
“I guess January truly never ends”
