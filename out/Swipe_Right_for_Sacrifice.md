I never thought a single swipe could be the biggest mistake of my life.

Hi, I am Rebecca. I teach 3rd grade, love old bookstores, and, against my better judgment, recently joined a dating app.

I was sitting on my couch, mindlessly scrolling through the profiles of several guys when I saw him. His name was Daniel. There was something about his eyes that drew me toward him, they were warm yet cold, inviting yet strange at the same time. Without thinking, I swiped right.

The screen lit up—we were a match.

He was the first one to text me. He said, *"Hi,"* and I replied to his message. Then he started complimenting me. The conversation went on, and eventually, he asked if I would like to have dinner with him at a restaurant.

I live alone and don’t like to go out with men this late at night, but I couldn’t resist him and against my instincts, agreed to his offer.

We met at the restaurant. He was even more handsome in person. It started great, but then I began noticing things. He was asking strange questions, like whether I lived alone, and he was very persuasive about it. I tried to brush it off, but suddenly, a chill ran down my spine.

The restaurant staff were behaving very strangely. The waiters were exchanging glances and whispering while looking at me. I then realized that **we were the only ones in the restaurant.**

I pointed it out to Daniel, but he brushed it off, saying it must be my imagination. But I knew something was definitely wrong.

I told him that I didn’t want to stay here and that we should go somewhere else. That’s when his attitude completely changed.

The staff **locked the restaurant door.**

Daniel stood up. He grabbed my hair and started dragging me toward a room. I screamed for help, but the staff were assisting him. That’s when I realized—they were in on it too. It was a setup.

Daniel opened the door and threw me into a room. The room was dimly lit, with a strange symbol in the center and candles at its sides. That’s when I looked up and saw a **huge painting of me** on the wall, where I was covered in bruises.

I turned back and saw Daniel and the waiters now wearing **black robes, chanting my name.**

I stood up and tried to run, but Daniel punched me. I fell to the ground and saw a man with a knife in his hand walking toward me.

The others grabbed me, and before I could react, the room went completely dark.

I felt an ***agonizing*** pain in my chest, my vision blurred as my scream echoed through the room… but then, somehow, my ***survival instincts*** kicked in.

I twisted, kicked, and managed to ***break free*** from their grip. I didn’t think—I just ***ran***. I sprinted through the dark hallway, my heart ***pounding*** as I heard their ***footsteps*** behind me. The restaurant door was still ***locked***, but in my panic, I rammed into a side window, shattering the glass as I tumbled outside.

I didn’t stop running. I don’t even know how long I ran. Now, I’m hiding in a ***dense forest***, my phone at ***2%***. If anyone reads this, ***please help me***. I don’t know if they’re still looking for me … but I think I can hear ***footsteps***.
