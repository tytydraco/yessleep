I need to preface this by saying I am currently Zoey [(V. 1,792).](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/HFIxkEmjy2)

I have been copied multiple times since my last post. It is currently 09/26/23.

I watched a lot of footage and I have little time, so I will be uploading in two parts. Today I will be uploading Nick’s tapes, and tomorrow will be Ben’s. 

Hopefully, soon after, I will be publishing my own and Allie’s.

I have to be quiet, though.

Our 'dad' is home soon.

…

I had to watch the tapes.

Regardless of wanting to, I needed to know what was going on with my family.

I needed to know why my bruises were disappearing—why I had replicas of myself replacing me growing up, and most importantly… the reason why my mother killed me only for me to come back hours later. Between my mother killing me and Ben, squeezing us to death and waking up the next morning, 101 versions of me had existed, and I had lost a whole night. I was no longer safe in the garage. Mom was following me around with a thermometer, convinced I was sick after my monumental freak-out at breakfast. That freak-out had been justified.

Monumental was pushing it, though Mom has always been dramatic.

I had a brother I didn’t know existed until he popped up out of nowhere at breakfast, and I was the crazy one? 

I was the only one who was questioning this random seventeen-year-old boy sitting at our breakfast table. 

Ben and Allie were already memeing it because of course they were. Ben had been suffocated along with me the night before by our psycho mother and didn’t remember a thing. He didn’t remember me mentioning his creepy replica laughing at us behind the door—or our mother screaming and tightening her hold around us, enough to pop our lungs and make me cough up blood. She killed both of us, and Ben was acting like nothing had happened, being his usual annoying self, trying to draw as much attention to himself as possible. 

More so, my brother didn’t have a printed number on his wrist. 

Neither did Allie, nor this apparent new sibling. 

So, I couldn’t record how many times they had been copied—by this unknown force that was somehow linked to the ancient tapes in our basement. I was determined to find out what was going on. I got a mouthful after breakfast when I was trying to sneak into the basement after being shooed up to my room by my mother. “If you’re sick, you will stay in your room,” she had told me sternly.

Which was Mom-speak for, “If you’re sick, go to your room so I can grab my camera equipment and make a Tik-Tok about you feeling under the weather.” I hadn’t forgotten when Allie got the flu, and Mom made a 6-part series detailing every step through her recovery. 

And I mean every step. 

It reached a point when my brother convinced Allie to fake being well enough to go to school to escape Mom’s camera. Ben greeted me on the way downstairs, smiling through a mouthful of toothpaste. His long-sleeved shirt was hiding his wrist, so I couldn’t see a number. It was frustrating that I couldn’t talk to him about the night before, because he had forgotten our mother had fucking killed him. I was still trying to understand the sudden appearance of his replica wearing his features. 

I could still remember the sight of it, a hollowed-out version of Ben with wide, maniacal eyes and a grinning mouth, a head of half-shaved hair, and blood staining that particular jacket. His smile wasn’t human. But I knew somehow that thing was still him. Just like the shadow girl wearing my face who replaced me at cheer practice the day before had somehow been me. The only thing I could discern from that version of him was the jacket. I had never seen him wear it. Ben’s expression was already alight with mischief. 

He hung upside down from the staircase railing. “Yo, so do you have severe memory loss, or..?”

“Go away.”

He smirked, already knowing he was under my skin. “How about a brain-eating disease?”

I couldn’t be bothered with dealing with my mind-wiped brother. “Go and wash your mouth out,” I told him, only for the second offender to join us. Ben and Allie are bad enough separately, but when they decide to come together, the two are insufferable with the same stupid sense of humor. 

Still, though, I had to act like nothing was wrong, so I played along, scanning both of them to see if they had been replaced.

Allie was freshly dressed, her hair in its usual bouncing ponytail. I checked her wrist. No sign of a number. “Did you have like, a total brain-blank this morning?” Her eyes were wide. I could tell both of them were ready to tear me apart. “You acted like that crazy airplane lady.”

“I’m telling you right now, that mother fucker back there is *not* real!” Ben mocked with a laugh, pointing towards the kitchen where the new sibling was, only for me to shoo him halfway back upstairs with a glare. The supposed new sibling chose that moment to appear, and my brother and sister were on him straight away like wild goddamn animals.

“Hey, so, who are you again, bro?” Ben swung over the staircase railing, his lips curled into a grin. “I have never seen you before in my life."

“Ben!”

Mom slid past our little intervention on the way to the kitchen, shooting him warning eyes. I found it had to believe she cared about his well-being after suffocating him to death the night before. I noticed she looked… scared. 

“What did I tell you about swinging on the staircase?”

Ben jumped down automatically. “Sorry, Mom.”

When she was gone, he resumed position with an eye-roll.

Immediately, the “Zoey is crazy” jokes continued. “He’s our long-lost brother who just appeared out of nowhere, remember?” Allie cackled.

Nick shot me a look. I had barely known him a little over an hour, and whoever this strange boy was—he was equally done with ‘our’ siblings. 

“Grow up, you cretin’s,” he grumbled to the two of them, nudging me. “I’m glad you remember my existence, Zoey,” he said, his words dripping with sarcasm. Nick didn’t say anything else, only grabbing my younger brother and dragging him upstairs, muttering about video games.

The others started getting ready for school, so I took my chance and descended back down the basement steps.  The temperature had always been cold, but this kind of cold was almost cruel, biting into the bare flesh of my arms and legs. I instantly regretted not wearing a jacket and sticking with my pajamas. The room looked almost otherworldly, bathed in warm morning sunlight filtering in through the tiny window. But there was something about it that turned my stomach. I had been here. Recently. 

And  I *didn’t remember.*

I could remember the sensations of this memory, but there was nothing to reach out to. I could recall the feeling of my bare soles slapping on the concrete stairs— and someone behind me, their frightened breath prickling the back of my neck. I remembered the feeling of my heaving chest and my whirring thoughts, a terror I could not justify or understand. 

Blinking in fraying sunlight was almost like it was waking me up from a long slumber I didn’t realize I had been in, I had a sudden, overwhelming urge to look down at my hands. They were itching. They felt filthy and wrong like I hadn’t bathed in days; my whole body felt like it was tainted and slick with something I could not see. I stared down at my hand, my stomach slowly crawling into my throat. 101 copies of my body and memories existed, and yet I only knew the version I was at that present moment.

If a version of me had come down to the basement in that lost time, I would find her memories soon enough. 

But first, I had to know who this so-called brother was, and why my siblings and I were being haunted by shadowy versions of ourselves. Don’t look around. The words formed in my head. *Eyes forward, Zoey.* I could feel the breath on my neck once more. *“Don’t break character,”* the voice was mine, and yet twisted and purged of emotion, a low murmur in my ear. I stared straight forward. 

*You know what happens if you break character, Zoey,* she hummed, her slimy finger poking at the back of my neck and tangling in my hair. I could sense my wandering gaze already flicking to my hands. *Do you remember me?*

I could hear it again. 

Ben’s sobbing reverberated from the walls, heavy gasps of breath and sniffling getting louder and louder until I couldn’t stand it.

*Don’t turn around.*

I was always told to ignore what was in the corner of my eye— by a phantom voice I had never noticed until it was whispering into my skull.

Ignoring it, I forced myself to focus. Sitting cross-legged on ice-cold concrete flooring in front of the ancient television, I slid the Nick. (V.1) tape into the machine. Nothing happened. I mean, the screen flickered a few times like it was trying to show me something before it went black. I tried it again, only for the same thing to happen. So, Nick. V.1 was a no-go. I went back into the box of tapes and pulled out another one with his name. Nick. (V.0.) This tape did work. 

I found myself staring into swimming galvanic blue before the screen switched to old footage of our backyard. Just like the tape with little me, it was filming the exact spot. **09/07/1999.** Compared to the footage of me, this was OLD. 

The film was jumping around everywhere, swimming in color before stabilizing itself between four flickering lines splitting the video. 

I could just about make out a small boy sitting on the same wall little me had sat. This kid was maybe five or six years old with dark brown hair and a grinning smile. It took me a moment to realize this video wasn’t muted like the tapes I had watched.

“Nicholas! Look over here!"

Mom’s voice crackled through the TV’s speakers, a blustery wind whipping her words away. “Say Hi to Mommy!” Her voice was gleeful, and I found myself transfixed by the small boy on the footage, kicking his legs and waving his arms. The camera zoomed in, and he shot another cheesy grin, waving wildly at the camera, kicking his legs. 

“Nick, can you show me your magic trick again?”

The tape went crazy, suddenly, the picture jumping up and down before settling. This time, though, it wasn't the 90's I was looking at.  Instead, I was looking at our couch, and a seventeen-year-old boy, his wrists tied behind his back. I recognized that same mess of dark brown curls. 

The same boy who had appeared in our kitchen, claiming to be my brother. Something warm erupted in my throat. 

A blanket was thrown over him, and I could see dark red seeping through, stemming through pastel blue material. 

This footage had no sound, but I swore déjà vu crept up on me like I had seen it before. Like I had been standing right there when it happened. 

I could imagine his breathy sobs and panicked cries, his muffled yelling. *See?* My own voice startled me, my shadow self once again standing behind me, breathing down my neck. I could see the curve of her in the corner of my eye. She didn’t have a face yet. 

There was only static, like she was somehow part of the VCR itself, her existence bleeding into view piece by piece, the more I noticed, the fuller she became. Until I could see the twist of her grinning smile. 

I forced myself to keep watching the screen. The tape snapped back to the old footage and the small boy did a shuffle dance, giggling. “Hi, Mommy!” He seemed entranced by something off-camera, and my Mom laughed. I could hear something rustling. “Can I have candy now?”

“If you do the magic trick, I’ll give you pudding too.”

His eyes widened. “Chocolate pudding?”

“Double chocolate,” Mom laughed. “But don’t tell the others.”

The boy’s expression seemed to crumple, and he stuck out his lip, his eyes wandering. “I don’t want to share with him,” he folded his arms. 

“It’s *my* special treat.”

Another boy with sandy blonde hair and a bright green raincoat jumped into the frame, waving to get Mom’s attention. I had a visceral reaction to seeing this boy, phantom crawlies filling my mouth and skittering up and down my spine. I could see so much of my brother in this kid, so why did I feel sick to my stomach? Why was my finger hovering over the pause button ready to stop it? “I want to be in a movie!” He stamped his feet. “It’s not fair!” He glared at the camera, wrinkling his nose. 

“Why does Nick always get to be in movies?"

“Ben, honey.” Mom spoke patiently. “Wait your turn. You’re all going to get a chance to be in the movie.” 

Her voice broke a little. “I’m just filming Nick’s magic trick.”

“But I can do a magic trick!” Ben whined. “Can you film me too?” He came right up to the lens, sticking his tongue out. “Please, please, please, pleassseeee!"

“In a second,” Mom sighed. “Sweetie, can you move to the side a little?" The camera jolted back to a frowning Nick. “I can’t get your brother in frame.”

“Fine!” Ben stomped off camera. I could still hear his voice through the whistling wind. “I don’t like you, anyway! You’re stupid!” He coughed, suddenly, and the camera swung back to him, almost panicked. Ben had his hands over his mouth. He scowled before swiping them on the front of his jacket. "You're mean for not watching my trick." He said, before stomping away and kicking a rock.

"Ben, you know what we do when we cough," Mom said. "Show me your hands." 

He did, running in frame and showing the palms of his hands.

"Okay, sweetie, you're good."

Ben marched off camera. “I’ll do my own magic tricks!”

I thought Mom was going to invite Ben to join them, but oddly, she turned her focus back to the other boy, completely ignoring my brother.

“Come on, Nick,” she said. “It’s just a small drop, and Mommy will catch you.”

"But it's scary," he mumbled. 

"I know you can do it, Nick."

The kid hesitated before slowly lowering him off the wall into an awkward leap. But I never saw him hit the ground before his body reverted back to its original position. 

I thought I had accidentally rewound the tape forwards but then he did it again, tipping backward off of the wall, and his body snapping back to seconds before. His whole form seemed to blur in and out of existence, flickering colors and lines enveloping him.  It wasn’t the tape that was rewinding, I realized, something sour creeping up my throat. It was Nick. Even weirder, both my mother and him were completely aware of what was going on. Nick was giggling, squealing when his body snapped backward like a magnet. I couldn't stop watching, my gut twisting. “I did it!”

He excitedly jumped to his feet, and I heard my Mom’s sharp intake of breath when his foot slipped and he tumbled off the wall, but he just rewound, quite literally, back to when he was sitting with his legs dangling. “You did!” Mom was equally excited. “I am so proud of you!”

“I can do it too!”

I saw a flash of Ben’s swinging arm. 

“Look, Mommy! I can do it better than him!"

The sudden sound of something popping, of flesh ripping apart, made my stomach churn. I had to swallow down a bout of barf trying to wrangle its way into my mouth. 

The footage jumped around and I had no idea what was happening. 

All I could see was Nick’s face slowly twisting from excitement into horror, his eyes widening. Then, in a sudden cut, his face was splattered with dripping red, and he was screaming. It was almost like the tape itself was trying to hide what had happened. It flicked forward and backward, back to Nick jumping off the wall, and then to Ben’s grinning face. Before snapping back to my mom’s unearthly screams and the camera falling to the ground. I could glimpse a glistening scarlet painting the concrete pathway. 

*“Ben?"* Mom was speaking through sharp breaths. I could hear her stumbling footsteps. Nick jumped off of the wall, and her breath caught. 

“No. No, go inside right now,” her voice shook, hysteria slowly creeping in. “Do you hear me? Go inside!”

“But Mommy,” Nick whimpered. “Where did Ben go?"

I could hear the turmoil, the agony, in her cry. “I don’t know! I don’t… I just… just go inside and shut the door and do not come out!”

The sound of shuffling footsteps faded down the path, and the camera showed nothing but a patch of bleeding red pooling across rough concrete.

This time the footage jumped to **09/10/1999.** Mom was filming the back wall again. But this time there was no Nick. She stood for a few seconds filming the wall, and then slowly walked through the back entrance into our house. The footage this time was grainy and drained of color, flicking back and forth between dull color and black and white. She filmed the lounge which was filled with toys and rotting food on plates, flies buzzing around. Then she went to the kitchen, panning around the dirty dishes and the faucet, takeout cartons, and beer bottles.

It was almost like the soul had been ripped from the tape itself.

The house was silent. I could hear nothing but Mom’s shuddery breaths behind the camera. When she stumbled back out into our yard, I noticed the blood was still there, stained and ingrained into the concrete. Mom stood in the exact spot and zoomed straight onto the wall, where Nick had previously sat. 

The camera shook. “Let’s all take a photo,” her voice was a dull murmur, the film trembling with her hands. 

“Come on, everyone,” she said. “Everyone on to the wall, so we can all take one last photo for Mommy.” 

Her laugh made me wince, shuffling away from the speakers. “Ben, stop teasing your brother,” she zoomed in on thin air, giggling to herself. The camera snapped to the end of the wall. “Allison, stand next to your sister. Hold her hand. Yes,” she hummed. “I want all twelve of you to give me a big smile."

Thankfully, the camera jumped ahead once again.

**10/15/1999**

Mom was still standing in the exact same spot, filming the wall. I could see the season had changed around her, our backyard was filled with fall leaves. I did glimpse one detail that was out of place. The ground in the yard next to the wall looked to be uneven, all of the flowers dug up. The random patch of soil looked out of place. When the tape switched to another more modern setting, I almost jumped back. It’s like this tape was taking me backward and forward in time.

I found myself looking at Ben.

Seventeen-year-old Ben. The brother I knew presently. 

The film did not look like it belonged on this tape, more like it had been spliced together with the footage I was watching on Nick’s tape. The colors were too bright. I didn’t recognize the room he was sitting in. It was dark, barely lit by a flittering bulb above casting his face in a sickly light. 

He was sitting at a small table in a rickety wooden chair, slumped back with his arms folded, his gaze glued to the camera. This wasn’t recent. Ben looked maybe a year or two younger, though what I did recognize was that same hollowed-out look in his eye, the exact one I had seen on his replica. 

This Ben both looked like my brother and didn’t. His hair, oddly, was a different color, a more reddish tone. He looked dishevelled, strands of hair sticking up everywhere, a blue and gold football jersey hanging off his shoulders. Ben did not play football. In his words, “It’s a sport for people who are bored” and he only came to see me cheer if there was free food. 

I noticed smeared red on his collar, and already, I wanted to turn it off. Something stopped me, however. Because maybe I was insane, but I could have sworn my brother looked… dated. His hairstyle, all the way down to the way he was dressed, was severely dated, despite the modern setting lit up around him.  “Sit up straight,” the cold voice on the other end of the camera was my mother, and he ignored her, his head lolling, lips growing into a grin and then crumpling into a cry.  “I want you to tell me your name, " she said cooly. 

It took me a moment to understand my brother’s eyes were staring right through the lens. He cocked his head, and it was almost inhuman the way he moved, just like little Nick on the wall, his head blurring in and out of view. His body arched back, lips carving into  pained cry. 

I don’t think he could control whatever this thing was. When his body had stabilized, my brother leaned his chin on his fist, his lips breaking out into a feral smile. I glimpsed Ben. (V.305) printed on his wrist. He twitched again, all of him contorting on the chair, colors streaming into his face and blurring him out completely, and then snapping his body back to its original position. It looked more painful, his bones twisting, eyes rolling back. He was doing the exact same thing as little Nick, but something was wrong. With Nick, it looked natural. With my brother, however, it was more of an aggressive virus writhing through him.

“My name is blahblahblahblahablah,” Ben announced. His gaze found something off-camera, his lips widening into a grin. “And I’m playing the part of your son!”

He lunged forward, and the camera moved back slowly, filming every inch of mania tangled in my brother’s eyes. 

“Right, *Mommy*?”

The last piece of footage came up in a buzz of static, my brother’s inhuman grin bleeding into what looked like a graveyard. It was the exact same grave I saw in the funeral footage. But this time it was months later, the sky illuminated by dancing snowflakes. I could barely see anything. Just a still image of my mother standing in front of the small grave. 

The date was hard to see, though I could just about make out **12/15/1999** flickering at the top of the screen. The camera moved closer—this time from a different perspective. 

As they got closer, I could see my mother better. 

She wore nothing but jeans and a shirt, snowflakes clinging to straggly hair dangling in her face. When she dropped down onto her knees, the person dropped the camera, and I could make out a shadow moving towards my mom in the dark, arms coming out to wrap her into a hug. 

It was a woman. 

“Alice?” she spoke hesitantly at first, and then again when my mother didn’t move, pressing her forehead into the marble headstone. “Sweetie, I know it’s been rough,” the woman spoke in a low murmur, her voice growing colder when Mom shuffled back and started clawing at the dirt of the grave. “Alice,” she whispered. “You need to get a hold of yourself.” There was movement and the rustling of clothes. She stepped into a dusting of snow and knelt next to Mom. 

“You’re freezing! Look, take my jacket, okay?" She looked important, wearing a black suit, and raybans, carrying a matching umbrella which she awkwardly held over Mom’s head.

The woman pulled off her coat, but Mom wrenched away, her eyes wide. “No.” Mom said in a breath. She slammed her hands over her ears, shaking her head. 

“No, no, no, no!” When she jumped to her feet, the woman was quick to stop her. 

But she didn’t listen. I don’t even think my Mom knew this woman was there. Her eyes were blank, unseeing, staring through the winter night. She dropped down to the frozen soil and pressed her hands into the grave. “They’re here,” she sobbed. And when her head jerked around, my mother stumbled over to the camera and grabbed it, her dead eyes peering into the lens. 

“Always right here,” she said in a hysterical laugh. “I still have them right here. Right here. Right here. **Right here.”** There was a sharp thud sound, and the camera jolted to a different angle. This time it was from the ground. I could make out the shape of the woman’s head, but there were no discernible features. Mom’s sharp breaths collapsed into sobs. “I’m still their mother, right?”

The woman pressed something to her ear—a phone.

I squinted, looking closer. 

In this footage from 1999, this woman was holding an iPhone 10.

“Give me a moment," she murmured into the phone, then turning her attention to my mother. 

“Alice, you know I can’t answer that.” 

I leaned closer to the TV to try and figure out her face, though it was too pixelated. “You need to remember they are not—" her voice cut out, "and we really need to talk about—” The video skipped ahead again. Mom was screaming, rocking backward and forwards, and the woman was trying to calm her down. "Alice, you need to listen to me," she said. "You have to promise me you won't do something stupid. Are we clear? Because I can't protect you if you act with emotion."

I didn't see the slap, though I heard it, the raw cut of skin against skin. 

Mom's shrieks slammed into me, and I stabbed pause, my breath in my throat, my own hands already mimicking hers, ready to block out the noise and squeeze my eyes shut. But once I was burying my head in my lap and forcing myself to take deep breaths, my thoughts snapped into focus. There was something—no, someone behind me. Not just that. My head was pounding, a dull thrum stabbing across the back of my skull. 

I couldn’t breathe, and when I tried to grasp hold of my throat, I couldn’t feel my hands. They were behind me. Bound to my back. There was something warm running down my face, trickling down my chin, and I couldn’t… I couldn’t move. She was back, and her presence was suffocating me. I could glimpse her getting closer, dancing toward me, her arms thrusting out, ready to--

*“Zoey?"*

The dancing dots in my eyes faded, and I let out a strangled breath, clinging onto the plastic box in front of me. It felt real, and that was enough. 

All at once, I could breathe again. I could move. Blinking rapidly, I crawled away from the television, pressing two fingers to my nose and lips, where I could still feel the sensation of blood staining my face and trickling down my chin. I could feel the prickle of the rope binding my arms behind my back, and the lacerations slicing, cutting, and raw into my flesh. Except there was nothing there. I stared down at my hands and tried to find them, trying to find the blood that was wet on my lips and salting my tongue. 

Nothing. 

“What are you doing down here?”

Twisting around, I managed to shove the tapes under a shelf with my knee.

Nick was standing on the top of the staircase, peering down at me. He looked almost otherworldly, standing under the flickering golden bulb. “Mom says we’re not allowed down here,” he said. “Dinner is ready.”

*Dinner?*

I felt dizzy, my head swimming. 

But it was 8am, right?

When I managed to drag myself back up the basement steps and into the kitchen where Mom was filming a “What I eat in a day” it hit me that I had been watching tapes for almost eight hours. I checked the number on my wrist feverishly, though the digits were still the same.

Zoey. (V. 1,780.) 

*I was still the same version I had been earlier that morning, right?*

I took my usual seat at the table, and the second I sat down I knew there was a different atmosphere. Mom had already served each of us, focusing on setting up her camera equipment. 

Allie was sitting stiff, while Ben acted like his plate was carrying a contagious disease. I noticed neither of them were talking or making eye contact—and when I fully drank in my brother, something ice cold crept down my spine. He was wearing the exact same jacket I saw torn and hanging off of his psycho replica. This begged the question: *Was this the beginning of that version of Ben?*

Before that thought could fully flourish, Mom placed a glass of orange juice in front of me. “All right, I want you all on your best behavior,” she said, when Nick slumped into the seat next to mine, and immediately began shovelling pasta into his mouth. 

The four of us stayed silent. 

When Mom started recording, Ben kicked me under the table. “Hey, Mommy’s!” Mom said gleefully into her camera, doing a pan of the table which was set up with bowls of breadsticks and salad. 

“So, tonight, we’re going to be having Chicken Alfredo! I did my own recipe, and it’s gluten-free of course, since all you mommy's have been begging me for a dinner video—" Ignoring Mom’s voice, I focused on my brother’s scowl. I already knew just by looking at the strain in his expression, the curl in his lip, and Allie’s too-wide smile. 

*They knew.*

But how could they know? I tried to check out their wrists, but both of them were hiding them. Allie’s arms were folded, while Ben’s sleeves were pulled right down to the cuffs. 

Ben kicked me again, and I shot him a look.

“Later.” I mouthed. 

After sitting through almost half an hour of my mother trying to force-feed me pasta with a cute, quirky smile to the camera, I knew I had to say something about the tapes. If I didn’t, I was going to go crazy. “Mom,” I said when she was happily chewing on a breadstick, commenting on the garlic sauce. 

“Stop.” 

She didn’t listen to me, only shooting me a warning smile that I was interrupting her filming. I forced myself not to look at the door, where a shadow was already bleeding, blurring into reality. I turned away from my replica, like she was disappear if I blinked enough times. 

"I think the other me has broken character.”

"Hmm?" She inclined her head, pausing filming.

Turning to my siblings, I prayed they would back me up. If they knew something was wrong, then they had to know about our existence.

"Broken character," I repeated. "All of the versions of me who you killed."

Mom's smile didn't waver. "Zoey, are you feeling okay?" She cleared her throat, speaking in her fake voice. 

"Excuse my daughter. She has an, uh, a twisted sense of humor."

“You're not our Mom,” I said through gritted teeth.

Immediately, Mom stopped filming. She didn’t move, her gaze never leaving mine.

I continued, albeit shakily. “There are tapes in the basement,” I managed to get out. Ben wasn’t looking at me, glaring down at his plate, and Allie was still smiling through her dinner, tears glistening in her eyes. Nick was still eating,  completely oblivious, ignoring everyone around him. “And there are kids that aren’t…they're not…” I swallowed hard, struggling to coerce the words. 

I had no idea how to say it because what exactly did I see? I saw a funeral for my brother, who was sitting right across from me. I saw him explode into red mist.

And that version of him didn't come back. 

I lost my breath, instantly, and Mom’s smile returned. "Nicholas, stop eating like an animal, you are going to choke," she chastised him, before her gaze found mine. “Zoey, you have a fever,” she said in a hum. “Why don’t you head upstairs? I can bring you some of my special vegetable soup. I think you just need a good night's rest, sweetie." 

“I know.”

Ben surprised me by dropping his fork, drawing our mother’s gaze to him. When he moved his arm, the sleeve of his jacket slightly rode up his arm, and I finally saw a number. (Ben. V. 30012.) His lip curled into a scowl.  I saw that same light I’d seen in his replica’s eyes, and something twisted in my gut. I wasn’t looking at my brother from earlier at breakfast. This version was different. Darker. Wherever he had come from, he knew about the tapes. “Yeah, I know,” my brother spat. “Do you know how many fucking times we’ve had this conversation—”

He stopped, drawing in a startled breath, when Mom jumped up from her chair, grabbed the knife she had used to cut through breadsticks, and came behind him, pressing the blade to his throat. Allie screamed and jumped up from her chair, only to slump back down with a whimper.  

“I said, that is enough,” Mom spoke calmly, her fingers wrapped around the blade. “I wanted a nice, quiet dinner with my children, and you ruin it with your theatrics,” she spoke through a hiss. “You’re my babies, and you’re going to be… silent.” She pressed pressure on the knife, and Ben hissed out. Mom’s gaze flicked to me. “Zoey, go and get whatever you found and bring them here right now,” she ordered.

“She’s lying,” Ben said in a scoff. “She’s not our mother,” his expression darkened, lips spreading out into a surprising grin. “Actually! Here’s the kicker! We’re not even—”

Mom jerked the knife, the blade slicing straight through his flesh and carving the words directly from his throat.

“Oh, sweetie,” Mom dropped the knife and wrapped her arms around him, lolling his body from side to side. “I told you not to play with sharp things.” She hummed. “Now, I want you all to be perfect, and that MEANS perfect. Including all those bad, bad thoughts in your mind.”

My brother did not bleed like normal people. He didn’t react to having his throat sliced open like normal people, either. Instead of crying out or even reacting, his smile only widened, sharp red starting to slip down his throat in a river of red before he burst into a spattering red mist that showered the table. Allie was next. I didn’t see it, instead squeezing my eyes shut. 

I heard her squeak, and something wet and warm hit me in the face. I could sense their replicas already bleeding into reality. I refused to look at them. Allie’s chair shifted, and then so did Ben’s. I opened my eyes to see if these versions were twisted and wrong, but I found myself staring at two empty chairs. 

When my gaze flicked to the doorway, I saw myself peeking, like she knew exactly what would happen next. Turning to Nick, he was still eating, forking up pieces of pasta that were covered in my siblings’ blood, and stuffing it into his mouth. I waited for their replicas to appear, and yet neither of them did. 

There was only mine, watching me with that same monstrous grin contorting my lips. I was ready to finally confront this version of me when something cold and cruel grazed the skin of my throat. “I want all of my children to be perfect,” Mom’s smooth voice was in my ear. 

“Because they’re *here,”* she pressed harder on the blade, dragging the teeth across my throat. 

I couldn’t breathe. 

“Always been here,” Mom’s voice was a sing-song. I knew my hands were already on my throat, wet and slick with my own blood, but she kept going, as I gurgled on breaths. 

“Always here.”

Her words were still alive in my mind, her breath warm in my ear, when I dived up from my bed, back in my bedroom, choking on phantom blood filling my mouth.

I checked the time, and then my wrist.

8am.

I had lost not just one day, but four days. Four days of being completely out of it. I looked down at my wrist.

**Zoey. V. 1,785.**

Five versions of me had existed while I was out. I didn’t bother with my morning routine. I needed to get down to the basement to watch the rest of the tapes.

Then I was grabbing my siblings, or ‘siblings’, and getting the fuck out of here. When I hammered on their doors, there was no answer. I checked both of them, and neither of my siblings was in their rooms. 

I started to panic. Neither of them had a replica replace them the night before. The kitchen was empty when I peeked in, and so was the lounge. Fuck. I started toward the basement, my heart trying to projectile itself from my chest when a hand grabbed my shoulder. 

“What’s going on with you?” Allie spoke with a yawn. When I twisted around, I was greeted with my sister’s sleepy smile. “You’re all jumpy,” she poked me. “Shouldn’t you be heading in for breakfast? Mom’s making pancakes.”

The innocent naivety on my sister’s face broke my heart. This was another version of her—a brand new perfect model who did not ask questions.

I forced myself to nod. “Yeah, I’m going to grab my pom-poms from the basement,” I said with a smile, catching a flash of her wrist.

Still no number.

I had seen numbers printed on myself and my brother, but why not her?

Allie cocked her head. “Wasn’t your game yesterday?”

I didn’t think about the time that I had lost. I had lived through three whole days and five different versions of myself while being unconscious. While I was struggling to answer her, there was another tap on my shoulder. “Move. You’re both in my way,” Ben shoved past us with a grin. “I've got the bathroom first.” His gaze found mine, and I saw the slightest hint of blue light in his eyes. The same light that had come from the tapes.

“What?” Allie protested. “No, that’s not fair! It’s Sunday! I have things to do!”

He folded his arms. “Oh, like meet up with your not-secret-at-all-boyfriend?”

I left the two of them, determined to find the real versions who died the night before. After waiting for everyone to clear the hallway, I slipped back down to the basement, and to my surprise, the tapes were exactly where I had left them. I picked out a tape that simply said:

Ben. (V.1)

Galvanic blue washed over my face, and once again, I had that urge to... look down at my hands. I felt my body stiffen under the light, my gaze already dropping towards my hands planted in my lap. At first, there was nothing. I was just staring down at my regular hands. Then. Something snapped inside my mind, a belt that, until then, had been wrapped around my brain, suffocating me. 

Under the sickly glow of my basement lights, I could see markings carved into my skin; tally’s that had been crossed out, and numbers in their hundreds and then thousands. They started in marker, before being cruelly carved and sliced into my skin. So many versions of myself written, scrawled all over my flesh. 

I found number one on the back of my hand. The carving was old, and so was the ink that had been pencilled over it. In a single moment, I could feel the rope around my wrists and blood crusted under my nose and choked at the back of my throat. My vision blurred, and I swore I had moved just a single inch to the left. When the TV screen lit up with static footage, I lifted my head, hypnotized by the light.

I already knew at the back of my mind, that once I wasn’t thinking about this condition I was in for just a second—I instantly forgot about the markings.

The pain, and my own strangled breaths that were still phantom around me, a version of me who had been tortured inside this room.

The tape didn’t work at first. I mean it did, though there was something wrong with it. It attempted to show me something, before going black.

I ejected the tape, blew on it, and shoved it back into the player. 

I could see the dark room and Ben sitting on the chair once again, wrapped in a football jersey. This was the original footage from what I had seen earlier. 

The Ben on this tape was different. 

If anything, he looked confused, staring wide-eyed at the camera, his lips curled into a silent cry. The film was overlapped with another cut of footage, which this time depicted what looked like a high school football game from the perspective of someone who appeared to be hiding. I could barely see anything, only a grainy picture of a football field and several blurs in blue and gold. The date stapled at the top of the screen: 

**12/07/1984**

The tape snapped back to the room with my brother sitting in the chair, and a thought crawled into my mind, invasive and pushing. This was the start of the film I had already seen earlier when Ben had… I couldn’t put a word to whatever this thing was. He was like a human video tape. His eyes were half lidded, glued to something off-screen. 

“Don’t look at her,” Mom’s voice had a cold edge to it. “Look at me.”

Ben's gaze found the camera. 

"But... who are you?" His head twitched again, dilated pupils  flickering a variety of colors I could barely register. This version of him, however, was terrified of what was happening to him. He jolted again, eyes growing wide with terror. I saw his wrist, the ink printed on his skin. It was fresh, only recently forming.

**Ben (V.1)**

Something acidic gathered in the back of my mouth. I was looking right at the beginning of my brother. 

Mom pushed across a glass of water, and Ben's arm whirred in and out of reality, trying to grasp hold of it. 

"I am your mother, of course."
