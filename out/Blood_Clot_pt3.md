Thank you for your kind words, I appreciate them. Now to pick up where I left off. You can catch up [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/fbutmtt2ra)

After posting, I slumped into my seat, wrapped in my blanket, a few drops of water still running down my face from my damp hair. I was the most miserable I’d been in years. The only time I felt worse was when I found my brother’s body, a level of despair I highly doubt will ever be topped. I looked down at a patch on my blanket where my brother embroidered his name. It was the one patch that he contributed to.

 My mother wanted me to remove it after he died because she thought it would make me sad and we got into a heated argument over it. She was right, it was and still is an upsetting reminder, but I’m never getting rid of it. I’m not at a stage in my grieving where I can look at it and just think of fond memories. I do think about the fact that he’s not here more than I think about my time with him. Still, I’d rather remember that pain than even begin to forget. I hope that one day I don’t feel a twinge of sadness and I just think of the good times but I can never get there if I ignore it.

I conjured up each detail of his funeral in my mind. The design of the casket, the specific mosque we went to, the words we said in our prayers to Allah, the shade of gray my shoes were, everything. Even at the time, I knew that every detail would become etched in my mind.

Death is something that has followed my family and my people for generations, and now it was directly after me. It had loomed over me for my entire life, its stench making its way into my nostrils with every dirty prying eye and intrusive thought when I held a blade. This is why the depression that developed from realizing that this was my life was unsurprising. Accepting that this was happening was already hard, but accepting that it likely wouldn't stop was a distinct type of soul-crushing. I remained still for a few more minutes, finding it difficult to get the motivation to move. 

Still, sitting in my car in the middle of nowhere wasn't going to help so I willed my body to turn on the vehicle. I drove in silence for a little under an hour. I couldn't help but think back to my childhood the entire time. Part of me wanted to tell my parents about what had been happening, and finally have people to confide in, but then I thought about how they’d feel. Getting the first call in months from their last living child just to hear him describe how he’d fallen into the delusion that made their eldest kill himself. Generations worth of trauma to get to America for a better life only for death to follow like a curse.

I shivered thinking about it and decided not to say anything. I wanted to play music but no matter what I put on it overwhelmed me. My palms grew sweaty, and my grip on the steering wheel tightened, it didn't matter what it was, everything became strangely overstimulating as my mind replayed past regrets and new fears. It didn't help that my bandaged hand was still damp and continued to contain an underlying itch. I pulled up onto campus and caught one of my classes just in time. I stumbled, the blood loss impacting my motor functions as I struggled not to fall over myself while reaching a seat.

“Typical,” 

I heard a college murmur under his breath as he moved a seat away from me. It was the kind of thing I received constantly but it seriously upset me at that moment. I was rarely late but because I messed up once it was a negative trait he could attribute to me overall. I clenched my pencil while holding in the urge to respond, listening to the lecture while pulling out my textbook. My professor went on about statistics while I had trouble holding myself together. I scratched at my wrapped hand a few times, as the stinging feeling returned with a vengeance. I could feel the craters from Tolc’s bites now deteriorating the skin around them. Each fiber of my flesh depleting in strength and connection. My eyes bulged as I strained them to stay focused on the words before me.

“My son!” I heard for a split second. The volume was low but the pitch and tone were distressed. I turned to the right when I heard it, especially surprised as the words were in Rohingya. Aside from a creeped-out glance from someone waking past me, I was met with nothing. I ignored it, looking at a projection of a graph. 

“Please, not him, not him!” a low scream emanated from my left. It was a different voice but the same language. I looked around longer, straining my eyes further. Like last time there was nothing there. Now I was convinced that either my poor health or the demonic forces that haunted me were causing auditory hallucinations. My heart rate increased at the prospect and my wound spread open further.

“Stop, please!” the voice from earlier returned, louder than before. I dropped my pencil and rubbed my temples, warm blood now cutting through my wraps. A ringing in my ears peeking through, uiningeligable words in tandem with the painful pitch.

“He’s just a boy don’t do this! Take me instead I’m grown!” a dry older voice begged. I couldn't see him but I vaguely heard him fall to his knees and clasp his hands. Followed by the sound of a shot that I heard in both ears. The sensation pushed me back and forced me to clasp the sides of my head.

“NO!” he screamed seconds after. My heart began to race as I shut my eyes while hearing him crawl in the dry dirt toward the body of what I presumed to be his son.

I held back bile in my throat. I didn't want to hear ANY of that! I’d been dropped into a traumatizing scene with no warning. In the voice of that man, I heard my father. The way he screamed was eerily similar to the screams that echoed when my brother’s corpse was found.

“No, no, no.” I couldn't help but repeat to myself as my mind conjured unfortunate visions of what had taken place. I had not lived it, nor did I know who I heard, but it felt far too real and familiar. A stabbing sensation that hit me in an instant, forcing me to tear a hand away from my head. In a panic, I bit down on my jacket to try to silence my whines of pain. Layers of my skin fell off my hand like raw meat on weak bones.

“Please, I do live here! My family has been for ages!” a woman pleaded on the verge of tears as I ground my teeth. Warmth leaking out onto my now putrid hand. I put my head down on my desk aggressively. The instinct to start flailing and screaming in pain was strong but I curved it as best I could. Eyes flickering, ears overrun, and all senses of comfort in my skin fleeing my sense of self, I sat back up. I at least wanted to take notes and comprehend as much of the lesson as I could. More instances of pleading in my parent’s native tongue persisted, each one getting harder to ignore than the last. 

It was almost impossible to get anything done but I did my best. I left struggling to walk, head and legs twitching in multiple directions uncontrollably with each step. A cracking sound overpowered everything else whether it came from my leg joints or neck. My body was a cheaply articulated doll, struggling not to crack. I made my way into the bathroom and decided I’d make wudhu in an attempt to cleanse myself. I waited till no one was using it and turned on the sink. 

I took out the scissors in my pocket and sliced open my bandages. The rank stench hit me immediately. I coughed as I stared in horror at my decomposing hand. It was slimy with multiple stretches of skin peeling off akin to an overripe fruit. Bursting through the skin and covered in bruises. I took a long breath and prepared myself regardless.

“Bismillah” I uttered before washing my hands. I scrubbed my palms wrists, and in between my fingers. It was difficult to watch more of my blood go down the drain. It wasn't my fault but I felt shame seeing my body in that way. I hated seeing any of Allah’s creations' contorted against the natural order. It hurt, the thin skin on my fingers akin to a worn-down sliver of soap. I was relieved that the three times I cleansed by mouth and nose no blood came out. 

I froze for a moment as I heard someone enter, swiping away my hand instantly. They thankfully didn't notice and I washed my face. When I placed my hand on my forehead the slight pain that had been developing quelled, and the scream quieted once my wet hands reached my ears. My fidgety arms also calmed slightly by the third clean, though I now had some bloody residue on them. I got through wiping my hair easily and after my ears were cleaned the horrific echoes of others’ paste ceased. I took the largest sigh of relief as I finished by rinsing my feet and reading the dua.

I felt much calmer, my limbs were still weak but were not as janky. I pulled out a small box of bandages from my bag when I was approached by an unfamiliar voice.

“Hey don’t worry I can help,” 

I jumped up, and it took a moment for me to realize if what I was seeing was real. 

“I’m sorry I didn't mean to scare you, I just saw your hand when I walked up and figured you needed help.” 

I hesitated to put my hand before him.

“It's alright I can do it by myself, I have another class soon.” I remarked, realizing that my the class I was in had likely ended.

He smiled and opened up my bandage bag.

“I promise it’ll be fast, please I insist.” 

“No, honestly I got it,” I responded trying to remain polite.

“Come on dude, everyone needs help sometimes.” he clapped his hands cheerily.

I relented, nervously thumping my foot as he patched me up. He did it quickly as promised. 

“There you go! Man that was pretty gnarly though, you should go to the nurse.”

I would agree with his advice but remembering how doctors claimed that my brother’s paranormal afflictions didn't even exist I was doubtful.  

“No, it’s okay I got it.” I smiled attempting to grab my bag back from him.

“You sure? I think it’s better than doing this by yourself, especially in a public bathroom.”

He grinned brightly, his eyes strangely glass-like. His slight pushiness and general vibe unnerved me but he brought up a good point, so I agreed. We walked to her office and she inspected my peeling arm.

“Goodness, has this ever happened to you before?” she questioned, trying to disinfect it. 

“No, this is the first time.”

I hissed as the rubbing alcohol sizzled.

“How long have you had this injury and how did you get it?”

I jolted up as more disinfectants were added.

“Ah! Sorry, I’ve had it for about two days,” I paused as I tried to come up with a reasonable explanation.

“I was bitten by a large dog and despite my efforts, whatever infection it gave me has only gotten worse.” I shivered thinking about the real way I got it.

“I’m sorry if I can’t help much, I‘ve never seen anything like this before. Injuries, sure, but the way your hand is falling apart is most comparable to a corpse.” she winced.

“The only thing I can suggest is that you get to a doctor and continue your efforts to keep the injury clean.” 

I nodded as she finished wrapping my hand.

“Thank you.” I smiled weakly before getting up and collecting my things. The guy who escorted me to the nurse’s office follow.

“Hey, don’t worry I’ll be okay, you should get to your classes now.” I walked a bit faster, trying not to be obvious about it. 

There wasn't a specific reason why I shouldn’t have trusted him, but I couldn't shake an uneasy feeling in his presence. His gaze was simultaneously joyful and dead. Glass orbs reflecting what was around them, no substance of their own. The kindness seemed like it would come with caveats.

“Okay, I don’t mean to scare you but I didn't bump into you by accident.” 

I pursed my lips, that didn't sound like a good start.

“So you’ve been following me?” I questioned trying to sound more stern.

“Hey, keep calm. Yes, I have, a few places honestly. Though I promise it’s not in a creepy stalker way.” he chuckled, trying his best not to make me uncomfortable.

“About two days ago, I saw you bleeding in the student parking lot before you covered your windows.” he began to explain, taking another step.

“I didn't say anything 'cause I wasn't sure of what I saw and I didn't wanna be invasive. But I stuck around a little longer and decided it would be best to keep an eye out for you.”

I rolled my eyes at his weak excuse.

“Right, because watching me without my knowledge is so much better than stepping in to help.” 

I realize that was blunt, but a lesser response wouldn't have been appropriate.

“Listen, I know it sounds bad but I needed to assess whether I should step in! If I had gone in with little information it could’ve been a mess, I needed to research first. You can’t be too mad at me for wanting to do what’s best for you, right?” 

I didn't appreciate how he tried to twist my words and make it sound like my issue was his concern.

“If you reached out initially I wouldn’t have an issue, it’s the fact you’ve been watching me that gets under my skin! Be honest, how many places have you followed me to?”

His smile grew wider again, flashing his movie star straight teeth.

“Not too many, just as many places as I needed to.”

“And by that you mean?” I hardened my gaze, waiting for a complete answer.

“I only stayed outside your car for a few minutes after you covered your windows. But I did follow you to the classes you attended yesterday, you know, to check on you.”

He reached out an arm, I tried to smack him away but he was too fast. Lightly gripping my shoulder.

“Understand that I am not trying to antagonize you, Aziz.”

His saying my name without me telling him was almost as bad as when Tolc did it. I removed his hand, taking a few steps away from him.

“What is it about me that’s making you do this? I get the concern for my health, and I respect that, but the stalking is far from needed.” 

He laughed, seeming to take the situation far less seriously than me as people walked past us. All the glares towards me and never him.

“Hey, don’t worry I’m not one of those weirdos who just picks a new brown person to obsess over each week,” he assured me in a light-hearted tone, but his reference being so specific made me me wonder if that was exactly what he was.

“To cut to the chase, I can tell that whatever you are dealing with is paranormal. Based on the injury and behavior I’ve observed, I’m willing to bet it’s some demon trying to break down or possess you.”

I was surprised by how accurate he was with such little information, but that also made me worry about what else he could easily gather. 

“I‘m a bit of a supernatural specialist! I am well-versed in creatures beyond our mortal plain. I'm particularly knowledgeable in cryptids and demonology.” his tone was self-assured and a bit braggadocious. Confidence I wouldn't have minded if it hadn't been for everything else.

“So what do you say, Aziz? I think I could seriously help you out!” 

By this point, I was already close to my next class, so I attempted to use it as a way out.

“You have to understand that this is a lot for me to process right now. You should get to where you’ll need to be and I’ll let you know if I run into you.” 

He frowned, attempting to give me puppy dog eyes. 

“Oh, sorry I realize I’ve likely come on too strong. I seriously hope you consider it though, 'cause there aren't a lot of people out there who are well-versed like I am.” 

I nodded at him with a faint smile before waving goodbye and stepping inside. On top of his general creepiness, my parents had always warned me about messing with magic, especially demons. Yes, we were religious, but it was always in the name of protection and prayer. It’s my bias, I know, but the lack of severity in his tone when considering the things he was messing with was off-putting.

I struggled to stay put during class, the whispers returning, though it was far more subdued. The whole time I couldn't stop thinking of him. Here he goes, not even telling me his name, and then trying to get involved. Some may say I’m too harsh, that I should be more trusting, and I’d like to be, but I could read him pretty well. He was the exact kind of fake friend I had in the past and wanted to avoid. They say they want to help but have an underlying motive that serves them more than you.

When I stepped out, there he was, standing to the right of me outside the door with that same toothy grin. 

“Hey! Hope I didn't scare you there hot shot!” 

This is petty but I didn't like that nickname.

“Oh, uhh-”

“So did you think it over?” he cut off before I could start.

“Yeah, I appreciate the offer and I’m glad you want to help, but I don’t think this is what you think it is.”

He tilted his head to the side, expression remaining.

“My medical condition, whatever it may be, is certainly unique but it is not otherworldly. My brother had the same issue, so I’ll probably just tell him.” I lied through my teeth, hoping to make things seem as mundane as possible so he’d leave me be.

“But you said your brother died cause of a demon,” he commented, narrowing his gaze for the first time.

“W-what? I don’t know what you're talking about.” 

He pulled out his phone and pulled up my previous posts discussing what happened to me. My eyes widened, as a wave of regret for clicking submit washed over me.

“You talk all about it here, and I get the feeling that this isn't just some little scary story or vent. All of this lines up well with what I’ve seen.” 

I looked at the floor unsure of what to do.

“Alright, I get you think you can help me, but you can’t. I don’t mess with any monsters or demons, I respect your beliefs but I do not get involved with that. I don’t even know your name, and you are asking me to commit to whatever supernatural practices you think will aid me.” I blurted it out fast as I walked, picking up speed with each step even though he would just match my pace.

“Oh, yeah I’m starting to get it. Let me fix some of those things, first, my name is Lane, Lane Todd.” he clasped his hands together as he attempted to walk in front of me. I gently nudged him, which didn't deter him in the slightest. 

“Second, I’d just like to say that I get that, but I promise I am not involving myself with any malicious forces directly. You do not have to worry at all about encountering any sort of ghoul, I’m essentially a diet exorcist, and I want to help cleanse you of whatever is harming you.” 

He cleared his throat, before giving me his best, sincere, and sensitive expression. 

“I want to avoid making you any more uncomfortable. I will just sit you down and do some research, monitor you a little more, throw things at the wall, and see what sticks. Rest assured, that I do everything within your religious boundaries and have total respect for your beliefs as a Hindu.” 

I stopped, unable to help but throw a puzzled look at him.

“I’m sorry, you’ve made a mistake I’m not Hindu.” 

He awkwardly snapped his fingers at me.

“Oops, sorry I just assumed 'cause you are Indian. Hope that doesn't seem racist, just can’t help my bias ya know?”

I failed to hold back a sigh as I’d once again have to explain my background to someone.

“I’m not Indian, I’m Rohingya. I’m part of a majority Muslim ethnic group from Myanmar, used to be called Burma. I like most of my people practice Islam.”

His smile faded as his embarrassment became clear.

“My apologies for the mistake, regardless, you should accept my offer.” his chirpiness was chipping away rapidly, his already forceful nature just a few steps away from being demanding. I knew I shouldn’t have caved, I knew I should have stuck to the path of light with the beliefes and people I trusted. But I thought back to the bleeding, the rotting, the lack of sleep, the awful hallucinations, and yeah, I was getting desperate to try anything. So against my better judgment and all my survival instincts, I gave in.

“Okay, I have work today but we can meet somewhere after, it needs to be a public location though.” I specified a thin layer of security over this dicey setup.

“Sounds great! Let me put my number in your phone so I can hit you up! I’ll even drive you there if you’d like to cause your hand is all messed up.”

“Thanks but I’ll take my car.” There was no way I was relying on him for a ride.

“Alright hot shot! I’ll see you later!” he grinned as he typed in his number and jogged off. I took a long breath, letting myself have a brief moment of relief over him being gone. Trying not to think about how he’d be back in just a few hours.

We met up in a shifty nail salon, but I didn't expect any more so it didn't bother me much. I walked in and found him sitting in a chair by the door on his phone, reading an article on Myanmar. He looked up at me with the same wide grin. 

“Alright, let’s get this party started!” he clapped embarrassingly loudly. People turned to us with confusion. I put my head down, awkwardly covering half of my face with my sweater. This was not going to be fun.

“Don’t worry about them, they know what’s up.” he snapped his fingers, at a woman in a chair who looked utterly clueless. 

Despite the energy in the room, he was able to get in with ease. Someone, I presume to be the owner allowing us to slip by into the back. As we approached the small room my stomach churned.

“Hey, you said we’d meet in a public place! There are people up front but this is away from them.” I complained, crossing my arms. I furrowed my brows at him, trying to look mad to hide my underlying fear.

“Come on man, what did you honestly expect? There aren't many places that are open to all the stuff here.”

Those words concerned me further. 

“You told me we wouldn't be doing anything dangerous. If the things you do here aren't acceptable enough to do in front of others why would I trust myself alone with you?”

He threw himself onto one of the bean bag chairs, with an over-the-top groan.

“Ugh, listen, I get the worries but you're getting paranoid. Do you want my assistance, or do you want to brave the demon periods alone?“

His comparison was crude but he had a point, something was better than nothing. Though, by then, I was more concerned about what he’d do if I tried to leave. This man who’d stalked me already got me in a room alone with him. Knowing how a lot of stories like that ended, suddenly leaving would not go well.

“Fine, but I’m on thin ice with you. How are we doing this?”

Lane’s smile returned as he got up from the bean bag chair.

“Okay first, you gotta get seated, you can have the chair I was just in or the one at my desk.” his desk looked like it was on its last legs so I opted for the bean bag chair.

“Great! I’m going to light some scented candles to invite a good aura.” he took red candles of varying shades. All of them appeared to be homemade, with labels drawn on strips of tape. He placed the mahogany one to my left and a neon one to my right.

“The one on your left is for luck, and the one on your right is for passion,” he explained happily, taking out a vile from a cabinet. 

“Here, put this on your neck, it contains a great mix of essential oils!” 

I was skeptical but played along, praying that he wasn't drugging me. I inspected the ingredients on the back and it was exactly what he said. A simple combination of rose and lavender scents I applied it as he sat across from me on the floor. He stared at me with large eyes full of wonder.

“Wow, has anyone told you how flawless your skin is?”

I already had a hard time receiving compliments so one from him was not welcome.

“No, but thank you.” he continued to stare at me as he got up to grab a crystal necklace from his desk.

“I don’t know why I thought you were Indian, clearly you're something more unique. I mean yeah you're skin is dark but that nose is more South-East than South Asian.”

I wiped my hands on my sweater, the regret now pounding in my head. He leaned in, inspecting me like I was a rare animal.

“It's a shame your people are endangered, you are all so gorgeous.” 

I cleared my throat awkwardly as I felt his gaze was getting increasingly predatory.

“Cool, now can we please get to it? The gas money to get here was not cheap.”

I backed away slightly from him as I asked.

“Right, I just felt the need to make it clear that I stand with you and your beautiful people, and that I am a major alley. I’m sorry they’re in such a defenseless position, I’d save them if I could.”

Lane put two fingers in front of my nose and flicked it.

“The healing starts now.” 

I waited for a few seconds, he told me to close my eyes, I did so reluctantly, and waited for a few minutes. A few minutes turned into ten, and then fifteen. He played audio of doves chirping as I waited for something to happen.

“Just a few more minutes and it’ll kick in.”

My patience was wearing thin but I told myself to give him time. He seemed odd and self centered but sometimes you put aside other’s motives if they give you results.

“I’m glad your so accepting of my efforts, it makes me happy.”

“Your welcome.” I muttered as I heard him move closer to me. 

“I’ve never seen anyone like you before, watching you is an incredible feeling. When I see you, it’s like gazing at one of the last surviving statues from a destroyed temple.”

He opened my palm and placed a cold stone in it.

“That said, as beautiful of a statue you are, you are still made of the same material as this stone.”

“What?” I questioned.

“Respectfully, for all the pain that you write about, I can’t say I see it in your face or voice.”

His tone was overly soft and cautious, like he was speaking to a wild animal.

“Most of the people in your situation would show a lot of grace to what I’m doing, but you just seem irritated.”

I held back my annoyance, trying to not prove his point.

“I’m aware, but in my defense you stalked me and I’ve been sitting here for like thirty minutes with nothing happening.”

My eyes remained closed but I knew that he was feigning innocence with wide eyes.

“Maybe, but at least I care right? I get that this is hard for you, but I’d at least say thank you. I think I deserve it for my efforts…”

He paused, I peeked and saw him take out the voice memo app on his phone.

“Now please, be better and tell me your thankful.” 

I grunted and fully opened my eyes, standing up. I was at my limit with him.

“Hey, we just got started!” he complained as I put my hand on the doorknob.

“I think I’ve seen enough, all you’ve done is sit me down and scent this room like a perfume store! If you were honestly trying to do something here then I’m sorry but it's not working.” 

He pulled on my sleeve, trying to prevent me from going.

“Come on just a little longer!”

“No! I should have never come here!” I yelled back, as his grip tightened.

“You don’t get it, I NEED you here Aziz. At least compensate me with praise!”

I shoved him away, fed up and hating myself for being stupid.

“The only thing you need is therapy, you followed me around for goodness sake!”

“It made you come here though, right?!”
He whined, looking distraught as I tossed the stone back on the floor. I squinted at him, truly realizing the delusion I was dealing with.

“If you don’t stay you will die! You, just like all those others! Don’t you get it, I am saving you!” he started screaming, pulling me by the collar of my sweater.

“Well, I’d rather die alone than on your watch!” 

I pushed him away harder than I had in a long time. 

He smirked as I looked at my bandaged hand, which was now bleeding again. My eyes started to water, and I shook my head as I realized what was happening.

“Come on Hot Shot, you can either stay safe here or wilt outside in the cold,” he spoke slowly, ego seeping through each word like the blood of my bandage. I contemplated what to do, but fleed the moment he took a step closer.

He chased me, pushing past workers at the salon with little care. I got in my car and hit the gas, he followed me in his van while blowing up my phone with messages. My heart started to pound as my eyes stung profusely, I knew what was coming. I swerved into the nearest parking lot, locking my windows. Through the blood that poured from my eyes, I saw his van pull up next to mine. My doors were locked but I worried he was crazy enough to break open my windows. I wanted to fight more but was powerless as I wailed from the gore that forced its way out of my eyes, and soon my ears and mouth. 

It was almost impossible to see anything and a loud ringing was all that permeated my ears while they leaked. But, I was able to make out a bright light shining on my face no matter where I moved. I did everything I could to hold myself together, but the bleeding in combination with the stress from earlier was unbearable. I rinsed and tried to cover my wounds but nothing worked. I panicked as I genuinely believed I was dying. My body wasn't shutting down, it was violently maiming itself as a sicko watched. I would cry if my eyes weren't already sobbing crimson tears. Eventually, I couldn't take it and collapsed. Feeling each of my senses die out.


“Wow, you look like you haven’t been that stressed in years.” another horrible familiar voice uttered. 

“What could you possibly say now? That I was stupid for trusting a total weirdo cause I wanted the pain go stop? I already know that, Tolc.” I groaned, rubbing my forehead, the pain still prominent. He flashed a toothy grin, leaning in.

“Oh, I have a lot more I can say than that. What did you think of that little flashback I let you hear?”

I turned away from him, not wanting to give him the dignity of eye contact.

“It was certainly disturbing and saddening, but it's not convincing me to give up. If anything, it’s more motive to fight against you so more people don’t die.”

He crackled, loudly, grabbing my face and forcing my neck into an awkward position that forced me to gaze at him.

“Do you honestly think you can escape me? Aziz, I have been killing and conquering sad excuses for people like you for longer than your parents have been alive. Death is something that comes for everyone and I’m intertwined with it.”

 I rolled my eyes at him, which only amused him more.

“Wow, rolling your eyes at the inevitable. You are certainly a badass and not a coward who refuses to accept reality.” he flashed his gums which were somehow even redder than the last time. 

“The future isn't set in stone. You may have been able to end a lot of lives similar to mine, but it doesn't mean I can’t come out of this alive.”

He cocked his head to the side, squinting his beady red eyes.

“Aziz, there is no coming out of this. Do you think I’ll just give up if you stay afloat for too long? I’m not leaving until you're dead, by your hand or mine.”

I felt my stomach drop but I did my best to hide it.

“I’m not an evil you can wish away forever with prayer or scented oil.” he joked, moving a sharp fingernail down the scar on my cheek.

“I get that you like to stand strong, but I’m one of those things that will never leave no matter that strength. You are nothing in comparison to the past bodies I’ve occupied.” 

He violently tossed my head against the far window, causing me to scream in pain. He suddenly grew in height, towering over me further.

“Every moment that you and people like you live fills me with a rage that can only be put to rest by more of you disappearing.”

He stood up, the tops of his spiked hair smooshing against the car ceiling. Thick, jagged teeth grinding as I saw the anger flourish on his face.

“I have happily lived a multitude of lives in the skin of boiled flesh bags like you. If I had things my way, I’d do it again thousands of times until anything resembling you was less than dust!” 

He grabbed onto my throat, harshly pressing down. My eyes bulged as I saw his veins pop through his pale skin.

“I AM THE FUTURE OF YOU AND EVERYONE WHO BARES YOUR SKIN.”

I struggled to breathe, coughing and kicking to no avail. I tried to scream but nothing came out, tears welled up in my eyes as I rasped out two words.

“I refuse…” 

The demon looked like he was going to say something, but just as he opened my mouth, I closed my eyes and felt the hands disappear. My lids suddenly felt heavy and my body heavier. I slowly opened them, surprised to find myself in a hospital bed. I glanced around the room and my eyes instantly fell on the man in a chair at my bed. His hazel eyes were transfixed on my face, particularly my mouth.

“I think it's exquisite how people with darker skin like you have different toned lips.” 

I wanted to throw up hearing his voice, the sound of it almost as bad as the feeling of being strangled moments earlier.

“I saw that you were in some trouble, so I pulled you out of your car and got you some help.” Lane grinned, reaching his arm over towards me.

“And don’t worry you're pretty, toasty, head, I’m paying for everything. That includes your car window and wherever I take you to dinner later.” 

Both insinuations added to my queasiness but I didn't have the energy to respond. He put a hand my head, petting me. I wanted to cry at his touch, I never let anyone apart from family get that close.

“Don’t look so sad, I know I was a bit pushy but I did save your life. A lot of people wouldn't care if a person like you died, but I’m not like them.”

He continued petting me, his voice shifting to a sickeningly syrupy one. The kind you’d use when speaking to a dog.

“It helps that your such a good little thing aren’t ya? I mean the attitude could use some work but everyone has flaws, maybe it has to do with your people’s culture too.”

That last comment gave me the energy to cough up some words.

“I’m sick of you saying stuff like ‘person like me’ Why can’t you just see me as I am?”

He seemed surprised that I was fully conscious, quickly pulling his hand away.

“I do see you as you are! I’m just stating a fact. Your people are under appreciated and have a lot of trauma. I see you as the individual you are.”

I would have balled up my fist if I could.

“You can’t lie to me. All our time spent together has been you obsessing over what boxes I fall under. The type of Asian I am, the way my skin looks, my religion. I can’t just be a person to you!” My yell was strained but I knew he heard it.

“I’m sorry if you feel that way, but you need to give me more credit, I-” 

“No, I don’t! All of this is to make you feel good for helping someone you pity!” I sat up, IV still in my arm.

His smile faded, replaced with annoyance.

“Okay, you want to take me for granted, go ahead. But let’s strike a quick deal.” his tone was serious as he pulled up footage of me bleeding in my car on his phone.

“If you don’t want the bills for all this to be on you, listen closely.” He paused, stiffening  his posture.

“You will let me keep and upload this footage, post about it online, and then say that I saved your life, which is the truth.” 

I bit my tongue, barely stopping myself from getting into a screaming match.

“Then, you will let me take you out of this hospital to dinner and a nice hotel. Mind you, I will pay for it if you comply with the first part.” he put his phone away, a sly smirk creeping across his face.

“You’ll sleep there, I will be in the other room. At each of these stops, you will make another post thanking me. Then, you’ll never see me again.”

It was tempting to berate him with insults, but with how little money I had I was forced to comply.

“Excellent! I’ll wait here with you until you fit to leave and then you can start typing your thanks!” he beamed as if there was nothing about what he forced me into.

The night could have gone worse, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it. The places were far nicer than his company was. I started to think that he was raised with old money based on how much he purchased for us at high-end places without a care, but he said that wasn't the case. A statement I heavily doubt. However, he was upfront when admitting that he chose to live in the back of a nail salon and drive in a van loaded with funky smells.

“Making myself live in such conditions creates a richer living experience, ya know? Like, I get to be more intertwined with the culture of the average person while making it my own.” is how he nonsensically explained it.

The hotel was one of the nicest I’d been in. The room was spacious and there was thankfully a wall between my bedroom and the couch he was sleeping on. All details he wanted me to make clear in my forced gratitude posts. As comfortable as the bed was I was not going to let my guard down around him for a second. On top of that, I was seriously not in the mood for a Tolc visit. Lane knocked on my door repeatedly and asked me to come out, but I never responded, turning on the TV when it got incessant. Eventually needing to turn up the volume as he made unsavory sounds and comments.

“Yeah, that’s right, I am good! Oh, yes your great too, just r-“

Once I started hearing him say things like that I knew to burry it.

I’m currently still in the hotel, Land has thankfully fallen asleep. I’m somehow more stressed than ever. The possibility that my life will be this difficult until I rot away is getting at me even more now. I don’t know where, or who to turn to at this point. I know I can’t give up, but a life full of weirdos like Lane and literal demons, on top of the normal challenges of every day, well it's easy to spiral. I don’t want to lose my mind, or my will to live, but the life I’m fighting for is hard to glamorize, to say the least. Regardless, there is someone I’d like to thank who actually deserves it, and that’s my brother.

I don’t know if he can hear me, but if he can, I want to remind him that he’s still one of the best things in my life. He may be gone physically, but memories of his strength from fighting his literal and metaphorical demons is the number one reason I am still here, in multiple ways. It’s unfair that his monster has outlived him, and likely will me. Death inches closer every day for everyone, but it’s steps are deafening to me. I love you Hafiz, and I will continue to try.
