Probably, I should start with our neighbour's abomination of a dog called Max. The goddamn animal had a beehive in place of brains, and spent most of his time turning Mrs. O'Connell's backyard into the other side of a moon. In itself it wasn’t much of a problem. But unfortunately for all involved, Max also happened to be one of those dogs that bark at everything ever: falling leaves, cats, other dogs, birds, passing people, cars, and milkman and so on. Okay, I admit, I detested this mockery of a dog and I'm not a fan of terriers in general, but being a bark-o-mat isn't enough to deserve what happened to Max. His mistress is quite another matter. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

My wife Emilia had asked Mrs. O’Connell nicely  
to do something about Max I think around a million times or so. But Nora had always been a nasty piece of work wrapped in several layers of a falsely sweet passive-aggressive poison. "Dearest Maxy", in her opinion, was a tiny innocent puppy who obviously could do no wrong. But in reality put everything in place.

It was wonderful evening in the merry month of May. Our youngest - Rory -  had this "how about I grow myself three teeth at once" business going on so we all barely spelt several days prior. Max was relatively busy chasing some very unfortunate squirrels and (as I suspect) was too much out of breath to make noise. So day was pretty quiet ad Rory finally went to sleep about three. But either squirrels found a way to outsmart him or he got tired of this game, but around twenty minutes past three a hurricane of barks started. Max sounded as if he was trying to protect his "beloved human mother" from the Lambtom Worm who, in all his ugly glory, decided to crawl from a garden hose right in front of him.

I was making dinner (or at least was trying to) and our elder twin girls, Shea and Clodagh were playing dolls in the living room. when Rory started crying upstairs. Next I heard the door slamming and then Emie's footsteps thundering in the hall. She came to me, handled me Rory, then stomped away. One more door slam. Rory and I exchanged glances. He seemingly was too surprised to cry. I sighed, turned off the stove and moved the casserole on the cold hob. Girls carefully peaked into kitchen.

\- Where do you think mommy is going? - asked Clodagh.

\- I think - to do something bad to Mrs. O'Connell, - shrugged Shea.

\- Well, I'm sure they will solve this misunderstanding like respectable ladies they both are, - to be fair, not that I believed much in such outcome myself. And I was right, because in twenty minutes the door bell rung. I went to see if Emilia has returned.

Instead I have found her younger brother Liam at my porch. Who kindly informed me of two things: First, my wife broke her hand punching certain woman named Nora in the face. Second, as a garda officer he met some nasty people but Mrs. O'Connell in his opinion was a work of art.

Well, what can I say, I had some stories to tell.

\*\*\*

So fast forward three weeks. I was sitting in the living room, typing like a madman on my laptop. I'm a journalist for our local newspaper, you see, and I have always taken pride in finishing my articles on time, come hell or high water.

Laptop was showing exactly half past midnight when I pressed "save", then opened email and composed a short letter to our editor Aoife, attached the file, and sent it. Then I finally got to stretch my back. All was quiet. I walked to the window and made my best to close it as slowly and quietly as I could. Our house is old. By old, I mean "had been here for about a four hundred year at minimum". And the last major renovation was done about fifty years ago. So the window sash, you see, makes a faint screeching sound if you try to move it. Not loud enough to be unpleasant for a human ear but certainly loud enough for a dog.

I made a deep breath and pulled the sash. Normally Max would have started howling like a banshee  who'd been hit with a brick between her eyes, if Emilia or I were stupid enough to close a window at the wrong pace. But that night was filled with insect buzz, songs of birds in the distance, gentle susurration of flower bushes in the garden, and nothing more. Not a peep from our neighbour's "sweet puppy". In the retrospect, this alone should have clued me in that something was not right, but hindsight is always  twenty-twenty.

I went to the guest room where my cousin Snowy was sleeping. The window was open wide. If Snowy wants to freeze in peace – fine. But in her dwelling or in a hotel, please. And not here, when my daughters fell asleep in the same room. Seems like, Shea fell asleep in the carpet while hugging a plush animal. It was a sort of black and white –presumably- a fox in a hat. I frowned – Emilia must have being in a gothic mood when she bought this one. Meanwhile, Clodagh slept on the bed like a proper lady, while her favourite doll, Rosy, stared at me with intense but silent judgment while I made sure the window was locked.

I pretended to blow a raspberry at the doll and went further around the house to close the rest of windows.  All was well. Time to meet Morpheus too, I decided.  But when I started climbing the stairs I have noticed that an ox-eye window which is pretty far up the wall was slightly opened. But when I got to the top of the stairs to get a better look, it was closed like it had always been.

\- Wonderful. Taking games of light for a real deal, - I muttered under my breath. - Go to sleep, Colm, you moron.

Then I brushed my teeth, washed my face with cold water, and went to bed. But soon I understood that without Emilia by my side I can't sleep. It wasn't the first time we were apart since we got married, but two weeks is a pretty long time. What comes about Emie - she was planning to visit her sisters who lived in Dublin. Moira and Siobhan were extremely excited to meet the newest family addition So I didn't expect them to come back until next weekend. But you see Emie left me a list of things she wanted me to do in her absence. And at the bottom of it was "do something with that the god damn fridge". And it was the last thing from the list I still didn't manage to do yet.

I was tossing and turning for ten or so minutes. Eventually the overwhelming thought "why not to  unfreeze that old piece of metal junk in the basement?" won. The "old piece of metal junk" has been sitting there for over a year, and probably had more mold than ice at this point. So to the basement I went.

If you must know, the aforementioned refrigerator was manufactured somewhere around early 1970s. It was bright red at some point, made a sound louder than hydroturbine, and looked like so brutal it could probably survive a thousand more years without electricity just on pure hatred of ozon layer alone. I turned it off, threw a bunch of towels on the floor to catch the water from melting ice. But it didn't seem to be a good solution. And then I recalled a word of sage advice from my grandfather that chisel works best when used together with a hammer. Why thank you grandpa!

Breaking ice with aforementioned tools brought me a good deal of satisfaction. Half an hour later I managed to clean up half of the uppermost shelf. When I hit the wall of ice last time, it broke in pieces. And that’s when I saw them — half a dozen of small, strange fruits, sitting against the back wall of the  freezer. They looked like fat little stars, with thick glossy white skin. Their smell was like nothing I have ever encountered before - faintly sour with a hint of spicy notes and an oddly metallic aftertaste. And the worst? They reeked worse than spoiled onions. One word: disgusting.

I concluded that probably the previous owner of the fridge just forgot about them. There are a lot of  exotic fruits out there, but I'm bad at botany so I couldn't identify them. So I made a photo of them to  
check later what they were, then put on rubber gloves, put them into a plastic bag and tossed into the trash, assuming they were rotten, because the smell was starting to give me a headache.

Fast forward to this morning, I woke up because girls were shaking me, screaming “There are jungles outside, daddy!” Still groggy, I stumbled out of bed and walked towards the window, expecting to see some sort of a prank. I was greeted by the view of a giant lace-like death cap that was covering the view entirely.

\-What on earth is this?! - I turned to ask twins for more details but girls have already run to wake up Snowy.

I sighed, put on some clothes and went downstairs. It must be an elaborate prank by some tiktok-addicted teenagers, right? Wrong. Because when I opened the back door reality hit me with a power of steam hammer.

The sight was utter bewildering: where once had been our garden with neatly arranged flower beds, a dozen of gooseberry bushes and several pear trees now was a vast and unrecognizable wild expanse. The ground beneath the dense foliage was hidden beneath a carpet of blue-green moss. Unfamiliar bright flowers peeked out here and there. Vines as thick as my arm were hanging from the branches; their leaves dark and glossy as if they had been coated in vanish. Bushes, once sparse and well-spaced, were now replaced with towering trees that covered sky above our house. The air was saturated with a rich scent of blooming plants. A faint hum was coming from the depths of the thicket.

I closed the door and make several steps back. I counted to ten and opened it again. The same forest. Still there. I swallowed and closed the door. After that I turned around and nearly screamed when I bumped into Snowy who looked like a very drowsy ghost.

\- Colm, you are shaking. What's the matter? – Snowy gave me an amused look. - Do I look this bad?

\- You look... a little rumpled. Also there are jungles in the backyard.

\- Oh good. Are there any mangoes?

\- Holy smokes, woman, god knows what is going on here, and you are asking me, are there any mangoes?!

\- I like them. Now move, - she gestured me to clear the way and swung the door open. After inspecting the view, making several pictures and videos, she closed the door,  then locked it:

\- Well, these are not the literal jungles. That's a closer to a temperate rainforest. Ask that botanist next door. I think he should know better. However, I'm certain this forest has no mangoes and that's am pity. Also, - she pointed her phone at me. - How about we check the front door?

No sooner said than done, we were there. I pulled the handle. The outside was just fine. Nothing unusual and no signs things being out of place: people strolled peacefully, enjoying the fresh air; сolorful cottages with bright flowers in window boxes lined the sides of road, while lush green trees shade the sidewalk (exactly in places where they had always been); spring flowers like daffodils and bluebells added vibrant splashes of color; the occasional clatter of a bicycle or sounds of passing cars just added to the feeling of normalcy.

\- Lovely morning, Colm! - came the voice from the nearby ferns, then my friend and neighbor Donall emerged with a broad grin spread across his face. Don is an avid botanist. He is the happiest when he can spend his days studying plants or telling people about plants. Though, his plot of land also looked normal. What in Don's case means a lot of overgrown old trees and the abundance of ferns.

\- Hey, Don! - I considered potential ideas for a moment then it dawned on me. - Why don't you come inside? We need to talk about some…ugh… botanical matters.

Donall chuckled, brushing fronds from his jacket as he followed me into the house.

Sound of the whistling kettle calmed my nerves a little. Girls were at the table, eating scrambled eggs and this horrible Russian dish that looks like a meat jelly. Meanwhile Snowy herself was moving around with a grace of a drunken zombie ballerina. I am still not sure how she managed to put a kettle on a stove, let alone made a scramble, all by herself. She wobbled and almost fell down, but Don caught her. Only placement of his hands happened to be... ahem... a little awkward. But Snowy, bless her heart, only thanked him as Don carefully put her on a chair.

\-  Sorry, I should have been more careful. Also, gentlemen, what’s going on?

 We settled at the table. I turned on the TV. It worked just fine but not one channel showed the news. Now that was suspicious to say the least. I decided that morning has been eventful enough and switched the channel. At least on this one "Barbie of Swan Lake" was playing. Girls got momentary glued to the screen.

I lowered my voice and gave Don all the juicy details of what I have seen by far. But just talking about it gave me a headache.

\- You know, I might have an idea or two about - I rubbed my temples. – I have finally cleaned that old fridge this night. And found some strange fruits in a freezer.

Don leaned forward:

\- Show me what you have, - I showed him photos.

\- Please tell me you still have them around.

\- Well, I have thrown these creepy fat stars in the trash. To my defense: I thought they were rotten.

\- I suppose, you two are going trashcan diving, - comforted us Snowy in her usual manner. - It's not like you have much choice in the matter if you wanted them back.

Backyard still was overtaken by vegetation but it was nowhere as bad as earlier. Seems like most of plants now have retreated, as if out of politeness, behind the old stone fence, around a hundred or so feet away. Thankfully, trashcans were on their usual place and for some reasons were untouched by this madness of flora. And after a bit of digging, I've found a crumpled plastic bag containing these tree-spawns.

\-Ah-ha! - I exclaimed and showed my catch to Don.

\- Let's see what we've got here... - he put his hand into the bag. - Oh! This one fills heavier than the rest!

He got one of the fruits out. It was the fattest looking “star”.  We went back into the kitchen. Don put the the fruit on a counter, examined it closely, and then took out his pocket knife. With meticulous care, my friend sliced into it. As the ghostly white skin split open, we saw the insides. I swear I could never think that plants could get this bizarre. Its flesh was oddly-labyrinthine, dark deep burgundy-red, smooth  
and firm like a marinated egg. And caverns of this labyrinth were filled with things even more bizarre: they resembled tiny humanoid embryos: pale pink, half-formed, semi-transparent and underdeveloped, their features still in the making. But each had four peculiar protrusions from their backs, gossamer and fragile-looking, as if stuck between gemstones and stained glass. Blackened blood forever stopped in spider web of minuscule veins.

\-What in the name of Demetra..?! - Don whispered. He was as baffled as I was. - This is way, way out of my field of expertise.

We  stared at the fruit-born creature. It was clear that we needed to show this to someone with a better understanding of the zoological world. But before we could do anything, the hum outside grew ear-crushingly loud.
