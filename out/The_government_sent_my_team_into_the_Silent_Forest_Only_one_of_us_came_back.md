I’d been working for the agency long enough to know when I was being fed a sanitized version of the truth. But when they briefed me about this particular operation, it didn’t matter how much they polished it up, something about it stank. I’m a Case Officer in charge of handling…let’s just say, unusual projects. I’d been on missions that bordered on the insane, but nothing had prepared me for what I encountered.

The operation started as a civilian scientific investigation. Typical university stuff. A team of researchers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks had discovered a section of dense, remote forest somewhere on the outskirts of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. Unlike the rest of the vast wilderness, this particular part of the forest was different. It wasn’t just quiet; it was completely void of all sound. No birds, no wind rustling the leaves, no sign of wildlife. And according to the university, this eerie quietness was more than an oddity, it was scientifically impossible.

The university research team went out on a 7 day expedition to study the silent forest. When they missed their pickup time, the university reported them missing and requested the help of search and rescue teams. When the reports hit the upper echelons of government, we were brought in. The silence wasn’t just affecting wildlife. Communication devices didn’t work properly. No signals of any kind. GPS systems became erratic the moment anyone stepped foot inside the forest. Naturally, this raised all sorts of alarms for people like me, the kind of people tasked with ensuring things that shouldn’t exist stay off the public radar.

A new team was assembled, one that included me, security personnel, and a forest ecologist with decades of field experience: Dr. Jacob Holt.

Dr. Holt wasn’t some tree-hugging academic. He had spent twenty years studying environmental shifts in some of the most inhospitable places on Earth; forests, jungles, the Arctic. When I first met him, he looked the part. He was rugged, weathered, with rough skin from spending most of his life outdoors. His piercing eyes told me he was one of those men who wouldn’t break easily. Someone who had seen things.

We were joined by two operators, Masters and Greaves, there to provide security. They were the muscle, here to protect us from anything we may run into in that forest. Their faces were unreadable as they stood at attention by the helicopter, decked out in tactical gear that looked more suited for a war zone than a forest expedition.

I shook Dr. Holt’s hand as we loaded into the chopper. “You’ve been briefed?” I asked.

“Only enough to know that this forest is unlike anything I’ve ever seen,” he replied. His voice had that quiet confidence that came from years of experience. 

As the helicopter’s rotors roared and we ascended into the skies, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was the beginning of something that I wasn’t prepared for.

The ride was uneventful, the view beneath us a sea of endless forest stretching in every direction. The place where we were headed was so remote, there weren’t even trails leading into it. No one had any business being out there. And yet, here we were, flying straight into the heart of it.

When we landed at the drop zone, Masters and Greaves fanned out, securing the perimeter while we gathered our gear. There was no wind, no sound except for the hum of the chopper’s blades and the dull thuds of our boots on the soft ground.

The pilot gave us a nod, signaling he’d be back in 48 hours. I raised a hand in acknowledgment, and then the helicopter rose back into the sky, its roar shrinking into a faint hum before disappearing completely. 

Once the helicopter was out of sight, the silence hit us fully. It was immediate. Absolute. The kind of silence that presses in on you, makes your ears strain for any noise, any sign of life. But there was nothing. There was no sign of the university research team.

“Ready?” I asked Holt as we looked toward the forest.

He nodded, squinting into the tree line. “I’ve seen a lot of forests, but none like this.” Holt adjusted the straps on his pack, glancing at the forest surrounding us. “Welcome to the quietest place on Earth.”

The forest was dense, dark, and unwelcoming. Based on the university team’s expedition plan, we were able to determine their campsite was about 12 kilometers from our drop zone. Their camp was our first planned target.

I glanced at Dr. Holt, who was already focused on the forest ahead, his expression unreadable. Masters and Greaves seemed unfazed; their weapons held casually but ready.

Holt pointed toward the trees. “We go in, keep a close formation. If anyone hears anything strange, sees anything out of place, speak up. We’re not just dealing with a lack of sound here.”

“What do you mean?” Greaves asked.

“I mean, nature doesn’t just turn off,” Holt replied. “No, there is something causing this.”

We ventured into the forest, the thick canopy blotting out much of the daylight overhead.

I’ve been in some eerie places before, and dealt with some unexplainable things. But this… this was different. I wasn’t sure what I had expected, but the absolute silence that engulfed me wasn’t it.

“Sure is something else, isn’t it?” Holt said quietly as he walked next to me. He didn’t have to raise his voice. There was no other noise to drown out our conversation, no chirping birds, no rustle of the wind through trees. 

I nodded. Masters and Greaves moved with precision and purpose. Masters, the taller of the two, had that sort of casual confidence that only came with experience. Greaves seemed more skeptical, methodical, his sharp gaze scanning the forest as we walked.

But even they, hardened as they were, seemed unsettled by the unnatural stillness.

We walked all day before we made camp at the edge of a clearing, just inside the tree line. Masters and Greaves busied themselves setting up a perimeter, their footsteps muffled by the thick, spongey forest floor. No one spoke much. We were all unnerved by the unnatural quiet, even though none of us would admit it. My own thoughts felt too loud in my head, and I found myself straining to hear any sign of life.

There wasn’t any.

“Tell me, Holt,” I said as we unpacked our gear, breaking the silence. “What exactly did the university team report before they went off-grid?”

Holt crouched down to check his instruments, the faint scratching of his pen against the paper sounding oddly loud. “The initial team detected an acoustic anomaly in this region. No natural sound. It drew their attention because areas like this don’t exist naturally. At least, not for long. Animals move in, wind passes through, water flows. Something always fills the space.”

“And here, nothing,” I said, stating the obvious.

He nodded. “They sent back some preliminary data showing that the forest was absorbing sound at a rate that defied explanation. Then... their transmissions became garbled. They went radio silent three days ago. The university was funding pure research. When it got weird, you all stepped in.”

“Great.” I looked around at the silent, still forest. “So, any guesses?”

Holt was quiet for a moment, glancing at the trees, his eyes narrowed in thought. “I don’t know. This isn’t my usual area of expertise. I’m a biologist, not an acoustician, but... there’s something wrong here. The air pressure feels... off. Almost like we’re underwater, but without the sensation of depth.”

Masters joined us at the fire pit, sitting on a log he had dragged over. “Feels like we’re in a bubble,” he said, his voice flat. “The air feels heavy.”

I nodded. I had felt it too, a weird density to the space, like the air was pressing in on us.

Greaves was pacing the perimeter, checking the motion sensors he had set up. He came over, his face grim. “Nothing on the scanners, no heat signatures. No wildlife.”

“No movement at all?” I asked.

“Not even a squirrel,” he said, shaking his head. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”

We settled into an uneasy silence. The silence made it hard to focus, hard to carry on a conversation. Time seemed to stretch, and the usual sounds of a camp weren’t there to ground us. I checked my watch. It felt like we had been on the ground much longer than we had. It was as if time had slowed along with the sound.

As night fell, we set up our tents and tried to settle in. Night came quickly in the forest, swallowing the weak daylight with urgency. The silence became even more intense in the darkness.

Lying in my tent, I could hear my own heartbeat, loud and consistent in my ears. But beyond that, there was nothing. No nocturnal animals stirring. It was unnatural.

That night, I struggled to sleep.

I don’t know how long I lay there, my mind racing in the silence, but at some point, I became aware of something else. The sound was subtle at first, then grew louder. It didn’t come from the outside, but from within.

I could hear my own breathing. I could hear my blood pulsing through my veins, the creak of my joints when I moved. It was like my body had become amplified; every internal sound magnified in the absence of external noise.

I tried to shake it off, but the longer I lay there, the worse it got. The absolute silence mixed with the sound of my bodily functions made me feel nauseous. I could feel something, a strange pressure, like something was trying to squeeze out every sound, including the ones inside of me. It made me feel ill.

When I finally managed to drift off, it wasn’t restful. My dreams were fragmented, filled with flashes of the forest, its trees towering over me, and a constant, suffocating silence pressing in from all sides.

The next morning, we gathered around the campfire, though now, it gave off no sound. I glanced at the others, but no one commented on it. I couldn’t remember for sure, but I could have sworn I could hear the fire the night before. In the morning though, the fire was silent. No gentle crackling, nothing. Just silent flames.

“Did anyone sleep well?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.

Holt rubbed his eyes, shaking his head. “It’s strange. I’ve spent weeks in forests before, but last night... I could hear everything inside me. My heart, my lungs, my joints. It was like the silence turned inward.”

Greaves and Masters exchanged glances but said nothing.

“We need to keep moving,” I said, pulling out the map. “The university team set up their main camp about five clicks east of here. If we’re going to find any answers, that’s where we’ll start.”

We packed up and began moving, determined to cover ground and get to the campsite. But the further we went, the more oppressive the silence became. It wasn’t just an absence of sound, it felt like something was trying to actively pull the sound from us.

Holt stopped every now and then to take samples or examine the flora, but there wasn’t much to find. The trees were all the same; tall, ancient, and perfectly still. No leaves rustled, no branches creaked.

At one point, Greaves signaled for us to stop. He crouched down, scanning the area with a thermal scope. “Still nothing,” he muttered. “No movement, no heat signatures. It’s like the whole forest is dead.”

“It’s not dead,” Holt corrected, stepping forward. “It’s like it's.. frozen. Nothing is growing, Nothing is dying. Everything is just staying as it is.”

I didn’t like the sound of that.

As we continued, I started to notice something else. It was subtle at first, but the more I focused on it, the clearer it became. Our footsteps were no longer making any sound. I could see Masters and Greaves stepping on twigs, leaves, even rocks, but there was no crunch, no snap. Just silence.

I stomped my boot against a fallen branch. It broke in half. Nothing. Not even the dullest of cracks.

“What the hell...” I muttered.

Holt noticed it too. He knelt down, pressing his hand to the ground. “The forest is absorbing the sound.”

“Absorbing?” Masters asked, looking unsettled for the first time. “What do you mean?”

Holt stood, wiping his hands on his pants. “Sound isn’t just vanishing. It’s being taken. Consumed, absorbed, somehow.”

“How? By what?” I asked.

Holt didn’t answer, his face puzzled. “I don’t know yet.”

By midday, we reached the university team’s base camp. The tents were still standing, but there was no sign of life. No tracks, no bodies. It was as if the team had simply vanished.

“Check the perimeter,” I ordered Masters and Greaves. They nodded and moved off without a word.

Holt and I stepped into the largest tent, which looked like a makeshift lab. There were papers scattered on the table, notebooks filled with data and observations. Holt sifted through them; his brow furrowed.

“They were studying the absorption,” he said quietly, flipping through the pages. “Measuring sound absorption rates, cataloging how far the phenomenon goes.”

“And what did they find?”

Holt shook his head. “It doesn’t make sense. The silence, it looks like it’s growing. Expanding, like a living thing.”

He handed me one of the notebooks, and I scanned the pages. The last few entries were scribbled hastily, as if written in a rush.

*Day 5: We can’t hear each other anymore. Even when we shout, it’s like the sound is being swallowed before it leaves our mouths. Something’s wrong. The silence is getting into our heads.*

*Day 6: It’s inside me. I can’t hear my own thoughts.*

I flipped through the notebook, feeling the weight of those final words.

*It’s inside me. I can’t hear my own thoughts.*

“What does that mean?” I muttered, looking up at Holt. His face was pale, his usual scientific detachment crumbling slightly.

“It’s like,” he began slowly, “that the absorption, it’s something physical. They lost the ability to talk, to hear themselves think. That’s why their notes are scattered like this, incomplete. They weren’t just losing sound; they were losing their minds.”

Outside, Masters and Greaves returned, shaking their heads. “Nothing,” Masters said, keeping his voice low, as if afraid the silence might swallow it if he spoke too loudly. “No signs of life. No bodies.”

I felt a cold knot of dread tighten in my stomach. “Well, they had to go somewhere.”

“Or something took them,” Greaves added grimly, his hand resting on his rifle.

Holt was still scanning the notebooks, his eyes darting from one entry to another, but I could tell he was growing more unsettled with every page. “We need to go back. We need to start moving back toward the landing zone,” he said, almost to himself. “There’s more going on here than I thought.”

We began to make the push back in the direction of our pickup zone. The sun was already low, but we couldn't afford to lose time, or worse, our minds. Something about this place gnawed at me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, even though every logical part of me knew we weren’t. There hadn’t been a single movement or thermal signature since being there. Nothing lived here. Nothing except the trees, and the silence.

Masters and Greaves moved ahead, keeping to their training, alert but calm. Holt and I walked behind them, the silence between us growing heavier with each step. We watched our footsteps, the sound of the crunching of our boots on the forest floor absent. It was as if we were walking through some sort of vacuum, where sound wasn’t just deadened, it was annihilated.

“Dr. Holt,” I said, breaking the silence. “You said earlier that something was consuming sound. What could do that?”

He didn’t answer at first, his eyes scanning the dense, towering trees around us. When he finally spoke, his voice was low, like he didn’t want to hear his own words. “This is something that defies natural explanation. It reminds me, you know, of those anechoic chambers, the rooms designed to eliminate sound reflections. But this... this is something else. It’s as if the forest itself is alive and feeding on the sound waves.”

“Alive?” I echoed. “Like, the trees?”

“No, not just the trees,” Holt said, his gaze narrowing. “The entire ecosystem, or what used to be an ecosystem. Something changed here, and now it’s drawing sound into itself. The silence, it’s almost… predatory. Detecting new sounds and then eliminating them.”

A chill ran down my spine at his words. I had dealt with all kinds of dangerous situations before, but this was different. It wasn’t something I could shoot or punch. It was something you couldn’t even see or hear, something that was stripping us down, one layer at a time.

That night, the silence became unbearable.

We set up our tents in a small clearing, each of us going through the familiar motions of setting up camp, but there was no comfort in the routine. 

After dinner, if you could call it that, given how none of us seemed to have an appetite, I sat by the fire, staring into the flames. The fire should’ve been comforting, a reminder of normality. But even it felt wrong. I could see the flames flickering, but there was no crackling, no popping of wood.

I looked over at Masters and Greaves, who were sitting by their tent, checking on their gear. I could tell they were on edge. They were trained to expect danger, but this was different. This was something you couldn’t fight.

Then I glanced at Holt, who was sitting a few feet away, scribbling notes into his journal. His face was tight with concentration, his eyes flicking back and forth between the pages and the surrounding forest. He had said earlier that the silence was expanding, but he hadn’t elaborated. Now, I began to wonder if he knew more than he was letting on.

The silence pressed in on me, like a physical weight on my chest. It was hard to breathe, hard to think. I could feel my pulse in my throat, the steady thud of my heart sounding louder and louder in my own head. And then, just like the night before, I could hear every sound inside my body again.

First, it was my breathing, deep, slow inhales that felt unnaturally loud. Then my heartbeat, each thump echoing in my ears like a drum. I could hear the blood running through my veins, the creaking of my joints, even a low gurgle of my stomach. It was as if my body had become a machine, and every function was amplified.

I looked over at Masters and Greaves, and I could see from the way they fidgeted that they were feeling it too. Greaves’ fingers drummed lightly against his thigh, his eyes darting around the camp, as if trying to find something, anything, that made noise.

But there was nothing. Nothing except our bodies.

Holt closed his notebook and set it down beside him. “This place is... wrong,” he said softly, as if to himself.

“Care to elaborate?” I said, growing impatient with his explanations.

He hesitated, then sighed. “Us. The sound of our voices, the noise of our bodies, our footsteps. It’s like we’re being devoured, one sense at a time, one sound at a time.”

That night, sleep was impossible. The sound of my body wasn’t just unsettling anymore; it was becoming unbearable.

At some point, I drifted off, but when I woke up, I had no idea how much time had passed. I sat up in my tent, my head pounding, my mouth dry. I glanced at my watch only to find a blank display.

That’s when I realized something else. The sound in my head wasn’t from my heartbeat. It was something external, something rhythmic. Like... voices.

I threw open the tent flap and stepped out into the clearing. Holt, Masters, and Greaves were already up, standing at the edge of the camp, staring into the trees. Their faces were pale, their eyes wide with fear.

“Do you hear that?” Masters whispered, his voice trembling.

I strained my ears, trying to catch whatever sound had shaken them. For a second, there was nothing, just the oppressive silence that had become our constant companion. But then, faintly, I heard it: a soft sound, like whispers, coming from deep within the forest.

But it didn’t make sense. We hadn’t heard a single noise coming from anything else, natural or otherwise, since we’d arrived. No birds, no wind, not even insects. But now, in the dead of night, something was whispering out there.

“What the hell is that?” Greaves muttered.

“No idea,” I said, stepping closer to them. I glanced at Holt, hoping for some kind of rational explanation, but he was just as frozen as the rest of us, staring into the trees like a man staring at the abyss.

“I... I don’t know,” Holt stammered, which was unsettling in itself. He was supposed to be the expert, the scientist. The man with the answers. But now, he looked like a scared child.

The whispers grew louder, more defined. They were slow, deliberate, as if whatever was making them was aware of us and taking its time, savoring our fear.

Masters raised his rifle, aiming it toward the trees, but I knew, deep down, that bullets wouldn’t do a damn thing here. Whatever was out there, it wasn’t something we could shoot. It wasn’t something that bled.

Suddenly, the whispers stopped.

The silence returned with a vengeance, heavier than before. It pressed against my eardrums, suffocating, almost as if it were trying to crush us.

“We need to move,” I said, my voice shaky but firm. “Get out of here now.”

Masters and Greaves didn’t need convincing. They grabbed their gear without a word, their movements jerky and frantic. Holt, though, hesitated. He was still staring at the tree line, his brow furrowed.

“This is... impossible,” he murmured. “This silence... It’s, it’s…”

“Holt, we don’t have time for this,” I snapped, grabbing his arm. “We need to go.”

Reluctantly, he let me pull him away, but I could tell that his mind was racing, trying to wrap itself around what we were experiencing. And that’s what scared me the most. If the smartest man here couldn’t make sense of this, what chance did the rest of us have?

We packed up camp in record time, each of us moving with a sense of urgency that bordered on panic. The silence around us seemed to thicken, growing more oppressive with every second. It was like walking through molasses. Every step felt heavy, like it took more effort than it should. 

I could barely hear my own thoughts. My internal monologue, the constant hum of my mind, was being drowned out, bit by bit, as if something was reaching into my head and muting it. I began having trouble forming basic thoughts. I glanced at the others and saw the same panic in their eyes. They were losing themselves too.

Holt was scribbling furiously in his notebook as we moved, his hand shaking as he tried to capture what was happening, but even his notes had grown erratic. Half-formed sentences, fragments of ideas, nothing coherent. It was as if we were all unraveling.

By the time we reached the next clearing, the silence had become something more than just an absence of sound. It was tangible, thick in the air like fog, and with it came the whispers again.

Only this time, they weren’t distant. They were close. Too close.

“Do you hear that?” Greaves whispered, his voice barely a breath.

I nodded, unable to speak. My throat felt tight, as if the silence itself was choking me. The whispers became louder, purposeful, as if whoever it was, or whatever it was, was out there toying with us.

“Move!” I hissed, grabbing Holt and pulling him along. We had to keep going. 

The whispers stopped again, but this time, so did everything else.

The air became still, and the weight of the silence crushed down on us with such intensity that I felt my knees buckle. And then, the real horror began.

My ears popped. It wasn’t like the dull, annoying sensation you get when you’re changing altitude. This was sharp and painful, like something was forcing its way inside. I clutched my head, wincing, but when I looked around, the others were experiencing it too. Masters was on his knees, his face twisted in pain, his hands pressed against his ears. Greaves was swaying on his feet, eyes wide with terror. Holt was shaking, blood trickling from his nose.

But it wasn’t the pain that scared me.

It was the realization that, for the first time since we’d entered the forest, I couldn’t hear anything. Not even my own body.

No heartbeat. No breath. No gurgle of my stomach. It was as if every sound, even the internal ones, had been snatched away.

I opened my mouth to speak, to shout, to scream, anything to break the silence, but no sound came out. I could feel my vocal cords straining, feel the air pushing out of my lungs, but no sound came out. Nothing.

I looked around at the others. Their mouths were moving, but no sound escaped. They were screaming too, but it was nothing but horrified faces and wordless cries, all swallowed by the silence.

We tried to communicate with our eyes, with gestures, but it was chaos. Greaves pointed wildly toward the trees, and I followed his gaze, my heart racing.

Something was moving.

It wasn’t whispering this time, it was shapes. Dark shapes barely visible against the backdrop of the forest. They flickered in and out of sight, like shadows caught between the trees.

I reached for my sidearm, but my hands were trembling so badly I could barely hold it. Beside me, Masters and Greaves did the same, but I knew it wouldn’t matter. Whatever was out there wasn’t something we could shoot.

We backed away, guns trained on the approaching shadows. Masters fired his rifle at the shadows, but it was pointless. I saw his muzzle flash, but no sound came out. It did nothing to stop the shadows from suddenly surrounding Dr. Holt, causing him to drop to his knees. 

Holt's notebook slipped from his hands and hit the ground, pages scattering. His eyes were wide, and his mouth moved in a silent scream. And then, he collapsed.

I don’t know how long we stood there, watching as Holt’s body was surrounded by shadows, swallowed by the silence. It was as if he had been absorbed into a void. And I knew, deep down, that the same fate awaited us.

I grabbed Masters by the shoulder and pointed toward the trees. He nodded, understanding what I couldn’t say. We had to get out of the forest. Now.

We took off running, our footsteps completely silent as we sprinted through the trees. I could feel my lungs burning, my legs screaming for rest, but I couldn’t hear it. I couldn’t hear anything.

Behind me, Greaves stumbled, falling to the ground. I turned back, reaching for him, but when I did, I realized that the shadows were surrounding him, closing in.

I knew that there was nothing I could do. I watched, helpless, as Greaves was swallowed by the silence, just like Holt.

Masters and I kept running. I didn’t know where we were going, if there even was a way out, but we had to try. We had to survive. But in the end, the silence always seemed faster.

I don’t know how I made it out. All I remember is running, feeling the crushing weight of the silence in my chest, in my mind, until it was all I knew. I kept running, and running, until eventually, somehow, I made it.  

But I was alone.

Masters was gone. Greaves was gone. Holt was gone.

I stumbled my way through the forest until finally, I burst through what felt like an invisible barrier, the perimeter where the silence, whatever it was, ended.

Suddenly, sound exploded back into existence: the wind, the rustle of leaves, the sound of insects, the distant call of a bird, and the sound of my own ragged breath. The sudden influx of sound overwhelmed my senses, nearly making me double over in a wave of headache and nausea. 

I had made it out, but I knew the horror lingered just behind me. I walked until my legs couldn’t take any more, before I stopped and set up a makeshift camp. I endured the cold for three more days, while I mentally wrestled with the memories of what had occurred. Eventually, I made my way to a high enough point to signal one of the search helicopters that had been hovering over the area after we had missed our 48-hour pickup time. The sound of the rotor blades was a sweet melody of hope, bringing me to safety away from the nightmare of that place.

But even now, as I sit here, writing this, I have trouble hearing my own thoughts. I’m terrified that maybe, just maybe, I brought a piece of that forest back with me. I’m terrified that somehow, it’s creeping in, eating away at me, slowly devouring every sound, every memory. 

I don’t know what the silence is. I don’t know what the shadows were. I don’t know what it wants. All I know is that it’s alive.

And it’s hungry.
