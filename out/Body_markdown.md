A blair, a blur? Yes, yes. A blairing, blinding, winding, winding stur. In my ears, in my skull. I am shaking, shuddering. It never ceases. Only increases. The whiring of metal. Tiny, tiny metal. But impossibly loud all at once. And yet I hear it. I must open my eyes.

I must close my eyes. Must not see, must not feel. Must not be, but have to be. Must open eyes to see.

A belt is before me. Not the type you rap around your waste or your neck. But the kind that moves things, that moves people into nations. A machine. A machine of rock and red. So much red. That's normal, right? There should be red left. Always red left. Because of the slidi-

The stone! That's right! The sto-

Never look that way!! Must never look that way. Everything of the nothing is that way!! 

Then a pop! Comes clarity. 

I open my eyes again. Had I closed them again? When did I close them again? Doesn't matter. Look around you. You need to look around you.

Low light, not completely dark or all that bright is all around me filling a concrete room. Perfectly measured. The low light is red. It's red, red upon the red. But atleast I can see it and all it illuminates. Aleast it's tangible and makes all around it tangible. Including the belt.

The belt is still before me. How dreadful... but I must go over it. I must overcome it and all the red I can see. 

It's wider than wanted. But can I not leap? I must stand upon my feet. Stand so that I may know! I'm still shaking and my legs are aching. But I must stand. I must stand. 
The ground is wet and grotesque; morbid the red is still splattered upon it and the belt that will not cease. Forever feeding the hungry stone as long as we are made to march on. Made to march on by the chairs behind the banners. Chairs of words as we march on in their stead. I will march no longer. I will leap!

It still eats. The stone always eats. The metal machine feeds it. I will not be food. Pacing back on the sticky, slick floor, I must give myself enough room. Enough room to leap. 5,4, 10 paces. 3, two more. I must make it. Must have room, home is calling. I will not march on! Then I ran, ran faster than my feet had ever taken me in my life. Ran faster to that life. All river of red clinging to the bottom of my soles with every step. I must go home!! Home is calling. I leap... hands and upper body touching the other side. But the metal is ever clingy. The tiny metal sting. Dragging me in. Dragging me towards so called "progress". Red from the low light, red from the-

The sliding stone. With all the red and the human rocks. Tiny, tiny rocks. So loud. Never ceasing. Only increasing.  First my feet, then my legs as a treat. Before the hungry rock eats the rest of me as a whole. Then a pop! Then comes the nothing.

They marched on! They marched on!! Why did they march on?! Why did they leave me?! I'm on the ground, bleeding. My eyes are open. I look around. Their bodies surround me.
Their eyes unblinking. White, and clouded. Their countries banners in tow .

The sliding stone. We marched down. Til we hit the ground. Red all around. Body, mark down.
