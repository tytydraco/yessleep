I knew I was in trouble when I woke up naked in a bathtub full of bloody water, note on my chest and pain in both of my sides. 

I don’t own a bathtub, and if I did, I wouldn’t sleep in it.  What kind of an idiot would sleep in a fucking bathtub?  Let’s just say when you got a California king mattress from Casper, you aren’t grabbing your z’s in the backup toilet.

Anyway, where was I?  That’s what I asked myself, cause it sure as fuck wasn’t my house.  I looked at my fingers, they were all pruny and gross looking, so I must have been there a while.  And my sides hurt.  Hurt like the time my ex and I went to a Crazy Town concert and I got thrown into the railing.  It’s a long story, but hey, I got to hear Shifty shout me out on stage.

I gave myself a feel.  Sides burned like a motherfucker when I touched them.  Looked like a couple inches of stitches on each of my sides.  I looked down, the water was cold, not like bucket of ice cold, but it was below room temperature, so don’t be fuckin’ judging.  

The note had been taped to my chest, folded up in thirds.  I figured a chick did that, they’re always into fancy flourishes.  I racked my brain trying to think of a chick last night.  None rang a bell, but it wouldn’t be the first time I woke up with a surprise.  Maybe she was fixing breakfast.

I untaped the note and gave it a look.  Hotel stationary for the Workman’s Inn.  Where the fuck was that?  The note said:

*Your kidneys have been removed.*  

*Do not seek medical attention.*

*Do not contact the police.*

*Get dressed and get your phone.*

*You have less than eight hours.*

Ok, whatever hussy I picked up last night was playing a real rib on me.  Maybe we did some role playing, it ain’t my thing, but I’m not gonna yuck a yum or whatever the fuck they said five years ago.  Just wish I could remember.

I braced my arms on each side of the tub and tried to lift myself up.  As soon as I put some exertion into it, pain ripped through my sides and I landed my ass back down, red water splashed over the top.  I clutched my sides and yelled.  

“Hey!  Jokes over!  Come in here and gimme a fuckin' hand!”

I listened for a sign of another person beyond the closed bathroom door.  Nothing but cars on a distant road.

I sat in the tub and tried to piece together the last things I remembered.  I’d got off work.  I went to the grocery store to buy a rotisserie chicken from the deli.  I ate the chicken in the car on my drive home.  Same as usual.  But then it was all a blank.  One minute I’m listening to the Mad Dog, and the next I’m getting pickled in my own blood, and probably sitting about 5 pounds lighter, or however fuckin’ much a kidney weighs.

They didn’t actually take my shit did they?  I felt along the stitches again.  How big was a fuckin’ kidney anyway?  What the fuck do kidneys do?  Brits eat ‘em, so they must do some gross shit.

I was lost in my own thoughts, when the tinny sound of Headstrong started playing.  

“Ah fuck, my phone!”  I exclaimed to the empty bathroom.  Someone was calling me, which means my phone was close by.  Sounded like by the sink.  

I braced myself and carefully stood up.  Clamato colored water dripped off my body and I felt cold.  I was cold OK, so don’t be fuckin’ judging.  I took a towel and wrapped it around myself, gingerly stepping onto the cold wet floor.

The phone went silent by the time I found it laying in the sink, another folded note under it.  One missed call from a blocked number.  I tried to unlock the screen but it wouldn’t recognize my face.  Shaking fingers tried my passcode several times but it kept saying it was incorrect.

I was pissed, so I dropped the phone in the sink and took the note.

*Your phone has been disabled.*

*You cannot call or text.*

*If it rings, answer immediately.*

*Do not contact the police.*

*Do not seek medical attention.*

*You have less than 7 hours to live.*

Now hold on a minute.  You can fuck with my kidneys or whatever the fuck, but you can’t be fuckin’ with my phone.  

I tried to unlock it again.  Nothing.  Fuck them, I know a trick or two when it comes to phones.  Holding the power button down for a few seconds the screen faded from black to dark black.  I adjusted my fingers on the button and held it down harder.  The little startup gimmick came up, before flashing to my home screen.  I tried unlocking it again.  

Nothing.  You know what?  Fuck these guys.

I hit the panic button thing a whole bunch and it brought up the emergency number line.  I hit 9 then 1 and was about to hit 1 again when the screen changed color and started buzzing as Trapt laid down the truth.

Incoming call from a blocked number.  Good time for some answers.

“Listen asshole, let me make a fuckin’ call, and did you take my fuckin’ kidneys?” I demanded.

“Do not contact the police.  Failure to comply with the written orders will result in your immediate death,”  a woman’s voice, informative sounding, she talked like she was smiling.  Sounded like one of those TikTok voice filter gimmicks.

“How about shut the fuck up?” I retorted.

“You are in immediate danger.  Please get dressed and proceed to the nearest gas station and purchase 5,000 dollars in Best Buy gift cards.  Await further instructions.  You have three minutes before hostile actors will be at your door.”

“Now wait a minute!  This is a fuckin’ phone scam?  Hit the bricks toots!”  I hung up.  

All right, I didn’t know what was going on, and the asshole AI lady on the phone was full of shit, but she had some good advice: I should get dressed, it was fuckin cold in here.

The bathroom opened to a standard hotel room.  King bed, professionally made.  On top, my pants and shirt were neatly folded and stacked, my shoes and socks beside.  No boxers?  Hmm, I musta been expecting to meet a floozy last night if I didn’t wear any.  

Unless they got damaged.  I’m a middle aged guy, full grown, and hey, shit happens.  We’ve all been there, wouldn’t be the first time, and it won’t be the last time.  If it hasn’t happened to you, you’re a liar.

I inspected my white t-shirt, one size too small to show off the guns, smelled fresh, felt clean.  Slacks were pressed, money clip in the back pocket, car keys in front, Ross’s belt in the loops, gold chain in the pocket, all smelled fine.  I was definitely headed to see someone.   

I was in the process of inspecting my socks when I heard a knock outside.  Not at the door, the window.  Looking around the room it seemed like a classy joint, but fuck knows the kind of riffraff that show up in a place like this at whatever time it was.

Another knock, maybe a clank.

The fuck time was it anyway?

I ignored whatever the fuck was going on outside and got my foot gear on when the door did an electric click gimmick and the handle turned.

“Hey, fuckin’ occupied here!”  I said.

The door opened, and a fuckin’ goofball was standing there, all dressed up like Duke The Dumpster Fuckin Droese with a stupid ratty fedora on.

“Listen pal, room’s taken, I’ll be outta here in minute then you can do whatever you want, but in the meantime fuck off.”

This fuckin goombah looks at me, cocks his head like he’s a stupid puppy trying to figure out the sound of a ball squeaking.  Then I swear to God, his eyes turned red, like red light fuckin' red.

He stepped through the door and charged.  My brain wasn’t exactly at full capacity from whatever the fuck was going on, but I knew enough to jump on the bed and rolled to the other side.

My sides screamed in pain as the stitches clawed against the skin.  The bum hit the bed at a dead run, both legs running into the side and he fell face first into the mattress.

Clenching my teeth through the pain I grabbed my phone and ran past him.  He struggled to lift himself, making electronic whirring and vibrating sounds like my ex’s sock drawer.  The mattress ripped as he gripped it, then the bed collapsed.  

Out the door I went, slamming it behind me.  I took a second to get my bearings.  As fancy as the interior was, the exterior was the shits.  Second story overlooking a poorly lit parking lot next to the road.  Where the fuck was I?  To my left was a bunch more shitty rooms, to my right was a burned-out exit sign, and two shabby looking fucks giving me the stare.  They both cocked their heads, then four red eyes were looking at me.

Fuck it, I thought.  I took off to the left.  I had a good 10 yard head start on them, but the sounds of heavy, and I mean fucking heavy, clomping stomps was catching me fast.  A crash of ripping metal and powdered cinder block.  I chanced a look behind and the dumbass from the room had busted the door off the hinges and joined the other two.

A few rooms down and the walkway turned, stairs a short dash away.  I took the stairs two at a time, ribs grinding against the stitches on my side.  The trio of chucklefucks had reached the top of the stairs as I was almost down, three steps to go I jumped for it, landed wrong and hard and faceplanted on the sidewalk.  Sides screaming in pain.  

I turned to the top of the stairs as I tried to get up, when the first one tripped on the second step, catching himself with his face and sliding down like a kid on a sled.  The second made it three steps and fell sideways, the third tripping on the thrashing body of the second.  That bought me some time, I thought, getting back to my feet and running toward the parking lot.

Keys in hand, I mashed the panic button.  Horn sounds and flashing lights around the corner.  My car!  Thank fuck.  It was backed in, under a shitty lot light, next to a creep van and an electrician's truck.  I hit the unlock button and ripped the door open, climbed in and punched the engine start button.  It fired up and I turned it to drive and was burning as much rubber as a late model Mazda can.  The stooges chasing me from my rear view mirror.  

I pulled onto whatever fucking road I was on and turned right and drove.  To say I was uncomfortable was an understatement.  My sides were both gushing blood now.  I opened the glovebox and got some McDonalds napkins and tried to stop from bleeding all over my seats.  For fuck sakes, the lease was almost up on this, how the fuck do you get blood out of upholstery?  I’ll have to call a guy.

The seat itself was off too.  Pushed forward like Tattoo had borrowed the thing.  The radio was tuned to the classical station, and the mirrors were all sorts of fucked up.  I started to suspect I had not driven myself there.  

My phone rang, the car automatically answered.

“Your navigation has been updated.  Follow the directions.  Drive directly to the Maverik station two miles ahead, purchase the gift cards, then return to your vehicle.  You have less than three hours to live,” same dopey female voice filter gimmick.

“Hey jabrone, you said I had seven like ten minutes ago,” I said.

“Your condition is deteriorating rapidly.  5,000 dollars.”

“Who the fuck were those guys?”

“Do not let them capture you.  You will be harmed greatly.  Stay away from the police.” 

The phone hung up, and the navigation screen told me I was a couple minutes away from the gas station.

I didn’t know what the fuck was going on.  I checked the rearview mirror one more time, nobody was following me.  I was safe for now.
