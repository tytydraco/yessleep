I can still remember the sharp chill of the water, the way it seemed to swallow every sound as I sank beneath the surface. I was only ten, and we were spending the weekend at the lake—one of those trips where the adults didn’t pay much attention as long as you were within shouting distance. My friends had dared me to swim out to the floating dock, the one tethered far off near the middle of the lake. I didn’t think twice about it. I was a strong swimmer. Or at least I thought I was.

At first, it was easy. The water felt cool, refreshing even, and I kept pushing forward, barely noticing how far I’d gone. But halfway there, something changed. My legs started to cramp, tightening up like knots beneath the water. I paused to catch my breath, but I couldn’t stay still. The water was pulling at me, like invisible hands gripping my ankles, dragging me under.

I tried to swim harder, but my arms felt heavy, like weights attached to my body. I called out, but my voice sounded thin, swallowed up by the distance and the water. The dock was still far off, a speck on the horizon that seemed to shrink the harder I swam. My chest tightened as panic set in, and for the first time in my life, I felt real fear. The kind that grips your throat and squeezes until you can’t think straight.

Then, suddenly, my head slipped under the surface.

I kicked hard, flailing, trying to break free, but it was no use. The water closed over me, a cold, suffocating silence. Everything above—my friends laughing, the sunlight glinting on the surface—faded into a dark blur. I tried to scream, but the water rushed into my mouth, cold and choking. My arms and legs felt like lead, useless, as I sank deeper.

I remember staring up at the surface, watching the light dim and flicker as I sank. The sunlight was just a murky haze, distorted by the water. My lungs burned, screaming for air, but there was none. Just the silence, the crushing weight of the water all around me.

I was sure that was it. That I was going to die.

Then, just when my vision started to blur, I felt something—an arm, strong and firm, grabbing me from behind. I didn’t know who it was at first. I was too disoriented, too weak. But they pulled me up, dragging me through the water, closer to the dock. My head broke the surface, and I gasped, choking and coughing up water, barely able to breathe.

We reached the dock, and I clung to the edge, my body trembling, too exhausted to speak. My friend, the one who had pulled me out, just stared at me wide-eyed, not saying a word. The others didn’t even realize what had happened. To them, it was just a game.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something else had been pulling me under. Something cold and unrelenting. Something that had wanted me to drown.

Even now, years later, I can’t shake the memory of those dark, icy hands around my legs, dragging me into the depths. I haven’t swum in a lake since. And I don’t think I ever will.
