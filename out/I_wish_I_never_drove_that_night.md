I didn’t mean to hit her.  

But let me start at the beginning. Let me tell you about the bar.  

The Hollow Cork wasn’t just any dive. It was *my* dive. The kind of place where the stools sagged like the shoulders of the men who haunted them, and the air clung to you long after you left—stale beer, cigarette smoke from the ’90s, and the faint tang of broken promises. I’d been going there since my first year at the firm, back when I still believed in the grind. Back when I thought winning meant something.  

They knew me there. Marty, the bartender with a face like a crumpled receipt, would nod as I walked in and pour my usual before I’d even settled onto the cracked leather seat. Double whiskey, neat. *No ice*. *No mercy*.

That night, though, wasn’t about the usual. That night, I’d come straight from the courthouse, where I’d passed *her* in the hallway. Sarah Voss. The woman whose life I’d torpedoed three years ago. My malpractice case, my hubris, my failure to double-check the paperwork. She’d lost custody of her kids because of me. And there she was, clutching a toddler on her hip, staring through me like I was glass. Her eyes were the same shade of gray as the rain smearing the courthouse windows.  

“Ethan,” Marty said, sliding the whiskey toward me. “Rough day?”  

I drained the glass in one go. “The roughest.”  

He refilled it. “You wanna talk?”  

I laughed. Dry and lifeless. “You ever feel like you’re just… poison, Marty? Like everything you touch turns to ash?”  

He wiped the counter, avoiding my eyes. “You’re a lawyer. Isn’t that the job description?”  

I didn’t laugh that time.  

The bar’s jukebox wheezed to life—somebody’d queued up “Hurt” by Johnny Cash. Of course they had. The Hollow Cork’s soundtrack was curated by masochists. I ordered another drink. And another. And another. The whiskey burned, but not enough. Nothing burned enough.  

In the smudged mirror behind the bar, I watched the other patrons: a construction worker nursing a Bud Light, two women laughing too loud over cosmos, an old man tracing the rim of his Guinness with a trembling finger. All of us hiding from something. All of us pretending we weren’t.  

My phone buzzed. A voicemail from my sister. Again. *“Ethan, please call me. I’m worried about you.*” I silenced it, flipped the phone face-down so hard that the screen cracked. Of course it did.

By midnight, the bar was a graveyard. Even Marty had stopped pretending to polish glasses. “Last call,” he said nonchalantly, knowing that by this point everyone was either cut-off or too broke to get another drink. I was already gone, swimming in a haze of regret and Jameson.  

The rain outside was biblical. My BMW sat in the alley, sleek and smug. I’d bought it after the Voss case settled. A consolation prize. *”Congratulations, you ruined a family. Here’s a luxury sedan”.*  

The engine purred. The radio played Funkytown and I remember thinking, it’s funny how life is. Shit and then it ends.

and boy had I decided that this is the end. 

So I drove. Fast and deliberate, thinking only of the Remington 1911 under my bed. Thinking of how the cold steel will taste when I put it in my mouth and blow my brains out. And in my fantasy I didn’t see it. I couldn’t see it.

The whiskey made the world soft, smudged the edges of the streetlights into halos. Rain hissed against the windshield, and my hands shook as I fumbled with the radio. *Just get home*, I told myself. *Just drive and then it’ll all be over *. But then—*thud*. A sound like a sack of wet cement hitting the hood. My foot slammed the brake. The car fishtailed, skidded, stopped.  

In the rearview mirror, a shape lay crumpled in the road. A person. A *girl*. Her hair fanned out in the rain, dark as oil. My throat closed. I waited for her to move. She didn’t. And just as I’d wanted it to be over for me, it was over for her.

“No,” I whispered. “No, no, no—”  

I’d left my phone at the bar. No witnesses. The street was empty, slick and black. My fingers dug into the steering wheel. *Drive*. *Now*. The engine roared. I didn’t look back.  

---  

I wake to the smell of turpentine.  

My hands—*not my hands*—are smudged with charcoal. Slender fingers, a silver ring on the thumb. I’m sitting on a studio floor, surrounded by canvases: galaxies, forests, a self-portrait half-finished. A phone buzzes on a stool. The screen lights up.  

**Mom ♡**: *Don’t forget to call when you land! Te quiero, mi vida.*  

Land? *Where?* My head throbs. I stand, dizzy, and catch my reflection in a cracked mirror. A young woman stares back—olive skin, ink-black hair, a smudge of charcoal on her cheekbone. *Clara*, her mind whispers. *My name is Clara.*  

A cold dread seeps into me. *This isn’t real*. I’m hallucinating. Detoxing. This is the guilt, the hangover, the—  

Her legs move without me.  

I lurch toward the door, down a narrow staircase, into the rain. The street is familiar. Too familiar. *No. No, no—*  

Headlights slice through the dark. My heart jackhammers. *Run*, I scream at Clara’s body, but her feet keep walking, steady, inevitable. The car barrels closer. I see myself behind the wheel—*my* face, twisted, drunk, eyes wide shut.  

*SWERVE, YOU COWARD!*  

The impact cracks the world.  

---  

I wake to the smell of turpentine.  

Again.  

---  

The loop tightens.  

Every time, I’m Clara for one hour. I sketch stars she’ll never finish. Text her mom lies she’ll never send (*Flight’s delayed, love you too*). Pace the studio, screaming at walls she painted yellow. I’ve memorized the chip in her coffee mug, the way her cat, Ghost, rubs against her ankles. I’ve learned her fears: that her art will never matter. That she’ll die unknown.  

And every time, her feet carry her into the street.  

I’ve tried everything. Locked the door. Smashed her phone. Sat in a corner, weeping, begging the universe to *stop*. But her body betrays me. The hour ends. The rain calls. The headlights come.  

*My* headlights.  

I’ve started counting the loops too.

412. 

6,309. 

82,455. 

Time bleeds. I forget what sunlight feels like on my own skin.  

---  

“Why?” I scream at the night, at the rain, at the godless void. My… *Clara’s* voice raw. “What do you want from me?!”  

The answer is in the crunch of bone. The wet gasp she makes as her ribs crack and her lungs fill with blood. The way her left hand twitches, reaching for nothing.  

*You wanted to forget*, I think. *So remember*.  

---  

By the 217th loop, I stopped fighting.  

I let Clara sketch. Let her hum the song she loved. Let her check her reflection one last time. And when she steps into the street, I close her eyes.  

*I’m sorry*, I think, as the headlights bloom and I wake to the smell of turpentine.  

Centuries in, I realize the truth: this isn’t hell.  

It’s her life.  

Again.  

And again.

And again.
