(Part Two)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1bf49wl/i_used_to_a_soldier_something_found_us_in_the/))

I don’t remember much about the war.  

On that famous night – 8th of August 2008, Batu and I were watching the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing. So many athletes from so many countries. Even through the screen, I could feel their excitement and how proud they were… And then klaxons wailed. The entire base exploded with activity. We had no idea what was going on. Were we under attack? Or was it just an exercise? Or something else completely? 

Major Volkov told us that Georgia attacked the rebel Republic of South Ossetia and the Russian peacekeepers were under heavy fire. The war began. I could not believe it. That was a mistake or a sick joke…

Batu chuckled hysterically, while I was close to fainting. 

Our comrades looked less impressed. Some were the veterans of the First and Second Chechen Wars. Many had been to South Ossetia before – 1st and 2nd Battalions were taking turns as peacekeepers since the last war in 1991. Back then South Ossetia wanted independence from Georgia, and Georgians responded like any other. The first war was swift and brutal. Villages burned, cities bombed, and civvies were slaughtered in the most creative way possible. In the end, South Ossetia stayed independent. For more than 15 years the peace held…

And now it was time for Round 2. I could not believe it. It felt unreal, almost like a fever dream. Batu was even more shocked. His home village was a half planet away – his Asian features were a cause of multiple jokes and teasing from other soldiers. We both were just conscripts and were not even supposed to be in this mess! 

At worst I expected to face insurgents, fanatics, and terrorists. The idea of an actual war with another country was laughable. How could 2 states that both had McDonalds go to war with each other? We believed in Francis Fukuyama and his idea of the End of History. Yes, we were that naïve.

“Hey, kids!” I heard the jovial voice of Sergei – our machine gunner. “Stay close to us, hey? Don’t worry, everything will be OK… God will know his own!” 

He laughed loudly seeing my sour expression. Sergei had a peasant round face and was almost 2 meters high and wide like an ox. His friend Viktor punched him in the shoulder and shook his head disapprovingly. Those two were attached at the hip – Sergei carried our platoon’s PKM while Viktor had a heavy backpack full of ammo and spare barrels. I’m not sure I would have made it that far without them. When me and Batu first arrived at the barracks, it was they who shushed the other kontraktniks and took us under their wing. 

We saw the first casualty even before entering the South Ossetian territory. The lead BMP of our column smashed into a UAZ of another regiment, crushing the driver instantly. When our own BMP drove past the wreck, I could only stare in disbelief at the red paste that used to be a person. The column went on without stopping. Sergei spat on the ground and muttered something angrily, while Viktor just shrugged and kept arming his PKM belt. 

Our 135th Motor Rifle Regiment was the tip of the spear, thrown into the fray ahead of the major forces. 

South Ossetia met us with hot summer weather, sharp cliffs and narrow passes that slowed our progress. The column of almost 5 dozen vehicles – IFVs, trucks, and command UAZs stretched over kilometers. Few times we held our breath when the BMP maneuvered on particularly narrow sections. The threads were perilously close to the edges of the cliff. 

The caravans of Ossetian refugees complicated our advance even further. There were thousands of them running away from the Georgian onslaught. Ossetians looked at us with a mix of awe, curiosity, and hope. To them, we were like an angelic host. Kids threw us fruits and sweets. The elderly made signs of the Cross and offered cigarettes and local booze. 

In the distance, we heard the thunder of artillery fire, shrieks of Su-25s, and the roar of Grad rockets falling from the skies. The South Ossetian capital was pounded to dust. 

My first combat… was nothing like in the movies. No grand charge toward the enemy, no fancy battle cries or heroic speeches. One moment and Batu were riding on top of our BMP, and the next an RPG rocket barely missed a vehicle in front of us. Then we saw the flashes of gunfire behind the tree line at 3 o’clock. The bullets bounced off the armour sounding like Death’s dinner bell. It all went to chaos after that. Our company commander – Lieutenant Gavrilov screamed to spread out and return fire. There were confusion, fear, and the enemy “somewhere in that direction”. We could not even see the bastards – the distance was too great, the tree line too dense. The bullets hissed and crackled above my head. The BMP autocannons thundered – each shot sending shock waves, hitting my ears and insides like a sledgehammer. My mind was trying to figure out what was going on, like an ancient Windows 98. 

Sergei, God bless his soul, dragged me behind cover, and then kicked me in the face. Sudden pain and the smell of blood returned me to reality. 

“Stop gawking, boy!”  boomed Sergei, holding his PKM in one hand. “Vitya, prepare another belt!” 

The machine gun sang its familiar song like a jubilant prayer to the God of War. 

I raised my AKM and sent a shot burst at the enemy. Then suddenly remembered that I had an upgrade. GP-25 under-barrel grenade launcher – courtesy of our Praporshik. A huge grin appeared on my face. The first grenade went out with a loud pop, and the rifle kicked me in the shoulder like a horse. I counted 4 heartbeats before it exploded in a cloud of smoke, filling the tree line with shrapnel. 

The smell of engine fumes and the sound of gunfire almost drove us to madness. The entire battalion was showering the enemy position with everything we had. The site was glorious and equally terrifying – like a tidal wave shallowing a cruise liner.  

After Major Volkov managed to calm us down, the silence returned. Even the BMPs’ engines sounded less menacing, and more like a cat that found a jar of milk. 

My body felt numb, and my head was clear of thoughts. Funnily enough, it felt a lot like post-coitus – wobbly legs, hard breathing, clear head. As if nothing had happened, we jumped on our BMPs and moved on. Batu looked gloomy, clutching his rifle.

“I think… I think I killed someone” he confessed after we drove a few kilometres. 

He carried an SVD. The scoped rifle left little room for blissful denial unlike for us regular grunts. 

“Congratulations on the loss of virginity” Sergei smirked dryly. “Don’t worry kid. It will get easier”.

Batu nodded. He did not cry or wail. Nor did he look particularly shaken. He was just… sad. Nothing could have been said or done after all. 

The rush of adrenaline during the fight slowly faded away, leaving me exhausted. 

Some of my comrades looked cheery – sanguine even. The others were scared but play it off, trying not to lose the face. Me? I was thinking. No, I wasn’t overwhelmed with some anti-war sentiments. For the first time, I realized it was not a game, nor some exciting adventure. A wild bullet could end my life at any moment. I was not some gallant hero; I was one of those Halo NPCs used as cannon fodder. What would my parents do if they received my death certificate? Mom’s heart would be broken, and Dad would spend his life trying to find those who sent me to Ossetia and erase their entire bloodline. I dearly hoped it would not come to this. I did not want them to suffer even more.

Once we crossed the Gufta bridge we were ambushed again. Normally, the recon group should have warned us… but we WERE the recon. An ATGM tore the lead BMP apart. All 3 crew members died in an instant. Luckily, the guys on top managed to jump off at the last moment. A pair of Mi-24s flew over our heads as if answering our prayers. The Crocodiles unleashed their payload incinerating the enemy. We cheered loudly trying to suppress the sheer horror inside. We saw people just… disappear in a blink of an eye. It may sound cliché but seeing this personally… 

Our battalion was the first to enter the burning city of Tskhinval. Every building had a sign of heavy bombardment. Civvies and the remains of local militia were hiding in the basements. The Georgian raiding groups roamed the streets facing little resistance. 

A T-72 suddenly appeared in front of us. Men were sitting on top of the tank waving Georgian flags and cheering at us. I saw the eyes of one of them widen in shock when he understood… Our BMP autocannon burst like the Sun in its wake. In a second, the boy and his comrades exploded like piñatas. The tank hurriedly retreated leaving trails of blood and guts. 

The city fighting had begun. 

My memories of that time are all fuzzy. I remember we ran to cover when enemy bombardment began. How we were praying and cowling in the rubble, while the ground shook and the air trembled. That felt like the world was about to end. I remember us storming an abandoned school, clearing it room by room, and expecting to see a barrel of M4 behind every corner. I remember emptying half a mag into a guy while he was desperately trying to reload his gun. I remember the smell of fresh pork.  

Somehow, I stayed in one piece. A broken nose, cuts, and bruises all over the body were a small price to pay. Some were not that lucky. Our company alone had five 200s and 300s.  

The next week was a series of absurdities. Our regiment HQ ordered us to advance. The commander of the 58th Army demanded we hold the position. A column with the head of the entire North Caucasus Military district was ambushed on the other side of the city. Several passing Russian Mi-24s and Su-25s took us for Georgians and tried to blow us apart. Nobody knew why he was even there…

Major Volkov was swearing like a sailor, cursing the bureaucrats, and promised to personally punch the general in his fat face. 

In the end, Georgians were driven back to their territory, and for a moment we thought that was it… Until Chechen battalions “Vostok” and “Zapad” along with VDV units advanced to the Georgian home field. By that time something resembling the chain of command was restored, and we finally received coherent orders. But before we managed to reengage the enemy, the ceasefire was announced. Our column stopped 40 kilometers away from the Georgian capital. It felt… strange. I knew that storming the city would be a nightmare. But part of me felt cheated somehow – we were the first to enter the fray, days before those Chechens and paratroopers even arrived. We bled, died, and suffered the idiots in the HQ. Georgians tried to kill us, our comrades tried to kill us, even some civvies tried to kill us. We earned our right to fight. And now we were told it was over. The mix of joy and frustration made my skin crawl. 

But cease fire didn’t mean peace, however. The Russian forces occupied some Georgian territory, including the remote villages that technically were part of South Ossetia, but were occupied by Georgians. 

So, Major Volkov sent our company to garrison one of them. 

It was a remote settlement located between Georgian and Ossetian checkpoints. A small dirt road led high in the mountains. While we struggled to climb up, Lieutenant Gavrilov drove ahead in his command UAZ. 

Once we reached the village, we found Gavrilov talking to a priest. Black robe, long beard, and a fancy hat with the golden cross. Batu immediately froze, looking shaken and a bit scared. 

“He looks exactly… exactly like the man I saw in the woods!” Batu whispered. “He... He…”

“They all look the same” I reassured him, suddenly remembering that accursed night. “The priests I mean… Don’t worry – I’ve seen dozens of them before”.

“You did?” he asked hopefully. 

I nodded, realizing that Batu’s people were Buddhists and he had not seen many Christian priests before. After seeing one in the woods, he probably was wary and a tiny bit paranoid around them. 

The priest and our lieutenant started arguing louder. I could see the frustration on Gavrilov’s face and the stern look the priest gave him. They both were quite unhappy with each other’s. Only then did I notice a small boy no older than 10 who stood behind the priest. I saw proud defiance on his face. 

Finally, the lieutenant turned to us and shouted:

“2nd Platoon on guard duty! The rest of you – clear the area! We might stay here for a while.” 

The bearded priest shook his head disapprovingly, turned around, and went toward a small church in the distance dragging the boy with him. The kid caught my gaze and gave me the finger… 

My face twitched. Suddenly, Batu grabbed my hand and looked at me intently:

“No,” he said sternly. 

I took a deep breath and lowered my gun. The little shit was still looking at us making dumb faces, testing my patience. I got so used to Ossetians seeing us as their saviors, that I forgot that for Georgians we were like an invading barbarian horde.

“O sancta simplicitas” I muttered quietly. 

“What?!” Sergei asked surprised. 

“Nothing. Just an old Latin saying”.

“Nerd” he smirked. 

We advanced with caution – no one wanted to get shot by some village idiot playing Rambo. The village itself welcomed us with dead silence. The empty windows looked like empty eye sockets. Only a few houses seemed inhabited, but I still saw no people. No kids running around, no babushkas sitting on the benches along the streets. Even the most wretched villages were usually filled with life: the dogs barking, the gooses and cows shitting on the roadsides, and old ladies wailing at their husbands. 

Not here. I could only hear the shivering of the wind and the squeaking of old shutters. As if the entire village was dead. Sure, I did not expect a welcoming committee: most of the Georgian families would flee in fear of Ossetians’ vengeance. But some should have stayed: those too old, stubborn, or stupid to leave their ancestral home. 

“Looks like we’re not in Kansas anymore” muttered Sergei, looking at me and Batu. “Kids, stay sharp. I don’t like it”.

We both nodded.

Some houses looked well-maintained. The fences and the wooden walls were in good condition. But I noticed something that stood out like a pink elephant in a funeral house – the metal bars on the windows. Heavy locks and bolts on the doors. I knew it was not supposed to be there… What kind of villagers would fortify their own homes unless they were afraid of their neighbors? 

The other houses seemed abandoned for decades. I assumed they belonged to the Ossetian families who lived there before the first was. 

Despite the sunny day the desolation and eery silence somehow reminded me of the night in the woods. Batu caught my eye and nodded nervously. We both suddenly become on edge. Paranoia, sixth sense, intuition, premonition – call it whatever you want, something was not right. 

It didn’t take long for our company to check the territory. We found no inhabitants, except an old priest and his grandson who lived in the nearby church. The empty village… it felt wrong. Like finding an animal carcass with no clear signs of death. 

“Well, this one is next!” Sergei pointed at a small house. 

“Looks abandoned,” said Viktor quietly. 

“Means it will take just a couple of minutes. Children, with me!”

I rolled my eyes – both Sergei and Viktor kept calling us kids, children, runts, etc.  This annoyed the hell out of me. Though to be fair, I was too much of a chicken to confront Sergei - the guy was 2 heads higher than me. I didn’t want to get on Viktor’s bad side either – despite being “oh so mysterious” and silent, Viktor had spent the last 2 decades jumping from one warzone to another: Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Chechnya, and now Ossetia. In other words, I was not stupid enough to mess with those 2. Plus, I was grateful to them for helping me and Batu when we first arrived. So, we followed them wordlessly. 

The fence of the house was falling apart. The gate opened with an ugly screech – the hinges long rusted under the elements. It did look abandoned – the front door of the house lay open, the perimeter was covered in tall grass, and I could barely see through dirty windows. 

Batu sniffed and then grimaced. 

“Smells bad,” he said to no one in particular. 

“Good doggy” laughed Sergei loudly. 

I smiled, but then it disappeared when I saw Viktor carefully approach the door and signal us to shut up. 

“Someone breached it,” he said thoughtfully. “Shot the lock, kicked the door in.”

“Marauders?” I wondered. 

He shook his head and then disappeared into the dark hall of the house. Sergei followed him, and so did me and Batu. The air inside was stiff and smelled of dust and old bones. 

Viktor kneeled in the corridor looking intently at the floor. I noticed dark splashes all over the walls. You wouldn’t need to be Einstein to recognize dried blood. 

“A few men barged in. Shot the host – a man of the house probably” Viktor said pointing at the black spots and scratches on the floor, then picked up a brass shotgun shell. “A buckshot. Point blank.”

“The bastard probably spent a fortune on dry cleaning” Sergei smirked. 

All three of us stared at him. Sergei hissed defensively: 

“Alright-alright, no more comments! Jeez, no need to be such jerks!”

“Not soldiers then,” Batu nodded pointing at the shell. “They wouldn’t use shotguns.”

Viktor frowned and whispered curiously:

“Still… strange.”

He proceeded carefully inside the house. The living room was dark and messy – an old TV and dusty cabinets were covered in spiderwebs, a table turned around, and shards of broken glass and silver cutlery lay all over the floor. 

I noticed an old family photo on the wall. A young couple with 2 kids looked at us from the picture. 

“Someone fought back,” said Viktor drily, pointing at a table knife covered in black stains. “Managed to get one of the attackers.”

Sergei ran his shoe over an old puddle of blood.

“Didn’t help them much” he said nonchalantly. 

“Damn robbers” I concluded. 

“Not robbers” Victor replied. “Look around. The TV is still here. The cabinets are not opened. No one even bothered to pick up the silver. They came after the family.”

“So, pogrom then?”

He shrugged and moved into the bedroom. It looked mostly untouched: the double bed was still neatly done, and family photos and women's jewelry were on the bedside tables. An ancient Nokia 3310 lay on the windowsill. Viktor moved to the next room, looking completely uninterested. 

He opened the door and froze. I saw 2 small beds, plush toys in the corner, and a Lord of the Rings poster on the wall… 

“Fuck” I muttered.

If the dark spots on the floor and the splashes on the wall indeed were blood, then this place looked as if someone butchered a pig here… with a buzz-saw.  

Even Sergei was taken aback. Batu frowned and spat on the floor. I was ready to throw up. We all were not saints, but this.... 

“Not a pogrom after all,” Viktor’s voice sounded confused. 

“You mean that,” I pointed angrily at the bloodstains all over the room. “Is not pogrom to you?!” 

“If you’d seen one, you would know, kid.” He suddenly told me sternly. “They would drag the survivors outside, shoot them, and throw the bodies into a pit. Then would take everything valuable and leave looking for another family to butcher. This… looks like they were in a hurry or scared witless. Too messy and sporadic. Besides…”

Viktor pointed at the movie poster. 

“What?” Batu muttered fighting nausea. 

“That film,” he turned his cold gaze to me. “That was released just a couple of years ago”.

I froze realising the obvious. The poster, the cell phone – both were from the 2000s. In my naivety I assumed that the massacre happened during the first war in 1991 – Georgians and Ossetians slaughtering each other was a mundane reality back then. But this? This happened during peacetime!  

“Jesus Christ, Vitya,” Sergei groaned. “Enough of your Yugoslavia stories, you scare the children. I say the house is cleared. Now everyone, get the hell out of here.”

We moved outside as fast as we could. I still saw the image of what happened inside. It was one thing to kill in battle, but this? This was just violence for violence’s sake. I knew humans were horrible creatures in general but seeing this reminded me why I stopped socialise before the army. It shook everyone. Batu was a silent type by default, but this time he just stared forward unblinking, no doubt replaying the memories of what he saw over and over again. Even Sergei finally stopped talking nonsense and was all serious and irritated. Viktor… well, I think he had already seen plenty of these horrors in Serbia, but this one piqued his curiosity somehow. 

Finally, the village was cleared. We hadn’t found anyone except for the priest and his grandson.

The only location we didn’t check was a cemetery. Somehow, I had no desire to walk around the dead. But of course, the lieutenant chose our squad to sweep the damn graveyard. 

It was strange to me that the graveyard was so far away from the church. In fact, it was exactly on the opposite side of the village. The feeling of unease was even stronger there. The ground itself emanated cold. Not a physical cold – the sun was high in the sky and were sweating. No, it was… different kind of cold. The one you feel looking outside a window during a blizzard. 

It felt almost as if someone was draining my strength. Sucking my body heat little by little. 

The graveyard at first glance looked like any other. But I notice there were no granite tombstones, instead all the graves had simple wooden crosses, most of them already falling apart. No dried flowers, no food, or drinks were offered to the dead. The village was just a stone's throw away, and yet no local babushkas and dedushkas came here to look after the graves?

Hell, no one ever bothered to clear the wild grass and bushes – the damn things grew so much, it made some routes completely unpassable. 

I stopped. Batu, Sergei, and Viktor went the other way and were nowhere to be seen – the damn bushes blocked the view. But before I turned back, I saw a concrete stair leading deep underground to a rusty metal door. A huge metal lock was hanging on it. One glance at it made me shiver. It reminded me of those stories of cursed houses that were burned by locals, leaving only stairs to the basement where evil still lurked. 

I cursed profoundly but tried to rationalize. Maybe it was an old bomb shelter? Or an actual basement of a long-destroyed cottage? 

Against my better judgment, I took a step forward, surprising even myself. My eyes were fixed on the door. I made another step, but this time stumbled on something. A small metal stake was pierced halfway into the ground. A small cross was engraved on its head. I looked around – as expected there were a dozen of similar stakes. And they all circled the entrance to the basement. 

“Nope!” I told myself out loud. 

It was surprisingly hard to step away. As if my legs were paralyzed. But my fear and a meticulously calibrated internal BS detector made my body move. My imagination already ran wild: that the metal lock fell off and the door slowly opened. And the clawed hands came out and were slowly moving closer to me.

I wanted to turn but ordered myself to walk. Just one more step. And again. And again. 

Then I ran. 

Back then I had already known there were places you must stay away from. That was one of them. I just hoped the others would not try to F-around and find out. In hindsight that was foolish. 

Until late evening the entire company was busy fortifying the village. The entrance was blocked by a checkpoint, and an NSV was overlooking the main road to the village. All other routes were mined and booby-trapped like in good old 1916. Mortar teams had already got their firing solutions. Gavrilov even managed to commandeer an artillery battery from another regiment to provide us with extra umpf.

Sergei found us a small house where 4 of us could sleep.  Only problem? The graveyard was right next to my window. No one seemed to be concerned about and I asked Sergei, he just laughed and offered to read me a story before bed. 

“Ah, what a life!” Sergei exclaimed jumping on his bed. “Hey, Vitya, remember the last time we lived in such comfort during a war?” 

“No” Viktor grunted and kept cleaning his AKS.

“Exactly!” barked Sergei. “This house is sweet: warm beds, clean sheets and we even have a running water! It's like a vacation! And we are getting paid for every minute of it!”.

“You are getting paid,” I murmured. “Me and Batu will receive literally nothing.” 

“Don’t worry, boy! Already spoken to the lieutenant! You’ll get your veteran status. It's a pretty sweet deal actually: free public transport, free utilities, and monthly payments! Oh, and your kids will go to Uni for free, how good that is?” 

I scoffed:

“Wow, such generosity! I’m so happy I could jump out of my pants!” 

“Keep your pants on, boy! You are too young to talk like that!” Sergei laughed. “But seriously, it's not much, but it’s something.”

“You are lucky this war didn’t last longer,” Viktor said drily, still focusing on his rifle. “A few more weeks and… well, you’d be more like us, than normal people”.

“You are normal” I blurted confusedly. 

Viktor and Sergei looked at each other and boomed with laughter. I got used to Sergei’s light-hearted nature, but Viktor… Seeing him laughing was scarier than stepping on a landmine. Batu and I glanced at each other uneasily. They kept laughing so hard, I thought they were going to choke. Finally, Sergei wiped his tears and said:

“Boy, never lose that sweet innocence of yours!”

We had spent some time chatting. Sergei told us that he used to be married and had a daughter. His ex-wife was sick of them always moving. Throughout his service, he was stationed almost in every corner of Russia – from the border with Japan to Kaliningrad near Germany. Viktor was single – the army being his only family. I felt sad for both of them, but at the same time respected their dedication. 

Batu told about his village and how he had been hunting with his father and older brothers since he was little. I knew there was more – his eyes darted to me worryingly, and I decided to ignore it. 

My story was ordinary – just another spoiled brat born with a silver spoon. I never talked about the island and the death of my friends. Nor had I mentioned the woods. 

“So, that why you are spewing all these Latin nonsenses!” laughed Sergei, passing me a cigarette. “How come you are here with us peasants?”

“I’ve got lost on my way to Uni” I smirked taking a puff. 

Soon we decided to call it a day. The 2nd platoon was on watch duty, so we had time to relax. The moment my head touched the pillow, I fell asleep. 

I still don’t remember what exactly I dreamed of. The details had blurred and faded as soon as I opened my eyes. The only thing that stacked in my mind – the echo of sheer horror and overwhelming panic. 

Batu was shaking me frantically. There was fear and urgency on his face. I breathed hard and tried to suppress the scream that was rising inside of me. My heart pounded like crazy, my throat spasmed and my clothes were covered in sweat. 

“Wake up, you! WAKE UP! Come on, we have to get out of here!” 

I was still disorientated, my body refused to obey. I fell from the bed feeling vomit coming out. After the spasms stopped, my mind cleared at last. 

“What… Batu? What’s going on?” I asked in a shaking voice.

“We have no time! We need to wake the others!” Batu screamed. “Help me!” 

I saw Sergei was thrashing and convulsing in his bed. He let out a roar full of pure horror. From time to time, he muttered short but colorful obscenities. Viktor was in a similar condition. He screamed, and cried and begged someone to stop… His hands darted from side to side as if he was trying to reach his weapon. 

No matter how hard I and Batu tried – none of them woke up. Screaming, slapping, shaking – nothing helped. 

With each passing moment, it was getting worse. I saw drops of blood in the corner of their mouths and then realized it was time for drastic measures. 

“What are you…” Batu asked. 

I took my bayonet and stabbed Sergei in the shoulder. He roared and opened his eyes. Immediately I regretted my life decisions – without warning, a giant fist punched me in the chest, and I dropped on the floor like a sack of potatoes.

“What the?!..” Sergei roared looking around like a cornered animal. 

He instantly grabbed his rifle and started aiming it all around. His eyes were wide, his hands shaky. 

“Wow, easy there!” I said raising my arms. “It’s all right-It’s all right.”

Sergei didn’t listen. He jumped to Viktor and started punching him with all his strength. The other kontraktnik stopped crying and opened his eyes – Sergei had just enough time to jump back as Viktor tried to gut him with a knife. 

After a few seconds, we all just stared at each other breathing heavily. But then Viktor’s body convulsed, and he dropped to the floor and vomited blood. 

Sergei immediately followed Viktor’s example – we heard another gurgling sound. 

“Suuuka…” Sergei muttered painfully. “What the hell did we eat last night?” 

This was when I heard it – the screaming outside. That was not someone barking orders or panicking over the incoming enemy. That was a howl of a person being skinned alive. Like a piercing wail of klaxons, it made my teeth ache and my soul tremble. 

“Get your weapons!” barked Sergei still dizzy and walking on shaky legs. ” We are under attack!” 

“Wait, something is not…” I started but was interrupted. 

The door swung open, and I almost opened fire on reflex. Viktor grabbed my gun just in time. I saw one of our comrades in the doorway – I couldn’t even recognize the guy. His uniform was torn and stained with blood. His face was pale and eyes wide with terror. He rushed inside, screaming like a lunatic. That was Ruslan Klimov – 2nd Platoon sergeant. 

Something outside yanked him back so fast we could not even see. One moment he was there, and the next his face disappeared into the night. Ruslan screamed as if he was mauled by a bear. Then somehow his wailing came from above. We could hear him banging and thrashing over the metal roof – dust fell from the ceiling under his relentless beating. Then banging stopped and we froze in horror when his harrowing cries began sounding further and further away like the squeaking of a mouse snatched by an owl. 

We all stood there trying to digest what the hell happened. Batu clutched his SVD closer, Viktor was breathing hard through the nose – panic and uncertainty seen on his face. 

The sound of automatic gunfire pierced the night. I saw muzzle flashes and heard panicked shouts.   

Sergei rushed to the door, machinegun in his hands. I barely had time to react when his back disappeared in the darkness. Viktor followed him limping slightly. Batu looked at me not sure what to do. I did not want to go outside… Something told me it was a very bad idea. But what choice did we have?

We ran after Sergei and Viktor, flashlights on. 

The village delved into chaos. The tracer rounds lit the night, houses were burning, and people running and screaming. I heard the rumble of the BMP engine and then the loud bang of the autocannon. 

“Get down!” Sergei appeared out of the darkness and jumped on me. 

Something exploded, and my ears began ringing. 

Viktor and Batu dropped near us. 

“Move! Move! Move!” Sergei screamed into my ears. “To the vehicles!” 

We all ran toward the backyard we parked our BMP. A guy appeared from a burning house, all covered in flames. He was screaming something unintelligibly. Viktor stopped, looked at him for a second, and then raised his gun and fired. The burning man dropped to the ground. 

The fires painted the area in a soft orange tone. We ran hearing the gut-wrenching cries of our comrades everywhere. They sounded less like humans and more like pigs in the slaughterhouse. 

I felt something fall on my cheek – something warm and sticky. Raising my head I saw movement in the night sky. At first, I thought it was a bird. Then I noticed the wings – pale and sickly like the ones of an albino bat. My heart skipped a bit when this “bat” dived at us. 

“Incoming” I screamed opening fire. 

Sergei and Viktor immediately stopped and joined me. The machinegun thundered followed by our pocket flashlights piercing the night like an anti-air searchlight. Once or twice, we caught a glimpse of this “bat”, and it was enough for me to know that we were screwed. That thing was the size of a child with clawed hands and thin legs with too many joints.  

“Move, I’ll cover!” barked Sergei lighting the dark skies with tracers. 

We ran a couple of dozen meters, and then me and Viktor stopped opening fire and covering Sergei’s retreat. The winged creature tried to lunge at us twice, but Sergei’s PKM was enough to persuade it otherwise. That blasted thing was too nimble in the air. It flew absolutely soundless and quickly evaded our beams of light.

The BMP stood where we left it. I felt relieved getting inside through the rear doors. Batu and Viktor get into another door. Sergei kept firing – the barrel of his gun glowing red in the darkness. One of the things swooped on him slashing his face. I saw blood sprayed out. Sergei fell on his back dropping the PKM.

“Ai, blyat! Can’t see! Can’t see!” he tried to cover the wound on his forehead.

I took his hand and began dragging inside the BMP. 

Sergei was heavy like a boar. He then screamed – something grabbed him by the leg and tried to pull out of the vehicle. Batu raised his SVD and a whip-like sound almost deafened me. The creature let go. 

I slammed the door shut. 

It was dark inside, and I could only hear our heavy breathing and Sergei’s non-stop swearing. An armoured fuel tank separated us from Batu and Viktor. For a moment, it felt like we were finally safe. Then something hit the BMP’s armour. The sound resonated inside like a dinner bell. We heard scratching and silent growls all around us. Something was trying to get inside – yanking the hatches and trying to squeeze sharp claws into the gaps. 

“Boy, get into the gunner seat!” I could barely hear Viktor’s order behind all the scratching. 

“Go!” Sergei muttered finally wiping the blood from his eyes. “I’ve got this”.

His leg was a mess. I saw deep slashes and bitemarks – the whole chunks of flesh were missing and bone was clearly visible even in a dim light. To this day I have no idea how he was still awake with wounds like this.

I managed to squeeze into the gunner seat – the space inside of BMP was cramped, to say the least. 

Viktor sat on the right in the commander’s chair.

“Boy, turn the night-vision on and shoot!” he ordered loading the autocannon. 

I leaned toward the sight – the grainy image appeared in front of me. I could barely see the surroundings – the sight was the original one from the 80s. That was definitely not like Call of Duty.  

But even so, I saw several bat-like shapes in the skies. 

“Fire! Fire! Fire!” Viktor commanded. 

I pressed the button on the antiquated controls. The autocannon spewed fire. I pressed another button, and the coaxial machinegun angrily joined its big sister. The creatures dodged the shots – too damn fast.

“Switch to rapid fire!” Viktor shouted. 

Finding the right button wasn’t easy in the dark, but I managed. 30 mm Autocannon thundered again this time much meaner and angrier. 550 rounds per minute announced our defiance. With gloating satisfaction, I saw creatures scatter and flee. 

A human figure ran toward us from the burning house. That was Lieutenant Gavrilov!

The man was chased by 2 creatures flying over his head. I placed several bursts just above him to scare them away. At first, it helped, but then a winged bastard dived from the skies and snatched him. Several beasts joined the feast covering his entire body with their beating wings – they started tearing our comrade limb from limb. Blood and entrails fell on the ground. It took a few seconds before they dropped whatever was left of him. Admittedly that wasn’t much.  

The night vision suddenly went dark. I heard the sound of glass breaking. 

“What the?..” I muttered. 

“Shit!” growled Viktor. “Clever little…” 

“What the hell is going on?!” Sergei barked from the troop compartment. 

“They blinded us” angrily muttered Viktor. “Boy, see the driver seat underneath you? Get there and try the lights!”

I almost stuck in the narrow hole between the seats. Barely squeezing myself, I tried to find the right switch to turn the headlights. 

Nothing happened. I tried again. 

“Don’t bother, boy” Viktor didn’t sound surprised. “If they managed to break the sights, no wonder they took care of the damn headlights”.

“What are we going to do?” 

“Check the driver’s hatch and get your ass back here. I suggest getting some sleep”.

As if hearing him, the creatures responded with loud screeching and… hysterical laughter. They sounded like a pack of drunk hyenas. 

“Can we just leave?” I asked uncertainly. “I can drive, you know”.

“Yeah, without headlights or night vision?” Viktor laughed drily. “We’ll roll over a mine or fall off the cliff. In the morning we’ll be able to see the road at least.”

I nodded. 

Sergei was already bandaging his leg. Several empty syringes lied near him. He showed me thumb up and kept wrapping the bandage over his limb.

I heard Batu chuckle. 

“What’s the matter?” I asked. 

“We really should stop getting ourselves in situations like this,” he said humorously. 

I grinned and shook my head.
