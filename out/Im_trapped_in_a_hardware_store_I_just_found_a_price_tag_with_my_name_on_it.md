The store.

That’s all we call it. No name, no address, no exits. Just the store. Aisles stretching on forever, products restocked by the employees. We’ve tried to map it out, but the layout changes when you’re not looking. Directions don’t make sense. The aisles never end exactly where they should.

I don’t know how long we’ve been here. Honestly, I don’t know if I’ve ever been anywhere else. Some of us remember fragments of something before this—cities, parents, real sunlight—but it fades, like a dream you can't quite hold onto. The longer you stay, the harder it is to picture the outside.

And no one remembers how they got here. No one remembers walking in. But we all know one thing: we can’t leave. I tell myself that doesn’t matter, that survival is the only thing that matters. That if I can keep my head down, keep moving, keep useful—the store won’t notice me.

But I think it already has.

Because now I’m running.

Heart pounding. Lungs burning. The aisles shifted behind me, the lights flickered, and then they were there. The Employees. Watching. Moving. Closing in.

Now I’m trapped, back pressed against cold metal, trying to catch my breath, waiting for them to come around the corner.

Nowhere left to run. No way out.

I already know how this ends.

Because just a few feet away, on the edge of the shelf, there’s a price tag.

It shouldn’t mean anything. Just another meaningless label in a place full of meaningless products. But as I stare at it now, something in my chest twists, cold and tight.

I don’t know how much time I have left, if any at all. I don’t know if anyone will ever see this. But I need to share my story. It won’t save anyone. If you ever find yourself here, there’s no escape.  I just think I need to do this for myself. Maybe it will bring some clarity before whatever happens next.

My name is Korynn Wallace.

This is my story.

We survive where we can. We take what we need. And over time, we’ve divided ourselves, carving out sections of the store like scavengers picking over a carcass.

We built our home in the Electrical & Plumbing aisles, deep in the guts of the store. A tangled mess of wires, broken machinery, security panels we don’t fully understand but know how to reroute. Our defenses aren’t walls—they’re motion sensors, pressure plates, electrified floors.  But my job isn’t building traps. We leave that to the Wiresmiths.

Inside of our faction, I’m what's known as a Rustman. I go beyond our  territory, picking through the store’s forgotten aisles for batteries, wiring—anything with power left in it. That’s why I’m out here now. 

The first half of the journey went as planned. There’s an order to the places we live and build our bases, but the further you go, the less the store follows those rules.

I begin to move quickly, scanning shelves, stuffing whatever I can carry into the reinforced duffel strapped across my shoulder. Stripped wiring coils, circuit breakers, an old security keypad that might still be functional. The Wiresmiths could use these—maybe to rig a better defense system, maybe for something else entirely. I don’t ask too many questions.

Then I see it—a power inverter, half-buried beneath a pile of discarded surge protectors. This is gold. If it still works, the Wiresmiths could siphon power from the store’s power grid. We’re running low—the Scrappers are always running low—and this could mean the difference between keeping our defenses running or leaving ourselves exposed. I reach for it. And then the store shifts.

It happens fast. Too fast. One moment, I’m standing in an aisle lined with shelves. Next, the shelves move. Not like they’re being pushed—like they’re realigning themselves, sliding into new positions with a low, mechanical groan. My stomach lurches.

The shelf in front of me—the one I was reaching for—vanishes. In its place, a blank wall of unmarked boxes and empty peg hooks.

I spin around. The way I came is gone, too. I should’ve run. Should’ve bolted the second I heard that noise. But I hesitated. Just for a second. And that’s when the shelves started closing in. The walls shrink, pressing inward. The air tightens. My breathing turns ragged. My heart slams against my ribs.

Move. MOVE.

I lunge forward, sprinting toward the only gap I can see—a narrow opening between two shifting shelves. The moment I break through, the shelves slam together behind me with a metallic shriek. If I had been a second slower—I don’t think about that. I don’t stop moving. Because the store isn’t done with me. I take a sharp left, trying to retrace my steps. But the aisle ahead stretches too far. Too long. Longer than it should.

My boots hit the tile in frantic strides, but the aisle just keeps going. The shelves loom higher than before. I force myself forward, but the further I go, the heavier the air feels. Like something doesn’t want me here. A sound crackles through overhead speakers. A voice.

*"Attention shoppers..."*

My blood runs cold. Is that the intercom?

*"Please return to your designated areas. Employees are standing by to assist you."*

I stop running. Not because I want to, but because I see them. Figures moving ahead. Their heads are turned away, their movements too smooth, too precise. The store lights glint off their uniforms, their blank plastic name tags.

Employees.  I press myself against the nearest shelf. Hold my breath. They pass in front of me, silent, empty. But one of them hesitates

“Shit.” I mumble beneath my unsteady breath. It turns its head—just slightly, just enough. It knows I’m here.

At first glance, it looks human. That’s the worst part. The shape of it is almost right. The arms, the legs, the proportions—close enough to trick your brain into thinking you’re looking at a person. But then you see the way it moves. The way it tilts its head just slightly too far, bends its joints just a little too smoothly—like something mimicking a human without fully understanding how one works.

Its face is blank. Not literally—there’s skin, but it’s too smooth, too uniform, as if someone sanded down all the features until only the suggestion of a person remained. There are eyes, but no emotion. A mouth, but it doesn’t breathe. Just the shallow rise and fall of its chest, like a machine pretending to be alive.

And right now, it’s staring at me. A Store Manager. The intercom crackles again:

*"Assistance is on the way."*

MOVE.

I break into a sprint, forcing my legs to push forward as the Manager jerks toward me in one smooth motion. The second I run, it reacts. Not fast at first—just turning, following. But I hear it behind me, its movements too deliberate, too unhurried—like it doesn’t need to run. Like it knows I’m not getting out. The aisles stretch and shift around me. I don’t know where I’m going.

The path ahead twists—the long aisle I was trapped in a second ago suddenly isn’t long anymore. I nearly slam into a dead end that wasn’t there before, the shelves closing me in. I twist right. Keep running. Ignore the way the walls seem to tighten every time I look away. Another intercom message hums through the speakers.

*"Please do not remove products from the designated shelves. Restocking in progress."* 

The Manager isn’t running. It doesn’t have to.

I risk a glance over my shoulder—and my stomach drops.

There’s more than one.

Figures move between the aisles, shifting in and out of view as the shelving rearranges itself. Some of them aren’t watching me at all. They’re restocking. Placing products that weren’t there before with silent, mechanical efficiency. Stockers.

They don’t care about me. Not directly. They only care about the shelves. About keeping the store in order. But the Managers? They do care.

They aren’t chasing me. Not the way I thought they would. They don’t need to. Because as I run, as I twist and turn down random aisles, trying to break free—I realize I’m not choosing my path at all. They are.

Every turn I take, every route I think is mine to make, they’re closing in—not to catch me, but to guide me. I’m at their whim the same way a leaf torn from a branch is carried by the wind. Directionless. Powerless. Moved by something bigger than itself

My chest tightens. I take a sharp left, nearly slipping as my boots squeak against the tile, forcing myself toward anywhere but where they want me. For a second, I think I’ve lost them. I should have known better.

 The air grows heavy. The overhead lights flicker. The aisles finally open into a wider section—storage shelves, boxes stacked high, the usual clutter of a place no one’s touched in weeks. I stumble forward, trying to catch my breath, trying to think. And that’s when I see it.

A price tag, flickering on the shelf just ahead of me.  Something in my chest twists. I don’t want to look. But I do. And the second I read it, I knew I was never running at all.  The numbers shift. Not randomly—deliberately. The screen glitches, colors inverting, pixels scrambling into unreadable static for just a second—And then it stops. I feel the floor drop out beneath me. 

Written clean and precise, centered just below the store’s usual product description. No price. No barcode. Just me. “Korynn Wallace” And beneath it, in bold black letters: “Low Stock”

A sound leaves my throat. Not a word. Just a breath, just fear. Something shifts behind me. I don’t turn. I can’t. 

The air is thick now, pressing in from all sides, swallowing sound, muffling everything but the low hum of the intercom. I try to breathe, try to think past the weight in my chest, but my brain is scrambling, running full-speed into a dead end.

Something moves in the corner of my vision. A shape—tall, still, waiting. Another Manager. I squeeze my eyes shut. Maybe if I don’t look, it won’t be real. Maybe if I don’t acknowledge it, it won’t—

The intercom hisses, almost as if to mock me for failing to get away.

*"Attention shoppers..."*

The voice is garbled, like an old tape played at the wrong speed, warping and dragging between words.

*"Aisle associate Korynn has been located. Preparing for restock."*

Cold rushes through me. I stagger backward, my heel catching on the base of the shelf. The tag flickers again, the words LOW STOCK pulsing brighter, bolder, as if confirming something. The Manager steps forward. It doesn’t lunge. Doesn’t grab me. Just moves. Slowly.

The tile beneath my feet shifts. Not dramatically. Just enough that my balance wavers.

*"Restocking in progress."*
