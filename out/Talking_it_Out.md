**I knew Mason had been having a rough few months, so when he called me up on a Friday and asked that I come over to his house to talk, I assumed he wanted to vent, relax, and recharge for the upcoming week with a good friend. I grabbed a twelve pack of cheap beer, anticipating drinking them all and delving into exactly what was ailing my friend.**

**I did not, however, expect to walk into an apartment that looked like it was owned by a schizophrenic horder. The first problem I noticed after Mason let me in was that he had connected three separate gaming systems together using extension and power cords. Branching off were more cords, connected to various household objects, such as a toaster, a microwave, a television, a pair of 3-D glasses, and a massage chair.**

**“Why?” Was my first, and obviously, most important question. Either Mason had lost his mind, or I was about to be shock tortured. Probably both, considering the circumstances.** 

**“I built a time machine! I invited you over here to test it out!” Mason eagerly replied. I didn’t want to be the one to burst his bubble, but I noticed a hefty amount of beer cans poking out of his recycling bin.** 

**The second problem I noticed was a pair of blue eyes looking at me from the closet. I whipped the door open, but nobody was inside. Mason gave me a confused look. “Do you have a mirror in your closet?” I asked. Mason shook his head.**

**Next, I pointed at the third problem I noticed, the overflowing recycling bin. “Have you been drinking?” I asked, despite the fact that I brought over beer for both of us. At the very least, he’d be boozed up so we could talk about what was going on with him.** 

**“Most days, yeah. But for real,” Mason walked over to the chair, “I think this’ll work. If you put on the glasses, turn the Xbox on, and visualise where you want to go, it’ll take you back there right at the moment the contraption makes contact. Originally I had it so it had to poke your prostate, but I scrapped that idea.”**

**“You understand I have about a million questions, right?” Mason had a...different sort of humor. I’m not exaggerating when I say it was possible this was just a weird, elaborate prank.**  

**“Go ahead.” Mason invited.**

**“Why….why the prostate?” I had to know. Out of all the weirdness I was currently viewing, that was the main question I had been hanging on to.**

**Mason gave me a curious look. “Have you ever had it stimulated?”**

**“I have sex with women, so, no.” I replied, somehow keeping my composure.** 

**“Well, that’s why. Ask Jess to root around back there the next time you see her.”**

**“Absolutely. Will do.” I said, making a mental note to break up with Jess at the HINT that she wanted to go “rooting around” back there. “Second, you texted me and said you wanted to come over and talk, so what’s with….this?” I asked, gesturing to the nightmarish machine in front of me.** 

**“Well, that’s what I wanted to talk to you about. I need your help turning the Xbox on when I sit in the chair, so I can travel back in time.”**

**Okay. I decided I’d humor him. “Where do you plan on going?”**

**Mason grinned, but I could see in his eyes it was forced. “Well, you know it’s been a long few months. I lost my job, Michael cheated on me, I got cursed by an old gypsy woman when I bumped into her in the street with my car.” Mason sighed, sitting down. “I’m going to go back to when we were in second grade, and murder myself.”**

**“What? Why?” I asked, for what felt like the millionth time. Plus, I still wasn’t convinced this wasn’t some elaborate, weird joke.** 

**“It seemed easier than just killing myself here and now, I guess I-”**

**“How? How was any of this easier than- also NO, dude, you can’t kill yourself. You invited me over here to talk, so let's talk about it.”**

**“I’m a guy, Logan.” Mason replied. “Unless you’re a hot girl, you aren’t allowed to discuss feelings.” He rolled his eyes. “That’s like, the first rule of being a guy.”**

**“That’s a dumb rule, and you don’t have to follow it. But I need to circle back.” There was so much going on, I didn’t even know which thread to follow. “How was this easier? That’s the main part I’m hung up on.”**

**“Oh, well this way, I figured I could eliminate my life completely, instead of just ending it.  It completely gets rid of all the wrongs I’ve done, and the people I know won’t be bothered by my disappearance.” He shrugged and grinned. “Classic win-win.”**

**“Okay but… and I hate to be the one to ask this, but...if you went back in time to kill youself...you wouldn’t live long enough to build a time machine, so you’d never go back in time to kill yourself.” I waved my hands around in a circle. “That’s a paradox. Besides, we’re getting ahead of ourselves here, you don’t even know it works.”**

**“Let's try it then.” Mason said, sitting in the massage chair. I cringed from deep inside my soul, and covered my eyes with my free hand, the other still holding the beers.** 

**“I am not going to turn on a time machine so you can go back in time and commit suicide. That’s nuts man.” I walked to his refrigerator, depositing the beers I had brought over. I was starting to get actually worried. He seemed so calm. I had read in one of my psych classes that people sometimes feel a sense of overwhelming calm when they decide to do themselves in, and I worried that if this wasn’t a joke, then Mason has lost his mind, and/or decided to go through with this plan in some way.** 

**“Fine, I’ll prove to you it works. I’ll go back in time to right when you arrive, and you’ll see two of me.” He pointed at the couch. “If it doesn’t work, we can sit down and talk about our feelings like babies. Deal?”**

**Mostly to humor him, and prove that you cannot time travel via Xbox-chair-machine, I sighed, and moved to the Xbox, keeping my eyes off my friend the whole time.** 

**“I’ll visualise the room, and when you hit the switch, I’ll go back in time, and come right back a few minutes later. Ready?” He seemed so excited, I almost felt bad helping him prove that this wouldn’t work. I sighed again, loud enough so he would overhear what I thought of that, and turned the Xbox on.** 

**There was a bright flash of yellow light. I’ll admit, I screamed. My first thought was that we overloaded the circuits, and I had set my friend on fire.** ***Well, he did want to kill himself, I guess. Is that still murder?*** **The cynical part of my mind thought, before I noticed that chair was empty.** 

**“What the fuck?” I ran over to the chair, taking care to avoid it. I searched the whole apartment, I couldn’t find a trace of Mason at all.**

**I had 911 typed in my phone, and was about to dial when another bright flash of yellow light appeared. Mason appeared back into the chair, grinning like a mad man. “It worked! Holy shit, it worked!” He yelled, jumping up and down with joy.**

**“How...what happened?” I asked, flabbergasted. This had to be some prank, or madness. There was no other rational explanation.** 

**“I went back in time! You saw me, you even asked past-me about it!” He exclaimed, still bouncing around with unbridled joy.** 

**“I didn’t see you, though. I’d remember it.” At the very least, that was my proof. I had not seen more than one Mason in this apartment the entire duration of my visit.** 

**“You did though!” He pointed at his closet, where I had seen eyes earlier. “I didn’t have time to walk out, it only lasted a few seconds, but I got your attention before I flashed back.”**

**“You can’t prove to me that it was you! How did you set all this up? Pyrotechnics? You were an art history major, for God’s sake!” My compassion for the situation was dwindling, and it was slowly being replaced with red hot anger. “I came over here to help you, and you’re making me feel like-”**

**“You try it, then.” Mason shot back, dipping his head towards the chair.**

**“I’m not sitting on that.” I was going to be firm on that, at the very least.** 

**“You don’t have to. Just hit the button and run back and grab me, it should work.” Mason said matter-of-factly. I looked at the door. If I left now, I could probably repair the plans I called off with Jess earlier. But something in Mason’s voice told me he was serious.** 

**Again, and against my better judgement, I humored my friend, with the promise that I could punch him right in the face if this didn’t work. He agreed, insisting that it would, and I repeated the earlier action, gripping Mason’s arm as the bright yellow light reappeared.** 

**Suddenly everything was yellow. It felt like floating in water, except I could breathe. Everything around us smelled like dust, and I screamed again. Mason just laughed, and suddenly a force pulled us out of the yellow and into a bar.**

**I dropped to the ground, and started searching for a trashcan to vomit into. I found nothing, and ralphed right on the floor. Mason just laughed.** 

**“I told you! Did you think I was lying?” Mason was still laughing as he helped me up from the floor.** 

**“What-where-when are we?” I asked, slurring over my words. I felt exhausted, as if I had spent the whole day drinking and my body was trying to sleep it off. I looked around. The bar was covered in dust, no bottles lined the shelves, all the chairs were up on tables. Everything seemed...familiar, somehow, and I wasn’t sure why until I looked outside and saw the tire store down the road from our old college house.**

**“Are we at Mabels?” I asked. “We couldn’t be, this place is abandoned.”**

**“The year is 2010.” Mason narrated, as I tried not to panic or roll my eyes. Whichever came first in this situation. “Mabel’s has not been purchased, and will not be until 2012. Do you remember the bathroom graffiti, saying ‘MASON WAS HERE’? I always told you that wasn’t me, but I guess that’s not true.” He walked over to the bathroom, the door creaking against the floor. He pulled out his keys, dragging his keys into the wall, carving his name.** 

**“I…I….I..” I was about thirty seconds from mentally shutting down. This was all too much to take in. I pulled out a dirty chair and sat down, checking it to make sure there were no more surprises during this evening.** 

**“I told you it works. I built a time machine!” Mason jumped with joy again, much like a large dog that doesn;t understand it has grown since being a puppy. “Okay, so now you have to help me go back and kill myself. That was the deal.”**

**“I never said that! Dude I’ll sit and talk with you, all night, if you want, but I’m not gonna help you do that, that’s insane! All of this has been insane!”** 

**“You promised!” Mason yelled back, reaching forward and punching me in the chest. Before we could fight more, another bright yellow light engulfed everything, and I found myself tossed back on Mason's apartment floor.** 

**Only, we weren’t alone in the apartment anymore.**

**A yellow man sat on Mason's couch. I don’t know how to describe him, exactly. He wasn’t actually yellow, but when I looked at him I felt the same feeling as the yellow energy surrounding us when I turned on Mason's machine, and the name of THE YELLOW MAN appeared in my head.**  

***WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?*** **The Yellow Man asked us, without moving his mouth.** 

**Mason stood up, surprisingly calm. “I’m going back in time to kill myself, and none of you cant stop me.” The Yellow Man lifted his arm, and Mason was thrown back into the wall, falling into a slumped position.**

***SO YOU ARE THE ONE MESSING WITH TIME.*** **The Yellow Man deduced.** ***YOU MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY. THE FABRIC OF SPACETIME IS AT RISK.*** 

**“That's fine by me! I want to die anyway, I may as well end existence while I'm at it. Go all in.” Mason declared, though his words had slowed down. He was clearly unnerved by this new development.**

**“Hi, I’m Logan.” I casually told The Yellow Man. “I’d rather not die by collapsing the universe. Can you tell us who-what, you are, first though?”**

***I AM THE UNIVERSE. THE PART THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE YOUR NORMAL SPACETIME. YOU RAN THROUGH ME TWICE, AND I’D LIKE IT TO STOP.*** 

**“I didn’t hear a ‘please’.” Mason barked. “We only need to go back once, so I can delete myself. Logan, c’mon.”**

**“Dude, no!” I yelled. “I’m not helping you with that. Even if I wanted to, I already told you it won’t work, right Yellow guy?” I asked, looking at the stranger.** 

***CORRECT. IF HE KILLS HIS PAST SELF, HE WILL NOT GROW UP TO CREATE TIME TRAVEL, AND WILL NOT GO BACK IN TIME TO KILL HIMSELF. IT'S A PARADOX.***

**“Okay, well, the mystery Yellow man is right.” I walked and sat next to Mason. “Buddy, it’s okay. I’m here for you, just tell me what’s going on and I can help-”**

**“You can’t though!” He yelled back. “Fuck it, I’ll do it myself!” Before I could grab him, he launched forward, slamming his hand on his Xbox, and slamming back on the chair. Both myself and The Yellow Man grabbed him before he could vanish, and all three of us traveled to the vast yellow landscape we had seen before.** 

***YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.*** **The Yellow Man projected into our minds.** 

**“Wait, you’ll swear?” I deflected to a sarcastic tone to try to keep myself calm.**

**“Aren’t you, like, God?” Mason asked, copying my coping  mechanism.** 

***NO. I AM ENERGY. ENTROPY. I AM THE UNIVERSE AND WHAT SURROUNDS THE UNIVERSE. AND YOU-*** **He pointed at Mason, all three of us just swimming around in an endless yellow sea.** ***MAY HAVE TRAPPED YOURSELF AND YOUR FRIEND HERE FOR ALL ETERNITY. WE ARE IN THE VOID THAT SURROUNDS YOUR REALITY. YOU WILL NEVER DIE HERE, YOU WILL NEVER SLEEP HERE, YOU WILL BE CONSCIOUS HERE UNTIL YOUR MIND DISSOLVES.*** 

**“Wow, that’s actually the exact opposite of what I was going for with all this.” Mason turned to look at me. “I’m sorry, man.”**

**Rage boiled over. In an endless sea of yellow, I saw red. “You’re sorry? We’re trapped in the cocksucking void because you couldn’t just talk about your feelings! How was any of this-” I waved my hands around, showcasing the nothing surrounding us, “-easier than just sitting with your friend and talking about what’s really bothering you?”**

**“It’s not that easy!” Mason yelled.** 

***I THINK IF WE’RE CAREFUL, WE CAN FIND A WAY BACK.*** **The Yellow Man projected in our heads.** ***WE JUST HAVE TO IONIZE THE HYDROGEN ATO-***

**“Shut up!” Mason and I yelled at the same time. The Yellow Man griminced, but listened to us, turning around to...sulk, I guess. I don’t have a better word. Mason rounded on me. “It’s so easy for people to say ‘oh just talk about what's bothering you, don’t worry it’ll be fine’, but you guys have no idea how hard it is to do that sometimes! Especially when things are really bad!”**

**“Mason.” He quieted down, but I could tell he was still fuming. “We are going to be trapped here. For an eternity, surrounded by the color yellow, with nothing else but each other for company. We will not die, we won’t sleep or pass out, we’ll just float until we go completely insane, and even then, we won’t die. Is that right, yellow guy?”**

***DO NOT CALL ME ‘YELLOW GUY’. MY NAME IS NEVRHGJKNDAMF.***

**I blinked “Can you, uh...repeat that? One more time?”**

***NEVRHGJKNDAMF. IT IS NOT HARD TO PRONOUNCE, JUST TAKE IT SLOW.***

**“I’m….okay, I’m sorry, I have to stick with yellow guy.” The Yellow Man grimaced again, but nodded.** 

***BUT, YES. WITHOUT MY HELP, YOU TWO HUMANS HAVE NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE.*** 

**“Don’t help us until he agrees to talk with me about his problems.” I commanded, pointing at Mason.**

**“Are-are you fucking serious dude? You’re gonna go that far?” Mason looked like he was about to explode, and I suppose he was, just in a different way.** 

**“Absolutely.” I crossed my arms. “Opening up about problems is hard, and scary, but it’s not harder than BUILDING A TIME MACHINE AND SENDING US TO THE VOID! Dude, this could’ve been like an hour long conversation, and now we’re floating in yellow….what is this? It’s not water or air, right?” I asked The Yellow Man.**

***CORRECT. IT IS THE ESSENCE OF ENTROPY, AS AM I.***

**“Oh, thanks. Everything totally makes sense now.” I remarked sarcastically. He smiled, so I think it was lost on him. I turned back to Mason. “If you really think THIS is easier than my way, then fine. We’ll both stay here until our brains dissolve into soup.”**

**Mason deflated, looking around at the vast yellow nothingness. “Fine, we’ll do it your baby way. Fine!” He barked, turning to The Yellow Man. “How do we get out of here, Nevrhgjkndamf?”**

**“Wait, you got that?” I asked, shocked he could pronounce Yellow Guys name.** 

***YOU SHOULD KNOW, WISE ONE. YOU ARE THE ONE WHO BUILT THE TIME MACHINE, AFTER ALL.*** 

**“Well yeah, almost accidentally. This is way beyond me.” Mason defended himself, gesturing again to the yellow void. “I majored in art history.”**

***ART HISTORY? WHAT ARE YOU, GAY?***

**“Yeah, got a problem with it?” He shot back.** 

***N-NO, MAN, LIVE YOUR LIFE. IT’S JUST...WHO MAJORS IN ART HISTORY?*** **Yellow Guy sounded a little scared.**

**I had to actively work to not laugh, and remain supportive. I’m sure it’s hard when a manifestation of the universe tells you your major is bullshit, but it was also hard not to side with it. It is, after all, the essence of the universe, and art history is, after all, the history of art.** 

***ALL WE NEED TO DO IS IONIZE THE HYDROGEN ATOMS IN A SPECIAL WAY, IF I CAN DO THAT, THE RESIDUAL ENERGY RELEASED SHOULD CONVERT INTO-***

**“I feel like if you try to explain it, it’ll ruin it.” I stated. “Maybe just...do it?”**

***YOU’RE VERY RUDE, YOU KNOW THAT? I DON’T WANT TO SEE EITHER OF YOU AFTER THIS, YOU UNDERSTAND?***

**“Yes dad.” Mason said, stuffing down a laugh. I had to grin.** 

**The yellow around us began to shake as The Yellow Man waved his hands around. Sparks seemed to appear in the space between them, and suddenly the surrounding yellow began to turn black. Then blue, then green, and finally I spotted a room in the distance. It looked like it was growing in size, and I realized that was because we were heading right towards it.** 

**I screamed for the THIRD time in an hour, and suddenly Mason's apartment snapped back into reality. The Yellow Man looked at us, nodded, and snapped, destroying the machine Mason had built, before vanishing in a yellow puff of smoke.**

**“Ahhh man, did you have to break the Xbox?” Mason yelled, at nobody. He turned to look at me. “Okay, you win, we’ll do this your way.”**

**“Great. This could’ve been a much simpler evening.” I repeated, walking over to the refrigerator to grab two beers. “We should make sure everything is normal, right?” I pulled out my cell phone and searched who the president of the United States was.** 

**“Donald Trump? I thought Hillary won that election.” Mason stated, looking over at my phone.** 

**“That’s, re...probably not related to us right?”**

**“Did we get Trump elected by going to the void?” Mason groaned. “God dammit. It says there’s something called a ‘coronavirus’? Isn’t that a beer?”**

**“Well, not much we can do about that now.” I said, handing him a closed can of beer. “Let’s talk, man.”**

**And so we did.**
