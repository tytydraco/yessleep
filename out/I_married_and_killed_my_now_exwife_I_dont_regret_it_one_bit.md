I was seventeen years old when Harry Sullivan proposed we killed Esme. 

And it was on our joint wedding day, eight years later, my hands slick with my wife's blood, when his words finally hit me.

There was a drilling sound in my head. 

Sometimes it was loud. 

Other times it was faint, barely noticeable. 

But it was definitely there, getting closer and closer. 

Louder. 

I should have known not inviting Esme Lockhart to our party was a bad idea, but I was too tipsy to care. In my muddled mind, I would deal with the consequences later. Sitting on the beach with my knees pulled to my chest, a cool beer skimming my lips, I watched the tide ripple under my toes. The wind was trying to snatch the bottle from my hand, blowing my hair from my eyes.

Behind me, the party was in full swing, and Esme was being weird again.

Even through sharp blasts of wind trying to knock me over, I could hear her attempting to guilt trip Wylan for talking to a girl. It's not like I didn't expect it. Wylan had told me about the weird notes in his locker, the low-key threats in his mailbox to not even *think* about leaving for college. 

I just didn't want to believe our best friend was *this* kind of obsessed with us. 

If I’m honest, though, Esme was long passed obsession. 

Infatuation.

This girl was a fucking psychopath. 

Downing my beer, I revelled in the scratchy taste. I didn't even like it. But it was better than drinking straight vodka, which made you a psychopath.

Still though, the alcohol was perfect to lower my barriers and force words out of my mouth I had been choking on for years. I liked to think the stars aligned when we were little kids, and fate found us. Five seven year olds with our hands on the last candy bar. Pigtails, Four Eyes, Batman Shirt, Rich Girl, and Yellow Hat.

Initially, we fought for it. I snatched the candy bar up first, claiming finders keepers, only for Pigtails to grab it off of me, waving it in the air triumphantly, only for Four Eyes and Batman Shirt to form an allegiance, taking it for themselves. I shoved Batman Shirt, and he in turn pulled off my hat and made me cry. Rich Girl, who had been wandering around, stepped in. 

We already knew who Rich Girl was. Her parents made more money than the Queen. At least, that’s what the rumour was in class. Rich Girl was *rich* rich, which meant she was either a celebrity, or a long lost princess. 

In reality, her father, Jason Lockhart, had bought our little coastal town. Rich girl plucked the candy bar from the boys, and initiated a truce, splitting it four ways instead. 

It was when she was handing out chunks of chocolate, did we share our names, grinning at each other with chocolatey mouths. 

Pigtails was Ariosa. 

Four Eyes, Harry.

Batman Shirt was Wylan. 

Rich Girl, Esme. 

And Yellow Hat was me. 

The rest was history, I guess. 

Following that day, the five of us became inseparable. In school, we became an unbreakable clique. 

As littles, we made our own games and spent countless hours at the beach on weekends playing pirates. It was fun. 

Those summer days and nights will be etched into my mind forever, a blur of swimming in the sea, eating candy, and sharing stories under a late setting sun. 

Esme would regularly invite us to play at her house, which reminded me of a palace. She had seven bathrooms. Who needed seven bathrooms?

 As littles, we made a pact. On the last day of summer vacation before third grade, we declared *best friends forever.*

Then, when we were twelve, tipsy on Esme’s father’s expensive wine and spread out on a picnic blanket, we said it again, giggling under a crescent moon. 

*Best friends forever.*

It was when we reached high school, Esme started to take our pact a little too seriously.

I loved her as much as I loved the others. 

But she didn't know boundaries.

*Best friends forever* was something a lot different in her mind.

It started subtly. When other kids wanted to hang out with us, she was adamant that it was just the five of us. 

We were fourteen years old and in our freshman year of high school. Making new friends was inevitable. I invited two girls to sit with us at lunch, and Esme immediately stood up, dragging the boys and Ariosa to another table. 

When I stood my ground and plonked down, refusing to follow them, Esme came over and politely asked me to join her and the others. By now, I was getting odd looks from other kids. Esme was a well-known name across town, and so was my name, by default. 

I was already in way too deep with her family to brush her off. Esme’s father had already insisted on paying for my college tuition. I said no initially, though my mother thought it was a great idea. 

Esme had a habit of throwing cash at us when she thought we were going to leave her. 

Harry was promised a football scholarship when he showed signs of drifting away to hang out with the varsity team. When Wylan got a girlfriend, Esme surprised him with the guitar he had been saving up for. 

Ariosa started getting cosy with a classmate, and that classmate’s parents suddenly won a lottery I had never heard of, and moved away. Initially, she isolated us from other kids, even our family, insisting on weekends away and trip’s to exotic locations. But we were growing up, and *best friends forever* was looking progressively less likely.

Esme thought our pact was an unbreakable bond, a need to be near each other constantly and be completely isolated from everyone else. 

Esme thought best friends forever meant we couldn't fall in love, couldn't form relationships. 

She didn't want us to grow up. In junior year, Harry actually went against her wishes and got a boyfriend. Harry Sullivan liked to experiment behind Esme’s back, having been on several dates with both guys and girls. It was well known that he was a player. 

Even if Esme shot down those rumours. But I think he truly fell for Ben. 

Opposites attract, and Harry, captain of the varsity team, falling for Ben Sykes, a quiet competitive swimmer, was the best thing that had happened to our group. Harry was slowly rebelling, which gave us the courage to fly the nest too. Initially, Esme didn't react or say anything. 

In fact, she smiled when Harry awkwardly introduced us, his gaze glued to Esme. He was waiting for her to start screaming, his eyes hard, lips ready to argue. But she didn't. Esme offered Ben a seat. Wylan shot me a look, and Ariosa almost choked on her sandwich. 

Harry didn't let his guard down, though. He politely declined her offer, and joined the varsity table instead. Harry Sullivan was slowly but surely moving away from us, away from *best friends forever*, and our stupid childhood pact. 

He wanted his own life, his own friends. Ben was the start of that. Again, I was sure Esme was planning something. 

She forced Wylan’s friends to move schools, and ripped Ariosa’s boyfriend out of town, so it didn't make sense to me why she was letting Harry get away with it. 

She even restricted us from talking to adults, unless it was our parents.

Harry could have limited conversation with his coach (only in school time) and Wylan was only able to join the drama club if he promised to let the rest of us sit in the audience. If that wasn't weird enough, we were permitted to tell her everything. Every secret we had, or worry on our minds. 

Obviously, we didn't. 

There was no way I was telling her about my (late) first period, and I was  pretty sure the boys would rather die than share their private lives. 

Sometimes, we didn't have a choice. Esme would lock us in her car and demand every private detail, and it was less exhausting to just spill our guts. 

I made the mistake of talking to a girl, Emma, at the start of the year. Esme may not have been in all of my classes, but she had spies, kids that were paid a decent sum of cash to make sure none of her *friends* were socialising. 

Emma switched classes a day later, and when I tracked her down in the hallway, her eyes widened, like she was frightened. 

Emma told me to stay away from her, so I did. 

I didn't have a fucking choice. 

I should have known the boy watching us gush over TV show crushes was loyal to Esme.

I thought she was okay with Harry dating someone. I mean, she didn't throw a screaming fit like usual. 

Which was progress. 

I was surprised she was actually allowing someone into the group. 

Esme seemed genuinely happy with Harry's boyfriend joining our group, allowing him to come to hang out at her house, and our usual place on the beach. 

The holidays came around, and Ariosa proposed a Christmas party at her place. 

I was two hours late, after a heated argument with Mom over the car. 

When I arrived, I immediately knew something was wrong. There was no music, and the lights were off. I did see an attempt at a party, grabbing myself some holiday themed punch from the lounge. 

The figure sitting alone in the kitchen caught me off guard. It was pitch black, so I thought it was the ghost of Christmas past, after Esme forced us to watch Christmas movies with her a few days prior. When I clicked on the light, however, an identity swam into view. 

Ben. Judging from the cans scattered on the table, he was maybe five or six drinks down. Harry's boyfriend regarded me with an almost pitiful smile. “Hey, Thea.” His voice was a kind of croak. Ben held up his can in a mocking salute. “Merry Christmas.”

“Hey.” I poured him a glass of water, sitting down hesitantly, my hands wrapped around a glass of punch. “Is everything okay?”

“Oh yeah, I'm great,” Ben’s sarcasm needed work. Harry was a master of irony, so maybe he was rubbing off on him. Ben downed another beer. “I missed a swim meet to come to this stupid party.”

Ouch. 

Technically, it was an Esme centred party, so we were all there against our will. 

I nodded, sipping my punch. It was kind of spicy. “So, where's everyone else?”

Ben met my gaze, his lips curling. “Where do you think?”

I shrugged. “I dunno. Did they go out?”

I think Ben was waiting for me to give him a reason to find Harry. I couldn't give him one without going against her  family, and putting myself in danger. 

The boy scoffed. “Whatever, Thea,” he stood up. “Tell that bastard I never want to see him again,” he mumbled, staggering out of the kitchen. 

Ben stopped in the doorway, but he didn't turn around. “You guys deserve each other,” he laughed, and something ice cold prickled its way down my spine. I didn't even wait for Ben to leave, and by the sound of it, he was already emptying his guts in the front hallway. Ignoring him, I forced my legs upstairs, my heart hammering. 

There was no way, right? 

Because if Esme had done this, then she had won. 

The girl had a perfectly calculated plan after all. 

Esme didn't want Harry to be intimate with anyone else but her. 

I realised that when I stumbled into a lot of tangled legs and flushed faces under blankets. Wylan told me to turn off the light, but I was too stunned to move. 

This wasn't what I expected. Esme wanted us as friends. But this was different. This was closer, more intimate, where she could have *every* part of us, body, mind, and soul. The logical side of my brain wondered if she had become so scared that we would find love and ruin our friendship pact, she immediately wanted us to love her instead. 

While the not so alert part of my brain wanted to entangle myself in their weird foursome sandwich. 

So, I joined them. 

I mean, it was cold, the punch was definitely filled with aphrodisiacs to influence guests, and seeing Harry buried under Esme, his legs tangled around Ariosa, I'd say Esme’s plan had succeeded. I didn't want to know what Ben saw. Later on, I discovered that he walked in on them, and Harry, fully bewitched by Esme’s spell, ignored him. Ben was right. We did deserve each other. Esme had made sure of that. 

I was feeling a little more than heated, so yeah, I crawled into bed with them.

I wanted to believe it meant something. 

Even if I knew deep down, Esme was tightening her iron grip. 

Ever since that night, our relationship became more intimate, which brought us closer together. But we never actually dated. Esme didn't want to date us, she just didn't want anyone *else* to date us. Most of my junior and senior year was a blur of blindly following orders, and watching the light slowly start to fizzle out in my friend’s eyes. 

Esme demanded we move in with her, though luckily our parents stepped in. 

When she started talking about *friendship marriage*, I think that was when we decided that we were done.

Best friends forever would *never* continue into college. I was sure of it. 

Harry was the first to get a football scholarship. 

Halfway across the country. 

Esme did what she always did. She smiled through gritted teeth, congratulating him with a hug. 

I caught Wylan’s *Oh, fuck* look, pretending to choke on his drink. We already knew she was planning something potentially life ruining. 

We took bets. 

Wylan was convinced her father would buy the college itself. 

Ariosa went down a darker route, saying Esme would burn the campus to the ground. 

Esme did neither, attempting manipulation more directly. 

In the days following his announcement, Harry had received three *anonymous* death threats, and a stuffed rabbit filled with pigs blood thrown in his locker. When he talked to his parents, they went straight to the police, only to drop the case several hours later after a talk with her dad. 

Harry said it was like his parents had been hypnotised. 

Esme turned the whole town against us, so we had no choice but to run back to her. 

Wylan *talked* to a girl during gym, and one of Esme’s spies immediately reported it. 

I accidentally smiled at Josh Pieck in AP English, and received a strongly worded email to not even look at him. 

Senior year drew to a close, and our only solace was a stupid party on the beach. I made sure to only invite kids who either hated Esme, or had offered us their help in the past. They were too scared to turn up. Emily Littlewood said her family could get us fake IDs and out of town. She sent Ariosa a text from an unknown number, only disclosing her name in cryptic code. 

Emily's parents were in a car crash hours later. 

Anyone who tried to help us were either hurt, or cut out of the picture. 

We were officially on our own. 

Presently, I felt sick to my stomach. I got an email from a college I didn't even apply to, congratulating me on my acceptance. The college just so happened to be the one Wylan and Ariosa were accepted into, and of course, Harry was going there too. 

The letter was stuffed in my pocket, and I was planning on burning it. It was my way of breaking this stupid pact. 

We were *not* going to be best friends forever, because in Esme’s eyes, she didn't see the four of us friends. 

Esme saw us as trophies. Pretty things she could call *hers*. 

Fuck that. 

We built a fire on the beach. Harry pulled out his acceptance letter first, and in our own private ceremony, we took turns throwing them into the flames. I wanted to laugh in relief, but I was too scared to laugh, too scared to smile, constantly looking over my shoulder to see if we were being watched. 

I started to let my guard down, slumping on the sand to eat charred marshmallows and talk shit, when Esme herself turned up with a crate of beers.

Wylan shot me a death glare, because I was usually the one who accidentally exposed our location. 

But I had been so careful. 

Ariosa immediately stiffened up, and Harry rolled his eyes, draining the rest of his beer. I think he was expecting it.

We had all mutually agreed that Esme and her family were witches.

Ariosa’s expression twisted with genuine fright, and she panicked, plucking the smouldered remains of our letters from the fire and stuffing them in her backpack. I was sure she burned herself from the way she kept wafting her hand, wrapping her fingers around an icy beer, though she was more scared of getting caught trashing Esme’s *gift*. 

Luckily, Esme didn't notice, excusing herself for being late. 

Harry was uncharacteristically snappy, leaning forward in his chair. The boy wasn't even trying to hide his disdain for her. Two days before, he broke down in my car. It was the only place without a camera, without spies hanging around. 

Wylan was sleeping in the back, and Ariosa was dozing in his lap. Harry kept it together until I asked him if he was okay, and his body kind of jerked, like he was trembling. He had spent the whole car ride staring into oblivion, his eyes half lidded, lips curled into an almost maniacal smile. 

I didn't notice he was clinging onto his seat for dear life, like Esme was going to pop up out of nowhere. *I can't do this anymore.* He kept saying it again and again and again, until his fingers were clawing at his hair, and he was screaming, his eyes almost feral, like a wild animal. *I can't fucking do this anymore, she's going to kill me.*

I hugged him. It was all I could do.

Just a few more weeks, I told him. 

Then we would be free. 

“How did you know we were here?” Harry's eyes narrowed, lips curling. “Are you stalking us, Esme?”

His tone was like warm water washing over me. 

I thought it might *finally* push her away. 

Esme shot him a grin. “I always know where you are,” she said, ruffling his hair. “I was just making last minute arrangements for something special.”

Harry wasn't playing around, scoffing through another mouthful of beer. 

“And what's *that*?” he mumbled under his breath. “Another death threat?”

Esme seemed to notice his disobedience, though she didn't say anything, maintaining her wide smile. 

“That's a secret.”

Harry sat back in his chair, nursing another beer. Wylan nudged him to stop drinking, but he protested with a groan, slurping from the can. 

“I'm sick of being ordered around,” he said, downing another beer, as if in protest. “I'm going to do whatever I fucking want,” his half lidded gaze fell on Esme, who had visibly stiffened up. “You do whatever the fuck you want, and I'll do whatever the fuck I want.” he saluted her with his drink. “All right?”

When Esme didn't respond, Harry threw his empty can at her.

The girl didn't even flinch. 

“I'm going to Duke, you psycho sponge,” Harry spat, and I caught Wylan’s wry smile. Ariosa’s expression brightened. Duke was always his first choice. 

“I don't *want* to go to your fucking college, Esme. I don't *want* to be anywhere near you or your family. You're a leech. You leech onto people and suck the life out of them, and… and then throw money at them when they want to leave! What you're doing is borderline psycho. You take *everything* away from us. When we find friends, you make them disappear, and when we find someone, you throw yourself at us! Like a leech!” 

Gulping down beer, he was just getting started. 

“That night with Ben,” Harry choked out, “You fucked with our heads.”

He spluttered on a sob, and Ari moved to grab his hand, but he shoved her away, his lips curling into a snarl, angrily swiping at his eyes. 

“No, get off of me, it needs to be said!” his gaze flicked back to Esme. 

“You turned my parents into mindless followers of yours so you could keep me under your control. You manipulate us with money and vacations, and fancy scholarships. I mean, who fucking does that, huh? What kind of person goes to these kinds of lengths to keep friends?” he laughed. 

“You threaten and isolate us, and seriously think we want to be *friends?*”

Harry let out a shuddery breath. 

“So, here's what you're going to do. You're going to leave me and my parents alone. The same goes for Ari, Thea, and Wylan. You're going to get your father to fire my parents, and then you're going to get your ‘connections’ you keep bragging about to cancel the scholarship I don't even want. If you don't, I'll happily contact the police, and get your ass thrown in jail for stalking.”

His smile was harsh, almost manic, when Esme opened her mouth. Harry tipped his head back, dazedly blinking at the sky. “Not the police under your dad’s thumb,” he said with a snort. “I’m not fucking stupid. I mean outside of town, where you'll face actual consequences.” his eyes darkened. 

“After tonight, I don't want to see your face again.” His words were venomous, and I revelled  in each one. “Find new friends in college, Esme, and pray that they tolerate your psycho bullshit…” 

Harry's voice faded out, the sea suddenly so much louder in my ears, waves crashing onto the sand, before drifting back. “...And don't put you six feet under the fuckin’ ground.”

Esme seemed frozen for a moment, and we all waited with baited breath. 

Was this it? Would she finally leave us alone? 

Instead of replying, the girl turned her attention away from Harry, and plonked herself down on Ariosa’s lap, chastising Wylan for wearing a short sleeved shirt. 

Esme insisted on styling us, like we were dolls. She hated when Ariosa tied up her hair, and I wasn't allowed to straighten my curls. Harry had to wear contact lenses (if he wore glasses, she ignored him for days). When he lost his contacts and *had* to wear glasses, Esme bought him unlimited contacts. 

Harry didn't respond to Esme ignoring him, instead cracking open another beer. He shot me a grin, which was a little too wide. Jesus fucking Christ, I remember thinking. He was losing his mind. 

*Mission accomplished*.

If drunk Harry thought it was mission accomplished, Sober Harry was in for a rude awakening. The girl’s lack of response wasn't a win. It was a timebomb. Esme started talking about her own college acceptance letter, and I caught him glaring at her, his fingers pulverising the can. I hated what she was in the process of turning him into. 

Wylan was staying quiet, absently making a mini sand castle, and Ariosa was snoozing on the sand. 

The party was primarily to plan a quiet escape, and once AGAIN Esme had made it about her.

I excused myself, escaping down to the shallows. 

The silence was a relief. I dropped onto my butt, letting the tide wash over my feet. Sticking my toes in bioluminescent plankton, I wondered how a candy bar had single handedly ruined my life. 

Esme was making a fool out of herself again. 

In the corner of my eye, she was standing with her hands on her hips, blonde curls being whipped around in the wind. Wylan had done something wrong. I had no idea what it was, though from the sound of her voice, it sounded like he'd been hiding a friend. 

It was when I was watching the sea wash up on the sand, I heard it again. 

Drilling. 

It felt close, but also far away.

“We could just kill her, you know.”

Harry was standing behind me, swaying slightly, a fresh drink in his hand. He looked like a ghost under a moonlit sky, his cheeks were too pale, dark brown hair glued to his forehead with sweat. 

He wasn't smiling. Esme said it was his best attribute, so he made sure to never smile around her. I took a moment to drink in how hollow the boy looked, both body and mind, his dark eyes barely focusing on me. Esme had turned him into a shell of himself. Not just Harry. 

Ariosa had lost that glow to her skin, and I was sure Wylan was going grey at seventeen. Even looking at myself in the mirror, I was constantly on edge, my cheeks starting to deflate. 

Turning back to the sea, I pressed my knees closer to my chest. The drilling was getting louder. It felt and sounded closer when I lowered my head, like if I turned at the right angle, I would hear it better. “You have a death wish, idiot.”

Harry snorted, slumping down next to me and resting his chin on his knees. He reached into his shorts and pulled out a cigarette, lit it up, and took a long drag. 

The orange glow settled my dancing stomach. “I’m serious,” he said, lips curved around the cigarette. “We kill her, and dump her body in the sea. Then run the fuck away. Problem solved.”

“Problem still there,” I said pointedly, “You just declared war on a psychopath.”

I shoved him, and he pulled a face, shoving me back. “Since when do you smoke?” 

Harry's gaze strayed on the ocean, smoke escaping his lips. “Since Ben.”

His words stung. 

“Well, what about Esme’s dad?” I challenged him, changing the subject. I straightened up, stretching my legs. “We’ll have to kill him too, right?” I could see him trying not to smile around the smoke. So, I continued, eager to bring back the boy I grew up with. Even if it was just for one night. 

“Psycho *sponge*?”

He groaned. “It was a good insult in my head.”

“It was a terrible insult! Did you see Wylan’s face?”

Harry laughed, and it was a good laugh, one that made me feel safe, despite knowing we were being watched. “We are going to leave here, don't worry,” He shot me a grin. “I told her to leave us alone, and…” Harry arched his neck, twisting around. “I think she got the memo? I hope she has, anyway…” 

Nodding along, I took in Harry's words, though they were fading in and out. 

I could hear that noise again. 

It was real, a loud drilling in the back of my head. Looking up at the sky, it was suddenly *too* black, like an endless oblivion that would never brighten. 

The sea lapping over my feet felt wrong, somehow. 

Like it wasn't even wet. 

The sand bunched between my fists was too perfect. 

Perfect white sand, filtering through my fingers. 

It was the kind of sand I dreamed of, unlike the actual beach which was mostly pointed rocks and spiky shells. It was too *perfect*. I looked around, gulping down air. Ariosa and Wylan trying to get the fire going, and Esme handing out food. The perfect night. 

The stars twinkling above us.

The perfect sky. 

“Harry.” my voice sounded wrong, like the words on my lips weren't mine.

He didn't look at me. “Yeah?”

“How many times have we had this conversation?”

*How many times have we had this conversation?”*

*How many times have we had this conversation?”*

*How many times have we had this conversation?”*

*How many times have we had this conversation?”*

*How many times have we had this conversation?”*

Did I say that 5 times?

10? 

15?

20?

The moon flickered, and went out completely.

And I fell through the sand, dragged down. 

Down. 

Down. 

Down. 

The drilling was louder, closer. 

Real. 

I could feel it, a blade pulverising through the back of my head, screeching blades dragging my thoughts to awareness. I could feel it seeping from me, blood dripping down my face and neck, pooling across the table I lay on. I opened my mouth to scream, but my lips were detached from me, my voice no longer mine. 

Instead, my mind was suddenly in permanent rewind. 

I was back on the beach, and this time Harry was smiling. His original words were torn away, that cutting blade slicing its way through my brain. “So here's what you're going to do,” his voice echoed, and he jumped up, picking Esme up and spinning her around. “You're going to stay with us. Forever. Never leave any of our sides.”

**“You're a leech!”** 

“You're the most beautiful girl I've ever met. I want to be with you, Esme. Forever.”

**I can't fucking take this anymore. She’s going to kill me.** 

This time, I did scream, a raw cry ripping from my throat. 

I could sense bright light behind my eyes. 

My wrists were strapped down, my head pinned to a cruel icy surface. 

Harry's voice continued, clanging in my skull. 

“I love her, Thea. I love her so much it hurts!”

It was endless. 

It never stopped, and my screams died out into whimpers. They didn't even bother sedating me again. I felt everything, every cut and slice, the warmth that glued my hair to my face, and the saw that sheared all of it off.

When the white light faded, and flashing colours dotted my vision, I finally fell. 

“Thea?”

When I opened my eyes, I was standing up. 

No longer on the beach, I stood barefoot in front of an indoor swimming pool lit up in pale blue light. 

I was so close to the edge, a white dress pooling at my feet, my hands wrapped around a bouquet of flowers. 

I found myself smiling. Even when I reached a trembling hand to my head, where a veil had been forced into place. I stroked my fingers across my scalp, where old stitches had come apart, seeping red staining the collar of my dress and ruining my hair. When my fingers came back slick red, I swiftly wiped them on my dress, smiling wider. 

*Roses.*

I clutched the bouquet tighter to my chest. 

They were Esme’s favorite. 

“Thea! Snap out of it!”

The man's voice startled me, reverberating through the room. I blinked, my vision swimming in and out of view. He was older than me, at least in his mid twenties, thick, brown hair hanging in dark eyes that part of me recognised. The flower crown of white roses sitting on top of his head looked like a joke, a mockery of him. 

I didn't register the bloody sfrips of white wrapped around his head or the smear of red staining the front of his suit. Instead, I was choking on a name that shouldn't have matched the stranger. 

No, not a stranger. 

Harry Sullivan was not 25 years old. 

Because if he was 25, then how old was I? I looked down at myself. I still felt seventeen, and yet I was taller, my dress perfectly fitted to my figure. I was seventeen, but my body was older, so much maturer, moulded and perfected.

No.

I felt my legs give-way, a cry rumbling in my throat. 

I was going to go to college. 

I was going to get away from her. 

How long had I truly been sitting on the beach on the last day of senior year? 

“Thea, listen to me.” his hands found mine, clammy and stained with blood, but his. It was him, and I wanted to cry, wanted to ask *how* he had jumped forwards in time, when I already knew the truth. I was in denial, and denial was agony. I moved to wrap my arms around my friend, but he shook his head. 

“No, don't move,” he hissed out, “If you move, she'll know something is up.”

Opening my mouth, my throat tasted of rusty change.

How long? I wanted to scream, my chest aching.

Harry didn't speak. He didn't explain the strips of white wrapped around his head, or the others’ absence. He pressed something into my hand, delving it between the folds of my dress. The knife slid perfectly between my fingers, the blade pricking my skin. 

I didn't feel anything. “Kill the bitch,” he said through gritted teeth. Harry didn't cry. I don't think he *could* cry anymore. 

“Do you hear me?” he whispered, his voice collapsing into a sob. I wanted to know what had happened to him, what eight years had done to my best friend.

“Fucking *kill* her, Thea.”

The doors flew open, the sound of heels clicking loudly on marble.

Harry dropped to his knees, and I straightened up, fashioning my expression back to vacant. I wanted to help him. He couldn't stand up, his head bowed. If I was going to kill her, though, I had to catch her off guard. 

Esme appeared, a blur of golden curls and fluffy pink. She was noticeably older too. Esme Lockhart was still beautiful, almost breathtakingly so. Her expression may have looked maturer, but that psychotic gleam was still there, twinkling in her eyes. “Harry,” her voice was more of a bird-like squawk. 

I stayed frozen, watching the girl march over to him, entangling her arms around his waist. “You do realize it's bad luck for the groom to see his bride the night before.” Harry didn't fight back when she pulled out a silk cloth, wrapping it around his eyes, her hand slipping over his mouth. Esme’s lips found his ear, and I heard every word. This was the first time I'd heard her actually scared. 

“Since you're *insistent* on ruining our perfect day, I want to give you your wedding present early.”  Esme’s voice was silky smooth, sultry. She held him like a toy, rocking him side to side. Harry didn't move, crumpling in her arms. His frenzied eyes found mine. 

*Kill her*. 

“Come on,” she crooned, “Dad is waiting for you.”

I wanted to kill her right there, before she could drag my friend away. 

But something snapped in my head, and I was back on the beach. 

This time the tide was in, and I was sitting alone. 

Behind me, Esme was the only one sitting by our fire. 

*“Thea!”* she shouted, waving at me to join her.

The tide was at my feet, but I couldn't even feel it anymore.

There were no stars. 

“Thea.”

Reality was being cruel to me. 

It wouldn't let me sleep. 

This time, I awoke under a beautiful blue sky.

Above me was a flower arch made of roses. 

Rows of strangers with wide smiles sitting under trees entangled with lights. 

Standing on my left was Ariosa. Her red hair was piled on her head, perfectly fitted with a flower crown. Her smile was too wide, intricately made up eyes half lidded, and I was sure she had wet herself through her wedding dress. 

Ariosa wasn't really herself anymore, her gaze penetrating right through me. 

I could see dark red smearing the top of her head. 

Neither was Wylan, sculpted in a rich black suit. The boy was unrecognisable, hiding behind a mop of blonde curls, and a nose job I knew he didn't need. Wylan had grown up, maturing into a handsome man. But once I was staring at him, I couldn't stop. I glimpsed tell tale spots of blood staining his collar. 

His grin was dazed, drool seeping down his chin. Wylan was standing at an angle, swaying back and forth, that glitter which was my best friend, gone. 

“Thea!”

I blinked. Esme was inches away from me, the bride. 

“Pay attention!”

I found myself nodding obediently. 

In a few simple words, she was going to become my wife. 

The knife was tucked into my dress.

Harry was standing next to me. I didn't want to look at him, because I knew what Esme’s wedding gift was. In the corner of my eye, I glimpsed a thin line of black trickling down his temple, scarlet bandages hidden under that hideous fucking flower crown. 

His eyes were lazily following a butterfly, and he could barely stand still. Harry was the one who tried to get away, who clawed his way out of her control. Esme had decided to take his free will by force. 

The others spoke their vows, like they had been cemented inside their minds. 

“I…” 

Harry Sullivan. 

Ariosa Carlisle. 

Wylan Sutton.

Thea Samuels. 

“Take Esme Analise Lockhart to be my wife, to have and to hold from this day forward. For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, until parted by death.”

“I…”

Harry blinked, his lips forming a smile. 

“I… do.”

Ariosa giggled all the way through her speech, which was unintelligible. 

Wylan sealed his vow, grinning through a mouthful of scarlet. 

I think seeing him is what jerked my thoughts to fruition. 

She had taken my friends, ripped away their youth, and now took their minds. 

I think I said *I do.* 

The wedding party exploded into cheering, and we were showered in confetti. 

The officiator turned to me, and I saw bright, intense red. 

Fuck. I don't even remember moving. 

One second I was standing still, and the next, I was straddling my new wife, stabbing her straight through the throat.

I had to cut every order she had ever demanded of us directly from her mouth. Parted by death. The officiator’s words were ringing in my skull. 

We were free. 

She cut into my head and turned me into the perfect wife. 

She turned my best friend's into mindless shells. 

The wedding party was screaming, and so was I. 

 *Help.*

Blood was slick between my hands, but it felt good. 

*I need help.*

There was no sign of my parents, anyone I knew. I didn't even see Esme’s father. I kicked off my heels and ran, and luckily, Ariosa thought it was a game, following me, grabbing Wylan. 

Knowing that I would regret it if I left him, I pulled a barely responsive Harry along too, who awkwardly stumbled after me. We made it out of the hotel grounds, and I called the police, who immediately sent us to urgent care. 

I spent two weeks in the emergency room, and I got two visitors. Emma, from high school. She hugged me, and so did her five year old girl. The second visitor was a surprise. Ben, Harry's old boyfriend who was now a cop, had been tracking us down since our “death” when we were seventeen. Apparently,  Esme faked our deaths. 

Ben told me my parents left town a year after my death. He had contacted them multiple times, but no reply. 

They weren't interested. 

Which was understandable. 

If someone told me my dead daughter was in fact alive and forced to marry her best friend, I wouldn't engage either. 

I asked Ben if he'd been to see Harry, and he nodded, his cheeks going pale. 

He told me the words I didn't want to hear. 

Harry wasn't Harry Sullivan anymore. The doctors explained it in more medical terms, *a foreign object being obstructed through the skull and damaging the frontal lobe* or something like that, I wasn't really listening. Ben started talking about serious damage to the brain, and I was on my knees on cool tiles, choking up my lunch. I knew exactly what it was. 

Harry had been partially lobotomised, in a desperate attempt to subjugate him.

So, if my friends were lobotomised, what happened to me? 

I was drilled through the head. I got the same treatment. 

So, why was I awake and conscious, and they were braindead? 

I've been living with Ben for the last two years. 

Ari and Wylan have recovered, in a way. 

I say *in a way* because I'm lying to myself. 

They're completely different people. Wylan is erratic and acts like a child, and Ariosa repeatedly tells me how much she hates me. 

Their lack of emotion scares me. The doctors are puzzled. They didn't think it was possible to make as much progress as they have, but Jason Song was also using technology that they had never seen Before. Ben argued that lobotomies don't control your mind, they destroy it. He was convinced something else was being used, which sent me to sleep for seven years, forcing my body into autopilot. It would explain Wylan and Ari’s behaviour too. 

How they had somehow recovered, or *sort of recovered* from a lobotomy. 

Harry spoke for the first time a few days ago. 

I have a habit of visiting him when Ben isn't guarding his bed side. 

I wasn't there when he spoke. I was buying soda when Ben stumbled out of the room, vomiting everywhere. 

Unable to resist, I hurried inside. 

Harry was sitting up, propped up on pillows. 

His eyes were so much more alert, which gave me hope. 

Until he opened his mouth. 

Inclining his head, Harry frowned at me. Ariosa and Wylan have been looking behind me a lot. I thought they were staring into mid air, but Harry was staring at the exact same spot. Just behind my right shoulder. He spoke her name with a glitter in his eye, and I think in his mind, Harry could still see her. 

And Esme was still the love of his –our– lives. 

When I shut the door and sat down, his expression darkened.

I hate that I can see so much of *her* in him. 

And it terrifies me.

Harry was looking behind me, craning his neck. 

“Where did my *wife* go?”

I told him she was dead, only for him to laugh. 

“No she's not,” Harry said, like a child acting out. “She was just *right* there!”

I know Esme can't be alive, but Ariosa and Wylan say the same thing. 

That she's always standing right behind me.
