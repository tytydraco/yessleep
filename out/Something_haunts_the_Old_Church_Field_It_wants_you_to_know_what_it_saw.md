There is a place south of the Mason-Dixon, known as the Old Church Field. There on the 7th of December 1863, a small, insignificant skirmish of the Civil War took place. It had little effect on the fortunes of either side and saw relatively few dead, so it is all but forgotten by most people, north and south. But I remember, I remember because I was there, every night for 17 years. 

My parents bought the farmhouse when I was two or three, and I lived there until I joined the army. And in most ways, it was a paradise. Warm summer days and cool winter nights around the fire, a stream running through the yard. But that dirt, those stones, and that water had all soaked up more than blood back in 1863; some part of the men who died there remained. I wouldn’t call it a ghost, a ghost implies too much in the way of intelligence. Which I do not believe this thing had, but it was there all the same, I swear that to you. 

For most of my early life, I was plagued by bad dreams. They got so bad that eventually my mom made me see a shrink. He said he thought I was suffering from PTSD, but after digging for months, making me relive things I didn’t want to. He could not find anything in my past that would cause it. Because, of course, dreams aren’t real. But these were. 

Every night it would start the same: after hours of fighting to stay awake, I would slip into an uneasy sleep. Then I would hear the sound of breaking twigs as Johnny stepped over that dry log. He was from Kentucky and had a girl back home, he had described her once, I knew that much, though not the description. It was before the dream, so I never lived it. He would turn to make some joke, a favored pastime of his, and then every night for 17 years, I would watch the Yankee bullet clip a neat red line through his hair, it hardly even bled. The cannons would pound and the shots would ring, and we would fight for minutes that made hours seem short. Then Colonel Mulroon would sound retreat, and it would all be over. I woke up every night right as we ran past the barn. 

But these weren’t dreams; every morning I would smell the powder smoke on my pajamas and see the dirt caked under my nails. So did my folks, but they always found a way to make excuses. 

It took many years before I had an idea what was going on, and then I tried to make it stop. I combed every inch of that field with a metal detector, looking for something, I don’t know what. But whatever it was, I knew if I found it, then I would be free; I never did. 

I tried once to find his grave. I had a name from the other life, but a lot of men died in that war, and not all were given proper burials. If Johnny is out there, I never could find him. And I suppose he would have been weirded out by some kid crying over his bones, but I knew him then. In the war before I was born. 

Don’t worry, if’n something like this happens to you, some places are just haunted, I suppose. And they keep, and they hold some part of the truth, of the horror they saw long ago. Don’t live there, like I did. That was a bad idea, but for a night or two, you should be fine. 

Just remember when you wake up covered in sweat, reeking of gunpowder and blood. That nothing can change this, and nothing can fix it. But nothing wants to hurt you either, they just want another soul to remember the things that they saw once before.
