The end

Ever since I was a child my life has been perfect. I was always playing with my friends, I excelled in my school's swimming team and my grades were good. It was like this up until high school, because at that point “playing” was replaced by “hanging out” and I started to engage with the opposite gender. To much success, I might add. The weekdays were spent in school, always conversing with my classmates as the extroverted person I am. Since I had no problem achieving good grades, I spent plenty of time helping my friends with their work. Helping others was something I always did, simply because I accepted every offer to be accompanied by another person with overwhelming joy. The part about working didn’t bother me, that's how extroverted I was. During the weekends I partied hard, drank heavy and made memories like never before.
When I reached adulthood I started a company. It was doing fine since the beginning, but it grew big just recently. Me and my girlfriend, with whom I started the company with when she moved into my house, now live in luxury despite our young age. Never has my life ever been bad, it has always been embossed by success. It came to a point where I started to believe that the universe had decided to destine me for success. That was until a month ago.
“Goodbye honey, see you in a while” said my girlfriend as she walked out the front door on her way to the taxi parked on the street outside.

 “Bye” I answered, bothered about the fact that I was going to be alone for such a long time. Well, a month felt long for me, and my girlfriend was well aware of that. I was a little irritated that she would even consider leaving me for such a long time, but there I was. She wasn't.

After she left, I went directly to the kitchen to make a sandwich to eat while watching the red sox play their last game of the season.. When I took the bread to cut it, I realized that it was emitting a weird smell. “Weird” I said out loud as I threw the bread in the trash can, “I bought that just yesterday”. Without a sandwich I made my way to the living room. Upon turning on the TV I was met with the realization that I had mistaken the time of which the game started. They had already played for a staggering 58 minutes, and on top of that I noticed that the red sox were 20 points under. “Man, that's some bullshit dawg” I thought to myself. By this point I was properly fed up and thus made the decision to go to bed. I spent hours trying to sleep, turning and twisting my torso like a drill, but to little success. It was firstly after six hours that I fell into an unpleasant state of sleep, or should I say paralysis, because that's closer to what it felt like. Several nightmares plagued my brain that night. One of them was that I took a leak into the mouth of an ugly beast. The stream of piss coming from my schlong formed the initials “WC” before disappearing into the abyss that was the demon’s throat.

When I woke up in the middle of the night after the intense two hours of sleep I had just experienced, I realized that I had wet the bed. The sheets were soaked in the yellowness of my dehydrated piss. I shouldn't even mention the smell out of respect to your nose, but it was something that I'm certain would have reminded my grandfather of his days in the gulag. Cleaning that mess up was nothing I felt keen on doing, so I made the decision to let it soak in and act as if it hadn't happened. The sound of a notification coming from my cellular device filled my ears. A message from a few hours ago sat in the middle of the screen, informing me that my business had gone bankrupt. Under that message was another message, the one which had caused the notification: “I'm deputy Nicholas Clay, stationed at Traverse City police department. I'm sorry to inform you of your girlfriend's death this evening. For further information, call 231 *** *** ***”. I would have cried, but my heart was made out of cold stone. Every cell within the structure of my body was filled with a pound of hate, a pound of anger, and two pounds of despair, but no matter how hard I searched, no matter how deep I dug, no matter how many cells I split wide open, there was no humanity to be found.

 Driven by pure evil, I grabbed a long knife from the kitchen and went out in the cold, unforgiving night, wearing nothing but my piss-soaked underwear. I headed towards the city center. When I got there my eyes locked themselves on a homeless man sleeping by a store's facade in a sitting position. He was horribly ugly, smelled just like the piss on my boxers, but most important of all, he evoked my desire to kill. Taking large strides I decreased the distance between us. I put the knife by his face and grabbed his throat. It was hot. So hot that I immediately released him from my grip. His breath made me sick with every existing disease, known or unknown to man. Earthworms rested on the outside of his cranium, holding on by penetrating his rotten scalp. My knife was melting down my hand, and it made my sense of touch go away. I only managed to let out an excruciating scream of agony, so loud that it made my own ears deaf in an instant. The creature that sat in front of me was not a man, it was a point of concentrated evilness. I searched for eye contact, and when the horrible yellow eyes met mine, I could only read the face for a few seconds before going blind.
“Are you ready”?
