I had always been curious about my twin brother's life, especially since he had passed away so suddenly. We were close growing up, but as we got older, we grew apart and I never really knew what was going on in his life. So, when I found his diary hidden away in his room, I couldn't resist the urge to read it.

The first few entries were mundane, detailing his daily routines and his struggles at work. But as I kept reading, the entries became increasingly disturbing. He wrote about strange dreams that he had been having, about seeing shadows moving in the corner of his eye, and about feeling like he was being watched.

I dismissed it as just the ramblings of a troubled mind. But as I kept reading, the entries became even more disturbing. He wrote about hearing voices whispering his name in the middle of the night, about feeling a presence in his room, and about waking up to find scratches on his body.

I was starting to get worried about my brother's mental state, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to these entries than just the ravings of a madman. I had to know more, so I kept reading.

The final entry was the most chilling of all. My brother wrote about a dream he had, in which he was standing in a dark, foggy forest. He could see a figure standing in the distance, and as he got closer, he realized that it was his own reflection. But when he looked closer, he saw that the reflection had eyes that were black as coal and a mouth twisted into a sinister grin.

I woke up in a cold sweat, with the feeling that someone, or something, was still watching me. I couldn't shake the feeling that my twin brother's diary was trying to tell me something, something that I wasn't ready to hear.

After that evening I never read that diary again. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched and followed by something. I never found an explanation for what my brother wrote in his diary, but I know one thing for sure, I never want to relive that experience again.

I woke up in a cold sweat, with the feeling that someone, or something, was still watching me. I couldn't shake the feeling that my twin brother's diary was trying to tell me something, something that I wasn't ready to hear.

As I was going through some of my brother's old things, I found a box of old polaroids. I flipped through them and found a picture of my brother and me as kids, but something was off. In the background, there was a figure standing behind us, it was the same figure my brother described in his diary, with black eyes and a twisted grin. I couldn't believe it, it was as if the figure from my brother's diary was real and had been following us all along.

I realized that my twin brother's diary wasn't just the ravings of a madman, but a warning. A warning to keep away from the figure that had been tormenting him, and now, it seemed, was after me as well.

Here I am, seated in front of my laptop, yet for two minutes he has been standing there without moving.

I am filled with dread right now. His piercing gaze is still fixed upon me.
