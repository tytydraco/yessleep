So, I work at Shopmore. I know, big deal, Shopmores are on practically every corner and tons of people work for them, why am I telling YOU this? Well because… *my* Shopmore is weird…

And I already hear you, ‘dude all Shopmores are weird, that’s why r/PeopleofShopmore exists’ but its weirder than *just* weird shoppers. It’s like the entire building is out of place… or maybe more out of shape? You know what, let me just start at when I was hired.

It was about 5 months ago, and the hiring process was a little unorthodox. I had walked into my local Shopmore and inquired at the service counter about any openings. I had figured I would just be told to apply online, or maybe be given a paper application (a relic these days), but to my surprise, the attendant said “Yes, we have openings. Please follow me.” and beckoned me behind the counter. This strikes me as odd, but Shopmore does have the reputation for hiring damn near *anyone.* Maybe that’s because they don’t bother with applications and skip straight to interviews, I think to myself, as I follow the attendant behind the counter.

We enter an ‘Employees Only’ door, and I’m led through an absolute maze of identical hallways, for what felt like 15 minutes. I’ve worked mall security before and not even all the utility hallways and access stairwells were this damn confusing. I’m pretty sure the hall even sloped down at one point, not sure if it ever sloped back up. I’m eventually led to a ‘Manager’s Office’ and presented to a stout balding man in maybe his mid-sixties.

“Huh…?” the man sighs, looking up from some papers on his desk. “Oh, you want a job? Alright, sit down.” I do and my interview begins.

Man: So, why do you want a job here?

Me: Well...um, I have prior customer service experience and am a real people-person, so I think my skills could really benef-

Man: No, what?! No, no, I don’t want to hear about any resume crap! I’m asking, why do you want a job *here*, at *Shopmore?* Place is a shithole.

Me: O-oh, really? I mean, it can’t be all bad. Shopmore is a worldwide brand, they’re everywhere.

Man: Know what else is everywhere? Rats...Death… MICROPLASTICS! Just cus it's everywhere, doesn’t mean it ain’t shit. But listen son, you don’t gotta impress me. If you want the job, it's yours, but I just want to make you understand what you’d be getting yourself into.

Me: What… what would I be getting into?

Man: This place… is Shopmore. ‘Where you can Shopmore, for LESS!’ Not a bad slogan, shit is dirt cheap here. But, someone foots the cost of savings, you understand? It might be me, or you, or any of the random shoppers, but someone always pays full price. Shit, I’m sorry, I’m getting cryptic as hell on ya. My point is, Shopmore ain’t normal, none of em, so you better be damn sure you really want this job, because quitting won’t be as easy as you think later.

Me: That’s certainly a lot to consider… uh, if you don’t mind me asking, what’s the starting wage?

Man: $35/hr plus benef-

Me: I’ll take the job!

And, that’s how I was hired at Shopmore. The man made me sign a couple papers, gave me an info packet, and told me to report back the next day for orientation. In the 5 or so months since then, I’ve never once seen the man or that office again.

I’ll wrap this up here since the buzzing fluorescents and horrendous yellow wallpaper of this breakroom are giving me a headache. But I’ll post again with more weird stuff that's actually happened on the job and, let me know, has anyone else experienced anything strange at Shopmore?
