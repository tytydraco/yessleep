Well, unfortunately, I have a bomb to drop on everyone, and it's a big one: 

The mechanic knows about this series. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

That's part of why it took me so long to update. As yinz could imagine, he did not react well. At all. Even though I kept his true name a secret as promised, I still shared his weaknesses. Anyone that found this and encountered him would be able to put two and two together as to who and what he is. 

Don't ask me why, but I truly had myself deluded into thinking that he wouldn't find out about this. He has eyes everywhere, especially on Orion. And on me. 

What isn't surprising, however, was that Briar was the one that found it. Fucker even did an AMA about it after the fact. 

Of course, when I stumbled across his post, I thought it was just someone trolling. Why wouldn't I? Anyone can pretend to be whatever and whoever they want on this website. That anonymity is why I felt safe enough to release the information that I do in the first place. 

What seemed to confirm that it wasn't just some Redditor screwing around was when Briar came by to give my plant-hand one last look before we got to experience the joy of Calan Mai. With how he is, one would expect him to gloat about finding my secret side hobby. Boy can't keep a secret to save his life. But the conniving little shit didn't say a word. 

That being said, he was behaving strangely, and for Briar, that's saying something. Those that met him can attest to that. But at the time, I'd chalked it up to anticipation for the upcoming ambush. For starters, he was quiet. Normally, he is seemingly incapable of shutting up. For another, his demeanor was strangely serious. 

“You're chatty today.” I remarked as he intently examined my false hand. 

The Huntsman's eyes raised from his work to narrow at me, though it appeared to be in curiosity rather than any sort of vindictiveness. “How does moving it feel?”

Apprehensively, I curled my fingers. By this point, my plant-hand had developed enough that it no longer felt like I was being skinned. My movements are sluggish and a bit weak, but it'll take time to regain the years of muscle memory that I lost. Even months won't be enough.

When I told all of the above to Briar, he confirmed that it was most likely going to be that way for a while due to the reason I just mentioned. He suggested basic hand exercises to build the muscles back up again, like stacking coins or pinching clothespins with each finger. 

Once that discussion was had, he told me, “Captain wants to see you tonight. There are a few things he wants to clear up before the big day.”

Fucker probably thought he was hilarious for that one. 

Naturally, I assumed Briar was referring to me being out of sword practice since my injury, so I thought nothing of it. I should also clarify that this all unfolded the night before Calan Mai. Him wanting to make sure I'd be up to snuff – especially since my last run-in with the Sentinels didn't go so well – just made sense. 

So, like a fool, I ventured out to the skull trees once the sun sank behind the horizon, absolutely none the wiser. As is typical, the mechanic was already there, chilling by a small fire, instrument in hand. 

The song the mechanic played was dreamy. Slow and mesmerizing. I'm fairly confident that anyone else that would've heard this song would've been enchanted. His face, however, didn't match the serenity of the tune he strummed. His eyes were narrowed as if in contemplation over something bothersome. 

Another thing that caught my notice was that a steel sword sat sheathed by his chair. Not the usual wooden training sword. 

*What’s that about?*

Without looking up from his fingers as they danced along the strings of his instrument, the first thing he said to me was, “What made ya pick that name?”

At first, I was confused. “What name? Ratcatcher?”

Then he smiled, finally meeting my face. “Iolo ap Huw?” 

*Fuck.*

Still grinning, he set his banjo aside, and continued, “I s'pose it's fittin’, given our similar histories and all. Was it just because we're both musicians? You know his story, right? Sure hope so; it's a fascinatin’ one!”

Mouth dry, and wondering how I was going to get out of this one, all I could think of to say was, “Not well.”

“He did join the Hunt,” The mechanic explained, his casual tone of voice not matching the fury I saw in his eyes. “All on his own, just like I did. The real Iolo was known to be a fiddle player, much like myself, but rather than takin’ up banjo after The White Son of Mist onboarded him, he went for the bugle. Lord only knows why. Even when played well, they sound like pissed off geese. But his questionable choices ain't the point o’ this story.”

He rose, picking up the unfamiliar sword, twirling it absentmindedly. Like Ratcatcher, the hilt was crafted from an antler, though it didn't appear to be from the white stag, given that it was an earthy shade of brown and gently curved. The guard appeared to be made from a large animal's jawbone; if I had to guess, I'd say it was from a bear. The weapon also boasted a beautifully molded pommel carved with an array of swirls. However, the most eye-catching thing about the weapon were the swirls in the short blade's metal. A hallmark of Damascus folded steel. 

Wait. How do I know that? Maybe he mentioned it once. 

The mechanic took his time as he strode towards me while that venomous smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. “See, his last words to the human world were always interestin’ to me.”

The mechanic recited them:

*‘To leave my dear girl, my country, and friends,
And roam o’er the ocean, where toil never ends;
To mount the high yards, when the whistle shall sound,
Amidst the wild winds as they bluster around!’*

Once he was done, he rooted me to the spot with a harsh glare. “Did you know all of that when you picked the name, Fiona?”

After spending countless evenings having to defend myself from him, I had a fairly good idea of when an attack was coming. I withdrew Ratcatcher, on high alert. 

“I haven't told a single soul your real name,” I informed him cautiously, not pointing the blade directly at him, but keeping it ready. “You're not being threatened in the slightest.”

His laugh held no humor or warmth as he started to subtly circle me. “Mercer County, Pennsylvania. Only mechanic in town. Just find the right village and it ain't too hard to piece together.”

“My intention wasn't to expose you.” I attempted to explain myself. “The entire purpose was to educate others who don't know how to treat the Neighbors of the Hills properly.”

That earned me a dismissive snort. “‘Banjo Bastard?’ You call *that* proper?”

My blade blocked his with a piercing *clang.* As he pushed in an attempt to disarm me, I moved with him, knowing that if I tried to go against him he would simply overpower me. After I managed to keep the blade in my hand, I stepped out of it, then retaliated with a slash towards his chest. The Huntsman deflected it without effort, then I had to fight to keep Ratcatcher in my hand once again.

The goal appeared to be to subdue me. Better than killing me, but I still didn't want to know what would happen once I was separated from the only thing that could protect me from him. 

While parrying another strike, I attempted to reason with him, “I know you're pissed, and- *oh shit!*”

The mechanic did that thing I hate where the moment I blink, he's somewhere else. I ducked, the steel blade whizzing mere inches away from my side. 

“Whatever coulda given you that impression?” he snapped. 

I spoke over the sound of our swords clashing again, “Look, you can kick my ass later-”

His grin wasn’t pleasant. “Why wait when I have you here right now?”

“Calan Mai-”

“I got half a mind to tell that witchdoctor that our deal is off,” he interrupted me far too calmly. “Let you take care of your own life debt right here and now.”

*I really did it this time.*

While I defended myself against another onslaught as best as I could, I kept trying. “*Hold on!*”

However, the mechanic wasn't inclined to do that. He wasn't up to his usual clownery, like tapping me on the shoulder or saying things just to rile me up. He watched every move I made with unblinking focus, moving far too fluidly for any measly human to keep up with. 

The sharp, steel blade sliced the top of my right arm, making me take a sharp, hissing breath through my teeth to keep from wincing. But I didn't have time to inspect the wound. The mechanic came damn near close to cutting my sternum. 

Once I parried another jab, I kicked him in the stomach in an effort to throw him off balance. When he took a single step back, eyes blazing like a bull about to charge. My blood turned to ice when I realized all that gesture served to do was enrage him more. 

And it did. He went after me with even more vigor than before and I quickly became overwhelmed. It doesn't matter how long or how hard I train; just by virtue of being human, I'm inherently at a disadvantage. One oxygen-depriving blow to the gut had me in the dirt, unable to move as the mechanic crouched next to me, the point of his sword prodding the hollow of my throat. 

It's times like that that make me acutely aware of the power imbalance between us. Even with knowing his true name, my continued survival is based on his perceptions of me. On whether or not I fall in line. 

In short, I'm only alive right now because the mechanic decided that he hadn't had enough of me yet. But I pushed him with this series. I really did. 

“Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just gut you right here,” he nearly growled. 

“Honestly,” my voice came out as a weak croak, followed by a painful cough. The mechanic glowered at me as he waited impatiently for me to catch my breath. “I don't have one.”

He rolled his eyes, his voice low with fury. “That *better* not be the end of your sentence.”

I shook my head as I took in a ragged inhale. Asshole checked his watch with a short *huff*, then went back to scowling at me. 

It was then that the answer to his question was, unfortunately, very clear: “Because if I die, you lose me for good.”

It was true. If anyone else had broken his trust like I had, he wouldn't have given them an opportunity to explain themselves. He would've just taken care of them. 

And both of us knew it. 

The mechanic shook his head again, his chuckle clipped with bitterness. “Jesus *fuckin’* Christ.”

The blade at my throat was removed as he straightened back up, sheathing it before running a hand through his hair. Apprehensively, I sat up, watching him. His glare was now directed at the ground, as if he was having trouble processing what was happening and somehow, it was the Earth’s fault. 

By and large, he was a lot more docile after the swordfight. Probably just had to get it out of his system. It doesn’t make attacking me right, granted, but it makes sense. 

“I really didn't mean to draw any attention towards you,” I told him honestly. “I respect the agreement we made to keep your name a secret.”

It was the truth. I'd never had any intentions of anything I report about getting back to anyone in our operating area, the Neighbors especially. 

“You still shoulda known better,” he pointed out as his icy gaze met mine once again. “Tellin’ folks to leave out some cream for their resident Housekeeper is one thing. It's a whole other matter altogether when you start givin’ away secrets that ain't yours. I got a business to run, you know. Hell, so does ol' blue eyes. But I imagine it would be decent advertisin' for him, even if you've outed him as a draugr.”

For the record, the boss hasn't expressed any qualms about me discussing his condition. If anything, it helps to demonstrate that the undead aren't the mindless, ravenous monsters described by numerous outdated records. 

“Not necessarily,” I joked, still uneasy after having only my skin to separate his blade from my jugular. “I don't hide the fact that he's the ringleader in a sea of clowns.” 

That didn't even get a smile out of him. “You're lucky I got some ridiculous hang-up about you. You know that, right?”

I knew. It appeared that neither of us wanted it, but it was there. We were connected, somehow. Not by love – at least not on my end – but by some strange, unhealthy reliance on one another. Maybe it's like he told Deirdre once before: by naming him, I'd unintentionally bound him to me. 

There are many times I wonder if he's right. About how taking his name somehow led to feelings he misconstrues as affection. He certainly doesn't act like someone who's been enamored. If anything, his behavior seemed more akin to someone who was trapped. 

The mechanic implied to Deirdre once before that he believed that finding my name would break the connection. I'll admit that there's been a small part of me that's been tempted to give it to him. Just to end the cycle we're in. But that was too much of a risk. For one, there was no guarantee that it would work. And if I ended up losing that particular, high-stakes gamble, he'd have far too much power over me. Even more than he does now. 

Then there was also the knowledge that his attachment was the only thing keeping things from going back to the way they were before. I'd be right back to him actively hunting me. 

So we're stuck here. At least, I thought we were. Not so much, now. 

With the way his brows were knotted together, it appeared as if he was deliberating something. At the time, I wasn't sure what. 

“That shit you're writing,” he eventually said. “Got an ending for it?”

Sliding my legs closer so that I could wrap my arms around them, I replied. “No. But given… recent events, it may have to happen sooner rather than later.”

Gruffly, he confirmed, “Yeah, you best do that.”

“I just need one more–” At his annoyed sigh, I waited for him to stop being ornery before I explained, “Provided that we both survive Calan Mai, I would like to put out one last update just so that no one wonders what happened to me. If I suddenly go radio silent, it'll look like something happened. That'll draw even more attention towards you.”

The glare I received could've melted steel beams. That's how I knew that he agreed with me. He hated doing that more than anything, especially when it came to something that didn't suit him. 

I know I've said it before, but I'll say it again: it makes me deeply uncomfortable to acknowledge just how well I know the mechanic.

“Well, let's hope we both survive then,” he then added with a cheeky smile. “Wouldn't want the… what'd you call ‘em again? The horny jail?” 

For a moment, what he said didn't truly hit me. Then the pieces clicked together. *Oh dear God.*

At my expression, he began to laugh. “Yeah, that's what you call ‘em, alright! As I was sayin’, you wouldn't want ‘em riotin’ now, would ya?”

Too late. I can hear them clawing at their screens now that senpai has noticed them. 

As I painfully got to my feet, I grumbled, “What would it take for this conversation to end?” 

He nodded towards Ratcatcher, still looking entirely too pleased with my reaction to his acknowledgement of The Inmates. “Let's start by gettin' that rust off. It's been a while since we sparred and it shows.”

Regrettably, I had to agree with him. Even though I could tell he was going easy on me, I still felt like I was moving even slower than ever. 

As terrible as being told to halt this series is, it was honestly for the better that I went to this session, considering the shitshow that awaited us all the following day.  

When it comes to this series, I'm sure some of yinz are hoping that I found some way to convince him to allow me to keep up communication with all of you. He hasn't budged. Because of that, I regret to inform you all **that this is it.** It's either I keep my word and end things here, or I risk some form of retaliation. Maybe not against me necessarily, but against Reyna. I hope you all understand. 

Now that the band-aid has been ripped off, allow me to fill in some blanks. We'll start with the least stressful thing first: the house. 

The Redjacket mostly keeps to himself, preferring to accept our bowls of cream and slices of friendship bread when we aren’t around. However, he can be a bit of a territorial sonuvabitch about the basement, which makes doing laundry an interesting experience. 

Deirdre has finally accepted that washing machines are good things after spending so long being insistent that they're ‘useless contraptions.’ She is finally moving into the 21st century. Reyna and I were so proud that we made her a cake to celebrate. 

Anyways, she had been carrying a hamper down to the basement when she had the sense that she was unwelcome. For context, the Redjacket had already received his daily offering, which is what made this event surprising. The moment the sensation came over her, she stopped where she was and set the basket on the top step to locate the loaf of fruity Amish bread. 

Once she had what she needed, she called down, “My intention is not to disturb you. I merely have some clothes that I need washed. Is now an inopportune time?”

The lights flickered. A growl rose up the stairs. At the time, Reyna and I had been fussing with the cake, trying to put the leftovers away without ruining the frosting (we failed). But once the Redjacket made his agitation known, she and I both froze. Reyna even dropped the spatula she'd been holding. 

Deirdre's pale brows drew together as she *scolded* the Redjacket, “Now, there is no need for that!”

The lights flashed again. The growl began to morph into a child's enraged scream. While I couldn't understand what he was saying, he sounded *peeved.*  

“Alright, *gasún,*” Deirdre placed her hands on her hips sternly, which is a pose I'd seen my own mother adopt more times than I care to admit. “You're a bit young to be using language like that, I reckon! If you want your privacy, you need only say so. There is no reason for you to behave like this!”

I jumped when one of the windows flew open, causing the wind to howl. Reyna gasped, eyeballing the salt sitting on the kitchen counter. 

However, before either of us could seize it, Deirdre's strict shout stopped me in my tracks. “Oh, you stop that *right now!*”

The only other time that I'd heard her sound like that was when she was in the hospital, scolding me for playing the self-blame game. This matronly demeanor gave her ordinarily soft, lovely voice a sharp, biting edge that instantly demanded obedience. 

And even though no one asked, I have to admit that there is a part of me that kind of likes it. 

Instantly, the windows slammed shut. Likewise, the lights ceased their strobing. The air became heavy with tension as the basement fell silent. 

Just like that, Deirdre's familiar gentle tone returned, “May I come downstairs? I just want to check on you.”

From the basement came a soft sniffle that made my heart break. Judging by the way Reyna gaped with her hand over her chest, we were in the same boat. 

Frowning, Deirdre wordlessly exchanged the friendship bread for one of the slices of cake, then started down the stairs with a sigh, “I don't like yelling at you anymore than you like being yelled at. But you can hurt people when you behave like that. You don't want to hurt people, do you?”

Once she'd disappeared below, their conversation became muffled. She did tell me later that the Redjacket’s answer to her question was ‘no.’ 

At the end of the day, he truly is a child, albeit an atypical one. Long story short, the three of us looked into parenting guides in an effort to better understand how to accommodate our Redjacket. 

Whatever we're doing, it must be working. Because not only have we had fewer tantrums like the one described, but the little shit saved our lives on Calan Mai. 

In the middle of the night, the house shook from the force of our Redjacket's shrieks. *What the hell?* As I glanced around in a half-conscious effort to figure out what was going on, Deirdre jolted awake with a small exclamation of fright, then scooted closer to me. Without thinking, I put my arm around her to remind her that she was protected. Since she can't seem to protect herself. 

A soft creak on the floor in the hallway. So small I nearly missed it. Deirdre shuddered in my embrace as she came to the same conclusion that I did: **someone or something was in the house.**

Something I want to be clear on is that we're obnoxiously diligent about salting every potential entrance, just as we were back at the apartment. That meant that the intruder was either human or another being that salt couldn't repel. 

Carefully, I crept out of bed to where Ratcatcher rested on top of the dresser. Without making a sound, I unsheathed it, then padded close to the bedroom door, ready to behead anything that came through. The entire time, Deirdre watched with wide eyes, swallowing as she slowly rose to her knees on the mattress. 

The doorknob slowly turned. I gripped the sword tighter in preparation to see who was behind it. It could've been Reyna. 

It wasn't. Deirdre's reaction told me that before our intruder stepped through the doorway. Her breath became shaky with terror. 

Without any further hesitation, I brought the blade down with all the force I was capable of. Ratcatcher’s blade slid into our unwelcome visitor's shoulder. When withdrawing, I had to take care not to get it stuck as I felt something scrape against the sword, suctioning as if trying to swallow it. Last thing we need is to have to fix that blade again. 

However, the intruder didn't make a sound. He just fell, rolling onto his back. While the lights flashed and the Redjacket continued to cry out, I saw our guest's face. It took a moment for me to place where I'd seen him before. 

The security guard we met at Gwythyr's fortress. 

Footsteps that I recognized as Reyna's pounded from the hallway; her flashlight indicated her progress as she raced towards us. Meanwhile, our intruder had begun to convulse, his eyes rolling back into his head as he reached for his doughy face, just as devoid of emotion as he had been the last time I'd seen him. His fingernails began to rake at his skin, his flesh reddening until he drew blood. Deirdre whimpered at this sight, getting to her feet. Clumps of flesh peeled away from his muscles like wet ribbons. 

The lights came on briefly. Not muscle. It wasn't striated, and it was far too dark. Smooth. 

“Get back!” I shouted, my sentence punctuated by the nauseating sound of crunching bones. 

In the beam of Reyna's flashlight, I could see that a scythe-shaped appendage had sprung from the guard's skull. She shrieked, the light jumping in her fear. 

The security guard's torso seemed to unzip after that as the thing that was wearing him emerged, then shook itself off like a dog. Chunks of gore were flung onto the walls and carpet. 

“Keep the light on it!” I told her.

However, the Redjacket must've heard me because the lighting in the bedroom became stable afterwards, giving me a perfect view of the hell ant charging towards me. 

*Payback time, you bitch.*

I positioned Ratcatcher to block its jaws as they snapped towards me. Teeth clenched, I then kicked the terrible thing in the side, causing it to stagger. After last time, I learned my lesson, retreating so that I could remain out of its reach. 

During all of this, poor Deirdre was stuck on the bed, trying to stay as far away from the ant as possible, but unable to leave the room. The hell ant was blocking her exit. Reyna said something before running off, but while I was focused on the ant, I didn't hear what it was. Sure enough, the terrible thing's head flicked towards me, its jaws clicking as if in anger. 

When it lunged for me again, I made myself be patient and used its momentum against it, directing it to run into the wall. I stepped around another snap of jaws, then drove Ratcatcher down over its neck. The blade only made it partway through, not fully decapitating the ant. A shrill, grating sound came from its mouth in an approximation of a scream. 

I knew it was going to try to bite me again. That seemed to be their main strategy: lure you close by looking slower or more hurt than they actually are, then *snap!* Sure as shit, it followed that pattern, its scythe-like mouth whizzing through the air beside me, its aim thrown off by its injury. Thick, dark liquid poured from its neck. Not quite blood. Not as I understand it, anyway. It looked and smelled more comparable to hot tar. 

Another slice. Same spot. The ant's head still didn't come off. It hung on by a literal thread. The hell ant's body hit the ground roughly as it stumbled in its own fluids, legs bending and straightening seemingly involuntarily. One more cut took care of it. Should've just been one. 

A scream from down the hall. I leapt over the hell ant's unmoving body just as a gunshot rang out, making me flinch. My ears rang afterwards, so much so that I didn't realize that Deirdre had followed me out until she suddenly appeared by my side. 

Reyna was sprawled on the floor, hyperventilating, my shotgun in her hands as she trembled. Some of that black, tar-like substance was splattered on her. She'd dropped the gun, wiping at it as she cried out again. In her panic, the only word I could make out was ‘burning.’ Deirdre seized her shoulders, guiding her back down the hall towards the bathroom, then shortly thereafter, I heard the water running. 

Our front door was wide open, completely undamaged. The one wearing the security guard must've picked it so that we wouldn't hear them breaking in. I swallowed as it hit me that if it hadn't been for the Redjacket, the Sentinels might've slaughtered us in our beds. 

Reyna had managed to shoot this hell ant in the face, leaving it with only its upper jaw. Judging by how little of the head was left, it had gotten pretty close to her. It laid there, unmoving. 

Keeping my gaze fixed on the door, I located Reyna's phone on the counter.  Midnight. They hadn't wasted any time when it came to Calan Mai being *the* day to wreck everyone's shit. She and I know each other's passwords in case of incidents like this, so once I got it unlocked, I found Victor's number. And in case anyone was wondering, she has it stored with only a zombie emoji. 

It took a moment for him to answer, but when he did, his voice was strained. “They came for you, too, I take it?”

“Yeah.” I replied, waiting for another hell ant to appear. It was only a matter of time. 

“Everyone alright?”

“Our witchdoctor got some blood on her,” I told him, afraid that something could be listening that would take her name. “I think it's acidic, so look out. My beloved is taking care of her.”

He told me that he was going to get a hold of Wes then head over. From the sounds of things, Gwythyr's hell ants had been tipped off about Wes having *Gae Assail,* and as per usual, the vampire was drawing most of the attention towards himself. He sure is lucky that he's a walking Nokia. 

Midway through the conversation, a silhouette appeared in the doorway. Not an ant. The shadow was familiar. At first I thought it was the mechanic, given the dragonfly-shaped wings, but then it stepped into the flashing light. Rather than purple, this Neighbor's chitin reflected a deep blue, reminding me of cobalt. The mouth wasn't fixed into a permanent, toothy smile, but instead, a neutral, lipless grimace. Rather than crownlike spikes, this one's horns curled like that of a ram. 

Apparently, the Huntsman y’all know as Iolo wasn't the only defector. But this one chose the wrong side.

The former Caer Sidi guard held a sword in each hand, raising them both into an X shape. Then it disappeared in the blink of an eye. A trick I've experienced countless times. However, I had two swords to watch out for this time. I blocked one, then sidestepped as the other was thrust towards my midsection. I pirouetted away in time to parry another overhead strike, then had to dance away again. 

The guard said something in Welsh that isn't worth repeating. Its voice came out oddly mechanical, clicking and metallic like an old music box. Because of this quality, it was hard to determine its demeanor. 

I didn't even bother trying to attack the guard. Like the mechanic, it was too fast. All I could do was defend myself. Within a few minutes, I was panting as sweat soaked my spine. It was tiring me out fast. 

Water hit my shoulder, then the guard let out a reptilian hiss, its eyeless head twisting to snarl at the hallway behind me. The goofy squeaks of the Squelcher's trigger being pulled told me all that I needed to know about what had pissed it off. 

Unfortunately, the angrier it got, the faster it moved. Its blades crossed together, aiming to open up my throat. I ducked, but didn't have any time to retaliate or even turn before one of its blades grazed my back. I heard Deirdre's voice over the pounding in my ears, but couldn't understand what she said. 

After I fell to the ground, clinging onto Ratcatcher for dear life, I rolled with my arm outstretched. Both of the guard's blades battered against my block with enough force to make my teeth rattle. It pushed me, my own blade moving closer to my throat. Its intentions became clear: it wanted to kill me with my own sword. Possibly as penance for standing against it. 

More growled Welsh as it promised to make my death worthy of remembering. It ignored the saltwater eating away at its chitin, focused entirely on me. 

Orange light reflected off of its metallic exterior, growing bright. Its head rose towards the doorway, then its weight against Ratcatcher disappeared as the guard flew backwards. 

With a grunt, I struggled to my feet, then glanced back to see a pair of eyes shimmering in the darkness outside. 

From those glowing eyes came Wes’ voice: “The spear works!”

The guard let out another hiss, though with the spear buried in its midsection, it came out wet. More of a gurgle. It was pulling at the spear, trying to break the handle off. The smell of cooking meat became more and more potent the longer the spear stayed embedded in the guard's torso. My stomach churned at the idea that *Gae Assail* was cooking it from the inside out. 

“One Dragonfly down,” Wes muttered. “Just one more to go.”

Losing twice wasn't enough. Maybe third time'll be the charm. 

Victor, passing by us both to check on Reyna and Deirdre, sharply reprimanded him. “Not the time!”

“Just kidding,” the vampire replied, then added with a small smile. “Mostly.”

Keep talking, Wes. Keep talking. 

The hell ant's blood had caused minor chemical burns on Reyna's skin, leaving it blistered and darkened on her chest and neck. In her haste to help get it off of Reyna, Deirdre had burnt her hands as well. She'd had to corral Reyna into the shower, then delicately peel her shirt off. She now wore a different one, cringing every time the fabric moved against her raw skin. 

Afterwards, we'd found that our upstairs carpet was completely destroyed. The hell ant's blood had eaten all the way through it. Welp. There goes our security deposit. 

The first thing we did was barricade the front door. Since that embarrassment of a Caer Sidi guard had appeared, there was a lull. Those that sent it most likely assumed that it had taken care of us. However, the moment of calm would go away the moment they realized that the guard had failed. 

The next order of business was an inventory check. While Victor went over supplies, Deirdre checked my back. It stung like a motherfucker, and would probably need stitches, but I'd just have to make do with butterfly tape for now. 

We had a few rounds of both regular and salt shells. The salt ones could be useful if they sent something other than the hell ants again. I hoped not; the Sentinels were bad enough, and I had no desire to contend with anything like that guard again. Speaking of, the smell of burning Caer Sidi guard grew to be unbearable, which resorted in Wes submerging the spear’s tip in our kitchen sink after filling the basin with water. 

While we were waiting with bated breath for another wave of homicidal bullshit, Victor got a call from Briar. I was pleased to hear that the Hunt was giving the grief right back to those loyal to Gwythyr. The thorny bitch boasted that our region of Pennsylvania was about to witness an unprecedented spike in short-eared owl, shrew, great egret, flying squirrel, bobcat, and yes, blackpoll warbler populations. 

Near the end of the call, Victor beamed as he shook his head. I couldn't hear what Briar said, but it was probably slutty considering that the boss replied, “On that note, I'm hanging up now.”

Despite being injured and anxiously awaiting another fight for my life, that didn't stop me from looking over at Reyna and saying in an exaggerated, mushy voice, “No, *you* hang up, pookie!”

Reyna snapped out of the stunned stupor she'd been in. A small smile grew across her face as she joined in on my idiocy, “No, *you,* my little hunty poo!”

Victor's bemused expression slipped away as he fixed the two of us with a withering stare. Deirdre paused in her nursing to clap a hand over her mouth to hide her giggles. 

With a sigh that seemed to come from deep within his soul, he then asked Briar, “Want to turn my coworkers into geese?”

At the same time, she and I stammered:

*“No no no no no!”*

“Wait! *Wait!* He'll actually do it!”

The boss cut our protests off as he slid his phone into his pocket. “Relax, he already hung up.”

It's times like that that make me realize he and Briar are an even better match than I anticipated. Deirdre didn't bother hiding her laughter once Victor turned the tables on us. Wes, still babysitting *Gae Assail* at the sink, just watched all of this with a smirk. 

Our brief moment of levity was interrupted by a small, infantile voice. “It's not safe yet.”

The room fell silent as we all saw the Redjacket's small head poking out from the basement. The poor little guy shyly jumped back. 

Instantly, Deirdre went to our atypical roommate, cooing, “It's alright, *gasún.* They’ve come to help protect your home.” 

The Redjacket asked the question I'd learned the answer to earlier. “*Gasún.* What does that mean?”

“Where I come from, it's a term of affection for… spirited children,” she explained, kneeling so that she'd be close to eye level. “Particularly boys.”

“I think I was a boy,” the Redjacket said thoughtfully. 

“Does it bother you that I call you that?”

“Not at all.”

Henceforth, I will refer to our Redjacket as Gasún. I know some of y'all may be alarmed by the fact that we've nicknamed the little lad, but Redjackets play by different rules than Housekeepers. Many have gone by pseudonyms, including one noted by Martin Luther that went by the name Hinzelmann. Generally speaking, as long as the alias is respectful, the Redjacket won't mind. Besides, the little guy said himself that he doesn't mind. 

“I never much cared for the Son of Scorcher,” Gasún informed us once he'd gotten comfortable enough to leave the basement, though he stayed by the door, ready to run back in at a moment's notice. “He only sees what he wants. And what he wants, he takes.”

Once again, I have to wonder about Creiddylad. Did she want him? *Either* of them? 

“We won't let him take this place,” Victor assured him, though he was glancing at all of us. “Even if another Discount Dragonfly appears, we're ready. If we can survive the Wild Hunt, we can survive this.”

Reyna finally piped up, “You know… If Orion had a nickel for every time a god tried to smite us, we'd have two nickels. Which isn't much, but I *really* wish it would stop!”

The clock read four in the morning. 

I asked Victor, “Did Briar mention anything about how long this might last?”

He sighed, “Ordinarily, all their fighting begins at noon, so this is a new thing for everybody. But he did tell me that hawthorns are especially powerful on this day. Might be a place to get refuge. Unless you don't want your safety deposit back.”

“Oh, that ship already sailed and is currently chilling next to the Titanic. But given what we've already dealt with tonight, I'm down for some refuge.”

Deirdre's brows furrowed. “And leave Gasún?” 

“They don't want me,” Gasún said. “I'll be fine. Please, go. I don't want my house destroyed.”

Fair enough. Neither did we. 

Upon exploring the basement, we discovered that there was a dirty plastic bucket that we could use to transport *Gae Assail.* Good enough. Once it was filled with enough water to keep the spear from bursting into flames again, we were as ready as we could be. 

Victor left first, looking around to see if anything was waiting for us. Once he determined that the coast was clear, he waved us all over. We split off into two groups: Wes joined me in the Jeep so that he'd have enough room for *Gae Assail,* along with Deirdre, while Reyna went with the boss. 

While on the road, a murder of crows soared over the Jeep's roof. As the misshapen souls passed, shrieks could be heard. They were carrying something. Something *big.* Something that kicked wildly at the Jeep's roof as if scrambling for purchase. Deirdre shuddered, sinking into her seat. 

The Hunt let the *sluagh* have their fun, too, that night. 

That incident aside, both parties made it to the Lover's Tree unscathed. Just like the day it earned its nickname, the tree was in full bloom, sporting plumes of white flowers, standing beautifully against the glimmer of the clear night sky. 

For the first time, the crows resting in the hawthorn's branches didn't pay us any mind. They'd known what was coming. They chattered amongst themselves as if we weren't there. 

Wes suggested that Reyna, Deirdre, and I try to get some rest while he and Victor kept watch. By that point, my adrenaline had worn off. After all the fighting, I crashed, even though I hadn't meant to. It was like I blinked, then suddenly, it was morning.

And not only that, a banjo was playing. *You Are My Sunshine.* Gene Autry said it best: if you leave me to love another, you'll regret it all someday. 

“Sleep well?” He asked, far too awake and cheerful.

“No,” I croaked, beginning to sit up. 

Deirdre didn't stir from beside me. Why was no one else awake? Why was it just me?

*They must not care as much as they say they do. Leaving you alone like that.* 

“Shame,” he remarked, his grin making me nervous. Then he made my heart stop. “It's nice to finally meet you.”

He then happily told me my full name. 

All fairytales have a moral, don't they? Some shit they tell little ones to keep ‘em from wandering where they don't belong?
