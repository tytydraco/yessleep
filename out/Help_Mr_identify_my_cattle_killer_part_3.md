Hi everyone, I'm back again though I doubt I want to be back. I've seen things today that, well I don't know how to really process it all and I'm hoping that you guys reading this might give me some insight or maybe a diagnosis since I feel I've gone crazy.

To begin I want to say that last night the sound I had heard was just the scrambling of a coyote. A pack of them seemed to have descended on my bunk house's garbage. Gave me quiet the spook if I'm being honest hahaha. But after that incident I went back to sleep and woke up bright and early so I could help the police. For most of today I've been touring the property with them. Showing them everything and giving my retelling of events. I even showed them my reddit posts to help paint a picture that my verbal words weren't doing the best job of. (it was at this time that I had explained the modern slang of Cattle Rustler and Cow Puncher.)

After they read through it, they gave me a look. A look that said more than they could ever. They thought me crazy. They think I'm seeing stuff. One of them even asked if I was taking anything, medications or otherwise. Of course I told him that I occasionally drink and smoke cigarettes but I'm not on anything and don't plan on doing anything like that for a while. They didn't seem to buy into my words. Didn't matter. I showed them everything from my abandoned campsite to my missing horse, the field of cattle bones and the bloodied big house. Fortunately, the cops seemed to understand now that it couldn't have been me, that no man could ever do something like this.

We wrapped things up, the cops left dumbfounded while I was more worried about the approaching night. I feared because I knew that that thing was still out there, still lurking. It had run off before getting the chance to take me out and I felt that it had a vendetta for me, felt as though a dozen eyes were watching me anytime I turned my back in any direction. Eventually the cops climbed into their cruiser and waited for me to get into my truck, they were waiting for me to leave first. Instead what happened was a blur for me but I'm sure for those officers it was something else.

I remember opening my truck door, I remember seeing my bench seating, my steering wheel, an empty can of root beer. Then I turned, seeing my side mirror, seeing horror on the officer's faces as the monster, that beast with no name came back. I don't know what happened to the cops. I don't even know what happened to me even. All I know is it felt a strike, a punch that had no weight. I felt myself falling, thrusted into the ground while my eyes saw dreams.

I saw many hallucinations (best way to describe them in my opinion, far better than dream). I remember seeing myself, out of body, looking at my own shoulder as I walked through a never ending desert. I remember stepping on a cactus spine. I looked down at my heel to find a small face glaring right back at me, a face I have never seen. I remember hearing it talk to me but the words were so far off. I tried to remove the face from my foot. I tried to kick it off, tried to slam it against a nearby boulder, tried to thrust it into more cactus spines.

The face at the bottom of my foot instead sank into my skin and slithered like a snake up along my body. It traveled over my legs and pelvis, up my stomach and chest, sitting on my shoulder where it decided to sprout like a proud flower in spring. I was two headed or at least this version I was looking upon was now two headed, my face meeting this visitor's face, fighting, battling, tumbling down into the sand which consumed us, swallowing us to black.

My eyes opened up and I was back in my body, the second face gone and instead magnified. It was before me, resting at the size of a mountain. The skin shined brightly because it was made of decadent silver. Its closed eyes fighting back tears of gold which shimmered as it cascaded down the cliff side of a cheek. Its low gutteral weeps shook the land and myself as the lips unfurled, opening up to reveal a wave of blood. I ran and was rewarded in the same manner as if I would have stayed still. Engulfed in a sea of blood, taken far far off.

I awoke once more. Finding myself in a cavern of some kind. My body burns as if bathed in acid. The light was non existent, it was black and desolate but a roaring inferno approached. Illumination brought to me as if Prometheus was my waiter, serving me fire on a silver platter. I saw a ceremony. They bowed before a crucifix, a wall of misshapen crosses. They pleaded to it as if the retribution for not doing so would be ever so bitter. They cried and cried but were not saved. The monster that I don't have a name for appeared, same as I saw it, the same in those fractions of seconds. It massacred them.

Finally I woke up, for real. I was back home, the day break shining on my face, painting my features. I went for my phone, I was going to write this all out and mabe call someone to help. But I've a newer concern. My body still burns and now it bears the brands I saw on George. I'm littered in those misshapen crucifixes and I think (not sure yet) I hear something whispering to me. Someone help me. Tell me I'm crazy. Please give me a logical reason. Tell me I've just lost it. Please!
