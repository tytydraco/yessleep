Hello, my name is Jack and I am eighteen years old. I would like to recount a personal story that scarred me mentally, for life.

I was sixteen years old, and it was the day before school shut down for winter break. Naturally, everyone was very excited, so the mood was great that day.

Despite that, the weather was awful. It was extremely cold, windy. Dark clouds shrouded the sun and killed off any hope for warmth. Nevertheless, I was dressed nicely, with my black overcoat, jeans, a nice pullover and my boots. Nothing could pierce my personal little shield of cosiness.

It was the last period when it got much darker than before, and the blizzard which we expected to begin at noon, had already started. I felt it was very atmospheric, but all that was ruined by the head teacher's booming voice sounding all throughout the school's intercoms.

“Due to hazardous weather conditions, no student will be leaving the school zone before the blizzard has stopped.”

My friend Andrew and I sighed with disappointment, thinking how our last day there would be far longer. Not everyone reacted so calmly, however. Crying, yelling and annoying complaints ensued, until Mr. Conroy told us to keep quiet.

Andy gestured over to me, telling me to just shit against the wall and wait calmly. I took my overcoat and used it as a blanket, putting it on my back. We started a discussion about Star Wars, something about how underappreciated Darth Maul was. We agreed that he played a massive part in Obi-Wan’s character development. We stayed silent for a few hours, just staring at the darkness outside, which was surprisingly even worse now.

A few hours later, at 19:07 according to my hand watch, Mr. Conroy looked at his phone, went out into the hallways, and surprisingly locked the door behind him. We were taken aback by his odd behaviour but did not think much of it, up until he was gone for a full half an hour. We were concerned, and a boy even started weeping. Andy said it was probably nothing, and that Mr. Conroy just took a smoke break. Everyone began laughing at his joke.

The laughter was interrupted by two, very clear screams. It was not a funny scream, it was a blood curdling yell for help.

“What the FUCK was that?”

A girl asked, concerned and maybe even scared.

“That didn’t sound too go-”

I started saying, only to get cut off by an animalistic growl. We all stared out into the hallways, through the thin window of the door. We heard more yelling. More screaming. The lights outside got turned off, and we heard footsteps outside. Someone was running. Not just a single person. A lot of them. Yelling, growling, shouting for help. The roaring slowly drowned out all screams.

20:34. The sounds had stopped, the lights were out all throughout the school. The school yard was illuminated by a few street lamps, very poorly too.

20:38, Sam, a girl who felt daring, went closer towards the classroom door. She jiggled the handle to no avail. Clicking and tapping came from outside, more footsteps, which were now quieter, but the sheer number of them made them deafening amidst the silence of the school.

20:41, a massive bang against the door made us all panic. And another. And then another. The glass from the window shattered and fell onto the floor. I reflexively put on my overcoat and got under a desk, near the corner of the room, along with Andy. Five seconds later, the door broke down completely. Dozens of students ran in, but something was wrong.

They were attacking my classmates.

They were screaming like lunatics, hitting, scratching and biting everyone. I managed to crawl outside, with Andy being right behind me. We ran downstairs, to the second floor. We saw more of them. They screamed at us and rat towards us, maniacally swinging their arms. They all smelled like corpses, decaying corpses.

As fast as we could, we got into an unlocked classroom and hid under the teacher's desk. 20:51, the things outside were banging on the door, shattering the glass and jumping in, with some getting trampled by the rest. Panicking, Andy jumped up, over the desk and towards the large windows which lead outside. He got tackled by one of them, both falling through the windows and out into the cold snow. The creatures followed shortly after, a massive suicide drop from what I could assume. I was weeping and the hot tears froze on my face, almost instantly. I was completely distressed. I absentmindedly walked outside, down the stairwell and into the ground floor. I didn't come across any of them, strangely.

As I stared outside, into the darkness, only contrasted by the blanket of snow covering the ground, I felt completely empty and blank. I took a few deep breaths, my hands were trembling and my feet were numb. I wore my gloves. A roar came from upstairs, echoing through the hallways. I closed my eyes and started sprinting. I went through the doorway, out into the snow. I slipped a few times, kicking the snow. I was getting hunted down by my classmates. I looked back and saw them biting down on Andy. My friend. My OWN DAMN FRIEND was being eaten by insane people.

I climbed over the school fence, kicking a girl who tried biting me in the face. I started running as fast as I could, completely terrified. My body was burning up. I ran as fast as I could. There's nothing I wanted more than to get home.

At 21:42, I saw the lights of my house in the distance. How long was I running around in the tiny rural town? I'll never know. My eyes weren't blinking. I was horrified. I reached into my pocket, and with trembling hands took my keys out of my pocket. I unlocked the door and got inside.

My father, having heard the noise, came to check what it was. When he saw me he was taken aback.

“Jack? How'd you come here? It's freezing. Didn't they say we'd come to pick you up tomorrow?”

“I’m cold.”

I just went to my bedroom. I took off my coat, my boots. I collapsed onto my bed, looking up to the picture of Jesus above me. I got up, took some warm clothes and went into the bathroom. I took a hot bath, and took notice of my ankle. It was inflamed, red. I must've sprained it during one of my slips. I got finished, dressed, and with a towel on my pillow, I laid down. I didn't sleep. How could I? I was still trembling. Not from the cold, not anymore. I was trembling from sheer terror, fear and perhaps even pain. I was bruised, my ankle was completely fucked, my ears were ringing and my head hurt like hell. I cried. I'm not ashamed of it. I cried for three hours, maybe more. I couldn't stop. I was incapacitated.

At some point I must've fallen asleep. I woke up at 09:58, I was met with the same darkness from yesterday, the blizzard had no end. No mercy. I limped my way downstairs, and saw a note from my parents. They had gone to the city, for groceries. I just collapsed on the couch. I felt numb.

It's been two years since then. Today is the anniversary of the pain I endured. I don't know what happened that day. What caused my classmates to become cannibalistic monsters. I've never heard of any of them since, I'm the only person below the age of twenty remaining in the area. Most people moved out of town after their children were found eviscerated, mutilated and horrifically murdered by creatures, cruel beyond any human capacity. The creatures themselves, my ex classmates included, were found on the scene, in an extremely advanced state of decay.

I fear it will happen again. Maybe not here, maybe not now. But it may happen again. I fear the snowstorms. I fear the darkness and I fear that one of them may still be alive. And that it just might come back to kill the remaining survivor.

To kill me.
