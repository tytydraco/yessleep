(The horror aspect is not in this part, just adding some detail)

[7:20pm]

I am 15 and I have two younger brothers, 9 and 4. Our parents have just left to meet some friends, and shouldn't be back until morning, looks like a night with just the three of us. I'm glad that I can have the night without any parents or chores.

(15 minutes ago)

'Jasmine, make sure to give your brothers dinner, give them some entertainment and bedtime, 8pm sharp.' Mum explains.

'I know.'

'And don't feed them any sugary treats, otherwise they'll be awake for hours'

I don't think that is tru-'

'And lock the doors and windows. Call me if anything goes wrong.'

'Fine.'

As they left, I immediately walked up back to my room, I wanted to watch something on my laptop. I wasn't worried about my brothers, they get sunk into the TV with those kids cartoons. 

[7:50pm]

I'm watching Netflix, on my bed and eating popcorn. I was so focused onto the horror movie that I didn't see my door open. As I see something move out of my focus, I jumped up. It was my brothers.

'Jasmine, we are hungry, can we have dinner?'

I forgot about that. 'Shit! Sorry guys. I'll make it in a minute.'

Mum left some pizza in the fridge for dinner.

'But we want it now!'

'Ok ok fine.'

I make my way into our kitchen and scanned the fridge. At the top, 1 meatlovers pizza. I read the instructions, *200Â°C for 20 minutes*

I prepare the food and place it into the oven, set the timer for 20 minutes and walk back up into my room.

[8:20pm]

*ding*

It has been a while since the oven had finished. The pizza should cool down.

I tread back to the oven in the kitchen and examine the pizza. Cooked well and warm. I cut it into 6 slices and give them a slice each. 

'Thanks Jasmine!'

'It's fine.'

I take a 3rd slice if pizza for myself and head back into my room, eager to watch my movie with a snack. I peek over into the living room and see my brothers watching a show I've never seen before, there were children dancing and singing, creepily.

I don't get how that is a 'cartoon'. 

[9:40pm]

My movie is over, and I head back into the kitchen for a snack and to put away the leftover pizza. I glanced at the living room couch and see both my brothers on the couch. As I got my water, I walked over into the living room and told them that its bedtime.

'Ok,  Jake and Jason, it is bedtime.'

'But I wanna watch the tv!'

It was the same singing children from earlier.

'How are they still showing cartoons this late? Come on, if you're all tired the next morning, Mum will blame me.'

'Ok..'

Finally. They walk up to their shared room with their heads down low. I do feel bad but I don't want to deal with Mum tomorrow.

I flick the TV off, and turn the kitchen light off, walking back up into my room in darkness.

'I thought I turned the TV off?'

[9:43pm]

I click the On/Off button again, doesn't work. Again, doesn't work. Again. Again. Again. Nothing. I head to the power outlet and plug the TV off. The TV is now pitch black.

'I think the remote is just low on batteries.'

[10:10pm]

I'm in my room, listening to music while I sort out my closet, when I faintly hear giggling. Frustrated, I storm to their room.

'Jake, Jason, bedtime. Now.'

But to my surprise, they weren't awake.

'What the-'

I hear the giggling again, but a bit louder. I shrug it off as the neighbors. Walter, one of our neighbors always watches TV at max volume, I've known by my parents asking him to turn it down often.

'I'm cleaning my closet, then going to bed '

I am spooked out by all of these weird occurrences.

[10:20pm]

My room is clean, time for bed. As I was checking my window I saw Walter's house wasn't lit up, it didn't even look like someone was home.

As I drift into sleep, I can't help but think I'm forgetting something.
