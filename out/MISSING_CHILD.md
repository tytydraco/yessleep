It was the one-year anniversary of the death of the love of my life, and here I am in a car park, screaming at the top of my lungs at a stranger, any insult that came to my mind.

All because they drove down the wrong way of a one-way system, with all the entitlement of expecting me to reverse my car as if I’m the one in the wrong here.

I was so unimaginably angry. I got out of my car just so I could shout insults, with my shaking hands, into her side window. So I could do it as close to her face as humanly possible. I was so fucking angry. I wanted her to see how angry I was.

What is wrong with me? I think to myself. People make mistakes. I want to apologise but I don’t. I’m still too heated and I feel like a monster.

I look back to my one and only daughter. She is all of her mother’s heart. Kindness. Beauty. Just sitting in the back seat. Just playing with her soft toy kangaroo on her lap. Making it bounce up and down. Up and down. Like everything was okay.

And here I was, her father, shouting with maximum rage at a stranger like this was the most important hill to die on. Like all of humanity depended on this moment. So stupid of me. And there, only a few feet away in a metal shell, my daughter.

She just amused herself with that little kangaroo like there was nothing at all wrong with the world.

The soft sound of the car door closing had an almost comforting tone as it sealed off the external world. Almost. I don’t know what it was about this moment. This stupid unimportant moment. It all changed here.

I didn’t mean to look so deeply. Was supposed to be a brief glance. Check that she was okay. But I looked. I looked long and hard. I looked at that reverse image of my daughter in the rear-view mirror of the car.

With the echoes of my rage-stained adrenaline still pounding through my body, wilting away. My daughter sitting there so casually. So peaceful. My daughter. I turned back to look at her with my own eyes. Not through that reflection.

She peered up and smiled,
“I love you, Daddy. You are the best daddy in the whole entire universe.”
Like none of that moment that had just happened had happened. Like it was only me and her against the world.

I turned back to see the stranger reversing. Something was wrong. Like the moment you realise something is off and then you click your fingers and realise you are dreaming.

Something was wrong with the world. Like a little disembodied tickle in the back of my mind. How long had it been like this? How long had the world been wrong? How long had my daughter been missing?

I’m not this angry person, which I understand the impotence of that statement when I have already admitted to screaming at a stranger over essentially nothing. But nevertheless I sincerely want you to know I am not an angry person at heart.

I just had no idea what to do next.

I loved my daughter. She was the best thing to ever happen to me. I know who my daughter is. I would never raise my voice at my daughter, let alone lay a single finger on her.

So I’m not an angry person. I didn’t mean to do it. I had only meant. I didn’t mean to hit her as many times as I had. I didn’t mean to hit her as hard as I did. But the second and third — I just couldn’t stop.

She didn’t cry like my daughter. It was convincing but not convincing enough. A poor immitation. And the worst part — not the losing-my-temper part, not the hitting her — it was that I didn’t feel anything. I didn’t feel guilty about it. I didn’t feel like it was the wrong thing to do. The girl just curled up on the floor crying into her hands.

I should have hit her harder. I could have hit her harder. What am I saying?

I’m not crazy. I have my doubts. I know what I’m saying isn’t normal. I could be wrong. This could all be in my head. But I don’t know how to explain it. I know that this isn’t just in my head. 

It was her room.

Her bedroom. I couldn’t remember the last time I cleaned it. My daughter never put anything back. She was a bundle of chaos but in a good way. 

A constant storm of combustible energy. She played with everything, all of the time at the same time. Crayons trapped in the hair of dolls and hairbands. Play-doh on food plates under dirty clothes. Juice boxes, cut up pieces of card and scissors stashed into the underside of a pillow thrown against a wall. 

It was normal routine, every weekend the two of us working as a team, to tidy her things away so it no longer looked like a bomb had hit it. 

And now I look at her room. 

Nothing out of place. A neat line of soft toys standing at the foot of her freshly made bed. A perfectly clear space of uncluttered carpet, void of any heaped obstacles. Happy drawings of a happy family draped across a string on clothes pegs. Everything in its place. 

I don’t know why I did it. I just grabbed her bedding and pulled as hard as I could. I knocked a row of children’s books to the floor. Can’t you see this isn’t my daughter’s room? I could feel myself screaming at myself. 

“Are you okay, Daddy?”
“I can’t remember.”
“Remember what, Daddy?”
“Nothing.”
“Maybe I can help you find it?”
“Find what?”
“I don’t know,” she shrugged with a child’s innocence, “whatever you are looking for?”
“I’m not.”

I hit her. I hit her before I could finish my thought. Before I could finish what I was saying. An unbearable rage poured through me. I hit her hard. And couldn’t stop. When I left the room my face was wet. There is something wrong here. Something seriously wrong with her.

I’m not crazy, I swear.

She didn’t come out of her room. I could hear her sobbing. I could hear that thing sobbing. It was loud and seemingly uncontrollable. That thing was pretending. Then it dawned on me like acidic puke in the bottom of my belly.

The reason I was so angry. Why I was on edge all the time? I now know that thing is not my daughter. The world wasn’t wrong. That thing was wrong. Where the fuck is my daughter? My poor beautiful daughter.

What do I do?
I couldn’t tell anyone. 

That thing apologised to me for upsetting me. It tried to hug me. I pushed it away and left as quickly as I could.

It was the slightest of pressures pressing against my chest that stirred me from my sleep.

Blurred enough between the layers of dreams and consciousness to trick my mind into thinking of my loving wife’s arm, embracing me in our bed once more. The gentle rhythm of familiar breaths against my neck. God I miss you. I miss our family.

This isn’t it. You are not here. This was a dark room in the early hours of the night. Shadows of things upon shadows of things. I am awake. This was not her arm. This was not her hand.

This hand is small and thin and frail. Far too small to be recognisable. Far too frail to be familiar. It tightened around me with a soft warm pressure. I couldn’t help but think of a snake coiling around some prey. Tight. Claustrophobic. The small body that had crept into my bed.

What did you do to my daughter is all I could think about. I feel alone. My poor daughter. How could I have let this happen? This stranger that has planted itself in this home. 

How do I make it break character? Her small thin arm lying upon my chest. How easy would it be? How much pressure would it take? I don’t think it would take much effort at all. Just to slowly bend it in on itself. She wouldn’t fight back. Would it even know what I was doing. To snap that thing’s arm in two.

I let it sleep. I’m too tired. I’m not a violent man. I’m not a monster. I need it, to find my daughter. My real daughter. I need this thing to find my real daughter.

I printed off posters early that morning. Nice big posters with my daughter’s face on them. Big black clear letters right at the top. MISSING CHILD. I don’t know how many weekends I posted them through doors.

My memory is getting worse and worse. But I remember that the thing, it helped. Not that it had a choice, if it was to keep pretending to be something it wasn’t, it would have to do as I say. 

“Daddy I’m not missing? I’m right here.”
I ignored it. I ignored its tricks. But whilst I was stuck with it, at least I could use it. I made it stick up posters. I made it carry them.

It was when my neighbours looked at us funny. When I could hear the mumblings, the bewildered looks from strangers. It was winning this war against me. It was making me look crazy.

I had the last laugh when I shaved its hair. My daughter had beautiful walnut brown hair. This thing would look like the freak I knew it was. I screamed at it while it cried.
“Daddy please. Not my hair.”
“Shut up! I’m not your father!”

I will find my daughter.

I didn’t let it sleep in the house anymore.

I thought it would run away. I kind of hoped it would run away. I was fed up of looking at it. This poor imitation. This photocopy. But it stayed. It just embedded itself into a dilapidated shed at the end of the garden, every night.

Stupid really; if it had run away, I would never find my daughter. It would give me the answers I needed eventually. This was all I could hold on to. My poor lost daughter. Somewhere out there. All alone. Scared and hungry. Who knows where. It drove me insane, I just wanted to hold her again. I should have chained that thing up.

I would stare at it for hours. Waiting for it to slip up. Something. Anything, for that thing to get distracted and let its guard down. So it would know it no longer needed to keep the act up. 

Maybe it was so gradual, the change I mean, I could no longer see it. I had got so used to this image of her. Perhaps my daughter would be right in front of me and I wouldn’t recognise her. Like replacing a dead black cat with another black cat.

It whimpered it was hungry and I would feed it. I’m not cruel, but it would be something I would eventually do, not straight away. Give or take some hours.

It liked cold hotdogs and biscuits so that’s what I would feed it. It would thank me and try to hug me. I would slap its hands away. I wish it would stop trying. Does it think I’m failing?

It wasn’t like we were playing happy families anymore. This was far from normal. 

What kind of creature would still keep up this falsehood? Why does it torture me like this?

After weeks of prank calls and no answers. The repetitions of placing up missing-child posters over and over again on new streets and old streets. Day after day. Week after week. I’m ashamed to admit. 

I couldn’t handle it. I’m only human. I’ve always been too emotional. And cruelty isn’t something that comes easily to people like me. It was a moment of weakness. 

I felt weathered.

I felt faded.

I felt exhausted. 

Enough to let the dark thoughts seep in.

The worst thoughts.

The most twisted thoughts. 

Would it be so bad to fold to it.

To let it win. 

To accept it as my daughter. 

I would have found her by now if she was alive.

It’s just not possible she’s still alive.

This thing looked close enough to be my daughter. Would a substitute be enough. Enough for me to love. Like loving the memory of my wife. I was so weak. You couldn’t understand what I’m going through. It’s hard enough to rationalise in my own mind.

I found it, staring at a family photo, in one of the rooms. It let itself in. It always found a way back in. It looked sad and defeated. It mirrored my feelings perfectly. 

I placed my hand on that thing’s shoulder. It felt like my daughter’s shoulder. She flinched then let my hand rest there for a while. The thing used to be happy. It would smile and laugh. Now it was hollow. 

Trying to make me feel something for it. 

“Where is my daughter?”
All the anger had faded. My last desperate plea for mercy from it. It didn’t respond.
“Where is my daughter?”

I looked at the family photo. And all I could do was beg to God that I would be stronger. I was not. I fell to my knees and sobbed. The thing latched itself around me. I latched myself to it. It sobbed with me. She felt like something that felt like home. 

“Daddy. Is it over?”
“I’m not your father. But.” I paused, “I will be. I promise. I promise I will look after you, like you were my daughter. Promise me you’ll be exactly like my daughter?”

It was not that thing that spoke. Not my daughter who replied. Some disembodied noise from some deep crevice in the back of my brain with just enough rhyme to make words that itched. 

“This is not real. Drown her.”
