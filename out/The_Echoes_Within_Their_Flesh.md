For the past fifteen years I have lived in my own personal hell. Every day I hear their screams. I have not slept a full four hours in over fifteen years. After years of hard work, relentless nights, and a drastically unhealthy amount of caffeine, I am getting answers. These answers only lead to more and more questions. 



I am going to start writing this blog to keep track of my own mind, memories and self.  Slowly I am losing my own memories of this whole experience. The therapist I had growing up says that it's a trauma response. My brain is blocking out the memories of what really happened and is almost trying to replace them with images of a normal childhood. 



I am also here to warn you about what may happen to you, all of your friends, your sons and daughters. There is a hell that people have kept secret for fifteen years. I feel as though it is my duty to prevent this from happening to you.

 Because it is my fault. 

My name is Victoria Adams, and this is my hell. 

  
  
  


I cannot remember anything before I was ten years old. The first memory I have is on the night of November 5th, 2010. Being only ten years old, I was far younger than my sister and all of her friends. There were only four of us that night. 



The one girl I remember most vividly is Carrie. I remember always being on guard around her. Apparently, Carrie was on the verge of being considered insane. She would constantly lash out and lose sense of reality, but the times she was “normal” seemed to convince just enough adults. I remember her having long waistline black hair with dark green highlights. She was a bit taller too.



Carrie was only seventeen, but she had more than enough regrettable shitty tattoos probably done more drugs than she let on. Her brother, Nathan, went with her everywhere to make sure she didn't die. 



Carrie was the one who showed us the abandoned building in the middle of the woods. I still remember it clearly. High up decaying brick walls that almost reached the top of the trees. The paint was peeling off of the bricks and doors, leaving almost nothing but rot. We were lucky it was still light out, because the entire building was a maze. The ceiling had collapsed in, letting the sunshine through. 



Eventually we all settled down into some room, brushing aside debris and ashes from all the smoking being done in that little room. 



“Jesus, this place still smells like death. I can never get used to it.” Carrie’s nose was scrunched, turned up in the air before she lit her cigarette. It was most likely because of the dead bird that was on boxes above her head. 



“What was this place anyways? I saw a couple of broken machines down there.” I whispered, looking around at this place. My sister, Darcie, had turned to me with a small reassuring smile on her beautiful tan face. 



“They were just some medical machines. It could have been a storage house for a hospital nearby, there's not enough space for it to have been a hospital. No undead surgeon is out to get you.” I remember Darcie’s huge gleaming smile, like she did not have a single care in the world. Darcice was such a kind person. She had tattoos crawling up her arms and she taught me how to take care of our dark curly hair. 



Nathan rested his dark brown hair up against the wall and closed his eyes. He seemed to be able to sleep in any situation. I now envy him for that. 



Carrie was humming a soft song to herself as my sister, and I talked about what we would do for dinner when we got home. We lived with our parents, but they were rarely home due to work. 

After only around ten minutes of sitting down, Carrie got bored. She let out a huge sigh, sinking downwards from her place against the wall, until she was laying on the floor.

“What's up, Care Bear? Out of smokes?” Darcie let that same smile creep onto her face, letting it take over. 

Carrie gave her a harsh glare and rolled her eyes. “I don't want to sit around anymore; you guys are so boring.” Carrie stood up, immediately alerting Nathan. He quickly got to his feet, and followed Carrie. 

Darcie turned to look at me. “Don’t get too far V. Carrie is in one of her moods again, wait till it passes before you get close to her again.” I nodded quickly at Darcie’s words, knowing that whatever she said was important. She didn’t say anything that didn't have meaning. 

I reluctantly got up and followed my sister. Something did not sit right. Not even back then, when the wind screamed through the narrow halls and found places to echo that shouldn't be possible. 

We walked while Carrie mumbled to herself, followed by Nathan’s input every now and again. Darcie went completely quiet, making me walk at a pace in front of her. Every time we heard the slightest noise, she would protectively reach out towards me, head on a swivel. 

The eerie quiet filled our ears, only interrupted occasionally because of Carrie's input or our breathing. Even though we were outside, all animals seemed to have avoided this place.

When stairs to a basement appeared, Darcie stopped. 

“We’re not going down there. You got a smoke in, we explored for a little bit, it's time to go.” Darcie’s tone meant that it was not up for discussion. We were leaving. 

Carrie scoffed, crossing her arms and turning around to face Darcie. 

“You forgot that I drove us here. You don't have a ride home so you can either walk home, or stop being a fucking loser and come have some fun.” Carrie’s shaky voice with her hands dangerously close to a pocketknife made even Nathan nervous. 

“Carrie, it's going to be dark soon. It was hard enough finding our way during the night, so we should go,” Nathan put his hand on Carrie’s shoulder, but she smacked it away. 

“You all just fucking hate me! Is that it?” Carrie’s voice seemed to be louder than normal. She gripped her chest and started heavy breathing. She was shaking in anger, her long black hair falling over her face. 

“You know that's not true Carrie. We don’t hate you; we just don't want anyone getting hurt.” Darcie had an extremely tight grip on my arm, not allowing me to move anywhere far from her. I held onto the back of her shirt, not willing to let go.

“Liars, you're all fucking liars!” Carrie screamed and started walking towards Darcie. Her hand was reaching for her knife, I was scared. 

I knew my sister could handle her own, but if she touched Carrie, Nathan would freak out even more. I knew that Nathan wouldn't dare touch me, so I did what I thought was right at that moment. 

I reached out behind my sister, and shoved Carrie. 

At first, I didn't realize what I had done. I didn't realize how close Carrie still was to the stairs. She locked eyes with me as she fell backwards towards the ground, headfirst. Nathan reacted immediately, racing down the stairs toward her, taking two or three at a time. 

Darcie forgot all about her fear and raced down the stairs. 

I followed after Darcie, much slower and did not have as much urgency. I remember being terrified of what Carrie would do to me. 

Carrie was sitting in a pile of red, but it wasn't her blood. No, it was far worse than that. I stood two or three stairs up from the basement, not allowing myself to go any farther in. Darcie didn’t touch her, and Nathan wasn’t sure how to help her. 

It was all cement, no plaster or wood. There were many twists and turns around hallways and walls, almost looking like a cement maze. There was no lighting, only enough light from the sun shining through the empty windows and through pieces of missing ceiling. 

Broken shards of glass, red sticky paste, and medical equipment covered the floor around all of them. My sister was careful of where she stepped, but Nathan was too focused on the best angle to pick Carrie up without shoving glass farther into her skin. 

It was too quiet. Echoes erupted through the endless halls from the slightest movement. I don't know if it was just my imagination, but I could have sworn I heard the soft rustle of chains.

What surprised us all is that Carrie picked herself up. She looked down at the floor and noticed the sticky membrane-like substance all around her. Glass stuck out of her skin and scratched all the way down to her legs. 

A single lid was now rolling across the floor, before losing momentum and settling on the floor. 

One single jar contained enough nightmare fuel to ruin the world. 

I was not the only one to notice Carrie’s wounds had a faint glow to them. Darcie stepped away from her as soon as she saw it. She continued stepping back until she met me by the stairs. 

“Something is wrong,” I whispered. Darcie only nodded, keeping her eyes trained on Carrie. 

“Darcie, where the fuck are you going? She needs our help!” Nathan screamed, seeming not to take no for an answer. Darcie just slowly shook her head, knowing in her bones that glowing wounds were more than just a trick to her eyes. 

All of Nathan’s anger dropped when Carrie screamed. I heard the cracking of bones and watched as an arm grew out of Carrie’s bicep. All of the fat that once had been on her arm was gone and replaced with a third arm. 

Carrie’s screams as bones emerged from underneath her skin echoed throughout the cellar walls. She felt every bit of it, tears streaming down her face. Her yells only got worse when another arm emerged on the other side. 

The arms began to move, wiggling the fingers, rolling its wrist. The actions were much calmer than I ever would have imagined. 

Carrie frantically began to pull the arms out of her body but only screamed when pressure was applied. Blood poured out of the open wounds, and onto the cold cement floor. 

“SOMEBODY HELP ME! Nathan, come on help me!” Carrie screamed frantically. Nobody dared step closer. Even Nathan stepped away from her and towards Darcie and I. 

We watched in horror as her legs got shorter. Her stomach fat decreased, and her head became…bigger. 

Carrie’s shouts for help were deafening, but we couldn't run. Every bone in my body was begging for me to run, but I couldn’t move. 

The two new hands that had come out of Carrie reached up towards her head. It looked like a ballerina with hands arched above her head. Only with an extra set of hands sticking outwards and flailing. 

Carrie dropped to her knees, her original hands grasping at her chest. 

I watched as those her new hands as sharp as needles, dug into Carrie’s head. Like two knives attempting to split apart a watermelon. It was careful to go straight down and not scoop out anything from her head.

I heard the gushes of blood, the shattering of bones, screams, and the sound of my heartbeat all louder than the next.  

Carrie had momentarily stopped screaming, her eyes widening in horror as she felt her face slowly being split apart. Her entire head began being split in two. One eye on this side, another on that side. Most of the nose went to her left side while the mouth was split pretty evenly. 

Blood went everywhere, covering all of her recognizable facial features into a bloodbath. It sprayed all of us from twenty feet away.

Carrie’s screams were loud, but the laughter coming from inside her head was louder.

It wasn’t until I heard the laughter that I realized there was a second face inside of Carrie’s head. It too was divided, almost exactly like Carrie’s. It wasn't the normal color of dark red flesh, but a dark black mixed with neon greens and dark blues. 

That face kept laughing and laughing, over and over again. 

I was going to continue staring, until Darcie grabbed my wrist and began sprinting. The last thing I saw of the beast in the cellar was it twitching and trying to figure out how to maneuver its new body. 

Nathan quickly followed after us. We ran through the confusing maze of horrors, trying to lose the things that we heard behind us.

Its footsteps were louder, more spaced out at times, like it had completely forgotten how to walk, but still wanted to come towards us. Nathan pulled us into a room, closing the door as quietly as he could behind him.

“Did that…really just happen?” I whispered. Darcie put a reassuring hand on my shoulder but ignored my statement. 

“We need to keep running. Our best bet is to get to Carrie’s truck,” Darcie told Nathan. He shook his head. 

“That thing could be faster. It's almost dark anyways, it'll be like fucking birdbox, going through the woods blind with a monster after us,” Nathan shot back, looking around. “Besides, pipsqueak here can’t run as fast as you and I.” Nathan said, jutting a finger towards me. 

I was ready to cry, reading to freak out and give up, but when I looked at the deathly calm calculating Darcie, I felt a little better. She had gotten us out of tight situations before, this would be no different. 

“No, running is the only option. It doesn’t know how to use its legs yet, if we run now, this could be our only chance. We’ve wasted enough time already.” Darcie’s tone said that it was final. Nathan only ran a frustrated hand through his hair, sighing. 

Darcie cleared the window of any leftover glass and slid through it first. Then I went through the window, then Nathan. We all began running, our arms pumping as we went. I had a hard time keeping up, but I had more than enough motivation to sprint as hard as I possibly could while running. 

All of us got chills when we heard the thundering footsteps and the laughter that echoed throughout the trees sounded like it was right behind us. 

With the darkening sky, it was harder to see roots that had been upturned, logs and branches that would break your shins, and the thorns on bushes, but we didn't care. 

We had one destination, and that was the truck. We got to a clearing; one we had passed on our hike to the abandoned building.

That's when it found us.

It all happened so quickly, especially while running away and in the dark, I could barely make anything out. By the glances behind my shoulder, I saw a screaming Nathan trying to reattach his head, while a second one grew out of his wound. 

The head was spinning like a carousel on drugs, warping and shaping itself like clay. It finally decided on a face, one that looked horrifyingly similar to Nathan's. Carrie’s…monster stopped running. It wanted to watch the transformation happen. It needed to see what it had created. 

Darcie yelled for me to keep running, so I did. I could see faint lights in the distance, over a hill. We heard Carrie’s laughter becoming closer. Darcie knew that we wouldn’t make it to the lights in time. 

Darcie stopped at a huge oak tree and demanded that I climb. She squatted down and took one of my feet in her connected hands. It was like what we used to do in the pool. She sent me flying upwards where I caught one of the branches. 

I climbed higher, and Darcie followed after me. I tore my hands open from the rough bark, and my lungs were screaming at me to take deeper breaths, but I knew how loud I would be. 

Just as Darcie got to my height in the tree, she saw the houses. Just as she settled on the branch, Carrie’s creature came running. Nathan was nowhere to be seen. 

Carrie grabbed my hands, making me look her in the eyes. 

“You need to stay *silent*. If you do that, we’ll be okay.” Darcie didn't make a sound, only mouthed it. I nodded quickly, trembling with fear. Deep down, I think Darcie knew that was a lie. 

We waited for five minutes, maybe more. It felt like years stretched on, just praying that the beast didn’t hear us. It was so painful to hear Carrie talking incoherently to herself. The beast would speak words that almost sounded human but then cut itself of to laugh maniacally to itself for a few moments.

It didn’t hear us. But it sure smelled us. 

The side of Carrie’s face with a nose snapped up towards us, and I almost screamed. It started laughing maniacally, trying to climb the tree but it didn’t have full control of its limbs yet. Through the fear racing throughout my body, I still was able to hear Carrie. 

“RUN, DARCIE V RUN!” Her voice was now deeper, raspier. But it still had a hint of Carrie. 

I looked to Darcie for guidance, fear spreading throughout my body. When I turned to look at her, she was looking up at the sky, a silent tear running down her cheek. She closed her eyes and took a long shaking breath. 

The creature was now banging on a tree, but Darcie didn’t seem to be panicking. Instead, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a key. I recognized that key. It was the key to the small chest in her room that she kept her most valuable items. She had let me look through them many times. She kept the key on her at all times, because she never wanted anyone else to look through her things.  

“Take it. You are a smart girl, Victoria. You know what you have to do. I do not want you to look back, I do not want you to cry until you are home and safe. Tell mom and dad to call the police, and a man is killing us. A man, maybe men, but not a monster you hear me?” Darcie whispered. She gave my hand a tight squeeze. 

“I love you more than I love myself Victoria. Don’t waste your life, live it to the fullest.” I didn’t want these to be her last words to me, but I knew that they would be. I held onto her for as long as I could, until she pulled me away.

“I love you too Darcie. I promise to find a way to make all of this better. I promise,” My words were nothing but the truth, even if nobody believed it at the moment, I would make those words true. 

Darcie only smiled at me. “I know you will, V.” And with that she began hopping down branch to branch. When she got to the ground, she ran off a bit before she started yelling. 

“Carrie you psychotic bitch! Get over here!” she ran off towards the building, making the creature snap both sides of its head towards her. Instead of laughing, it turned into pure anger. 

It yelled out a growl that came from the pits of hell. It hated to be challenged. It leaned forwards, onto Carrie’s second hands and its feet. It charged at Darcie on all fours while yelling in rage. 

That's when I jumped down from the tree. I ran as hard as I could, I ran up the hill and took a final glance back, only to see Darcie looking right back at me. Her signature smile still on her face as the monster that Carrie had become charged at her.

I turned around and ran. 

When I got to the lights (it had been a neighborhood) I banged on doors, screaming and crying for help. I told them that a group of men were trying to kill all of my friends. They sent dozens of squad cars. Soon all sections of the government, around a dozen high end scientists from a lab named Biocore Tech., and even NASA began showing up in those woods. I was interviewed and questioned for hours, I will say more on all of that later. 

Then twelve years later I graduated top of my class from Berkeley with a master's degree in Biochemistry, and undergraduate in biology. I will have to explain more in depth soon, I have to go to work.

I work at Biocore Tech. and I have dedicated my life to finding a cure in my sister's name and the dozens of others that have fallen victim to the parasite.
