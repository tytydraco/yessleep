I'm not the type of person who goes hiking in the woods alone. But my friend canceled on me last minute and I was desperate for some alone time, so I decided to go for it. I packed a bag with some snacks, water, and my phone just in case I needed to call for help. I also brought a small notebook to write down any thoughts or ideas that came to mind.

As I walked along the trail, I couldn't help but feel like I was being watched. Every time I turned around, I didn't see anything. But the feeling persisted, so I tried to focus on the beauty of nature around me.

After a couple of hours, I came across a small clearing with a fallen log. I decided to take a break and eat some of my snacks. That's when I saw it. A small leather-bound journal just laying on the ground, as if it was waiting for me to find it.

I picked it up and opened it, curious to see what was inside. The first few pages were blank, but then I came across a page with a single sentence written in neat handwriting: "Don't look back."

At first, I thought it was just a random warning or a joke. But as I continued to read, the entries became more and more disturbing. The author wrote about feeling like they were being followed, about hearing strange noises in the woods, and about seeing shadowy figures lurking in the trees.

I couldn't put the journal down. It was like a train wreck that I couldn't look away from. But the more I read, the more I felt like something was watching me. I kept turning around, but I didn't see anything.

As I continued down the trail, I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that had settled in my stomach. Every rustling leaf, every snapping twig made me jump. And then I heard it. A faint whispering voice, like someone was speaking right in my ear.

"Don't look back," the voice said. I turned around, but there was no one there. I tried to ignore it and keep walking, but the voice kept whispering, getting louder and more urgent with each step.

I finally reached the end of the trail, but the feeling of being watched stayed with me even as I got in my car and drove home. When I got there, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It was like the air in my house was thicker, heavier.

That's when I saw it. The journal was on my kitchen table, open to a new page. The same neat handwriting as before, but this time the message was clear.

"I'm not just in the woods."

I felt a chill run down my spine as I read the words in the journal. How did it get here? I had left it on the log in the woods. My mind raced as I tried to rationalize what was happening. Maybe someone had found the journal and followed me home to return it. But the feeling of dread that had been following me since I found the journal only intensified.

I tried to ignore the journal and go about my day as usual, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every creak of the floorboards made me jump, and I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something lurking just out of sight.

That night, I was jolted awake by a sound in my bedroom. I sat up and looked around, but everything seemed normal. And then I saw it. The journal was on my nightstand, open to a new page.

This time, the message was even more ominous.

"I'm closer than you think."

I felt a wave of fear wash over me. Who was writing these messages? Were they following me? And why? I tried to tell myself that it was just a coincidence, that someone was playing a sick joke on me, but deep down I knew it was something more.

Over the next few days, the messages in the journal became more and more frequent, and the feeling of being watched never left me. I started to see shadowy figures lurking in the corners of my vision, and I heard strange whispers in the dead of night.

I knew I had to do something, so I went back to the woods where I found the journal. As I walked along the trail, the feeling of dread grew stronger and stronger. And then I saw it. A figure standing at the edge of the woods, just out of sight.

I froze, unsure of what to do. And then it spoke.

"I've been waiting for you."

The voice was cold and inhuman, and I knew I had to run. I turned and sprinted back down the trail, not daring to look back. The feeling of being chased was overwhelming, and I could hear the figure's footsteps getting closer and closer.

I finally made it back to my car and peeled out of the parking lot, my heart racing. As I drove away, I saw the figure standing at the edge of the woods, watching me.

I never went back to the woods after that day, but the feeling of being watched never left me. And the journal? It disappeared without a trace, leaving me to wonder what kind of horrors might still be waiting for me out there in the woods.
