I (18f) don’t have much to do with my mum since her and my dad divorced 13 years ago. My dad always just said she’s not well if I ever asked about the divorce, that she didn’t want to be a mother and we’re better off without her.

I had no siblings and lived with my dad who stayed mostly single up until last year when he met his girlfriend, Kerry. I’d see my mum maybe 3 or 4 times a year, the occasional call or text and a Christmas card and a gift every year so we weren’t particularly close.

My mum had a husband, Jim. He and his daughter had gone missing about a month ago when they went on a camping trip together for her birthday. There had been countless search parties out for them but the police had no leads and my mum seemed pretty distraught over it, so you can imagine we found it difficult to say no when she’d invited us all over for Christmas dinner. Kerry had elected to spend Christmas day with her family so we all spent Christmas Eve together.

On Christmas day my dad and I went to spend the morning with my grandparents (my dad’s parents, my mum’s parents had died before I was born) and set off to my mum’s for dinner. We’d bought a few gifts and some wine for her which she seemed to really appreciate when presented with them when we got there.

The house was filled with the smells of a Christmas dinner, although there were not many decorations and only a small tree decorated with a few golden baubles in the corner of the living room. I perched myself on the sofa with my dad while mum scurried about the kitchen.

When she appeared again she handed me a small gift tied with a white ribbon.

I said thank you and proceeded to open it. It was a small box containing a golden necklace with a blue gem encased in the middle of a flower design. It was beautiful but it seemed a little old and worn.

“It was my mother’s before me, and now it’s your’s.” Mum said, practically bursting with barely contained glee.

“I…I don’t know what to say.” I replied, feeling myself begin to tear up. This was the most thoughtful thing my mum had ever given me and yet it felt wrong, almost as if this wasn’t supposed to be mine.

I gave mum a slightly awkward hug and sat back down, turning to my dad to fill the silence that followed.

Dad was inspecting the necklace with a confused look on his face. “Funny..I swear I’ve seen this before. Maybe it was something similar.” Dad said as he placed the box containing the necklace on the coffee table.

Mum didn’t say anything in response, just walked into the kitchen and began continuing dinner preparation.

“Dinner is almost done, just a couple more minutes on the veggies!” Mum called out.

“I’m just going to the toilet quickly before we eat.” I announced and began walking to the back of the bungalow house to the bathroom.

I did my business, washed my hands and stared at myself in the mirror, wondering how quickly dad and I could get this over with. It was then I noticed a faint odour permeate my nostrils, a smell I’d never smelled before. It smelled putrid.

I walked out of the bathroom to investigate, following the stench as it got stronger and stronger. It seemed to be coming from a room in the far back, the door slightly ajar. 

I stopped dead in my tracks as I noticed a family photo just the left of the room releasing the offending smell. This was the same photo the news stories used when reporting on mum’s missing family. I stared at it, my mum, her husband and his daughter smiling back at me. I stared at the daughter’s neck and realised she was wearing a necklace, a necklace identical to the “family heirloom” my mum had just given me. It looks much cleaner and newer tied around her neck in this photo.

I turned my attention to the smell again and began opening the door to what turned out to be a bedroom. I stared in horror at what I saw laying on the double bed, the cause of the smell.

My mum’s husband and his daughter lay next to each other, twisted and rigid. Their bodies decayed and rotten, their faces covered by cloths. The husband was missing a leg and the daughter an arm, but there was no blood. No remnants of decay on the flower patterned bedsheets they lay on. They were covered in dirt and mud and the wounds where their limbs had been removed looked old and covered in maggots. It looked as if they had been previously buried, dug up and placed in the room. Perhaps in preparation for our visit.

I stared in shock, unable to move. My eyes watered and tears began to stream down my cheeks.

“Dinner is ready, darling. Come and get it!” My mum called out from the dining room.

I stumbled back and hit the wall behind me, slowly lowering myself to the floor. My legs felt likes jelly. My dad wasn’t lying when he said mum wasn’t well.

I scrambled to my feet and ran to the dining room, screaming for my dad. I stopped in the doorway and saw a table set with three plates. My mum stood, knife in hand ready to carve the meat that sat in the middle of the table surrounded by bowls of veggies and potatoes.

My eyes searched for my dad. He was sat at the far right end of the table, hands bound and body tied to the chair with a piece of duct tape covering his mouth. His teary eyes met mine with a look of sadness and desperation.

“Don’t look so horrified, darling. Now we can be a family again, I’m ready to be the mother I never was.” Mum said with a gaping smile stretched ear to ear.

My eyes traveled to the food on the table. There on a plate in the centre was an arm, its hand sticking upward with fingers contorted and rigid. Next to it, a leg cut off at the knee with a bare foot still attached to the end of it.

“Come and sit down, hunnie. Mummy said dinner is ready.” Mum said as she took a step toward me…
