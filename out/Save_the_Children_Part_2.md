CW: addiction, mention of physical and sexual child abuse

\*\*\*\*\*

I spent the hour and a half between waking and Theo’s arrival with Alyssa moving like a coked-up raccoon, scrubbing off the half-dried green paint and arranging appliances and furniture to cover what I couldn’t clean.  No way anyone with two working brain cells - let alone an experienced social worker - would leave a kid alone with the sort of weirdo who’d do what I’d, apparently, done in my sleep.

An hour and twenty-six minutes later, the painted words that couldn’t be scoured away were cleverly disguised, and Theo stepped through the doorway.  He gave me a hug, but he still didn’t call me Dad.  He was much more excited about the microscopic guest house than I was.  His eyes bugged out when he saw his bedroom.

For weeks, I’d spent the better part of my free time decorating that room.  I’d scoured Craigslist, all the free stuff apps, and garage sales for unique toys.  Alyssa told me Theo was going through a dinosaur phase, so I’d eaten Ramen for a week to afford a set of good-quality plastic dinosaur models.  I thought we could play with them together.

Theo seemed more enthralled by his brand-new bed.

“Is this blanket… mine?” He asked, indicating the Transformers coverlet I’d ordered off Amazon.  

I chuckled.  “Of course, kid.  All yours.”

He beamed, then dashed off for the living room.  “Can I watch the TV?”

Alyssa gave me a look.  “It is a nice place.”

I was glad she approved.  We followed Theo to the main room, to find him crouched with an odd expression in his eyes.

“Why does it say ‘save the children’ under the table?” he asked.

Alyssa went to the kitchen table and bent over.  Fuck.  I could barely fit under there; I hadn’t even thought to check.  

Alyssa straightened and stared at me.  There was a look on her face, but it wasn’t The Look.  The Look I’d received from countless counselors and authority figures - that sterile, placating way of regarding me that said without saying I was a mistake of the creator, incapable of existing alongside pure beings.  No.  The look she gave me - the look suppressed as soon as it appeared - was one of abject terror.

“I have OCD!” I blurted out.  “It’s a thing I do when I’m nervous.”

That wasn’t completely a lie.  I had been diagnosed with OCD, a souvenir from my anxiety-marinated childhood, but painting Save the Children all over inappropriate surfaces had never been one of my rituals.

I have no idea if Alyssa believed me.  But she looked mildly relieved.  

“I can recommend a therapist if you want,” she said. 

Theo, for his part, didn’t seem bothered at all.  We found him happily chasing a cat in the backyard.

\*\*\*\*\*

“Class, this is Theodore,” Miss Janice said, the next morning.  “Theodore, is there a nickname you’d like to be called?”

Theo looked at his shoes, trying to take up as little space as possible.  “Theo,” he said. 

I stood off to the side with Alyssa.  I patted the lighter in my pocket six times.  

The children of All Souls Preschool sat on little cushions, two to a squat, round table.  There were watercolors and pictures of sea creatures on the walls, a library of picture books in one corner, and toys impeccably organized in multicolored boxes.  Alyssa was charmed.  I was embarrassingly proud of myself for impressing her.  She had no obligation to come, but she’d promised Theo she’d see him off on his first day of school.

I wasn’t sure where I placed on the Good Parent scoreboard.  I’d had Theo up at six-thirty, showered and fed Eggs waffles, and in class at 7:45 on the dot.  But I’d also let him inhale ten Oreos the night before, which set him off running circles around the yard like a golden retriever puppy until the sugar high wore off and he practically collapsed into bed.  He seemed happy to be in a class with other children, though.  He plopped himself down at a table with Peter and Jason, who greeted him with wide smiles.  

I saw Winter and Corbin at an adjacent table.  I shuddered.

Then, Miss Annie took me by the arm.  “I realized we’ve never officially shown you around,” she said.  “You and your…”

She eyed Alyssa, waiting to be introduced.

“Friend,” Alyssa jumped in, saving me from the awkwardness.  “I’m a family friend.”  

Miss Annie led us to the yard, which was even more extravagant than it had looked through the chain-link fence.  A paved tricycle track led all around the school.  There was a swing set with a tire swing in one corner, a jungle gym in the other, and a massive sandbox in the middle.  Then, she took us back inside to the administrative office, where I had to sign some paperwork.

In a little hallway, Alyssa reached for a door handle.  “Is this the…”

“NO!” Miss Annie snapped, more dramatically than the situation warranted.

Alyssa jumped back, cowed.  “I was just looking for the bathroom.  I’m sorry.”

“It’s quite alright,” Miss Annie said, her voice stabilizing.  “It’s just… that room’s private.  The bathroom is down that way.”

She pointed, Alyssa scurried off.  I was signing and initialing when a scream cut through the silence.  Miss Annie and I immediately ran for the source - an auxiliary classroom filled with toys.  

Alyssa stood there, clutching a teddy bear.  The bear was worn and old, in a fading blue dress with a prominent B sharpied on the skirt.  Alyssa’s skin was bloodless pale, her eyes wild.  

“Where did you get this?” she practically screeched.  “WHERE?”  

Miss Annie, hands outstretched, took a step back.  “You know, I don’t remember.  Probably a garage sale, or…”

“WHERE?” Alyssa insisted, so feral she scared me.  “This is Bronwyn’s FUCKING BEAR!”

A sob, then an awkward giggle.

I turned around to see Miss Janice and Miss Marin in the hall behind us.  The kids, little faces confused, gathered behind them.  They’ been summoned by Alyssa’s screams.

Alyssa’s animalistic fury immediately cooled.  She stared at the kids, panting, too ashamed to meet their eyes.  She dropped the bear and, without another word, pushed between Miss Annie and me and escaped to the parking lot.

\*\*\*\*\*

Theo sat alone on a swing when I arrived to collect him at five.  But he smiled and skipped through the parking lot to the car, so school couldn’t have been awful.

“How was your first day?” I asked, as we pulled onto the freeway.  

“It was good,” Theo said unemotionally.

“How do you like the other kids?”  I tried again.

“They’re nice.”

Wow.  I had no future as an FBI interrogator.  

“Let’s try this, buddy,” I said, pursuing a new angle to get more than three words out of him.  “What was your favorite part of the day?”

Theo shifted in the back seat.  “When I played Neffy-Foo with Grace and Anna Rae.”

“Neffy-what?” I asked, intrigued by the ingenuity of Generation Alpha.

“Neffy-Foo,” Theo repeated.  “It’s a game where we pretend we’re knights and wizards on another planet.  I didn’t really get it.  But Anna Rae said that’s okay, because they’ve been playing this game for thirty years and know all the world batting.”

“I think the phrase is world *building*, kiddo.”  

*Thirty years.  Adorable.*  I had socks older than those kids.  “Okay, nice,” I continued, eager to keep him talking.  “Now why don’t you tell me about your least favorite part of your day.”

In the rearview mirror, Theo puckered his lips.  

“The Grey Rock Ghoul,” he said.  

For years, every conversation I’d had was about knocking over convenience stores or terrible prison food.  Now, I was devoting my mental energy to Neffy-Foo and the monster in the closet.  I’d truly become a dad.  

“What’s the Grey Rock Ghoul?”

Theo’s face was serious.  “He’s a creature who lives in the rocks behind the school.  He has long legs and long arms and black fur and he drinks the blood of little boys and girls.  And Peter said he’s gonna grow big and strong and kill every kid in the city if…”

He stopped.  He clamped his hands over his mouth.

“No, no, no, no, NO!” he muttered. 

A lightning bolt of terror cut through me.  I nearly swerved out of our lane.  

“No!”  Theo shouted.  “I wasn’t s’posed to tell you!”  

“It’s fine, Theo,” I assured him, trying to calm myself.  “I’m no snitch.  What did Peter say?”

“NO!” Theo yelped.  “If I tell you, they’ll get in trouble.  They’ll get punished!”

He shook his head frantically, then kept his mouth shut for the rest of the ride home.  I didn’t press him.  He remained quiet as we ate spaghetti and hot dogs for dinner, then slunk off to his bedroom and fell asleep without even asking for desert.  

I opened a window and lit up a cigarette, then another one, then another.  I still hadn’t fully processed my terrifying experience in the church with Corbin and Winter.  Then, there was Alyssa’s completely bonkers outburst, and now a child-eating rock gremlin.  Was my life slipping through the veil into the Twilight Zone?  Or was this just parenthood?

Theo’s cries brought me crashing back down to earth.  I dumped my cigarette and made a mad dash for his bedroom, worst case scenarios kicking at the inside of my head.  

I found Theo scrunched up in a ball, cocooned in his Transformers comforter, sniffling with tears running down his little cheeks.  I sat down on his bed and wrapped my arms around him.

“Hey buddy, it’s okay!” I said, in a tone of voice I hoped was soothing.  “Didja have a nightmare?”

“Yeah,” Theo croaked.  “I dreamed I was spinning and spinning, and then these scary figures came and took me away!  And I cried and I cried,  because that's how the other kids got stolen away from their mommy!”  

I didn’t know what to say.  So I just hugged him, wrapping myself around his warm little body until he fell back to sleep.

\*\*\*\*\*

*I don’t believe in fairy tales*, I reminded myself.  *No ghosts, no dream creatures, no Grey Rock Ghoul.*  

I was just being a responsible parent.  

A responsible parent who, after picking Theo up, parked in the spot furthest from All Souls Preschool and made camp.  A responsible parent who gave my four-year-old Lunchables Pizza and Sunny Delight for dinner then kept him entertained with episodes of Bluey on my phone, insisting we’d go home just as soon as the other kids’ parents arrived to pick them up.  

No matter how I looked at it, things with those six kids were weird.  Each morning, when I arrived with Theo, all six were already there.  Each afternoon, when I picked him up, there were still six of them.  Besides the Misses, Alyssa and me, I’d never seen another adult anywhere near the preschool.  And that seemed strange.  Did these kids never need to leave early for a dentist’s appointment?  Weren’t there usually parent volunteers at preschools?  PTAs?  Carpools?

*And I cried and I cried, because that's how the other kids got stolen away from their mommy!*  Theo’s words, Theo’s nightmare, stuck in my head.  

I would remain in the parking lot until another parent showed up to collect their kid.  Just one other parent.  I only needed to have a conversation with one.  

Then it was nine o’clock, Theo had curled up asleep in the back seat, and I was - still - alone in the parking lot.  

Thee hours before, around six, the sound of children’s voices subsided.  An hour or so later, Miss Marin came out with her pocket knife and performed her odd ritual of slashing at the poinsettia trees.  Since then, nothing had stirred but the occasional squirrel.  

Careful not to wake my son, I pried my phone out of his little hand.  I leaned back in my seat and, almost on a whim, Google’d the Grey Rock Ghoul.  I imagined he was something like Slenderman, an internet creation older brothers described to their younger brothers to make them lose their shit.  

The hit I got, though, was much more interesting.

In 1990, an Evangelical minister named Roy Fletcher claimed to have been given the gift of divine sight.  He witnessed horrific creatures out of the Book of Revelations - behemoths with foot-long fangs and blood-stained claws, abominations summoned from the ether by witch cults and pagans, poised to slaughter the innocent, to tear them to pieces.  Reverend Fletcher had been chosen as a second messiah, of sorts: he alone knew how to defeat these monsters.  He broke away from the church, taking about twenty families with him.  He convinced his followers to pull their children out of school and leave them to him to educate - he would train them up as a generation of holy monster fighters.  

The Reverend’s nemesis - the Joker to his Batman - was a twisted entity called The Grey Rock Ghoul.  The Ghoul hid in cracks and dark corners.  He was a shape-shifter.  He could take the form of a leviathan with teeth the size of buildings, or a thing so small he could sit in the curve of your ear and whisper unspeakable phrases.  The Grey Rock Ghoul also possessed his victims - controlled the minds of righteous men and bent them to his will.  He hungered for the blood of innocents.  The first line of defense for the children - the only line of defense against this vile, primeval creature - was the holy power of Reverend Fletcher and his acolytes. 

Some people accused Reverend Fletcher of running a cult.  But he and his followers existed quietly and without drama in Los Angeles, until 1994.  That year, their church caught on fire.  Reverend Fletcher was the only casualty; he perished and his body burned.  His followers scattered once their messiah had perished.  Though reportedly, they could be distinguished by their shared tattoo: four heart-shaped leaves, arranged in a cross.  

I clicked on a photo of the tattoo design.  

\*\*\*\*\*

The next morning, after leaving Theo in the classroom, I cornered Miss Marin in the front office.

“Where are their parents, lady?” I snapped.  “Where do they come from?  I sat in the parking lot until one in the morning last night.  Not a single other parent showed up to get their kid.  And… and while we’re at it, why didn’t you tell me some preacher got burned up in the church I’m rebuilding?”

Miss Marin didn’t flinch.  It was a little creepy, I realized, how her kindergarten-teacher smile seemed permanently plastered on her face.

“I’m sorry, Jake,” she said lightly.  “I was not aware of the church’s history.  The nonprofit acquired this property only two years ago; I was not involved in the decision-making process at all.”

“Oh,” I muttered, the wind momentarily knocked out of my sails.

“As for the children,” she continued, “I didn’t want to tell you - because, frankly, it’s none of your business - but our six students, besides your son, are all orphans.  They live in a group home in Sylmar.  But sometimes, when they’ve had a long day, we allow them to sleep here for the night.”

She cocked her head.  “Given your history, Jake, I’m sure you can understand the need for young children to have a safe place.  Because - and I’m sure you’ll agree - the worst thing in the world is when a child loses their innocence.”

I looked at my feet.  She was right.

I slunk back to the church.  I’d convinced The Misses to pay a consultant to tell me what needed to be knocked down and rebuilt, then watched a lot of YouTube videos by mild-to-moderately creepy homesteaders.  I was a few whacks with a mallet into an interior wall when I heard a cute little sneeze behind me.  

I dropped the mallet on my foot.  The sharp pain was the only thing that saved me from pooping my pants.  When I’d finished cursing my life in non-child-friendly language, I turned to release my fury on the idiot who’d interrupted a guy with a big hammer.  

It was Winter.  The little girl who’d nearly made me waste my underwear two days before.  Something about her hit my senses like nails on a chalkboard.

“Do you have any… idea… how close you came to getting killed?” I stammered out, any authority I might have commanded offset my squeaky, high-pitched voice.  “Never, never, NEVER sneak up on someone like that!”

Winter’s face scrunched up into a pout.  I realized what about her seemed so wrong, and my stomach dropped like an anvil.  

“Your hands,” I breathed.  “They… they were cut.  Your hands were all cut up.”

She’d sliced up her hands on a piece of splintered wood.  She smeared blood all over me.  Now, her chubby little hands were untouched and flawless.  

“I’m gonna get punished so much,” she whined.  “But it’s worth it, because I’ve gotta tell you I’m sorry for giving you that nightmare.”

“*Giving* me the nightmare?  What?”

But I knew exactly what she was talking about.  The dream where I spun with my siblings in a field, then felt myself violently torn away.  The morning I’d woken up with paint on my hands and Save the Children scrawled all over my house.  

“My friend Kyle told me I should give a dream to a grown-up,” she said.  “We tried to give the dreams to Bronwyn’s dad, but…”

She squeaked like a mouse caught in a trap.  I felt as though she’d driven the mallet into my stomach.

“Bronwyn?” I repeated, voice trembling.

Winter took a step back, shaking her head, tears bubbling up in her eyes.  

“Winter,” I said firmly, “what happened to Bronwyn?”

Winter stopped.  Then, quick as a flash, she popped her thumb in her mouth, bit down until she bled, and ran at me.  I knelt and caught her around the waist as she smeared a line of blood across my forehead.  Then, she clutched me around my neck and whispered, breath hot, into my ear.  

“Tell Theo I’m sorry.”

Then, she broke away and scampered off.

\*\*\*\*\*

That night, I dreamed I was in a grassy field, skipping around in the sun.  A woman walked beside me.  My mother?  No, this woman was tall and tan like my mom, but her eyes were clear and sparkling and a blissful smile hung on her face.  

“Once upon a time,” she started, her voice musical, “there was a lonely little girl.  She lived in a big house with her grandmother.  But she was never unhappy, because she made friends with the spirits of the air and the sky and the grass and the water.  She and the elementals played all day, and the little girl’s life was magical.  Her favorite was a tree elemental named Septima.  They’d dance and twirl for hours, singing songs and writing poems, before collapsing into the grass in fits of giggles.

As she grew older and older, though, the girl felt the elementals pulling away from her.  Their world was only accessible by children.  Eventually, even Septima refused to speak to her anymore.  The girl grew angry - she refused to be left alone.  So she created a trap.  She caught three elementals and made them be her friends.  Forever and ever.  She grew cruel, forcing her “friends” to act as slaves.  The elementals were imprisoned within human bodies, dependent on human blood for sustenance.  The girl got her comeuppance, though.  Because one day, her red flowers caught on fire, and…”

A scream.  A child’s scream.

I bolted upright in bed.
