I'm a USFS officer. The following story is transcribed from a notebook I found whilst out on a hike. What you're about to read may cause discomfort. My boss told me to dispose of this note so we don't have any copycat offenders trying to find what the victim found. So please, don't be dumb. Stay out of the forest if you're not prepared. Mother nature is a loving mother, but even mothers can't protect their children 100% of the time…..

If you're reading this, it's found me. My fire is dying and I'm out of matches.

This all started innocently enough. I just wanted to go on a hunting trip in honor of my father. He died when I was a young man. Growing up, he would take me hunting and fishing all the time. In his memory, I'd decided to go on a hunting/camping trip. Little did I know that I was the one being hunted. 

Three weeks ago, my tracking Labrador Nikita and I drove out deep into the woods of Hiawatha National Forest in the U.P. I hadn't been hunting in a while, so I used up all my vacation hours, got some sub zero camping gear, made sure my muzzleload rifle was clean, and loaded Kita (Nikita) up into my 2005 Buick Rendezvous. 

When I got to my campsite, it started to snow, this was in mid December for the muzzleloader season. The campsite was pretty remote. It was a 45ish minute drive off the main road. I let Kita out to explore her surroundings and the second she put her nose to the ground to sniff, all the fur from the tip of her nose to the end of her tail stood on end. She froze in place. She started to growl as she stiff legged it back to the car. She jumped in and began to whine. I assumed that she just caught a whiff of a bear or a coyote. She'd never been this deep into any woods before. I thought she just needed to get used to the new smells. 

The first couple week was fine. Kita and I mostly just putzed around the forest enjoying nature. I saw a cute raccoon in a tree, but it didn't want anything to do with us. The weirdness started when the sun began its descent into the night sky. 

While I was out gathering firewood one evening, around dusk, I heard the first whistle. I had no idea what it was but I didn't like it. Kita really didn't like it so we started back to the campsite. While walking back, there was another whistle, a little closer this time. I began to jog. Kita was just stiff as a board trotting alongside me. I could just see the campsite now. The last whistle sounded like it was right behind me. I could practically feel the breath on my neck. I'd burst into a full blown sprint now. Just before I could reach the site, my foot caught on a hidden tree root. An unbelievable pain jolted up my leg. I felt a CRACK in my ankle. I didn't need a medical degree to know that I'd broken something in my ankle or foot. 

That's when I noticed my car. It looked like a bear had gotten into it. The damage looked really bad in the dark. At least one flat tire and broken windows. I hopped in to see if I could start it up. The engine wouldn't turn over. This damned cold was doing a real number on the electrical system in my car. My ankle was gonna have to wait to see a doctor until the next morning. Hopefully it'll warm up enough and I can change the tire and get out of here. 

I managed to get a fire going and I was cooking up yet another hotdog for me to eat while I was nursing my ankle. The fire was bathing me in its warm glow and I fashioned a pretty shoddy splint when all of the sudden Kita’s nose shot straight up. She was looking just past where the light of the fire illuminated the surrounding area. Just past the car. She began to growl deep in her guts. I'd heard her growl before. Like when the mailman dropped off packages at our front door. This was different. This was deeply defensive. A gutterally primal growl as if she were channeling the early domesticated wolves. 

The fire’s heat went cold. As I looked around us, with my hand on my pistol I had brought for defense, what little color there was in this winter wasteland was leached out. Almost as if it were trying to hide itself. Then I heard it. Another whistle. A three part tune that went low-high-low. 

I pulled out my pistol, stood up, and began hobbling towards the direction of the whistle. I figured it wasn't impossible that someone else had found us. During the summer months, this site was really popular with the backpacking community. The snow was crunching and squeaking beneath my feet. I was unbelievably cold. 

When I got to the back of my Rendezvous, I saw the prints that the Whistler left behind. They looked like oversized dog prints, but the toes were too far from the pad. The prints were also webbed. They led off into the woods towards the pond I'd gotten my water to quench the fire from. 

I looked back and the fire was dying. Kita was also desperately trying to get into the tent. I'd concluded that it was time to go to bed. 

I started up the kerosene heater, made sure Kita was covered up, and crawled into my sleeping bag. I kept my pistol always within reach. I popped a couple ibuprofen. The next morning, I was planning on leaving. I'd communed with nature and nature told me to get out. The Whistler had other plans. 

I reassessed the damage to my car in the morning in the hope that I could fix it. I needed to get out of here. The damage was far worse than I could see in the dark. Every tire was slashed. Every window was broken. All my seats were torn to ribbons. The wires under the steering column were all torn out. Whatever had approached us last night, didn't want me to leave. I think the Whistler came back while I was asleep. There was no way I was walking out of here on this bum-ankle. 

I took inventory of my provisions. I had packed enough food to finish the trip, but the Whistler had taken most of it. All of the extra dry wood I had brought that wasn't in the tent with me was gone. I had maybe enough food and wood for one night. Maybe two if I rationed it well. The nearest town was easily 2hrs by car from my location. I was stranded. 

It's been four days since the first encounter with the Whistler. My ankle has swollen five times its usual size. Every night the Whistler torments me. With it's constant Low-High-Low whistles. It thrashes around, breaking branches and throwing them at the tent. It won't come within 20ft from the tent. I think it doesn't like Kita's smell.

I'm running out of kerosene. Kita's breathing has become raspy. Yesterday she came back soaking wet from the direction of the pond. I'm scared she fell through the ice. I shouldn't have let her out of my sight, but she bolted and I couldn't hobble fast enough to catch her. I'm worried she's getting sick. I put one of my hoodies and thermal vests on her. If it weren't for the circumstances, she'd look really cute. Every night the temperature drops. Last night it hit -7°F. I have maybe 3cups of kerosene left. 

It's been one week since the Whistler began our torment. Kita's breathing has only gotten worse. She doesn't get up anymore. She can't even go outside to pee. She just lets it loose in the tent. Every time she does she looks at me with those big sad eyes. She doesn't know any better. I'm not mad at her. I just want her to be comfortable. 

My cell phone died. Not that it was doing me any good. I don't have any service this deep into the woods. I had a satellite phone, but I don't know where it went. I think the Whistler got to it. It's smart. It purposely isolated me. 

I've been reinforcing the tent as best I can. I've made a basic frame of sticks and logs around it. I've been packing snow and pine boughs on them to insulate the tent. I think I saw that on Man vs Wild one time? I'm not sure. The Whistler’s tracks surround my camp. A huge circle now roughly only 15ft from my tent. 

I'm out of kerosene now. Kita and I huddle for warmth. Every now and then I strike a match. Just to feel some warmth. My toes are completely numb and my nose is turning purple. It's getting harder and harder to write. My hands are forgetting how to hold a pencil in this cold. My tears have frozen to my cheeks, and my breath has turned my beard into block of ice. My ankle only feels worse and worse with the cold setting in.  

I woke up this morning and Kita was gone… not gone as in she got out, but rather she died in her sleep last night. Her lungs last night sounded like the crinkling of a paper bag. 

I'm not proud to say this, but I cut her open to feel some warmth. I plunged my hands into her. Star Wars lied to me. There was no warmth to be found in her. Just bloody entrails. I'm sorry Kita. I'm just so hungry. 

I inspected my feet today. They've turned purpley black. My nose no longer feels the cold. Even with all my clothes on, the piercing glacial temps stab into me like a swarm of bees. The thermometer now reads -20°F. Every electron in my body craves warmth. The Whistler is right outside my tent. Low-High-Low whistles bore their way into my ears. I'm gonna try and make the hike tomorrow morning. Screw my ankle. I'm dead either way, right?

That was a horrible idea. I got all turned around looking for the road. Every time I'd get going, I discovered I'd only made one large circle due to favoring my good ankle. On my last attempt I found myself on the pond. The ice cracked and gave way beneath my feet and my whole lower half went into the water. The icey knives of cold and death stabbed into me. I managed to crawl back to my tent. I pulled all of my clothes off and the rest of my clothes outside. I lit them on fire and basked in the warmth. 

The Whistler is looking at me now. His jaws hang open as the Low-High-Low rings from his gullet. His enormous furry body looks so warm. I crave his embrace. His maw is ready to strike. This is the last entry in my journal. He looks so hungry. I'm so cold…..

…..Maybe I shouldn't have posted this. Maybe my boss was right. If you're reading this, I beg you. Don't go into the woods in the winter. At least not alone. And whatever you do, stay warm.
