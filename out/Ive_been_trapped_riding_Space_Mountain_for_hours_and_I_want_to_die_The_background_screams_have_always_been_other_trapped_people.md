These fucking lapbars are inescapable as prescribed by an army of Disney attorneys, no one’s left in line, and 911 won’t connect. Reddit must be functioning through some kind of overlooked loophole, and I’ve been able to type for nineteen different thirteen-second bursts between the ride finishing and starting again.

I’m sorry if this sounds addled. My brain is fried, and every churro I consumed turned to spiral vomit long ago. Most of the people in my car have been unconscious for a while.

It started with that fucking Genie Pass that you buy through the Disneyland app. None of this subsequent insanity would have resulted if it weren’t for my acceptance of that initiating action. 

So I flashed my phone at the entrance to the Lighting Lane and it glowed purple. The damn Disney carney shot a smile and told me that I qualified for the “Club 33 treatment,” whatever the hell that means, and took me through the back channel to get directly onto the car.

Don’t follow carneys into hidden rooms. Why did I have to learn that lesson the hard way?

The first trip was great. Who doesn’t love Space Mountain? We spun and flew around in the dark. My heart was racing when we finished. 

The same Disney carney was grinning at me when we pulled up to the stop. “It’s your lucky day,” he squeaked, and around we went again.

I couldn’t believe my luck when he sent us through a third time, though I was ready to be done after that.

But the Mouse Overlord wasn’t.

The kid in front of me was crying by that point. He was the first to puke. Everyone followed suit eventually. One family had clearly gotten clam chowder at the Royal Street Veranda. An entire fucking family. The smell is unspeakable.

I lucked out by sitting next to an old man. He zonked out within the first ten rides. I think he’s dead. 

I sure wish I were dead. Anything would be better than this horrifying hellscape. I have no idea if anyone will be able to read this, or whether I can trust the clock and calendar on my phone. It could be day or night, because it’s always dark in Space Mountain. 

Thankfully, I’m getting lightheaded. Endless hours of getting spun around on this horrible roller coaster have left me dizzy. I don’t know what they’ll do with my unconscious body, but I’m sure it will be ghastly.

They shut down “It’s a Small World.” Maybe they’re installing it with new victims to power the animatronics because all the old ones died. I’m pretty sure “Rise of the Resistance” closes so often so that they can force-feed everyone who must be trapped in those stationary Storm Trooper displays. I don’t know. The only thing I can say for certain is that I’m in hell. 

Okay, the ride’s starting up again. I don’t think I’ll be able to type coherently much longer. 

If I don’t update, something unspeakably awful has [happened to me](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
