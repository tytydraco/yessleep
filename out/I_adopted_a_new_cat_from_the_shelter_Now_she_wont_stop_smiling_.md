"Kitty is a terrible name for a cat."   
   
Derek popped another fry into his mouth, grinning.

  
"Derek, I named her after my grandma. You know, Kitty, short for Katherine?"

  
"I mean, I get that, but who names their pet after their grandmother?"

  
"She used to collect those little waving cats you see at sushi places, so I thought it was fitting. Besides, plenty of people like to honor their relatives."

  
"Well, whatever floats your boat."

  
It was the first time my friend Derek and I had hung out since I adopted Kitty from the pet shelter. She was a demure little thing, a black and white tuxedo cat that almost blended in with the dull colors of her kennel. She was only a kitten, about 3 weeks old.

  
"She's a little bit low-key," they said. For me, that was perfect. I loved cats, but I couldn't really support a super-high-maintenance one without devoting pretty much all of my free time to them. A cat that just eats, sleeps, and cuddles was more than enough. In that sense, I can't really say it was love at first sight, but she charmed me pretty quickly once I got to know her. The first couple days had gone as expected, with her just trying to figure out the living arrangements. I was hoping that Derek, an experienced cat owner, could give me some pointers once he saw what I set up for her.

  
"You're coming over around 10:00, right?" I asked as Derek munched on another fry.

  
"You got it. I'll be sure to bring some toys for the little missus."

  
I divided out the tip, and we boxed up each of our leftovers to take home later. I was more than ready to hit the hay.

  
The next morning, I awoke to the sound of happy mews in my ear. Turning over, I was met with Kitty's adorable face. Well, it would have been adorable if it wasn't for one thing. Her massive, toothy grin. It wasn't a standard "contented animal" grin, but a sharp-toothed smile with rows upon rows of tiny and vaguely human teeth filling her oral cavity. Her pupils were fully dialated, resembling a pair of black olives more than a cat's eyes. She started nudging me and purring softly, something she had never done in the few days she lived in the house. Although I was a little freaked out, I decided to wait until Derek came instead of calling the vet. For all I knew, this was just the way some cats showed affection.

  
Derek came soon enough, a black to-go box and bag of pet toys in his hands.

  
"Hey, dude! I reheated some of my leftovers from last night, if you want any. Anyway, where's Kitty?"

  
"She's back in my room, I think. I'll go get her."

  
Kitty was indeed in my room, but not where I left her. She was now facing the wall opposite my bed, still grinning. I tapped her on the back to get her attention, but it didn't seem to work. I shook her a little, seeing if that would do the trick. She slowly turned her head toward me, but otherwise remained completely motionless. Out of options, I scooped her up from the floor and carried her into the living room, where Derek was already chowing down on his leftover fries.

  
"There's the little bugger!" he exclaimed.

  
"Uh, Derek, I think something's a little off with her today. She's been a lot more affectionate, but I had a hell of a time trying to get her to move over here."

  
I showed him the smile fixed to her face, and he agreed that it was pretty unnerving. He recommended I take her to the vet, which was sounding more and more like a good idea by this point. Kitty sat there, bemused as always, still staring straight into nothing. I was about to call the whole thing off when she suddenly darted to her cat tower, climbing to the top in a frenzy that she had never displayed before. Derek looked up at her in shock, clearly somewhat relieved. He reached into his toy bag and pulled out a little ball with a feather on it. He threw it across the room, and Kitty immediately gave chase. She batted around the ball as I sighed in relief. Maybe she was fine after all. Derek reached for another fry.

  
"Cats can be stubborn little things. Sometimes they just need a bit of coaxin- Hey!"

  
With unparrelled speed, Kitty launched herself over to Derek's chair and bit onto the fry he was holding. They engaged in a little tug-of-war, with Derek predictably being the victor. He smugly popped the fry in his mouth and continued on.

  
"She's got a lot of spunk. I don't know what they were sayin' about her being low-key. All she needed was some time to adjust."

  
"That's great, Derek, but her smile still creeps me out a little. Are cats supposed to have that many teeth?"

  
"Oh yeah. They're weird as hell. Trust me, I've owned 'em my whole life."

  
We played for a couple more hours before Derek had to go. Hauling his bag of toys behind him, he smirked and gave a wave goodbye.

  
"See you soon, Ian. And you, too, Kitty!"

  
Despite my increased optimism, I still scheduled a vet appointment for the next week, as that grin still hadn't left her face. In the meantime, Kitty was much more energized than before. She insisted on sleeping near me, which was fine at first, until her incessant meowing kept waking me up. She would do it every night at around the same time, so I always knew it was nothing important. I guess she was just trying to bug me. She also kept kneading the blankets with her claws and biting the wool, something she would also always try to do with my arm. Luckily, I sleep on my stomach under heavy covers, so she just kept teething on bedsheets and PJ sleeves instead. Her behavior got so obnoxious that I had to lock her out of my bedroom at night so she wouldn't bother me. During the day, though, her enthusiasm was lovely. It was, by far, the happiest she had ever been. She became super affectionate and would sleep on my lap whenever she could. She actually started using all those toys I bought her, which she never did in those first couple days. Really, it was a double-edged sword.

  
She also started to bring mice into the house. Now, this is obviously a very normal thing for cats to do, but she was much more brutal in her execution. Their insides would be completely clean of their internal organs, leaving behind only bones and a spotless pelt. The eyes were always missing. 

  
Kitty didn't put up a fight when I loaded her into her travel kennel. I sort of assumed all cats hated vet appointments, but she seemed pleased as punch to leave the house. I showed the doctors my predicament, and after exchanging a few worried glances, they agreed that she should be looked at. I handed them her kennel, and they carried it off to one of the various hallways behind the main desk. One of the older doctors peeked in the kennel again and whispered something to the lady at the front desk. 

  
"Should I stay here in the waiting room or go with them?" I asked, pointing to the vet holding Kitty.

  
"Dr. Schmidt says you should stay here for the time being. They're going to give her a basic physical first," the woman responded.

  
So I waited. And waited and waited and waited. I couldn't hear much from the exam room, other than a few hissing sounds and a couple sharp "Ows!". Guess Kitty didn't like the vet after all. I stayed in that damn waiting room for what felt like 4 hours until the doctors came back out again, carrying Kitty in her kennel. Dr. Schmidt was grinning from ear to ear. His hands and neck had little nicks on them, probably from some of Kitty's "love bites".

  
"She's all good. Quite a relief, really. It seems that this problem in her mouth was because of a sore tooth this whole time. If I were you, I'd schedule to get it removed as soon as possible. Other than that, she's completely healthy."

  
"Really?" I replied in disbelief.

  
"Really. You have a wonderful cat, sir. Wonderful."

  
I took the doctor at his word, not being a medical professional myself. I thanked him profusely and went back home, relieved that it was a simple dental issue. Kitty in tow, I went to bed peaceful and satisfied.

  
It was 1:30 a.m. when I heard the scratching at the door. Still groggy, I turned on my bedside lamp, illuminating the bedroom. Nothing. I walked out to the kitchen, expecting to see Kitty. Again, nothing. Peeking out the front window, I was met with the inky embrace of night, but no animals made an appearance. I grabbed my old baseball bat from the closet, just in case some wild animal was trying to get in. It wouldn't do much against a bear, but it was the closest thing in my house to a weapon. The scratching had ceased, which provided some brief comfort. I still couldn't find Kitty, though. Could she have gotten out? I patrolled the living room, looking every which way for a sign of the cat. 

  
"Kitty? Kitty? Come on out, Kitty."

  
To my surprise, I heard a faint meow come from the front yard. Shit. 

  
I ventured outside, bat slung over my shoulder and phone flashlight in hand. I heard another meow, even more distant than before. It sounded like it was coming from the backyard. I trekked around the front of the house, waving the light around in hopes of seeing anything. It bounced back and forth without a clear target until I glanced at a pair of bright blue and unmistakably catlike eyes peeking out from behind a tree.

  
"Kitty?" I whispered, beckoning her towards me. 

  
The eyes ducked behind the tree, completely disappearing from view. I discreetly snuck towards them, hoping to catch the escaped cat off guard. When I reached the trunk, I shined the light on the silhouette I saw before me.

  
It was Kitty, but not as I had left her. Her black and white coat had shed entirely, replaced with wrinkled pink skin reminiscent of a shaved rat. She was absolutely huge, around the size of a cougar, but was so gaunt that she looked a few missed meals away from death. The prickly nails that had once kneaded my blankets were now gnarled, scythe-like claws that bore into the soft earth like hooks. The smile was still there, stretched so wide that it looked painful. Her dialated eyes narrowed into slits when she saw me, turning her head away from the flayed raccoon she had trapped underfoot. Frothing at the mouth, she pounced, knocking me to the ground. She rose a claw up, razor-sharp nails threatening to gore me in a single swipe. With no other option, I reached behind me. Gripping the handle of the bat, I swung it down on her head as hard as I could. Clocking her right in the nodule, her head burst like a water balloon, raining pus and maggots all around me. Getting up, I inspected the damages.

  
The top of Kitty's head was completely open, revealing the remnants of her small brain. A horde of strange-looking worms were crawling all over it, boring in and out of her frontal lobe. Her skin looked extremely thin and delicate, which would explain why popping her head open was so easy. Without warning, her bloated stomach burst open, unleashing a flood of worms and fluid that pooled around my feet. I quickly stepped out of the mess, wiping off any stragglers from my pantleg. Out of curiosity, I extended the bat towards one of the worms, and it crawled onto the blunt end as I had hoped. This afforded me a better look at it. The creature resembled a tapeworm, but with faint black stripes along the body. It had sort of a gelatinous texture and was slightly translucent. It was clear that it was some kind of parasite, but not one I had ever seen before. How the hell did the vet miss it? I thought back to the day before and the way the doctors grinned at me and told me everything was okay. They had seemed so concerned at the beginning and then so unjustifiably confident at the end. The only thing that I heard in between was:

  
"Ow!"

  
If the parasite did something like that to my cat, I couldn't even fathom what it could do to humans. It had already corrupted the doctors' minds, and it transmitted so fast and so easily that their families could have it, too. I racked my brain, trying to think of who else could be infected. Since I got her, the only people that ever met her in person were me, the vet clinic staff, and... Derek. Images flashed through my mind of the day he visited. From what I remember, she never bit him. Either way, I had to check on him. I laid a spare tarp over Kitty's body, murmured a short prayer, and got in the car. On the drive over to Derek's, I replayed the day he came to visit over and over in my head. No bites, no scratches, not even a lick. Then it occurred to me. The fries. The leftover fry from the other day. Kitty bit it, fought him over it.

  
And he won. 

  
Pulling up to his house, I sprinted up the steps and pounded on the front door. No answer. I jiggled the doorknob, and fortunately, he left it unlocked. Derek's living room was nearly pitch black, aside from a single bulb on the ceiling that formed a sort of spotlight in the middle of the floor. In it stood Derek, his back turned to me. His skin was already peeling off, revealing a thick layer of muscle underneath. He drummed his lengthy nails across his leg, already half-grown into claws. I gently stepped backward, my foot colliding with the top step.

  
Derek's head turned sharply, revealing rows of sharp teeth twisted into a wide smile. One eye was glassy and catlike; the other clearly in the process of becoming so.

  
"Ian, my friend. Come in. It is nice and quiet here with my friends."

  
He gestured to the back of the room. One by one, a horde of cats came into view. Their eyes were completely white, and their coats were merely clumps of fur affixed to their pink skin. Smiles. So many fucking smiles. They all gathered and sat behind him, lifeless eyes boring into my soul.

  
I was frozen in place, gripping the doorframe for balance. The cats moved closer. 

  
"You know, Ian, I was wrong."

  
Closer.

  
"Kitty. What a wonderful name for a cat."
