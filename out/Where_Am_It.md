I was sent to this planet on a purely exploratory mission, chartered in response to electromagnetic transmissions that were deemed by the relevant experts to signal some kind of intelligence — not of the inhabitants of the source planet, but of the planet itself.

With a background in astrophysics and cognitive science, I was chosen and sent off to this remote corner of our universe to determine exactly what the nature of this intelligence was.

When I first arrived, stepping off the shuttle into a grey-green atmosphere, rocky, barren, cold, I noticed before anything else a strange tingling sensation at the forefront of my brain — mild, but undeniably present, causing little more than a slight numbing and trivial disorientation.

I moved forward, fully suited, waiting for the nano-componentry to assemble into a pressurized laboratory from which I could begin my investigation.

At last, it completed, and I stepped inside, eager to remove my helmet and shake the cloistering feeling I always felt when trapped inside one of these suits.

The moment my helmet came off, the tingling and numbing grew worse.  I became highly disoriented, not entirely sure where my equipment was or why it was there.  But this lasted only a moment.

Having regained clarity and sense of purpose, I sat at my work station and began noting patterns in the electromagnetic receiver the engineers had set up.  My task was to spot patterns in the incoming signals — drawing patterns from the noise, so to speak — find or contrive new formal patterns into which these patterns fit, and on the basis of these determine what kind of cognitive or celestial architecture we were dealing with here.

It was a task I’d performed many times, and had become so familiar to me now that it’d become almost routine:  spot the patterns, search the literature for formalisms which expressed these, then build a predictive mechanism to map the trajectory of the model under conditions the principal scientists considered most relevant.

Straightforward technical work.  No problem there.

But this time was different.

Every time a pattern emerged from the chaos of the incoming signals, it disappeared, turning back to noise, only for another pattern to emerge at an interval varying in random fashion from the last.

I considered a meta-pattern:  perhaps the change in the patterns was itself an unvarying pattern which could be mapped and predicted.  I tested this theory, and it failed — even the meta-patterns varied wildly, changing in ways indiscernible to the methods I’d mastered, and which had yet been infallible.

For the first time in my experience as a theoretical scientist, I had no idea how to proceed.

I tried meta-patterns of the meta-patterns, up as many levels as my formal skills could accommodate, but still, only randomness and chaos emerged.

But, then, at last, in a wild swing of desperation, I found something.  A syntax I’d never thought of before.

I rushed to write it down, to finally capture this maniacal pattern which had eluded me up to now.  I programmed it into the computer, simulated the conditions which had been given to me, and slumped, exhausted and elated, into my chair as the predictions the model was making unfolded.

The model was correct.  I had to push my capability to the limit, but nonetheless I had succeeded.

And it was here that something strange happened.

The predictions started to fail, and not just slightly, but wildly off the mark.  I slumped again, this time, exhausted but not elated, wondering what could have happened, wondering how my iron-clad model could have so suddenly become obsolete.

I went back to the receiver, to the raw data, to start again.

How long had I been up?  Six weeks, according to the earth calendar on my computer.

And the tingling, it had grown quite intense.  I hadn’t noticed until now, but I was experiencing a surge of activity, hitting in erratic pulses, at the forefront of my brain.

I tried to stand up, but stumbled sideways, catching myself just in time to avoid hitting my face on the cold, metallic floor.

Was it fatigue?

Maybe I should rest.

No such luck.  Every time I tried the tingling in my brain intensified.  I’d just stand up again, walk back to the receiver, eventually find a pattern, model the pattern, make initially successful predictions — and then nothing, chaos, failure.

Then my computer stopped working.

I’d taken for granted the comfort and familiarity the computer had provided:  that familiar screen, that blinking cursor, the time and date displayed stably on the screen, progressing sensibly, predictably.  Information never changed, things unfolded the way they should.

It was the stability which imparted comfort.  And now that was gone.

Now there was only the receiver and my notepad, the edge of chaos.  I feared returning, my weary mind wary at the thought of constant defeat, of every attempt at organization failing.

At the thought that this planet was not only intelligent — it was *playing* with me.

Unable to look at that receiver any longer, I jerked away from my station, preferring a seat against a corner on the floor.  My head throbbed, not painful, but profoundly tired, at the precipice of failure, of intellectual defeat.  For the first time, I’d actually considered giving up.  This was too hard.  On earth things are stable — hidden, elusive, but ultimately driven by a design buried in the space between its parts, in the rhythm of its process — but not here.

Here, the design itself was chaos, the hidden pattern not a pattern at all, but…

I was never really able to say.

I decided to radio home, to end this mission early and head back to familiarity.  An aborted mission would mar my perfect record, but I couldn’t take it anymore.  I needed desperately for *something* to make sense.

The computer was dead, but the transmission lines still worked.  I dialed in my supervisor, eager to hear a human voice.

He answered.  I spoke.  He responded like he couldn’t understand.

I spoke again, feeling frantic.

He responded quizzically, with dreadful concern.  I could hear him calling for help, asking an assistant to charter a rescue mission as soon as he could.

And then, out of nowhere, I said, with no intention whatsoever of doing so — No problem, Dr. Matheson.  It’s okay here.  Just a little tired, that’s all.

And then I hung up.

Why the *hell* had I done that?

This tingling, it’s really getting…

I can’t think right.

The receiver, I was studying patterns on the receiver, but I look at it, it gives me such a headache.

Where is…?

I fall to the ground, my head buzzing, the dissonance unbearable.

I keep trying to remember where I am, what’s happening.  I grasp in the depths of memory, but there’s nothing, like I’m clutching blindly at the air.

The moment a thought emerges, it is gone.  Just like that.  No patterns, no coherence.

I cling momentarily to the thought that I *had* discerned those patterns, that they *were* there, but then…

Had the planet *planted* them?

Were those just quick fixes, surges of dopamine to keep me trying, grasping desperately for something that was never there?

“Planet” and “plant” are almost the same word.

That’s not what I was thinking!

Were those patterns ever really there?  Like a chess master hustling games, feigning incompetence only to strike with a grandmaster’s might when the moment’s right, did this planet *feed* me intelligence, *feed* me data, only to keep me playing long enough to…

To what?  To do what?

What were its designs?  Did it have any?

What could this massive intelligence possibly have to gain?

What was the endgame here?

Oh, wait!  Endgames are rational.  Endgames are a pattern.  Thinking with patterns, trying to predict, only wastes me here.  The real strategy…

There can’t be one.  No strategy, no logic.

An intelligence without strategy or logic.

That’s it!  I have to think irrationally.  To not make sense.

But even that…!

Even that is rational.

I jerk my head up, my mind worn to nothing, eager to indulge in the sensory pleasures of a strange new world.

But it’s gone.  The grey-green atmosphere, the bare, dusty rocks… gone.  What’s there is…

My words are failing me.  I see, but I can’t… *see*.

That doesn’t make sense.

I see, but…

I don’t see.

See.  *See*.

I mumble the words, but they don’t… mean anything.

I wumble the merds…

But meaning anything.

A rocky brain, data patterns with no patterns.

I call for help, but…

I just awoke on some dusty planet.  My room has clear windows and the floor is really cold.

Did I black out again?

Or did I black in?

Back in!

I’m back in the room where the dustbins planet with brain patterns with no patterns never die.

What am it?
