My first week of investigation is coming to an end, I don’t know how many I have left. Maybe I’m just being paranoid, but I think someone, or something is out there. The damage inflicted on these cats is far beyond any suggestion of illness or mistreatment. Regardless of Ida’s signs of dementia pointed out by a commenter, Ida loved her cat through and through and nothing would prevent her from giving her the life all cats would dream of.

The weekend proved more difficult than I thought. Innocent questions made by my parents as to where I was going began to demand a need for me to provide a valid reason for whatever venture I would take out of the house. I tried once to leave the house telling my parents that I was going to go to the shop down the street for some chocolate but the kindness of my father insisting on giving me a ride proved rather cruel to my actual plans. I didn’t have many attempts since then after having to endure my father’s interrogation about interests in girls and drinking at university the entire drive. Despite this, I made the most of the resources made available to me. The most prominent one is the Village’s Facebook Community Group Chat.

If any of you are from or still live in a village, there should be no need for me to explain the dread I felt when I joined. For those of you who don’t know, the notorious “Village Group Chat” is where your honest, hardworking, average Joe goes to die. There's posts about anything and everything. Your neighbour’s left the bin out for a whole day? There are posts about that. Your neighbours playing music a single decimal over what you consider to be too loud? Yes, there’s posts about that. Everyone is a defendant in the court of the village group chat, plead your case or face shame in front of everyone online. The image chosen for the group chat logo was from the woods which surrounded our village, the bio reading “Quality is not the first thing, it is on the only thing. Make your community a place worth living.” Unfortunately, my belief that this gold mine of complaints would lead me further in my investigation was short lived. No matter how I filter the posts, there is no mention of the cats and how they are yet to be moved. Even if there was it would be hard to find in the sea of complaints about neighbours and noises in the middle of the night waking people up along with the odd advertisement thrown into the mix.   

When the knock came at the door, I was more relieved than annoyed that I had a reason to stop scrolling through the twelfth post about Mr Robinson leaving his bin out after collection day.

“Package for….Mr Green?”

“David?”

The postman looked up from his phone.

“James? Man it’s been years! I heard you left for university.”

“Yeah, yeah, it’s been a minute. You’re a postman now?

“Not my first choice, but you know it’s better than nothing. The pays bad but I feel good helping the community.”

“Yeah, but I thought you of all people would have left for study too. You were top of the class, your future had more to offer than this.”

“That’s true but you know better than most the cost which comes with being a student. My family aren’t as well-off James, no chance of scholarship or student loans would keep me afloat for long.”

“Man, I’m sorry. I never knew.”

“Its in the past. Like I said it isn’t much, but I enjoy what I do and if my memory serves correct, you even said you wanted to be a postman on careers day a few years back.”

I laughed.

“Yeah, and Mat said his dream in life was to work in a drive-thru. He told me afterwards that he wanted to because he’d apparently get all the free food he wanted. I bet it was a shock when he found out, he would have had to have paid like everyone else.”

We both laughed.

“How is Mat anyway? You deliver post to him as well?”

“Mat? I’m not so sure”

“Not so sure?”

“I heard a few years ago that he’d gotten himself a nasty habit”

“What kind of habit?”

“Drugs. Yeah, I heard it didn’t end well”

“Mat? Really?”

“Positive, if you ask me, he- Hey, Hey! Get away from there!”

As David turned what came in to view was a scene that truly broke my heart. Three kids were all standing around Luna’s body, the oldest prodding her head with a stick as it rolled back in to place after each jab. David broke into a sprint barrelling towards the kids snatching the stick from their hands.

“Don’t. Don’t ever do that! Get out of here!”

Desperately spinning and waving the stick to and fro as the kids ran in fear.

“Hello?”

She appeared almost out of thin air. Ida, standing on her drive inches away from David.

“I- I-  I didn’t- I’m”

David dropped the stick as he ran to his van leaving a cloud of smoke in the air as he drove away. I thought his behaviour was strange, but David was never good with confrontation growing up. Perhaps he never grew out of it. From our brief conversation however, the fate of Mat stuck in my mind as I searched social media for a trace. Mathew Plummer had been essentially wiped from the face of the earth. All accounts, if ever there were any, were deleted. Timothee Mathew Plummer had been missing for 2 years. I didn’t believe the report when I read it. For one I was shocked that Mat’s name was in fact Tim, and had hidden it all these years, and was even more taken aback by the fact I didn’t know my friend was gone. I grew up with him. Told secrets to him. I promised him with all the effort a 14-year-old could that he would be my best man at my wedding when I was older. I believed we had just fallen out of touch, but the reality that Mat had fallen out of the realm of substance stuck in me like a knife. I decided to look back at the Village Group Chat and filtered my search to “Timothee Mathew Plummer”. What appeared was an advertisement with a single comment beneath it.

I don’t know what to make of the comment, but Tim’s plumbing service isn’t as reliable as they made it out to be. 0.5 stars and reviews complaining that their calls remained unanswered has likely resulted in the reason why “Tim’s Plumbing Service” is no longer around.  Come to think of it, all the advertisements on this page have been dragged through the dirt of 1-star reviews but they all have something else in common. If there was only one or many, there was always an anonymous comment like the one above. Abandoning my search I went to bed. There wasn’t a single sound that night, no meow, no nothing. I only realise now why that might have been.

David Cook was dead. Discovered in his home this morning by his mother who let herself in with a spare key, police and journalists were quick to dispatch. I thought my heart couldn’t break anymore, but this completely shattered it. Police were reportedly quick to leave the house upon entering and I can’t help but wonder if Davis is in a similar state as the cats. Before any of you ask, I checked the village group chat for any more of these advertisements or comments afterward and no there is no other post except the ever-going complaint of Mr Robinson’s bin being left out. If these comments are in any way linked to Mat and any other case I’m yet to encounter, then the death of David was clearly unplanned.

I’m sorry for the short update but as I mentioned previously there isn’t much I can do over the weekend with my parents in the way. I’ll update again soon, thank you to those who continue to share these posts and please pray for my safety.
