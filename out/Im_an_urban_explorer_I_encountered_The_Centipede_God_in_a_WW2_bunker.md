I’ve always loved urban exploration.  

The thrill of exploring places that no one has set foot in for a long time, finding strange and cool things, it all started when I was a tween, going through sewer tunnels and going into construction sites. 

But after what happened last night… 

 I don’t think I’ll ever go urban exploring again.

Summer break of my senior year, I had an extra six hours in my days to go around my state in a shitty Nissan, taking videos and searching for a greater 'high' each time I ventured into a tunnel, building, factory, or junkyard. 

The place I was planning to go to was an old WW2-era ‘bunker’ in the middle of the Tennessee forest, deep in the Appalachians. The place had been discovered by some construction workers a couple of years ago, most likely built during WW2 by preppers in fear of the war spreading. I had seen some pictures and videos taken by fellow explorers, and there was a large, steel wheel-winded cover, and a deep tunnel with a ladder leading into the main bunker, filled with expired food, graffiti, and survival equipment. 

I loaded up my backpack with my gear, slid on my balaclava, and tucked my pistol into my waistband before I arrived to the coordinates, and began to walk off-trail in the mountains, in search of the bunker built in the middle of the forest. It took a while to find it, but eventually, I found a large clearing, with a large fence and a 'do not enter' sign surrounding a protruding steel tunnel entrance going deep into the ground. 

I grinned in anticipation as I opened it and climbed down the ladder, I reached into my backpack and pulled out my flashlight. 

Turning it on, I jumped off the ladder and onto the dusty floor, the living room of the old underground house looked exactly like how I expected. A fine layer of dust covered every surface, cobwebs hung from the walls, and the furniture was old, there was a network of tunnels and small rooms, and I planned on exploring them one by one. 

As I entered the first room, I noticed something strange. My sense of adventure turned into dread as I looked around the room, which was a storage room, filled with age-old rations, water, and military equipment. The walls were coated in a very thin layer of an orange substance, oozing down and onto the floor. 

It wasn’t moving or anything, but it was strange on its own. Thinking that there was nothing to see, I turned and headed for the door. But as I exited the room, I caught a glimpse of something strange. Under the blankets on a folding cot… something appeared to be moving under them. Both curious and intrigued, I walked into the room and poked the hidden moving lump with a broomstick, holding my breath as I held my flashlight steady. 

Then, I lifted the blankets off the bed, and I was greeted with a horrible and terrifying sight. In the middle of the bed mattress, a huge rotting mass covered in the orange slime pulsated and squirmed. 

Hundreds of house centipedes and earwigs were all on top of the mass, wriggling and crawling all over it. 

But as soon as I lifted the worn-out blankets, the bugs all began to crawl off the bed and onto the carpeted floor. I screamed out of terror and disgust, recoiling as the bugs swarmed onto the floor. The rotting orange mass in the middle of the mattress the size of a table seemed to be alive… it slowly moved towards me. Beneath that mass, as if it was the molting shell of another organism, something crawled and slithered before emerging. 

I called it the Centipede God.

It was at least nine feet long, its body plated and resembling a massive jungle centipede, with thousands of long, skittering legs and tendrils snaking from its body. I saw the face of the Centipede God, a gigantic version of a centipede’s head but with a hinged jaw filled with rows of sharp teeth and dozens of mandibles surrounding it. It had dozens of tiny, pupiless white eyes that spun and stared directly at us as its antenna and appendages writhe and squirm in the air. It emitted this dark red glow, which may have been either bio luminescent or supernatural, pulsing as I slowly backed away.

***"K'lah Tegothlku... will rise again."***

The creature suddenly spat a mouthful of that slimy orange substance all over my clothes and skin, snapping me back to reality as I gasped and stared at the horror. 

"Fuck!!" I yelled, turning tail and running as I tried to pull out the pistol I had bought from the school's drug dealer a few months ago.

I pulled it out, remembering how to turn off the safety as I pointed it at the Centipede God, closing my eyes and finger-fucking the gun, emptying the entire magazine before I opened my eyes and continued running for the ladder. The creature was still, not moving an inch as I spotted a tiny trickle of blood drip from the single wound I had caused, right in the side of its jaw. It seemed unbothered, but intrigued by the sensation, as if it has never felt pain in its life. 

I wasted no time getting out of there, I ran out of the room and I quickly crawled up the ladder, slamming the bunker door shut and running for my life down the mountain, eventually finding the dirt road I had parked in. After I sped home and was in my room, on my computer and trying to tell every online forum I could of the experience, I felt something moving under my pants leg. 

I reached into my pants leg, pulled the object out, and nearly passed out.

It was a centipede exactly resembling the ones I had seen in the bunker, as thin as a pencil and wide as my [fucking arm.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/mjn4ot/the_complete_seaside_trilogytimeline_in_order/)
