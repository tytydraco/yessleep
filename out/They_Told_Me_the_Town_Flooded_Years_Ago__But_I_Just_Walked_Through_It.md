I hadn’t been back to my hometown in over thirty years.
After my mother died, there wasn’t much reason to — she’d been the last thing tying me there.

But when I saw the headline — “Thirty Years Since The Greenvale Flood” — something twisted inside me.

I don’t know why I did it, but that same weekend, I got in my car and drove back.



The highway was longer than I remembered, and for the last twenty miles, there were no other cars.
Just empty stretches of road, lined with trees that felt too still.

When I finally reached the turnoff, the old “Welcome to Greenvale” sign was still standing, leaning to one side.
Someone had spray-painted over it: CLOSED AREA – KEEP OUT.

But the road beyond looked fine.
Not washed out, not collapsed — just… forgotten.

I expected ruins.
What I found was home.



The houses stood exactly where I remembered them.
Same cracked sidewalks, same lampposts.
The gas station on the corner still had the faded sign for 79¢ coffee.

But what made me stop was the people.

There were people.

An old man mowing his lawn.
A woman hanging clothes to dry.
A kid riding a bike past me — the same model I had when I was ten.

I slowed down, rolled my window down.
“Hey,” I called out to the man mowing. “Is this… Greenvale?”

He cut the mower’s engine and looked at me like I’d asked if water was wet.
“Of course it is.”

Then he smiled politely and went back to mowing.



I parked near my old street.
The pavement was cracked but familiar.
I half-expected to see the treehouse my brother and I built behind our yard.

And when I walked down the block — I did.

Same wood. Same rope ladder. Even the initials carved in the trunk: D + M, 1989.

I reached out and touched them. The wood was dry, but the letters felt freshly cut.

A chill ran through me.



My old house looked untouched.
Paint a little faded, curtains still hanging in the same place.

Someone was inside.

Through the window, I saw movement — a woman walking through the kitchen.
For a second, I thought maybe someone new had moved in.

Then she turned her head slightly, and I froze.

It was my mother.

Not older, not changed — exactly as I remembered her in 1994.

I stepped back, heart pounding. The screen door creaked open, and she stepped out, wiping her hands on a towel.

“Danny?” she said softly. “What are you doing out here?”

Her voice — I swear to God — was real.

I couldn’t speak.

She frowned a little. “You look pale. Come inside, dear.”



I followed her in.
The smell hit me instantly — coffee and lavender detergent.
Everything was in its place. The same furniture, the same tablecloth, even the same photo of Dad on the mantel.

“I thought—” I started.

She turned to me, smiling faintly. “You thought what?”

“I thought you…” I couldn’t finish the sentence.

She smiled again, poured me a cup of coffee, and said, “You should rest. You’ve been gone a long time.”

I sat down, shaking.
Everything felt real — too real.



After a while, I went outside to get some air.
The street was quiet, the air heavy with that thick, pre-storm humidity.

Down the road, I saw someone standing by the old town square — a man about my age, wearing a tan jacket.

He waved me over.

When I got closer, I realized he looked familiar.
I couldn’t place him until he spoke.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he said.

“What do you mean?”

His eyes darted to the houses around us.
“It’s not what it looks like. They don’t move on here. They just stay the way they were.”

I swallowed hard. “Who are you?”

He hesitated, then said, “You were in my class. Fielding. Marcus Fielding.”

The name hit me like ice.
Marcus had lived two streets over.
He’d drowned in the flood trying to save his sister.

But there he was. Standing in front of me.



I must’ve gone pale, because he said, “You really don’t remember, do you?”

“Remember what?”

He pointed toward the riverbed.
“None of this should exist. The water took everything.”

I followed his gaze.
From here, I could still see the church steeple, the houses, the quiet streets.
Everything was still and perfect — like a photograph frozen in time.

Marcus sighed. “You didn’t make it out either, Dan.”

I laughed — a shaky, hollow sound. “I’m right here.”

He shook his head. “So am I.”



When I looked back toward the houses, the lights were on in every window — glowing warm, yellow, steady.

But no one was moving inside.
The shapes behind the curtains were still.

“Don’t let them talk to you again,” Marcus said quietly.
“Once you believe it, you stay.”

And then he was gone.

Not vanished — just… gone, like he’d never been there.



I ran back to the house.
The front door was open.
The TV was playing softly — a weather broadcast from decades ago.

“Residents are advised to evacuate immediately as water levels rise…”

The image flickered.

My mother was sitting in her chair, staring at the static screen.

“Mom,” I said, voice shaking.

She turned to me, her eyes blank, unfocused.
“Dinner’s almost ready,” she said. “Your brother’s still outside.”

Her voice trembled, like an old recording.



I stumbled out into the yard.
The air felt thicker now, and the smell — not lavender anymore, but mold and river silt.

Down the street, water shimmered at the intersection.
At first I thought it was rainwater. Then I realized it was spreading — slow, steady, reflecting the yellow lights.

I ran to my car, started the engine, and turned toward the main road.

But the sign was gone.
The road curved endlessly through fog.

The radio crackled — then came a voice.
Mine.

> “You shouldn’t be here.”





I don’t remember how I got out.
I woke up the next morning on the side of the highway, thirty miles from Greenvale.
My car was parked on the shoulder, keys still in the ignition.

I tried to drive back, but the turnoff wasn’t there.
The trees were thicker. The road freshly paved.

I asked a gas station attendant about Greenvale.

He frowned. “That’s the place that flooded, right? Back in ’94? Whole town went under. They built a reservoir over it.”

He pointed toward the valley.
“You can still see the church steeple when the water’s low.”

I drove there.

He was right.
The steeple was there — rusted, barely visible through the surface.

And near the edge of the memorial plaque, half-buried in moss, I found it.

My name.

Daniel

I touched it. The metal was cold.
And for a moment — just a moment — I swore I could hear someone calling me home.
