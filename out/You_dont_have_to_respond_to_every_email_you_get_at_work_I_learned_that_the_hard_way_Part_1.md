I work for an animal removal company in Atlanta. A few weeks ago, I received this bat-shit insane email:

*Calling All Wildlife Warriors!*

*I recently came across some glowing reviews of your company and I would love to ask you for a quote for your services.*

*This is a bit unorthodox and you may not want to accept this offer at first, but if you are the fearless animal removal experts that the reviews paint you to be (and I wholeheartedly believe you are) then you’ll accept the challenge that I am about to set before you.*

*I have it on very good authority that there is a Sasquatch in the North Georgia mountains.*

*I know, you think I’m crazy, but my cousin Eli has seen it first hand, not once, but twice. Damn near scared him half to death.*

*Now, Eli and I have been talking and he thinks he has a pretty good idea on where this thing has been living. You might want to ask me where, but I won’t give you that information now, because I don’t want you to run up there and bag and tag this monster without me.*

*The plan is to capture the beast alive. If push comes to shove and the beast has murder in its heart, well, we may have to shoot him. I’m not sure how aggressive these things are, but I’ve never seen a news report of someone being slain by a sasquatch, so I assume they aren’t overly unfriendly.*

*The only obstacle Eli and I are facing is our lack of animal handling skills. I don’t even have a pet dog and Eli really only traps squirrels and neither of us believes that talent will have much overlap with bigfoot hunting.*

*That is where the seasoned professionals come in. I’m talking about you.*

*I know this is a lot to ask a common man, but maybe you aren’t so common after all. Maybe you are destined for greatness, like Eli and myself are.*

*You would have to provide some traps, bindings and maybe some treats for the animal as well as your general knowledge of wildlife.*

*Eli has already volunteered to be bait and we have both agreed that on the off-chance the sasquatch has a grasp of the English language that I should be the one to speak on behalf of our party.*

*Eli and I will both be chipping in to pay a handsome day rate. I expect this will take 3-4 days. One of which will be plotting and strategizing up at Eli’s house.*

*However, in the event of my death or Eli’s death at the hands of the ‘Squatch total pay will be reduced by 50-100% (depending on if one or both of us die).*

*Think of the possibilities.*

*Be a part of the team that made history. Have your name etched in stone among mankind’s greatest heroes. “Buzz Aldrin, Julius Ceasar, Eli Tebbetts, Ross Tebbetts, INSERT YOUR NAME HERE, and Jesus Christ”*

*Not to mention the effect this could have on your business. If you can handle a Sasquatch then people are going to have no problem paying top dollar for raccoon removal. Heck, I’m sure people will hire you just to have you come out and shake their hand!*

*Please get back to us soon as we aren’t sure if this beast is migratory and we do not want to miss our chance at history!*

*Sincerely,*

*Ross Tebbetts*

I know, its insane, but it was too damn funny not follow-up on. I had to at least find out what they were paying, so I sent an email back saying I was interested, but I needed more details before I could clear my schedule.

A few days later I got another email from Ross detailing what they would need, (Bear traps, predator urine to hide our scent, a deer stand, rope, bear mace, a sleeping bag, snares, a snare pole, and a winning attitude) and what they would be paying ($650 a day). I had most of the equipment already and could pick up with rest with an afternoon of running errands and I had found the winning attitude as soon as I saw how much they were paying.

I emailed him back agreeing to the job.

2 days later I was in the North Georgia mountains wondering if this was going to be easy money or if two meth heads named Eli and Ross were going to kill me and wear my skin as a raincoat. I was really hoping for easy money.

Eli’s cabin was a small wooden shack near the Georgia-North Carolina border. The two cousins greeted me as I pulled in.

Ross was short, pudgy and had oily slicked back hair. He was also manic. Talking a mile-a-minute asking how my drive was, beautiful the forecast was for the week and how we were going to ‘make history’. He peppered every conversation with quotes about the concepts of success and greatness. “Some are born great. Some achieve greatness. Some get it as a graduation gift. Robin Williams said that. We’re going to achieve greatness this weekend I’ll tell you that much” and “Theodore Roosevelt once said, ‘It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed’ and you know what? I always say that too” Ross was incredibly annoying. I’m not going to lie.

Eli on the other hand could not have been more different from his cousin. He was older with leathery, sun-damaged skin and was going grey on the sides of his head. He rarely spoke and when he did it was mostly in short, declarative statements like, “Yeah” or “Nah” or less often some strange Southern platitudes such as, “Ross, you ain’t got the sense that God gave a goose” or “I reckon that ‘Squatch’ll be madder than a wet hen”

This was going to be a long 3 (or 4) days.

The first night was spent “Plottin’ and strategizing” as Ross said. The thrust of their brilliant plan was this: Eli would somehow draw it out of the cave he suspected it was hiding in. If the monster by some ridiculous fucking miracle knew English then Ross would…reason with it? Convince it to let us take it captive? I don’t know. As dumb as this guy was, I had to admire his confidence.

In the event the Sasquatch was lured into the open and it did not possess a firm grasp of English then I had been instructed to “Do my thing”.

Incredible minds hatch incredible plans.

Ross ended our planning session with another quote, “Never was anything great achieved without danger. Niccolo Machiavelli said that”.

I had to keep thinking about the money to stop myself from thinking how stupid this entire situation was.

That night we all slept in the one-room cabin. There was only one bed, so I took a sleeping bag on the ground, Ross took the bed and Eli sat in a chair near a window and slowly sipped moonshine the entire night. I don’t think he slept. As I said before, he rarely spoke but his eyes said enough in this instance. He was scared. A times I caught a tremble in his hand as he brought his cup to his lips.

That was the first time I thought, if only for a moment, these guys might not be so crazy.

The next morning, we set off. I carried an assortment of traps, lures, snares and sprays. Ross carried camping gear. Eli carried provisions and a shotgun that I was hyper aware of at all times.

We hiked the entire day without much luck. Periodically Ross would stop the group and let loose one of his “bigfoot calls” which sounded a lot like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the midst of an orgasm.

About two hours before nightfall, we decided to stop and set up camp for the night. We dropped our bags and started making camp when we heard a ruckus from deeper in forest.

Ross held his finger to his lips to urge silence. I raised my snare pole in readiness and Eli levelled the shotgun at the bushes. The disturbance grew louder and louder. Bushes shook and a sharp coughing sound punctuated the otherwise silent forest until what looked like a gorilla burst from the foliage and ran directly towards us.

“FREEZE!” Shouted Eli, gun at the ready.

The gorilla instantly stopped dead in it’s tracks and its hands shot up in the air, “DON’T SHOOT!” it yelled.

“I fuckin’ knew it would speak English!” Ross sauntered forward with one hand extended in a show of peace, with his other hand he slowly pulled a pair of handcuffs out of his back pocket and kept them hidden behind his back, “We mean you no harm, O, Great One of the Wood”

The gorilla ripped off his own face. Revealing a man underneath who looked directly at me, “Brad?!”

You ever go on a faraway vacation and run into your neighbor walking down the beach? This was a lot like that. Just replace “vacation” with “Bigfoot Hunt” and “Neighbor” with “My biggest competitor”

“Kenny, what the fuck?!” I dropped the snare pole and walked over to him, “I know this guy”

Then another voice from the trees above us, “Ah hell Kenny, what did I say?! NEVER take that mask off!” Another man was sitting in a tree stand about 30 feet above our heads, “The damn ‘Squatch could be watching us right this instant and you done blew your disguise!”

Now it was Eli and Ross’ turn to be surprised as they turned and saw the man in the tree, “Milton!?”

Ross turned to Eli, red-faced, and jabbed him in the chest with his finger, “I told you not to tell anyone else about this, Eli!” Now he pointed the finger up at Milton sitting in the tree, “and now we have competitors!”

Now Eli, showing emotion for the first time since I met him pointed up at Milton and yelled, “you said you didn’t believe me! You said even if it was true, we should leave it alone! Annnnd”, Eli wheeled around and looked Kenny who was now peeling off his gorilla costume, “you promised you wouldn’t tell nobody else.”

Milton stared back down at us from his perch, “Yeah, well,” He leaned forward and spit on the ground below him, his saliva was dark, thick and stank of chewing tobacco, “I lied”.

More movement from the bushes drew our attention and another man burst into the campsite from the treeline.

“Boyd!” Ross and Eli shouted in unison.

“Milton, how many people did you tell? We got half of Fannin County out here!” Ross demanded.

We all camped together that night. Turns out Milton and Boyd were barflies who Eli would get drunk with on occasion. A week or so ago, Eli had gotten a bit too drunk and spilled the beans about the sasquatch and how him and his cousin would catch it and become rich and famous overnight. Rich and famous was too good for Milton to pass up, no matter how outlandish the idea was. Only thing was, he didn’t want to split the money with Eli and Ross, so he got his own animal control expert and tried to catch the beast before Eli and Ross could get to it. Boyd was only allowed to tag along because he was too dumb to ask for money and would do pretty much anything Milton told him to do and Milton figured this would be a good time to have someone like that by his side.

While Ross, Eli and Milton were in their own world talking about redneck things and Boyd was off collecting firewood, I leaned over to Kenny and asked him how much he’s getting paid.

“You’re getting paid?”, he asked, “I’m getting fucking blackmailed.”

I didn’t ask him anymore questions.

Eli, Ross and I climbed into our way-too-small tent and tried to get some shut eye. I definitely would have preferred to have slept outside if the mosquitos weren’t so bad. Sharing a tent with those two was hell on earth. Not that any of us got much sleep.

At least I wasn’t in the tent with Milton, Boyd and Kenny. I could smell Milton and Boyd from outside of their tent. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like inside.

Not long after we put the fire out, the smell showed up. A thick choking odor. A mixture of rotting meat, skunk and wet dog. The noxious fumes came so suddenly both tents erupted into hysterics blaming one-another for passing gas.

The arguments were truncated by what followed: a series of loud, ape-like whoops echoed through the forest around us bouncing off the trees and cliffsides. None of us could tell which direction the sound originated from. It could have been a mile from us, it could have been just outside of the light of our dying fire.

Then the noises changed. They grew louder and more pronounced as if the creature making them reveled in the terror it brought to our campsite. Whatever it was, it came closer. It clawed at tree trunks emitting sharp scratching sounds that made my spine tingle, then moved on to low guttural growls that vibrated through the ground.

The unseen creature seemed to possess and otherworldly intelligence, teasing us with its presence. It mimicked the calls of nocturnal animals, creating a chilling symphony of imitation.

Ross, Eli and I exchanged bewildered glances, unable to comprehend the nature of the entity that lurked just outside the reach of our campfire’s light.

Suddenly, the creature’s repertoire shifted, morphing into a cacophony of unsettling sounds. The forest reverberated with high-pitched screeches that sent our hands to our ears, then shifted again to the screams of a wounded animal, then again to a series of eerie laughter echoing off into the distance.

Then silence.

I heard the other tent unzip their flap, then I heard Milton say, “Get out there and put a few more logs on the fire, you don’t want this thing sneak up on us in the dark, do you?”

A moment later, Boyd emerged from the tent. He hurriedly gathered a few pieces of nearby firewood and gently, but quickly, placed them around the embers of the fire as to not smother it. All of us silently watched him from our tents. Then we heard a new noise.

A quicky, breathy whistle cut the silence for just a moment then, a sickening crack as a fist sized rock struck Boyd in the back of the head. He crumpled instantly in a heap next to the fire, his arms and legs twitching in a sick rhythm. The rock that felled him was still embedded in the back of his skull.

The laughter again boomed through the forest and fear once again rippled through our group. Our imaginations conjuring nightmarish visions of a monstrous entity just beyond our ability to see. My heart raced, my breath ran shallow and my mouth grew dry.

The creature grew bolder and moved closer to our campsite. It rattled trees and snapped branches causing them to sway and creak in haunting motions. For the first time, we heard the heavy footfalls of the creature as it ran circles around our campsite whooping and pulling down limbs.

The logs Boyd placed in the campfire began to light and the fire grew from embers to a healthy flame and continued to grow.

As the fire grew and our radius of light grew with it, the creature in the forest seemed to back off. We no longer heard the footsteps. The laughter seemed further away. The whoops and yells stopped. Then, finally, the horrid rotten smell dissipated.

Still, no one moved. No one spoke. Not even when an ember from the campfire jumped onto Boyd’s back and caught his shirt ablaze. We didn’t move when the fire spread to his greasy hair.  We all sat in silence and watched him burn. What had I gotten myself into?
