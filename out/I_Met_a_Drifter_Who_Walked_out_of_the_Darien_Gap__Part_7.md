Panic can be defined pretty well by most people.

That feeling when you miss a step on a set of stairs, or when you turn a corner and see someone right in front of you.

But there’s an eerie, unknown sort of sense of panic when you watch a uniformed person with devious intent on their face dragging a folding chair and a bucket up from the lower decks. 

My stomach sank as I turned to Junior, who’s eyes were wide as saucers.  A tear leaked from his eye as he appeared utterly paralyzed by what he saw before him.

I was well aware of what those two things might have meant.  Of course, the fact that a rope was produced, as well as a thick canvas cloth, drove the point home.

“Fill ‘er up, Frida,” Sigrid said with an otherworldly sense of satisfaction, “I’m getting twitchy.” 

Frida attached the bucket to the rope, and tossed it overboard.

Sigrid approached me, picking me up from the rest of the crew.

We had our hands tied behind our backs, and knelt in a line on the deck.

All the while Sigrid’s ship had come around and tied mooring lines to ‘The Baron’.  Now towing us through the gulf, likely towards Cuba.  Specifically I assumed our port of call had changed from Antila to Gitmo.

Still, I was dreading the next few moments more than the final destination as I was led over to the chair.

“I’m not going to lie, I’ve never done this to a missionary before,” Sigrid said with a sly grin, “I wonder, will you be praying for mercy?  When it doesn’t come, will your faith fail you?  Oh, this is going to be *so* interesting.”

“You don't have to do this,” I pleaded, “Certainly you can’t!  Think of the ethics, we’ve done nothing wrong!” I begged.

Sigrid’s grin grew larger and I swear I could see nothing behind her eyes but abject and complete darkness, “I know.  You’re so innocent…” Sigrid licked her lips, “But everyone hides something.  What will you tell me, just to get the suffering to end?  Your deepest, darkest sins…?  Things you’ve not even spoken to your *God*.”

My stomach dropped further as I saw Frida return with the water bucket.

Sigrid took it, grinning wide as Frida turned from Sigrid.

“Captain, if there is nothing else, may I assist Thea in searching for the stowaway?” Frida asked.

“Fine, but keep an ear out,” Sigrid barked, before her attention turned to me again.  She twisted the canvas cloth easily into a loop, holding the edges with one hand, the bucket in another, “Now then, missionary, let's play a game?  I’m going to ask you some questions, and if I don’t like the answer…” Sigrid’s eyes took on a downright demonic presence, “Well, I don’t want to spoil the surprise.”

I tried to push myself up from the folding chair, only to get a knee to the gut.

I gasped for a moment before I felt the canvas pressed hard over my face.  As I attempted to breathe in, the water came.

It felt like my head was plunged into the sea, and despite that I gasped for breath.  I choked and sputtered as drops of water made it through the canvas and into my lungs.  I heaved and struggled, but Sigrid kept her leg hard against my thigh, pinning me to the chair as I flailed about uselessly in the chair.

Mercifully, the tournament stopped.  I gasped for air, heaving and coughing deeply as my lungs burned.

“How long did that feel, missionary?” Sigrid said with a vicious grin, “It was only a few seconds.  It must have felt like an eternity…” she taunted.

I felt sick, from my throat down to my core, and was on the verge of vomiting.  I looked up to Sigrid, noting her sick pleasure, “Y-You’re evil!” I snapped.

“By your measure, or are you using your God’s?” Sigrid chuckled, “How’s this… Pray for it to stop, and maybe, just maybe, your God will intervene!” Sigrid laughed, “Or, you can tell me who the stowaway in your crew is, and where she is hiding.”

I spit at her feet.

Sigrid looked to where I had spat, and slowly looked at me with a widening grin, “Good.  I’d hate for this to be over too quickly,” she said with maddened glee in her voice as she soaked the canvas rag in her hand.

I tried to push myself away before her knee pinned me down once more.

The wet canvas was over my face before I realized it, and I felt myself already start to hyper-ventilate. 

I couldn’t stop as the water was washing over my face, I tried to hold my breath, but I could only do so for so long.  When I tried to breathe next, nothing but the wet canvas was there, obstructing my mouth just enough to push my mind into an abject panic.

As my lungs screamed for air, I inhaled, only to feel water fill my mouth.   I attempted to spit it out, but the canvas kept me from expelling all of it.

My heart hammered in my chest as my lungs burned and I tried my damnedest to struggle against the cloth pitching my head back and nose flat.  

After what felt like minutes, finally, the canvas came off.  

My vision was blurred, my mind raced as I tried to piece together the sights and sounds around me.

Adrenaline rushed into my veins as I pushed myself from the chair, only to find that Sigrid still held me down firmly, my body trapped in my own personal hell.

Sigrid had clearly done this before, and I was behaving no differently than any of her other victims.

“Where is she, and who is she?” Sigrid said with a smile, “Though I have an idea, since you came from Panama… Come on now, Padre, where’s Cassara?”

I gasped, “I-I don’t know who…” I sputtered, swallowed hard and tried to keep myself from vomiting as a mouthful of lukewarm seawater and spittle slammed into my gut, “You think you are…” I gasped, “You’re going to pay for this!”  

Sigrid chuckled, leaning down in front of me, “Who’s going to make me pay?  Your God?  If He wants me to stop, have your God strike me down where I stand!”

Without warning, a fist swung at Sigrid’s cheek, and she stumbled to the side.

Cassara stood before me, “David?!  What the fuck are you doing!” Cassara shouted, glaring at Sigrid before Frida and Thea had leapt on her, grabbing her arms and tugging her down to the deck.

Sigrid laughed as she stood up, rubbing her cheek and looking to the sky, “Not going to lie, that was oddly timed,” She turned to Cassara, “Well hello there, Cass.  You acting out the will of the Christian God now?”

Cassara growled at her, glaring with hate.

“My my, how you’ve fallen from your favored spot as the Queen’s most potent bodyguard.  Now you’re nothing more than a wanted woman!” Sigrid taunted, “So sad,” Sigrid turned to me, “Now, Cass, I have to say I spent an awfully long time preparing this little endeavor.  So before we bring you home, I just want you to know something: I’m doing this to the missionary, because you forced my hand.” 

I tried to steel myself for what was coming.

Sigrid grinned wickedly at me, “Oh little boy, do you think you can hold out?” 

I glared at her, “I’m prepared this time,” I flustered, trying my best to keep my composure.  

“Oh, Padre,” Sigrid taunted, “There’s no preparing for it.  It only gets worse,” she laughed to herself, “Or so I’ve been told.” 

“Leave him alone, you got me!  Just take me back to Penthesil and leave David out of this!” Cassara shouted.

Sigrid paused, “No, you see this isn’t about *you*,” Sigrid said as she glanced at her bucket, “Frida, refill me?”

Frida frowned, and took the bucket from Sigrid, “Yes, Captain,” Frida’s tone shifted slightly as she turned from me.

“Captain, perhaps Frida is not so keen on following your orders.  I can assist you from here,” Thea said sternly.

“Did I order you to refill me, Thea?” Sigrid snapped.

“No, Captain,” Thea reported obediently.

“Then while I appreciate your offer, do adhere to my command,” Sigrid confirmed.

“Yes, Captain, my apologies,” Thea responded firmly.

Frida ran to the starboard side and threw the bucket over once more.

My eyes were on Frida as I saw the bucket fly overboard, knowing once it was full my next round of suffering would begin.  Already my lungs ached from the saltwater as Sigrid towered over me, my stomach sinking below the surface of the sea.

“He lied to me,” Sigrid hissed, “And for that?  Well,” Sigrid grinned as she turned to Junior, “You know what I do to liars, don’t you, Junior?”

A tear leaked from Junior as he whispered, “I rememba, I rememba,” he kept repeating to himself, growing quieter each time.

It was little mystery as to what trauma Sigrid had inflicted on Junior in the past.  It was likely the same exact fate that was going to befall me.  I shivered, held in place as I tried to ready my lungs for another onslaught.

Sigrid spun the canvas around in her hand, grinning ear to ear as the bucket was returned to her by Frida.  “Down you go, boy.”

The wet canvas was over my face before I could even move, as I gasped for air, the water came.

Panic hit me again, and I heard shouting, likely from Cassara but maybe from someone else.  My ears were filled with rushing water as my nose was pinned down hard, forcing all air, and water, through my mouth.  

I felt dizzy, confused, and my wrists burned as I struggled fruitlessly against the restraints.

As the water stopped I finally could get dense, moist, salt-water soaked air into my lungs, but even that burned.  In the middle of my second gasp for air the water came across the canvas again.  

I gagged and sputtered and now began to kick wildly.

I must have kicked out the leg of the folding chair I was tied to, and with Sigrid’s knee on my thigh, the whole thing knocked me over.

I was tossed onto the deck, gasping like a fish out of water as I coughed, spat, and vomited up bile and water onto the deck.

My ears were ringing and I could tell Sigrid was enraged now that I had somehow escaped her torment for the time being.

But despite the ringing, a different sort of white noise picked up in my ears.

A radio squawked to life as I regained my composure, and a message came over the radio in Spanish.

“\~has henceforth been terminated!” the radio squawked, “Repeat:  Penthesilean Naval Fleet in the Gulf, be advised. Our Allegiance with the United States has henceforth been terminated, return to your port of call immediately.”  The radio call ended.

I rolled over, watching as Sigrid grabbed at the radio on her waist, picking it up, “What was that?!”

“More information is coming in: If we have US Officers on board, we’re to detain them immediately.  All prisoners held under US Naval laws are to be released, embargo enforcement is to end,” the woman on the radio called back, “Repeat, prisoners of the United States are to be released immediately.”

Sigrid cursed as she shouted into the radio up once more, “Why?  Did that pacifist bitch Princess Eva push some bullshit laws through?” 

There was a moment of silence, “The new Empress has stated that we have shifted positions on the United States Alliance, and we are to give them no quarter.  Wait, is that right…?  Holy…” There was a pause on the other end.

Sigrid paused as well, “Get clarity on that last bit, Officer Gutierrez.” 

“Captain, confirmed: the United States has made an assassination attempt against Queen Rachel Hippolyte, we’re to change mission immediately, new orders are coming in now!” The radio called back.

Sigrid’s eyes went wide, “They captured the Queen?”

I sighed in relief, but the look on Cassara’s face wasn’t that of relief at all.

“You know that’s bullshit, Captain!” Cassara shouted, “The Empress is trying to start a war, first thing she has to do is give a reason to attack the US!” Cassara narrowed her eyes on Sigrid’s, “Your next orders are probably going to be a soft target to score an easy victory to boost morale before she leads the entire country into war.”

Sigrid lifted an eyebrow as the radio chirped again.

“Captain, our new orders are to ready full battle stations and lay siege to the Guantanamo Naval Base!  All Embargo patrols have the same orders, but if I have my information right we can be the first on the scene if we go full speed ahead and cut the tow lines loose!” The radio operator’s voice rang out.

Tears filled my eyes as I took deep, though aching, breaths.

It felt like I had been swimming for hours, my lungs felt full of fluid and still my stomach was in knots.

“That means, Captain, if we want to make good time we should cut the debris loose,” Frida announced.  

“Watch your tone, Frida, or I-” Captain Sigrid was interrupted as Frida stood firmly.

“Captain, with all due respect I can do one of two things today,” Frida said as she turned to Cassara, “I can forget what you did to this missionary and that we found Cassara, or I can forget that we ever ran across a ship this afternoon.”

Sigrid scoffed, “You insolent little-”

“If I filed a report, it would put a stain on your reputation.   We’re no longer under orders from the US to detain and interrogate.  We have new orders, and it doesn’t involve these men nor Cassara,” Frida shouted.

Captain Sigrid marched up to Frida, glaring at her, “I can toss you into the brig, or overboard, for going this hard, Frida.  Consider that right now.”

Thea’s voice called out, “With all due respect Captain, Captain Jaurez’s ship is not far from us, if we want an *actual* fight we should cut these idiots loose and head out for some *real* battle,” Thea gave a malicious grin, “I’m tired of tying up smugglers and would-be-thieves.  I want to sink ships and slit throats! So does the rest of the crew.  Or should I tell them that our Captain has grown scared of a real fight, and would prefer to pick on these defenseless little pricks?” 

Captain Sigrid growled, and turned to Cassara.   

The rest of the crew turned to Thea, her eyes focused on Sigrid.

“Ready our boarding vessel,” Sigrid said with a sneer as she picked up the radio once more, “All hands to battle stations, take us ahead full towards Gitmo.  Our last destination is now our new target.  Sink any known Naval vessel that calls Guantanamo Bay home port!” 

I sat up, still struggling with my restraints as Frida rushed over the rails.

Captain Sigrid glared at me as she made a final call to the radio, “And cut these twerps loose once we’re clear.”

“Aye Aye, Captain!” The radio called out as we heard alarms chime on from her ship.

“Consider your prayers answered, Father,” Sigrid growled at me as she hopped over the railing after Thea  to their tender boat below, “Frida, hurry up!”

Frida stopped as she looked to Cassara, “You’re welcome.”

Cassara was silent as she stood up.

“That’s for primary school, by the way. When you defended me in the locker room,” Frida frowned, “Guess it would be a bad time to ask you to please come back home?”

“Yeah, real bad time,” Cassara hissed.

Frida chuckled, “That’s just you, I guess.  Good luck, Cass,” Frida said as she followed Sigrid and Thea into their boat.

Cassara walked over to me, and slowly started untying my restraints, “I’m not going to clean up the vomit, but I’m not going to pretend you didn’t just go through Hell.”

Junior’s voice called out, “Dey cuttin’ us free, the second we’re out of their sight we make for Antilla, and we’re gonna make port der for far longer den expected!” 

Kendis ran over to me, “You okay, man?”

I shook my head, my voice hitching, “N-No.”

Kendis picked me up but I wasn’t too steady on my feet, “Come on, lets get yah washed up and settled in.”

The ship noticeably slowed and lurched slightly as the tow-line ahead of us was cut.

Kayode turned to Cassara, “Penthesil going against the US Navy?  Dat’s not good fer yah sista’s, no?”

Cassara frowned, “Normally I’d say ‘No way’, but this new Empress is different.”

“Howso?” Junior asked, “A pain in da ass as the Penthasil Navy was, long as I stayed outta der bad side, I was fine.  What’s so bad about dis new Empress, eh?”

Cassara looked out on the horizon as Sigrid’s ship faded off in the distance, “She’s a Warmonger.”

...

The sun had finally set, and now I sat on the deck as the moon reflected off the low rolling waves in the distance.  The sky was clear, and I could see the stars glinting in the sky above.

Despite the tranquil waters around me and the serene sky, my heart was racing.

I had been trying to calm myself, but a cold sweat had taken me, keeping me from sleeping.

“Last ting ya’ wanna do is lay down,” I heard Junior’s voice call out from behind me.

I was jumpier than I would have expected, turning to Junior in an instant.  

For a moment, I thought I saw Sigrid behind me.

“Yah gonna be fucked up for a while der, Blan,” Junior said as he sat down next to me, “...It don’t seem like alotta time out der tah those of us who saw, but I know.  I know it be ten minutes out ‘ere, and a lifetime in dat chair.”

I shook my head as a ringing filled my ears and I was reminded of the pain in my lungs once more.  

“We dock in Antilla soon,” Junior announced, “Dey might be pissed we late, but I tink they might be ‘appy tah ‘ear the news dat the embargo’s unofficially over.” 

“I still don’t get how that doesn’t make the news or anything, that the US has a foreign navy patrolling the gulf,” I pointed out.

“No one cares, and those dat do?  No one ‘ears from ‘em.  So, no one cares,” Junior shook his head, “Dey only give a fuck if some rich white girl winds up gettin’ kidnapped on spring break down ‘ere.  But the shit that ‘appens to da locals?  No one gives a fuck.”

I tried to even recall the last time I had heard about the Cuban Embargo, now that I thought about it.  

It’s not like it’s even talked about stateside.  I think even one mention of it came up in the last ten years in the news, and it was there and gone in the news cycle in less than a week.

Junior was probably right: No one cared.

I frowned, wondering how the world could be tricked so easily into looking the other way over something so critical.  

Or was that by design?

“Iffin’ yah can’t sleep, keep watch,” Junior said as he stood up, “Den yah can at least still be useful.”

“Thanks for the pep-talk,” I said sarcastically as Junior walked off.

“Yah got me sympathy, Blan,” Junior said as he made his way back to the bridge, “But yah not gettin’ me pity.” 

I couldn’t help but smile at Junior.  He was a prick but he was still human under that salty exterior.

Though considering what he had been through, I was a little less shocked he had to develop a thick skin.

I sighed, I was jumping from the frying pan into the fire this entire trip, and I was hoping to get some level of solace.  

Still my mind and heart wouldn’t settle down from everything.

Even as I tried to push the water-boarding out of my mind, I had the riddles of Baron Samdei ringing in my head.  

“*Beware of doors without door ways?”* I thought, *“Or was it a doorway without a door?”* I sighed to myself, “How do you have a door without a doorway?” I asked out loud to no one in particular. 

“Hardware store?” Cassara said as she approached the railing, leaning against it as she turned to me, “Thinking about Haiti?” 

“About everything,” I sighed.

Cassara gave a nod and looked out over the water, “...Once we hit Antilla, I think I’m going to bounce.”

I turned to her, confused, “I thought you were going to work with Junior?”

Cassara’s eyes moved down to track the ocean’s surface as it lapped softly against the hull of the ship, “I’m bad luck, it seems.  I travel with you, we run into undead creatures and evil spirits.  I travel with Junior, his ship gets boarded and I almost get everyone tossed in prison.”

“That wasn’t-” Cassara cut me off.

“Don’t say ‘It wasn’t my fault’!”, Cassara snapped, glaring at me, “Sigrid was after *me*.  If she wasn’t such a fucking war-hawk she’d have dragged me and everyone else here directly to some backwater prison to rot!” Cassara calmed slightly, “No. I’m better off just traveling on my own.  Less people to worry about, less people to hurt,” Cassara sighed, “I made it this far on my own, I can make it the rest of the way.”

“You and I have been getting pretty far together, you know?” I tried to joke, though my heart wasn’t fully behind the attempt at brevity.

“As long as I’ve been tagging along with you, I’ve spent a lot longer alone,” Cassara’s eyes moved to me, her face still looking to the horizon, “What, did you think I trekked across the entire Darien Gap in a day?”

“Fair point,” I heaved a sigh, “Do you even know where you’re going?” 

Cassara looked out over the water, “Just away.  I don’t know?  Maybe a small cabin someplace in the middle of nowhere in Alberta?” Cassara leaned against the railings, “Just out of reach from home.  Just find a cabin and be off the grid.”

“And what would you do there?” I pressed.

“Live alone, chop wood, maybe get a dog,” Cassara turned to me, “But more importantly: Whatever the fuck I want.  No overbearing Step Mom wanting me to join the military, no sister trying to get herself killed by biting off more than she can chew, and no warmongering empress telling me to march on poor unsuspecting civilians in the name of ‘Justice’ or ‘National Pride’.” 

I nodded, “From what I’ve seen and heard, this empress and ‘Justice’ are the furthest things from one another.”

Cassara shook her head, “Everyone claims they stand for justice when they go to war.  They have their fake reasons, the ‘Justice’, the ‘Moral Obligation’ or whatever,” Cassara scoffed, “It’s all a grab for power.  Every time.  Either they feel the other party has too much or they feel threatened by it.”

“Is that why you’re trying to head to the US?  To get away from it?” I asked.

Cassara laughed, “You’re kidding, right?!  Who do you think does it the most?”

I frowned, “Well, I-”

“Don’t,” Cassara said, shaking her head, “I don’t want to hear you rationalizing it.  It is what it is.  We can bitch, piss and moan.  But nothing we say or do will stop it.  All we can do is survive it as best we can, and not contribute to it when we see it kicking in.” 

I wasn’t sure how to answer her, so I cast my eyes out over the water, trying to focus on the horizon.

“...So, yeah,” Cassara stated flatly as she pushed away from the rails, “If you don’t see me tomorrow, I guess this is goodbye.  I’m going to bed.”

I remained silent as Cassara walked off.

“Oh,” Cassara called out before she went below deck.

I turned to her, spotting her making a fist and punching her palm.

“If I ever see Sigrid again, I’m going to give her one for you,” Cassara said with a sly smile.

I forced a smile as best I could, “Thanks.”

Cassara’s grin faded as she turned and headed inside.

I sat there, looking out over the edge of the ship as I saw us draw closer to port.  Soon enough we had docked, Kendis and Kayode had passed by me but not spoken to me.  Junior didn’t demand I lift a finger, just seemed to let time pass me by.

I sat there as the sun crested the horizon and rose up over the ocean.  It was honestly surreal.  Still, I couldn’t slow my heart down.  

Time wasn’t stopped, it just didn’t matter.  The water changed colors to match the sky, and the sounds of the waves and chatter from the docks filled my ears.

I could hear the work going on deck.  Freight being unloaded, the vibrations of things rolling across the deck and familiar and unfamiliar voices alike playing just on the corner of my attention.

Yet every time I saw the foam of a wave crest against the hull of the ship, I could swear I saw a bucket with a rope leading to the [rail](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple/).
