**Genesis 3:24**-*”…he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life”*

It was as perfect a spring day as the south could ever have. 

Not to cold, hot or humid. 

Any other day-even earlier that day-it’s be full of people enjoying all the lush green, flowers, sounds and tall bending trees. 

That’s why at 5:44PM on May 22, 2025 cemented just how sensational and captivating this event would be. How did it happen in broad daylight?


The call came in at 5:44PM. 

Exactly 2 hours before the sunset. 
  They called me by 6:01PM. I arrived at 6:44PM, exactly 1 hour till sunset.

Our car passed the security clearance, as the whole park had been blocked off and in the process of being evacuated.

“Come with us,” a metro officer driving a golf cart said. We hopped on and took a short ride through the park. 

It could’ve seemed like heaven on earth that day. There was an odd amount of deer walking around, considering all the noise and humans.

I made a note of that, and how some sounded like they were weeping, almost.

We stopped at a small clearing to our left. It was part of another blocked off area within another blocked off area. 

As we set our feet down, a snake slithered between us. Fairly slow, like it dreaded what was inside, but needed to be there.

“They keep coming in sir,” the officer told me. “We keep trying to trap them but more keep coming.”

“That’s alright,” I said, letting the mid size snake past me. “They’re harmless, and I’m not scared.”


“Well they’re definitely not the worst thing you’ll see in there.”

“Yeah, I’m sure I’ve seen worse.”

The officers, detectives, everyone around looked like they’d seen a ghost. 

“We estimate at least 277 bodies, and about 300, I guess, grave markers?”

“Is that including the adult female?”

“Well, 278 bodies then.”

“And the boy that found this?”

He pointed down the paved trail. A boy, probably late teens, sat on the ground, elbows resting on his bent knees. He was brazenly smoking a joint with all these cops around. 


“We couldn’t tell him no sir,” the officer said when I looked at him with my head cocked. 

“Sir…this boy…the trauma…sir I would’ve given him a beer after knowing what he found. Fire me right now, but it was the least I could do for him.”

I looked back at him. 

His eyes locked mine and I saw the hopelessness and rage, and the blood that wasn’t his on his face. There was no pleading in his eyes. 

If anything it was like he was daring me to put him out of his misery. 
I got it-the least I could do was let the poor boy smoke a fucking joint.

“He charged?”

“No sir. He actually claims SHE did it.”

“Who is she? The only female I’ve been told of is the victim.”

“He’s claiming she’s not the victim, sir. He’s saying it’s much more complicated.”

“The dead girl is the suspect according to him huh?”

“Yes. We were just waiting to see what you wanted to do with him. None of it makes any sense and the poor kid just…”

“Parents?”

“He’s 18 as of yesterday. He said he didn’t know them, and didn’t wanna call anyone else. Goes by James Raymond.”

I looked back at the kid and gave him a small head nod. We had the same name, and same birthday.

“Stay here,” I told the officer as I lifted the tape. 

“Yessir, we were told to leave everything as is until you got here to inspect.”

I lifted the tape and stepped in. I automatically looked straight up. 

Any other day, the clearing encapsulated under the shady trees, vines climbing up, the birds chirping, it would’ve been heaven.

I looked down and was brought back to my hellish job. 

From metro, to detective, to TBI, to FBI. I happened to be in Tennessee to handle some business on a property I had sold when the call came in. 

After identifying at least 5 bodies of wanted predators from different states, it became a federal issue, and luckily they had a real deal FBI Detective just down the road. 
One who thought a little different and had a strong stomach for the especially deranged. 

Good old southern boy, James Andrews. 
I told everyone to just call me Jimmy.


Two careful steps in a I heard the dull thud of the tip of my foot hitting bone. 

Fractured skull, freshly unearthed, dead about 30 years judging by the dryness and coloring. 

Slowly, to take in everything my eyes saw, I scanned upward.


That kid deserved a joint, Xanax, and blow job once I saw what he saw.


Adult male bodies, all in different stages of decomposition, 277 of them, stacked around the trunk of a huge, beautiful oak tree. I prowled the base of the tree, only able to see parts of this atrocity. 

I gathered from some of them they had been stabbed straight in the heart. 

None of them particularly looked the same, so no pattern there. 
The newer ones, towards the top, however…I recognized them. 


Child molesters, rapists, the scum of the earth on the run or out of prison too early.


The men who don’t deserve to breathe on this earth was the pattern. 
All 277 of them.


Then, on the inside perimeter of the clearing, small rocks or pieces of wood with writing on them. They were all evenly spaced.

“Mary Anne West-1990” one said.

“Angelo Harris-2001.”

“Katie Dupree-1994.”

“Carlos Reina-2025.”

They were names of missing children.
It was a graveyard of missing children from the past 35 fucking years. We’d find out they were all buried under their markers. 
300 families got their revenge and closure at 6:44PM.

“How the fuck did…” I began to say, until two small snakes scurried by. I watched them climb up the bodies, up the tree, and passed the bottom of a foot.

Looking straight up the tree, taking a few steps back, I saw a hand, with a deep red stream dripping down to the bodies.

White female, long red hair, nude, resting gently in the branches, a serene beautiful face like she was taking a nap. Both wrists slashed, and the handle of a Bowie knife sticking out of her chest. 

Her body would surely run out of blood soon, but at that moment it slowly crawled, down to her victims.

The snakes had gathered around her, with the biggest one curled around her left arm, and head resting sadly over her heart.

That was the picture that would be leaked and worldwide news before the sun had set in Nashville, TN. 

They’d call the woman Eve, and the serpent her temptation, like the poor snake got her there.

That was the picture that named May 22, 2025 at 6:44PM, the Garden of Eden Murders.
