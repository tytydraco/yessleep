Simply put, I'm a severe insomniac.

As a kid I would normally find myself randomly find myself fixing my room and rearranging furniture in the middle of the night. This got worse in highschool. I would go to sleep after school, wake up at midnight, and then spend time on my computer until school started.

When I turned 16 my mom urged me to get a job, as I always wanted to upgrade my computer space, and my mom was tired of dishing out money every week when I wanted something new. This is when I picked up my skill as a website designer. After school I could keep my evenings open for sleep, then work from midnight to 7:30AM as a website designer.

As a sixteen year old making adult money, life was fucking amazing. I bought a Lexus in my junior year, payed for everything when I went out with my friends, and most of all, started dating the most beautiful girl ever.

Her name was Macy. I met her at a diner one night, where she served my friends and I. After my friends left I decided to stick around and sat with her on her break. I ordered her a coffee and her favorite meal and got to know her.

She went to the 'rival' high school, but we shared the same interests. I hadn't had a talk like that in all my life, instantly I knew I wanted to marry this girl. Before I left I set five hundred dollar bills on the table with a little note beside them:

*"Thanks for the talk. Enjoy your shift. - Mitchell"*

I returned to the diner every day for the next week until she was finally working again. She came over and asked how I was, and again, we sat and talked for a while.

After that I would return to the diner every day and we grew closer. I finally asked her out and we made it official. Life was amazing.

When senior year came around, I decided I was tired of high school and dropped out. My mother didn't take to kindly to this, and kicked me out, saying I wouldn't be living off her anymore if I didn't want to go to school. I lived with a friend for a month until I could find a place to buy, and bought a cabin out in the woods. Don't let the fact that it was a cabin fool you, the inside could have been something out of a sci-fi novel. White marble interior with black accents all throughout. New appliances and electronics and a large deck outside with a hot tub.

At age 18, I had a fast car, huge house, and beautiful girlfriend. The last thing I had to do was to propose to Macy, this would complete my life, and I did.

We got married, and regardless of my feelings, I invited my mother. Mainly because this was a $200,000 wedding and I wanted to rub my success in her face, but a part of me understood my moms decision of kicking me out, and wanted to show her my success in prideful manner.

At age 19, I was now the CEO of an Umbrella Corporation that had companies that worked on Marketing, Website Design, and software upkeep/software design. At this point, the money couldn't stop. I had started live streaming to pass the time, and with my understanding of branding and ad placement, I was a verified live streamer averaging 1500 viewers in the first two months. I had eight cars, a boat and a small plane and spoiled Macy every chance I got. It was at this time that Macy and I decided to have a child.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This life didn't last long, nothing ever does.

What was supposed to be the happiest day of my life took a turn that would forever change my life. On the day our child was supposed to be brought into this world, he was born a stillborn. This ruined Macy. I spent the whole day crying, Macy was expressionless. She didn't react to anything, she was catatonic.

The next few months were nothing short of hell. Macy didn't speak, didn't sleep, barely ate. I tried everything, got experts to come in and evaluate her, tried bringing her to her happy places, but no matter how much I spent she never got better. After a while I decided I had had enough and stopped helping her, that turned out to be the biggest mistake.

That's when it happened, the day. I got home from grocery shopping and looked for Macy all over the place. I walked into our bedroom and saw the light to the bathroom was open, I took a step forward and saw her head peaking over the edge of the tub,  "OK, she's taking a bath", I thought. As I got closer my stomach sank as I saw the water was a deep red and her neck had been slit.

On the sink countertop, lay a note:

*"Mitchell, I'm sorry. I wish that it didn't have to end like this. I cannot handle the pain, I am the reason our son is dead, and the reason you will never be happy. I never felt your love and know you hate me. Hopefully me being gone will fix things."*

I fell to the floor and the world went black.

The next few weeks were sleepless. Police interviews and interrogations filled my days and loved ones reaching out to offer empty condolences.

I decided I needed professional help. I sold my businesses for nearly nine figures, sold my house, sold my cars, and locked the most important personal belongings into a storage locker, before finding the most luxurious mental health retreat money could buy.

I spent two months there, and slowly learned how to deal with the pain.

After getting discharged, I bought a small home on a street in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and found a new desire to start more businesses. With upwards of fifty million dollars to spend and a whole new mindset, I got back to work, grinding through the night and sleeping through the day, starting a new, mental health driven app.

The weird occurrences started shortly thereafter. Just a few weeks ago. The first thing I noticed was my reflection. Before heading to bed one night, I went to brush my teeth and nearly jumped when I realized my reflection was slightly smirking back at me...

Surely I was just imagining it.

A few days later I was in the kitchen getting a snack when I noticed something in the sliding glass door of my backyard, *was that a person?!*

I ran to the door and flipped on the lights to my backyard, nothing. *Must've been my reflection, I thought.*

The next few days went by normally, until tonight.

I had just finished a meeting with a client from Sweden. I removed my headphones and started to get up, but I took one last look at the zoom window, and I wish I didn't.

In my camera, behind me, stood a fuzzy, shadowy figure, standing still in the far corner of my room.

I turned around as fast as I could and saw nothing. My computer screens started flickering along with my lights and my phone started buzzing at a mile a minute:
