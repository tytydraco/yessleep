The forum started as a refuge, a place for writers to share their darkest fantasies, their nightmares, their most twisted desires. It was anonymous, free from the constraints of the real world. People came and went, posting their stories, feeding their deepest, most hidden thoughts into a machine that seemed to a safe haven for them all.

It all began with an innocent post. A user wrote a short tale of a man who woke up to find his reflection in the mirror was not his own. It grinned at him, twisted its lips into a mockery of a smile, and whispered secrets no one should know. The next morning, people all over the city woke up to mirrors that seemed to move when they weren’t looking. Some of them swore they heard whispers from the glass, but no one else could hear it.

Then came another story—a woman haunted by a shadow that never left her side. She tried to outrun it, but no matter where she went, it was always there, creeping behind her. That night, several forum members reported seeing figures in the corners of their rooms, standing just out of sight, lurking where they couldn’t quite reach. Some described the figures as “not human,” their eyes hollow and dark.

But that was just the beginning. As users shared more tales, things started to manifest. A man posted a story about a creature that crawled out from under beds at night, its limbs bending at unnatural angles, its skin slick and pale. Within hours, people in the city started to disappear, their beds empty but the sheets twisted as if someone had been pulled into the darkness. The police found nothing but the faint smell of decay in their homes.

By then, the forum had grown, its members emboldened by curiosity. They crafted new tales, stories darker than the last, stories that bled into the waking world.

One user, desperate for validation, wrote about something even worse—a creature that lived in the spaces between moments, a presence that could slip into your life, unnoticed, and twist everything you knew until nothing was real. It was a being of pure malice, its only purpose to bring suffering to those who dared invoke it.

That’s when it all began to unravel.

Members of the forum started to notice things—objects moved when they weren’t looking. Their loved ones began to act strangely, distant, as if they were controlled by something else. Whispers followed them, even in broad daylight. It had become too real.

The man who had written the story about the creature —he was the first to disappear. No one saw it happen. No one heard a scream. One moment, he was posting, desperate for answers, and the next, he was gone. His account was still active, his last message blinking on the screen: *"It’s here. It’s real. I’m—"*

The posts continued, but no one could keep up. People were vanishing. The shadows in their homes grew longer. The mirrors began to crack. No matter how far they ran, how many precautions they took, the stories followed them.

A woman wrote about a door that led into another world—one where time didn’t exist, where you could live forever, but only if you gave up your humanity. The next morning, she opened her front door to find the sky had turned an unnatural shade of black, the air thick with something foul. And standing on her doorstep was a figure, a man with hollow eyes who only whispered.

*“You asked for it.”*

A chilling realization dawned on them all. Each tale, each word, was like a seed planted in the real world, and now it was growing, twisting, feeding on their fear and despair. The power of manifestation had gone far beyond their control.

And it wasn’t just the forum members that suffered. As the darkness spread, anyone who had ever read a post found themselves infected, drawn into the nightmare. A simple phrase—a line, a whisper, a name—was enough to pull them into the void.

They were no longer fiction. They were prophecies. And the world was becoming their canvas.

As the final post flickered onto the screen, it was a single sentence written in the eerie glow of the monitor

**“I write the stories now.”**
