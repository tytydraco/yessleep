When the masked man dropped the knife, I watched as Martin scrambled over to pick it up. With two dogs viciously biting him and the knife in the hands of my friend, he turned to flee. As he ran off, Bella snapped at his face pulling off the mask. But it was too dark for me to make out his features as he fled.   
Wagging her tail, mask in her mouth, she came over and sat beside me as I raised myself up on my elbows. Martin had been staring after the retreating man, shuffling as if undecided whether he should follow. With a sigh, he turned away and looked over at me and Bella, as Barney laid down on my other side, panting. My body and limbs were throbbing from hitting the dirt, and the adrenaline from fear that made my pulse loud in my ears was beginning to subside. Having my dogs back felt like I had just been wrapped in a warm security blanket.  
“What you got there, girl?” I said, and gently took the mask from her mouth.  
It was not easy to make out the details in the gathering gloom, but it was black, with wide eyes and a mouth open as if in a snarl or scream. It had tufts of feathers on it. Martin watched me, and then held out his hand and I gave it to him. He held it up, in front of his face silently for a moment.  
“I think this is Native American,” Martin said. “But I don’t think there are any living around here anymore.”  
I felt the blood drain from my face in fear. I was glad Martin could not see me. You see, he was right. I knew exactly when the last Native American’s left this area. My family were the first and only settlers at that time. And when they left, we were entrusted to be guardians by them. To keep evil away. So, what was that Native American doing here, and why did they attack us?  
“No,” I said. “There have not been any of them here in over a hundred years.”   
I struggled to stand up, and Martin pulled me to my feet. As I got my bearings of where we were, I was hit by another shock. Of all the places to end up, we were in the one part of the forest I dreaded most. I felt my breath catch, and my shoulders bunch up as I slowly turned and surveyed the meadow. Bella and Barney stood up, watching me, and panting softly.  
“Audrey, we should leave,” Martin said. “We need to report this to the police.”  
“No!” I said, my voice strident from fright. I felt bad about my reaction immediately.  
“I’m sorry,” I said to Martin, raising my hand to my face and slowly shaking my head. “There is more to this than you know….it has to do with my family.”  
I had done it. I felt nauseous. In over a hundred years, I was the first in my family to implicate to an outsider that we had a secret. I could not take it back now, but honestly, I was too scared to be alone with what was happening. Then I saw it, even though the thought of approaching it now made me queasy, I had to check. I did not think it was a coincidence that we ended up here, chased by a Native American.  
“Before we leave, I need to take a look at something,” I said.   
As I headed off towards the roughly hewn rock that gave off an eerie aura in the dark, my dogs began to whine. They followed behind me, tails, and heads down. Martin came to my side.  
“Are you going to stop being so cryptic soon?” Martin said. “It’s kinda freaking me out.”  
“I promise I will explain,” I said. “Please, just trust me on this.”  
Martin sighed, then nodded.   
If you look at it up closely, you can see that it is not a rough-hewn rock. It’s old, and weathered, but obviously it was created for a use. And up close you can see the carvings. Looking at it now, I gasped, covering my mouth with a trembling hand.   
“What’s wrong?” Martin said. “What is this, Audrey?”  
There were fresh carvings on the altar. This was the culmination of everything that had happened, it could only mean one thing. The worst fear I had been trying not to think about was real. Someone was trying to free the evil….
