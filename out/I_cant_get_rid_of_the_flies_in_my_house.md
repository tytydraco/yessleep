I’d been living in the old Victorian for six months when I first noticed the flies. They congregated in the corner of the study, a fist-sized stain on the faded Persian carpet that seemed to pulse with them. No matter how many times I sprayed insecticide or laid traps, they returned—droning, persistent, their bodies glinting like obsidian beads in the sunlight. The previous owner had warned me the house had “quirks,” but this felt deliberate. As though the stain was so delicious to them that they couldn’t help but gather there.

One sweltering July afternoon, I snapped. “Fuck it, I’ll just replace it”, I mumbled as I tore the carpet up with a crowbar. Sweat dripped down my neck as I removed the culprit section of the carpet. Beneath the moth-eaten fabric was a patch of warped hardwood covered in maggots, its edges blackened as if scorched. “Whaaat the fuck”, I said to myself in disgust. A single floorboard sat slightly raised, like a crooked tooth. I pried it loose with the crowbar, half expecting to find human remains underneath, but instead; there, in the hollow beneath, lay a book.  

It wasn’t like the gothic grimoires from movies. This was small; kind of like those pocket Bibles you find in hotel rooms. It was bound in cracked suede the color of dried blood and its pages were yellowed and brittle. The symbols inside weren’t Latin—they squirmed, shifting under my gaze like centipedes. Yet somehow, I *understood* them. A chant whispered in my mind, sweet and coaxing: *“Speak me, and I’ll make the flies go away.”*  

I laughed. A nervous, breathy sound. What harm could it do?  

That night, with a bottle of bourbon as my courage, I knelt over the floorboard hollow and recited the words aloud. The air turned syrupy, smelling of wet soil and rotting fruit. Then came the voice—smooth as oil, amused.  

**“Ah, a pragmatist.”**  

The man who materialized before me was… ordinary? Mid-thirties, unshaven, dressed in a rumpled linen shirt and slacks. His eyes were the only oddity—pale green, flecked with gold, like sunlight through a swamp. He gestured to the stain on the floor. **“Flies, right? Nasty business. Let’s fix that.”** A snap of his fingers, and the insects crumbled to ash.  

“Who… *what* are you?” I stammered.  

**“A problem-solver,”** he said, grinning. **“Call me Baz. And you, my friend, just earned yourself a favor.”**  

Over the next week, Baz became a fixture. He fixed the leaking roof, unclogged the septic tank, even brewed a mean cup of coffee. He joked about modern life, lamented the “paperwork” of his job, and never once mentioned demons or souls. To be honest, I actually kind of enjoyed his company but after a few more days I grew suspicious of his helpfulness eventually driving me to ask what he wanted in return.

“ Seriously though, Baz, why are you doing all of this?”

he waved me off. **“Consider it a housewarming gift. But… if you’re feeling generous, a little signature wouldn’t hurt.”** He produced a simple receipt, no different from one you’d get from a convenience store.**“You see, I’m somewhat of a handyman and and all I need is a signature right here at the bottom. Standard stuff—acknowledgment of services rendered.”**  

I should’ve read it. But the flies were gone. The house was warm, finally *mine*. I scribbled my name.  

The moment the ink dried, Baz’s skin split.  

His body erupted into a mass of writhing maggots, eyes boiling into pus-yellow orbs. Wings—translucent, veined—sprouted from his back, buzzing with the sound of a thousand flies. The voice that emerged was a chorus of screams.  

**“Souls are so much sweeter when given, not taken,”** Belzebub crooned, a clawed hand pressing over my chest. Coldness spread, my breath frosting in the air. **“Don’t look so grim! You’ll live a long, happy life… until I come to collect.”**  

The lights flickered and he vanished, leaving the stench of sulfur.

I tried to burn the grimoire. It wouldn’t catch fire.  

Now, when I wake at 3 a.m., I hear him laughing in the walls—a sound like broken glass and wings. The flies are back, too, but now they follow me around.

It’s been two years since the last time I saw Baz and I pray it was all just a bad dream, but just as I start to drift off to sleep, I hear a buzzing next to my ear.

I fucking hate flies.
