‘ I’d better bring the dogs inside.’ I thought to myself after glancing at my watch. It was eleven o’clock at night. I began to freak out a little. ‘ Eleven? The dogs have been outside for three hours! How could I forget about them.’ I paused the movie I was watching and got up off of the couch.

‘ Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!’ I thought as I speedwalked to the back door. Before I reached the back door I looked out the kitchen window. The sky was black. Pitch black. A darkness I’ve only seen once before. ‘ no…’ I dropped down to my knees. 

“ No!” I screamed burying my face in my hands. My heart was broken. My body was trembling in fear. ‘ It got the dogs.’

“ Cookie… Chip… I’m so sorry.” I put my hands on the ground in a sort of bowing position and I prayed.
“ God… Dear God please help me. Please make this darkness go away and never return.” Just as I had finished my sentence, I heard something. It sounded like a high pitch yelp. ‘ Cookie?’ I thought. I got up off the ground. I slowly snuck over to the back door. I moved at a snail's pace. With every step I took The feeling of fear got worse. It got so bad that halfway through the walk to the back door I vomited on the floor. But I still kept going.
‘ Only five steps away now. Four… three…’ The door was right in front of me now. The door had a window in it. But the blinds were pulled down. I tried to raise my hand to open the door. Key words “ Tried to”. I was frozen. Petrified.

My mind was racing a mile a minute. ‘ What if it gets me?’ ‘ Are the dogs worth my life?’ ‘ I could always just adopt a cat.’ I shook those thoughts out of my head. ‘ No.’

I opened the door. The fear in me turned completely into dread. I was outside. During the blackness. I flipped a switch and the back porch lights turned on. I could only see about fifteen feet in front of me. But there on the very edge of the light were Cookie and Chip. But I could not see their faces. They were looking into the woods behind my house. Frozen.

“ Chip.” I squeaked. Chip didn’t turn his head a single inch to look at me. I Tried to call Cookie.

“ Cookie come.” I whispered. Nothing. I cursed under my breath. I took a step off the porch. My body was yelling. No Screaming at me to turn around and go back inside. But I couldn’t. ‘ Those dogs are my only family. I have to get them inside.’

I slowly walked over to the dogs. My eyes not leaving them the entire time. When I reached the dogs some of the fear had left my body. I made it this far out and nothing. I haven't seen or heard anything. With my fear lessened I reached down to pick up the two small dogs. When I grabbed the two dogs I heard a chuckling sound.

“ No…” The Fear in my body turned into hopeless despair.

“ Hello boy.” The voice was a low whisper. I didn’t look up. I didn’t move. I just started crying. The tears were hot streaming down my cheeks. The darkness completely surrounded me. The air grew heavy. I could feel it looking at me. With its cold yellow eyes. I didn’t need to look up to see them. I already knew what color they were.

The darkness was cold. I couldn’t see anything. I could only feel the grass under my feet and the two dogs in my hands.

‘ No! No! No! No! No!’ ‘ This is how it happened to mom.’ ‘ This is how it happened to dad.’ ‘The darkness completely surrounded them.’ ‘Then that thing did something to them.’
I felt something wrap around my body. It was cold and wet and slimy. I dropped the dogs. I heard their paws running against the ground. Then I heard a whooshing sound. Followed by two wet thwacking sounds. After that I heard whining.

The monster lifted me up into the air and brought me to its face. I could only see its two yellow eyes.

“ You were able to outrun me for ten whole years.”

The fear in me was so extreme that I couldn’t think. I just sat there staring into the eyes of this monster. Then a vision popped into my head.

It was my dad. He was screaming. He was on fire. Then the vision left my mind. But it was quickly followed by another one.

This time it was my mom. She was screaming. She was falling. The visions continued like this showing horrible things happening to my parents for hours. Then for what felt like days. Then weeks. Then months. And all the time I can hear a slow beeping. And sometimes I would hear the whispers of people talking.

I knew the visions were never going to end. I knew I would be stuck in this hell forever.
