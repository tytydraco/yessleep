I fixed my shirt and pressed myself up against the back door to the bar, still processing the events that just happened.

Harley, [the 300 year old vampire standing in front of me](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15agr55/i_can_see_peoples_ages_tonight_i_met_a_woman_who/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1), just tried to drain me of my blood. Instead, she ended up breaking one of her fangs and was currently giving me an “if looks could kill” stare. 

“I’m a- I’m a *what* now? Never mind that,” I screamed, “You’re a fucking vampire!”

In a second she was back on me, holding my mouth shut. Harley whispered menacingly in my ear, “Christ, shut the hell up! You know, you might be one of the Chosen and I might not be able to drink you, but that doesn’t mean I still can’t *kill* you!” 

I pushed her off me, less scared of her than I was a second ago. A breathless laugh escaped my mouth as I ran my hand through my short brown hair, “I still don’t know what you’re talking about!”

“Uh, huh. Sure you don’t,” Harley rolled her eyes and shoved her hand in my face, fang pointed right at my eyeball. “I can’t believe I was stupid enough to fall for that nerds trap! Where is he, huh? How far away is that little twerp, Nate?”

“Listen lady,” I said, trying to be menacing, shoving the fang out of my personal space,” you better start talking some sense or I’ll- I’ll knock that other fang right out of your mouth!”

Harley chuckled, “I’d like to see you try, sweetheart,” before stuffing her tooth into the pocket of her leather jacket. She looked unsure of herself, like I might really be able to knock her other tooth out.

She took a few steps back and started laughing nervously to herself. Something had her spooked. “Well this is clearly an act you’ve got going on here. That or you really are as clueless as you look. Either way, it’s been fun, but I’m getting the hell out of here while I still can.”

Harley threw out a peace sign as she turned to leave and melt back into the shadows, but suddenly stopped in her tracks. She let out a groan of frustration as she clenched her fists. “No,no,no,no,no! *Shit!*”

I scrunch my eyebrows in confusion. This whole situation was just so odd. Then again, so is a guy who can see how old people are.

“Going somewhere, Harley?” An unfamiliar male voice rang out from the entrance of the alleyway. He stepped into the light, holding his hand out in front of him, like he was using The Force. “What a shame, the party was just getting started!”

Well one thing is for sure, Harley was right. This kid was definitely a nerd. He wore tennis shoes, beige khaki pants, and a dark navy blue sweater vest on top of a white dress shirt. He even had big oversized framed glasses to match. Who I’m presuming to be the infamous Nate Harley was going on about earlier was tall, dark, and handsome, but I could definitely tell he was just a teenager. 

What was weird though, was that for the first time that wasn’t on tv or looking at people through a mirror, I couldn’t see his age. There were no numbers above his head. He just looked like a normal guy.

Who-I’m-still-presuming-to-be-Nate said, “Why don’t we dance a little?” He then started to flick his wrist around all Willy Nilly. 

As if being a marionette and him the puppet master, Harley then started dancing around foolishly. Clearly she had no control over her own actions. She hissed out angrily,“Ooh when I get my hands on you, you’re so dead!”

In shock and awe I watched as this cool biker chick ungraciously flailed around, by the hands of a nerd no less! 

Slowly, he was starting to look less and less like a dweeb as the air of confidence that this kid carried around him made him look almost… *awesome*.

“Alright, Alright, that’s enough fun for now. Party’s over.” Nate said as Harley’s movement hitched to a stop. He left her right arm in the air, knees twisted in, and head down- not unlike a Micheal Jackson pose.

“I hope you rot in Hell.” Harley cursed as she gained a little control back over her neck muscles and glared at the teen in front of her. She was seething mad. I think I could make out a faint stream of steam coming out of her ears.

Nate chuckled as he flicked his wrist one final time. “Well at least you’ll be down there right beside me.”

A sickening crunch filled the crisp night air as all the bones in Harley’s neck snapped as her head did a 180. This was followed by the sound of her limp body falling to the gravel floor. Nate brushed the imaginary dust off his hands as he patted himself on the back, triumphantly.

 I felt my dinner threatening to come back up as I leaned my body against the wall for support. My vision was spinning! I don’t know what I was expecting, but it sure wasn’t that. That was- that was gruesome.

“Jesus Christ! Is she- is she dead?” I asked as Nate closed the distance between himself and the corpse on the ground. Harley’s eyes were still open and seemed to be piercing my soul.

Nate nudged her shoulder, checking for any signs of a reaction. All he got was her body flopping onto its back due to gravity. “Nope.”

As if on cue, Harley’s body seemed to liquify. Nate quickly backed up as if scared to get any Harley on his pristine shoes.

The mass beneath her clothes started to bubble and gurgle as it turned into this black steaming pile of goo. The goo laid claim to the clothes and then started to permeate and seep into the ground. A second later all evidence of the vampire’s existence had all but melted underground- the only thing in its wake a small black scorch mark.

I scrunch my nose in disgust at the scene I was just a witness to. Nate just stood there as if it were an everyday occurrence. 

“That looks pretty dead to me!” I exclaimed, struggling to keep the bile in my throat from rising any more. In the span of five minutes I’d been almost killed by a vampire, met a guy whose age I couldn’t see, seen a puppet show, and watched a corpse melt.

“Don’t worry newbie, she’ll come back. They always do.”

I didn’t know how to respond to that.

“She’ll rise again at the spot where she first died and became a vampire.” Nate stated matter-of-a-factly. 

“Great,” I replied back rolling my eyes,” because that clears *everything* up!”

“Hey listen, Man, I heard the tail end of that conversation. Seems to me we’ve got something in common. You live around here?” He asked nonchalantly, as if he hadn’t just used The Force on one of my previous bar patrons and disposed of the evidence in one fell swoop.

I nodded my head behind me, gesturing to Marty’s. “I sleep upstairs.”

Nate wiped his hand under his nose as he sniffed in a quick breath of air. “Perfect. I could use a drink.” 

***

Somehow I, Henry West, your average bartender at Marty’s, found myself sitting on the edge of a king sized bed next to a very questionable stain in a seedy motel somewhere in backwoods Maine. Don’t ask me how I got here because I’m not so sure myself.

There’s a good chance, however, my journey began after sharing a drink with Nate. Now, normally I don’t condone serving alcohol to minors, but the guy did kinda save my ass from becoming vampire fodder, so it was the least I could do.

After a few shots of bourbon and a long conversation, I learned some things. First, Nate’s full name was Nathaniel Beckett Wallen and he was 19 years old. He’s been kicking vampire ass for 3 years.

Turns out, me and the kid actually have a lot in common. We both had near death experiences for one. Mine wasn’t nearly as bad as his though.

Nathaniel became orphaned when he was 16 after he and his family got into a bad car wreck. Their car had been T-boned by a semi. The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel and lost control of the vehicle. At first they thought everyone in the car had passed away, but by some miracle Nate survived, but barely. I got to see the scar on his right arm from when they had to do reconstructive surgery on it after the accident. I’m sure there were more, but I don’t think he felt comfortable showing them to me. We were still practically strangers to one another.

Nate also had dreamt about the woman in the garden, just like I did. He was able to elaborate more for me though. The garden had a name: The Garden of Mara.

 Mara was the lady in the garden, Nate informed me. She was a goddess, and not just any goddess, The Goddess of Life. She also represents light and good. And apparently when someone dies, their soul gets to rest peacefully in the garden.

More importantly, Nate was able to remember their conversation. He didn’t really tell me what exactly was said, but what he did tell me was that they talked, she hugged him, and sent him back after kissing him on the forehead. 

After that he had the ability to control vampires. Just like how after I almost died, I woke up being able to see people’s ages.

Mara’s Chosen Few. That’s what Nate called us. Now it made sense why Harley called me “A Chosen” earlier.

 He told me we were hand picked by Mara and given our own unique abilities to stop an immensely evil force- her brother.

Weson, The God of Death, was Mara’s complete opposite. Who knew death had such a dorky name by the way?

Basically, he stands for evil and darkness. Before her, was him- all alone in the darkness. Mara brought light into his world, gave him a friend. The two were inseparable at first. She was the Yang to his Ying. Mara even created the garden as their little spot where they could hang together. Then after a while, she got bored and created life.

Apparently he got jealous of her creations since she started spending more of her energy on them than on her own brother. He then tried to gain her attention back by destroying the life she had created. 

Yeah. Weson sent the meteor that killed all the dinosaurs. 

Understandably upset, Mara banished Weson from her garden. Then she created humans in the aftermath of the dinosaurs extinction and made him live on earth amongst her new creations. To rub more salt into the wound, Weson, being the God of Death, has to bring human souls back to the garden when they die. Every time he asked Mara to be let back in and every time she denied him.

Weson eventually became fed up and bitter, so he created vampires out of some of the souls that he collected. Their sole purpose was to torment, drain, and kill other humans. His creatures have the primal desire to hurt his dear sister's creations and suck their life force out of them. The goal, just like with the dinosaurs, is to wipe out the human race, just to see his sister suffer.

In an effort to combat his plot to destroy her world, Mara selected three of her finest humans and turned them into warriors who were meant to fight off the vampire infestation. They were given immunity to vampire bites and had abilities that could stop the blood suckers, but since controlling how a person dies wasn’t within her territory, Mara couldn’t protect her soldiers from death completely. 

That’s why there was such an age gap between me and Nate. There had been others before us, and if they die then another is chosen to take their place. 

Finally, Nate revealed the true purpose of our powers. There was one of The Chosen who could see the true age of a vampire. They were to alert the one who could control vampires long enough to keep them still so that the last Chosen One could light their asses on fire and kill them for good since only light can destroy the darkness- and what better source of light than fire?

We were destined to be a tag team of sorts.

“How do you know all this? Is this what Mara told you?” I had asked Nate after he finished giving me the basic rundown of our situation.

I scratched my chin confused on why in the 17 years since I got my ability, I hadn’t known about any of this. Wouldn’t it have made sense for vampires to want to track me down seeing as I could literally blow their cover? Then again, Harley was none the wiser when she came into the bar, so maybe we smelled like regular-shmegular humans to them.

“More or less,” was all he told me.

“So if there’s supposed to be three of us…?”

“That’s what I was going to ask you, Henry. I’ve been on a mission to eradicate the vampire race for years now and I finally have a solid lead on where The Chosen with the fire ability is. With your ability to pinpoint vamps and my ability to control them, we’ll be able to do a lot of good in this world. We’ll be unstoppable once all three of Mara’s Chosen Few are united. So, are you with me?”

“Wait, does that mean you were looking for me? Have you been looking for me all this time?” I asked frantically, the once dwindling flame of purpose inside me was now a roaring blaze. Had I finally found my people? My purpose? 

Nate shrugged his shoulders playfully, “More or less.”

“Well then Nate,” I stuck my hand out to shake his,” we’re going on a mission!” 

The loud sound of a rumbling muffler pulling into the motel's parking lot broke me out of my daydream. A second later Nate opened the door to our room. 

“Get ready,” he said as a brown ball of clothes was thrown at me. After changing into the light brown khaki costume Nate had given me, I slung the small backpack that carried all the belongings I’d taken from Marty’s with me over my shoulder.

I then stopped and peeked out the open door and took a look at the rust bucket that Nate had pulled up in. “Do we really have to go in that rolling death trap?” I said, pointing to the white kidnapper looking van in the parking lot. “Isn’t that hunk of junk just going to give our position away?”

“Precisely the opposite, Youngblood. That hunk of junk is *exactly* what they’re expecting.” Nate said, patting my shoulder as I exited the musty smelling motel room.

“Can you stop talking to me like that? I’m older than you, Nate. Like a lot older.” I grunted out, annoyed

Nate scoffed. “True, but I have more experience than you.”

He got me there. “Weren’t you ever taught to respect your elders?” I grumbled under my breath.

“Yeah whatever, gramps.” Nate replied back jokingly.

I ran out of clever and witty retorts to say as we piled into the van. Giant baby blue words saying Devilishly Fast Delivery were plastered on either side of the windowless van with little devil horns and a tail accompanying the logo. 

The clothes Nate tossed at me earlier was a Party City delivery driver Halloween costume that Nathan bought. It rode up my crotch uncomfortably as I settled into the passenger seat. He’d gotten me a size too small. We wear the same size but he said they only had one in our size left. Since he bought the costumes and pretty much set everything up, I got stuck with the smaller costume.

A thick folded blue paper landed in my lap, aiding the uncomfortable sensation in my nether regions. I folded it open. It revealed the layout of a large multi floor structure.

“That’s the blueprints for the facility. Look it over. Memorize it. Become one with it. Don’t make me have to come save your ass while we’re in there.” Nate said seriously as he peeled out of the parking lot. We had about an hour drive ahead of us until we got to Marvelous Maddie’s Mental Health Institution. 

That’s where The Chosen with the fire ability was being kept. Nate says her name is Emily Richardson. All he was able to find out was that she’s been locked up in that mental hospital for four years. 

Nate looked over at me nervously. “Let’s go over the plan one more time.”  

I nodded politely. Clearly Nate was used to working alone.

“We’re posing as delivery drivers making a routine medical supply drop off. Once we get inside the facility, our main goal is to find and save Emily.” Nate points to an area on the blueprints that has been circled in red marker. “We’ll most likely find her here in the activities room. My intel shows this is where she spends most of her time.”

“Why take the gamble when this might not even be who we’re looking for?” I asked as I skimmed over the rest of the blueprints. 

“Well, according to my lead, it seems the place is heavily guarded and monitored- mostly at night. The security on the outside seems to be a bit more lax during the day. It also appears that Emily is the only patient in the facility. If that doesn’t scream shady vampires, I don’t know what does.”

“Yeah that is weird,” I replied. “Why would such a big facility only have one patient?”

Nate answered,“They don’t want anyone knowing whatever the hell it is they’re doing to her in there. And by the looks of it, the activities room is in the center of the mental hospital. So we’ll have to be extra careful. That room is probably the most guarded.”

“So, what is your lead for all this?” I asked after a while, trying to make small talk.

“An old employee that used to work there. He’s human and worked on the day shift. I found his post on an internet forum by chance where he detailed his weird experiences while working there. He said there were only a few people on staff during the day that would take care of one single patient. They kept it dark inside the hospital, there were creepy guards stationed everywhere, and every once in a while some of his coworkers would go missing. He managed to escape after he saw his friend get dragged away by ‘a creature with very sharp teeth’.”

“A vampire.” I whispered under my breath.

Nate drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. “That’s what I’m hoping for. If there’s vampires swarming the place we’ll know we hit the jackpot!”

“I don’t get it.” I said as I cupped a hand behind my head. “If you can control the vampires and get rid of them for a while, what exactly do you need me for? Sure I can see their ages and everything, but you’ve made it this long without my help. I don’t think I’ll be able to help all that much.”

Nate sighed, disappointedly. “Henry, I won’t be able to do this without you. Your ability, it’s more useful than you know.”

“Really?” I asked, not quite believing him. I mean the kid has three years of vampire hunting experience under his belt and I only just found out the truth about my ability.

“Yes, really,” he chuckled. “Did you know that the older the vampire, the more powerful they become?”

I messed with a hangnail on my finger absentmindedly. “No. I don’t really know much about them other than what I’ve seen from movies and stuff.”

“Well, most lore in the media is wrong. I’ll tell you that right now.”

My mind flashed back to Harley’s body melting into the ground in a dark goo. A shiver crept up my spine at the memory. “Clearly.”

“Anyway, Henry, my point is that if when we get in there and the place is crawling with vamps, your job is to direct me to the oldest ones so I can get rid of them. They’re the ones we need to be on the lookout for. If you want to make it out alive, you’ll do what I say, yeah?”

I nodded my head in understanding, “Look for the oldest ones. Got it.”

Nate reached behind him suddenly, causing him to swerve in the road a little bit. A second later there’s a wooden stick in his hand that has been sharpened at the end. He handed it to me.

“Is this a wooden stake?” I asked incredulously.

He shrugged his shoulders. “I said most of the lore was incorrect, not all of it. One hit to the heart with one of these puppies and they’ll explode into dust!”

“Thanks?”

“What? You didn’t think I would send you in there alone without protection did you?”

I didn’t say anything as I looked my new weapon over, inspecting it. It was a simple weapon really. It wasn’t too heavy and I had a good grip on it with my hands. It was the thought of actually destroying one of these monsters that made me uneasy. I’d never done it before. Harley was going to leave me in that alley, but Nathan was the one that sent her back to her death spot or whatever. Either way I was in no serious danger then.

Nate noticed my look of unease.

“Hey,” he said,”We’re going to be fine alright. we’re going to rescue Emily and get out of there unscathed. We’re The Chosen Few, remember?”

“Yeah,” I said, feeling a little more confident in myself. “We’re The Chosen Few.”

*** 
Nate turned down a dirt road that we rode for about three miles before the trees on the left side of the road cleared up revealing a large meadow with a magnificently built Mansion right in the middle. It was Greco-Roman style and reminded me of the White House. The whole property was surrounded by six foot high metal fencing with barbed wire on top. 

We passed a big sign that read ‘Marvelous Maddie’s Mental Health Institution’ in big yellow letters. There was a smiley face graphic on the upper right corner that also looked like a sun.

The van slowly skidded to a stop as we reached the gated entrance. There were two guards stationed out front on either end of the gate. They held rifles in their hands.

They were just regular humans from what I could tell. One guard was 27 years old and the other was 38, respectively. 

“Don’t say anything. Act normal.” Nate instructed as he started to roll down the driver's side window.

“State your business.” Guard One demanded.

Nate leaned down the side of the vehicle to hand the man a card. I have no idea what it said on it.

Nonchalantly he went,“Just here for a routine delivery, sir.”

The guard looked at the card and scoffed before flicking it to the ground. “You’re late.”

“Got stuck in traffic, sir. You know how it can be sometimes.” Nate had a small smile on his lips. If he was nervous, he didn’t look like it.

A tense moment of silence passed before Guard One nodded to Guard Two. Guard Two then pulled out some sort of scanning device.

“Alright then,” Guard One said as he took a step back,” We’re just going to scan your load to confirm.”

Woah, woah, what? As far as I knew the back of this van was empty and had no boxes. I thought Nate went to go pick it up because he rented it from somebody not an actual delivery service. 

Nate shot me a testing glance as he noticed the panicked look in my eye. He shot me a look that said “don’t do anything stupid”.

I tried to refocus my nervous energy and redirected it towards my hands. I clutched the arm rest until my knuckles went white, preparing to be shot to death. 

A chime sound rang out and Guard Two walked back into position. His scanner thing was glowing green at the end.

Guard One slapped the side of the truck twice before saying,“You’re good to go.”

Guard Two pressed a button and the gates slid open for the delivery van to drive through.

Relief flooded my body as Nate drove down an even windier road down to the mental hospital.

“Like I told you, Henry,” Nate chuckled, “This is *exactly* what they were expecting.”

A sudden pit formed in my stomach. I didn’t like the implications that were behind that statement. It was then that I realized Nate could be one scary hell of a dude. 

Two orderlies waited for us inside the delivery bay when we pulled up. One was a guy and the other a girl. They both wore white scrubs.

 I quickly slipped my wooden stake on the inside of my khaki jumpsuit when I got a look at their ages.

“Guy on your left is a vampire. He’s 150.” I whispered to Nate as we got out of the vehicle.

He gave a curt nod to let me know he heard me.

“Well,” he started as opened the back of the van up, revealing several boxes of medical supplies,” it’s been a long drive for the both of us. Mind showing the way to the bathroom?”

The girl nodded her head politely as she pointed down a nearby corridor. “The restrooms are down that hall. Should be the last door on the left.”

Nate and I thanked the woman as we briskly made our way deeper into the facility.

“Why didn’t you dust that vamp?” I asked.

“Because he wasn’t alone. That woman was there.” He answered. 

“What if he kills her?”

“He won’t.” Nate reassured me. “Not if he doesn’t want to bring in all those boxes by himself.”

I nodded and we continued our way past the bathrooms and to the activities room. 

The hospital itself was pretty barren. It was eerily quiet except for the buzzing of the luminescent lights installed in the ceiling. That only added to the creepy ambience.

Nate’s lead wasn’t lying about them keeping it dark in there. As we got closer to the middle of the building, lights became sparse and every window we passed was covered with thick black out curtains. We were definitely in the right place.

Every now and then we would encounter a stray blood sucker or two. I would yell the age of the vampire I saw and then point. Nate would do his thing and the vampire would melt into the ground, being sent back to the spot they died and became a vampire.

If I remembered the blueprints correctly, we should’ve been down the hall from the activities room. 

Nate stopped me suddenly, his hand pushing my chest back. “Something doesn’t feel right.” He told me.

“What do you mean?”

“This all feels… too easy. We’ve only come across a couple of vamps and our prize is right down the hall behind a single door.”

“You’re right.” I confirmed as a pit started to form in my stomach. This didn’t seem right at all. Not if they were guarding the one person that could actually kill a vampire once and for all.

“Get in the activities room and check on Emily,” Nate said as he placed a hand on my shoulder. “I’m going to go check things out.”

Before I could protest the split up and go along with him, Nate was already halfway back to the corridor entrance we had just come from.

I grabbed the stake I had safely tucked away and armed myself with it as I cautiously made my way closer to the closed doors that should lead to the activities room. All I had to do was walk around a corner and I’d be there. With each step I took, the more this feeling of dread consumed me. Something bad was going to happen and Nate wouldn’t be there to save me. 

I was about ten paces away from my destination when, out of nowhere, this older gentleman with salt and peppered hair stepped out from the corner. He looked like a butler as he had a handlebar mustache and was wearing a tailcoat suit and a pair of white pristine gloves on his hands.

I took a step back as I saw his age. My eyes went ride as I read the number 750. That meant this guy had to have been alive during the god damn *Crusades*!

“There you are!” He smiled menacingly, fangs out and everything. “We’ve been expecting you.”

Stunned, I launched towards the vampire, my stake at the ready, directing my aim towards his heart. 

I went in for the kill but was suddenly thrown back by the man’s immense strength. I crashed into a wall where I’m pretty sure I cracked a rib- or three. He was ten times stronger than Harley was back in the alley.

I tried to pick myself up, to continue to fight, but the 750 year old butler vampire was faster and threw me back onto the ground. I reached for my wooden stake but she stomped on it and crushed it to pieces. He stomped on my hand too, for good measure.

He looked down at me with this fake look of pity on his face. “I’ve always despised you Chosen Few. You always did fuck with my fun.” He snarled in my ear. His hand was firm on my shoulder keeping me to the ground. “It’ll be fun to watch you die.”

“You can’t bite me.” I strained out, painfully.

He chuckled. “Oh need not to worry, young Chosen One. I’ve got just the remedy for that little problem.”

Gramps reached behind his tailcoat and pulled something out. A metallic click filled my ears as he cocked a revolver. My stomach did a backflip.

Another sinister smile filled his face. “Say good night!”

I clutched my eyes closed and prepared for the end. Where was Nate when I needed him, huh? Why’d I have to get stuck with the lame power to see people’s ages? All it did in the end was let me know that I was going to die by the hands of a very old, very powerful vampire. I was useless. My existence was useless. 

This was it. This was the bitter end. Me cowering on the floor as a vampire laughed maniacally as he readied to shoot me to death.

*”No. This is not the end!”* a voice, not my own, screamed in my mind.

Suddenly, an intense electrical feeling coiled through my spine. My body went rigid, then into overdrive and I managed to stand up. This intense feeling flooded my veins. It was a mixture of energy, anger, and *power*. A feeling I’d never felt before. It was almost intoxicating.

He tried to come at me again, but another jolt of electricity shot through me and Gramps the vampire was stuck in place. I looked down at my hand, out in front of me. Like I was using The Force.

“No.” He said in disbelief. He tried to make a run for it, but was unable to move from the spot I’d glued him in.

Instinctively, I flicked my wrist.

With a sickening crunch, every bone in the man’s body shattered into a million pieces. His deformed body skin shell fell to the well polished linoleum floors. It’s like right as he hit the floor he started turning to black smokey goo.

I barely had time to process what just happened before I was alerted to another’s presence.

“What the-?” Another vampire said as he peeked around the same corner Gramps had come from.  He looked much younger than the other vampire with long blonde hair and blue eyes.He gave off surfer dude vibes.

My hand flexed out again suddenly, directed at the 400 year old vampire who’d just witnessed me kill one of his kind.

“Boss, is everything all right?” I heard another vamp say from further down the hall.

The vampire in front of me stared at me with scared wide eyes.

“Everything’s fine,” I whispered, a hastily formed idea filling my mind. “Go back to your post.”

“Everything’s fine,” he said back, repeating me. “Go back to your post.”

“If you say so, boss.” The other vampire said as the sound of his retreating footfalls filled the hallway.

“This is not the droid you’re looking for.” I said, quoting Star Wars, as I waved my hand in front of the vampire's face. He blinked lazily before walking back to where he came from. 

I stood there for a second, my brain trying to wrap itself around everything that just happened in the past three minutes.

The scorch spot left of the 750 year old vampire I just kinda killed was… something, for sure.

But more importantly, if Nate was The only Chosen who could control vampires, what in the *hell* did I just do?
