This is an update. Part one can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/ShlWqJ8Ec0)



When Jake came home yesterday morning, he asked me why the porch was covered in cat food. I had no idea what he meant, so I nervously opened the front door and looked. The entire bowl was flipped over, and bits of crushed cat food were spread across the entirety of our porch. It looked like someone had dumped the bowl out and proceeded to stomp all the food into dusty bits. The cat food on the back porch was completely untouched.

I tried to explain everything that had happened while Jake was gone. I guess the idea of a meowing monster tormenting his wife sat very strangely with him, so he pulled up our ring camera and tried to review the footage taken at around 2 am.

I was honestly too afraid to watch it. I just waited in silence for him to finish.
He definitely looked disturbed by what he saw, but he was clearly not convinced it was a monster.
“Some teenager must be pulling a fucked up prank on us.” He decided. “You should move both cat food bowls to the back porch from now on.”

I argued the idea. What would moving the food do about this dude sitting at our window, meowing like a crazy person? I told him I wanted to leave the house all together.

Jake sighed. “You know we can't move right now. All of our money is tied up in this place and the lease we signed isn't up for another 6 months.”
“Fuck the lease.” I said indignantly. “I want to feel safe in my living room without someone or something looking into it.” 

We argued for a bit longer than I want to admit before I had to give up. In the end, he was right.  We have nowhere else to go so soon. The nearest hotel is a good hour and a half drive from Jake's machinist job.

If I wanted to move that badly, he agreed we would look into places and move once our lease was up. In the meantime, he agreed to get new living room curtains, and upgrade us to a ring doorbell instead of the one we have just sitting inside our living room.

The rest of the day was pretty uneventful. I went to work and came home with new curtains. I picked a dark brown shade that let in basically no light. It's a terrible choice for a living room, but it would block out any chance of seeing a shadow at night.

I got home to find Bella had not touched her food all day. She was curled up in a pile of clothes in our laundry room sleeping. I tried to let her outside to go potty, and she refused to go out until I went out there with her.

While we were out, Toby the orange tabby stopped by for a bite and rubbed on Bella’s leg. She seemed to enjoy his effection, until he meowed up at her. Then Bella growled at him. That shocked me and Toby both. Bella never growled at Toby before. She has never growled at ANY cat. Bella loves cats. I took her inside and she went back to sleep in the laundry room again.

I also decided to stop sitting in the living room at night. Before Jake left for work I gathered everything I would need for food and entertainment before basically locking myself in our room until Jake got home. Bella came with me of course. I turned the TV up as loud as I could reasonably put it, hoping I would drown out any noise if my night visitor decided to come back.

It was once again around 2 am when I heard a faint dragging sound coming from below. Like I said before, my bedroom is right above the porch. Bella woke up from her comfortable sleep at my side and started shaking. I turned up the TV and hoped I could just wait it out.

I could not. After a few minutes, there was a loud BANG. Bella whimpered.
I reminded myself of what Jake said. It was just some kid playing a prank. I wasn't sure I believed his idea though. 

BANG BANG BANG BANG. The noises grew louder. It sounded almost like someone was smacking their hands on the side of my house in frustration. Like the stranger could hear my TV drowning out their intrusion, and that made them angry. I turned the volume louder.

BANG BANG. The sound slapped at the old paneling of my house, only getting louder with the TV volume. The force of the hits were shaking my walls. I started to fear this person would try to break into the house if I didn't respond to them. I reluctantly muted my television and crept toward the window.
Once again I only opened it about a fingers width.

“Go away” I tried to sound braver than I felt. My dog shook behind me so hard it reminded me of how she acted on the fourth of July when fireworks went off.

There was an eerie silence that followed my demand. I wondered if I had surprised the person by actually speaking to them. 

All I did was make things worse. 

“Go away” The voice that repeated me from outside almost made me piss my pants. It sounded garbled and wet. Like someone was talking with a mouthful of water. 

“Go away go away go away go away go awaaaaaaaaay” each time it repeated my words, it sounded more like my voice. Like it was practicing talking like me.

The banging started up again.

BANG.
“Go away” it mocked.
BANG BANG. 
“Go”
BANG BANG BANG.
“Awaaaaaaay”

A dragging sound. More dragging. The sound dragged its away along the outside of my house back and forth until it stopped directly below my window. I wanted to crawl back to the bed and hide myself under the covers like a child. Isnt that always the best way to hide from monsters?


BANG BANG BANG BANG. The sound was rapidly climbing its way up the side of my house, getting louder as it approached. I managed to let go of the window and shove the curtain back in place just before I heard something SLAP onto glass.
I fell on back on my ass and stared at the curtain in shock and horror.

From other other side of the window I heard it's voice.

“Meow.”

I scrambled up from the floor and fucking ran, booking it down the hallway and into the bathroom. Bella ran almost ahead of me as I went. I slammed that door behind us and locked it. I didn't care that I had left my phone in the bed, all I cared about was that this bathroom had a lock and no fucking windows.

Bella and I stayed in that bathroom with the lights on all night long until Jake got home. He wanted to know why I didn't answer when he called me around 3 am on his break.

Jake doesn't seem to really beleive what i told him. He's treating me like I had some kind of nightmare while he was gone at work.

But I know what happened. Something crawled up the side of my house last night and tried to look in at me. Something that slapped at my windows and spoke in my voice. I wasn't asleep. And it wasn't a dream.

I know this for a fact. Because in the light of day I went back into that horrible bedroom and looked at that window. I saw the greasy proof that coated the outside of the glass window.

There's a handprint on it.
