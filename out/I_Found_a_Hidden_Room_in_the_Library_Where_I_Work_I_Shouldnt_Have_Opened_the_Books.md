I’ve worked at my local library for almost three years now. It’s nothing glamorous—small town, dusty stacks, and the faint smell of mildew no matter how much Febreze you spray. I work the closing shift most nights, which usually means I spend hours alone with nothing but bookshelves and my headphones. But last week, I found something I can’t explain.

I was doing my usual end-of-shift routine: locking up, making sure nobody was hiding in the bathroom stalls (it’s happened before), and checking the basement archives.

Why’ll down in the basement I noticed something strange. One of the old metal shelves was slightly crooked, leaning out at an angle. At first, I thought it was just warped from age, but when I pushed on it, the whole thing shifted backward. Behind it was a narrow, dark passageway.

I stood there for a while, trying to convince myself not to go in. I even told myself it was probably just a old utility closet. But my curiosity got the better of me.

The passage led to a small, windowless room. The walls were lined with old small wooden book shelves. They were packed with books I’d never seen before—leather-bound, old, with no titles on the spines. A single bulb hanging from the ceiling barely lit the space, but I could see enough to know these books were much older than anything they have upstairs.

I pulled one off the shelf at random. It was heavy, and the cover was unmarked except for a single embossed symbol that looked like an eye. The pages were filled with dense handwriting, diagrams, and strange illustrations.

The title on the first page read: “Practical Applications of the Unseen.”

I flipped through, trying to make sense of it. Most of it was gibberish—equations that didn’t add up, sentences written in languages I couldn’t identify. But there were instructions, too, written in English. One section caught my attention: “To glimpse beyond the veil.”

The instructions were simple. Light a candle, place a mirror at a 45-degree angle, and recite the words printed below. It sounded ridiculous, like some creepypasta ritual from the early 2000s, but I was alone in a library so why not?

I brought the book upstairs, grabbed an  hand mirror from the lost-and-found box, and lit one of the emergency candles we kept at the front desk. I set it all up on a reading table and began to read the words aloud.

At first, nothing happened. I felt stupid, sitting there chanting in a dead-silent library. But then the room got colder. The candle’s flame flickered violently, even though there was no draft. I looked into the mirror and froze.

Behind my reflection, something moved.

It wasn’t clear at first, just a dark shape shifting in the background. I turned around, but there was nothing behind me. When I looked back into the mirror, the figure was closer—tall, with long, twisted limbs that bent in ways they shouldn’t. Its face was indistinct, like static on an old TV, but I could feel it watching me.

I dropped the mirror. It shattered on the floor, and the thing was gone. The candle’s flame steadied, and the room warmed up. I tried to convince myself it was a trick of the light, my imagination running wild, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been there.

Now, every night at the library, I feel like I’m being watched. The shadows between the shelves seem darker, heavier. Sometimes, when I’m closing up, I hear faint whispers coming from the basement.

The worst part? A few days ago, I found another book from that hidden room. Not in the basement, but on a return cart upstairs. I’m the only one who knows about that room, and I sure as hell didn’t bring it up.

I went back to the hidden room the next night. I told myself it was to put the book back, but I couldn’t resist opening another one. This one was thinner, its cover marked with a spiral. Inside were instructions for something called “The Listening Ritual.”

I know it sounds stupid, but maybe by performing this Ritual I can banish whatever I summon with the last one. What do you guys think I should do?
