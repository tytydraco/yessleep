I am the sole survivor from a town called Headstone, a small settlement in the mountains of northern Idaho, completely isolated for miles around by wild and untamed forests stretching out in every direction.

I lived there from the moment I was born, until around 9pm last night, when the police, or army, or whoever it was, tried to evacuate the entire population in one swift and disastrous operation.

When I say my town was probably the single worst place to live in the United States, I’m not exaggerating at all.

Where else in the US, or the world for that matter, do the trees roam the streets at night, killing whatever moves?

Besides that, Headstone also had pretty foul-smelling drinking water, which sometimes escaped the faucet with a murky brown color, and I haven’t even mentioned the fact that we had to venture miles and miles away from town just to get food, as no wild animals dared roam the forests surrounding us on all sides.

Every waking moment in that place was filled with a dreaded suspense, a feeling of constantly being watched by unseen eyes peering out from the darkness, along with the false sense of hopefulness that if you do as you’re told and follow the rules, you’ll be safe.

But rules can only stretch so far before they are broken.

Headstone’s dark secret, which my grandparents and their grandparents died to keep hidden, and which I am now revealing, is that this small settlement in the mountains of northern Idaho was either built on, or later became, the hunting ground of the twisted predators that have tormented the town for decades. Generations.

I’m only revealing this age-old secret to you now because, as I type, I can hear the bombs falling in the distance, like faint thunderclaps descending from the hills.

Out my window, I can see the thin black column of smoke and ash, as the forest burns with those horrible creatures still inside it.

This morning, August 17th 2025, began in a blur.

I had awoken from a dreadful nightmare. I was running, sprinting through the forest with other town residents. My wife was there. So was my daughter, her small arms wrapped tightly around my neck as I held her.

I soon came to accept that it wasn’t a nightmare, but my pained memories of the past night.

By the time I had my wits about me, and I had come to terms with the fact that the events of my nightmare had actually taken place, and that my wife, child, and my friends were all gone, I finally remembered what was now going to happen.

Shortly after waking up this morning, I was asked by a group of people calling themselves 'police' if they could ‘interview’ me about my experiences from my hospital bed. For some reason, I agreed.

It felt more like an interrogation.

“I suppose you want me to start from the very beginning.”

*“That would be very helpful, Hector.”*

Ms Williams leaned forwards in her seat and set the small voice recorder down on the bedside table beside my hospital bed.

Her voice was kind, but I figured it was a façade. I knew what she had been through, who she had lost, and that she probably resented me for being the one to live.

I’m fine with that, because I hate that woman more than she could ever hate me. I hate her for what she did, for the lives she had a part in ending, my wife and daughter among them.

I swallowed, glancing first at her, and then the other people standing or sitting elsewhere in my room. Five in total.

Three were adorned in camouflage uniforms, while the other two were dressed simply in white shirts and loosened ties, as if they had left their offices to come here. To hear me speak.

“Are we safe here”, I asked with my nerves playing in my voice.

*“Yes, perfectly safe. Your town is miles away now, Hector, and so are those creatures. They won’t come here, to this hospital, to this city.”*

Williams sounded resolute, but I knew she wasn’t. She couldn’t possibly know that they would stay away. Not after last night.

One of the men at the back spoke up.

*“Calm down. We’re smoking them out as we speak. They’ll be ashes by sun-down.”*

As the sun lifted itself into the sky, rising above the distant hills, the men’s shadows were cast onto the long wall adjacent to my bed.

The dark silhouetted side profiles looked down at me, watching, judging. The long shadows reminded me of the creatures which had tormented me and my family for as long as any of us had lived. Longer. A shiver took me.

“To tell you the truth, I don’t fully know when the ‘very beginning’ really was. From the moment I was born, there were rules in place for us all. I don’t know who originally figured them out, or how many people got themselves killed before they did figure them out.”

*“What rules are you talking about?”*

The voice belonged to one of the camouflaged men, but I didn’t look to see which of them had said it. I directed my answer to all of them.

“Laws we followed in order to survive the creatures that stalked our town. Headstone's predators were predictable enough that we could survive them simply by being careful enough. We didn’t have a sheriff, or a mayor, or any courthouse or jail. We didn’t need any of those. In a place like that, there are no criminals."

"Just the rules our parents taught us, and their parents before them, and I’m presuming their parents before them, but after that I’m not sure.”

I watched as Ms Williams gave a glance to the men across the room. Their faces gave little away, but their eyes, confused and impatient, met the gaze of Williams and, without a word uttered, their thoughts were made known to her. She turned back to face me and made those thoughts known to me.

*“OK, Hector, we need more specifics. This is all a lot to wrap our heads around so if you could break it down a little.”*

I looked at her. I was thinking of a thousand different things to say to her, and to the men around me, but none of my thoughts materialised themselves into words, so instead I simply nodded and sighed.

The sun was still rising outside. Some birds were singing. I realised how much I had missed the sounds of bird song in my town, where birds refused to go.

I closed my eyes, still heavy with the sleep I had woken from not two hours earlier, and breathed low and deep. My cheek was dry and rough with the memory of fallen tears. My feet still ached from running and burned with blisters now wrapped tightly in bandages.

I breathed out once more, and my lip trembled as it escaped. When my eyes opened, I started to talk.

Not because I wanted anyone in the room to hear me, or for my testimony to be recorded by these people. I spoke because I had to. Because someone had to. Because we had a story to tell, but I didn’t know, at the time, who was still alive to tell it.

As I write this, it’s been about thirty minutes since we finished a three-hour interview session and, as Ms Williams and the other suits were leaving my room, I managed to pinch the little voice recorder out of her coat pocket, meaning I now have access to the three audio recordings from our interview today.

I don’t know how long I have before she comes back for it, if she even does, but it’s going to be very useful to help me document my experience here.

For the purposes of this telling, I’m going to transcribe pretty much everything I said during those three recordings, because all of it is important, and it needs to get out. Strap in.

**RECORDING ONE**

“For 31 years, my entire life, I lived in a town called Headstone. It was creatively named that by someone long ago who apparently found something amusing about the fact that people would periodically go missing during the night, taken into the woods by strange creatures, never to be seen again."

"Adults, children, babies. They were indiscriminate. Pets were notorious for going missing, so much so that most people stopped owning them altogether."

"Our town had a population of about 200, and most of the people who lived there were born there. Plenty of people moved in over the years, but only to live with family members or lovers. People who knew the rules, and could keep an eye on the newcomer so they didn’t end up wandering outside at night."

"Most of the residents of the town owned their houses, and those who didn’t rented from landlords who were also residents. This meant that very few clueless strangers could buy or rent a property in the town. I know a lot of that happened in the past, and a lot of people died as a result."

*“Why didn’t everyone just pack up and leave, if it was so dangerous to live there?”*

“Good question, Ms. Well, we were trying to keep the Seizers all in one place. We knew that in the past, when more people were moving away from Headstone, the creatures would start to stray a little further afield in search of food."

"People long before our time, before even my parent’s time, decided that the best thing we could do as human beings was to remain in the town to protect the other towns and cities neighbouring us, miles and miles away, which were populated by people blissfully unaware of the dangers of walking outside at night, or even standing on your porch after sunset."

"Imagine the deaths. The screams…”

*“Did I hear you right when you just called them ‘Seizers’?”*

“Ah, it’s nice to finally hear one of you guys speak! I was beginning to forget you were sitting over there in your camouflage."

"Fair enough, it’s about time I should start to talk about the Seizers. Yes, that's what we call them. Always have. Ms Williams has already had a few run-ins with Seizers these past few days, so she can speak to the truth of my claims, and no doubt you guys have also seen a picture of video of them at the very least, especially after last night."

"We don’t know where they came from or how long they’ve been here, so don’t bother asking me. They only hunt at night, or used to, preying largely on people."

"Most of our casualties have been children, because they are the most unruly. You tell a kid not to play out in the street after dark, but the kid really likes the idea of playing outside once all the adults have gone to bed."

"Children of a certain age are like that by nature. You tell them not to do something, and suddenly they want to do exactly that."

"His parents warned him not to go out, but he figured he could do a couple laps of the street if he was quiet enough, and the monsters wouldn’t catch him."

"He sneaks out. His parents are partly to blame for not keeping an eye on their son, and for not keeping the door key out of his reach. He starts riding up and down the street, making as little noise as he can. He likes how quiet it is."

"The people in the houses he passes by can hear his wheels rolling and his bike chain creaking. Their curtains are drawn, and they can’t see who it is, but they nonetheless shed a silent tear for the child."

"The kid is having a blast, oblivious of the eyes watching him from the darkness."

"If only he had noticed them, maybe he could have turned back before it was too late. But, as the story goes, he didn’t notice them, and he didn’t turn back."

"And they got him."

"We barely used to see them at all, back when people and pets were getting taken every few months. But once the landlords stopped letting strangers move in, and parents took better care of their children, there weren’t as many idiots leaving the house after dark, and the Seizers slowly started to run out of food."

"By the spring of 2024, we noticed a change in their behaviour. They had probably either eaten or scared off every animal in the forest, so now Headstone was their sole source of sustenance."

"At first, they started looting cars and going through our trash at night, looking for scraps of food, but that didn’t last long."

"The first time I saw one of the things during the day, it was me and my… my wife. We were at the park with our daughter. There were a few other families there too. One of the hottest days of the year up to that point and we all wanted to enjoy it."

"I stood with my close friend Dan and his wife Lilly, watching our kids take turns on the small metal slide in the middle of the park’s crude play area. The sounds of laughter filled the air, along with the creaking of a swing set that hadn’t been well-oiled since last Fall."

"The park was at the edge of town, across the street from a tall chain link fence which separated Headstone from the forest which began a few yards behind the fence."

"I don’t remember whether I saw it first or whether Dan had pointed first and then I saw it but, from what I remember, we both saw it at pretty much the same time. We, as well as every other adult at the park that day, had their bodies facing the woods. Our parents taught us to never turn our backs to the trees, so we didn’t.

"And good job we didn’t. Dan’s hand went up and his finger extended, pointing out something amidst the trees. Like I said, I saw it through the corner of my eye just as his hand was going up."

"Within five seconds, every parent was staring at the Seizer, which was staring back at us. Its body looked like the bark of a tree, with a rough and jagged surface which probably made hiding and stalking through the forest a lot easier for it. It might be some kind of camouflage but, to all of us there that day, it just looked like a walking tree trunk."

"On the other hand, it was a light shade of grey and, with its tall and thin, elongated frame, it resembled a birch tree more than the pines we lived near."

"The eyes that watched us were the darkest, deepest black I have ever seen. Blacker than the night sky, than the bottom of the ocean, than the dark maw of its toothless mouth, hung slightly open as it looked down at us from a height of easily 20 feet."

"We watched it for about half a minute. No one screamed or said anything. We had seen drawings and photos taken over the years, but they were all dark and blurry, taken at night by a photographer trying desperately to get their shot before being seen."

"But those stills hadn’t prepared us for the sight of one up close in broad daylight."

"By this point, even the children were looking up in stunned silence. Then, another Seizer came. It strode up to the edge of the treeline with steps that looked heavy, but made no sound."

"We watched as its black eyes found us, then we watched as its mouth loosened and slid slightly open."

"At that point, our children were crying and running back to their parents, who broke free from their primal instinct to freeze in the face of a predator they know they can’t escape."

"‘But, the Seizers follow their rules’, we said to ourselves. ‘They don’t hunt during the day’. And yet, by the end of the year, that rule of theirs had been tossed to the wind.”
