(A video of Park Ranger Sealy sitting in his patrol vehicle)

"Hey, so I got this new job recently and so I think I might start recording my day-to-day. Might make it a series or something. I heard of some cryptids in the park I work in, Purtis Creek if you're wondering. So this will be my first video and will mainly just be me running radar."

(The video switches to Dashcam footage of his car parked facing the road and a camera facing him in the car he has a laptop open and is watching shows until a beep. He looks up and goes forward and pulls out. he flips on his lights and sirens and pulls over a white Honda Civic. He grabs his radio and presses the PTT)

"1R-32 to Dispatch I've got a 10-11 on a White Honda Civic on a dirt road just off of FM 316 N. It's just next to a tree farm."

(It Switches over to Body cam video showing Ranger Sealy walks up to the side of the vehicle)

Ranger Sealy: "Good evening Ma'am I'm Park Ranger Sealy, How's your day going?"

Unknown Female 1: "Good Officer, May I ask why I'm being pulled over today?"

Ranger Sealy: "Sure thing, you were speeding a bit back there, you in a rush or anything?"

Unknown Female 1: "Yeah, I just drive so much sometimes I lose track of my speed. I'm sorry."

Ranger Sealy: "Alrighty then Ma'am, may I have your license, registration, and proof of insurance please?"

Unknown Female 1: "Sure thing."

(She gives Ranger Sealy all of the papers he asked for. He walks back to his vehicle and runs all of it through his computer. He then writes her a warning for speeding and walks back up to her window)

Ranger Sealy: "Alrighty here's your stuff, and a warning. You're free to go when I turn my lights off."

(He hands her all the papers and walks back to his vehicle and turns the lights off she turns back onto the road and drives away. The video cuts to Ranger Sealy back in the same position he was originally)

Ranger Sealy: "This job is pretty peaceful, I kind of like it."

(It begins with Ranger Sealy in his car watching shows on his laptop)

Ranger Sealy: "I love this part."

Ranger Sealy: "There it i-."

(Ranger Sealy is cut off by a scream that sounded like a woman. He pauses the video and looks around)

Ranger Sealy: "Holy crap what was that."

(The crickets stop and everything is silent except for Ranger Sealy's car idling. He ignores it before a few minutes later another scream is let out but this time it's further.)

Ranger Sealy: "What the shit?! Wait a minute. There's this Native American legend that it could be a Skinwalker or something. I think if it's further away it sounds the closer it is. Fuck this I'm getting out of here."

(He pulls out and away from the spot and back to the station)

Ranger Sealy: "I don't know what it was man. It sounded like a woman screaming but it was just, not human."

Ranger Henderson: "That's bullshit, you probably just are hearin' shit."

(An old man of Native American descent appears by the two talking.)

Unknown Native American: "I heard it too."

(The two park rangers spin over to see him both startled by him.)

Unknown Native American: "It's not just the Skin Walkers. There is so much more. The things that are out there... You don't even want to know."

Ranger Sealy: "Can we deal with them?"

(The Native Man disappears and in his place, a bowl of white ash sits and instructions on it.)

Ranger Henderson: "I guess that answers your question."

(It begins with Ranger Sealy and Ranger Henderson sitting in the front seat of a patrol car driving down a road)

Ranger Henderson: "So is this the place?"

Ranger Sealy: "I guess so"

Ranger Henderson: "Alrighty, Stay close. If you see something, say something."

Ranger Sealy: "Alright."

(Ranger Sealy and Ranger Henderson step out of the car and lock it. They move on foot both carrying Modded AR-15s They walk for a few bit before stopping because of an abandoned cabin they both shine lights at the cabin before they are rushed by a creature they didn't care what is was or what it did all they knew was.. It wasn't human. Both Rangers had mag-dumped it even after it hit the ground. they both reloaded and cautiously went up to it. Now after inspecting it, they knew it definitely wasn't human. But whatever it was didn't matter anymore. It was dead.)

Ranger Sealy: "Fuck."

Ranger Henderson: "It's not the only one. I assure you of it."

(The Native Man appeared behind them)
