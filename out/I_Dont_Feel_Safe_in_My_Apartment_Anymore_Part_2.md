I didn’t go to work yesterday.

After posting here, I kept telling myself I just needed time to think. That if I stayed home long enough, something would click into place and explain what had happened. But the truth was simpler than that. I didn’t want to leave the apartment. I didn’t trust it empty.

I read through the comments again yesterday morning. A few people joked about how they wished someone would do their laundry for them. Others tried to make it lighter, like this was just an inconvenience or a misunderstanding.

I tried to see it that way. I really did.

But none of them were thinking about what it meant to wake up and realise someone had been moving around your home while you slept.

The clothes hadn’t just appeared.

They’d been taken off me while I slept. Washed. Laid out neatly for me to find.

I don’t have a washing machine in my apartment.

Which meant someone must have taken them out, then brought them back in again.

The only place they could have done that was the laundry room.

It’s in the basement, at the end of a narrow corridor that always smells faintly of soap and warm metal. Officially it closes at eleven, but no one really enforces that.

I told myself I would go down there just to check. To see if there were any signs at all of what had happened.

I stood at the top of the basement stairs longer than I should have, my hand on the railing. The building was quiet in that hollow daytime way it gets after everyone leaves for work.

Before I reached the bottom, I could hear a washer running.

That was a bit strange. It was the middle of the day. Most people do their laundry on weekends or late at night.

The sound was coming from the machine in the far corner. The one people avoid because it rattles too loudly during the spin cycle. I’d used it once or twice when the others were full, but never regularly.

I looked around the room, but there was nothing that explained what had happened in my apartment the night before. I stayed in the doorway until the cycle finished.

When it did, the lid unlocked with a soft click.

It wasn’t mine, but I looked inside anyway.

When I peered in, my stomach dropped.

Inside were my clothes. The same ones that had been in my bedroom.

All of them.

Not wet. Not piled together. Not tangled.

Folded carefully, exactly the way they’d been arranged on the chair in my bedroom.

Including the extra shirt.

Seeing it there made my chest tighten.

I didn’t touch anything. I backed away from the machine and went straight upstairs. I locked my door and sat on the edge of the bed, trying to make sense of what I had just seen.

Last night, I stayed awake on purpose.

I didn’t lie down. I didn’t even sit. I paced the apartment with all the lights on, checking the time every few minutes just to keep myself anchored.

Nothing happened.

No folded clothes.  
No unfamiliar shirt.  
Just exhaustion.

Sometime after midnight, I realised I was standing in the middle of the living room, staring at the wall. My phone was still in my hand, the screen dimmed from inactivity.

I couldn’t remember how long I’d been there.

I forced myself to move. I washed my face. I turned the lights brighter. I kept checking the time.

And that was when I heard it.

Not loud enough to be obvious. Just a low, uneven thudding, carried faintly through the pipes.

I listened carefully, cupping my ear to the walls.

I recognised it immediately. The faint humming of a washing machine.

It ran for less than a minute, then stopped.

That shouldn’t be possible. My apartment is on the second floor.

For the rest of the night, I didn’t sleep. I didn’t go downstairs. Every time my thoughts began to drift, I found myself listening for that sound.

I saw one comment on my previous post suggesting this might not be a someone, but a something. I’m starting to think that could be true.

I don’t know how you explain something like this to building management. I don’t know how you investigate it.

All I know is that I’m terrified to leave the apartment, but I don’t even feel safe staying here.
