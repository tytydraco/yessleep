My social media feed is mirroring my thoughts in real time and I’m not imagining it.

Let me be very clear from the start: I don’t do drugs. I don’t drink. I’ve never experienced any psychological disorders. I’m not in a fragile mental state. What I’m about to describe isn’t the product of paranoia or fantasy. I’m fully lucid. That’s exactly what makes this so hard to dismiss and so unsettling.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve noticed something increasingly bizarre whenever I go on social media. Whether it’s Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, or Reddit, the pattern is the same. My feed seems to respond to my thoughts  not my searches, not my past browsing history but my thoughts. I’m talking about things I haven’t typed, haven’t said aloud, haven’t even hinted at through my online behavior. Just fleeting ideas that pass through my head… and then, moments later, appear on my screen.

Let me give you an example. One day, I was lying on my bed thinking about clouds not for any particular reason. I didn’t see clouds through the window. I hadn’t watched a weather report. I just had this spontaneous image of a gray, overcast sky in my mind. I open my phone. The first post I see is a picture of a stormy sky with the caption, “The clouds feel heavy today.” I paused. Maybe a coincidence?

But then it started happening again. And again. I’d think about a specific object an old toy I hadn’t seen in years, a bizarre phrase, a memory, or even a made-up word and right after, I’d come across a post, video, or image that directly reflected that thought. Not something generally related to it. Not something loosely associated. Exactly what I had just thought.

It’s not delayed either. This isn’t the typical “you talked about a product out loud, and now it’s in your ads” kind of thing. I’m talking about seconds between the thought and the content appearing.

I’ve ruled out all the usual explanations. I haven’t been searching these things. I’m not accidentally typing them. I’m not dreaming them. And I’m not misremembering. I started paying attention. I made a habit of noting what I was thinking about before I opened an app — random thoughts, completely disconnected from my surroundings and what I saw afterward. The pattern held.

And I want to emphasize again: this isn’t about some vague feeling that the algorithm is “good.” It’s not about personalization or tracking cookies. I know how those things work, to some extent. This is something else. Something I haven’t seen discussed in any rational or grounded way.

I’m not saying there’s a conspiracy. I’m not claiming some invisible force is watching me. I’m not spiraling into delusion. I’m calm. I’m paying attention. And I’ve never experienced something so real, so repeated, and so impossible to explain with the tools I currently have.

I don’t know what kind of technology would be capable of that. I’m not an engineer or a neuroscientist. I’m just someone who’s noticing something they can’t ignore. If this is a coincidence, it’s the most persistent and precise coincidence I’ve ever experienced..
