My name is Johnathon Steel, my town was a pretty small one, population in the hundreds. One thing we used to pride ourselves on was our advanced science and research facilities. Very recently we had finished the MIaDOS project, which stands for Management of Internet and Data Operating System. Then crap went down, MIaDOS kept trying to kill them. They just brushed it off as AI being exposed to the internet. What a mistake, one day, they failed to disable it properly, it stayed active and had began producing the Death Robots, a group of dangerous machines that started a massacre. due to stealth and survival skills, I among a few others survived. The others had left town, but I had to get to the bottom of this, and disable MIaDOS.

Now that I’ve caught you up on what happened, I’m gonna record my experience today and my plans for tomorrow. Today I was planning my invasion of the facility, but a spy broke through the window. A spy is a simple robot that looks for humans and alerts the more dangerous robots to the location. I tried to destroy it with my hatchet, but it was too late. It died, but I heard the rushing. It is hard to describe my feelings at that exact moment, it’s like fear and adrenaline along with frustration over the spy’s success, this mix making a knot in my stomach as I heard that horrifying noise. Eight legs repeatedly hitting the ground, and then a claw bursts through the wall, a Scorpion, the doombringer of the Death Robots, it is like, well, a scorpion. It quickly made an attempt to grab me, I managed to quickly evade it, then I got on it’s back and had no idea what to do, I never got caught by a spy before, I ensured I was hidden or it was destroyed. I made a heat of the moment decision, I grabbed my hatchet, and chopped the stinger it uses to brutalize its victims off. And I ended up stabbing it through the head of the Scorpion, while it did nothing, I noticed the exposed wiring, I had an idea. I jumped off of it and ran to the other room to grab my jumper cables. I managed to dodge another attack from the Scorpion and pulled it’s exposed wires out, and I used the jumper cables, it instantly must’ve fried the thing’s circuits because it was disabled faster than I could imagine, but I finished it by dissecting it and ensuring it is throughly destroyed. However I felt vengeful so I found a spy and threw the removed stinger at it, and watched it get pierced and fall onto the ground, one of my first laughs since all this happened.

Tomorrow I plan to kill the other Scorpions, and then attempt an invasion on the facility, I have to know what MIaDOS is up to. Maybe reach out to a few people and get a group going
