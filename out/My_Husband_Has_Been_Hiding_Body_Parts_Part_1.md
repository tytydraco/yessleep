There’s been a deep, gaping pit sitting right under my chest for months now. An all-consuming void that sits beneath my skin and swallows up any shreds of joy that are left, tumbling around the grey, smog shrouded streets of this Urban shithole of concrete and brick. The air is hot as it flows down into my lungs, the chemicals leaving a bitter aftertaste. But it’s all so cold; God, is it cold against my skin. The frigid waves stream up my arms and run down my neck. It’s the same speed, the same amount of pressure as his hands. Hell, sometimes I am damn sure that I can feel his fingerprints scrape past the bumps on my skin.

I haven’t thought of trying anything past mourning, I’m not sure my mind is strong enough to process, let alone understand what happened. But I think this might be a good start, remembering it all and writing it all out, processing all that happened, all that I did in response.

In June of last year, Gaige, my husband and I went on a well-deserved vacation into a rather generic cabin in the woods. between an over-demanding work schedule, the passing of his mother, and the following suicide of his father, the year before that had not treated either of us well, so a week-long trip of simple, long-winded hikes and laying in each other’s arms, with only the distant sounds of chirping birds to distract us from reading, board games and trashy horror movies was something that both of us were way overdue for.

The cabin itself was just as beautiful as the towering pine trees that surrounded it. On the outside, it was a mixture of stone and wood with a spacious porch up front and a raised deck out back that looked over the forest. The cabin was pretty small, with just three rooms on the inside (not counting the blocked off basement and attic). A non-separated living room and kitchen took up most of the space, while a bedroom and bathroom were tucked away in corners, both taking up nearly an equal amount of space.

We decided to stay in on the first day, taking some time to settle in. Gage threw some meat and vegetables on the back porch grill while we practiced talking to each other about anything that didn’t cause anxious dread. It didn’t take long though, before we finally got back into the same smooth flowing conversations that got us to fall in love in the first place. It was pitiful, really. We had spent the last year, only seeing each other, either drained of all life or weeping. And when the pain grew too strong to bare, we fucked, hoping the orgasms would char our nerves enough to keep us numb for at least a little while longer.

It was nice to see him smile again, especially while he was unaware that he was doing it. Soon after, I realized I was smiling too. The little light of the now setting sun that peeked through the branches glinted off his dark, brown eyes. The tips of his teeth poked their heads out under his assuring firm lips.

There was a brake in our conversation, must not have been longer than five minutes, but both of us recognized the others beauty, spent the time admiring it all, from the imperfections in the others skin and to the expression of relief both of us had forgotten the look of. We sat admiring each other’s beauty until it all came spilling over and turned into a craving.

We couldn’t make it to the bed; we didn’t even leave the deck before our hands were caressing the others body, gliding across smooth skin, grabbing, and pulling. My lips sucked the skin of his neck while my tongue drooled over him. And then he repeated after me. We stripped each other with franticly eager, shaky hands once we’d had enough of the little skin on display. For the first time in a year, we weren’t fucking just to forget, we wanted to remember.

We moved to the bed at one point; how much time had passed was hard to track, but the sky had gone dark by then. We went on for long after that, intermittently swapping between holding and fucking each other, only interrupted once when Gaige remembered that the food was still on the grill outside, fully charred black.

We fell asleep that night to rain gently tapping on the windows and pouring down from the roof. Both of us were still hungry, but also too drained to get out of bed, so it was a nice surprise when I awoke to a fully prepared meal in the morning. Gaige had woken up before me, taken a short walk through the still damp, warmly sunlit forest and gotten back in time to fry some eggs.

He woke me up softly and lowered the tray of food into my lap. He had burnt it, but he’d never been too much of a cook anyway. *‘It’s the thought that counts’* I thought as I cut off a piece and dropped it into my mouth. Biting down into the egg rewarded me with a crunch, it felt as if I was trying to chew sand, it was course and grainy like a nail file brushing against my teeth. Then, my eyes began to water, it was full of salt. The little I had swallowed left a trail of burning pain behind it. I spat out the rest and looked up to a confused Gaige.

“What’s wrong?” he said, standing still at the side of the bed and staring down at me.

“Did you dump the whole saltshaker onto this?” I asked with a playful chuckle to not seem hostile.

“oh sorry” He said, picked the plate up and walked out of the room, emotionless.

I shot out of bed right after and rushed to the bathroom to wash the bitter taste out of my mouth, too distracted to question the lacking response. In the bathroom, neither the cold or the hot water were much help in stopping the burning in my mouth, so I walked back out into the living room to sift through our half-unpacked bags.

Gaige was by the stove; his back turned towards the rest of the room. I crouched down over the bags, quickly sifting past neatly folded clothes.

An aery grunt broke the silence, but I paid it no mind, too distracted by the flames dripping down my esophagus and the never-ending pit of clothes at hand. Then it came again, louder, a heave so brutal I expected it to be followed by the sounds of vomit smacking into wood.

“Are you okay?” I looked up from the bags and called over to Gaige.

He quickly spun around towards me with the fear and shame of a touchy mortician caught in his act. He held the runny eggs in his hands, his lips and fingertips were covered in a dark-yellow grease, crumbs of egg clung to the skin around them.

“Yeah, just really hungry” he said with a full mouth muffling his words, turned back around and continued slurping oil. Smacking his lips, and heaving once his body rejected the salt.

I reached into the bag again, this time looking for a reason to leave the room more than something to clean my mouth with. Luckily, I didn’t have to look for too long. I snatched up the zip-lock bag of our toothbrushes and a tube of toothpaste and powerwalked to the bathroom as calmly as I could.

*‘what the fuck was that’* was the only well-structured thought that raced through my mind, the rest were a scrambled mess of me trying to reason, me trying to come up with excuses in support of him and me debating whether I should even say anything if he straightened out after this. In hindsight, I should have acted, pried deeper, tried to get the truth out of him; as you’ll see I had many opportunities to. But I was desperate, I had spent so long, desperately grasping for a sense of normalcy, for a day where I could wake up to anything but the weight of anxiety and paranoia crushing me into a paper thin, soulless shell of a person that now, it was impossible for me to let go.

So, I walked out of the bathroom to a plate of perfectly fired eggs sitting on the kitchen counter.

“sorry about earlier” he began to explain “I mixed up the plates”

He stared at me, waiting for me to taste the food, and an acceptance of his apology; I could only muster the latter, spitting out a half assed “it’s alright.”

“the cap just flew off when I was cooking. Shouldn’t have trusted that cheap-ass saltshaker in the first place” he chuckled to loosen the tension.

My fears had been dampened, though what I was exactly afraid of still hadn’t fully come to me. after the fact, it felt idiotic. What was I so scared of? Hiding away in the bathroom because he mixed up some plates? because he was eating eggs?

“These look great” I blurted out around half a minute after my last statement; it only served to make the start of the day more awkward.

Thankfully Gaige shot back at me with a “were you waiting on a second opinion on that?” that didn’t quite brake, but managed to scrape off a thick chunk of the tension that would not stay for long nonetheless.

The rest of the day went over well, just a few hours later, the start of the day had become a distant, hazy memory. The rest of it was full of the serine relaxation we had come to the cabin for. Gaige made coffee and we sat out on the front porch for a while, first reading, then striking up a conversation that we brought back inside over a dozen or so games of Jenga.

Neither of us were fans of the game, but damn it, we had paid for the cabin so we were going to get the most out of everything in it. even if all we had were Jenga, a deck of cards, and a beat-up board of operation with dead batteries.

I fell asleep on the couch that night with Gaige’s arms wrapped around me, blindly taking in the movie playing on the TV, not giving much thought to what any of it meant.

I have never been a light sleeper; my alarms were only set as a reminder for Gaige to wake me up. So, it was a surprise when that night, I woke up in the bedroom to distant coughing. It was wet and preceded by a reluctance caused by pain.

I crawled out of bed, trying to rub out the sharp pain that flickered behind my eyes. Sore muscles dragged my feet out of the bedroom. The entirety of the kitchen, and the living room were visible from the bedroom door (with the minor exception of the small space behind some of the furniture) and from a first look, Gaige was nowhere to be found.

Logically, I then went to the bathroom. What was it? was he sick? Choking? Each explanation grew worse and more concerning after I opened the door to an empty bathroom. I rushed out to the deck while the coughing grew brutal, a nonstop breathless retch with an underlying pained groan.

There was something wrong, he was not well and by the looks of it, he was trying to hide it from me. I rushed back inside and began getting ready to head out front.

Then, the coughing stopped. I was by the front door, sliding my feet into my shoes and by the time I was up onto my feet, Gaige swung the door open and stepped in.

“Are you okay?” I asked with concern before he was even fully indoors, making him flinch in the process “The fuck was that about?” I asked, agitated after I realized that he (for the most part) was.

He quickly wiped the back of his hand across his lips before speaking “ye… yeah I’m ok, Just, there were some noises outside so I got up to check and umm…” his face was flushed red and drenched in sweat.

“Well, what was it”

“It’s a dead racoon, It’s torn to shreds… probably got into a fight with another racoon or something” he explained “nothing to worry about though, It’s just really fucking gross” he chuckled, trying to lighten the mood “I’ll call the owner tomorrow morning, see if they can send someone to clean it up” he was holding his shoes in his hand with the soles pointing up, they were covered in a layer of blood that threatened to drip down onto the floor at any moment.

I stared at him with a visible hesitance that was clear enough to force him into reassuring me, while directing me back towards the bedroom.

“Hun, it’s going to be fine, even if it’s a bear, it’s not getting inside. Now go back to bed, I’ll be right in there with you. Just gotta clean the shoes” his hands gently nudged me towards the bedroom and I followed their guiding touch back to bed, where sleep overtook me not soon after.

He was gone the next morning, for a few hours too. He would not answer his phone, neither my calls or texts. It was early *‘he probably thinks that I’m still asleep’* I thought, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

A gradual panic began to set over the next thirty minutes, each minute a different though that fed more fuel to the flame. In my mind, he got lost, he was attacked by a wild animal, attacked by a stranger, stabbed a dozen times and took five shots to the chest.

When the heat in my gut and the blurring of my vision became unbearable, I stepped outside and walked around the cabin, looking off into the distance with the phone still up to my ear. That slow ringtone echoing through my mind, making my anxiety worse as if the ringtone rolling faster would change the results of the three disappointing beeps that followed them.

Over two hours had passed since I had woken up (only thirty minutes of those were not spent on worrying). Just before I fully committed to leaving the cabin to look for Gaige, I called the owner to see when he had called her that morning (helpful to estimate how far he might have been).

She answered before the first ring had finished, sparing me from hearing more of that dreadful noise “Cabin view rental services, this is Marie, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with” she threw the words out in less than a second, clearly out of obligation more than a genuine introduction.

“Hello, I’m calling from cabin three eight eight. my husband was supposed to call you earlier this morning about a dead racoon outside our cabin I just wanted to know the exact time that he called” I blabbered into the phone in one continuous breath, happy to be finally talking to someone.

“Hmm… let me check” she said while loudly typing on a keyboard “three eight eight, right?”

“yeah”

“No, we haven’t received any calls from there today”

“Excuse me?”

“Yeah, I mean we have not gotten any calls about dead animals today in general”

“o… okay, thank you’

“And is there anything e---” I hung up before she could finish.

For the last time that day, I walked around the house while looking at it, rather than away. The front porch was clear, as I had expected, and so was the wall to the left. The space under the deck was inaccessible due to the sharp decline in the hill, so I walked back to the front and looped around to the right. Nothing, not even a stain in the grass or a splatter of blood against the wall, all the way down until the chimney.

The chimney poked out of the wall for a foot or so, obscuring a god amount of space so I slowly walked downhill towards it, taking careful steps into the increasingly taller grass. Each step revealing more of nothing. Did Gaige clean it up himself? No, by the looks of it he wanted nothing to do with that thing. It could have been another animal, lazily leaching off another’s kill.

The Chimney drifted closer until I was standing right beside it.

It was hard to make it out first, not the blood, the dark red stained the corner of the chimney pouring down from the height of my head. But at my feet, deep into the grass, tossed into a corner was a flab of skin, A human face, covered in blood, crumpled and tossed into the corner with a small, white, and meaty grape, riddled by a spiderweb of red, tossed right on top of it.

Fear burnt through me, flaring up in my gut and spilling out of my esophagus. I began to run uphill, and when my legs could not bear my weight, I began to crawl, digging my fingers into the dirt and grass. My lungs burnt from the chill in the air, my vision blurred. I had to get to the car.

The slope under my feet felt as if it was fighting back against me, my shoes slipped on the grass and when I managed to hit a dry patch, rocks rolled out from under my feet.

When the hill began to even out, I stood back up and instantly bumped into him.

“GAIGE WE GOTTA GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE THERE’S SOMEONES FACE, NEXT TO… HE’S DEAD, THEY CUT SOMEONES FACE OF, PLEASE GET ME OUT OF HERE!” I yelled and grabbed his arm, dragging him towards the car.

“Woah, what are you talking about?” he said “is everything alright?”

“THE FUCK DOES IT LOOK LIKE?! GET IN THE CAR! NOW!” I yelled and tugged on his arm again.

“Okay, okay, calm down, I coming” he said calmly and got into the passenger seat. I ran over to the other side of the car and jumped in behind the steering wheel.

“call the police!” I commanded without bothering to question him on where he had been or his tranquility; my main goal was to get as close to civilization as I could.

I sped down a narrow road that ran between two walls of evergreen spires, too lost in thought and focused on the road to listen to the words Gaige spoke into the phone. We were at a small town, halfway down the hill in less than ten minutes. I parked into the first spot I saw, right outside of a fast-food restaurant and jumped out of the car, projectile vomiting the little I had eaten last night onto the sidewalk. A baffled audience of one, stared at me out of the front window.

Gaige jumped out of the car but only stared at me from a few feet away. My first reaction was of anger. Here I was, hunched over, spilling a gallons worth of mushy food, and stomach acid, and he just started, not speaking a word, not stepping in closer to hold me while I struggled to keep my balance. But then, as the haze of primal survival instincts began to ware off, my suspicion began to rise, and I was glad the he decided to keep his distance.

I waved my arms as the row of cop cars drove past us, one of the three pulled over. I told the cop in the passenger seat that I was the one that had made the call, and nothing more about Gaige out of cowardice.

He threw a “what a coincidence” our way as if we weren’t on the side of the only road that lead up the hill, and told us to wait for another officer that would write down my account of what had happened.

As I watched my only sense of safety speed away, I felt like I had been stripped naked and dumped in an alley, directionless, exposed, and frozen cold by the wind that swept under the grey clouds.

Gaige must have noticed me shivering, he quickly pulled the jacket off his back and wrapped it around me like a blanket. I welcomed its warmth, but struggled to sit comfortably with his scent still radiating off the cloth.

I noticed that the commotion had drawn some intrigue when what I thought to have been a good faith act of kindness by the single employee of the restaurant, was unmasked by a “what happened?” that he asked before he had fully stepped out of the building.

I slid my arms into the sleeves of the jacket and accepter the bottle of water while Gaige explained all that he knew. The kid listened with a mixture of fear and immature morbid intrigue contorting his face.

The next cop car did not take too long to arrive after that. As expected, small towns like these don’t get much action, so the underworked and overstaffed are giddy to play detective for a couple of hours before they grow too bored to do much more than take a few pictures and write down three lines of text.

The cop that spoke to us seemed partially dismissive, spending less time talking to us than the kid had before speeding up the hill himself, weirdly giddy to see a part of the action.

The town was barren, except for the boy in the restaurant and an old lady walking a dog on the other side of the street, we had not seen any signs of life. Not that the town stimulated any forms of activity anyway. Most of the stores along the main strip were closed, the windows of some bearded up. There were no parks or playgrounds, just building after building of a poverty ridden town that still desperately grasped at the remaining strands of being the tourist destination it used to be.

With no other clear choices, we stepped into the restaurant, deciding to give the cops an hour before going back up to the cabin to pack all our belongings.

Inside, the air was heavy with the heat of idle grills, ovens, and deep-fries. Each step was a battle against a growing loss of appetite and the sticky remnants of dried grease and soda.

“you can take a seat, I’ll order” Gaige said while digging into his pocket for a wallet “what do you want?”

“Just get me something to drink” I said, knowing I wouldn’t be able to bring myself to eat without decorating the sidewalk with another puddle of puke (if the kid was lucky enough to see me make it out the door)

I broke away from him and sat at the only table not stained be a puddle of dried rat piss. Despite the running grills and stoves, it was just as cold in the restaurant as it was outside. My hands were freezing, sensitive enough to where just the thought of moving them hurt, so I sunk them into the jacket pockets.

The was something in there, no, there were a lot, they were small, solid and sharp. I grabbed one and lifted it out of the pocket, it was off white, no bigger than an inch long, dried, brown blood crusted on at the roots.

I quickly buried my hand into the pocket again and grabbed a handful, pulling them out and scattering them on the table. there must have been thirty or more in total. Gaige looked back over at me, saw me, shaking, quiet, staring at the assortment of teeth on the table and rushed over to me. I flinched away towards the wall as he approached.

“ah shit, should have told you. I found a skull on my walk today, I think it was a deer, not sure though”

“WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU TAKE IT’S TEETH!” I lashed out, not caring about the curious, prodding pair of eyes my voice drove away from a grill.

“Jesus, calm down Hun’ I thought you liked this sort of stuff”

“Yeah, when they’re clean, you just tugged this shit out of it mouth and popped it into your pocket. Come on, this is fucking disgusting” I lashed out further, knowing I would feel bad about it later, but unable to contain the fear, confusion, anger, and disgust that had been piled on top of me since I had woken up. My mind was fatigued and its exhaustion had begun to affect my body.

“Okay, I’m sorry” he said with a false comforting soft tone, the same tone he always used when he went into damage control mode “I’ll throw them out” he said, leaning over the table to scoop up the teeth.

I jumped out of the seat and ran into the restroom to wash my hands. The room was surprisingly clean, the air smelled of chemicals. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I looked like shit, beads of sweat riddled my forehead, my eyes were wide open and the dark bags hung low under them. I could not bear to take more of this shit. I left the room and did not stop walking until I was standing beside the car.

Gaige was just as stubborn about eating indoors as I was about falling asleep. The car seat was not ideal and I still struggled to clear my mind, but I’d had enough, I wanted it to be over, I hoped that sleep would somehow fully reset the shitstorm I had woken up to that day.

Sleep was a prize only granted after a long battle with the lack of space, anything to rest my head on and the rough texture of the seats, but after a while, I finally managed to brute force my way into unconsciousness.

I dreamt, of what I can’t recall, but I remember waking up to crushing dread pushing down onto my chest. We were on the road; the tires smoothly rolled across the pavement and the light from the streetlamps pulsated through the windows.

“Wha…how long was I out for” I sat up, rubbing my eyes. My head felt like it was on the verge of exploding and my spine burnt like hundreds of needles had skewered its length.

“I don’t know? A good five hours maybe” Gaige answered back.

“Where are we going?” I hid my concern the best I could while memories came flooding back.

“Home… I picked everything up from the cabin while you were out”

“Shit, I’m sorry I---”

“It’s fine, you deserved it.” he reassured me “I talked to one of the cops when they came back down, turns out a few of them handled it worse than you”

“Do they know what happened?”

“They didn’t tell me much, I’m guessing they aren’t allowed to, I just know that they took the evidence”

It was weird, even with the memories, and my still burning suspicions, I felt safe in that car. Gaige sounded normal again, not dismissive of my anxiety, not weirdly secretive or cryptic. Maybe sleep had really reset my luck, or maybe it was that fucking cabin, or that depressing ass town that tainted my vision and made me pointlessly vigilant. But with the haze of sleep and a couple hundred miles distancing me from those memories, I felt safe again.

“How much longer do we have left?” I asked, hoping it was long enough to justify going back to sleep.

“Probably like 30 minutes” He answered “I mean, if we’re lucky with the traffic… here, should still be good” he reached down to the cup holders and passed back a cup of soda.

I hadn’t realized how dry my throat was until the cup was in my hand. I raised the straw to my mouth and drained the cup during the rest of the ride that we opted to sit in silence for; the only sounds rattling around the car being the distorted humming of the radio and the rustling of tires rolling over pavement.

We got home at twelve and to my surprise I was able to muster a full night’s sleep. It was quick, my head hit the pillow and my body gave out, its exhaustion coercing my mind to follow soon after.

I woke up the next morning, uncomfortable from the lack of exhaustion I had grown used to. I did not hesitate to pull the blanket off myself or to get up, I wasn’t sore and the light didn’t burn my eyes.

I tugged at the bathroom door, not expecting to be greeted with resistance, even though not seeing Gaige around the rest of the apartment should have clued me in. I softly knocked on the door.

“I’ll be out, I’m almost done” He spoke from the inside, the words came in a fast, almost panicked string. The discomfort and urgency went under the radar in the moment.

The TV was running idly in the living room, the screensaver slowly switching between pictures of nature that I caught occasional glances of while emptying out the bags we had lazily chucked onto the living room floor. I pulled out folded clothes we would not have even seen even if we had stayed the full week and bags of chargers, and toiletries that were tucked in between them.

A distant flush of the toilet drew my attention away from the pile of clothes. I got up onto my feet and stood outside the bathroom, listening to the running sink for long enough to warrant worry. But the door opened right as I thought to knock and check in.

Out came Gaige, his hair was a mess, drops of water still sat scattered across his pale face, and in his hand, poorly hidden and half obscured, was an empty container of salt.

He jumped and gasped when he saw me “Shit, wasn’t expecting you” he said, catching his breath and took a sharp turn towards the kitchen without saying much more; He was weirdly distant and secretive.

I felt it come back again, dread and fear, slowly dripping into my mind, growing in intensity as they brought more memories with them. The face. I was so lost in fear that I did not have time to process the implications behind it.

Someone was dead, a person, stripped of their life and their skin, tossed into a corner like a wet napkin, like nothing they had been mattered. They were excess, just as significant as the crumpled beer can that lay, tossed into the grass a few feet ahead.

I felt anger trickle in past the fear, I was freaking myself out, making myself overtly paranoid and bummed out for no reason. It had already happened, there was nothing I could do about that, and the only people qualified to stop it from happening again were already informed.

My hands still trembled when I closed the door behind me. I splashed some cold water on my face and brushed my teeth before lifting the toilet lid. The water inside the bowl was a dark pink, drawing so much attention to itself that I embarrassingly did not even notice it first.

I tried to shriek and gasp at the same time, ultimately letting out what sounded more like a high-pitched hiccup. It couldn’t be, I thought I was free, it was supposed to stay at the cabin, everything was supposed to be normal now that we left. But all of it was still all here, and now, while I slowly stumbled away from the toilet bowl, I knew that it was Gaige.

*‘What the fuck do I do now’* I thought. could I just play it off? Wait until I got out and call for help then? Yes, that sounded possible, I did it before (though not at this caliber) I’d be like a mother lifting a car, scenes heightened, overly aware, able to act as if there wasn’t a bleeding, amputated and skinless penis floating in the toilet in front of me.

The door swung open, (of course I had forgotten to lock it) Gaige stood just at the threshold, the mumbling of distant voices echoing out of the TV behind him. He stared into the room for a moment, looked to the toilet bowl, then to me, shaking on the ground, fear and tears pouring out of my eyes. I stared up at him like a lamb staring into the gears of a meat grinder, no plans I had made mattered, he was larger than me, there was no point in fighting back unless I wanted to worsen my fate. I accepted it all, imagined it all in my head, how I’d be beaten, butchered, and skinned. Discarded like the rest of the dehumanized meat, skin, and bones.

I stared at his contorted face while he loomed over me, staring deeply into my soul.

A tear rolled down his cheek and then he turned away, tossing some clothes back into a bag and storming out of the apartment, leaving me alone, still lost, still afraid, crying, weeping on the bathroom floor; sobs breathing in short gusts of coppery, blood scented air.
