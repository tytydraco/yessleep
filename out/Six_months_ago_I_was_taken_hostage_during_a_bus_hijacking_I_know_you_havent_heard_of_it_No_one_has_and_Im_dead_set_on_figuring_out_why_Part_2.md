***Event Log, Day 1:***

\- - - - -

The ticking box looked so harmless mounted within the display case.

Granted, it was a tiny part of a much larger exhibit that occupied most of the chapel’s slanted, south-facing wall. A footnote hiding meekly between a rusted pickaxe, a couple of black-and-white photographs, and a blood-stained piece of cloth.

A plaque over the display read:

*“The History of Jeremiah, Divine Parthogenesis, and The Audience to his Red Nativity (1929 to current day).”*

Icy sweat beaded over my forehead.

I arrived at the compound brimming with confidence and determination, fully believing my investigation could reconcile what happened on that bus six months earlier.

However, as I studied the display, I began to feel that my confidence was misguided. Naïve, even.

Discovering the meaning behind Apollo’s ticking box felt like the goal. I imagined it as a gigantic piece of the puzzle, something that would make the underlying picture clear. The goddamned cryptic lynchpin. And yet, judging by the size of the display, it turned out to be just a minuscule fraction of the overall whole, its importance dwarfed in the face of a much broader narrative.

If the box felt vast and unknowable, but was actually microscopic in the grand scheme of things, where the hell did that leave me? What’s smaller than microscopic?

My heartbeat grew rabid. Existential terror thrummed in my stomach like I had swallowed a handful of cicadas.

I closed my eyes and searched my memory, fishing for Nia’s reassuring voice.

*Focus and breathe, Elena. Fear is usually an empty emotion. It’s looking without understanding, observation without inquiry. Let it go. Embrace the discomfort.*

*One foot in front of the other, sweetheart.*

My body began to quiet.

Ten years after my wife’s departure from this world, the tune of her speech still remained a universal antidote.

I put my eyes back on the box, reminding myself that it wasn’t *literally* Apollo’s. They were similar, but not identical. This box lacked those fluid-filled tubes. It was slightly larger - more the size of a wallet than a matchbox - and the metal was blue instead of a dull green.

A prototype, perhaps.

The description card hanging next to it read:

*Early Geiger Counter, circa 1930. Its pulses guided Jeremiah to his wayward miracle.*

The ticking box was a handheld machine designed to detect radiation.

Whatever was chasing Apollo, it must have been emitting *some* sort of radiation, and that’s how he had been tracking it. The ticking betrayed its approach.

If I perked my ears, I could almost hear the noise cutting through the eerie silence of the chapel.

Slowly, it intensified.

Each tick became incrementally sharper, louder, hungrier: a bevy of needles tapping against my eardrum. I clutched my head. The sound threatened to consume me.

Then, a door creaked open, and the sound vanished.

*“Meghan? The Monsignor is ready for your intake. Feel free to leave your belongings in the lobby.”*

The young woman’s voice echoed through the cavernous antechamber like the vibrations of a bell. She stood in the doorway, framed by a deep, rose-colored light spilling out from the office.

I walked across the vacant room, hoping that my conviction and my alias were not as transparent as they now felt. As I was about to step past her, she winked. I fought back a bout of nausea.

*Focus and breathe, Elena.*

I thought of Nia, and I did not visibly falter.

At least, I don’t believe I did.

\- - - - -

*“So, Meghan, how did you come to hear about Jeremiah and his wayward miracle?”* the Monsignor asked, his face and body bathed in the sunlight streaming through the stained glass behind him, his skin tinted a visceral mixture of crimson and purple.

No other lights were turned on. The entire room was illuminated via the stained glass.

Earlier that morning, my ancient sedan had one hell of a time climbing the path to the reserve. It had no street signs, no guardrails, no semblance of civilization or infrastructure whatsoever; just a series of perilous, unmarked roads winding up the side of the mountain. The engine struggled against a near-constant incline, sputtering harshly like a seven-decade smoker trying and failing to cough up a ball of rusted phlegm trapped at the bottom of their lungs. I would know. I’d smoked a pack a day since I was fifteen.

When the chapel finally came into view, this colossal triangle-shaped building positioned triumphantly at the precipice, I had plenty of time to appreciate the stained glass as my car toiled through those last few craggy meters of uneven red-rock at eight miles-per-hour.

Most of the building was stone, excluding the eastward facing wall, which was *entirely* composed of stained glass.

Ten stories of thick, semi-translucent crystal greeted the Arizona sunrise a half-mile above sea level. From the outside, I couldn’t determine *exactly* what image the fixture depicted, or if it depicted any image at all. It was too opaque. As I entered the Monsignor’s office, however, I found myself confronted by a gargantuan work of art only visible from the inside. Ornate and unnerving in equal measure, its presence ripped the air from my chest. My skull felt hollow. I couldn’t find the words to answer his question, but I think that reaction worked in my favor. The Monsignor seemed to misinterpret my speechlessness as awe, not terror.

He smiled and pushed himself out from behind his desk. The wheels on his chair squeaked as he glided across the tile flooring, spinning his body as the momentum slowed so he was facing the glass just as I was.

*“Harrowing in the best of kind way, no?”* the Monsignor remarked as he leaned back, letting his hands rest behind his head.

I forced a weak chuckle and wrestled my gaze away from the composition. When I turned to the man, I expected to see him staring at the glass as well. He wasn’t. Although he was talking about the image, the Monsignor was looking right at me, the details of his body language muddied by the scarlet haze.

*“Yes…well, it’s one thing to hear of the legend through an infertility support group on Facebook. It’s another thing to see it…uhm…portrayed so…vividly.”* I replied.

He clicked his tongue and wagged a finger in my direction.

*“No, dear girl, you misunderstand. Jeremiah is no legend. His wayward miracle is no myth. Everything you’ve read is true. Everything you’ve heard about his Red Nativity is bona fide, and you’ve heard of so little. Skepticism has no home on the mountaintop, remember that,”* He said in an accent that sounded distinctly Cuban to my ear: the speech was fast, breathy, and melodic.

I smiled.

The Monsignor was undeniably charming, a sentence that almost goes without saying. What cult leader worth their salt isn’t? I don’t know where he got off calling me *girl,* though. Time had been dragging me kicking and screaming into my late forties, and he looked *half* my age. Maybe less than half.

The *boy* had wavy dark brown hair, with a pair of dark brown eyes to match. Smooth, blemish-free skin. Lean, but not gaunt like Apollo. His default facial expression was warm and inviting, but also sort of inscrutable, like the kindness in his features was just a veneer he wore to obscure some deeper emotion - some uglier truth. He sported a long, close-fitting black robe overlain with a black mozzetta that certainly fit his title. (*For those of you who didn’t grow up Catholic, a mozzetta is an elbow-length caped garment worn over the shoulders. Imagine the pope. Whatever you’re picturing, that’s probably right.*)

As I turned away from him and back to the stained glass, my smile faded.

*“I believe you. Or, I want to believe you, I do. More than anything.”*

Now, to be clear, I did *not* believe that lunatic. I was trying to sell him a character. Someone whose faith was in crisis. In my experience, people like him aren’t as interested in the steadfast zealots because there’s nothing additional to gain from them. They’ve already converted, drunk on the proverbial Kool-Aid. Their humanity has been scooped out and replaced with cult doctrine. But the wavering devotee? That seems to whet their appetite. It’s like playing hard to get, and when they get enraptured by the thrill of the hunt, they become prone to mistakes. If I was going to determine why Apollo hijacked that bus to get here, as well as what he stood to gain from the Monsignor and *The Audience to his Red Nativity*, I’d need to keep him interested.

So, I sold myself as that character as best I could.

I played hard to get.

*“But I mean, it can’t all be true, and even if some of what people say about him is true, surely it didn’t happen like this…”* I said, gesturing an open palm at the hallucinogenic scene.

To my knowledge, there aren’t any photographs of the cult’s founder, Jeremiah. Because of that, his likeness is speculative. Passed down through whispers over multiple generations of fanatics.

He’s described as being twelve feet tall, with a cataracted, cyclopean eye and a placental cord extending off his face where a mouth should have been. A silent, all seeing demigod. He does not have lips to speak with, but that means he cannot lie. He does not have teeth to eat with, but that means he cannot consume. Jeremiah cannot take, he can only give.

I’d come across the myth of his ascension more than a handful of times while I wormed my way into *The Audience to his Red Nativity.* Through his piety, his raw and unshakable belief, he became an avatar of creation. The man who cultivated a womb and gave birth to a thousand children, so the legends go.

And that moment was depicted on the stained glass.

Jeremiah was the focal point, but the man wasn’t etched to look twelve feet tall. No, he was utterly colossal, sitting cross-legged between two mountains, with the top of his head the highest of the three summits. There was a massive, gaping hole in his chest. It looked like a pipe bomb had detonated inside his sternum, fractured ribs contorted around the edges of the cavity, bent and twisted in the aftermath of some catastrophic explosion. Numerous flattened tendrils emerged from the hole. A bouquet of fleshy, rope-shaped cancers originating from some unseen center point within the demigod, radiating in a cone out into the desert air.

His so-called *thousand children* were pictured walking into the world on those tendrils. Not as infants, mind you. The language in the myth is a little misleading in that regard. They were born adults. Many of them didn’t even appear completely human. One had the head of a dove, another had the body of a scorpion. A couple others had giant, honeycombed eyes - a few even split the difference and had one normal eye paired with one insectoid eye. Even the “children” that lacked mutation didn’t seem exactly right - their proportions were off, their bodies decidedly asymmetric in ways I’ve found difficult translate into words.

All of that had been painstakingly immortalized on a gigantic triangular slab of semi-transparent crystal, half as tall as the apartment complex I’d departed from a few hours earlier. A perfectly nightmarish torrent of glowing imagery that I couldn’t seem to look away from no matter how much I wanted to.

The more I looked, the more I heard the ticking.

Louder, and louder, and louder, until my perception of reality narrowed, whittled down to a strange holy trinity. I became that noise, Jeremiah, and his thousand anamolous children. Nothing else seemed to exist anymore, and even if it still did, it didn’t matter. Not in the face of his wayward miracle.

And that felt like a terrifying sort of peace.

*“…Meghan? Meghan?”*

I snapped out of the trance. The ticking ceased, and existence re-inflated.

Not sure how long Monsignor had been calling out my alias for, but it was long enough that he felt compelled to shield me from further exposure to Jeremiah, pulling a cable that draped a massive curtain over the glass.

I came to as darkness descended over the Monsignor’s office.

*“Sorry, Monsignor…I got a little lost in Jeremiah’s grace, I guess. Haven’t eaten much today, either. He just…he just represents the hope that I still might be capable of having a child, despite what the doctors have told me.”*

All three statements were truthful to some degree, so I think I sounded convincing. I was hungry, genetically infertile, and I did get lost in the composition, albeit not in any way that earnestly felt like *grace*.

*“Well, I’d say that’s very natural, Meghan. Jeremiah’s grace is truly boundless.”* He replied, his voice sounding raspier than it had been before.

He flicked his desk lamp on, and the weak, phosphorescent light caused the Monsignor to materialize from the blackness.

But he had changed.

To my astonishment, the man looked older. *Decades* older. Dry, wrinkled skin with a liver spot under his left eye. His hair was the same color, but it now appeared thin and brittle, not wavy and luxurious like it had been before. I tried to convince myself it was a trick of the eye. Some optical illusion manufactured by the scarlet haze. But then my mind went to the thought of Apollo’s liquefied body, and how impossible *that* felt when I first saw it.

*“Now, let’s get you settled in, yes? The day’s sessions should be starting soon, so there’s not a moment to waste. You’re paying a lot of money to be here, after all.”*

*“Fear not, though. Your immaculate conception is just around the corner. We boast a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. Jeremiah’s miracle will provide, as it has for the many men and women who've come before you.”*

I shook his cold, withered hand and followed him out of the office.

It was fortunate that I had a full carton of cigarettes nestled in my pants pocket, because when we returned to the lobby, my belongings were gone. Despite Monsignor’s reassurances, I’d never see any of them again. Clothes, toiletries, car keys, my taser, extra cigarettes - all vanished. Never saw my sedan again, either.

After a few steps, he paused.

*“Huh…”* he whispered.

*“We really lost track of time, I suppose.”*

I peered down at my watch.

*10:53PM*.

Somehow, we’d spent almost twelve hours in his office.

I couldn’t understand it. Not a single piece of it. That conversation felt like it lasted thirty minutes, max. I didn’t feel the pangs of nicotine withdrawal, either. Normally, I couldn’t go more than a few hours without my stomach twisting into knots, begging for the chemical.

I didn’t like that *he* was surprised by it, either. The chapel and the cult were born of the impossible - its foundation was inherently supernatural. One would expect the Monsignor to be completely desensitized to unexplainable phenomena.

But if he didn’t comprehend how we’d lost half a day in that office, under the foreboding glow of Jeremiah’s wayward miracle, well, what the hell did *that* signify?

Last, and maybe most distressingly:

The sun should have set four hours before we left that room. So then, what light was coming through the glass?

I needed space to ward off a panic attack.

*“I’m…I’m going to go out front to smoke, okay?”* I stuttered, showing the Monsignor my carton of cigarettes.

*“That’s fine, but I will not be accompanying you. Do not, under any circumstances, stray from the premises. If you pass beyond the statue of Jeremiah, I cannot assure your safety,”* he replied, his tone laced with the faintest echos of fear.

I considered asking him *why* that was important, but I didn’t think my mind could have accommodated another iota of peculiarity, so I left it be.

*“Thanks.”* I mumbled.

Unfortunately, I was accosted by one final bizarre detail as I power-walked past the Monsignor. It was subtle, but the movement caught my eye.

Something was pulsing under his robe between his shoulder blades. A circular mound of tissue rising and falling out of rhythm with his breathing.

The marching beat of some second heart.

\- - - - -

I expelled a chest full of smoke into the atmosphere. The air smelled like sagebrush, earthy with a tinge of sweetness. I leaned on the oaken doors of the chapel, staring absently into the desert, saturating my vision with anything *but* Jeremiah and his children.

Relief washed over my skin like the sensation of goosebumps.

My breathing slowed.

I spun around, taking another drag as I looked the obscenely enormous cathedral up and down, drinking in the quiet eeriness of it all.

To my shock, a chuckle escaped my mouth. Followed by an honest laugh. First time I’d laughed in months, I think. The emotion felt foreign, almost alien, but intoxicating at the same time.

*“Nia would have fucking hated this…”* I muttered to myself, lit cigarette swinging between my lips.

This was the type of reckless behavior I used to fall victim to when I was young: when my career was at its peak and I was a proper journalist. In the last week, I’d purged my savings account to pay the cult’s membership fees, got myself trapped in a situation I didn’t completely understand, and acted on instinct rather than planning things out. She was always petrified I’d meet the reaper early because of my heedlessness. “Danger at every turn” and all that.

Which made my wife’s death devastatingly ironic: dying from carbon monoxide poisoning in her sleep, safely at home while I was abroad in the war-torn Middle East. Killed by a faulty furnace and a monoxide detector that was out of batteries. Of course, I was the one who took care of those sorts of things, and I’d forgotten to change the batteries before hopping on a plane the month prior. I know I didn’t kill her, but I wasn’t exactly blameless, either.

Before the year was out, for better or for worse, I was going to be joining Nia in the hereafter. My diagnosis was terminal. This investigation was a last hoorah, and, hopefully, my magnum opus.

I couldn’t face the idea of seeing her again without having done something worthwhile in the time I had left. I thought if I exposed this cult, it would give some peace to all the families who had lost someone during the hijacking. More importantly, Nia’s death wouldn’t be meaningless, because it would represent a steppingstone that led to this point.

I just had to keep pushing forward.

My laughter had long since stopped, replaced by all too familiar grief while those thoughts swam around in my head. I turned away from the chapel, about to flick the cigarette into the dirt, when I noticed someone a few yards away. Between the moonlight and the cigarette’s dim ember, I could barely see them. The short silhouette of a human being standing directly behind the small statue of Jeremiah positioned in front of the chapel.

I wasn’t even sure they were real.

But then they started waving at me.

It was the silhouette of the child. Didn’t take me more than a few seconds to figure out who it was. Just had to imagine them holding Apollo’s throat in the hand that wasn’t waving, and then it all clicked into place.

*Eileithyia.*

I considered getting closer, but then something happened that really put the fear of God into me.

Another silhouette peeked their head over the first’s shoulder. As they stepped out from behind the original, they started silently waving, too.

To my stunned horror, that multiplication kept happening. Over and over again until there were twenty-or-so identical child-sized silhouettes standing in a line, seemingly unable to move beyond the statue of Jeremiah. Reminded me of those paper doll chains I was forced to make in elementary school when the teacher was too hungover from the night prior to come up with anything else to do.

Then, they all stopped waving in unison, and I experienced a pressure against the front of my body. An expansion. Like every single cell in my body was being stretched at the same time.

It felt divine.

Suddenly, the chapel door behind me swung open, and a hand pulled me inside.

I experienced an uncontrollable rage, withdrawn from the pressure and the divinity.

Before I could even understand what was happening, I attacked the person who had just saved my life.

A favor that I’d end up repaying before I left [the mountain.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)
