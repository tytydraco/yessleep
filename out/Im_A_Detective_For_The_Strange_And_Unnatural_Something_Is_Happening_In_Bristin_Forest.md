Hello, I'm Detective Leo.  


 I've been snooping around A local forest lately and I noticed something was a bit strange as of late. I'd say this is more of a report than a journal entry but then i'd be lying to you. I usually don't go near Bristin Forest because of the spiders but a couple of nights ago, there was an exception.

I was out for a nightly walk around Bristin forest because it was eerily quiet even though I have very good hearing. I usually saw the spiders come out around this time as they wake up around nightfall but I assumed they were just, a little late. A cryptid doesn't always have an exact sleep schedule.

I continued walking down a trail and I saw footprints in the dirt. I crouched down and inspected the footprints. The footprint matches that of a boot and I was pretty sure I knew who it was. 

There is this family that lives in a cabin near these woods, Surprisingly they haven't died despite being in close proximity to the spiders and I think there were 3... no 2 people. A son and a Father. I couldn't quite remember their last name. 

Anyway, I decided to follow the footprints which led me to an unknown trail I have never taken. I was intrigued and continued following the trail at a quickened pace. I reached a clearing after a while and to my surprise, I saw the Father shooting at the spiders. He bravely defended what looked like a small shed. I rushed over and I watched him aim at me surprisingly fast. I managed to dodge the bullet and I scooped him up and ran for dear life. The Father dropped his gun but I doubt he cared at this point.

I eventually stopped near a road that was deserted and set the man down. I quickly turned and watched as 3 Arachina's approached me and lunged at me. I quickly ducked and slashed 2 of them on their abdomen. The last Arachina tried to escape but I lunged forward and managed to grab it before it has reached the safety of the shadows. I sunk my teeth into the spider and then quickly finished it off. I then turned to the Man...

"What the hell are you"?! The man said, trying to stay brave.

"Why were you disturbing Arachina's". I asked bluntly.

"Disturbing...What"? The man asked, clearly dumbfounded.

I went to facepalm but failed as my skull was blocking me from doing so.

"You...Attacked...The....Spiders...." I said extremely slowly so he could understand.

"I attacked the spiders to defend my SON". The man said. "My son is now not protected because of YOU". He finished angrily.

"I was just trying to he-". I was cut off.

"I don't care what kind of wannabe hero you wanna be. Just bring me back to my son and leave me and my family Alone"! He yelled.

I lowered my skull and obliged. I quickly picked him up and started running towards the direction of the shack. As we quickly made our way there, we saw lights and heard gunfire.

"What the hell is going on over there". I Asked, turning to face the man.

"Hurry up, HURRY UP"! The man yelled, now hyperventilating.

We made our way to the now decimated shed and I was able to glance at a helicopter flying off. We were surrounded by dead Arachina's.

"It's too late, He's gone". The man said, falling to the ground.

"Who were those people"...? I asked.

"I work for a government facility. It was a secret- I-I sent a distress call and now they probably think i'm dead. There's no way I will find my son again". He rambled.

"I..." I was at a loss for words. I had come to help this man and investigate what was happening but it seemed like I had just made everything worse. I sat down and pitied myself.

The man got up and started walking away.

"Where are you going"? I asked.

"Home". He replied in monotone.

I didn't stop him and just continued to sit where I was... I eventually fell asleep. 

The next day I woke up to rain pouring over my body. I got up and shook the water off of me and tried to remember what happened the previous night. I saw the shed and everything came back at once. I thought of what to do and I ran towards where the man had run off to.

I got lost and just made my way back to the town. I made my way towards an abandoned apartment building nearby. I quickly reached room 122 and went inside...

I sighed and thought of what to do. I looked around and saw that I had left my laptop on. It won't hurt to tell people, right?   


I typed this out for help or advice. If anyone knows any tips or any advice, it would really help. Anyway, I'm just gonna stay in my room for now and enjoy some coffee.
