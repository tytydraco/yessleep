I've always been a sucker for old bookstores. There's something magical about the smell of aged paper and the whisper of stories waiting to be discovered. Last week, I stumbled upon a hidden gem in the corner of a forgotten street in my town. The sign outside read "Avid Reader's Retreat," and the peeling paint suggested it had been there for decades, maybe longer.

When I pushed open the creaky door, a small bell chimed, announcing my arrival. The store was dimly lit, with narrow aisles lined with bookshelves that seemed to stretch on forever. The air was thick with dust, and a sense of stillness hung in the atmosphere.

I wandered through the aisles, running my fingers over the spines of ancient volumes. That’s when I saw it—a thin, leather-bound book with no title on its spine. It looked out of place among the other books, almost like it was waiting for someone to find it. Curious, I pulled it from the shelf and opened it to the first page. The handwriting was neat but shaky, like someone had written it in a hurry.

The words were in a language I didn’t recognize, but as I flipped through the pages, I noticed a few English sentences scattered throughout. One of them caught my eye: "Beware the woman in white." 

As I read those words, a chill ran down my spine. I felt like someone was watching me. I quickly shut the book and glanced around, but the store was empty. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. I decided to buy the book. As I approached the counter, an old man appeared out of nowhere. He had a kind face but looked at me with a strange intensity.

"That book," he said in a raspy voice, "has been waiting for you."

I chuckled nervously. "What do you mean?"

He didn't answer. Instead, he rang up my purchase, his eyes never leaving mine. I paid and hurried out of the store, the bell chiming behind me.

That night, I couldn't stop thinking about the book. I decided to take another look at it. As I flipped through the pages, I found another English sentence: "She will come for you at midnight."

I laughed it off, thinking it was some sort of prank or part of a strange story. But as midnight approached, I started to feel uneasy. The air in my room grew cold, and I felt a sudden draft, even though all the windows were shut. Then I heard it—a soft, almost imperceptible humming.

I froze, my heart racing. The humming grew louder, and I realized it was coming from the hallway outside my room. I grabbed the book and opened it again, desperate for an explanation. The pages flipped on their own, stopping at a drawing of a woman in a flowing white dress, her eyes dark and hollow.

The humming stopped.

I looked up and saw her. She was standing in my doorway, her white dress glowing in the darkness. She stared at me with those empty eyes, and I couldn't move. I wanted to scream, but no sound came out.

Then she spoke, her voice a haunting whisper. "You found my book."

I don’t remember what happened after that. I woke up the next morning on the floor of my room, the book clutched in my hands. The woman was gone, but her words echoed in my mind.

I tried to return the book to the bookstore, but when I went back, it was gone. The building was boarded up, and it looked like it had been abandoned for years. No one in town seemed to remember it ever being there.

Now, every night at midnight, I hear that humming. I don’t know what she wants or why she’s haunting me, but I’m terrified to find out. If anyone has any idea how to break this curse or has experienced something similar, please help. I don’t know how much longer I can take this.
