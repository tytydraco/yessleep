&#x200B;

We’ve been spending some time making food for our Halloween celebration. Since we’re all going to get high to the stars and moon, we figured this would save us some time. Speaking of weed, we might try some cannabis recipes. I’ve never done it before, though so I’m a little apprehensive. This isn’t ordinary weed. It’s actually from Zohl’s ship. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That shit literally had us levitating so we gotta go easy on it.  Anyway, with the small talk out of the way, I’ll pick up where I left off yesterday. Sleeping on the floor isn't ideal. Still, at least the carpet was soft. We made some breakfast of water, trail mix, beef jerky, and pepper Jack Cheez-Its and then continued on our way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"By the way, how are we going to carry all of the orbs?" I asked, the two currently in our possession in hand.

&#x200B;

"Allow me," Zohl replied and took something out of his pocket.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A first glance would show it as nothing more than a cloth bag much too small for the orbs. However, he demonstrated that the bag possessed incredible elasticity and fit the orbs inside. The way the orbs moved around reminded us of a certain part of the anatomy that made us giggle. Immature, I know. Would you expect anything less, though?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We came to the next door, opened it, and went in. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Tombstones?" Nick said. "So we're at a graveyard?"

&#x200B;

"Then what's with that lab table over there?" Stevenson asked, pointing right.

&#x200B;

"Then it's a mad scientist lab in a cemetery?" I said.

&#x200B;

"Just go with it," Carl told me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shrugged and then we searched for the orb. Shortly later, we found it and something else that made my heart sink. On a medical table was a humanoid creature covered in a sheet. Anyone who's heard of Frankenstein will know where this is going. Fortunately, nothing was happening yet probably because we did not have the third orb yet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I see it," Nick called out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was embedded to the top of a lightning rod that was attached to the monster's table. Its color was a sickly yellow with green specs. We already knew what would happen when we grabbed it so we decided to get things over with. However, what happened next, we were not expecting.  My muscles tensed from nervousness as the graves of the dead were being clawed from the inside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We thought the zombies were going to crawl out slowly in dramatic fashion or they would do so fast all while making weird moaning noises. Instead, they popped out, four feet in the air, and landed in front of us. The monster was snapping off his restraints and the sheet fell off, revealing its appearance to be a cross between Boris Karloff's portrayal of it and Robert De Niro's.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Stay close," Zohl warned. "There's no telling when they may attack." 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They all stepped forward in sync and then snapped their fingers. We titled our heads in confusion as the zombies broke out in coordinated dance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They’re thriller zombies,” Nick exclaimed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Equal parts bewilderment and fear came over me. Seeing them perform would have been pretty entertaining if they weren’t trying to kill us. Not only were they dancing, the monster was too. It swiped at us with its massive arms. We ducked and it transitioned into a ballerina spin, kicking its leg out. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nick was hit, sending him sliding back through the gravel. We shouted his name, attempting to run to his aid. Unfortunately, the zombies had other plans. Thankfully, this was an instance where normal gunfire proved effective. Even when the zombies got shot they fell dramatically, putting the back of their hands atop their foreheads and fainting backward. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nick fired at them as well and managed to slip away from them. While our weapons worked on them, the monster wasn’t so easy to contend with. It leaped gracefully into the air, grabbing Carl and me by the back of our shirts. We didn’t even get a chance to get out so much as an “oh shit” before being flung away like paper balls. Zohl was in the path of projection which was lucky for us and unlucky for him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We slammed into him, making us all fall to the ground.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That hurt,” Zohl said.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, sorry about that,” I replied as we were scrambling to our feet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We checked on the others to see Stevenson with the orb being chased and Nick on the monster’s back, stabbing it repeatedly. Despite his best efforts, his attacks weren’t making any lasting impact. The monster transitioned into doing the worm to bounce him off and then it did an upside-down breakdance spin, kicking him and Stevenson away. It grabbed the orb and swallowed it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh, that’s just fucking dandy,” Carl said sarcastically. “How’re we supposed to get the orb now?”

&#x200B;

“By going up against a twelve feet tall monster,” I replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Speaking of which, it was now moonwalking in our direction. In spite of its size, it was fast. It punched at us and we dodged. Our biggest disadvantage was that its weakness wasn’t accessible to us. The only one we could think of was, maybe fire. Unfortunately, we didn’t have any quick way to make it. Knowing this did not do much to decrease the close-to-death sensation I was getting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Carl, you wouldn’t happen to have another grenade on you?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Sorry, no. They aren’t exactly cheap.”

&#x200B;

“Damn it. There has to be something we can use.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I fished into my pockets and to my surprise, I did find something that would prove to be a necessity. During our downtime, I went out and found the shards of the broken dagger my parents used. We were going to try and see if we could put it back together, but apparently, I still had a piece on me. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Carl, look,” I exclaimed, showing it to him.

&#x200B;

“That’s great. Pete. How are we supposed to use it, though?”

&#x200B;

“I don’t know. Maybe we can tie it to the end of a knife.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My idea was to use a piece of my shirt to do it. What happened instead was, the piece moved on its own and attached to the combat knife I drew out, seeping into it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s new,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Asking how or why that happened could wait. For now, we needed to take this monster down. While my weapon looked the same, its feeling was now entirely different, the same as the dagger felt. The monster moved fast and my heartbeat halted when it appeared in front of me. Reflexively, I stabbed its abdomen, and it cried out in pain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It brought up a knee, hitting me in the chest and making me drop the knife. Before I could recover, my breath was stopped by it planting its massive foot on my chest. I desperately felt around for the knife and found it nowhere near me. It brought up its other foot above my head. Realizing with chilling terror what it was going to do, I bought my arms in a fruitless attempt to shield myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The sole of its shoe made contact with my arm when it suddenly stopped. Confused, I squinted to see a surprised expression on its face. Then its head fell off and it with it. The sound of it hitting the ground was akin to hearing a boulder drop from a cliff.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are you okay?” Zohl asked, holding my knife and reaching down to help me up.

&#x200B;

“Other than nearly getting my skull crushed, yeah,” I replied, taking his hand and allowing him to pull me to my feet.

&#x200B;

“Good, now let’s collect the orb.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The monster’s corpse was on its back. He stuck the knife in its chest, dragging it downward. Blood spurted from the incision.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Gross,” Nick said, “how about a little warning next time?”

&#x200B;

“Apologies, this is the only way to get what we need.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He fished into the body and yanked out the orb.  With it now with us, we got out of there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’re already halfway there,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Door number four threw us into chaos straight away. This time haunted suits of armor charged at us. My mind flashed back to another incident where I was running for my life from an eldritch abomination knight. Needless to say, it wasn’t a good memory and this wasn’t a good situation to be in. Zohl was quick, stopping a sword by the handle in midair as it was being swung at him. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With a yank, he forced the armor to let go of it. Then he kicked the armor down which made it crash into several others. Past them was a suit of pale white armor. In the breastplate was the orb which was black with a yellow star in the middle. We needed to get close. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was going to be easier said than done. Of all people, it was actually Stevenson who managed to help us win. I”m still not sure what happened exactly. All I can say is that amidst the chaos, and us trying not to get decapitated, he somehow came face to face with the head knight. It tried to cut him and he panicked, jumping out of the way. The knight tripped and fell on its sword, dislodging the orb.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The second it was out of it, all the armor became lifeless.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, good job,” Carl told Stevenson. 

&#x200B;

"Two left," I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We went downstairs next and found a bunch of coffins.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Alright, get the stakes ready," I ordered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We got them out of our packs. Figuring, the orb would be in the most unique coffin, we went to it and lifted the lid. Then we pounded a stake into his heart, resulting in him turning to ash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"That takes care of that," Carl said. "Now, where's the orb?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We searched every inch of the coffin and yet it wasn't there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I don't understand," Stevenson said. "Wasn't this the head vampire?"

&#x200B;

"That's vampiress," spoke a feminine voice behind us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A chill wormed its way up my back. We turned and saw the vampire. I can't deny that she was beautiful. Too bad that was only skin deep. Speaking of skin, ours wasn't in a good spot.  Caught off guard, she was able to hypnotize us. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were practically under her control. I couldn't move or make my body listen to me in any way. I was in the passenger seat of my own mind. Her powers were working effectively on us guys, well most of us. Zohl wasn't phased.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He attempted to rush forward only for the other coffins to pop open and her minions to fly at him. She gave a wicked laugh as they tore into him. My heart tightened, knowing if something wasn't done, Zohl wouldn't last much longer. She smirked, beckoning Nick forward. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I willed myself to move or do anything to no avail. We thought for sure she would bite him and drain all his blood or turn him. Then as her hands were on his shoulders and she was about to sink her fangs into his neck, her expression shifted to one of confused pain.  Our autonomy returned. The vampiress staggered back, stake in her chest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When she too became ash, the other vampires did also.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Nick, how did you do that?" I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was nervous as he answered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Women…Don't really do it for me if you catch my drift."

&#x200B;

"Oh."

&#x200B;

"Is something wrong?"

&#x200B;

"No, I just never would have guessed. I mean, you never acted that way."

&#x200B;

"Is there a certain way I'm supposed to?"

&#x200B;

"No, I mean, not unless you want to and it doesn't matter what anyone thinks of how you choose to present yourself."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was awkward as hell. I'd never been in a situation like this. I'm sure Nick didn't think I was trying to be an asshole, but I still felt like one.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Well, thanks," I told him.

&#x200B;

"No problem."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The orb was located among the ashes. It was red with a blue teardrop in the center. As we were going back upstairs, I felt the need to address something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Nick?" 

&#x200B;

"Yeah?"

&#x200B;

"Listen, I think you're cool and appreciate how you've helped us, but I don't, you know, swing your way."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He gave me a look that basically said "really?".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I don't like you guys in that way."

&#x200B;

"Really? Because I don't want things getting weird between us."

&#x200B;

"Yes, now can we talk about this later?"

&#x200B;

"Right, sorry."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We went back to the main floor and then up the stairs and came to a large kitchen connected to a dining room. On the table was an enormous green apple that was twice Zohl’s height who is taller than all of us. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, I’m lost,” Carl said. “Anybody know what’s supposed to happen here?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We didn’t have a clue so we searched around. Oddly enough, the kitchen was in use. Pots were on the stove full of melted caramel, red candy liquid, and chocolate. Beside the pots was an assortment of different chopped nuts. We checked the oven and found some cookies in the shapes of bats, spiders, ghosts, and mummies.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The smell was incredible and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t tempted to try some. However, there were more important things to deal with. Eventually, it was Nick who spotted the sixth orb, sitting on the chandelier above the dining room table. It was orange with caramel-colored zig zags running through it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Did anyone see a ladder?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When that question was answered with no, Zohl stepped up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Allow me,” he said and then jumped high into the air.

&#x200B;

“His leg strength is insane,” Nick commented as we watched him snatch the orb.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When he came back down with it, shit got crazy. The apple shook and out poked one leg followed by seven others and then a pair of pincers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s…A crabapple,” Stevenson exclaimed in shock as two eyes poked out from the top of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Our current predicament was equal parts bizarre and frightening.  The crabapple almost seemed to glare at us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why do we always have to deal with this kind of weird shit?” I asked as we were backing away from it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The oddity let out a clicking chirp and jumped at us, bringing its massive claws down at us. We dodge rolled out of the way and the ground rumbled from the impact. Carl took his knife out and attempted cutting it. His blade simply slid off it as if it were made of stone. Using one of its claws, it knocked him away. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He grunted as he flew back, crashing into some pots and pans. Before any of us could ask if he was okay, the crabapple charged at us. With the size of its body, it was difficult to evade. Still, Nick, Zohl, and I did manage to get out of the way while Stevenson was sent through the air, screaming. It missed us by inches and cursed out of fear as it grazed past me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How do we hurt this thing?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“Perhaps, we should try attacking between the joints,” suggested Zohl, “and you should use your special knife, Peter.”

&#x200B;

“Huh?” I replied. “Oh, right.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Due to the oddness of what we were dealing with, it slipped my mind.  I drew it out and sprung at it, stabbing downward. The blade sunk into its skin and it chirped in anguish trying to shake me off.  Unlike the knife's other uses, it didn’t make it vulnerable to conventional weaponry. Still, Nick and Zohl were able to hurt it by stabbing between its joints.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried to stab it again. However, its reaction time was quicker than I anticipated. The fucking thing caught it by the blade. My eyes went wide when it did and then it tossed me over its head as if I were a discarded banana peel. I crashed through the dining room table and managed to see through pained vision that it crushed it, scattering shards everywhere. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nick and Zohl tried attacking it only for it to knock them away with its claws. Then using one, it lifted me up as stars were still dancing in front of my eyes. Of all the shit I’ve nearly gotten killed by, this was by far the most asinine. In a way, that made it even scarier.  I mean, if someone can choose how they’d die it would probably be in bed surrounded by friends and family or in some cool way like an explosion or a monster truck accident.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead, I was about to be bifurcated by one of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever seen. I screamed as its pincer was slowly squeezing my ribs. Then I heard a wet sound as if someone were shoving a knife into a Thanksgiving turkey. Suddenly, its grip loosened and I dropped to the now splintered table.  Luckily, nothing seemed to be broken so at least there was that. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Groaning, I sat up. Carl was on the crabapple, going absolutely beast mode on it. He was stabbing it repeatedly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Knives, kitchen,” he yelled at us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We took that to mean he’d used the shards on them. Sure enough, this turned out to be the case and we made the crabapple into a living knife holder. By the way, I should mention it bled apple cider which is good enough for me to still enjoy even after all that. Anyway, it eventually succumbed to its wounds. We thought that would be the end of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then its body burst into a bunch of flying apples which attacked us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“God fucking damn it,” I screamed, “How are they biting us?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They didn’t even have teeth and yet the sensation of sharp points digging into me was undeniable. In my panic, I stumbled back into the kitchen and tripped, forcing some of the flying apples to let go and fall into the pots. They tried flying out and the candy liquid and caramel solidified. They fell to the floor and stopped moving.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We did the same thing to the others and soon, we were catching our breaths around a bunch of now-dead flying candy, caramel, and chocolate apples. My stomach rumbled and absent-mindedly I grabbed a caramel one that had landed in some chopped pistachios. I chomped into it, chewing and then swallowing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Pete, what are you doing?” Nick asked me.

&#x200B;

“Hm?” I replied and then glanced down at the apple I was holding.

&#x200B;

“You don’t know what that might do to you.”

&#x200B;

“I mean, I don’t feel any different.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One was beside Nick. It was candy-coated. He picked it up, inspected it, shrugged, and took a bite. The others enjoyed some too and we decided to take them back with us. After all that, we could use some treats, and damn tasty ones at that. We left and I have to say, it felt as if we were in there for a long time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wasn’t wrong. See, there was some weird time shit going on with that place and we didn’t get out until a few days ago. We’ve been making preparations to enter the card tree portal. Hopefully, we can save everyone or at least a lot of them. I’m not sure when I’ll be updating again when I post this. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We’ll be attempting the rescue mission after Halloween because if we die trying at least we did it right after celebrating one of the best holidays of the year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wish you all a happy one. Make sure to eat a lot of candy, have fun, watch some scary movies, and cause a bit of chaos. This is Pete, wishing you all a fan fucking tastic [Halloween,](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) signing [out.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
