 I want to preface this by stating that this is a true story. This happened back in 2013 when I was in elementary school so I don’t have any pictures or means of proof to validate this story, but it’s something I’ve thought about a lot since it happened. 

I spent my elementary years at a school that was said to be haunted, particularly the bathrooms. Of course most of the stories could be passed off, kids talking about seeing knives that mysteriously disappeared in the bathrooms and traces of what seemed like blood appearing smeared atop the sinks, but it was hearing the janitors talk about creepy things from inside the school that made the thought of the place being haunted so real.

While I wasn’t myself involved in the conversation, I had overheard a janitor discuss with another member of staff that they heard voices from around the school after everyone else had left. According to what I had heard from him, the voices mostly seemed like they had come from the 3rd grade hallway, the hallway along which I had my class.

To give a little insight into the layout of the school, the 3rd grade hallway was just one hallway long that went straight down toward a side exit where kids could go after school and wait for their parents to show up and get them. Right outside of my classroom were the bathrooms, which, I feel should be stressed, were old and rather crusty, completely unlike the newly updated 1st and 2nd grade bathrooms. The 3rd grade bathroom scared me due to its high ceiling, visible tubing, stained walls, and a seemingly unworldly echo it contained. 

That was the bathroom the janitor said he heard the voices from, the same one I was so afraid of.

Directly to the right of the bathrooms was a door leading to an outdoor courtyard that basically rested right in the center of the school. It was a little place where we could do science experiments, have picnics, all sorts of things. It was a nice courtyard.

My story begins at the height of this sort of haunted phase everyone became consumed in that year.

One day, a little after St. Patrick’s Day, two of my best friends at the time had come in to school together talking about something they believed to be true, and whatever it was, it was grabbing everyone’s attention. Kids that had swarmed around them looked physically uncomfortable, and as they came up to me, they were sporting the childish looks everyone would make when falsifying scary tales; they looked serious.

When they got over to me they told me the story, the one that unbeknownst to us all began a month of what can only be described as terror.

They began their story.

They talked to me about how they had stayed the night together the night before and how they had been having a conversation about the strange and scary things they had witnessed around the school throughout the course of time they had been enrolled. They talked about the story of the knife that I mentioned earlier, about how people had felt the touch of someone who wasn’t there, and so many other tales that have never been proven by anything substantial.

That’s when my one friend’s grandpa walked into the room, he was there for some reason, overhearing what it was they had been talking about.

They told me that my one friend’s grandpa was intrigued by their conversation and that it brought back a memory from an experience he had when he went to that same elementary school about 60-65 years previous. 

They mentioned he had warned them that his story was very scary and that they didn’t have to hear it if they didn’t want to, but being the curious kids that they were they obviously did, and so my friend’s grandpa began with his story.

He said that when he was going to school during his third grade year, the bathrooms they had were the original bathrooms that had been installed when the school first opened and that while the bathroom nowadays was still very creepy, they were even creepier and even more unkempt and unsanitary looking back then. 

He told my friends that he wasn’t going to tell them the location, but that there was a secret door “hidden” somewhere along the floor of the elementary school, and not only that, but that a girl he knew and had been in his class had found the door and, for whatever reason, which still goes unsolved today, must’ve walked her way down the stairs that the door opened up to, and the only way that he knew anything about this was that he had asked to go to the bathroom at about the same time that that incident had taken place, her walking down the stairs that is, such that as he had left class he saw the door open and her step out, shutting the door back down into the ground as she stood up onto the floor of the hallway.

This girl was, as he put it “cut up and bruised so bad, it looked like she should have been dead.” He said that she was bloody all over, blood soaked into her skirt, her skin, visible cuts along her legs, and she gave off a facial expression (a smile) as if to say that she was fine. 

He told my friends that she walked her way over to the girls bathroom, he told his teacher about what he has seen, and 10 minutes later, she had been taken by an ambulance over of the building and toward a nearby hospital. She was pronounced dead on arrival.

He said he couldn’t give them anymore details because he wasn’t given many himself. He said that he had seen enough and that they didn’t want to tell him more due to the overwhelming nature of the incident and the fear of what damage that incident could have on the psyche of such a young child. 

He said all he could say is that he saw her come of out that door with a blank expression despite what pain she must have been in from such heavy cuts, she had turned to him and gave a slight smile, and then she had walked into the bathroom, he never getting the chance to ask her what happened. 

Who had caused those cuts? Why had she gone down there in the first place? 

What was down there?

He had no idea, but he knew that immediately after her death they renovated the bathrooms and made them at least a bit better than they were originally both the boy's and girl's bathrooms. He said the school “did something” to hide the door so that no one else would try going down there and meet a similar fate.  

He said that was the end of the story. My friends weren’t satisfied, although definitely freaked out, and asked him if he could describe what the door looked like. He said sure.

According to him, the door was wooden and looked old, like if anyone stood on top of it it would cave in. The door had a hole where the doorknob would typically be, and back when he went to school, it was just laying out in the open. People knew they weren’t supposed to step on it because of its frail appearance. He stated once more that they had done something to hide the door, saying he knew exactly what they had done because of returning for parent-teacher conferences, but he refused to say where it was, only that he felt it was scary. 

Not scary in just the sense that the door itself scared him, but where it was placed or the manner in which it was hidden scared him. My friends didn’t understand that part but they definitely did everything else, and so as they woke up after their sleepover (after being barely able to get themselves asleep) they came to school and told the story to everyone they could, anyone who would listen.

Everyone, everyone did.

They told people they didn’t even recognize, they told me (probably the sole reason this story is getting out there at all), and as the sort of hysteria broke out, they even started telling teachers that would listen about what their grandpa had told them. 

Now usually this wasn’t a big deal. Other rumors about scary things had come out much more than once, so on paper, this wasn’t anything too noteworthy. At least, not typically.

Partially based on their seriousness and I’m guessing some other factor, it actually seemed like the bulk of teachers that they told legitimately believed them and were almost as creeped out as everyone else was. Kids were screaming about it inside and outside, and it got to be a lot for teachers to deal with hearing about this story that they had never heard of that may or may not have really happened in their place of employment. I know if I had worked there at that time I would’ve been slightly freaking out.

Keep in mind the school was legitimately questioned as to whether or not it was haunted. The teachers were well aware of this and already unnerved about the whole situation involving the janitors discussing their experiences. 

Real or not, it seemed after the story was told the school gave off a different kind of feel, as if all the truly scary elements the school displayed and all of the signs of its age suddenly became more prominent, and on the back of everyone’s mind was the thought that there was a chance someone had died in the building they’re at 5 times a week for at least 8 hours at a time. 

The one thing that stopped full-scale paranoia was the realization that no new article could be found surrounding the case, so how could the story be true if no one had seized the opportunity to take it as a headline for the local newspaper? It seemed fishy.

For a month, whether or not any official reports could be found about what my friend’s grandpa went through, everyone I knew kept in a state of skepticism and high alert, and everyone, whether I knew them or not, everyone who heard the story wanted to find that door.

Where could it be? If his grandpa had seen her walk out of it and then into the bathroom without anyone else seeing, shouldn’t that mean the door was close to the girl's bathroom? I was convinced that it was, but I nor anyone else could find it. We just couldn’t. That is until a month had passed.

Mid-April that year truly sparked a rebirth of the weather, and it seemed like as soon as we had gotten past the first week of April it had immediately stopped being so cold and had gone head-first into Spring.

On one of the first days that it began feeling normal out again, the 3rd grade teachers each picked a day, and for that week, one class each day got to go outside and have a picnic in the courtyard. They had benches surrounding the courtyard but you could also sit on the ground on a little sidewalk that connected the 3rd grade entrance to the 2nd grade entrance on the other side. They had begun planting flowers already and it smelled amazing out. I loved it.

A minute or two before it was time to come in my teacher propped open the door that led back inside and told us that it was about time to get ready and get everything packed up. I had already picked my stuff up and had thrown my trash away, and so, wanting to be the first kid back inside, I ran to the door and up my way in. There was a problem, though.

In my little hurry to try and get back inside first, I had forgotten that you had to step up into the school because the ground outside was a little lower than the floor of the tiles inside, and so as I ran up inside I tripped and fell face first onto the welcome mat they had right by the door. I came in hard enough that I had basically taken the welcome mat with me.

As I came back to my senses, I looked at the welcome mat I moved, but something else caught my eye.

A door. A door on the floor. And suddenly, the concerned looks on the teachers' faces all made sense.

Hidden under the welcome mat was an old-looking wooden door. The door had a hole where the doorknob would’ve been so it was hidden well under the mat without a doorknob sticking up. Everything was as my friend’s grandpa had described. I was scared, and I let out a cry. Everyone saw what had caused me to do that, and then a commotion broke out.

I had found the door.

It concerns me even up to this point in time why the door was kept there and why something wasn’t done about it. It really did look old, wasn’t that a safety hazard? Why would they hide the door instead of doing something else like making sure absolutely no one stepped on it? I get that they just didn’t want anyone knowing about it so no one would try and go down to wherever it led, but it just seems dangerous.

And also, of course, where would a door like that lead?

I remember checking on maps of the school and no map that I ever found listed the door as anything that led anywhere else.

There was a day about a week later when a kid I knew lifted the door (which I should add was easy to lift) and in doing so, discovered that there were creaky-looking stairs that led down somewhere, but darkness consumed the bottom of the staircase.

It still bothers me when I think about it. I doubt the story my friend’s grandpa shared every time it comes to mind, but then I get thinking something else, that maybe it is real and just didn’t make it into any articles. I doubt if I’ll ever know, but I truly and sincerely hope the story isn’t real.
