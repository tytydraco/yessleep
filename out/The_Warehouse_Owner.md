Hi. I'm sorry if the story seems off; this is the first time I write this story for people other than myself. To start, I want to say that I am safe now; the events I'm going to share happened 7 years ago and I am working to accept it, god knows I won't forget. 

At 18, everyone I held close left to go to college; I was the only one to work right out of high school. I just needed any money as I wanted to go to film school the year after. The problem was finding a good job available for a kid with no experience. My only rule was 'no fast food' as I know how stressful that environment could be and I didn't want to talk to people. 

I was considering being a stocker at a grocery store until I walked across an electricity pole with stapled papers all over. One stood out though. It read 'Warehouse Job' in bold lettering. It had a phone number that I decided to call. The man who responded sounded sweet but older with a slight southern accent.

The Owner: "H-hello this is James's Warehouse and Storage who is this."

Me: "Hey, I saw your ad on a-. I would like to work for you."

The Owner: "First job huh. That's cool. Yeah. Come in Monday at 8:30 and I'll tell you what to do."

Me: "Yeah. Okay. See ya Monday. Bye

The Owner: "Bye kid."

I know now that this entire short conversation was wrong but I didn't know, it was my first job and my parents didn't care enough to ask where I was at any point. I died to them as soon as I told them I didn't want to go to college. Sorry for rambling I still get emotional.

Monday came and I went to the address on the paper, it was a 20 minute walk away from home; easy to memorize and repeat. The job was easy enough; move boxes from one wooden pallete to another. The business was small so there were only a handful of workers on this huge warehouse, they usually did hard drugs or left early knowing no one would notice their absence. I was the only one to stay and soon, I was asked by the owner to do overtime; I quickly said yes. I think this is when everyone else was fired; I never saw them again. At the time I figured we were just stocking in different areas but I never heard them anymore. This is when it started.

Everyday was the same so they're all melted together in my mind. I know it started with taps, I would think of a rhythm and hear the metal holding up the pallets tinging in according to the same rhythm. It was loud as I could hear it through my headphones, when I tool them off the sound kept going as if it wanted to be noticed. The tings turned to voices. I'd be moving a pallete to hear groans of pain or my name being called out by the owner only to look and see nothing. These two small things continued to the point where I stopped wearing my headphones. Somehow it turned visual.

After only 2 months there I was tired and filled with regret. At this point everyone I knew before officially went of to control their future while I worked my ass off there. This place was everything; it was my life. Sorry. Anyway, I started seeing shadows everywhere. It was always lit of the corner of my eyes but it happened too often. It felt like I deceived myself. These shadows roamed and I felt like I just knew they were all men. They ranged in size from 5'8 - 6'7. The more days went by the closer they got. I think they got comfortable with me being around. It all changed in one second.

Up until this point I felt safe. But, on my 4 month anniversary if working there, I was moving boxes until I heard my name. I didn't want to turn around. I felt a warm hang touch mine; a hand that felt hurt. I turned around to see a pale woman around my age. Her hair was well kept and she was wearing a hospital gown. She smiled at me. This expression was shared for what felt like minutes until she broke the silence with "Your next. I liked you and maybe I'll see you soon. Talk to the owner." I wad more confused than anything. I didn't feel scared and saw her fade away into nothingness. I hope to see her again.

 I felt I was ready to move on and go somewhere else. I was tired of every small thing I small, even if I felt safe I didn't want to feel them anymore. The owner gasped seeing me in his mess of an office. I guess I hadn't seen him or his office since my first day where he showed me around. As long as money came in I didn't care.

He yelled.

The owner: "Why do you want to leave! Tomorrow is your day! 

Me: "What? What do you mean? How did you-"

The owner: "Everyone else is gone you idiot! It's your turn!

Me: I-I. Quit. I quit!
I didn't know what I wad doing, I just ran. I ran to the exit and never came back. I didn't know what he was talking about but I felt it had nothing to do with me. I heard the door close when I ran out but I heard it open and close again after me. I was sure he was running after me so I kept running and didn't stop until I got home. I called the police on the report of feeling unsafe and being chased. I overexaggerated  but ut got the job done. Blood was found in his office appearantly coming from every other coworker I had. I don't know who the girl is and never will.

This was it. I'm sorry if it's anticlimactic but I'm still trying to process what I saw and where I would be. The bodies were never found but the man is in prison. That's all that matters. I hope this helps me and I hope you enjoyed the slivers I remember. I hope I accept and I hope that girl had nothing to do with that place.
