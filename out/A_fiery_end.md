The sky turned an unsettling shade of orange, casting eerie shadows over the city. Sarah and Mia stood on the roof of their apartment building, the chill of impending doom wrapping around them like a suffocating blanket. “I can’t believe this is how it ends,” Sarah said, half-laughing, half-crying. “Stuck on a roof with you, watching the apocalypse unfold. Talk about a romantic evening.”

Mia chuckled, but it was a hollow sound. “At least it’s not a boring date, right?” She glanced at the horizon where the comet blazed, a fiery harbinger of destruction. “I always thought we’d go out with a bang, but this is a bit much.”

They both knew that hiding wouldn’t save anyone. The news had been relentless, broadcasting the inevitable collision like a countdown to their doom. People had rushed to shelters, barricaded themselves in homes, but deep down, they all understood: there was no escaping this. “You think anyone down there is still pretending it’s not happening?” Sarah asked, pointing at the streets below, where frantic people ran like ants, some still clutching their phones, hoping for a miracle.

Mia shook her head, her eyes wide with fear. “If only they knew how futile it is. Like trying to outrun a freight train on foot.” She hugged herself, glancing at the sky again. “I just wish we had more time… more time to do everything we didn’t get to.”

“Like what?” Sarah asked, her voice trembling. “Go to Paris? Get that stupid cat we always talked about?”

“Exactly,” Mia said, a tear slipping down her cheek. “And maybe yell at the universe for being such a jerk. We were supposed to have our whole lives ahead of us!”

As the comet grew larger, the air thickened with a sense of finality. The ground shook violently, and the distant sound of sirens faded into a haunting silence. “Sarah, look!” Mia pointed as the comet blazed closer, illuminating the darkening sky. “It’s beautiful, in a terrifying way.”

“Yeah, beautiful like a horror movie,” Sarah replied, trying to lighten the mood. “You know, the kind where the characters think they can survive but end up—”

“—meeting a fiery end?” Mia finished, a bittersweet smile on her lips. “I guess we’re the main characters in this one, huh?”

“More like the tragic sidekicks,” Sarah said, her heart aching. “But at least we’re together.”

They stood hand in hand, the world around them crumbling as the comet blazed toward Earth. The heat intensified, and Sarah could feel the tears streaming down her face, mingling with the laughter that felt so out of place. “I love you, Mia,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the roar of the approaching disaster.

“I love you too, Sarah,” Mia replied, squeezing her hand tighter. “Always.”

As the comet struck, a blinding light engulfed them, and for a brief moment, everything was still. In that final instant, they clung to each other, hearts racing, knowing that even in the face of annihilation, their love would echo through the void. And then, as the world shattered around them, they were gone—together, forever lost in the chaos of the end.
