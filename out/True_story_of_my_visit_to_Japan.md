When I was eleven years old, my parents decided to take the family on a vacation to Mexico. They booked a highly-rated resort on the west coast, near Puerto Vallarta. It had several large pools, buffets, some waterslides and other cool amenities.

When we got there, the first thing we did was let our dog go for a swim in the ocean and then went to celebrate my 30th birthday. That’s when a man came up to us and started dancing in such a strange and disturbing manner… almost as if he was moving his body in ways none of us could imagine possible.

He then walked away but the encounter stuck in my mind for the rest of the day. I did a little swimming and hugged my dog in the pool, and we played a little catch before my sister said she was hungry. We went to a buffet and had dinner and then went back to our hotel room to watch some TV. I Ben though this place had a lot of American tourists, most of the channels were in Japanese and the news came from Tokyo.

I fell asleep shortly before midnight and woke up at 2:00 AM after hearing someone whispering outside. It was the same creepy dancing man, but this time he had a sombrero on and was wielding a ninja sword. He went into the room laughing like a maniac and told me he’s going to destroy the world, it was so scary. 

He started slicing everything and trashed the room before jumping off the balcony and landing on the plate of chicken that I had been eating earlier on the airplane. The flight attendant tried to grab him but he was running around like a maniac. Eventually the pilot learned of what was happening and landed the plane.

He said he had to consider a new line of work that involved some sort of ridiculous new spazzy dance club with record players and guitars that could ring throughout an auditorium like an amped up piano on caffeine, and not the coffee kind, the energy drink kind. He would slam down monster energy like a guy would if he needed it badly because he had just woken up from a coma the likes of which the world had never seen, and all the while he was just hoping and wishing that something could come and break him out of the horrible and horrific and terrifying trance that had been laid upon him when he first picked up the microphone and decided to enter the music industry. It was such an absolutely horrifying story that I began to scratch my eyes out like a lunatic under the impression that I would no longer have to look at the disturbing man that gave the story in the first place, but I was under a false impression that I could be saved by avoiding the disturbing reality that individuals like this exist and need to be taken care of in a humane way and not just ignored by those of us who are more fortunate than them and able to fit into the cookie cutter way of life that had been laid out for us by other people who were able to conform into a preset and totally arbitrary ideological lifestyle that dictates what can and cannot be seen and heard depending on if you are in Mexico or Japan. The man was so determined to convince us of his ridiculous beliefs that I almost at one point felt that maybe he is right, because perhaps no man could be so radically certain about a viewpoint or opinion unless there is a semblance of truth to it.

The man tried to follow us home but we lost him by speeding on the interstate. However, when I got back to my hotel room in Tokyo he was standing there, saying it was time to settle unfinished business. I will explain in Part 2.
