I’ve been working on some of those suggestions I was given. I’ve made a shrine to some old god and put food on it. I don’t know when I can take it off, and the person who recommended it isn’t responding so I’ve just left it there. There have been rats or something, but I haven't seen them. Sometimes I hear scratching when it’s quiet, probably from of the rotting food in the corner of the house. I’m going to give that guy a week or so before I clean it up. I’ve also been having strange dreams lately. I’ve been getting these weird dreams where I go and dig her up, but some of them are her digging me out. I don’t know what it means. Is it an answer to some of these rituals? Someone said I should sleep over her grave so her soul can connect to me better. Can anyone confirm some of these? I don’t want to be some weirdo sleeping in a cemetery if it isn’t going to do anything. 

As for things I have done, I tried a couple of different things I've seen online. I’ve tried the 11 mile game ritual and the midnight ritual, games that are supposed to have demons that come to get you, but at the end they’re supposed to grant you a wish. Nothing happened when I did them. Granted, I could have done it wrong, or they could just be stories, but I did the whole thing and got nothing. During these games, I would hear noises, I’d think I heard voices, but I don’t know if that was my mind playing tricks on me, my exhaustion from my lack of sleep, or if these creatures were actually there, but didn’t grant my wish. Someone asked if I had something to protect myself for one of these rituals, and yes, I do have a gun of my own. Best case, I feel slightly safer. Worst case, it's an easy out if one of these rituals goes wrong.

I’ve had to drag myself to work a few times, but I’ve convinced my boss that I could work from home. I said I could help them and grieve better if I’m at home, that way I can keep some of these rituals going without worrying about starving. I’ll have to show up to work some days, and if it’s anything like this last week… My coworkers have been avoiding me. I think some respect me enough to not give empty platitudes, but I doubt it. I think most are just uncomfortable. They don’t want to talk to the guy who always talked about his wife, especially now that she’s gone. They probably think I’ll drag them into a conversation and make them feel bad for me. I think the rest just avoid me because I’m the “weird” I.T. guy. I’m glad they’ve been avoiding me. It gives me some time to think about what to do next, which rituals make the most sense next. I’ve gotten plenty of suggestions, and some seem a bit far out there or useless even if they did work. 

I don’t know if I’m going insane, hyper focused, or if there’s something with me, but I feel like I have to talk about it, like lately I’ve been seeing my wife in the corners of my eyes, in mirrors, or outside. Whenever I try to look at her, it’s always just a shadow, a coat, or I’m just seeing things. I told most of that to my therapist and she said that’s normal. She said the mind sees what it wants to see. I wish that was the case. I think I’m ready to live in a fantasy, but fantasies always end. 

I went into her art room again. There's a beautiful painting that's only half finished. Dust has started to collect on it, but I almost don't want to touch it. The rest of her art stuff is exactly in the mess she left it in. Aside from the stuffy dust smells, it's almost like she's still here.

As for my physical condition, I think I’m getting worse. My body aches from one of the rituals someone suggested. My joints crack and shift. Sometimes I can only tell from quiet pops and cracks as I walk around the house, but that could also be old floor boards finally wearing down after all these years. The lights have also been going out in the house, and I don’t care enough to replace them right now. When we bought the house, we replaced everything at once. Now the light is leaving me too. While sitting on those damned stairs, I noticed some blood I had missed. The carpet at the bottom of the stairs is stained red, but I didn't notice a couple dots on the wall before now. I don't know if I want to clean it because that's a piece of her.

I’ve also found myself getting angry at people lately. I’ve been woken up from my sleep by nearby trains. Sometimes they blow their horns, but the thing that wakes me up most is the rattling doors and furniture. I also had a door to door salesman come to my door and when I looked out my window, he looked almost disgusted before running off. My wife’s friends have seemed to move on. I still get updates on social media and they’re out partying, going on vacation, and just living it up like they don’t care. I think there’s also someone with a garage workshop or maybe some kids that bang metal around randomly throughout the day and sometimes into the night. I can’t figure out where it’s coming from, but it's these furious banging and shaking metallic sounds. Sometimes it’s chains and sometimes it sounds like a sheet of metal or a hand saw wiggling. It’s hard to notice if I have music or a movie on, but I can hear it clearly when I’m waking up or going to sleep. I’ve only been woken from a nap once by whoever is playing with metal. It also never seems to come from the same direction.

I’ve realized that at some point, people are going to come over, so I bought some plastic tarps and anything that can make it look like I’m painting or redecorating. I've also bought a rug for that blood stain so people aren't weirded out.
