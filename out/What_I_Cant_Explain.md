  “It was the housekeeper that found her,” Smith said.

  “Christ, that poor woman,” I replied.

We both stared down at the remains of the girl on the ground in front of us. She lay in a tangled pile of limbs on the carpeted floor dressed in a tight white tank top, matching cotton panties and completely missing her head. The sight of it made my stomach turn a little bit. Just a few years ago, I might’ve just vomited outright. Hell, maybe if there was any blood at the scene I might have vomited outright.

&#x200B;

Smith stepped aside to let one of the crime scene photographers do his job and I followed him.

  “So what do we make of the lack of blood?” He asked.

  “My gut says body dump, but it doesn’t really add up,” I said. “Witnesses say they saw a girl coming in last night. They didn’t see her leave. Now, assuming it’s the same girl…”

  “She had to have been killed in the room,” Smith said. “And if she was killed in the room, where’s the blood? Bathroom’s clean. Not a fucking drop was spilled in there. There’s no blood on her clothes. No blood on the floor.”

&#x200B;

I nodded, before looking back at the body.

  “We’ll let the guys at the lab have a look, maybe they’ll see something we missed,” I said although I wasn’t so sure about that. If a woman gets decapitated in a fucking hotel room, you don’t just miss the pool of blood left behind and I highly doubted that our killer would clean up the blood but leave the body out in the open for all to see.

  “What if it’s not the girl who rented the room?” Smith asked. I looked over at him.

  “You think it’s someone else?”

  “Well, do the math. This looks like a dump, not a crime scene. If it walks like a duck and it talks like a duck…”

  “Alright, so we check the other rooms and go through the security camera footage, see if anyone brought anything up,” I said. “Maybe we can at least figure out if she was killed at the hotel or not.”

&#x200B;

Smith nodded before trailing off. I caught him staring at something on the TV stand by the foot of the bed and watched him approach it.

  “What’s up?” I asked and watched as he reached onto one of the shelves under the TV and took out a small gray box. It took me a moment to recognize what it was.

  “That a camera?” I asked as Smith turned it over in his hands.

  “Yeah… yeah, it is. Herriman, get me an evidence bag!”

I grabbed one for him and wondered if maybe we’d just hit the jackpot.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Three hours later, I watched as Smith put in the micro SD he’d gotten out of the camera. He opened up the file manager on his desktop and clicked into the card, opening up folder after folder of video clips. 

&#x200B;

  “Well, someone was busy,” He said as he clicked into one at random. He was greeted with a video of a petite girl with long, cascading brown hair sitting on a hotel bed, smiling up at the camera. She was dressed in a pretty standard french maid outfit, with ripped fishnet stockings and a headband with a pair of fluffy cat ears on it.

&#x200B;

  *“Hey there, Kitty Cat,”* a voice said off camera.

  *“Meow,”* she crooned, making paw gestures at the camera. Smith and I exchanged a look. He looked put off by the whole thing… although that didn’t surprise me. He’d always been put off by this sort of thing.

&#x200B;

We recognized the girl. She was the same girl that the hotel desk had identified as having checked into the room where we’d found the body. Catherine Leber, or *‘Kitty Cat’* as she was professionally known online.

&#x200B;

Leber leaned back on the bed, letting her skirt hike up and revealing the complete and utter lack of underwear that she was wearing, along with the soles of her feet. Smith figured it was best to stop the video there and I silently agreed with him.

&#x200B;

  “Well… least we know what she was filming with it,” Smith murmured.

  “Let’s take a look at the most recent video,” I said, watching as Smith clicked out of it. He sorted the folders by date, and clicked into the most recent one. From the thumbnail, I could recognize the bed from the hotel room where we’d found Leber’s body.

  “Looks like she was filming,” Smith said as he clicked into that video. 

&#x200B;

This one started almost the same as the other one had, with Leber reclining on the hotel bed, smiling up at the camera. She was dressed in the same white tank top and panties that we’d found her in and was (for lack of a better term), rubbing herself through said panties. 

&#x200B;

  *“Come on, baby…”* She crooned, and we watched as a hand reached out to take her by the ankle and lift one of her bare feet up off the camera. The camera was handed down to her, and turned around to show a plain looking man in his forties or fifties with almost cartoonishly large ears sucking on her toes, moaning aggressively while he did it.

  *“Yeah, baby… your toes taste so fucking good…”* He said. I think I saw Detective Smith die a little inside and I’m not entirely sure I could blame him.

  “So… think that’s our killer?” I asked, but Smith didn’t answer.

&#x200B;

  *“Come on baby, fucking smash it.”* We heard Leber say. I watched as our new primary suspect took the camera and brought it across the room, setting it down in the same spot where Smith would find it later.

&#x200B;

We watched as Leber got up on her knees and our unknown suspect returned to her. He kissed her deeply on the lips, and she wrapped her arms around him, pulling him in close.

  *“God, I wanna fuck you so bad…”* he said between breaths. He started undoing his pants. Although before he could get very far with that, he let out a cry of pain. He tried to laugh it off but pulled back from Leber just a little bit.

 

 *“Feisty, huh…”* He asked, although she pulled him back in for another kiss before he could do much else. He squirmed a little bit, trying to get away from her this time and when her grip on him didn’t let up, he started trying to push her off of him completely. But Leber still didn’t budge… and as the video continued to play, we saw her head start to change. It seemed to break open, her skull segmenting into pieces, her face coming apart. But what was underneath didn’t look normal.

&#x200B;

I’ve been on this job long enough to know what’s inside of a human skull, and everything I saw there was just *wrong.* Smith and I watched in a mixture of horror and disgust as her head became something else. A splayed meat flower, with pulsating pink innards. 

&#x200B;

The unknown man started to scream, but his screams were muffled. Lebers tongue seemed to be pushing down his throat, and we watched as the segments of her head loomed closer to his, before swallowing him up entirely.

  “Jesus…” I gasped, but Smith remained dead silent. I wanted to tear my eyes away from the screen, but I didn’t know if I could.

&#x200B;

The man thrashed, we could hear his cries for help. He desperately tried to push Leber off of him, and in some regards, he succeeded. Her head seemed to pull away from her body… but continued to engulf his, and after a moment, Leber’s body collapsed lifelessly to the ground while her head continued to cling to the man.

&#x200B;

As Leber fell, he stumbled backward, crashing against the wall and clawing at the thing on his head, the thing that no longer resembled the head of Catherine Leber. We watched him fight to try and get it off of him, and we watched as his struggles slowly grew weaker and weaker as he collapsed down to the ground, twitching in his final moments until all movement finally stopped.

&#x200B;

The camera kept rolling.

&#x200B;

For almost an hour, the camera kept rolling. 

&#x200B;

Then finally, we saw the man on the ground picking himself up. There was no sign of whatever had been on his head an hour ago. In fact, he looked downright normal, if not a little disoriented. We watched as he stared down at Leber’s body before looking directly into the camera. Slowly he approached it, starting to reach for it again when there came a sound at the door. A lock clicking. Housekeeping.

&#x200B;

Like a bolt of lightning, the man was gone. He was down on the ground again, and we saw him skitter under the bed, moving more like an insect than a human. Only a few seconds later, we watched the housekeeper come in, we saw her lay eyes upon the body of Catherine Leber and we heard her scream.

&#x200B;

We watched the discovery of the body play out exactly as it had been described to us, and as soon as the housekeeper left the room, the man crawled out from under the bed. He didn’t even spare another look at the camera this time, he just strode out into the hall and was gone.

&#x200B;

The room was empty. Smith and I just stared at the screen, unsure what to make of all that we’d just seen. If I hadn’t seen Leber’s body with my own eyes, I would’ve thought this whole thing was complete bullshit.

&#x200B;

But I’d seen the body.

&#x200B;

I’d seen the crime scene.

&#x200B;

I knew it was real.

&#x200B;

Smith closed out of the video again, his breathing a little heavier than before and an uncertain look on his face. He kept staring at the screen as if he didn’t know where else to look.

  “Next video…” I said quietly, and he looked back at me. I was desperately trying to keep it together, and dangerously close to failing. Maybe I could’ve been excused for running to the bathroom to vomit. But instead of doing that, for some reason, I just told Smith to play the next video.

&#x200B;

  “What?” He asked. He looked over at me. His face was paler than I’d ever seen it before. I could tell that he wanted nothing more than to shut that computer off and walk away. 

  “We need to go through the rest of the videos… see if we can’t find the one where that thing took Leber,” I said. 

Smith’s eyes narrowed but he didn’t protest.  He knew that I was right. He just closed his eyes, took a deep, trembling breath and went into the next folder. He hesitated for a moment, before clicking into the new video.

&#x200B;

The scene played out similarly to the way it had in the other two we’d seen. It started with a pan up toward a girl on the bed of a hotel room, only this girl was different. She had short blonde hair, a big bright smile, and she was wearing nothing but thigh-high boots. She was nude, but laying on her stomach with her feet up so the camera could get a good look at them.

  *“God you look so sexy,”* A voice said off-camera. I recognized it as the voice of the man from the other two videos and Smith looked over at me.

  *“You wanna cum all over my boots, Daddy?”* The blonde asked.

  *“Yeah, I wanna cum all over those boots,”*

&#x200B;

  We turned the video off and moved the next one. The same setup as before, only this time the girl was a brunette in a bikini. Smith watched the scene play out for a moment, barely even flinching at the fact that he was basically watching pornography. I think it was the first time since I’d met him that I didn’t see him react to sex with a disgusted grimace. 

  *“Fuck yeah, baby… God, I’m gonna throat those fucking toes,”* A voice said. The same one from the other videos. 

  “It’s not her camera,” Smith said. “It’s his.”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

We were able to ID the blonde in his high heel video as Samantha Landing, and Landing was able to give us a name.

&#x200B;

Mark Willis, also known online as *‘Hell On Heels*’. He produced and starred in amateur pornography. 

&#x200B;

Everybody’s gotta have a hobby, I guess.

&#x200B;

Landing wasn’t able to tell us where he was, but she gave us just about everything we needed to find him.

  “Mark’s a bit of an eccentric,” She said. “He’s nice and he’s always been very professional whenever I’ve worked with him. He make sure he knows my boundaries, he makes the shoot fun and comfortable. But he’s also… I don’t want to call him weird but… okay, take his car for instance. It’s not very subtle...”

&#x200B;

*Not very subtle* was an understatement. According to her description, it was a 2010 BMW covered in bumper stickers, saying shit such as: *‘I love toes.’, ‘Show me your toes.’, ‘MILF Hunter.’, ‘I Heart Feet’, ‘HELL YES! I suck toes!’* and a Catholic cross with the word: *‘Unashamed’* beside it. I think I saw the light in Detective Smith’s eyes begin to fade a little as she described it to him. 

  “And he drives this in public?” He asked.

  “Yeah, all the time.”

Detective Smith physically stopped himself from sighing and made a note on his notepad. 

  “We’ll keep an eye out for it, then.” He said.

&#x200B;

As expected, it didn’t take all that long for someone to find Willis’ car. Two days after we interviewed Miss Landings, someone spotted it at a ‘men's bathhouse’ downtown. So Smith and I took a drive out that way. 

&#x200B;

We hadn’t shared what we’d seen on the video with anyone outside of our immediate superiors, not yet. We hadn’t even formally described Willis as a suspect, just a Person of Interest. Truth be told, I’m not even sure we knew what to expect if we did find Willis at the bathhouse. Would we find Mark Willis, a regular man who’d left some bogus video for us to find, or would we find something else entirely…

I think we were both afraid of the latter.

&#x200B;

The drive down there was tense. Tenser than any other drive I’ve been on during my career. Smith and I didn’t speak at all during it. I wondered if maybe we both secretly hoped that by the time we got there, Willis’ car would be gone, or maybe it would even be a false ID.

&#x200B;

But no.

&#x200B;

When we got there, the BMW hadn’t moved. It was still sitting there in the parking lot when we arrived. We only needed to look at it to know that it was the right car. The bumper stickers gave it away. Smith went around to look through the windows but saw nothing inside. The car was empty and there was only one other place to look.

&#x200B;

  “You want me to go in?” I asked him. “There’s gotta be a guy at the desk inside I can talk to. You can have a cigarette or something,”

  “No. It’ll be better if we both go in,” Smith sighed and without another word, walked into the gay bathhouse. 

&#x200B;

There was a small room on the other side of the door with a window on one wall, and a laminated sheet with a list of prices and products on it. Neither of us looked at it. Smith just took out his police badge and handed it through the window.

  “We’re looking for a man that might be here, do you mind if I show you a picture?” he asked, calm and professional as always. 

&#x200B;

The guy at the window looked scared out of his goddamn mind, but still gave a hasty nod.

  “Yeah… sure thing,” He said. “Look, we’re not trying to cause any trouble here.”

  “Relax. We’re not trying to either,” Smith said, taking a photo of Willis out of his pocket and handing it to the guy in the window. He studied it for a moment before handing it back.

  “Yeah, that’s Mark. He’s in here all the time,” He said. “Shit, is he in some kind of trouble?”

  “Where would we find him?” Smith asked.

  “Room 2, you go past the lockers and down the hall to your right.”

&#x200B;

Smith nodded as the attendant let us in. Slowly, we walked down to the end of the hall. Smith paused, looking into one of the nearby rooms, and grimaced.

  “This is why I never got married…” He said under his breath before continuing onward. I made a mental note to go back and check out the prices in the entryway and kept following him.

&#x200B;

We rounded the corner and found door 2 closed tight. Smith and I exchanged a look, before reaching for our guns. This was it. Neither of us really knew what to expect on the other side of that door, Mark Willis, or something else entirely.

Smith pounded on the door.

  “Mark Willis?” He called.

&#x200B;

There was no response and Smith didn’t bother asking a second time. He tried the door, finding it unlocked before pushing it open. He raised his gun, only to pause the moment he saw the naked, headless corpse of Mark Willis on the bed and not a drop of blood to be seen on the sheets.

&#x200B;

I saw him grimace, this time in rage, not disgust. 

  “Talk to the guy at the desk, I need to know who came in here!” Smith demanded, although I already had a feeling there wouldn’t be much point to it. Any number of guys could’ve come and gone from that room, and any of them could have slipped into the night by that point, never to be seen again.

&#x200B;

Whatever had killed Catherine Leber and Mark Willis was already long gone. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The autopsies performed on Willis and Leber revealed that their corpses were partially hollowed out. Their hearts, lungs, and livers were mostly just gone along with most of their blood. The corner said that if was the strangest thing he’d ever seen… although before he got the chance to do any further investigation, the case was closed. 

&#x200B;

We came into the office the day after Mark Willis’ death that the footage we had, the photos we’d taken of the crime scene, all of it was gone. We were told that the case had been transferred to some *‘specialty’* department and that was the last we heard of it.

&#x200B;

Detective Smith resigned about a month later and I haven’t seen or heard from him since.

&#x200B;

As for me: I still work in homicide. Over the years, I’ve seen kids beaten to death by their parents, I’ve seen people butchered, ripped apart and left out in the sun to rot. But at night, when the nightmares find me it’s not those things that return to my mind.

&#x200B;

It’s the memory of Catherine Leber’s skull breaking apart, and the muffled screams of Mark Willis as the sickening petals of her skull closed around his head. I dream about the way that he writhed and thrashed on the ground in his final moments… and I dream about it happening to me. The face of some beautiful stranger, breaking open into a fleshy wet maw that ensnares me, forces its tongue down my throat, leaving me to suffocate in darkness, unable to scream, unable to fight and finally… gone. My body serving as nothing more than a conduit to feed that *thing* before it finds its next meal.

&#x200B;

I can live with most of the things I’ve seen. But this? The case we never solved, the case I still can’t explain? The knowledge that what we saw on that video was real?

&#x200B;

I still don’t know how to live with [that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
