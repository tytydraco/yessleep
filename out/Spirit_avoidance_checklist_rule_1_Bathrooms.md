Hello boys and ghouls! I have decided to create a list through which you might be able to avoid the odd ghost or ghoul. Mileage may vary but I hope that
through my mistakes, your might be able to learn a few lessons. Rule 1: Never go to the bathroom alone in a new place you might be staying at, especially
if you feel something “wrong”. Bathrooms are creepy places, aren’t they? I have many stories where people have met, or almost come face to face with spirits.

One of my teachers told me a story once. She said that she had to stay late in school one day. While using the bathroom, she heard the door to the cubicle
next to hers opening and slamming shut continuously. When she went into her cubicle, the other cubicle was empty. But the moment she had sat down, the
door started slamming. Bravely, she told it to stop and surprisingly, it did stop. She came out later to find that no one was around.

Another time, my
family had gone to India for a vacation. On the last night, my grandmother woke up to find the doorknob to the door to the bathroom turning back and forth
as though someone was trying to open the door. She thought that I or my mum might have been stuck in the bathroom and was just about to open the door for
us when she looked over and realised that we were lying next to her. Apparently, something was trying to enter the room from the bathroom. For whatever
reason, whatever it was could not do so.

My friend told me a story once relating to this. While travelling, he stayed at a hotel with rooms which provided
its occupants with large bathtubs. Being a fan of good soaks, he decided to take full advantage of it. Coming back from a project meeting which had ended
late in the evening, he decided to have a soak in the tub. As he was about to get out the tub after the soak, he felt something grip his ankle and almost
pull him back into the tub. He was able to yank his ankle free, get out the tub and rush back into his room without breaking his neck. After the water
drained, he wondered what it was that had pulled on his ankle. The tub was empty though, with nothing possibly having the strength to pull him back in.
He, however, saw a thumbprint on his ankle. Believe it when I say that he did not use any tub for a long time after that!

So learn from my mini-stories
my friends. The bathroom seems to be a playground for spirits. Why this is so is a mystery I will leave to people smarter than I am. In any event, do not
go to the bathroom; especially at night, alone in public places. If you need to, make it as quick as possible. You do not want to meet spirits. Especially
