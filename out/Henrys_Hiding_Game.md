I never have been one for believing in the supernatural. I've always heard stories about doors closing on their own, and chairs levitating. I always have chalked it up to what they are, stories. So when my friend Jeremy told me about a game, where you play a round of hide n seek with an "entity" called Henry, I told him as the good friend that I am, he was full of shit. For the next few weeks, he would keep on bringing it up. One night, though, that's when he convinced us to play it.
That was a mistake.

We were at our other friend, Tony's house. The time was 8:00 p.m. It was me, my friends Tony, Adam, and Jeremy. Jeremy brought up the game again, and I rolled my eyes. He  started explaining that he was told about this game by his cousin. Jeremy also told them everything he told me. He eventually asked if we wanted to play, and me,  hoping this would stop him talking about it, I agreed. The others agreed also, and they were generally curious. 

*Jeremy: "Alright, so to play we need to turn off every light. After, participating players must stand in a circle and chant "We invite you, Henry, to play" 10 times. After, all players must hide till you hear a bell ring. Every game is different and can last longer."*

After he told us how to play, Tony went and turned off every light in the house.We all went in the circle, and did the chant. I got a feeling after. Something was wrong, but I pushed it down. We all went to hide, and I chose to hide in the forest. It was me and Tony hiding in the forest, and we found two bushes to hide in. 

15 minutes, passed, and nothing. I was getting a bit anxious, and I saw Tony was as well. After another 5 minutes, I was about to say something to Tony when I heard someone coming. So I hid back down, and I didn't recognize the person. He was wearing a dark cloak, and it looked like his face was the void..... he was holding a bloody knife. I looked to Tony, and we were both frozen, scared shitless. 

After another 5 minutes, the person went deeper in the woods and made a run for it to the house. As we got in, I grabbed the landline and dialed 9-1-1. The phone ran, and then it didn't. It died almost instantly.  We decided to find hiding places again, and I hid under the bed in the master bedroom. I wasn't sure where Tony hid.

2 hours passed, and I heard the intruder come in. My heart was racing, If this was Jeremy or Adam playing a prank, I was going to kill them. I heard them walk around, and then it happened. I heard Tony's screams. Oh God, his screams. I ran out from my hiding place, and then it went dark.

I remember one thing before it went dark, the ringing.

I woke up on the floor, and Tony was on the floor. He was gone. Adam and Jeremy were noowhere to be seen, and I felt  my shoulder ache. The police and EMTs were there, and I was told I was stabbed in the shoulder. They said they thought Tony tried to stop the intruder and got stabbed. I asked about Adam and Jeremy, and they told me it was just me and tony when they arrived. 

It's been two weeks, and now I'm writing this. I'm telling you, no, I'm pleading with you...... don't play Henry's Hiding game.
