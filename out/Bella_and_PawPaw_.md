Disclosure: this is a 100% true story about my daughter. 

One night I was getting dinner ready for my family. I was in the kitchen cooking while my daughter played Keepy uppy  with a balloon in the dining room. She was laughing and giggling like I had never heard her before. I watched from the kitchen and just smiled as I continued cook dinner. All of a sudden I hear squeeling from my daughter, pure and UTTER joy coming from her. The only time I ever heard her this excited was if she was being chased or tickled. I look up at her but again, she’s playing by herself with a balloon. 

I thought nothing of it after this, clearly she’s just playing with a balloon. I continued to brown my meat and add my onion and as I’m grabbing my can opener for my tomato sauce I heard a loud blood curdling scream. I dropped my can opener and sliced my finger slightly on the edge of the can. I jerked my head up at her scream which to my surprise, was followed by a fully belly laughter from my daughter. Now, she isn’t doing anything wrong she’s just playing BUT this is when I started to notice she isn’t playing alone. I called out to her. “Bella, can you please lower your voice, your scream scared me and I accidentally cut my finger on the can when startled.” “Yes mama.” She replied. I stood there just watching her for a second. I watch her play all the time but this particular time was just… different. 

As I stood there, she continued on as normally as possible. I thought, hmm… maybe it’s just me being weird. I went back into the kitchen to continue cooking dinner. I walk over to my boiling water to start putting my pasta inside when I hear yet another ear ringing scream from my daughter. At this point it was a little annoyed I won’t lie because she’s not normally so rambunctious. I whipped my head around and before I could get any words out I saw my daughter. Ballon gone. Curled up on the floor completely out of breath from laughter. Face red, veins popping from her neck, utter and total tickle lock up. If you are ticklish then you know what I mean. She finally gasped for breath and shouted “Stop it Paw Paw it tickles!!” 

My face went cold, my body went as still as stone, my eyes got massive and I choked on my next words. She didn’t even see me looking at her, she had no idea anything going on around her except for whatever she was seeing infront of her. The thing is…my dad has been dead for 14 years and she has never met him. She is aware he dead. As aware as a 5 year old can be. She has been out to his gravesite with me several times but she’s 5. She doesn’t fully understand what it is or why he’s there. I have never told her details, I have never told her anything about him or what happened to him. She sees pictures and she knows he’s my dad but that’s it. 

I turned my burner off, dinner be damned right now, and I walked over to my daughter. She shot up to her feet and went to go after her balloon again but I grabbed her hand and pulled her to me. I just stared at her with tears in my eyes. I said, “who are you talking to in here?” And she smiled and pointed to my wall. It’s empty there isn’t even a photo there so I look, turn back to her and say, “I don’t see anyone, but it sounds like someone was making you laugh, yeah?” My 5 year old looked me right in my eyes and said “it’s paw paw, he was tickling me and playing keepy uppy with my balloon!” (*pause: she doesn’t call him pawpaw bc she doesn’t know him and she doesn’t have a paw paw. My husbands dad is alive but they don’t speak so my sweet baby doesn’t have a grandpa at all.  so idk who told her to say that if not…him.*) 

I pulled her into my lap and started to talk with her because clearly she is seeing something I can not. So I asked her, “what does he look like!?” And my daughter’s answer haunts me to this day and I can’t stop thinking about her reply. She said “He has a big cut on his head and he said his head hurts from being under the dirt.” My jaw hit the floor and I went from curious to horrified. I have NEVER and would never tell my young child the details of my dad’s death BUT, he was ejected from his truck in a roll over accident and bashed his head on the concrete. He stayed in a medically induced coma for a week before being declared brain dead. We burried him in my family cemetery. He DID have a big gash on his head and now he’s under the dirt. How my 5 year old would be able to tell me any of that is beyond anything I know. I have no answer for it other than my dad came to play with my baby. 

After that she started seeing him even more. One afternoon I was folding laundry and I heard her talking to someone in my bedroom. When I hollered for her to come to me, she did. I asked her who she was talking to and she said “it’s paw paw but he’s crying” and I asked “he’s crying!?” And she took my hand and brought me to my bed room and pointed at the bed. As if I was supposed to see him, but I didn’t. I said “why is he crying?” She turned right around with confidence and said “paw paw why are you sad?” A moment of silence passed and I just kind of looked around… somewhat skeptical. Then, she looked up at me and said “he said they’re happy tears bc he loves you and me.” 
Took my breath away, I love him too.
