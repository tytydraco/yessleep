My name is Damien, and I have been surviving in the town of McDougal ever since it vanished on the evening of April 28th, 2018. I live in a small isolated house in the middle of the surrounding woods, about half a mile outside of town proper with my friend Sam. I say vanished because to the rest of the world, I’m sure that’s precisely what happened. From what I’ve been told by those arriving after the fact, that’s the day that McDougal completely vanished from the map, or at least its people did. Supposedly, all of the buildings, cars, even food that was being eaten that day all remained. 

For us, it was more of the rest of the world simply vanishing. Granted, we could only go as far as our cars could take us, but every town we came across, every city, every state was abandoned. Even massive metropolises known for housing millions of people were void of human life. To us, it wasn’t McDougal that had disappeared, it was the rest of the population, leaving only our small town of 2,000 people as the last bastion of humanity in an empty world. 

Before anyone asks, no, I’m not here to tell you what happened. I’m not going to tell you what we discovered on our expeditions outside of town, I’m not here to tell you why this happened to our isolated community (not that I even could), and I’m not here to offer an explanation as to why you had the misfortune to wind up here. Honestly, I try not to think about that stuff. Maybe if there’s enough interest, Sam can talk to you about that in a follow up post, or in the comments. My purpose today with this post is simpler, more fundamental. 

Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of new faces in town, the few times I’ve actually bothered to head down there. There was a time that wasn’t always the case, and it was only ever those that were initially pulled in after the entire town I call home seemed to become isolated. But over the past few months, we’ve been getting a slew of amateur podcasters, self labeled urban explorers, so called “paranormal investigators”, even the odd military man suddenly arriving overnight in town. They always say the same thing, that they fell asleep within the walls that used to house the residents of McDougal, and then they wake up here, with us. Most of them don’t last a week, some don’t even last their first day. 

So at Sam’s behest, I’m offering this post as a basic guideline. I’ll run you through what the average night looks like for him and I so you can model that routine and not wind up as another victim. Personally I don’t care if you heed my warnings or not, but Sam is adamant that we have some sort of duty to keep newcomers safe. So if for no other reason, just pay attention for Sam’s sake. The following took place last night, and is a good, all encompassing example of what you can expect now that you’re stuck here with us. 

At four hours until midnight, darkness begins to loom over the trees surrounding our small home in the woods. Before night fully falls, Sam and I work together to inspect the house’s entrances. Front door, side porch, windows, everything. We ensure that the wooden boards we use to block them off are secured, that it’s impossible for anyone or anything to get in. Some days we discover that the boards are shattered, or forcefully pulled away from the house, and we replace them. Once we’re just about done, I leave him to finish up and perform one last check on our surroundings, make sure I don’t see anything moving in the veil of brown and green surrounding us. 

During the daylight hours, the woods serve a number of purposes, such as isolation from people I don’t wish to deal with, natural cover from any new threats, and as a source of small game in the form of squirrels and rabbits, even the odd deer if I’m lucky. At night, however, they serve as a place for panicking people to get lost, and as cover for the Repeaters. 

If you don’t know what those are, look at the name and think for a second. You know those people around town who have the same conversations with clearly different peopke, knock on doors to abandoned buildings and go inside, or those who walk the exact same way for the exact same amount of time? Notice how they do those things day after day, with no alteration? Yeah, those are Repeaters, and they’re more dangerous than you think. We don’t get many out this way, but there are more than a few who are trapped in the cycle of hopelessly wandering the woods. So, we keep an eye out.

At three hours to midnight, we get inside the house and lock the front door, light some lanterns and candles for light, and make sure anything that we could step on or stumble over is out of the way. Next we check to make sure there’s nothing causing any noticeably audible noise that can be heard from outside. Sometimes that means one of us going back out and listening while the other checks an appliance, especially if it’s something new. We have to be thorough, after all. If our dishwasher or laundry is running, we stop it. 

One thing you need to learn quick is that anything is better than breaking a Repeater’s pattern. Soggy clothes, missing shoes, a bruised elbow, anything. I don’t care how much you hate leaving something unfinished or how much you need the air conditioning going to be able to sleep. If using an object or completing a task would interrupt a Repeater, LEAVE IT. It’s not worth your life. 

At two hours to midnight, we do a weapons check. Dissemble our guns, make sure they’re clean and in working order. We check how much ammo we have, make sure we have the right ammo. For us, that’s 30.06 for our Winchester 70, and .45 ACP for our 1911. Technically you don’t need bullets with that much stopping power, anything that can drop a human target reliably will suit you just fine. But be warned, the Repeaters can take a lot of damage, way more than you would think or expect. So stopping power helps a lot, buys you time. 

We also keep at least one close quarters weapon on us, usually something that stabs or bashes. For me, that equates to a ten inch hunting knife my father gave me for my eighteenth birthday. If you’re like Sam, that means a baseball bat, something powerful enough to stop something coming at you, but not lethal enough to kill it in one hit. Usually. You don’t need those exact items, anything that works against closing in threats is perfectly adequate. Ideally, you don’t want anything getting that close to you, that’s what the guns are for. But it’s better to have and not need than to need and not have, as the saying goes. 

At one hour to midnight, we figure out who’s staying up on watch. We get our plan together, make sure we’re both on the same page. Last night’s conversation went something like this;

“I can keep watch tonight. You’ve been staying up the past three nights now, it’s not good for you, man.” Sam said as he sat opposite to me at the small circular kitchen table. He fidgeted with this fingers, a kind expression written across his face as he leaned forward. 

“I’m fine. I don’t mind sleeping during the day.” I rebutted, ignoring his silent pressuring. 

“We could always switch to shifts, like I recommended.” I knew his offer was sincere, but I didn’t like the idea of trying to set that up in just one hour. 

“No. Too risky.” Sam sighed and rubbed his forehead, clearly exasperated with me. 

“It’s not like we’d be screaming at each other, Damien. Just shaking the other awake, making sure they’re good and-“

“I said no.” 

“Damien.” Sam’s voice sounded noticeably worried, despite his efforts to hide it. 

“Sam, I’m fine. What we’re doing works, and we don’t have time to change it. We can talk about in the morning if it bothers you.” 

“Which it does.” He said somewhat sternly. 

“Then think of a good argument for it, maybe you’ll change my mind. Good night Sam.” I think he realized that I wasn’t budging on this one, not tonight. Without a word he pulled the 1911 from behind his pants and set it on the table in front of me. 

“At least hold onto this,then.” I stared at the wooden handle of the pistol for a moment, the recently cleaned iron shimmering in the candlelight.

“What if you need it? I already have the rifle.” I argued, pulling it up from under the table and setting it in front of me. Sam shook his head. 

“If we’re not doing shifts, there’s no point in me having it. The people out there are getting worse and I’m worried…” I noticed his voice catch in his throat, and he seemed to fight something back. He always worried too much, poor Sam. A pang of sadness ran through me as he cleared his throat before continuing. 

“I’m worried there’s gonna be more than you can take with a bolt action. You need to be able to handle them fast if worse comes to worse. So please, take it. I’ll hear you if you fire anyway.” I wanted to argue more, point out that if rifle fire did wake him up, he would easily be able to rush to my defense and use the gun if he still had it on him. Besides, for all his talk of wanting me safe, I wanted him safe too. There was, after all, a window in the bedroom. Boarded up, secured, maybe, but there was a good chance it wouldn’t stay that way. 

Still, this was clearly important to him, and more pressingly, we were short on time. So I relented, sighing as I took the strap on the rifle and slung it over my shoulder. 

“Safety’s on.” Sam reminded me as I took hold of the pistol and slipped it neatly into the back of my trousers. I nodded at him, and saw a faint smile of relief cross his face as he sat back, the candlelight only just barely revealing his short blonde hair and green eyes. There was a silent thank you in his expression, one that I’m sure was supposed to make me feel better. 

All it did was make me seriously consider shifts after all. 

Midnight. Sam was asleep, or at least he better have been. I’d given him my room for the night, as I sat on the couch that normally served as his sleeping spot. The room was bathed in the soft candlelight from the center of the old coffee table. In the light I could see the outlines of our old television, some old photos depicting either Sam’s family or mine, the old recliner I’d sit in when we we’d watch TV in the odd case we had a lazy day, and of course, the front door, locked and secure. 

Anything beyond that was only vague shapes. The candlelight was just bright enough to reveal their presence, but did not extend deep enough into the darkness to expose their details. A large circular disc denoted the kitchen table, and a few rectangular blocks were the only indication I had of our refrigerator, cupboards, dishwasher, and sink. That is to say nothing of the small gap behind me, leading to a small hallway that, though I knew led to the bathroom, laundry room, and bedroom, appeared to be nothing more than a deep wall of blackness. The thick dark caused my chest to feel heavier as I observed it, and I felt my grip on the rifle tighten. 

I did my best to keep my mind from wandering or succumbing to fear, instead keeping close attention to any noise I heard around the house, and outside. Every so often I would look at the watch given to me by mother before I left home, noting the time so I’d be ready for each event. 

12:52 AM was when things truly started. While we had mostly boarded up the window overlooking our front yard, there were still small slits between the boards of wood that we could use to peek out if necessary. Unfortunately, this also meant things from outside could look in once they got close enough.

We kept our windows ever so slightly open at night. If you don’t have any major activity by your home, you obviously don’t need to do this, as it is a risky, oftentimes unnecessary gamble in the event you, or something in your shelter makes noise. For Sam and I, however, it was the only way we could hear the approaching footsteps and of our first visitor. 

Upon hearing the telltale signs of crackling twigs and old leaves, I moved away from the couch, stepping slowly to the side of the window as I clutched my rifle close to my chest. 

One thud, two thuds, three thuds. My heart began racing, and I forced myself to hold my breath. For a moment there was nothing, as whatever made the sounds outside my home silently peered inside. A deep groan filled the air as I took another cautious step away from the window. Out of the blackness, in flickering light, I saw burly looking fingers curl around one of the planks of wood, as the first Repeater lifted a long dead flashlight to my window. 

“Hello? Is anyone in there, I need a little help.” The man’s voice wasn’t threatening in the slightest, if anything it was slightly pitiable. There was a shakiness to it, a tiredness, like he was trying to catch his breath. I said nothing, no one had been here the night he arrived looking for help, and so no one could be tonight either. 

Knock. Knock. Knock as the man gave three soft pounds against the wood. The man peered closer to the window. I could just see his shape leering close to the window, using the free hand to hold over his eyes, lifting the dead flashlight higher through one of the cracks. No doubt he saw the candle, which of course hadn’t been there the first night either. Thankfully, that deviation was so small it meant next to nothing. 

“Hello?” Asked the man again. I kept still, my finger twitching as I fought to keep it off the trigger. One minute, two minutes, three minutes passed as the lifeless flashlight passed over and over across the window. 

“Please, I’m lost, I just need some help.” The man’s voice was soft, pleading. I did not respond, I could not respond. It may seem heartless, but he was too far gone. After a minute more, the Repeater gave up with a defeated sigh, and loudly began to stomp away from the window. I didn’t immediately return to my spot on the couch, instead waiting a few more minutes until I could no longer hear his stomping, or his defeated gasps of breath as he left. After I was satisfied, I let out the breath I was holding and sat back down, trying to force my chest to stop pounding through deep, calculated breaths. 

The next few hours were calm, save for the odd scratching and whispers asking if anyone was inside from the few people who’d found us from time to time. These Repeaters, thankfully, had not peered through the window as the first had. So, I needed only to keep my rifle at the ready, just in case something set them off. Another valuable lesson, if a Repeater has no reason to see you, don’t give it one. Stay out of its sight, don’t make a sound, don’t interrupt its routine. They’ll leave you alone. Usually. 

3:52 AM, the night was almost over, and I had only one visitor left. This last Repeater was technically our first, one we had encountered in the first few days our town became isolated. A lot of people broke down in those initial days, and most of us were too frightened and, frankly, too busy panicking  to focus on the Repeater problem. That led to a lot more of them, including the one I now had to face, the one I had to turn away. 

Taking a deep breath, I sat up from the couch and made my way to the door, checking the bolt of my rifle one last time. I was only slightly relieved to see the brass casing reflecting a soft bit of candlelight back at me. With any luck, no ammo would be spent tonight. 

If you must deal with a Repeater, try to learn exactly what their routine is, and mimic it to the best of your ability. Think of it as an acting exercise, try not to mess up, and be ready. 

Carefully stepping by the front door, I checked by the nightstand beside for the flashlight I kept there. Sure enough, there was a bright red, chunky plastic flashlight I used specially for events like tonight. Steeling myself, I slung the rifle behind my shoulder, just out of sight, and took the small twisting metal on the door knob in my hand. After a soft twist, I heard the barely discernible clicking of metal as the door unlocked. 

“Stay calm. You know what to say, what to do.” I said aloud to myself. Swinging the door open, I gently stepped outside into the cool night air, chirping crickets and cicadas quickly filling my ears as I took in the near pitch blackness of the treeline underneath the starless, cloudy night sky. I counted the seconds as I gripped the strap on my rifle tightly. 

One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six seconds. The first signs, deep breathing, panting, the cracking of leaves and snapping branches. 

“Hello! Anyone!” Came a distraught voice from the woods. Even all these years later, the pain in his voice was unmistakable. 

“Can anybody hear me?! Please, it’s my daughter!” He begged, I could see the tears on his face even before he came visible. My turn. 

“Hello? Who’s out there?” I asked, pitching my voice ever so slightly higher. The truth is, it was Sam who had been out here all those nights ago. Unable to sleep, trying desperately to reach his mom on his phone. In the distance, I saw a man stumble out of the woods and fall onto his hands and knees, huffing as he laid on the rocky road leading to the house. He was still too far away to see any features, but I could hear him panting, his breaths raspy as he desperately sucked in air. 

“Sir? Sir are you okay?” I asked with false concern. The frame of the man turned, still huffing as he stumbled up. The shuffling of rocks signified him getting closer, and I fought the urge to ready my rifle as my focus deepened, ready for anything. 

“Please, please you have to help me, it’s my daughter! One of those things got her!” He exclaimed as he stepped closer. I had no idea what the man looked like as he stopped a few feet from the steps leading up to our porch. There was only enough light from the clouded sky to reveal his shape, huffing, puffing, wheezing. 

“Those things? You mean the Repeaters?” I asked in Sam’s voice. The figure nodded frantically. 

“Yes, she got in their way and they took her into the woods! I need help, please I need to find her!” He begged. I pretended to acquiesce.

“I-I’ll go get some help, just stay there!” Without another word, I walked back to the door while keeping an eye on the figure, calmly opened it, and stepped inside. Technically, this was a deviation. Sam had been somewhat frantic that night, nearly throwing open the door as he rushed inside. His clattering had been what woke me up that night, sounds I most certainly hadn’t been making. These types of deviation are fine, so long as they don’t interrupt the Repeater, or drastically alter the events they’re trapped in. So, I grabbed the flashlight by the door, then proceeded to wait several minutes. 

I kept a close eye on the Repeater through a small peep hole as time crawled ever so slowly. Even though I was playing my part, there was no guarantee that everything around me would play out exactly the same. We were in the middle of the woods, surrounded on all sides by wild life, wild life that by its very nature was unpredictable. It’s best to keep an eye out when you have such a massive variable, one you can never fully account for. The Repeater, for his part, never deviated, following the same pattern I’d seen for years now. Exhausted huffing, placing his hands on his head and pacing as he waited outside, holding his arm periodically. 

4:01 AM, I could feel my stomach drop. Forcing myself to take a deep breath, I slung the rifle so I held it in one hand, tucked the flashlight under my arm with the other, then opened the door. I quickly shifted the flaslight to my open hand and flicked it on as I stepped outside, focusing on the Repeater. 

The Repeater, just like always, winced at the sudden light and turned to face me, holding out a dirt covered, scarred hand as he backed away slightly. His thin autumn coat was torn, ripped in several places and revealing hints of a long sleeved t-shirt. His grass stained jeans fared no better, small holes revealing scabbed skin in some places, and fresh cuts in others. Even all this time later, I pitied the man. When I’d first encountered him, his clothing had looked almost brand new, but years of reliving the worst day of his life had left them just as broken as he was. 

“Just focus… You’re almost done.” I told myself. 

“You, what did you say to my friend? Why are you even here?” I asked harshly, using my own voice this time. Like everyone else, I’d been confused and scared at the time, and on that particular night, had just experienced a sudden and unwanted awakening. If I could take back what I said, what I did, believe me, I would. Instead, I watched for the thousandth time as the man blinked rapidly, squinting as he fought against the light. His voice shook when he tried to respond. 

“I-I was just asking for help, I swear! My daughter, she was taken, I’m trying to-“ 

“At this time of night? What’s wrong with you?! You’re gonna get yourself and probably us killed!” I yelled, interrupting the man. I hated the venom in my voice, I hated the startled yelp the man let out as he raised his hands in a non-threatening gesture, pieces of fabric dangling from his arms. Most of all I hated what I’d missed all those nights ago, the sight of the man crying, barely holding it together. 

“Please, I just want-“ He tried to say, his voice trembling. Again I interrupted him. 

“I don’t care what you want, you need to leave, now.” The Repeater’s expression dropped, shaking his head in sheer disbelief and despair as he opened his mouth to speak again. 

CRASH. My heart leapt up into my throat. 

“No, no no no no…” I thought. In an instant I turned to my left, shining the beam of light towards the small gravel driveway that housed my car and our trashcans. In the light I could see both trash cans, both of which should have been standing. Instead, I could see one of them tipped over, trash spilling on the ground as a raccoon obliviously picked away at the escaping pile. My grip around the rifle tightened, and I could feel my flashlight hand begin to shiver. 

“Crap…” I thought. A deviation, and a big one. Turning back to the Repeater, I could see his expression and demeanor change in an instant. His fear, his despair, his pitiable stance were all gone. In their place I saw a hardened, almost animalistic rage in his eyes, fists clenching so tightly that I could see fresh blood dripping from where his long dirtied nails dug into his skin. His attention was divided between myself and the offending raccoon, his huffing breath turning into a heaving growl as the white in his eyes turned red. 

“Crap…” I said aloud. My mind went a mile a minute as I tried forcing myself to calm down, taking deep breaths and steadying my hands. 

“I said you need to leave, NOW.” I said in a shaking voice, trying desperately to get the Repeater to recognize his routine. The Repeater only growled louder, veins beginning to become visible in his hands and in his face. 

Without thinking I dropped the flashlight and heard it clattering to the ground as I raised my rifle, aiming at the Repeater as it became half bathed in light, half shrouded by darkness. 

“Don’t make me shoot you!” I shouted, my voice trembling as I trained my scope on the Repeater’s chest. I regretted the words as soon as I said them. This was another massive deviation. As poorly as I handled the situation years ago, I’d never threatened to shoot the man. Any chance I had now of keeping this from escalating was gone. The Repeater grit his teeth as he hissed in reply, his eyes becoming almost completely red as blood freely poured from his hands. 

Suddenly, the man roared, pouncing from a dead stop as he lept forward, screaming as he charged me at full sprint. 

“CRAP!” I yelled in a panic. 

CRACK, followed immediately by an ear shattering BANG. The shot had been both a reflex, and intentional all at once as it echoed across the formerly silent woods. Quick, easy, without thought. That’s the only way to deal with one attacking you, no mercy, no thought as to who they are or were, just rapid and decisive force. 

The shot hit the charging Repeater in the chest, the force of the round twisting his body as he stumbled and slammed into the ground. I quickly cycled the bolt, the sound of the empty brass casing hitting the wooden porch almost completely drowned out as the Repeater screamed in fury, fumbling with its hands to push itself back up. The monster rose his gaze to meet mine, its eyes practically dripping with fury as it roared, spit and blood flying from its lips as it tried to push towards me. 

A second CRACK and BANG left my ears ringing, and my head felt like it was almost splitting open from a sudden headache, a painful reminder that I’d forgotten to wear any form of ear protection. In the moment I hardly cared about that, however. My attention was focused on the man I’d just killed. His head was a mere fraction of what it was, now shattered and split partly open. Shards of his bloody skull were visible in the beam of the flashlight, and I found myself feeling sick to my stomach. 

Even knowing what he was, I felt a twinge of guilt welling up in my stomach as a wave of exhaustion swept over me. This was twice now I had killed him, I realized. Thoughts of him somehow getting better and returning to himself flooded my mind for an instant before falling away, replaced by the sight of his lifeless body. 

“I… I’m sorry…” Was all I could say as I lowered the rifle, my hearing slowly retuning to me as I took a step back. 

“Damien?! Damien what happened, are you alright?!” I heard the panicked voice of my friend shout. 

“I’m fine, Sam. I’m fine.” I lied as I cycled the bolt a second time, letting the expended round fall to the ground outside before stepping back inside, my eyes never leaving the body in front of me. Even as I closed the door, I could hear the distant sound of two more screams somewhere in the woods, more Repeaters, more people who’d gotten lost in the woods. More people who’d lost hope.

Sam and I didn’t sleep the rest of that night. Occasionally, we’d hear a rabid Repeater slamming against our windows or our door as they screamed, held our breath as they tried bashing their way in. Morning came before they could make progress, and, for whatever reason, they fell back into their routines. 

I’ll let that be the last lesson, before signing off and leaving you with this post. If you have the ability to, hunker down and hide from the Repeaters if you suspect they’ll come after you. You won’t be able to outrun them. If there’s enough of them, and believe me, make enough noise and there will be, you won’t be able to out fight them. Just hide. Hide, and pray they don’t find you. Try to fix whatever damage they do when it’s safe, then get ready to deal with them again. 

 If you have any other questions, leave them here, I guess. I’m sure Sam or myself with get to them at some point. 

Above all, stay safe, try not to give up. We don’t need more of them around here. 

EDIT - Sam just informed me that he’ll be posting his follow up in minute. I’ll link to it here once he’s actually got it up.
