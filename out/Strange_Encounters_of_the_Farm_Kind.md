It's always something. Last week the goats were acting weird, this week the chickens. 

I went out to the chicken coop first thing in the morning like usual and let them out. Chickens are great pest control, they’ll kill a lot of things for you, keep the ticks out of your yard. 

I collected their eggs while they grazed. I’d seen some pretty weird looking eggs before so not much surprised me. But today, in the last nesting box, there was one like nothing I’d seen before. 

It was large, about the size of my hand, and a deep blue, almost black in the dim lighting of the coop. 

I took it inside and put it in the incubator for no other reason than curiosity. I didn’t know which one of my hens this came from and wanted to see what it would look like. 

For the next couple weeks I tended to the egg, occasionally rotating it and watching. Waiting. During this time I heard the news that my neighbor a few miles down the road had been found dead. His eyes had been plucked out and apparently the cause of death were a bunch of tiny stab wounds. Beak sized wounds. 

One evening as I put them up I noticed their feathers were a bit discolored and after looking closer, it seemed like blood. The ten hens and one rooster stared back at me with their little eyes as if they dared me to say something about it. I didn’t. I just smiled and said good night.

The next morning the cops were at my door asking me questions about another neighbor that had died yesterday in a similar manner as that first dead neighbor. We’d exchanged a greeting here and there but, no, I didn’t know him or know anything about this incident. 

Out in the coop that same morning was another strange egg. That same deep blue monstrous egg. Without thinking I brought it in as well and placed it next to the other egg.

A week after that, the first egg began to hatch.

It happened fast. By the time I noticed, the chick was already halfway out. It climbed out of the shell in no time. And just as its egg was strange, so was this chick. It did not come out with fuzz, but full feathers already, that same deep blue color, with black feet that had sharp talons jutting out. The black beak was long and tapered into a razor sharp point. 

I was frightened but more than that in awe. It circled the incubator, hunching down because it was almost too tall. Then its blood red eyes locked on to the other egg. It pounced on it, tearing into it and ripping away its sibling’s protection. It stabbed its beak into the half formed chick, bursting open the yolk sac and then the chick, spraying white and red across the incubator walls. It flung the limp chick around, ripping it apart with its feet and then diving in head first to eat what was inside. 

When it was done, it slowly turned its head to meet my eyes. And then it charged, ramming into the glass side. The incubator shook and slid towards the edge of the table. The glass cracked. I quickly picked up the machine and put it in the bathroom. As I shut the door behind me I could hear the glass break completely followed by a crash. 

My chickens have all come up to the back porch, perched up on the railing, trying to see inside. Surely my bathroom door will hold, but I’m not sure anymore. What can I do?
