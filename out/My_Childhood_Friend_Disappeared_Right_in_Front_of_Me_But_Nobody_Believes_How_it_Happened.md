Hello all.  I wish the internet were around back when I was younger; maybe then I wouldn't be living in this constant state of paranoia.  But here we are now, so I might as well leave it all on the table.  Sorry if this isn't some well written essay or something, it's just mostly the rambling of an older man trying to make sense of things.

I was a happy kid growing up.  Times weren't like how they are now; all us kids, ranging from toddlers to teenagers, played unsupervised all over the neighborhood.  Street hockey, make believe knights, wilderness exploration, you name it.  It was simpler back then.  And many people would tell you it was safer.  But they're wrong.  The story I will share with you today is only the first of a myriad of happenings that have haunted me ever since:

The rain was sporadically pouring down upon us, but that didn't stop anyone from playing.  Any time it picked up, we'd just find some cover and as soon as it let up, it was back to action.  Everyone went about their normal activities as if the sun were beating down on us and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.  But me and my best friend Tim had other ideas.  It didn't rain often where we lived, so the two of us reveled in any opportunity we could get to play in it.  We went around like idiots filling up garbage hood lids with water and then taking turns dumping it on one another.  Eventually we grew tired of our monotonous play and decided to take a break and have some ice pops.  I loved cherry and he loved blueberry.  Ironically enough, both of our parents loved the opposite flavor we enjoyed, thus we had a deal; I'd trade him my blueberry and he'd give me a cherry in return.  We were barterers in the making.  I'm sorry, that really had nothing to do with the main reason I'm writing thisf here, but I feel like cherishing those memories are the only thing that's keeping me sane nowadays...  But I digress...  After we had completed our cold cuisines, Tim had the idea to make an obstacle course on the street in the cul-de-sac area of our neighborhood.  You see, this particular plot of street was filled to the brim with potholes galore.  Tim explained that we'd hop from puddle to puddle, as if any ground other than the potholes was lava (yes I know, lava and rain don't make sense together).  I for one thought it was brilliant and without a second thought, we got up and made our way to the makeshift obstacle course.

It was better than we had hoped.  Each hole was overflowing with water.  Our shoes would surely drown and our mothers would surely hit us for having destroyed them, but it was totally worth it.  We started off on the sidewalk with the "children at play" sign.  The goal was to make it all the way to the other side of the street where the fire hydrant was, without ever stepping foot on the actual road itself.   And just like that, like kids always do; we didn't think, we just did.  Tim started hopping from pothole to pothole, causing watery volcanic eruptions with every stomp.  I followed two potholes behind, as to not get any water in my eyes that would impede my vision forward.  It was exhilarating.  Tim and I were whooping and howling the whole way through.  Our thundering screams probably annoyed all the people inside their houses, but we didn't care.  We were both wailing our heads off... until I was the only one screaming.  I watched it all happen, probably less than ten feet in front of me.  Tim was in the second to last puddle and made his grand leap into the final pothole... but he never hit the ground.  As soon as he made contact with the surface of the water, he just kept going until his whole body had been submerged.  

For the first time I can remember, I was absolutely speechless.  I stepped out of my pothole and made my way towards the one he had just disappeared into.  Carefully placing one foot in, the only thing I found was the street just a few inches down.  I was so confused.  I probably stood there dumbfounded for about a minute before something caught my eye.  Directly in front of me was a house that none of us knew about.  We always assumed it was some old people cause they never came out and we've never seen any kids there.  But at that moment, on that day for whatever particular reason, someone in that house showed themselves.  He was a scraggly man.  Long and lean, almost sickeningly.  I barely got to see what he looked like before he had fully shut his shades.  But I could still see his shadow standing there, unmoving, simply watching me.  Slowly I could see his hand move up to his head, with one finger raised.  It was the same motion my mother made while she was on the phone to shush me up.

I was never a scared kid.  Monsters didn't exist, there was no crime to plague us and the dark meant nothing to me.  But in that moment I was scared.  I had never felt like that before and I hated the feeling.  I instinctively ran home.  Ran as fast as my little legs could.  Probably ran the fastest I've ever run in my life, that day.

It wasn't long until both my parents and Tim's came back to the spot to investigate.  I had told them what had happened, too the tune of much disbelief.  But they could see that I was scared, so they knew *something* had indeed taken place.  But it couldn't possibly be the ramblings of some six year old kid, now could it?  

Without any sign of Tim, the police were soon called and a search party scoured the neighborhood and nearby woods.  It felt like the entire neighborhood showed up to help.  It would've been a heartwarming feeling if the story had a happy ending, but of course, I wouldn't be here if it did.  Cadaver dogs were brought in, but all they did was follow his scent to the pothole I saw him vanish in and begin whimpering.  With the lack of luck locating Tim, police began questioning the residents in the cul-de-sac.  But of course, no one saw anything.  Night had fallen and the rain had ceased.  Many people went home, deciding to go in for the night, despite a little boy being lost.  As I was seemingly the only witness, the police grilled me over and over again to tell them the truth.  And I did.  With frustrations increasing, the cops all but left me be, as my story was not changing.  Seemingly as a last resort (though I feel like this is the first thing they should've done), the sheriff spoke to me.  I always liked the sheriff, hell, everyone liked him.  He was not some chubby donut eating cop who had nothing better to do in an area where the only crimes were local idiots getting drunk and falling asleep on people's lawn.  No, we was a *police officer,* through and through.  He was big and strong and his burly mustache was the icing on the cake that was his stature.  But more than that, he was kind.  After I recounted my story yet again, instead of discrediting me and yelling at me to stop making up stories, he simply put his hand on my shoulder and said "okay."  I'm not sure to this day whether he believed me or was just trying to comfort me, but that single word meant a lot.  

"Do you know if anyone else was around when this happened."  

Again, a question I had been asked before, but this time I finally felt safe to inform him of the man at the window.  I wish I never did.  "One second," he said and walked off to converse with his subordinates and local residents.  After a few minutes he returned to me and crouched down.  With a sigh he simply said "son, no one lives in that house."  

That's when I cried.  I cried and cried until I was literally chocking.  I know what I saw.  The sheriff could see how distraught I was and went to check the house out.  He was so kind.  The door was locked when her tried opening it, so he called a few of his people to help him ram it open.  And inside they went.  Everything was so quiet.  The twenty or so of us who waited outside stared down that house in sheer silence, as it we were expecting a blazing gun fight to go off at any moment.  But this wasn't a movie.  The sheriff and his men walked back out and just shook their heads.  And I cried again.

It's been decades now.  Tim was never found.  People moved on.  His *own family* moved on.  But not me.  I wasn't allowed to move on.  *He* wouldn't let me...
