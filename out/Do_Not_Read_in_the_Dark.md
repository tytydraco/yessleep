Since I was a little girl, my dad had always told me not to read in the dark. “It will hurt your eyes,” he said.

Then, he would point to his thick glasses. “See? You would have to wear these all the time, just like daddy.” 

“I think they look cool,” I said.

He would smile at me and just pat my head softly. “Just don’t do it.”


I had always been daddy’s good girl, but at this point I was 13, and the hormones didn’t seem to want me to stay that way.

Dad was gone for the night. He said it was a business trip. Mom stayed at home with me as always. But she never seemed to care much about me doing whatever as long as it didn’t hurt anyone.


So, at 22:38, lights were completely off, I was lying on my bed, reading horror stories on the internet. I had always liked horror, but the dark really does add something to the stories, something I’ve never experienced before, and I was loving it. The way just the sound of my mother coming upstairs makes my skin crawl—it feels way too good.

Except my mom should already be in bed by now.

The sound of the steps got louder and louder, meaning my mom, or whoever it is, was coming close, too close. I put the blanket over my head. My phone was in my hand and the screen was still on; the light from it gave me some comfort, although it was just then I realized it would be more comforting if I had just rushed to open the lights. I tried thinking maybe my mom was just watching her TV a bit later than usual tonight, but my mind just kept going back to ‘No, she wasn’t.’

Then, the door opened slowly. It was also lights off outside; no light was piercing into my room. I only knew the door had been opened because of the squeaky sound the movement made.

“Bad girl” To my surprise, it was a man’s voice—a very familiar one. 

I flipped the blanket over and flopped out of it with joyous excitement.

“Daddy!”

He looked straight at me, but his eyes were different than always. I can see them in the dark. It was like I could see the silhouette that makes up the shape of my father’s figure, but instead of that, I could see nothing. Inside the lines that made up the shape was all blacked out like the surroundings, with the exception of his eyes. I could see the whites of his eyes glowing in the dark; they were wide open, much bigger than the eyes I used to see, staring at me like he was a germophobe and I was a cockroach on his bed.

“Daddy?” He stood there, saying nothing.

“Are you mad at me? I’m sorry.” Though I didn’t understand why he would get so mad at me just for reading in the dark, I figured it would be best to just apologize and avoid doing it (or getting caught doing it) ever again. 

Then, there were more whites.

Not just his eyes. Now I was seeing his teeth too.

He was smiling with his mouth open, showing all of his shiny teeth. And when I said all, I meant it. His smile was so big that all of his teeth were showing. Again, I’ve never seen his mouth like this. Now he was making an expression I’ve never seen from him and never thought I would.

“You’re scaring me. I won’t do it again, I promise. Just stop doing that, please.”

His head tilted to the right. Not slightly, but one fast flash of movement, directly to 90 degrees.

I was shaking at this point, I wasn’t sure if that was my dad anymore.

To make things worse, he started walking towards my bed. I could see the white parts of his eyes and teeth getting bigger as he came close step by step.

“Bad, bad girl.” After this sentence, he grabbed me by my hair and pulled me close to his face—so close that the whites took over half of my vision.

“You’re hurting me!” I screamed.

I wanted him to stop, of course he didn’t. Instead, he started plucking out my hair. Not one strand but many of them, and not one by one but about a handful for each pull. I could smell blood, although there wasn’t enough to blind my eyes from the smiley face in front of me.

I screamed and screamed and cried for mom. Hoping she would come to save me.

Unfortunately, she came in.

I looked up. It was hard to see with dad’s face so close, but I could see her there, standing at the door that was left open.

She had the same face as dad.

Widen eyes. Widen smile. Shiny whites.

“Bad, bad girl.” Same sentence, but now it’s another voice—mom’s voice.

She walked up to me and grabbed my right hand. I tried to pull my hand back, but she had the strength of a monster. It was like my hand was superglued to hers. 

Then she started breaking my fingers, one by one. 

“Bad hand.” 

I was screaming so loud that I started to lose my voice. Before long there were only gasps coming out. 

They kept doing what they were doing, it didn’t take long to finish since I only have 10 fingers and one head. But it wasn’t the end. Dad ran his sharp nails along my face, they pierced into my skin, drawing out blood. At the same time, mom started pulling out my nails.

I ended up with no more hair on my scalp, blood running down my face to my bed, all broken fingers and none of them have nails.

I couldn’t see any of the damage, it was too dark. But I could feel it, I could feel everything they did to me.

I knew I wouldn’t like what I was going to see. However, I reached for the light.

And I can feel two fingers stabbing my two eyes. It was dark before, but now it was completely, absolutely dark. I couldn’t even see their eyes and their smiles anymore.

And now it is forever dark.
