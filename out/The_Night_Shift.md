*Day 1*  

I work at a small gas station on a lonely highway in the middle of nowhere. Most nights are uneventful. People stop, fill up, maybe grab a snack, and drive off. The pay’s not great, but it’s quiet, and I like quiet.

That is, until last night.

Around 2 a.m., I was sitting behind the counter, half-asleep, when I heard a car pull up. Nothing unusual about that, except this car didn’t sound like the usual rust-buckets that come through here. The engine was silent—like *too* silent. I didn’t even realize anyone had parked until I saw a figure standing by Pump 4, just staring at me through the glass doors.

He was tall, wearing a long coat, and had his hood pulled up. His face was hidden in shadow, but I could feel him staring right at me. Something about him just felt… wrong. I gave him a nod, trying to be friendly, but he didn’t move. Just stood there. I figured he might’ve been waiting for me to activate the pump, so I pressed the button.

Nothing happened.

I tried again. Still nothing. The guy didn’t seem to care. He just kept staring. After a few minutes, he finally turned around and started walking. Not to his car. Not to the building. Just… into the woods. He disappeared into the trees, and the car he came in? Gone too. I swear I didn’t hear it leave.

I called my boss and told him what happened. He laughed it off, saying I must’ve been dozing off and dreamed the whole thing. Maybe he’s right. Maybe I *was* just tired.

But I’ve never felt that scared in my life.

*Day 2*  

Okay, something else weird happened tonight.  

Around 1:30 a.m., I was doing my usual rounds, stocking the shelves and cleaning up. I walked outside for a smoke, and that’s when I noticed something—footprints, leading from Pump 4 into the woods. The same spot that guy disappeared into last night.

They were fresh, but here’s the thing… it hadn’t rained, and the ground wasn’t wet. These footprints were muddy, and they seemed to glow faintly under the fluorescent lights. I followed them for a few steps until they just *stopped*—like whoever made them had vanished into thin air.

I was freaked out but didn’t know what to do, so I finished my shift without telling anyone. When I came back inside, the register was open. I know for a fact I didn’t leave it that way.

I checked the security footage, but guess what? It’s corrupted. A few minutes of static, right around the time I was outside. 

I’m starting to think I wasn’t imagining things.

*Day 3*  

I can’t stop thinking about that guy. I swear, I’ve been hearing footsteps outside the station all night. Every time I go to check, no one’s there.  

The weirdest part? Pump 4 keeps turning on by itself. No cars, no customers, nothing. Just the pump, making that clicking sound like someone’s trying to use it.  

Tonight, I was brave enough to go outside and look again. This time, I brought a flashlight. I shined it into the woods, and for a second, I thought I saw someone standing between the trees—just watching. When I pointed the light directly at them, they vanished, like a shadow dissolving into the night.  

I’m starting to get freaked out. I called my boss again, but he says there’s nothing to worry about. "People get jumpy on the night shift all the time," he said. "You’re just tired."  

I don’t think that’s it. Something’s out there.

*Day 5*  

I’m done pretending this is just in my head.  

Last night, I got a call on the station phone, right after midnight. I picked up, and at first, it was just static. But then I heard breathing—slow, heavy breathing. I tried to say something, but the line cut off.  

A few minutes later, Pump 4 turned on again. I watched it through the window, and I swear I saw someone out there. I didn’t get a good look, but it was tall, and its limbs were… wrong. Too long, too thin, like a shadow stretched over bone.  

I’m not staying here tonight. I’m taking a day off, but I’ll check the cameras when I come back tomorrow.

*Day 6*  

I checked the footage from last night, and I think I made a huge mistake.

There’s something on the tape. It’s hard to describe. The figure at Pump 4? It wasn’t human. It had this twisted, elongated shape, and it was standing still for hours, just waiting.  

Around 3 a.m., it moved toward the building, but instead of walking, it seemed to glide—like it wasn’t touching the ground. At one point, it looked straight at the camera. I swear it *knew* I was watching.  

Then, at the end of the footage, the screen glitched, and when it came back, there was a single word, written in what looks like blood, smeared on the door:  

**RUN.**

*Final Update*  

This is my last post. I’m quitting the gas station.  

Last night, after my shift ended, I went home, but I didn’t feel alone. The breathing—I heard it again. This time, it was inside my apartment.  

I ran out to my car and drove as far as I could. I haven’t gone back. I’m staying with a friend for now, but I keep feeling like something’s watching me from the woods nearby, waiting.  

If you’re reading this, don’t stop at the station on Highway 46. Don’t go near Pump 4.  

Something’s there, and it’s not leaving.
