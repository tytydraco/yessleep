I've been on day shift for the two and a half years and have had no major issues. It's like your average 9/5 however I've found one thing very strange and that's the fact that I haven’t had the night shift, until last night that is. Its rumoured that for some reason, there are strange “creatures”  that venture night, What's strange is that I work in a warehouse so It’s not very common to hear tales as most of the workers are middle aged serious men, often bearded and roughly 6 '+ so they don't often make up stories. I was right. 

At 8:25 i left for my first night shift, I started my ignition and began my journey. At 9:00 on the dot, I arrived and saw my coworker, David, at the main entrance. We opened the gateway and walked inside. The building had a metallic smell to it and was dimly lit by a buzzing light bulb that continuously flickers on and off. Both he and I entered our separate offices for camera checking before calling each other incase of “emergencies” (conversation as the job was well paid but boring.) After about 40 odd minutes or so, David said he felt faint and had messaged our manager that he’d be leaving. I jokingly said “watch out for the creatures,” he laughed in return then began walking out in rhythmed footsteps. Suddenly, i hear a blood curdling scream as he begged for help. 

I quickly joulted from my chair, guessing he had fallen in his nauseous state yet once I peered outside all I saw was a trail of blood. I got a gut feeling that I should leave through the fire exit and call the police for help yet I decided not to as me and David were friends outside of our job and I just couldn’t bring myself to leave him there. I, after a few seconds of consideration, went to help while quietly following the trail left behind. I turned the corner and wanted to throw up. I saw an eyeball with two severed fingers close by. I felt my heart stop as I second guessed myself yet again, but still, regrettably, went to try and help him. I continued walking to hear what sounded like inhuman sounds. In that moment, i fully accepted that the rumours were fully true. I turned the second right corner. I saw. Nothing. No blood, no creature, nothing. 

There were two doors on either side of me, the left was broken down while the right was a refurbished door with a blue paint coat. I stared, tempted to enter yet as i reached for the handle, i heard sounds of gnawing. Like a dog to a bone, there were winded gasps for air in between each growl and rip of what i guessed was flesh. After a few seconds of listening and yet again wanting to throw up, i realised it was behind the refurbished door. I stood there, mouth agape, not certain on what to do. I decided to run for the fire exit, along the way trying to dial 999. I escaped the building with no energy left but still running on adrenaline. I drove home and immediately quit that job. I was brought into custody as the main suspect, obviously, but other coworkers confirmed the story was close to theres yet for some reason the place wasn't shut down. After giving in multiple statements and signing some forms, i was released due to no evidence (the place had no cameras.) After suing the company, that warehouse was shut down due to a total of 3 deaths on the night shift.

 The night shift.
