My passion for photography first sparked when I was six years old, fat-faced and toying around with my late mother’s digital camera, pressing the pads of my stubby fingers on the tiny, dying screen as I fumbled through my shots from another sweaty afternoon in the playground.

&#x200B;

None of it was any good - mom’s old Toshiba translated movement as blinding, white blurs or pale yellow specters. Any faces I managed to capture came out looking like they were caught mid-yawn, their eyelids half-closed, lips parted, mouths hanging open lazily.

&#x200B;

Still, photography became a hyper-fixation for me. I was the kid with the cheap, chrome-colored camera in his hands at social gatherings, hopping from one crowd of adults to another, eager to accept any compliments I got for taking their pictures.

&#x200B;

My family wasn’t particularly well-off growing up, but we were close, so when I turned sixteen, my two older siblings shared the cost of a brand-new DSLR camera, which they handed to me in a blue cardboard box with white polka-dots while we were having dinner.

&#x200B;

I never won any accolades for my work. I’m telling you this not to incite any pity or sympathy from you - rather, I would like you to understand that despite the deep-seated passion I had for my work, I still was not exceptional in any shape or form. I was just in love.

&#x200B;

I was twenty-one years old when I had my first real gig at my sister's wedding. She and my now brother-in-law were both very frugal, so I tried offering my services for free, but they insisted on paying me anyway. I made a decent three-figure salary from one day’s affair, and for a twenty-one-year-old who lived off of cigarettes, coffee, canned meat, and potatoes, that was more than enough.

&#x200B;

The pictures were posted online, two bride-to-be’s asked for the name of the photographer, and I ended that year with three weddings and one very heartwarming dance night at a senior center in my portfolio.

&#x200B;

It’s been ten years since then. I work a ‘regular’ job during the day - I’m the guy who keeps the inventory in check at a hardware store. When I’m not tapping away at a keyboard and entering twenty different nut types onto an Excel sheet, I help with hauling boxes and keeping profits in check. When I’m not doing that, I go on coffee and donut runs for Todd and his three employees. Whenever a photographer gig comes up, I leave, freely.

&#x200B;

It was October then - wet and gray and chilly, like the air itself had turned into cold, unforgiving metal. The heater in Todd and I’s shared office was humming loudly and steadily, a single analog radio in the corner buzzing with love songs from the late 90’s.I leaned back against my chair and squeezed my eyes shut - the shape of all those damn words and numbers pressing painfully against the back of my eyelids. A single tear rolled down my cheek. Eyestrain, again. I pushed my glasses up to my forehead and wiped my eyes with a handkerchief. “Take a break,” Todd said, passively, as he took a sip of his coffee.

&#x200B;

I exhaled, loudly and slowly, and got up on my feet. It was two o’clock in the afternoon, and I could hear a few customers asking Geraldine if we had any cheaper casing nails. Geraldine was a retired shop teacher who applied to work with us, because, according to her, she wasn’t senile enough to not be working, and she hated sitting at home all day.

&#x200B;

The door to our office was right behind the glass casing where we kept our smaller wares - nuts, bolts, nails, and rolls of wire that we would rather not have prodded and played with by customers. So, when I stepped outside, I saw a familiar pink-faced man in a thick, mustard yellow puffer jacket, faded blue jeans, and damp snow boots. He was tall, large, and had a scraggly salt-and-pepper beard. I recognized him.

&#x200B;

“Jim!” I greeted, eagerly. The man looked at me, briefly confused, before his face lit up in recognition. “Richie!”Geraldine glanced at me, and then at him, “You boys know each other?” she asked, sweetly. I nodded.

&#x200B;

I met Jim in university - we were both freshmen, but due to certain circumstances he began university at twenty-five instead of eighteen. He had a scraggly beard, even then, although it used to be a deep, black that matched his bushy eyebrows and thick nest of hair. While the rest of us smoked and lived off of crappy food and three hours of sleep, Jim actually cooked. On Saturdays, he’d head down to the nearest family-owned grocery store and ask for scraps of leftover vegetables - the ones that had gone brown and spotty in places - then he’d return to his apartment, which he lived in alone, chop off the bad parts, and make up a mean stew. We spoke to each other properly for the first time when he came knocking on my door one Saturday evening, while I was nursing a bad cold, to hand me a tupperware of vegetable soup.

&#x200B;

“How are you?” I asked, approaching Jim. A young couple walked into the store, and Geraldine chirped out a cheery hello.

&#x200B;

“Well, you know,” he began, gesturing vaguely, “Married, two kids - both girls - getting fatter off of my wife’s cooking.” At that, he let out a rich, bellowing laugh. He was still as warm as ever. “So you married someone just like you,” I quipped, and he gave me another laugh, “Yeah, I guess! What about you?” He asked.

&#x200B;

“Ah, still single. No kids, just a cat,” I said, forcing a smile. Jim nodded understandingly, “Don’t rush it, man, the right girl is just around the corner,” he said. I hated platitudes, but Jim said it with such sincerity I couldn’t even really be mad at him. “So, what do you do now?” I asked, steering the subject away.

&#x200B;

“Oh, I’m a software developer now! I work from home - my company’s based in Australia.” The man had a well-paying job. The puffer jacket looked oddly expensive for a second.

&#x200B;

“That’s so cool!” I said, and I meant it. I was happy for Jim - he never gave me any reason not to be.

&#x200B;

“Oh! I have something for you actually,” Jim announced. I raised my eyebrows in polite anticipation, “Yeah?” He dug into the pocket of his yellow puffer jacket, grabbing for a phone that looked fragile in his large, stubby hand. “So, it’s still a beta, but the company I work for recently launched a nonprofit website that uses AI to look up - hey, you’ve been on the internet, right?”I nodded. I’ve been on the internet more than I’m proud of.“Cool!” he continued, “We launched a website that uses reverse image searching to help photographers find where their works have been used and published. It’s good for copyright. I don’t really know why the bosses wanted us to work on this, but honestly,” his expression changed for a second, and a wide grin touched his lips, “If you find any of your work published on a huge website, you could sue.”I snorted, “No, that’d be unnecessary.” I wasn’t a purist, and I barely considered myself an artist. If anyone used my pictures for a crappy toothpaste ad or on the banner of a wedding planner’s website, I wouldn’t care all that much. It’s not my face on there.“Aww, well I still think it’d be cool if you could see where your pictures have ended up, you know?” he said, glancing at me only momentarily before swiping an index finger across his phone screen. “Yeah,” I answered, perhaps a little distantly.I stood there across him, watching the hairs on his mustache bristle under his breath. It was weirdly hypnotic. When he looked back up at me, I quickly averted my gaze. “Okay, here it is.”The website that flashed before my eyes was boxy - minimalistic, as most websites had become since 2015. It was called Photografind - photograph find. Whoever came up with that name should have his salary reduced, I thought to myself, but it was probably the man who signed Jim’s paycheck that came up with it.The website presented itself in shades of a de-saturated brown, a dozen variations of blue, and a few hints of pale yellow and cream. “Trace your work,” appeared in a serif font underneath the webpage name - instructions, so to speak.“You can input your name in the search bar too,” he indicated, pointing at the three icons that appeared at the rightmost edge of the search bar - a magnifying glass, a camera, and the most generic upload button you could ever imagine. I didn’t feel like it, but I entered my name anyway. Jim had never slighted me in any way - pretending to be even just a little bit intrigued was the least I could do to repay years of kindness.“Okay, Jim, let’s see what you’ve got,” I said, maybe a little too excitedly, as I pressed the magnifying glass icon. It slid into the next screen - creamy white squares and rectangles against muted brown. Pictures began to fill these boxes one by one - old ones, new ones, ones I’d have already forgotten. A few of them weren’t even mine - my full name was Richard Grace Farrows. It wasn’t exactly uncommon.“Woah!” I declared, genuinely impressed this time around. I turned to look at Jim, and he was smiling from one round to cheek to the other. “Cool, eh?”“You worked on this?”He nodded, quite satisfied with himself.The rest of our conversation went by like a blur. I tried my best to be present during our thirty-minute-long conversation - Jim lived in the next town over and the only reason why he stumbled into Todd’s was because the three hardware stores in his town were either closed for renovation, too crowded, or too overpriced. This may very well be the last time I see him in a long while.Despite my initial lack of interest, I have to admit that my thoughts were half-preoccupied by Jim’s newest project. I couldn’t wait to come home that afternoon and scroll down as far as I can. I have a few photographs on my social media accounts that have been reposted and reshared quite a bit, and I couldn’t wait to see where they’ve ended up.Three o’clock came and went. Four thirty, Todd began to stretch and yawn and fidget, commenting on the lack of customers. Four forty-five, he let us go early. “You could do a lot with the extra fifteen minutes,” he remarked.I arrived home at five thirty - traffic was never heavy in our town of eighty thousand people, but the line at the diner I got my dinner from was especially long that day, for whatever reason. I parked my car into the driveway and marched into the front door with my usual chicken, ranch, and cheese sandwich tucked away in a brown paper bag.Larry, the stray cat I took in last year, was plopped on a weather-brown armchair when I walked in. I had a patchwork quilt my mom gave me when I moved out for university draped over it this morning, but when I came back, half of it was bundled up underneath the fat, orange cat while the rest of it fell limply to the floor.“Had a good day, pal?” I asked. He blinked at me slowly. He seemed to have caught a whiff of my food, as he suddenly jumped off his perch and approached me, not at all timidly, and turned his little pink nose up to me.I turned on my laptop, which lay open on my coffee table, and unwrapped my sandwich. Larry and I shared - I dropped little bits and pieces of chicken onto the floor as I ate.Photografind looked even more generically sleek and modern on a computer screen, I will say, but I didn’t care. A can of beer was sweating on a coaster on my coffee table, and Larry snored softly beside me.Again, I started by looking up my name - Richard Grace Farrows, my full government name. I had already seen the first dozen results earlier. A few pictures of nearby parks and nature reserves were posted on government websites -I was already aware of these. Some of the results that were returned to me were from my own websites and social media pages. A handful were from student portfolios - Examples of Angles in Photography, or Local Conservation Efforts. Weddings, baptism ceremonies, graduation photos - all of these were credited to me. I had already found most of these when I looked up my name on the internet before. Yes, I did that. I don’t care.I figured the real gems were to be found through their reverse Google image search. So, I opened a few of my social media accounts and linked my most popular photos into the search bar.As I had hoped, Photografind returned some really good results this time around. For example, I found one of my attempts at street photography on the cover of a self-published science fiction book with twenty-seven reviews (and an average rating of 3.2 stars) on Amazon. A few of my photographs made it on wedding blogs, too.I scrolled a little further, stumbling upon websites written in different languages. I found my still-life image of a glass bowl of pomegranates on a Chinese website that, when copied and pasted into Google Translate, advertised an herbal supplement as a cure-all for diseases such as cancer (all of them), Parkinson’s, and insomniaI spent the next three hours like that - laptop whirring quietly on my stomach as I lay on my couch with my feet up on the table. It was almost nine o’clock, I desperately needed to piss, and I was still in the clothes I had worn at work. This usually happened when I found a new thing to obsess over - everything else, bodily functions included, got pushed aside.At this point, I had seen a few oddities and a lot of duds. For every awfully-rendered advert from the early 2000s, there were three thoughtless, occasionally drunken, website or slideshow or poster that was clearly a class requirement of some sort. I wasn’t interested in Jared, Class of 2013’s, Psychology of Sex paper, nor was I interested in Ramona from Saskatchewan's Modern North American History essay.The last ‘interesting’ thing I found was an obscure, and notably dead, Japanese novelty store from 2008. Even that didn’t make me chuckle, or raise an eyebrow. I set my laptop down, and went to the bathroom to relieve myself. It hurt, a lot, and I stashed away another mental note, out of maybe hundreds, about going when I had to.When I came back, my laptop was still stuck on the same page as earlier. I was about to close my browser when something odd caught my attention.Everything I had seen so far was either bizarre or embarrassing. If any of the things I saw made me attach the word ‘creepy’ to it, it was only because of the comments people made about the folks I had photographed at weddings or events that made it a little too far out into the world. I hadn’t found anything criminal (yet), just the occasional comment that sang to the tune of, “I’d let so-and-so in the background hit it.”The picture that caught my eye was that of a man with his back turned three-quarters of the way from the camera. He was tall, thin, and dark, but instead of the usual undertones of yellow and red, his skin looked nearly gray and blue, like the blood had ceased to flow through his veins. My breathing slowed as I hovered the mouse over the thumbnail, and clicked on it to enlarge it.My screen filled with the dirty yellow walls of that room - the man and his matted black hair appeared a little clearer now. His hands were in the pockets of a pair of faded blue jeans, but instead of appearing casual and relaxed, his posture only emphasized how sharp the bones of his elbows were. Something about this photo made me feel queasy - dirty.For a moment, I wondered if this was a glitch. Maybe this was an ad - I didn’t see any reason why this would have anything to do with anything I took.I was ready to accept that as fact, albeit halfheartedly, and call it a night. Then, stupidly, I finally noticed the very center - the main focus - of the picture. It was a black picture frame, two fingernails wide, nailed on the wall. From where I sat, I could see the shapes of people’s faces, their clothes the color of wedding wear - white gown, peach pink dresses, and black suits. I leaned forward, narrowing my eyes, to take a closer look. I remember this photo now - it was a small July wedding from six years ago, the bride a friend of my neighbor’s.I had an awful, sinking feeling in the very pit of my stomach when my brain finally put the pieces together. What the hell was this supposed to be? Some freak’s odd attempt at artfully mourning the loss of his love? That seemed possible, but where was this even posted? There was no caption, no source, no website, no nothing. There wasn’t even a hint of a watermark anywhere on the picture.I wasn’t focusing on the man in the picture, but I caught movement from the corner of my eye - his elbow twitched, a little more outwards, at an angle impossible for any human. I shot back, almost falling into my couch, and slammed my computer shut.“What the fuck?” I whispered, an uncontrollable shudder overtaking me. I’ve had three cans of beer tonight - a special treat I had planned since last week because I missed drinking - and it made me feel limp, like a worm trying to swim in quicksand.I sat there, unnerved, for what felt like hours. Aside from the lights in the kitchen, which I kept on in case I came stumbling for water in the middle of the night, my entire house was shrouded in darkness, and the shadows that bled out from the kitchen into my living room felt rather sinister. I briefly imagined them as snakes, hungry and venomous, slithering towards me in the inky darkness.The fear did settle, eventually. I rationalized it as an effect of the alcohol - I had been sober for almost a year, now, after all - not that I was an alcoholic, or anything. My ex girlfriend just came from a family of social drinkers, and they were a very social bunch. Any achievement, big or small, was always celebrated by inviting everyone back to the family home and taking out dad’s assortment of wine, beer, and whisky.As if he sensed my need for him, Larry came crawling into the living room, meowing softly in the darkness. That finally stirred me enough to get up, take a shower, and go to bed.I woke up the next morning with what I called a ‘soft’ hangover - I didn’t feel like cracking my skull open like a walnut, but I didn’t feel incredible either. It was a Saturday, and I was really dizzy. Staring at my phone for too long made me the room spin, so I lay in bed pathetically, until Larry came meowing loudly into my room, demanding to be fed.At nine twenty-two, I was frying up three eggs and downing a tall glass of cold water while my cat, now fed and happy, sat on the dining table with his paws tucked underneath him. There was a long, narrow window from where I stood that showed my neighbor’s backyard. As if on cue, Bonnie Wakefield - Mrs. Wakefield to the neighborhood children - shot out of their backdoor with her phone pressed against her ear. The skies overhead were gray, reminding me of the awful pale man in the pictures. I pushed that thought away, averting my gaze back to Bonnie.If she were to glance at me, I’d just wave and smile. The Wakefields and I had a friendly relationship - accidentally looking at each other for too long through our windows wasn’t a new occurrence in the years since we’ve known each other.Bonnie was in striped pink pajamas and a lavender bathrobe, her hair a nest of wispy blonde. I couldn’t hear what she was talking about on the phone, but she seemed restless, disturbed by whatever news she heard from the other end of the conversation. The bed sheets and blankets on their clothesline stirred in the wind, and I finally stopped staring at my neighbor.I somehow managed to avoid opening my laptop all day - a part of me was afraid of being cursed, that I’d somehow turn on my computer to find the picture of that strange man across my screen. Unfortunately for me, I had to update my social media and edit a few photographs for my portfolio eventually. So, at around half past six that evening, I sat once again on my couch with a steaming hot bowl of buttered vegetable stew on the table.Fortunately for me, the strange man did not haunt my laptop, and I was able to edit a handful of wide-shots and portraits for my website without any issues. Well, except for the fact that, much like the time I spent talking to Jim, my head was filled with the shadow of that damned, cursed man. I thought to myself, maybe if I had spent more time exploring that website, I’d be able to pinpoint the origins of that picture. Maybe there was nothing strange or foreign or paranormal to it - maybe it was just someone’s well-meaning art project - an ode to yearning, to longing for normalcy. Maybe.Maybe it was even part of a series, I thought to myself. I don’t know why I rationalized it that way - I don’t understand why I tried to make that gritty photograph into something it didn’t deserve to be: something meaningful, something heartfelt, something…pure.In the end, my hunger - no, my greed, for answers - got the better of me. Curiosity trumped fear, once again. A single thought entered my mind as I entered Photografind into my browser’s search engine: “If this kills you…I hope the answers were worth it.”The thing about Photografind is, you can upload up to ten photos at once and have it return multiple results for all of them. Thanks to my inebriated state from last night, however, I had already forgotten which combination of pictures I looked up to find the picture of that man.I never did find that photo again, unfortunately - or maybe that was a fortunate thing, after all, considering what happened to me after that fateful day. Instead, what I did stumble upon eventually was a whole other series of photos entirely - and my god, there was more of them.In one such picture, for example, at the forefront stood a little boy, about six or seven, standing sideways with his head turned towards a wall wrapped in greasy-looking, blue wallpaper. I couldn’t see is face at all, just the back of his matted brown hair and the nape of his pale white neck. Much like the man from last night, he looked far too malnourished to be able to hold up his own body, let alone his own head. His right calf, from what I could see, was larger than his left - swollen and bruised, or maybe inflamed from an infection. The thought made my stomach sink.To my relief though, this image didn’t move. This sounds incredibly stupid, but I actually did try to trick it, coax it, into doing so. I glared at it with an intensity that left my eyes burning for a handful of painful, drawn-out minutes, and when that didn’t quite work to fulfill my purposes, I looked to the side, glancing at it only through my peripheral vision.Yet it remained the way it always had been - frozen. The picture the young boy stared at was, tragically, a family photo. The people in the picture left no mark on my memory - I recognized them from a time and place I had definitely been in in this dimension, not just in a dream. Even then, I couldn’t make sense of who they were or when this picture was taken. It was all a blur.I decided to move on.My scrolling became more frantic by the second, eyes jolting from one thumbnail to another, studying the shapes and colors of each for no longer than three seconds. I was a man on a mission. If it had bold texts or bright colors, I didn’t even bother paying attention to it.There were several more photos from this strange series, which I titled, “People Looking at Walls.” It was about as creative as the website’s name, but it was practical and easy to claw out of my memories. The next picture I saw was of a family, also standing sideways, but this time I could see half their face as well. They were rail-thin, and perhaps starved for sleep too, judging by the bruise-colored bags that shadowed their eyes.Their eyes, I noticed, looked almost bugged-out, and their irises were far too large, and black, with only the shyest hints of yellowish-white peering through behind the inkiness. “What the hell?” I pondered out loud - there was no picture frame on the wall directly in front of me, but I reckoned it was out of frame - nailed to a distant wall in front of them. It wasn’t for me to see, I thought.Tap, tap, tap. My finger pads pressed heavily against the ‘down’ arrow key as cold sweat drops began to form on the nape of my neck. Something about this felt wrong - so deeply, terribly wrong. I’ve already been at it for an hour though, I realized, looking down at the time in the lower right corner of my screen.I inhaled, deeply, like a diver about to take a plunge into cold, unknown, waters, and continued.More pictures. More pictures of haggard people staring at a wall, both visible and unseen, appeared. I’ve clicked on seven more of them now, two hours later, and yet I still couldn’t trace any of them back to a source. By the looks of it, nobody had reposted any of them either - and I tried, I swear. I really, really tried.I was getting tired, and a little peckish. The novelty of it all eventually wore out, and since none of them had moved this time around, I decided that my theory was right, after all - it was just the alcohol. I chuckled to myself. How silly.I ought to get in touch with Jim about this - he might get a laugh out of it, perhaps this was part of its soft launch: a little parlor trick to spook its very first guests, which would inevitably cause a stir online, drawing in more traffic to the site. Clever, I thought.Five more minutes, my mind urged, and I obliged, because why not, after all?Three rows of pictures was all it took for me to find it - the picture that ended it all. It was tucked away between a photo from someone’s aunt’s Facebook profile and an article about choosing the right wedding dress for your budget. Looking at the thumbnail alone, I already had this gnawing fear wrap itself around my neck and chest. It was the back of someone’s head, a few bald patches visible through a nest of dirty gray and black hair.The skin of the person's neck was the same greenish-gray hue as everyone else's. Nobody in these photos seemed to have spent a single day under the sun - hell, none of them seemed alive. I pushed that thought away. I didn't want to know.A faint tapping sound began to echo in my room - it was soft, and dull, like someone tapping against a window pane. This pulled me out of my stupor, and without thinking I snapped my head towards the narrow window beside my front door.The curtains were pulled back, still. I was transfixed in my mission to find as many of these photos as I could that I forgot to draw the curtains back. I stared at the emptiness behind the window pane, and there was nothing there. Absolutely nothing except for the view of my front yard - which, honestly, wasn't much to begin with.In the blanket of the early evening, shadows of trees and shrubs crept along my patchy, unkempt lawn. I stared, a little harder, and shrugged it off. It was probably a bug, or a small bird, that flew into the glass.I looked back down at my laptop once again, and in that moment my nerves turned to dust. The blood in my veins ran dry, and cold, and slow. A single croak managed to escape my lips as I stared, horrified, at my computer screen. The man with the patchy hair was now looking at me - into me. His neck was twisted towards me at an inhuman angle, mouth stretched horribly across his thin face. On the edge of each side of his lip was a cheek the size of an apple - comically inflated and red like those of an old ventriloquist's doll. He blinked, slowly and mechanically - his eyes were two perfect circles, with two perfectly round, black irises, and two even blacker pupils. The rings in those eyes seemed to go on and on forever, like those of the trunk of a primordial tree, drawing you in until you drowned. The thing that terrified me the most about this man is the way his eyes, nose, and unnaturally upturned smile were all the same size and width, stretched across the blank canvas of his pale face. He looked at me, intently, seeming to twitch a little, and I looked back at him, shuddering all over. He looked so distorted, so broken.A warm stream of liquid filled my jeans, dripping onto the floor. I heard Larry hiss loudly from the kitchen threshold, the hairs on his back probably standing. The man said nothing, only staring. The wall behind him was empty."Mr. Farrows? Richie? Hello? Are you home?" I jolted out of my couch, tossing my laptop aside. It crashed on the table, the screen flashing white once before choking my browser back up like nothing had happened. The picture returned to normal, and dreadful face turned away from me again. Yet the knocking on my door persisted."Richie?" Bonnie's muffled singsong voice filled the silence."One minute!" I called out, pulling myself up. My jeans were darkened where my urine had flowed, and there was a small pool at my feet."Goddammit," I cursed, rushing into the bathroom. "One second, Bonnie!" I yelled again. All of my clothes were in my bedroom, which was at the other end of the house, and I didn't want to take off my jeans and underwear and put on a new pair without washing myself first. My face burned. I turned the faucet on the bathroom sink on, and splashed the front of my shirt, and a few more parts of my jeans, with water. Rushing back out into my living room, I tossed the towel onto the floor and over the couch, before opening the door."Hey, Bonnie," I greeted, attempting to hide my lower half behind the door."Can I come in?" she asked, almost meekly.I looked back into my living room, and at her again, "Sorry, Bonnie, now might not be -"She pushed past the door, briefly pressing herself up against me, and into my living room. Neither the towel on the floor nor my appearance bothered her. "It won't take too long," she insisted, twirling around to face me again. "Alright, what?" She inhaled, and for the first time, I noticed the glimmer of tears in her eyes, "Do you remember Gail? You probably don't remember her by her name, but she was my friend…the one who got married a few years back. You took her photos?"My spine turned into ice. The one in the photos on the wall. I remembered - not her name, as Bonnie correctly guessed, but I remembered her, alright. "Yeah?" I offered, unsure of what to say."Well," her voice began to falter, "I know you didn't know her all too well, but I thought you should know anyway. See, Jack doesn't -"Oh, I thought, here we go again.“Bonnie, what are you doing?” I snapped, cutting her off with the sharp tone of a parent scolding a disobedient child. She glanced up at me with those big, round eyes, and for a moment they almost appeared perfectly circular too. She looked offended - no, something softer, weaker. She looked hurt.“Richie,” she half-whispered, in a voice so tender and maternal it made my skin crawl. She reached out to me, but I stepped back, afraid that she would suddenly snake herself around me like a constrictor. “Bonnie -” her name had melted into a warning on my tongue, “Bonnie, I don’t know what’s going on between you and Jack, and that is rightfully none of my business, but goddamn…” I inhaled, growing increasingly aware of the sickening, wet warmth on my legs, “…you’re married. With kids.”She blinked at me dimly, hesitating to speak as her lips parted and closed. Finally, she exhaled, “Jack doesn’t love me.” Saying that out loud seemed to ease her spirits, “We’re on the brink of divorce,” she added, casually.My temples began to throb, a dull ache creeping towards my forehead and scalp. I wanted her out of my damn house, and now, yet here she remained, completely unashamed of herself. It pissed me off.“Bonnie, I don’t care.”“Fuck you, you know,” she hissed, but the venom on her tongue didn’t reach me. I had bigger fears to wrestle with, “Fuck you,” she repeated, taking one small step backward, “Fuck you to hell, Richie,” she damn near growled. Her expression contorted into an ugly, wrinkled grimace, almost like a  prune. “You act all high and mighty, as if you haven’t been watching me through your kitchen window like a goddamn creep!” she shrieked, bringing the pain in my head to a new crescendo.“I don’t understand what you want from me, Bonnie. I don’t want you. I don’t want to fuck you. I didn’t not fuck you because I had a girlfriend last year - no, I didn’t want to fuck you because I don’t fucking want you, damn it!”The clouds seemed to part in Bonnie’s head, at last. A shaky breath escaped her lips, and I braced myself for the argument that was about to continue. A single tear rolled down her face. I cringed. I hate seeing people cry, especially to me.“I just wanted to tell you about Gail,” she said, her voice trembling. The memory of how this all started fell upon me.I kept my voice distant.“What about her?”Gail. She had a smile that revealed a little too much gum, and a wide nose with nostrils that flared whenever she spoke too eagerly. Gail. I remember, and the memory of her wedding portrait made my knees buckle. I steadied myself, even though the room around me felt like it was spinning.“She…” Bonnie said, almost under her breath, “They found her dead on her driveway, Richie,” she added. “Dead,” two more tears fell down her cheeks, and another, until a steady stream of tears streaked her face and dripped onto her shirt.I stood in front of her, feeling equal parts horrified and awkward, yet angry that I had not been left to remain ignorant to this news. How the fuck did this happen?“What…” I trailed off, unsure what to ask. Bonnie filled me in on the details. Gail Louise Summers, thirty-four, was found dead on her driveway, her body mauled and mangled, and then dragged from her garage into the open air of the night. The trail of blood started in front of their fridge, Bonnie told me. It seemed like Gail woke up to grab a drink of water, when something - someone grabbed her and attacked her.The attack was vicious, animalistic - it lacked logic, or motivation, or reason. One evening Gail was kissing her two-year-old good night, and the next morning, at around five thirty, their neighbor was pounding their front door, shrieking for their inhabitants to wake up and smell the blood in the morning air.I remained silent throughout Bonnie’s retelling of the events, save for a few grunts and gasps of horror. How the fuck else was I supposed to react? I barely knew Gail. All the while Bonnie was sobbing, mourning the loss of a loved one, while I, piece of shit as I was, remained completely frozen where I stood.Bonnie left a little after that, thanking me, and making some excuse or another about picking up her kids from baseball or basketball or soccer practice. I couldn’t remember which, nor did I care. When she left, closing the front door behind her, I collapsed to my couch and began gasping for air.Gail. One of those not-people - those broken, distorted, abominable people - had been looking at her picture. Did he - it - do it? Was that a premonition? My mind began to spin. No way, I thought. There simply was no way. This is bullshit. A coincidence. One of those circumstances in time that seem connected but really, just really, are not.“What the fuck is happening?” I hissed into my living room. Larry sat atop a dresser a few feet across me, his irises nothing but two thin, black slits against bright copper.Between fight, flight, and freeze, I very obviously chose the last option of the three. My hands were cold, my eyes painfully dry, and my throat ached, yet I remained perched like a dumb bird in my nest. How am I supposed to sleep, I wondered for the first time. I wasn’t in the right state of mind to make any decisions - I desperately needed help. Who was I supposed to call? The cops? The site administrators? God Gail’s husband?Tomorrow, I thought, when the darkness of night doesn't feel so ominous, I'll call Jim. He *has* to know a thing or two.
