 When I was younger, much younger, I lived on a ranch in Nevada. It was outside of Las Vegas a ways to the southwest in some undeveloped land in the middle of the desert. 

It was a charming bit of land with a small community of people that were friendly enough. They were all older folks so me being a kid I struggled to really make
any actual freinds, for better or worse.

I didn't live there for long, half a school year and through summer break. 
It was a very free life on the ranch, very isolated from everything.

Early life on the ranch took some getting used to for me, most of my early childhood years I lived in the city with my mother and two older siblings Kate and Mark. They outstretched me by quite a few years and treated the ranch life as a sort of escape. I didn't share their view.

Mom moved us all out to the ranch in search for a better life, "everything is going to be so much better here" she would say. We moved a lot so I got used to hearing her say that, a lot.

We got acquainted with the ranchers. Old man Robert, old man JJ and old lady Mary with her seven German Shepards. I liked the dogs, they were my buddies and they made me feel safe. My family would have too but they were never around.

Kate I hardly saw through our time living there, maybe twice in passing when she came home with her boyfriend to pick up a few change of clothes. Mark usually stayed over at freinds houses, sometimes he'd invite them over to our small trailer we called home but it was rare. I saw him about as much as Kate.

Mom was always working, when she wasn't working she was out on the town doing grown up things with grown up people or that's what I was told. 

Yep most days, and nights, I spent alone. At least I thought I was alone. 

 Soon after school ended for summer break I had more free time on my hands. Naturally, I'd stay out late playing with cool sticks I found while imagining 
I was some soldier fighting aliens with my sidekick dogs. Mary's dogs were the best thing about that summer. Not all of them were fond of playing pretend soldier 
With a little kid but Lilly and Dart were.

Lilly and Dart were Mary's biggest most ferocious dogs, they were her favorites. they were my favorite too.

They would always walk with me early in the morning and late in the evening whenever I would go to get eggs from the chicken coop next to Mary's house. It was a bit of a long walk so having company was always a pleasure. Most days those eggs were all I had to eat so I depended on those chickens. Mary knew it and let me take all of them whenever I wanted.

Mary kept the chickens well fed and in good health. All her animals from the dogs to the chickens to her prize horses Randy and Butter. Each animal strong and proud. 

Especially Dart, he was big. He was the top dog without question, nothing ever bothered us on the ranch. Occasionally you could hear the yapping and yowling of coyotes off in the distance but they knew better than to get too close to the ranch. 

Between Dart Lilly and the bunch I felt pretty dam safe going outside at all hours of the night and just doing whatever. 

Until one day he and lilly were found dead.

 I woke up on that morning, same as any other. I got out of bed, brushed my teeth checked the trailer to see if anyone returned home, empty as usual. 
I was hungry and the fridge was empty. I knew what that meant, time to throw on the dirty shirt I wore from yesterday and go walk to the coop.

The walk lead past Randy and Butters Corral on the north side of the ranch. Usually I'd pass some desert gourds growing along side the fence but they were all smashed up. I saw JJ walking along the wooden fence that acted as a partition from the corral. 

He was smashing all the gourds, he had sour look on his face. I went to walk past him without disturbing him, it looked like he had some stuff on his mind. Hey" he shot a look toward me, " you seen anything this morning?" He asked then resumed smashing gourds with a long stick. 

No sir, I... I just woke up..." i remember saying. he put down his gourd breaker and motioned for me to come over to him. I knew who JJ was but I would be lying if I said I wasn't comfortable getting too near him. He was an old paiute man who
I've seen my siblings talk to from time to time but other than the first introduction with him I'd never really spoken too.

He placed a gruff heavy hand on my shoulder. His eyes looked sad but frightful. Years of sun and alcohol took its toll on his weary features and it scared me as a little kid. I remember tearing up just looking him in the eye.

He pulled a necklace from around his neck and told me to take it. I didn't understand, he rhen removed his hand from my shoulder and  shambled away.

It was such a strange interaction, at the time I had no idea what the hell he just gave me or why. After that bizzare encounter I realized Dart and lilly weren't with me, they always walked with me to the coop. 

I made the rest of my way to get some eggs when I saw it. I saw what happened to them. A hole was ripped into the side of the chicken coop. Feathers and blood were scattered around the entrance of the hole, splintered wood looked like teeth that gnashed everything that used to live inside then spit everything out.

Around the back side of the coop I spotted Mary, she was standing off to the side of what used to be her favorite dogs Dart and Lilly.

They were ripped to pieces. Their body parts and innards were strewn about 
In a mosaic of blood and dirt. Their heads were placed in the middle of the viscera, eyes gouged out and replaced with small desert gourds. I dont remember much else of that scene, I looked away, I cried.
