I need to get this off my chest. I don’t care about the consequences anymore. I don’t care if I’m arrested. I don’t care if I go to prison. I just need someone to know what happened.

A few weeks ago, a man named Arthur went missing.

Arthur wasn’t the kind of person who could disappear quietly. Online, he was everywhere. If he stopped posting for ten minutes, people noticed. If an account went inactive, someone would archive it. That was just how the community worked.

So when Arthur vanished completely, people started looking.

Then the tapes arrived.

Every admin. Every longtime moderator. Everyone who had ever documented, mocked, or interfered with Arthur’s life received a VHS tape in the mail. No return address. No note. Just a label written in marker:

TROLL MAN

Arthur had been online since the early days of the internet. He loved medieval fantasy, trolls, and Shrek—obsessively. He drew comics, wrote rambling posts, and filmed videos in his bedroom that he called the “Round Table Tavern,” even though it was just his room in his mother’s house, filled wall to wall with memorabilia.

People messed with him. At first lightly. Then constantly. Then cruelly.

It snowballed. More people joined in. It became entertainment.

Then he disappeared.

The tape I received begins with Arthur dancing in front of a poorly edited background of his “tavern.” He’s smiling, performing stiff karate moves.

“No need to worry about me,” he says, glancing repeatedly to his left. “These trolls will never take my spirit.”

He laughs. His movements are erratic.

“There is no way they could take me. I am too powerful. They are all too stupid—”

The camera suddenly tips sideways.

You can hear movement off-screen. A struggle. Three heavy thumps. Then a scream.

The tape cuts to static.

The police told me later that this was the first tape chronologically.

I didn’t tell them everything.

Two weeks later

Arthur’s mother told police she hadn’t seen him in six months. He used to call her regularly. Then he just… stopped.

A few weeks after that, she received a VHS tape labeled THE BRIDGE.

It shows a dark, abandoned bridge at night. You can barely make it out. A voice off camera recites riddles—nonsensical, mocking, childish.

That’s when she filed a missing persons report.

The police searched briefly. Arthur had a history of wandering, filming himself, posting videos. They assumed he’d come back.

He never did.

I went to his town in Illinois. People remembered him as quiet. Reclusive. He wandered streets alone. Sometimes he’d visit Barnes & Noble and buy fantasy novels.

Near the end, people said he’d begun proclaiming himself the reincarnation of King Arthur in public. He was eventually banned from the bookstore. After that, he was mostly regarded as a nuisance.

The police eventually allowed me to view what they believed was the second tape.

Arthur sits at a wooden table in front of a fake fantasy tavern background. He wears a Viking helmet, a fake beard, and has a visible black eye and bruising on his neck. He holds a beer pitcher and a turkey leg.

“I am the mighty King Arthur,” he says. “This mead and meat will keep me strong for my fair maidens.”

A voice behind the camera speaks.

“What maidens?”

Arthur hesitates. “Well… my dear Guinevere—”

A massive shadow looms over him.

The tape cuts out.

After the purge

After the tapes were leaked, the community erased everything. Forums wiped. Wikis deleted. Archives scrubbed. I helped enforce it. I threatened people. Blackmailed some.

I hate myself for that.

But something worse started happening.

Anyone who tried to rebuild—any post, site, or even hashtag mentioning Arthur—received a package.

One woman opened her door to find a medieval sword hanging from a string above her porch.

Another received a mace.

One man received a bundle of straw.

After that, their lives collapsed.

The man with the straw—his house burned down. He and his family died inside.

Others vanished. Their posts were deleted. Accounts gone. No contact. Only rumors remained.

A woman crushed her family with rocks.

Another cut the string and let the sword fall into her body.

No proof. Just stories.

Just like Arthur.

The third tape

Police described the remaining tapes to me.

Most were static. Or long shots of a blacksmith’s forge. Always with the outline of a man watching from the background.

Only seven tapes featured Arthur.

The third tape begins with text:

FOR THE FIRST OF MY KIND

It shows a figure—what the police called “the Troll Man”—chasing Arthur through the woods with a cattle prod.

Arthur screams.

The figure tackles him.

Electricity crackles.

The only sounds are Arthur’s screams and muffled laughter.

I knew who it was meant for. The first major troll. His username was Red Bump.

They found him weeks later.

Shaved. Starving. Living under a bridge.

He barely spoke. Just repeated one sentence:

“Over the trees, in the hole, you will find the king dead as the door.”

That’s all it keeps single I’ll get back to all of you when I find out more information.
