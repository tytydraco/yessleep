"Samuel, where are we heading to?" I scream because of the irritability of the sweat caused by the gloves and mask I put on.
 

"We are almost there, Babe," He replied.
 

As we were walking through the meadows, the bushy trees acted as an obstacle.
 

Though there was a torch, I couldn't look down because of the snake's hiss.
 

"This is it," Samuel said, with one of his fingers pointed towards a mansion.
 

"So are we going to kidnap this house owner?" I questioned. "Yeah," He answered.
 

As we were heading towards the backdoor, I asked him to name the owner, to which he replied," Colonel Jacob.".
 

"But that's your dad, Samuel!" I question in an enraged tone. "Shut the fuck up, Rebecca," Samuel mumbled in anger.


Amidst the turmoil, I was walking behind Samuel like a sheep. We jumped over the wall and stood near the back door. Thinking about my Immoral acts, I slowly became anxious. To aggravate the situation, I saw Samuel taking out an axe, wrapped in a cloth, whose handle was broken.
 

"You said we are here to kidnap him; I ain't going to cause any harm to your dad," I said in anger.
 

"The Axe is just to scare him," He replied.
 

Using the axe, Samuel destroyed the back door, and we entered the house. "That was so loud," I told him.
 

Within a few minutes, we reached his dad's room, whose door was kept open with the TV's light falling out.
 

"You stay right here; I'll go and take a peek," Samuel whispered.
 

I stood behind the wall and was expecting a greener pasture, thinking about the plan's execution. And all my hopes were extinguished when I heard Samuel's dad screaming in pain.
 

"What the actual fuck?" I scream as I intrude into the room. The swear echoed throughout the whole house. I saw Samuel's dad tied to his bed with his shirt ripped off and all his fingers except the pinky one on the right Amputated.


The Blood falling down the bed mimicked a miniature waterfall.


"C'mon, untie me; you're clueless about what's about to happen," Samuel's Dad requested.
 

Unable to move my eyes, I stood there, motionless. In a moment, I see Samuel coming out of the bathroom, putting on surgical gloves.


"What are you doing?" I said. My voice was 
inaudible because of the fear. "Shut the fuck up and go stand outside the room," He ordered.
 

When I stood outside the room, Samuel, smiling, Pulled out an ice pick and walked towards his Dad.
 

"What is that thing in your hand?" His Dad Screamed. "The same thing you believed would cure my mother," He replied.
 

"No, that was an accident; you knew that," His dad said out of fear. "I was just 12," He bellowed.
 

"I don't want to be a part of this; can I leave?" I scream. "No, not yet; just listen to me," Samuel replied before adding...
 

"This mother-fucker abandoned me and my mom on this day 7 years ago, February 4, 2016. He fucked his employee, and when he got caught, he killed her."
 

"You need to accept the fact that we're divorced." His Dad Screamed sorely, as the bleeding and the pain in his hands were unbearable. "No, you were not," Samuel roared.
 

There was clear contention between the father and son.
 

"He cheated on my Mom, Rebecca; He killed her by performing a lobotomy; He has to pay the price for ruining our lives," He said.
 

"Your mother isn't a saint; she was a witch who used to perform lobotomies illegally. She knew that it was fatal. She ruined lives," His Dad said.
 

"The day you left, our lives went uphill. You showed us no mercy; the Lord saved us," Samuel said.
 

"Don't talk about cheating, my son; Cheating Is Inevitable," His father replied.
 

"No, It's not, How can you even utter such nonsense? Fuck you," Samuel said.
 

"Don't you think you'll ever cheat when you find a better-looking person, when you find a well-settled, rich douchebag, when you find a bitch who satisfies your fetishes, out of these thousands of crores of mother-fucking people?"
 

"Does it not tempt you to choose when you get a Bitch who is perfectly healthy rather than a person who is physically challenged?"
 

"What is the use of vows when there is a divorce?"
 

"What do you say to your dead wife, who is still lonely and waiting for you when you meet her in the afterlife, after you fucked and married another bitch? Isn't that cheating my son?"
 

"Don't you ever cheat on your girlfriend by fantasising about another bitch in your mind?,
 

"You were born with a demon inside you; I didn't want to be associated with bringing up a demon; she was a witch; so are you; you're a pathetic, unholy piece of shit," His Dad said, Laughing maniacally.
 

Ran out of logic, Samuel took the ice pick and grabbed his dad's chin before piercing the ice pick into his left eye socket.
 

"Your mom wanted to taste her own medicine; she wanted it to end. I just did what she craved: go check the cabinet." His dad uttered in pain before losing consciousness.
 

Samuel, out of pure anger, twirled the ice pick, laughing maniacally. The ruptured eye's blood spilled into Samuel's mouth.
 

So Many things hit me that day that I was all numb. I was just witnessing a murder out of nowhere. The dad, motionless, was pointing towards the cabinet with his pinky finger.
 

The cabinet was right in front of me. Samuel was just staring at the dead, unfazed.
 

Battling the stagnation, I sneaked to the cabinet and opened it. There were a lot of papers in it. With tears rolling out the whole time I was searching, Samuel never seemed to be bothered, as he was just staring at his dad's body.
 

Out of all the documents, I found a file. Going through it, I found out that Samuel's parents were divorced, and he was in denial the whole time.
 

Extremely shocked, I slowly started turning back.
 

When I looked back, Samuel was out of sight. "Where is he?" I say to myself before hearing some deep breaths behind me.
 

When I turned around, I saw Samuel reading the divorce papers in my hands.
 

"Are they really divorced?" Samuel asked like an innocent infant. "It says so," I mumble.
 

"Fuck, maybe I am the one who needs a Lobotomy," He said, smirking, then smiling, and finally laughing out loud.
 

Dropping the files, I slowly started retreating.
 

"Don't worry, Rebecca, I'll never hurt you", He said before piercing the ice pick into his eye socket.
 

"Fuck!" I scream before fleeing the crime scene.
 

I right away reported everything I witnessed to the cops.
 

To this day, I still can't believe that I dated a guy for a whole year without being aware of his sinister persona. Every time I see something sharp, like a needle, I get paranoid, and the Nightmares crawl back.
 

I still question my deeds, especially the unholy ones. I've spent a few nights quarrelling with my thoughts and questioning my existence.
 

"Oh, What have I become? I was part of a sin; can he forgive me? Do I deserve to Repent", The following question has become my shadow.
 

Maybe one day I'll move on, or I may not.
 

I wish I could be Reborn and bury the past forever and ever.
