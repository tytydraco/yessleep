I’m a college student, and for the past few months, I’ve been getting calls after midnight.
Unknown number. No caller ID.

At first, it was just missed calls. Then came voicemails. Static at first. Faint breathing. Then whispers.

I blocked the number. The calls kept coming. Each time, from a new number. It was like whoever—or whatever—was calling refused to be stopped.

One night, the voicemail was different. Clear. It was my voice, sobbing, repeating:
“Don’t open the door.”

The next morning, my front door was wide open. The lock was broken from the inside. My phone was on the floor, playing another voicemail. Calm this time. Whispering:
“I’m already inside.”

I tore through my house. Every room, every closet, every window—nothing. No footprints. No signs of anyone.

Days passed. I stayed with friends, studied at cafés, never alone. But the voicemails didn’t stop. Every night, a new number. Every night, the same whisper:
“I’m already inside.”

The cops didn’t believe me. Weeks later, I moved across town. First night in my new place, I felt safe—until my phone buzzed again. Unknown number.

Voicemail. My voice. Slower this time. Mocking.
“You moved, but I followed.”

The next morning, my door was unlocked.

I started turning my phone off at night. But it always turned itself back on. Always with a new voicemail.

Once, it was me laughing—high, manic, echoing through my apartment. Then the message:
“Check the mirror.”

I did. The glass was fogged, though I hadn’t showered. Slowly, words appeared in the condensation:
DON’T LISTEN TO HER.

My phone buzzed again. Different voice this time—rasping, inhuman.
“She belongs to me now.”

The mirror cracked.
And my reflection smiled.

I wasn’t smiling.

It got worse. Screens glitched when I walked by. My reflection blinked late. It mouthed words I hadn’t spoken:
“Let me in.”

My friends said I talked in my sleep. Repeating the same phrase:
“Don’t open the door.”

But I wasn’t asleep. I was awake. Standing at the door. Hand on the knob. Something was pulling me forward.

I smashed my phone once. Thought I was free. But the voicemail came back anyway, hissing through the walls, through the cracks, into my ears:
“You can’t break me. You are me.”

That’s when I knew—I wasn’t haunted. I was a cage.

Last night, I sat in front of the mirror. No lights. No phone. Just me.

“I know you’re there,” I whispered.

And my reflection answered.
“You were never the one getting the voicemails. I was.”

My phone lit up across the room. Dead battery, but alive anyway.
(1) New Voicemail.

I couldn’t stop myself. I pressed play.

It was me. Screaming.
“PLEASE DON’T LET HER OUT! PLEASE DON’T—”

The mirror exploded outward. Glass everywhere.
And then she stepped out.

My reflection. Whole. Breathing. Smiling.

I tried to scream, but no sound came. She knelt, brushed my face gently, and whispered:
“Thank you for holding my place.”

Then she picked up my phone. Dialed. Left a voicemail.

My friends got it this morning. It was my voice. Calm. Soft.

“Don’t open the door.”

But when they went to my apartment, the door was already open.
And inside?

Nothing.

Just my phone, still recording.
