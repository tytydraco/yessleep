For those of you who expressed worry in my[ first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lrvpxd/i_thought_my_grandmas_rules_were_fake_then_i) and absolutely can’t wait until the end of this one to know if Gran’s alright, then here’s your reassurance. Gran is fine. Totally fine. Nothing is wrong.

But we’ll get there.

The day after the incident with Red Hiker (that’s what all of you seem to be calling him), I did three things in this order.

First. I went to check the void tree. This probably could have waited until later, but that’s how this whole incident began in the first place, and I figured now wasn’t the time for taking risks with Gran’s rituals. The bucket under the spile was nearly full of sap. I’d planned on dropping it off at the cabin, but once I was there, staring at the dark liquid, I realized I didn’t know if that was allowed.

If I took it back could I just leave it in the bucket? Did I have to jar it like Gran, and if so how?

That’s the thing. I’m still not sure what counts as a rule and what doesn’t. Most of Gran’s rituals I’ve always dismissed as quirks of her own upbringing. I never wrote them all down. We never explicitly discussed what was allowed and what wasn’t, so now, I was left to just… *guess*.

Anyway, I left the bucket. 

Second. I locked our front door. Sure, Gran always makes sure we unlock it before sunrise, but I *did* do that. She’s never said anything about re-locking it, and you can bet I wasn’t leaving such easy access into the cabin when the Red Hiker was still hanging there between the trees.

Except, of course, he was gone by the time I came back from the void tree. Delightful.

Third. I went to check on Gran.

Doctor McKenty was gone when I got there. That might sound surprising to you, especially if you’ve ever been to one of the massive hospitals I’ve seen on T.V. with nurses and waiting rooms, but our town doesn’t have those. Gran was the only patient at the time, and Doctor McKenty isn’t just a doctor. He can’t just wait around all day when he has other things to do, but this would probably make more sense if I told you a bit more about where we live.

As I’ve already explained, Gran and I live off some ways in the Deepwoods. We’re completely alone there. I’ve begged Gran to get us a phone, but she’s always said the same thing. “Never speak with something you can’t see the face of.”

Which I now realize is probably another rule. Splendid.

Our only other point of communication, besides the internet, is Town, about a half hour’s walk away.

Yes, I recognize it’s odd that Town doesn’t have another name, but it’s never been something I’ve cared much about. It isn’t like there’s another town to get it confused with, and there’s no roads leading out of it. When we need supplies, Robert makes the trek in his four-wheeler to who-knows-where to stock the shelves of his general store. 

In all, there’s about eighty of us. Everybody performs various odd jobs to keep town running, but as their *official* careers, most people are either too old to work (like Gran), farmers, or what we refer to as ‘professional hikers.’ Basically, the government pays them to do monthly surveys on plantlife that isn’t common in other places and tag rare wildlife. Apparently, there's an invasive species of cockroaches that’s only found here. Little silver bugs with three eyes that jump out at you if you catch them unawares.

“Never let one touch you,” Gran’s told me before. “If one does, you have to kill it immediately. Under no circumstances let it escape. If it does, tell me, and we’ll go hunting.”

As you might guess, nobody in the Deepwoods is rich, but we make do. We have a general store, a hospital, and a town center that doubles as a classroom when me and the other kids my age(ish) meet up for classes on Tuesday and Thursday.

Once, I asked if we could switch to Monday/Wednesday. Gran and Mrs. Pritchett, the schoolteacher, only looked at each other knowingly.

 “The town center is occupied those days,” Mrs. Pritchett told me.

“But that’s what I’m asking,” I said. “Can’t the youngers meet in the classroom Tuesday and Thursday, and we switch with them?”

“You misunderstand. On Monday and Wednesday, the younger class meets at my house. The town center is *otherwise* occupied, and there’s no room in my living room for the four of you.”

I’d always assumed the youngers met in the same classroom as us on our off days. I knew for a fact nobody else had the town center booked those days. I checked the schedule before I approached Mrs. Pritchett about the switch. Who was using it? 

There’s three other teenagers in class besides me. The closest in age, and probably my best friend, is a girl named Hollis, whose Mom is one of those ‘professional hikers’―but I’m getting off topic. 

That’s Town. And when I went to visit Gran, McKenty was off attending to some other chore like everybody here has a million of.

She was asleep at first. I couldn’t tell if it was normal sleep or something worse, so I shook her arm.

“Gran,” I whispered. “It’s me, Juniper. How are you feeling?”

She didn’t respond. Her I.V. was still in. Everything seemed fine with her monitors, but she wouldn’t wake up. I shook harder. “Gran, the hiker in red is dead.”

“Juniper?”

I breathed out. 

This was the part where I was supposed to hug her. I was supposed to take her hand and tell her she would be alright, that *everything* was alright, and I was happy to see her, and what did she need, could I help her with anything while she felt so frail?

Instead, I glared at her. “What haven’t you been telling me?”

She reached for my hand, but I jerked it back. 

“No Gran. You’ve been hiding things from me for years and years. Who is the hiker in red really, and why did he attack me last night? Why do we tie strings around the trees? Why do you bury our old light bulbs in the yard instead of throwing them out? What is the void sap for?”

Her eyes went wide as if remembering something. “The cabin. Last night. Did you walk ten times around it?”

“Yes,” I snapped. “Well―not exactly, but I’m fine, I think. Gran I just want to know what’s going on.”

She stared at me with her ancient blue eyes. This time, when she reached for my hand, I let her. She squeezed, then sighed and looked away.

“You couldn’t find out,” she said. “It’s worse when you know.”

“I believe you,” I said, “About all of it. But I can’t believe what you won’t tell me.”

She nodded once, and when she opened her mouth, I could tell it was to start explaining. The truth was finally coming…

Her eyes unfocused.

“Wait,” I said. “Come back to me.”

They snapped back open, but she was still tired, drifting off. “I’m not quite…I don’t feel…”

*Not now.* She couldn’t be drifting away now when I was this close.

I know it was wrong, but I pinched her cheek. Hard.

She jerked back to awareness. “Take a jug of sap,” she told me. “The old well near the willow tree. There’s a nest of poppies just at its base. Feed them the sap. Do it tonight, tomorrow at the latest.”

“Why? What for?”

But her eyes were getting dim again. I called her name over and over, but eventually they slid closed and wouldn’t open. “Gran! Please, wake up!”

“She’s not going to,” said a voice at the door.

Doctor McKenty stood there, arms folded and lips pressed tight.

“I need to talk with her,” I said frantically.

“You’re not going to be able.”

“Of course, I will. I just was.”

His brow furrows. “That can’t be right. Juniper, your grandmother is experiencing internal bleeding in the brain.”

She was in a temporary coma, he explained to me. Maybe just for a day or two, maybe longer, but there was no way she could have woken up. It didn’t matter how much I tried to explain she’d just done that very thing, he wouldn’t believe me.

I stayed there all day. 

The only thing that convinced me to go home was the eventual dimming of the sun. I needed to circle the cabin tonight before it got dark. That was one ritual I’d never fail to do again, but what did that mean exactly? Did I have to do it even if I was far away? Could I *never* move away from the Deepwoods? I’d never really considered doing so, but now…

The way home always takes longer than the way to Town. The way there, you can go straight. On the way back you’re supposed to pass by each of the three unmarked gravestones, kneel before each one, and kiss the stone before proceeding onward.

I did that tonight. I just did it running.

The sun was nearly set by the time I reached our cottage. Once again, I performed the ritual at a jog. *One, three, seven, ten* times around the cabin. Inside, I collapsed against the door. I waited there. I stayed against it for nearly an hour before I was sure nothing was coming. 

I’d done things the right way, hadn't I? It was fine. Things would be fine tonight.

I went to bed.

\*\*\*

Gran often has a hard time sleeping. As long as I’ve known her, she tosses and turns like a fish, which is why we stopped sharing a bed as soon as I learned enough words to ask for my own one. When it gets truly bad, she gets up, paces our one room cabin, and takes a seat in the rocking chair. That wakes me usually, hearing her rocking there in the darkness. 

I don’t mind. I *prefer* it even. There’s something deeply comforting about stirring in the comfy darkness and knowing she’s right there, watching over me, because isn’t that how childhood works? Kids are somehow the most comfortable when their parents are the most uncomfortable.

When I woke up that’s what I assumed was happening. Gran was struggling to sleep. She’d already paced, sat down, and now she was rocking in her chair, protecting me.

Little by little, my grogginess left. The shock wasn’t immediate. There was no gasp of realization or jerk of understanding, but slowly, my feeling of safety was replaced by one of dawning horror.

Gran was still unconscious at the hospital.

Who was in her chair?

A single pale beam of moonlight fell across one of the armrests. There was definitely a pair of legs, but besides that I couldn’t make much else out. The only other clear feature was a set of luminescent yellow eyes, higher than Gran’s would have been. They stared away from me,  at some spot in the darkness.

The blankets were bunched up around my face, hiding me almost entirely. Was it possible the thing in the chair didn’t know I was here?

I didn’t breathe.

I didn’t move.

For an eternity―hours it seemed but possibly minutes―we stayed like that: the thing in the chair staring into the distance, me staring at it. It rocked back and forth.

I whimpered.

The sound was so unexpected I didn’t realize it had come from me, but immediately, the two yellow eyes snapped in my direction.

*Stay still. Don’t move. Let it forget―*

The thing stood up. It strolled towards me. When it reached me, it rested one hand over the blanket on my shoulder and leaned down. The pale yellow eyes stared into my own, and bits of wet―well, I don’t know what― brushed against my face. Like strands of hair after a shower or the end of a scarf dripping from recent rain. I expected to inhale sour breath, but it didn’t seem to be breathing at all.

It pulled back. The creature strolled away, until it stood next to the front door. Then it stared at me. Waiting. Waiting.

At first, I couldn’t muster the courage. Finally, I pulled the sheets back, crept towards the thing without ever looking at it directly, and unlocked the front door―the door I’d left locked the entire day.

The thing twisted the doorknob and strolled out into the forest, never once looking back.

\*\*\*

I followed Gran’s instructions first thing in the morning. I took an old jug of void sap from our cellar and made my way to the old well. 

*Nothing happened,* I tried to tell myself. *You dreamed it all. You slept through the entire night.*

Except, of course, I hadn't. The thing had been real. Very much so.  An actual person―or entity or whatever it was called― had been in Gran’s rocking chair, most likely because I’d left it locked inside all day. \*Unlock the door before sunrise―\*that was the rule, but it seemed I should have *left*  it unlocked.

And another thought. If it had sounded just like Gran, then who was the one usually in that chair? Was it Gran like I always assumed, or for my entire life, had that thing taken the occasional turn?

I was still so shaken by the time I got to the well, I nearly dumped the entire jug in. I caught myself. Gran had said to pour it into the poppies at its base, not the actual well.

It’s odd. You’d think with all my grandma’s rules and superstitions, at least one of them would be centered around a creepy old well. None of them were though. *Don’t climb on it,* she told me when I was a little girl, but that was for my safety. Not some ritual.

An odd vertigo filled me. I set the jar on the ledge to steady myself.

When I was younger, Gran would buy herself the occasional box of ginger snaps from the general store, not to share with me, just for herself. Sometimes, I’d discover them around the cabin, but most times, I’d only find an empty box. 

If she would have told me not to eat them, I would have known they were there. I would have searched for them. Instead, she told me nothing at all, simply pretended like they didn’t  exist. The best way to hide her ginger snaps was simply to never talk about them.

I couldn’t remember her ever talking about the well either.

The poppies were just where she said, radiant orange and in full bloom. They formed a perfect circle. I aimed at the center and poured.

For a moment, nothing. The liquid dribbled off the petals and sunk into the dirt. That was the point of these rules after all: for nothing to happen. Even after last night, I didn’t expect it to.

The dirt inside the poppies shifted. Gurgled like water. Fell away. 

A circular mouth opened up on the forest floor.

I kept pouring. A black tongue snaked up from the mouth in the dirt and lapped at the stream of void sap. Double rows of sharpened, carnivorous teeth glistened from the liquid. 

When I was finished, the tongue patted around in the moist dirt. It retracted, and the mouth closed. The soil and poppies shifted back in place like nothing had happened.

It took me an entire minute of gaping, before I could bring myself to cap the jug. 

“What are the mouths?” I rehearsed on my way to Town. “I’m not leaving until you tell me. I have a right to know. I demand for you to explain.”

The entire walk I practiced what to say and how to say it. I even invented some threats and blackmail, though let’s be honest, I was never going to threaten Gran. I needed her to explain, but I didn’t hate her. Not really. She was still my family. I still loved her.

When I got to the hospital, I marched right inside and to her room. 

“Gran―” I began.

Doctor McKenty was leaning over her, pulling a white cloth over her face. He looked up at me. 

“I’m sorry Juniper,” he said. “She’s gone.”

\*\*\*

I sobbed.

There’s no shame in admitting that. Gran was the only family I had. She raised me my entire life, from infancy to now. She took me on prairie walks, and showed me how to catch crawdads, and sang nursery rhymes with me in the meadows. Gran was my entire life.

She was gone.

Doctor McKenty was good to me after that. He took me back to his home and forced me to eat. His wife held my hand for hours and hours as I sobbed, then sniffled, then stared blankly at the wall. It didn’t seem real. It *couldn’t* be real.

“Here,” Mrs. McKenty said, pulling me towards a bed.

“What?” I asked.

“You can sleep here tonight.”

I let her guide me and sit me down. She pulled back the covers for me to climb in and―

“I can’t,” I said. It was nearly dark. Even though I was grieving, I could still make out the time of day.

“Don’t be ridiculous,” she said. “Of course you can stay.”

“I can’t,” I repeated, and before she could protest, before she could say another word, I bolted from their home.

I had to get back. I had to do the ritual.

I didn’t bother passing the unmarked gravestones. There was no time, and better to stop the devil you know will kill you then the one you don’t. How much time did I have before the light was gone completely? I hadn't even looked at a clock before I left.

The cabin came into view. I flung myself at it. I hadn't even completed the first rotation when a shape emerged from the front entryway and screeched.

“June bug! You startled me.” Gran clutched her chest, pressed against the doorway. “What took you so long? Come in, come in. Dinner’s ready.”

I didn’t move.

“Juniper?” she asked, her face―the face I’d looked at every day for seventeen years― a mask of concern. “What’s wrong? It’s time to come in.”

“The cabin,” I choked out. “We haven’t walked around it.”

She pressed her hand to her forehead. “Silly me. It slipped my mind.”

She took my arm, and we began the first rotation.

\*\*\*

I live with my grandmother in a cabin in the Deepwood forest. We’ve lived here my entire life, her and me. That’s the way it’s always been and how it always will be.

*It’s worse when you know.*

That’s what Gran told me. The things going on in the woods get worse when you know about them, and I’ve already seen that’s true in the last few days. More and more is happening, and eventually, I’m going to slip up beyond repair.

So I don’t know.

Gran never got hit in the head by a branch. 

She was never in the hospital, and the thing I now live with is her.

Gran is fine. [Totally fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/).
