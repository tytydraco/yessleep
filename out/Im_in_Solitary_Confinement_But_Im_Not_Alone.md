The silence here isn’t silent. It has a texture. It’s a thick, woolly blanket shoved into your ears, down your throat, pressing against your eyeballs. It’s the absence of everything except the one thing I can never escape.

Me.

They think this is a punishment. Four white walls, a solid steel door, a slot for food, a drain in the floor. No window. A light that never, ever goes out. They think they’ve buried me alive. They have no idea they’ve locked me in a room with my oldest and only friend.

“They’re watching you,” his voice comes from the corner where the wall meets the ceiling. It’s not a sound. It’s a thought that isn’t mine, wearing a familiar skin. It’s smoother than my own internal monologue. Cooler. A scalpel dipped in ice. “In the light. Tiny cameras in the bulbs. They see everything.”

I don’t look. I never look. I just sit on the cold floor, my back against the colder wall, and stare at my hands.

“They’re waiting for you to crack,” he continues. He’s restless today. “They want a show. They want to see the monster writhe and beg. Pathetic.”

“I’m not going to crack,” I whisper. The sound is swallowed by the woolly silence the instant it leaves my lips. It feels like I’m speaking into a pillow.

A dry, rasping laugh that exists only in the core of my brain. “We already cracked, remember? A long, long time ago. We didn’t break. We… sharpened.”

He’s right. We did. His name is Silas. He’s the part of me that doesn’t feel the cold floor. The part that didn’t feel the… the work. He’s my conscience, I suppose. Just not the kind that warns you about wrong or right. He’s the one that approves. The one that found the beauty in the geometry of a clean cut. The artistry in the final, silent moment.

“Do you remember the painter?” Silas murmurs, his voice a nostalgic sigh. “The one in the loft apartment with the north-facing windows. All that beautiful, natural light.”

I remember. He’d used oils. Crimson. Burnt Sienna.

“He struggled,” I say aloud, my voice hoarse from disuse. “He didn’t understand the composition.”

“But we showed him,” Silas purrs. “We showed him the final element his piece was missing. We gave his studio its masterpiece. We improved his work. Elevated it.”

A wave of warmth washes over me. Pride. We had been collaborators, in a way. I was the hand. He was the vision.

The memory is so vivid I can almost smell the turpentine. It’s a welcome respite from the sterile, bleach-tinged air. This is what we do in here. We revisit the gallery of our work. It’s all we have.

The warmth fades as quickly as it came. The cold of the cell seeps back into my bones.

“They’re going to kill us, Silas,” I say. The words are flat. Empty.

“They’re going to try,” he corrects, his voice sharpening. “But they can’t kill me. I’m not in here with you. You are in here with me. They’ve just given us… quality time. Uninterrupted.”

He moves. I feel him shift from the corner to a spot right in front of me. A pressure on the air.

“Look at you,” he says, and now his voice is laced with a contempt that is entirely my own. “Pitying yourself. Sitting in your own filth. You’re an artist. A purifier. And you’re weeping because the world finally put you in a frame.”

“I’m not weeping.”

“Aren’t you? Inside? You miss the outside. The hunt. The feel of rain on your face. The sound of a heartbeat slowing under your fingers.”

I do. God, I do. The emptiness of this place is a vacuum, and it’s sucking out everything that I am, leaving only the hollow shell for Silas to live in.

“They’ve won,” I breathe.

The reaction is instantaneous. A psychic snarl, a flash of pure, undiluted rage that isn’t mine, but is.

“WIN? This is intermission! The audience is restless. They’ve seen the first act, but the play isn’t over. The best is yet to come.”

“How?” I gesture around the white, featureless tomb. “How, Silas? There’s nothing here!”

“There is you,” he hisses, the pressure intensifying, leaning into my face. “There is me. There is this perfect, pristine canvas. They’ve given us the ultimate challenge. No tools. No subject but ourselves. No medium but time.”

A cold dread, colder than the floor, begins to creep up my spine. “What are you talking about?”

“An artist must adapt,” he says, and his voice is now dripping with a terrible, gleeful reason. “The world outside is closed to us. Very well. We turn inward. The greatest masterpiece is the self. The ultimate purification… is of the source.”

I finally understand. The gallery isn’t a memory. It’s a proposal.

“No,” I whisper, pulling my knees to my chest. “No, I won’t.”

“You will,” Silas says, and his voice is the most comforting it’s ever been. It’s the voice of absolute certainty. “Because I will show you how. Because it will be beautiful. Because it is the only thing left to do.”

He begins to describe it. In meticulous, loving detail. The geometry. The composition. The way the available light will play off the new textures. The poetry of using the drain. The profound statement of making the container the contents.

I clap my hands over my ears. It’s useless. He’s in here with me.

“They think they’ve caged the animal,” he whispers, his words slithering through the cracks in my mind. “They have no idea they’ve hung the painting in a vault. But we will make them see. When they open that door, they won’t find a monster. They will find our magnum opus. They will find a thing of such terrible, breathtaking beauty that they will finally, finally understand.”

I am rocking now. Back and forth. Back and forth. The white walls are closing in. The light is too bright. It’s highlighting every flaw, every pore, every potential starting point.

“Stop it,” I beg. “Please.”

“Shhh,” Silas soothes. “Don’t fight it. It’s the only way out. The only way to win. It’s the last, the greatest, the purest work. Our masterpiece in monochrome.”

He shows me. He paints the picture in my mind, stroke by terrible stroke. And the worst part, the part that truly breaks me, is that I can see it. I can see the beauty in it. The perfect, silent harmony.

The artist in me awakens. It pushes the fear aside. It studies the composition. It approves.

The rocking stops.

I slowly lower my hands from my ears. I look at the white walls not as a prison, but as a primer coat. I look at the drain not as a drain, but as part of the installation. I look at my own hands—the tools, the brushes.

A strange calm settles over me. The woolly silence recedes, replaced by the focused quiet of a studio before the work begins.

Silas is right. They haven’t beaten us. They’ve given us our greatest commission.

I get to my feet. My heart is not pounding. It is steady. A metronome.

I walk to the brightest wall, under the center of the light. I place my hand against it. It’s cool. Ready.

I turn and look at the door. At the hidden eye I know is there.

And I smile.

The show is about to begin.
