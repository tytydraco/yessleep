My family and I recently moved from California to Alabama. The transition has been exciting to say the least. Finding new jobs, getting the kids into school, learning all the roads of a new town. Driving to some of the most basic locations, feels like an adventure being in this new area. Being born and raised in California and parting ways after 35 years, Alabama feels like an entirely different country.

Finding a job wasn't too difficult. I stuck to the field i had worked in California and took a quality control position at a roofing manufacturer. It took me about 35-40 minutes to get to work, depending on traffic. That may not seem like a very long commute to some, but since I only lived about 10 minuntes away from my previous job, I wasn't entirely fond of the idea of spending an hour and twenty minutes or so in the car everyday. 

When I found the short cut through a local wooded area, I was ecstatic. It ended up shaving about 10 minutes off my drive both to and from work. Gotta love technology and what you can figure out just looking at a satellite image on Google maps.

I'd been in training at my new job for about the past 3 months, working the morning shift from 7am to 3pm. Knowing the entire time I'd eventually be moved to 2nd shift, 3pm to 11pm. I wasn't entirely fond of the idea of working those hours and coming home that late, but I already got along with that crew working those hours. Hopefully that will help smooth the transition.

Driving to and from work everyday, I'd always take the same uneventful route. The short cut marked the halfway point between work and my house. If I was ever annoyed about my drive to work, I'd remind myself of much longer the commute could take if I hadn't found this path. I'm pretty sure I'm the only one that drives down this dirt road, I've yet to see another vehicle on it.

Its the first day I'll be working my new shift schedule. Monday afternoon, It had been pretty dreary all morning, raining off and on, and i was exhausted, didn't sleep much, its not easy changing up your sleep times. I stopped at the gas station as I do every Monday, filled up the truck and grabbed myself an energy drink. figured it would be a long night and that I'd need it. This shifts going to take some getting used to, a bit of liquid crack ought to get me through.

This evening was just like working 1st shift. It was pretty normal and uneventful, but nice to be able to listen to some music, since we didnt have any management breathing down our necks. We finished up for the night, greeted the night shift and headed home. 

I enjoyed driving at this time of night. Most the stores around town closed at eleven, so there were hardly any cars on the road. I must of had a stint of highway hypnosis on my way home, it felt like I had just started driving and already I was at the point to make my turn, into the woods, onto the short cut.

I never gave much thought to the short cut for past 3 months, beside the fact that it saved me time. It had just become part of my daily routine. This was the first time I took the narrow dirt path home at night. Seeing it at night, there was something different about it. Almost life like.

I felt a chill run down my spine. I hadn't thought about how creepy it might appear at night. All the over grown trees and bushes blocked out most of the already bleak moonlight, it had been overcast all day. 

The path was extremely narrow, only enough room for one vehicle. The bushes on either side, often tapped against the driver and passenger side mirrors. I started to feel uneasy, claustrophobic. After a few minutes I thought to myself. "How long have I been on this road? It usually only takes a couple minutes to cut through this forest. Why does it feel like it's been longer?" It takes me approximately 10-15 minutes to get to the short cut, depending on traffic and there wasn'tany traffic tonight. I looked at clock on the radio. 11:18 "That can't be right." I thought.

As all the thoughts were tumbling through my mind I came to a large clearing and slowed to a stop. I've never seen this. Did I turn on the right road. I've been taking it for the past 3 months? My thoughts shattered by a sound. Crying... a baby... crying. I froze, cracked my windows slightly and listened. There it was again! This time louder. "How could there possibly be a infant out here innthe middle of these woods. I was concerned and terrified, at the same time. It seemed to be about 20 yards away from the passenger side of the truck, just inside the tree line, and it was wither getting louder, or it was getting closer. 

I reached for my flashlight in my driver side door, shinning it at my passenger side window,  doing nothing except blinding temporarily blinding myself with the reflection. I immediately turned it off, cursing at my own stupidity. I rolled the window down a little more, slide across the bench seat to the passenger side and pointed the flashlight out the window. I panned back and forth with the light, scanning the tree line for the source of the sounds. Nothing. I turned off my light and waited. After a few moments, I slowly slide back to the driver side, trying to make as little noise as possible, straining my ears, listening with bated breathe. I sat motionless. I was about to put my truck into drive when I heard a loud thud and I caught movement out of the corner of my eye, and more crying coming from that same direction. I threw the truck into drive and took off down the dirt path. I changed my mind! I no longer wanted to stick around and find what was making that noise.

Not a minute later the yellow light on the dash caught my eye. My gas light. "There's no way, I just got gas before work!" It had the be a fault with a fuse, a sensor, something. My fuel gauge is on empty, my gas light is on. "How is that possible!"

I continued on, frantic to see the end of this dirt path. Suddenly, the engine sputtered a few times, then died. The gauge was correct. I rolled to a stop in a clearing slightly smaller than the last one, and caught the strong aroma of gas. How is that possible? Is there a hole in my tank? I don't think I hit anything, I've been this away almost a hundred times. The next thought shook me to my core. When caught a glimpse of whatever that was, was it coming from underneath the truck? I started to panick, my eyes darting back and forth. I focused ahead and turned on my highbeams. No end in sight. 

I reached for my cell phone. I had to get a hold of my wife, there was no way in hell I was going to walk, not with whoever is out there. It's not ringing. I have service, but it's not ringing. I tried a dozen or so more times. I restarted my phone in hopes that might fix it. Still nothing, then I heard it again, the crying. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I looked around frantic. There it was, the source of the cries, down on all fours, I could barely make it out in the dismal light that barely escaped the canopy above. It was a massive, hulking beast. I see it and it sees me. The noise it let out next was almost indescribable. It began as a cry, and then turned into a deep, guttural roar. I scrambled for the handgun under my seat, tying not to take my eyes off the beast. It tore off into the tree line out of site. I held my gun tightly in my right hand, flash light in my left and waited. I certainly couldn't sit here all night. What the hell was that thing. I tried to listen for movement or see if I could hear that cry again. Nothing but my rapid heart beat. I had to get out of here, but how!? It felt impossible to think, my thoughts clouded and disturbed by what I'd seen. 

I had no idea where that creature was, but he knows where I am. I need to draw it out. I disabled my dome light and as quick as possible, unlocked my door,  opened it, slammed it, then locked it. 

As soon as the door slammed I heard something scrambling through the trees and bushes on the left side of my truck. A shrill, excited, wail rang out and something slammed into my driver door. I could see the top of its head out the driver side window. Then it stood up. It had sunken, red, lifeless eyes, and foaming drool dripping from what appeared to be tusks, like a wild bore. It's skin, deep blood red and meaty, like there was no epidermal layers, just exposed muscle and tendons. I screamed and slide frantically across the bench seat to the passenger side as it reared back and slammed it's face into the glass, shattering it, sending bits of glass into my face, slicing just below my right eye. I fired a panicked shot and it let out a deafening shriek. I couldn't tell where I shot it but I think I wounded it! Now was my chance, it was now or never. I wasn't going to let this thing cart me off into these God forsaken woods. I fumbled for the lock on the passenger door and swung it open. I bolted. Never ran so fast before in my life, or been more terrified. I headed back down the path from the direction I had came, in hopes of getting back to the road i had turned in on because the direction forward seemed never-ending.

There was something odd about this path, theres no way it was my usual route. I had to get back to the road and away from whatever the hell that nightmare was that I'd disturbed. I could feel the warm blood running down my cheek. I attempted to wipe it with my over shirt clumsily, gun in one hand, flashlight in the other. 

A thunderous, piercing roar rang out behind me, and the sound of it's claws ripping up the dirt path as it attempted to gain traction and pursue its prey. I was it's prey, and I could hear the excitement as it whimpered wildly like a rabid dog. I struggled to rip off my over shirt and tossed it into the air, in hopes it would distract it. I didn't dare stop running, even for a moment. I glanced back and saw the beast skid to a hault just as my shirt landed in front of him, grabbing it in his jaws and ripping it with his claws effortlessly into shreds. It had bought me a little bit more time. I turned off the flashlight in hopes that the beast would loose site of me and continued running.

I couldn't hear it pursuing but continued running. I'd been running for what felt like forever when I could finally just make out the paved road I had came from. Just as I had started to feel some shred of relief, there it was. The creature. Standing up right on its hind legs. It had to be at least seven feet tall and it was standing in the middle of the path between me and the road. Arms out stretched, ready to attack. All I could think about was getting back to my wife and my kids, and my body went into flight or fight. I continued sprinting straight at it. As it squatted down getting ready to pounce, I aimed my gun and started unloading round after round at it. Until the entire magazine was empty. I could hear squelching thuds as the bullets met their mark. The beast shrieked in pain and fled into the trees. I continued sprinting forward towards the road, towards hope of seeing my family again. 

My shoes hit the hard pavement, I didn't stop. I ran out into the middle of road.  Luckily the car that was driving by saw me, otherwise I probably would have been ran over. They layed on the horn and pulled up along side me. 

"John?" The drive shouted. "What the hell are you doing out here?!" It was our neighbor Darrell. I told him I need a ride and ran around to the passenger side. I was about to explain what had happened, but before I could say a word he put his index finger to his lips and pointed towards the back seat. I turned around to see his daughter, passed out in her car seat. He quietly explained how she has been teething and they're having hard time getting her to sleep, so he was driving her around to see if that would do the trick. I nodded and thanked him quietly and told him I'd explain what happened later and that I just wanted to get home. He smiled and nodded back. I looked back towards the dirt road, no sign of the beast. Studying the area I knew, that was the way I always take. 

As he pulled up into my driveway, I thanked him again and proceeded to head inside.
I expected to see my wife up and waiting for me on the porch, wondering where I had been. She must have fallen asleep. I got inside the house, it was quiet. I made my way to the bedroom. To my surprise, the light was on but my wife wasn't in bed. I looked around the room and proceeded called for her. Something on my pillow caught my eye. It was a note: "John, got worried you're not home yet. Tried your phone several times, but it wouldn't ring. Went to find you. Don't like the idea of driving through the woods at night but I'm going to check the short cut." 

I narrated a video if you'd like to watch it:
