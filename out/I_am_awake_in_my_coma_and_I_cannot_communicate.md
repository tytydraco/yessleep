I can’t move and my family thinks I am in a coma.

To clear things up, I have been pretty prone to seizures my entire life, so it came as no surprise to my family when I had a seizure and did not move a muscle after I stopped convulsing. After a panic attack on my poor mothers part, she called an ambulance to attempt to wake me up from my “coma”. 


While I was being driven to the hospital, in the back of the ambulance through the two windows in the back, I saw something. The lighting from out of the sky lit up the face of a man in robes staring at me through the windows as we passed a stop sign. The face of the man was comforting, and made me feel safer in my situation.


As I arrived to the hospital I was immediately put on a bed and the doctors said I was in a coma and I would not wake up in two to three years. For five years, I lye in bed fully aware of my situation left with nothing but my thoughts. Some nights I would see the man I saw behind the ambulance in the corner of my room, although something was different about him each time. Sometimes he was motionless, while other times he would pace around the room with a clomping sound, as if he had horse hooves. Sometimes he would have a distorted face, slightly misshapen to the point he looked uncanny. What never changed about the man was the robes he was wearing, a white gown with a red bandolier like cloth draped over his shoulder. 


Eventually, my mother brought a Christian priest to my bed, even though we are Buddhist, presumably as a last hope. The priest poured holy water onto me, and prayed over my bed attempting to ward demons off that cursed me. Eventually the visits of the man stopped, and instead I would hear a constant ringing and choir in my ears at all times. 


One night, I was met by one thousand eyes at the foot of my bed, telling me  I was ready for the transition. The eyes told me not to be afraid and that I was born for a noble cause. The eyes told me I was a vessel for the second coming of Jesus Christ. Three nights after the eyes visited, I suddenly gained the ability to walk again. The man in the robes approached me, and told me to fulfill my duty. 


Doing so, I walked out of my room to the operation room where an active surgery took place. I grabbed the doctors scalpel and stabbed my wrists, letting my blood drain into the patients chest. The patients wounds were mended instantly. I walked through every room in the hospital taking the same course of action until finally finding my vessel in the recovery room, to where I transitioned myself into a mortal being, and starting the cleansing of earth.
