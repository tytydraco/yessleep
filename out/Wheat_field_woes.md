For about 4 months there's been very strange people roaming around near my property, sometimes just straight-up on it. Why don't I just shoot first and ask questions later? Because quite frankly, i'm a coward. And I don't know what these people are doing around these rural parts at 4AM some nights. For context, the first time we noticed these trespassers, I was tending to my horses when my wife Liz said "who the fuck is that?'' pointing about a half-mile down the property, where the big ol' irrigation sprinklers are in the field. What we see is two figures, who from what I saw, were walking southward in an impossible looking way that made it look like they were gliding, rather than walking. As if these people had a hoverboard that somehow could tread poor soil and wheat crops. Smooth movements while one had it's arms up in the air like someone on a rollercoaster, and their arms looked weirdly long and skinny. The other figure trailing it just kept bobbing their head up and down very violently while somehow keeping a perfectly straight travel path. I don't know. Drugs? Probably. We decided to just let it pass for now, as stories around here of wandering crackheads in the country isn't exactly unheard of.

Fast forward a couple of weeks, i'm at the local minimart for a pack of smokes and some questionable hot-case food, (I know, i'm the image of health.) and I see a newspaper on my way out. It reads: "DOUGLAS COUNTY SHERRIF ON HIGH ALERT, AS NEW REPORTS OF 'CULT ACTIVITY' GROW IN RECENT WEEKS." 

I did a double take. That makes the most sense for what we witnessed I guess, some methed-up cultists roaming around the Looking Glass area of rural oregon doing... God knows what?  Read a few stories of other farmers seeing strange people in the distance moving in strange ways, some movements being described as "impossibly fluid". Aha! That's it. Simply having a slightly better understanding of the situation made me more comfortable with investigating it. Fear of the unknown and all, i'd rather invesitigate it if someone got to it first with a story. Again, coward. So now that I knew what it was, I went to the area that the people were when we first saw them a few weeks ago. Approaching the irrigation sprinklers from about 40 feet away I noticed a red shirt just thrown over the top of it (it's one of those very long, large irrigation sprinklers.) As I got closer and was talking to myself about how annoying it is to have to deal with culty tweakers here when I thought we'd be isolated enough, I came to see that the red shirt was in fact a flayed mass of flesh thrown over the sprinkler. Liz audibly gasps while i'm trying to process what i'm even seeing. I think I was too shocked to properly react. I mean, for one, where the fuck did it come from? I was worried that they might have assaulted one of our animals, but upon checking on all of them, each and every one was perfectly fine. And my second thought, why? Why trespass onto someones property just to throw some meat on the sprinkler? I had to climb up it a bit to get it down, and when I did I could tell that it was a very fresh cut some some kind of meat. At this point, I began to get more comfortable with the idea of using my gun.

"Might as well go in the woods where they went, see if they left any shit for us to clean up" I said with about 20% confidence and 80% uncertain anxiety. Thanfully this didn't last long as the footprints we followed led to a thick wall of trees and bushes that were absolutley impenetrable without some kind of cutting tool. My relief was quickly overshadowed with confusion as I thought about the logistics of the footprints meeting a wall of vegetation, and suddenly dissapearing. Did... they just power through it? Or take a different path that the prints don't show? I went to turn away before getting a nasty lock of hair in my mouth that was caught on a branch. Disgusted, I pulled it out of my mouth making that "pth pth" spitting sound trying to get it out. I looked at the branches closer and realized that lots of them had locks of hair stuck on them, as if someone just walked through, kept getting their head snagged on branches, but just kept walking while essentially scalping themselves. "Jesus Christ" I said, "how determined must you be to just tread through thick woods, literally pulling your hair out in the proccess and just keep walking?" Liz simply shrugged with shaking arms and wide eyes. I spread the wall of thick growth with my hand and sure enough, what I thought was a thick wall was actually the path these people took, but the branches slowly readjusted themselves. I spread them and could see a nest of hair and blood that dissapeared southward into the areas my arms could not reach. These people just walked straight into the thickest area of the woods and I just couldn't understand it, and I truly didn't want to anymore, We went home, and I poured myself a tall glass of whiskey in the hopes that i'd find some kind of dark humor in this while drunk, it didn't work.

The sightings of these "cultists" continued for a while on the other people's property near mine. The guy I get my horses from was telling me about a group of people he saw dancing at night in his wheat feild. I met up with him for a smoke and asked "so what do you think they do exactly? Animal sacrifice? Murder? Why do they move so weird?"  He just sort of half-laughed before his smile quickly faded, slowly turning and looking at the half-smoked cigarette in his fingers, he said "I want you to imagine this." I got closer and raised an eyebrow. "One of em' fuckers is walking ahead of the rest of the group right? Walkin' in a way that was smoother than butter. I'm gettin' my rifle ready for a warning shot when the motherfucker bends down, not with their knees, but with their head, shoulders, and back goin' between their legs and somehow went back around the fuckn' top like their hips were a fulcrum. Absolute insanity to see. And the thing is, I realize every time we see these things there's more of em' then there was last time. That's about when I called the sherrif for the 4th time. I didn't know what to say. Just the same cult story that's been goin' 'round. He don't wanna hear it no more."

I didn't really know how to proccess what i'd just heard. Someone walking, and then their upper body spins around between their legs and they keep walking? At this point i'm wondering if there's something in the water making us all hallucinate and come up with crazy shit, but in my heart it wasn't true and I knew it. But at the same time I don't know what's true, even still. The sightings are always sparse, like these things have a schedule. The last one was just last month. Same location, same time as the sprinkler incident. This time I have my gun ready with the intention of using it if I have to. There's enough of a pattern here that i'm no longer worried about accidentally shooting someone who's say, lost and in need of help or something. I always worry about shooting someone who didn't deserve it even if they are tresspassing (coward).

Sitting on the hay bail in the barn, I kept a close eye on the figures with my rifle. At first there were two. Gliding along the feild in what appeared to be very badly torn and ripped clothing, the face almost too dark to see even in the fair light, save for a single eye that glowed a dim whitish-grey. The figure trailing it had it's arms outstretched to the sky, again, impossibly long and skinny arms. Upon seeing all of this in such fast succession I was overcome by a wave of nausea and extreme dread that penetrated my very soul, I felt it in my bones. I gathered up the courage to look through my scope again. I thought i'd lost them, but upon finding them again I saw there were an additional four figures behind them now. They were all tearing eachother apart while traveling south.  I swallowed twice, as my throat was far too tight to let the first one down. I see them by the irrigation sprinkler, and as they're moving one would drag another close to their face, pull them in, and repeatedly headbutt them until I saw a mist of flesh and bone exploding out of this horrible, God-forsaken scene. They did not seem to be mortally damaged by this, as the sight that made me run home was the hanging, bloody, hollowed pulp of a skull still attatched to the body happily dancing and walking through the feild, coming closer to me. Somewhere along my brilliant line of planning, I failed to realize the hay barn was along the same southward path as the first sighting, with the hair in the branches. I went quietly out the back door not wanting to take any chances.

Following these events, I have become much more socially withdrawn, and my wife Liz chose to no longer look into or investigate this with me, it made her too uncomfortable and I don't blame her. I just don't have anyone to talk to about this. Unless I want to talk to the local newspaper, cause that's the only place where i'm seeing people talk about this. Because I do want to talk about it, but every time I try to, my mind either doesn't or won't let me comprehend what we witnessed. This was espescially present upon reading the most recent issue of the paper that mentioned these sightings. Looking for some vailidation and trying to ignore the primal fear in me, I went in reading. The article mentioned the usual strangeness, strange movements, ritualistic appearance, and odd bodily proportions from eyewitness accounts. At this point I couldn't bother to eat from the low-level panic i've been feeling since this started. That feeling multiplied when I read in the paper:

"LOOKING GLASS RESIDENTS ON HIGH ALERT AS BODY OF 43Y/O DALE DONAHUE FOUND ON SOUTHWARD TRAIL, TRESPASSERS CAPTURED ON CAMERA BEFORE DONAHUE WAS FOUND BRUTALLY MURDERED, ONLY IDENTIFIABLE BY DENTAL RECORDS. IF ANYONE CAN IDENTIFY THE SUSPECTS PLEASE CONTACT DOUGLAS COUNTY SHERRIF'S DEPARTMENT."

This was the photograph that this Donahue guy managed to capture before being killed. I plan on relocating, moving as far North as I possibly can.

Anywhere but south.
