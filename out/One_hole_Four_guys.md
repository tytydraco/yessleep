Me and my three buddies Jeff Mark Buck had an unusual hobby. We would dig tunnels underground for fun! To this day I still do know how it started. But my best guess was we were dared to do this at our local pub!  
  
But that’s not important. What is important is that I stopped. And here's why! So, this all started back in June a year ago! My buddy Mark suggested to use “hay guys since we have a day off of work you guys want to have a barbie in our oldest and biggest hole.”  
  
Buck and I said “bloody oath that sounds awesome”! Jeff on the other hand said “I don’t know won't the fumes bloody kill us”! Jeff said reassuringly “don’t worry I bought us one of those smokeless fire pits”.  
  
So, with that reassurance we drove our pick-up truck to our hole out in the outback! We had a hard time finding it because of how long ago we had been there and that it was almost night. Even with our flashlights we couldn't find this bloody hole! But we Buck accidentally found it. Because he literally fell into it! But we all were having a laugh at Buck until he said “um mate’s there seems to be claw marks in the hole”!   
  
We were all taken aback by this, but Mark asked, “are they old claw marks”? Buck said “yeah from how it appears they are 10 years old”! Mark told use “Well since they are 10 years old, I think the Bloody thing is gone”!   
  
So, with that bit of reassurance, we jumped inside! But I noticed that the claw marks seemed to be only going in. but we nonetheless went as far in as we were willing to carry the fucking smokeless firepit! And so, we wouldn’t get lost we left a trail of string. As when Buck and Mark got tired of carrying the bloody thing, we set it down and started the barbie!  
  
While we were grilling burgers and hotdogs, we heard rocks falling down in the direction we came in. We thought at the time that we should have maintained this hole better. And after a few more hours we heard some rocks being moved around!  
  
We were kind of rethinking this whole barbie at this point! It got to a point where Buck said “aw fuck this I’m done with this hole Barbie I’m going bloody home”! So, Buck took his flashlight and walked down the tunnel to where the exit was.   
  
But for some reason we all stayed and drank some more beers! And after a few more hours and hotdogs and burgers he decided to head back up to the surface! As we were walking, we reached a dead end in an area that it shouldn’t be!   
  
And Jeff said “um guys why is there a wall right there”. We could not answer! And then we decided to take another way to get back to the surface! And as we were walking, we could hear more rocks moving!   
  
I can't tell why but we knew that this was probably not just because of us barely maintaining the hole! We honestly believe that some creature was in the hole with us! I still don’t know what creature it was!  
  
And after what appeared to be an hour, we found Buck's flashlight. We never found the rest of Buck! At that point we probably realized that there definitely was something in the hole with us! So, we started running through the tunnels trying to find some way out!   
  
And then at some point in the paranoia we dropped the smokeless fire pit. Because the tunnels were now smoking up making it hard to breath! And Mark said “guys I'm going to have to find the smokeless fire pit”! I said “dude, are you fucking stupid”!   
  
Mark said “we can’t breathe, I need to stop the smoke” and so Mark ran down the tunnels never to be seen again but the smoke did stop flooding! But it was on top of the tunnel still, so we had to crawl for the remaining search!  
  
As we kept crawling, we could hear more rocks falling! And at one point I think we heard what sounded like a boulder being thrown at a wall! And after a few more hours we could hear the sound of rocks moving towards us!  
  
And as we were crawling as fast as we could, Jeff suddenly screamed! I turned around and saw a wall of rocks in front of me. I don’t know how but somehow; I saw a sliver of light between the gaps of a wall of rocks!  
  
So, I started detaching the rocks and saw the exit of our hole! Although I was too big to fit, I knew I could get out if I kept detaching the rocks. But I must have alerted the beast. because I heard some rocks being moved and thrown coming towards my direction! So, without a time to spare I was ripping the rocks out of their spots!  
  
And fortunately, I got out of the hole before the beast could touch me! And I started running towards the pick-up truck! I will not lie, I am not the fastest runner but with the fear of being caught by what was in the hole, I was an Olympian!  
  
 And when I got into the truck, I breathed a sigh of relief. And then I saw from the trucks mirror the fucking smokeless fire pit get shot out of the hole and crash into the pick-up truck! After I got out of the Outback and calmed down! I realized that people are going to question where my mates are!  
  
And because I knew nobody would believe me when I say that a monster in the hole took them. And if they did believe me, they would become prey to the beast inside of the hole! So, I drove around and covered the hole up with a large rock!  
  
And to make sure nobody goes searching I would crash the pick-up truck into a nearby lake. So, I could say that we crashed into a lake, and I was the only one of my mates who made it! I will be honest it was tough not to come clean at the funeral because I could see Buck's wife and daughter crying!  
  
And even a year later I still haven't come clean! And since I could be anonymous here. I could finally get this off my chest! So, there you go, that's why I stopped digging holes. Because who knows what's under our feet!
