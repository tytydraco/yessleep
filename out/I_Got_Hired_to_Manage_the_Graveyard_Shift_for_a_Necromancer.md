1.) Ensure all daytime staff exit by 8pm

2.) Do not step outside after 8pm. You will cease to exist

3.) Make sure all nighttime staff are on task

4.) Give nighttime staff breaks

5.) (This one was illegible, just a series of scribbles that might have been words? The symbols might as well have been dancing)

6.) Do not get bitten

7.) Do not die. Your contract would be terminated and your eternity would begin

8.) Do not attempt to connect to any networks. They are not safe

9.) Do not sever your mark. Your life will be forfeit

10.) Do not order anything to have free will

11.) Do not feed the shredder

12.) Do not give the coffee maker any ideas. You will regret it

13.) Check the camera feeds regularly to manage the staff

I got a new job recently, and all in all, it's a pretty solid deal. I manage the graveyard shift at a few sites, but the most frequent is at a big office building. 

Aside from the sentient shredder and chaotic evil coffee maker, it was pretty straightforward. Sure, the building doesn't technically exist overnight, but the pay is incredible and the employees are… something else.

I didn't quite know what to make of the cryptic instructions laid out for me, but I was committed to making this job work. The hazard pay alone meant I could retire in my early forties, and how bad could helping some crazy so-called necromancer be? How was I supposed to know the job really meant it?

My first shift was about what you'd expect. I sat down in the security room, with the list of instructions. First and foremost, I had to monitor the building as the daytime employees exited. The moment the clock struck 8pm, the external camera feeds all fell to static. I checked my instructions, unsure of whether to really accept that this would happen. They claimed it would, but it was still alarming.

I swapped the feed to the time clock, then did a double take. The floorboards were shaking fiercely. I braced for an earthquake, but it never came. Then the floorboards began to crack, then they shattered. Desiccated arms reached upwards, grasping at the edges of the holes they'd made.

Then they pulled themselves upward. 

My rationality swooped in, assuring me it was some special effects or a prerecorded film, or something. There was no way the undead were loose in the building. Right? RIGHT?!

I grit my teeth as my survival instincts fought my legs. I committed myself to seeing the basement for myself. I made my way down the ungodly amount of steps (the elevator was out of service), stopping on the first floor to peer outside. A wide, empty expanse lay beyond the doors. I tried pushing them open, but they wouldn't budge. I tried unlocking it, but the keyhole was missing. It wasn't covered, it seemed to have vanished altogether. 

Down the last flight of stairs, and I came to a door. This one was different from all the others. It was built from scrap wood, appearing closer to a flattened wine barrel than a door in an office building.

Through a crack between the boards, I peered into the basement. Then I turned around and ran. Up the steps, all the way back to the security room. I didn't know it was possible to climb twenty some odd flights of steps that quickly. I dove into the room and slammed the door behind me. I pushed a filing cabinet in front of the door, then fell to my knees.

I wasn't out of shape, per se, but the adrenaline was quickly flushing out, leaving me sore and regretting many life choices. My main regret at that moment was taking this godforsaken job. I crawled over to the monitors, barely managing to pull myself back into the rolling chair.

I cycled through the cameras until I located them. I checked the corner of the screen to see the floor number. They had already climbed to floor seven. They would soon be upon me.

I tried dialing 911, but there was no service. Not even a network capable of emergency calls. Hopelessness crept in as I began accepting my fate. My last lifeline was the list of instructions. Watch everyone exit before 8pm. Do not go outside. Greet your staff. Send your staff on their breaks… the list continued, but was incredibly useless. I had half a mind to rip the paper to shreds, but I figured it was useless, so why bother. I tried dialing the police again and again, until a knocking began on the other side of the door.

I tried to ignore it. I tried staying calm as the knocking continued. Every twenty seconds, like clockwork, a single bang reverberated through the steel door. I hadn't cycled the cameras to follow the group's ascent, instead hiding underneath the desk.

Five minutes in, and fifteen knocks later, something changed. “Buh-ah-sss” a raspy voice hissed. Great, I went and lost my mind. “Wha-tuh isss ow-er jah-buh to-nigh-tuh?”

Tears began streaming down my face as I shivered. The voice was dry and gravely. As if it were forced over frayed vocal cords. “Ju-just leave me be!” I cried, pulling the chair closer in a futile attempt to protect myself.

I heard muffled shifting, then silence, on the other side of the door. Some time passed, and I slowly inched out from below the desk. The silence remained, so I scrolled through the cameras, finding the one just outside the security room. 

There they were. All fifty or so of them, lounging around patiently. The one closest to the door leaned against it, its one good eye staring directly into the camera. Something inside of me, maybe morbid curiosity, stirred. “Wave to the camera,” I called, loud enough for the things in the hall to hear me. All at once, fifty half decayed hands waved.

“Buh-ah-sss, pu-lee-suh give usss orr-dursss,” the one eyed ghoul called through the door, after turning to face it. For some reason, I tried it. “You, in the corner,” I started, using the microphone. The zombie I addressed pushed itself upright, although one leg was mostly bone. “Please go empty the garbage in the cubicles. Floor two.”

The zombie saluted, then marched out of view. I cycled backwards, watching the thing march down a flight of stairs. It then pushed a wheeled gray trash bin, reaching below each desk and dumping the contents into the gray bin. Once the bin was full, the undead paused, staring up at the camera, expectantly.

“Grab another bin, and continue,” I instructed, slightly annoyed at the obvious course of action, yet more amused at my newfound power. Sure enough, the zombie returned the full bin, and swapped it for an empty one. Then it returned to its rounds.

The whole while, I kept one eye on the hallway feed. The undead maintained their positions, sitting eerily still. Dead still.

“Bah-sss, what el-sss wa-duh you have usss do?” The zombie at the door slurred in its gravel throat.

Unsure of what to do or say, I gave my next order. “Each of you, by the steps,” I called. “Pick a floor and empty those garbages. If your bins fill, swap them for an empty one and continue. Recycling too.”

Just then, a searing pain screamed from the hand holding the printed instructions. My hand was glued to the page, my fingers refusing to let go. After what felt like an eternity, the purple glow faded, leaving behind a smooth, crisp brand. I hugged the hand close to my chest, writhing on the floor. The pain disappeared, and I gingerly appraised the mark.

It was skull shaped, with teeth clenched. Around it, bordered an intricate circle with tiny symbols at five points, evenly spaced apart. I gently rubbed the tender area, but it did not smudge. I tried to use more force, but it only stretched the skin and that was painful, so I gave up.

The zombie on the other side of the door said something again… but it wasn't broken anymore. “Boss, there's a lot to do. What would you like the rest of us to do?”

My heart skipped a beat as I peered up at the hallway feed. The crowd had thinned, but there were still zombies.

“Come again?” I asked, dumbfounded.

“Boss, we don't have all night. Can you please direct us?”

I felt a twinge of annoyance, but quickly accepted the reality that I had wasted the better part of an hour, since the doors had closed. I grit my teeth and gave an order, “You, at the door, help me straighten things up in here. The rest of you,” I paused, nerves wavering. “Um… straighten up the floors, clean the bathrooms, then report back to me.”

The door began to shake immediately. My eyes shot to the screen, and I watched the undead army march out of view. Save for the one at the door, which rattled it by the knob. 

A twinge of pain shot through my hand, and I glanced down. My brow furrowed as the brand glowed a dull orange. Against my better judgement, I unlocked the door. Like clockwork, the creature pushed inside. It effortlessly breached the filing cabinet, extending one gnarled hand towards me.

I recoiled, but the zombie froze. Its hand remained outstretched, one unblinking eye trained on my eyes. Hesitantly, I accepted the disgusting handshake. My brows furrowed at the flash that occurred when our hands touched. While we shook our hands, I didn't see the rotting corpse. I saw the man he once was. The very man who had arranged for me to land this position.

My stomach dropped as I understood my fate. So long as I lived and wherever I went, this would be my final resting place. 

If the necromancer is out there, can I at least get an assistant manager? Fifty employees are a lot to keep track of. Also, can we get the basement door fixed, the employees say there's a draft during the daytime.
