I’ve always been fascinated by urban exploration, but this trip was different. This time, I wasn’t just searching for abandoned relics; I was searching for people. When I heard about an abandoned village with a derelict hospital on the outskirts and rumors of people who had mysteriously vanished, I couldn’t resist. Equipped with my trusty flashlight, notebook, camera, smartphone, smartwatch, medkit, and a sturdy pair of boots, I set off early one foggy morning, determined to uncover the truth.

The village was eerily silent as I approached. Overgrown vegetation had reclaimed much of the area, and the old, dilapidated houses stood like sentinels, guarding their untold stories. I started with the houses, cautiously stepping inside each one, my flashlight cutting through the darkness. Each house felt like a time capsule, frozen in the moment when the last person left. Dusty furniture, faded photographs, and forgotten trinkets whispered tales of the lives once lived here.

As I moved deeper into the village, my camera clicked away, capturing the haunting beauty of the decay. I meticulously noted down my observations, hoping to piece together the history of this ghostly place later. But it wasn’t until I reached the hospital at the edge of the village that I felt a chill run down my spine.

The hospital loomed ahead, its broken windows and crumbling facade giving it an even more sinister appearance. I hesitated for a moment before pushing the heavy doors open. They creaked loudly, as if protesting my intrusion. The air inside was stale, filled with the scent of mildew and something I couldn’t quite place.

My flashlight flickered as I stepped into the main hall, its beam illuminating the peeling wallpaper and shattered glass strewn across the floor. The hospital was massive, with long, winding corridors that seemed to stretch into eternity. I made my way through the desolate halls, my footsteps echoing off the walls.

Room after room, I encountered remnants of a once-bustling facility: rusted hospital beds, medical equipment covered in dust, and patient records scattered haphazardly. Each discovery felt like a piece of a puzzle, but there was a sense of dread that grew with every step I took.

I reached a room marked “Records” and felt a strange compulsion to enter. Inside, I found shelves upon shelves of old files. I picked one at random and opened it. The patient’s name was scribbled in faded ink, but what caught my attention was the date: it was from the 1950s. My smartwatch buzzed, reminding me to check my phone. I had a signal, which was odd given the remoteness of the location.

As I scrolled through my notifications, I noticed a series of messages from an unknown number. They were cryptic, with phrases like “You’re not alone” and “They see you.” My heart raced as I looked around, but there was no one there.

I quickly pocketed my phone and continued my exploration, trying to shake off the unease. I entered another room, this one filled with surgical equipment. My flashlight beam caught something shiny in the corner. I approached and saw it was a notebook, much like mine. I picked it up and flipped through the pages. It belonged to another urban explorer, and the last entry was dated just a week ago.

The final entry sent chills down my spine. It read: “I hear whispers. Someone’s following me. If you find this, leave immediately. It’s not safe.”

A sudden noise from the corridor made me jump. It sounded like footsteps. I turned off my flashlight and held my breath, straining to listen. The footsteps grew louder, closer. My smartwatch buzzed again, displaying a single word: “Run.”

I didn’t need any more encouragement. I bolted from the room, sprinting down the dark hallways, my heart pounding in my chest. The footsteps behind me quickened, keeping pace with my own. I burst through the front doors and didn’t stop running until I was back at my car.

As I drove away, I glanced back at the village. It seemed even more ominous now, a place that should be left alone. My phone buzzed once more. Another message from the unknown number: “You escaped, but not for long.”

I never went back to that village or the hospital. Some places are meant to remain forgotten, their secrets buried with time. And sometimes, those secrets are better left undiscovered.
