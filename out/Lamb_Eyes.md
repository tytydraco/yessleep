Your oldest friend is not always your best friend.

At the time, I thought he might be.

When I was a child, I had a friend who I would play with in the backyard. Sometimes he was a boy. Sometimes he was an animal. If he ever got angry, he became something else entirely. We got along because he was just like me. Lonely and strange. No one would go near him. No one would even look at him. It was like he was invisible.

I first met him behind the slide on my elementary school playground. He was crouched in the damp wood chips, shaking. His curly white head was all spotted with red. I thought he was a hurt baby animal. I crawled under the plastic jungle gym, reaching out to him tentatively, and felt his hot breath ghost the back of my wrist. When he looked up at me wildly, his eyes were human. I wasn't scared.

I took him home in a cardboard box and cleaned his wounds. I fed him from a bottle and stroked his fleece while I read him storybooks about fairy queens and brave paupers and lovers lost in the woods. The days went by, and his wounds closed up. Soon, he could stand on his own.

I tried to keep him in a pen in the yard, but he got too strong to be held and broke out in the night.

One morning, I tugged on my rubber boots and ran out to feed him, the dew clinging to my legs as I tore through the sedges. The chickenwire pen had been split open from the inside. I huddled there in the wet grass and cried until my mother came to comfort me.

"He'll come back," she whispered, stroking my hair. "Just you wait."

I tried to forget him but whenever I was supposed to be filling out a worksheet or quietly reading to myself in class, my mind wandered. I would imagine what my little lamb was doing out there all alone. I wondered if he was hurt again. I pictured him covered in bite marks and scratches, bleating pitifully and stumbling over roots. A bleeding beacon in the dark woods.

On kinder days, I pictured him frolicking and well-fed on a farm somewhere, growing stronger every day. I hoped he was happy, wherever he was.

Three weeks later, I was hiding beneath my covers to read a book past my bedtime when I heard it: a soft tapping.

A boy stood outside my window, drawing spirals on the humid glass with a dirty finger. His white hair was long and tangled with thistles and weeds, his face a mottled tapestry of deep scars. It reminded me of the bark of an old oak tree. The boy's eyes were a soft shade of amber with pupils like tiny square windows. They bulged strangely beneath long, pale eyelashes. Lamb eyes. I knew it was him.

This is how I came to know my oldest friend. I will call him F.

I let F in without a thought. He was trembling. At first I thought he might be cold, then sticky summer air drifted through the open window and I realized that he was starving. The sharp slats of his ribs protruded from an equally mottled torso. When he turned to shut the window behind him, I saw the sharp spikes of vertebrae running down his back, disappearing into the threadbare red cloth wrapped around his waist.

So, I fed him. I didn't know what boys from the forest ate, but I did my best. I led F into the dark kitchen and made him my favorite sandwich, peanut butter and banana with honey drizzled on both sides. He devoured it in seconds with a lack of manners that made me laugh.

I was messily trying to make hot cocoa from a box mix when he spoke for the first time.

"How do you like your hot chocolate?" I'd asked, shaking a clump of cocoa powder from the foil packet. "I like tons of marshmallows."

"Like... you." I almost missed the words, soft and crackling like dead leaves crushing underfoot.

I dropped a fistful of mini marshmallows into both of our mugs. F seemed satisfied with this. He watched me closely as I took a sip my cocoa, then followed my lead. It was still too hot. I flinched, bringing the mug away from my lips, then blew across the surface, puffing steam away from the rim. He did the same.

F took to copying my every move. It was like he was learning how to be a kid for the first time. It threw me off at first, the way he trailed behind me without a sound, but this quickly turned to a familiar sort of comfort. He became my shadow.

I decided to give him a tour of the house, careful not to wake my parents. This was well before my mother left and my father started to work long night shifts. I'd often get reprimanded for creeping through the house at night when I couldn't sleep, wandering around and around like a little poltergeist until Dad flicked the light switch and caught me in the act.

I showed F the dusty secret nook full of spiders under the stairs and my favorite hide and seek spots behind the doors. I warned him about the creakiest floorboards so we could sneak past without a sound.

I showed him the gap beneath the stove where roof rats would sometimes squeeze through to feast on crumbs. We held our breath and watched one creep out onto the kitchen tiles, turn a circle cautiously, and meander over to eat a bit of sandwich crust that had fallen earlier.

Beside me, F was trembling again. I wondered if he was afraid, but when I looked, I saw that his jaw had hinged open at an uncanny angle, exposing sharp white teeth that dripped with saliva. He was fixated on the rat.

Before I could hold him back, he leaped forward and grabbed the rat in his teeth. There was a sickening crack of fragile bones.

He ate it. I was reminded of the pet king snake in my classroom, how it contorted around its frozen prey. I watched the rodent's carcass slide down, becoming a distended lump in his throat before vanishing into his gut.

When F turned towards me again, his face was distorted, animal. I felt a little sick, but I was not afraid. Observing him fulfilled the same sort of animal curiosity as watching the king snake in its tank, or one of those nature documentaries on Animal Planet.

I had suspected that F wasn't a normal boy anyway.

I asked if he wanted me to read a book to him. He agreed, his face cracking into a smile I recognized as human once again.

We built a small fort from my sheets and huddled inside. F sat cross-legged beside me, holding a small green camping lantern to illuminate the pages while I practiced my reading skills. He drank up every word in silence, only broken by the occasional soft laugh or gasp in response. I hadn't realized how much time had passed until the hazy light of dawn was filtering through the sheets.

We heard my mom knock on my door.

F shot up in a panic. He threw open the window and clambered onto the sill.

I remember asking if I'd ever see him again.

He just stared at me with those wide prey eyes, his jaw set. Then, he fled into my backyard once more.

Mom came into my room to help me get ready for school. As I picked out my clothes, brushed my teeth, and ate cereal at the kitchen table across from my parents, I thought of everything they did not know, of the secret friend I had made while they slept. My bones were indescribably heavy, but my mind felt light. The night felt like a far off dream, the details melting away with every passing minute of sunlight.

But I knew the boy with lamb eyes was real. He had to be.

The next night, he came back.

And the next.

By third grade, I was visiting my friend in the woods almost every night.

After a few too-close calls with my parents catching him creeping around the house, I decided that he would have to stay outside.

My parents argued often these days, mainly in hushed tones on the other side of doors. I could never pick out the words, just the bitterness.

If things got unbearable, I would creep out of my bedroom window just as F had done on that first night, and take off running into the shadow of the woods beyond our lawn.

F would be waiting with a new game.

Sometimes we scaled the towering magnolia tree at the edge of the property, climbing until the world felt far away and small. I could never reach the top, but F would always go for the highest boughs, his thin body disappearing beyond the waxy leaves and seed pods.

A few times, he popped back out and scared me so badly I almost lost my grip on the slick bark. Then he laughed, and I had to laugh too, adrenaline rushing through my veins.

There was an edge of cruelness to the way he played. I didn't see it so clearly back then.

Another time, F brought me to an abandoned well deep in the forest. We had been hiking for an hour at least when we came upon the clearing where it stood all alone. It was a simple stone structure covered by a small slanted roof. A rope swayed from the rotten wood where a bucket had once been tied.

The air smelled sweet and damp, like overripe fruit and rot. Kudzu blanketed the trees and tumbled down into the clearing like tresses of tangled hair.

F leaped onto the side of the well with a recklessness that made my heart jump. Keeping his balance crouched there on the stones, he called for me to join him. When I approached, he pulled me up to sit on the rim.

"This is my wishing well," he said. "Do you like it?" Recently, he'd been speaking more, borrowing phrases from my own vocabulary and the chapter books I read to him.

I nodded.

Those amber animal eyes bored deep into my own.

"Do you ever wish for something, and want it very, very badly?"

I thought about it. There were some things I wished for very often, but I couldn't say. I wished my mother was more like her old self, back before the rumors and sickness took root. And yet, I also wished I was more like my mother. She didn't seem to mind if people found her strange.

At this age, I had become acutely aware that I was somehow different. My classmates almost never spoke to me. When they did, the corners of their mouths curled up like I'd just told them a joke without knowing it. I sat alone most days, reading or drawing or staring into space. I often dreamed of being stolen away from my home to another world where people were more like me. A world where I wouldn't be a moth in a butterfly garden. To speak these thoughts would be to make them real, though.

I shrugged. "I don't know. Do you have a wish?"

The intensity of F's gaze scorched me. It was too much. I wanted to go home.

Finally, he looked away, peering into the dark mouth of the well.

"I wish I was not so hungry."

F was always hungry. In the time I'd known him, he'd gone from feeding on rats and loose scraps around the house to larger things. I'd seen him hunched in the tall grass outside of my window, devouring the live flesh of a sick, bleating deer until its bones glistened white beneath the moon. He always turned away when he ate, or else waited until he thought I wasn't around. A sort of guilt preceded the act.

I didn't know what to say. I looked into the depths of the well. All I could see was an inky void. When I angled my flashlight down, the beam was swallowed up before it touched the bottom.

I took a penny from my pocket and held it over the well. It was a lucky one. I'd found it glittering from a crack in the sidewalk by the diner. I would make F's wish, I decided. Anything to stop the sadness that blanketed him like a pelt.

Before I could drop the coin, F snatched my wrist.

"She wouldn't like that." My friend sounded so sharp, so angry. He was hurting me.

"Who?" I challenged. Tears pricked my eyes. There were rules to this game that I didn't know, and I was breaking them.

"The—" he paused, brow furrowed. He was searching for the right word. "The queen."

My mind conjured images of royalty from my old fairy tales, beautiful figures of royalty swathed in spider-silk robes and adorned with crowns of flowers.

Once he was sure that I would not drop the coin, F let my wrist go. Tiny red crescents filled with blood where his nails had broken skin.

"She likes half-living things," he said softly. "Things that are almost dead."

Sitting there beside him on the edge of the well, my stomach felt strange. F rested a hand on my shoulder.

I remember my body lurching.

Then, the world was a kaleidoscope. Light, color and sound twisted into an incomprehensible blur and I was falling.

I don't know how it happened. I don't know if I lost my balance, or if F pushed me. I do know that I could have died that day in the woods with no one else around. My broken body would have been left there in the damp and dark until the flesh dropped from my bones.

I know that he caught me by the arm.

The blood rushed to my head as I dangled over the pit. It smelled of wet moss and rot. My shoulder ached in its socket from being yanked with such sudden force. I struggled to find a foothold on the inner edge of the well, my sneakers slipping against the wet stone.

When I looked up at F, his face held no emotion at all. At least nothing I could comprehend. An inhuman blankness.

At that moment, for perhaps the first time since meeting him, I wondered if my friend would really bring harm to me.

I pleaded for help. What else could I could do? He could've let go like it was nothing at all. Maybe that's why I did not cry, or even think to scream. I didn't want to spook him.

I asked again. Still, I did not raise my voice. F stared back with that inscrutable face. It was like calming a fright-prone horse. I was reminded of the ones at the stable down the road from my house.

My entire arm burned from holding my body's weight for so long.

After what felt like ages, F relented. He grabbed my other arm and helped me out of the well without a word.

I collapsed, letting sweet grass and solid ground cradle my body as I caught my breath. I could hear F saying something, distantly. It sounded like an apology.

When I opened my eyes, I realized that he was not addressing me. I don't know why I thought he would. He never said sorry to me, not once.
