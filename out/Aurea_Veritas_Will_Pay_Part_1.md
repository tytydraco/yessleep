LOG NO 00000001 OF THE AUREA VERITAS 

20 April 1906

Hello, is this thing on? Ah yes it is. My name is Dr Francis Baker, and me and my team of 20 researchers has been investigating the cause of the earthquake that devastated San Francisco recently. But, we have not found a cause, instead, we have found something far far greater.

We have discovered a crack, caused by the earthquake, seemingly. But this is not a crack on the crust of the Earth, but instead in reality itself. It is a thing of glorious beauty, and requires much more research. Thankfully I have managed to find several sponsors for my work, and have been able to start a small organization to investigate the rift.
Francis signing off! 

LOG NO 00000002

22 April 1906

This is Francis Baker again, and we sent Gupta through the portal yesterday, and we still haven't seen him exit yet, so it appears the rift is highly dangerous, and we need to proceed with great caution.
Francis signing off!

LOG NO 00000003

24 April 1906

Gupta came back through today. He was 24 when he went in. He came back out at 89. We put him in one of our debriefing rooms but the only thing he says is "Aurea Veritas" which appears to be Latin for "Golden Truth". Needs further investigation. 
Francis signing off!

LOG NO 00000004

25 April 1906

*Grunting noises* This is Dr Francis *rumbling sounds* Oh shit it's coming.
I have to talk fast, I don't have much time left. Gupta didn't come back alone, he came back with a doppelganger.

 * in background* 

OHHHHH FRANCISSSSSS!!!!!

And now it's stolen my fucking identity, and I think I'm going to die. *Crashing sounds* AHHHHHHHH *choking sounds* 

*giggle* Francis signing off!

LOG NO 00000005

30 April 1906

This is Dr Carter, ever since Francis got killed by his doppelganger, we've had to up security. And since Francis is dead, the sponsors are controlling the research team now. They named our team "Aurea Veritas" after whatever bullshit Gupta was muttering and are insisting on us telling no one about the fact that we've found a scientific anomaly that could change the world.
Everyone's keeping their mouth shut because the sponsors are powerful people and nobody wants to mess with them. We trapped the doppelganger in a cell, and it never answers any questions, just claims to be the real Dr Francis and giggles whenever we don't believe it.

LOG NO 00000006

3 May 1906

The doppelganger turned into one of the sponsors, escaped and killed 30 people before security shot it dead. Everyone is shaken and a couple of people are insisting that we try and destroy the rift.
All the people who said that have "accidentally fallen into the rift" and everybody knows it's bullshit but now everybody is too scared to do anything about it.

LOG NO 00000007

10 May 1906

The people who went in never came back out. Instead we got some weird grotesque ball of flesh that screams and moans. The sponsors are still insisting that the rift is good, and we're not allowed to leave the building anymore. They're not even trying to hide the executions now. My wife was one of the rebellious ones, and now she's one of the faces on the blob.

Owen Daly's diary-
3 March 1906

Dear diary, the on site therapist told me that I should probably keep a diary, to keep my nerves calm. I've seen some crap, and so I definitely need this. Today I had a jelly sandwich, and a capuccino, and it was fine I guess? I also had to do a research log for the rift today, and that was pretty fun, although it was brighter than usual. That's everything interesting that happened today, so good night diary!

4 March 1906

Today was just about the same as yesterday, I had a jelly...... or was it ham? well I had a sandwich that's for sure, and a cappuccino again. And today was my day off, so no work! I'm gonna go to sleep now.
