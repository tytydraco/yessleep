Last week me and my friend Daniel dropped acid as we were sick of the taste of shroomz and thought “hey acid is probably the same” but the plug said it would last 9 hours but it’s been and week and he still hasn’t left…

It was a fun time for the time being you know just dumbasses being dumbasses but one thing really caught my eye, a man not even a spooky looking one just a normal man… always observing us during our trip, just watching us but after 10 hours it basically completely worn off no more crazy visuals no more stupid shit coming out of our mouths. We didn’t feel normal but didn’t feel like we were tripping soon Daniel left, But the man didn’t…

During the next day I saw him watching me from my doorway I thought “hmmm maybe it hasn’t fully worn off yet?” So I ignored it cuz I knew he wasn’t real. Later when I got home from work he was just sitting on my couch and watching tv and I didn’t leave the T.V on I thought “no no I must’ve left it on, he’s not real he’s not fucking real” I start freaking the fuck out, my heart started to race, I started sweating, but I knew he wasn’t even there but to make sure I threw a pear at him and yes I said pear. And guess what I fucking missed but not fully it scrapped his hand but his skin didn’t move? It didn’t ripple, it didn’t stretch, and he didn’t fucking react…

I went to my bed praying to god he wouldn’t be there when I woke up but at some point during the night I woke up and saw him staring at me through the crack in my closet. For backstory I am deathly afraid of Ajar doors I don’t know why but they freak me out and this bastard must’ve of known that. I started shouting and yelling “HOLY SHIT WHO ARE YOU? ARE YOU REAL ARE YOU JUST LIVING IN MY FUCKING HOUSE!?!?!?” He didn’t respond just looked at me and disappeared into the abyss of my closet, I was too scared to move my closet isn’t even big enough for my clothes how did he even get in there? At this point I knew he wasn’t real as it was impossible to even crouch in there and I felt like a helpless child, clutching my blanket and holding my Kuromi plush and yea I’m a grown ass man with a kuromi doll leave me alone.

I didn’t sleep a damn wink and hell I don’t even think I winked at all my eyes didn’t leave the crack of the closet. When dawn finally broke I bolted out of the room and straight to my front door but what I saw made my blood run cold…

My front door had its handle took off… I was trapped it took me a while to realise that the man who I thought was the consequence of a bad trip was a real man who had somehow gotten into my house and was living there while I was non the wiser. I screamed like a goddamn banshee my voice when higher then I thought was possible I screamed, and screamed, and fucning screamed then I heard the footsteps…

They weren’t normal footsteps it was like he was walking in zigzags and he kept changing the rhythm walking faster and faster then slower and slower playing fucning mind games on me. My eyes never left the bedroom door expecting for him to walk out and kill me my mind was just “oh my god oh my god I’m gonna die this sick fuck is gonna kill me fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK” 

The door let out a creak that probably didn’t even last a millisecond but my eyes instinctively shut not wanting to look at what ever was about to walk out and kill me. The footsteps sounding more calculated like he was trying to be unpredictable one step was never in the same place twice. The only thoughts I had were “mom I’m sorry” I felt a searing pain in my head possible the worst I’ve ever felt I was so caught up in my thoughts I didn’t realise he was right infront of me now having his hand wrapped around my head slowly crushing it making sure I felt every single bit of pain I could of felt. In a last ditch effort I just let out a guttural scream something I didn’t know I could conjure up it sounded like I was the lead singer in a shitty goregrind band 

I finally opened my eyes being brave enough to see the face of my stalker. He was scarier than anything out of any horror this is because he was a completely normal looking man…
No scars no scary features he didn’t even look a weirdo you’d see in a coffee shop just looking at girls he was just a normal very human man…
