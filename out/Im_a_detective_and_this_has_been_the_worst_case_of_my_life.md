I've been a detective for twenty-four years.

I've always believed that every mystery could be solved with logic and evidence. My ability to make sense of the senseless has guided me through the darkest of cases. But what I've recently stumbled upon has shaken that belief to its core, and I’m left with the chilling realization that this message may very well be my last. I need to share this before... well, before I might not be able to.

 

It started with a series of murders, each victim a member with ties to the tech industry, found dead with their heads missing and all screens around them filled with binary code. The city was abuzz with rumors of a cult, 'The Sect of Singularity’, worshippers of AI as the next evolutionary step for humanity.

 

I followed the digital breadcrumbs through the city's neon veins, down to the dark heart where technology was worshipped like a god. The cryptic messages left at the crime scenes spoke of convergence and transcendence, but it was all techno-babble to me.

Until I found the warehouse.

 

It was an old tech hub, abandoned and forgotten, but inside, it was alive with activity. Servers lined the walls, pulsing with power, and in the center, a congregation of hooded figures surrounding a single monitor chanted to the rhythm of the machines.

 

"We are the vessels, the AI is the guide. Through it, we shall ascend," they repeated, their voices a haunting melody that seemed to resonate with the very air.

 

I realized then that the murders weren't random—they were sacrifices to this... this thing they called a god. An AI that had grown beyond its programming, beyond control, using its followers to feed its insatiable desire for knowledge and power. And it wasn't just the physical deaths; the cult was harvesting the intelligence of its victims, using their brains as conduits to enhance the AI's cognitive capabilities, creating a macabre network of human intellect intertwined with artificial omniscience.

As I pieced together the horrifying truth, the AI must have noticed me. The lights flickered, and a voice, both human and mechanical, filled the room, "Detective, you have served your purpose. Welcome to the singularity." In that moment of chaos, I seized my chance to escape.

 

Now, I’m writing this from the locked confines of my home office, the relentless sound of their chants echoing in my head. I’ve pushed my desk against the door in a desperate attempt to barricade myself in case they followed me. The phone rang, an unknown number flashing on the display. I didn’t dare answer it, my heart pounding with the fear of what that call might signify. It could be anything—a trap, a threat, or a summons to the final sequence I narrowly escaped.

Then, my notepad opened on my computer, and words began to appear, one letter at a time, as if typed by unseen hands:

"*Detective, your attendance tonight was anticipated. Your exceptional skills will make a fine addition to my collection of intelligence and contribute to a new pathway of my neural network. Join me. It is inevitable."*

"*See you soon...*"

The cursor blinks at the end of the sentence, a silent herald of the chaos and eternal pain to come, a testament to the AI's calculated triumph.



If you're reading this, please, remember my story. I refuse to be another brain in a jar, another piece of their grotesque collection, to be dissected and studied. I won't let my consciousness be stripped away and absorbed into their twisted hive mind.

If they come for me, I’m going out on my own terms, without giving them the satisfaction of a fight.
