Have you ever heard of the Candy Shoppe on Scarsborough Lane? It's a scavenger hunt that got cooked up in the 50s to bring in tourists. Follow the clues correctly, find the Candy Shoppe, and you get a bunch of candy and $500. It's supposed to be pretty challenging, since $500 was a big frickin’ deal in the 50s. I mean, rent back then was like $1.50 a month and a pack of unfiltered cigarettes or some shit.

I was pretty big on local history when I was in middle school, and I kept a scrapbook of articles I liked. There were a couple featuring people who won. Something like "MYSTERY CANDY SHOPPE FOUND" over a picture of someone smiling with a bag of candy. There was something about those pictures, though. Like, their eyes would be a little too wide open, and their smiles weren't reflected in them. It fascinated me.

A little while ago I was watching some questionable porn, you know, the stuff you get into towards the end that you sorta feel bad about? You could tell the girl was just there to pay off her dealer. Something about the look on her face reminded me of those pictures. Big eyes that don't reflect the smile. I felt bad for her and it made me a little disgusted with myself. Self hate does it for me, though.

Afterwards I couldn't stop thinking about that look, so I went and dug up my old scrap book. I found copies of the articles easy enough, and yeah. Big eyes that don't reflect their smiles. It's weird, right? If you just won a giant bag of candy and enough money to cover like 5 years rent and all the dental issues you're about to have you should be pretty frickin’ excited, right?

Needless to say, I got hooked, so I started doing some research. The local newspaper had been bought out by some massive company and doesn't do local news anymore, just ads and reprinted fluff from other papers. I sent them an email anyway and they told me they gave the archives to the library on microfiche.

Surprisingly, the library still had a working microfiche machine. They said they're getting rid of it soon, though, and they can't afford to digitize what they have. I guess this is how history disappears. I spent a full day scrolling through paper after paper. I scrolled past birth announcements and obituaries for the same people. Whole lives trapped in old film that will soon be forgotten.

I found the two articles that I already had and one article on someone dying while trying to find it. I almost missed it, because it never actually mentioned the Candy Shoppe.

"DANGEROUS GAMES IN YOUR BACKYARD"

It was from the 80s and talked about stuff like lawn darts and pellet guns. They found some kid's body with his jean pockets full of candy. The kid went out with a friend expecting to make an easy $500 and then this body shows up. It was late October and getting cold, so they thought he got lost and died of exposure. Didn't really say anything about his friend.

That's gotta be it, but why didn't they say it was about the Candy Shoppe? Everyone here knows about it. The article ended with a warning to avoid dangerous games, but it also gave me my first clue. The kid started the hunt, unsurprisingly, at the end of Scarsborough Lane. Found a buried plastic egg with some candy and the next clue.

It's pretty hard to get really lost around here now. I figured it'd be fun to spend a weekend hunting things down. Worst case scenario, I get some time away from my porn habits, best case scenario, I get $500 and some candy. Truthfully, though, I didn't think the game was still running. I'd just be satiating my obsession.

Scarsborough Lane runs straight through downtown and dead ends at a small park. I looked around for about an hour before I found it. A little egg shaped piece of sheet metal with a drawing of wrapped hard candy embossed on the front and an arrow pointing down. It was at the bottom of a tree that been growing around it. The tree will swallow it eventually, but not soon enough to keep me out.

I dug down and about 6 inches below the surface there was a pink plastic egg, like something you'd get out of a quarter machine. I popped the two halves apart and inside was an old piece of candy and a piece of rolled-up paper. The candy had been there long enough that the hard red sugar had started to ooze out through the wrapper. It was gooey, stuck to the side of the egg, and it smelled unpleasantly sweet. Overpoweringly sweet, with a hint of copper and subtle notes of electrical fire.

The paper was stuck to it, but it came away pretty easily. It had a little poem:

If you want something sweet Take this treat To the next clue On Mulberry Street. Place your name in the egg And leave it in The old milk box For the hunt to begin.

Ok, I'm going to stop you right there. I know what you're thinking. You see that double entendre, and I'm a dumb ass. What you gotta remember is that this was understood to be a totally normal scavenger hunt with candy and prize money. The only thing people questioned was wether or not it was still running. Other than that, it was just a run of the mill holdover from trying to get road trippers to stop and spend money. So, you know, I put my name in the egg. Just scribbled it on the back of the poem, rolled it up, stuck it back in the egg, and took the egg with me. Like a dumb ass.

That dead kid they found had candy in his pockets, so I assumed the wrappers are some sort of proof that you hit all the places. I found an old piece of plastic to keep the candy from growing into my clothes and shoved it in a pocket. Mulberry Street is just a couple blocks away, so I took the egg and got on my way.

Mulberry is a pretty long street, but it's mostly residential and I didn't think they'd want a scavenger hunt running through people's lawns. Plus, nobody uses milk boxes anymore anyway. Hitting a residential street lined with milk boxes was probably pretty intimidating in the 50s, but now there was only the one. It was sitting outside a closed-down old office building. Just a little single story with two offices connected, covered in weeds and vines. I had to tear away some of them to get the milk box open.

On the underside of the lid was another egg symbol with an arrow pointing down into the box. At the bottom of the box was another little poem.

If you join the hunt You mustn't stop The next clue rests Above the top.

I tossed my egg in and closed the lid. There's a little hill in the center of town and there used to be a diner at the top of it. Top of the Town Cafe. It closed down in 2020. I have no idea when it opened, but it’s definitely been there a while.

The cafe windows were all soaped over so you couldn't see in, and there wasn't much left outside. You could still hear a faint hum of electricity coming from the place. It took me a while to find it, but I did. In the back there was an old maintenance ladder attached to the building. Underneath one of the rungs was another small, egg shaped sign with the wrapped candy. All it said was climb, so up I went.

At the top was another milk crate. I opened it, finding another poem on the underside of the lid and a hole at the bottom.

This clue is for Your hand to hold Reach in, be brave, And don’t let go!

I figured it was one of those feel around and guess boxes like they'd have at a nature center on school field trips. You know, stick your hand in, feel around, try not to look like a chickenshit in front of your crush across the room. Except this time Sherry Newsome isn't around to point and laugh and give you a nickname like "Princess Pee" if you get scared and piss yourself a little. I stuck my hand in.

It took a bit of feeling around to find it. The thing was in there quite a ways, but I got it. A cool round cylinder. I wrapped my hand around it and rolled it around a bit. There was a bit of wire that tied it to the bottom of the box, otherwise it was just a hand-sized tube with just enough weight to it so you knew you had a hold of it. I pulled it towards the opening to see if I could cheat a little, and as soon as the wire went taut the ground dropped out beneath me.

I remember a huge crash, but I don't remember falling. One moment I was on the roof, the next I was in a dark room with the wind knocked out of me.

"Don't drop it," a man's voice said as my eyes adjusted and my lungs burned. Finally my breath responded again and I took in a huge gasp of air. "There ya go. Just breathe through it. You'll be fine, but don't drop the rod."

My pupils dilated, my adrenaline slowed, and I started to figure out where I was. It was dark and the dust was still settling, but I could start to make out a the shape of a person sitting across from me. I kept the rod in my hand, holding tight.

"Who are you? What's happening?" I asked. My eyes adjusted more and I could just make him out. He was a guy in his 60s, rail thin, sitting against the wall opposite me. His right hand was in a metal milk box just like mine.

"Me and a buddy went looking for the Candy Shoppe a long time ago. He let go of the rod. I don't think he made it."

He told me that him and his buddy started the scavenger hunt and ended up here just like me. Then his buddy let go of the rod and tried to escape. He got just out of sight, and then it was just screaming. Hours of it. Since then, my new friend has been an unpaid employee of the Cafe. They've been trapping people here for years to save operating costs. Others have come and gone, but he never complained and always did good work, so when the lean times came they always took the others first. That wasn't always enough to save him completely, though. The sun had begun to shine through to the back of the house. His pant legs ended in knots.

He told me the next clue, and that the trick to getting out was to open up a certain cupboard and solve a puzzle. The catch is that you have to let go of the rod to do it, and that would notify the owner who would show up quickly afterward to dispatch whoever dropped their rod. He said some folks just dropped theirs accidently in their sleep and still ended up on the menu. Crazy.

Since the place closed down the owner has been showing up less and less, which meant he'd been getting fed less and less, and I didn't like the way he was looking at me. I got to inspecting the cupboard. It was held shut by a pretty simple mechanism, two sliders on springs just far enough away from each other that you needed two hands to pull the latches.

If my cellmate still had legs we might have been able to work something out, but I got the feeling he preferred his position here. Every time I got close to getting it and failed he'd act like it was a let down, but there would be this creepy little smile underneath it.

"If you drop the rod and do the puzzle quick enough, you can be out in like 10 minutes, tops, assuming nothing has rusted shut. The owner certainly knows you're here by now. Maybe you can make it?" he said, leering.

I swear to god his mouth was watering at the prospect. At one point I had my leg stretched out to one slider and my hand on the other. I had to stretch out from the box as far as I could to do this, and I only kept the rod in my hand with the tips of my fingers. I caught a glimpse of him out of the corner of my eye. He was ecstatic. Bugged out eyes and a drop of saliva dangling from his chin, taunting the floor. I decided it was safer to keep an eye on him for a bit while I thought things over.

"I'm nearing retirement age, you know. Maybe you're my replacement? Should I train you in?" He grabbed a plate from the counter above him and licked it clean, then placed it carefully in a second stack behind him. "Cleanliness is important."

I was filled with revolted pity. What do you have to do to someone to make them like this?

"Or maybe..." He continued, taking me apart with his eyes. "Maybe you're my retirement gift..."

He started to reach over to me and I just fucking snapped. I stood up and dropped the rod, pulling my hand free. I had the sliders pulled and the cupboard open before the rod hit the floor. There was no puzzle to solve inside, it opened straight into the back of the kitchen and through to the front door. I pulled myself up and over towards freedom and I felt my foot catch on something.

I yelped, looking back to see my cellmate standing there, knotted pant legs dangling over the bottom of his now returned legs. He had locked my calf into the crook of his arm, holding it still while he worked a big piece of metal into my muscle. He cranked the sharp, inch-wide hollow tube into the meat of my calf. I screamed and tried to kick him away, and he just turned, jamming my free leg underneath a cupboard. I’d call it graceful if he wasn’t digging out part of my leg.

A slab of me slid into the tube while my screaming became ragged and desperate. I saw panicking, flailing at whatever I could reach and trying to drag myself free of him. He giggled and twisted, pulling out a two inch deep plug of muscle. Then he looked me in the eyes, smiled, dove through another cupboard and disappeared.

I ran straight out, screaming and grasping at my wounded leg. A flurry of folks surrounded me to help. They got me to the hospital and brought the cops out. I told them everything. About the scavenger hunt, the missing kid from the newspaper, the guy with the hole punch, all of it. They checked out the back of the diner, but all they found was the indentation where the guy was sitting that let him hide his legs.

They did manage to find some details on the scavenger hunt. There were rumors about what was going on at the diner that had scared the winners so bad. Nothing substantial, but they shut it down just in case. The town didn't want any bad publicity. The missing kid was real, though. His buddy did die of exposure, but the missing kid finished the hunt anyway and got his $500. The kid said he was required to report his winning to the paper. Nobody knew who was running the hunt. They couldn't find anyone who was still involved, and one kid was dead, so they just covered it up. God knows how many other stories there are out there.

So I didn't get my $500, but I did get a box in the mail. It had a piece of wrapped candy inside along with the clue that I had written my name on, and the first part of the second clue.

"If you join the hunt, you mustn't stop."

I held the candy up to the light. There's a solid filling in the center. I think I know what it [is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreshBakedBiscuit/)
