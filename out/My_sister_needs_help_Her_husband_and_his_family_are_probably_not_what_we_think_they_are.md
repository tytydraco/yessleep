Listen. I need your help. My sister’s missing and I’m afraid that there’s not much time left. It’s been a week since I last heard from her. She told me that she was going to a hotel with her husband and his family. Her in-laws are having a grand family reunion, and since she’s been married for only a year, it’ll be her first time witnessing their “family traditions.”

“Family traditions?” I repeated, chuckling over our lunch of homemade burgers and beer. “You make it sound like they’re part of a super secret cult.”

“It’s not like that,” Sally replied, taking a sip of her drink. She sighed. “I think he just wants to make it up to me. We’ve been having lots of arguments lately.”

“About what?”

She shrugged. “Lots of things,” she said. “It’s hard to explain. But he does want me to be a part of his family. He’s doing his best.”

 It was one of her rare visits to the apartment we used to share with our college friends. Most of the time, she was at her husband’s penthouse in the city’s financial district. He rarely let her go anywhere without his permission. He was twelve years older than my sister, and up to now I wonder how they even got together.

I never trusted Byron Ruthven. Not from the start. I didn’t care that he was an incredibly wealthy industrialist, specializing in the trade of medical technology and tools. I didn’t care that he belonged to a really old, prominent clan, with family members in different areas of business, trade, and politics. I didn’t care if the Ruthvens practically ruled the country’s economy. All I knew was that my sister was slowly being controlled, brainwashed, and made to surrender her individuality from the moment she became part of their family’s clutches. Before she married Ruthven, she was a successful lifestyle journalist in her own right. She had a job she enjoyed, and she hung out a lot with me and our friends. Then he made her quit her job. He controlled her finances, tracked her movements, and was wary of her personal circle, particularly me. It didn’t help that Sally and I had been orphans ever since she was eight and I was twelve respectively. We only had each other as family, and I was starting to lose her too.

“I know you don’t really like him, Albert,” Sally broke into my thoughts. “But let me just give him this chance. Just this one last chance to save our marriage. If it works, then good. If it doesn’t—” She shrugged her shoulders again. “Maybe I’ll consider your advice and divorce him.”

“If he ever lays a finger on you again—”

“He never has,” she said firmly. “I told you, if he beat me up, I’d remember it!”

I remember that horrible morning, about two months into their marriage, when Sally suddenly showed up at our apartment wearing a thick dark jacket. When she removed it, her arms showed deep, dark bruises and bite marks.

I remember swearing, flaring up in anger. “Sally, what the hell? He did this to you?”

I remember how she immediately sprang to his defense. “I swear, it’s not like that. I just woke up and saw these bruises all over me. And my arms were hurting. He would never hit me. If he did, I’d remember it! Just—just take me to a doctor, please.”

I brought her to the nearest hospital, which, upon hindsight, was probably not the right place to take her, since it was a private hospital where the Ruthvens were board members. “You probably have a blood condition,” the doctor told her in front of me. “We’ll do more tests. Come back next week.”

But that wasn’t last time she would show up wearing a jacket, or long sleeves. Come to think of it, I have rarely seen her in short sleeves since then.

“Just this once,” Sally told me. “If his family doesn’t like me, then that’s all the more reason this won’t work out.”

Our conversation then shifted to other topics, such as the latest town gossip and my work at a nearby architectural firm, where I was due promotion anytime. She wished me good luck, and shortly afterwards, left, and that was the last time I saw or heard from her.

That was a week ago. My messages were unread. My calls, unanswered.. When I went to check on them at the penthouse, the maid said that the entire family – including Sally – was out. 

“If I were you, I’d stop asking too much,” she said, slamming the door on my face. Two bodyguards personally hoisted me to the elevator, so there was no choice but to leave.

Finally, I went to the police and told them everything. The officer at the station raised his eyebrow. He whispered something to his officer-in-partner, who shook her head. They called up the Chief.

“Which hotel is this?” the chief said. “You know that the Ruthvens own at least five hotel chains in this country alone.”

“Sally–she–she didn’t mention which hotel it was,” I said, visibly panicking.

The Chief frowned. “Look, your sister’s an adult. Twenty-nine, am I correct? She’s probably just having a lot of fun with her rich in-laws. She’ll come around. Besides, if I were you…” Here he dropped his voice. “I wouldn’t be caught dead crossing the Ruthvens.”

I knew I had to take matters into my own hands. I went back into my car, seriously thinking about spreading the news all over the internet, that my sister was missing and that the Ruthvens weren’t cooperating. I looked at the photo I kept in my wallet – of me and my parents and Sally, way before the car accident, and remembered how I promised my mother and father that I’d do everything to keep my sister safe. I felt like crying, but I knew I had to be strong.

That was when a strange notification popped up on my phone. It was a video clip from an unknown Viber number. I would’ve swiped it, sent it to Spam, or ignored it altogether. But instead, the preview sent chills down my spine. I hit play.

It was taken in a hallway of some sort. Probably a fancy hotel’s hallway, judging by the golden-white floral wallpaper and lighting. My sister adjusted the camera before it focused on her pale, frightened face. She had a black eye, cuts on her forehead, and a strange symbol carved on her left cheek. She stared right into the camera.

“Sally!” I breathed aloud. I immediately called the number, but there was no response on the other end. I called it again. Same lack of response. Finally, I saved the video. My worst fears were confirmed. I now knew the Ruthvens had something to do with her disappearance.

The thing was, where the hell were they?

I hit play again, taking a deep breath. My sister was in pain, and as much as I hated seeing her that way, this was the only way I could find answers.

She stared straight into the camera, her eyes glistening with tears. Then she swallowed. The gaze in her eyes looked determined all of a sudden.

“To anyone who sees this,” she began. “I am Sally Aubrey Ruthven, the second wife of Byron Ruthven. I don't think I’ll ever get out of this hotel alive. At least–” She swallowed her tears again. “At least, I hope I don’t.”

My god, Sally, what have they done to you?

“If I die here, it would be the best case scenario. I would rather die than continue living this terrible life. Either way, there’s something the public must know about the Ruthvens. They inherited a curse, every single one of them,  down to my eleven-year-old stepdaughter Elizabeth, whom I am determined to protect. She’s the reason I didn’t leave right away. Please, if you can see this, watch on. This is the first of such videos.” She wiped her eyes. “I’m sorry,” she sobbed. “I should’ve told the world the truth earlier.”

The video ended there. I’m now at home. I’ve spent the entire night trying to upload the video to YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, you name it, but it would crash everytime. Apparently, the file itself is corrupted. I’ve also tried converting it into other formats but the results are the same. I’m starting to wonder if the video itself is cursed.

So now I’m basically back to square zero. I need to find all the hotels owned by the Ruthvens, which would be like looking for a needle in the haystack. I would ask to take a look at the security footage, interview people, do everything I could until the whole truth is out. Until Sally’s home.

I’m afraid that my sister’s in grave danger. No, I’m sure. While typing this down my phone rang with another notification, from the same unknown Viber account that gave me my only clue. It was a short message that read, “Watch your back, Albert.”

Below it was an address to the oldest town in the city. I guess that’s where I’ll be heading next. Wish me luck.

Help me bring Sally back home.
