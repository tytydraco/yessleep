I don't really know how to lead into this so I'm just gonna come out and say it. I'm stuck in an apartment complex and I don't know how to get out. I don't even know how I got here. I went to bed in my apartment last night and woke up here this morning. The apartment isn't bad. It's a one bedroom one bathroom little studio with a big bay window along the far wall. There's a grassy field and a single tree outside of it. There's a wardrobe with some clothes in it, my clothes actually, a pretty ok bed, a small dining area too. There's a TV, PlayStation, a few streaming services on it, a kitchenette, and a fridge that's stocked. What's the problem, right? Like why am I complaining about having everything handed to me, right? Well I do have friends and family I'd like to see again. I'd also like to know how I'm going to get to work. If I'm staying here I want to know how I'm paying for it cause nothing is free in this world. I think the weirdest part of this is that there is a computer on a desk and a smartphone that was on a side table next to the bed. Neither the phone or the computer are mine. 

The phone only has three numbers on it, neighbor 1, neighbor 2, and “administrator”. All the numbers were busy when I tried to call them. After that I spent most of the morning pacing around the apartment trying to get my bearings. I felt like I could figure out what the apartment was if I got at least a working idea of the layout. I went around and around the whole apartment for hours taking mental notes of everything I found. A ding on the closet door next to the front door, a scrape on the wall behind the couch, some paint chipping in the bathroom, a healthy layer of dust on the TV. This was, for all intents and purposes, a studio apartment. Shocker. After that I came to the realization that the only avenue allowed to me was to go out of the apartment, assuming I could get out. It took me a while to work up that much courage. But after another round of looking at every little blemish in the apartment, I decided that enough was enough. Whatever ghoul, goblin, ghost, or any other kind of bugaboo was out there would meet me today. Then it would either kill and eat me, which was likely, or I would scare it off, not at all likely. 

My hands were shaking as I twisted the knob. With a click I felt the door drift open slightly, just enough to peek out. And I saw a hallway. Then I sighed, called myself an idiot, and stepped out into it. The hall was just a hall, much as the apartment was just an apartment. There was an elevator in the middle of the wall, with about seven doors on either side. Each door was numbered 1-7. Normally it would be the floor number then the unit number, so third floor, apartment 14= 314. Not here. Just apartment 1, 2- 7, then 1, 2 you get it. I was in apartment 4 I guess. The halls were carpeted and had white LED lights that emitted no sound. On the far end of the hall, on either side, was a large floor to ceiling window. It was the window that caught my eye. I stepped out of the apartment and let the door fall shut behind me. There was an audible *shunf* as the door closed which made me jump.. I looked at the door and saw a piece of paper taped to it. The paper said remember, trash day is Monday and Friday. please refrain from leaving trash cans in the halls between trash days. Thank you. -Administrator 

I closed my eyes to push the paper from my mind and went back to my original task, the window. I walked down the hall to the end closest to me. It was all blue. Everything in the window was a light sky blue and for a moment I considered it wasn't a window at all, but a mural. But movements of clouds clued me into the fact that, no it was a window after all. The building was so high up there was no ground visible and where I was standing was high above the clouds. I leaned my hand against the glass and felt the cold chill of wind unrestricted by trees or hills. The same feeling you get when you touch an airplane window. I pressed my palm flat against the glass, half-expecting to feel some sort of vibration, some hint that this structure was tethered to the earth below. But there was nothing—just an unsettling stillness. The clouds drifted far beneath me, shifting and reforming like slow-moving tides, an ocean of white with no shore in sight. If there was land below, it was hidden beyond reach, swallowed by the vast, endless sky.

A faint dizziness crept in, and I pulled away, my breath fogging the glass for a moment before vanishing. I turned back to the hallway, pushing away the unease. There had to be a way down.

I made my way toward the elevator first, hoping for a normal panel with floor numbers—something familiar. But as I stepped inside, I was met with three rows of what looked like short yet complex math equations. I didn't waste any time trying to understand what I was seeing and just hit the button with a star on it.

With that the elevator began its long descent. On the screen above the doors nonsense squiggles intermingled with seemingly random Arabic numerals. I could handle that, not knowing where I was going, what I couldn't handle was how long the elevator took to get to the bottom floor. It felt like a full hour had passed when it finally reached the bottom. Or I thought it reached the bottom. I got out of the elevator and found myself in some kind of central lobby area. There the floors were marbled, there were couches and chairs and fire places in all four counters of the room. In the center was a large Afghan run with a statue in the middle. The statue depicted a horse rearing up, and on all four sides of the cubed base were leaflets, pamphlets, booklets, and post cards meant for tourists who wanted to read up on the next thing they should do. Then there was an entry way with a kind of ticket booth with a sign that said “central office”.

Seeing that gave me some hope, but it was all reduced to dust when I saw “closed on Sundays and Mondays” I had no idea what day it was, but somehow, I knew it wouldn’t be in my favor. The booth was empty, the chair behind the counter pushed back as if someone had left in a hurry and never returned. A layer of dust clung to the surface, undisturbed.

To the right of the office, a doorway stood open just enough to show a sliver of the outside. A faint breeze drifted through, carrying with it the crisp scent of high-altitude air. I stepped forward and pushed the door wider.

Beyond it, a metal platform jutted out over nothingness. And ahead—impossibly suspended in the sky—was a second tower. It loomed in the distance, connected to mine by a single, narrow walkway made of rusted metal grating. The bridge swayed slightly, a slow, rhythmic motion, as if breathing.

My pulse quickened. There was no ground, no support structures, nothing anchoring these buildings to anything solid. Just sky, stretching endlessly in all directions.

“Where the fuck am I?” I finally said out loud, as wind whistled around me. There was no where for me to go now but across the walkway and into the second tower. I didn't do that. I wasn't gonna do that and typing this I'm still not gonna do it. Instead I kinda just ended up exploring the complex a bit. If you're reading this you're probably sick of me listing shit but honestly what else do you want from me? I'm alone here, or at least everyone is locked in their apartments otherwise. 

I went back inside and, fully knowing that I was stuck, just kinda wandered around. I found a rec room with arcade cabinets, they weren't turned on, a pool that has a snow cover over it, and a really nice gym. That's about as far as I went before I noticed the sky was almost completely pitch black. I got a sinking feeling when I realized that I was gonna have to guess my way back to my apartment. Having no idea which floor it was on (since I didn't check which button lit up initially). Instead I had to go, floor by floor, for hours until I found it. 

That pretty much catches you up to speed. Since then I've been catching up on shows I've been wanting to watch. Awfully kind of whoever is doing this to provide me with a ps4 I must say, definitely staves off the boredom. I'm just about finished watching boardwalk empire, and I finally caved and watched tiger king five years after that was relevant. So I know it's a long shot but does anyone know how to get out of this? Has anyone reading this been through this before? 

If not I guess it's ok, I mean it's not like I did anything but stay inside and watch TV back in my old life. I don't remember having a job or anyone. I said earlier that I had a family but I only assume they are in my life. Weird as it is to say but, I remembered everything about my life when I woke up. Now I only remember being at home and watching TV or playing video games. I guess I was on Reddit a good amount of the time because I remembered it exists. But my family, friends, pets… nothing. I can't even remember their faces.
