I don't really know how to lead into this so I'm just gonna come out and say it. I'm stuck in an apartment complex and I don't know how to get out. I don't even know how I got here. I went to bed in my apartment last night and woke up here this morning. The apartment isn't bad. It's a one bedroom one bathroom little studio with a big bay window along the far wall. There's a grassy field and a single tree outside of it. There's a wardrobe with some clothes in it, my clothes actually, a pretty ok bed, a small dining area too. There's a TV, PlayStation, a few streaming services on it, a kitchenette, and a fridge that's stocked. What's the problem, right? Like why am I complaining about having everything handed to me, right? Well I do have friends and family I'd like to see again. I'd also like to know how I'm going to get to work. If I'm staying here I want to know how I'm paying for it cause nothing is free in this world. I think the weirdest part of this is that there is a computer on a desk and a smartphone that was on a side table next to the bed. Neither the phone or the computer are mine. 

The phone only has three numbers on it, neighbor 1, neighbor 2, and “administrator”. All the numbers were busy when I tried to call them. After that I spent most of the morning pacing around the apartment trying to get my bearings. I felt like I could figure out what the apartment was if I got at least a working idea of the layout. I went around and around the whole apartment for hours taking mental notes of everything I found. A ding on the closet door next to the front door, a scrape on the wall behind the couch, some paint chipping in the bathroom, a healthy layer of dust on the TV. This was, for all intents and purposes, a studio apartment. Shocker. After that I came to the realization that the only avenue allowed to me was to go out of the apartment, assuming I could get out. It took me a while to work up that much courage. But after another round of looking at every little blemish in the apartment, I decided that enough was enough. Whatever ghoul, goblin, ghost, or any other kind of bugaboo was out there would meet me today. Then it would either kill and eat me, which was likely, or I would scare it off, not at all likely. 

My hands were shaking as I twisted the knob. With a click I felt the door drift open slightly, just enough to peek out. And I saw a hallway. Then I sighed, called myself an idiot, and stepped out into it. The hall was just a hall, much as the apartment was just an apartment. There was an elevator in the middle of the wall, with about seven doors on either side. Each door was numbered 1-7. Normally it would be the floor number then the unit number, so third floor, apartment 14= 314. Not here. Just apartment 1, 2- 7, then 1, 2 you get it. I was in apartment 4 I guess. The halls were carpeted and had white LED lights that emitted no sound. On the far end of the hall, on either side, was a large floor to ceiling window. It was the window that caught my eye. I stepped out of the apartment and let the door fall shut behind me. There was an audible *shunf* as the door closed which made me jump.. I looked at the door and saw a piece of paper taped to it. The paper said remember, trash day is Monday and Friday. please refrain from leaving trash cans in the halls between trash days. Thank you. -Administrator 

I closed my eyes to push the paper from my mind and went back to my original task, the window. I walked down the hall to the end closest to me. It was all blue. Everything in the window was a light sky blue and for a moment I considered it wasn't a window at all, but a mural. But movements of clouds clued me into the fact that, no it was a window after all. The building was so high up there was no ground visible and where I was standing was high above the clouds. I leaned my hand against the glass and felt the cold chill of wind unrestricted by trees or hills. The same feeling you get when you touch an airplane window. I pressed my palm flat against the glass, half-expecting to feel some sort of vibration, some hint that this structure was tethered to the earth below. But there was nothing—just an unsettling stillness. The clouds drifted far beneath me, shifting and reforming like slow-moving tides, an ocean of white with no shore in sight. If there was land below, it was hidden beyond reach, swallowed by the vast, endless sky.

A faint dizziness crept in, and I pulled away, my breath fogging the glass for a moment before vanishing. I turned back to the hallway, pushing away the unease. There had to be a way down.

I made my way toward the elevator first, hoping for a normal panel with floor numbers—something familiar. But as I stepped inside, I was met with three rows of what looked like short yet complex math equations. I didn't waste any time trying to understand what I was seeing and just hit the button with a star on it.

With that the elevator began its long descent. On the screen above the doors nonsense squiggles intermingled with seemingly random Arabic numerals. I could handle that, not knowing where I was going, what I couldn't handle was how long the elevator took to get to the bottom floor. It felt like a full hour had passed when it finally reached the bottom. Or I thought it reached the bottom. I got out of the elevator and found myself in some kind of central lobby area. There the floors were marbled, there were couches and chairs and fire places in all four counters of the room. In the center was a large Afghan run with a statue in the middle. The statue depicted a horse rearing up, and on all four sides of the cubed base were leaflets, pamphlets, booklets, and post cards meant for tourists who wanted to read up on the next thing they should do. Then there was an entry way with a kind of ticket booth with a sign that said “central office”.

Seeing that gave me some hope, but it was all reduced to dust when I saw “closed on Sundays and Mondays” I had no idea what day it was, but somehow, I knew it wouldn’t be in my favor. The booth was empty, the chair behind the counter pushed back as if someone had left in a hurry and never returned. A layer of dust clung to the surface, undisturbed.

To the right of the office, a doorway stood open just enough to show a sliver of the outside. A faint breeze drifted through, carrying with it the crisp scent of high-altitude air. I stepped forward and pushed the door wider.

Beyond it, a metal platform jutted out over nothingness. And ahead—impossibly suspended in the sky—was a second tower. It loomed in the distance, connected to mine by a single, narrow walkway made of rusted metal grating. The bridge swayed slightly, a slow, rhythmic motion, as if breathing.

My pulse quickened. There was no ground, no support structures, nothing anchoring these buildings to anything solid. Just sky, stretching endlessly in all directions.

“Where the fuck am I?” I finally said out loud, as wind whistled around me. There was no where for me to go now but across the walkway and into the second tower. I didn't do that. I wasn't gonna do that and typing this I'm still not gonna do it. Instead I kinda just ended up exploring the complex a bit. If you're reading this you're probably sick of me listing shit but honestly what else do you want from me? I'm alone here, or at least everyone is locked in their apartments otherwise. 

I went back inside and, fully knowing that I was stuck, just kinda wandered around. I found a rec room with arcade cabinets, they weren't turned on, a pool that has a snow cover over it, and a really nice gym. That's about as far as I went before I noticed the sky was almost completely pitch black. I got a sinking feeling when I realized that I was gonna have to guess my way back to my apartment. Having no idea which floor it was on (since I didn't check which button lit up initially). Instead I had to go, floor by floor, for hours until I found it. 

That pretty much catches you up to speed. Since then I've been catching up on shows I've been wanting to watch. Awfully kind of whoever is doing this to provide me with a ps4 I must say, definitely staves off the boredom. I'm just about finished watching boardwalk empire, and I finally caved and watched tiger king five years after that was relevant. So I know it's a long shot but does anyone know how to get out of this? Has anyone reading this been through this before? 

If not I guess it's ok, I mean it's not like I did anything but stay inside and watch TV back in my old life. I don't remember having a job or anyone. I said earlier that I had a family but I only assume they are in my life. Weird as it is to say but, I remembered everything about my life when I woke up. Now I only remember being at home and watching TV or playing video games. I guess I was on Reddit a good amount of the time because I remembered it exists. But my family, friends, pets… nothing. I can't even remember their faces. 


UPDATE: so as it turns out there ARE other people here. Or at the very least there's two other people, among... Other things. I don't remember exactly what I was doing but I guess it was something as innocuous as watching TV and dozing off on the couch. Something about that brought back some memories of drunken nights after a long work day. I was about asleep when I heard a sharp knock on my door. Suddenly I was awake, more awake than before, I was staring at the door like any minute it was about to blow open. There was another knock which caused me to jolt upright. With a great deal of hesitation I twisted the knob and pushed the door open. 

Out of the corner of my eye I saw silky hair tied into a high ponytail falling over a white zip up hoodie. The door must have made a sound because she turned with a shock immediately. She was Asian, in sweatpants, slides, and a tank top under her hoodie. She looked like she woke up to get a glass of water or something. She fixed her glasses looking at me and I looked down the hall to see if there was anyone else. Finally I had no choice but to address the woman right in front of me “uh… hello?” I said, mostly asked. She waved at me and said something in a language I didn't understand but I interpreted it as hello. “No offense or anything but… you're real right?” She looked at me confused, “real.” I said. I stepped out of my apartment and began patting my body “r-ēē-l?” she said another word in a language that I was starting to recognize as either Chinese or something else. 

I sighed, looking around again. I don't know why but the discovery of a random woman in the building was a little off putting, and I had a feeling that I was being watched. “S-so what's your name?” I asked, a nervous smile stretching across my face. She looked at me, confused again, so I pointed at myself “My name IS Jake.” I said “Jake.” I motioned to her “and, you?”

She slowly nodded “Ji-Hye.” She said nodding along. “Ji-Hye Park”. 

“Ok!” I said “Korea? Are you from Korea?”

She nodded a spark of understanding in her eyes “Korea! South Korea?” she said, in decipherable English.

I nodded “ok! South Korea, great! I'm from…” I thought for a second, it was in the United States but I couldn't remember just where “America…” I finally said.

“America?” She asked, slowly approaching me. Her words becoming clearer by the moment.

“Yeah.” I said, putting my hands in my pockets. I kind of instinctively backed away from her. I don't know just why. I was a whole head and a half taller than her and considerably stockier. Sopping wet this girl was probably 60 pounds. But I still regarded her with a level of mistrust 

“How… did you get… here?” She finally asked.

“I uh… I don't know, I just woke up here… you speak English?” I asked 

She shook her head “n-no… why are you just asking now? And why didn't you just try speaking Korean?”

I paused “c-cause I don't know Korean… you're speaking English… like right now right this second.”

She shook her head “no I'm not… you're speaking Korean…” she trailed off, putting a finger to her lips in contemplation. I stood there awkwardly watching her, when she finally said “there's some kind of… translation in this building… that's the only way we could be able to understand each other. Cause I've only ever learned English through movies, not enough to be conversational.”

I nodded “and I've never heard Korean before. At least not fluently. There's tourists every so often though.”

She looked at the floor, finger still at her lips, furrowing her brow in deep contemplation. Finally she looked up at me “do you remember anything about your life before coming here?” 

I shook my head “I remember TV, video games, and doughnuts and that's about it.”

“Same.” She said “so you don't remember what your job used to be?”

“Uh…” I thought “I guess not. You?”

She shook her head “no…” 

We stood there in silence for a minute. Both of us trying to make sense of what was happening. But how do you make sense of something so clearly senseless? I felt like I was going crazy, and it was at that point that someone else joined in. 

From a door that was snuggly located next to the elevator a man emerged, he was tall with a shaved head and a clean shaved face. He wore a track suit and upon seeing us said something in a language that I instantly recognized as Balkan. Ji stepped forward and tried conversing with him but it was no good. Whatever was translating took a second. Fortunately my grandma was Serbian so I knew like two or three words in the language. I tried saying what I knew which was “hello I am Jake, and you?” 

He looked at me instantly, “you speak serb?” 

I let out a sigh “oh good it kicked in.” He looked ate in utter confusion and I explained the situation. I'm not gonna talk about the explanation cause it's all stuff you know it already. All that really matters is we found out his name is Nikolai, 

“I don't understand what's happening.” He said sliding down the wall to sit on the floor. “I went to sleep at home and boom, I'm here.” He looked at his clothes “I don't even own a tracksuit!” With a sigh he shook his head and rubbed the stubble on the top of it. He looked at the two of us and asked “what apartment is yours?” I pointed to 4, Ji pointed to 3. Nikolai nodded “and I'm in 5… so we're neighbors then.”

At that moment I remembered the cell phone, pulled it out, and hit the contact info for neighbor 2 there was a buzzing in Nikolai’s pocket and he looked at me quizzically. “So you're neighbor 2”, I said. I turned to Ji “you must be neighbor 1” Ji pulled the phone from her pocket as Nikolai did the exact same, apparently unaware that there was a phone in his pocket the whole time. “So we all have each other's numbers then. None of us know how we got here, none of us can really remember anything before we got here, and none of us know how to get out of here… great.” I rubbed the bridge of my nose as I paced back and forth. 

“What's in there?” Ji asked to try and move things along. Nikolai looked up,

“Staircase.” He said “I've been going up this thing for a while now, I never found the bottom. As far as I can tell the elevator and staircase is endless.”

I looked up at him, my brain suddenly working. “Well I know for a fact the elevator ends, I've been to the lowest floor it can go to.” 

His eyes narrowed at me “how did you get the elevator to work? I pressed the down button an hour ago nothing happened.”

“Thats probably because I was on my way up, or down. Sorry about that.” I said “but no the elevator has an end. I hit the lobby button and it took me to the bottom. It's like a kind of… entry way, visitors center, rec… room combo? I don't know it's hard to explain you kinda gotta see it.”

Ji nodded “alright let's go see it.” Nikolai and I looked at her, in confusion. “What? If the elevator has an end then the stairs must as well, it's only logical.”

“Well… the only door leads to the other tower.” I said “and I stopped just short of going to it. And it didn't even take me to the ground floor I was still all the way up in the air.”

“so stands to reason the stairs DO continue…” Ji said , rubbing her eyes. She took her hair down and then put it back up, tighter this time. “Well… in any case I think it's still a good idea to see the lobby stairs and at least see how far down they go.”

“Maybe we drop something to see if we can hear it hit the ground.” Nikolai suggested. He looked at me “what's heavy down there that we can drop?”

“Way ahead of you. There's a gym down there. Bound to have some dumbbells in there.” I said.

“Alright we have a plan” ji said walking to the elevator. She hit the down arrow and the doors slowly opened. Nikolai and I looked at each other, and both silently entered after Ji. 

The elevator ride was just as long as last time, maybe magnified because suddenly I was trapped with two other people and none of us exactly smelled like roses. When we got to the bottom we all took a deep breath and had a moment where we were standing farther apart. I'm not sure but I think someone let a few garly farts out. I hate elevators. 

Nikolai turned to the door on the left side of the elevator and opened the door. Ji followed me to the gym where I picked up a fifty pound dumbbell. I'm not gonna lie and say I wasn't trying to impress her a little, but also the bigger the weight the bigger the boom when it hits the floor. We made our way out and to the stairwell.

The three of us piled into the dimly lit stair well and descended one flight of stairs so we cleared the bottom of the elevator. Looking over the railing it became clear to me then that this staircase may have been truly infinite. A great black chasm stretched far past the meager light cast over head where each stair looked like spirals of teeth in the gaping maw of some unknowable thing. It was waiting. Hungry for some poor soil stupid enough to enter willingly. Or something. I don't know. 

All I know is that I lifted the dumbbell over the railing and dropped it. I didn't hear anything after that, not immediately afterwards and not after about five or six minutes. With every passing moment Ji’s expression went from curiosity to the horrifying realization that this building, these stairs specifically, violated any kind of physical law; and maybe even some metaphysical ones. Nikolai let out a deep breath. As though confirming it to himself that he was, in fact, not crazy. 

I didn't know what to think. After about twenty minutes of waiting I stepped out of the stairwell. Ji followed behind me, pale as a sheet, while Nikolai rubbed the fuzz on the top of his head. I wandered around the lobby until I found a bar where I sat down. The bar was called “Fanny O'Malley’s Irish Pub” and I immediately started guzzling a Pabst. Ji and Nikolai weren't far behind. 

Nikolai got straight to drinking while Ji remained deep in thought. I looked at her, took a big swig, and said “lemme guess… we gotta go down there don't we?” With a deep exhale she nodded, “but that staircase is likely infinite isn't it?” She nodded again. “And there's no telling what we'll find down there or if we'll even be able to get back up here after a certain poi-” 

“Yes!” Ji snapped, a clear hint of panic in her voice.

The room went quiet for a second. “Point…” I finished before having some more of my beer. We sat in the bar for a little while, trying to figure out what to do in the immediate future, and eventually we just decided to go back to our floor. And so another agonizingly long ride up we were all back on our floor. Everyone followed me into my apartment, I didn't invite any of them in but who cares after a certain point.

We've spent the last four hours detailing our expedition down the stairs. Ji is asleep on my couch, Nikolai is passed out on the floor. I'm about to fall asleep myself. It's still dark here, I don't know how that's possible cause it feels like it's been way longer than a normal day. 

I don't know what I'll find down there, or if I'll ever come back. If I never make it out of here, at least it made for a mildly interesting story.
