When Mike died, something in me changed forever. It’s hard losing a brother, let alone a twin. So when I had the big breakdown in May, my parents understood. My sweet, compassionate mother and I have always had an understanding: If things ever got bad for me, I would have the option of moving to her hometown for a bit to recover.

Honestly, it’s weird it took me so long to take her up on her offer. Her side of the family is troubled, to say the least. Everyone was surprised that my “breakdown” consisted of just quitting my job and showing up at Mom’s house drunk. Most of my relatives had more of the “high and delusional” kind of crash.

But they all got better, after Mylae.

I can’t explain it. It just heals us. I’ve watched Uncle Dean go from armed crackhead to successful realtor in a span of months.

Mom had our relatives fix up a room for me in the old part of town. Blue paint. Supposed to be calming. It looked like the color of the sea from the postcards. I didn’t speak a word of Italian, and I was worried about the language barrier, but thankfully, everyone left me alone. People knew why I was there. They nodded and smiled at me on the street. They were nice.

I spent the first couple of days exploring. Mylae was so beautiful. Everyone says it’s the air, or the quiet, or the sea salt that sticks to your skin like a second layer of hope. But that’s not it. For me, it was the sun. I could have basked in it for hours. I probably did. Time moves slowly in Mylae.

I began to actually think about my brother. I would be sitting on the beach and catching glimpses of Mike while watching the men swim.

His face would replace theirs for a split second, smiling as always, while his body stayed hidden in the sea. But it wasn’t real. It was just the grief. Sometimes “He” waved at me, and I couldn’t help but cry about it.

Glimpses turned into hallucinations, or dreams, or nightmares. Mike chased me without running. He was in the midst of the crowd. He watched me from the boats. He whispered in my ear when I forgot to buy something. He directed me toward the best spots for picking olives. Always so far yet so close, he slipped through the cracks of my mind whenever I acknowledged his presence. I would yell his name in vain. Trying to make him come back. But he would never answer me.

In my dreams, I kept climbing stairs, but every floor was a different summer from our childhood. Every door was locked. Some mornings I’d wake up with my voice raw, like we’d been talking all night. But I could never remember what we said.

Days folded in on themselves. Whole weeks repeated, the same vendors in the square, the same song from the café. No one else seemed to notice. I noticed I’d learned Italian, but my words weren’t understood. Everyone acted like whatever I’d seen was completely normal. No one understood what the big fuss I was making was about.

One day at a time, I slowly took up drawing. Mostly, I drew Mike. Sometimes I would fall asleep with the pencil in my hand, and I would wake up to beautiful portraits of me on the paper. Then it happened. I was waiting for it. I was desperate for it. While asleep, I drew something new.

It was the entrance to the cemetery. A tall iron gate framed by stone columns. The higher parts of them had Latin phrases engraved on the surface. “Pax. Omnia Traham.” Peace. I’ll attract all. Fitting.

So I went.

The gates were like I’d drawn. Wrought iron, taller than life, framed by pale stone columns. The Latin words engraved at the top shimmered under the sun.

The air changed the moment I stepped through.

It didn’t feel like a graveyard. It was like a sleeping city.

The chapels sprawled across the hill: marble, sandstone, and concrete. Some from the 1600s, looking untouched. Others new, glassy, almost modernist. Each one was unique, it seemed built with care. Entire families resting together, names carved into facades like storefronts. I passed by a chapel with stained glass windows of forget-me-nots, and another shaped like a Romanesque basilica. They lined narrow paths, they were homes in a silent neighborhood. The stillness had weight.

And the statues.

They weren’t the usual angels or grieving women. They looked like people. Real, soft, genuine people. Faces with wrinkles, moles, smirks, double chins, sad eyes, crooked teeth, or bony shoulders. One looked like a teenage boy playing cards. It was eerie and beautiful and unbearable.

I kept walking. And walking. And walking. I didn’t know what I was looking for, but I felt him before I saw him.

My brother was washing his hands at a wall fountain. They were full of fresh dirt. “Mike?” I asked. But I knew.

He turned. Same soft grey eyes. Same wavy hair. Older, somehow. But it was him.

“Hey,” he said. Quiet. Like he didn’t want to wake the dead. Or me.

My feet moved on their own. I didn’t know if I was dreaming. It didn’t matter.

“I’ve been trying to look at you,” I said. My voice cracked.

“I know.”

“You’ve been everywhere. I was going insane.” Tears welled up.

“You weren’t. Mylae… makes it easier. For me to stay a little longer. But it’s not supposed to last.”

He gestured behind him. A grave had opened in the dirt. I didn’t look.

“I don’t understand,” I said. I did.

“You came here to get better,” he said. “To let go.”

I shook my head. “You want me to bury you again?”

“No. Not bury. Release.”

He stepped closer.

“You’re keeping me here. Every time you remember my face and hold onto it like it’s a wound. Every time you beg the ocean to send me back. I feel it. I want to stay. But it hurts. It’s not life. It hurts. Please.”

I wiped my face, suddenly aware I was crying again. Harder than I had in months.

“You were half of my heart” I said. “I don’t know who I am without you.”

“I know. But you’ll find out. I’ll still be part of it. Lighter.”

“I’ll always be your brother” he said. “But I can’t be your ghost. Let me go. You have to.”

I started to sob.

“Please stay. Just a little longer.”

He didn’t say anything.

He stepped into the grave himself. No drama. No fear. Like lying down to rest.

“I don’t want to forget you.” I said one last time.

“You knew you’d have to if you came here. Tell Uncle Dean that Aunt Becks says hi.”

I nodded. Then, trembling, I began to cover him. A handful of dirt. Another. The last time I’d touched him, it had been in a hospital bed. This felt gentler. Stranger. Final.

By the time I finished, the sun was setting.

My hands were stained. The wind had picked up. But it didn’t howl. It sang.

I drove home under the stars. And this time, I didn’t see his face in the shadows.

I’m starting to forget. I had to write. I had to tell someone. Someone has to know what happens in that small corner of the world. I loved Mike so much, but he was right. He had become my ghost.

We come to Mylae to heal. We come here to forget. I don’t know if it’s wrong. But love is such a painful feeling when the person we give it to dies. So much love and nowhere to put it.

I’ll put it towards myself.

Maybe I’ll finally buy a restaurant.

I have a name already. I’ll call it Mike’s.

Wait.

Why would I call it Mike’s?
