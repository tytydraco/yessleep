I'm begging you. Please, if you ever get an SMS from an unknown number, don't block it.  
It can sound odd because SMS's are the most outdated thing that still exists inside cell phones, but please, just ignore the message. You can even delete the chat. You can never read it, and just let it disappear inside all your daily notifications. You can continue living, and you will forget all about it in a few days. Don't let it ruin your life. Don't let a random SMS with strange content ruin a life full of hope like yours.  


I'm sorry for any mistake I could make writing in this language. English isn't my native language, and I'm using it only because I hope it will help me reach more people. I don't want anyone living the same nightmare I'm living in this moment. My human decency doesn't let me stay silent about it.   


Well, I will be fully honest. Technically, after receiving the message, you have two valid options: the one I beg you to take and the one that introduces you deeply inside the game they're trying to make, but at least makes them look at you with good eyes. You can ignore the message, or you can reply to it. Write whatever you want. Say "hi," "no," or send a dick pic. Anything you reply back will bring you the same fate. They don't look at the content; they just appreciate the action. After that, they will make their next move.  
I'm not here to talk about the game. I don't want you to feel interested in it at all; that's not why I'm here. I'm here to warn you.  


Let's put you in context. Imagine that you're walking home after a long and hard day at work. You put a cigarette between your lips, breathe deeply, and close your eyes. You feel kind of bothered and angry because you are exhausted, and anything can put you on your nerves. You just want to arrive home and sleep, but your phone makes that annoying noise that lets you know you just received a message. You ask yourself why can’t you die already to finally be able to rest, but you still open the notification.  


An unknown number, one that looks like the number your aunt from the countryside could have, has sent you a strange message. What's written creeps you out a bit and you aren't in the mood to reply or tolerate any shit coming from anyone, so you block the number and forget about it in the following minutes.  
You think that your life will continue as always; you think about the next day; you make plans. You think about the people you love or hate. You think about a show you plan to start that night. Nothing of that matters anymore. You have taken action. You just interacted with them, and not how they wanted you to. The game just started, and you are naive if you expect any chance of surviving.  
They… enter in your thoughts. They turn your brain upside down, they’re going to make you feel crazy at first, and, as weird as it sounds, this may be out of pity. Maybe they want you to kill yourself before they get you, like a last chance for peace.   
I might take this chance. I want peace, I want… I want it to end. Will death save me? I’m tired.   
Please, please, please. I’m about to die. Take my words as the last wish of a dying person. Ignore any number you don’t know, keep on living your life to the fullest, be happy, and don’t reply to any weird SMS’s coming from someone you might not know. And, of course, don’t block that number. Don’t block that number.   
Don’t block it.   
Dont bl0ck itt
