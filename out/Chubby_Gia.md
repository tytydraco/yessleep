Gia was a beautiful, petite girl who lived a life of luxury. She got her beautiful looks from her mother. Her wealthy and well-known family provided her with everything she could ever want: a loving family, a beautiful bedroom, and numerous Barbie toys. However, everything changed abruptly one night when Gia's mother took her own life, just two days after Gia's eleventh birthday.

The family’s tragedy led to rampant gossip, but Gia, being homeschooled, was largely unaware of the outside world’s whispers. She noticed the profound silence that settled over her home and the sadness in her father’s demeanor. Her father, now her sole caregiver, did his best to educate and care for her, teaching her simple words and mathematics, and ensuring she was well-fed.

One night, Gia woke up from a terrifying nightmare, drenched in sweat and filled with fear. She ran to her father's bedroom, crying. Her father comforted her, but she could see the worry in his eyes. These nightmares continued every night, always featuring a shadowy, faceless figure. Gia became increasingly anxious and scared to sleep.

In an attempt to avoid sleeping, Gia stayed up one night, staring at the ceiling. Her father came in, asking if she couldn’t sleep, and she ran to him, finding comfort in his presence. The next day, her father gave her a jar of her favorite gummy-shaped bunny sweets. Gia noticed that eating these sweets seemed to keep the nightmares away, leading her to believe that eating a lot was the cure. Every night before bed, she ate a large amount of food and no longer experienced nightmares.

Over time, Gia became noticeably chubby. Despite her father's warnings to not eat so much, her fear of the nightmares returning kept her eating excessively. One day, Gia's aunt Ellen, who was visiting from abroad for business, was surprised by Gia’s chubby appearance but still found her adorable. Ellen visited often and brought Gia more sweets.

However, one day Ellen found Gia vomiting in the sink and became worried. She called Gia’s father, who rushed home. Ellen suggested taking Gia to a doctor, but Gia was too scared and refused. Ellen decided to stay a bit longer to monitor her condition.

Tragically, five days later, Gia's father was found dead from an apparent suicide. Gia was now alone and Ellen adopted her. The police investigation revealed that Gia’s father had been poisoned, and the same poison was found inside the house, confirming it as a suicide.

Gia's health continued to decline; she vomited frequently, possibly from overeating, and began to lose weight, though her belly remained distended. Ellen went to Gia’s house to collect her belongings and found Gia's diary. It was filled with cute and emotional entries about her family and how lucky she felt. Among the pages, Ellen found a note written by Gia's mother. Gia had kept it because it was from her mother, but she couldn’t read it at the time.

The note was a suicide letter from Gia's mother, revealing a horrifying truth: Gia's father was actually her own father, a psychopath obsessed with Gia's grandmother, his previous wife. After his wife died from cancer, he impregnated his daughter, Gia's mother, because she reminded him of his late wife. Traumatized by this realization, Gia's mother took her own life.

Ellen was shocked and disturbed by this revelation. She returned home to Gia, hugged her tightly, and cried. Ellen planned to keep the truth from Gia to protect her from further trauma. But then Gia passed out. Ellen rushed her to the hospital, where doctors confirmed that Gia, at the age of thirteen, was pregnant.

The police found gummy sweets that could make a person sleepy next to Gia's bed and in her father’s room. They also found numerous pictures of Gia, her mother, and her grandmother, all bearing a striking resemblance to each other.
