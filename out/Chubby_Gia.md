Gia was once a beautiful, petite girl. Her family is wealthy and well-known. She had everything every little girl wanted. A loving family, a beautiful bedroom, numerous Barbie toys, you name it. Until everything changed, one night gia's mother unalived herself out of the blue. Although two days before that incident, gia just turned eleven. People would gossip about her family. Gia on the other hand was innocent from everything since she is homeschooled she barely know the world outside. Her home was now quiet, despite being young she could see that her father was sad just from his expression and how silent he was. All she have is her father. Her father took care of her, educating her simple words and mathematics, feeding her like a normal father would do.

Although one night, gia had a nightmare, she woke up all sweaty and scared. She ran to her father's bedroom and cried. Her father comforted her and he looked worried. These nightmares would go on night after night, gia couldn't explain why and what her nightmare was like, but it's always someone, with a shadow figure and no face. Gia became so anxious and scared to go sleep that one night she stayed up late, quietly staring at the ceiling. Her father entered her room asking if she couldn't sleep, she immediately ran towards him feeling comfortable and safe. The next day, her father gave her a jar of sweets, gummy shaped bunnies, her favorite. After that, gia has been eating a lot, it seems to be making her nightmares go away. She believed that eating a lot is the cure for her nightmares. Every night before she sleeps, she eats a lot and waking up without having a nightmare.

She became chubby, her father tells her to not eat too much but she was anxious, what if her nightmares comes back? She didn't listen. One time, gia's auntâ€”Ellen from abroad came there for business reasons and decided to check gia since she just heard that gia's mother was dead. Ellen was a bit surprised to see how chubby Gia was now. She still loved her, she thinks gia looks even more adorable. She would visit often, bringing gia sweets. But one day, Ellen visited gia and she saw her vomiting on the sink. She was worried and called gia's father who rushed back home. Ellen suggested to visit a doctor but gia herself didn't want to because she was scared. She didn't want to force her so she stayed a little bit longer to check on her.

Unfortunately, 5 days later, gia's father was found dead, it was possible suicide. Gia was now alone and Ellen adopts her. The police are still investigating her father's case and they found out that it was poison that killed him, they also found the same poison inside so it was declared as suicide. Gia became weaker everyday, continuously vomiting maybe from eating too much. While Ellen visited her house to move gia's things to her home, she saw gia's diary, she decided to open and read it. It was cute and emotional, gia has written and drawn her and her family, talking about how lucky she was to have this life and how she loved her mother, but as she flipped to this specific page, she sees a paper with writings, in that page gia said that her mother gave her that paper but she didn't understand it very well since she couldn't read it so she kept it because it's from her mother. The paper was from her mother, Ellen realize that it was gia's mother's death letter before committing suicide. She said that she just realized that her husband was her own father, a psychopath who's obsessed with her previous wife, which is gia's mother's very own mother, gia's grandmother. The father was reminded of his wife because of her daughter because they look alike so he impregnate her after his wife died from cancer. Gia'a mother was so traumatized that she unalived herself.  Ellen was so shocked and disturbed. 

She went back to her home where gia is. She hugs gia and cried for her. She was planning to keep the truth from her so she won't be traumatized but then gia passes out. Ellen rushed her to the hospital and the doctor confirmed that gia was pregnant at the age of thirteen.
