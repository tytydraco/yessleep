This happened a week ago, and I still can’t believe it at all. If anyone here knows anything about what happened to me, please let others know. 

Let me start from the beginning. I had hit the road while it was still light out with a random assortment of clothes and toiletries thrown into the backseat of my car. I just… had to escape, y’know? My boyfriend started drinking again, and when he gets drunk he gets angry and starts putting holes in the drywall. I didn’t want to be one of those women who stay even when things get that bad and end up dead, so when he left to get more alcohol from the liquor store around the corner, I grabbed what I could and ran. 

We were living in Sedona, Arizona, far from my nearest family in Oklahoma City. I didn’t have much money to spare, but I figured I would have just enough for the gas to get me there. At around 6pm, I started the long drive home. 

The first few hours were uneventful. Once I got out of the city it was miles and miles of dry desert road. I was blasting the AC and listening to the radio to keep sane- the very first thing I did when I left was turn my phone off to avoid even seeing the inevitable onslaught of calls and texts from my ex demanding I come home. I had tossed it in the backseat and tried to not think about the one tether I still had to him. 

The sunlight slowly dwindled away, until all I was left with were my headlights and a sky full of stars. I didn’t want to turn my brights on to blind any drivers coming the other way even though the new moon wasn’t providing any light, which is probably why I didn’t see the… whatever it was before I ran right into it. 

I had a split second to notice something had run into my path before I felt a sickening THUD against the hood of my car. I screamed and hit the brakes, throwing everything in my backseat onto the floor. It got sent flying and rolled to a stop several yards away, just out of the range of my headlights. I could vaguely make out a lumpy shape, like a person wearing a big robe or blanket or something.  

The only thing I could hear for the first few seconds was the sound of my own heavy breathing. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck was the only thing I could think. I just killed somebody, I thought, and then immediately tried to rationalize a way out of that thought. 

It’s probably a coyote. No, too big. A mountain lion then. Still bad, but it made more sense and gave me more peace than the idea that I hit a lone hitchhiker out in the middle of nowhere.  

All these thoughts occurred in the span of a few seconds before I realized I could turn my brights on to get a better look at it. I braced myself before flicking them on, and the white light briefly blurred my vision before my eyes settled on the figure I had hit.  

It was big, and splayed out on the asphalt, its body contorted and broken. I could make out leaking blood coming from somewhere, pooling on the road ahead of me. And guts. The force of the impact or the skidding across the road must’ve torn open its stomach. What it was, I still couldn’t say. Its head was hidden behind its large form, at least half the size of my sedan, and I could make out what looked like black fur covering most of its body, and a tail that snaked out beyond the light from my headlights. It was also long-limbed, and the one appendage I could make out with any clarity ended in a skinny paw tipped with long, jagged claws.  

 

My realization that it was not a human being I had just killed wasn’t as relieving as it should have been. The fact that I couldn’t make out what the hell this thing was freaked me out almost more than the impact had, and I nearly lost my lunch right then. The blinking warning signs on my dashboard tore my eyes away from its splayed guts and back to the reality that my car was probably just as fucked as the creature. My foot was still mashing the brakes into the floor, so I put the car into park and eased off, removing my shaking hands from the wheel as well. I also dimly realized that I was bleeding from smashing my nose against the wheel, but the hurt was a dull ache thanks to the rush of adrenaline and anxiety.  

I had little hope that my phone would have any cell service out here, but I figured I should try. If it failed, I’d have to drive my car off the road and across the cracked desert ground to get past its body, since it was blocking most of the two-lane road. 

Something in me didn’t want to take my eyes off of the thing, but my phone had surely fallen onto the floor during the crash. I tried blindly pawing for it to no avail, so I unbuckled my seatbelt and turned to sift through my junk to find it.  

I felt a slight lurch in the car as my hand made contact with the phone and whipped my head back around to see that the thing was… closer. By at least a few yards, now well within the range of my regular headlights. Still in the same mangled position, though now I could see it more clearly. What I thought was fur was just mottled grey-black skin, and what I thought was a tail was actually one of its… arms? legs? It was too bent and mangled to tell. My car lurched again and I slammed on the brakes, but couldn’t figure out how I moved that close without noticing. I wasn’t looking away long enough for the movement to be gradual enough not to notice. Oh god, was it alive? had it moved, somehow crawling forward while remaining in the same broken pose? 

My hands shook even more as I attempted to dial 911 three times, not daring to take my eyes off of the thing. To my surprise and relief, the line actually started ringing, and an operator picked up soon after. 

“9-1-1, what’s your emergency,” a man’s crackling voice rang out.  

“Uhm, I’m out on the road like an hour or two from the last gas station and I can’t remember the last town I passed, but I just hit a big animal that’s blocking the road ahead and I’m not sure if my car will be able to go off-road to pass it.” 

“Ma’am, are you injured, or is your car smoking?” 

“I’m bleeding from my nose hitting the wheel but it’s fine,” I said, not wanting my injury to slow down a response- I figured paramedics would take longer to get here. “My car isn’t smoking but the check engine light is on and I think there’s a problem with the brakes.” I thought of the car lurching closer to the creature, how I didn’t even notice how close I got.  

“Ok ma’am, we're getting your location on GPS and sending an officer out to help yo-” the line went static for a brief, terrifying moment, but returned quickly and thankfully became clearer. “-and can you tell me what animal you hit, and can you confirm that it’s dead?” Unfortunately, the questions shook me out of my relief, because I couldn’t confidently answer either one.  

“I think it’s a bear. But, it has a tail I think, and its limbs are too long. And I can see its guts, so I’m pretty sure it's dead, yeah.” Regardless, I answered with my best guess, knowing I could be wrong about both. 

“Are you able to step outside of your vehicle and make sure?” the man said.  

“Wh… what? Why?” I asked, thoroughly confused. Why would he ask me to do that? And why was I so resistant to the idea? It was a dead animal, I’d seen and hit my share of roadkill before. This was definitely the biggest, though, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t all that dead yet. “I’d rather stay in my car, if that’s alright.” 

“It would just help the responding officer understand the situation better and how best to help you.” Was he being weirdly insistent or was I being obtuse? I couldn’t tell. 

“O-ok, just give me a minute.” In a daze, I put my hand on the car handle and began to slowly open it. That’s when I heard something underneath my car. 

A quiet, slow, scratching sound. Like something weakly pawing at the undercarriage.  

I froze with my hand on the handle just before I was about to unlock the door. Stretching out from the darkness was a long, skinny appendage coming from the same side of the road that the creature’s long leg went into. With my face pressed to the window, I could make out enough of the limb to know that it must’ve ended right underneath my car.  

It pulled me closer. The thought became unshakeable, no other more reasonable explanation fit in my head. It pulled me closer while I wasn’t looking. 

“Is everything alright? Were you able to step outside your vehicle to check on the creature?”  

“No. No, I think it’s best if I stay inside my car. It’s dark out there.” I found myself unwilling to tell the truth about what I saw for fear that he wouldn’t believe me. I could hardly believe what I was seeing, and I was the one that hit the damn thing.  

“Are you sure? There will be a delay in response time if you cannot tell us the nature of the creature. I will ask you once again to step outside of your vehicle.” He was definitely insistent that time, but there was no way in hell I was leaving this car. I triple-checked that the door was locked and said, “I am worried that the animal is still alive and might react if I open the door and step outside.”  

Terse, but I figured I’d save him the time in trying to convince me. The thought of waiting here with this thing any longer than I had to was terrifying, but it was better than doing what the voice on the phone was telling me to. 

“Ok. See you soon.” click. The abrupt end of the call startled me, and the following silence was deafening. I kicked myself for not mentioning the limb, but every call I tried after that failed to go through. I turned my key halfway to turn the engine off, but kept the lights on. I figured I’d still need the car to be able to move after this ordeal was over, and probably couldn’t expect a tow truck at this time of night.  

I barely blinked for the next hour, staring at the creature before me, watching its blood continue to leak out and its guts sag in the cool desert air. They looked weird- I guess I’d never seen a living thing’s insides before this close, but they were so brightly colored, and my headlights were reflecting off of something shiny in the middle of the viscera. I kept one eye on the limb that was underneath my car. It never moved an inch, but the soft, nearly inaudible scratching filled my ears during the wait in the deafening silence. Now that my engine was off, it was painfully audible. 

I glanced at my phone a few times to check the time- 3:45 AM, 4 AM, 4:30 AM until finally I saw lights in my rearview mirror. I scrambled to turn the lights on in my car so he could see me inside, and as the car came to a stop a few yards behind mine, I held up my hands in a ‘wait’ gesture and pointed to the ground beside my door as best I could, hoping he would see it clearly in the light of his headlights. However, when I looked at it myself, the limb was gone.  

The officer either didn’t interpret my hand signs, or didn’t care. He stepped out of his car and began to walk across the road to me. I noticed that he turned his car off but left the lights on and his hazards up, and it struck me that no other cars had driven down this road the entire time I’ve sat here, waiting. A blessing in disguise, I thought to myself, that no one else had to deal with what happened next. 

When he was halfway between his car and mine, the limb snaked out from the darkness and a clawed hand latched onto his leg, and even through my closed doors I heard a sickening crack as his bone shattered under its grip. He barely had time to scream in pain before the hand whipped him into the darkness.  

The shock and horror froze me for a few seconds, as I desperately tried to search the darkness for any sign of him before realizing I hadn’t looked at the creature in too long. I tore my eyes from the darkness and looked ahead of me. 

It was standing, now. Its guts still hanging from its torn open stomach, the thing was at least three times the height of my car, covered in its own blood and viscera. Its face was out of view, far over the height of my lights and the roof of my car, and now I could see that it wasn’t big like a bear, but instead coiled around on itself, like a human stretched out with its arms and legs and torso all at different lengths.  

Its arm was what had snatched the officer away, and I heard a loud squelch as it began to almost reel it into its body. The officer came back into view quickly, as the monster raised him up by his crushed leg. The officer was screaming in pain, and all I could do was watch in horror as he was raised ten feet off the ground and towards this thing’s face.  

Somehow, the officer still had some of his bearings, because he had managed to unholster his gun. He unloaded into the monster’s chest, the shots ringing out across the barren desert. In response, the thing threw the officer against the ground hard and let out an unholy screech, louder than the gunfire, louder than anything I’ve ever heard. It was almost like an inhale, sucking in all other sound until the only thing reverberating off of the distant mountains was a dull, inverted roar that crackled at the edges like static. No- that was my radio, crackling to life somehow and reverberating this thing’s scream. 

The whole thing transpired in under a minute, and I don’t think I stopped screaming until just then, when I saw the cop’s body flung like a ragdoll onto the side of the road, a lane away from my car. His leg was definitely broken, and he might’ve been knocked unconscious by the throw. I only spared him a glance, but when I looked back at the monster, it was turning away and retreating from the light of my brights, long limbs clutching its bleeding chest and holding its hanging guts.  

Seconds that felt like hours passed as I sat there paralyzed, staring at the darkness and willing this nightmare to be over. I hoped to god that it was gone, bleeding and dying and deciding I wasn’t worth the trouble. That thought reminded me of the man who I hadn’t even looked at yet, who might still be alive. 

He was still crumpled against the asphalt, face down. Arm bent at a weird angle, leg absolutely mangled. I couldn’t just leave him there, but stepping outside meant risking that thing coming back for me. I decided to crack my window and try to get the officer’s attention. 

“Officer!” I whisper-yelled, “Are you ok? Are you still alive?” 

A brief moment passed with no response, and then I heard a labored grunt and saw him move. I felt awash with a mixture of relief that he was alive, and a feeling that if he wasn’t, I could’ve justified starting my car and leaving him there. Not a feeling I’m proud of, but I shook it quickly and said, “Can you get inside? That- that thing, I think it’s gone.” 

Another grunt, and then I heard his voice barely above a whisper, say, “Don’t- don’t leave your car. I think I can… fuck. My leg’s fucked. Just… unlock your car. I’ll crawl as fast as I can inside, and then we have to go.” 

“Ok, ok. I’ll unlock it when you get close.” I was still unwilling to take any risks. The officer rose to one hand and one knee, the other leg dragging behind him and the other arm hanging limply. Slowly, painfully, he made his way across the road to me. While he did that, I turned my key over and over, the engine spluttering and dying each time while I kept my head on a swivel, watching everywhere for the monster to come back. When he was only a few feet away, I saw something at the edge of the light cast by the cop car. 

The hand was back. And it wasn’t moving. He was nearly to my car door, and it was there, waiting. That’s the only explanation. It could see us right now, and it was waiting for me to open my door to him.  

My car wouldn’t start anyway. We would both be dead in the water if I let him in. But his car still worked. There’s no way he could make it back there, not with how long it took him to even crawl across the road to mine.  

With my window still cracked, I whispered, “do you still have your car keys? Mine isn’t starting.”  

“Yeah, they’re still in my pocket, but I don’t know if I can get over there. Just let me in, before that thing comes back.” I looked back at the clawed hand, tensed and ready to pounce. I looked at the overwhelming darkness just beyond my brights, knowing that it was there, watching.  

“Officer… it’s already back. Behind you, its arm is there. I think it’s waiting for me to open the door for you.” I couldn’t lie to him, but maybe he’d understand. “I need you to get your car keys out and toss them to me. I can make a break for it, and drive back to town and get help. It isn’t attacking you- maybe it’s afraid of the gun? Please, I need to get out of here.” My pleas came out in a desperate tumble. Looking back, I was practically begging him for permission to leave him here to die. 

He stopped crawling. Wordlessly, he slowly reached into his pocket and pulled out the car keys. Then, he reloaded his gun, painfully slow with only one good hand, and positioned his flashlight on the ground facing towards the hand. 

“I’m gonna toss these on the ground in front of your door,” he said. “Then, I’m gonna turn ‘round and fire at it. That’ll give you a chance to get to my car and drive away whichever direction is safest.” He spoke like a man digging his own grave. 

“Thank you, god, thank you. I’ll call for help as soon as I’m clear.” It felt like I was the one killing him even as I thanked him. 

“On three. One, two… three!” he shouted, and everything happened at once. He tossed the keys, turned the flashlight on, and turned to fire two shots at the hand. The first one struck the asphalt, but the second one found its target. Two of its fingers were blown off, and it recoiled back in pain as I heard its rumbling screech begin to sound once more. Despite the volume, I could tell it was close. I didn’t have a choice, though. 

I leaped out of my car and snatched the keys, and made a break for the cop car only a few yards behind me. The monster’s scream was suddenly joined by the officer’s, and three more shots rang out by the time I reached the car. I opened the door and jammed the keys into the ignition, and chanced one last look at what was happening ahead.  

The monster’s other hand had speared through the officer’s chest, and was smashing him into the ground over and over, reducing his body to a wet pulp. In the headlights, I caught the briefest glimpse of its face for the first time. 

God. It looked like someone had carved a dozen holes into black rubber, and jammed eyes and teeth in at random. Part of it was scraped off, probably from the impact, and I could see more blood and muscle giving way to… whatever was underneath. It didn’t seem like bone- it was so reflective in the light that it nearly caught me off-guard. It was looking at me, tilting its head like I was something curious. It raised its injured hand and held it up to me, and I could see the bleeding stumps where two of its clawed fingers once were had something stringy that I now believe were wires coming out of them.  

The monster waved at me, and its hand shot out like a cannon, cracking the windshield with the impact. 

I threw the car into reverse and slammed on the gas, outspeeding it before the claw could get a grip on anything substantial. It tossed the officer aside like a rag and looked at me as I sped away backwards. Mercifully, it did not follow, and the light reflecting off its exposed skull was the last thing I could see in the distance before I turned the car around and continued as fast as I could towards town. 

With trembling hands, I dialed 911 once more. The officer was dead, no doubt about that, but I thought maybe they could block the road off, warn people, something.  

The call went through right away, didn’t even ring. Crystal clear, the same voice from earlier rang out. 

“9-1-1, what’s your emergency?” 

“Uhm, I called a while ago and you sent an officer out about me hitting an animal with my car.” I didn’t even know what to say. Would he believe me if I told the whole truth? I continued, “the officer you sent… he got injured. By the animal. And he-he told me to drive back without him, in his car.” Fuck, even I didn’t believe myself. 

“Did you get away? How far away are you from the animal? If the officer is injured, you need to go back for him and get out of your car,” said the voice.  

“No, I- what?” I said, thoroughly confused. “I’m not going back there, it’s dangerous.”  

“Then his blood is on your hands. Stop your car and step out of your vehicle so we can place you under arrest.”  

My blood ran cold. Why would he say that? What good would that do? I had begun to realize that something was not right about the times I’d called for help.  

“Why would you say that? Why do you want me to get out of my car?” My voice was hard, and I kept my grip steady on the wheel and pressed on the gas even harder. 

“You need to get out of your car,” he said, his voice growing both more insistent and more robotic. “Get out of your car get out of your car get out of your car get out of your car get out of-”  

I hung up and threw my phone into the backseat once more. I didn’t have a moment’s peace before the cop car’s mobile radio turned on and kept repeating the same words. I tried to turn it off, but only found the transponder. This wasn’t the police, it couldn’t have been. I thought back to its screech causing my own radio to freak out, the metallic sheen of its insides, the wires. 

I clicked the transponder on, and said, “I’m not getting out for you. I know it’s you, not the cops. Get out of the radio and leave me the fuck alone!” My voice was trembling, but it got the voice to pause its repetitions. For a moment, static silence filled the car. 

“See you on your way back, then.” Click. The lights went off on the radio, and all the communication devices stayed off for the rest of my drive back to town. The sun began to rise, but I didn’t risk stopping until all darkness was gone from the desert.  

I ditched the car on the side of the road not far from town and hitchhiked the rest of the way back. I eventually got back to civilization, and begged my family to scrounge up enough money to book a flight home. God knows I won’t ever make that drive again across that desert, or any driving through the night for probably the rest of my life.  

That officer died for me, and I left him there and didn’t even tell anyone what had happened, so I’m writing this now to warn people. If you ever find yourself crossing the desert past dark, drive slow and keep your eyes peeled. You never know what’s out there just beyond the reach of your lights.
