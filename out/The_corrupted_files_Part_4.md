A lot has happened since my last post, which is why I didn’t update you all yesterday. I’ll do my best to write everything down and catch you up. Some of you left really interesting comments under my last post—comments about things I’d honestly rather not think about—but for now, I’ll focus on what’s been happening.

After my sister and I finished talking about the man in the tapes, we just sat there in silence. I don’t know where her thoughts were, but mine wandered back to his face—the way he looked that day on the pier. I couldn’t shake the memory of his smile, the calm way he told me to go with my family. A kidnapper wouldn’t act that way. At least, not the kind of kidnappers you hear about on the news.

Maybe he was delusional. Maybe he truly believed I was his granddaughter. Or maybe he was a stalker—his appearance on those tapes would certainly suggest that. But at the time, I didn’t know what to think. Part of me wanted to piece it all together, but another part of me didn’t want to give those thoughts any weight. It was easier to let them sit in the shadows, unanswered.

It struck me then—I’d never shown my sister the tapes of the woman in the forest. There was a chance, however small, that she might recognize something about them. She was older than me, after all. Maybe she’d remember if they were from an old movie or something like that. It felt like a long shot, but it was worth trying.

I told her about the tapes, describing the strange, haunting scenes I’d watched. She frowned, her fingers drumming lightly against the table as she thought. “I don’t know any movie like that,” she said finally, “but maybe Camila would. She is attending to film school, remember?”

She was right, of course. If anyone would have an answer, it was Camila. Without wasting any more time, we called her, asking her to come back over so we could watch the tapes together. Maybe, just maybe, we’d find some answers.

The three of us sat down and watched the tapes together. I kept my eyes fixed on them, but part of me was more interested in their reactions—especially to the second video. The sudden boom made my sister flinch in her seat, her hand darting to her chest as if to steady herself. Camila, on the other hand, barely moved. She watched with sharp, unwavering focus, her expression unreadable.

When the screen finally went dark, Camila leaned back and thought for a moment before speaking. “It’s not from any movie I know,” she said finally. “If I had to guess, I’d say it’s something that woman made herself. Maybe some kind of... home video?”

The words hit me like a punch to the gut. The idea that the footage wasn’t staged, that I might have just watched something real—and possibly sinister—made my stomach churn. My sister shifted uncomfortably beside me, her unease plain on her face.

“There are also some corrupted files,” I said, breaking the suffocating silence. “I think there might be more videos on the pendrive, but they’re damaged.”

“Clara…” my sister started, her tone uneasy. She gave me that look—the one I knew so well, the one she wore every time she thought I was walking into something dangerous. “Maybe it’s better to leave it alone. The man who… took you, this woman on the tape… None of it feels right. And it’s been, what, thirty years since any of this was recorded? What’s the point of digging it all up now?”

Her words hung heavy in the air. I wanted to argue, to say it *did* matter. But part of me couldn’t help wondering if she was right.

“I could ask someone at my school to try fixing those corrupted files,” Camila said casually, brushing off everything my sister had just said. “Stuff like that happens all the time. Most of the time, there’s no way to recover them, but it wouldn’t hurt to try, right?”

Her confidence was almost reassuring, but I still turned to my sister. “Is that okay with you?”

She shrugged, her expression unreadable. “Mom found these tapes, didn’t she? As weird as all of this is, I doubt anything on those files could be worse than what we’ve already seen.” She sighed heavily, the tension evident in her voice.

Her words didn’t ease the weight in my chest. Logically, she was probably right. What were the chances the corrupted files held anything worse than that haunting second video—the woman in the woods, her terror and sobs, the sudden boom? And yet, some instinct, deep and unshakable, whispered that we hadn’t seen the worst of it. Something darker lay hidden, waiting.

When I got home, the familiar scent of something cooking greeted me. Lucas was in the kitchen, humming to himself as he stirred a pot. Dinner was already in progress, and for a moment, everything felt perfectly normal. We slipped into our usual rhythm, talking about the same things we always did—his work, my work, the neighbors who still hadn’t learned the concept of indoor voices, and the dream of a vacation we kept postponing.

But my mind was elsewhere, tangled in the truth my sister had dropped on me earlier that day. The man who wasn’t my grandfather. The story that unraveled everything I thought I knew. Part of me wanted to tell Lucas, to unload the weight pressing against my chest. But I hesitated. Acknowledging it felt like lighting a match near a pile of dry leaves. It would burn through our normal lives, leaving worry in its wake. His worry. And mine—the kind I’d rather keep buried.

Before I could make up my mind, my phone buzzed on the counter.

It was my dad.

"Hi, kid." For the first time since the day he left, my dad's voice sounded clear over the phone. Not muffled or distant, but familiar. Warm. I hadn’t realized just how much I missed him until that moment.

"Hey, Dad," I said, a little surprised. "Is something wrong?" It wasn’t like him to call; he usually just texted.

"Hey, Sergio!" Lucas chimed in from the kitchen, flashing a big smile. My husband always got along well with my dad, a rare feat among the boyfriends I’d introduced to him over the years. Lucas had been the first—and only—one he genuinely liked. They kept in touch regularly, bonding over potential business ideas and shared hobbies.

"Hey, Lucas," my dad replied, but his voice lacked its usual warmth. It wasn’t outright cold, but something felt off. He sounded distracted, maybe even reluctant.

"Clara," he said after a pause, "can we talk in private?"

The shift in his tone made my stomach tighten.

"Uh, sure, Dad. Give me a second." I glanced at Lucas, who raised an eyebrow in silent question. I forced a smile and excused myself, heading into the bedroom with the phone pressed tightly to my ear.

After closing the door, I leaned against it and took a deep, deliberate breath, filling my lungs as much as I could. My dad had always been a man of few words—not cold, exactly, but not one to linger on emotions or explanations. If there was a problem, he fixed it. No discussion of feelings, no analysis of the process, just action. He was a man of his time, pragmatic and straightforward. So for him to call, to actually *want* to talk about something... it unsettled me.

"Okay, Dad," I said, my voice steadying itself as much for me as for him. "I'm alone. Is everything okay? Do you need something?"

"Your mom told me she found some tapes," he began, diving straight in without preamble. "Said she took them to a store to... ‘virtualize’ them, or something like that." His tone was matter-of-fact but carried a faint edge, like he wasn’t quite sure how to frame what he was about to say. "She also mentioned you girls saw something strange—something about a woman in the woods?"

I froze. My fingers tightened around the phone. For a second, all I could focus on was the faint hum of Lucas moving around in the kitchen, completely unaware of the tension knotting itself tighter in my chest.

"Clara?" His voice cut through the silence, startling me. I hadn't realized how long I'd been quiet, lost in my thoughts.

"Yes," I replied quickly, trying to steady myself. "We saw that. The woman in the woods... and some old family videos." I moved to the edge of the bed, sitting down as if grounding myself would keep my nerves in check. "Is something wrong with it?"

"I see." His response was clipped, and then there was silence—save for the faint sound of him moving around on the other end of the line. His hesitation filled the air with a weight I couldn't shake. "It was just the one video of the woman? And the family tapes?"

He was fishing for something. That much was clear. The realization sent a sharp spike of anxiety through me. He knew more than he was letting on.

"Yes," I answered cautiously. Then, after a moment of hesitation, I added, "But I found a second video later. At my house. It came with a couple of corrupted files."

"You *what*?" His voice sharpened, and I heard the distinct sound of him freezing mid-movement. The air on the line seemed heavier, his breathing subtly deeper now. "And... did you watch that other video?"

"Yes." That was all I could say. Even if I’d wanted to tell him more, the words wouldn’t come.

On the other end of the line, there was nothing but silence. I could picture him standing in the middle of his New York apartment, staring at the floor, stroking his beard the way he always did when he needed to think.

"You and I need to talk about this," he said at last. His voice was steady, but there was a weight behind it that unsettled me. "I'll book a ticket and be there by the third of December, okay, honey?" I could hear the faint rustling of him moving around again, probably heading for his laptop.

The thought of him coming back stirred something bittersweet in me. I felt a flicker of happiness, but it was tangled with nervousness. "Okay," I managed.

"And, Clara," he added, his tone dropping an octave, becoming sharp and deliberate.

"Yes?"

"Don’t try to look into those corrupted files before I get there. Understood?" There was no room for negotiation in his voice. It was an order, plain and simple.

"Yes, Dad."

"Good." He paused, lingering for a moment. "I’ll see you soon."

We sat together in that silence, the space between us filled with things neither of us dared to say. Finally, he spoke again, softer this time. "I love you."

The words hit me harder than I expected. My dad wasn’t the kind of man to say those things lightly. A tear slipped down my cheek before I could stop it. "I love you too, Dad."

I was ready to end the call, my thumb hovering over the button, when a thought crossed my mind. It was intrusive, sharp, and impossible to ignore.

"By the way, Dad..." My voice was hesitant, but I pressed on. "How did Grandpa die?"

Silence. The kind that chills you, that stretches longer than it should.

"We’ll talk when I get there," he said at last, his voice flat, almost distant.

And then the line went dead.

After the conversation with my father, I returned to the kitchen. Lucas must have seen something on my face because he immediately rushed to my side, concern etched into his features. “Is everything okay? Did something happen to your dad?” he asked, his voice tinged with worry.

I shook my head, though the weight of the conversation still clung to me. “No, nothing happened to him. He’s fine. He’s just… coming back sooner than I thought.”

His brows furrowed in confusion. “Why?”

I realized then that I couldn’t keep it from him any longer. I needed to tell him everything. Taking a deep breath, I began. I told him about the man on the tapes, how my sister recognized him as the man who had kidnapped me when I was a child. How my parents had kept that secret from me for all these years.

Lucas didn’t interrupt, didn’t offer his thoughts right away. He just listened, his hand resting gently on my back, rubbing slow, comforting circles as I spoke. Encouraged by his quiet support, I continued, telling him about the videos of the woman in the forest, how my sister and Camila didn’t recognize them as part of any movie. How we all feared the same thing—that they might be real.

Finally, I told him about my father. About the way he seemed to already know about the tapes, how he had insisted I not touch the corrupted files until he arrived. As I spoke, the weight of everything began to feel a little lighter, though the questions swirling in my mind remained unanswered.

When I finished, I glanced at Lucas, expecting a barrage of questions or perhaps a look of disbelief. Instead, his hand paused on my back, and he pulled me closer, wrapping me in his arms. "We’ll figure this out," he murmured. “You’re not alone in this, Clara.”

I wanted to believe him. More than anything, I wanted to believe we could find the truth and still keep our lives intact. But deep down, I wasn’t so sure.

Three days later, I received an email from an unfamiliar sender. The subject line read: **"Regarding the Corrupted Files."** My stomach tightened as I clicked on it, an inexplicable dread pooling in my chest. The message read:

**"Dear Miss Franco,**

Your niece gave me a couple of corrupted video files and asked if I could recover them. I did as she requested, but when she came to pick them up, I asked her about their origin. She told me you had given them to her.

The content of these videos is something I wouldn’t recommend anyone watch. The image quality isn’t perfect, but it’s clear enough to understand what is happening.

That is why I insisted on getting your contact information instead of giving them back to your niece, she agreed.

Camila mentioned your family history and that her grandmother had found these old tapes in her house. After reviewing the files, I can tell you this: their content is deeply disturbing and tied to the darkest chapters of our country’s history.

The videos depict military officers torturing civilians. Based on the context and footage, I believe they document acts committed during the dictatorship, evidence of the desaparecidos, the people who were made to vanish under the military juntas.

I strongly urge you not to view the content of these files. Instead, I recommend reaching out to the Madres de Plaza de Mayo or a related organization that can help navigate this sensitive matter.

For legal purposes, I have attached the restored files to this email, though I sincerely hope you never need to open them.

I am deeply sorry.

Sincerely,  
Professor García"

I sat there staring at the screen, my heart pounding so loudly I could barely hear my own thoughts. My hand hovered over the attachments, but I couldn’t bring myself to click on them. The weight of what they might contain pressed down on me, crushing, suffocating.

That night, sleep evaded me entirely. My mind was a storm, thoughts swirling too fast to grasp, yet one rose above the chaos, clear and unrelenting.

My dad was arriving in the country that morning.

I couldn’t move, couldn’t bring myself to close my eyes. The weight of the email, the restored files, and the implications of it all pressed down on me like a suffocating blanket. The hours crawled by, and with each passing minute, the anticipation of his arrival grew heavier.

I didn’t know if I wanted answers or if I wanted to run from them. But one thing was certain: the morning would come, and with it, my father.
