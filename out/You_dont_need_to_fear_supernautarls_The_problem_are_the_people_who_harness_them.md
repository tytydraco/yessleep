Chasey smiles at me while she playfully stirs her cocktail with her finger. I smile back. I know what she is doing, I’ve heard about the nail polishes, which change color to reveal drugs in your drink. But she has nothing to worry about. At least nothing like that.

\-By the way, what are you studying? Sorry if you already said it, but I can’t remember. -she asks, looking deep into my eyes. She probably likes them. They are the only extra in my current form, green like the forest.

\-Informatics. It’s pretty boring, but at least it will give me a job. What about you?

\-I’m in a business class.

\-Oh, interesting. And what’s it like? -I ask, though I already know the answer.

\-Honestly, I hate it. But my father made it obvious that I have no other choice.

\-I’m sorry. But hopefully you’ll be able to do other things after you graduate. I mean he won’t be able to control you once you have a job. -it hurts to say this, as I’m well aware this is her last day on this Earth, but I have to play my role.

She smiles at me again, and leans closer as she starts talking about her hobbies. I listen carefully, memorizing all of her expressions. She is so kind, and so lively. I don’t know how I’ll be able to do this. Sometimes she asks about my interests, and I tell her the completely made-up life story of my current form. He’s name is Mark and honestly, he’s a fine guy. He looks good enough to catch your eye, but nood good enough to remember him. I would love to be Mark. Eventually, she stands up from her chair, her movement a bit dizzy. I jump up to help her. She laughs as I carefully hold her arm while she establishes herself.

\-Would you be a gentleman, and help this young lady get home? I don’t like being alone on the streets. -she says, with a shy little smile. The game of “don’t speak about the obvious” begins. I hesitate. I really don’t want to do this. My necklace gives me a slight shock. Of course, one of my owners is watching. They wouldn’t miss the show.  

\-Gladly. -I answer with a wide smile.

 

The cold, silent darkness of the street hits different after the changing colors, and soft music of the bar. Chasey leads me, although I know the way myself. I had to fly over it several times, so I won’t mess up. I slowly walk beside her, holding her hand, while her head rests on my shoulder. My necklace constantly gives me small pinches. They want me to remember what happens if I don’t obey. And yet, I know I still won’t. At least not completely. I can’t go fully against the order, as I’m not sure if I would survive it. I’m a useful tool, but not unreplaceable. So, as we get to the road closest to the edge of the town, I slow down.

\-Sorry, just my shoelace. -I say as I bow down. Chasey waits a few steps away.

I have to think quick. I choose the raptor. I can have the fastest kill with that. It’s a Utahraptor to be exact, but no one cares about that. The girl’s eyes widen, as my outlines blur, and I jump on her in this form. She doesn’t even have time to scream. A sickle claw to the hearth and it’s over.

 

Nearly immediately, my whole body bursts into pain, and a black suited figure steps out of the woods. The pain is unbearable. Sometimes its like thousands of cuts, then bug bites, then electricity, then bones breaking. I fall to the ground, while uncontrollably changing forms. A slim, red-haired girl. Then a bearded dragon. Then a toucan. A Shetland pony. A green tree frog. And old, bearded man. A secretary bird. An Irish wolfhound. All twitching uncontrollably in pain.

\-You fucking moron! I told you it has to be a bear attack! B-E-A-R! Don’t you fucking know what that means?! Little help, it’s definitely not an ostrich, or what the hell you morphed into. Now get the fuck up, and finish the job, or you can be a lab rat for another month. -when he finishes, he releases the button of the little, remote like device he’s holding, and the pain suddenly stops. Then, with a cruel grin, he presses it down again. This time its not unbearable, so I can work. I hate the bear. it’s clumsy and slow.

 

I don’t know how long it takes to make the body look like the victim of a bear attack. When it’s done, I morph back into my desired form. A Dobermann. As I’m only their dog. Well, not really. I think people treat dogs better, but I don’t know for sure. Then I’m led back to my travelling cage, in the back of a truck. We go to a building, where Will is waiting. He looks even more tired than usual. They probably overused him again. I slightly wag my tail when he takes my leash. He smiles for a second. We can’t greet each other in more expressive ways. Then, reality folds into itself around us, and we’re back at the headquarters.

 

This was the story of my last murder. I wanted to get it out of myself, but now I’m going to shed some light on the details. Maybe it will be easier for me now. I’m a shapeshifter. Well, you probably guessed that. I don’t exactly know how old I am, or who were my parents, but I think I’m in my twenties in human years. I don’t really have a gender either, but if it’s possible, I prefer a male form. The rules of shapeshifting are easy. I can’t do existing persons, but otherwise, pretty much anything I know the anatomy of. Modern animals? No problem. Extinct ones? Depends on how much we know about them. Bigfoot, or a unicorn? Piece of cake. Dragons? I did it once, after a year of preparing, and despite my wings, I still wasn’t able to fly.

For some of my life, I lived pretty normally. I was mostly Rebecca, a blonde woman in her thirties, working in a kindergarten. I loved working with children. That’s why I used a female form. It’s easier to get a job in those fields, and people won’t monitor you constantly. I was pretty good at my job. The parents always bragged how imaginative their kids are, showing me their drawings of animals and creatures, which were far more detailed than usual kid’s drawings at that age. And the kids loved me as well. When no one was around I would transform for them. Most boys of course wanted dinosaurs, while the girls loved the unicorn, which I made to be pony sized to be safe for them. When they grow up, they will think of it as overly vivid imagination, or some tricks, but at least their childhood was magical.

This was until one day, when an uncle came to a parent meeting. He said that he’s there instead of the kids’ dad, who usually visited the meetings, as he had some important office work, and couldn’t come. As a sign of their appreciation, he gave me a necklace. He said I’m the best teacher little Davey ever had, and he always talks about how much he likes when I play with him. I knew him. He was a shy boy, and he loved my deinonychus form. If the other kids were playing, he would often come, and just sit beside me, while I warmed him with my feathers, like a hen does with her eggs. He would always giggle, and cheer up when I did that. The necklace was beautiful. it was made of leather, and had a silver colored medal forming a turtle. I refused it first, but the uncle just kept saying how much the whole family appreciated my work, so eventually, I put it on. You can guess what happened after. They kidnapped me from my home. I couldn’t do anything. I can’t take the necklace off. If I try, it basically knocks me out.



Since then, I was used for many things. They ran some tests, but they were mostly just to break my spirit. Trying out the limits of my forms’ regeneration ability, by pulling out my nails, feathers or fur, or simply cutting off my limbs. Sleep deprivation. Beatings. Endless physical exercise. After I was obedient enough, they started with the real deal. They needed a well-mannered family dog of a politician to suddenly go berserk, and maul them? I was there. They needed the clickbait news to be about some bigfoot sighting instead of a drug deal? I was there. They needed a millionaire to be killed by a shark on a vacation? I was there. They needed the pet crocodile of a mafia leader to escape, and bite its owner in half? I was there. They needed a celeb, who spoke out for some minority, to be bitten by a snake on their hiking trip? I was there. They needed a fly on the wall of the president’s meeting room? I was there. They needed a pretty girl or boy to “relieve the stress after work”? I was there. And I was there when they needed the daughter of a CEO, who wouldn’t elaborate in some business, to be killed by a bear.

At first, whenever I could, I would rebel against them. The biggest one was the dragon incident. Some idiot wanted a dragon to guard some important documents or something in some basement. For two or three years. In complete darkness. I nearly lost my mind. The only thing what saved my sanity was that I figured out how to breathe fire. They didn’t know that until I burned two of them. I was a lab rat for a year after that, used for practicing drug effects, and amputation methods. But after a time, I mostly grew numb. Now I know I don’t really worth anything, so I only break their commands to make the deaths of the people I have to assassinate, less painful.

The reason I didn’t write about “them” in a more detailed way, is because I don’t know anything about them. Its probably some secret organization, but I have no idea who they work for. The only thing I know is that they collect people like me. Supernaturals. And they don’t go soft on any of them. Once I saw a large man beating a little girl unconscious, because she couldn’t make a piano levitate ten feet in the air. But the only other supernatural who I was allowed to be in contact with was Will. If we put it simply, he could teleport, and take a maximum of two people with him. He says the process is way more complex than this, but the point is, that he can travel impossible distances in a blink. But he has limits. Lots of them. Each teleport physically weakens him, and because of the way he’s made to use his power, he looks like a living skeleton. But he’s a good guy, and the sole reason I’m writing this.



Because Will managed to escape. He found a way to take off his necklace, and simply shifted away. They located him in an hour. He was in New Zealand. But, they couldn’t do more than that. I don’t even know how they managed to figure out this much. And you know who can smell out an escaped aspect? That’s right.

I was taken to a helicopter. As a dog, of course. Then, when we landed in some rural area, my handler pulled my leash, so I would focus on him.

\-You won’t get a sample. I’m sure you know the smell of that bastard. Find him and kill him. I don’t care how. If you try anything funny, you’ll be the practice dummy for the pyromancer, until you are no more than ashes. And I know you can’t be a phoenix.

I didn’t know if they really had a pyromancer, but I sure didn’t want to find out. So, I tracked. The necklace, now looking more like a collar, was giving me slight strangles ever so often, as I followed the familiar scent to an abandoned barn. As I stepped inside, once again, I switched to the Utahraptor.



Will was standing by the wall. I stopped. I didn’t want to do this. A wave of pain crawled over my body, and I took a step forward.

\-Mark, please, don’t do it! -Will’s eyes widened as he watched me walking closer, getting ready to pounce.

For a moment, I switched back to a human form. Mark.

\-You know I don’t have a choice. It’ll be fast, I promise. At least they can’t hurt you anymore.

Suddenly everything fell dark, as the doors of the barn closed behind me. I switched back, and I was able to see clearly in a moment. Will stepped toward me, whispering something. I leaned closer.

\-Listen, quick, we only have minutes. I know how to take off your necklace, but you have to trust me.

I froze. I didn’t even think about how he managed to escape. Warm hope rushed trough my body.

\-Okay, do it. -I said, after turning back into Mark.

\-Lay down. -he said, and I noticed he was holding a bottle in his right hand.

I did as he ordered, and nearly immediately, I felt something, burning like liquid fire, running down my neck. This was even worse than the shocks which the necklace caused. My body started jerking in unnatural positions, and I nearly transformed, but Will yelled, as he saw my outlines starting to blur.

\-Whatever you do, keep your form!

So, I tried. Weird, mechanical buzzing came from the necklace, and under the liquid fire, I felt it melting onto my skin. At the same time, a loud bang echoed on the door of the barn. The next moment, the door flung open, and a man stood at the entrance, with a gun pointing to us. Will grabbed my arm as the first bullet flew. I felt the reality unfold, and agonizing pain crashing into my left calf, just as we popped out somewhere else. As the trees towered over us, we both fell to the ground. Blood was pouring from my leg, and Will was looking like a corpse, plain, and barely breathing. He used his ability too soon. I changed to a different form, a large, black haired guy with a stupid little beard, and leaned over him. His eyes slowly opened, and he pressed some words out of his blue lips.

\-We are…. near a city. You….you….willknowwhichone. Takemeto……..

He finished the sentence, but I won’t share it, because I don’t want to give away any indicators of our location. And after that, he fainted, with a line of blood running from his left eye. I carried him to the location.



I don’t know how long it will take them to track us again, and what they will bring with themselves. Will’s a bit better now. He said that he will take us to someone, who knows how to make them lose us, but he can’t do that until next day, because he would kill himself otherwise. I don’t think we will make it until then. And even if we do, I have no idea how to stop them from tracking us again. In years, months or weeks. I mean, they managed to do it once, before knowing anything about me. And now they know most of my human forms. Either way, this will probably my last post. If we escape, I think my only chance is to never be in a human form again. And Will said, that if they find us before tomorrow, he will teleport. I will go with him. And then, I’ll turn into a bug, and fly into the first car I see. After all, the world won’t really lose anything with me.
