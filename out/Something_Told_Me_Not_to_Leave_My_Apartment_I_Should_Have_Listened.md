I didn't go to work that day.  Not because I was sick, or for the simple act of playing hooky; no, it was something else.  Even if I wanted to, I *couldn't.*  My doom sense was tingling.  It might sound silly, but let me explain.  



Growing up, my mother would occasionally have days that she would refuse to leave the house.  If asked, she would tell you that something bad was going to happen if she got dressed and walked out the door, even if it was just to get the mail.  That was her doom sense, a deep seated feeling in the pit of her stomach that portended some unseen calamity just beyond the boundary of the walls.  As a kid, I would laugh at the ridiculousness of the idea; *Mom's off her rocker today, she thinks she's going to die if she touches grass.* It was easy to shrug it off because it was just one of many superstitions in a cup that was practically overflowing on the table, staining the carpet with a million little idioms and axioms.  Many of them, I'm sure you are familiar with; don't step on cracks, always toss a pinch of salt over your shoulder should a single renegade grain miss the plate and land on the counter, never pick up a penny that sits tails side up.  So many absurd rules, so many rituals to observe, it's a wonder she got anything done at all.  But above all else, one rule was to be followed no matter what; when your doom sense starts tingling, you must obey. Like a lot of lessons that can only be learned the hard way, it was funny until it wasn't; sometimes I think I'm lucky that I was ever able to laugh again. 



But, I don't like to dwell on that.  Life goes on, and it's easy to write of the things that happen to a child as exaggerated, or entirely mythologized.  When you're eleven, everything is big, and the world is always ending.  It's hard to distinguish random chance from preordained fate.  As an adult, I would tell myself that I didn't believe in such flights of fantasy.  The loudest voice in my head was always quick to rationalize; *sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing to blame but happenstance.* I think I always knew that was bullshit.  I didn't go to work that day, or any day after, because I *knew* that something terrible was waiting for me.  Destiny, fate, fantasy, whatever name makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, I know it for what it was; the truth.  



My alarm went off at 6:45 am just like it always did, and I got out of bed with the same sleep inertia that rested on my shoulders since the day I turned 30.  I didn't know it then, but to be fair, I barely knew my name before the first stream of hot water hit my back as I took my morning shower.  No, I got all the way through the grooming process, past a cup of Kroger coffee and a plate of scrambled eggs, all the way to the moment my hand touched the doorknob when it hit me.  Only *hit* isn't the right word.  Really, it is more akin to having your body filled with ice cold water.  A sharp chill runs down your spine, as your stomach clenches and drops, and your feet feel as though they weigh a thousand pounds each. Were there goosebumps?  Maybe, it was hard to tell for sure on top of everything else.  The world had stopped around me, as something in my mind let out a panicked hiss.



*DON'T.*  



I tried to shake the thought and turn the knob anyway



*STOP.*



My stomach dropped a second time and my hand froze in place.



*WRONG. SOMETHING IS WRONG.*



Before I knew what I was doing, I had backed down the hallway into my kitchen. The rational voice in my head was already making a fuss.



“*What the fuck are you doing?  You're going to be late for work, and for what? A random bout of anxiety?”*



Maybe it was right, maybe I was just having a moment, but it was one hell of a moment to be sure.  I buried that rational voice that screamed of write ups and lost wages and walked back to the coffee maker.  I told myself that another cup of coffee was exactly what I needed, and then I would hit the road.  As I pulled the pot from its cradle, I was alarmed to see my hands were shaking.  The great knot in my stomach had loosened a bit, but my nerves must have still been a little frayed.  I poured another cup, sprinkling the counter with little drops of java as the pot writhed in my hand.  I promised to clean those up when I got home, when I didn't have somewhere to be.  



Those drops are still there as I write this.  After slamming my second cup of coffee, the shakes simmered down into a dull tremble.  I looked at the clock on my stove, and saw that it read 8:30.  I couldn't remember if the clock was two minutes fast or two minutes slow, but it hardly mattered; with traffic, I was going to be late regardless. The rational voice piped back up just then, striking the tone of a disappointed mother, chastising me for my silliness.  



*“What are you waiting for now?  Time to get going, idiot.”*



It was right again.  I set the cup down and headed back to the door, determined to get to the office for my daily 200 bucks.  My hand touched the knob and that weight settled back into my body, but I was expecting it this time.  Before my body could shut down again, I forced my way through the door and into the hallway of the complex, feeling sweat prickle the back of my neck as the cold air of the AC wafted over me.  The heaviness was starting to return to my feet, but I was resolved to keep going.  



*“Stop thinking about it, and go!”*



I jogged down the hallway to the elevator, and jabbed a finger at the button.  The chime had been broken for months, but the down arrow flashed its usual faded yellow glow.  So far, so good.  A moment later, the doors parted in with a rusty groan and a dull thud, revealing the smudged stainless walls and outdated carpet of the elevator.  I put one foot over the threshold when another wave of anxiety washed over me.



*TURN AROUND.  GO HOME NOW.*



*“Don't be stupid, get in the elevator!”*



Conflicting voices now, fighting for dominance.  It felt like a war in my brain, but all I was trying to do was go to work! I wasn't disarming a bomb, or deciding if someone should be pulled off life support; this *was* stupid.  So, against the wishes of my body, I stepped into the elevator and rode it from the 4th floor down to the first, and I crossed the lobby with a brisk pace, ignoring the monsoon churning in my gut.  When I reached the double glass doors of the complex and peered out into the wider world outside, I saw… nothing, nothing at all.



The early morning traffic started and stopped in a steady rhythm, and passersby continued to pass on by.  Birds fluttered down the street, oblivious to the wide eyed man gawking at them through an inch thick pane of glass. Everything was completely and utterly normal.  I let out a nervous chuckle, and wiped my brow with the backside of my hand.  *Man,* I thought, *I really worked myself up for nothing.*



*“Yeah, I've been saying that the whole time, asshole, now get moving."*



“Hey man, are you alright?” The voice came from behind me, at the front desk.  I turned my head a little too quickly to see the desk clerk, Paul, leaning forward with a look of concern set across his brow.  I must have walked right by him without noticing when I was forcing my way through the lobby.  “You've been standing at the door for like five minutes, and pardon my cliches, but you look like you've seen a ghost.” He wiggled his fingers as he said the word “ghost,” as if to reinforce the spookiness.



I shook my head and let out another chuckle.  I liked Paul.  For a glorified doorman, he was surprisingly warm and perceptive.  I shrugged and shoved my hands in my pocket.



“Shit, sorry. Just having a weird morning is all.” I paused for a second, and then added; “must have been that second cup of coffee giving me the jitters.”



Paul let out a hearty “ha” and leaned back in his chair.  “Well then, I need whatever you're drinking, because I'm on my third cup and it's not doing shit!” He produced a paper coffee cup from the desk and shook it lightly.  “Not much excitement here to keep me awake.  Heck, you're the most interesting thing I've seen all morning.”



We both laughed at that, and it felt good. It *was* good.  We shot the shit for a few more minutes, before I wished him a good shift and turned back to leave. I was feeling a little better after the exchange. The rational voice chided me for stalling, but I took it in stride. With rationality within my grasp once again, I took a shallow breath and pulled against the stainless steel handles of the doors, letting the cold early morning breeze cascade across my face and chill the standing sweat from my absurd little panic attack.  My hands were shaking again, and my insides were still at war with each other, but for a second, I felt good about my decision.  No flights of fantasy, no giving in to those unreasonable fears.  I was not my mother, and if I had a say in it, I never would be.  I threw Paul one last wave, and pushed through.

  
  


I stepped out onto the sidewalk, hearing the whoosh of air as the door closed behind me, set against a symphony of idling engines sitting impatiently at the red light. From somewhere in the distance, an ambulance siren was echoing off the buildings. I was outside, and now I just had to round the corner to the lot where my Corolla was parked, no doubt covered in a layer of snow.  I turned to walk, cursing myself for not remembering to put the wipers up before the snow came.  Ten steps down the sidewalk, the siren was much closer, and I could see the lights of the ambulance down the street. I had time to wonder how it was going to get past the gridlock on my street. I paused to watch it approach, the knot in my stomach twisted yet again, and the feeling of cold water spread through my limbs.



*DOOM.*



A loud screech cut through the air as the ambulance barreled down the south side of the street, heading straight for the standstill traffic. The driver was trying to slam on the brakes to no avail.  The salt trucks had not yet been to my neighborhood, and the road was thick with ice and slush. Even with his foot to the floor, the driver could do nothing to stop what was coming; the vehicle meant for saving lives was about to become an instrument for taking them. As I watched, the ambulance closed the distance at what I would guess was 50 miles per hour, gaining yards every time I blinked. I stood there and stared with a dawning horror of what was about to happen. My stomach dropped into my feet.



*“What the fuck are you waiting for? RUN!”*



The ambulance swung over the center line and plowed between two sedans at the back of the traffic jam with loud, mechanical crunch, sending both cars careening towards the sidewalk.  A red Ford Focus on the opposite side of the street hit the curb hard and flipped on its side, crushing a man against a wall before he even had time to scream. All at once, the weight in my feet let go, and I was sprinting towards the door of my building.  The ambulance hit the next set of cars; one of them was halfway into the next lane and the unstoppable force crushed the driver side and sent the car spinning into the next car in the line.  The screaming had started by then, a cacophony of fear and agony set against the sickening crack of metal on metal.  The carnage was quickly catching up to me, and I tried to tell myself that I couldn't hear the faint wet squelching under each impact.  I was lying.



I got to the doors and ripped them open, practically diving into the lobby as the ambulance reached the point I would have been standing. Paul was standing at the window, looking out in horror at the situation. He saw me run in and turned to yell something, but I just kept moving.



“What the fuck is going…” He never got a chance to finish that sentence. A man in an SUV was attempting to escape the chaos, and had backed halfway onto the sidewalk when the ambulance smashed through his fender, thrusting the SUV into the southern window of my building. The glass shattered instantly, spraying my back with little pieces of shrapnel. As I reached the elevator, the back half of the SUV was now resting where the sitting area normally was, and Paul was wedged somewhere underneath.  In a panic, I pushed the call button what must have been a hundred times, as I looked across the ruined lobby to the hell that was unfolding outside.  At the front of the intersection, a dump truck idled away in the left lane.  The ambulance, now looking more like a white and red hunk of scrap metal, found its final resting place in the back of that dump truck.  The impact boomed like a strike of lightning landed feet away.  The elevator doors opened behind me just as I watched the ambulance driver crashed through the windshield and break his neck on the steel wall of the truck in front of him. The force of the blow pushed the dump truck into the intersection, where more terrible crunches followed.



There is a weird zen that comes with being in shock. In the movies, when something bad happens and someone goes into shock, you don't really get a chance to know what that person is actually feeling.  As it turns out, it's almost sort of pleasant.  I was in shock when I stepped into the elevator, and the sounds of screaming and glass and metal faded away as the doors slid shut, replaced by the dulcet tones of elevator music.  To this day, I can’t tell you if the music was coming from the elevator or my own head.  I was faintly aware of a stinging sensation in the back of my neck, but beyond that, the lights were on and nobody was home.  The time between getting in the elevator and finding myself curled in a ball on my bed is mostly lost to me. I only came back to earth when my phone started buzzing in my pocket. I pulled it out and answered without looking, the motions just happening automatically.



“Hello?” The voice that came out of my mouth felt foreign to me; it was flat and hollow in the way a hypnotized child would speak.



“Jason, it’s Mark.  It’s going on 10 o’clock, and I don’t see you at your desk.  Your time card shows that you haven’t clocked in either.  Are you coming in today? Because if you’re not, you really needed to let me know beforehand.  Our attendance policy is very clear; minimum two hours notice for any call off, no exception.  I don’t want to write you up, but…” 



Of course it was Mark, Mr. By-The-Book, always crossing his T’s and dotting his I’s, quoting the employee handbook like scripture.  I never liked the guy, and I liked him even less at this moment. I sort of tuned out while he was talking, missing the last few things he said.  I could hear the sound of an approaching helicopter, when a thought occurred to me. 



*“Did he say 10 o’clock? Has it really been that long?”*



Even the rational voice was incredulous. Mark was still talking, something about points and discipline, when I found a point to interject.  



“There…there was a terrible accident.  Right outside my apartment…I…I almost…” I absentmindedly fumbled for the TV remote and turned the TV on my dresser to the Channel 2 News, and immediately saw an ariel view of my street, complete with all the carnage below. “Turn on the news Mark.  Channel 2.”



“Jason, I don’t see how this has…”



I hung up on him mid sentence and turned my attention to the TV screen, marvelling at the level of destruction that I was almost a part of.  The aerial view of the scene cut away to a news reporter on the street, who was doing her best to be professional despite the horrorshow before her, and mostly succeeding. I turned the volume all the way up, and walked over to the window that overlooked the street, pulling the curtains open as I listened for the grizzly details.  



“First responders are on the scene now, working to free those that are trapped in their cars.  Officers at the scene are unsure of the exact number of casualties, but the death toll is estimated to be at least 10, with at least a dozen others with serious injuries. In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is your fault, Jason.”



I tore myself away from the terrible scene below, and nearly screamed when I heard that. I desperately thumbed at the remote, trying to rewind to see if I heard what I thought I had just heard. I found the button and jumped back 30 seconds, feeling the remote grow sweaty in my hand.  



“...In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is Paola Greyson.”



I didn’t realize I had been holding my breath,and I let it all out in a massive exhale. I felt stupid, believing the news had talked to me directly.  I must have been losing my mind, but who could blame me? I just witnessed the death of god knows how many people, and could have easily died myself if I hadn’t moved when I did. This fact, laid out so bare before me caused my knees to buckle.  In the time since, I hadn’t really processed what happened, and all at once, it crashed over me like a tidal wave.  I fell into my bed, and started crying.  I cried for the man pinned by the red Ford Focus, for the ambulance driver whose last view was the back of the dump truck, for Paul, oh God Paul, who was always so warm and friendly, now cold and dead beneath an SUV not 3 floors down.  All of this destruction, all of this unnecessary death, and all of it could have been avoided if…



*YOUR FAULT.*



No. That wasn’t right.  There’s no way it could have been *my* fault, could it? All I did was try to go to work. There’s nothing I could have done to cause that.  It was the ice…the traffic, the ambulance.  There was no way for me to stop it, I was just going to…

‘

*YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED INSIDE.*

*‘*

*“Bullshit. That’s just superstitious bullshit.  Even if you stayed inside, all of those people would have died anyway.”*



That may have been true, but…



*“No buts! Do you hear yourself? You’re starting to sound just like your mother!”*



My head was at war with itself once again, with the rational voice desperately vying for control. For the rest of the day, I did my best to actively avoid thinking, to varying degrees of success and failure.  Try as I might to keep it out of my mind, flashes of the accident would barrage my senses at regular intervals, bringing up a cavalcade of conflicting emotions.  Grief, anger, fear, and guilt.  The guilt was the worst of it, because I could explain it no more than I could accept it, yet it was there all the same.  It didn’t help that the scene was right outside my windows, and it especially didn’t help that I could hear the tow trucks and ambulances and fire engines.  By nine, I was exhausted in every sense of the word.  I don’t think I could have cried anymore if I tried; my eyes had become deeply sunk in two very red rings.  My neck was sore from the tiny bits of glass that I eventually found and removed with tweezers.  I checked the news before I went to bed, and the final number had been tabulated: 12 dead,15 injured, among which were several children.  My heart broke all over again as I turned off the TV and settled into blankets and pillows.



*“Tomorrow will be better.  Tomorrow we can start to put this behind us.”*



If only.



My alarm began blaring at 6:45 am on the dot, just as it always did, and when I slammed my hand on the snooze buttons, I immediately became aware of two things; the tense knot in the pit of my stomach, and a panicked whisper at the edge of my mind.



*DOOM.*
