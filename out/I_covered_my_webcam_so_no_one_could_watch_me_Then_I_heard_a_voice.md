I've been pretty paranoid recently about being spied on through my computer. There's been a few nights when I was just going down the usual 3:00AM YouTube rabbit hole, and then after a while I noticed the green light on my webcam was on. 

Each time, I had no idea how long it was on, but it might as well have been hours. I checked all my applications to make sure I didn't accidentally leave FaceTime or Photobooth open, but they were always closed. 

About a month ago, I was watching some scary unsolved mystery videos on YouTube late at night when I got the chills. The emptiness of my pitch black bedroom suddenly made me feel so vulnerable.

It was like I could feel hundreds of invisible eyes staring at me. That was when I decided to finally cover my webcam with some masking tape. I thought I was finally safe.

I kept watching videos for a little while longer and fell asleep in the middle of one, the laptop still wide open, directly facing me.

What I woke up to an hour later sent goosebumps all across my body.

Someone... spoke to me. A deep, masculine voice. Firm and clear. It said my name. It said to me: "Now's no time for sleep, Darren". 

I jolted up in my bed and stared at the screen. I thought maybe I imagined it as I was waking up from a dream. I just stared at that screen for probably 10 minutes in total silence. 

That silence was shattered abruptly by the sound, "You shouldn't have done that, Darren". 

I immediately slammed my computer shut, leaped from my bed, and turned on all the lights. 

I stood on the opposite side of the room, looking at the laptop and hyperventilating for a few minutes.

I knew I wasn't going to get any sleep that night, so I called my best friend, Jane, in panic and asked if I could stay at her place.

I fled my house with nothing but the clothes on my back, leaving that laptop behind on the bed, hoping to never see it again.

Jane and I stayed up talking for hours, and we eventually went to sleep with all the lights on. 

When I returned to my house in the evening the next day, it took me hours to work up the courage to open my laptop again. All I could think about was that voice. Even with it closed, I felt like I was being watched.

That night, I did some homework on my computer for a few hours with the lights on. There was no voice. Before I went to sleep, I put my laptop in a box under my bed. It took hours to actually fall asleep.

But when I finally did, I had the most vivid nightmare.

In the dream, I was lying in bed trying to fall asleep like before. Except something was wrong. My laptop was open, sitting on my desk across the room, facing me directly. 

I tried to get up to put it away, but I was completely paralyzed. I just had to sit there with the cold black screen staring into my soul for what felt like hours. It was agonizing.

And then... it happened. The voice... "You shouldn't have done that". From inside the screen emerged a pair of ghostly white hands, grabbing onto the edges of the frame and pulling themself out.

I could barely breathe as I watched a *man* **crawl** out of my computer screen. 

His skin was pure white and his eyes were pitch black. He stood at the edge of my bed in silence.

Yet again, I felt hours pass lying in that bed, my eyes wide open as if someone was holding them open for me.

He watched me with no expression. No creepy smile. No diabolical laugh. It was just a man with soulless black eyes.

Right before I woke up, he spoke to me once more.

I will never unhear those words. 

He said "From now on, I will watch you every night while you sleep. And every day, one of your friends will disappear, and then your family, and then the whole world, until us two are the only people who exist in this universe. And I'll just watch you for eternity."

Then he crawled back into the screen and I woke up again.

When I sat up in my bed, I saw on my desk across the room... my laptop.

So now, it's been a month. And, well... he didn't make any of that up. Every day for the past month, someone in my life has disappeared. Jane is gone, all my other close friends are gone, acquaintances are gone, coworkers are gone, and even some of my teachers are gone.

I seem to be the only person who notices, though.

Everyone has just gone about their lives as normal. There's no missing teenager panic in my town or anything. It's as if nothing has changed for anyone but me.

But the worst part of it all isn't just that they're gone.

You see, each night since a person in my life has vanished, I've fallen asleep and dreamed of the man staring at me, but he's not the only one. 

There is a new pair of eyes each night. Bright white eyes shining through an impenetrable black fog... *inside* of my computer screen.

All these people that I've loved, hated, feared... they watch me every night now, untouchable yet impossible to shake. Trapped inside my screen.

They're all here, but I feel so alone.

I don't have much time left. Soon they'll all be gone.

I'm so lonely. 

I shouldn't have done that.

Is there anybody out there?
