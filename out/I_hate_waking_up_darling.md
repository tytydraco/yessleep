When my little brother was born around 1987 Country side virgina; he would always cry at night, me and mom thought it would soon pass, but as time went on he got older he started clibing out the bed in to our basement and he would be sleeping their in the mornings. We tried to ask him why he would do that, but he never remembered anything in the morning. 


My mom just thought it was a weird habit and that he was lying for his mom's attention, but I got paranoid. One night I was dayezd my brother woke me up , the lights were off the whole house was quiet. "Aj"(my brothers name) I asked, no response. I told it off and sent him away,I locked my door and just went back to sleep.

 
The next day he woke me up again it seem as if he had been digging somthing he only said 4 words to me and walked away "she wants to talk " honestly I was freaked out decided to see where he went, back to the basement?. No. He went outside under the house. Honestly, I don't know why I got a chilling feeling and decided to get my mom to feel safer. I ran up stairs, I tried waking her up, but nothing. " Honey, what are you doing here?"she asked ?" Did you have a nightmare again?" Confused I was. I never had nightmares, but I went along with it as I explained to her what had happened when she started to cry. "What did you do hon" I was quiet and told her to follow me down stairs, of course I would my brother was underneath the house doing who knows what but I did not want to find out.

 Walking out the house and we smelled something horrible reaking underneath. It was him. After that, I was confused for multiple nights he had woken me up, but no. my brother died last year, and therapy didn't work out, I guess.

 Now I live in a ward, I'm happy now he doesn't wake me up anymore, but he does call to see if I want to talk. We didn't have a lot of money, so my mom and I dug his grave under the house. 



It's 4 am. already. I might have to get going if im not. I might have to follow him. I'm scared he will find me awake when Im not Sleeping, I'm safe. I can't wake up, I can't. 

Part 2 


15 years later ,I'm finally being let out, my moms getting too old to walk, so I'll move back in to help around the house. 



Recently, I've been having problems with the walls, but the smell is bad. Maybe the house is old. I've been hearing my little brothers voice again, his screams locked into my ears, I don't know why I would imagine something like that. 
 
 
My mom passed away yesterday. I got quite a hefty inheritance, including my childhood home. So I'm thinking of renovating since so much time had passed and the house was aging poorly. 
 

People have been in and out my house all day taking measurements it's honestly been trying, but I'm fine with socialing a bit with people, now that I've been been home  for 3 years....I'm thinking of taking down some walls and changing out the floors it shouldn't take a long time, so I've decided to stay at a motel for this time being. 
 
 
I woke up today they just started on our wall. 
 


There are about 5 police vehicle out side right now, and they want to speak to me.
 

My brother, well, he accidently drowned. It's been years since I've never talked about it. The police were asking all sorts of random questions. For some reason, they had a lot to do with my mother.
 


My mom was a killer to 7 small corpes found on the floor, 2 adult bodies in the walls , and my brother.
 
 

Well, my brother wasn't always the one waking me up at night.
