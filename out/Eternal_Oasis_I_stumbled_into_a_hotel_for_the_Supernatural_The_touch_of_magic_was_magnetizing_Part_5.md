I started with a question. One that I was hoping I’d get an answer to fairly quickly. What I wasn’t expecting though, was the way in which I *received* it. The wheels in my mind were turning, my thoughts trying to find any kind of logical reasoning it could grasp onto, and I could tell that after my vision at the kitchen table, everyone else’s were too.  
  
“Who are all of you?” I asked, my hands still a bit shaky from the vision. I shoved them under my thighs, smashing them against the chair and hoping that no one noticed. "And you..." I couldn't stop the words from slipping out in a disbelieving laugh, pointing to Conrad. "I saw you kidnapped from the streets, and turned into a… a monster."   
  
I pretended not to notice his wince and the wrinkle in his expression that was a cross between a scowl and a smirk. "You were abused and tortured." I turned my focus to Cass. "You both begged to die, and now you're playing *house* in the same place that you were tormented?"   
  
I held my breath. "I'm just going to be honest. You guys can't go on like this."  
  
The silence that followed made me realize that I was surrounded by undead creatures, capable of ripping me to shreds.   
  
"Oh, wow." Conrad broke the silence (of course). “That’s rich.” He folded his arms, settling me with a smile with a little too much teeth.   
  
"I am *so* sorry for trying to overcome my deeply repressed trauma! What, would you rather I was rolling around on the floor screaming and begging for death? I can do that if you really want me to." His tone was jovial, but part of me wondered if he was lashing out in his own *Conrad* way - Which was using his mouth.   
  
"Conrad." Cass shot the unhinged vampire with one of her famous glares reserved just for him.   
  
He blew out an annoyed breath, mimicking her with a muffled, "*Conrad*!" before exchanging looks between the others. Rai looked uncomfortable, ducking his head, while Cass folded her arms, her lips pressed into a thin line. It was the quietest the residents had been since I’d arrived at Eternal Oasis.   
  
I waited, before opening my mouth, catching their sneaky glances. Jeez, it was like being back at school. “Okay, what am I missing? Because it looks like all three of you are having a silent conversation that–"  
  
“Yeah, I’m gonna stop you right there, Little Miss Invading Our Privacy.” Conrad’s tone was stale and dry. The vampire really was annoyed that I'd called out their… unhealthy relationship with this place.   
  
"Winnie. Winona. *Winnie the pooh*." He had definitely overhead Noah and me talking. "I know you’re freaking out right now, which, yes, is valid. Sure, I would freak out too if I was sleeping on top of a graveyard of failed lab rats. However, this place is ours. We're not just going to leave."   
  
He shook his head, running a hand through his hair. "I forgot what point I was trying to make, but can you, like, please explain to us what the heck we just witnessed?"  
  
"What?" The word was rolling off of my tongue before I could help it.   
  
"Uh, the *demonic possession*?" Conrad said, like I was the slow one. "You know, when your eyes rolled back into your head and I thought you were having an aneurysm?" He leaned forward, lips pursed.   
  
"You know, that was kinda cringe. There you were going through something probably, like, private, and traumatic, and I have to say, I didn't really vibe with it. Since we're being *honest* with each other." The vampire's eyes narrowed, lips curling.   
  
If looks could kill… I would be dead.   
  
My eyes cut to his before dropping to the table. I chewed on my bottom lip for a second before I decided to just come clean. “I can, uh…" The words were lodged in my throat, almost like I’d choked on a mint, the burn lingering long after it had slid down.   
  
“I know how this is going to sound, but I can see flashes of the past.” I paused and then tried again. “I can see memories. But only when someone touches my hands.” I tried to smile. "Like seeing a vision! That's how I saw what you went through. I saw all of it. I felt it."   
  
*Felt it?*   
  
Conrad didn't speak, the words curling on his lips before he decided against using his voice. I knew exactly what he meant–in all aspects. I felt my own cheeks start to redden. I had seen it all; his ups and downs, highs (literally) and lows. And his deepest, despairing moments that severed him from reality, forcing him to beg for his own death. I looked away from the vampire before I could lose myself in his past once again.   
  
"Cool." Rai's voice was a deadpan grumble. He reached into the refrigerator, pulling out a carton of orange juice, unscrewing the lid. He started to drink out of the neck, having second thoughts when Cass caught his eye. "I love having people in my head."  
  
Cass's eyes darkened, her gaze drifting to her own hands. The same ones that were folded into mine only seconds ago.  
  
“What did you see when you…” Her voice drifted off as her eyes flitted up to meet mine.  
  
For some reason, I didn’t want to tell her. Well, maybe that’s not right? Perhaps I just didn’t know how. How do you even go about telling someone that you know about some of the worst parts of their past?   
  
I saw Cass drown in her own blood, suffocate under water that pushed her down deeper than her depression ever could, a blade that sliced into her with no mercy. How could I tell them that they had unknowingly exposed their minds, their most private, painful, vulnerable moments, to someone they barely knew? I had forced myself inside of them. *Little miss invading our privacy*.   
  
The only person I wanted to talk to right then was the emotionless basher, who had learned to find them through a family of misfits. “Cass, I'm so sorry,” I started, my voice wavering. I couldn’t look her in the eyes, but the words flew from my lips before I could stop them.   
  
“I saw your bedroom with string lights and stars. I saw your parents and the doctors. I saw the bridge, the lab and…" I don't know why my gaze found Conrad, and this time his eyes were glued to me,  challenging.   
  
*“Shut up.”*  
  
My lips sealed, the words crammed back into the confines of my mouth. An odd sizzling sensation burned on my tongue as my eyes found a stranger in the doorway.  
  
Standing just within the threshold of the kitchen was a shadow. One that quickly bled into a woman with the most hauntingly blue eyes that I’d ever seen. Her features were sharp and severe, bordering on intimidating. A single pale finger made a zipping motion across her lips, a purple zap of electricity crackling from her fingertip. At the same time that she did so, my own finger mirrored hers before I could talk again.  
  
It lasted maybe a couple of seconds before I could pry my lips open, wincing at the sensation of pins and needles skittering over my bottom lip. “What the heck *was* that?”   
  
Conrad leaned back in his chair, rocking on the back legs. "Ooh, that's Lilith! Are you going to demand why *she's* here too?" This time, his smile was a little less intimidating. "Lili is… Have you seen Sabrina? The cartoon, that is, not the sitcom with the insufferable talking cat–"  
  
“She's a witch…" I answered for him, my voice trailing off. She looked exactly like the girl in the flashback.  
  
The woman shot him an annoyed look, dull blue eyes flicking to me. Sandy colored hair stopped neatly at her chin, and a dark, red lipstick coated her lips. She curled her upper lip. "Conrad." She said his name like he was the annoying younger brother, before turning her attention to the apparent resident mom. "Cass." The witch spoke calmly. "What is a *human* doing in the hotel?”   
  
Before Conrad could even answer her, he was interrupted by the sound of a door swinging open, a loud thump resonating off the wall. We all turned. The front door of the hotel was wide open.   
  
A man stood in its entrance, a monstrously wide grin plastered across his face. He looked eerily familiar, and then, it clicked. With the way that Conrad stiffened in his chair, all the bravado and sarcasm he had been hiding behind before disappeared in the blink of an eye.   
  
This was Dr. Carlisle's son.   
  
The mood in the room seemed to shift. But neither the vampire nor the banshee moved. I could see on Cass's twitching scowl, and Conrad's gaze which had fallen to the floor, that these two were still very much human, despite having their humanity torn away.   
  
“Roman,” Lilith barked, her posture rigid and her tone far from inviting. “I thought I made myself clear when I told you *never* to step foot on these grounds again.”  
  
“Aw, come on!” her twin crooned, flicking a piece of lint from his suit jacket. “Is that really any way to welcome your brother? I caught two trains here. Two. That's dedication!"  
  
Rai was quick to stand beside the witch, her power radiating off of her in waves. A strange, dark aura seemed to swim around her body like a fog.  
  
Rai grumbled, stiffening on the spot. “Lilith, do you need to me to–"   
  
“Can you *please* tell your dog to stand down. He's getting way too close."   
  
Roman’s eyes flicked down at Rai’s twitching fingers. "You're a painful excuse for a dog," he said. The boy gestured to Conrad and Cass, both of whom were still eerily silent. "At least they were something! My father made something out of them! He made freaks." His grin was lavish, widening with every word.   
  
"Look at them! These clowns are just my dad's foot soldiers! Even now. Dad is buried six feet underground, maggots making a home in his ribcage, and these two are still under his spell." Just a single glance told me that they were reliving all of that trauma. Rai, however, didn't share that trance-like look, easily stepping in front of the witch.   
  
Roman made a point to continue. "But you? You’re just a mutt. A reject. Your own kind didn’t even want you." His laugh came out in a choked splutter.   
  
"You're a failure, man!" His hands came down on Rai’s shoulders, emphasizing every word, his eyes narrowed, devoid of humanity. "Just. Like. Me."   
  
A warning grumble ripped from Rai’s lips before Lilith's hand rested on his arm, an attempt to calm the tension building in the room.  
  
Cass slinked out of the kitchen, arms folded as she shot daggers at Roman.  
  
He smirked, a wicked gleam in his eye as he drank in Cass’s figure. “You always were a sight to behold, Cassandra.”  
  
Once again, Rai growled, baring his teeth at Roman before wrapping a protective arm around Cass’s waist.  
  
“What do you want?” Lilith asked, her arms crossed and her voice sharp. Instead of answering her though, Roman’s eyes darted over to my direction, cocking his head in sudden interest.  
  
“A human in the hotel?” he started. “Sis, when did you become so soft?”  
  
“*That* is none of your concern right now,” Lilith snapped, her next words spat through gritted teeth. “What are you doing here?”  
  
Roman’s lips twitched before they curled up into a wicked grin. “You know, I’m not really liking your attitude right–”  
  
With a burst of wind, his body was suddenly slammed against the wall, Lilith’s hands glowing a strange purple color. I watched as she stuck out a finger and then crooked it in her direction, a come hither motion pulling him towards her.   
  
“Now,” she started, her brows furrowed and her jaw clenched. “Let’s try this again. What the hell are you doing in my hotel?”  
  
“I’ve brought you a surprise,” Roman said nonchalantly, his eyes skittering over towards Conrad. “I’ve made him a little friend.”  
  
Conrad’s eyes narrowed. "What's that supposed to–"   
  
***CRASH***  
   
Roman’s lips formed a smug smile as something came stumbling into the room. It was fast, like a wave of *something* coming over us.   
  
I watched Conrad assess the situation immediately, his expression darkening, before calmly situating himself in front of the shadow - a blurry, inhuman thing. It, or he, was definitely a vampire. But not the kind that Conrad was.   
  
No. This was a real, blooded vampire.   
  
When the commotion finally stilled, all of us froze. Standing nose to nose in the middle of everything was the lab experiment and the real thing. Noah. Except Noah didn’t quite look like himself. His hair was disheveled and empty, yet his eyes feverishly darted around the room in a frenzied manner, flitting between all of us.  
  
“You need to calm down,” Conrad hissed. He twisted to Cass.   
  
"How did *this* even happen? Who was watching him?"   
  
Noah’s grin widened as he shook his head. The second his eyes found mine, his tongue slowly slid across his top lip before his bottom lip was tugged in between his teeth, his words drawn out in a snarl. “It smells *so* good. What *is* that?"   
  
Noah only took a step before Conrad reached out to grasp his arm. “Hey. That's not a good idea. And trust me, I've had my fair share." He grabbed Noah's shoulders in what looked like a reassuring squeeze. "We should, uh, probably get you out of here, you know–"   
  
Before Conrad could even react though, Noah was on him in seconds, shoving him into the wall so hard that some of the drywall crumbled. Conrad’s eyes were an odd shade, flickering between scarlet and pooling darkness, human and vampire, as he fought to shove the boy off - but Noah’s strength was immeasurable in comparison.  
  
Lilith was quick to jump into action. Intense purple electricity danced across her fingertips and in one swift movement, she plucked Noah off of Conrad and threw him to the ground. Noah fought desperately, his body writhing violently as she held him down. A small, red rivulet of blood dripped down Lillith’s nose as she struggled to keep him down. The amount of power she was using had clearly pushed her past her limits.  
  
With a shove, Roman was able to throw her off balance, and that’s when all hell broke loose. The second that Lilith toppled to the ground, Roman was on top of her, throwing punches hard enough that I was sure it would do some damage. Rai was quick to come to her aid.  
  
Cass rushed to Conrad’s side. Noah was nowhere to be seen. One second Conrad was holding Noah down, and the next, he was a blur. From where I was sitting, I could tell that Conrad was bleeding. Cass ripped the towel on her head free from her hands, and pressed it against the wound.  
  
Fear coursed through me as I stood up from my chair so fast that the back legs screeched against the hardwood. I felt helpless. Everything was crumbling down around me and all I could manage to do was stand there like a deer stuck in the headlights.   
  
I staggered backwards, searching for some type of exit, when I felt something slam into me. My body fell into a heap on the floor. Noah was pinning me down.   
  
My fist connected with the side of his jaw, which made no difference. I hit the ground with a meaty smack, head first, black spots bulging in and out of focus. A shadow was looming over me, ice cold breath in my face.  
  
“Hey," I hissed. "This is not you! Snap out of it!”  
  
I needed to remind him who he was. I needed to remind him who *I* was. With every ounce of strength that I had, I wiggled one of my hands free and grasped his finger, squeezing hard. I needed to get inside his mind.  
  
I sensed him trying to resist it. His brows scrunched together and his eyes clenched shut as reality started to bleed into dream. “What are you–"  
  
*“doing?” Noah's voice seeped into my mind, his hands jutting out to steady me. "Winnie, are you crazy?!"*   
  
*“I’m walking on a tightrope!” I laughed, small hiccups escaping my lips.*  
  
*“Winnie, get down from there,” Noah sighed, trying to pull me away from the top of the jungle gym. “What are you even doing out here, drunk, in the middle of the night?”*  
  
*Noah hoisted me off the jungle gym and placed me on the ground, my balance still unsteady as I stumbled over to one of the park benches. Noah sat down beside me, his eyes scanning my face worriedly. “Winnie…” he whispered, his hand tucking back a strand of my hair. “Why are you out here?”*  
  
*My lip trembled and tears welled up in my eyes. A knot was beginning to form in the back of my throat. “Noah, please don’t make me talk about it right now.”*  
  
*“Winnie,” Noah started. “Karma called and told me that you rushed out of the house.” He glanced down at my bare feet and shook his head, “Where are your shoes at?”*  
  
*A horrible nauseous feeling crawled up my throat every time I thought about telling him why I was an absolute wreck. Tyler and I had been dating for a whole year before I found out he was cheating on me, and I was spiraling.*  
  
*“Noah, I-” before I could even finish my sentence, I was bent over the park bench retching up all the contents in my stomach all over his white tennis shoes. Tears sprang from my eyes as I wiped the puke from my mouth. “I’m so sorry!” I blubbered. “Oh my gosh, Noah, I’m so-”*  
  
*“Shhh,” he whispered, pulling me into his lap like I was a child. For a good five minutes, I clung to his T-shirt as he rocked me back and forth, sobs wracking my body.*  
  
*“Noah?” I whispered, my mouth still tasting of acid. “He cheated on me.”*  
  
*I felt his grip on me tighten for a moment, several curses whispered between clenched teeth before he glanced down at me and brushed his lips softly against the top of my head. “He’s a fool, Winnie. I'm so sorry."*  
  
*A terrible gasping sound escaped my lips as I fought to choke back another round of tears, but once again, Noah was quick to soothe me.*  
  
*“Hey, hey, hey,” he whispered into my hair. “I’ve got you. It’s going to be okay.”*  
  
*With a light squeeze, I felt him hug me to his chest as he stood and walked towards his car. “C’mon Winnie the Pooh, let’s get you home.”*   
  
*My hands clawed at the fabric of his shirt as he walked us to his car. “Please, no,” I whimpered. “I don’t want Karma and the girls to see me like this.”*  
  
*Noah glanced down at my face, then nodded. I’m sure my makeup was a mess, mascara trailing down my cheeks in thick, smeared black.*  
  
*As he carried me back to the car, I couldn’t help but relax for a moment, exhaustion clinging to me like cigarette smoke. My head fell back against his chest as I fought to keep my eyes open, one last sentence falling from the tip of my tongue. “I’m safe with you, right? I’m-”*  
  
*“Winnie,” Noah whispered, “I would never hurt you."*  
  
The same went for the present.   
  
"I'm okay," he said in a breath when the memory faded. "I'm… I'm okay–"  
  
Before Noah could even finish his sentence though, a blood curdling scream stopped us all in our tracks… Cass. Noah cringed, his hands covering his ears, blood trickling down the side of his face. My own hands slapped across my ears, the sound ringing so loudly in my head that I thought I was going to be sick.  
  
The second it stopped, it was almost like the whole room sighed, the sound like an audible breath of relief exhaled all at once. When I finally pulled my hands away from my ears, sticky red clung to them. A quiet hiss left my lips as I rolled away from Noah. Some time during Cass’s screaming, he had slumped over into a fetal position on the floor. Glass littered the area around us, her piercing shriek breaking almost every window in the kitchen.  
  
Cass was slumped against a wall, her eyes trained on Conrad, who was scowling, teeth clenched, fingers forming pincers pulling out shards of glass from his flesh. Rai was crouched over Roman, and Lillith was holding her nose, blood pouring. Beside me, Noah stirred, his eyes darting to the red that stained my hand. Fear clawed its way into me, curling and twisting as I watched him suck his bottom lip between his teeth, nostrils flaring as he fought the urge to repress that gripe inside his throat.  
  
“You wouldn’t ever do this, remember?"  
  
I could see his inner turmoil as he mulled over my words, but his body was betraying him. It was like fighting a losing battle, and it was even worse watching it unfold. Noah was my best friend, and seeing him struggle with something *just* beyond his reach of self control was heartbreaking.   
  
So, I did the only thing I could think of. Instead of crawling away, I moved closer, my mind a warzone between fear and familiarity. He wouldn’t hurt me. He could control himself. I slowly extended my hand, blood dripping in small, red globs onto the hardwood.  
  
Noah glanced at me, a silent question on his face before he gripped my wrist and brought my fingertips to his mouth. Once again, his eyes met mine, asking for permission before I nodded my head.   
  
Unlike the first time, this was controlled. This was Noah. This was the man who had held me in the park, the man who had slept next to me in a top bunk when I had a nightmare, and the one who had never hesitated to take me for a drive when I needed to clear my head. This was my best friend.  
  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
  
A few hours later, when Noah had grown limp, a shadow appeared in the doorway.   
  
"Thaaat's *nottttttttt* a good idea. Whatever you think is best. It's not."  
  
Conrad was standing in the doorway, looking his usual mixture of amused and pissed. He leaned against the frame, arms folded, his head tipped back. I could tell that he had been drinking, his voice slurred, words overlapping each other.   
  
"I wasn't…uhh, born a vampire, or even bitten by one!" He flashed me a grin, “But I can tell you, as a, uh, honorary vampire, human blood can drive us crazy." He gestured to Noah. "Especially newbies."   
  
He took a step forward, which accelerated, and then slowed down, stumbled and wrong. It was either from the drink, or the wound that Noah had inflicted on him during their scuffle. Despite that, I noticed a stance that I’d never seen before. Because Conrad never acted this serious.   
  
His hands were at his sides, fingers curled into a fist, body stiff, eyes half lidded and yet wide awake, ready to attack if necessary. Even drunk. There was another vampire nearby, and Conrad was territorial, in his own weird *Conrad* way.  
  
"Me?" He prodded at himself. "Yeah, I'm kind of a different story, y'know? Since I was created on a table, not from a bite. I haven't lived for thousands of years, so that makes me lowly scum to these vamps. A ‘wannabe,’ if you will. Anyway." His teeth came out in what might have been a snarl, or maybe he was just teasing.   
  
"I'm good with the occasional snack, and our A positive, courtesy of Cass." He jutted his chin at Noah, who was falling asleep in my arms. "He's what we call a *real* one. He works differently. He needs human blood, or he will go frickin' feral."   
  
Conrad’s chuckle made me wonder if he was wrong, and maybe he already had a taste. And maybe, he was also slowly losing his mind to that craving. “So yeah, enjoy being ripped apart."  
  
“You’re morbid.” Lilith’s words cut through the silence as she pushed past him and over to me. “He’ll need to be monitored closely until we can figure out whether he’s a threat or not.”  
  
Conrad rolled his eyes, a smug smile settling over his lips.   
  
“Threat? Did you see the way he was about to–"  
  
“*Conrad*,” Lilith hissed. “Shut up, you're embarrassing yourself. You reek of alcohol. Go lie down and sleep it off."  
  
"I don't sleep, Lils."   
  
"Well, go stare at the ceiling for eight hours!"   
  
With a scoff, Conrad turned on his heel, his gaze flashing to Noah. He mouthed, "drink up" before slinking off.   
  
My cheeks reddened as I averted my eyes, Lilith’s hands tracing strange patterns on the skin of my wrist.  
  
“You’re going to be weak from the blood loss. This should help keep you stable.”  
  
The second she traced the last shape, I jerked forward. All of the exhaustion I had felt from before was replaced with a renewed sense of energy. I didn’t understand how it worked or why she decided to help me, but I did know one thing…
