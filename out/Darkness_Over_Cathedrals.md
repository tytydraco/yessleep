"The Cathedrals! A vast, sprawling vista of mountains, 1241 metres high, recovering from harsh wildfire with unbeatable determination, a testament to nature's tendency for resilience, truly a spectacle to be remarked and you're looking the other way, at the empty sky. Nothing there!" I should be saying something nice back to Jesse, after all he only wants someone to share his love and connection with this place. I am enjoying my time here, only for different reasons. Where the peaceful environment gives him something to think about, it gives me a backdrop for unrelated thoughts. I'm about to say something in praise of this place he's taken me and Seth to, when something catches my attention. In the sky I was just looking at, something has changed. "Nothing there, you say?" I ask him, while pointing up to the sky.

Just a small dot, so far up in the sky, but so bright. The boys have come over to me to get a better look. "Whoa..." Jesse is watching it as it moves across the sky. It's a dazzling sight, burning across the sky, so fast. And yet, it's not that fast anymore. It's come to a complete stop. No, It's not stopped, it's changed direction. Seth has also realised, shouting "It's coming down! I'm expecting that we will get to watch it go down and land in some field somewhere, but as it gets ever lower, it seems to creep closer to us. "You don't think..." I start to say, before trailing off, realising we are all having the same thought. *But the chances are so slim,* I tell myself. It lands atop the mountain, not far from us, with a thunderous rumble, shaking the earth under our feet. A faint orange light begins to shine through the trees, followed by a thin plume of smoke. The three of us stand around, unsure what to do, before Seth, like the thrillseeker he is, sets off in a sprint towards the fire.

"Wait, Seth!" I call after him. Me and Jesse are running behind him, trying to keep up, to make him stop for a moment so we can think first. He's reached the top of the mountain, vanishing behind the now worryingly dense smoke. We wait for a moment, thinking it through. Jesse gives me a look that says *should we really do this?* I measure it up. I can just about see through to the inside, which appears to be clear of fire. I notice that there is an unaffected area leading straight through. We have a small window. "Through here, we have to be quick!" I say, leading Jesse to the opening. Holding my breath, I plunge into the gap. There is fire close by on either side, we need to do this fast. I catch my breath as we get out onto the other side. The clearing is around 5 metres in radius, a smooth circle of fine dirt with a mess of plants and bushes around the edges that had all been blasted away by the force of impact, now all on fire. Kneeling in the middle is Seth, and he appears to have found something.

Around the size of a basketball, grey and sort of stone-looking, an imperfect sphere. It's sitting right in the middle of the crater. This is what fell from the sky. "Seth, we need to go before the fire spreads!" Seth doesn't react to Jesse's pleas, he only leans forward and reaches out to it. We start running over to him, and he touches it. A loud hissing sound echoes around the crater, then as Seth recoils his hand, steam begins to rise from the rock. A dark print of Seth's hand is marked on the rock, as though burned into the face of it. The rock starts to change. It glosses over and shrinks down a little. It starts to take on a fleshy texture, with visible veins and blood pathways. Then it starts convulsing. Beating, like a heart. This seems to break Seth out of whatever trance he was in because he gets up and starts looking around, presumably for a way out. I say "this way!" and we head back towards the way we came. It is now considerably tighter of a gap, but still manageable. I let Jesse through first, then follow behind him with Seth last.

From here in the car I can see the peak of the mountain, smoke rising off it. We had called the fire department on our way down from the top and were now driving back to the ranch we had rented out for the trip. I hope they can contain the fire, this place has been hit hard enough already by Black Saturday, a fire which ravaged a huge chunk of the state. This area had been hit the hardest, turned entirely black. I wasn't around to see it happen but I have heard a lot of stories from the older folk in the area. They never seem to think this place is any good anymore. I don't think they appreciate it now. Dense clouds are starting to roll in, and the sky is darkening. Rain begins to plaster the window. I hear the sound of the wipers activating as a long hill rolls by. Standing atop the hill I notice an abnormally tall figure silhouetted against the darkening purple sky. It appears to be watching the road, watching us. I look out the back, staring after it until I can't see it anymore.

"I mean, we've already hit up all the places we wanted to go to on this trip, I think we should dip tomorrow." Jesse wants to leave, not wanting anything to do with what we saw in that crater. Me and Seth aren't arguing. "Yeah, let's get out of here." Seth agrees. "Evan, your turn to sleep in the cottage tonight." Jesse reminds me. There are only two beds in the main cabin, but there's a secondary cottage not far away with an extra bed, so we had been taking turns in the cottage. Nobody wants to be in there because there's no lock on the door. The boys go to their rooms, so now I’m alone out in the main room with the telly running. A few minutes pass of me waiting for the rain to stop so I can go to the cottage when the news flicks over to a story that catches my attention.

There is a reporter walking up a familiar mountain trail, the one we had just been on. He passes some firefighters who are packing up after having dealt with the fire. It pleases me to see that the fire wasn't a big problem. The reporter had been talking about how the thing had fallen from the sky and all that stuff I had already been there for. Then he gets to the top of the mountain, to the crater, saying "The thing that is most peculiar about all this is that once the fire was cleared, firefighters found no sign of the object that caused all this." And it's true. In the crater, illuminated by floodlights, is simply a dark circle where the rock had been. The story ends there and the news moves on to financing. I turn off the TV and notice that there's no rain left, so I grab my bags and head for the cottage. While walking there in the dark I remember the tall man on the hill. That childlike fear of the dark starts to creep its way back in. I get to the cabin, text the boys what I saw on the news and then get in bed.

There it is again, that's got to be three times now. It takes me a moment to realise that I'm lying in a bed. I open my eyes. When I try to remember the dream I was just having, all I can remember is the man on the hill. Wait, I have been counting something, and I've made it to three. But what am I counting? As if to answer, a dog howls in the distance. Four. Right, a dog had been howling and it woke me up the third time. I get out of bed and head to the window, subtly peering between the venetian blinds. There, about 60 metres straight ahead, standing by the garage, is a dog. it's a greyish husky, facing off to the right, with its side to me. It raises its head and once again howls. What is it doing just standing out there in the rain? what has it seen that's making it howl?

After a few minutes of just watching it sit under the harsh yellow light, I decided to ask the boys over text if it was disturbing them too. Jesse almost immediately messages me back saying "Ye, I can't see it tho. send pic?". I get my camera app open and, using my fingers, make a small opening in the blinds. I zoom in on the dog, and...

It's staring directly into the camera. I quickly take the photo and close the blinds. I send it to the boys, and look out the blinds again. It's still there, looking right at me. It turns to face it’s whole body to me. It shouts "Help me!" WHAT. I message the boys that it's talking to me, and they both say to run to the cabin where the doors can be locked, and stay there for the night. The dog is still shouting for help, with increasing urgency. It's in a similar direction to the cabin, so I decide to make it look like I'm going over to help it, closing most of the distance, and then run to the cabin. Slowly I open the door, watching to see if it does anything. It stays where it is. Then, losing all the urgency in its voice, it says "Hello. Come to me. Come closer." The voice sounds like it is being amplified through a loudspeaker, and then muffled behind something. I keep walking over to it, but making sure to get closer to the cabin as I do. Finally I am nearing the point where I have to turn away and make a run for the cabin. I slow down for a moment, passing by a tree. The tree obscures my vision of the dog for a moment, and when I can see it again, It's gone. It must know what I'm doing, and it could be anywhere.

I break off into a sprint towards the cabin. When I'm about halfway I start to notice the sound of fast, light footsteps behind me. I get to the walkway out the front of the cabin and The boys open the door for me. I get in and they slam it shut and lock it immediately. "Dude what was that?" Jesse asks me. "It must be the rock from the crater." I tell him my best theory on the situation. Seth is running to all the windows looking for the dog. Eventually me and the boys all decide to stay awake together and keep a guard of sorts. It was 5am anyway, the sun would be up soon and then we could go. After maybe half an hour or so Jesse says "Over there." pointing out of one of the windows. I look for a moment, and see a flickering orange dot. A small fire of sorts, out there in the trees. "What the hell?" Seth says. It starts moving to the right, before vanishing behind something. We never see it again all morning, nothing happens all morning, the sun comes up and we gather up all our things.

Seth had been in worsening condition all morning. By now he is laying on the bed in his room, too sickly to walk. I'm packing his things up for him, talking with Jesse about everything that's happened. I tell Jesse my theory: "I think somewhere along the way the rock must have figured out how to be a dog but didn't know dogs can't talk." Jesse says "I don't care what's happening, I just want to be away from it." And with that, he goes outside with his bags to load them up into the boot of the car, which we had parked just outside the cabin. I carry mine and Seth's bags out behind him, watching for any dogs or small moving fires. After everything is loaded up, Jesse gets in the driver's seat and starts her up. Nothing. A little whine, maybe? He gets back out of the car. "No fuel, someone must have siphoned it out or something." He reopens the boot and grabs the spare container. "They can get inside the car, they emptied this out too!" He takes the container, closes the boot and says "Right, I'm going to the servo for more, you stay here, hold the fort and watch Seth." He trudges up the winding driveway as I head back into the cabin to keep watch.

When they get fog out here, it's not like the even sort of misting you see in other places that covers everything equally. It's like low hanging clouds. Today, the tops of all the trees were lost in these clouds, and I couldn't see anything past about 50 metres. Out here in the country, walking to the servo would take hours and hours. I made regular checkups on Jesse to make sure he hadn't encountered a certain dog, but he was all good last I checked. Seth was the same as earlier, only he had quite the hankering and kept shovelling down all the food I gave him. Maybe he was going a bit pale too. I'm watching him from the door when he reacts to something. It's as if something is outside the cabin, but he couldn't know that, all the blinds are down. I look out of the window in the main room and see a robed man holding a torch, walking toward the cabin.

It wasn't a torch like a flashlight, but one of those flaming torches from the old days. The man stops ten feet from the house and stands entirely still. Seth is standing at the window in his room now, watching even though he can't see. Slowly I open the front door and approach the man, saying "who are you? do you need something from me? maybe you've seen a talking dog?" I hear footsteps behind me. I turn to see that Jesse is back with petrol. "Bit of a situation" I tell him. "Who is that?" Jesse asks. I shrug. "Okay well we're going." He walks over to the car and starts loading up the tank. Then he says "Just a second, getting the keys, getting Seth, then we're gone. Just watch him." As Jesse goes inside, the man turns to Seth's window, reaches out, and taps twice on the glass. Then he walks away, to the trees surrounding the cabin, and vanishes into the growing darkness.

I think I can hear screeching inside Seth's room, and something is scratching the walls. It occurs to me that maybe he didn't just give a part of himself to the rock, that maybe it works both ways. But now there's some kind of scuffle happening inside. I open the door and run in to see Jesse wrestling with a pale-skinned creature of inhuman proportions, screeching at him. It wore the shredded, torn up remains of Seth's clothes, had pronounced veins all over its body. So skinny, too. I run over to the thing Seth has become and kick it off of Jesse. Then I help Jesse up and we run to the door. Jesse is just behind me, Seth gets up on all fours and starts running over. It claws Jesse in the back but I manage to get him through the doorway, then I slam the door before it can get through. I hold the door shut with all my power as Jesse goes to get the car started. I look over to the left and see the robed man coming back from the direction of the garage, where I saw the dog earlier. Seth is banging and pounding on the door, but I'm keeping it at bay while Jesse finishes getting the car up and running, motioning for me to get in. I get ready, then make a break for the backseat. As I'm running over I hear the door get rammed open by Seth. The robed man, still walking to the car, is only a few metres away. Opening the door is the hardest part, because I have to stop running from Seth and let it get closer. I practically jump in, slamming the door behind me. Jesse locks it for me and slams down the pedal, and we finally start the ride away from all this misery.

Seth gives up chasing us after a few seconds. As we go up the winding driveway, I watch the flame of the robed man's torch shrink into the distance. I feel so relieved to be getting away after all this. I take one last look at the beautiful mountains behind us, as, one by one, in rapid succession, hundreds of torches light up all over them.
