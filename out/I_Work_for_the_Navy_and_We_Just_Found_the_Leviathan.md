I’ve been in the Navy for nearly a decade, serving on submarines, patrolling the depths, doing my duty in the cold, quiet dark below. I thought I’d seen everything the ocean had to offer: massive squids, deep-sea fish with teeth like knives, the eerie glow of bioluminescent creatures. But nothing could’ve prepared me for what we found on our last mission.

The mission itself was classified, something about investigating unusual seismic activity in a trench farther down than we’d ever been. No one gave us specifics, just coordinates and orders to keep it silent. “Silent running,” they said, as if the water itself was listening.

It was deep. I’m talking depths that no sub should be able to survive. The pressure outside was enough to crush any normal vessel, but we were Navy, equipped with some of the most advanced tech in the world, so we went in. As we descended, everything became darker, heavier, like the ocean itself was pressing against us, telling us to turn back. But we kept going.

After hours of descent, the sonar tech caught something—something massive. At first, we thought it was a cliff or part of the trench wall, but as we drew closer, the thing started to move. Slow, deliberate. We all froze, eyes glued to the monitors. Whatever it was, it was big, larger than any creature ever documented, stretching out in the darkness like the ocean floor had come to life.

We didn’t realize what we were looking at until the lights hit it.

It was flesh.

A mottled, dark hide covered in scars and ridges, skin like ancient leather that looked tougher than the hull of our sub. Massive scales shifted like tectonic plates, each one larger than our sub’s viewing window. It was just… lying there, almost still, as if it were asleep. And then, a single eye opened.

I’ll never forget that eye. It was black, fathomless, staring through us, into us, a cold, primal intelligence that felt… wrong. It was like looking into a void, an emptiness so deep and old that it made my skin crawl, made my mind strain to comprehend it. The creature’s gaze held something ancient, something that had been there since the dawn of time, lurking in the depths, waiting.

Then it moved.

The creature began to unfurl, layers of scaled flesh peeling back as it rose, stretching, muscles rippling under its dark skin. It was like watching an island come to life, a landmass stirring awake, something that should never have been seen by human eyes. Its body went on and on, vanishing into the darkness like it had no end.

Panic set in as we realized how small we were, how utterly helpless. The captain ordered us to ascend, full throttle. We tried to turn, to get away, but then we felt it—a low hum, deep and resonant, filling the sub with a pressure so intense it felt like the walls would cave in. It wasn’t a roar. It wasn’t even a growl. It was something worse, something ancient, like the voice of the ocean itself vibrating through our bones.

And then, it moved faster than anything that size should. It surged, filling the sonar screen with its vast, sprawling form. I swear I saw teeth the size of buildings, rows upon rows, each one jagged and scarred, dripping with some dark, viscous liquid. Its mouth was wide enough to swallow our entire sub whole.

The last thing I remember was the alarm blaring, the lights flickering as we rose. We lost power for a second, the darkness swallowing us, and in that moment, I felt it—a deep, predatory intelligence brushing against my mind, something that had been waiting, lurking, and watching.

When I woke up, we were back on the surface, drifting. None of us remember the last few minutes. The brass told us not to speak about it, ever. “A gas leak,” they said. “An underwater hallucination.” They shut us up, shut us out, transferred us to separate posts, but I can’t unsee it. I can’t forget what we found, what’s lurking down there, something too big, too old, too dangerous.

I know it’s still down there, waiting in the deep, biding its time. And every time I close my eyes, I see that endless, fathomless black eye, staring back at me. It knows I saw it. And I have this gnawing fear that one day, it’ll come looking for me.
