Emerald Cove is a small logging town in Northern California. Centered around a sprawling blue green iridescent lake the seems to glow at night. Its a pretty town by all means. Quaint and quiet. The most disturbing things we hear are cats fighting or the occasional mountain lion or pack of coyotes running through. Everyone knows everyone and nobody causes trouble. That was until a few weeks ago. Folks started having stuff turn up missing. 
First it was just gas jugs. Then thermometers. And then for some reason any yard tools or miscellaneous items that would be left out. No one ever saw anything and the thief or thieves expertly avoided detection by camera. Every-time a police report was filed. Every-time it came up empty. It has the town on edge. People are pointing fingers and forming cliques. This seemingly small strain of thefts has culminated into a tight knit community being separated and divided. Answers are demanded and no one can come up with any.

My names Kieran, Kieran Kennedy. I run a small bait shop in The Emerald Cove Marina. Emerald Cove is the biggest on the lake and a tourist attraction of sorts. 
The Marina consists of the inspection office for new boats and hub for fish and game plus sheriffs. "The Point" A small floating restaurant and bar, "Toolies" boat parts accessory and maintenance. And me. "Kennedys Bait and Tackle". A small 2 story floating store at the very end of the line of them. More than a bait shop I have maps of local attractions. Snacks and Drinks. And friendly conversation for anyone who lets me talk their ear off about how chatter-baits are hitting better than spinners in the colder water. Im getting off track. 

The Marina is home to me. I live in my shop and am out on the water Monday-Friday. Then running the shop Sat and Sun. I know this massive lake better than most and almost always catch my limit of beautiful 7-8 pound rainbow trout. Bring them back to The Point and take whatever that nights cook throws my way in exchange. The store pays for itself and lets me own a decent flat bottom boat and the newest phone and gadgets. 
Im rambling about myself now but onto the story. 

Yesterday evening I was sitting in waiting for a customer when I start to hear a commotion at the seating area in-front of The Point. I step out and walk around my porch. Through the shouting I can make out "body" "young" "fresh". Just I see the unmistakable site of a orange child sized rental life jacket being hoisted out of the water. The body is set on the deck and is clearly blueish white and swollen. I gag in my mouth at the sight. We haven't had a drowning since the house boaters a few years back. 

I step back inside to be greeted by a very stern looking pair of Cove County Sheriffs eyeing me cautiously. 
Before I can speak the officer to the right asks me to put my hands over my head and interlace my fingers. Shocked at this demand I stand wide eyed with a gaping mouth before relinquishing my posture before heeding his command and turning my back towards him. 

I am promptly pushed to my knees and handcuffed before both officers frisk me and escort me to a small barge and put me in a holding cell like compartment to the rear of the vessel. I cant see the water from this compartment. Only the inside of the boat itself. 
This is when my mind begins to collect and I notice 2 things that are very very wrong. This is a completely unmarked vessel. And "Cove County" Doesn't exist. The latter being the much more concerning of these facts. My head begins to spin as I go through every stage of grief at once. 
Finding every possible solution to my dilemma futile. I am handcuffed, In a steel chamber. On a boat. With 2 or more large men with firearms. Then it happens all at once. The motor begins to sputter to a halt and the a large crash and succeeding jolt happen from the left. 
The 2 "Officers" both start firing and yelling at and invisible force. 
Then both drop to the floor as the force counter fires them. 2 gruff men haul in and break the lock off my prison cell. They ask me to follow. I do so and go up the stairs with them to find its dark now. I must've fallen asleep somehow. 
They ask me to follow them onto their own vessel. A small yet very militaristic boat floating 5 feet below me. I board second behind the gruffer of the 2 men I step into the cabin behind him and grow faint and queasy at what I see.
