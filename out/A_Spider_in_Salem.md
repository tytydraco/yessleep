This happened to me in Salem, Massachusetts, but I do not blame anyone for calling me a liar.

I have reason to lie, to be honest (as contradictory as that sounds): I own a restaurant on Essex Street and it would be in my interest to create an urban legend so as to drum up business. People would talk about my place and what happened near it, the story might go viral (at some point), I'd be a stop on one of those walking tours the tourists and locals take all the time, especially the one done by local paranormal-expert celebrity Dr. Vitka...all kinds of positive things could happen.

So call me a liar if you want. But I will say it anyway:

I saw a giant spider on Essex Street in Salem.

No, not giant as in Cloverfield-size giant. We're not talking Kaiju-big. Honestly, I'm trying to recall it - and no, I wasn't smart enough or calm enough to remember to take video of the situation before me on my iPhone - but it's difficult to say exactly, everything is muddled in my memory concerning the whole thing. Maybe a very, very large dog, like a particularly oversized specimen of Mastiff? Maybe a small horse? Lion-sized? Really am not sure, maybe it wasn't that large.

Let's say this: it was large enough to take down a man. Not a small man, either. Big man. State-trooper-sized individual. Marine, special forces, whatever way you want to think about it.

The point is this was one big spider. And it was scary. It looked like a really creepy version of a spider. Not just run-of-the-mill tarantula. One of those more exotic species...baboon spider, tree spider, whatever. Just something worse than a pet spider. Or even a Goliath spider from the Amazon. Yeah, worse than that. Total living phobia. Just awful.

I was walking along Essex Street after closing up. Along the cobblestone. Nice picturesque area. Halloween was about twelve weeks off, so I knew this wasn't some weird prank to usher in the season.

It was nighttime. (Of course it was, now that I think about it; why wouldn't it be?) Just a sliver of moon, if that much; definitely not full, definitely not a lot of light. But this all happened in an alley where there was quite a bit of illumination sourced from the windows of nearby storefronts. To the left was a creature-wax museum, to the right a series of collectible/clothing/book shops. And the owners apparently all liked to have copious amounts of light showcasing their wares for potential customers strolling along afterhours and peeking in as they walked by. My point being: even if the moon wasn't full, I still had enough light to see what I saw.

And what I saw was a spider the size of an Irish wolfhound (or whatever) on top of a decent-sized man. They were against the brick building on the left, diagonal to me, and the spider's body, particularly the very hairy abdomen, was pumping up and down slowly, disgustingly, as presumably it was ingesting blood and fluid from its prey. The man sounded like he was still breathing; he was clearly paralyzed.

And obviously alive.

This isn't a long story (does it need to be?) because, frankly, I wasn't stupid; I didn't act the way people act in horror movies. And I'm not a hero (thankfully). I guess that's why I'm still alive.

So, yeah, wasn't, and am not currently, stupid: I walked away. Quickly.

Yes, I did call the police. Yes, the dispatch officer threatened to arrest me for pranking 911. And, yes, I did go back to that same alley the next day, in the daylight. And the nighttime.

No spider. No body. No trace.

As if it didn't happen.

Wasn't reported in The Salem News. Or the Globe. Or on Patch. No mention of it anywhere online in those local neighborhood forums.

That's it. That's my story. I saw a big spider in Salem on Essex Street. You probably think I'm a liar. But I'm not.

Do you believe me...
