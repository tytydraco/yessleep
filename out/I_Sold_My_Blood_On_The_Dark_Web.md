I didn’t know blood had value. Sure, it has the value of saving a life but when it came to donating whenever I went to a blood bank the most I’d get was a few cookies. 

College was proving more expensive then I had originally thought. Ramen noodles had become a staple meal in my life, and I struggled to hold any work down with my study. Whenever I was cramming on the last night for an exam Id get calls to come in and Id have to decline which pretty much lead to me never getting shifts again. 

One night I was clicking deeper and deeper through the dark web. I had a fascination to see what stores people had set up, what they were selling, and how much for. I never bought anything or even entertained the thought of buying anything because I had no money anyway. 

&#x200B;

I found a link titled “Blood for bitcoin. Donors needed”

I clicked through and landed to the page. There was a list of blood types, with a value per 100ml…. and it was paying heaps. My jaw dropped. I knew I was AB negative and I looked at how much they were paying. $425 per 100ml. Some of the other blood types were much less in value. O positive which I guess was the most common was only $10 per 100ml. 

&#x200B;

There wasn’t much else to see on the page but there was a contact form for people interested in donating. Without much thinking, I opened the contact form and filled it in. It just wanted to know what blood type, my email and if I had any diseases. I filled it out and hit submit. I then left the site and kept looking through other shops, mostly at the price of drugs even though I didn’t use myself but the fantasy of being some kind of Pablo Escobar crossed my mind sometimes. 

&#x200B;

A few minutes later I received a new email. The subject line was “Blood for bitcoin.” I clicked open and it was a reply to the form I filled out. It said;

&#x200B;

“Thankyou for your interest. We want your blood type. 

Please reply with the following; 

Your bitcoin wallet

Your address 

&#x200B;

On Tuesday in 1 week put a 100ml vial of your blood in your letterbox before midnight and we will collect it. Once we have collected it, we will transfer $425USD in bitcoin to your wallet address. 

If you do not leave the blood in your letterbox that night, we will not contact you again. 

If your blood is not of quality, we will not collect again.”

&#x200B;

There was also an Amazon link to buy a kit for taking blood at home, and a Youtube link to a video on how to take your own blood. 

&#x200B;

Very interesting. I thought. This might be for real. I replied back to the email. I asked if I could post it to an address instead of it being collected from my letterbox. Within moments, I received a reply. 

&#x200B;

“No. Days in post and temperature changes will ruin the blood. Provide your address and bitcoin wallet address and we will collect Tuesday night from your letterbox next week.”

&#x200B;

I thought for a moment, and wasn’t comfortable using my address, but there was an elderly man who lived next door and I'm sure he wouldn’t mind me using his letterbox in the middle of the night. I replied back “Ok, sounds good” and provided his address, and my bitcoin wallet address. I then went and ordered the blood kit from Amazon which had a next day delivery. 

&#x200B;

Time went on until it reached Tuesday night. At about 9 I was sure the neighbour had gone to sleep so it was time to draw my blood. Id watched the video, and had blood taken at donors before so had a rough idea. I put the needle in and blood started to draw to the vial. I ordered some 120ml vials, so I filled it up close to the top before pulling the needle out and applying some pressure with a cotton ball. I snuck outside to the neighbours letterbox, lifted the top and dropped the vial in. I quickly slipped back into my house while looking around to make sure the coast was clear.

&#x200B;

I went back to my room and played some games for a while. They said to do it by midnight, so I guess that means they wont come by until after then. I intended to stay up as late as I could and try see the person who came to get it, unless its all a joke from some troll on the dark web. Worst case my neighbour will find a vial of blood in his letterbox in the morning. 

&#x200B;

I turned all the lights off in my house just before midnight and sat by my bedroom window with the curtains slightly ajar so I could see the letterbox. To kill time I just sat on my phone, occasionally messaging people and scrolling reddit. Just after 1 I noticed the streetlight flicker as if something had blocked some of the light for a moment. I looked over the road and saw a tall figure dressed head to toe in black swiftly cross the road and walk to my neighbours letter box. It was wearing a black hoodie, but from what little I could glimpse from the streetlights its face and hands were a pale white. It popped the lid of the neighbours letterbox, grabbed the vial and inspected it for a moment, and then finally turned around crossing the road back into the darkness. 

&#x200B;

I closed the curtains completely and went and laid in my bed. I was a mixture of excited that I might actually get paid some money, but also disturbed after seeing its pale appearance and wondering what it wanted with the blood. 

&#x200B;

The next morning I awoke to a new email. It said; 

&#x200B;

“Delicious. I will collect 200ml next Tuesday. Do not reply. Your payment has been made” 

I checked my bitcoin wallet and it was up just over $425 that was mentioned. Once again, I was excited that I had now actually got paid, but now even more disturbed after reading the word delicious. Was it eating my blood? Even if it is, the money is worth it enough to turn a blind eye. 

&#x200B;

The week passed to the next Tuesday. I filled up 2 vials and put them out in my neighbours letterbox. I waited by my window peeking through the curtains and just after 1 the tall pale figure came through and collected it. 

&#x200B;

The next morning I checked my wallet and it was up a further $850 in value. There was another email. It only said; 

&#x200B;

“Delicious. More. 500ml”

&#x200B;

As creepy as this was, that would be $2125 and I was overly excited. At this point I didn’t care if it was eating my blood. That was 2 months of food and rent to me, and I could probably get some new clothes and some new games off Steam. I ordered some more vials off Amazon and waited out the week. 

&#x200B;

This time I did 5 vials. It felt like a lot, and seeing that much blood come out of me felt surreal. I know they do just a bit less than that each time I've given blood in the past, but doing it myself made me really anxious and I was getting a bit light headed watching myself do it. I dropped it off again and watch the same thing show up and collect it. 

&#x200B;

The payment came through the next morning followed by another email.

&#x200B;

“Delicious. Next must be 1 litre”. 

1 litre is a lot. But at the same time, its $4250 which is a lot of money. I google searched if its possible for me to do, and it looks like it would be without being fatal but there was definitely risks involved. I’d already given 800ml over the last 3 weeks. I decided to go ahead with it and ordered 10 more empty vials off Amazon. If I did this, this would be the last time, or at least the last time for a while.

&#x200B;

The following Tuesday I prepped for it. I made sure I had some sugary cookies and water handy. Id felt light headed last time so this would take a lot out of me. I sat on my bed, inserted the needle and started to fill vial after vial. After about 7 vials I was feeling light headed and felt I was going pale. The blood comes out so fast. I as I was finishing the 10th vial, I was shaking. I put the cap on the vial and held the cotton wool ball on my arm with some pressure. I sipped on some water and then held the cold bottle against my head. I was sitting down but I felt as if I was about to collapse. I spent maybe an hour sitting motionless trying not to pass out as my vision blurred occasionally. Eventually, I pulled myself up, collected the vials and put them in a small box. I had to brace myself as I made my way through my house to get outside and across to the neighbours letterbox. I placed the box in and hurried back inside. Like clockwork, just after 1 it showed up. Under the streetlight I could see a crooked smile spread across its pale face as it opened the box and looked inside. It scurried off into the darkness and I collapsed into my bed. 

&#x200B;

I checked my wallet when I woke up and the $4250 was paid to my bitcoin address. The following email was short like the rest. 

“Delicious. We like it. 1 more litre next Tuesday” 

&#x200B;

There was no way I could give another litre especially with just over a week to recover. On waking up I felt weak, and fatigued. I replied back to the email. 

&#x200B;

“Hey. I need some time to recover. I might be able to do it again next month.” 

&#x200B;

Almost instantly after sending it, I got a reply. It read;

&#x200B;

“No. 1 litre next Tuesday or else.”

I felt my stomach sink. What does it mean by ‘or else’. This thing is clearly deranged if its eating blood so I have no idea what its capable of. I sent an email back saying sorry and that I cant do it. A few seconds later it replied with the same message demanding 1 litre again or else. I left my computer at that point. There was nothing more I could do. 

&#x200B;

The week passed and Id felt drained across most of it. Just low energy and occasional head spins. It came to the Tuesday and I didn’t draw any blood. I sat by my window in the dark as it 1 o'clock ticked over. Out from the darkness I watched it scurry to the neighbours letterbox. I opened the top and paused for a moment. It started to push some of the letters inside around with agitation as if it was digging under them to see if anything was there. It stopped and stared up to the sky, and let out a loud raspy hiss that cut through the quiet night as if it was yelling in anguish. It looked around and stepped away from the letter box. 

&#x200B;

It looks like it didn’t get what it wanted. I told it in the email. There was nothing I could do for it this week. It took a step further towards the street and just as I was about close the curtain it stopped and starred straight at my window. I froze and tried not to move. All my lights were off so there was no way it could see me. Its pale face and long white fingers dangling out of the baggy black hoody faced me for what felt like an eternity. I was frozen in fear. Whatever this thing was, it was not human. It turned its head again but the the neighbour on the far sides house. It paused for a few moments, and then started walking straight across my neighbours front lawn towards his house. 

&#x200B;

I couldn’t see it anymore from my bedroom window, so I ran out of my room and to my shower window where I could see out to the neighbours side yard. I looked out and it was climbing up the side of the neighbours house in a fluid motion. Its hands seemed to just stick to the wall as it pulled itself up. It reached a window and I heard the glass smash as it punched it in and pulled itself through. 

&#x200B;

Moments later I heard my neigh start screaming. It started as him yelling for it to get out of his house and then quickly shifted to incoherent screams of terror. And then …. Bang…. Bang…. Bang….. I heard as the terrified screams continued with 3 small flashes lighting up behind the window. The screaming raised to a shrill high pitch and then stifled out and it was silent. 

&#x200B;

I started from my shower window to the neighbours window frozen. Was it dead? That was 3 gunshots. No lights were turning on in the house. I stood there frozen paralysed in fear. 2 minutes passed then its long white fingers came from inside the room gripping the window sill. It lowered itself effortlessly out and back to the yard and ran off through the backyard and into the woods behind. I could hear sirens slowly growing louder and in the corner of my eye I could see several lights on the street had switch on. The noise would have woken the whole neighbourhood. 

I starred at the woods. I could feel it was there, just on the edge of the darkness. The sound of sirens had now turned to flashing lights and I turned my gaze to the front of the property. 2 police cars had pulled up and there was a small crowd of people in their pyjamas gathering out the front to see what was going on. 

&#x200B;

I threw some shoes on and went out my front door and joined the crowd. Everyone was startled and repeating to each other they heard screaming and gunshots. 4 police officers forced the door as there was no response and had entered the house. There was some yelling inside the house and one of the officers came out and told everyone to clear back as he called in for an ambulance and backup.

A few more police cars showed up and they started to run crime scene tape around the front yard and push everyone back. I was close enough to see when the ambulance wheeled him out. He was completely pale and looked unnaturally thin. The hole side of his neck was ripped open like it was attacked by some kind of wild animal. I listened into the paramedics as they were talking to one of the officers after loading him into the back of the ambulance. 

The paramedics were saying they have never seen anything like it before. They said he was almost completely exsanguinated, like his blood had just dried up and disappeared. 

&#x200B;

Several neighbours were talking to the police about what they heard, and I overheard an officer tell one that there is no sign of bullet holes in any of the walls, but there are casings so the home invader must have been shot and is likely wounded which means its likely the police will catch whoever it was. This was giving the neighbourhood some reassurance, and the police seemed confident saying this. But I watched it pull itself out of the window. It looked like it was in no pain, and not injured at all. It made its way effortlessly out of the window, down the house and without as much as a limp escaped into the woods. 

&#x200B;

Now would have been the time to tell the police everything, but I knew that this was my fault. I gave it his address. I put the blood in the letterbox. I had it keep coming back. Am I an accessory to this? 

A police officer asked me if I had any information that could help, and I just mumbled I heard gunshots and yelling. I quickly made my way back home. I locked the doors and went to bed. It was a restless night. 

&#x200B;

The following morning I checked my emails and there was only 1 new one, and it was from the creature. I shook as I read it; 

&#x200B;

“Your neighbour was not as delicious. 1 litre next Tuesday or your next. No more pay. Feed me or die.” 

&#x200B;

I emailed it back. I made it an offer. A way for me to live and be free of it. I can’t give it 1 litre of my blood every week. I just cant. 

&#x200B;

Its Saturday as I’m writing this. I still feel weak and I don’t know if I can draw much more blood for it. I’m reaching out here for help. If anyone has AB negative blood, I will buy your blood for bitcoin. Just message me where you live and your bitcoin wallet address. Leave a 100ml vial in your letterbox before midnight on Tuesday. 

Ill organise for it to be collected.
