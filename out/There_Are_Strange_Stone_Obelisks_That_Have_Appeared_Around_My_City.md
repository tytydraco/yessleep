It started with one. The first obelisk-like structure had appeared about a half a year ago but I, and it seems many others, didn't think much of it. It was in a spot that had been cleared and had a fence around it, it looked like the city was placing the foundation for a new building. My city always seemed to be in the midst of construction, so it wasn't unusual. The second, the third, all the way up to the seventh appeared within the next couple of weeks; I began to notice something was off when nothing else happened for months. Now, as I mentioned, my city went through construction frequently which meant that some projects would be put on the backburner; the two things that were strange were that: firstly they were pretty big, which would imply that the building would be relatively important but it was as if the city hadn't touched the project in months. Now the second and most prevalent point was that throughout the appearance of the first and seventh one, I hadn't seen a single piece of construction equipment the entire time.

 I always went past the site on my commute to school, so I saw them almost daily and yet I didn't see any construction stuff throughout that period of time. Such big structures had seemingly popped into existence; for all I know, they very well could have. I don't always see the construction site, it's not like I tried to look for it daily; even still, It was odd I never saw any gradual progress. It was like they just appeared one by one in their entirety but I eventually forgot about it, as nothing new happened... that was until one appeared near my community.

This was when the all-too familiar feeling of anxiety began to clutch my heart; how? How did this happen? This wasn't like the ones that I saw before; those were downtown, and I had seen them on the bus on my way to school. They were in an area that got a lot of construction for big buildings, not in the suburbs. This one had also appeared in the middle of a field, not a cleared lot surrounded by a fence. I had looked at the other ones with more attention before and the obelisk that appeared in the field was identical. The next one appeared the following day.

 This is when I started investigating. I asked around but everyone seemed to chalk it up to construction, as I had at first. I asked at least ten people I knew; of those ten, only 3 seemed to think it was even a little odd. When I went to google, nothing seemed to pop up; all I got were results about construction projects around the city. It is important to note that none of the results involved the strange obelisks. Over the course of the next month, more had appeared. Another strange thing that could have been brushed off is the weather being odd. The city I live in is no stranger to weird weather phenomenon; It's snowed in June before, the day can go from beautiful and sunny to thunderstorms. The weird part is that the changes are normally random and last for a week at most, but it's been cloudy for weeks now.

 More and more began popping up, I counted twenty one time. The city had attempted to close off the areas, but the rate they popped up was too quick to keep up with; obelisks also began appearing inside of already existing buildings.  I gave up on asking people as they seemed almost brainwashed; every time I would ask about anything not involving the obelisks, it would be a normal conversation. For example:

"Hey, the city's been a little off lately huh?"

"Yeah, the weather's been a bitch." and I would respond 

"Yeah, not to mention the weird stone pillars appearing around the city" they would look at me, confused and say

"The what now? I haven't noticed anything like that, maybe it's construction?"

 That brings us to the time I'm writing this, I'll use this a journal of sorts now.

Day 1: I'm starting at day one because I don't know the exact day the first obelisk appeared. I went to school today and talked to my friends, went home when it was done, then went to my computer to try and do more research. Nothing of note.

Day 2: Same as yesterday, it's Friday today so I'll have some free time on the weekend. I'll try to ask people about the obelisks tomorrow, google isn't going to help me anymore; not like it was much help in the first place anyway.

Day 3: I asked my mom about it today, here's the conversation:

"Hey mum?"

"Mhm?"

"Do you think the city'll get any better?"

"I'm not sure, probably. We're just in a rough patch right now"

"Right. So have you seen the stone obelisks around the city?"

"The what? I don't think so"

"alright, just wondering"

I'm scared, I don't know what to do anymore. It seems like I'm the only one who notices.

Day 4: I had a weird dream last night. It was about the obelisks, but I don't remember what happened in it. The rest of the day passed on as usual.

Day 5: The school was closed today, I guess I have more free time to do nothing. I just travelled around the city today; there are so many obelisks now, I lost count.

Day 6: Since I don't have school anymore, I'll be able to write more in-depth. I had another weird dream last night, the same one as before. I ate breakfast and did my usual morning routine, conversing with my family.

"You never talk to us anymore" My mum jokingly whined, "You just go on your computer all day"

"Not really, I had school and homework is all" I said, not taking my eyes off my bowl of cereal

My brother responded with a slight sarcastic grin and said: "Not anymore, apparently"

"That means you can spend more time with us!" Mum had said with her usual enthusiasm that left you wondering if there was something behind her words

"Totally" I chuckled as I stood up from the table and walked towards the door, leaving the usual banter behind me. I took my longboard with me and rode around aimlessly, not sure what to do.

After a while, I had decided to go to the store then see if some of my friends wanted to hang out. No one was free, unfortunately, which left me on my own for the day. Most busses at this point weren't in service except for five; I took one downtown, deciding to just skate around. I was riding past an obelisk when I saw him, someone looking at an obelisk. I stopped in my tracks, nearly falling over as I approached him.

"Hey! what are you doing?"

He turned towards me, looking confused "What do you mean?"

"Do you see it too?" I asked, full of anxiety and anticipation

His eyes widened as he slowly nodded.

 His name was Darren, and his situation was very similar to mine. Darren had seen something I hadn't though, he saw how the obelisks appear. He told me that it fell from the sky.

"Wait, seriously?" the look of shock on my face probably looked ridiculous

"Yeah, just fell down, but it hit the ground like a feather dude"

My mind immediately revved up its engine as it raced, dancing from thought to thought.

"Hey, you listening dude?" 

I snapped back to reality "Oh shit, no, sorry"

He sighed "I was just talking about how I've met two others like us, who can see the obelisks"

"Shit, for real?"

"yeah, Sarah and James. I was just saying how we should all meet up and you tell them what you've noticed"

I thought about it. As much as I wanted to, I wanted to write all of this down first; just in case they were a cult or something. "Maybe tomorrow, I need to process what you told me"

He nodded, understanding, and we parted ways. On my way home I thought about the implications of what I had just learnt, what it could mean. Aliens? God? Maybe new military weapons? I had no clue what to think. I'm going to meet the others tomorrow. If all goes well, I'll write tomorrow.

Day 7: I met up with Darren and we went to his house, there I had met Sarah and James. They told me what they knew about the obelisks.

"Yeah, I noticed that any obelisk that lands in a natural area seems to suck the life around it out" James had said, sipping his drink

"Me too, they also have a strange spiritual presence" Sarah chimed in, addressing me. I turned to Darren, a confused look on my face. He shrugged with a look that seemed to say 'we needed all the help we could get'

I turned back to the other two "Anything else?" They both shook their heads apologetically. I nodded and began thinking, the other three let me digest the information before Darren spoke up

"No one here has touched one, correct?" everyone nodded

"I think we should, we need to learn more-"

"What?! Absolutely not!" James protested, his eyes wide.

"How else are we supposed to learn more?!" Darren shouted back, his words dripping in frustration.

"How are we supposed to know it won't kill us?!" James countered

"So what?! You'd rather sit around doing nothing?!"

Sarah just sat there, not knowing how to stop the fight

"I'd rather live than throw my life away!"

I stood up "Listen, we haven't gone through all of our options, right? let's just calm down and think this through!"

They both went quiet, sitting back down in their chairs

"Alright." Darren said finally, looking over at James

"I completely agree"

Sarah simply nodded.

We all parted ways soon after, deciding to try a couple of experiments tomorrow.

Here's what I know so far: The obelisks started to appear around half a year ago, they fell from the sky, they appear to affect the weather and seemingly drain life from its surroundings; nobody seems to notice them except for a handful of people, and finally: Someone in control of the city can see them.
