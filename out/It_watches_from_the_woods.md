   
I hope you're getting this I'm not sure if I'll get another chance to get this out. There's a story I need to share. of a creature that lurks just beyond the edge of sanity. I know it may sound like the ramblings of a madman, but I assure you, every word of it is true.  
It all began one cold night, much like any other. I just bought a little cabin on the outskirts of town. I got it for a steal since no one had wanted it for over a decade it needed repairs. But nothing a few weeks of hard work couldn't fix.  The cabin was nestled amid a dense thicket of trees, Shrouded in darkness even during the day. Despite the isolation, I found solace in the quiet serenity of the woods. They reminded me of better times when I used to go camping with my dad. We would rent a cabin on the weekends to get away from the rest of the world. He and I would go fishing and tell stories by the campfire.  
 I suppose it's why I felt so drawn to this place. These woods remind me of him. I remember his last few days. He looked so weak and tired. Dad had lost a third of his body weight and his right foot to infection. Small red spots covered his skin he Couldn't even leave his bed towards the end because it hurt too much for him to move. He said it felt like his bones were snapping under his weight When he passed away. It was honestly a mercy. The man who used to once tower above carrying me on his shoulders was in so much pain he looked so small lying there in that hospital bed. I miss him dearly not a day goes by that I don't think of him.  
It hurts a little less every day. I still want to feel close to him like he's still here with me. Suppose that's one of the reasons why I bought this place. That and the work keep's my mind off it. If I ever feel like I'm missing him. I can always come here.  
At first, everything seemed normal. The days passed in a blur of fixing holes in the roof and parts of the wall that looked like they were about to fall over, and I soon fell into a comfortable routine. After the first two weeks, it started to look good as new.  
 One day when I was putting new tiles on the roof.  Something just on the edge of my sight caught my attention. It looked like something was moving at the tree line I stood up to get a better look. By the time I could get a good view it was gone. I climbed down the ladder and grabbed my shotgun just to be safe. I knew that there were bears out this time of year looking for food. Searching around the edge of the tree line to see if there were any tracks. To my surprise there were but not like any I'd ever seen before they looked almost like a man's. But they were far too big! Whatever left them had to have been heavy to leave such a deep imprint. I walked back to the cabin. Keeping my eyes open to make sure whatever left those prints wasn't following me. I decided that was enough work for today.   
A few days after that strange, things started happening inconsequential occurrencesâ€”a misplaced key. But eventually, things started to escalate into something far more sinister. Late at night, I would wake up to sounds like whispers echoing through the halls.   
I would get up to check only to find nobody was there. I had locked the doors and the windows. I thought it may have been a draft going through the old cabin.  
I tried to brush it off as my imagination ran wild, but the whispers. Kept growing louder, more insistent until they seemed to be coming from everywhere. I would lie awake for hours unable to shake the feeling that something was watching me.  
And then came the dreams. I was plagued, by visions of twisted, nightmarish landscapes populated by grotesque creatures. Every night, I would wake up drenched in sweat.  
Deep-down I knew it had to be something more.  I started to question my own sanity. I was probably just stressed a lot had happened to me in the past two years. Fixing up this old cabin. There must be mold or something in the walls. And I've simply been too preoccupied to notice. I mean this was all just to distract myself after all.  
But that was before the scratching. It started out so light and almost unnoticeable. Like a branch or twig brushing against the cabin. The first couple of nights I ignored it. Until one night when I went to grab some wood. I saw that there were tiny scratch marks by the window. I moved closer to examine them. I could tell they were from an animal with large claws just by looking at them. Now animals were trying to get into my cabin.   
That was it. I had enough I couldn't take any more nightmares no more sleepless nights. I was getting out of this forest. Far away from this. But it was already getting dark as much as I didn't want to spend another moment up here. I couldn't take my chances on the dark mountain roads with nearly no reception. This cabin was Miles away from civilization.  knowing I was stuck here I decided that I would leave first thing in the morning.  
So that night I locked the windows and just in case I barricaded the doors. I wasn't taking any more chances. I had my shotgun beside my bed.  A few hours passed but the sound of scratching at the front door woke me up. It was light at first but grew louder and louder. I held my gun to my chest. Thoughts of whatever was scratching at the door flooded my mind. The noises moved from the door around the cabin like it was looking for a way inside. After about an hour the scratching stopped I thought it might have left. But I was too afraid to go check.   
That's when something even worse started. A familiar voice. A deep horror began to fill me. something I thought I would never hear again. "Ch-Charlie it's so COLD OUT HERE...let me in." It was my dad's voice. I knew it couldn't be he was dead it wasn't really him matter how much I wanted it to be. I was there when he passed away. Saw the life Drain from his eyes as he took his last breath. This thing was impersonating him. TRYING TO GET ME TO LET IT INSIDE.  
 Hours..... passed that way. I was emotionally and physically exhausted. It wasn't till the sunrise that the voices stopped. I slowly approached the window to see if there were any signs of the creature. All I saw were footprints circling the cabin. I knew it was now or never. I approached the door with my shotgun in hand. I slowly moved the table from the front door. As I slowly opened IT. I was half expecting to see the monster standing there. Waiting for me to make a break for it. But There was nothing there. I wasn't going to waste this opportunity. I ran to my truck hopped into the driver's seat, and started the engine. And tried to drive off but something was wrong. I looked in my rearview mirror to realize in my haste. I hadn't realized that the tires had been slashed.  
A feeling of dread washed over me. As I realized there was no way. I was getting out of here. I couldn't drive back to town with no tires. I got out my phone to see if I had any reception. Only one bar I tried to call for help. But the line was dead. I was stranded. Now I understood why it didn't break down the door and drag me out. It didn't have to. It knew I wasn't going anywhere. And It knew that it could take its time. Until I wanted to let it inside the cabin. I can't call for help so that's why. I'm writing this now.  
If my calls don't get through. Maybe this will. If it does and you're reading this don't bother sending help. It's already too late for me. I can hear it at the door. The game is over. Now it wants its prize. I'm waiting just in front of the door my guns ready. I'm not going down without a fight. Not that I think I'll do much. I guess what I'm trying to say is. If you see a small cabin for sale do yourself a favor and don't buy it.  
 Because you never know what might be lurking out in the woods.
