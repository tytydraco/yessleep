\*\*

I haven’t gotten a single night of good sleep since I opened Uncle Howard’s box. After waking up with raw, bleeding fingers outside of the garage door, I bought cheap but sturdy handcuffs from Party City and started chaining myself to the bedpost in the evening. While I lie there, waiting to slip into another disquieting dream, I can see the journal in my mind’s eye, lying quietly in the box, in the dark.

This morning, while my wrist ached from trying to free itself in the night and my brow hosted a layer of cold sweat, I sat on the edge of the bed. I was starting to splinter under the weight of the events of the past couple of weeks; I was tired, so *fucking tired*, and the stress was making me question myself, if I truly belonged here – in this house, on this bed. Everything felt wrong, fake, as if I had crossed into a world where I no longer had any agency. I’ve probably never had any anyway.

In my formative years, I fibbed constantly. Little lies, like adding a half point to my GPA in conversation or buying expensive sneakers during the holiday season to pretend I had gotten normal gifts and not adjustable suspenders (“Hollywood lies, Wyatt! This is the real deal, this is what your great-grandfather would have worn when he was traipsing the Sierra Nevada!”).  

The fibs eventually became flat-out falsifications, glimpses into my ideal reality: where my father was a father and not a low-functioning alcoholic, where I was going to turn out okay and not just like him. My obsession with normalcy spiraled; I spent weeks filling out cursive workbooks at night in order to scribble convincing notes from my “mother” in my lunches. “I love you! Have an amazing day,” they would read. “Have fun at school!” I’d scoff and make a show of throwing it away. 

Much too early to correct, I started eating away at myself. The guilt gnawed at me, the regret that I couldn’t will my fictions into existence eroded my ambition; the comfort of evading shame from outside judgment won instead of the comfort of self-respect. I brought the habit into my adulthood, too. I tell imaginary stories, conjure surface-level problems to seem relatable, and create comfy characters to fill the gaping hole. I hold opinions that aren’t mine, espouse convictions without conviction. Even before the journal surfaced on my doorstep, I would watch my fiancé sleep and feel a deep, sinking shame, because I was a collection of lies, a bundle of wishes on shooting stars, and she might never know how truly far apart we were. 

*But then, where does the journal fit?*

It seemed fated, a day I had been waiting for, or a destiny unrealized. Perhaps it’s the way out. A path to redemption. 

*YES.*

*Keeping it in my garage, hiding it – what if that was the wrong answer?* 

*YES.*

*It’s an opportunity for change. To start over and start to write a new narrative, one where I don’t get scared by what I don’t understand. To forge my own fate.* 

*YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES*

Steeled with this newfound conviction, I rose from the bed with a strength and purpose I hadn’t felt in a long time. I strolled, almost gliding, to the garage door, passively noticing that it was no longer locked. I wrapped my hand around the knob and pushed, revealing a pitch-black room. It was strangely dark, as if it was nullifying all of the light that tried to spread inside. I reached my hand in to turn the light switch on–

A dry tut emanated from a sinister, raspy voice somewhere in the garage. Part of me expected something like this to happen, but that expectation accomplished nothing in the face of the wave of shivers exploding throughout my body. *I’m going to have my fucking way for once,* I thought. 

“Oh yes, Wyatt. You can have your way. YES,” the voice hissed. I jumped. “Because *your* way is *my* way.” A loud, hacking chortle pierced the blackness. 

*What does that mean?*

I waited. Silence. I reached my hand further into the dark and cursed the distance the light switch was from the doorway. I strained my arm, stretching it as far as it could go, trying to limit the amount my left half was exposed to the sticky blackness of the garage. My fingers groped for the switch. I’d spent a lot of time in this room, clearing the previous owner’s hoard of antique 1980’s furniture. I knew where the light was, and I never remembered it being this far. In the murky shadow I searched, waiting for the hoarse, unnatural voice to break the silence. 

“You don’t think, Wyatt,” the voice jeered. “I do your thinking for you.” 

*There it was*. I found it. I fumbled, but finally got a two-finger grip on the switch and pulled it up. 

To my surprise, the light actually turned on. It illuminated a cramped but otherwise undisturbed room, the owner of the voice not visible. I stepped through the threshold and toed, still on edge, to the corner of the garage. Next to a veritable pile of paint cans stood the box, small but teeming with malice, practically pulsating. 

I felt a warm breeze hit my ear. It tickled, like a fly had grazed against it. I reached down towards the box, arms extended. My ear twitched again: the same feeling. I froze. I recognized what that breeze was, from years of sleeping next to someone. *It was breathing.* Something outside of my peripheral view was breathing wetly into my ear. I could smell it now – putrid and sour, reeking of rotting meat. 

“Why… do you think you came in here?” it gurgled. “It’s because I made you.”

“You didn’t make me do anything,” I squeaked.

“Those thoughts that brought you into this room… WYATT. They are MINE, not yours. I am the one who put them there.”

I felt a long, slender hand run through my hair, sloughing off what I can only assume was chunks of soft, decaying flesh, exposing the bone, which started to scratch my scalp painfully. I groaned in pain.

“Poor Wyatt… No mommy… no daddy,” it shrieked gleefully. “but soooooooo much DOUBT!” The voice erupted into shrill, unhinged giggling. 

I felt a cold wetness dribble on my ear. Drool. A drop of blood from my raw scalp plopped on the floor; we were in a standstill. It was waiting for me to do something, say something, and I was afraid of what its response would be. My thoughts whirled with uncontrollable fears, drawing a picture of this invisible monster. In my mind, it was slender and tall, leathery gray shriveled skin with long, rangy appendages and a hunched back, leaning ever closer with beady black eyes and an eerie sharp-toothed grin, flesh caught in its blackened teeth. This image petrified me. There was nothing more terrifying than that. *There was nothing more terrifying than that.*

There was a brief moment where two warring forces in my soul stopped fighting and looked at me. It was a beautiful pause, one where the evil around me ceased to exist; it made sense, it made so much sense in that moment, of course that’s how it was. My facilities slowly returned, and I laughed heartily. Booming, it echoed in the garage, bouncing off the walls and doubling, tripling in magnitude; it didn’t quite sound like me, an edge that I had never noticed twinging my echoing guffaws. *It makes so much sense.* 

I sprung into action, leaping over to the pile of paint cans and grabbing one of the thin handles with two hands. I blindly swung the can with my full weight. Right before the climax of the swing, I saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I was right, it wasn’t as scary as I imagined. Nowhere close. 

*Thunk.* I hit it, hard. The creature, which was at the very least much smaller than I expected it to be, burst into a busy cloud of – what was that, pine needles? – without so much as a whimper. I stood amid the gently falling needles, drinking in my real and symbolic victory, and the fresh aroma of the trees. I got to thinking.

It makes sense. Every single frightening event that’s happened since the journal came has been just that: scary. Not dangerous, or life-threatening, only taking advantage of my shortcomings, fears, and uncertainty. That realization gave me relief; my intuition had been screaming at me each time I faced those *somethings,* the photograph, the nightmares, the creature in the garage, that I was going to die without any doubt. Maybe that was no longer true.

There was not much else to do but get to the reason I came to the garage in the first place. I plodded back to the corner where the box lay. I stared at it for a few beats, drunk in its innocence, and briefly lamented the loss of mine. Somberly, I pulled it open. The journal was still there, and I wasted no time anticipating some horrifying event; I flipped the cover and turned to the first page. 

The cursive was hard to make out at first. It was like no handwriting I’d ever seen before – instead of the swirling, uniform script I had studied as a child, the leading and trailing lines of each letter were connected, independent of the word. The As had a closed system circle from the beginning of the letter to the end that looked reminiscent of an at sign. Each other letter was similarly cryptic. I slowly started translating. The first word: *Ahjikz.* It wasn’t English. It wasn’t even a language I recognized. 

My great-grandfather was American, he spoke English, so why was his journal in another tongue? I turned to the next page, to see if it was the same pseudo-language. It was blank. Blank? *What?* I kept flipping through the pages – they were all empty. 

I sat, looking at the first page, staring at the psychedelic font, expecting the puzzle pieces to somehow come together and reveal some hidden meaning. I was on the garage floor for a long time, until the lack of sunlight filtering through the cloudy glass in the garage door jerked me from my trance. I took one last hard look at the mystifying passage, trying to will something forward. An answer, perhaps. 

Suddenly, the words on the first page started to leak. The ink sunk, cloudy and expanding, slowly taking over the page until the entire sheet of paper was the darkest shade of black. Only one word remained in the very center of the page, one that wasn’t there before, in perfect English cursive. 

*Newcomer.*

The word disappeared, completing the page’s transformation into an empty, striking darkness. It hit me with the same dread as the bottom of the ocean or the depths of a pit would, something unknowable and unescapable. It began pulling at me then; I couldn’t take my eyes off the page, and my hands and arms moved on their own, lifting it closer to my face, closer and closer until I couldn’t see anything but the void, my eyes closed and opened, but saw the same nothingness and among all of this fascinating melancholy I hardly noticed that I was losing consciousness. The tugging didn’t quell, no, I was being led somewhere through the dark, somewhere I wanted to go. And I was about to find out where.
