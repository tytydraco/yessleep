CASE REPORT

Department: Grants Pass Police Department

Case Number: 19-DOA-3493

Reporting Officer: Det. G. Urbina

Date/Time of Report: 11/16/2019 - 08:04

Location: W Jones Creek Road

Summary:

At approximately 05:45 AM, 2 police officers were dispatched to investigate a seemingly abandoned vehicle discovered left on the side of W Jones Creek Road. The vehicle, a 2011 Chevrolet Camaro LT Coupe 2D is registered to Andrew Terrance Good, residing in an apartment roughly half a mile from the location the vehicle was discovered. Analysis of mold in the fabric of the vehicle and overgrowth surrounding the tires indicates the vehicle had been in the exact location it was found in for approximately 8 months before being discovered. Andrew Good was found deceased in the trunk of the vehicle.



Examination of Andrew’s corpse contradicts the condition of the car and the dashcam footage found within it. Alongside the aforementioned state of the vehicle, dashcam footage retrieved from an SD card indicates that the subject died on March 5th, at 23:17. Despite this, all forensic analysis conducted on the body indicates that the body had died only hours prior to examination, despite multiple attempts of analysis being executed. This seems to lead to the conclusion that the body exhibits no signs of decomposition inconsistent with the estimated postmortem interval.



Mold is also present in the trunk of the vehicle which Andrew was found, though it seems to have grown in an irregular formation. Growth ceases around 3 inches from any point where Andrew’s body made contact with the trunk of the vehicle, indicating that the mold cannot grow in proximity to the body. No known natural phenomena allow for this type of growth. Aside from those of Andrew’s found on the steering wheel, no fingerprints have been found anywhere in or outside of the vehicle.

Dashcam Footage Analysis:

\[03/05/2019 – 22:45:12\] - Vehicle in motion, driver traveling at approximately 44 mph on W Jones Creek Road. Driver has no music playing but is humming. No visible signs of disturbance or distress are noticeable.



\[03/05/2019 – 22:58:03\] - Driver takes a left turn into an unidentifiable road. The terrain visible at the location of the turn indicates it is the same location which Andrew and the vehicle were discovered, though no indications of the route Andrew had taken are present. No visible signs of disturbance or distress are noticeable.



\[03/05/2019 – 22:58:30\] - Faint choir music can briefly be heard. There is no indication of the driver using the speakers to play this music, nor does he show any reaction to it. No visible signs of disturbance or distress are noticeable.



\[03/05/2019 – 23:04:12\] - Visuals are briefly cut, before returning. From this point onwards no terrain outside of the car can be seen. Driver quickly looks over his shoulder into the backseat, turns back with a noticeably pensive expression.



\[03/05/2019 – 23:07:19\] - A somewhat muffled voice can be heard speaking to Andrew. Andrew seems to hear it and responds in a hushed tone. An elongated exchange between Andrew and this unidentified voice continues for several minutes. Andrew noticeably grows more weary the longer the conversation continues. No specific words or phrases have been made out from either party.



\[03/05/2019 – 23:16:42\] - Intermediate movement can be seen within the backseat alongside the previously heard choir music.



\[03/05/2019 – 23:16:56\] - Visuals cut to a strange instance of corrupted footage, displaying colorful, symmetrical patterns, comparable to that of a kaleidoscope. Audio remains in tact, and the trunk can be audibly heard unlatching as the car comes to a stop. 



\[03/05/2019 – 23:17:23\] - Footage suddenly cuts to black. No further audio can be heard, recording terminates shortly after.



Autopsy Findings:

Physical Condition: No signs of livor mortis, rigor mortis, post-mortem bloating, or visible decay have been detected. Body seems to have been preserved in some capacity, though no embalming measures have been observed.

Cause of Death: Intermediate. No signs of physical trauma or asphyxiation are present. Body is free of external substances or chemicals.



Notes (For Internal Review Only):

Officer S. Palladini (Tech Unit) has suffered two since the reviewing of the dashcam footage. This is assumed to be somehow caused by the kaleidoscope-like visuals around the end of the footage.

Pathology team suggests sending tissue samples for deeper analysis.

Federal inquiry submitted. Case flagged for restricted internal review.
