I don’t want sympathy. I’m not looking for theories about sleep deprivation or campfire smoke messing with my head.

I just want someone to tell me I’m not crazy.

Because I know what I heard in those trees. I know what I saw just outside the firelight. I know what it left behind.

You can say I’m mistaken. That’s fine.

Just don’t tell me it wasn’t real.

It was my friend Marcus’s idea. It’s always Marcus’s idea—winter hikes, off-trail shortcuts, rafting when the river advisories say don’t. I usually give him a hard time and go anyway. But this time I pushed back more than usual.

“Where is it?” I asked.

“Old service road, maybe an hour off the highway.” He was scrolling on his phone, showing me a satellite view. A smear of green, a thin silver line, and then nothing—no campsites, no picnic icons, no little tent symbol. “Guy on a hunting forum flagged a clearing way out past the marked trails. Said it was quiet. No trash. No sign anyone’s camped there in years.”

“It’s posted?”

He shrugged. “Land management map says public. Nobody’s going to be out there.”

I should’ve said no.

We left early Friday—tents, water filters, a hatchet, lanterns, my old Polaroid camera because I liked the way photos feel when they develop in your hand. The truck rattled up a rutted road and died in a patch of gravel and weeds. Past that, the trees closed in. No cell service. No noise from the highway. Just us.

We cut through knee-high ferns and ankle-grabbing roots, worked our way deeper, and deeper, until the forest swallowed the ribbon of sky behind us. Marcus checked his grandfather’s brass compass every twenty minutes, tapping the glass like it would balk if he didn’t remind it of north. He had flagging tape—bright orange—looped around his wrist. Every hundred yards he tied a strip to a branch.

“Belt and suspenders,” he said, nodding at the compass and the tape. “No one’s getting lost.”

Four hours later, we reached the clearing.

It was bigger than I expected. Not a meadow—nothing as soft as that—but a broad circle of flattened grass surrounded by tall pines and black spruce. The ground sat strangely level, like someone had shaved the ridge and pressed it flat with a giant hand. No fire rings. No bottle caps. Not even old ash kicked into dirt. The place felt untouched.

And very, very quiet.

No wind. No birds. Not even the invisible hiss of insects that usually fills the spaces between trees. It felt like the forest had paused mid-breath to listen.

“Feels dead,” I said.

Marcus grinned. “Feels perfect.”

We set camp at the edge of the circle—two tents, a low fire pit scraped to mineral soil, food hung in a bear bag high on a limb. The light slid down the trunks and pooled at the base of the trees until it all went the color of copper. I snapped a Polaroid of the clearing—the pale grass, the two tents, the orange tape flickering on the perimeter like desperate little flags—and tucked the picture warm into my jacket pocket.

We ate beans and jerky cross-legged by the fire. Marcus told a story about his grandfather giving him the compass and telling him never to trust a trail that looks too easy.

“Like this one?” I asked, nodding toward the opening we’d carved into the brush.

He poked the fire. “This isn’t a trail.”

The shadows stretched thin and long. The trees’ silhouettes leaned over us until the circle of sky was a coin you could cover with your palm. I tried to name constellations. They seemed wrong. Shifted. The stars looked too sharp, like points punched through a black sheet.

When the fire burned down to heart-coals, we crawled into our tents. The nylon mushed the world into soft shapes and softer sounds. The zipper teeth muttered closed. I lay on my back and watched my breath fog the beam of my headlamp.

Sometime after midnight, I woke to a sound.

Not twigs popping. Not the light patter of a deer stepping cautious through brush.

Breathing.

Slow. Heavy. In and out, like bellows. Not close, not far. Just past the reach of the firelight, where the clearing pressed against the dark. It paced, measured, circling. The breaths didn’t match the rhythm of mine. They didn’t match Marcus’s, either; I could hear his soft, regular snore through the fabric. This was deeper. Deliberate. Something that enjoyed the drag of air.

Then the scrape.

Not on rocks. On bark. The long whisper of something hard and pointed drawn down a trunk. A pause. Another trunk. Another pause. Around us.

I held my breath until my chest hurt, until my body insisted on air and I let a little out and drew a little in, trying to move the tent as little as possible.

The breaths went on.

At some point—with no sound marking it—the air felt different. Thinner. Cleaner. The breathing wasn’t gone, exactly. It was… sated. Or amused. Or something I don’t have a word for.

When I woke again, it was gray morning and my mouth tasted like I’d been sucking pennies. Marcus had the camp stove going and kept glancing over my shoulder at the trees.

“You hear anything?” he asked.

“Breathing,” I said.

He nodded once, like that was an answer he’d been waiting for and didn’t like. “We’ll check the treeline after coffee.”

We followed the orange tape we’d tied the day before, shaking night from our legs. Fifteen feet into the trees, there were marks on a spruce: four parallel grooves, deep as a thumbnail is wide, scored from shoulder height down to the roots. The cuts were clean. Not bear. Not anything with a claw that tears and splinters. It looked like someone had carved meat from the wood with a blade that wasn’t smooth.

We found more marks. On three different trunks around the clearing, all at the same height. All pointed inward.

“Cougar?” I said, even though I knew that wasn’t right.

“Cougars don’t do that,” Marcus said. His fingers brushed the grooves and came back with resin shining. Fresh.

We left it. We had a day to fill, and pretending things are normal is an easy way to move your legs. We took the stream trail Marcus swore he’d seen on a topo map. It wasn’t a trail, exactly, but it was a depression in the duff that suggested other feet had once passed through. The forest opened a little into a place where light caught in the needles like dust and the water ran in a black vein across stones.

On the opposite bank, I saw them.

Carvings, in a dead oak that leaned over the creek. Dozens, maybe hundreds of little figures razor-cut into the bark, each no bigger than a matchbox. The same symbol over and over: a human shape bent backward so far its spine made a circle. Thin arms extended, thin legs braced, head tipped to the sky or where the sky should be if there weren’t trees.

Every one of them faced the direction of our clearing.

“Hey,” I said, pointing.

Marcus stared for a long time. “Those weren’t here last time.”

Last time. My skin tightened. “You’ve been out here before?”

He didn’t answer. He crouched and wetted a handkerchief in the stream, then scrubbed the closest marks. The water ran gray and then pinkish. The carvings had bled; whoever made them had cut through live cambium. He touched the pocket with his compass like he was checking it was still there.

We said very little the rest of the day.

Back at the clearing, we rebuilt the fire and stacked extra wood within reach. I swapped dead batteries for fresh. The first stars blinked through. I took another Polaroid, more to busy my hands than to make a record: tents, fire, Marcus’s profile in the orange light, the ring of trees beyond.

The smell came just after full dark.

Sweet and wrong. Not garbage, not skunk, not rot exactly. Like fruit syrup that’s been heated and left to sit until it turns. It moved before the breathing did, a soft ribbon of scent that slipped over the circle, tasting us, then slid back to the black.

Marcus’s knuckles were white around the haft of the hatchet. “Stay put,” he said, like I was thinking of wandering off.

The breathing started again.

Closer this time. It drew around us like a tide around an island. In and out, slow enough to count. Something scraped wood—lightly at first, then with pressure, then lightly again, like fingers testing grain.

My lantern stuttered. Not out. Just a slow dimming and brightening like a pulse syncing to the breaths.

The laugh came after.

If you can call it a laugh. Sound shaped wrong. A lung pushing air and catching on something to make it rise at the edges. Amusement without a mouth.

It froze me harder than the breathing.

The shadows at the edge of the clearing leaned; that’s the only way I can say it. The dark pushed itself closer, not by walking but by sort of reorganizing where it was. The fire had to decide how far it reached, and it chose us and nothing else.

Something stood just beyond that reach.

I saw the outline as a cut in the dark, not because it reflected light but because it refused it. Tall. Much too tall. Arms long and loose at its sides. Shoulders pointed. Ribs like the slats of an old barrel. A head tilted the wrong way, like a listening dog that doesn’t understand you.

I brought the Polaroid to my face and pressed the shutter.

The flash punched a hole in the night.

When it collapsed back in, the edge of the clearing was empty. The smell thickened.

We didn’t say a word. We didn’t sleep. Every noise meant the same thing so words weren’t useful anymore.

By dawn, mist hung knee-high over the grass. Everything that should have felt like relief just felt like a reprieve.

I checked the Polaroid as we packed.

The clearing wasn’t there. No trees. No tents. No auras of firelight. The whole frame was a wash of whiteness like snow with no texture. Centered on it—perfectly centered—was a little figure, bent backward into a circle.

Smiling with a mouth thin as a cut.

My first thought was that the camera was broken. But when I lifted it, I could feel the warm square still developing under my thumb. The lens was intact. The shutter had worked, and something had worked back.

“We’re leaving,” Marcus said. His voice was raw from not talking.

We should have made it back in three hours. It took us nine.

The forest we entered wasn’t the forest we left. The orange tape we’d tied on the way in hung in different places—higher on some trees, lower on others, and on one trunk it was threaded through a ring of gouges like someone had looped it into a smile. We reached places we didn’t remember passing and didn’t reach places we should have hit. The compass needle trembled in a slow circle no matter how often Marcus tapped the glass.

By mid-afternoon, I saw our own footprints in a patch of damp loam where a seep ran across the path. I felt a rush of relief—proof of a loop we could break if we only turned—but when I pressed my boot into the print it didn’t match. The tread pattern was right. The size was right. But the angle of the heel, the depth of pressure, the place where I scuffed my toe—none of it lined up with the way I walked. It was like the forest had traced my step wrong, or decided to try wearing it.

We stopped at a low rise to drink. That’s when I noticed the cairns.

Little stacks of rocks, no higher than my knee, circled the knoll. The top stone on each pile was a thin, flat piece carved with the same figure as the tree—the bent spine, the ring, the narrow arms—scratched with something sharper than a knife. Every cairn faced the direction we were traveling. All of them were new; their bases sat on leaves that hadn’t browned or curled. One stack had a feather tucked under the top stone. The feather was wet with something sweet and sticky.

Marcus’s face had gone a strange color. “We need to step off,” he said. “This is bad sign.” He said it like a phrase his grandfather had taught him along with how to hold a compass and how to clean a fish. He cut left, deeper into a tangle of young fir. I followed because going a different way from the only person you came with felt like volunteering to be the lesson the woods wanted to teach.

It got darker in the fir. Sound deadened. Our breath sounded too loud. The air felt warm in a way that wasn’t temperature. It felt like the woods had been warmed once, long ago, and remembered it now.

We broke out of the fir into another clearing.

Smaller than the first. Oval. The grass here was different—shorter, slicker, like hair on skin. The trees around it leaned inward a degree or two, enough to notice if you stood still. The sky above it pressed closer than it should.

In the center, there was a ring of wood. Not a structure, not a fence—just logs laid end to end in a perfect circle, bark peeled, pale wood exposed. Each log’s inner face was etched with the same figure as the tree, as the stones, as the Polaroid. On the outside of the circle, in the grass, were little arrangements of things—bird bones wired together with thin twine, teeth strung like beads, ropes braided of something that looked like fibers and looked like hair.

I didn’t step into the ring. Every part of me that still believed in being untouched by things like fear and consequences refused all at once.

Marcus edged along the perimeter and crouched. The pale wood wasn’t dry. It was damp. It smelled sweet.

“Let’s go,” he said.

We didn’t argue about direction anymore. We went away.

The forest let us.

By the time we reached the campsite, the sun was low and the clearing had that orange glow that makes everything it touches seem like a memory of itself. We didn’t see our tents until we were right at them. They looked… wrong. A little too tall. A little too narrow. The lines weren’t exactly the lines we’d pitched.

The bear bag hung on its limb, fat with food. The knot I’d used to tie it off was a knot I don’t know how to tie.

“Did you—” I started.

“No,” Marcus said.

My Polaroid was on my sleeping pad, face down. I hadn’t left it there. When I turned it over, it was a photo of the clearing, at night, with two figures standing at the edge where the trees begin. They were taller than the trees. They were bent backward in that circle way, arms too long and too slack. Between them, hanging on nothing, was something that might have been a smile.

Our fire pit had been rearranged. Not scattered—rearranged. The stones were stacked into a ring taller than my calf, maybe twenty inches high. There were marks on the inside of each stone—burns, but not from fire. Smudges, like something had exhaled on them until they turned black.

“Pack,” Marcus said. The word sounded like it hurt to push out. “We’re not staying another night.”

We moved fast. I shoved the Polaroid under my shirt because my pack felt too far away from my skin. I didn’t notice right away that the bright strips of orange tape on the perimeter branches were no longer bright. Their color had leeched to a pale, dull peach, like a photo left in the sun.

We should have left then.

We didn’t.

We were slow because there were more things to look at than our hands. We were slow because we didn’t want to turn our backs to the trees. We were slow because the world was the size of a circle and there was more outside it than there had been when we walked in.

By the time we had everything in place, the light had dipped into that last band of day when you can pretend you’re not about to be shut in. The forest’s quiet had grown teeth.

“It’ll be worse in the dark,” I said.

“I know,” Marcus said. He said it like he was agreeing with gravity. He swung his pack up. He didn’t look at me. “Go.”

We went.

We didn’t get very far.

The tape we’d put up wasn’t ours. It still sat on the branches where we’d tied it, but the knots were too tight, the tails too even. On one tree, someone had braided the tape into a little rope. On another, the end had been cut clean, not torn, the edges heat-sealed like plastic cut by wire. And on another, the tape hung in two strips like a pair of lips—one long, one short—and someone had scratched the bent-back figure into the bark between them where a mouth would be.

We walked faster.

The forest walked with us.

When we stopped to breathe, everything else stopped too.

When we started again, we didn’t know we had until a branch cracked somewhere to our left and the crack was answered by a crack to our right the same distance away. Like something pacing us at the distance of a thought.

Full dark fell in a way that felt more like being closed in than losing light.

The breathing came immediately.

Not outside us. Around us. The sound didn’t come from a place; it unrolled like a coil and we were in the center of it. Inhale. Exhale. Slow. Measured. Not the rhythm of an animal moving under its weight and air. The rhythm of something counting.

We kept going because stopping meant choosing a position to die in.

I don’t know how long we walked. My hands hurt from where nail met skin. My breath made small clouds that turned to black faster than they should.

Somewhere in the middle of that, I realized Marcus wasn’t beside me.

I turned.

My headlamp picked out trunks and brush and the white flash of the tape. There wasn’t a sound of me and there wasn’t a sound of Marcus. The breathing went on like we were nothing in it.

“Marcus?” I said, not loud. That word didn’t belong in the breathing.

No answer.

“Marcus,” I tried again.

The breathing stopped.

The forest held absolutely still.

Then something in front of me moved that wasn’t me, wasn’t wind, wasn’t anything I have a word for. The dark rearranged itself. My headlamp found two points of pale that weren’t eyes because there weren’t eyes there, just the places where eyes would be if something had them and closed them, and above those the suggestion of a forehead and above that too much nothing.

I took a step back and my heel hit a root.

Something brushed my sleeve.

Not a hand. Not fur. The memory of a hand.

I ran.

Branches slapped my face and cut my lips. The tape flashed in little funerals of orange that didn’t help. My headlamp caught the white flare of exposed wood where something had rubbed bark away and made it smooth. The woods stopped being a place and became lines of dark I had to not run into.

When the breathing stopped again, I fell.

I don’t remember landing.

I don’t remember getting up.

I remember crawling. Dirt under my nails. The smell of earth and that other smell, the sweet one that makes you think of sugar and heat and then turns in your throat. I remember a shape in front of me that was lighter than everything else and then cool air on my face and the tight, unsteady miracle of stars.

I was at the edge of a road cut into a hillside. A narrow ditch ran along it. The ditch held a trickle of water and the reflection of my headlamp looked like a startled animal. The road’s gravel was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.

I don’t remember how I got back to the truck. The door was open. There was dirt on the seat I don’t remember dragging in. The keys were in my pocket where I don’t remember putting them.

I woke up in my apartment two days later. The sheets were muddy. My mouth tasted like I’d been breathing through metal. My Polaroid camera sat on the kitchen table next to a glass of water I hadn’t poured. The photo of the clearing with the single bent figure lay under the glass like I’d put it there to keep it flat.

Marcus’s pack wasn’t in my living room. His boots weren’t by the door. His jokes weren’t in my head where they should’ve been.

His number was disconnected.

His socials were empty. Not deactivated. Not private. Scrubbed.

The orange tape I’d tied and retied around my wrist that first day sat on the counter, pale as old scars.

And then someone slid something under my door.

It made a soft whispering sound when it came to a stop. I thought it was junk mail until I saw the knot.

It was a strip of pale leather tied around a bundle of hair.

Hair braided the same way Marcus used to braid his sister’s hair at her soccer games when she asked him to “do the rope one.” I recognized the pattern. He’d shown me once, leaning over a picnic table, laughing at how serious I looked while I tried to copy him.

The braid was cut clean at one end. The cut had been heat-sealed.

There were markings burned into the leather. Not letters I knew. Not any runic alphabet my desperate Googling would later suggest. Little figures in a line, each a perfect version of the one before: the bent body, the ring spine, the praised sky, the long thin limbs.

And on the inside of the leather, pressed into it like someone had used a brand smaller than a thumbnail, were five words in English.

YOU WERE MEANT TO WATCH.

They weren’t crooked. They weren’t shaky. They sat straight and clean like something had pressed them one after the other with care.

I stared at the braid so long my vision went white at the edges.

When I blinked and the room came back, the Polaroid camera had moved.

It was closer to me by a few inches. The lens faced my chest. The strap hung off the table like a tongue. I hadn’t touched it.

I picked it up. My thumb found the shutter because that’s what hands do when they don’t know what else to do.

The flash went off in my face. The apartment lit white and then collapsed back into itself.

I put the camera down and waited for the photo to develop.

The square stayed gray longer than it should have. Then an image came up like bruises emerging.

It was the clearing.

Not the way my eyes had ever seen it. The grass was too smooth. The trees leaned in too far. The tents weren’t tents. The ring of stones around the fire pit was taller and the black on the inside of each was wet.

Two figures stood at the edge of the frame.

They were bent backward into rings. They were taller than the trees. Where their faces should have been were the places for faces. And between them, on nothing, a thin smile hung the way a strip of leather hangs when it’s been tied and then slipped.

In the bottom right corner, smaller than my thumbnail, a third figure stood between the first two like a child between adults crossing a street.

Its face was Marcus’s.

I’m not posting this for attention. I don’t care if you believe me.

I’m posting it because sometimes, just before dawn, I hear breathing in my apartment walls. Not mice. Not air through vents. The slow, patient draw of something that likes reminding me it doesn’t have to hurry.

And because the orange tape that I keep finding tied around my cabinet handles and my bedpost is getting paler.

And because I woke up yesterday with resin on my fingers and four parallel grooves scraped into the wood of my kitchen table at the exact height my shoulder is when I stand there.

And because the Polaroid I left face down on the counter last night was on the floor this morning, and when I turned it over, it was blank white except for a thin ring in the center, burned so lightly into the paper that you only see it if you tilt it to the light.

I don’t need sympathy.

I just need someone else to admit the woods aren’t empty.

They breathe.

They wait.

And if you camp in the wrong circle, they smile.
