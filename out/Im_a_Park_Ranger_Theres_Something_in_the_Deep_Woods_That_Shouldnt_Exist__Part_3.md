Sunlight glinted off a sheet of aluminum that accented the ruin in front of me.  I staggered back in shock, raising my hand to my face.  “What the…” I muttered, trying to process the scene.  I looked back to the hollow space behind the wall, where I’d evidently spent the night.  But no amount of time could explain the difference between the hospital I slept in and the long abandoned ruin I was now standing in.   
  
I took a step forward, trying to grasp the reality of the situation. The walls were warped and damp, the air thick with the smell of rot and decay. Struggling to understand, I looked around, desperately trying to reorient myself from where I'd been to the place I now found myself. It was as if a tornado had blown through the place without waking me. I continued onward reluctantly, realizing I was somehow on the ground floor. Nearing the rusted frame where the doors had been in disbelief, I hesitated, turning back for a moment, unsure what I'd find on the other side. But sure enough, I found myself reaching to shield my eyes from the sun that had peeked in through holes in the collapsing upper floors. My truck sat innocently some distance away, tracks leading off into... the woods.  
  
I turned back again, increasingly disoriented. What I was certain had been the same hospital I casually strolled into not long ago, was now an unrecognizable ruin. Years of plant growth and decay devoured a structure that still stretched suspiciously high. I was almost as shocked I had escaped poor Ned's eternal prison as I was this place hadn't collapsed on me, unsure how long I'd been there. I wondered if I dare be grateful that at least there were no humanoid terrors beyond comprehension, or strange shrieking monsters to worry about here. Still, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by it all, clinging just as desperately to the notion that I could still figure all this out and get my life back, so long as I keep moving.  
  
I made a beeline for my truck, determined not to let my reservations trap me in this place a second longer than necessary. Still, I couldn't help but pause when I saw the sign it had obscured. Just beyond, defiant against the natural world determined to reclaim it, was a name I could just make out: "Ravenwood Hospital." A glimmer of hope told me this proved I was not where I thought I was, because until that moment, I could have convinced anyone I was at Mountainview, some fifteen miles from the park. The relief I felt when the engine roared to life was cut short when I realized I was, nevertheless, in the middle of nowhere. I had heard about Ravenwood, an asylum for the criminally insane, but it had closed down decades ago when the park expanded. No matter how exhausted or sick I might have been, there was no way to have driven all the way out here from the visitor's center. Not by accident, and never mind mistaking abandoned ruins for a hospital.  
  
I rolled forward, cautiously following the tire tracks that were my only way out. It was all I could focus on, aside from suppressing the panic that crept up whenever they disappeared and reappeared like dots to connect. For what seemed like hours, I glanced nervously between the windshield and the fuel gauge, driving through and around an obstacle course of rugged terrain crosscut by streams, rocky crags and impassable forest. From what I could remember, Ravenwood shouldn't have been too far from the only road I could have taken this way from the visitor's center. But that assumed I was headed in anything resembling the right direction. By the time I saw the outline of an old ranger station on the horizon, I was running on fumes. I had no choice but to make my way there as soon as possible.  
  
The old cabin looked like it hadn't been used in years. The paint on the wooden exterior was so faded it was nearly gone. The door was hanging off its hinges, and I could see nature's green reaching up from the earth to swallow the structure from all sides. The thought of spending time there was not exactly reassuring, but it was the only shelter for miles, and I had no way to be certain of where I was. Finding Randy and John there when I pulled up had to use just about any luck I had left. They stared in bewilderment as I stepped out, and I did my best to smile and act as though nothing was amiss. If anything Ned told me about Eric was true, I had no way to know who else might be involved.  
  
"Hi there!" I called out, hoping to convince them in spite of myself, "What are you doing all the way out here?"  
  
"I should ask you the same thing," John replied, stepping off a ladder as Randy set down his shovel.  
  
I approached casually, shrugging my shoulders. "You know, the usual. Bob and Eric asked me to take a look at some dead areas we may need to clear and I suppose I got a little turned around."  
  
The three of us approached and I could see confusion and skepticism on their faces. "That's weird," Randy said, "Just last week Eric told all of us you were on sick leave until further notice. Said you were so sick, we shouldn't even try to contact you."  
  
"Yeah," John agreed, "You're back already? He never even mentioned it."  
  
I broke their gaze nervously, caught off guard. If I'd lost an entire week, there was no hope of hiding my condition from my coworkers. "Um, yeah, hehe," I chuckled, "I guess so."  
  
Randy continued, "You don't... look so good. No offense."  
  
"No worries," I sang, trying not to sound desperate, "I suppose this job really takes it out of me. But yeah, I'm back at it. What about you?"  
  
John hesitated, "We hiked out. Been doing some trail maintenance and now we're fixing up this old cabin before the snow this winter makes it impossible."  
  
"Great!" I smiled, "You mind if I lend a hand? I'm afraid I used up all my fuel just finding my way back here. I was looking for the main road and..."  
  
Randy raised an eyebrow. "Jim... the main road is miles from here. Are you sure you're alright?"  
  
I shrugged, still trying to keep it together. "Yeah man, never better. What gives?"  
  
"OK," John interjected, defusing the situation, "Sure Jim, glad to have the help." He handed me an ax. "I was going to start gathering dry timber to restock the firewood, but you can get a head start since you've already been out looking."  
  
"Sure, I'd be happy to," I smiled, reaching out. I wracked my brain trying to think of where to go, what to do next, grateful I'd managed to smooth things over. But I was sorely mistaken. Before I could take it, Randy snatched the ax from John's hand, spun it around and raised it over his head. The realization hit me too late, and I had hardly raised my hand and stepped back before he brought the back of the ax head down on my head. I flinched, but he managed to clip the side of my head, knocking me to the ground.  
  
I groaned and instinctively tried to stand. John shoved Randy back, berating him. "What the hell Randy? Not like this!"  
"Screw you John," Randy shot back, raising the ax again.  
  
John grabbed it and tried to wrestle the murder weapon from his hands. "We don't even know how he ended up here. He wasn't supposed to make it back. What exactly are we gonna tell Eric if you kill him now?"  
  
Randy didn't get a chance to respond. I hurled myself at him, still somewhat dazed, desperate to put up a fight. John yanked the ax free as I crashed into Randy and the two of us tumbled to the ground, cursing and thrashing. I nearly had him pinned, and I thought about how much time I should spend beating on him before making a break for my truck. It was then I felt something hard and heavy make contact with the back of my skull, sending sharp pain and nausea shooting through my body. I collapsed to my side in the fetal position, reaching back to feel warm liquid gushing from the open wound. I gagged as the world spun into darkness.  
  
When I came to, I couldn't move.  My head was killing me, and not just because of the gash still oozing blood from the back of my head.  I stifled my gut reflex, not wanting my nausea to draw attention.  The cold draft blew in through gaps in the walls of the cabin, pricking my senses. I was lying on the floor in the corner, my hands and feet zip-tied.  
  
Despite the disoriented state I was in, I could feel my heart rate quicken as I tried to focus on my surroundings. I could hear the wind howling, and the distant sound of water rushing over rocks from nearby streams.  My captors were still bickering over what to do with me.   
  
“We can’t just leave him out here,” John groaned, exasperated, “Eric was adamant he has been chosen.”  
  
“Then what’s he doing here?” Randy asked wryly, “You don’t honestly believe that crap your boss drones on about, do you?  What part of ‘the cosmic madness of true knowledge’ is so compelling?  If Eric wants him gone so bad, let’s just dump him.  It’ll be our secret.  Nobody else needs to know.”  
  
“No,” John insisted, “This is the second time Jim’s made it back somehow.  He’ll want to handle this personally, like he did with his old boss.”  
  
Randy sighed, “Whatever. The guy’s a nutcase, and for all I know, your friend Jim is too. This isn’t what I signed up for when my parole officer told me this place paid cash for day work.  Now you’ve got me in the middle of nowhere on a three day hike, talking about some ritual.  I’m not going back to prison for whatever you and the rest have going on.  Even if I wanted to get him back to Eric, I’m sure as hell not dragging him there on foot.”  
  
“Relax,” John said, “You’ll get your money.  I got ahold of Eric on the satphone.  If he can convince the crew to fly him out here by helicopter, it won’t be long at all.”  
  
My blood ran cold.  It didn’t sound like I had much time to get out of there, somehow.  But if I moved a muscle, I’d immediately give myself away.  To make matters worse, I was fighting a losing battle with my bladder.  I had one move, and I made it.  
  
“Hey you,” I spat, trying to make the gravel in my voice sound determined, “The hell is your problem?”  
John stood up, surprised, “Well look at that Randy. You managed not to kill him….  Yet.”  
  
Randy scoffed, “Whatever man, you’re the one who put him down.  What do we do now?”  
  
“Let me go,” I answered, “Unless you want me to piss all over your floor.  Just let me outside for a bit.  I bet you boys like to watch anyway.”  The three of us argued for a minute, before John marched over, exasperated, and yanked through the zip ties around my wrists with his pocket knife.     
  
“There,” he grinned, “hop on out.  We’ll give you some privacy.  You’ve got sixty seconds.”  
  
I rolled my eyes, struggling to my feet. “Fine,” I groaned.    
As I hobbled toward the door, Randy opened it for me, bowing sarcastically and motioning with his hand.  “Enjoy,” he giggled.    
I had half a mind to stomp on his toes as I hopped past, but he kicked my bound feet out from under me, and I went sprawling helplessly into the dirt outside.  The pair roared with laughter as I cussed and spat, rolling around.  So much for my escape plan.  I sheepishly made my way to the far corner of the cabin where I could lean for balance.  My momentary relief was nearly interrupted by a distant chopping sound coming over the horizon.  Time was not on my side.  
  
Bracing hard against the walls, I leapt into the air and threw my legs against a sharp edge along the corner, aiming for the gap where my plastic restraints bound them together.  One by one, the zip ties snapped, but not before I gave myself a few bruises.  Still, before long, I was free.  
  
“What’s all that racket Jim? I said sixty seconds,” John called after me, stepping outside.    
  
It was now or never.  Quickly gathering my strength, I ran around the side of the cabin at full tilt, determined to make it to my truck.  I could hear John and Randy shouting as they ran after me, their voices diverging as one of them no doubt tried to beat me there from the other side.  I rounded the corner to the back where I’d parked.  My head was still pounding, and all the commotion had got my blood pumping.  I could feel wet, warm ooze making its way down my neck and back.  But I couldn’t let it slow me down.  
  
I could just make out the wide-eyed rage on John’s face as he rounded the corner opposite me, and we both made a beeline for my truck.  I was close enough to be confident I would reach it before my pursuer, and a spark of hope picked up my speed.  But my hopes were dashed by the blur of grass and dirt.  I tripped and went sprawling out on the ground, hard.  I tried to jump up, but a sharp pain shot up my leg from my ankle, and sent me right back down.  
  
By then, John caught up with me, huffing and puffing.  I still struggled to stand, right up until his boot came crashing into my teeth.  I lurched backward involuntarily, the taste of metallic nausea mixing with the sharp pain flooding my shocked senses.  Landing flat on my back, I could do little more than raise my hands to shield myself as he loomed over me.  
  
“You slippery son of a bitch,” John shook his head, still panting, “No more bathroom breaks for you.”   
 His words were nearly drowned out by the roar of the helicopter approaching the cabin from the other side.  I couldn’t see anything from where I was lying on the ground, but I knew Eric had arrived.  
“You’re lucky I can’t be sure you’d survive another blow to the head,” John seethed menacingly.  I cried out and tried to turn and crawl away as he landed a few solid blows, stomping down on my twisted ankle.  “Stay down, and this will all go much easier,” he said, kicking me in the ribs.  I gasped, my breath cut short with each thud.    
  
“This is it,” I thought.  I lay there helpless, anticipating the final blow.  But it never came.  
  
“Randy!” John bellowed, “Tell Eric I’ve got his buddy here around back.”  
  
As pathetic as it sounds, I almost felt relieved to see my old friend appear after some time from the other side of the cabin, the whirring blades of the helicopter rising and fading as quickly as they’d come.  He broke into a trot, calling out, “Jim?  What did you guys do to him, John?  Jim, are you alright?”   
  
I lay there on the ground, silent as he approached.   “Nothing that didn’t need doing,” John replied, “Unless you’d rather he ruin your plans for a third time.”  
  
“You fool!” Eric raged, “The sacrifice must remain unblemished if it is to be accepted!”  
  
“Wasn’t much of anything unblemished about him when he got here,” John insisted, “I don’t know how, but you sure are lucky Randy and I were here when he did.”  
  
“Do you forget what it is we’re trying to accomplish here? How’s your daughter’s chemo therapy going, John?  Didn’t you say she’s getting worse?  That you’d do anything?”  Eric stared daggers as I watched all the fight leave John’s eyes. “If you’re going to kill him here, you might as well start planning two funerals,” Eric continued. “Now, help me get him on a sled.  I brought Sarah and Ron.  I’ll haul Jim out there myself, and this time, you’re all coming with me.  If you’re lucky, I’ll let you do the honors when the time comes.”  
  
“Now?”  John protested, “It’s nearly dark, and it looks like you brought the snow with you.  Wherever you’re going, you won’t get there through these woods.”  
  
Eric chuckled, “Where we’re going, it is as the prophets said: ‘Night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.’”  
“Right,” John hesitated, “I’ll…. go get Randy.”  
  
Eric offered some food and water, crudely stitching the gash on my head, while the others gathered for what looked to be a considerable undertaking.  Whatever happened next, I was too injured to move much on my own, never mind escape.  The snow was coming down in earnest by the time I was wrapped and tied to a sled, like a dying member of some expedition into the wilderness.   
  
John wasn’t the only one having second thoughts.  Randy refused to go.  “I don’t know what your problem is with Jim, and I don’t want to know,” he said flatly, “I don’t care if I have to walk out of here myself, I’m not going with you, and I’m not going back to prison for whatever this is.”  He stood, defiant, arms crossed.  
  
“Suit yourself,” our deranged leader replied, “You can pick up your check from the office.”  
  
Randy rolled his eyes, turning to head back to the cabin from where we’d gathered.  The wind began to pick up, moaning through the trees and filling the air with just enough fresh powder to give his exit a dramatic flare.  Not a moment later, Eric turned, reached in his pack, and pulled out a pistol.  Before anyone could say a word, he fired.  Three shots exploded through Randy’s back, and he dropped like a rock into the red snow.  The others stood in shock, as motionless as I was, while Eric calmly stowed the murder weapon.  
  
“Any other questions or concerns?” he called out to the wind, “Good.”  
  
John, Sarah and Ron quietly picked up the gear and followed a man who may easily have become their killer into the woods as he lugged me behind with a rope.  No matter how long I stared at them, I couldn’t figure out why they wouldn’t jump him all at once, or at least make a break for it.  What on Earth could he hold over them?  Surely they didn’t hate me enough to risk their lives butchering me in some psychotic charade.  Before long, Eric’s voice interrupted my thoughts.  
  
“So Jim,” he huffed, his words only somewhat audible over the grinding of my makeshift prison over the lightly covered forest floor, “I understand you went to the wrong hospital.  I told you, you should have taken my offer.”  he laughed, as if expecting a response.  I didn’t.  He continued, “You know, old friend, that’s a very special place. I wasn’t even certain it existed until they told me about what happened to you.  But places like that only attract people like that, so you can believe me when I tell you what happened wasn’t my plan.  Not at first, anyway.  It’s thinner there, the veil between this life and the oblivion we all yearn for, and yearns for us.  Places of death and suffering long forgotten.  Some people, maybe people like us… the broken, the anguished, the despaired… they can cross it sometimes.  After all, blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth.”  
  
“Was Ned one of these meek souls of yours?” I interrupted, struggling to speak against the pain that cut through every breath, “Is that why you trapped him in that place?”  
  
Eric stopped in his tracks for a moment and glanced back at me.  “Ah, so the bastard is still there,” he cackled even harder.  “You know what?  I’m glad you two had a chance to catch up.  You really are meant for this.”  
  
“For what?” I asked, weakly.  
  
“For what billions of people today and throughout history have sought after religiously,” he answered, “Reunion with the divine in every sense… the sublime oblivion of absolute enlightenment… the formless void of infinity beyond the natural world, where mere existence breaks the mind under the cosmic weight of truth.”   
  
I probably should have anticipated it by now, but I immediately regretted asking.  It went on like that for some time, and I tuned most of it out in silence.  I heard enough to know Ned was right.  I was to be offered up like fresh meat to the nightmare I fought so hard to get away from, slowing its relentless, inevitable devouring of the world as we know it.  Somehow this was supposed to confer a reprieve from its effects upon those willing to present someone else in their place.  At least, that was Eric’s version of the story I gleaned from all the gibberish.  
  
It was pitch black out, and everyone had the maglites on, determined to get wherever they were taking me.  I’d assumed we would make camp at some point, but it never came.  By the time I saw the first rays of a strange glow piercing through the trees, I assumed morning had come.  I told myself the intense quiet was just an adjustment to the howling wind and snow that had ceased.  But the uncanny weight of dread in my gut was matched only by the growing familiarity of the otherworldly landscape that unfolded around me.    
  
For the first time, I fought as hard as I could, though helplessly, against my restraints.  I groaned and struggled through the pain radiating through my body.  The intensity of my headache was reaching a fever pitch, and I knew all too well what it meant.  My efforts barely interrupted my captor’s monologues.  Desperation became full blown panic when the faded belongings of my ill-fated predecessors came into view, scattered about.  They paraded past my trapped gaze on all sides, a grim prelude to my fate.  Shattered ribs intermingled my screams with choking, coughing and sputtering as I involuntarily fought for air… for release… for freedom.  
  
The group came to a halt, and when I saw why, I nearly soiled myself.  There it was - the tree that psychopath thought so highly of, the one I knew first hand was no tree at all.  It was even more massive than I remembered it, and I squeezed my eyes shut tightly, trying anything to avoid seeing the monstrosity in detail a second time.  The discordant moans of countless voices trapped in eternal agony grew to a crescendo, as if in anticipation.  Eric looked gleeful in a manic sort of way.  He grinned, wide-eyed with shaky hands that now struggled to untie me.  Even then, it seemed he never tired of hearing himself talk, almost shouting over the hellish chorus.  
  
“What would you trade for knowledge, Jim?  Prometheus stole it from the gods. Odin plucked out his own eye for it.  Adam forfeited his very soul.  As for me, well, I would burn the whole world, and more. Some called it Odin’s Tree, others, the Tree of Life….  Nirvana…. Can’t you feel it? It hungers for those whose souls are prepared.  Even a god hung himself here for a chance at what I am giving you. And yet, you try to flee. But not this time. I will fulfill my oath once more, and claim what is rightfully mine!”  
I couldn’t hear much of what he said after that, and I couldn’t have understood much, even if I did.  I was nearly paralyzed by the pounding in my head.  I struggled with everything left in me just to avoid passing out.  At some point, Eric must’ve untied me, because I found myself rolling around on the strange ground.  I remember the slimy sensation of the disgusting mucus oozing from the “tree” in places, fluorescent, pulsating mold of some kind in others.  The voices had become so loud, so intense and all-encompassing.  Their increasingly high pitched, inhuman wail that reverberated through everything around could only be the same formless threat I had narrowly escaped, the first time I encountered it in this place.    
  
The sound resonated in a hum that seemed to come from everywhere.  I frantically tried to roll, to crawl, to writhe and flail away from that place at any cost.  Through the blur of tears and with hands clasped tightly over my ears, I caught glimpses of the carnage.  One moment, I saw John smiling, no, giggling uncontrollably as he pranced around naked and covered in blood.  He sashayed to and fro, dancing with his own intestines he’d wrapped around himself like a string of blood-red pearls.  The next, Ron and Sarah came into view, each half butchered and frollicking to a beat of their own.  Their faces appeared ecstatic to see the pack of beasts emerging from the woods around us, even after it set upon them and began tearing all three to shreds.  Humanoid yet canine in shape, their thick black fur was soon spattered with generous helpings of blood and viscera dripping from razor-sharp teeth that gleamed in the dim light..   
  
Amidst the chaos, Eric stood alone just out of reach; the same wild eyed, psychotic grin on his face, as if the mass murder unfolding around us was the most wonderful surprise anyone could receive.  My hands fell from my ears as I lay on the ground.  I could feel the last vestiges of strength and will leaving my body as the familiar hum of a pulsating alien world washed away the steady drumbeat of agony in my skull.  In that moment, I almost surrendered to the dreamy abyss trying to close my eyes forever.  I stared at the man who had caused all this, who ruined my life and murdered so many people for some unhinged quest.  He had been my friend.  I trusted him, perhaps even more than the victims whose remains now littered the ground.  I couldn’t just let go, not until I had my revenge.  
Slowly, methodically, I raised myself up, one limb at a time.  Eric was oblivious, lost in the ecstasy of the massacre he orchestrated.  With each movement, I willed myself through the searing pain.  Finally, I turned to face him, preparing my body for one last act.  Mustering every ounce of rage and despair I had, I let out a defiant cry, lunging at him just when he was half turned to face me.  The two of us crashed into the broad, slime-covered, fleshy base of the tree.  It was my would-be killer’s turn to scream and struggle, but his body was immobilized, like vermin in a glue trap.  Despite sinking in further myself, I clasped my hands around his throat and squeezed as hard as I could.  
  
This was it.  I had no hope of escape, but neither did my tormentors.  A head-spinning mix of terror and triumph flooded my final moments, though I can’t remember if I’d managed to kill Eric with my own hands before I passed out for good.  When I awoke on the forest floor, I assumed I was dead, that I’d finally crossed over into the formless void that had been my nightmare in life.  However, I began to have my doubts when I effortlessly rose to my feet.    
  
As far as I could tell, my injuries had vanished without a trace, along with Eric and the rest.  Were it not for the gear laying around nearby, I might’ve doubted my sanity and whether any of it really happened.  There was no indication of the events that haunted my last memories, and I found his pistol in the bag where he’d stashed it, along with the satphone.  It didn’t take long for me to reach someone at headquarters, though we spent more time trying to figure out where I was to send help before the battery ran low.  In the weeks that followed, I was subjected to a criminal investigation into the disappearance of the people who tried to kill me.  The authorities were determined, and  I’m not sure I wouldn’t have been charged had they been able to find Randy’s body.  Weeks of manhunts with crews scouring the park turned up no sign of him or anyone else, and the case eventually went cold for lack of evidence.  
  
I wish I could say my story ends there - that I defeated the evil and saved the world through grit, luck and sheer commitment to my mission.  But that would be a lie.  My miraculous recovery feels more profound than even my previous narrow escapes.  It’s not just my wounds that disappeared.  The aches and pains… the wrinkles… the weakness and exhaustion, all gone.  Constant headaches were replaced with vivid nightmares of the tree that isn’t a tree, and strange voices murmuring in a language I can’t quite understand.  I feel more alive than ever, but at a cost.  I can feel its pull through my dreams, its rhythm beckoning like a heartbeat.  Eric was a bastard, but I think I know what I have to do.  I guess that’s why I’ve shared all this, so if you ever find yourself in my position, you will too.
