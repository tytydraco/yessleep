Sorry for not updating sooner, it's kind of a long story - I've been dealing with insomnia, so my therapist got me in touch with a psychiatrist (who naturally recommended medication) and adjusting to my prescription sleeping pills hasn't been fun, to say the least. It's hard to write about the most traumatic week of your life when you're running on fumes. That, and I've been reading some of you guys' stories. It's nice to not feel so alone.

A couple people even asked if they could "narrate" my story "on YouTube"? I don't understand why they'd want to, but I'm flattered my terrifying experiences have struck a chord with some of you. I still have plenty more to tell you about, though.

But anyway, you don't need to hear my excuses, or listen to me ramble. You're here because you want to know what happened next -

As it turned out, being away from that room was all it took for me to regain control of my body. But being forced to keep your mouth shut for a good long while has a way of leaving you alone with your thoughts.

I remember thinking this must be what it felt like to be a rat in a maze, never knowing if you'd reach the exit. Subjected to test after test by some uncaring scientist who got to decide how much pain you endured before you died. Spending so much of your life in captivity you started to forget what freedom was. Except lab rats were often rewarded with cheese, and I highly doubted there was any kind of "reward" to be gained from this nightmare.

The thought of food made my stomach growl but I pretended not to notice. I had a habit of doing that with thoughts I decided weren't useful. The thing is, when you shove those thoughts to the back of your mind, they start to pile up. And one day, there won't be any more space for the next one that pops into your head. Something has to give.

I pondered this, stuck between stony silence and the fever pitch of fear. Somewhere between that room and this corner of the labyrinth, I'd started to dissociate. The only thing that could snap me out of it was-

"JAMIE."

I looked up to see Kat standing over me, expression unreadable. Arnold must've put me down when we found somewhere safe. Well, safer than the break room. Her hand was outstretched. It took me a moment to realize she was offering it to me. "Can you stand?"

I nodded, not trusting my voice to work after all this time. She helped me to my feet. Some part of me couldn't shake the feeling that I didn't deserve it.

"Where... are we?"

No sooner had I asked the question than did another plaque come into view, this one with the words "FRESH PRODUCE" engraved on it. I muttered the name under my breath, confused. Is that seriously what it was called? Like something out of an old western?

Little did I know how accurate the name would turn out to be.

Come to think of it, there was something important I needed to remember about names... Oh shit, I'd almost forgotten-

"Does anyone have a pen?" I asked. "I saw something back there, some symbols. I think they might be able to help us if we can figure out what they mean."

Vivian fished through her purse for a few moments before uttering a quiet "aha!" She handed me the most expensive looking pen I'd ever seen, beaming triumphantly. Unfortunately we had no paper, so I had to get a little creative. I thanked her awkwardly, avoiding her gaze as I scribbled the symbols in my head onto my forearm. The pen was nearly out of ink so it was less like writing them down and more like carving them into my flesh, which turned red and sore in protest. Once I was satisfied, I returned the pen to Vivian. The expression on her face was pretty much what I'd expected - she looked at me like I was a sewer rat who'd just broken out into a tap dance routine.

"Thanks," she said dryly.

Kat was uncharacteristically quiet. She stared at the disorganized gaggle of shopping carts, biting the nail of her thumb.

When Arnold broke the silence, his voice was so soft we almost didn't hear it. "Have you ever heard of Dante's *Inferno*?" He asked in his gentle timbre.  "You mean the guy who wrote about walking through hell with his favorite poet? Didn't he get exiled by the pope or something?"

Arnold nodded at me thoughtfully. "Something like that. I was just thinking something about all this feels familiar."

"He has a point," Vivian conceded. "I mean, what would you call a place like this if not 'Hell' ?"

'The supermarket' I opened my mouth to say, but bit back the words when Kat shot me a look. Instead, I decided to approach the conversation a little more constructively. "I dunno, it feels closer to Night at the Museum to me. Maybe this is what happens every night after Kat and her coworkers close up. Maybe they're all in on it and planning to sacrifice us to the Gods of Fresh Produce for not being better customers." She rolled her eyes, but I got a glimpse of the wry smile she was trying to hide. I didn't exactly miss high school, but being back in the roll of the class clown wasn't so bad sometimes.

Still, I gave the nearest abandoned shopping cart a dubious glance. It didn't seem to be trying to come to life, but who's to say it wasn't? "Don't get any ideas," I whispered to it.

The others patrolled the rows of fruit and vegetables that had clearly been freeze dried at some point ("fresh produce" my ass) while I turned my attention to the shelves. I expected to see chips, cereal, maybe a package of granola bars, but I didn't recognize the brands of any of the products, let alone their contents.

I picked up a can of something that resembled beans, hoping to get a better look at it. "December 1994" the label said.

Huh?

I rubbed my eyes, convinced I must be seeing things. I shook the can and, instead of hollow clanking, heard  an ethereal tinkling sound. It sounded like the chime of bells attached to a sleigh, full of promise and joy. For a split second I swear I could smell the scent of pine carried on a cold winter breeze. It smelled like love. It smelled like home.

Startled, I dropped the can, barely managing to catch it before it could hit the ground and rolled away.

The aisle seemed... *longer* somehow. Like someone had stretched it out. I'm not sure how else to describe it. It reminded me of taffy.

"Day Trip to Maple Drip," read one box.

"Vacation at the Beach," read another.

Still another, "Graduation Day!"

I reached for one with a label that said "Grandma's Homemade Cookies." It had a picture of my grandmother on it, dressed just like every other sweet old lady brand mascot out there, but her face looked exactly how I remembered her. I missed her warmth, her smiles, and of course her famous chocolate chip cookies. How many years had it been since she died now?

Memories have a way of making your head go fuzzy. The nostalgia factor, I think some people call it. But deep down I knew that's not all this was. I'd like to say that's the main reason it didn't occur to me that this might be another trap. The only thing that stopped me from ripping open the cardboard right then and there was the sound of my stomach growling. It pierced the silence, shattering the illusion I'd been sucked into. All the shame rushed back into my cheeks and I slammed the box back down where I found it.

I glanced around, hoping the others hadn't noticed. Arnold gave me a sympathetic look.

Kat had been drawn in by the shelves' odd contents, too. "I stocked this place myself and there sure as hell weren't any wine bottles labeled 'Dog Park Race 2009' when I took inventory."

It took me longer than I'd like to admit to realize what was going on, but when she said that, something clicked in my mind - "Put it back," I said.

"Why?" She sounded a little annoyed, but mainly nonplussed. As if I had asked her to hold her breath until she passed out. My stomach turned as I watched her fingers slowly tighten around the neck of the bottle in her hands. They kept gripping it, like a drowning man clutching at a life raft, until her knuckles turned white. There was something vacant in her eyes, too. She looked... lost. Not asleep, but not quite awake.

I carefully stepped towards her, trying my hardest not to make any sudden movements. I had one shot at getting that bottle away from her, and I wasn't gonna waste it.

"Kat, you said it yourself - something's off. Can't you feel it?"

"Did I...?" She sounded like she was somewhere far away, somewhere I couldn't reach.

I took a step closer. "Yeah, you did. It's okay if you don't remember, just- just let me take that. This stuff doesn't belong to us. We should leave it alone, okay?"

She nodded along, not paying attention to a word I was saying. I was too busy focusing on prying her hands off the bottle to be offended by it. As soon as it was out of her grip, her eyes clouded with confusion, then fear.

"Don't touch anything on the shelves," she snapped to the others, the harshness of her voice undermined by the way it trembled. Arnold looked up, confused but not about to argue with the strange request, and Vivian put down a bottle of nail polish with more force than necessary. "We're leaving. Now."

As if in response to those words, or maybe sensing the intent behind them, the air around us grew colder. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. This cold was familiar, it had the same frosty bite as the air in the break room. Hopelessness began to chip away at my bones. I wondered if the cold itself was a sentient force, a predator that had finally cornered its prey. 

And I knew, without any possible way of knowing, that one swig from the bottle in my hands would be more than enough to warm me up. 

It didn't belong to me- wasn't *for* me. I felt on a deeper, instinctual level that it had bonded itself to Kat somehow when she first touched it - the label hadn't changed even after I pried it out of her hands. But something told me it wasn't *for* her, either. It, like everything else on these shelves, belonged to this place. Maybe we could pick things up and take them with us, but even a kid would know that at the supermarket, you had to pay for what you wanted to take home. Maybe it was just the chill settling into my spine, but something told me that if I took the bottle, I would be expected to pay for it, and not with money.

Still, I found myself unable to let go of the bottle. It was like it had been super-glued to my hand, I swear I'm not exaggerating. I wanted to let go of it, but I couldn't. Every time I tried it felt unnatural. Wrong. Dangerous, even. I tried to look away, but my eyes kept drifting back to its delicately wrapped opening. The substance inside rolled around inside the glass at the slightest movement, occasionally catching the light. It looked like liquid sunshine in the late afternoon, a strong, sweet molasses brown. Wouldn't it be so easy to just peel off the wrapper and let the warmth inside fill me up? If I didn't do it now, how did I know for sure I'd feel happy again?

"Jamie," Kat said, fixing me with a stare of sheer unadulterated disapproval I previously believed only calculus teachers were capable of, "Put. It. Back." 

"I know, I know, just- just let me hold it for a little bit longer. A little longer, okay? And then I'll put it back." 

Fear flickered in her eyes. She glanced down at the bottle I held and weighed the chances of being able to take it from me without falling under the same spell. In the end, she reached for it anyway. 

"Give me that-"

"*No-*"

"Then I'm sorry about this." We wrestled for a moment before a sharp pain shot through my groin. I buckled to my knees, gasping and blinking the tears from my eyes. That was all the time Kat needed to wrench the bottle away from me. This time, she made sure to wrap her uniform's apron around it, not letting the glass come into contact with her skin. She placed it back on the shelf where she'd found it, careful not to drop or damage it in the process. Only then did she breathe a sigh of relief.

"Did you just kick me in the balls?" I wheezed, pulling myself to stand on shaky legs. 

Kat went to give a clever retort, wearing her best attempt at a shit-eating grin given the circumstances, when I felt a tingle up my spine. This time, it wasn't from the cold. No, this time I felt the hot breath of something lurking in the shadows ghost over my neck, sending a ripple of goosebumps across my skin. 

Three things happened at once: I saw the side of Casey's letterman jacket as he rounded the corner. A large clawed hand reached for me from the darkness. And Vivian lunged for the bottle. 

I heard Casey shouting my name as I was lifted off the ground, about to become a monster's next meal, and watched in a mix of awe and admiration as Vivian chucked the bottle at its head. It shattered with a 'pop' in an explosion of cold wetness. 

I cried out as shards of broken glass cut into the meat of my hands and face, but managed to keep my head long enough to tumble to the ground as the creature loosened its grip. Arnold rushed over to help me up.

It took several long moments to get my bearings but when I did, I felt my heart jump into my throat: there was a neon "EXIT" sign two thirds of the way up the far wall, sitting just above a pair of sliding glass doors. Even from tens of yards away, I could see snow falling outside, landing on the frozen pavement.

Kat yelled at us to run, and we needed no encouragement - we booked it, bolting for the doors with the monster hot on our heels. A flash of curly hair caught my eye. The sight of Frankie, sweating bullets but clean and unharmed as we sprinted towards the exit, sent a surge of relief through me. 

We were going to make it. We were going to get out of this place *alive*. 

Kat was the first to make it outside, but only because Arnold had stopped to sweep Vivian up in a bridal carry, running towards freedom with the disgruntled businesswoman in his arms. I was honestly impressed - he carried her like she weighed nothing at all. The two were right behind Casey, leaving Frankie and me at the flank. 

But before we could cross the threshold of the supermarket and flee into the night, a large clawed hand came forth from the shadows and wrapped itself around her waist. I grabbed for Frankie's hand, but even then I knew it wouldn't be enough. Sweat glimmered on her skin, illuminated by the street lamps. I couldn't hold onto her; she was too slippery. 

Frankie gripped my arm with supernatural strength, her eyes wide and frantic, pleading with me. She was mouthing something, I realized. No - trying to tell me something. The ringing in my ears made it too loud to hear, but I could tell this wasn't an open-mouthed scream, she was repeating the same shape with her lips over and over again: *"Go!"*

When she let go, I lost my balance, tumbling into a patch of snow. I watched as that thing pulled my friend back into the belly of that hellhole, unable to do a single thing to stop it.

Hands were on my back. Arnold and Kat helped me into a sitting position, discussing something in hushed tones that I really didn't care about enough to pay attention to. Vivian slumped against a parking stop, breathing raggedly. This time, what surged through me was panic. I doubled over onto my hands and knees and vomited in the direction of a nearby bush. My guts emptied themselves enthusiastically, leaving me lightheaded and choking on my own bile. Arnold offered me a crumpled up sheet of print-out coupons to wipe my mouth on. I accepted it with as much gratitude as I could muster. 

The lights inside the supermarket hummed to life, revealing a normal store inside. It looked exactly the way it was when we'd first walked in. There were no signs of life or even death, no blood streaked across the walls, and no Frankie. 

I exchanged bewildered glances with the others and could tell we all had the same thing on our minds: we were out- we were free- but there were still people trapped inside. 

I don't know how long it took me to gather the strength to speak again. It had to have been a matter of minutes, but it felt like years. 

"We have to go back."
