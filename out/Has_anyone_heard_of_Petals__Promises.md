Hey, I don’t even know if this is the wisest place for me to be looking for any kind of solution given that Reddit was the start of this whole thing. But, I don’t know what to do.


This whole disaster started a few days ago when I decided to answer a post on one of the subs for psychology majors that looked to be a call for people to participate in a short, four-question survey about choices that concern morality. 


A subreddit that I am only in — by the way — because not too long ago, I was a psychology major, I had designed a research survey to assist my dissertation and I used this exact sub to recruit participants for my survey. I was blown away that I got all of the participants I needed and by more from just the one post. 


I gained a little faith in humanity, that day. I thought it was a really good thing, people giving up their time for free to help some student with their studies.


Since then, if I have the time and the survey seems easy or interesting, I’ll fill it out just the same to help someone else finish their dissertation.



I don’t want to bore you so I’ll explain how I know that this survey wasn’t what it said it was. Someone for sure reviewed it, and they’re taking action without a doubt, but it is *not* what it said it was. 


The second question on the survey was phrased like this:

*“If you would incur consequences from pulling over to help someone on the side of the road who clearly needed help — such as being late to work, denied admission to an event, missing an appointment etc. — would you pull over?”*


All four of the questions required a simple yes or no answer. 


To this one, I ticked **‘yes’** and I honestly meant it, in *most* circumstances, I would. 


But, I didn’t.


This morning, two days after the survey I was on my way to work. I usually leave at about 6:20am but I awoke to a flat tyre which is no surprise given the age of my car but I did not have time for it. It took me 15 minutes to change the tyre, luckily I had a spare, but that was 15 minutes closer I now was to being late to work. Again. I can’t be late again. 


Everything was going just as it does every other day, until it wasn’t. 


I was about three quarters of the way there and if everything else went smoothly, I would be there just about on time. 


Which is why, when I saw a man standing to the side of the road on the highway with the word **‘help’** inked on some cardboard. 


I didn’t stop. 


I’m ashamed to say it. I justified it to myself in a few ways; his car looked fine, he hadn’t been hit or hit anything, he wasn’t bleeding or visibly injured. It was just getting light out so someone else would help him, wouldn’t they? For all I know, he could be some psycho-murderer. Or a scammer? No?


The long and short of it being, I had managed to perform enough mental gymnastics to convince myself that this man didn’t need *my* help, his sign didn’t mean *me*.  


Only, it *did* mean me. 
It meant *specifically* me.


As was approaching, I looked at the sign three or four times, it said **‘HELP’**, it only said **’HELP’**.


As I passed the man, he and I made eye contact for a second and my stomach dropped a little bit, but I had made a decision and I had to stick to it. I glanced in my mirror to look behind me, to see if he was flipping me off, but he wasn’t. 


He was just still standing there, but his sign now read **‘YOU SAID YOU WOULD HELP’.**


Now nauseous, I had one of those moments that I’ve seen characters have on TV before. One of those moments where all of the pieces come together and the whole world spins as piece after piece flashes before your eyes to form a horrifying picture. 


I *did* say I would help, *didn’t I.* 


One of those horrific puzzle pieces was from the day before, it was an interaction that lasted a maximum of ninety seconds and I hadn’t thought about it since. But, in hindsight, it was my first ‘test’. 


The first question on the survey read:
*“If you were to come across something valuable that doesn’t belong to you, would you seek out its owner in attempt to return it?’*


I chose **‘yes’** for this one, too. 
Thankfully, I stayed true to my word when the test came. 


Yesterday, the day before the man-on-the-highway incident, I was on my lunch break at work and sometimes I like to go a few doors down to this little coffee shop with a ‘buy a coffee, get a croissant for a dollar’ offer, I’m sure you understand the appeal.


After I’d finished my croissant, I was just wasting time with my coffee when I noticed the woman who had been sitting a few tables over had gotten up to leave and left her entire handbag on the table. 


“Excuse me, miss!” I said, “You’ve forgotten your bag!” I said.


She whipped her head round and gave a theatrical head shake paired with an exaggerated point to her brain, “Oh thank you so much!”.


“I run a little florist at the end of this road, if you’re ever in need of flowers, you let me know and I will take good care of you and your wallet” she gushed as she rummaged through her bag before producing a business card that she carefully wrapped a $20 bill around before continuing, “I never forget a face!”


Grabbing one of my hands and firmly placing the bill and the card in my palm before grabbing my whole hand in hers, clasping my fingers around her offerings. 


“Here, a twenty for your troubles and a card for if I can ever help with flowers! Remember, I’ll take good care of you!”
Accenting her sentence with a double tap from her finger on my closed hand, she nodded sincerely before turning on her heel and practically skipping out of the coffee shop. 


I smiled, put the twenty dollars in my wallet and shoved the business card in my jacket pocket.


I hadn’t thought about the card until this morning, after I saw what the highway-man’s sign read.


So my whole day at work following the man-on-the-highway was half spent thinking about every second of both of these interactions and half spent scolding myself about having left my jacket — and therefore the business card, at home. In my rush to get to work on time after the tyre, I left as soon as I could before I could think about my jacket. 

I needed the business card. 


As soon as I could leave work, I did. I don’t want to include loads of irrelevant information but it is important to know that my phone was blowing up while I was driving home but I don’t have hands free and l didn’t need the distraction.


When I got to my driveway and got out of the car, I briefly checked my phone to see that it was the group chat I have with my brother and a couple of friends that was blowing up and a quick skim of the notifications told me that nothing of importance was going on. I could focus.


I got in the house and went straight for the business card. I googled every word on there — front and back,  in every order you can fathom. Nothing.


This is the information that was on the card:


Front side - *‘Petals & Promises’* in a large, curly front with the tagline *‘Helping you keep your promises since 1993’* in smaller, bold words.


Back side - *‘Your promise is our passion’* in the same font as the tagline followed by an address, a website and some social media handles. 


All of which were fake. When I looked at the address I saw that it was very local, which made sense given what the florist lady had said - *“I run a little florist at the end of the street”*, but when I googled the address, it wasn’t a florist at all. It was the address of the coffee shop I had met her in.

Google said there was no florist on that street, that there was no florist for over four miles. 


The social media handles all didn’t exist, they weren’t profiles or pages that had been deleted or made private — they simply did not exist. 


The website immediately redirects to a google document which was protected by a password. 


As soon as the page loaded that revealed the need for a password, my phone rang again, it was my brother, I answered. 


“Hi, dude. What’s up I’m just a little busy-“, he cut me off, which is unlike him. I heard him out.
“No, I just need to talk. I need you to cover for me if Katie calls. She probably won’t, but if she does, can you just tell her I’m with you?” 


My mouth hung open and practically hit the floor like a cartoon character, the third question on the survey flashed before my eyes as he continued speaking, I didn’t hear a word. 


The third question on the survey was: *“If someone close to you were to be partaking in illegal or immoral activities, would you help them take action to prevent their misdeeds being brought to light?”*


I answered **‘no’**.


I tried to tune my brain into my brother’s frequency but the static was too strong. I only heard one off words every now and then like *‘Charlotte’* and *‘college’,* which might not mean much to you, but I filled out all of the rest of his sentence with just these two words. 


He was reminding me of one of my most degenerate moments. In college where I cheated on the woman who would come to be my wife, later to become my ex-wife. He was reminding me of his testimony to my whereabouts that acted the key that locked that chapter permanently shut. I know, I hate me too.


Knowing my brother, he didn’t bring this up as a threat, but to remind me that he was there for me during my worst decision. There wouldn’t be too much point in him exposing my 19-year old self’s bad behaviour to a woman I’m no longer with. As my brain rattled, my phone buzzed on my ear where I held it. I maneuvered it slightly to see that Katie, my brother’s wife, was calling. 


“Right. Okay. Whatever.” Is all I could muster to my brother as I hovered my thumb over the ‘decline and answer’ button on my phone. A deep breath followed by the push of a button.


“Hi! Mike. How are you?” She said, pausing only long enough for a sharp inhale before she continued, “Sorry to call out of nowhere,, is Ryan with you?” She sounded worried.


I was at a loss, it just happened. It was word vomit. I know I failed. 


“Hey Katie.” I did my best to sound unbothered, “Yeah he is! Is he not answering?” I heard her breathe a stifled sigh of relief, “he’s down in the basement with some of the other boys helping me put up these damn shelves. The signal is so spotty down there, do you want me to get him to call you?” 


Her tone rang so differently now as I could actually hear her smile returning, “No! Don’t worry about it, Mike.” I had lied, she continued, “I’m so sorry to bother y’all. I’m so silly. Let him know that leftover chilli is in the fridge and there are a few pittas left in the microwave. I won’t wait up! Thanks!” 


*I’ve failed again.*


While I stared at my phone as the call ended, the screen dissolved into the last thing my phone had displayed before the first call from my brother; the locked google document. 


I pressed the little *‘password hint’* button just in case, and a new pop up bubble appeared that read *‘Helping you keep your promises since…’*


I remembered straight away, it was 1993. I remembered because that was the same year that I was born and I thought it was an ugly coincidence. As I typed in the four digits and pressed enter, my doorbell rang. 


I answered the door to a young delivery girl complete with bicycle bell and helmet, she grinned upon seeing me before she produced a small flower arrangement from behind her back. 


Six roses had been placed together and secured by a black ribbon that formed a beautiful bow, I couldn’t speak. She could see that, she looked at me with slight confusion as she said “it looks like someone has an admirer!” Before hopping back on to her bike. 


I couldn’t get my words to cooperate quick enough and by the time I could make noises that were words, she was already pretty far away, “who sent these?” I shouted at her as she innocently rode away, “Check the card!” She shouted back. 


I stumbled back inside my home where I sat at my kitchen table, the business card and my laptop still in place. I put the flowers down on the table to inspect the card before I glanced quickly at my phone — the google document. 


It had loaded, the password was correct. 


I don’t mean to be that guy. Maybe I’m being overly paranoid but it’s only been an hour or so since the flowers were delivered and I put the password in, I think I know what’s going on here but I need to be sure. Does anyone, anywhere know anything that could be relevant? Anything about Petals and Promises? 


Did anyone else take the survey I am referring to? 


When I am positive that I’m not just jumping to conclusions, I’ll explain everything. 


This started here. Can anyone help me?


I need answers before the next test.
