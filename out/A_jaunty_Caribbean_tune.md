One morning in early Spring, I was lazing in bed swiping on my phone. I wish I could say this was not my habit and that usually at this time I’d be stepping out of a cold shower after working out in the gym downstairs. But that would be a complete lie, so I won’t say it. At least I didn’t usually sleep past nine anymore.

I was watching a fresh episode of Good Mythical Morning on YouTube. I forget what Rhett and Link were doing but probably eating something strange. Most of the episodes weren’t as innovative as they used to be, but it was comforting to watch, like hanging out with old friends you always have the same conversations with.

Mid-bit, an unfamiliar jingle started playing over their brotherly ribbing. It seemed like an odd editorial choice, and the two comedians didn’t acknowledge it. I paused the video and realized that the song must be coming from some other program on my phone. Was I getting a call on some messaging app I barely used? Nothing was popping up on my screen and I didn’t have any new notifications.

It stopped after only a few bars.

I resumed the video.

A few minutes later, though, the same damn song. Again, no notifications. No calls. Just this quiet, simple, mysterious jingle. I had never heard this thing before that morning, and I didn’t think I’d installed any new apps recently. I listened carefully this time. It played four bars in total before going silent again.

It happened again an hour later as I was making a smoothie. This time it just started playing from my pocket. *Alright, time to get to the bottom of this*, I thought. I worked from home and didn’t have strict hours, and I was admittedly always open to excuses to procrastinate. I Googled, “my phone is playing a random jingle for no reason” and tapped the most promising link. It opened a Google help thread for the Pixel phone (what I have).

**Phone plays random alert "song", no record in notifications**

*Trying to figure out why my phone randomly plays a notification song that isn't in the library of alarms and when there is no alarm set, and no notification, and no activity on the phone.*

*Twice now, several weeks apart, not necessarily at the same time each occasion, and most recently at 5:23pm today, my phone randomly and loudly started playing what sounds like an alarm sound/song-- a repeating musical tone "dum, dum, da da da..dum, dum, da da da....dum dum da da da... It goes on for about a minute and then stops- nothing is happening, no notifications appear, the notification record shows only things like maps updates on traffic, and I have no alarms set.*  

*Totally puzzled and lost. I'm not technology illterate, but this mysterious and unexplanable behavior is annoying and worrisome.*

I tried to match the written sounds to the ones I’d been hearing, but it struck me how pretty much any melody at all could be mentally imposed upon a bunch of dum dums and da das in written form. There was a back and forth between sympathetic online do-gooders for awhile, before the OP posted again:

*Also, I found one obscure post in a pixel group in reddit referring to what I am sure is precisely the same phenomona-- though he termed it "pixel plays a random 'jaunty Caribbean tune' -- which is exactly what it is. The post was over a year old however, and seemed to be for an original pixel or pixel 2. No response yet to my pleas for information on whether he ever figured it out.*

At first I thought I was onto something here. My own troublesome tune could be called jaunty and Carribean. Maybe. Though it was also strangely melancholic. And it wasn’t loud. It was soft enough, in fact, that it could take several seconds to really notice consciously once it started playing.

My hopes were dashed when I scrolled down and listened to the video he uploaded. Definitely not the same. And he eventually figured out that it was caused by an app I had never heard of nor installed.

In 20 minutes of searching (a pretty large amount in Googling time and the most I could justify during a workday) that was the most promising lead.

I mostly forgot about it until I was in the shower late that night. At first I thought it was just my subconscious mind chewing over the notes looking for meaning in an unsolved mystery. But when I shut the water off and stuck my head out the curtain, I realized it was actually playing from where I’d left my phone on the counter.

In a split-second decision I jumped out to try to record it somehow. That would be tough, as I didn’t have anything to record with except my phone itself. But I keep a voice recorder app on my home screen just for such spontaneous recording occasions. However, even though I had wiped my hands on my towel on the way over, my finger was still too damp to properly register on the fingerprint scanner. By the time I entered my passcode, the four bars of song were already finished. All I was left with was a puddle of water to clean off the floor.

That night, the song played in my dreams, but it was probably more than just my dream engine recycling the day’s stimuli. As I mentioned before, I sleep with my phone on my nightstand. It had most likely been piping the song directly into my sleeping brain more than once that night.

While the notes were still fresh in my memory, I decided since I hadn’t been able to record it, perhaps I could reproduce it. I sat down at the electric piano in the other room, pausing only to wipe the sleep out of my eyes, then started to play.

After several minutes, I was experiencing a rising sense of unease. This was a simple tune. I should have it by now. As a hobbyist musician, I would often sit at my piano, reproducing melodies by ear from pop songs I had heard, just for fun. I thought I was pretty good at it. But the more I tried to capture this stupid simple tune, the slipperier it seemed to become. Even once I was pretty sure I had gotten all the elements right, it still sounded completely wrong. It was when I took an art class and tried to draw portraits. I would pay meticulous attention to minute details, proportions, and spacing of the facial features of the person I was trying to draw. But when I took a step back and just looked at what I had created, it wouldn’t look at all like that person.

After another ten minutes of tinkering, I realized that the notes I had chosen weren’t actually quite right. I begin to think that the real notes were all actually flatter or sharper than any of the 88 tones my keyboard could produce. Did it originate from a country where they used different musical scales or microtones? Unfortunately all that was beyond my hobbyist knowledge, and my fingers slid off the keys in defeat.

Later that week I was out at Victoria Bar having dinner with friends. We were laughing and having a good time when I realized that the hair on my arms was standing up. I did a mental inventory of what my senses were telling me. This took me longer than usual, given the mango margaritas in my system. The place was rowdy with a 20’s and 30’s crowd as usual. I remember this one lady there had a really shrill, unrestrained laugh, the kind that made people look around to see what could possibly be that fucking funny. She was laughing at that moment, and I had to wait for it to die down before I realized what had given me goose bumps.

I whipped my phone out and hushed my friends. “Listen!,” I said urgently, holding my phone out over the tater tots at the center of the table. The song ended only a couple of seconds later. “Did you guys hear that?” I asked. Confused looks and shaking heads. Damn. I let my head and shoulders slump dramatically toward the scraps of my dinner waffle. Too loud in here. I set out to tell them the tale so far, waving my hands and widening my eyes at appropriate moments to emphasize how spooky it all was. They were properly intrigued, and none of them had heard of anything like it before.

“What day did it start?” Samara asked. She had very expressive eyebrows that I had admired ever since we met in a college biology course, and her right one was raised quizzically now. I envied her ability to utilize either eyebrow for this, as I was only capable of raising my left. Trying to do so with the righty would only result in a look of constipation and, if I persisted long enough, an aching in my eyeballs. I was always amused by the fact that if I took too long to answer her question, she would switch which eyebrow was asking, simultaneously cocking her head and widening her eyes a bit to communicate that I was being too slow for her liking. She did so now.

“Uh, Friday? Yeah, Friday,” I replied.

“Friday,” she repeated, looking at me meaningfully.

I blinked at her slowly. “Ye-e-e-s. Friday,” I said again, wondering which of us was being dumb. I had a sinking feeling it was probably me.

Samara sighed and looked around. “Can anyone who left their apartment on Friday tell him what was special about that day?”

Vicente chimed in. He was probably the friend I was closest with there. Ever since we had spent two miserable and sometimes amazing summers together fighting wildfires for money, we had shared a bond that can only be formed by long hours of shared suffering. “I was driving for Uber Eats and someone ordered a jalapeño and olive sandwich. That doesn’t usually happen.”

Samara snapped her fingers and pointed at him. “Exactly.”

I tried to use my brain, but once again the margaritas were getting in the way. I raised my hands in exasperation, waiting for someone to spoon feed me the answer.

“April first,” Samara said at the same time Vicente said, “April Fools Day!”

“Oh. Woah. Yeah, you’re right. You think someone is playing a joke on me? And aren’t April Fools jokes supposed to end after April first?”

“Did anyone have access to your phone soon before it started?” Rob, Samara’s boyfriend. He was currently sporting a very Portland mustache with the tips waxed up into playful points. Combined with the interrogative, it made me feel like Hercule Poirot was questioning me about a case. Rob was an actor (not a professional one, though maybe he wanted to be), and the way he carried himself and spoke always made me feel like he was putting on a show that he’d rehearsed. I was never quite able to decide if I liked him or not, but he’d asked a good question.

I made stalling noises as I looked up at the ceiling and tried to remember anything at all about March 31st. It wasn’t that long ago. Seems like I’d be able to remember something about that day. But when you have the same basic routine, most days tended to blend together. “Wait, let me take a look here,” I said, pulling up the calendar on my phone for some tidbit that would jump start my memory.

While I looked, the others bandied hypotheses on other causes. Half-listening, it seemed like malware, an errant app, or a prank seemed like the most popular guesses. I informed my friends of my lack of human contact the day before the tune had started playing, and the mystery remained unsolved.

Vicente and I had an ultimate frisbee league game the next night. I’d played the sport off-and-on since college and had gotten Vicente into it. I remember it was a tight game but we had ultimately pulled ahead, so our spirits were high as I gave Vicente a ride home.

As we laughed about our times fighting fires together, I noticed Google Maps trying to direct me along a strange turn. I knew how to get back to Vicente’s place; I was just in the habit of using Google Maps so I’d have a heads-up about traffic. I pinched at the map to zoom out and see the bigger picture, but for the zoom function wouldn’t work. “Hey, do you think we should take this turn it’s telling us to take?”, I asked.

Vicente didn’t give it more than a second before replying, “No way. Just go the way we always do.”

I shut off my phone screen and stuck to our usual route. I kept expecting to hit some traffic that would explain the route change, but it never came.

I would have forgotten about this incident had it not happened three more times that week. Each time I would get suspicious when a turn seemed strange and unfamiliar. I would try to zoom out to see what was going on, but the map wouldn’t zoom. Then I would just shut it down and continue on the way I knew.

Just before the last time my maps tried to lead me into the unknown, I was hiking with Vicente up one of Portland’s forested buttes. Our hiking cadence is a bit unusual. It consists of one of us running up ahead or clambering up a boulder, then throwing a frisbee back and forth a couple of times, aiming right at the other guy’s heart. It’s a success if he doesn’t have to move his feet to catch it. If he does have to move and doesn’t actually catch it, it’s up to you to run over and grab the disc. (You must be punished for your inaccuracy.)

Vicente popped out from behind a tree 15 yards ahead of me and flicked the disc through the air. It was a little high, but I was able to stretch up and snatch it without jumping. “Hey,” I said, “do you feel like a man?”

“Hey, my throw wasn’t that bad,” he retorted.

“No,” I laugh. “I’m serious. When did you feel like you stopped being a boy and started being a man? Sometimes I feel like a man, but other times I’m not sure. I’m not a father or a husband. I haven’t been to war. I don’t know how to build a house. I didn’t go out into the desert for three days alone and return a man. My favorite thing to do is play with frisbees, which are toys. You know?”

“Hmm, maybe you’re right,” Vicente says. “You’re 27, right? If we were living in prehistory you’d be a grandfather by now.”

“Right! Instead, I’m a wage slave working a job I don’t care about to pay off student loans for an education I don’t use and don’t think I needed.”

“At least you have a steady job,” he said. “Food delivery sucks, man. I barely make enough to keep up my car and stay off the street. I’d make more if I was driving people, but my car is too old.”

“All that’s gonna change when your music hits critical mass, bro, no doubt. Heads!” I yelled and threw the disc at his back. He spun and clapped his hands together, trapping the disc between them. “Nice one.”

I wasn’t just saying that. I thought Vicente was really skilled at making electronic music. It was all wizardry to me, but I could tell that his beats were something special. I wish I had something like that—something that could actually get me places in the modern world.

“Well I don’t know what makes a man, but I sure know I’ll feel like one when I make my first million doing what I love,” he said.

Vicente threw the disc forward at a sharp angle up and to the right. It reached toward the sky and then dipped down a backwards, right into my hands. Perfect.

Vicente and I had a lot of conversations like this. He had been my copilot when we were firefighters. That makes it sound like I was a pilot, but I was just driving a van full of dirty men and tools. I got paid more for being behind the wheel, but it meant less sleep. Before and after a shift, when most were snoozing in the back to make up the deficit, I had to stay alert and get us to the fire or to camp. And when driving hundreds of miles between fires, sometimes I’d have to stay up most of the night driving and then work a full shift the next day, catching a few minutes of rest here and there in the dirt or against a tree when it was safe. I did like the extra $50 per day, but I also really, really liked sleep (and still do).

Vicente, though. He almost always stayed awake with me, chatting, joking, choosing the music. He didn’t get paid any extra aside from enjoying the most comfortable seat, but he never complained about it. We had a lot of time for deep discussion up there, and there were few topics we didn’t touch.

I clapped him on the shoulder as we stopped to appreciate a view of the city. “Thanks for being a good friend, Vicente.”

An hour later, I’m driving Vicente home when I say to him, “It’s happening again.” We were stopped at a red light when I noticed my map taking us once again in the wrong direction. I confirmed it by trying to zoom and scroll the map unsuccessfully.

“What do you mean?” he asked.

“The map thing! My phone is trying to take me somewhere. Not your apartment.” The driver behind us honked, and I realized that the light was green. I turned left as my map wanted me to, then promptly pulled over into a convenience store parking lot. “Look, try to scroll around and see where it’s taking us,” I said, handing Vicente my phone. “The same thing happened the other day, remember? We just ignored it and went to your place. But this has happened a few more times since then.”

“Huh,” Vicente grunted, fiddling with the map for a moment. He gazed at a discarded soda cup by the curb, then fixed me with a bright-eyed grin. “So let’s check it out. Who knows, maybe it’s like a secret Portland Medallion.”

“A what?” I asked.

“The Portland Medallion. Every year, a medallion is hidden somewhere in Portland, and they give clues to lead people to it. Only one person can win. I think they get a few thousand dollars.”

“I’ve lived here most of my life. How have I never heard of this before?”

“Just not paying attention I guess.”

I rolled my eyes. “Alright, fuck it. Let’s go find out what the hell is going on.” I pulled the car back into the flow of traffic and headed west toward the setting sun.

I couldn’t see our final destination, but the estimated time of arrival was counting down minute by minute. A sense of expectation and eagerness was growing within me. Now that I was on this path, I was excited to find where it led. I kept glancing at the estimated arrival time to ensure I was making good time. I felt an anxiety that I would miss something important if I didn’t keep up with the estimate. And there was another feeling that underpinned everything else.

“Do you ever get a sense of deja vu?” I asked Vicente. “I feel like we’ve done this before. Maybe I dreamed about it and only partly remember.”

Vicente looked at me blankly. “Spooky.” Then he grinned.

“Yeah…” 

I sensed the approach of something familiar yet unknown. It seemed as though if I just thought long and hard enough, I would remember what was coming—despite knowing that was impossible.

We passed through downtown and kept on until an expanse of trees stretched out to either side before us. Forest Park: the largest city park in the world. I’d been there probably a dozen times and explored some of the trails, which were usually populated by joggers, hikers, and dog-walkers. There were large stretches of the park that you wouldn’t see from any trail, however.

Soon, we reached a point where the the course laid out for us veered into the park, but there was no road or even a visible walking path. I parallel parked, and for once I was able to do so with no extra back-and-forth. The sun was setting now, casting a strange light over everything. I looked over at Vicente. It seemed like an ideal spooky time for the song to start playing, but it didn’t. “I guess it’s a hike from here. In for a penny, in for a pound?” I hoped I was using that saying right. I took a headlamp from my glovebox and gave it to Vicente. In answer, he took it and got out of the car. I grabbed my pack and followed.

Vicente and I spent a few minutes looking for a path near where the map said to enter, but there was nothing but forested hill. Fortunately we were already dressed for a hike and wearing long pants, so we forged the best path we could through the underbrush.

We didn’t follow the course set out by the map exactly, choosing instead to take the avenues of least resistance. In my experience Forest Park never really got dark; the lights of the surrounding city lent it a persistent ethereal glow. But for some reason this night was different, and soon the dense canopy and failing daylight prompted us to use our lights—Vicente with my headlamp and me just with the flash on my phone. 

The sounds of the city faded as well, replaced by the hoots of bard owls, a gusty breeze moving through the foliage, coiled tree trunks squeaking and creaking as they rubbed against one another, and for a few minutes the yipping cries of a coyote pack. Fortunately, those came from south of us, not east where we were headed. Vicente and I were largely silent but for consultations about which route through the brush to take. Whenever he swung his head back to talk he’d end up blinding me, so I told him not to look back, just keep his light pointed forward and I’d tell him which direction to go. A light rain began to patter onto the leaves above us.

When my phone showed that we were just a few minutes away, I put my hand on Vicente’s shoulder to stop him. “We’re close,” I said in a low voice. “Turn off your light for a minute.” He did, and I wrapped my hand around my own light, allowing my eyes to adjust to the darkness. I consciously slowed my breathing and strained my senses to see if I could detect anything notable: a light in the distance, voices—anything. It was raining more heavily now, however. The white noise was like a blanket over our heads, muffling any other sounds. Water dripped down my back and plastered my hair to my forehead.

“What are we waiting for?” Vicente asked.

“I just wanted—” I began to answer him, but that damned song began playing and I dropped my phone in startlement. It landed with the light shining upward into my face, so after I grabbed it I was again blinded for several moments.

“Dude, shut that thing off,” Vicente said. “I think I hear something.”

I tried reducing the volume, but it had no effect. I didn’t want to turn the phone off and lose my light, so I squeezed where I knew the speaker outlets were to quiet it as much as I could and listened again, frozen. At first I didn’t hear what Vicente was talking about. All I heard was the patter of rain, our own breathing, and the song. 

The song. It was echoing strangely. We looked at each other as the song played to its finish, but the echo continued for another two bars. No, not an echo. It was coming from somewhere else around us as well as from my phone. Goose bumps prickled across my body as we confirmed with each other what we both just thought we heard. Vicente ventured, “Hello?”, and I hissed at him to be quiet as fear got the best of me.

A female voice called, “Who’s there?” and we both jumped. “Shit!” I croaked. Vicente broadcast our names and asked for hers. 

A light clicked on, some brush rustled, and a figure emerged. She was a bit taller and wider than me, with the whites of her eyes clearly visible all the way around. She seemed out of place in the woods, wearing dark tights under a peach-colored dress and green coat. “I’m Martina. You heard the song too?” she asked, shifting her weight from foot to foot.

“Yeah,” I responded. “Well, it’s been playing on my phone, but we both heard it and followed the map out here. Do you…do you know what it is?”

Martina shook her head, her dark wet curls swaying under her knit cap. “I was just on the way home from dinner and my maps started leading me out here. It wasn’t that far so I decided to check it out this time. Whatever it is has been trying to get me out here all week. I shouldn’t even be out here by myself. I don’t know what I was thinking. I didn’t think it’d be so deep in here, you know? Uh, anyway, I’m rambling. My grandma says I do that when I’m nervous. Have you two found anything?”

I was a little taken aback by how chatty she was right from the beginning. She reminded me of a cousin of mine in that way. “Just you,” Vicente said.

I was about to say something when another voice called out from behind us, “You all here cause of the song, right?”

I yelled and nearly jumped out of my skin as I swept my light around, and the others weren’t much better composed. This fourth person at least seemed prepared for a hike. He wore military-style boots and pack, with cargo pants and a hooded raincoat. A light attached to his backpack strap pointed downward, washing the brush at his feet in white light.

“OK!” Vicente called out to the woods in exasperation, “Is there anyone else in the woods who’d like to come out and say hello!?”

No other volunteers came forward. I introduced us to the newcomer and asked his name.

“Aaron,” he said simply.

“Well to answer your question, Aaron, yes we’re here because of the song,” I said. “Do you know what it is?”

Aaron took a bottle from his pack, taking his time to twist off the cap and enjoy a swallow. “It’s a game,” he finally said. “That’s the only answer makes sense to me.” “Games have a winner. I’m going to be that winner, and I’m counting on a prize.” He looked us up and down critically. “You all can follow me, but only if you’re OK with second place.”

Martina spoke up. “And what’s if it’s something else? Something dangerous?”

Aaron lifted up the side of his raincoat, revealing a pistol holstered at his hip, open-carry style. “If someone comes at me with something other than a prize, then I can handle that too.” It didn’t sound like a boast, just a statement of fact.

My stomach turned a bit at the sight of the firearm. I wasn’t sure if Aaron meant it as a threat or a reassurance, but the mere sight of it seemed to raise the stakes of what we were all doing out here.

“Keep going or not, it’s your choice,” Aaron said. “I’m going. I don’t mind if you follow me, but I won’t wait for you.” With that, he turned and began hiking up the slope ahead of us.

The three of us looked at each other. Vicente shrugged, “We’ve come this far, right?”

Despite the anxiety dancing in my stomach from the surprises of the last few minutes, the feverish curiosity and excitement was still stronger. “I’m in,” I said. “And I’m okay with second place if it also means we don’t have to be the first ones to walk into whatever’s ahead. Martina?”

She hesitated and chewed at her lip for a moment. But she nodded, and we all began to follow Aaron’s bobbing light ahead. It seemed we were all caught between not wanting to lose him and not wanting to get too close, so our pace stuttered between hurried rushes and hesitant, careful pauses.

“Hey Martina,” Vicente started, “you said your maps have been trying to lead you here all week, right?”

“Yes!” she said. “I thought it was just a glitch, but I reinstalled the app and it was still happening. Yesterday I even switched to a completely different maps app, and tonight it still sent me here! That’s when I couldn’t resist anymore.”

“Oh, whoa,” I said. “I didn’t try that. That’s really weird.”

Vicente then turned to me, “And you said you’ve been seeing this happen for a few days too. And since the three of you have been roped into this, it makes sense that others have probably been seeing this too. It seems pretty far fetched that we’re the first ones to come out here. If there’s just one ‘winner’ to this thing, I don’t think it’s going to be him.” Vicente gestured to Aaron’s outline ahead of us.

That sunk in while we hiked on. The loudest sounds in my ears were our footsteps and my own breath against the backdrop of gentle rainfall. Eventually, I realized it probably wasn’t smart to just blindly follow Aaron. I pulled up my own map again. And I stopped in my tracks.

“Hey what’s wrong?” Vicente asked.

“Martina, you’ve got your map? Let’s compare real quick. It looks to me like we’re going the wrong way. Vicente, make sure you don’t lose sight of Aaron, OK?”

Martina pull up her map. We held our phones side-by-side and both tried to make sense of them. My map was North-oriented and hers self-oriented, so it took a minute, but soon we confirmed that not only did our maps differ from the direction we were going—they also differed from one another. “Shit,” she said, looking at me questioningly.

“Hey, I think I lost him!” Vicente called from up ahead.

“Shit,” I echoed Martina. “Come on!” We hurried up to Vicente.

“I’m sorry man, his light was there one second and gone the next,” Vicente said.

“Hey Aaron! You still out there?” I yelled out with more bravado than I felt.

We all went silent and listened to a response. None came.

“He probably decided to ditch us and hurry to the prize,” I said to the others. “Seems to me we have three choices. We chase after him, we follow my map, or we follow Martina’s map.”

“Four choices,” Vicente said. “We could just get out of here.”

I looked at him skeptically. He wasn’t the type to back down from something once he’d started. Before I could say anything, though, Martina spoke up. “No. Nuh-uh. This is the most interesting thing to happen to me all year. I want to find out what this is. You’re in, right?” she asked of me. “We can follow your map, I don’t mind. I don’t need to win, I just don’t want to always wonder, you know?”

“If Vicente wants to call it, I’ll head back,” I said, looking to Vicente. “But I’m in to keep going if you are.”

The truth is, I knew he wouldn’t back down if I put it this way. I was just trying to appear noble and considerate, but really all I cared about in that moment was solving the mystery. And just like I thought, Vicente backed me up. He was a really good friend, and I probably didn’t deserve him.

Let me take an aside here to acknowledge that I’ve dallied in details that may not seem important to the facts of the story. I think it’s because I cherish the opportunity to inhabit that time of my life again, even if only in memory. Life feels different now. Worse. I’ll try to keep it factual from here on out and not give too much conjecture. I don’t want my theories to bias your conclusions about what the rest of this means.

We followed my map. I led the way, glancing between the screen and the 10 feet of forest illuminated in front of me by my phone’s flash light. I was hiking fast. Despite not knowing what the hell was really going on here, I felt that I was running out of time.

Then my flashlight went out. I looked down at my screen, and it was pure white. I remember my vision kind of shuddered or vibrated. The next thing I remember is catching myself on my hands and knees. I’d tripped over a branch or log. The thing is, I didn’t think that I’d even been walking, so how did I trip? I looked around for my friends—I think I had already lumped Martina into that category—but didn’t see their lights or hear their footsteps.

“Vicente?” I called out. “Martina?” They were gone. My phone was gone. I patted my pockets and searched around me as best I could. The hills, brush, and trees seemed wrong, unfamiliar. I yelled out again, fear and anxiety changing the pitch of my voice.

“Vic—!” I choked off halfway through Vicente’s name when I saw a light off to my left. It was faint and yellow, not the tone of any of the lights the others had been using. Despite that, I started toward it. Every half minute or so I’d stop and peer at the light, trying to judge what it was and whether I was getting any closer to it. The more I examined it, the more odd it seemed. It was a single point of yellow light. Its size hadn’t changed despite the time I’d been walking. I couldn’t see that it was illuminating anything, which made it very difficult to gauge how far away it was.

“Vicente!” I called out again. My body was wetter than I thought it should be, and I was shaking with cold or anxiety or both. I stopped and pressed the heels of my hands against my eyes, rubbing at my head in an attempt to center and calm myself.

Goosebumps prickled up my arms when I realized that I could still see that light even with my eyes shut tight.

My first thought was that it was a visual burn-in, like the artifact of the sun that you can still see with your eyes closed after glancing at it. But those artifacts would move with your eye. When I looked to the left, the light was to the right. When I looked to the right, the light was to the left. It was in exactly the same position whether my eyes were open or closed.

I looked back the way I had come and faced another shock. This one had me feeling nauseous with a sense of vertigo.

I could still see the light even when it was behind me. I could *see behind me*, though this new dimension of vision was limited to that steady yellow light.

My shiver turned into a violent seizing chill that brought me to my knees. I tried to focus on the sensation of the damp forest floor between my fingers and get myself together. For a moment I questioned whether I was dreaming, but I knew that I was not.

I don’t know how long it took me to get back up, but I know that when I did I headed toward that light. Vicente was out here somewhere, and I had a better chance of finding him wherever I was being led than by walking in another random direction.

The rain was falling harder now, and I could hear my feet squelching in my shoes with every step. I continued to take the risk of calling out my friends’ names. I even called out for Aaron once in a while.

Then the song. It was close. I ran back and forth across the forest floor until I honed in on where it was coming from. I knelt down and found my phone, screen still shining white. “How did it get here?” I wondered aloud. No, not my phone. The size and texture felt unfamiliar in my hands.

The song, instead of ending, redoubled and began to echo around me in a way the felt unnatural. Much like it had sounded when we first encountered Martina, only multiplied. From where I stood, I saw at least half a dozen more pale white lights amidst the brush, scattered all around me. Phones.

I began walking toward one when I saw a human shape lying at my feet and nearly fell over in surprise.

“Hello?” I said, approaching again and shining a light down. It took my brain a moment to process what I was looking at. Not a person. Just clothes. But clothing arranged in the shape of an outfit. Two brown leather shoes with black socks inside them, open ends touching the pant legs of khaki jeans. Above that, a plaid shirt inside a black jacket. The jacket was zipped. There was a necklace, too—a piece of jade on a silver chain. I checked the pants and saw that even the fly was zipped and buttoned.

Feeling numb but knowing now what to look for, I searched and soon found another set of clothes. This set was face-down but otherwise similarly arranged.

More quickly now I moved on and searched for—then found—another. Then another. I was urgently searching for and hoping not to find something familiar. I most dreaded seeing the orange and white jacket that Vicente wore so often, including today.

I saw a brighter light up on the ground up ahead and went straight for it. I could tell quickly that it was Aaron’s clothing. His light was still clipped to the strap of his backpack. I knelt and lifted his jacket where he had done the same before. There was his pistol, still dry and strapped into the holster on his belt.

Any lingering hope that this was all a prank or something innocent disappeared in that moment. Grimly, I unsnapped the clasp and drew the pistol. It felt awkward and heavier than expected in my grip. I’d fired one a couple of times long ago, but as far as I knew different brands had different types of safeties. I couldn’t see any obvious switch or button, so I assumed it was ready to fire.

I dropped the phone I’d been using face-down on the ground and unclipped Aaron’s light instead. I held it out in front of me in a slow pan to examine my surroundings and hoped not to see orange.

I saw a bit of peach color.

A peach dress under a green coat, with a knit cap and black tights looking small and shriveled without legs to fill them.

I was contemplating the sight, feeling empty, when the yellow light returned. It changed nothing about what was in my actual field of vision, but I could see it behind me. Brighter than before. Much brighter. Somehow I could feel that it was close.

I took a deep, silent breathe and internally counted to three. Then I spun around, lifting my two weapons—the pistol and man-made light.

The whole world shuddered. My body went numb and my sense of time broke. I could have been there for half a second or half the night.

Then my head was hurting and I was on the ground, blinking my mind back into my body. There was an impression of something large moving very quickly away from me. I felt something under my fingers and grabbed it, pushing myself to my feet and into a desperate, primal run through the dark forest.

I remember flashes here. I remember the pain in my throat from breathing so hard. I remember the impact of branches against my skin. I remember hearing a pop in my ankle and tumbling down a slope, then lying there in silence and hoping not to hear the sounds of pursuit.

Eventually, I remembered that I was holding something and looked at it. I started crying. It was Vicente’s disc. The one we’d been tossing back and forth just a few hours ago. The realization of what must have happened hit me hard, and I cried silently and convulsively for several minutes.

Then I got up and started back in the direction I thought I’d come from. I had to go back for him. My now-swollen and throbbing ankle slowed me significantly, however. And my sense of direction was completely shot. Nevertheless, I wandered and searched for my friend until dawn before making the half-conscious decision to get back to civilization.

I found a bus that took me close enough to Samara’s house to walk the rest of the way. She was the closest person I knew. I held onto hope that we could call Vicente together and he would answer, wondering what the hell had happened to me after we got separated. But he didn’t answer. He’s never answered again.

That was three months ago. I filed a missing person’s report, but I didn’t know how much to say about what happened. I didn’t want them to write me off as a nutjob and not search. I settled on a version of the truth. That Vicente and I had gone hiking, that we had met two others in Forest Park, that I’d gotten separated from them and never saw my friend again. I call every week for an update but it doesn’t seem like the police are taking it seriously.

Vicente’s parents are in Mexico. I feel a responsibility to tell them what I know, but I’m certain they won’t believe me or find any comfort in what I have to say. I feel like a comforting lie would be the kindest thing, but my conscience won’t let me do that. So instead they’re probably worried sick, just as tortured as me.

I told Samara and Rob the full truth. But they either straight up don’t believe me or they think I’m traumatized or crazy or something. They haven’t plainly told me they don’t want to be friends, but they don’t call or message me anymore.

I’ve tried to find Martina and Aaron or their families, but so far I’ve had no luck. I posted on CraigsList and social media, even tried the newspaper. I keep thinking I’ll find a news story or poster or something about one of them having gone missing, but nothing. One day on the street I thought I saw Aaron. I ran up to him and almost said something, but I faltered in doubt when I got close. He looked at me suspiciously but without recognition and kept walking. It wasn’t him. I don’t think it was him.

I’m sick. But no doctor has been able to diagnose me. My online research tells me it could be something nebulous like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but that has no clear cause or cure. I get rashes. Cold sweats in the night. Some days I can hardly get out of bed. I have a lot of trouble concentrating, except for streaks of obsessiveness. It’s taken me two months to write all this out. I think I’m going to lose my job.

I don’t know where to go from here, but I felt that I had to get my truth out there. If you know anything about what happened to my friend, please tell me. 

And please, if you start hearing that song, smash your phone into a thousand pieces before it takes your life away like it took Vicente’s.

Like it took mine.
