It all started yesterday, as per usual i was on my phone scrolling through my FYP. Outside was silent, everyone was in a deep sleep while i was on my phone suffocating my laughs so my parents wouldn’t wake up. I tried my hardest not to make noise when i ate snacks. Then it happened. A large bang came from the ceiling. I thought nothing of it at first and went about my nightly routine. Then it happened again just a few minutes later, it was starting to feel off. It was too quiet. 

I looked outside my window and something cold went down my spine. The window wasn’t open or anything so I didn’t know whether it was my imagination from being on r/nosleep so much. The time was around 2:30 AM when I decided that I had enough and went to sleep. But it happened again, this time it was more violent. It happened at least three more times, before I went to the attic to see what was up. A bunch of my dad’s old tennis stuff was falling, but it was oddly placed, like as a decoy. I was too tired to notice it then so I just went back to my room. I flopped onto my bed, checking the time and it was 2:31 AM. I got some rest until I heard another bang from the attic, this one paired with a loud scream. It seemed like only I could 
hear it. I heard a woman.

“HELP!” The voice cried out.

I froze in my bed, it no longer felt warm and comfy. It was trying to get me out. When I stepped out it felt like my room was warmer than my bed; I had to check the boiler when I was finished. I went up to the attic, using my phone as a flashlight. I heard a woman crying and sobbing; she was in hysterics. I walked closer to where the sobbing originated from, and I saw a phone. It was playing the crying on repeat, and the attic door slammed shut. 

The crying felt real now, accompanied by footsteps and clanging metal; the item which was used to make the banging sound that I’ve been hearing all night. A brunette woman walked out with bloodshot eyes, her hands covered in something. She looked mental. I grabbed a tennis racket and ball, ready for whatever was about to happen. Her footsteps sped up as she was in front of me at inhumane speed. She wasn’t human, I could tell. I threw the tennis ball in the air and whacked it with the tennis racket and it flew at her head, knocking her onto the floor. I ran to the attic door, climbing down the folding ladder and shutting it tight, locking it. Her cries became rage. I went downstairs to call 999, and when they arrived they said that they saw a woman running on all fours into the woods. I never went into the attic again after that.
