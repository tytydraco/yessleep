Where it all began [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/149n8fd/im\_the\_only\_person\_who\_has\_reappeared\_after\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/149n8fd/im_the_only_person_who_has_reappeared_after_an/)

It felt like I was being run over by a train.

That was the only way I could describe the searing pain I felt as my body hit the ground after foolishly deciding to jump out of the train. The train was moving fast, much faster than a normal train would go.

I almost decided against it, but when I saw that thing at the other end of the tracks, a strictly human voice with such a horrifying body, I had to jump. I knew instantly that if I had stayed, my body would be destroyed beyond recognition, probably into whatever those creatures are.

I shudder even thinking about them now, 2 years later. It had human clothes attached to it, but everything, from the overly long arms to the pitch black limbs to the pure white eyes, were horrifying.

I couldn't come up with an explanation at the time, but looking back at it, I know now. That thing is evil. Evil in its purest form.

Miraculously, I forced myself to stand up. Despite the horrible pain I had and crunch noises I heard upon impact, the pain was fading at a rapid rate. I looked at my hands. They were barely even cut, despite taking the brunt of the blow as I had protected my head.

A brief part of me told me that I shouldn’t be alive, that this wasn’t normal, but I wished it away. I had to get out of here.

I looked around the area. There were the train tracks, of course, and trees, but other than that there was empty blackness. The dark did not make the trees hard to point out, it was as though someone had painted the scene on a canvas rather than actually worry about how light works. Whatever this place is, it isn’t natural. I was right that this place isn’t anywhere on Earth. I even feared that the trees would be fake or go on forever in this nightmare world.

I thought back to that feeling of dread I felt on the train ride. Could that have been the time when we transferred into this world? If that was the case, I was in luck. It hadn’t even been a minute since I had left the train after that weird feeling of dread. It would only be a few miles at most to the exit, assuming I could get there.

I began walking along the train tracks. I was the only thing making sound since the train had gone so far away at this point. The crunch sound of my feet calmly hitting the ground followed by the occasional clang whenever my feet accidentally hit the train tracks.

For a brief, foolish moment, I let the niceties of the moment take my worries away. The dead silence was something that people with sense would be afraid of, but as the father of a newborn, the silence was fulfilling.

I stopped and looked up to see if there were any stars in the sky. There wasn’t. Only black, empty sky. I could almost make out a purple swirl up above that moved with an almost hypnotic motion, but the colors were too similar for me to tell for sure.

However, when I stopped moving, the sound of footsteps continued.

I ran.

This time, I ran away from the tracks. The trees all around me could provide cover. It was easy to see in the dark here, but it could still provide some decent cover. Despite me running, I could hear whatever behind me and their footsteps, growing louder and louder as I kept sprinting. Twice I almost tripped, but caught myself just in time.

I got a lucky break. The first of many. The forest was not endless, and I reached the edge of a cliff-side. At the bottom of the cliff was a river that must’ve been deep. I was surprised I couldn’t hear the river earlier, but the cliff was so high up the noise must’ve been obscured by it.

I stared at the water. Even though practically everything in this world was black, the river maintained an eerie light blue.

I had to make a decision for myself. Run along the cliff face or run into the river. If I had to wait to see that creature again to make a decision, there was no chance I would have time. The footsteps kept getting closer and closer to the point where I could almost hear panting from behind me.

I remembered jumping off the train. The pain I felt, it was nothing I had ever felt before. It beats a near death experience, it was a death experience. I should be dead. I did something foolish that should have killed me.

But it didn’t.

That was the thought that resounded through my mind as I jumped off the cliff-face. In the real world, that would have killed me. In the real world, this would kill me. But this place, whatever it is, seems to make the impossible possible.

I plunged into the water. For the third time that day, everything hurt. I wanted to resurface in the water, but I just kept sinking. It felt like a million bricks were on my shoulders as I fell down the river with tremendous speed.

I’m not a great swimmer, but I’ve been to my fair share of pools. That sound that you hear when you’re underwater and you hear someone else jump in below you? Unmistakable.

I heard the same sound almost directly above me. The water obstructed my view, so I couldn’t quite see it. Then I heard it again. And again.

I wasn’t being followed by just the ticket collector. Obviously there were more creatures here than just one. I was foolish. I thought that I would have to have a brief few mile walk and then they would just let me waltz out of the area. What was I thinking? Obviously nothing smart.

Then I stopped myself as I came to a terrifying realization. The creatures were still pretty far behind me when I jumped, which means they must’ve jumped immediately after seeing the water below. They weren’t scared at all of the water, which was my hope. That meant one thing. They could swim too, and probably a lot better than me.
