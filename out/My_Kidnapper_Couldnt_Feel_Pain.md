I woke to a smell that shouldn’t have existed anywhere outside a morgue — bleach cut with rust and something sour-metallic like coins held in the mouth. My head throbbed; my eyes refused to open at first. The dark was so complete it felt like fabric pressed to my face. When I tried to move, pain shot through my shoulders and up my neck. My arms were suspended above me.

The bindings were layers of torn cloth cinched tight with plastic zip ties. My hands had gone cold and pale, fingers tingling, almost blue. Each time I tried to shift, a new line of pain flared — burning, stabbing, tearing — radiating out from my joints like cracking glass.

Somewhere, a sound began: a low humming, tuneless, at first far away, then circling me. My heart slammed against my ribs. I tasted bile in the back of my throat.
The humming stopped. Footsteps scraped concrete. A metallic click. A single fluorescent bulb stuttered to life above me, casting a greenish glare across cinder block walls.

The walls were wrapped floor to ceiling in butcher paper. Anatomical diagrams scrawled in black ink covered every surface — nervous systems, muscle groups, hospital pain scales with handwritten notations in the margins. Words like nociception, analgesia, stimulus written and underlined. In places the ink had bled, streaked downward like someone had pressed their face to it and wept.

“You’re awake,” a voice said.

They stepped into the light. At first they looked like a tired grad student: thin frame, pale skin, dark hair hanging in their eyes. But their arms told a different story — a network of pale scars crosshatched from wrist to elbow, stitched with surgical neatness. A missing fingertip sealed in shiny tissue. They wore a dark apron stiff with old stains.

“I’m glad,” they said softly. “You can help me understand.”

My mouth opened but only a hoarse rasp emerged. “Who… who are you?”

“They called me lucky. Congenital analgesia. No pain. But pain is how you know you’re alive.”

They raised a hand. A hypodermic needle pierced the fleshy web between thumb and forefinger. No blood. The wound had been cauterized. They twisted the steel shaft as if tuning an instrument. “This should hurt,” they whispered. “But it’s only pressure. Tell me — what would this feel like to you?”

I stared at the hole in their hand, nausea rising like acid. “Like… burning glass,” I croaked. “Glass under the skin.”
Their pupils dilated. “Burning glass,” they repeated. “Better than textbooks.”

They lowered me from the ceiling and bolted me into a wooden chair stained dark. My ankles were duct-taped to the legs; my wrists bound behind me. They draped a blanket across my shoulders — smelling of rust and bleach — like a caretaker preparing a patient.

“You’ll stay warmer this way,” they said. “Shivering corrupts the data.”

A clipboard appeared with fifty blank lines under Pain Vocabulary.

They began on themselves: hands plunged into ice water until their skin blued, then blasted with a blow dryer until flesh pinked, then blanched. Each time they asked me to describe it, my voice trembling.

“Needles under the skin,” I said. “Glass splinters. Heat like peeling sunburn alive.”

“Peel you,” they murmured, writing it down.

Then it was my turn. A rubber band snapping against my forearm, a pinch of tweezers to the thin skin between thumb and index. Even minor acts were magnified by terror, the stench, the inevitability of escalation.

By night (if it was night — the light never changed), my arms and hands trembled uncontrollably. My lips cracked from dryness. Tears streaked salt across my face. I pictured my apartment, my cat, the smell of coffee at dawn — normal life turning alien and unreachable.

On the second day, their fascination intensified. A small hammer, a steel plate, and a scalpel lay waiting on a tray.

They placed their own left hand flat on the plate, raised the hammer, and brought it down. A sound like a branch snapping. Their index finger bent at an unnatural angle. They didn’t blink.

“What would it feel like?” they hissed, eyes shining.
I gagged, bile rising. “Every nerve screaming… lightning inside… something wrong, ripped apart.”

They closed their eyes, whispering: “Wronged. Yes. That’s the one.”

Then came me. Rubber bands became clamps, tweezers became pinpricks of sharp metal. Every touch magnified by dread. My skin crawled. My nerves lit up like live wires.

I began crying without sound, tears running down my cheeks, soaking the blanket. My hands went numb. I tried to think of my name, my address, anything to anchor myself — but the basement smell dragged me back: bleach, rust, cooked meat.

Hallucinations began at the edges: whispers in corners, my own reflection in puddles where none existed, the sense of someone standing behind me even when I knew we were alone.

On the third day, they introduced electricity.
A car battery appeared on a metal cart, wires dangling from crude clips. Sparks popped when they tested the connection, filling the basement with the scent of ozone. Their broken finger was splinted, stained brown at the tips.

They sketched diagrams of the experiment on the wall with chalk, neat as blueprints. “This will be the one,” they whispered. “This will let me feel.”

First they shocked themselves. Sparks danced along pale flesh. Muscles twitched, lips parted, but they barely blinked.

Then they turned to me.
The wires bit into my forearms like insect mandibles. My muscles seized violently, my heart slamming so hard I thought it would rupture. The smell of ozone and burning cloth made me gag.

“Tell me,” they said. “Tell me what it feels like.”

“Fire,” I gasped. “Fire in my veins. Needles full of fire.”

They closed their eyes. “Fire in the veins. Yes…”

It was then I realized they weren’t immune to fear — only to pain. Their hand trembled over the switch. Their breathing came fast. A flicker of uncertainty crossed their eyes as I began whispering.

“You’re doing it wrong,” I rasped. “Pain isn’t just sensation — it’s fear, helplessness, losing control. You have to let go.”

They tilted their head. “Fear. Losing control.”

“Yes,” I whispered, throat raw. “That’s the key.”
By the end of the third day, my reality had thinned to a filament.

My skin was a map of bruises and pinpricks.
My muscles trembled uncontrollably.
My mind slipped in and out of hallucination.
Memories of sunlight and human voices seemed like a book I’d read long ago.

But a seed had taken root: the understanding that fear was their weakness, and my only way out.

When I came to again, there was no sense of day or night — just the single green bulb above me and a hollow ache through my arms and legs. My wrists were raw; the skin beneath the duct tape had turned angry red. My teeth chattered before I realized they’d placed a metal basin in front of me.

“Ice first,” they murmured. Their voice was thin from sleeplessness but eager.

They seized my hands, wrists clamped like a vise, and plunged them into the basin. The water was so cold it felt sharp. My fingers went bone-white, then blue. Pain raced up my arms in jagged streaks, each nerve shattering into splinters. My throat convulsed. I couldn’t tell if the sound coming out of me was a sob or a laugh.
“Describe,” they ordered, eyes on me as if I were the only object in the room.

“Like… a hundred knives in the marrow… like my bones are glass and someone’s rattling them,” I whispered.
They nodded, scribbling notes. Then, without warning, they drew my hands out and pressed warm cloths doused with some chemical that burned as it thawed my skin. The agony multiplied. My flesh felt as if it were peeling, nerve endings sparking like loose wires.

I thought of mornings in my apartment: sunlight cutting across a wooden floor, my cat blinking at me from the couch. It made me dizzy with grief. I had to swallow back a scream that wasn’t about the pain but the memory of normalcy.

“Shivering corrupts data,” they murmured again, almost fondly, and wrapped my shoulders in the damp blanket.

They rolled in the battery again. This time the wires were tipped with small clamps instead of crude paddles. Sparks popped when the clips met. Ozone stung my throat, metallic and acrid.

They clamped the wires to their own forearm first. The muscle jumped, the skin quivered, but they only breathed harder, eyes wide as though at the edge of revelation.

Then they turned to me.

When the current hit, my body went rigid. My jaw locked. My heart banged like a fist against my ribs. A taste like pennies filled my mouth. For a moment I thought my vision had shattered into glass shards.

“Tell me,” they whispered. “Tell me what it is.”

“It’s… fire inside a cage,” I rasped. “Like metal claws dragging through me. Like… like my blood turned to bees.”

They shuddered with a kind of hunger. “Blood turned to bees,” they repeated, writing furiously.

Something cracked inside me then. Between the burning of my skin and the trembling of my heart, I realized they were trembling too — not from pain but from anticipation, from their own strange excitement. And I began to see the thin seam of weakness: fear.

I woke to find a steel contraption standing in the center of the basement. It looked like a chair and a trap had been fused together: clamps for wrists and ankles, a collar brace, and a frame of steel rods.

“I built this for me,” they said quietly. “You’ll help me use it.”
My own terror rose up like bile. But some small hard core inside me whispered, This is your chance.

“If you want it to work,” I murmured, making my voice tremble but also low, hypnotic, “you have to let me set it up. You can’t know what’s coming or it won’t work.”
They hesitated, then nodded.

I tightened the straps across their arms, their legs, their chest. Every buckle was a drumbeat in my ears. They shuddered as control slipped from their hands. Their breath came quick, pupils dilated.

“You have to believe you can’t escape,” I whispered near their ear.

“Yes,” they breathed. “Yes. Show me.”

I clipped the battery wires to the metal pads at the armrests. Their muscles twitched under the clamps. A guttural sound escaped them — not pain but the first hint of genuine panic.

I could almost feel their terror radiating off them, electric, contagious. My own chest ached with adrenaline. I memorized their breathing, their expression. This is how they’ll break.

The next day they tried a different approach. No implements. No lights except a low, pulsing glow from a bulb strung somewhere behind me. They left me alone for what felt like hours.

Dripping pipes became a heartbeat. Shadows in the corners flexed and turned toward me like living things. I began to hear faint footsteps that weren’t there, a low voice humming words I couldn’t quite make out. My own voice whispered back without my consent.

I pressed my forehead against my knees and tried to remember the layout of my apartment, the taste of oranges, the texture of my cat’s fur. Each memory warped as soon as I called it up, turning into something grotesque.

When they returned, they stood silently, head tilted, studying me as if my hallucinations were as important as my flesh.

“You’re breaking,” they said softly. “Fear amplifies everything.”

“Yes,” I murmured hoarsely, realizing I could weaponize that truth.

By the eighth day, my sense of time had shredded. I measured it only by the sound of the pipes and the tremors of my own heart.

They brought back the ice water, the clamps, the battery, combining everything in rapid succession: cold so deep it burned, then heat, then electric shocks. My body reacted before my mind could; spasms, tears, animal sounds I barely recognized as mine.

But beneath the horror, I was learning. Learning their patterns. Learning how their breath changed when they were afraid. Learning how to speak in the tone that made them hesitate.

And a strange clarity came with that learning — a knowledge that if I could hold on a little longer, I could turn their hunger for understanding into their undoing.

When I woke, the green bulb flickered erratically, throwing knife-thin shadows across the cinder blocks. My throat felt sandpaper-raw from screaming the day before. On the floor near me lay a spiral notebook open to a fresh page. Their handwriting crawled across it, neat but frantic, filled with diagrams and phrases:
“PAIN = LIFE”
 “FIND THE EDGE”
 “SHE KNOWS MORE”

For a long time I stared at the words until they seemed to crawl like insects. The last line was underlined three times. She knows more. My stomach lurched — they had begun to believe in me as a kind of oracle.

They entered with a tray of syringes, their eyes bloodshot. “Tell me about hunger,” they murmured. “Tell me about deprivation.”

They had not eaten either. Their hands shook. They placed the syringes down, then held one up, examining the needle’s shine. I realized in a rush: their obsession was hollowing them out. If I could deepen their dependence on my words, I could pry the cracks wider.

I whispered: “If you want to understand deprivation…you have to give up something. Something you need.”

They hesitated, breath trembling. “What?”

“Sleep,” I murmured. “Close your eyes in the chair. I’ll record everything.”

They stared at me a long time, then at the syringes, then at the chair. Slowly, almost reverently, they sat.

I strapped them in again. The steel frame clanged faintly with each buckle. My fingers shook, but I masked it with clinical efficiency. They closed their eyes, trusting me. A tremor of triumph passed through me like static.

“You’ll feel nothing,” they whispered.

“You want to learn something,” I replied. “That means letting go.”

I clipped sensors to their skin — thin wires, a heart monitor I’d fashioned from scraps, anything to look real. Then, as they drifted in the edge of sleep, I whispered small things: “Your hands are heavy. Your breath slows. You are weaker than you think.”

They twitched. Their eyes flickered beneath lids.
I did not harm them yet. I only left them strapped, alone, as I backed away to a far corner. In that corner, hidden beneath a crate, I’d found a rusted screwdriver days before. I palmed it now, feeling the weight, the point. For the first time, the tool was in my hand.

They woke groggy. The green bulb had burned out sometime in the night, plunging everything into a dense amber glow from a backup lamp. Their voice was thin: “What did you see?”

“Everything,” I said. “You’re closer to the edge now.”

I handed them a cracked mirror I’d scavenged. “Look at yourself.”

They stared. Their pupils dilated, skin pale and damp with sweat. For the first time, I saw something like shame flicker across their features. They looked as if they’d aged ten years overnight.

“You need me,” I whispered. “You can’t understand pain alone. You’ll destroy yourself before you find it.”
They clutched the mirror. It slipped and cut their palm. Blood welled up, dark and slow. They stared at it, fascinated and horrified at once. “I…can’t feel it,” they murmured.

I leaned close: “But you’re bleeding. That’s the truth your nerves can’t hide.”

They shuddered. A tremor ran through their whole body. They were starting to doubt their invincibility — the one thing keeping them upright.

Food came less and less. Their hands shook when they tried to pour water. Their speech frayed, full of unfinished sentences. They had begun to smell sour, like someone fevered.

They still performed small torments — ice water, clamps — but they were half-hearted now, distracted. Each time they struck, their eyes darted to me as if asking permission.

That day I didn’t scream. I stared straight through them, whispering descriptions without being prompted: “Hot needles under my skin. Glass storm. Nerves screaming.” It unnerved them more than any cry.

“You’re not afraid,” they muttered
.
“I’m past fear,” I said. “But you’re not.”

Their hands trembled so badly the clamp slipped and snapped against their own thumb. They hissed, startled, as if the absence of pain now frightened them more than the idea of pain itself.

They slept strapped in the chair that night. I had done the straps so tight their hands tinged purple. While they snored shallowly, I crept around the basement, mapping every corner, every bolt. I found the fuse box, the breaker, the small window high on the wall crusted with grime.

I tested the screwdriver against the window frame. Metal squealed softly but didn’t break. Yet. I knew with time I could pry it loose.

I also knew time was running out. They were spiraling fast, and a spiraling captor could still kill me by accident. I would have to break free during one of their experiments, when their hands were full.

I returned to them and whispered at their ear, not loud enough to wake them: “You wanted to know pain. I’ll show you. I’ll make you feel everything.”

The day began with them trying to repeat the ice-and-shock experiment. Their motions were clumsy. The battery slipped from their grasp, clanged to the floor, sending a spark. They flinched like a spooked animal.

“Let me help,” I murmured. I steadied the wires, set the clamps, murmured clinical observations. They sagged with relief, as if my calmness anchored them.

Then, in a moment of distraction, I looped one of the wires around their wrist instead of mine. My heart hammered so loud I thought they could hear it.
“You’re trembling,” I said softly.

They looked at me, eyes wide. “Describe,” they whispered, but their voice cracked.
I closed the circuit.

For the first time, they jerked, face contorting in a grimace that was almost pain but not quite — more like terror, the body’s reflex without the nerve’s permission. They gasped. Their knees buckled.

“It’s…nothing…” they whispered. But their eyes said otherwise.

I leaned close. “This is what you wanted. This is how it begins.”

I turned up the current. Their arms convulsed, head snapping back against the brace. The sight filled me with a surge of something dark and clean — not joy, but release. My hands no longer shook.

“You feel it,” I hissed. “You feel it now.”

Their mouth worked soundlessly. They were trying to form words but could not. I reached for the screwdriver, hidden in my waistband, and pressed the point just above their collarbone.

“Your experiments are over,” I said.

They slumped in the chair like a puppet with the strings cut. The greenish light trembled on their sweat-slick face; their eyes were two black pools reflecting me back. For the first time since I’d been dragged into the basement, the air didn’t feel like a lid pressing down on me — it felt full of cracks.

“You’re nothing without control,” I whispered. “And you’ve lost it.”

They twitched, lips barely moving. “More…please…”

It wasn’t triumph I felt then but a bitter, metallic taste, like licking a battery. I realized this was my last chance; if I waited even another day, they might recover, or kill me in some erratic gesture. My fingers moved almost on their own, tightening the last strap across their chest until it creaked.

I pressed my palm against their sternum. The heart under my hand beat quick and hard, an animal trying to claw its way out. My own heart matched it. For a moment we were one trembling system, predator and prey trading places so quickly it became meaningless.
Then I pulled away.

The high window glowed faintly with sodium-orange light from outside. I climbed onto a crate, balancing on bare feet slippery with sweat. The screwdriver dug into my palm. Each squeal of metal as I worked the frame felt like a gunshot. My breath came in ragged bursts; my teeth chattered from adrenaline.

Below me the chair creaked. They stirred, but the straps held. Their voice, hoarse: “Where…going…”

I ignored it, wrenching harder. Rust flaked onto my arms, stinging like sparks. My wrists screamed from old restraints. A piece of the frame gave with a dry snap.
“Don’t leave,” they croaked. “You’re the only…one…”

The screwdriver slipped, skittering to the floor with a clank. I almost sobbed. I dropped back down, snatched it up, and returned to the window. My hands shook so badly I could barely fit the tip into the crack. My vision blurred with tears.

Finally, with a sound like a rib breaking, the frame popped free. Cold night air slapped my face, smelling of rain and diesel and something clean — the first clean smell in days. I wanted to bury my nose in it like a starving person finding food.

The opening was barely wider than my shoulders. Shards of glass jutted from the edges like teeth. I wrapped my hands in a filthy rag and hauled myself up. Every inch of my skin screamed as glass nicked me. My knees scraped the sill, opening new cuts. But compared to what had been done to me inside, the pain was clarifying, almost holy.

I was halfway out when a sound rose from below: a ragged, animal wail. They were thrashing against the straps now, head jerking like a fish. For the first time they were loud, truly loud — a voice stripped of language.

“Come back,” they howled. “Come back!”

I hauled myself through the last gap and tumbled onto gravel outside. I lay there on my back staring at the stars, my chest convulsing. The sky was huge and black and indifferent. The sodium light turned my tears into small coins on my cheeks.

My legs felt like brittle twigs but they moved. Gravel to asphalt, asphalt to an empty lot, lot to a chain-link fence. Each footstep was an explosion of nerve endings, but it was movement, and movement was freedom. I could feel the shape of my own body again, not as an object in a room but as something moving through space.

I didn’t look back. I didn’t have to; their cries bled out through the window and echoed across the lot like a dying animal. The sound pushed me faster.

I stumbled onto a street, half-lit by an old sodium lamp. A payphone stood there like an artifact from another era. I lunged for it, hands shaking so violently I almost dropped the receiver. The number for 911 came out of me as a sob.

“Help,” I croaked. “Basement. Kidnapper. Hurry…”

When the cruisers came, blue and red lights washing over the industrial yard, I crumpled at the edge of the lot. Their boots thudded around me, voices sharp and clipped. Hands guided me into a blanket, into the back of an ambulance. Someone asked my name. It took three tries to remember it.

I heard shouting from the basement. Then silence. Then radio chatter.

One officer returned, face pale. “There’s no one down there,” he said quietly to a colleague. “Just a chair bolted to the floor.”

Fluorescent lights again — but soft, clean, sterile. IV tubing snaked into my arm, dripping clear fluid. Nurses murmured. Someone swabbed my cuts. The antiseptic smell made me gag. Every time I closed my eyes I saw diagrams on butcher paper, needles gleaming under green light.

A psychiatrist sat by my bed. “You’re safe now,” she said gently. “You were very brave.”

I stared at her and thought: Brave? No. Just the rat that finally found a hole.
At night I lay awake listening to the beep of monitors. My body was healing but my mind kept replaying the chair, the voice, the humming.

A week later, back in my apartment, the nightmares had begun to shift. Sometimes in them I wasn’t the one strapped to the chair — I was the one doing the strapping, clinical and calm. I woke with my own hands clutching the sheets like restraints.

That morning an email arrived. No subject. No text. Just an attachment.

I clicked. It was a grainy photograph of my street taken from across the road. In the lower corner: a gloved hand holding a hypodermic needle, faintly gleaming. Under the image, a single line:

“I think I felt it this time. Thank you.”

I sat frozen, staring at the screen. The city outside went on as if nothing had changed. But inside me, the world tilted, and I realized the experiment wasn’t over — not for either of us.
