This will probably be my last update. Thank you for everyone who has followed my rambling thus far. I would love to continue - I have so many stories I could go on forever, it seems - but I'm getting clear signals that it's time to stop. 

I've lived on this land, in this house, all my life, and have never been victim to anything worse than colds and flu and tonsillitis whilst growing up, but since I started posting here my illnesses and mishaps have snowballed. I know there are logical explanations, but I'm tired, and I don't want to tempt fate - or the land and its residents - any more. And some things cannot be explained by a worn out immune system. 

I got hit by a falling branch a couple of weeks ago. It's been a windy start to spring, which is usual, but I was on my way between the barn and the house when a branch snapped from the old tree that has stood for decades and hit me in the shoulder. I spent a few days in hospital because of that. A dislocation rather than a break, luckily. 

No sooner was I home and venturing out again, a small sinkhole opened in the muddy driveway to the house whilst I walked up it and swallowed my foot up to the knee. I received a sprained ankle due to that misadventure and felt lucky for only that. 

Whilst I recovered in bed with my ankle elevated, the ceiling of my bedroom collapsed due to a leak, the materials of the attic above and the plaster of the ceiling only narrowly missing my head. 

I have been warned. And I will continue to be warned until the warnings aren't enough. But I'm risking this one last post because I feel like we all deserve closure.


I have always had theories about my home. Old gods, old spirits. The sentience of the land itself - the earth and the stones and the plants. A religion more ancient than Christianity, a religion without language or written history or even a name. All of these things together and more. But it wasn't until a few months ago that I started tying together some of my experiences with a possible explanation that is as wild as anything I've told you about. 

It occurred to me when I heard about the Skinwalker Ranch in Utah. I heard about it on a podcast. 

Hear me out. 

I would never claim Skinwalkers as part of our lore. They belong to the indigenous peoples of the US and I live on a small farm in the west of England.

But there were similarities between my land and the land the ranch is on. And the more I thought about it, the more a lot of things made sense. 

The ranch had cattle mutilation. There was  a weird beast that was like a huge wolf that haunted the land. There were reports of poltergeist activity. And of UFOs. 

We have seen strange lights in the sky here. Often. It's all part and parcel of living here and we have been known to set out chairs in the evenings to watch the sky show, to see the lights dart and dance and twirl in front of the stars. Sometimes they dip down low and seem like they may be about to touch the ground. They are as much a part of our lives as watching the bats that live in the eaves of the house do their twilight swoops in search of insects, casting stark and swift little shadows against the pale translucence of the dusk. We are insignificant to the bats, and to the lights in the sky. 

The lights were to be the last thing I told you about, and I am now fulfilling that promise to myself. 

If you revisit earlier parts of my story, you will find clues that I laid out for myself without realising it. Foreshadowing I wasn't aware of. 


The stones and their markings: I have done as much research as I can on the markings carved into the stones. They do not resemble any futhorc  runes I've seen, nor any of the celtic languages I've looked into. I even attempted to research Cornish, with little success. The markings are unique, from what I can tell, and I have no doubt they hold great power. 

The markings have a lot of circles. Runes are angular and comprised of straight lines. I do not know the language written on the stones, or who put it there. If it was humans who carved those designs, I wonder who or what dictated which ones to write. 

The Devil's Footprint: A large rough circle of burned earth that has been there since the history of our farm began, since any oral tales existed of it, before anything was written down. Nothing grows there, animals are upset by it. It's dangerous. 

I thought it might be a landing spot for a UFO once. A passing thought. But it's far too small, in reality, to be one singular thing. Though not long after that passing thought I wondered whether maybe the Print might be just one of many, that there might be a pattern of them across the countryside if one could find them. 

I have looked, I admit. I have walked for miles searching for others. I imagine a vast, circular structure with extending legs that settle on the ground for landing, and each leg burns a circle for eternity. 

If they are out there - and I'm starting to believe they are - they are miles apart. 

I tried to estimate the size of our Print. Of course it cannot be physically measured, but one can guess. I took those calculations to a sketchbook and tried to imagine a larger circle above it. I'm no mathematician, and I gave up before I could even make any ill-educated guesses, but before I did I had a little insight that made me put away the sketchbook forever. 

Imagine it, friends: imagine a craft with legs touching the ground, each creating a rough circular burn that never fades. Then imagine that you search for others and never hear any news of one nearby. 

I think that if there was such a thing, it had to have a minimum of three legs. A minimum. For it to be stable. There would probably be more, though. 

Imagine how vast it would have to be if you could travel for miles and not find the prints from the other legs, nor hear any stories of them. I wonder if there is anyone else out there who knows of such a mark, and where they are in the country. 

How big would the craft have to be? 

So big the mind cannot comprehend, I think. It would have blocked out the sun. 

I imagine the Shit Man seeing it. Seeing something so huge his primitive mind imploded. Something so significant it imprinted his existence onto the land forever. 

Then I imagined an invasive species taking over, stamping out his kind like grey squirrels have taken over native red squirrels in England. What a funny idea, that I might be an invasive species. I don't believe it at all, honestly. 


I have been thinking about the dream I had, the dream I told you of in the first part. 

I woke up outside, not knowing how I had got outside. The doors were locked and I was lying in the field by the Footprint. In the morning we saw that my face was burned on one side, as if by an almighty heat. 

Think about that, if you will, and draw your own conclusions. I have no memories that would be helpful other than the ones I've related. 

Then there is uncle Pete. 

Who knows what kind of magnetic energy the Print holds? Who knows whether the beings or being that put it there still have note of what happens there?

The beings could be ancient. That's a possibility. Eternal and immortal.

Or they could simply have a genetic memory that would tell them if someone interfered with the print - like a human shuddering when a goose walks over their grave. 

Ridiculous, I know. Maybe there is no sentience attached to the Print at all, and I'm delirious. I have the flu, did I say? I have a fever and my head hurts. But it all makes sense nevertheless. In its way. 

Maybe there is just a magnetic, physical memory that is part of the Print. Like nuclear waste, with a half life that spans millennia upon millennia, and anything that disturbs it is held forfeit automatically. No agency involved, just a natural part of something that is not of our nature. Something we will never understand, and nor should we. 

Uncle Pete could tell us, if he was still alive. I sometimes feel that he is still alive. That the thing we buried near the Print was a decoy, and that somewhere out there Pete is still stuck and screaming and screaming and screaming in some kind of limbo. A purgatory of silence and space that would drive us insane if we had one tiny glimpse into it. 

Whatever the reality, Pete is gone. Maybe he will come back again. I don't imagine he will be sane if he does. Maybe he will come back again and again. Maybe someone will have to put him out of his misery every time. Maybe there will, in centuries to come, be a dozen Petes buried near the Print. 

There is something else I wanted to talk about. It's hard to think right now. I believe it's about the copse? 

Remember how I went there and tried to peel the bark from a tree? 

The copse is the Shuck's hunting ground. My sweet boy. His home, maybe. The Shuck doesn't scare me but the copse does. I still recall the urgency to leave that I felt there. The energy that pulsed and surrounded me. An old god, I thought at one time. A slumbering thing - part beast, part human, all deity, waiting for its time to rise. Human feet disturb its sleep and I danced a tango on it that day. I bled the marrow sap from its bones and wrenched a portion of its carapace off for a dare. I should pay for that. It's only right. 

Maybe when the craft departed, it left something behind. Maybe that part is buried beneath the copse: A beating heart that has lain there for thousands of years, using the land as life support. That's where the energy of the land is centred. That's where I should go. 

I know it's late but I'm taking a shovel and going up the hill. I can see the Shuck's eyes shining way up there, a good boy waiting for scritches, and I can't deny him. I'm sure he wants me to dig. I think he will help. We will dig together. 

There are so many things I wanted to tell you. I never told you about the barn, and the haunted stall. I never told you about the fires. I never told you about my mother's doppelganger terrorising me at night, or my brother's doppelganger crawling on the floor for years after he left home, never speaking, close to the floorboards like a lizard. 

I have such stories. But I'm so tired. Maybe if I dig, I will feel stronger. There is something down there with an energy I might borrow, if I'm lucky, and can dig deep enough. 

Goodnight friends. Thank you for listening. Wish me luck. The Shuck is waiting. 

If I am allowed, I will report my findings back. But I don't think I will be allowed. 

It's cold outside, but I feel warm. That's nice.
