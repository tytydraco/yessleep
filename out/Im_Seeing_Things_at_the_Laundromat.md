I’m making this post right now because I need people to know about the experience that I had earlier this morning. I don't know what to believe or who to talk to, and I'm really scared.

My wife works early in the morning and usually goes to bed between 11 and midnight. I am in between jobs, currently unemployed, and studying for my real estate license exams.

In other words, I’m on my own schedule and therefore can afford to stay up til 5 in the morning and sleep in til noon if I want to. This usually ends up being the case.

I am a natural night owl, more than any person I know. Like I said, my wife normally goes to bed around midnight, after which I will proceed to stay up for several more hours on my own. Sometimes I’ll sit in bed and watch YouTube right next to her until I get tired, other times I’ll go into the living room of our small student apartment and watch a scary movie or something. She usually won’t want to watch those with me anyway, so this works out great.

The consequence of staying up until all hours and being the rabid horror fan I am is that I have become very paranoid. The lack of sleep, mixed with my often overactive imagination, has led me to be almost always looking over my shoulder. Ever since I was 10, I’ve had a sinking feeling that someone, somewhere is always out to get me.

My slight paranoia has often been the butt of thousands of jokes from my wife, friends, and family, but I don’t blame them. It can be something as harmless as a man sitting alone at a restaurant, and I will stare him down, just so he knows I’m onto him. When I think about it, it’s a pretty dumb and weird thing to do. But for me, it’s near instinctual.

No, I don’t blame their teasing at all. If you saw my behavior and appearance for yourself, it all adds up. I have a gaunt, wide-eyed expression at all times. When I walk home from campus alone at night, my head snaps to the side at the slightest noise like a trained hunting dog smelling for squirrels. I like to say that my guard is always up, but the truth is that I am irrationally terrified of the world.

One of the weirdest things I’ve started doing this last year is staring through the peephole of our front door for hours on end. It’ll be well past midnight, pitch black in our apartment, my wife in the next room, and I will just sit and watch. For what? I’m not sure. Intruders? Thieves maybe? We live in the cheapest student housing available, but still…someone could come by.

I’m telling you all these things about myself in hopes that someone can talk me down from the fear I feel regarding what I saw last night. I want someone to tell me that I’m crazy, that I’m imagining things, and that I should seek help.

The night before last, my wife and I were cleaning our apartment and needed to do some laundry, which I volunteered to do. The laundromat in our complex is close enough to walk to, but if the weather is ever bad enough, you could justify taking a car.

Sometime in the afternoon, I walked to the laundromat, put our clothes in the wash, and later moved them to the dryer. I came and went that afternoon, spent the last of our laundry quarters, and everything was fine.

We had friends over that night, and they didn’t leave until just before midnight. The night passed like any other, as did the next day.

Every night, when my wife goes to bed early (at least by my standards), I usually like to sit in bed with her and talk or cuddle as she drifts off to sleep. On this particular night, being the responsible one in our marriage, she reminded me that we had forgotten to get the clothes out of the dryer. 

She asked if I could go get them, and pointed out that by this point, our clothes had been sitting in the dryer for almost 2 days. I protested at first, saying it was too late now, and that I’d get them tomorrow.

Now here’s the thing, I’m a paranoid scaredy cat, I can admit it, but our laundromat would be considered creepy by anyone. It’s got this eerie green lighting, the road outside has a streetlight that flickers in the dark, and there’s something weird with the doors that seems to block out all outside noise, creating a creepy, dead silence.

My wife asked me again nicely, pointing out that I would be up anyway, and that she didn’t want to risk our clothes getting set in lost and found.

I agreed with her good points and relented. I would head over later that night.

For the next few hours, I wrestled with myself and my fear about leaving.  On one side, I was creeped out, but on the other, we did need to get our clothes. We needed to get them soon, but my cowardice was winning me over.

It wasn’t until 4:45 AM that I finally got myself to leave the apartment. I stepped outside and was immediately hit with a chill. It had been raining for the last few hours.

The smell of rain and pavement perfumed my nostrils as I made my way to my dew-dropped car, and I pulled out of the parking lot, saying “Let’s get this over with” to myself.

As I said, the laundromat is close enough to walk, but no way in hell I wasn’t taking the car. I got there in literally 45 seconds.

The laundromat was exactly as I described it earlier, eerily bright and quiet. It looked like a hospital room scene in a haunted attraction.

I quickly made my way over to the dryer machine that I had put our clothes in the night before, quickly and frantically throwing it all into our laundry bag. The laundromat was unnaturally warm for an empty building at 4 AM, and I wasn’t planning on being there any longer than I had to.



Then I heard something that I will never forget.



I heard a scratchy, vile, high-pitched voice call out, “He….Hellllllloooooooooooooooo?”

My blood turned to ice at the sound of it. Every hair stood on end, my fists instinctively curled into fists. It sounded like a sick person.

The voice was coming from the other side of the wall, where the washing machines were, and so I couldn’t see how close it was or what it even was.

The voice let out two distinct, low groaning sounds that sounded like an old vacuum cleaner, and then continued.



“Are you as filthy as me?” the voice then dipped from high to low.



“Are you?” It wasn’t low like Darth Vader. It sounded like a kid trying to do a low voice, like they were doing it in a mocking way.



I cannot put into words how horrible this voice was. I could grow to be a 90-year-old man and still have nightmares about it. It was unlike any person or animal I had ever heard.

All I could do was toss the rest of our crap into the laundry bag and pray that whatever the hell was making that voice was on the phone with someone or maybe pulling a prank.

I didn’t bother shutting the dryer door, and I didn’t run either. The thought of laying eyes on whatever was making that voice felt as unbearable as hell itself, but I had to try. I gripped my keys in between my fingers, trying to create makeshift brass knuckles.

I quickly spedwalked out from behind the wall, bracing myself for some kind of horrible confrontation. But there was nothing there. Literally nothing and nobody. I let out a sharp exhale of relief, nearly crying in the process. I didn’t know what had made those noises, if I had imagined it or not, and I didn’t want to find out. I quickly walked out of the building and started my car.

As I started my car, I looked up and saw, quite possibly, the worst sight I will ever see in my life.

In the large window of the laundromat, I saw a terrible, evil thing. It was a man, I suppose, but I had never seen a man like this. It had wild blonde-ish hair that was matted, pokey, and greasy. I could only see it from the shoulders up, but it was awfully bony and thin. It had eyes like a rat, that stared into my soul and made me feel unsafe. It wore a hospital gown that, to my surprise, was clean and nearly spotless from what I briefly saw.

Worst of all, though, were its lips. They looked blistered and cracked, and stained red. They weren’t bold red like a clown, but rather faded red like dried blood.

It just stared at me with some kind of unnatural, bored smile. It’s small black eyes digging into my very being. It had both of its scrawny hands placed on its hollow cheeks, and was stretching its face at me, pulling its skin tight, bearing its teeth and causing its little eyes to squint. It looked like something out of the worst of my nightmares.

Then, without warning, it started running. It took a sharp right and started running down the hallway toward the exit where I was parked. I could see it sprinting through the windows at breakneck speed.. 

Panicking, I attempted to jam my keys into the ignition but wound up dropping them, of course. Like my life depended on it, I quickly bent down to grab them off the car floor, my breath picking up speed like a train. 

I sat back up, and the thing was right outside my window, pressed against the glass of my door. It was still pulling at its face, making the most horrible expression. Its fingernails were yellow and infected. The skin around its neck was covered in little boils and tiny dark holes. Its teeth copper colored, and its gums rotten and frothy.



Worst of all however,



It was me. 



This thing, its face….it was MY face. It was…like a twisted version of my reflection staring back at me. Its eyes still black and tiny, its face still stretched, but it was me. It even had the same triangle-shaped birthmark that I have over my left eyebrow.

I screamed as the thing headbutted by car window, shattering it and getting glass all over me. I screamed and screamed with tears in my eyes as I quickly reversed the car, putting a few feet of space between me and the thing.

While I was putting it in drive, the creature stared at me with a face that both was and wasn’t mine, now with blood and glass shards all over it, sticking out of its skin from my window. It just sat and stared… its untainted hospital gown fluttering in the early morning wind.

I stepped on the gas and got the hell out of there. I swear I almost had a damn panic attack and crashed the car.

I must’ve driven around town for 45 minutes before I headed back for home. I quickly parked the car and ran into our apartment. It was just under 6 AM, and the sun was beginning to peak over the horizon. I closed and locked the front door and fell to my knees. I wanted to cry, or throw up, or both. Looking back, I might’ve been in shock, but I’m not exactly sure what I was feeling even at the point of me writing this. 

I sat on the couch, caught my breath, and cried a little before eventually falling asleep. My wife woke me up for a goodbye kiss before she went to work, and to ask me why I had slept on the couch. At this point, I was running on about 3 hours of sleep, and so my answer was pretty much gibberish, but I lied and said it was too hot in our room.

The events that had happened only a few hours earlier came flooding back to me in my sleep-deprived delirium, and my heart started to beat at rabbit speed again.

What was at the laundromat last night?

Did I imagine all of that?

Was it a result of sleep deprivation and paranoia?

Is there someone dangerous hiding out in our complex?

Should I tell someone?

Who would believe me?

Am I safe?

Why did it look like me?



I don’t know what to do. Should I talk to the police or at least campus security? I know I’ll sound insane if I share too many details.

Should I start talking to a therapist? Would a therapist believe me?

Should I tell my wife? Would she even believe me?

I’m not sure if I believe me.

I’m more stressed than I’ve ever been, but there’s one thing I do know for sure: After she left for work, I heard my wife walk past where I had parked my car and say, “What the hell!?”
