I am only number 0429.
I have no name.
I have no surname.
I reject any kind of individualization within society.
I am only part of the hive, and the hive takes care of me.

I renounce any past that existed before I came here.
Only by becoming 0429 was I able to be reborn.

Whether this is a prison, a cult, or the grace of God depends solely on you.
For me—this is home.

For the first time, I am something more than the information on my birth certificate, which I burned together with a badger’s tail at fifteen. We do not hoard trash. We give ourselves to nature, which in truth is nothing more than four concrete walls.

In one of them, there’s a hole.
No. 3512, my esteemed roommate, believing that Jesus Christ appeared to him on a fine December 15th, began wailing and smashing his head against the wall, with every strike becoming more possessed.
A shame, really, that he woke me up and I had to calm him down. Duty, after all.
To this day I wonder how it would have ended. Perhaps he would have been left not only without a tongue, but also without his mind.

There is still dried blood in the hole. At least some sort of decoration for this dull room.
Waking up with the smell of iron was the only thing I was missing, but even that scent is fading.
Sniffing blood is no longer enough—I must taste it. Taste it and savor it.
But the flavor, too, is fading.

All that’s left is to look at the sleeping No. 3512 and fantasize about what he could do to himself, just to indulge me again with such sensations.
As a believing number, he could sacrifice himself for the greater good…

On the second concrete wall, there is a portrait of my Father, carved by me when my daily ration was changed.
Though the features are not detailed—just the outline of a silhouette—yet it is you.
Father, I hope you are proud of me.
It is only because of you that I am here.
Only you taught me how to handle people and made me feel powerful.

But you were just as much a corrupt pig as we are—though at least we admit it, and that makes us better.
You called me insane, a half-wit, yet I was the only one honest with myself and those around me.
I never pretended to be what I am not, but you, hiding behind a policeman’s warrant, stood side by side with Lucifer.

Loving you out of duty, out of your “father” title, was the hardest trial of my life.

On the third concrete wall, there hangs a hook.
Perhaps someday I will hang a noose on it.
Perhaps someday I will even use it.
But not yet.

The fourth concrete wall deserves an entire book.
The fourth wall is my temple.
You are not always worthy of looking at it.
Only when fully devoted and pure may you turn.
Turn, and kneel on bare knees.
