It started when I received an email in my gmail account from academia.edu website asking me if I'm the one who wrote some papers about some researchers there, I freaked out and went to check the security in my email.

I found out a device that I don't knowØŒ it called "SM-G991B" .. I was shocked and terrified, I made it log out and changed my password and improved my security immediately.. but it still log in and I didn't know what I should do, changed my password again and everything I can do but it still log in.. it was there since last July in 2024, someone was watching me all this time and I don't know anything at all?

I started to check out my activities in my Google account to see if there's any strange activitys but there was none, how I suppose to fix that shit? It was after midnight when it started and I kept awake until 6-7 am trying to solve it, I had a thought about deleting my account and start over again but hey, this strange device was there for months so he probably know everything about me and how to reach me, have my photos, my connections etc .. so what's the point of all this? He is even in my country and so close from where I live

I tried to know how he got there, if there's any activities I made back then and made him hack me.. but I didn't do a damn thing! How he got me then?

I gave up and went to sleep, he knows all my data anyways

When I wake up, I wished if it was a nightmare dream like any nightmare dreams but it wasn't

I started to search again in a different way to get the bottom of this, I wondered what this guy is doing by watching me without doing anything strange at all? And why he didn't blackmail me?

I searched in reddit and I found out this funny thing, it was me all this time!

"SM-G991B" is the model number that refers to my phone "Samsung Galaxy S21" and somehow it looks like a different device is loging into my account .. how I didn't found out this sooner?

And for the academia.edu thing, I found out that I signed in there because I was looking for "Veronica decided do die" pdf novel to download it, and I found this website when I was looking in the past

I visited this website and somehow I got mentioned by my name 1085 times in a psychology papers uploaded to the Academia, it happened with many people who signed in there.. this website is trying to make me pay money to see those papers lol

This situation made me feel insecure and experiencing the feeling of being hacked without knowing what should I do while the hacker is having my data already and he can blackmail and manipulating me anytime as he like

What a day, now I can relax and go to finish the last 3 episodes of better call saul!
