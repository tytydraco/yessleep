Joe had been listless for months, grieving. Yet, quite suddenly, he gained a passion for fossil hunting. I could kind of see the draw. Ancient relics, attainable to an amateur if only they could spot them.   
I loved him too much not to intervene when his low mood refused to resolve, so I booked an autumn getaway to a quaint fishing town on the south coast of England. The place wasn’t far from Bristol, where we are PhD students at the university.  
Waves crashed. “Should we head back?” I asked him.  
Joe sank to his haunches and examined an egg-shaped pebble. In his glance, sharp and hot, was a hint of irritation. He took off his glasses and wiped the lenses on his woollen jumper.  
“I haven’t found one yet. I want to find one.”  
“Ok, babe.”  
I headed back over the hummock at the east of town and unlocked the door to the avant-garde apartment we’d rented. A bunch of agglomerated shipping containers, the place was quirky, and offered sweeping views of the sea through a glass sliding door. I poured a glass of red wine. Sitting up close to the glass and facing the water made you feel like you were at the bow of a ship. Beyond that point, only ocean and open air lay.   
My mind drifted back to the beach. God, it was good to see him angry! Anger was better than absence. Like warm blood returning to cold fingertips, the numbness was being replaced by feeling. He was healing.   
The next morning, Joe was full of enthusiasm.  
“It’s mystical, almost. I roam around until I find a likely collection of rocks that look like the sea has delivered them up onto the shore overnight. It’s doubtful another living soul has ever seen them. Only fish. Anyway, I put the rocks in a sort of frame within my vision and pick a few that are worth inspecting closer. Here is where you need the eye for it. Avoid the obvious ones. Smooth ones don’t seem to be any good. It’s the ones poking out timidly that I’m interested in. They don’t appeal to one’s fingertips, and you might only get sand under your nails for the trouble, but those rocks are the ones I want.”  
“Did you find anything?”  
“No. But I will.”  
Despite my half-hearted protests, he went back down to the fossil beach. Feet up, I leafed through the local newspaper. I wanted what was best for him, ultimately.  
Descending over the hummock in the grey mid afternoon, I found Joe close to the tideline digging like a dog.  
“Hey, what’s going on, babe? Did you find something?”  
I looked into the pit he had made and saw his hands were bloody and muddied. Sticking up from the bottom was a long, rectangular slab of black stone.  
“Help me get it before the water does!”  
He kept digging, and I was able to free it. Inscribed upon the surface was a laser-straight line of glyphs. It was dense and I’m not strong, so it was a battle to get a good hold. Chipping a nail, I dragged it to the lip of the pit.  
“What the-?”  
“What is this thing?”  
“No, over there.”  
Further along the shore was a body convulsing in the shallow, foamy water. Flesh maggot-white. We stared. The stone tablet fell back into the pit and we wandered over to the body.  
“Don’t touch.” I said.  
The episode was ending. It was a naked and hairless man who lay at our feet.   
“What should we do?”  
“Call an ambulance.”  
First responders took the man up the beach and into the back of an ambulance. They swaddled him in a foil insulation robe. He was conscious now. Mute, but conscious. Eyes hollow in his skull, he watched. The emotion discernable on his angular face was bafflement mixed with a peculiar anger. Whatever his story, he’d escaped death by a razor thin margin. Where was the elation? The joy? Too soon for that?  
The ambulance pulled away, and we stood in silence.   
“Well.” Joe said, and I sighed heavily. The sun was setting, so we headed back to the apartment.  
“Oh! What about the tablet? The stone tablet?”  
“You dropped it. It’s under five feet of water now, we’ll have to come back for it tomorrow.”  
Sleep didn’t come easy for either of us. When Joe finally drifted off, he tossed and turned like a madman. I got four hours at most. I was dozing into the late morning when someone knocked on the door. Joe answered.   
“Hello.”  
“Hi, are you Joseph Leeper?”  
“I am indeed. I hope I’m not under arrest.”  
A woman laughed softly. “No, I’m here about an incident that took place yesterday on the beach. A man was found and relocated to a care unit. You found him, didn’t you?”  
“Yes, it was quite a shock for us.”  
“I bet it was. Well, he’s requested your presence, if you’re up for it. Says he has something for you.”  
We drove to the care unit on the edge of town and were shown into a small ward. Sat up in bed was the man. He wore a pale blue hospital gown and, astonishingly, had a thin layer of dark hair where none had been yesterday. His face was healthy and flushed, and veins bulged in the arms he held out to us.   
“Friends, saviours, here they are!” He said in a rich, sonorous voice. Dark eyes swept between myself, Joe, me, Joe again. The gaze was wolfish and perversely amused.  
“Nice to see you’re well.” Joe said.  
“Yes, but still a way to go before I’m fully recovered. I’ve got you to thank for the privilege of being *able* to make a recovery, though. It feels like I’ve been reborn. Like I’ve been given another chance.”  
“It was no trouble, really.”  
A brief silence drew out.  
“I suppose the officer said I had something for you. This is yours, isn’t it?”  
From beneath his bed covers, the man produced the black stone tablet I’d hauled from beneath the sand. It had been so opposed to my grip, yet danced along this man’s fingertips.  
Several colleagues of the policewoman had joined her at the back of the room. They all gasped at the trick.   
“How did you get that?” I asked.   
“Or did you find it? Nameless partner of Mr Leeper?”   
“How do you know his name?”  
“You said it yesterday.”  
“Not his surname.”  
“Maybe my recollection of events is different from yours. See, I was also confident you were going to hand this object over to the authorities when you found it. Did you?”  
“You weren’t there at that point.”  
“Wasn’t I?”  
“No.”  
“You’re being very evasive.”  
“The water swallowed it up.”  
“And was your homework eaten by a canine?”  
I had an urge to hit him, but a burly man full of bluster walked in.   
“Mayor! These are the two I was telling you about. Don’t take my word for it, I humbly defer to the good officers over there on the matter, but if I may be so bold, it seems what I feared is true. Interlopers. The two of them. City folk who came here and sought to steal away an artefact that rightfully belongs to your fine town. It’s always the same old story for the little places, isn’t it? All the notoriety and recognition stripped away and plundered. They were going to take it away from you, and I don’t detect any remorse on their behalf. Do you? What if once, just once, something magnificent grew from a place like this? Your townsfolk are smart people. What would they think of these two here, and their heinous behaviour?”  
The Mayor regarded us with distaste. “I’ll confer with the officers.” He said, and they spoke in hushed tones in the corner of the room. When they broke apart, the Mayor held his hands aloft in a conciliatory manner.   
“To save any further dispute, I think it would be best if the two of you left town. Neither party at fault.”  
Joe was bewildered. I put my hand on the small of his back as a retort was building in his throat.  
“Don’t worry, babe. We’ll go.”  
As we left, I saw the bedridden man draw the Mayor close and whisper in his ear.  
The Mayor responded. “I agree. I’m sure the newspapers will care a great deal about this. And yes, I’ll get in touch with the parliamentary representative. I was going to wait, but this has hastened things somewhat, I think.”  
Joe has returned to grief. Lost in labyrinthine apathy. I dream of pyramids beneath the ocean snared by huge tentacles and wrought slowly down to dust. I think of little else.
