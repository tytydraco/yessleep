Growing up, I attended what I thought was a charismatic church that, in hindsight, I realize was an apocalyptic cult. They had a lot of strange rituals and customs, but none more important than “speaking in tongues.” The church believed that if one prayed and begged hard enough—and if they were worthy—they would be able to speak in the language of Heaven, and by doing so, it would be a sign of a divine presence residing inside of you. And that once you had this gift, you would be raptured and spared from the coming Apocalypse on Earth and the eternal torment of the afterlife. If you hadn’t yet spoken in tongues, you wouldn’t go to Heaven when the Rapture—the moment when the saved ascended to Heaven—occurred. You’d be left on Earth to experience the Apocalypse, and when you died, you’d burn in Hell for eternity. That’s… a lot for a kid to process.

The way to get this gift of the Spirit was to go up to the front of the church during the altar call, which happened toward the end of every service, right after the collection plate was passed. The congregation, traumatized by the pastor’s frequent and vivid descriptions of the eternal torment awaiting the unsaved, would gather around the altar, praying for the gift of tongues for themselves or members of the church who hadn’t yet received it. Those who didn’t have it were instructed to pray, praise God, and beg for the gift. We’d do this regularly, desperately, and the altar calls could last for hours.

Imagine it: children and adults all crowded around the red-carpeted steps of the altar, screaming, spraying saliva, sobbing, praying, sweating, and placing their hands on each other—all pleading for this gift, genuinely expecting the Rapture to happen at any moment. Honestly, I spent most of my childhood and early teens trying to receive this elusive gift. I spent countless hours at the altar begging and pleading with God to grant me the one thing that would save me from Hell. Night after night, surrounded by screaming adults, I begged God until my voice was raw.

To add insult to injury, it seemed like at every altar call, someone around me received the gift, to my left or to my right, someone would begin babbling incoherently, collapse to the ground, and then be helped up to their feet by a celebrating congregation. But despite all my efforts and sincerity, each night it was denied to me.

Eventually, the crowd around the altar would disperse. Late at night, often around midnight, the service would finally end, and we’d go home. I’d spend the drive back staring out the car window at the night sky, my clothes damp with sweat, and my throat sore from pleading with a God who refused to answer.

Growing up, the fear of Hell, the Apocalypse, and eternal damnation was a real force in my life. I can remember times when my mom came home late from work, and I was convinced she’d been raptured, leaving me behind. I’d hide in my closet, clutching some sort of improvised weapon—a broom, a steak knife, etc.—certain that the damned would soon kick in the front door. For what purpose? Maybe to eat me or sacrifice me to Satan? I wasn’t sure what the damned did, but I knew it couldn’t be good. All this made for an interesting, high-anxiety, and, at times, sleep-deprived childhood.

When I was around 16, the pastor started preaching that the Rapture was particularly imminent. We began having service every night about the coming Apocalypse, and the importance of speaking in tongues for the unsaved. The pastor warned that Hell would be infinitely worse for people like me who knew the truth but hadn’t accepted the gift. This was especially frustrating for me: I was trying so hard!

After the collection plate was passed, we had the inevitable altar call, and at each of them I tried harder and harder to speak in tongues. But it still wasn’t happening. I started to think maybe I was immune or something. Finally, after an especially long altar call, the pastor took me aside and told me, in a voice filled with compassion, concern, and perhaps a hint of exasperation, that if I just repeated the word “hallelujah” over and over again, God could use it as a foothold to enter my heart and grant me the gift.

At the next altar call, I gave it a try. I knelt at the altar, shouting “hallelujah” over and over again. I was helped by an older man in the church who often mentored and prayed with the young boys, either one-on-one at his house, which he preferred, or at the altar. He considered this his “calling.” This oddly overly affectionate man, a self-proclaimed “prayer warrior,” whispered words of encouragement in my ear as he knelt behind me, rubbing his hands tenderly across my sweating back and shoulders.

“Hallelujah!” I shouted, again and again. My arms waved, my body swayed, and my knees ached. My throat was raw, and my voice was fading. The words began to run together, syllables dropping and merging. This only excited the people around me, especially the man behind me.

“Hallelujah! Hallelujah!” I kept shouting, faster and faster. Exhausted, the words blurred into nonsense. Around me, the church members screamed and prayed with ecstatic fervor. The pastor, now kneeling in front of me, tangled her fingers in my hair with one hand, grabbed my chin with the other, and brought her fleshy face close to mine, pressing her puckered lips against my ear.

“No, say it like this,” she whispered, her breath hot, moist, and intrusive. And then she began repeating the word hallelujah, improvising like a jazz musician creating her own excited babble of syllables to accompany mine.

Behind me, the man prayed harder, his breath hot on my neck, his body pressed close to mine. His hands moved roughly over my shoulders and back. He whispered in my ear, urging me to pray harder, harder, to let it inside me.

“Hallelujah! Hallelujah!” I tried to keep shouting, but my voice faltered, my words turning to mush. The crowd erupted in a frenzy of excitement.

The word blurred, lost its meaning, became a nonsensical noise. My throat burned, my body trembled, the pastor kept whispering in my ear, but her voice seemed to change. The word she kept repeating was now unrecognizable, the first syllable a percussive exhalation, the second a wheezing gasp, the third obscenely stretched out, the last almost a cry of pain. Her wet lips squirmed against my ear like worms, I felt her tongue in my ear, her voice in my head, and suddenly something… shifted.

The air grew thick and cold. The sounds around me suddenly muffled and distant. I felt like I was submerged in dark water. A strange presence loomed all around me—no, inside me—a watching, waiting… something. I felt a million miles away, and a coldness crept into my chest, an internal ocean of black water teeming with something dark and squirming, rising up my throat and bursting out of my mouth. It hurt. I started screaming. We all seemed to be screaming in unison, and the lights were flickering, and suddenly I was being helped to my feet. I had apparently blacked out, collapsing face forward onto the steps of the altar. It wasn’t an unusual occurrence at the church; they called it being slain by the Spirit. I had rug burns on my forehead for weeks.

Still, as I came to, all around me, everyone was ecstatic. “You’ve got it!” someone shouted, their hands gripping my arms and shoulders. Everyone was happy. I was being congratulated, showered with love, and in the middle of it all, someone—I don’t know who—whispered in my ear, “It’s inside you now,” and I felt a strange chill.

I knew I should be happy. I tried to convince myself I was, but I felt different. Hollowed out. Violated in a way I couldn’t quite grasp or articulate.

Later, before the service ended, the pastor asked me to come up to the pulpit to make an announcement. Numb, exhausted, and uncertain, I walked up. As I neared the pulpit, I glanced at the pastor. Our eyes met, and I still remember her expression. Though she smiled, her face seemed smug and sly, as though the two of us were co-conspirators. She nodded toward the pulpit, silently encouraging me to play along.

I stepped up and looked out at the congregation—the only friends and community I had ever known. Their upturned faces were expectant, like children waiting for a story. I made my choice.

“I spoke in tongues!” I said into the microphone. My voice was raw, and my throat was sore, but the declaration boomed around the church with a confidence I didn’t feel. The congregation erupted in applause and shouts of “Amen!” and “Praise the Lord!” Their words blended into an indecipherable babble that sounded like tongues. Hallelujah.

But I wasn’t exactly sure what it was that I’d done. I wasn’t sure what I’d let in.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. My room felt suffocating, the air thick with something unseen, some new and terrible thing inside of me and around me. I lay awake, replaying the altar scene in my mind: the man’s hands, the pastor’s smile, the cold presence that had seemingly entered me, the feeling of something inside of me boiling over, the pain, and the beginning of a scream.

And then, I heard it.

A whisper, faint and guttural, from my own mouth, but it wasn’t me speaking. It wasn’t my voice. It wasn’t English or the word hallelujah. It was something older, darker, like the sound of something massive choking up something vile, but I could understand it. “Not now,” it said, from my own mouth. “Not now, but soon.”

I froze, my body paralyzed as the words seemed to echo in the room and my mind. And then, just as suddenly, the voice, the feeling, was gone.

I refused to go back to the church after that. Rejecting the faith of my family at such a young age tore my life apart, but I survived. I grew up. And over the following decades, I found peace, love, and my place in the wider world.

Or I thought I had. But last night, as I was washing dishes, I started to gag, cough, and gasp for air, and I felt it again—rising up, the voice that wasn’t a voice, the words that weren’t words in any human language. They burned and tore at my chest and throat and spilled out into the empty air around me. “Really soon now,” it said through me—with undisguised glee.

The plate shattered in my hand, cutting deep into my palm. Cold dread rushed through me and then, somehow, beyond me. Standing at my sink in my empty house, with blood welling up in my cupped palm, I realized I wasn’t alone with the voice or the pain—not really.

I could feel them.

The connection snapped into place, somehow simultaneously stabbing and tearing at me, a pain sharp, dull, and overwhelming, like a clawed finger pushing into the center of my mind—slicing, stretching, and flipping a switch.

I knew all of them, the others—the ones who’d been there at the church when I was a boy. Their thoughts, their faces, their secrets, loves, and fears flooded my mind. They were scattered across the world. Most had moved on, healed, and built new lives just like me, but I knew at that moment—we all knew—that we were still marked and connected by the same terrible fate and bond.

The voice was in them too, rising up. Burning. Tearing at us all.

I could feel their fear, confusion, pain—mirroring my own—and a growing understanding of what was coming. A terrible, all-consuming compulsion building inside me, in all of us. Pressing, urgent, and impossible to resist any longer. For death, destruction, chaos, glorious purpose, and Hell on Earth.

The voice was rising up again, preparing to speak. In agony, I clawed at my face and throat, tearing at my collar in desperation, unintentionally smearing blood from my cut hand across my face, mouth, and neck. Blood—red, hot, salty, and so beautiful. On its own, my tongue lashed out, impossibly long, flailing wildly at the air, lapping at the blood around my mouth and in my palm. It was unexpectedly delicious, sparking an explosion of pleasure in my injured hand, groin, chest, and head. A pleasure somehow shared with all the others—rapturous in its mounting intensity. Heavenly.

“It’s almost time,” we all choked and gagged out in gleeful unison and hellish chorus, followed by horrible, wet sounds that burned in our chests, tore at our throats, and burst out of our mouths—inhuman, monstrous, utterly insane sounds that we all recognized as laughter.
