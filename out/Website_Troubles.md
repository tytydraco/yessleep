Hi friends! I was wondering if someone maybe had some input on some funky stuff that seems to be happening?

	So, I’ve recently started trying to pick up some basic coding because I wanted a place to put my art and personal thoughts and stuff, and I figured that I could just make a little website for myself, you know? I’ve seen a lot of personal websites so I thought I’d make my own! I didn’t really know that it would be as hard as it is… I mean- I know that coding is difficult, but I didn’t know that it would be soooo hard. 

	So! Long rambling story… long because I have no idea how to keep my ramblings brief; I managed to get the site up and working! My personal little nest online! I’ve added some little games, a guestbook, my art and poetry, you know- the works! but I’ve noticed some weird annoying little bugs recently?

So basically, sometimes the website changes stuff? (and please keep in mind that I have no idea about the advanced or specifics of coding- so really I have no idea what is actually going on) but like as an example; I keep noticing that some of the buttons or text boxes around the site are the wrong color. I have no idea if I’ve accidentally classed them as a different thing without realizing or if somewhere in my css I’ve mixed up a hex code, or if the site is just like- playing tricks? but it’s kind of annoying. 

Sometimes I think the colors shift slowly. So slowly that you don’t actually notice until I refresh the page or look back at my computer after going to the bathroom or something. Or I’ll see little flickers and glitches around my screen when I’m spaced out, but when I try to pay really close attention to catch them, I just can’t see anything at all. I don't know… Sometimes I swear some things are just kind of sideways. 

I try to keep in mind that my head isn’t the most reliable thing ever. I know that sometimes I see or hear weird things when I’m super super tired, and sometimes my medication sort of makes my dreams bleed into my eyes, so really it could just be me.

But the weirdest thing happened a few weeks ago. So, I spend a lot of time flitting back and forth between projects, but I had been focusing on the site almost exclusively for a while. I went to bed (a rare feat for me hehe) and when I woke up the entire site was different! Colors were changed, links were broken, pages were missing, art pieces had been altered- everything was just completely off. 

The worst of it was the color scheme. I really like my soft gentle colors! Purple and teal and a little bit of pink or yellow, but when I woke up the entire site was… well, I don’t wanna say garish cause it feels mean, but it feels like the best descriptor. Neon green, neon pink, neon cyan, black. Colors that were probably brighter than the sun itself. Not to say that I have anything against the color palette or anyone who likes it! It was just… a lot for me and a lot for my nest. 

I also noticed that some of the text was directly altered. Like- not obviously so, but some of my journal posts had words changed. Not really something I would have noticed if I didn’t curse. But I don’t. So I definitely noticed when some of my journal entries were littered with aggressive and harsh language. (I fixed those first)

I had to spend HOURS of work trying to get the site back to the way that it was before I went to bed. I was wondering if anyone knows what could have happened? Could it have been a virus of some kind? Maybe something I misclicked while sleep-deprived before logging off? Was it because I forgot to back up my site or something? 

So if anyone has any ideas, that would be amazing! You could try and check it out? Maybe see what’s going on? Besides, even if you don’t find anything, my nest always feels a little bigger when it’s shared.
