I was told by friends and family that by sharing a bit of my experience might help me get over it. My husband took her away and then himself too.

I need to give some background. We had moved into my grandparents home after they passed. It's been in my family for generations. It was old and had its quirks but I loved it all the same. We moved here a little before the birth of our daughter, so around 7 years.

My husband had been stressed about work for a while, and then he started going to the basement a lot. After hearing he wanted to try wood working, it made sense, he was planning out the space. I thought everything was fine! He was exploring hobbies, building furniture, making little knick-knacks for our daughter. How did it end so twisted?

I don't want to go in too much detail, it still pains me. But I found them there, well after midnight. My baby girl shoved into that damned crack in the foundation. My husband kneeling before it with blood leaking from ears and eyes. Later found out that he was missing an eye. The officers couldn't find it and the follow-up from the coroner said the same. Beside my husband, the following was written using one of those big carpenter pencils and nearing the end, changed to blood as his strength was leaving him. It's ingrained in my mind. I want it to leave.


What was written:

There is a crack in my basement
Right there on the wall
I can see an eye staring from the cement
That is glazed and dull

I visit again at night 
To see the crack has grown
I don't think that it's alright
More is visible. Does it want to be known?

Can I tell my wife and kid?
Should I deal with it myself?
Is it their lives that I bid?
To God I pray, knelt

When it storms, the crack moans
The eye twisted in pain
Once the storm is over and gone
I'll fix it before I go insane

Down to the hardware store
To get cement and spackle
Much later after the pour
It still in my mind like shackles

I wake at night before the wall
How did I arrive here?
Did I sleepwalk? I think in a lull
Must be nothing, no thought or fear

Night after night, I repeat
My wife asks "Trouble sleeping?"
I can't tell her about the wall I meet
"It's just work," my heart bleeding

The next rain leads to a mix of sounds
A blend of moans and thunder
This crack and I are destined and bound
Covering the crack was a major blunder

I must free the eye
And they must not know
To my family I will lie
Take the tools down below

Woodworking as a hobby
They won't know from the sounds
What a great cover story
As I free my crack from the ground

My wife's ancestral home
With its foundations thick
Now you can smell the loam
As I removed chunks, brick by brick

I can see it in the darkness
The glow on the cataract 
It gives me such bliss
Now to expand the crack

More can be seen through the crack
A wall of pale flesh
Many orifices revealed with a wet smack
Fluid leaking in excess

I must show my daughter
My wife won't understand this
It's late and she is tired
To her nothing is amiss

I bring her down for the surprise
But she still knows naught 
Her excited, the apple of my eye
Then her face grows gaunt

Speechless, inert
She reaches forward
Her hand in search
For the eye blurred

Her tiny hand reaches in
The eye starts giving way
How could she do such sin
But the crack consumes eagerly

The eye reformed becoming clear
After her assimilation completed
Around it begins to leer
Then to me transfixed, belated

My mind understanding
"I want out of this crack.
You shall start excavating"
"Yes" I answer, my mind growing slack

END

There was nothing in the crack but my poor baby, reaching out for help, for me. None of this shit he said. I still don't understand but I need to get this out of my mind. Going to move in with my parents for now, they said they would remove our stuff and sell the home. Good riddance.
