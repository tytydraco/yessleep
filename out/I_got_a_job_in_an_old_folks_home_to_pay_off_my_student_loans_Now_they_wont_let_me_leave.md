“*Hello there*, tall dark and handsome,” the world’s oldest woman said, batting her cataract-clouded eyes. “What brings a hunk like you to our humble little nursing home?”

“Uh…well…” I stammered. It was the first hour of my first day on the job and I didn’t quite know how to respond. I’d felt off-kilter since I was frisked and wanded before being allowed into the facility. Security here was air-tight. All employees were thoroughly searched. No visitors were allowed, as far as I knew. It was more like a CIA station than a nursing home. But I, unfortunately, needed the $14.50 an hour, so--

Jamie, my supervisor, saved me the trouble of devising an answer. “You really don’t have to. Victoria asks that of all the new male staff,” she said, ushering me towards her office at the end of the Clorox-scented hall. “Don’t you, Victoria?”

“Just the select few capable of satisfying my female needs,” Victoria responded, stroking—slowly, insinuatingly—the aluminum handles of her walker.

Shifting uneasily in my purple caregiver uniform, I gave her a quick once-over. Victoria wore a black, diaphanous nightgown, red lipstick that ventured well beyond the lips, rouged cheeks and a saucy black beret angled provocatively over her milky right eye.

Victoria lost, then regained her balance. She was wan, no more than eighty-five pounds, with thinning white hair. Winded from the struggle to remain upright, she added, pausing frequently, “I have a good eye for men. And—and—you, sir, are the type that keeps me alive. So, before you go, I have an itty-bitty favor to ask.”

“And what would that be?” I asked, plastering on a smile, indulging her.

“A teeny tiny kiss. A peck on the cheek.” She giggled.

I turned to Jamie for approval. Personally, I saw no harm in giving Victoria what she wanted. I thoroughly enjoyed old people—the fascinating stories they told, the life lessons they taught me. It was one of the reasons I’d chosen to work in a nursing home. If brushing my lips against Victoria’s rouged cheeks was elder abuse, the laws needed to be changed. But I didn’t want to get fired on my first day.

Apparently feeling the same as me, Jamie nodded her assent. “Might do her some good. Always worked magic when your predecessor did the same thing.”  She turned to Victoria. “But no more of your dirty tricks, young lady, and you know what I mean. *One peck*.”

“Dirty tricks? Who me?” Victoria asked, widening her eyes coquettishly, dislodging an enormous fake lash. She offered me her right cheek.

I stepped forward, wondering if this was such a good idea after all. The scent of her rouge, her perfume, was overwhelming. Her round face, as it loomed ever closer, was like a powdered, quivering moon. My stomach revolted. The face of a young woman enthralled me. But Victoria’s? With all due respect to mature females, Victoria was one-hundred-twenty-seven years old, a human dinosaur whose bones might inspire lust in an archaeologist, not a young, single male.

Nevertheless, I persisted, pursing my lips, leaning forward into the pecking zone. Serving the clients was my duty, Jamie had, during orientation, reminded me again and again. I was only doing my job.

Clamping my eyes shut, I dove in, only to have my lips smothered and a tongue thrust into my mouth, searching, probing, obscenely. Mucous-like spittle clogged my throat. I gagged, but didn’t dare part, for fear of offending Victoria, breaking her desperately lonely heart. She was failing badly. This might be her last kiss. With that in mind, I returned the favor, French kissing her deeply, opening my mouth in full surrender to her dying charms.

Time ceased to exist. Victoria and I went on and on, clutching each other greedily, fusing our mouths.

Oh, my god. She was turning me on! And in full view of Jamie and assorted rubberneckers gathering in the hall. Regaining my senses, I did what any other red-blooded young man in my position would do: I vomited in my mouth. Victoria tongued the bile, swallowing it, drinking me in.

Gasping, I pushed us apart. Victoria smiled triumphantly. Her mouth was a gaping black hole. My thrusting tongue had dislodged her false teeth. She cupped the dripping plate high in her right hand.

“I’m sorry,” I apologized to Jamie. “Guess I should turn in my uniform, hey?”

“No harm done, as far I can see,” Jamie replied, surprisingly. I’d already started unbuttoning my company-provided purple smock. “Victoria’s happy. You seemed pretty happy, too. Make that *very happy.”*

“Get a room!” an onlooker joked.

Jamie shooed him away. “Seriously,” she said to me, “what you just showed me was an admirable commitment to the patient population. A strong work ethic. You’ll do anything for a client. I like that!” She turned to Victoria. “Now put your teeth back in and go to your room.  The evening meal will be served in an hour. Scurry!”

Victoria shuffled off silently. But not before giving me a wink and a sly grin.

I stifled my own surprising smile. My heart skipped a beat when she closed her door. I felt like smashing it down and covering Victoria with hungry kisses. What the f\*\*\*k was going on with me? First night jitters? Get a grip, dude! I buttoned and smoothed my smock.

Jamie appeared unfazed. But then, she was a nursing home veteran. She’d seen and heard all manner of weird things.   

Pulling me with her, Jamie skittered into her office and closed the door. “Sorry about back there,” she said, rolling her eyes. “Don’t want to turn you off before your first shift at Eternity Nursing Home and Hospice Care even begins.”

Twenty feet away, Victoria had cracked open her door. She was watching us—or more specifically me—her face an ancient masque of lust. Her teeth were back in, though a tad loose. Bile rose in my throat. I sensed that, if she kept staring, I’d vomit again. This time in full view, pouring onto Jamie’s desk, her lap.  Me, the twenty-year-old super fit guy with an iron stomach.

“Help me close the blinds, would you?” Jamie asked, dropping them with a clatter over her glass door. “Victoria can’t hear well. But there are times I feel she’s reading lips.”

With the blinds down, Jamie’s office fell into a disorienting twilight. Nevertheless, with Victoria out of sight, my stomach settled down. And, thank goodness, my libido returned to baseline.

“Even with the cataracts?”

“Believe or not, those come and go. The ophthalmologist can’t explain it, other than to say that Victoria’s a one-off. Unique. Most of her other medical people are scratching their heads, too. She’ll get worse for a while, seemingly at death’s door. And then her health will improve—dramatically—just like that.” Jamie clapped her hands sharply.

I jumped. Jamie, I was increasingly aware, was a little off, too.

She continued, “One doctor proclaimed that, when Victoria was in an up phase, she was a like a healthy forty-five-year-old in the body of a hundred and twenty-seven-year-old. That was just before the last male caregiver quit or disappeared or whatever, opening up the position you now occupy.”

“One-twenty-seven? For real?”

“Best as we can tell. She was born prematurely in a remote Romanian village. Appallingly, Victoria’s mother was alone at the time, peeling the household’s few remaining turnips for that night’s watery soup. Her husband, and all healthy men of working age, had apparently run off, humiliated that the entire root vegetable crop had failed. Cabbage, radishes, rutabagas—the whole lot. To them, that was an insult to their masculinity, their role as providers. Which left only women, children and a few elderly, near-worthless men. 

“What records there were of Victoria’s birth disappeared when the village was burned to the ground. Some claim it was arson committed by the humiliated men. At any rate, it was at that point that all women and children fled, too.

“Years after migrating to Bucharest, Victoria’s mother obtained a signed statement from a former village matriarch verifying that Victoria had been born in 1898. And that’s what she brought along when she and her daughter traveled by merchant ship to the United States.”

Jamie shrugged. “It became Victoria’s de facto birth certificate that she carried with her everywhere. Ten years ago, when her health started failing and she moved in with us, our former communications director used it to dub her the oldest woman in the world. The media picked up on it and the title stuck.” She adopted a mischievous grin. “And get this. No one outside these walls knows, but I can tell you now that you’re part of the team. I’m distantly related to Victoria.”

“How fascinating,” I lied, immersed in the memory of Victoria’s brain-melting kiss.

Seeming to sense my disinterest, Jamie replied, “Yeah, we trace our lineage back to the same Romanian village or something.” She slid behind her gray metal desk. Well, enough of Lady V for now. Let me fill you in on your duties.”

I leaned back on my wobbly steel chair and listened. I’d been hired as the new Overnight Caregiver, a solo position that would involve dispensing medications (rarely), changing bedpans and, most of all, sweeping and mopping. In other words, glorified janitorial work. Having walked through the facility after an initial orientation, I figured I could get everything done in under two hours. After which I’d have six hours to do homework (social sciences undergrad) or play online video games. I was a loner and didn’t have friends.

There were only fifteen residents, not including those in the hospice wing, which was locked and off-limits to me and all nursing home staff. A CCTV camera hovered over the chained double doors, in continuous scanning mode, which seemed a tad excessive, given that the nursing home residents knew that all who entered soon died. 

A short while later, Jamie was gone. The facility’s lights had been dimmed. I was the only employee left. Even the cook had clocked out, leaving a food service cart for me to wheel around to the residents’ rooms. After serving them dinner, I’d collect their plates and they’d all go to sleep. Their TVs still blaring, of course.

I gave the food cart a shove. Shit! My knee went out! Man, it hurt!

Maybe I’d twisted it playing pick-up b-ball the night before, one of the rare times I got out and mixed. Limping around, swearing, I spied a resident’s forgotten cane. Hobbling over, I snatched it up. Pretty stylish, I thought, except for the pronged base. I gave it a test run to the staff break room, the cane taking just enough weight off my throbbing knee. 

Breathing easier, I eyed myself in a mirror. The cane was looking pretty natty. But the harsh lights made it seem like I was developing premature crow’s feet. I turned the lights down. The crow’s feet disappeared.  

But food service was running late. The residents would complain to Jamie and it would be bye, bye job. I gathered up the food cart, bent on doing the right thing.

And then—and then—gripped by irresistible yearning, I limped past one room and then another, the cart rattling over the tiles. I needed to feed Victoria, apologize, and, more than anything, kiss her again. That feisty lass had stripped me off all reason, made me heedless like never before. So much so that I snagged the stainless steel cart with my orthopedic cane. It teetered, then fell, instant oatmeal, orange sherbet and Salisbury steak, spilling on the floor.

Who cared!

I turned one last corner, limping towards Victoria—and—thank god—there she was, leaning languidly against her door in a snug cashmere sweater tied at her slim waist—looking twenty years younger, which made her 109 and me sick again. Rushing forward, I vomited into her yearning mouth, overjoyed that something magnificent had started that could not be stopped.

We locked lips for ten heavenly minutes, her nimble tongue exploring my every molar and gum. Her thick saliva was like nectar to me. I swallowed it greedily, aching for more, more.

A cacophony of heavy explosions filled the air.

“What’s that?” Victoria, breaking away, exclaimed.

Caught in flagrante delicto, I panicked, fantasizing that a SWAT team—the FBI—was charging down the hall, flinging shock grenades, eager to arrest me for the allegedly deplorable crime of necking with a woman 107 years my senior.

More deafening explosions, then a swell of music, and I recognized the sounds as the opening scenes of the Vietnam War movie, *Apocalypse Now*, blasting from the unattended TV in a snoring resident’s room.

“Better finish your dinner rounds before the natives get restless,” Victoria advised. She was suddenly cold, despite our recently completed mouth-to-mouth exchange of bodily fluids.

“Whatever m’lady desires,” I said, bowing in an exaggeratedly courtly manner, kissing her spotted hand. Unsmiling, she shook me off and shut her door with unexpected force.

I returned to the staff room, my mind a riot of passion and guilt. Grabbing a mop and pail I doubled back to the hall, where I picked the Salisbury steaks off the floor, mopped them, and then covered the lot with a fresh can of cold turkey gravy. To hell with the other residents. I only cared, deeply cared, about one; the sultry filly who was driving me clear out of my mind.

Under Victoria’s erotic spell, I found it hard to calm down. My good knee shook, my bad knee was still tender and store. Back in the staff room, I locked and bolted the door. As an extra measure, I blocked it with a pair of filing cabinets.

I needed to think. I wasn’t much of a lady’s man. I’d “made out” with five girls and struck gold with one, though I’d been so drunk, I didn’t know it until she’d showed me the evidence on her phone.

Yet my shyness had melted away the moment I first saw lovely Victoria. From that moment on, I craved her kiss. Nothing, not even *ten* SWAT teams could keep from the exquisite pleasure of her cracked, dry lips.

Contemplating Victoria, my hands shook. To settle my nerves, I watched a video of former British PM Theresa May, who had a voice and manner that, without fail, lulled me to sleep…

I awoke with a start, pulling a muscle in my lower back. I’d napped for minutes, but it seemed like years. Grabbing my cane, I shuffled over to staff medicine cabinet. On top of everything my stomach was cramping from constipation. I drank a heaping glass of Metamucil, with no results.

I glanced the mirror. Something was dead wrong. My curly black hair was speckled with grey, and the crow’s feet had returned, more numerous and deeper than before. I looked like an anal cavity that had stopped functioning. I took a swing at the glaring overhead lights. My shoulder went out. Damn. More f\*\*\*\*\*\*g pain.

*Brrnngg!!!*

An emergency bell rang. I checked the patient communications panel. The distress call was coming from Victoria’s room!  Tearing the file cabinets away from the staff door, my injured back muscle spasmed and I collapsed on the floor.

Gritting my teeth, I tried and failed to rise. I’d fallen down and couldn’t get up—in a retirement home! Laughing ruefully, I crawled outside to a recharging electric mobility scooter, pulled out the plug and dragged myself into the driver’s seat.

I floored the vehicle, shouting at a resident who’d had the temerity to get in my way. Who gave a damn about his petty concerns!

Victoria came to her door wearing a lacy black girdle, red high heels and sequined halter top. She puffed a Gauloises cigarette in an ebony holder. Her body was shockingly trim and fit.

“What are you here for?” she asked, her voice still icy cold. She blew smoke in my face.

“You rang.”

“Oh, that’s right. Silly me,” she said, shaking her head.

“So what is it you want to say to me?” I asked, desperate for encouraging words, like *kiss me, you fool*.

“We’re done,” she replied, admiring her astonishing physique.

“Wh-why? After all we’ve been through? I demand an explanation.”

“I don’t date old men.”

“I’m twenty f\*\*\*\*\*g years old.”

“Could have fooled me. You can’t walk under your own power. You hair has gone completely gray. Your hands are trembling with early-stage Parkinson’s disease. And, for god’s sake, buy some Depends.”

I looked down. Indeed, my crotch was soaking wet.

“It’s you who’s done this to me. I was perfectly fine until I met you.”

“Oh, such anger you have. And here I thought you adored me.”

“I do. I mean, I need you. I want you. I exist for your kiss. Please, please, just one more and I’ll never ask again.”

Victoria smiling knowingly. “You’re just like all the others. And there have been so, so many.” She shook her head.

“I thought your lips were mine alone.”

“One man has never been enough for me. You come and go. One night and, frankly, I’m done with you.”

“No, no, I’m not like those other men. I’m decent. I’m kind. I’m yours for eternity.”

“You poor, deluded soul. You have so much to learn. And so little time.”

“Then a last kiss. I beg of you,” I cried, clasping my hands. I tried, but couldn’t stand up.

Indulging me, Victoria bent down and plunged her tongue deep into my mouth, deeper than ever before. It was a sympathy kiss, I knew, but the effect on me was the same. I shuddered with excitement. We exchanged vile bodily fluids one last sweet time.

Crestfallen, I turned around the mobility cart and whirred away. Half way down the hall I looked back. Victoria, my Victoria, was already back in her room.

My chest tightened unexpectedly. Sharp pain shot down my upper left arm. Struggling with the steering wheel, I careened through the partially opened staff room door, coming to a sudden stop against the far wall. Thrown to the floor, it took every ounce of my waning strength for me to boot up the portable heart defibrillator, attach the pads and shock myself out of a massive heart attack. My entire body shuddered. I lost consciousness.  

I awoke with Jamie looming above me, her face a mask of benevolent concern. I was on a gurney in a room lined with row upon row of bedridden elderly men. They moaned and called out:

“Kiss me.”

“More, I want more.”

“Abandon the others, Victoria. Make me the only one.”

“Your arrival has agitated them. But don’t worry,” Jamie admonished me, “They’ll quiet down after the morning sedation.” She shifted a huge load of paperwork from one arm to the other, numerous pages fluttering to the floor. She wore a black babushka and a flowing peasant dress.

“Where are the doctors? The nurses?” I asked, my words muffled by an oxygen mask.

“We have sufficient staff,” Jamie observed.

I turned to see numerous women, also in babushkas and peasant dresses, wiping patient brows, administering morning meds. They exuded professional cheer, laughing and joking with the dilapidated men.

“And it may make you feel better to know that you’re *not* hospitalized. No, you’re still in Eternity Care, the hospice wing. In qualified hands, under specialized care.” Jamie was on her hands and knees, scooping up pages.

“Is that my chart? Hand it to me right now!”

 Jamie chuckled. “No. These are resumes,” she said, waving one. “We’re hiring again. Overnight male staff.”

 “But that’s my job. I need the money.” Speaking through the oxygen mask was like whispering “help” from the bottom of a well.

“Please. You’re in no shape to continue. Nor is he. Or he,” she said, indicating two nearby patients.

“And who the fuck are they?”

“Your predecessors. In work and French kissing.” Sighing, she pulled up a plastic chair. She cradled her hands. Exhaled. “You see, Victoria is a special needs patient.”

“And those special needs are—”

“Men. About one every six weeks. She waxes after receiving your kisses. I once saw her run a six-minute mile the morning after a single night stand. And she had just turned, I believe, one hundred and fifteen. She ages quickly after that, until she reaches the broken-down state in which you first encountered her.”

“Bullshit. Not possible.”

“Not without single, lonely men like you. And your bile.

I tore off the oxygen mask. “Let me the f\*\*k out of here you f\*\*\*\*\*g nutbag.”

“Code white! Aggressive hospice care patient!” Jamie called out and two attendants came running. One of them restrained my arms. The other returned to my face the oxygen mask, sweat and saliva dripping down. My breathing had become labored, so I was actually thankful.

“You’ve proved my point sir,” Jamie continued. “In the process of locking lips, Victoria partakes of the male essence. And returns it to you in neutered form of a thick paste.”

“So what you’re saying is that the essence of man is vomit? Please!”

“More precisely bile. Literally and figuratively.”

A bout of laughing caused me to flat line. The attendants revived me with amyl nitrate, after which Jamie returned.

Jamie remained standing this time. She looked at her watch. “Listen, I’ve got to post this help wanted ad. Your position is open and Victoria will begin her precipitous decline again soon. There’s always another loner who wants to work the overnight shift.”

“I’m going to report you to the health authority!”

This roused the patient next to me, a pathetic creature with a bulbous stomach and toothpick arms. “Me and you both,” he said, before falling again into a comatose state.

“I think you’re better off here,” she said. Turning to the other patients, raising her voice, she proclaimed. “You’re all better off here, receiving the care only we can provide.” Her stern voice carried an implied threat.

“So you’re ready to throw away your reputation for a single one-hundred-twenty-seven-year-old crazy woman?”

“That’s where you’re wrong, sir. Victoria isn’t 127. She’s 238.”

“Sure.”

“Victoria’s my great-grandmother thirteen times over. I told you in my office that we were related. In fact, every female in here is related to her somehow, patients and staffers alike. It’s our home away from home.  Victoria has been protecting the women of our village for centuries. She keeps us safe. Aging and regenerating. Aging and regenerating. By surrendering her body to manly bile. Which of course, all women do.”

“So what makes Victoria different?”

“She swallows. And one day all women will adopt her method. That’s why our clan brought her to the United States. The place that spreads freedom around the world. Keeping Victoria alive keeps hope of our own freedom alive.”

With that, Jamie left.

As of this writing, she has not come back, allowing me, with my pained, arthritic hands to scribble my tale.

In tiny cursive on this odorous pair of Depends. That I hope some dumpster diver will retrieve from the facility’s trash and bring to your attention.

If you are reading this, he succeeded. Until I hear from you, I will continue watching game shows on the ceiling TV along with the rest of the hospice crowd. At piercing volume of course.

And, unless the cavalry comes, that may be for a long while. You see, before Jamie left, she told me that while I have aged prematurely, I will live out my normal life span.

Which means I’m looking at a good eighty years of Parkinson’s, heart seizures and *Wheel of Fortune*. A fate worse than death.

But I’d suffer through eighty more dismal years for another splendiferous night of tonsil hockey with the oldest—and sexiest—woman on earth.
