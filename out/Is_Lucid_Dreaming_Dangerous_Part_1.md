Hello Reddit,

I'm putting this out there for anyone who knows anything about lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis, comas, or the subconscious mind.

For those who didn’t get to see my last post before I took it down, here’s some context.

3 months ago, my wife passed away from a car accident, and now for the last 3 weeks, my son has been in a coma.

For the first couple days, he would occasionally move or make a noise, but now he’s completely unresponsive.

My reason for posting here is because I have some thoughts about what the cause of this coma might be. My suspicions might sound a little crazy, but I’m desperate, and I’m just looking to hear the response of anyone other than the doctors and nurses.

Anyways, my son was in the car 3 months ago when the accident happened, and thankfully he came out practically unharmed; but as you can imagine, the experience was very traumatic for him.

My wife didn’t die in the car, she survived, but the accident left her stuporous and barely conscious. She was in the hospital for a little over a month before she went into cardiac arrest and passed.

Not long after the car accident, however, my son became fixated on the practice of lucid dreaming. This is a detail about him that I didn’t include in my last post because I didn’t think it was anything significant until recently.

Anyways, I don’t know much about lucid dreaming, but according to him, it’s essentially the ability to control your dreams.

He told me he wanted to get better at lucid dreaming so that he could talk to his mom again.

At this time, her state was worsening, and there wasn’t much hope in being able to speak with her again.

My son wanted to use lucid dreaming as a way to cope with that, and he told me he was keeping a dream journal to track his progress.

I immediately recognized it as a coping mechanism, and I tried to show support by asking him to tell me about his dreams.

He would occasionally tell me about them, but I think he preferred writing about them and then forgetting them.

I saw no harm in this practice, I didn’t think it was an unhealthy way of coping either; everybody processes grief differently. I’m just thankful he didn’t turn to drugs or alcohol, like many boys his age do.

I assumed that after she passed, he was done with lucid dreaming, but I was wrong.

As I wrote in my last post; 3 weeks ago, I was out on an overnight business trip, and my son told me he could handle being home alone, so I didn’t have him stay with anyone.

I realize now that that was a mistake, because when I came home the following morning, I found him unresponsive in his bed.

I tried waking him up for about a half hour before I took him to the hospital.

My initial thought was an attempted suicide or an overdose of some kind, but the only thing the doctors were able to tell me was that he was in a coma, and it wasn’t self-inflicted.

Based on their observations, they think he’d been that way for approximately 8 hours before I brought him in.

Every other test they’ve done so far has proven that he’s perfectly normal and healthy; no drugs were involved.

Unfortunately, the replies to my last post weren’t very helpful either, so there hasn’t been much progress towards finding a diagnosis.

I visit him every day, and the nurses tell me there are still more tests to run, but his doctor tells me he’s never seen anything like it before.

I was at a loss for any kind of reason as to why this happened, until last night when I was in his bedroom, and I found his dream journal under his pillow.

I flipped through the journal skimming the pages for anything concerning. I didn’t even know what I was looking for, but I continued searching for any kind of answer as to why this happened to him.

As I read on, I became increasingly unsettled.

There was something that didn’t seem right about his dreams.

Dreams are often unexplainable, but there was a certain reoccurrence in them that tells me that there may have been something wrong with him.

I don’t know what it could be, I tried showing the doctor, but all he told me was to focus on what we can know for sure.

I’m no expert on dreams, so I picked the entries from his journal that stood out most to me, and I wanted to see if any of you guys could maybe recognize an onset of some kind of illness or any signs that could indicate a mental disorder.

I’m not sure if I’ll receive anything helpful, but I’m just trying to do everything I can to help my son.

I’ll have the first batch of entries posted below.

Because of reddits character limit, I have to spread out the entries over a few individual posts. I will try and post a part 2 as soon as possible.

I will also include his very first entry because it has some useful info for a lot of the things he talks about in his other entries.

**10/28/24 Entry #0 - Why I Want to Learn How to Lucid Dream**

Welcome to my dream journal!

My goal for this journal is to write down my dreams every morning in as much detail as possible.

I read that having a dream journal is essential to lucid dreaming, so that’s why I’m doing this. I’ve just recently discovered lucid dreaming, and I already have so many ideas of all the things I want to try. I’d never heard of it until yesterday.

Youtube randomly put a video about it on my feed, and I watched it.

I learned that lucid dreaming is basically when you’re dreaming but you know that you’re dreaming, and people who are really good at it can even control their dreams.

There have been a few times where I ‘ve randomly realized that I’m dreaming, but I had no idea that that had a name, and that it could be practiced. I’m honestly so surprised I’ve never heard of it, I feel like this is something everybody should know about.

Anyways, a dream journal apparently helps because writing down your dreams everyday helps familiarize yourself with your dreams, so you get better at catching yourself when you’re in a dream. It doesn’t make total sense to me, but that’s just what I read online.

I also just wanted to make this journal so I could track my progress as a lucid dreamer.

I also read that doing reality checks every now and then is a good habit for lucid dreamers.

Like, if I make it a habit to occasionally count my fingers or check the time, I might do it in a dream at some point, and in dreams, if you try to count your fingers you’ll have like 13 fingers or something, or if you try to read a clock it’ll say like 85 o’ clock and that’s how you catch it.

I did a lot of research on how to practice lucid dreaming and I discovered that there are 3 main techniques called MILD, WILD, and FILD (they’re acronyms).

Tonight, I’m gonna try MILD first, and I can’t wait!

MILD stands for “Mnemonic Induced Lucid Dreaming” and what you have to do is just say to yourself “I will lucid dream tonight” like 10 times before bed, and that somehow induces a lucid dream.

If that’s all I have to do, that would be so easy. I really doubt it’s that simple, but I really hope it works.

lol I‘m already thinking about having a dream where I fly over my school and Jack and Lily and the whole school sees me from their windows. I’m so excited I can’t wait!

Anyways, on a more serious note… Another thing that I want to do, or really, the main thing that I want to do when I get good at lucid dreaming is talk to mom.

I feel like these last few days I’ve been missing her more than normal, and idk why. I’ve had dreams about her before, but I’m not in control of those dreams, so they don’t feel real.

I want to visit her in a dream where I’m aware and conscious, and if lucid dreaming can do that for me… idk, I would just feel so much better.

But yeah, that’s mainly it for this intro, I just wanted to write about my new discoveries. I’m super excited to get started tonight!

**10/29/24 Entry#1 - MILD fail** **(update)**

Last night I tried MILD for the first time, and it didn’t work at all. I just went to sleep and had a dream like normal.

I didn’t rlly have high hopes for MILD honestly, it sounded way too easy. It’s 3PM right now, I waited way too long to write this entry, I just got home from school and now I don’t remember my dream at all.

I should’ve written it down first thing, but I didn’t have enough time. I’ll probably start setting my alarm 30 or so minutes earlier so I can have time in the morning to write.

I just rlly rlly don’t wanna get up earlier… Oh well, this first run was a bust. I guess I’ll just try again tomorrow.

**11/1/24 Entry#4 - I COULDNT MOVE (nightmare)**

I just had the worst nightmare of my life. I'M NEVER DOING WILD AGAIN! I tried MILD the last 3 nights, and each time nothing happened, so I decided to switch it up last night and try WILD. BIG MISTAKE! NEVER AGAIN!

WILD stands for “Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming” and what you have to do is close your eyes and lie completely, and I mean COMPLETELY still so that your body falls asleep before your brain does.

You literally just have to lay there and not move a single muscle, and after like a half hour, a dream will start but your brain will still be wide awake. It sounds easy, but it’s actually really hard. I failed 2 times before I could get it to work.

After like 5 minutes of lying there, I started to get really itchy. The video I watched said that your body will do that to test to see if you’re still awake, but if you ignore the itch, you pass the test. But I didn’t JUST get super itchy, I also started getting these weird urges to flex certain muscles. Idk how to describe it, it was just like my body did not want to sit still.

2 times I gave in and itched myself. Since last night was a Friday, and I could sleep in, I could afford to stay up late until I got it. And on my 3rd attempt, it worked. I wish I would’ve just given up because last night was the most scared I’ve felt in years.

I will try and explain it in the most detail as possible, it’s all still fresh for me.

Anyways, I did it laying on my side, and I was completely still for what felt like forever. After the itchiness and the urges to move went away, I started to feel this sinking feeling in my chest and face, it was so weird.

It felt like my chest and head were melting off of my body and sinking into my bed. It felt like I was sinking deeper and deeper; everything got really dark, and then I opened my eyes and there I was, still in my bed.

I thought I just drifted off a little and woke back up, but something didn’t feel right. It felt like there was a disconnect between my mind and my body. I could see my arms, but it felt like I was looking at somebody else’s arms, not my own. I soon realized why I felt this way, because when I tried to move my hand, it didn’t budge.

I tried a few more times, I tried moving my legs, I tried moving my head, I tried moving my mouth, but nothing worked. I couldn’t move; I was paralyzed.

The only part of me that I could control was my eyes. It started to get hard to breathe, and I got this horrible claustrophobic feeling. I was definitely freaking out.

It felt like I was buried alive with no coffin. I tried harder and harder to move my arms, but it just made me more exhausted and more panicked.

I looked around my room, and under my bedroom door, I could see light. I heard the TV downstairs, and I knew dad was still awake.

I tried yelling for him, but my mouth wouldn’t open. If only he knew what was happening to me, if only I could get his attention somehow, he could snap me out of it.

I heard him coming up the stairs, he was moving very slowly. He stopped in front of my door, and I got my hopes up. I prayed that he would open my door.

If he could just see me, maybe he could tell there was something wrong. I tried shouting again, but nothing came out. I tried again, I didn’t care if it wasn’t working, I was gonna keep shouting till he heard me.

I stared at the door wishing and wishing until, almost as if to taunt me, I saw his shadow under the door slowly turn and walk away.

In my mind I was screaming in agony, the claustrophobia was getting worse. How long would I be stuck like this? Would I have to wait till morning for dad to wake me up? What if he just assumed I was sleeping and went to work without waking me?

Just when I was on the verge of losing my mind, my eyes scanned the room around me, and I saw something that took me out of my own misery for a moment.

At the foot of my bed, where my closet door was supposed to be, there was a different door.

It was a large, dark wooden door with a golden doorknob.

I immediately thought, “that isn’t right, my closet door is white”. I squinted at it trying to make out more of its details, but I was laying on my side, and my shoulder covered half of it from view. Also, my room was completely dark, so I wouldn’t be able to see it very well anyway.

My mind went quiet for a moment, and I could hear a sound behind the door. It sounded like a metal hinge squeaking back and forth. I could also hear what sounded like chains clinking together or like the sound of somebody shaking their keys, Idk. It sounded exactly like the swing set from the playground near the old house, specifically the red one, the one where mom saved me from that rlly mean kid.

The memory started to replay in my head. I remembered how helpless I felt back then before mom showed up, and I compared it to how helpless I felt now. I started wishing that mom could come save me now, and my eyes started to tear up.

Then suddenly, I got hit with the smell of gasoline, and I was immediately reminded of the accident. The smell was coming from the same place I heard the sound; it was coming from behind the door.

I felt nauseous, and I held my breath. Then, to my horror, I saw the golden doorknob begin to turn.

The door creaked open slowly, and I saw nothing but darkness inside of it. I thought my room was dark, but inside that door was a different kind of darkness, it was completely black.

The smell of gasoline was almost too much for me to handle, but I refused to take my eyes off the open doorway. I was scared, very scared.

I stared into the blackness trying to adjust my eyes, and with a great effort, I could see something hiding in the darkness.

Down at the bottom of the door frame, I saw the silhouette of something round and white.

My eyes were still adjusting, and at first, I thought it was my volleyball, but that didn’t make sense because this wasn’t my closet I was looking into. As my eyes adjusted, I realized it looked more like a person's head sitting at the edge of the shadows.

I could see something dark coming out of the top of it and down the sides like long black hair.

I told myself that that was stupid, and I tried to think of all the things it could be other than a human head. However, the image was becoming clearer; I could definitely see a face, and it was facing me.

It was still very hard to see, but I definitely knew there was a face because it was easy to see its pale skin against the dark background. It was resting on its chin, like a person laying on their stomach with their head turned upward.

I tried looking behind it for a body, but I couldn’t see anything in the shadows. My heart was pounding; my eyes were stuck on the head. I couldn’t see the look on its face, it was too dark.

I waited for it to move, but it stayed completely still.

“Did it think it was hidden? Does it know that I can see it?”

I laid there preparing for the worst, but nothing happened, it didn’t move an inch. It felt like minutes had gone by and it didn’t so much as twitch.

Too much time had passed, I was beginning to doubt what I was seeing. I thought maybe it was a mannequin head or some kind of statue, if it was a person, it would have moved by now.

I relaxed slightly at that thought, but it was short lived.

Suddenly, as if it knew what I was thinking, it decided to move.

It slithered forward slowly like a snake. I shut my eyes before it could come out from the shadows, I was afraid of it seeing my eyes open and knowing I’m awake.

It barely made a sound as it moved across the floor.

After a few long seconds, I squinted my eyes open just barely. I couldn’t see it anymore; it was out of my view now.

The only place it could be where I can’t see it is at the foot or the side of my bed.

I broke out in a cold sweat. Under the sound of my own heart pounding, I could just barely hear it moving past the foot of my bed.

It slithered around to the side that my back was facing, then stopped. There was a period of silence.

I sat there thinking “where is it now??”

Then my bed creaked slightly. I could feel the mattress dipping down behind me like somebody was sitting there.

I could feel its eyes on my back. There was no more air left in my lungs, I was frozen, I felt exposed, I felt vulnerable.

I started to prepare myself for pain like I was about to be stabbed in the back with a knife, but nothing happened.

After a few minutes, I heard it drop back down to the floor and move across it again. It slid around my bed toward the other side which was the side that I was facing.

The thought of seeing its face terrified me. I squeezed my eyes shut and hoped that if it thought I was asleep maybe it wouldn’t harm me.

I laid there pretending to be asleep, I had no idea where it was now. My body went stiff, I knew I needed to open my eyes at some point, but I was too afraid to.

Even with my eyes closed, my vision became darker, there was a shadow looming over me.

I was determined to stay completely silent until I suddenly felt hair brushing against my face.

I absolutely lost it.

I couldn’t hold it anymore; I screamed with everything I had in me. I squeezed my eyes tighter and screamed and screamed, it was all I could do.

I felt a firm grip on my shoulders shake me, it was trying to silence me. I felt feeling enter my body again, and I thrashed around screaming louder now that I could finally hear myself.

In between one of my yells, I heard my dad's voice. I opened my eyes and saw that he was the one holding my shoulders.

It took me a moment to believe it, but once I did, my body finally relaxed.

I was drenched in sweat. He said he heard me groaning in my sleep, so he came in and shook me, and I started screaming and thrashing around.

I took a moment to gather myself, dad got me some water and I changed my pajamas. I told him about the nightmare, but I told him a shortened version of it. I didn’t want him to know how scared I was, and I didn’t want him to worry. I slept the rest of the night in his room. I think I’m gonna take a break from lucid dreaming for a couple days.
