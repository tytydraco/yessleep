So, for the first time in a long time the other day me and my wife decided to drive through old county road 9 to get to the next town over. Now as many of you know I have stayed clear of this road for the better half of 14 years and honestly that is for good reason. 

However, on this particular night we had to get to the next town over to see her parents for the new year. Usually, I would take the highway but on this particular night the highway was closed due to a car pileup. Old county road 9 was a straight shot right through to the next town where I had to go and honestly it really did shave off an hour of the drive. 

I took one look at my wife who was now starting to slump over in the passenger seat. "Honey you good" I said to her keeping one eye on the road and one eye on her. "yes I'm fine just tired" she replied yawning. "Well we are almost there turning on to county 9 now" I said back to her. I must have had some sort of nervousness in my voice when saying that because she shot up from her seat now sitting up right to face me and said "Are you going to be ok"

I shot her a look but before I could respond a thick fog the size of a baseball field surrounded the car. "James" she said yelling back at me "what's going on" I tightened my grip on the steering wheel and did not even reply to her my gaze 100% stuck on the road ahead. 

And then just as it appeared it disappeared retracting off into the woods that surrounded the road. "Ok I think" before I could finish that sentence, I was cut off by my wife saying, "A diner out here?" I slammed on the brakes as hard as I could my car coming to a screeching halt my gaze now meeting hers. There on the side of the road as if it had never left sat the now faded neon sign illuminating the night with the words Paul's Diner 24-hour service. 

My jaw practically dropped as I saw this, "stay here" I said to my wife. I approached the diner slowly and looked inside through the dark glassed windows the diner that once held such life was now empty and covered with trash. I looked around the property some more setting my gaze on the front door of the diner expecting to see Sue run out at any minute, but she didn't. 

Sue was the name of the waitress that greeted me all those years ago but instead of her greeting me this time an older man did. "Can I help you" a raspy voice said from behind the building. "Uh no I don't think so just uh where Sue" he looked at me for a moment and paused then spoke "Sue? son there's nobody here by that name I'm Steve the caretaker of this here ran down place." 

My face dropped as he said this "caretaker?" "yes we are going to be reopening this place soon." I looked at him again in utter shock at this point my wife was now out of the car as well and said "Babe who are you talking too" I looked back at the old man as if to say him I'm talking to him, but he was gone. 

I backed away slowly all the way to my car not letting the building leave my gaze. I looked down to get in my car and back up at the diner but it was gone the diner just simply was gone. I told my wife we had to get out of here and she agreed we sped down the old road not talking about what just happened. 

The rest of the ride was quiet, and we made it to her parents ok and on time. However, I did do some research yet again when we arrived and this time to my shock there was a new article to read on the incident. And it was one I did not see before it sat at the bottom of the fire report that I read last time, and it sat in a little sub article section that was barely noticeable. 

It read "Tragedy strikes local caretaker when trying to re-open old diner." "Police and fire responded to a report of a man trapped earlier today and when they arrived on scene it was already too late the man identified as 44-year-old Steve Moore was crushed to death under 3 tons of concrete in the old Paul's Diner and rest stop on county road 9."

I turned pale at this and just dropped my phone letting it hit the carpet bellow. My wife ran over to see if I was ok and I simply just nodded. The night ended normally and as I sit here summiting this on the same forum that all of you did all those years ago I can't help but feel like this is just the beginning.
