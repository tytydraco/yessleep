Nothing about the heist was real except for the money we took.

&#x200B;

This is what I kept telling myself. The severity of the situation lessened when I repeated that personal mantra. 

&#x200B;

The gun I carried was a children’s toy, painted black to look more authentic. I had a flashlight glued on to make it look more menacing. Anyone willing to give the prop a bit more scrutiny could distinguish it for what it was. I did not plan on allowing anyone to do so. 

&#x200B;

I forged the note I handed the cashier in the jewelry store with my non-dominant hand. It took me a week to write. The cash and diamonds she gave me seemed to make the work worth it.

&#x200B;

I ordered her to not press any panic alarms. I made my way out onto the main row of shops, sprinted to a back alleyway, and hopped in the getaway vehicle. 

&#x200B;

Nathan sat there with his hands gripped tight around the wheel of the Nissan Murano. His knuckles were white.

&#x200B;

I jumped in the back seat and counted the money in the bag. I ripped the baby mask off and it out the window. 

&#x200B;

It was an unfathomable amount of currency. The luster of the moment left me speechless. 

&#x200B;

“Can’t wait till we get to the spot,” I said to Nathan as he focused on the road and made a sharp turn around a bend. “We’re going to be sitting pretty on a beach in the Philippines drinking Red Horses.”

&#x200B;

He did not elaborate with me on the ideal outcome I had reveries of. The road became bumpier. 

&#x200B;

I leaned my head out the window. 

&#x200B;

Sparks flew out beneath the front passenger side tire.

&#x200B;

He pulled into a parking lot that had a cigar store, a computer repair place, and an eatery. He pulled the vehicle into a space and turned off the ignition.

&#x200B;

“I didn’t see any police lay out spike strips,” he said after a choke. This was the first time I had ever seen my best friend on the edge of so much emotion.

&#x200B;

“It’s because there weren’t any,” I said, dumbfounded. Our bad luck did not happen because of any red and blue flashers behind us. It was the product of a nail likely left behind after some road work by a construction crew.

&#x200B;

I put the goods in a black backpack and zipped it up. 

&#x200B;

“Let’s change into our new set of clothes,” I said. “We’ll wait at a bus stop to get to the safe house. It’s more walking than we intended, but we shouldn't get spotted. No one knows who we are.”

&#x200B;

“You’re right," he said with a nod. "We can repair this vehicle later. If my lady asks, I’ll tell her it broke down on the way to the gym.”

&#x200B;

“Good,” I said. 

&#x200B;

We followed through with the new plan. We averted and closed our eyes as we changed into fresh outfits.

 

\*

&#x200B;

We strolled down a sidewalk as evening descended. We threw our old clothes away in a random dumpster behind a museum.

&#x200B;

“Freeze, police!” 

&#x200B;

The words came out of nowhere and roared all around. I started running. 

&#x200B;

I heard the deployment of a Taser. The sound of Nathan’s grunt echoed as I leaped over a gate. With the backpack of more valuables than I could imagine, I did not focus on anything but escape.

&#x200B;

I sprinted down a side street that had nothing but the rear entrances of a few closed retail outlets. 

&#x200B;

I saw a chain link fence and climbed it. Rusty and sharp ends lined the top. I swung my legs over before collapsing on the other side. 

&#x200B;

A building that had a dome-like shape and beige exterior caught my attention. I made the split-second decision to run toward it. I circled it, huffing and sweating and exhausted but not willing to give up.

&#x200B;

I read the sign at the front of the place, even though it was completely dark on the inside. 

&#x200B;

COME ONE, COME ALL, TO THE GHASTLY PIRATE’S ARCHIPELAGO. WE ARE COMPLETE WITH ELEVEN ISLANDS TO EXPLORE IF YOU DARE!

&#x200B;

The place was a children’s theme park, or an all-ages one.

&#x200B;

I looked around and could not see anybody waiting in line. This indicated abandonment or how the park was not set up yet.

&#x200B;

I saw sirens in the background, their luminescence visible in the darkening landscape. I crossed the threshold into the seafarer-inspired makeshift amusement area.

&#x200B;

I saw an artificial harbor with a series of wooden boats on a stream of chlorinated green water. 

&#x200B;

A concrete platform sat above the estuary. A seven-foot statue stood tall, one of a stereotypical pirate complete with a beard, eye patch, and peg leg. 

&#x200B;

I did not want to use the boats at first. I realized the water in the man-made ocean was way too deep to try and swim out in search of a better hiding place. I did not dare to even try and find one in complete blackness. 

&#x200B;

I pulled out my fake gun from the underside of my coat. I planned to carry with me in the unlikely instance of a random mugging. 

&#x200B;

I used the light to navigate the controls on the actual boat once I sat in it. I pressed a red button at the front and ended up propelled upstream. I grabbed the paddles on the side to make it gain speed. The engine sounded clunky, as though its mechanisms had rusted or drowned.

&#x200B;

I made it to the first ‘island.’

&#x200B;

It was a floating stage that had rum chests covered in plastic seaweed. 

&#x200B;

I anchored the boat, stepped out, and made my way toward the crates. I opened them and found liquor.

&#x200B;

I was shaking and still suffering an adrenaline dump. The small nightcap I rewarded myself with was a welcome reprieve. 

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

The entire ride was down one long and wide corridor, with red lanterns hung near the top of the walls. While I wanted to keep imbibing, I knew that heavy drinking on the job was ill-advised. Despite the general obscurity of the area, the lights still provided adequate visibility. Each island also had queues of fake torches. Flapping papers around their wicks acted as artificial flames.

&#x200B;

The next island closest to the one I stood on had a boarded and moss-covered sign with clear lettering. There was also a pond outlined in the sand. I illuminated the board to read the words, and they said:

&#x200B;

MR. AVEDON’S LAGOON - DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT CARRION TO FEED THE SALTWATER FOE.

&#x200B;

I heard a clattering. 

&#x200B;

I pointed the fake gun in the direction of the noise. I searched the immediate perimeter for a threat. 

&#x200B;

No one was there. 

&#x200B;

My blood turned to ice as I looked down and saw a scroll. The object rolled towards my feet. I picked it up and undid the string which secured the parchment.

&#x200B;

The words, written in water-stained purple ink, left me puzzled. I reasoned it had to be an interactive and role-playing segment for the paying customers. 

&#x200B;

“Here is the game you must play, scalawag. There are six gold coins in these parts. You must find them all. Once collected, return them to the figurehead on the prow, and place the gold in her mouth as a token of gratitude. If you fail to, the beast from the depths will make calaloo out of your flesh. Hurry, and do not fail!”

&#x200B;

I dropped the scroll and considered my next steps. I then retrieved it once more, because I saw something written on the back. The statement was as follows:

&#x200B;

‘There is something within these walls stalking me. I have been here a few days already ever since the power went out. Someone or something locked the doors. All I wanted was an easy engineering job, look where it got me. If this message makes it to the outside by some miraculous chance, send help now.’

&#x200B;

I did not think much of it. I tried to think of what the optimal decision was for me as far as avoiding getting caught. I could hide out here until dawn, wait for the heat to die out.

&#x200B;

As I ruminated upon this, I saw a metal apparatus sticking out of the water next to the lagoon. 

&#x200B;

I got in the boat, paddled next to it, and lifted it by the visible bars. 

&#x200B;

It was a cage in the water. I pulled it up and found an animatronic parrot, short-circuiting with glowing eyes. Sparks flew from its beak, and its voice box was still functional, albeit glitchy. At first, it sang a sea chanty on a loop. I could not blame who dropped it since they must have done it on purpose to be free of the tune.

&#x200B;

The chirpy voice filled the ether: “Death awaits. Ca-ca-ca!”

&#x200B;

I looked at its zygodactyl feet and saw three gold coins. I clawed them through the metal and pocketed the trio. I doubted they were real, but I knew enough corrupt buyers to make it a worthwhile future inquiry.

&#x200B;

I plunged the bird’s prison back down, ridding myself of its infernal noises.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

I had to find a nook and cranny in which I could sleep. I continued moving up the river, and the third island I saw had rows of tall palm trees. There were some leafy overhangs. Still, there was nothing I could see which would hide me. I did not want to run into a potential technician, security guard, or janitor if any were on the premises.

&#x200B;

The fourth was a sandy patch of earth with a shack on it. I went inside it and saw a desk with a sword stuck in the middle of it.

&#x200B;

The fifth island had a very elaborate multi-level treehouse. Each floor had an uneven stacking. I climbed the stairs to the very top. I had a view of the entire park, each section resembling a poor man’s version of Venice. I found two more coins there.

&#x200B;

The sixth was a temple with a long set of stone steps that led up to it. Bowls of fire lined the concourses on either side. The smell of kerosene wafted past me.

&#x200B;

The seventh island had no plant life or structures. Drawn were a complex set of geometric patterns into the soil.

&#x200B;

I heard a growling from behind me. I turned around and saw a set of red eyes. The approach of the two possessed an ebullience. They were like a couple of fireflies headed towards me. 

&#x200B;

I raised my useless weapon and felt a sense of terror overcome me as I saw a set of sharp teeth clamp open.

&#x200B;

Water splashed as it lowered itself beneath the surface. I did not need any more encouragement to not take a dip.

&#x200B;

The eighth island had Greek-style figurines of a Hercules-type of hero. He wrestled with a crocodile in the illustration. 

&#x200B;

The ninth had piles of coconuts. I pushed one to the side and found faces painted on each of them.

&#x200B;

The tenth had what appeared to be a slumbering giant draped in a wolf skin coat, a mace with eroded spikes next to him. He curled into a fetal position and a blanket as a blindfold wrapped around his eyes. 

&#x200B;

The eleventh island had a single lodging. When I peered into its dust-caked windows, I saw a band's gear set up on a Persian-style carpet. Fiddles, flutes, and a rotted cherry wood concertina were there. I found the remaining coins there beside the instruments.

&#x200B;

A twelfth island came into view. This one was the smallest of all, but my mouth dropped at what I saw. Piles of human bodies, charred and bloody, were lain about like a battlefield. What appeared to be copious amounts of porcupine needles were stuck in their torsos. I reasoned they had to be mannequins, but they looked so real that I had to avert my eyes.

&#x200B;

A motionless woman with a mermaid fin came into view on a ship no bigger than an average private boat. Her body, though fish-like, held the face of a gargoyle, her mouth open in a snarl. This was, no doubt, the prow described in the scroll with the assignment.

&#x200B;

I stared down at the coins I had collected. Seeing all six of them held together made me want to keep them.

&#x200B;

I saw the red eyes again. They approached me. 

&#x200B;

I knew I could not fend off a crocodile with my bare hands. Whether it was robotic or real, my eyes could not tell, but I knew I had to run away. 

&#x200B;

I stared at the prow once more and remembered the scroll. 

&#x200B;

I slipped the coins onto the statue’s tongue, and the two crimson orbs vanished into the blackness.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

I took the boat through a tunnel made of rubies and pearls, and their glint illuminated the water. This part of the channel led me to another harbor. This one was outside. The black outlines of the city’s buildings were visible in the distance, their heights a relief to see.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

I made it to the safe house, which was a closed-down concrete batching plant. I hid the backpack in a hole we had already dug out before the heist. I covered it in the rubble. I slipped a square block of cement over it, one whose cracks blended with the rest of the flooring.

&#x200B;

I paced back and forth and, for the first time all night had the opportunity to worry about Nathan.

&#x200B;

I took a taxi home. I searched the online records of the recently incarcerated. I wanted to see what jail they took him to.

&#x200B;

What later transpired still makes me nauseous to think about to this day. We have passed the statute of limitations, so I can discuss it here. They charged Nathan with armed robbery. They tried to fluff up the inevitable conviction by throwing a ton of false accusations at him. The DA did not fall for it. The cashier stated that both the suspect and the unidentified man were polite. She said they did not even have threatening demeanors.

&#x200B;

Still, he received nine years - the max penalty for an unarmed robbery in our state, since he did not tell on me. I made sure he always had money on his books. I promised to give him a chunk of change once he got out.

&#x200B;

What I saw in that pirate theme park never left me. I always wondered what had stalked me. Three years after the fact, I did some research and met with the owner of the Archipelago. 

&#x200B;

Manny Jacobson wore a wrinkled suit and a pork pie hat. He was an old businessman who retired. Lawsuits over injuries sustained on the rides he created wore him down. He was willing to talk to me after I told him I was willing to pay him for his time. I lied about how I was writing a book on the place and other regions like it.

&#x200B;

“The place had a curse,” he said as we sat at a bistro on a Friday evening.

&#x200B;

“I’m thinking about renovating and reopening it,” I said between sips of coffee. “I liked the different motifs of each landmass. There’s one I don’t understand. What was the twelfth island supposed to be?”

&#x200B;

He looked at me as his forehead crinkled. “Son, I don’t know what you’re talking about. There wasn’t a twelfth island.”
