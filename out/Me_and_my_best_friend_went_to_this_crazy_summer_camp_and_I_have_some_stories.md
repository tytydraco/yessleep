Me and my best friend who I’ll call Jess always attended this local summer camp every year to fill up our summer break. This summer camp was fairly popular within my community, mainly because it was a summer camp only for teens around the ages of 15 til 18. Looking back now there was some weird unexplainable shit that happened at that camp and after more than 10 years I finally decided to share some of the craziest stories (with some help of Jess. Before I proceed you’ll need to know that this all happened in the early 2000s and some of the stories are from other people that attended this camp who I don’t speak to anymore so I can’t guarantee the stories are a 100% real)


- I first attended this camp when I was in my late 15s together with Jess (who was 16). She was actually the one who got me into the camp and introduced me to a lot of people since she was the more outgoing friend. She introduced me to this one guy who i’ll call Peter. Peter was this nerdy 16 year old guy, really geeky for the 2000s but nonetheless that he was a really nice guy. A few days later after we met there were these rumors he went out in the forest alone for a walk, after a day he didn’t return and we all grew very concerned about him, since he said he was going for a short walk. Now, this camp was located somewhere in a forest near my hometown, there was barely to none connection we could get with our bricky phones of that time so there was no way in contacting Peter. The councils eventually had to call the local police station for a search party to find him in these miles of forest surrounding the camp. Another 3 or 4 days passed and the police had found no record of him at all, until we all saw Peter casually walking up to the campsite. Everyone was in total shock how he casually came up walking to the campsite after missing for a whole week. The police started asking him questions about where he was in this past week and he was utterly confused. From what I’ve heard from Jess later the same night he returned was that he could remember vividly he walked for an hour through that forest but doesn’t have any memories that he was missing for an entire week. He was picked up by his parents the next day and no one ever saw him again at camp. Me, Jess and some other campers of that year were bugged for the rest of the camp, wondering what the fuck happened to him in that week and how it only felt like an hour for Peter.

(Note: Mind you this all happened in the same Summer Camp and Forest. This forest is infamous in my hometown where many crazy shit happened. It’s also a fairly big one for a small hometown like mine)
