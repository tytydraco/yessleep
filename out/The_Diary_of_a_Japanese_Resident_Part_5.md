This is Hiroshi Nakamura. Three days have passed since my last post. I’ve been forced to leave the apartment. Not because I wanted to, but because I had no choice. The food ran out two days ago, and the rain hasn’t let up since. Hunger gnawed at me until I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I waited until nightfall to move not because it was safer, but because it felt like the darkness might hide me better.

The city is worse than I imagined. It’s not just empty; it’s *wrong*. The buildings loom like monoliths, their windows dark and watching. The rain pools in the cracks of the pavement, carrying with it an unbearable stench of decay. Every step I took felt like a mistake, the water soaking into my shoes, chilling me to the bone. The air felt alive, pressing against my skin like an unseen force, as if the city itself was aware of my presence.

The rain has brought out more than just decay. I saw them parasites larger than anything I could have imagined, moving grotesquely in the water. Their forms twisted and wriggled beneath the surface of puddles and drains, dark and serpentine. The way they moved was hypnotic, almost mesmerizing, but there was something deeply wrong about their rhythm, their fluid, unnatural motions. It was as though they were searching for something, spreading and contaminating every droplet they touched.

Last night, I saw what salt does. The comment “I wonder if salt would deter these beasts?” from a user named kiwichick286 had been circling in my mind for days, a whisper of hope wrapped in desperation. It stayed with me as I ventured out, clutching what little salt I had left. I didn’t think I’d use it, but when I saw the figure near the storm drain, hunched and trembling, the words of that comment pushed me to act.

The figure was a man, or at least he had been. His skin glistened with rain, and his movements were jerky, unnatural. He was scooping water from the drain, letting it flow through his fingers as though searching for something. His head twitched violently, snapping to the side every few seconds, as if he were fighting an invisible force. I called out, quietly at first, but he didn’t respond. When I stepped closer, the flashlight beam caught the black, writhing shapes beneath his translucent skin.

I threw the salt. The reaction was immediate. His body convulsed violently, his head snapping back as a guttural, animalistic screech tore from his throat. The parasites tiny, threadlike creatures erupted from his skin, spilling onto the wet ground. They writhed and squirmed, desperate to escape the salt’s touch. For a moment, I thought it was over.

But then he turned toward me. His eyes were wide and bloodshot, his mouth gaping open as more parasites poured out. He lunged. I threw the rest of the salt, and the parasites burst from his mouth, ears, and eyes, falling like black ribbons onto the pavement. They wriggled toward the nearest puddle, disappearing into the water. I ran. I didn’t stop until I was back inside, slamming the door behind me.

Now I understand. It’s not a virus. It’s not a curse. It’s parasites. Microscopic and insidious, they infest the water and take control of their hosts. The salt doesn’t deter them; it forces them out. But it also enrages them. Whatever these things are, they’re part of the water, spreading with every drop. They’re inescapable.

I stayed in the apartment for another day, but I couldn’t stay any longer. The rain is relentless, and the whispers the ones I thought were in my head are louder now. They seep through the pipes, the walls, carried by the water. Last night, I thought I heard my name, whispered faintly, coming from the bathroom drain. I locked the door, but the sound didn’t stop. It’s everywhere now.

When I left the apartment again, I noticed something strange about the infected. The rain seemed to put them into a trance. They wandered aimlessly, their movements slow and dreamlike, their heads tilted upward as if they were basking in the rain. It was terrifying and surreal, but it also gave me hope. If the rain kept them occupied, maybe it was the safest time to move.

But when the rain stops, everything changes. Two nights ago, during a brief pause in the downpour, I saw them again. They moved differently faster, more erratic, their heads twitching as though searching for something. I watched one of them approach a corpse lying in the middle of the street. It crouched down, and something long and black spilled from its mouth, sliding into the corpse’s open mouth. The body twitched, convulsed, and then went still. A few moments later, it rose.

The new host staggered upright, its movements stiff and jerky. The first infected stood back, tilting its head as if admiring its work. Then both of them wandered off, their bodies glistening with rain. I stayed hidden, trembling, until they were gone.

Now I’m writing this from an old internet cafe I found while searching for supplies. The power is intermittent, but the connection is barely holding. The streets are a nightmare. The rain has turned them into rivers of filth, and every shadow feels alive. I saw something in the puddles earlier a shape that moved against the current, dark and serpentine. I don’t think it saw me, but I ran anyway.

Earlier, I passed an alley filled with abandoned bicycles, their frames twisted and rusted. A foul-smelling liquid pooled beneath them, bubbling as if alive. I avoided it, but the sight of it stayed with me. What happens when the parasites find something else to infest? Could they move beyond water? The thought chills me more than the rain ever could.

I’m heading to Chiba. The rumors about the military convoy are the only hope I have left. But I don’t know if I’ll make it. The streets are filled with abandoned cars, their windows shattered, their interiors stained. The bodies are gone, but the signs of struggle remain. And the whispers... they’re not just voices. They’re a presence, pressing against my thoughts, making it harder to think clearly. It feels like they’re guiding me, pushing me toward something I can’t see.

As I write this, the rain has started again. The sound of it hitting the pavement feels like a death knell. The puddles are growing, and I can see movement in them now. Small ripples, like something is just beneath the surface. Waiting. Watching. Once, I thought I saw a hand break the surface, skeletal and clawed, before it disappeared back into the water. I don’t know if it was real or if my mind is unraveling.

I don’t know if I’ll make it to Chiba, but I have to try. The alternative is staying here, waiting for the rain to seep into every crack and crevice, carrying the parasites with it. I can’t let that happen. If the military is there, maybe they have answers. Maybe they have a way to stop this.

If you’re reading this, know that the water isn’t safe. The parasites are real, and they’re everywhere. Stay cautious around the rain it keeps the infected subdued, but the water is alive with parasites, waiting to spread. Stay away from the drains. And if you see them... don’t use salt unless you’re ready to face what lies beneath. Salt doesn’t save you. It only shows you the truth.

The rain is getting heavier. The whispers are louder now, almost a chorus. I have to move. If this is my last post, remember this: the water is awake. It’s watching. And it’s waiting.
