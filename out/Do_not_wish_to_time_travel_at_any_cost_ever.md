 It was a dark and stormy night, and Jane had just finished a long shift at the hospital. She was exhausted, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. As she drove home, the rain pounded against her windshield, making it hard to see. Suddenly, she heard a loud thud and felt her car shake. She had hit something.

Panicked, Jane pulled over to the side of the road and got out of her car. It was pitch black and she could barely see a few feet in front of her. She called out, hoping whoever she had hit was okay, but there was no response. She fumbled in the darkness, trying to find her phone so she could call for help, but it was nowhere to be found.

As she searched, she heard a strange noise behind her. She turned around and saw a figure standing in the rain, but she couldn't make out any details. It was as if the figure was surrounded by a thick fog.

"Who are you?" Jane called out, her voice shaking. "What do you want?"

There was no response. The figure just stood there, seeming to watch her. Jane's heart raced as she backed away, trying to get back to her car. She tripped and fell to the ground, scraping her knees on the rough asphalt.

As she scrambled to get up, she felt a hand on her shoulder. She screamed and thrashed, trying to escape the grip, but it was too strong. She was lifted to her feet and turned to face the figure.

And that's when she saw it. The face was twisted and grotesque, with glowing red eyes and a mouth full of sharp teeth. It was a creature from her worst nightmares, and it was standing right in front of her.

Jane's mind raced as she tried to think of a way to escape. She remembered something her grandfather had told her when she was a child: "If you're ever in trouble, just close your eyes and wish for the time to reverse. It might not work, but it's worth a try."

Jane closed her eyes and wished with all her might for the time to reverse. She felt a sudden jolt, and when she opened her eyes, she was back in her car. It was still raining, but the storm seemed to have passed. She looked in the rearview mirror and saw the figure was gone.

She breathed a sigh of relief and started the car. As she drove home, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was still off. When she got home, she went to bed, hoping to forget the terrifying experience.

But the next morning, when she woke up, she found herself back on the side of the road, with the creature standing in front of her. She realized that she was trapped in some kind of time loop, reliving the same terrifying moment over and over again.

She closed her eyes and wished for the time to reverse, hoping to escape the nightmare. But no matter how many times she tried, she couldn't break free. She was trapped in the darkness, with the creature standing in front of her, forever.
