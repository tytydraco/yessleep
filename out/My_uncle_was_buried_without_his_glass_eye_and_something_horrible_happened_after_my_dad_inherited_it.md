In his will, Uncle Kenneth insisted upon his artificial eye being removed prior to burial, so my father could keep it on the mantelpiece above the fireplace.

I was terrified of that dead man’s eye.

*It’s not an eye*, I attempted to reassure myself. *Look at it. It’s a prosthesis. A crafted piece of glass.*

That didn’t make it any less real. Any less terrifying. Even when I reduced it to a hollow hemisphere marked with a brown iris. And, regardless of where I stood in the living room, the horrid thing always seemed to be watching me.

But I was right; it wasn’t an eye.

It was something far worse.

My father was bullied by Kenneth, his older brother, when they were children. Quite mercilessly, judging from the stories I’ve been told. But Dad seemed to dismiss the fact that Kenneth continued to be an abusive wretch in adult life.

When I was a child, Grandma’s wake was held at Uncle Kenneth’s house, and Mum “interfered” by daring to step into the kitchen, hoping to help prepare the food. My uncle seized her arm firmly, leaving red, finger-shaped contusions on her skin. They didn’t fade for days.

I was standing in the kitchen doorway, sobbing profusely, and my uncle instructed me to look away—to “close my eyes” if I hadn’t the stomach for “adult disagreements”. He often called me a soft touch.

Put simply, Kenneth was cruel. He and Mum never got along. Only Dad tolerated him, and that must’ve been a result of childhood trauma.

Shortly after the funeral in October, as we were housing my uncle’s worldly possessions, Mum confided in me that her brother-in-law clearly wanted to continue punishing us after death.

She said, “There’s no better torture than to leave behind a false eye to watch us from the afterlife.”

And there was no facetiousness to her tone.

My fear started at a slow crawl. It was one of those barely burgeoning dreads; a terror so slight and hard to pinpoint that it feels almost imaginary. You know the type.

The upstairs creak that you know to simply be the house settling.

The itch at the back of your neck that comes from a draft.

The sudden jolt in your chest, at the dead of night, when you kid yourself into thinking that the clothes towering atop your bedroom chair might really be a person—an intruder who sits and watches you in the dark.

The shiver down your spine when the glass eye sitting on your family’s mantelpiece seems to be rotating of its own accord.

Seems to follow you around the room.

One evening, three or four months after my uncle’s funeral, I’d finally had enough. Mum, Dad, and I were watching TV in the living room, and I plucked up the courage to ask something.

“Dad…” I took a deep breath, then continued. “How would you feel about moving Uncle Kenneth’s eye to… another room?”

He grumbled, “Please, Cam… I’ve already gone through this with your mother. My brother made a simple request. It’s not too much for us to honour that.”

“It was a *sadistic* request,” Mum finally piped up, after weeks and weeks of silence on the matter. “Why on Earth did Kenneth want his glass eye to sit on our mantelpiece in full view? How is that a kind and loving thing to ask of his brother? I wasn’t asking you to get rid of it. I just think we should store it in the attic with all of his disturbing occult books and—”

“*Enough, both of you!*” Dad interrupted rigidly, voice sounding hoarse. “I just want the three of us to sit here, relax, and enjoy the film.”

*I’d enjoy it more if we weren’t being watched*, I thought, shivering at the glass shell surveying me from the mantelpiece.

Of course, I didn’t say that aloud, as I was keen not to rock the boat. Grief is an entanglement of complex emotions. Dad was delicate, and I didn’t want to break him. I don’t know whether he’d have responded with tears or rage if Mum and I had pushed him on the topic, but either reaction would have spoilt the night. Still, there was something I didn’t fully process at the time. Something I registered but only analysed in retrospect.

There had been an unsteadiness to Dad’s demeanour.

He’d been evasive whilst Mum and I pressed him about the eye watching us from its perch above the fireplace. He’d been averting his gaze from it.

When I think back to those early months following Uncle Kenneth’s passing, I remember Dad spending each evening with his eyes firmly locked on the television. He had been stiff and distant whenever we were sitting in the lounge. And I understand now.

He, too, was frightened of Uncle Kenneth’s glass eye.

But it wasn’t until March of this year that I realised this went beyond our sensitive imaginations.

Close to midnight, I was woken by creaking outside my bedroom door; my parents’ house is Victorian, and the floorboards buckle loudly under people’s weight. I tilted my sleepy head to look at the slim crack below my bedroom door. Light was spilling from the upstairs landing, and the shadows of two feet shuffled left and right on the other side of my door.

It was as if somebody were giddily bouncing from one foot to the other.

“Hello…?” I meagrely called out.

In response, the two shades slipped quickly out of view, accompanied by shuffling creaks.

I lay there in a state of paralysis, waiting for the clamp on my chest to ease. Something felt wrong. But I was tired, so I didn’t trust my fearful mind. Didn’t trust my incoherent thoughts. I eventually managed to calm myself down and return to sleep.

“*Keep those eyes closed, Cam*.”

Hours later, I woke to those five words.

Words whispered in the voice of my mother.

My eyes shot open in fear, and I turned to face the now-open door to my bedroom, which revealed a dim hallway beyond. My mother was standing just beyond the threshold to my room, lurking in the black. She was little more than a faint outline before my eyes managed to adjust to the dark, but I saw a glint—an island of moonlight shining from the shade of her face.

The floorboards groaned under her weight, and my mother growled, “*I said to keep them closed, Camille.*”

My stomach lurched. Everything was wrong, and it didn’t feel like a dream anymore—didn’t feel like an exhausted mind misinterpreting its surroundings. This was not the creak of an old house settling. Was not a pile of clothes that looked like a person in the dark.

This was real.

*Mum always calls me Cam*, I thought fearfully as my mind started to wake up.

I sat upright in bed, squinting to make her out. “Why are you…”

I was midway through my sentence, and reaching for the lamp on my bedside table, when my mother rapidly shook her head from side to side. “*Don’t do it.*”

And then, as she took a step forwards, my throat closed in terror. I was starting to discern more than just her silhouette; I’d spotted the blood on her hands.

My head lightened as I forgot to breathe.

“Mum…?” I wheezed.

She smiled. “*No.*”

“Where’s Dad?” I croaked.

My mother lifted her blood-stained hands, wafting them in the dim moonlight, which glistened off the red.

“Papa felt guilty, Camille,” Mum whispered, creeping towards me; I gripped the edge of my duvet in fear. “Felt guilty because he abandoned his poor brother. He never visited. Never even called. Kenneth was all alone in that house, crying out for help. Do you know how it feels to be paralysed in one half of the body? Your poor uncle lay on the bedroom floor, moaning and slurring weakly for somebody to save him, but nobody came. They didn’t find his body for days, Camille. *Days*.”

I gulped. “Mum, I don’t understand… Why are your hands covered in—”

“I hated your father my whole life,” she whispered. “He was the death of me. He’s the death of everything strong and pure. That weak sack of worms should never have been allowed to breed.”

As my mother stepped into the doorway and the light caught more of her skin, I screamed. The right-hand side of her face was covered in deep cuts, bruises, and still-flowing streaks of fresh blood.

And the source of that glint finally became horribly clear.

*My mother’s eye had been replaced with Uncle Kenneth’s glass prosthesis.*

“This will all be over quickly,” she whispered, creeping closer to me.

I knew it wasn’t Mum at all.

I squeezed my eyes shut, just as Kenneth had always told me to do. Trembled in silence as the footsteps came closer. But then the floorboards stopped creaking, and I became aware of a not-so-distant police siren.

The thing in my mother’s skin snarled disapprovingly, then rapidly fled, bare feet thudding against the floorboards.

I opened my eyes to find my room empty. There was the sound of scurrying down the stairs, then the back door closing.

It seems that a neighbour had heard sounds of commotion and phoned the police. The more I think about it, the more I remember hearing loud thuds and strange sounds in my dream—I must’ve been dwelling in that place halfway been sleep and reality. Strange that the thing to fully wake me had been those quiet words.

“*Keep those eyes closed, Cam*.”

“I want to see my dad,” I weakly told the police officer.

He shared a concerned look with his fellow officer, then said, “Camille, we’ve… You’re in shock. I don’t know how to… I don’t know how to tell you this again.”

The second police officer took over. “Your father is dead.”

And then it all came flooding back to me. The blood. So much blood.

I started bawling, and screaming, and releasing a myriad of unintelligible words. That night’s all a little blurry in my memory. The past two months have been a little blurry.

I want to tell the police that my father’s killer wasn’t my mother, but they would section me—*I* want to section myself. The truth is impossible: my dead uncle possessed my mother to kill his brother. And God knows where he’s taken her. I have so many questions with, no doubt, terrifying answers.

How did he come back?

Is my mother still alive somewhere in that head, or is it all him now?

Is he done with [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)?
