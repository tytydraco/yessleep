I often wake up in the "deep night." That's what I call the dead hours from 3 to 5 in the morning, when the whole world is engulfed in darkness and not a soul crosses the streets.

I wake up trembling. In the first moments I don't know where I am, I look around frantically, scream, throw the pillows. Then I remember and collapse exhausted into the sheets, drenched with cold sweat. I wait for my breath to calm down, staring at the dark ceiling.

Do you want a story? Or rather... a warning.

Here is my chilling warning.



My name is Bill Cosby. I'm a boring guy. An accountant. My colleagues at the office and I had a tradition—we somehow get through the week and on Friday night we're at "The Goat". "The Goat" is a ramshackle concrete building, suspiciously resembling an old gas station. So old that it once leaned on one side and no one bothered to repair it, and instead of a roof, One-Armed had arranged tin sheets borrowed from some construction site.



We started going to 'The Goat' because it was the only place serving original Czech beer. At least that's what One-Armed said, and we didn't particularly doubt him. The beer was good. Later, we found out that One-Armed was making it himself in some vats in the back room. Even later, he started making whiskey, which was also good, and so we named it The Czech.



The tradition was as follows—our working hours were until 7, but by 6:30, we were already sitting at our table in 'The Goat.' By 8, we had chugged the beer, which went perfectly well with two beef burgers, and then we would make One-Armed bring out The Czech. With it, me and the other old, experienced colleagues at the firm would make it until around 1, while the newbies would leave by 10. Considering all of this, the hardest part was getting home. First, after drinking 2-3 liters of beer and mixing it with 6-7 double Czech’s, walking would become a challenge. Second, the path passed by the old cemetery. My story, dear reader, starts on one such traditional evening. Since then, we haven't gathered, and I haven't set foot in 'The Goat' again.



I was quite hammered, so there was no chance I’d drive. I didn't want to get in Pete's car either, who allegedly 'drove even better when tipsy,' so I waved goodbye to the guys and staggered along the desolate path. On the left, lay the road, which I gradually moved away from. On the right, stretched the old cemetery. Above, the moon shone cruelly. Below, the dirt and rocks waltzed under my feet, making me sick.



Gradually, the clamor from 'The Goat' died down, and I sank into the silence of the night. Cool air, soaked with the damp smell of the forest, wafted from the cemetery. Over the years, no one had bothered to clean it up, and besides oblivion, it was also overtaken by firs and pines. Here and there, crumbling tombstones sprouted between the wet tree trunks like mushrooms. A thin mist crept over the needle-covered ground.



The beer took its toll, and before my bladder could burst, I stopped to pee. I went to the nearby pine tree and was just letting out a blissful stream when I spotted something. Were those the outlines of a person? Or branches? My back prickled. My brain wouldn’t accept what my eyes were seeing. It's like you're home and on your way to the bathroom in the middle of the night, you catch a glimpse of terrifying shapes out of the corner of your eye. But in the hallway at home, when you look at the monster, it turns out to be a play of shadows.



Here, the thing was staring at me with its button-like black eyes. It looked like a tree that had uprooted itself and wandered through the forest. With a human figure, but instead of skin and bones, its arms and body were made of dried, intertwined roots. Shaggy black hair hung down to its shoulders, from which a white rag resembling a nightgown dangled. It smiled at me with crooked, broken yellow teeth.

My entire mind yelled, “Dead! This thing is dead!”

And it wanted me!



I screamed. My stiff legs refused to move. An icy gust of wind shook the branches, and the creature charged at me.

'No, please, no!'

I managed only to turn around and then fell on to the dirt of the path. Two sturdy hands grabbed me by the collar and dragged me back towards the forest. I dug my feet into the ground with all my might, and my heels plowed the soft soil. I twisted and jumped like a trout, my hands grasping at branches and stones, but my torn fingers couldn’t hold onto anything.

'Let me go!' I screamed. 'Let me go! What do you want!?'

It was pulling me with such ferocity that I left a groove in the needle carpet. A human being can't drag you like that. I'm telling you! That wasn’t a human; it was something far removed from us. To it, I was prey, an animal. And it was dragging me to slaughter. Or at least that's what I thought at the time.



Nobody believed me about what happened next. Hell, nobody believed me about the creature either. My friends laughed at me and said I had guzzled the Czech like a thirsty pig and dragged myself home through the gutter. But I've always had a light drunkenness. I’d whistle, I’d sing, but I'd never return home looking like a beaten dog. And I know what I saw.



To hell with my friends! I am telling this story to warn you, reader. Believe if you will, but at least listen.

The creature dragged me for at least half an hour, and when it stopped, we found ourselves next to a huge bonfire. The flames leaped up to the tops of the pines, spewing heat in waves and roaring like a hurricane. I lay exhausted in the wet soil, shielding my face with my hand from the blinding light. There... there was someone. In the fire. Human figures, jumping, waving. They were dancing. They looked so carefree, so happy. How could someone dance and not be happy? They sang and waved at me to join.



Oh, reader! If only there was someone to witness! To witness what happened to me! It was as if time had stopped still. I was numb with fear, but I wanted to go and my feet led me to the fire. And behold—the first step into the flames did not hurt me. Its tongues caressed me, enveloped me, pushed me inward, and the searing coals did not burn me. The figures danced, and I danced with them, and the flames played with us.



They were undead! All of them, to the last one! And high above, where the flames licked the sky, instead of black smoke, something whitish, like fog, rose towards the watching moon. Then I understood—I was in a trance. My body did not obey me, and in the meantime, my soul was being lifted from me. We danced, we sang, and we reveled, and above us, our souls howled and laughed at us. I didn't know if I was alive or dead. We gathered in the center of the fire, and it seemed like the time had come.



Suddenly, something happened. I swear, to this day I don't know what, reader. Some sort of skirmish or fight that made the undead take their eyes off me. I got lucky! My soul returned to me, and I seized the moment and bolted. I ran as if hell was chasing me. The wind whistled in my ears, branches lashed at me, but I dared not stop or look back.



I remember my burning lungs, my pounding heart, and the nightmare of shadows I flew through. How I got home, reader—I don't know. I woke up in my bed, with the cold morning light streaming through the open curtains.

To this day, I still don’t know why they let me go. But I will never dance again. Not until I dance with the dead!
