It was now October, and Markus and I were planning on going to a Halloween party.  I tried to get Elijah to join, but he said he wasn't a party person. So before we left, we all went out together. We went to some shitty restaurant that had the worst reviews we could find.

“It’s nice to finally hang out with you,” Elijah said. 

“Yeah,” Markus said leaning against the booth.

“How did you guys meet?”. Elijah asked.

“Oh Markus and I met in elementary school, we’ve been best friends since.”.

“I can tell, you guys seem really close.” He said smiling

“Yeah, I mean, we spent most of our lives together, I mean before Billie decided to quit.” Markus smirked. 

“Yeah, sorry, I guess I got greedy, it wasn't because the place burned down or anything.”  I scoffed.

“I’ll let it slide.”

“Yeah, I never got the full story, what happened?” Elijah said sipping on his glass of water

“I don’t really want to talk about it.” I said twirling my straw around in my drink. I looked down at my hands.

“So you live alone, girlfriend?” Markus asked.

“Yeah no, sorry man. I live alone.” He smiled. “But you’re welcome to move in.”  Elijah winked. 

“Hey, I mean I am single.” Markus smiled.

“I thought you two were dating?”

 No, we're just friends,” Markus said. 

Elijah smiled a little. “Ah, got it.”

We talked for a few hours more before we realized we had to get going. Markus and I went back to my place, and Elijah back to his. We relaxed in my room for a little, before we got ready. I did his face paint after he dressed, and he helped get my hair curlers on. I started to put my shoes on when I felt like I was being watched, but it was just Markus he was kinda just staring off into space. 

“Markus you good? Markus?” I waved my hand. 

He looked at me. “Sorry.”. 

“You alright?” 

“Yeah, I'm fine.” He said before staring off again. 

“You sure?”

“Yeah, it’s nothing.” 

I looked down at my watch.

“Oh shit, we’re late..” 

I threw on my costume and took out the hair curlers. “How I look?” I asked. 

“Like shit, how about me?” He said, giving a little spin.

 “I ’ve seen better.”.

“Let’s go.” He said grudgingly. 

By the time we got there, the street was so full we had to park down a few streets. When we walked in everyone was already watching a movie, but Markus walked right to the alcohol cabinet in the kitchen. I sat on the couch in the back, tossing candy in my mouth from time to time. Markus and I talked to some of our old friends, though Markus couldn’t really have a simple conversation to save his life. At this point, I was convinced he was an alcoholic. 

He’d been starting to drink more recently. I was getting worried. After the movie, we had a vote for what we wanted to watch next. We landed on a Scream, which I was extremely happy about, but the whole time I just felt a sense of uneasiness.  All the screams and stabbing sounds didn’t help too much. I closed my eyes putting my hands to my face. I felt like the whole room was watching me. It was too hard for me to focus on the movie so I eventually just left the room.

Alone in the kitchen, I searched for a drink and eventually found some hot chocolate packets and promptly made myself a cup. I walked outside and sat on the front porch. It was a little chilly, but the air felt nice on my face. I closed my eyes and tried to relax, but I couldn’t. I felt like I was still lying on the harsh pavement outside the store. I could hear the sounds of fire all around me. “What is wrong with me?” I said to myself. I spent the rest of the party sitting alone on the porch. It was quite depressing. I was looking forward to this party for so long, and I just wasted it out on the porch.

I looked up. The street lights were dim and would flicker from time to time. I stood up to go on a small when someone told me  Markus passed out from drinking, I felt ecstatic. I walked inside and helped him up I rushed us out, not even saying goodbye. When we got to the car Markus was mumbling under his breath. He did this the entire time, it was a little annoying, but I kept the radio off, not wanting to make his headache worse. When we got to his place. He just sat there. I looked at him, he could barely keep his eyes open. 

“Do you need me to walk with you?”.

“Yeah,” he mumbled.

I opened the car door and walked him inside. His mom was already sleeping so I had to try my best to take him to his room silently. I carefully closed his bedroom door and took him to his bathroom. I wiped off his face paint before pushing him to bed. 

“Thanks.” he slurred.

“It’s fine,” I said, sitting next to him. 

“You're a great friend.”

“I try.” I shrugged, then looked at him.

He bit his lip staring at the wall above him. He turned to me. 

“I’m gonna get you something to wear,” I said walking over to his closet. 

He sat up as I looked through his closet and landed on the ugliest fucking shirt I’ve ever seen. I tossed it to him. He grabbed it and threw it on.

“Can you toss me some shorts?” He asked. 

“Dude, I'm not your nurse.”.

“Ugh.” He started to stand up. 

“No, no I was joking,” I said, opening his drawer. I pulled out a pair of shorts. I passed it to him before turning around. Looking at his room I noticed a small pink envelope lying on top of his dresser. I picked it up. My heart sank. I couldn’t feel anything Inside. 

“Yeah, I got that this morning.” He said laying his head on the pillow. 

“Can I open it?”.

“Go for it.”.

I tore open the envelope and looked inside. It was a normal letter, from the hospital, breast cancer awareness. I let out a sigh of relief. I walked back to the bed, sitting at the end, I dragged my hands across my face and hung my head looking at the paint-stained rug below me. We sat in silence for a bit. He sat up and rested next to me. 

“ I..I.”  He bit his lip stopping himself. 

“Is there something wrong?” I asked. I looked up at him. He seemed stressed.

He looked at me, before leaning over and kissing me. He instantly pulled back, his eyes wide open. 

“I, I’m sorry I’m sorry!” He said.

I looked at him.  I didn’t know what to do. My face felt hot, I just froze in shock. 

“I’m sorry.” He said, clasping his hand to his face. He turned away from me. “It was stupid I'm sorry.”

“You’re just drunk, it's ok.”

He shook his head before looking back at me. “No, I just..” He stopped his words, slurring a bit. “It’s not because I'm drunk, I’ve felt this way for a while.” He hung his head. “ I'm sorry.”.

“Markus, you don’t have to be sorry,” I said, as stood up. Markus laid down and I tossed the blankets over him.

“I’m sorry,”

I smiled at him warmly. “It’s ok.” 

He nodded. “Please don’t hate me.” He said.

 I shook my head. “I could never hate you, Markus.”

He smiled at me weakly.

“I’ll talk to you tomorrow ok?” I asked

“Ok.” 

I closed the door and walked out to my car. The drive back to my house was anything but relaxing, all I could hear was my heart pumping in my chest. I couldn’t wipe the smile off my face, I kept replaying the incident in my head. When I got home, I didn’t want to get out. I just wanted to sit there and play his kiss over and over, but I knew I needed to go inside. My parents talked with me for a while. I said I had a good time, and promised that I drove safely. I didn’t tell them about the kiss, I knew my dad would have a heart attack or something. 

I went up to my room and folded some laundry before turning off the light and getting into bed. A few hours later I woke up to Markus calling me. I let it ring, as I figured he forgot to turn off his automatic call and that he was sleeping, but he called again so I slowly walked over, rubbing my eyes. I picked up, his lights were off, and he wasn’t sitting anywhere in sight. I squinted a bit, looking at the screen, trying to see what he was doing.

I noticed he was lying in bed. I didn’t want to be a creep, so I was about to hang up when I heard him say something. I heard him say my name. His breaths were shaky and quiet. I just figured he was sleep-talking. With curiosity getting the best of me, I got nosey and listened, I wish I had just hung up. As I listened longer, I felt vomit curl up my throat. He was touching himself. I slammed the computer, ran to my bathroom trash can, and vomited everything I had eaten that day. I could hear him call me over and over. 

I kept getting sick until I didn't have anything to puke up. Eventually, he stopped calling me, I felt so disgusting, I felt like my skin was crawling away from my flesh. We had grown up together, how could he do this? We trusted each other with our lives. After all, we’ve been through together, he just treated me like an object. I felt vulnerable and stupid. I broke into tears and spent the rest of the night sitting alone on the cold tiles of my bathroom floor.  I never told my parents, I didn’t want to deal with my mother's condescending lessons, and her looks of disappointment.

Soon after my call with Markus,  I started having night terrors. Not just nightmares but something else, something in the real world. It’s like when you're in the process of falling asleep and you wake up to someone calling your name or saying something when you know no one else is home. It started as that then the feeling of someone standing over me then it got physical. I started waking up feeling like someone else was in my bed. This felt different, it felt real, and it didn't stop right as I woke up, I would be lying there for minutes convinced someone was behind me in my bed.

One night I woke up feeling like someone was breathing on the back of my neck, terrified I whipped around, but I was alone in my room. I didn’t know what to do, I tried listening to music, using sleeping pills, keeping the lights on, sleeping on the couch but nothing ever made it stop. It just kept getting worse. I would wake up to someone stroking my hair, rubbing my back, or grabbing at me. It didn’t help that Markus kept trying to contact me. I just silenced all his calls and texts, hiding from him at work, I told my parents to tell him I wasn't home. They asked what was wrong, but I just told them we got into a fight. I couldn’t stand to tell them, I still cared for him, but I just couldn’t let what he did go.

It was inhuman. It hurt to think how many times he could have done this, and it hurt that someone that I put so much trust in would treat me like I was nothing, that I was just something he could use for his pleasure. I started to sleep less and less. Keeping myself awake by any means necessary. I stopped going out, afraid someone would do something to me.  I was starting to become more forgetful, I hadn’t texted anyone for months. Since Elijah was a regular he came all the time, but I couldn’t talk to him. I was too scared to, scared he would be mad at me or something, I didn't know what I was afraid of but I avoided him at all costs until he caught me leaving work. 

“Billie!” Elijah yelled. 

I turned to him. He looked at me with a mix of frustration and relief.

“Billie, what’s going on with you?”

“Nothing, just go.”

He walked up to me and grabbed my hand preventing me from getting in my car. 

“Billie, talk to me, please.” He looked at me empathetically.

I jerked my hand back. “I’ve just been sleeping badly,” I said, crossing my arms.

“You’ve been ignoring me and Markus, because of bad sleep?”

“No, no, I...I, it’s personal.”

“I’m sorry, I’m just worried.” 

“ I’m sorry I’ve been avoiding you. I just… ” I looked away. 

“Did something happen?” He asked

“No, no”.

“Have you told your parents?.” 

I shook my head. “No, no, it’s fine.”

“I don’t trust you.”

I turned away and got into my car. “I’m sorry. Goodbye.” 

“Can we talk, at my place?” He asked rushingly.

“No..I.”

“You’re right I’m sorry, what about over coffee?”

“I don’t know.” I looked down at my car.

“You need to talk to someone, and I’m here, just meet me at 5:00, at Donnie’s ok?”

(Donnie’s was a nice restaurant in town, well that wasn't the real name of the place but still.) I nodded and closed the door behind me. I pulled out of the parking lot leaving Elijah alone. A few hours later I got ready for lunch. I walked downstairs and told my parents I would be out with Elijah. My mom told me to be safe and to be aware of my surroundings, her anxiety didn’t help mine. 

I drove down to Donnie’s and parked around the back. I sat on my phone until Elijah walked up to my car. We walked inside together and sat at the booth by the door. We made small talk for a while before he eventually asked me what was going on with me. I told him about my sleeping problems, and how I wake up with what feels like people in my bed. He stayed silent, listening with a serious face. He put a hand on mine.

“I’m sorry, I understand why you didn’t want to tell me, and I’m sorry I undermined your issues earlier.” 

I balled my fist but ultimately didn’t pull it away. “Thank you,” I said, looking at my hands. 

“I had sleeping problems for a while too, I used to just read books until I fell asleep, I still have a bunch if you want to borrow any.”

“Sure, I’ve already read all my books anyway.” 

He smiled. “We can walk over to my place quickly and grab ‘em.” 

My face turned slightly sour. “I’m not sure.” 

He took a sip of his coffee. “Oh, it’ll be so quick, you don’t even need to come inside, I’ll just grab them for you.”

Eventually, I gave in, he paid for dinner and we walked over to his apartment, it was right down the street so it was only like a two-minute walk. He typed in the code at the front door and walked inside. We walked up a few flights upstairs until we reached his apartment. I could see the outline of where the number seven once hung. I looked at it a little confused. 

“Oh yeah, they’re numbered backward.” He said laughing a little. 

He pulled out his keys and opened the door. It was surprisingly really nice. Like actually decorated, with furniture that matched. I walked inside. It looked like a Pinterest dream. I walked into his living room, and the first thing I noticed was his bookshelf, it covered almost the whole wall. I tried to read the titles, some of them ranging from children's books to textbooks about psychology.

He walked to his tv where he had a small record player placed on the table underneath. I pulled out some vinyl and turned the player on. He bobbed his head slightly as he searched through his shelves and pulled out three books. He passed them to me. 

“I think you would like these, you want anything else?” 

He noticed my awe in his collection. 

“Yeah, it’s a bit of a mess sorry…Never really got the time to organize everything.”

I grabbed one from the shelf. Value of human life. I looked up at him with my brow slightly raised. He turned to me still nodding his head to the music slightly. He leaned against the wall.

“What is something wrong with my collection?” He asked with a smirk.

“No no, you just don't seem like the”

“Intelligent type?” He said.

“The psychological or deeper meaning book type.”

“Sorry to disappoint.” He smiled.

I laughed and placed the books on the table beside me. Next to them, I saw a small folder. I looked at it, it looked like a police report.

 I was about to pick it up  when Elijah spoke up “Jeez, it’s already getting dark, it always catches me off guard when the sun begins to set so early, I’ll think it's 10 at night, and I'll look at my phone, and  it’s only like 6 or something.”

I looked up at him. “Yeah, I feel like I always wake up easier when it’s bright outside, convinces my brain it's later.”

“That makes sense.” He said. He paused looking at me. The warm light of his lamp made his dark eyes look bright orange. “Well, you should probably get going, since it’s getting late.”

I nodded my head a little “You're probably right.” I said.  “Thanks for the books.”

“No problem really…Oh, and you don’t have to give them back when you're done, I don’t need them, need some room for new books.”

 I nodded and picked up the books off the table trying to get another glance at the folder, but I couldn’t make anything out. We said goodbye and I walked out of his place. The walk back to my car was quiet, lucky me got that song he played stuck in my head. When I got home I started reading the books, hoping to fall asleep during the read. 

I read all three books in four nights.
