Nobody blinks here.

As far back as I can remember, they've only ever stared. Not at each other, just at me. They looked at me like I was the last sunrise they'd ever see. Almost like if they stopped staring, I'd vanish. No matter what I did, I couldn't get a reaction out of them. I'd cause a scene, throw things across the room, scream the most vulgar things I could think of an inch from their face. They'd just be there smiling, quiet, still.

I would've gone mad if it wasn't for the sheriff. Or maybe he's the mayor I am not really sure. All I know is that he was the only person in town who would speak to me. He raised me, taught me how to read, write, cook, survive. He told me that the town was mine, not just the land but the buildings, everything.

I never had a house. I didn't need one, I could walk into any building, house, store, diner and take their food, clothes, use their bathroom. No one ever stopped me.

The population seems to be stuck at around 200 people for as long as I can remember. Most of the buildings in town are coarse brick, sun stained. There is a forest that surrounds the town and a single road that doesn't actually seem to lead outside.

I became content with this life. There was no use leaving anyways. I tried to walk on foot in all directions, they all led back to town. I  took a horse from one of the townsfolk  along with a week's worth of food. Taking my time marking trees to keep my bearings. No matter what I did, I ended up right back in town. I got so desperate that I even tried walking backwards because I thought if I could still see the town then it couldn't trick me into looping back. Didn't work

I went to the library to see if I could find any old records of the town. But half the books had their covers ripped off. Most of them had their pages yellow and warped. The calendars were worse, Every single one just the months and days, No year, No holidays, No history.

Sometimes I swear I've seen the same cloud pattern loop across the sky.

God I wish there was a working clock in town.

I have even asked the Sherriff, about the town, about me. Who my parents were, my birthday, where I came from. He always looked at me for a long time and give the same answer.

"You've always been here". And that was the end of it.

When I was younger I started a small fire inside one of the townsfolk houses. I just wanted to get any reaction out of them. They didn't scream. Didn't move. One man just stood there as the fire slowly crept up their leg, clothes burning away as their flesh blistered.

I froze. The sheriff came bursting in shortly after and quickly got me out of the house first and told me to wait inside the library, then went back in to put out the fire.

I sat there in the library with my stomach turning. "Why didn't they move. Why didn't they say something or try to stop me.........  He knows I didn't mean anything bad right? I'm sure he gets bored being the only other person in town who seems sentient" . The door slammed open. I barely get two words out as He slapped me.

"Are you out of your damn mind" he said

"I-I'm sorry, I just wanted-"

"You could've killed them. It doesn't matter what you want. Listen boy, it's your job to do right by these fine people, no matter the cost" .

"What does that even mean" I declared

" No one here does anything but stare. There is nothing for me to do here. I wish I could leave this town and everyone in it."

Once those words left my mouth I saw the sheriff's face change from rage, to betrayal. He didn't say another word and then walked out of the library. He didn't speak to me for the next month. It was the worst month of my life.

I can't believe I forgot about that, I'm glad I remembered.

Yesterday I was eating dinner at a diner when I heard something I'd never heard before. A low rumble and a high pitch mechanical whine. It was a car. I've only ever read about them. This one was old, rusted, belching black smoke, leaving the smell of burnt rubber in the air. It rolled into the outskirts of town slowly like it was trying not to be noticed. I was transfixed on the car. The façade of my content life cracking as the thoughts of escaping this town bubble up. Something from the outside, Maybe a way out.

Then I looked back at townsfolk in the diner, astonished as this is the first time they were not staring at me anymore, and for the first time in my life.....

They looked with hate.
