Our village was a collection of pinewood houses the elders of our community built. Each property had its unique architecture and name. 

Someone knocked on my family’s door. 

I was the only one awake in the abode. Morning had arrived a little over an hour earlier.

I answered and it was a temple guard. These men were easily spotted as protectors because they wore wine-colored robes. Their uniforms were unmistakably visible whenever they were in public.

Although they frequently monitored the interior of our main spiritual house they did on occasion summon others within their private residencies to appear before the Messiah and the leadership team below him. 

The reasons as to why varied. It could be an assignment of a mission or a very public rebuke.

“Are you Eric Lydell?” The guard asked.

I saw his eyes wander behind me to search for anyone else who may have matched my description.

“Yes,” I said.

“You are required to appear before Mitch.”

Mitch Jones was the second in command of our religion. Nobody quite knew why the relative newcomer had secured such an exalted rank but no one dared question his attainment of that commanding role.

I had shaken his hand and met him in passing, but it was very quick and over a year beforehand.

I felt my body turn cold. 

Based on the message deliverer’s overly alert demeanor, the firmness of his voice and the way he kept his hands in front of him, something told me I was not about to be handed a promotion or even be given the task of converting outsiders.

“My parents aren’t awake yet and I need to make them coffee,” I said. “I’m sixteen. They’re old. It’s only right I make the start of their day easier. Can I finish a pot first?”

“They will have to brew it on their own,” he said. 

I saw his hand twitch and I braced for him to grab my arm. I nodded and complied so he would not have to.

I walked with him to the temple.

It was the tallest structure on our land. It sat two stories tall and the roof had a wavelike shape. The edges of its several balconies were lined with red and gold designs. Two of the casements on top gave it the appearance of having two ominous eyes that gazed out upon everything. 

My mind raced with thoughts during the walk there. I was already making excuses for infractions I had not committed.

We walked in and I was escorted by two other guards in robes up a staircase. 

They led me into a chamber I had heard of but had not been in before. The place was called the board room and it was notorious for being the hall of disciplinary action. 

The door slammed shut behind me but I did not hear footsteps echo down the corridor. This told me they had posted up outside in case I decided to argue or fight. Neither action was one I considered engaging in. 

Mitch sat at a long oak table that covered the length of the room. He wore an all-black long-sleeved shirt and leaned back in his chair as he tapped the surface which signaled me to take a seat beside him. 

I heard rumors in the past that he was a professional surfer before he landed his authoritative ruling within our temple grounds. His physique and long blond hair matched that profile. He was never seemed approachable enough to ask about stories from that era. Whenever he walked through the neighborhoods he did it with a furious pace as though he had somewhere critical to be.

He looked angry although I could not tell if that was a resting expression or general emotion towards me in the moment as I sat down. I found out once he spoke. 

“We are here to discuss your behavior,” he said as he reached into a cabinet and pulled out a stack of papers. “There are many accusations against you. If any are true both the Messiah and I will cut you from the fellowship.”

“What? That’s not right. I haven’t done anything wrong.”

“It says here that you have been spotted out past curfew,” he said as he pointed at some fine print I could not make out on the page. 

“Never,” I said.

“So you haven’t been making alarming noises near our brethren’s houses after dark?”

“No.”

“Have you been planting or carving strange footprints in the dirt to try and scare others? I’ve heard you are good at the arts.”

I was puzzled at his line of questioning but I knew the statements were all falsehoods. He was baiting me into a dangerous corner.

“I haven’t done any of those things and I don’t know why I would,” I said. “I know art-making is something no one is supposed to do here. I’m not even a prankster like that. Some of my friends are but not me.”

“I need names,” he said as he slammed his fist on the table.

“I don’t have any,” I said. “I haven’t seen a soul do any of the things you’re describing.”

Mitch stood and paced with his hands folded behind his back. It was clear by his face he wanted to strike me but refrained. 

“I suspect you’re not being truthful with me,” Mitch said. “All I have to go on are anecdotes about where you may or may not be spending your nights. Multiple witnesses would not be motivated to tell the same lie. Hysteria does not exist here.”

He let his words hang in the air.

“All I can say is I’m sorry this is happening but I don’t have anything to do with it,” I said. 

“There is one solution,” he said as he reclaimed his seat and lifted a pen over a document he isolated from the stack before he jotted something on it. “You will not be allowed to participate in the Hallowed Sunset tomorrow. Everyone will be informed of your exclusion from our most valued festivity.”

I was speechless. The Hallowed Sunset was the closest thing we had to a communal gathering or what I had heard people on the outside refer to as a ‘party.’ It was a sociable event and a spectacle with great food. The music was always entrancing and the sweets rich.

He eyed me and awaited my response. I could tell he wanted a rude reply or prepared himself to get defensive if I disrespected him.

“You’ve identified the wrong one,” I said. “I’m not a troublemaker. I don’t deserve to be banned from the one event everyone likes.”

“Don’t make me escalate the write-up,” he said as he handed me review papers. “It is mandatory you show those to your folks when you return. Have a great day.”

*

I was allowed to walk home alone. As I made my way along a concourse littered with dead leaves a fog settled between the pines and the howling of coyotes echoed through the branches. 

I stared down at the review papers and read them at least a dozen times before I walked into the house again. It was a checklist of the alleged violations I was accused of. 

I felt my stomach churn as I gave them to my parents. 

They were at the dining table and things were tense before I gave them the news which would make the after-effects of whatever argument they were in the process of recovering from worse.

“Are you trying to disgrace us in the eyes of the fellowship?” Dad said. 

His breath reeked of bourbon and I could tell he had already been drinking. It was not even eight AM yet. 

“I didn’t partake in anything on that page,” I said.

“Are you saying the robed ones would lie about an investigation?” Mom asked with watery eyes.

“Maybe not. It could be another kid that looks like me and they’re confused.”

“Impossible,” Dad said as he stood and kept his palms stretched outward. He readied himself to flip the table over.

“I’m telling the truth.”

“Do you know what you could do to your mother and me? We could end up back in heathen society. Jobless, homeless, and without a car. We would have to adapt to the way things are in the sinner towns. We would never be able to come back to this sanctuary even if we were able to rebuild our lives the way it was before.”

“I wouldn’t put any of us through-“

“That’s it” he said. “I’m making a decision. You’re not allowed outside for a month.”

I yearned to protest but knew that would get me a first-class ticket to pain delivered at the end of a belt buckle.

I nodded. I stated I was sorry for the sake of appeasing them although I did not mean a single word of it.

I went to my room. 

*
The next evening I took some pillows and stuffed them into a humanoid shape underneath the blankets. I scaled the outline of the figure to the size of my body with as much accuracy as I was capable. 

I held my breath and endeavored to make very little noise.

I peeked my head out the window and searched for any oncoming foot traffic. 

The area was quiet. 

I crawled out and my foot got caught on the sill. A shoelace had come undone. I yanked my leg out and fell backward onto a mound of grass. 

I stood, dusted myself off and kept the window cracked open with a pencil to have easy access upon my return. 

I headed towards the vicinity where the Hallowed Sunset was happening. I was going to be a part of the gathering whether they wanted me to or not, even if it was only as a distant spectator.

It was held behind the temple. I walked towards it the long way to not get spotted.

I knew a few things as I made my way through the woods toward the sounds of mandolins and drums. 

First, I had to be aware of patrols the wine-colored-robed men would complete around the perimeter. 

Second, I was also cognizant of how almost everybody knew I was temporarily exiled from being able to partake in the ceremony. 

I would have to avoid detection from everyone. I was invisible my entire life until that moment. I possessed a newfound local fame I did not want.

I crept along a pathway and climbed a mossy oak. It seemed to be an eternal ladder, one that took me careful and labored movements to sink my fingers into. I maneuvered upwards. 

A copious amount of time passed until I reached the top. There were a few seconds where I fantasized about going back to the ground level but I was motivated to spy on the proceedings.

Once I reached a stable center where I could perch myself without fear of falling I gazed over some treetops and saw the festivities. It did not appear as though it was beginning. It was more in the middle of the event since people were already dressed and dancing. 

A bonfire raged as they moved around it with random and spasmodic rhythms. 

Lines of people moved under me towards the ceremony. Some of the members wore headdresses and oak crowns. Several sets of the blue robes donned by them fluttered in the wind. 

Acoustic guitars played three-chord songs from the sixties. Many of the players wore tie-dyed t-shirts. Flowers surrounded all of them in a circle as they strummed. 

Guards were everywhere from my vantage point but none took the time to gaze upwards.

Everyone grew silent. The harmonies stopped. 

A tall man walked closer to the flames and raised his arm in the air. 

The community focused in on him and as I peered at his face. I recognized who he was. He was the former second in command who was demoted once Mitch took his job.

His arms were covered in paint and his face had a white stripe over one half of it. 

He raised a wooden doll in the air. It looked as though it could have sat outside exposed to the elements for months before finding its way here. He raised his other hand which held a glinting knife. 

He cut off its head and arms and threw the wood shavings into the faces of a few who sat before him. He ran the blade over the dolls torso a few times and revealed the chipped inside. 

He rubbed it against his chest. Dozens of splinters pierced beneath his flesh.

I did not understand this. It was different from last year's event, where everyone seemed to have a good time in not watching a politically fallen elder hurt himself.

He sunk the blade into his hand. He illustrated a strange symbol on his stomach with the resulting blood.

He turned his back on the crowd and walked towards the incendiary pit. 

He jumped into it. The fire consumed him. 

There were no emotions on anyone’s face. It was as though they expected this. Some of the children viewing it did not move but remained stationary at the behest of their fathers.

I looked down and saw a girl roughly my age.

She locked eyes with mine before a gasp escaped her.

She sprinted away in the same direction I had taken to get there. 

Worry filled me. I knew who she was. Her name was Julia Hyland. We had been at Hallowed Sunset events together before. Sometimes as dance partners. I always suspected she enjoyed my company, although that could have been ego.

She was also understanding of the fact that I was not supposed to be there that evening.

I did not want her telling the higher-ups or her relatives but I was also unsure of how to stop her.

I looked down and waited for those who continued to stare at the flames to look behind them. Instead they locked eyes with the flames as though the former second-in-command would somehow resurrect himself. Everyone seemed too invested in a grieving ritual they were now a part of to notice me.

I climbed down. 

I was careful in how I planted my feet since I did not want the snapping of foliage to alert anyone in the sadness-strewn quiet.

I chased after her. 

It took me a matter of minutes to figure out I lost her. I could not even track the imprints of her shoes in the dirt. 

Rain fell and while I knew this was advantageous as far as remaining unseen since the guards were less inclined to be out in bad weather, it could also make it more hazardous for me as far as trying to find her. 

I went home. 

Not all was lost. 

I knew where she and her family lived. They had a house roughly two thousand feet from where mine was. 

I approached my domicile in a crouched position behind bushes. Once I saw that no one was there I sprinted to my window and slid into my room. 

I searched through the dresser and retrieved some Reese’s cups, Kit Kat bars and Butterfingers. I stuffed them into a spare plastic bag.

I would wait until dark to attempt damage control for the sake of my reputation and of my kin’s.
 *
I let an hour pass after the sun had lowered before I snuck out again. 

I circled Julia’s house. 

The inside of it was luminescent with what looked like a dangerous amount of candles. I got closer and gazed into the main living quarters.

Her mother sat there with a bowl made out of looking glass. She was chanting something in a foreign language I had never heard.

I inched my way around back and saw Julia’s room. 

Her space was colorful with posters of her favorite bands. 

She sat on her bed and was sketching something. Upon closer inspection, I saw it was a hideously deformed monster. Her illustrated creation was a black-furred creature with a hunched back and a permanent snarl. 

It took me by surprise that she was recklessly engaging in such a sin as making art without immediate fear of reprise.

I tapped the window.

She turned in the direction of the noise and her jaw fell open. I displayed the candy as a peace offering with the hopes she would not scream.

She walked over and unlatched the window:

“What are you doing here?” Julia said in a half-whisper as she motioned to the doorway of her room.

“I’m begging you not to tell on me,” I said. “My entire bloodline will be exiled. If they find out I broke the conditions they set forth then my life will change. I didn’t want to miss the Hallowed Sunset because it’s what I look forward to all year.”

“It is a sin for me to keep the secrets of someone guilty of a disgrace,” she said.

“I didn’t do anything.”

“Why would they frame you?”

“I think someone was mistaken as being me. Have you told anyone you saw me there today?”

“No,” she said, “but I know it’s the right thing to do.”

I gave her the chocolate confectionaries. Her eyes widened as she gripped the wrappers and held them up to the light of her bedside to make sure they were real.

“Where did you get these?”

“When they made me deliver the good word door to door in that town right outside Castle Valley,” I said. “Placerville. I always stop by a convenience store to make the walks through the neighborhoods less dull.”

“If you have some more of these,” she said with a smile, “I’ll never say a word about what I saw.”

I was amused as I gave her the rest of what I had.

“So we have a deal?” I asked as I extended my hand.

We shook on it.

“One more thing,” she said as I turned around to go back to my place. “You owe me now. Not the other way around. Bring me a bag of these once every couple of months and your secret is safe with me.”

I wanted to debate with her and say that was not part of the conditions of our agreement but I held back. They would always believe her over me and she would exploited this leverage no matter what.

“Of course,” I said. “Although we can consider the goods I brought today to be the end of it and I won’t tell anyone you’ve been drawing.”

I left.
*
I walked into the forestry and made a sharp turn in the direction of where my family was asleep. 

I stepped over plots of mud and damp logs. I heard the sound of the wind which had been going strong for hours before it was interrupted with another noise I was far less familiar with. 

Something breathed. 

It did not sound human but instead possessed the panting of a large animal.

I looked to my right and saw a crude courtyard that two families had built. I had never seen the area in the nocturnal hours. Pieces of rock which jutted from the ground carried a claylike texture in the darkness.

Something moved between the homes. 

Once I saw it in motion I dove behind a cluster of trees.

I squinted to get a better look at it. My first guess is it was a bear but that did not make any sense because it did not carry itself on its front and rear legs. 

Instead it walked upright and the top half of its shadowy physique had a slow undulation. 

It craned its neck back to stare at me. A wide grin formed on its face which was made out of black feathers and an airy composite every bit as penciled and animated as what I had seen Julia create on the page earlier. 

It moved towards where I stood.

As it stared at me I felt terror grip my being. 

I did not know what this thing was capable of or even what it could be. 

It came within inches of where I was frozen in place. 

I would like to say I attacked it. That I picked up a rock and threw it at the thing’s face. Or how maybe I taunted it with some kind of mocking retort that may have hurt its feelings if the beast even spoke English. 

Instead I turned my back and ran home as fast as I could. I kicked pine cones and sticks behind me. 

I heard screaming. 

I looked over my shoulder and saw a man in a wine-colored robe engaging with it. 

He kicked and punched at the thing before he was pushed aside as though he weighed nothing. 

Knowing the thing had that kind of strength only made me want to get out of there faster. I fled.
*
I spent the majority of that night and the next morning brooding about what I had seen in my room until the sun rose. 

I had a tale to share that no one would believe and it made me feel alone. My father would see it as an outright lie for attention and split my lip open. My mother would dismiss it as a cry for attention and pretend as though I never talked about it. 

I was still technically in trouble with leadership and even though I knew one of the protectors had seen the same thing, I would have deeper problems administratively if I confessed to being out past curfew. 

The bell in the center of the town rang. 

This meant that the Messiah was going to give a speech and everyone had to be present for his words.

I went to the middle of the community and blended in with the crowd. Our great one stood behind a podium. The front of the soapbox had a peace sign spray painted on it and the withered skull of a bobcat nailed to it.

“Only an elite few will cross the pearly gates,” he said. “A vision came to me last night. An angel shared how everyone here has the potential for eternal euphoria once our carbon-based forms have deteriorated. All we have to do is continue to follow the rules.”

I checked out once I saw Julia to my left. At that point I was unable to focus on the message of the rest of the lecture and waited for it to end.

Once everyone in the crowd was permitted to disperse I walked up to her.

“I saw something otherworldly last night,” I said.

“So everyone had a moment of transcendence yesterday except for me,” she said as she folded her arms.

“No. It didn’t feel as though I learned anything from it. All I got out of it was fear.”

I explained to her what the thing resembled and that it was eerily similar to what she drew on her sketch pad when I visited. 

I kept my voice low and looked around to ensure that no one was eavesdropping.

“Let’s take a walk to old man Hezekiah’s farmhouse,” she said.

Once we were past the tree line and away from the group she held my hand. This surprised me since it was an act that could lead to retribution for both of us.

As we approached a cherrywood structure known to hold nothing but old books and hay, a one-time dwelling of an elder who loved horses, she stopped and turned to me.

“You may not believe what I’m about to tell you,” she said. “You have to trust me. Or you can call me crazy, but I need you to hear me out because I think you’ve been through enough to at least deserve the truth.”

“What is it?”

“My family is being held here against our will,” she said as she took a few steps back and looked at the ground. “Neither of my parents are true believers anymore. The Messiah - or Ben Lorea, as my Dad calls him whenever we’re out of earshot - knows my father has a warrant for bank fraud on the outside. If we leave, Dad will go to prison because Ben will call the cops on us as soon as we’re not here.”

“What does that have to do with me?”

“So listen. My Dad and Mom chose to get revenge in their way. They brought occult books with them from the public library whenever we went on missions.”

“Spiritual books that our Savior hasn’t written? Do you know what the consequence of that is?”

“I do but we haven’t been caught yet. So my family has been creating guardians.”

“What do you mean?”

“Familiars. Spiritual entities manifested through spell work to provide specific tasks.”

“Okay,” I said as I felt my head spin. “What does the one your family summoned do? What is its main purpose?”

“To protect, defend, and avenge abused children within this community. Anyone who even intends to harm a young one in this area will receive a visit from it.”

A sinking feeling in my stomach started. This explained why it left me alone and went after the guard. 

She analyzed me for a few seconds. She waited for my response.

“I need to get out of here,” I said. “You should come with me.”

She backed away from me. A tear fell from her eye and she shook her head.

“I can’t do that. Everyone I love is here.”

“We can plan an escape or voluntarily get banished,” I said. 

“My fathers reputation will be ruined and I know your family will hurt you if you try something like that,” she said. “If what you want to do is go then you should.”

“Keep yourself safe from the ones in the temple,” I said. 

She did the strangest thing after I made that remark.

She hugged me.
*
I had a backpack with some spare clothes. 

I slung it over my shoulder and took one last look at my room.  

I snuck out and walked past the temple. It seemed too cheap now. The place we were brainwashed to believe was once sanctified was now nothing more than a sick playhouse for people powerful to a small organization. 

Three types of wood, some odd bits of tinder, and a match are all it takes to build a fire, although of course there is some technique. 

I gathered everything I needed to burn the place down. 

I have never been a pyromaniac but on that night I felt like one. I was blacked out with anger and ready to do what Julia’s family was not quick or perhaps reckless enough to complete yet.

I struck the match and admired the flame. 

Then I had a moment of clarity.

Other people would die or get hurt. It would spread quickly. We were miles away from the nearest fire station. 

The elders and those who made the regulations here were not my concern but I could not live with myself if I left everything a smoldering mess and harmed innocent people with third-degree burns or worse.

I blew it out and walked into the woodland. 

I kept going until I reached a highway. 

I hitched a ride to the nearest city. It was a place mainly built for tourists in the mountains known for its copious snowfall. 

Within a week I got a job in snow removal. No one cared that I did not have ID or a place to live. The owner of the laboring company allowed me to stay at the office of the business where I slept on the floor next to a space heater. 

I would never return to that horrid makeshift township which thrived on lies, manipulation and other unspeakable abuses of power. 

I lay awake at night and contemplate how many of the guilty felt the familiar’s cursed presence, and I hope the sting of it never leaves them.
