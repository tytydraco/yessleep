Update for anyone who saw my last posting but I am still alive. I decided to hold up in the cellar in hopes that this will all be over soon. The last few days have exhausting but lucky me I have plenty of food and water stocked up, although I don't know how long it will last.

The TVs still only play the same emergency broadcast as before, my cell phone has lost all signal and the old land line is dead too. I did find my dad's old police radio which had a lot of static as I searched for any channels. Most had just static but I did find one channel I could make out something about people in the town's old church but the static and what I can only guess was some weird choir music was jamming the broadcast.

The voices of what I can only assume are my dead family members continue to follow me. When I try to sleep I even hear them in my dreams, beckoning me to come outside with them. I still try not to think about it but there is only so much I can do.

I've kept busy reading books, cleaning dad's guns, and figuring out how best to ration what I have left. It keeps the darker thoughts at bay. but that wasn't my only problem.

Several hours after my last post I saw something moving amongst the dead trees around the property. I thought it was just my imagination but I've seen it a few times now sulking about. Some dark grey or black on its lumbering form. It disappeared into some brush when I think I heard a car go by.

I went upstairs, one of dad's rifles in hand and made my way to the attic. I could hear that buzzing like sound the weird lights still circling my house were making but I couldn't believe my eyes. A car was making its way up the gravel driveway. They stopped about halfway out up the hill before getting out of the car, looking down the scope of the rifle I recognized them. George was mousy looking man with a patchy beard, Danny was a bit more sure of himself. Rumor around town was they were both responsible for a series of break-ins but no one could prove it.

They seemed to eye the house wearily before moving towards the barn on foot. I didn't know why but the lights didn't go after them, I wanted to signal to them somehow. Maybe they could get some help. I scrambled for a flashlight or something in that dust filled attic. Stranding up is when I noticed that thing was back, creeping up on the men.

I froze, something was just so wrong with it, even from this far away I could see its beady red eyes on its dark coat. Then it broke out into a sprint slamming into Danny, sent the guy flying. I grabbed the gun as George ran back to the car. I did as I was taught, fire on exhale between pounding heartbeats. Despite the ringing in my ears and the shattering of the glass I could see it hit the damn thing. It didn't even slow down. As the tires spun the thing stomped on Danny's chest before starting to bite into it.

I tried not to vomit up what little food I had in me, George sped off before it was done with his friend, still screaming as the gravel turned as red as the sky. looking through the scope I could see it better then before. It was like some malformed goat thing. I looked away till the screaming stopped.

Eventually when I did look back that thing was gone but what was left of Danny was strung up on a dead tree. Coyotes in what can only be called dancegoing moved under his disemboweled corpse. I watched entranced by the gruesome display as the tree began to burn. Even after moving on I could still smell burnt meat.

I didn't want to go out before but I really don't want to now. I'm pretty sure it or something is still moving around the house. Awhile later I found my old stuffed rabbit sitting by the front door. Glancing out the glass  I noticed the blood dripping above the entryway. Needless to say I double check the locks before squatting to examine her. I'm not sure what I expected to see but those unlinking eyes didn't frighten me as much anymore. Still I let her be, the rabbit hadn't yet tried to hurt me directly.

At least some other people are still alive, maybe I can find someone to chat with on the radio, if that thing doesn't break in. I just hope my guns are a little more effective at close range if it does. I'll try to update again soon if I'm still alive.
