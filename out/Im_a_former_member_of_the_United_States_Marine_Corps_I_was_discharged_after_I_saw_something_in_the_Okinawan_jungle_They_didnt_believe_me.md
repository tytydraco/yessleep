I'm a former member of the United States Marine Corps. I was discharged after I saw something in the Okinawan jungle. They didn't believe me.

I really had no idea where I should share my experience without being seen as mentally unstable. That's why they discharged me; but it seems like the people here are less judgmental, so I figured it was worth a shot.

If this post gets taken down, that should be confirmation that what I saw was real, and that the government is trying to hide it.

Most people know that the United States military has bases all over the world, and usually alongside those bases are training camps. Marines are trained to fight in every possible scenario, we were even trained with how to assist and communicate locals and foreign allies.

It was my second training exercise. My first was in the California desert, but it was nothing compared to what I'd go through in Okinawa. The thing about these exercises is that, most of the time, you're only really allowed to bring the clothes on your back and whatever miniscule tools they authorize. Bringing your own food is strictly prohibited, even MREs.

  
It's supposed to be an 8-day exercise. My squadron consisted of 6 people; myself, my brother, and 4 other guys I'd never met. The first few days were uneventful, and mostly consisted of us trying to live off of cicadas and grubs. Until day 7, at least.

  
By day 7, I was hungrier than I'd ever been before. There was barely anything we could eat. No bodies of water deep enough to fish in, hardly any insects or animals; we were desperate. In the middle of the night on day 6, my brother and one of the other guys went scouting to attempt to find something for us all to eat. He figured with only two days left, one good meal could tie us over until the end. 

  
Now I know what you're thinking, they never came back, how's that so hard to believe?

  
Well, they did come back. 

My brother woke us up about 4 hours after they had left. They had bagged a weird, fuzzy rat, with white fur. We threw it over the fire almost immediately, and each of us had a small piece. It was one of the best things I've ever tasted, and I still wake up craving another bite to this day. The rat almost had a rubbery texture; it felt like chewing on a barely-inflated balloon, or maybe a flattened bouncy ball. It still tasted unbelievably good. I've tried replicating the taste with caviar, truffle, salmon, even other rats, and it never tasted even remotely close. 

While we were eating, I asked my brother where they'd found the rat, and he stared at me blankly. His eyes seemed sunken in, his posture was crooked. I just let it go and went to sleep. I figured the jungle was just getting to him, and he was too tired and hungry to get the words out.

I slept for about 45 minutes before I jolted awake. It felt like an alarm had gone off. 

As I stepped outside my tent, I found a chunk of hair on the ground. The odd part is, all of our heads had been shaved less than a week ago. It couldn't belong to us, or my commanders. It looked familiar, but I could place where I'd seen this type of hair before. I quickly realized it trailed off into the forest, so I followed the trail.

My curiosity was getting to me, and I supposed that maybe a walk might help clear my head so I could get some rest. I chugged along until the hair led me to a waterfall, and I had an uncontrollable urge to step inside.

I did, and what I still see what I discovered every time I close my eyes.

It was a small jar full of what seemed to be cut up pieces of the rat I'd eaten earlier in a cloudy brown liquid. It was sticking out of the wall, almost like a fossil. I tried to pull it out of the rock, but it shattered in my hand. I was certain that this was it, that I'd bleed out. I was confused, exhausted, and hungry. I quickly drifted off, for what felt like forever. 

  
I woke up within a tiny cave made out of flesh, and my wound still agonizing. It was too small for me to fit in, and my body stretched it out to fit. It seemed like a small stream of bile was on the bottom of the cave. I tried to at least keep my mouth from touching anything in the cave, but it was easier said than done.

  
I just decided to trek forward until seemingly sliced wounds stretched throughout the top of the cave, and the only thing that met me was the night sky. I didn't have the strength to crawl out.

  
A blistering heat was the next feeling I felt, complete with a blinding white light coming through all of the cave's wounds. After this, everything's a blur up until the end.

The cave filled with a sticky clear substance that smelled different than the bile on the ground, but definitely similar. I tried to swim or even float out, but the thickness of the liquid made it impossible, so I blacked out again. What I was met with afterwards was my tent.

  
I was back at the campfire, and I felt completely fine, even my wound had been bandaged. I walked outside, suspecting everything to just be some weird fever dream, and the jungle was completely gone.

  
There was nothing except for a trail of white hair.

I didn't follow the trail. I went back to sleep. 

I woke up surrounded by my squadron, who had called in a medical helicopter for me. My brother seemed to be himself again, and I asked him what happened. According to him, everyone had woken up, with me still asleep. I'd assumed it was just a dream, so I asked why they had called a medical helicopter. After all, it was just the hunger, right?

  
That's when I looked down, and saw a wound on my hand. It wasn't a dream.

I told my commanders everything, I swore it was all real. They discharged me for being "mentally unwell" but I know what I saw. I still have scars, I still crave more. I don't know what any of it meant. All I know is that the academy we trained at has been shut down for nearly a decade, and I've kept all of this private (except for my commanders) for so long. 

All I can say is to be extremely wary of what might lay out in the wilderness.. I know what I saw is real.
