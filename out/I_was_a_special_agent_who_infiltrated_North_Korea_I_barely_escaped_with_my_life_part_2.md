I heard the soldiers sweeping the house from room to room, dogs furiously barking outside. A car that sounded like its muffler had fallen off sometime during the Vietnam War idled on the street. They found the old woman, laying comatose in her bed, and tried unsuccessfully to rouse her, screaming orders at her over and over with no response.  
  
I heard footsteps coming towards the door of the closet where we hid, and my finger tightened on the trigger. I was resolved to go down fighting, and not be captured and given a slow death on a blood-stained concrete slab in the basement of some building where the townspeople never go.  
  
I saw Agent Hudson’s eyes narrow, the scope of the gun raised to chest height as he prepared to start shooting. The air felt electric with tension, and I tried not to even breathe too loudly, lest we be heard. My heart beat furiously in my ears, each thud seeming to betray my presence to the enemy. I tried to calm myself, to stop the trembling that swept across my body.  
  
But then a commotion started on the street, and the soldiers began issuing orders and rushing outside. Firing started, and screams of agony and horror shattered the small, poverty-stricken town.  
  
I slowly opened the door, expecting some sort of trap. But the shrieking and wails coming from outside could not have been staged- there was too much pain in the voice, intolerable. It sounded like their vocal cords would rupture from the effort, and then the screams were caught off, one by one. I walked softly to the window, seeing Hee-Jin still laying on the bed, unconscious. I would have to give her a dose of an opioid antagonist to prevent a likely overdose that would cause her to stop breathing and turn blue. For drugs like etorphine, we carried a pre-loaded red syringe that read, “Revivon: For Animal Use Only”. I had wanted to laugh when I first read it, but the CIA had assured me that etorphine was the safest and quickest method of immobilization, and that this was an antidote that would work on humans as well.  
  
As I got to the window, seeing the cracked glass panes and ancient, splintering wood, a sudden urge to turn away came over, and I began sweating heavily. Chills ran up and down my body, and I felt unreal, not in the moment. It felt like I had just woken up in the middle of a dream, but when I looked outside, I knew my mind could not have conjured such atrocities in the course of a nightmare.  
  
On a white, skeletal horse sat a red rider, his body twisted and dark, his features demonic and inhuman. The hooves softly clicked on the dirt and stones as the man rode over bodies, their faces frozen in horror. It seemed like I was looking at something not from the angles and geometry of our universe, as if space itself twisted around this horrendous being of power.  
  
Its massive head formed the shape of an upside-down triangle, its crimson skin as smooth as fresh paint. Two bulbous, glistening eyes stared out straight ahead, unblinking. They looked like two spherical obsidian stones, as large as baseballs and seemingly without eyelids. They looked insectoid, or even entirely alien. Like the eyes of a poisonous snake, they radiated malice and power.  
  
Underneath, it had some strange exoskeleton, its bones on the outside of its body, grooved and smooth, like a red shell rippling down its thin chest. Its legs jutted out the sides of the undead horse, like the legs of a praying mantis- sharp and muscular.  
  
The horse, despite having no flesh or muscle on its body, moved quickly. It had two pure black eyes, like those of its master, though not nearly as strange. They didn’t form a bulbous, spherical mass, like those of the rider’s, but looked like two black stones embedded into its skull, shining with oil-spot rainbows and colors that glimmered off its eyes as they caught the sun.  
  
A North Korean man ran across the street, and the rider on the horse pointed a long, festering finger in his direction and uttered a single word. The man stopped immediately, his eyes widening, the blood draining from his face. He began to claw at his own eyes, ripping them and shredding them, until blood streamed from the sockets and two empty, lidless voids stared out.  
  
He began to choke and turn blue, as if he had swallowed his own tongue, and fell to the ground seizing and kicking. I saw his fingernails and lips becoming cyanotic as he laid on the dirt, as limp as a rag doll.  
  
As if in response, the creature on the skeletal horse gave out a deafening, demonic shriek. It echoed across the mountains, reverberating in eerie waves. The voice sounded like thousands of voices spliced together, some simultaneously fading out while others rose in a harmonizing cacophony. It made a nightmarish sound, and goosebumps rose on my skin as I listened to the cry of this creature, a cry as alien and inhuman as anything I had ever heard.   
  
I realized Agent Hudson was no longer standing next to me. He had the red syringe in his hand, injecting some of the Revivon into Hee-Lin’s neck. Her breathing seemed slow, far too slow for comfort, and her face looked pale, but within seconds, her breathing began to accelerate, and her eyes started to flutter. With a confused, sleepy expression, she opened her eyes, seemingly not realizing where she was or how she got there. Agent Hudson looked up, motioning for me to come over. I looked out the window. I saw countless bodies on the road, men, women and children all laying haphazardly next to one another.   
  
The creature had stopped its incessant, demonic screaming, but the echoes still came back over the mountains, slowly dying down over a few seconds. My ears rang from the intensity of it, a high-pitched buzzing that made it hard to understand Agent Hudson’s words. I listened intently, looking at his lips.  
  
“She knows something,” he said, his eyes cold and slitted. “We need to find out what’s going on here. I think it’s something far worse than we imagined.” I heard the distant clicking of the horse’s hooves as it passed down the street, trampling the dozens of corpses on the way.   
  
“Oh, no, I knew it,” Hee-Jin said woozily, her head spasmodically moving from side to side. Her eyes, wide and full of terror, looked up at the ceiling as she lay on her ancient bed. Agent Hudson looked at me.  
  
“Your Korean is far better than mine,” he said. “She will trust you more than me, simply because you know the language and look like her.” I shrugged.  
  
“I’ll give it a shot,” I said. I pulled up a rickety chair, continuously glancing out the window, but the strange rider had passed by. He no longer screamed, and the silence outside seemed deathly. The smell of blood hung heavy in the air, coming through the cracks and broken windows of the dilapidated house.  
  
“Hee-jin,” I said, pulling up close to her. She moved her head on the pillow, meeting my eyes. They were wide and very dark, filled with nightmarish memories and terrors that I couldn’t imagine. “What happened during the Arduous March? What caused the bodies to come back?”  
  
“We don’t know where it started,” she said, “but it seemed to come from the forests north of here.” I looked knowingly at Agent Hudson, who nodded. That was where the biological weapons facility we had been sent to investigate was located- directly north, as the crow flies, not more than three or four miles from this town.  
  
“And what was ‘it’?” I asked.  
  
“The undead, but not just them,” she said. “They followed something inhuman, something that rode by on a horse. I never saw it, but I heard stories from survivors. They said its horse shone a pale color, made of bones, with pure black eyes, like those of its master. The military told us that it was a monster sent by the Americans or the South Koreans, and that our great leader Kim Il-Jong would respond in force by sending a thousand monsters to their country for every one that invaded ours. But others whispered that it was made by the Democratic People’s Republic itself, though they would never say it publicly, for fear of execution.”  
  
“And how did it end?” I asked. “When the famine ended, the corpses and the rider went where?” She shrugged.  
  
“The Chinese sent reinforcements to the border regions, and the DPRK began to fill every town around here with soldiers. Most of the Korean soldiers were starving, just like us, and they would take our food by force, whatever little we had. If anyone was caught hoarding more than a couple meals worth, they would be publicly executed.  
  
“I spent that time foraging in the forest for herbs and mushrooms, and trying to capture small game, even eating rats and mice I caught in traps. I avoided the town as much as I could after I saw the first of the dead rise to life. It seemed to last forever, but then one day, the soldiers were gone, and food began to come back in slowly. We were given rice, and then bread, and the Arduous March came to an end, with millions of our comrades dead.  
  
“It was so bad back then, you couldn’t leave the bodies of your loved ones out. They had to be buried immediately after death, otherwise you’d come back and find their bodies gone, or meat cut out from the legs and arms. Cannibalism ran rampant, and people ate grass and dirt just to fill their stomachs.”  
  
“But you’re still eating grass,” I pointed out. She smiled sadly.  
  
“Only once a day now,” she said, as if that made it acceptable. And in these hellish conditions, maybe it was. I had immense respect for this old woman, who had survived such hardships and starvation, and seen such horrors unleashed.  
  
“How come none of this ever got out?” I asked. “No one in the rest of the world knows anything about the dead rising during the famine. We know that millions of people starved, but even finding out how many was impossible.”  
  
“What happens here, stays here- with our people. It is our burden alone. Living here is like living in a reinforced fortress, with no one allowed to leave or communicate with anyone outside. Anyone who tries to leave is shot on sight. The police make sure you know the consequences of trying to leave, or of communicating with the outside world. They say no one should want to leave, because we are the greatest society in the world, the most equal and the most feared. No one would attack us, and that’s why I think maybe… it came from our own people.”   
  
I was about to respond, when I heard the cracking of twigs and brush moving right outside of the house. Moving quietly to the window, I looked outside. The rider was gone, but now a horde of walking corpses streamed into the town.  
  
They had blood coming from their mouths, their noses, their eyes, streaming yellowish, viscous fluid out of gaping wounds that ran down their bodies. Deep gash marks, bullet wounds or marks of torture shown out on their bodies, revealing bones and ligaments and gore underneath- a horrific sight that sent waves of fear through my body.  
  
The smell that came with the wave felt like a solid wall of fetid rot, an odor so thick I could taste it, and I nearly retched. Like rotten cheese, decomposing tomatoes and rancid meat, that smell emanated out from the hundreds of corpses that gnashed their mouths, chewing the air constantly.   
  
Their bloody eyes stared like doll’s eyes, blank and lifeless in their sunken faces. Most looked starved, and many were totally naked, though on some, rotting fragments of cloth still clung to their pale, lifeless skin, threadbare and clotted with blood. Yellow pus and mucus shone and glistened on their bodies as they moved forward, hungry and fearless, an army that seemed to emanate from one large hivemind, coordinating their movements like birds in a flock.  
  
Hee-Jin didn’t see them, and in her partial opiate stupor, she may not have heard the subtle movements. They didn’t scream or shriek, unlike the rider, and they moved as silently as predators. Whatever few people still had life on the street began screaming again as their bodies got eaten alive, the corpses lunging forward at the human flesh on the street, falling upon it with powerful jaws. The screams were weak and panicked, the last gasps of dying men and women as they came back to a nightmare, even worse than before.  
  
“Those who died during the famine came back,” she said. “Mobs of walking, undead children who ate even their own parents and grandparents, though many were orphans by that point. The parents died, too, from starvation, and their bodies were often eaten by the townspeople. Many turned to cannibalism, and human meat was sold on the black market during the darkest times. Women used to prostitute themselves just to get a bowl of rice, or a piece of bread. People would eat their own children and mothers, and strangers, or even friends, were killed for whatever little food they had.”   
  
The walking corpses turned their heads towards the house, like bloodhounds who just got a whiff of their prey. As she kept talking, they began to rise from the still bodies they fed upon, converging upon the front door, a stream of rotting flesh and gaping mouths who now knew we were here.  
  
“Agent Hudson,” I said in a trembling voice, “time to go.” He had seen it, too, and we started sprinting towards the back door. Hee-Jin didn’t rise, and didn’t seem to realize the danger. We had to save ourselves, and also had a mission to accomplish, one that seemed far more important than ever now. I had a sick feeling in my stomach as I left her behind, condemning her to a horrible and slow death.  
  
Agent Hudson smashed through the rickety boards of the back door without even opening it, splintering the wood in an explosion of adrenaline. I followed through the hole. Hee-Jin began to scream in agony, and I quickly turned, seeing the frontmost corpses lunging forwards and eating her from the legs and stomach. Her eyes rolled in pain and horror, shrieking like a banshee as blood gushed from dozens of bites. The undead in the back of the streaming crowd stopped, looking at me while I stood in the door- an M67 fragmentation in my right hand, round and blue as a robin’s egg. I pulled the pin, throwing it an overhand arc that flew past in a blur and bounced off the floor of the kitchen, rolling into the bedroom across from me.   
  
As I turned and ran, I saw Hee-Jin’s eyes, haunted, staring up at the ceiling as blood streamed from her stomach and legs. She moaned and whimpered constantly, no longer having the energy to scream. The creatures ripped the flesh off with their teeth, swallowing huge chunks of her body without chewing. It was a sickening sight, and even a few months later, recalling it makes me feel sick to my stomach.  
  
Agent Hudson had reached the edge of the woods. I was now thirty feet behind him, and I sprinted as fast as I could to give myself distance from the explosion I knew was coming. I counted down in my head: “Five… four… three… two…” But that was as far as I got.  
  
A flash of light exploded out of the house, sending splintered boards and pieces of drywall flying in all directions. I looked back and saw a red ball of fire, catching the dry wood of the house in an instant. My ears rang from the ground-shaking roar of the grenade. I started to look forward again, but I tripped on a rock and went flying.  
  
I landed on the grass, hitting my head hard against the dirt. It only stunned me for a few moments, but as I laid there, still too close to the house for any peace of mind, I heard a new sound coming from the house.  
  
The corpses had started to make noises, but they didn’t scream. It sounded like a bloodthirsty crowd moaning in agreement as some fanatical leader whipped them into a frenzy of mass murder, or the cheering of Roman spectators in a Coliseum seeing men slice each other apart.  
  
It sounded like hundreds of people, enraptured, saying, “Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!” Then, as the fire spread and the house quickly started to collapse on itself, it faded into silence.
