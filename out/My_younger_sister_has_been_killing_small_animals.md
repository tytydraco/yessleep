**Hi everyone,**  
I (16F) have no clue how to even start this. I just need to write it down because it’s eating me alive, and I feel like if I don’t tell someone—anyone—I’m going to lose it.

My little sister Trisha (12, turning 13 soon) has always been… different. Not in a bad way, necessarily, just... different. I love her to death, but she’s always had this fascination with things that most kids wouldn’t think twice about. In fourth grade, her class dissected owl pellets, and she got obsessed with bones. Like, not just interested—*obsessed.* For a while, I thought it was cool too. We’d go out in the woods behind our house, looking for animal skulls, shed antlers, stuff like that. It was kind of our thing.

But, I don’t know, when I hit 14, I just wasn’t into it anymore. All of a sudden, cigarettes, boys, weed, sneaking out, and doing dumb shit seemed way more fun than looking for deer teeth with my little sister. I was a nightmare for my parents, and I’ll admit it—I made their lives hell. Yelling, slamming doors, getting caught sneaking out. You name it, I probably did it.

I’m better now. Kind of. I mean, I still smoke, but at least I’m not sneaking out or getting drunk every weekend. It’s baby steps, okay? But while my parents were busy trying to control me, I guess nobody was really paying attention to Trisha. Not in a *neglect* way, but more like, “She’s quiet, she’s fine.” I thought so too.

Anyway, a few days ago, I was out in the woods to smoke. There’s this spot under the back porch where I usually go—it’s hidden and kind of cozy, and nobody bugs me out there. I was lighting up when I saw Trisha coming out of the woods.

She had her backpack on and something in her hands, and she kept looking around like she didn’t want to be seen. My first thought was, *Oh great, she’s sneaking out to do something dumb.* Total hypocrite, I know. But I was curious.

I waited until she went back inside before I followed the path she came out of. It wasn’t super obvious—like, not a trail-trail, but it had definitely been walked enough to leave a mark. It led to this little clearing by the creek, a spot we used to go to when we were younger. And then I saw it.

There was this lean-to, like a fort made of sticks and torn-up fabric, propped against a big rock. At first, I thought it was just some hideout she made. But when I got closer and looked inside, I almost threw up.

There was a big flat rock inside, and it was covered in dried blood. Around it were bits of animals—like, *mangled* animals. A bird with its wings ripped off. Half a rabbit. A raccoon’s head. Little bones and vertebrae scattered everywhere. And the smell—it smelled like rot, even though it was cold out.

I just stood there, staring. My brain couldn’t catch up with what I was seeing. My first thought was, *This isn’t Trisha.* I mean, she’s weird, but not *this* weird. Right? But then I thought about her coming out of the woods with her backpack, looking all nervous, and I felt sick.

I ran back to the house. I don’t even know how long I was out there, but when I got inside, there she was, sitting on the couch with her phone like nothing had happened.

“Where were you?” I asked. My voice cracked a little, and I hated how obvious I sounded.

She glanced up at me and shrugged. “The woods.”

I didn’t know what to say. My head was spinning.

I grabbed my bag and turned toward the door, thinking I’d head back to the lean-to and take pictures. But as I reached for the handle, Trisha’s voice stopped me cold.

“You’re not going back out there.”

It wasn’t a question.

I turned around slowly. She was still sitting on the couch, her phone abandoned on the cushion next to her, her hands resting in her lap like she’d been waiting for me to look at her.

“Why not?” I asked, trying to sound casual, like my heart wasn’t pounding in my chest.

Her head tilted slightly, and for a second, she looked almost... sad. “You shouldn’t mess with it.”

I felt like the air had been knocked out of me. “Mess with what?”

She didn’t answer right away. Her eyes drifted toward the window, where the woods stretched out in every direction, bare branches against the gray sky.

“You don’t understand,” she said quietly. “It doesn’t like being watched.”

“*What* doesn’t like being watched?” I demanded, louder than I meant to. My voice cracked on the last word, and I hated how scared I sounded.

She looked back at me then, her face calm, almost blank. “It doesn’t have a name. Or if it does, I don’t know it.”

I stared at her. “Trisha, what are you talking about?”

Her fingers fidgeted with the hem of her sweatshirt, twisting the fabric into little knots. For the first time, she looked her age—like a nervous kid trying to explain something she didn’t really understand.

“It’s just... there,” she said. “It’s been there for a long time. Longer than us. I found it a long time ago. You never saw it. It doesn't like being watched." 

Something about the way she said *you never saw it* made my stomach turn.

“Are you trying to scare me?” I asked, but the words felt hollow.

“No,” she said quickly. “I wouldn’t do that to you.”

I wanted to believe her, but my legs felt shaky, like I might collapse if I didn’t sit down. I took a step toward her, but she flinched, like she thought I might hit her.

“I’m not mad,” I said, softer this time. “I just want to know what’s going on. What did you do out there?”

Her lip quivered, and for a second, I thought she might cry. But then she pressed her hands against her knees, took a deep breath, and said, “It’s not about me. It’s about *it.* It doesn’t like being ignored, either. You have to give it something, or it gets mad.”

I felt a cold chill run down my spine. “Give it *what*?”

“Animals,” she said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “Not big ones. Just little things. Birds, rabbits, stuff like that. It doesn’t hurt them—it just takes them apart.”

I felt like I might throw up. “That’s what you’ve been doing? Taking animals to that... that *place*?”

Her hands twisted the hem of her sweatshirt again. “I didn’t at first. I just watched. But it’s easier if you help. It doesn’t look at you as much.”

I couldn’t breathe. My chest felt tight, like there was a weight pressing down on it. “And what happens if you stop? If you don’t... help it?”

She didn’t answer. She just looked at me, her eyes wide and shiny, like she was daring me to figure it out for myself.

“Trisha,” I said, barely above a whisper. “You’re scaring me.”

“I’m sorry,” she said, and for the first time, her voice cracked. “But you shouldn’t go back out there. It knows that you know. If you go back it will want more.”

  
I haven't been sleeping well since then. I have no fucking idea what to do. The obvious idea was to tell our pastor, but Trisha says that won't work. Whatever it is, this is not the first time somebody has tried to get rid of it. I've been on some weird forums lately trying to figure this out, but she told me to stop. It doesn't like being watched. It doesn't like being looked for. Even as I'm writing this, I'm filled with dread. It's as old as the trees and it moves like the wind and I hear scraping on my windows. 

Any help is appreciated, but I don't know how much more I can talk about it. I don't want to think about it more than I have to, I don't want to go out there ever again. I have the chance to get away but I think it's too late for Trisha.
