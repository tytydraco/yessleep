My friend was coming over, so I had to do laundry.

Up until this point, she had been patient with me. Maybe even coddling. 

I could tell her that I was tired, so she wouldn’t come over, but she would read that as me passively-aggressively telling her to shove off, which would go back to my point about giving in to my sensitivity. 

The pause that followed was filled with internal questioning. Did she feel bad about what she said? Am I acting weird now, taking too long to answer, showing that she got to me? Was she distracted by Netflix again? I couldn’t tell. I could never tell with her.

“All right,” I finally said, “Lemme go ‘head and get this done right quick.”

“Okay,” she said.

“Gimme about an hour—” I said, “Gimme about an hour and a half.”

“Okay,” she said, “See you soon.”

The last thing I threw in my laundry bag was my favorite black paisley button-down. I tried not to wear it all the time, but all of my other shirts were plain and dark. The black paisley, though, was awesome. Nice and subtle. It didn’t make me look like I was trying too hard. I would always get compliments on it when I went out– when I used to go out.

I should have just slung the sack over my shoulder and charged outside, into the darkness. But I did something stupid. I turned off all the lights, tossed one of my blackout curtains to the side, peered out my window, and stood watching the goings-on of the night. It was like sniffing alcohol before you took the shot.

So many people. Kids. Not kids, but bad ass, sloppy drunk college students. The most dangerous creatures in the world. I stood perfectly still and tried to blend into the darkness. 

Across the street, there was a glowing gas station with a few drug dealers posing like doormen. That’s where the laundromat was—tucked into the side of the building, like an appendix. 

I just had to worry about the bum sitting off to the side, slumped in his soiled, mismatched clothing. I looked at his face, and he looked at mine. 

*No.*

He couldn’t see me from this far up. Could he?

I lowered the bag to the floor and noticed how sweaty my palms had become. I wiped them on my dark plain shirt and shook my head, and took a breath.

I stepped into the night, right into the slow-moving, dense crowd of people. I felt fabric, hair, and skin brushing against me, and a thousand and one warm breaths enveloped me. They shoved past like they were pretending to ignore me so they could claim reasonable deniability while squeezing the life from my body.

There were rising sounds of laughter and conversation, along with creepy whispers. The air got heavier, the atmosphere grew darker, the people got closer, the noises got louder and louder until I heard–

“Psst. Are you okay?” 

 I looked around. I had made it through the crowd. I was standing on the street, right off the curb.  
“Yeah, I’m fine,” I said to… nobody. Nobody was paying attention to me. They just kept on moving like water in a creek. The hum of voices broken up by an occasional happy scream.  
On the other side of the street was more of the same. More people. More college kids. I squinted through the moving silhouettes. I couldn’t see the laundromat, but I spotted the bum again, looking at me. 

*No.*

He couldn’t see me. He was young, maybe in his thirties, which made me uneasy. It meant he hadn’t completely given up yet. If he really was watching me—if he had seen me leave my apartment unattended—I didn’t even want to think about that.

As I crossed the street, his expressionless gaze followed me. I deviated slightly from my path to double-check. His eyes tracked my every move. I gripped my laundry bag tighter, clenched my teeth.

*The nerve.* 

Why should I give him my money for doing nothing? Staring at me like I owed him something, as if I was supposed to take care of a grown man. A grown-ass man who wasn’t even family—a total stranger. I stepped closer, his eyes piercing like lasers. I shot my stare back at him, intimidated but unwilling to back down. As I neared the entrance, he began to reach for something under his coat. Then suddenly—

“Hey!” a college bro shouted to his friends. I jerked my head around instinctively, redirecting my icy glare at his dumb ass for startling me.

When I turned back to the door, the bum was gone.

Inside the lonely, lifeless laundromat, I found a machine in the corner, away from the windows. I loaded clothes and poured detergent.

I plopped a quarter in, heard the clink, followed by the satisfying clunk, and saw the digital tracker tick down. I continued until it became automatic.

The next quarter slipped from my fingers when I pressed it against the slot. It bounced onto the floor and vanished into a crack. I heard it land in a room below. I reached for another, but found only pocket lint. 

There might be a quarter or two in the organizer in my apartment. I looked across the street at my building, but the massive crowd cramming the sidewalks obscured the front door. No. If I went back, I’d stay inside. I’d rather just order new clothes online.

There was a stairwell in the corner with a low chain crossing the entrance. I stepped over it so easily that it clearly wasn’t meant to be a barrier.

Down the stairs, I started to smell something. It was like a dead rat in a vent. 

I ignored it. My quarter was down there in the middle of the room. 

Soft light filtered through a crack, illuminating it like a heavenly spotlight.

*Easy enough.*

That’s the last thing I remember until I woke up.

I heard whistling. My head felt numb and heavy, like it was full of blood. 

I opened my eyes, but everything was still dark.

I tried to put my arms down, but they stayed floating above my head. It felt like something was pulling at my legs—the weight of my own body. I realized I was hanging upside down from the basement ceiling.

Across from me, another man hung upside down. Tape covered his mouth. There were a few spots of blood on the tarp beneath him.

I looked above my head—well, below—and saw a few spots of my own blood.

Off the tarp was a perfect stack of quarters, surrounded by piles and piles of folded clothes. On top of one stack, I saw my favorite black paisley button-down, perfectly folded. My cube of clothing was colorful, while the others were all similar, only slightly different shades of beige.

Something was behind me. It was alive. 

Behind the other hanging man were shapes. Contours of small bodies. They stood three to four feet high and wore white blank masks. There were dozens of them, which meant dozens more at my back.

“Enough,” a cracked voice commanded. “Back to work!”

They scurried away. I could tell they were kids by the way they moved. 

When I couldn’t see them anymore, I heard chopping, cutting, scrubbing, and spraying.

A small, withered old lady approached from the background, sharpening a knife. I quickly reassessed, noticing the hanging position of my fellow hostage, the tarps, the sounds, and the smell. I looked at the clothes next to mine. It wasn’t laundry. 

It was neatly folded layers of dried human flesh. 

Before I could panic, she sliced the other man’s throat in one smooth stroke. I squeezed my eyelids shut, but I still heard draining, skinning, whistling.

Silence. Then footsteps approaching. I tried to calm myself.

*In through the nose, out through the mouth. In through the nose, out through the mouth.* 

A sudden *whoosh*, like air forced from lungs, then a thud.

I opened my eyes. The old woman lay sideways on the tarp.

Above her stood the bum, staring at me.

He untied me. I called the cops. 

After I answered a bunch of questions, I walked back home.

My friend was waiting on my steps.

“You did it!” she said. 

She hugged me. It could have been patronizing or sincere, but I couldn’t tell. I never could with her.
