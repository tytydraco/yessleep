When the moonlight is as bright as a full moon and her little sister together, like dawn at midnight, in a land that knows the deepest wells of darkness, that is Howling Night. I was learning the music of the forest, at the time, searching for the song. If it was there all along, my shadow wouldn't be so pale, I'd still be understood by the others.

Walking home, I could hear the sound in the trees, the grass. Each bird calls like an instrument. I am talking, of course, about the song. It is in all things, if you listen carefully, there is a rhythm, a kind of music. It pipes, it calls, it pulls you further than the horizon you can see. Then, suddenly, it was gone. Silence.

I cannot fear anything more than something that silences the song.

Across the road was a scattered mess of broken crates and wooden boxes. There were tire marks in an odd pattern, like someone had stopped, accelerated then swerved and hit the brakes at the same time. It's what it looked like.

I looked around, realizing that I could actually see silent cicadas. Such creatures never fell silent, they lived for the song, arriving just for their mass solo. With such a beautiful and esteemed part of the song, why would they fall silent?

I clapped once loudly and that seemed to set things back in motion, slowly, starting with the tenacious opera of the cicadas and with a few of their backups on the edges, but a quiet sort of sound in the swamps. I left the scene of the road, feeling warned by the break in the song.

I shivered, the premonition bothering me. I took out my wooden flute and trilled a radius. With such a cheerful chirp, the swamp camp alive and everything forgot its concentration and relaxed into the song. With the spirits dancing freely, I almost forgot the coldness I had felt, the moment of terror creeping in on the edges of my mind.

The helicopter overhead shone a light on me as I walked the old road, and then went out over the swamp somewhere. I worried they might be ATF, and hurried along to Uncle Veldemont's shack. His blue soul lantern was glowing lazily and the sound of his mouth harp was bouncing across the black-mirror waters. No ATF raids tonight, so I relaxed.

I greeted him with a mocking tone from my flute, and the timbre of his instrument went from annoyed to overjoyed in one hit. He had a jug of cranberry moonshine over his arm, finger through the loop poetically. He was savoring the pull, rinsing his mouth like a catfish.

"You gonna share that juice?" I asked him. His eyes smiled while his beard dripped stupidly.

"Still's out. Thought you'd bring back my all-purpose nice and sharp. All you brought was your sour music." Uncle Veldemont said with his heavy accent. Where he learned to talk is a mystery.

"The haft broke. I'll fix it." I swore, twirling my flute in one hand and my other hand raised in promise.

"Haft of oak just up and broke?" Uncle Veldemont didn't believe me.

"Or I lost the head when I swung it up and over. It arched into the pond." I reached for the moonshine and got my hand whapped.

"I'll arch you into the pond if you show up without it again. And you get to help me play catch up on the woodpile when you do." Uncle Veldemont nodded at the dwindling wood for the still.

"Give me a reason to visit." I complained.

"So, I don't come find you." Uncle Veldemont offered.

"Seems like a good reason." I agreed, worried he would.

"I found something out on the road, big mess." I changed the subject.

"Heard gunshots and Dogman getting in a fight." Uncle Veldemont told me. "You best be staying until morning."

"I'll not stay until morning. I'm not scared." I said. I had forgotten the feelings of terror from earlier. My amnesia was cured instantly when I was walking home later, humming loudly to myself when I realized the swamps had again forgotten the lyrics to the forest song. Terror gripped me, as nothing could possibly frighten me more than something that could take away all the music.

My soul is very young, I was only ever there when they made the Elk Bone Whistle. You might call it a dream, but only because you do not have the word, or rather I cannot give you the word, because I don't know the word for it. Whatever it is, I am still there, even when I am eating my fruit loops.

I can hear it in the early dawn, a phantom piping. It calls from the mist between the night and the morning, a sound like the relief of the sunrise. The call that all is well, the first song. I've not done much, but I did that, and it is all that matters to me.

Something was in the swamps, something had the Elk Bone Whistle. I stared into the swamps for a long time and I knew the swamps were looking back at me. There was a sound, the cicadas and their friends, but there was no music.

Dread filled me, horror crept up like mud between my toes. It sucked at me, taking the light from my eyes, slowing my quickness to laughter, pulling my essence like cranberry moonshine into the hog's lips. It was the mud, it was the hog lips and it was the eyes in the darkness, the staring predatory eyes of the angry thing that should not be.

Then there was its growl, a resonance of malevolence. It was anti-music, a sound of betrayal and pain and disharmonious vibrations. It was hungry and pure evil, rising before me in the swamp.

"Dogman." I recognized the monster. My eyes refused to see more than a shadow, my nostrils refused to recognize the rot and the musk of the beast's fetid mat of skin. The shimmer of its claws, ripples of its massive muscles and the thickness of its canine neck bore out the uncanny resemblance to a giant man. No man had the face of fangs and the eyes of black ink that this one had.

And then my soul withered as it rent the air with its split voice. It raised its jaws, opened, and bellowed a klaxon, a whine, a howl so perversely deep and unnatural that for a moment I thought I would be run down by a bullet train. The red wave of the noise knocked me into the brackish waters and the beast tore around me in a circle, splashing and crashing through the swamp in a rampage.

Trembling I crawled out of the leech-infested water back onto the road. The headlights of a truck on the highway above lit up the scene for a second, like a lightning flash. Dogman stood dripping and panting, ready to destroy the trespasser. Id' always understood the deeper Malais Bogs to be his home, but he was here, on my path, in my song, in my story, ready to end my young life.

I realized whatever had happened earlier, with the wreck, possibly the helicopter, any of it could be related. My mind raced weirdly, trying to come to terms with getting killed by a towering dog in the middle of the swamp in the early hours under the super moon. It was better than thinking of the elk's cry, how its breath, its final breath, the sound of its voice could actually be seen with your eyes. The elk exhales as a mist, a fog of living vapor, and in this phantom cloud, the voice of the elk as part of the song. A swan's song.

Holding my wooden flute, I tried to take back the song that Dogman had robbed me of. I played fiercely and Dogman stood, his breath a rancorous and vampiric mist, choking me and stealing my energy. I gasped on his toxic dog breath, and tried not to think about all the things that dogs like to lick to get their breath so stanky.

As Dogman's monster tongue flicked out slowly, I turned away, Sigourney Weaver style. Dogman licked my cheek in a horror-monster's kiss and I shuddered, repulsed and horrified, trying to suppress my final girl scream. If I belted out my terror at his salivations, he'd bite my head clean off.

As Dogman stood back up, I played on my flute, calming the monster. When the beast was soothed, it wandered away. From deep within the swamps, the place where he belonged, Dogman called back, the mournful howl at peace.

The next day there were reports all across the county on the public broadcast and on the radio. Dogman's rampage had cost millions in insurance, as he had destroyed vehicles parked near the swamp. His appetite for tearing apart and biting cars was quirky, and I doubted half the stories were true.

People around here can get insurance from damage caused by wildlife. Clever insurance saleswomen, known as The Twins, keep pointing out that there is no evidence of an animal. The insurance doesn't cover cryptids, unfortunately.

I asked Uncle Veldemont about it, and he says the ATF made him in a lab. I don't think that story is true, wearing tin foil hats on the super moon won't help anyone's insurance premiums. You can still try.

Dogman is still out there, but the search continues for those guilty of dumping in Malais Bogs. Dogman was blamed for the death of Tom Brackin, but he was really mixed up with the same mafia that dumps the toxic waste out there. Bigger fish to fry, Tom might have said, if he hadn't tripped and fallen backwards onto sixteen low caliber bullets out there one night.

He didn't trip, Dogman pushed him.

Even Uncle Veldemont has become paranoid, if that's what I should call his barbed wire still and the gatling gun he built in his garage. He wears the tinfoil hat so people will think he is crazy and leave him alone. That makes sense.

Dogman is out there, but the truth is something we will never know.
