I stumbled out from the cave, [terrified.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11s0qai/i_was_hired_as_a_fire_lookout_the_archway_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  My legs didn't seem to work properly.  Everything around me was wrong, the colors, the shadows, the shapes of the trees and the sounds of the singing birds sitting on their branches.  

This world was not my own.  And I needed to get out.  

NOW.

Running as fast as I could through the forest, I remembered how I had come to be in this place.  As a Park Ranger trainee, I’d been on a fire lookout assignment and had been sent to confront a few campers who had made a bonfire without a permit - in an off-limits area.  But I had stumbled through a gateway to another world in the process, becoming lost in this place.  Trapped in another dimension where humanoid creatures with gray skin and four arms hunted people in the purple-tinged darkness.  

I fell flat on my face, landing hard after tripping over something.  

A vine?  

No.  Whatever it was, it was thin and sharp and had hurt me badly.  The piano wire or whatever it was had cut across my shins, and I felt the warmth of blood trickling from the skin.  

The traps.  I'd forgotten all about the traps David had set, all throughout this part of the forest, to keep him safe from the creatures in this terrifying world.  

"Come back," I heard David yelling over my shoulder from the darkness.  "It's not safe!  You must come back!" 

But I didn't listen.  I scrambled back to my feet, and began to run.  My only thought was to get to the archway.  The place where I’d entered this world.  The portal back to Earth had to be there.  It HAD to be.   

David’s voice could be heard receding into the distance behind me.  I shuddered involuntarily, thinking about how I had seen him in the darkness of the cave, eating something like a rat or a mouse.  Not only that, but his arms!  His arms had been too many.  There was an extra pair of hands working at the hairy flesh of the vermin he'd been eating.  The bloody fur and the tearing sounds of him ripping chunks from the creature's body with his teeth were too much to think about.  

At first I thought maybe he was lying to me from the beginning, and that he was from this place all along.  Maybe he was born here and was trying to keep me trapped in this place.  But the more I considered it, the more I realized that idea didn't sit right with me.  

David was NOT a denizen of this terrible violet-tinted world.  No, he was from Earth.  The way he spoke, talking about Fire Tower 14, which he said he had worked at, proved that he was not from here.  He was from Earth. 

My mind began to work out what this meant and came to the conclusion that being in this world changed you over time.  Being here, eating the foraged food and breathing the purple-tinged air.  All of it was toxic to people from our world.  And it caused side effects that were likely permanent.  

I only hoped I hadn’t been here long enough for a change to occur in ME.  

I shuddered at the thought of an extra pair of arms splitting open the flesh of my abdomen and reaching out, grabbing anything they could get their hands on.  HUNGRY.  Desperate for food.  For blood and flesh and…

Fuck.  

I needed to get out of this place.  

Running through the woods more carefully now, I lifted my feet high off the ground to avoid tripwires, and hoped that I didn’t stumble into a spike-filled pit or some other deathtrap which David had planted.  

Before being hired as a fire lookout, David had served in the British Military, in the SAS - a highly trained branch similar to the Special Forces in America.  He was a deadly shot with a rifle, and I no longer had mine with me.    

I picked up my pace, hearing the sound of him coming after me through the forest.  He was injured, and that would slow him down, but he also knew this place far better than I did.  He knew where the traps were located and how to avoid them.  Whereas I was just hoping to be able to find my way back to the archway.  The possibility of getting lost forever in the wilderness of this strange world occurred to me briefly, but I tried not to think about it.  

Trying to remember the way we’d traveled through the forest, I stepped tentatively across the ground, no longer running, but slowly walking through the trees now.  I was terrified of stepping on a spike or tumbling into a pit with spikes at the bottom, ready to impale me.  David had told me more than once to NEVER go out alone, since he had placed traps everywhere in this area.  

There was a noise close behind me and I looked back to see David was following me from a distance, gaining on me, and I picked up my pace and began to run again.  

“Come back,” he called after me, his voice sounding different now - distorted and wrong.  “It’s not safe!”

Breaking into a sprint, I hoped to lose him in the darkness.  For a time, it seemed to work.  He was slower due to his injuries (or his mutations) and was hobbling when I saw him again, trailing me from a distance now.  

Confident that I’d managed to escape the section of forest where he was hiding his traps, I began to make my way towards the archway.  There were certain landmarks David had shown me to find my way back to it, but none of them looked quite the same at night.  In fact, nothing looked the same at night.  

I was starting to worry that I'd become completely lost, when I finally saw the huge oak tree with its one low branch that pointed the way.  Following David’s prior advice, I continued traveling that direction.  

After a long period of walking, I realized the sun had begun to rise - looking purple and bloated and wrong as it always did in this world.  But at least it gave another indication of which direction I should be walking towards.  And it helped to light the way, making the landmarks more obvious as I came across each one.  

Here was the babbling brook which I would follow for a little while.  And there was the strange boulder that looked like a face.  

I felt a pang of regret at leaving David behind, after he’d saved my life, showing me how to survive in this world.  But then I shook my head and reconsidered.  

No, I couldn’t go back to that cave.  

Maybe he was eating rats now, but what if tomorrow he developed a taste for my flesh?  What if I woke up to find him hunched over me, eating my leg or my foot?

No.  Going back was not an option.  

If David was still following me, there was no indication of it.  I couldn’t hear him chasing me anymore and he wasn’t calling after me, maybe because he was worried about alerting the creatures to his presence.  

The clearing where the archway had been was not far now.  It was just another ten minutes or so of walking, and I was just hoping it would be there this time.  If it wasn’t, I was completely unsure of what I would do.  I’d been trying not to think about that part of things, since the idea of the portal not being there was too much to bear.  

“Come back,” someone called out from the woods suddenly, startling me.  It was David.  At least, it sounded like him.  

“It isn’t safe!” another voice called out from my right, sounding sped up, then slowed down, like a tape recorder running low on batteries.  

Leaves crunched on the ground behind me and ahead of me.  From all angles there were voices calling out in distorted tones.  

“Come back!”

“It isn’t safe!” 

“CROME BYACKK!”

“GRESTSN’T SAYFF!”

The more they said it the more the words didn’t sound like words anymore, but just strange, alien noises.  They mingled together in an echoing cacophony of sounds.  

My heart began to pound against my sternum like a jackhammer from the inside.  My palms were sweating as I tried to lift my legs to run but realized they wouldn’t move.  

It was at that moment that I observed the fact that I didn’t have my rifle, and it dawned on me for the first time that I’d left it back at the cave.  With David.  

And as that thought went through my mind the trees and shrubs all around me began to rustle and sway, moving aside to reveal the gray, four-armed figures who had been lying in wait.  

*If they know you like a particular spot, they’ll start to wait for you there.  They’re adept hunters.  And they know exactly the way to ambush someone.  Trust me, I’ve seen it for myself,* David had told me.

Yeah, I thought bitterly.  He’d seen it firsthand with the rat in the cave.  As he was turning into one of them - and he was becoming a pretty good hunter himself.  

The pack of creatures closed in on me from all angles, and I sucked in a terrified breath, unable to scream or run or do anything at all.  

It was hopeless.  

Or so I thought.  

The blast of the rifle was deafening in the stillness of the forest, and I winced at the sound of it, as it took the head off the creature closest to me, which was about to grab hold of me.  

“RUN!” David screamed from the trees, and this time I could tell very clearly that it was his voice.  But at the same time he looked different.  He’d left his shirt back at the cave and the extra pair of arms on his abdomen were plainly visible now, and I could see they were holding the rifle.  With four hands moving rapidly, David reloaded the gun in a fraction of the time, then had the sights up to his eye again and was ready to fire.  

I did as he asked, trying to pry my eyes away from the horrifying image of what was happening.  The creatures were abandoning me to go after the bigger threat, and I saw them stomping through the brush towards him as he fired the gun again, taking off the top of one of their skulls in a bloody spray.  A chunk of gray brain matter landed on my cheek, and I brushed it off in disgust.  

Getting to my feet, I began to run.  But one of the creatures stopped me.  The one David had just shot was still alive somehow, and grabbing onto my leg - digging its talon-like claws into the flesh of my ankle, gritting its teeth and staring at me with a brainless, evil hunger.  

I screamed and howled in pain, turning around and using my other foot to stomp on the thing’s face.  As it spit out broken teeth it smiled at me, squeezing and digging its nails in deeper, until I could feel blood pouring out and soaking the fabric of my sock.  

“Come BACK!” it croaked in David’s voice.

Finally I stepped on the thing’s arm, wrenching my leg free from its grip.  It was like the thing felt no pain at all as it was immediately trying to come after me again with its other good hands.  It was like all it desired was to cause pain, but felt none of its own.  

Trying not to think about that, I turned away and began to run, limping on my one injured leg, ignoring the pain as I broke into a sprint.  

And just as I got out of sight from David I heard him cry out in anguish, his screams cut short as one of the creatures began to chew on his windpipe - and all that could be heard after that was a hushed gurgling sound far back in the distance, as he drowned on his own blood. 

Somehow I knew without even seeing it happen.  

David was dead.   

But I had no time to mourn for him. 

I rushed through the trees, trying to ignore the pain in my leg, hoping with every fiber of my being that the archway would be there.  I spoke the words in my mind and out loud over and over again, like a mantra, as the clearing came closer and drew into focus.  

“Please be there, please be there, please be there.”

And when I came out from the trees and into the clearing I almost couldn’t believe my eyes.  

Was this a dream?  A mirage?  A fantasy that would disappear when I blinked my eyes and opened them again?

No.  

It was there.  It was actually there.  

The archway was back.  

And just in the nick of time.  

Without a moment’s hesitation I ran through it, terrified that it would disappear before I got the chance to step through the threshold and back into my dimension.  

Like a man terrified of elevators and worried the box will drop out at any second, I leapt through the archway and back into the glorious golden sunlight of our world.  

I realized immediately what I had been missing, as the blue sky above could be seen through the trees and I noticed I was truly warm for the first time in days.  As if I had been walking in shadow, and only now was stepping out into the sun.

As I began to walk back towards the road, I took a nervous look back over my shoulder at the archway. 

And I froze when I saw the disturbing sight behind me was still there.   

I could still see the purple sky on the other side, and that could mean only one thing.  

The portal was still open.  

Terrified of what that implied, I shuddered and continued walking, looking back every so often for creatures, and hoping that the archway would disappear - this time for good.  But it didn’t.  

As I left it behind in the trees and lost sight of it, my last glimpse showed that evil purple sky shining through from the other side - insidiously waiting for another hiker to stumble through.  Or for something ELSE to emerge from the other side.  

At least if I have to face another one of those creatures, it will be on my turf, I thought to myself with some slight reassurance.  But I didn’t have a weapon.  And I would need backup.  

I wasn’t out of the woods yet.

After limping through the forest for ten or fifteen minutes, eventually I found the road.  A part of me had been worried it wouldn’t be there.  That this would be just another world that looked like ours - one of a million different potential places that the archway could take you to - and that I would find myself wandering through some unknown forest again, set upon by some new breed of ravenous creatures with a thirst for blood.  But thankfully this did look like the road I had been on before.  And I could even see the distinctive tread marks in the mud from what appeared to be a Jeep.  Maybe from the day when Ross had dropped me off in this very spot.  

I felt a twinge of anger at the thought of my supervisor, and decided I would let him have it the moment I saw him.  He was supposed to be my backup.  I was supposed to be learning from him.  Instead, he’d let me go out on my own.  And now look at what had happened.  

Limping along the shoulder of the gravel road, eventually I saw the fire tower come into view up ahead.  It came into focus gradually, emerging from the trees that hid it from my sight.  

The Jeep was there, and I realized instantly what that meant.  

Ross was up there.  Not out looking for me like he should have been.  If he’d been where he was supposed to be none of this would have happened.  

I climbed the wooden steps leading up to the fire tower, getting more and more enraged as I got further up, and closer to the man who I now believed was responsible for all this.  My aching leg was bloodied and I could feel it swelling and my pant leg tightening around it.  

Finally I reached the top and threw open the door, to find Ross sitting at the table reading a book, drinking a cup of coffee.  He looked surprised to see me, and shocked at the sight of me.  

“Holy shit,” he almost screamed, knocking his coffee cup over.  The brown liquid spilled all over the pages of his paperback.  “You’re back!”

“That’s right, motherfucker,” I hissed, limping towards him.  I could feel my face turning hot and red.  

His eyes widened further.  

“What’s wrong with your face?  Are you… Are you okay?  You’re turning… purple…”

I didn’t know what to say to that.  I looked in the mirror to my left and saw that he was right.  I didn’t look like myself at all.  I looked like a monster made of rage at that moment, my face purple with anger.

Suddenly all of the fight left me and I realized how utterly exhausted I was.  I heaved out a great sigh and crumpled to the floor of the fire tower cabin.  I collapsed on the floor, unable to understand what was happening to me.  I didn’t feel like myself at all. 

And as I did that I felt something writhing beneath me.  A squirming feeling in my abdomen, like fingers reaching out from inside, trying to poke and tear their way through the skin of my belly.  

I screamed, pulling up my shirt and clutching my abdomen, feeling the skin for a bulging pair of hands, or a face, picturing the movie Alien.  

But there was nothing.  No indication of anything growing or mutating inside of me.  Except a slight tingling there.  Like fingers gently brushing up against my skin from the inside.  Tickling me, very lightly.  

“No,” I said aloud, still clutching myself tightly.  

“Dude, what the fuck happened to you?” Ross asked, looking at me with grave concern.  “You’ve been gone for two days.  And now you come back screaming and grabbing at yourself.  Your face just went purple as an eggplant, like you had anaphylactic shock for a few seconds, and now it’s back to normal again.  Tell me, please.  Because I am genuinely very fucking concerned.  What the hell happened to you out there?”

I took a few seconds before answering.  I honestly didn’t know what to say.  Until the words began spilling out of me.  

“The same thing that happened to David.  That’s what happened to me.”

There was a delayed reaction as it took several seconds for him to register the name.  But then he did and his jaw dropped.  

“How… Where did you hear that name?  How do you know about David?”

“I met him,” I said, and was about to continue, when I heard a sound from beneath the fire tower.  

It sounded like someone coming up the stairs.  

I shot up to my feet, my eyes darting around the room.  

“Where’s the rifle?  You need to get your rifle!  Now!”  

Ross didn’t know what to make of this at first, and was about to question me, but then the look on my face seemed to convince him.  He ran over to the gun rack on the wall and pulled down his rifle.  Checking to make sure it was loaded, he took the safety off.  

“Is that David?” he asked.  

I shook my head, no.  

“What the hell did you get us into, exactly?” he asked nervously.  

But before I could respond there was someone at the door.  There was a sound of scratching.  Long nails against the wood, scraping it.  And there was a distorted gray face at the window, looking in at us.  

“COME BACK,” it demanded.

Ross held the scope up to his eye and got ready to fire at the door.  

Then the footsteps began to recede, going back down the stairs.

“What the fuck was that thing,” Ross asked, lowering his gun.  

I tried to gather my thoughts, trying to figure out how to explain it all.    

“Those things are deadly,” I said.  “And they’re not from this world.  They’re smart, and they’re almost impossible to kill.  Right now they’re retreating.  Gathering reinforcements.  Assembling a hunting party.”

“How can you possibly know all this?”

I led him outside and pointed down at them below.     

They were going back for more of their own kind, to bring them into our world.  As I looked down from the lofty fire tower I could see them moving quickly into the forest.  Some were going back towards the archway, but not all of them.  

They were planning on staying here.  Making this their new home.  After all, there was an abundant food supply.  And no real reason to leave.  

I tried to sum up what had happened as well as I could in such a short time.  It was difficult for him to believe - but the proof had been right in front of him.  The monster had been right outside the fire tower.  And we’d seen more of them below us.  There was no way to fake that.

We needed to do something.  Fast.

“Okay…  Assuming you and I haven’t lost our minds and just hallucinated whatever the fuck those things were, I’ll take your word for all this.  So, what are we going to do?” my supervisor asked reluctantly.  

I considered this for a few long moments.  

“How much gas do we have between the generator and the Jeep?” I asked.  

His eyes went wide after he realized why I was asking.  

For a while he didn’t answer.  But then he nodded his head and waved for me to follow him.  

“Enough,” he said, as I followed him down the stairs.  “There’s enough.”

You might have heard about the wildfire on the news.  It was a big one.  There was speculation it was caused by hikers or careless campers - but the real reason why the blaze started was never truly discovered.  No one would have guessed it was set by two rogue park rangers - and fire lookouts, no less.  

The forest fire spread and took out a lot of homes, but everyone who lived in the area made it out alive.  Thankfully no one died.  I don’t know how I would have lived with myself if they had.  

I was fired from the Park Ranger Service after what happened, as was Ross.  With all the news coverage and social media outrage, someone had to be blamed for what happened.  And we were the most viable scapegoats.  Especially since we’d been seen fleeing the area long before the blaze was ever reported.  

Our excuse was that the fire started near the road, and we had been down by the jeep when we noticed it.  Believing our lives were in danger, we’d fled from the area before being able to radio in to report the wildfire.  

Unfortunately, there’s no way of really knowing if we killed those things.  Or if we destroyed the archway.  Maybe it can’t even be destroyed.  Maybe those things can’t be killed.  

It’s been years since all of this happened.  I’m terrified of the forest these days.  I stay out of the woods, and away from nature entirely.  

I live in a big city, far away from all that business.  I work in a high rise and live in an apartment building.  And when people ask if I want to go camping I say, “Hell no.”

People tell me I’m strange.  They talk about me behind my back.  

One thing that people find peculiar about me is that I never go swimming.  I never take my shirt off.  And I don’t date or try to find a girlfriend, despite people trying to set me up.  

I don’t want anyone to see the changes that have been happening.  The arms that have fully sprouted from my abdomen, and have a mind of their own.  

I try to tie them down, to strap them down with duct tape so they can’t move.  But they always manage to free themselves.  They’re very crafty in that way.  And they brought with them an unusual appetite.  

I’ve found myself craving the most disturbing things.    

Things that crawl and skitter in the subways and in the sewers.  Things I have to chase and kill and rip flesh from bones with my bare teeth.  

It scares me to think about what I’m becoming, and part of me will always be terrified.  A voice in my mind screaming that this is wrong, and I need to get help.  

But another part of me is getting used to it. 

A primordial, alien part of me, is starting to very much enjoy the [HUNT.](https://youtu.be/5V3obVKO4xA)
