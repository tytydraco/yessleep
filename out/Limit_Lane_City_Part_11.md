"It was the church. 

From the first day on, they hated me. I was born with white hair and the preacher called it a bad omen. In this deeply religious village, they all blindly followed his command. 

My parents always treated me unfairly compared to my siblings. As if everything I did was somehow wrong. As if I was to make amends. They probably still loved me. I think they were afraid to show it. They never showed it. 

I worked just as hard as my siblings, I never got their praise because I was just 'making up for being wrong'. I was different in so many ways. I just had other interests than my siblings. I was never a bad kid. The first incident happened when I was 15.

I've always loved animals and they loved me, especially our family dog. We were inseparable. One day my younger brother took it for a walk and didn't return at the usual time. I was worried. When I went out to look for him, there was already a crowd forming at the lake. 

Apparently the dog jumped in in an attempt to catch a duck. It got stuck on some drift wood and drowned. As I arrived at the lake, two of my neighbours had already freed and carried my dog to the shore. It was so horrible, I ran towards them and started crying. 

I demanded they give me my dog and they didn't hesitate. I sat at the shore crying and pressing the lifeless dog against my chest. It was so cold and wet. Suddenly I felt a twitch. The dog was snapping for air and started barfing water. I was so happy. It fully recovered even after spending multiple minutes under the surface. 

The villagers that saw it all happen started calling me a witch. I think it was the preacher's son who started it. I hated him. They said what I did was against God's plan for my dog. They called it witchcraft. I didn't even do anything, they just liked to find things to blame me for. I'm sure, if that happened to any of my siblings, they would have called it a miracle. 

I endured their gossip about me for so long but one night a few years ago ultimately sealed my fate. I was feeding the horses at the stable that was a 30 minute walk from the main village. As I made my way home, I got caught in an unexpected rainstorm. It started so quickly and was just too much to walk through. I ran towards the chapel that stood in a clearing about half way to my home. My family dragged me here a lot. We never missed a Sunday. But I never really stepped foot into a church on my own before. You can guess why.

The rain was so heavy, knocking against the windows. It was quite loud inside the chapel. I knew it would take a while for me to wait out the storm so I sat down at the pues. I used this chance to ask god why my village hated me so much. I asked him to change their minds somehow. To change my life. I wanted to be like them. I guess he did. He changed my life forever. 

There was a loud thundercrack. It echoed through the whole building. At first I didn't realise what happened until I saw the fire spreading. It happened so quickly. The old chapel was built from wood that soon turned to ashes in front of my eyes. I didn't know what to do so I evacuated. I ran outside and watched the building light up like a huge campfire. 

The rain was still going down like crazy. I was completely drenched within seconds. My head felt so empty and sad. There was nothing I could have done but watch. Then I heard a silent cracking sound from the edge of the forest. It jumpscared me. There was a boy standing in the tree line, the preacher's son. He was staring right at me, at me and the inferno behind me. I think there was a girl standing behind him, a blond girl. I had never seen her before. I didn't remember her up until right now, actually. 

Anyways, he was staring at me and I stared back. Within the blink of an eye he turned and ran. I knew he was going to tell his father. He would frame it as if I burned the church down. I knew they would believe him, they were going to find a way to blame me. I thought this was the last straw. The last proof they needed to fully declare me a witch, probably chase me away or worse. I was devastated. I shouted after him but he didn't stop. I started bawling and ran into the other side of the forest, away from the village. I needed to escape. 

I ran for a while through the storm until I found it. A staircase in the middle of the woods. It led downwards, neon signs at the walls. It was completely alien and I was sure that it couldn't have been here before. I would have come across it at some point. I heard thunder now multiple times a minute, and knew I had to seek shelter quickly. At first I just went far enough to be safe from the rain but then I heard them. They must have been searching for me. They sounded so angry. I couldn't bear it. I went further down and eventually landed in limit lane city. 

There was no rain anymore. There was no angry mob chasing me. The people here didn't hate me, they just ignored me. At first I was glad I found this place. Even after I realised I couldn't go back to my village anymore. It was fine. There wasn't much I lost, not more than I gained. It was my opportunity for a fresh start, at least I thought so. 

The god wouldn't let that happen. He knew somehow. He called me 'witch' from my first day on. I don't know why he did it. He never gained anything from it. All it did was serve as a reminder that I wasn't from here and I probably didn't belong here either. And now I see that as well. I hope that's what he wanted. I'm leaving. I don't know where too though. I can't return to the village. I hope I will find a better place in our world again. It's time to leave this place behind me." 

Miranda lit a match and threw it towards the dry grass growing around the wooden chapel. We had to do it before we were to enter the forest. Before we would ultimately find that staircase. The grass quickly caught fire. Miranda didn't look happy, she didn't look sad either. She might have looked satisfied, but not in a positive way. In a way of finally getting rid of something that has been quietly bothering for so long. 

The flames climbed the building and fed on its wooden beams. It was a beautiful spectacle. 

"There was something inside earlier. I have only seen it rush by. You saw it, right? What was it?", I asked.
She kept staring straight into the raging fire. My eyes burned if I tried to copy her. I was glad the fire stayed fixated on the church and didn't spread to any of the surrounding buildings. They didn't seem to care at all. 
"It was that boy. The preacher's son. He was in there, looking at meâ€¦He looked the same way he did when he found me outside the chapel in the forest." 
He couldn't have been real, I thought. Maybe some fragment of the outsides weirdness, like when I saw the man get eaten by that bear. This place was unpredictable. I was glad Miranda decided to burn the church down. It was clearly only here for her. 

Maybe the gods' way of reminding her what awaits her outside this reality. After a moment, she turned towards me. 
"I can't get that girl out of my head now. I totally deleted her from my memory for so long and even now, I barely remember anything about her. Thinking back, she looked a bit like your friend."
