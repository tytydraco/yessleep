About a week ago, my best friend called me about getting cosmetic surgery to hide some scarring on her face.

I was happy for her. Growing past her pain rather than letting it consume her. I was ready to support her all the way.

Until she said the price.

$50.

Fifty dollars for cosmetic surgery.

Surely it had to be a scam right? Or some quack in a back alley.

But no matter what I said, I simply couldn't convince her to go somewhere else. Her mind was made up. When I tried, she snapped at me.

"You're trying to sabotage me, aren't you?! Trying to send me to some expensive quack who'll mess it up!"

I eventually managed to calm her down. I was just worried about her. I didn't try to convince her anymore.

I wish I did.

The day after the surgery, she came over to my apartment. She looked great. Her skin was softer, her scars weren't even visible, she was absolutely glowing.

We talked for a while, and I noticed something. A strange sound coming from beneath her skin. Like rushing water but... thicker. It got louder whenever she opened her mouth to speak.

I tried to write it off as paranoia. I was just worried about that surgeon she had gone to. But she looked great. Surely I had no reason to worry, right?

We said our goodbyes with smiles as she went home that evening.

Evening?

I hadn't noticed it at the time, but yes. She had been there all day. And neither of us had eaten. My stomach panged, but I watched as she left... she didn't even seem bothered by the hunger.

That night, she posted a picture of herself on Instagram. I opened it, used to it at this point. She loved posting pictures of her makeup or just herself when she was having a good day.

I nearly screamed when I saw the photo, and actually dropped my phone.

There was something black leaking out of her. Out of her eyes, her ears, even seeping between her perfectly white teeth.

I turned off my phone. I didn't touch it again for the rest of the night.

I made myself dinner and went to bed, hoping that sleep could ease my nerves, or that I would wake up and it would just be a bad dream.

The next day, I got a call from an unknown number. I didn't answer it the first time. It called three more times.

I answered, and nearly swallowed my tongue.

The words came as no more than a whisper, and that only made my heart race faster.

"I've already fixed your friend. You're next."

I hung up, and immediately called my friend. She didn't answer. I called again and again. Nothing. I texted, nothing.

But she posted another picture. Her eyes were solid black now, and the same substance was running out of her nose.

It felt like I couldn't breathe. I closed and opened the app, hoping the image would fix itself. It didn't.

I didn't look at my phone for days after that, too scared of what I might see.

It wasn't until yesterday that I finally bit the bullet and went to her house. I had a spare key, and let myself in.

The house was too quiet.

I walked up the stairs to her bedroom with my heart pounding in my ears and dread filling every inch of my bones.

I found her on the bed. The skin of her face was... bubbling. Like Harry Potter polyjuice potion bubbling.

When she spoke, her voice was hoarse, like there was something in her throat, stopping her from making sound.

"I don't... feel so good..."

There was this awful stretching sound coming from her fake. Not her mouth. Her face. Her skin.

I could only stare with horror. Her eyes were black her hands were stained with what looked like ink...

And then it happened.

Her entire face popped.

I couldn't even see blood. It was all black, thick like tar, it splattered all over the room.

I heard a scream. It took me only seconds to realize that I had made the sound myself...

Because she had stood up. Skin hanging off of her skull in sheets... and spoke. Her voice wasn't hers.

"Join us. Let him fix you."

I raced home, trying to wash off the black substance that was staining my skin. It wouldn't come off. My fingertips are still black.

I got an ad on my phone today for cheap cosmetic surgery. I think I'm the next target...
