&#x200B;

We all huddled together in the middle of the street and began to make our way further along. None of the houses appeared to have any lights on, and other than the sound of pipes groaning from somewhere far away, there was no noise at all. The dread began to mount in our guts. This was a very new experience and one that felt unsafe at that. I noticed Ethan seemed especially afflicted as his head pivoted much more rapidly than the rest of ours. I suddenly remembered what he had asked me back during the scavenging run, and a lump formed in my throat. The next time we caught each other's glance, he coughed and stood up more confidently in an attempt to hide his concern. I wasn't buying it, however. Not only was he a terrible liar, but it was an act that I had seen too many times before.

  
  
One that I wouldn't ignore again.

  
  
"Are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine."

"Andi, you're standing outside on the porch. We never come out here unless it's to bury something."

Even standing on the safe concrete of the house, I could sense the uneasy pressure in my chest that the hills brought.

"I just wanted to be alone, Joel. It's the only place in the house I can count on to be empty."

I took a deep breath and stepped next to her, leaning my arms on the railing alongside her. As I did, I crossed one of my hands over to take hers. "This about Larry?"

She didn't respond. She just looked to the floor.

"I'm sorry, hun… I really didn't want to do it either."

"It's a lot more than that."

"What is it then?"

Andi shifted her gaze from the grass to where my hand held hers. "Joel… Don't you think it's time for us to go?"

My heart hit the floor with a hard crack at her question, "What?" I laughed nervously, "What do you mean?" I knew exactly what she meant, and she even called my bluff.

"You know what I mean, Joel."

I sighed, "Yeah. The exit."

"You told me. You told me we could go."

"I know, Andi, I just…"

"You just what? Joel, you said you didn't want this life for us. Didn't you mean that?"

"Yes, I did. Of course, I did. But I don't want to lose you, Andi. If we go down there, we have no idea what might be waiting."

She looked off to the hills and shook her head, "I don't understand. I thought this was your idea. You're the one who suggested we go."

"I know. I know I did, Andi. But I think that I was being rash. I was so caught up in the moment that I said it without thinking."

"I think that's a lie, Joel. I think you know it's down there and that the only way to get to it is if we go. So what really changed?" Her voice was chilling to me. She wasn't mad. She wasn't upset. She was just genuinely trying to understand.

"I just told you, Andi. I don't want to lose you. That fact has never changed."

"But why does it matter now, Joel? We teeter on the edge of death every day. Every basket run, every expired piece of food we eat, hell, even just standing out here on this porch, we might die. So why is this any different?"

"Because those are all things we know. If something goes wrong, we know how to fix it. But if we go down there and mess up one time, that's all it takes for one of us to lose the other."

"I know that, Joel! You don't think I don't care about losing you too? But I came to terms with that possibility when we decided to go because that's the risk we have to take if we're going to be free."

"But we don't have to take those risks, Andi. Especially not before we fully know what they are. There could always be another way out of here."

"You're only saying that because of-" She caught herself before she finished the sentence.

"What?"

"Nothing."

"No, Andi, I want to know."

She took a deep breath, then softly continued, "I'm not Rose, Joel…." My legs grew weak, and my throat began to tighten. "I know you're scared that that'll be me, and I know that you think it was your fault-"

"It was my fault."

"No," she said, placing a hand against my cheek. "It wasn't. And if we go, and I die, that is not your fault either."

"Andi, stop."

"You need to let go of what happened, Joel… Every day I see you hurting. Every time I catch you looking at me, it's the same longing in your eyes."

"It's not about that."

"It's not? Then what is it?"

water began to blur my vision as memories flooded in, "Andi, please…."

"What is it, Joel? What is bothering you so much?"

"The fact that I love you, Andi!" I said louder than I intended. She leaned back in surprise as I wiped a rouge tear from my cheek. It was the first time either of us dared say such a thing. "I love you, and every time I love someone, I lose them. And do you want to know the worst part? I always lose them because I'm the one who messes something up. I'm just this horrible monster that poisons everyone who knows me. But I can't be that anymore…." I said as I grabbed her hand and squeezed it. "I can't lose another person that I love, Andi. I'm not strong enough. I can't take that chance. And if you go down there, and if you die, I will never forgive myself. That guilt will eat me alive until I end up dead."

Andi didn't speak. She just stared back at me with watery eyes. Meanwhile, my tears flowed freely.

"Please… I am begging you, Andi. Please… I just can't… I- I-"

Before I could continue, she stepped forward and pulled me close, resting her head against my chest as she held me. I could feel my shirt becoming wet as warm, salty water began to spill from her eyes as well. "It's okay, hun. It's okay; we can stay here."

"I'm sorry, Andi; I just-"

"Stop that, Joel, it's okay. I'm right here."

I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself. "Larry just left… Maybe if there is an exit and he finds it, people will know what happened and come looking for us."

"Yeah. Maybe." Andi mumbled into my shirt.

I could tell that it wasn't what she wanted to hear right now and immediately felt awful for everything I had just said to her. Everything I had promised her. However, I didn't have much time to think about it after what she said next:

"I love you too, Joel." She looked up at me with a smile, "Just by the way."

I smiled back and pulled her into a kiss. The pressure of the hills was nothing at that moment. The conversation we just had was nothing at that moment. The poison I had infected Andi with; in my mind, it was nothing at that moment. 

It never was…

  
  
As we walked down through the dark suburban neighborhood, I realized that I had started fidgeting with the folded paper in my pocket. Andi's note. The one she had left for me the night that she departed. It was crumpled beyond belief, and the parchment had become soft and worn over the last year, a side effect of it spending every day in the same place. I withdrew my hand and focused on the area around us once again.

As we passed by a red house, Daniel suddenly spoke, "Wait a minute."

We all stopped and turned to him.

"What's up?"

"No, that can't be right," he muttered, barely audible. In the sterile orange light of the street lamps, I could see that his face had gone completely pale.

"What's going on, Dan? Everything okay?"

Dan shook his head and then started walking much faster down the street.

"Dan!" Bea shouted as we took off after him. He didn't stop; he just stormed forward, turning down a sudden intersection and further into the neighborhood.

"Daniel, you're freaking us out, man." Ethan called out, "What's going on?"

He continued for another minute without a response before stopping in front of a beautiful house. It was two stories and much larger than all of the other homes in the area. A garage was attached to the side of the main floor, and on the house itself, several large glass panes were peering into the home's dark interior. A window could be seen all the way up on the roof of the house, indicating an attic, as well as a basement window peaking from below. Bea, Ethan, and I stared at Daniel as he just looked at the structure in terror and confusion.

Bea stepped forward, "Dan? Are you going to tell us what's going on?"

Daniel took a shaky breath, then swallowed hard. "This… This is my neighborhood. This is my house."

Nobody moved as we took in what Dan had just said.

"Are you sure?" I asked.

He shook his head, "Positive.

"I mean, are you sure sure. A lot of places use the same house models and-"

"I'm sure, Joel." It was now my turn to swallow hard. I didn't want it to be true. Ever since we had stepped past our home upstairs, I had been trying to piece together the mysteries of this place. After our last run-in with the playhouse, some critical details had come to light.

Daniel started forward, but Ethan reached out to stop him.

"Whoa, what are you doing?"

"I'm going inside."

"Ha. No way you are," Bea snapped. "Your entire suburbs just show up in this place, and you want to go take a look around? That's the worst idea I've ever heard."

"Bea's right. This is definitely some sort of trap. Let's just keep moving." Ethan agreed

"No way. If my house is down here, I want to know why. I'm sick of this place playing games with all of us. You guys can wait out here, but I'm going in."

"Dan, no! Joel, would you please back us up on this?"

"Huh?" I grunted. Bea stared at me and made a confused face. She could sense something was on my mind but shrugged it off as there were more important matters at hand. I rushed to support her, "Oh, Um. Yeah. Dan, we should just keep going. This place has always been nothing but trouble. Nothing good can come from this."

Daniel looked at all of us, then back to the building.

"I know you want answers, but we hardly ever get those. You know that."

He sighed defiantly, "Alright, fine. Let's go."

We turned from the abode and started down the street back where we had come from. When we hit the main road again, we headed forward, traveling along the stretch for about five more minutes before coming to another catwalk. Across it, another door sat waiting, suspended above another moat.

Without a word, we started across. I took the lead; I wanted to get to the door first. The metallic clank of the catwalk beneath our feet matched my heartbeat: Rapid and erratic. I got the door and grabbed the handle, my heart sinking as I pulled.

"It's locked."

"What? Let me see." Bea said, skirting around Ethan and giving the handle a tug." Sure enough, the thing wouldn't budge. Bea gave the door a kick and muttered something under her breath. I knelt down and shined a light on the handle. The lock was unique in its design. It was a circular disk embedded into the handle with a perfectly rectangular hole for a key.

"Well, guess we won't be going this way." Ethan pointed out. Maybe there's another exit somewhere?"

"Maybe. It's worth a shot." Bea agreed. I nodded in affirmation while Daniel stared cautiously over his shoulder.

We began to walk the moat's perimeter, looking for another bridge that might lead to an escape. There was none to the left side of the colossal room, but as we looped our way back to the catwalk we had initially crossed, Ethan took off running.

"No, no, no, no…"

"Ethan? What's wrong-" 

I realized the answer as soon as the question left my lips. The door we had left open was now shut; the book Ethan had wedged under it was nowhere to be found. Ethan reached the barrier and began to claw his fingers along the cracks, hoping to tear it open. After a good minute of trying, he defeatedly traveled back to us.

"It's no good. We're trapped in here."

Bea bit her cheek, "That's not true. We still haven't checked the other side."

Daniel snickered, "Something tells me that even if there is a way out over there, this place isn't ready for us to leave."

I began to panic inside at Daniel's remark, "H-Hey now. That's not true. The door out of that school was locked, remember? This is the same deal. Just gotta find a key is all."

"In this place?" Ethan asked, "That could take weeks!"

"No, it won't." Daniel started. "If there's going to be a key anywhere, we know exactly where it will be."

"Daniel, no."

"Stop trying to put it off, Bea. The house wants us to go there, and you know it."

I clenched my fists. Dan was right. I didn't want him to be, but he was.

*TINK plonk tink TINK!*

Echoing from the ceiling high above us, deep within the dark. We could hear the creaking and rattling of pipes as the Curator moved to find us.

Bea pulled the gun, and we all ran to a nearby house and tried the door. Locked. We hopped the porch railing and ran to the house next door only to find the same thing. We started forward again, ready to repeat the process when Dan stuck his arm out.

"Look, we can run door to door all we want, but that thing is going to be down on the ground soon, and it's faster than us. There's only one house in this neighborhood I can get us into."

Bea grit her teeth but finally caved. She knew we were out of options. "Alright, let's go."

We sprinted through the streets with Dan at the helm, flying past the red house again and down the intersection. The sound of xylophone notes rang out somewhere behind us, this time on the same level. We didn't bother to turn back. We plowed up Dan's driveway and to the front door, trying the handle. To our surprise, it too was locked. The panic set in.

"Damn it, Dan, what now!?" Bea yelled.

"The garage!"

We turned back and ran over to the door. Dan flipped open a box on the side of the wall and began punching in a code. I prayed that there was actually power to the houses and not just the street. Ethan shined the good flashlight down the road as we waited, and the beam caught something barreling toward us at an alarming rate. 

Behind us, the keypad flashed red at an incorrect code. 

Dan swore under his breath and tried once more. This time, the keypad lit up green, and the labored sound of an engine rang out as the door was hoisted up. We didn't even wait until it was off the ground; we dropped to the floor, and all slid under. As I hopped up, I was greeted with a flashy yellow Ferrari. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to admire its craftsmanship; we made for the door into the house just as we heard the thing behind us pounding on its instrument and squealing like an injured pig. I saw it begin to squeeze its form beneath the crack just as we slammed the door shut and thrust the lock into place.

From the other side, we could hear it jostling the handle and throwing a tantrum that we had once again evaded it. I was certain that it was just as sick of losing us as we were of running into it. Once we had all caught our breath, we turned to see Daniel standing in awe at the sight before him. A fully furnished home was laid out before us. We currently stood in a kitchen that sparkled with nice appliances and granite countertops. Through a doorway, we could see a living room with a big TV, as well as a leather couch and two very nice recliners with a coffee table placed thoughtfully before them. Everything was clean, pristine, and untouched. Not even a layer of dust. The only thing that was slightly off was the dining room. It, too, was spotless, save for the vase of flowers that once decorated the sturdy oak table. They were dead and wilted.

"Wow, Dan. Beautiful place you got here." Ethan said. Bea gave him an elbow to the rib.

Dan shuffled forward slowly, taking in every detail. He gently ran his hand along the cold countertops before opening a cupboard above him. Inside, dozens of delicate glasses sparkled in the light.

"It's all exactly the same…" he picked up one of the cups and turned it over in his hand. He ran a thumb over a spot where the glass was chipped, "Every little detail."

While Dan was transfixed, Bea peered into the living room, then slowly made her way to the dining room, checking it as well, "Downstairs is empty."

"Good," I replied before turning to Dan. "You alright?" I asked, placing a hand on his shoulder.

He nodded, then set the cup out on the counter. I noticed tears welling in his eyes. "Yeah, sorry. It's just- It's been a while since I've seen it like… Well, this. Almost feels normal again."

I wanted to ask what he meant by that, but I could tell that he was going through something that I wouldn't have been able to understand.

"Do you know where a key out of this place might be?" Ethan asked after a moment.

Daniel walked back toward the garage door, where a set of hooks hung. On it was several keys. He hesitated for a second when he saw the rack, then ran his fingers over an empty hook. He then plucked them all from their places and tossed a set to Ethan and me.

"These were all the keys I had. If it's any of them, it's probably one of those." We thumbed through our sets, then exchanged a look of defeat. I could tell by their shapes that they weren't the ones for the hole.

"I don't think any of these are it," I told him. "The hole for the key was like a little rectangle."

Dan gave me a look of confusion, "What?"

"Yeah, it was like a square shape."

"That's it? Just a square hole."

"Yeah. It was a little metal disk with a rectangle hole right in the middle."

He placed his hand to his lips as he thought. After a moment, he straightened up and turned back to the garage door. "That's not a keyhole for a door. It's a car ignition. We need a car key."

Ethan read his body language and groaned. "Let me guess. You don't have it on you."

Dan shook his head. "There's only one car's keys I can think of, kid, and something tells me we aren't going to get them anytime soon.

*Thud!*

Not even a second after his sentence was finished, The Curator slammed its massive, lumpy form against the living-room window as we all jumped in surprise. It bowed from the tremendous amount of force, but like all things in the house, it didn't shatter.

"Yeah." Bea sighed, "Something tells me you're right."

Dan crossed the room and pulled the drapes shut. "C'mon. There are rooms upstairs. We can rest here for the night."

We headed up the steps to explore more of Daniel's home as the thing from downstairs scurried frantically from window to window to keep up with us. The house was just as lovely upstairs as it was downstairs, with more furniture and decorations filling its sprawling mass. Among the décor were several paintings, one of which contained a picture of Daniel with a gorgeous woman. Both of them were smiling brightly as they sat on the side of a boat on a lake. I had never seen Dan look so happy. As we reached a hallway, several doors lined the walls.

"Down there is the master bedroom, over there is a guest room, and that one there was my office."

We all three noticed two more doors, both closed. A third straight ahead and a fourth door adorned with stickers of bees and butterflies on it. We didn't dare ask what it was. We already knew.

"You three can decide how you want to spread out. I'll sleep downstairs on the couch. I don't want to be up here."

Bea and I looked at each other, not only because of his last remark but his first. Bea and I almost always slept next to one another, but it was never really acknowledged. Especially not by the others. I could feel Ethan staring at us both as he waited for a decision. Luckily, Bea spoke first.

"Um, what room do you guys want?"

"Uh, I'll take the office," I spoke. "Still prefer the floor, I think."

"Guest room for me. I don't want to be too comfortable." Ethan joked. "You take the master. Probably the best room."

"Alright." Bea smiled before throwing one last glance my way. I returned it before quickly darting my eyes to the floor.

Ethan saved us from the tension by speaking up suddenly, "There a bathroom up here? I kinda have to go." He stepped to the door ahead to open it, and Daniel suddenly let out a cry.

"No!"

We all looked at him.

"I mean… I'm sorry. That is one, but… Just use the one in the master bedroom or the one downstairs, okay? Please, don't go in there."

I could feel that we all sensed the strangeness of the reaction, but none of us wanted to step on toes. We just nodded and moved on.

"Thank you. Goodnight." Daniel said before turning and heading down the steps.

Ethan, Bea, and I all did a sweep of the upstairs to ensure it was safe (minus the two off-limit rooms), then said our goodnights as well. I stepped into the office and then closed the door behind me, slinging my pack off and retrieving a blanket. However, as I bent over, I noticed a picture frame on the desk nearby that was face down. I moved over to the table and inspected it. It was filled with very official-looking sheets cluttered with numbers and values. Whatever Dan had done for a living must have been very complex. I gingerly reached out for the frame and picked it up.

Behind the glass staring back at me, were two brown eyes that looked just like Daniel's. The nose was slightly different, and the chubby face made it hard to see the resemblance, but it was undisputable who the baby was. I instantly felt guilt for meddling and placed the picture face down right where I had found it, then lay on the carpet. It was dry and smelled normal, something that I wasn't used to.

I lay there for a long while, unable to sleep. Occasionally, I could hear the Curator scuttling around on the roof or across the walls, but that wasn't what was keeping me up. I brushed my fingers over the note in my pocket as old ghosts came to visit. Larry. Mark. Andi. Rose. He and Sarah. They swarmed around me and stung me with memories. With regrets. With guilt. I didn't make it an hour before I sat up and stepped out into the hall. Instinctively, I walked to the master bedroom but stopped myself as I passed the steps. I could hear a slight clattering sound from the kitchen. Silently, I crept down the stairs, using the dim orange light from the lamps outside to guide me. I reached the living room and peered into the kitchen to see Dan sitting at a bar counter with a glass and bottle before him.

"Go on," I heard Him mutter behind me. "Go talk to him. You know it could be one of the last times."

Go to hell.

"Hey," I announced softly as I stepped into the room. Daniel was startled, but he eased up as soon as he saw it was me.

"Hey, Joel. What are you doing up?"

"Couldn't sleep. Your turn."

Dan held up the bottle. A fine vessel of scotch. "Found my old liquor and didn't feel like sleeping."

"It any good?"

"Nah. Always hated the stuff. Great for impressing guests, though."

"Then why the excitement to drink it?"

Dan shrugged, "Needed to not feel anything for a bit."

Without asking, I grabbed a cup from the cupboard and took a seat next to him, and without speaking, he poured me a glass. I downed the golden ichor in one take, letting the burning sensation set fire to my chest. Dan filled me back up after knocking his back as well.

"What are you drinking to forget?"

"Too much, Dan. Drinking to forget way too much."

"You're too young for too much."

"I wish that were true."

"It is. You're only what? Twenty-three? Twenty-four? That's not enough time to make that many mistakes. When you guys get out of here, you've still got a whole life ahead. No need to call it so soon."

"When *we* get out of here." I corrected.

Dan chuckled, then downed another gulp. "Come on, Joel. Don't do that."

"Do what? I was just correcting you, is all."

"No. You're trying to convince me. There's no need for it."

I felt my jaw tighten as my throat began its familiar choke of grief. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"We both heard Larry, Joel."

"He was crazy."

"Oh, come on, kid. The signs are all there. He may have been insane, but he was always right when it came to this house."

"We don't know if he was right about this."

"I think you do know. Otherwise, you wouldn't be trying so hard to deny it. You remember the ballerina from upstairs. You saw that bloodstain from Andi; how it abruptly stopped. Hell, you and Bea even said that hallway changed the other day. The pieces are all there, Joel. Partner that with what Larry said…."

I felt my eyes begin to water. I shot my glass over to him without making eye contact, and he poured another drink without hesitation.

"There has to be a way out once you're in. Maybe this isn't even it--"

"Joel. Stop. It's fine."

"It's not fine. We aren't going to leave you, Daniel."

Daniel gave me a sympathetic look, "You're going to have to, kid. You heard Larry. He said when he tried to leave, it was in vain. And that dancer that helped us? She couldn't even step outside the door."

I shook my head in defeat as tears finally broke through my eyelids. I couldn't hold them back anymore. "If this is your room, then…”

"I can't leave, Joel. You kids are going to have to go without me."

The note in my pocket was burning a hole in my side. The voices in my head were overwhelming, and the liquor wasn't enough to drown them out. I didn't want to accept it. I couldn't accept it. I couldn't lose another person I loved. There was no way it was all real. There was no way that a house could be this big. That there could be so many stories and halls so deep into the earth. There was no physical way that a structure could shift and twist its rooms, and there was certainly no way that those rooms could keep a human trapped inside by some otherworldly force. I felt like a fly caught in the middle of a web. I had flown myself and everyone I loved into it, and now we were stuck, just waiting until the spider came to pick us off one by one. Ethan was right. We weren't all going to make it.

I stood up from the stool and started back toward the living room.

"Joel-"

I spun around and looked Daniel dead in the eye, "I am not going to let this place have you, Dan. We'll find a way out. For all of us."

Without another word, I stormed up the steps. I needed to stop the voices. I needed to not be conscious. I needed warmth. 

I needed Bea.

I wiped the tears from my eyes and then softly knocked on her door. My heart sank when there was no answer. I tried one more time to the same effect. I had decided to forget it and head back to my room when I saw her standing in the office doorway. She nervously fidgeted with her hands.

"I-I'm sorry. I just couldn't sleep, and I thought-"

Before she could finish her sentence, I had her wrapped tightly in my arms. She hesitated a moment from surprise before embracing me back.

"Is everything okay?"

I just nodded and kissed the top of her head. "I just *really* missed you."

I could feel the warmth of her breath and the beating of her heart as I held her close. The former was slow and deep, and the latter was rapid and anxious.

"I really missed you too..."  
   
  
  
A heavy cough from Mark woke me from my sleep. The poor guy's neck still hadn't healed from Larry's assault. I glanced toward the window on the wall across from me to see that the sky was a deep periwinkle color. Early morning. There was still a good few hours of rest to be had before everyone awoke for the day. A slight chill brushed over my skin, and I tugged lightly on the blankets, hoping to steal back what had been taken by Andi. I was surprised when it came my way so effortlessly. Feeling bad for now being the one who was the thief, I shifted to cover her more, but my embrace only found the mildew-stenched sheets beneath me. I lifted my head and saw that Andi wasn't next to me. Sighing, I lay back against my pillow and nestled myself into the sprawl of coverage I now had, waiting for her to return from the bathroom. She always had to go in the morning, and it always woke me up, but I didn't mind. It gave me an excuse to snuggle back up to her once she lay down again.

Listening to the room's ambiance, I felt a sense of relief. Gentle breathing from all of the bodies around me (albeit a more labored breathing from Mark) and a sense of peace. Something I hadn't felt in a long while. We had gotten so used to the stress from the thing downstairs that other worries began to rise to the surface. One of those things was Larry, and while I felt awful for admitting it, it was a massive weight off everyone's backs to have him gone. It was always like walking on eggshells when he had been around, and with his slow descent into madness, that only became worse and worse. Now that only the sane people remained, we all felt united again. Deep down, I was still feeling uneasy about Andi and the exit, but after the conversation we had had the week prior, I felt a lot better.

 Surprisingly, it seemed Andi did too. She was a lot more lively and less often in her head. Her faces of concern disappeared and were instead replaced by the smile we all knew her by. I had tried a couple of times to apologize for how I had acted on the porch, but anytime I did, she would just shush me with a smile and tell me, 'It's okay, Joel. You don't need to be sorry.' 

It really seemed like Andi was okay.

It really *seemed*.

After a few moments, I noticed that I couldn't hear any movement from anywhere in the house. Even in the bathroom, the floors creaked beneath the carpet. Yet other than the breathing of my friends, there was no sound at all. I couldn't even hear the creature below us moving around. I sat up as anxiety let itself in. Something was wrong. Just like the night Mark was attacked, something didn't feel right. I stood slowly, trying not to disturb the others, and crossed to the door.

The hallway was cold, and I hugged myself as I peered through the house.

"Andi?" I called out in a loud whisper. No reply.

Light spilled through the crack of the bathroom door, and as I stepped forward to open it, my heart sank to find it empty. I swallowed and turned toward the living room.

"Andi?"

The room was empty, and through the doorway beyond, I could see the bodies twirling outside the sunroom windows. They stopped upon seeing me and began to beckon, showing off their ever-present smiles. Hillary was among them. She opened her mouth and breathed fog onto the window, then traced a heart. At least, she would have if she had breath to fog it with. I always hated leaving the bedroom when it was this light out. I couldn't ever bear to see their faces. Their façade was happy, but behind their eyes was an unknown fear.

"Andi? Where are you?"

Against my better judgment, I stepped into the sunroom. My heart began to pound at this point. It was the only place that she could be. I couldn't imagine why she would want to be there while the bodies were still out, but I knew there was no reason she would be in the dining room, and the only other option was the kitchen. Deep down, I knew there was another outcome, however. When I saw the sunroom was empty, I gave up calling. Panic set in, and I instead began muttering to myself.

"Andi, please…"

Step by step, I rounded the corner into the dining room. I didn't see her in any of the corners. I didn't see her lying on the blanket we called our "table". I didn't see her at all. I nearly couldn't bring myself to continue forward. There was only one last place to check, and I didn't want to check it. I already knew the outcome. Regardless, I stepped around the corner and peered into the kitchen.

It took a few seconds for the sight to process, despite being prepared for it. Things were foggy and hazy like a dream. My legs shook and eventually gave out on me as I collapsed to the floor with blurry eyes. The pantry that blocked the yellow room door had been slid aside. Slid aside just enough to be opened. 

Opened just enough for Andi to fit through.
