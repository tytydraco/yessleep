The rain is cold. It soaks through my clothes and makes my skin feel like ice. I don't remember how long I've been standing here, on this street with the pretty houses all in a row. The streetlights make orange circles on the wet sidewalk.

I'm so cold.

There's a house in front of me. It has yellow light in the windows. I can see shapes moving inside—people. A family. They look warm. They look safe.

My feet move forward. I don't remember telling them to move, but they do. One step. Another step. Up the driveway. The rain pounds harder, drumming on my head, running into my eyes. Everything is blurry.

I reach the door. It's red. A pretty red door with a brass knocker shaped like a lion's head.

I knock.

The sound is loud in the storm. I wait. My heart beats fast—thump, thump, thump. I'm scared. Why am I scared? I need help. That's all. I'm just a child who needs help.

The door opens.

A woman stands there. She has brown hair pulled back and kind eyes. Behind her, I can see the warm glow of their home. I can smell something cooking—soup, maybe. My stomach hurts.

"Oh my God," the woman says. Her hand goes to her mouth. "Honey! Come here!"

A man appears. He's tall with glasses. He looks at me and his face changes. "Jesus. Kid, are you okay? Where are your parents?"

I open my mouth. Words should come out. But I don't know what to say. Where ARE my parents? I try to remember, but there's only fog in my head. Gray fog and cold.

"I'm lost," I whisper. My voice sounds strange. Small.

"Come inside," the woman says. She reaches for me. "You're soaking wet. Come in, come in."

I step over the threshold. The warmth hits me like a wave. It feels good. It feels wrong. I don't know why it feels wrong.

The woman wraps a blanket around me. It's soft and smells like flowers. She leads me to a couch in the living room. Everything here is so bright. So warm. There are pictures on the walls—the man and woman smiling, a little girl with pigtails, a dog.

"What's your name, sweetheart?" the woman asks. She kneels in front of me.

My name. I should know my name. Everyone knows their name.

"I... I don't remember," I say.

The man and woman look at each other. Something passes between them. Worry, maybe.

"That's okay," the man says. He has a gentle voice. "You've been through something scary. Do you remember where you live? Your phone number?"

I shake my head. The fog in my mind gets thicker when I try to remember. There are shapes in the fog. Dark shapes. But I can't see them clearly.

"We should call the police," the man says quietly to the woman.

"Not yet," she says. "Look at her. She's terrified. Let's get her warm first. Get her some food."

A little girl appears at the top of the stairs. She's maybe seven or eight. She has the same brown hair as the woman.

"Mommy? Who's that?"

"Just a friend who needs help, Emma," the woman says. "Go back to bed, honey."

But Emma comes down the stairs instead. She stares at me with big curious eyes. "Are you lost?"

I nod.

"That's scary," Emma says. "One time I got lost at the mall. But Mommy found me."

"Emma, bed," the man says. But he's smiling a little.

Emma goes back upstairs. I hear her footsteps above us.

The woman—I should call her something. Mrs. Chen. That's what the man called her. Mrs. Chen brings me soup. It's hot and tastes like chicken and salt. I eat it slowly. Each spoonful makes me feel more real, more here.

"You can stay tonight," Mrs. Chen says. "We'll figure everything out in the morning. Okay?"

I nod. Relief floods through me. I'm safe. I'm warm. Everything will be okay.

But deep down, in a place I don't want to look, something whispers that nothing will be okay. Nothing will ever be okay again.

I wake up in a strange bed. The room is pink with white furniture. Emma's room. She's sleeping in her parents' room tonight, Mrs. Chen said. So I could have privacy.

The house is quiet. It's still dark outside. I don't know what time it is.

I sit up. My clothes are dry now—Mrs. Chen put them in the dryer. They smell like soap. Clean. Normal.

But I don't feel normal.

There's something wrong with me. I can feel it like a stone in my stomach. Heavy and cold.

I get out of bed. My feet are silent on the carpet. I walk to the window and look out. The rain has stopped. The street is empty and dark. The streetlights buzz softly.

I should be happy. I'm safe. I'm inside. But I feel... hollow. Like I'm not really here. Like I'm watching myself from far away.

A light flickers in the hallway. Once. Twice. Then it stays on.

I didn't touch anything. Why did it flicker?

I walk to the door and peek out. The hallway is empty. There are three other doors—one must be Emma's parents' room, one must be a bathroom, one must be something else.

Everything is so still.

I take a step into the hallway. The air feels different out here. Colder. Is it colder? Or am I imagining it?

The light flickers again.

My heart beats faster. I'm scared, but I don't know why. There's nothing here. Nothing but a normal house with a normal family.

I go back to Emma's room and close the door. I climb back into bed and pull the covers up to my chin.

Sleep doesn't come for a long time.

Morning is bright. Too bright. The sun comes through the window and hurts. I squeeze my eyes shut and turn away from it.

"Good morning!" Mrs. Chen's voice. She knocks softly and opens the door. "How did you sleep?"

"Okay," I lie.

"I made pancakes. Are you hungry?"

I am. I'm always hungry now. Like there's a hole inside me that can't be filled.

Downstairs, the kitchen smells like butter and syrup. Emma is already at the table, swinging her legs. Mr. Chen—I heard Mrs. Chen call him David—is reading something on his phone.

"We're going to make some calls today," David says to me. "Try to find your family. I'm sure they're worried sick."

My family. Do I have a family? I try to remember. There's something there, in the fog. Faces. Voices. But they're not clear. They're like shadows.

"Okay," I say.

Emma stares at me while she eats. "Why don't you remember anything?" she asks.

"Emma," Mrs. Chen says. "That's not polite."

"But why?"

"Sometimes when people are scared or hurt, their brains protect them by forgetting," David says. "It's called trauma."

Trauma. The word feels heavy.

I eat my pancakes. They're good. Sweet. But I can barely taste them.

After breakfast, Mrs. Chen takes me to the bathroom. "You can take a shower if you want," she says. "I'll find some of Emma's old clothes for you to wear."

The bathroom is small and white. There's a mirror above the sink. I look at it, then look away quickly. Something about mirrors makes my stomach hurt. Makes my skin crawl.

I don't look at it again.

The shower is hot. The water pounds on my head and shoulders. Steam fills the room. I close my eyes and try to remember.

Where did I come from?

There's darkness. Cold. A feeling of moving, but not walking. Floating? No. Something else.

Doors. I remember doors. Lots of doors. Knocking. Waiting.

But why? Why was I knocking on doors?

The water starts to run cold. I get out and dry off. Mrs. Chen left clothes on the counter—jeans and a t-shirt with a cartoon cat on it. They fit okay.

I avoid the mirror as I leave.

David makes phone calls. I can hear him in the other room, talking to the police. Describing me. Asking if anyone reported a missing child.

No one has.

How is that possible? If I'm lost, someone must be looking for me. Parents. Family. Someone.

Unless...

Unless no one is looking.

The thought makes me feel sick.

Emma wants to play. She brings out dolls and sets them up on the living room floor. "This one is the princess," she says, holding up a doll with yellow hair. "And this one is the dragon. But it's a nice dragon."

I sit with her. I try to play. But my hands feel clumsy. Wrong. Like they don't belong to me.

"You're not very good at this," Emma says. She's not mean about it. Just honest.

"Sorry."

"It's okay. Maybe you don't like dolls. Do you like video games?"

"I don't know."

Emma tilts her head. "You don't know if you like video games?"

"I don't remember."

She thinks about this. "That must be weird. Not remembering stuff."

"It is."

We sit in silence for a moment. Then Emma says, "I'm glad you're here. It's like having a sister."

Something warm spreads in my chest. A sister. I could be like a sister. I could belong here.

But then the lamp next to the couch flickers. Once. Twice. The light bulb makes a soft popping sound.

Emma looks at it. "That's weird."

"Yeah," I whisper.

The room feels colder. I can see my breath. Just for a second. Then it's gone.

Emma shivers. "Did it get cold?"

"I don't know."

But I do know. It did get cold. And somehow, I know it's because of me.

I just don't know why.

Three days pass. The police have no record of a missing child matching my description. David and Mrs. Chen—Linda, I learned her name is Linda—talk in hushed voices when they think I can't hear.

"It doesn't make sense," David says. "Someone has to be looking for her."

"Maybe she ran away," Linda says. "Maybe her home wasn't safe."

"Then why can't she remember?"

"Trauma, like you said."

"This is more than trauma, Linda. This is... I don't know what this is."

I'm sitting at the top of the stairs, listening. I shouldn't be listening. But I need to know what they think of me.

"The things that have been happening," David says. His voice is lower now. Harder to hear. "The lights. The cold spots. That thing with the TV yesterday."

The TV. Yes. It turned on by itself. In the middle of the night. Static and white noise, so loud it woke everyone up. I was standing in front of it. I don't remember walking downstairs. I don't remember turning it on.

But I must have. Right?

"She's a child," Linda says. "A scared, lost child. Those are just coincidences."

"Are they?"

Silence.

Then Linda says, "What are you suggesting?"

"I'm not suggesting anything. I'm just saying... something feels off."

"David."

"I know how it sounds. But you feel it too. Don't you?"

More silence.

"We can't just throw her out," Linda finally says. "She has nowhere to go."

"I'm not saying we should. I'm just saying we need to be careful."

I go back to Emma's room. My room now, I guess. I sit on the bed and hug my knees to my chest.

They're scared of me.

I'm scared of me too.

Emma is my only friend here. She doesn't seem scared. She talks to me like I'm normal. Like I'm just another kid.

We're in the backyard. It's sunny, but I stay in the shade. The sun hurts my eyes. Makes my head pound.

"Do you want to play tag?" Emma asks.

"Okay."

She runs. I chase her. We laugh. For a moment, I feel normal. I feel real.

But then I catch her. My hand touches her arm. She stops running and looks at me.

"You're really cold," she says.

"Am I?"

She touches my hand. "Yeah. Like ice. Are you sick?"

"I don't think so."

"Maybe you should tell Mommy."

But I don't want to tell Linda. I don't want to give them another reason to be scared of me.

That night, I hear them arguing. David and Linda. Their voices carry through the walls.

"We need to call social services," David says.

"And tell them what? That we have a child with no memory and no family? They'll put her in the system."

"Maybe that's where she belongs."

"David!"

"I'm sorry, but this isn't normal. None of this is normal. The house feels different since she got here. Darker. Colder. And Emma—"

"What about Emma?"

"She's having nightmares. Every night since that girl arrived."

My chest hurts. Emma is having nightmares? Because of me?

"Children have nightmares," Linda says.

"Not like this. She wakes up screaming. She says there are shadows in her room. Shadows that move."

"That's just her imagination."

"Is it? Or is it something else?"

I press my hands over my ears. I don't want to hear anymore. But their voices seep through anyway.

"I think we made a mistake," David says. "I think we should have called the police that first night. I think we should have—"

"Should have what? Left her in the rain?"

"Maybe."

The word hangs in the air. Heavy. Final.

Maybe.

Maybe they should have left me in the rain.

Maybe I should have stayed in the cold and the dark.

Maybe I don't belong here.

The next morning, something is wrong with the dog.

They have a dog. His name is Buster. He's old and gray around the muzzle. He's always been nervous around me. Whining. Backing away. Hiding under furniture.

But this morning, he won't come out of his crate. He's shaking. His eyes are wide and white.

"What's wrong with him?" Emma asks.

Linda kneels by the crate. "I don't know, baby. He's just scared."

"Scared of what?"

Linda doesn't answer. But her eyes flick to me. Just for a second.

I feel something twist inside me. Something dark and cold.

The dog is scared of me.

Everyone is scared of me.

I go upstairs. I lock myself in Emma's room—my room. I sit on the floor with my back against the door.

What's wrong with me?

I close my eyes and try to remember. Really remember. Not just the fog and the shadows. But before. Before the rain. Before the doors.

There's something there. A memory. It's slippery, like trying to hold water. But I grab onto it.

Darkness. Complete darkness. Not like nighttime. Like nothing. Like the absence of everything.

And then... light. A door opening. A face. A woman's face. Different from Linda. This woman had blonde hair and blue eyes.

She was screaming.

Why was she screaming?

The memory slips away. I try to catch it, but it's gone.

I open my eyes. The room is darker than it should be. The sun is shining outside, but the light doesn't seem to reach in here. Shadows pool in the corners. They move. Just a little. Just enough to notice.

I'm doing this. Somehow, I'm making this happen.

But I don't know how to stop.

That night, Linda comes to my room. She sits on the edge of the bed. Her face is kind, but there's something else there too. Fear. Sadness.

"Sweetheart," she says. "We need to talk."

I nod. I know what's coming.

"David and I... we've been talking. And we think it might be best if... if we find you a better place to stay. Somewhere with people who are trained to help children like you."

Children like me. What does that mean? Lost children? Strange children? Wrong children?

"You want me to leave," I say.

"It's not that we want you to leave. It's just... things have been difficult. And we think you might be happier somewhere else."

"I won't be happier."

Linda's eyes get shiny. Like she might cry. "I'm sorry. I really am. But this isn't working. Surely you can feel that."

I can feel it. I can feel everything. The fear in this house. The wrongness. The way the air itself seems to reject me.

"When?" I ask.

"Tomorrow. Someone from social services is coming in the morning."

Tomorrow. One more night. Then I'll be gone.

Linda leaves. I hear her footsteps on the stairs. I hear her and David talking in low voices.

I lie in bed and stare at the ceiling. The shadows are darker tonight. They move across the walls like living things. Like they're dancing.

I'm not crying. I should be crying. But I can't. There's nothing inside me but cold.

Around midnight, I hear a sound. A soft thump from downstairs.

Then another.

Then a crash.

Voices. Shouting. Linda screaming.

I run downstairs. The living room is chaos. The furniture is overturned. Pictures have fallen off the walls. Glass is everywhere.

And in the middle of it all, David is on the floor. His head is bleeding. Linda is kneeling next to him, her hands shaking.

"What happened?" I whisper.

Linda looks up at me. Her face is white. "You," she says. "You happened."

"I didn't—I was upstairs—"

"The bookshelf," she says. "It just... fell. It fell on him."

I look at the bookshelf. It's on its side. Books are scattered everywhere.

"I didn't touch it," I say.

"I know you didn't touch it!" Linda's voice is high. Hysterical. "That's what makes it worse! You didn't touch it, but it fell anyway! Just like the TV turns on by itself! Just like the lights flicker! Just like everything in this house has gone wrong since you got here!"

Emma appears at the top of the stairs. She's crying. "Daddy?"

"Go back to bed, Emma!" Linda shouts.

But Emma doesn't move. She just stares at me. And for the first time, I see fear in her eyes too.

I did this. I don't know how, but I did this.

I'm dangerous.

David is okay. The cut on his head isn't deep. But everything has changed.

Linda won't look at me. Emma won't come near me. David watches me like I'm a bomb that might explode.

I sit in the kitchen while they clean up the living room. I can hear them talking.

"We can't wait until morning," David says. "We need to call someone now."

"It's the middle of the night."

"I don't care. That thing—"

"She's not a thing. She's a child."

"Is she?"

Silence.

"What are you saying?" Linda asks.

"I'm saying I don't know what she is. But I don't think she's a normal child. I don't think she's even—"

He stops. But I know what he was going to say.

Human.

He doesn't think I'm human.

Is he right?

I close my eyes and dive into the fog in my mind. I push past the fear and the confusion. I reach for the memories that hide in the darkness.

And this time, they come.

Doors. So many doors. Knocking. Waiting. Faces appearing. Some kind. Some scared. Some angry.

"Please," I hear myself saying. "Can I come in? I'm lost. I'm cold."

And they let me in. They always let me in.

But then... then things happen. Bad things. Lights flicker. Shadows move. People get hurt.

And I move on. To the next door. The next family.

How many families? How many doors?

I can't count them. There are too many.

And before the doors... before all of this...

There's nothing. Just darkness. Just cold. Just a voice saying, "Go. Find them. Make them let you in."

Whose voice?

I don't know.

I open my eyes. The kitchen is darker. The shadows are thicker. They're reaching for me. Coming from me.

I'm not a lost child.

I'm something else.

Something wrong.

I stand up. My legs feel strange. Weak. I walk to the hallway. There's a mirror there. A big one on the wall.

I've been avoiding mirrors. I didn't know why. But now I do.

I'm afraid of what I'll see.

But I need to know. I need to see the truth.

I walk to the mirror. I look up.

At first, I see what I expect. A child. Small. Thin. Pale.

But then I really look. I look at my eyes.

They're black.

Not brown. Not blue. Not any normal color.

Black. Completely black. Like holes. Like nothing.

And just like that, the fog lifts.

Oh.

Oh, that was good. That was really good. I almost believed it myself.

The confusion. The fear. The innocent "I don't remember."

All of it. An act. A perfect act.

I remember everything. I always remembered everything.

I knew what I was the moment I knocked on that red door. I knew what would happen. I've done this so many times before.

The Johnsons. The Parkers. The Reyes family. The Chens. That couple in the farmhouse. The old woman who lived alone.

So many doors. So many families.

And this one—the Harpers—they were easy. So easy.

Linda with her soft heart. David with his need to fix things. Emma with her desperate wish for a sister.

I played them perfectly.

The trembling voice. The wide eyes. The confusion about my own name. The fear of mirrors.

They ate it up. Every single bit.

I smile at my reflection. At those black, black eyes.

Behind me, I hear a gasp. I turn slowly.

Linda is standing there. She's staring at me. At my eyes.

"Oh God," she whispers. "Oh God, what are you?"

I don't pretend anymore. I don't make my voice small and scared.

"You already know," I say. My voice sounds different now. Clear. Steady. "You knew something was wrong from the beginning. But you let me in anyway."

David appears behind Linda. He sees me. Sees my eyes. His face goes white.

"Get away from her," he says to Linda. "Get Emma. We're leaving. Now."

I tilt my head. "Leaving? This is your house."

"What do you want?" Linda's voice shakes.

What do I want? That's a good question.

I wanted in. I got in.

I wanted warmth. I took it.

I wanted to see how long I could make it last. How long I could play the lost little girl.

Three weeks. Not bad. The Parkers only lasted five days before they figured it out.

"I don't want anything anymore," I say. "You're used up now. All of you."

Emma appears at the top of the stairs. She looks down at me. At my eyes.

She screams.

The sound makes me smile. Not because it hurts. Because it means I did my job well.

She really thought I wanted to be her sister. She really believed it.

"Goodbye, Emma," I say. "Thanks for the clothes. And the toys. And for believing every lie I told you."

I walk to the door. The red door. The door that let me in.

I open it.

Outside, it's raining again. Cold and dark. Perfect.

I step out into it.

Behind me, I hear Linda crying. I hear David on the phone, calling someone. Police. Priest. Someone who might understand.

But no one will understand.

And it doesn't matter. By the time anyone comes, I'll be gone.

I walk down the driveway. Down the street. The rain soaks through my clothes.

I don't mind. The cold doesn't bother me. It never has.

That was a lie too.

I walk for a long time. Hours maybe. Days maybe. Time feels different when you're hunting.

The rain stops. The sun comes up. I find shade and wait.

Night comes again.

I'm in a different neighborhood now. Different houses. Different families.

New prey.

There's a house in front of me. It has blue shutters and a white door. There are lights on inside. I can see shapes moving. People. A family.

They look warm. They look safe.

They look perfect.

My feet move forward. One step. Another step. Up the driveway.

I reach the door.

Before I knock, I check my reflection in the window. I make my eyes look normal. Brown. Soft. Human.

I make my face look scared. Lost. Helpless.

I mess up my hair a little more. I let my lip tremble.

Perfect.

I knock.

The sound is loud in the quiet night. I wait. My heart beats—thump, thump, thump.

The door opens.

A man stands there. He has red hair and kind eyes. Behind him, I can see the warm glow of their home. I can smell something baking—cookies, maybe.

"Hello?" he says. Then he sees me. His face changes. "Oh. Oh, are you okay? Are you lost?"

I look up at him. I make my voice small. Frightened. Broken.

"I'm lost," I whisper. "I'm so cold. Can I come in?"

He hesitates. Just for a second. Something in him knows. Some deep instinct that says danger, says wrong, says don't.

But then he pushes it down. Because I'm small. Because I'm a child. Because humans are kind.

Because humans are stupid.

"Of course," he says. "Come in. Let's get you warm."

I step over the threshold.

The warmth hits me like a wave.

It feels good.

It feels right.

This is what I am. This is what I do.

I knock on doors.

I wait to be invited in.

And when they let me in—when they always, always let me in—the darkness comes with me.

I'm good at this. So good.

And I'm not going to stop.

Why would I stop?

Behind me, the door closes.

And somewhere in the house, a light flickers.

Once.

Twice.

Then goes out.

I smile in the darkness.

Let the game begin again.
