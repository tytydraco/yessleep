Last February, my younger brother, Mark and I moved into a new flat in one of the city’s residential zones. The apartment featured three fully air-conditioned bedrooms, a single bathroom, and a wide rectangular window that overlooked the city port nearby.

Our move was rushed. I had just begun a managerial job at a local food factory the month previous, and my brother was starting his clerkship at one of the city’s largest hospitals. 

Our aunt, whose best friend is a real estate agent, secured the place for us the week before. We liked the place because the commuter vehicles, especially the buses and jeeps toward our respective workplace, passed by there, and despite being in the university belt area, it was surprisingly peaceful. 

We had round-the-clock security, few housekeeping personnel and a 24-hour reception desk; but what I cherished most was the kitchen. Unlike most flats in town, this one allowed us to cook. So, we can save money compared to eating out.

Mark and I occupied each of the bedrooms near the door, and we converted the extra room as storage/guest room. We had bare minimum furniture and a small aesthetic touch in the room - a frame of Mona Lisa picture hung below the wall clock and a *Pachycereus* cactus plant we named “Ben”.

Even on night one, subtle clues hinted at something horror stirring in the room. 

So, after an entire exhaustive day of moving and arranging things, I dined out for dinner. My brother on the other hand, skipped dinner and went straight to sleep because he was too tired, and they had a seminar the next day. 

When I entered the room, I heard a woman’s voice giggling. I thought it was from the  storage room. At that time, I got angry - yup, that was my initial reaction. 

I will digress a little to explain the context. My brother has a girlfriend who, my parents and I know, is too clingy to my brother. They met in a popular dating back when he was still in medicine school. From casual chatters, they hit off and basically started dating seriously. I know that because he announced it at our Christmas dinner. We didn’t believe it at first that he is already serious because we know his long list of casual dates, and even managed to have 6 girlfriends at the same time. What the-.

Most of us men are dying in thirst, whereas my brother is part of the few who are drowning in success. What the f-.

Anyways, imagine my surprise that one night after my shift, I found her flirting with him on the couch in our previous place. She moved to our city and even convinced her parents to let her study. Apparently, he is too handsome for her to the point she did everything to be him. What the fu-!

So, going back, I got angry because I thought she and him grew tails and courage to do whatever wildness they can think of in our new place, to be specific in the storage room. To emphasize, it was just our first day in that place. My thoughts at that time was despite they had that “cool-off” agreement (he announced it during one dinner when mother asked him about her in his last visit to her) - I thought, they were just like any other couples who broke up temporarily and got back together more committed and intense love i.e. more hornier. 

I strode as fast I could and swung the door open. No one was there. 

Then, I went to his room and opened the door. There I saw a naked woman, pale skin, long straight hair that covered her chest and such a beautiful smiling face, standing beside the bed, staring at my brother who was laying supine.

I immediately closed the door. I genuinely thought that my brother had a visitor and was about to do something. Yet a realization flashed in my mind: his girlfriend had light brown skin and curly hair. 

So, I opened the door again, and the lady was gone. I blinked many times and rubbed my eyes thinking maybe I was imagining things. Also, I checked my brother, he was sound asleep and checked the corners and under his bed just to be sure before going to bed. 

The next day our parents visited us and stayed the night. I was able to stay with them the whole day because my new boss permitted me to have a day off. 

The day after that, my mother remarked that our neighbor, i.e. the resident of the, was a good singer. “She has the most beautiful voice that I slept well last night.” My father remarked. 

By noon, they went back home. I assisted them to the taxi, while As I was walking on the hallway back to my room, I noticed a housekeeping personnel was cleaning the room. Because the door was wide open, I saw the inside. 

It was empty. So I asked if the occupant moved out that morning. 

“No sir. Someone will move in.” She replied. “This room has been empty for a month until today.”

I stood there, frozen and shook my head. Of course, I am not dumb, I knew something was wrong, and I am scared. I saw too many dumb characters who ignored the danger signs at the beginning tend to die well “dumbly”. So that night, after just three days staying there, I talked with my younger brother about moving out. Mark is a scaredy cat so I only needed a little convincing him, especially when I told him about the naked woman in his room and the phantom singing.

So, for the following 4 days I looked around for a new place. And in those days, we never entered or stayed in the flat alone, he slept in my room and we ate outside. Heck, one of us should guard the comfort room door when the other was doing his business. 

That Sunday, while we were working on the small living room in our flat, I received a chat from my friend that his place was vacant and we could move in two days. I basically jumped in joy and told Mark about it.

It was that following day, that Monday morning, is the memory that  I wished to forget but could not. 

So Mark and I were waiting for the elevator, when I noticed that I forgot my ID card. I rushed back to the grab. I remembered thinking that it was strange because it always has been the first thing I put on my pocket. 

I saw it lying on the table, the most unusual place to say because I don’t just place it anywhere in the flat - just in my bag pack or pocket. I mean, it was important after all because without it, I am not allowed to enter my workplace.

I was about to exit the flat when the door suddenly slammed closed in front me. My left big toe was hit by the thick wooden door. I shouted in pain and mouthed a few curses. 

After recovering slightly, I swung open the door. In an instant, my anger vanished. There in  the middle of the hallway was a woman—her long, straight black hair cascading down her back, her bloodied white pajamas clinging loosely to her form. She—or whatever that thing was—floated silently, facing away from me

I was caught off guard, too afraid that I couldn’t move. 

Then, her head snapped back unnaturally that her face faced me. I saw the almost perfect egg shaped face, pointed chin, perfect straight nose, pale white with visible blue veins, abyssal mouth opened, perfectly lined darkened teeth, and a pair of eye sockets. Yup she had no eyes, and I almost crap my black slacks. 

I slammed shut the door before my knees gave out and I dropped. 

That feeling, when my mind stopped working, and the fear just held me in place. I wanted to run, damn, I wanted to escape. But, I also realized I messed up - I imprisoned myself in that haunted room. 

Then I remembered the most important thing - my brother. He was waiting by the elevator, just six rooms down from ours, straight ahead.. Basically, he was near that monstrosity. 

Without hesitations, I darted to the door and swung it open. Fully expected that she was still there, but the hallway was empty. I ran to the elevator, he wasn’t there anymore. Thinking that he already went ahead, I kind of turned back to check that maybe she was behind me, like in the horror movies, and to grab my phone and call him. 

That’s when I saw her dragging my brother’s unconscious body to our room. Our eyes - I mean her empty eye sockets and my eyes met - and she paused. 

I sprinted forward, and she pulled him inside. I was lucky that I managed to grab the door before it shut. 

When I entered, the room was silent- hauntingly silent. No disturbed furniture and stuff. I stood just a few steps away from the door, looked around, but my brother was missing. Then, a thought came to my mind. Just like in horror movies, if you couldn’t see anything in the front and back, then the next to look at is - above. 

Yes there they were. The monster was hugging Mark's limp body tightly, while her other hands that I surmised coming out of her between legs were buried on the white concrete ceiling. 

She screamed at me - her scream was a cacophony of high pitched and guttural voices. But I, fueled by full pumped adrenaline and sheer desire to save my younger brother, screamed at her then jumped. I am 6 foot flat single, heartbroken, gym bro so I managed to grab Mark’s collar. 



Yet, her full swing fist managed to connect with my left jaw, and I landed on our trash bin. I got up immediately and grabbed a shoe and hurled it to her face. She wasn’t hurt but got pissed off and screamed at me. 

I took advantage of her distracted to me, and jumped again. This time, I managed to grab Mark’s two legs and pulled as strong as I could.

She lost hold of him and we dropped on the floor. Without wasting any time, I threw Mark into a fireman’s carry and sprinted to the elevator. I punched the buttons and turned around. 

Her head poked out the door, sneering at me. Then came her upper torso, twisting with loud crunching and cracking noises. A hand slapped the floor, then another—and two more followed. As she dramatically revealed her body, her height began to rise, stretching until her head touched the ceiling

I didn’t want to see her full display - she was too scary already. Fear took over me. I screamed and screamed, and basically banging on the elevator’s door. 

Her mouth gaped open and wailed. 

“HE IS MINE! HE IS MINE!”. Her guttural voice drowned the hallway, I thought my eardrums broke

Fortunately, the door slid open and I jumped inside. I didn’t dare to look ahead, I pushed repeatedly the close button. 

I didn’t dare return to that room again. Instead, I stayed curled on the sofa by the recipient’s desk, Mark asleep with his head resting on my lap. Of course the good staff asked if I was okay or anything was wrong but I just smiled and lied. I didn’t want to say anything to her for some reason. 

My aunt answered after 10 missed calls and picked us up and drove us to the nearest hospital. Mark was fine, just conscious but no major injuries, just a few scratches. I didn’t tell the ER nurse and the doctor, just lied that he just collapsed out of nowhere. 

Mark woke up 3 hours later. His memories were foggy and couldn’t remember what happened. He just said that he remembered standing by the elevator, scrolling his phone while he waited for me. That was all. He doesn't remember what happened next even to this day. 

My auntie, upon hearing what happened, was strangely calm. She told me not to tell anybody. My parents came back the next day and the three talked in a locked room. It was strange because they never did that before. 

We moved  to one of my aunt’s  flats, away from the area. Our parents stayed for a week with us before going back home. 

It was strange yet I didn’t ponder much about it due to being entangled with work. I am happy that Mark is doing well and he and his girlfriend made up. Last week she visited us. 

Basically that should be the end right? Well, another reason that I write this here and on other platforms is because yesterday, my aunt visited us uncharacteristically in the middle of the night. They talked in a closed room. Of course, I eavesdropped. 

She mentioned the name of a lady, whom Mark remembered as one of his one night stand encounters. She revealed that last January she committed self-deletion. She suspected that it had something with him, like the cause of her act was him. 

Then, two days ago, after managing to talk with the lady’s grandmother, who was her acting guardian, they dug up the grave. 

It was empty.
