I was a fairly lonely child, I wouldn't go as far as to say my parents neglected or didn't love me, but their exhausting work schedules limited the time they could spend with me, even when they had a slightly less busy day, we would only have time for a quick chat and a family meal.
 
Of course, there were some upsides, every day, they would leave me some cash on the kitchen table so I can buy whatever I want when I get back from school. 
 
Honestly, they've always left far too much money for me and didn't care if I spend it all, so I'd buy random things to pass the time, I couldn't even count how many times I just bought a huge mozzarella pizza out of sheer boredom, then just eat a slice and leave it be.
 
On paper, a rich kid which has the home for himself sounds great, but in reality, the feeling of loneliness was overwhelming, even though I desperately needed a friend or ar least someone to talk to, that was nearly impossible for me to achieve at the time, because of my lack of social interactions, I became almost incapable of forming any connections with other people.

The only meaningful connection I had, aside from my parents, was with my neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, they would occasionally invite me over for some lemonade or would bring me over some cake, although they usually didn't have time for anything more than that, after all, they had two very young daughters they had to take care of, so they obviously didn't have much time to waste.
 
Even though I was already 12 years old, I never had a friend, but that changed when I found my best and only friend poking out from the grass in my backyard.
 
It was just a boring summer day, I left the house just for a moment to throw out the trash, only moments before coming back inside I heard a unintelligible whisper.
 
I turned around, trying to focus on my surroundings, then I heard a another whisper, this time however I clearly understood it, the soft voice said "Sorry for disturbing you, can we talk?"
 
I scratched my head in confusion, again, I scanned my surroundings, but I saw no one.
 
"I see you're confused, to be fair, hearing a random voice and not seeing where it's coming from isn't too common, so let me give you a hint, look at the grass behind you, I'm right next to the tree right now, I'll try and wave at you!" the whispering continued.
 
I immediately looked at the area near the tree in our backyard, the only thing I saw was a lone yellow flower, but as my eyes focused on the flower, I realized that it was wobbling left and right, that was highly unusual considering there was no strong wind.

I walked closer to the flower and then I heard the voice again, this time it was noticeably louder than before.
 
"Hello, friend! Let me make a quick introduction, you aren't crazy, a flower is indeed talking to you, I don't have a mouth, so I have to communicate telepathically with you, obviously, that means I'm not an ordinary plant, but I probably look like the average dandelion to you, so feel free to call me Dandy!" the flower explained, its voice was oddly calming.

"H-hi, I'm Robert." I stuttered.
 
"This is probably too much for you to handle all at once, it's all right though, it's not like you meet a talking flower every day, right?" Dandy said while wobbling slowly.
 
"Right" I quickly answered.

"I will be honest, the reason why I'm talking to you today is because I have to ask you for a favor, you don't have to help me, but listen to what I have to say at least!" the flower said and immediately stopped wobbling, I imagined it was its way of showing how serious it is.
 
"Sure, tell me." I said while crouching right next to the flower.
 
"Well you see, I am an exceedingly rare flower, so rare, that I doubt there's more of my kind out there, I have some very useful abilities, yet it's difficult for me to care for myself on my own, if I don't get the required food and water in the next couple of months, I will wither away and eventually die, however if I do get everything that's required, I will evolve and I will finally become strong enough to exit this restricting soil." Dandy explained.
 
"So what do I have to do?" I asked immediately, intrigued by his story.
 
"Could you get me a glass of water?" Dandy asked.
 
I was surprised by how simple the request was so I immediately got up and went back inside to grab a large glass of cold water, I brought it to Dandy.
 
"You could just pour it into the soil, but let me show you a cool trick instead, just leave the glass of water right next to me." Dandy commanded.
 
I did as he said.
 
In only seconds a dark green vine sprouted from the ground, it was just barely long enough to get to the bottom of the glass, in seconds it burrowed into the glass and sucked the water out of it, as soon as the glass was empty, the vine retreated into the ground below Dandy.
 
"Oh that hit the spot, thank you!" Dandy wobbled, seemingly satisfied.
 
"You're welcome, I guess." I said while rubbing the back of my head.
 
"As a token of gratitude, I will tell you how some of my abilities work, you see, I can see visions of the future, they're not always easy to decipher, but usually I can understand what they mean, the one I had recently is about you, so please take my warning seriously, when washing the dishes later tonight, please wear your father's leather gloves." as soon as he finished talking, Dandy stopped wobbling.
 
"Sure, thank you." I replied, not fully believing what he said.
 
"I see you're not fully convinced yet, so look at this!" Dandy said cheerfully.
 
Seconds after he finished talking he was gone, it looked like he disappeared when I blinked.
 
Before I could even say anything, I heard his voice once again "As you can see, I can turn invisible too, so why not believe my visions of the future, surely a plant that can turn invisible wouldn't lie to you about seeing the future, right?"

"Um, yeah, right." I hesitated with my response.
 
Dandy reappeared and continued talking "It doesn't matter if you believe me or not, wearing a pair of leather gloves later tonight won't do you any harm anyway." Dandy remarked.
 
"I won't take much more of your time today, so go back inside and grab something to eat, although if you need someone to talk to, I'll be here, not like I can go anywhere!" Dandy said and giggled.
 
"Okay" I quickly replied, still dazed by how unusual this situation was.
 
"Oh, I almost forgot, please don't tell anyone else about me, I trust you, but other people might not be kind to me." Dandy said, for the first time I could feel nervousness in his voice.
 
I waved goodbye, Dandy wobbled once again, although this time he wobbled forward like a gentleman tipping his hat, after that I went back inside.
 
Hours passed, after I was done eating the sandwiches my mom left me, I got ready to do the dishes, but then I remembered Dandy's warning, I was very sceptical about it, but I still wondered what would happen if he was right and I didn't bother to heed his warning, so I quickly took my dad's leather gloves out of the drawer and wore them, even though they weren't the perfect fit, I still wanted to do as Dandy suggested just in case.
 
I started washing the dishes, only minutes passed and a large glass mug shattered in my hands, shards of glass fell in the sink, but I was uninjured thanks to the gloves which were now slightly ripped.
 
My scepticism immediately disappeared, there was absolutely no way this could've been a coincidence.
 
I finished the dishes and since it was already late at night, I went to bed.

When I woke up I talked to my parents before they went to work, I didn't even mention Dandy, mainly because I didn't want to betray him, but also because I didn't want my parents to think I was slowly going insane in solitude.

Talking to Dandy every day and occasionally doing some favors for him became a common occurrence, we would talk about many different topics, I would tell him about the movies and tv shows that I liked to watch or the video games I loved wasting hours of my life on, he was a great listener and seemed to be genuinely intrigued by my hobbies, he even told me that he'd enjoy watching Star Wars with me once he fully evolves.
Every week he'd ask for a small favor, which I would gladly fulfill.
 
Some favors were as simple as bringing him a glass of water, others were buying a bag of fertilizer for him and then pouring it all next to him, he thanked me every time.
 
As strange as it sounds, talking with a flower became a normal part of my daily schedule, he became my only and best friend, spending time with him slowly made the feeling of loneliness disappear.
 
As our mutual trust grew, so did Dandy, every week he grew a bit larger, at first he was looked like a tiny dandelion, but now he resembled a large yellow rose.
 
A couple of months passed, my parents went to work as usual, as soon as they were gone I rushed to meet up with Dandy just like I usually would.
 
I ran towards the friendly flower, yet what I found made me stop in my tracks, instead of the vibrant yellow rose, I saw a bent and withering dark green flower, its petals were so dry that I wouldn't be surprised if it turned to be dead if it didn't talk to me as soon as I approached it.
 
"Hello, friend." Dandy said, his usually cheerful and energetic voice was now replaced with a raspy mutter.
 
I was too shocked to even think of what to say.
 
"Unfortunately, I have some very bad news, I saw a grim future in my visions, I appreciate your kindness and how willing you were to help me evolve, but in the end, the horror I gazed upon in these visions made me sick, so sick that you're efforts might've been in vain, I doubt that I will recover, but I promise you that nothing unfortunate will happen to you if you heed my warning once again." Dandy said, somberness was present in his voice.
 
"What visions, what are you talking about?" I asked, confused and scared.
 
"Please, listen to me carefully, tonight a mysterious abductor will kidnap children in your neighborhood, he will do unmentionable acts to the poor children, yet my vision is faulty and incomplete, so I have no way of knowing who that person actually is and which children he will abduct, yet I know one fact, your house appeared multiple times in my visions, so you might be his target." Dandy ended his explanation, almost choking on his words.
 
I sat on the grass and stared at the ground in shock as multiple horrible thoughts put pressure on my mind.
 
"Rest assured, I will do whatever I can to protect you, but you have to follow my instructions closely, do you trust me?" Dandy asked.
 
"Of course." I swiftly answered.
 
"Good, I'm glad." Dandy replied with noticable relief in his shaky voice.
 
"Please, just pull off one of my petals and consume it, that's everything you have to do, I promise you will avoid a grisly fate if you do as I requested." Dandy pleaded.
 
I had no reason to distrust him, this wouldn't be the only time his warnings put me out of harms way, so I agreed to do it.
 
Before taking one of his petals, I asked "This won't hurt you, right?"

Dandy instantly replied "Not at all, to me this would be the same as a human losing a hair or two."
 
Satisfied with the explanation, I quickly plucked out a petal and swallowed it.
 
"Congratulations, you may share some of my abilities now." Dandy told me with a hint of happiness in his frail voice.
 
"Really?" I asked, even more confused than before.
 
"Well, when you go to sleep tonight, I will make you completely invisible, even if you're indeed the mysterious abductor's target, he won't be able to notice you." Dandy explained.
 
"Thank you." I replied, instantly feeling relief.
 
Once the fear for my life subsided, I remembered how frail Dandy looked.
 
"What about you, will you be alright?" I asked, genuinely concerned.
 
"Let's just worry about you for now, tomorrow you can get me some high phosphorus fertilizer, that should hopefully help me recover." Dandy reassured me.
 
I nodded and thanked him.
 
"You should really go to your house now, get something to eat and spend some time doing whatever you enjoy, then go to bed and leave everything else to me." Dandy offered his advice one more time.
 
"Don't worry, I'll do exactly as you recommended!" I replied, placing my full trust in my friend.
 
I waved goodbye, even though sick and tired, Dandy had enough strength left to slowly wobble, it looked like he was wishing me good luck.
 
I went back to my house and tried occupying my mind by watching some anime, as the night was approaching, I became more and more nervous, a feeling of intense exhaustion hit me even though it wasn't even 10pm yet, I felt sleepier than ever before, so I shuffled to my bed, using all my energy to not fall unconscious, as soon as I was an inch away from my bed, I fell on top of it and was sound asleep in only seconds.
 
That night, I had a dream, I was sitting in my living room and watching Star Wars, I heard Dandy's voice, it was full of energy, with obvious glee in his voice, he said "Thank you!"
 
I turned to my left and saw Dandy sitting right next to me, I froze in my seat as I gazed upon his new appearance, he now had a body that looked like a human sculpture that was made out of hundreds or even thousands of vines, he had large arms and legs which were covered in leaves and moss, his large head looked like a venus fly trap, except he also had eyes, his eyes were disturbingly human, each eye had a different color and they looked like tiny black and brown dots in his enormous yellow head, as he looked at me, I could've sworn that he smiled at me with a big toothy grin.
 
I woke up in cold sweat, I was extremely groggy, it was the kind of feeling I had only if I oversleep, I immediately noticed the window in my room was open, I thought that was impossible, because the mix of nervousness and paranoia yesterday made me lock every window and door in my house before I went to sleep, nonetheless, nothing seemed to be wrong with me, except my socks which were unusually dirty and wet, I had no injuries though, so I knew Dandy's plan worked.
 

I looked at the clock and realized it was already 2pm, I exited my room and was surprised to see my parents sitting in the living room, they were supposed to be at work at that time.

I was happy to see them, yet they looked distraught, the way they greeted me was extremely depressing, it was like something else was on their mind.
 
I immediately asked what's wrong and they told me that our neighbors daughters, which were only 1 and 3 years old, were missing.
 
My blood ran cold as I realized another one of Dandy's visions came true.
 
My parents continued, explaining that the police are conducting an investigation, considering how young the children are, what happened was surely an abduction.

I wondered if I would've had the same fate if I didn't follow Dandy's advice, I wanted to show him my gratitude by buying him the most expensive fertilizer I could.

I asked my parents if I could go outside for a short walk to clear my head, they agreed so I hastily left my house.

I gazed upon the area where Dandy was, yet this time I saw nothing except for the grass and the tree next to it.
 
I ran up to the spot fearing that my friend withered away while I was asleep.
 
I fell to my knees, desperately searching for Dandy, there was no sign of him.
 
I tried digging through the soil with my bare hands, frantically searching for him.
I didn't find him, but underneath the dirt, I felt something firm.
 
I continued digging through the dirt, I grabbed some kind of orb shaped object with both of my hands and pulled it out, as soon as it plopped out of the ground, I dropped it and almost started vomiting.
 
It was a small human skull, worst of all I felt more objects in the soil while digging, so I immediately knew there was more bones buried in the same spot.
 
As I was screaming for my parents and running back inside, the pieces of the puzzle started connecting in my head, I now understood that my so called best friend finally evolved just like he always wanted to.
