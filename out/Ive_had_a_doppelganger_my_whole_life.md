A bit of personal backstory. I'm Riley. I'm a caucasian woman in my early 30s, and I live alone in a small town in northeastern New Hampshire, near the White Mountains. It's a beautiful area to live in, especially during the late summer. You get the benefits of fall temperature and full sun at the same time, all before it becomes too cold to go out without a hoodie.

I grew up in Massachusetts and moved up north in my 20s for a bit of solitude. My mother was getting a bit intense for me, and my dad was always working. So, I packed up my things and traveled upwards. But there's… another reason I moved up here. I've had this problem my whole life. There's another me.

I don't mean like a twin, or a delusion, or a spirit or monster taking my shape. Just straight up another me. The first time I saw her (or it, or whatever), I couldn't have been older than seven. I remember playing on the playground after school hours. I kicked a ball over to this line of spiky bushes.

Now, being a kid, I was scared of these bushes because they hurt a lot despite not being outright dangerous. Hey, nobody likes pain, right? So I went to grab my kickball, but something was off. I saw a second identical one right next to mine. Keep in mind it was nearly getting dark, and it was just my mother and I out here, and we were getting packed up to leave. I didn't see any other kids, or parents, or bright red kickballs.

Whatever. I shrugged it off, thinking maybe some kid left theirs here. After I worked through the irrational fear I had of the thornbush, I bent down to grab my own ball, looked up, and saw myself looking right back at me. This other Riley looked just as surprised to see me as I was her. We both made eye contact and jumped back at the same time, each one of us silent and curious, but too scared to speak.

The terror I felt was unreal. There's no way this was just another neighborhood kid. We had the same eyes, same hair, same blue overalls, same white polka dot shirt, same light-up Skechers. We even shared the same mole under our left eye.

My mom called my name, reminding me again that it was dark and that we had to go.

"Coming!"

We both shouted it at the same time, then looked at each other in confusion again. You know that deep panicked feeling, where the only thing you can do in order to not lash out or scream is to hyperventilate and pace in place? I had my first taste of that in that moment. Before I could think on it, I shoved the doppelganger into the thornbushes and sprinted to my mom in terror, sobbing in fear.

"Oh honey, we can come back over the weekend." she assured me. I couldn't get the words out to tell her why I was really crying. I was seven, for God's sake, what was I supposed to say? I just clung to her for dear life as she buckled me up and drove off. As we were leaving, I looked out the window. I saw myself getting out of the bushes with bloody knees and angry tears in my eyes, watching as the real me drove off with "our" mother.

I'll admit, most of those details were fuzzy, but I'll never forget standing up and seeing my own face. I still can't look at myself in the mirror without seeing that other me out by the thornbush in the darkening playground, staring daggers at me. Those two moments are clear as day in my memory even if nothing else is.

The next time I saw her was my tenth birthday. I had a massive Disney themed party as all little girls in the late 90s did. I had to be Cinderella, of course. I remember stepping away to use the bathroom while my mom brought out the cake, promising to wait for me to cut it. From where I was in the bathroom, I could hear people right outside as the porch spanned the entire side of the house beyond those walls.

It was faint, but I was able to hear birthday singing. Confused, I finished my business and rushed out as quickly as possible. I froze at the sliding glass door. There, standing at *my* cake, with *my* friends and *my* family, in *my* fucking Cinderella costume, was the fucking doppelganger. As if sensing me, we locked eyes. She stopped laughing into a bite of cake and dropped it into the dirt. My mom tenderly wiped her face clean and got her another slice, but she was barely aware of it. I forget exactly what happened next. All I remember was being so filled with rage seeing this fake version of me being pampered by my own mother.

But she didn't seem malicious. She seemed… scared. She had the same look on her face that I must have when I saw her the first time. And I had the same angry tear-faced glare she had back then. It was like we swapped places. I remember storming out and tackling the other me to the ground, screaming for her to get away from my mom. The entire party became a panic, it taking at least three adults (two friends' parents and my mom, I think?) to pull me off.

But when I calmed down enough to sit still and stop attacking, I just saw my best friend Katie lying there beaten to a pulp. I looked around for any sign of my other self. I didn't see any. Not even a single glass slipper footprint.

By now, you might be suspecting some kind of psychotic break. My mom thought so, too. Frankly, everyone I ever relayed the birthday story to did. I eventually ended up in therapy. My mom says that what really happened was that Katie was getting a slice of cake early since she had to go home, and she would say goodbye to me after I went pee, but I suddenly attacked her. My mom thinks I saw her taking the first slice and threw a tantrum. But I know what I saw that day. Needless to say, Katie and I weren't friends after that. I lost a lot of friends, actually. The Jealous Step-Sister became a cruel nickname for me at school, a vicious parody of the party I tried to have for myself.

Eventually, I stopped trying to convince anyone about the doppelganger story. The psychiatrist at my family therapist put me on anti-psychotics. They made me drowsy and hungry, but I started to think that I really had dreamed up this whole thing. Maybe this doppelganger was a recurring nightmare, and I just had a psychotic break from the trauma of it when I beat Katie into the ground.

But of course, it's never that simple. The next time I saw her, I was fifteen. I had my first boyfriend, Anthony. Anthony was sixteen, short, a little chubby, and really good at math. Not that any of that matters, but it gives you an idea of his overall vibe. He was the "nerdy fat kid" to most people. But I liked him, and we studied a lot together. He got me into anime and I got him into Harry Potter. It was typical teen stuff.

One day at school, I approached him and said hi in that awkward flirty way teens do. He looked pissed off. I asked him what was wrong. He scoffed and said, "I thought you were "Done playing around with the fat nerd"." I asked him what the hell he was talking about. He pulled out his phone — an old 90s flip phone, of course — and began to read aloud.

"Anthony, I can't do this anymore. I'm done playing around with the fat nerd. You're a creepy loser who sits around and watches cartoons. Call me when you lose the weight and get some real hobbies."

I accused him of making that all up, of course, but he shoved the phone in my face to see for myself. Sure enough, it was my contact and number on the tiny screen. He snapped it shut in my face, called me a shallow bitch, and walked away. I checked my own phone in confusion, and sure enough, I had sent those exact words to him the night before. But I didn't remember it at all.

Right then, I got a text from, you guessed it, my own phone number.

"That's for ruining my birthday, you slut."

This had to be a joke, right? But no. Spoofing numbers wasn't as easy back then as it is now. Besides, if it was spoofed, my own phone wouldn't have had the records, right? I looked around in anger, fully expecting to see the other me by now. Sure as shit, I did. She rounded the corner quickly at a speed walk. I chased her down into an empty hallway and into the girls' bathroom. Once inside, however, she was gone. Both stalls empty, too.

I pulled my anti-psychotics from my clutch purse and counted them out right there on the nasty sink, just to make sure I didn't miss any. I had to be going crazy, right? Some sort of schizophrenia or personality disorder? But no, I was taking all my pills exactly as scheduled. Eventually, I started talking to my therapist about the doppelganger again. Of course, me being a hormonal teenage girl in the 90s, he thought it was my period throwing off my meds, so he gave me a new pill that did just about the same amount of nothing.

My entire life has been more and more of the same. Every once in a while, this "other me" would appear and cause chaos in my livelihood. Sometimes I'd be the one being spotted while she was doing something "normal," like at the fateful birthday party. Most of the time, it was me dealing with the fallout of something she did. And I feel like it all ties back to that day that I'm the one that went home with my mom instead of her.

However, even though her actions got meaner, she never stopped being just as scared of me as I was as her. And the few times I did get her back, I wasn't exactly nice either. I'm not sure that she knows she's the fake one, or if she thinks she's real and I'm the clone, or what. I've never seen her do something demonic or supernatural. She's always just been me, down to the fear and anger. It's like we're rivals fighting over the same life.

Speculations aside, let's cut to the most recent time I saw her: the start of this week. Now, I'd been living here for about fifteen years now. The other me's constant antics would get me into lots of trouble, and my mom wouldn't hear a word about me not being the one doing any of it. I eventually got myself off of medication and moved my ass away from my mom just to try and start fresh somewhere.

I've become a bit of a recluse, paranoid that if I were to start making friends she'd sabotage it, or I'd see her in my place and repeat another Katie incident. I didn't want to end up in prison for assault or being blamed for slashing someone's tires or God-knows-what-else.

Last night, as I was making dinner, she came out from my bedroom. She gave me that frightened look again, which I matched. I decided I had enough. I had to see what the fuck was happening. I had to talk to her.

"Let me guess," I began, choking down my fear and replacing it with fury. ""What are you doing in my kitchen?""

She looked at me like a deer in headlights, obviously shaken.

"You… You can talk?"

"Of course I can fucking talk," I replied. "I just don't bother doing it anymore. You'll come along and fuck it up."

"*Me*, fuck things up?" Her voice got angry in return. "I'm not the one who appeared in our fucking childhood home and beat the shit out of Katie while I was having cake!"

"Katie wasn't even there! I was going for *you*! You got sang *my* birthday song in front of *my* friends, broke up with *my* boyfriend—"

"It was **my** birthday! Why can't you just fuck off already?"

I got enraged. I grabbed the boiling pot of stew from the stove and threw it in that fake bitch's face. She screamed and blistered. Again, no monster reveal, no teleporting magic, no "it was all a dream".

She just blistered. Like a human would. She grabbed the knife from the table and stabbed me in the arm. We rolled around on the floor, screaming bloody murder at each other. Neither of us agreed on who was the fake. We'd let our fists decide. Winner take all.

I blacked out. I'm typing this on my phone from the hospital. I'm showing this post to the psychiatrist tomorrow. According to the doctors, I had a break after a prolonged period of being off my medication. I poured hot food all over myself, permanently scarring my face and body, and slashed at myself with a knife.

Neighbors reporting screaming. Not multiple voices. Just a single, crazy bitch with a kitchen knife. Police arrived and I was on the ground in critical condition. I was out for four days from a concussion and blood loss. Luckily, I put my mom on my do not contact list ages ago. She'd never let me hear the end of it.

I hear the nurse coming, so I'll end this here for now. Please, if anyone can tell me what the FUCK is going on, even if I'm just crazy, let me know. If any of you know any magic or hoodoo or ancient banishing rituals for this shit, please share. I'm losing my will to do this much longer. And I swear on my very soul. That nurse looks just. Fucking. Like me.

Riley out. Let's hope I'm the right one.
