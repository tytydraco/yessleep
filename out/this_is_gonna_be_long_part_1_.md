not sure if these are supposed to be true or not but here goes nothing. this was about 4 or 5 years ago. not really sure what time of year i just know that is was warm enough for me to be wearing shorts (so i will assume summer time). not going to disclose any locations or names and i apologize for my lack of proper grammar/capitalization. 

anyways, little backstory: one of my close friends was telling me about an abandoned factory that was no more than an hour away from where i lived at the time. my attention was instantly peaked. without me even asking, she gave me the coordinates and made me a small makeshift map with instructions on a sticky note on how to find a small entrance to get in to the property. they proceeded to inform me that the facility would be demolished within the next year. which meant in my head that i had to go asap. 

i was seeing a guy at the time who i brought the idea up to and he was instantly game as well as one of my friends who is just ‘always down’ no matter what the event. we left midday the next day, equipped with waters and some snacks since we had no idea what we were about to find. i knew nothing but the name of a small old school building and what direction to walk from the house with ‘a large porch and 3 old cars in the front yard. 

we arrived parked the car and began to walk towards a long fence, turned when we hit the road and a few feet later i saw a small break in the fence. we climbed through one by one. (for reference this fence was tall like unclimbable. barbed wires topping it with boards and overgrown foliage and bushes growing up it). after entering the area we looked around and saw a lot of large buildings. vines grown up the sides graffiti all everywhere, and endless broken concrete, bottles, trash and paper. paper everywhere. it looked like any old spooky abandoned factory yet it felt like a little city in there. 

the first building we entered was kinda boring. it looked like it used to be three levels high but the floors had caved in and piled in the middle of the place. not much in terms of anything in there but old rotten wood and chains hanging from the windows. we went further in to the other side and found the entrance to a larger building. doors chained yet open, chain lay hanging from one door handle. 

we walked into a large open space. this time, it was a real building. there were rooms, stairs, bathrooms, and strange machines. we entered the rooms one by one - this is where it started to get weird. there was again an abundance of graffiti but this time it wasn’t so much tags as it was messages. a-lot about ebola. a-lot of nasty remarks. things about a man. ‘he is behind you,’ ‘he can hear you,’ ‘he’s watching.’ there was one room that has not left my memory to this day. it was lined with yellow police caution tape. there were no windows so it was dark we broke out the flashlights and saw a fuck ton of little stuffed animals - get this - hanging by the neck from the ceiling by little strings Nailed into the ceiling. each of them had a small drawn figure on it i got not clue how to describe any of them. words covering the walls. ‘your fucked’ ‘he’s here’ ‘he knows he’s waiting in the dark’ ‘there’s no going back the eyes have seen the eyes have seen GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT.’ i’m frozen. kinda giggling at how spooked i am. we exit the little room after taking some pictures and see some bathrooms. walking in, dark again no windows and not something i would even set foot into again. there were scratches on the mirror and what looked like dried blood. the stalls were bent and tilted but still standing somehow as if they had been punched and kicked in a fit of rage by a well equipped middle schooler that just hit puberty. 

we stayed in there for maybe a second and walked out. i got a bad feeling and i was really starting to freak out but hiding it well enough i think. there was a ladder a few feet ahead so we climbed to the third floor. this building had probably 5 floors and a-lot more below but we’re not there yet. 

upstairs, we found it important to watch our step and we’re warned many times by the writing in the walls. there were a few doors lanes with an exit sign on each wall of this floor but each one we opened just led to an absence of floor. like if you were to stem through the door way you would fall into a pile of rusty metal. we found this quite humerus. after much exploring we found evidence of people or something living in the small rooms of the upstairs. hotdog cases and rotten smelling piles of substance. we left quickly. after going back down to the first level, it was harder to tell where we were. this building was very large and even going down same way we went up, everything looked different. the sun was also setting so it could have been the lighting ig. we walked towards what we thought was the exit but it tuned out to be just walls. no doors. as we walked we came across an opening. a long dark tunnel that looked somewhat like the entrance to an underground parking garage. wide enough for maybe two small cars close together. 

this ‘driveway’ went down. a large looping down. both the others instantly decided to start walking down but i stood at the top. waiting. i couldn’t get myself to go any further. they called for me called me names and teased until i slowly started towards them. it got darker with every step and out flashlights seemed to dim the further down we went. i freeze. 

we all at the same time made eye contact with each other to confirm we were all in our right minds and this confirmed what had happened was real. a soft voice seemed to whisper like a wind type of whisper, ‘he’s waiting for you.’ none of us made a sound. utter silence aside from a distant dripping of liquid. we have come to a large vast opening. if felt as if we were deep underground when we could have only been about 20ft down. maybe. idk at this point there was nothing in my brain but fear. the light from our flashlights could pick out no end to the room. only the large holes in the concrete. we were too focused on our steps to really pick up anything that was happening around us. 

on that note i’m tired and am gonna go to bed. lmk if anyone is interested in a part 2.
