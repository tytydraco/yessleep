"I just didn't see myself ending up with someone like you," my best friend, my girlfriend, the girl whose smile changes my day, Amber said while I was on one knee proposing to her.

"Oh," I said and didn't move. Amber swayed under the yellow streetlight. She wore all-white and she was at her beautiful best. Her hair was done, her fingers and nails were done, and the dress was short enough to show off the trail of enchantment that was her legs.

I chose this location, this exact spot outside of our church because it was where we first met. I thought she would think it was sweet.

"Yeah…" she said.

"Yeah, you will marry me?" I was elated. My smile widened with hope. I imagined our friends, the dancing, and sweet Amber walking down that aisle. She smiled… but it did not reach her eyes

"No, like I was just saying yeah, 'I didn't imagine ending up with someone like you,'" she still smiled. "Like, I was just repeating myself."

"Oh, what's that mean?"

"Someone like you... you know?" She never stopped smiling. Her smile still changed my whole day because right now it scared me.

"What am I like?" I adjusted squirmed, and waggled but remained in the same spot, unsure of what to do next.

She smiled wider. She shrugged. 

"But, Amber, I said. "You kept talking about kids, about marriage. You said we were getting older and running out of time."

"Yes," her smile strained into a half grimace, half toothy grin. "So, perhaps we should break up."

I fell back, my butt hit the floor. The ring hit the floor and rolled toward me. My jaw dropped. In shock, I ignored the rest of what she said. As she spoke, she watched the ring spin in three circles and roll back to me. Then the strangest thing happened, or perhaps not so strange based on what I found out, the ring reversed. It rolled backward and stopped at Amber's white sandaled feet.

"Oh," she said. "Got that for you." She squatted down and held the ring out to me. Like you give a stray cat food. I hate to admit it. It's embarrassing to write and I hope you don't judge me but, I followed her lead. I crawled forward, accepted the ring from her hand, and thanked her for it.

"You're welcome," she said. "You're still bringing me home, right? Let's go." She didn’t wait for me to say yes.  She stepped out of the yellow light and I followed behind her flowing white dress pushed by the wind. I opened the passenger door for her and drove her home.

I wish the car ride was awkward or at least sad. We dated for four years. It was over. She was my best friend. All she wanted to talk about on the way home was one of her shows. It wasn't even one we watched together. Some random one. We were in the car together but I never felt so alone.

My best friend was gone and I was the only one who cared.

I tried to interrupt with pressing questions or expressing how I was feeling but she answered with stone-like disinterest. After dropping her off, I laid in my bed for a while cuddled up only with my thoughts that were dropping past the negative to the abysmal.

“I just didn't see myself ending up with someone like you,” 

What did that even mean? I thought back to this OG Twilight Zone episode where an astronaut goes to an alien planet full of people who look and act like humans. Long story short, they put him in a zoo to be an exhibit on the planet. And he's begging and asking why, why, why, and then he shouts at them to let him out, "I'm just like you. I'm just like you," he says as the credits roll and he's trapped there forever. 

That's how I felt the whole ride. I'm just like you, Amber. Why can't you see that?

A weighted blanket of self-deprecation, self-hate, insecurity, fear of the future, and a bastardization of my past covered me as I laid in bed alone. *Was I going to be alone forever? Was something wrong with me because she broke it off so easily?* She didn't even care. It all was so wrong because the way she treated me felt evil; we were best friends and I wouldn't treat a friend like that, much less someone I loved. 

The more I thought, the sadder I got, and tears flowed. I shivered despite my covers. Then the fears stopped because something clicked in my brain. Everyone treated me like this. Like I was something to be disregarded at will. My job, my church, and my friends. That wasn't how things were supposed to be. 

But then I thought, *I wasn’t perfect, maybe I deserved that.*

But I knew that wasn’t right. It was like I physically felt the gears in my brain turning and it hurt. Not emotionally anymore; I was getting a mild headache from the thought. The pain rolled forward into suffering when I thought deeper and reversed into peace when I thought less. However, I didn't want peace; I wanted answers so I dug in. I realized it wasn't right that no matter how much I tried I still didn't have the respect of my friends. There were so many little things that came through my head. Secrets I overheard, side comments, and how they treated me when things got tough.

*How was I supposed to feel?* I've given my everything to my company and then I've been given condolences instead of a promotion. When was the last time I left on time? I arrived before the sun rose. I left after the sunset. I receive pats on the back but never anything I wanted, not even respect. 

And to gain respect, there's no joke I can tell, no weight I can lift, or gift I can give to be like my friends. Incidents of offense flash,  of the physical and mental but it's a verbal one that sticks with me. It's one of my friends mocking me. I was going through a time so I remember having to ask them to be kinder…they were not. We sat at a table for a group dinner. They spoke above a whisper and below a proclamation. 

"Do you think he peaked in high school?" 

"Well, he rents a shack and he's always alone." 

And they laughed and moved on like it's nothing. First, why would anyone say that about their friends? Second, it wasn't even true. I hadn't peaked at all. I was okay in high school, and had some friends but ever since I got to this town things had gotten worse. My life never had a peak, just slopes.

I laid on the bed, sweating. It poured from me until the sheets were soaked. My eyes stayed open, stayed wide. *If I shut them would I go back to being blind? If I slept would I wake up a happy stooge again?*

This had my head throbbing... This town I was in was the only place I was treated like this. I had a life outside of this: normal friends, and normal relationships. I didn't have to stay at the bottom of the totem pole. *So, why did I stay there?* There had to be a good reason, right? I didn't have a career; I worked at a movie theater, but I had a college degree. I decided I would leave that night, not forever but for now; I wasn't bold enough to leave forever. 

As if on cue, I heard the roaches in the ceiling vents doing that disgusting *skitter scattering*. I had roaches in my ceiling! *Why was I still there?*

I leaped up and pulled out a duffle bag. I had to leave right then.

Tiredness was a million miles away from me. Sleep couldn't catch me, so I ran quick. I ran silent. I had the strong impression that someone did not want me to leave. That someone could be watching me. I didn't dare turn the lights on. My fear was that pressing. My fear was that real, the flashlight of my phone was my only guide. 

I tip-toed, froze at the sight of shadows, and flinched as my floors groaned. I stuffed my clothes and muttered curses because I was exposed, bent down, and susceptible. The roaches *skitter-skater* was not a comfort. I imagined them dropping from the ceiling and crawling on me, another attempt to force me to stay.

I went down my checklist. Socks, underwear, the shoes I wore were fine, shorts, and shirts. All of my shirts were hung in my closet. It was across the room. Large enough to fit two people, and cracked open.  I did not remember leaving it cracked open. It was possible, but if I'm honest it's always scared me so I try to leave it shut. I shone the white light at it. Revealing, just the type of nondescript shirts I'd want if I was on the run. But so much darkness, so many shadows to hide in.

 I walked forward anyway, my steps were so light if I was outside the wind that licked and smacked the window would have tossed me around. I walked toward the closet and felt I only had a minute to live. There was something about it, something that was dangerous.

 *Rip.*

 In my haste, I tore a shirt but that was enough for me. I grabbed three shirts, stuffed them in my suitcase, and ran outside. When I went through the door, relief raptured me into ecstasy. When I saw my car, terror dragged me into flaming misery.

I retreated. Slammed the door and put my back against it. My strength left. I slid down. There was a blade in each one of my tires. Put there recently, the horrible hiss of air leaving tires haunted me from outside my door. Someone did not want me to leave and they were either outside or near my house. 

The roaches walking above me was like torture to me now.

Despite my fear, I was determined to leave. I brought out my phone and gambled between calling for the police or for Uber. 

*Surely, if this was a massive scandal to keep me here, the police would be in on it. But a random Uber driver at am? Maybe, not.*

The phone light! I kept the phone light on and that was damning me, that was the only thing my attacker could see. I had to be quick, then cut it off. I went into the app, did what I needed to call it, and shut it off immediately.

"Trying to leave was strike one," a voice said from inside my house. I stopped everything; I stopped moving, stopped thinking, and stopped breathing. The voice sounded close, like in my living room. I imagined him, arms outstretched sitting there, legs crossed, maybe another blade beside him.

"You can talk; I know you're right in front of the door. I watched you leave. I watched you come in." It was a male voice, cordial, regal but not royalty, more CEO than King.

"You're at strike two for the Uber call," he said, "Don't make me mad and get to strike three."  I heard the couch shuffle under duress of movement. I heard my floor creak and groan as the steps led toward me, and the smell of mold leaped from him and invaded my nostrils and tongue.

"Speak!" he yelled.

"Yes, yes, yes," I said, "I'm here."

"Good, so we're on the same page."

"Who are you?"

"I'm Mr. Pepperjack."

"Oh, okay Mr. Pepperjack, what do you want?"

 "For you not to get to strike 3."

"What happens when I get to strike 3?" 

"Let's not find out. So, go to bed."

"No, I decided I'm leaving so I'm going to go."

"Because everyone here treats you horribly?"

"Yes..." I paused. "How did you know?"

"Because that's why you're here. You're here to be the butt of the joke, the big girl at the ball, the gum on the shoe, the slave on the end of the whip."

"I---i-i-i don't want to be any of that. I won't be any of that. Not anymore."

"Cute."

"So, here's what's going to happen." He stepped closer. "I advise you to move that light back. Trust me you don't want to see what I look like. That's right, move it down." 

The light shone on his slim legs and brown loafers. "Good, boy." He said, "Now, here's what's going to happen. You're going to hop in your bed and pretend this never happened."

"I don't want to do that," I said.

"Oh, he doesn't want to do that. Well, what if I told you - - "

Bzz

Bzz

I didn't move. The Pepperjack man laughed so deep, so loud, and so monstrous, that he might as well have been Santa Clause's evil cousin. His body laughed, his slim legs tremored in baggy green slacks.

"Go ahead, answer it," he said and I could hear his smile. "Let's get this party started."

"Is it a strike?" I asked.

"Yes, strike three but I’ll give you a head start. I swear on your life."

I didn't know what that last part meant but I took the risk and answered. It was from a strange number I didn't recognize. I put my phone to my ear and the Pepperjack man disappeared in the dark.

"I'm your Uber. I'm outside," he said. I turned the volume down, afraid of what the Pepperjack man would do if he found out I could leave. 

"Oh," I said and waited to hear new movement or anger from the Pepperjack man. The house remained silent, only his stench remained. 

"That was quick," I said to the man on the phone. Too quick. It didn't seem right and why was the Pepperjack man allowing this? 

"Yeah, that's the Lyft guarantee or whatever."

"I thought you were Uber."

"Uh, I do both. Gotta make a living. You coming or not?" the man on the phone said. He seemed rude, and bothered, a characteristic unbecoming for a man whose job was based on getting customer reviews. 

In fact, I had the odd revelation he was not an Uber driver. I pondered if staying right here with the Pepperjack man was better. I think the saying goes something like "Better the devil you know than the devil you don't." 

But is that something I could live with forever? Staying here, with friends who hated me, a girlfriend who didn't respect me, and an employer who overlooked me. No, I couldn't. I turned off the camera light and the floorboards creaked because of old age or the Pepperjack man's movements. I shut my mouth, demanded silence from my body, and slid up the door. The floor creaked again. 

I took the risk. I opened the door and threw myself out, suitcase in hand. I rolled forward. If he was behind me I wouldn't let him touch me. My car wasn't the only vehicle in the driveway anymore. A large silver bus rested across from me. It didn't make sense and I didn't care. I pushed forward to the restless behemoth, smoke burst through its exhaust. The bus doors whooshed apart for me and I was greeted with the smell of cleaning supplies and urine.

"Uber for, Derrick?" I asked genuinely.

The bus driver, chubby, bald, and pale said, "Yeah, whatever kid." 

It didn't make sense but that was good enough for me. I headed toward the back of the bus and stopped in my tracks. 

The bus's occupants were unsettling caricatures of humanity. An elderly woman with orange hair pet a fresh skull with strips of meat still on it. A dark man with pointed ears and two heads cursed at himself and demanded I come to settle a dispute. A fleshless woman traced her fingers up my back.  I felt I didn’t step into a nightmare, I didn’t step into Hell, I stepped into something far scarier, undefined, and that was breaking my mind.

Terror pushed me off the bus and back into the house. I ran across the driveway and slammed the door and flicked my flashlight back on. Once again, I pushed my back against the door, my only safe spot. The Pepperjack man's scent bled into my nostrils. I whipped the flashlight around my house to catch him before he caught me. Three quick sweeps across showed me nothing but my empty house.

Slower. He had to be there. I smelled him. I sensed him. The hairs on the back of my neck stood at attention. Slower, Slower, calmer thoughts. Slower, racing heart. Slower scan of my environment. I started from the right and decided to make a full scan.

I moved my flashlight to my right and saw my coat hanger where only a black raincoat remained. The other two coats had fallen, they puddled around it. In front of me, was the hallway leading to the empty kitchen and the living room, right behind it. I eyed each chair like he could be there. They were each empty.

To the left, I moved it, where he had to be! 

Nothing leaped out. Nothing was there except my bare walls. I sat with the silence, with my thoughts, with the skittering of roaches in the vents. Only the roaches weren't skittering. Above me, there was silence. I was attacked from above. A fist landed on my head.My head bounced against the floor.

"That's three strikes, Derrick," he mocked and slammed my head again. "Here's your prize." He dragged me across my floor, bloody and dazed. I almost dropped my phone.

"Don't drop that," he said."I need you to see. You have to see all of this."

I moved like a slug through my house. Instead of slime, my blood was the trail, all the way to my room, all the way to my closet.

"Open it!" he commanded.

I obeyed. I wasn't afraid anymore, just in so much pain.

The white world moved around me but I managed. I pulled apart the doors and it all came back to me. I know why I was so afraid, I had done this before. 

SO. MANY. TIMES. 

I stuffed so much in the corners of the closet and forgot all about it. A certificate I got to become a personal trainer. I had a job offer in a new city but I didn't leave because I wanted to stay here. Notebooks full of scripts and stories, I was going to try my hand at screenwriting. Scholarships and loans for schools that accepted me but I never went to. Postcards from my parents, from my friends, my real friends asking me to come visit.

Dreams not shattered, but neglected and as a parent who neglects their child knows, that time can never come back. Like children abandoned by a parent, they stared back accusingly. The weight of wasted time, of squandered potential, crushed me.  I can't express the profound guilt and worthlessness I felt. Imagine knowing every problem in your life was all your fault and, heck, maybe you deserved it.

"You are not the master of your fate,” the Pepperjack Man mocked me. “You're the battered wife who can't leave.  Now go make me a sandwich like a good girl.” 

I had to leave. I acted with fierce desperation. I whipped out the knife, rose, and stabbed the Pepperjack man in the chest. 

In, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, and in, out.

The honk of the bus outside tore through the night and sliced my self-pity. The bus still waited for me.  I had to get on the bus. I'd rather ride with monsters than wade in misery.

The knife's plunge and pull sounded like a *whisk* and a *squish* as I made sure to slice somewhere new every time. 

In, out, In, out, In... he pulled me close and kneed my groin. I flopped to the floor and laid beneath him. He picked up the phone and showed the light on his horrible face. Holes, he had so many holes of all sizes. I saw straight through him.

“I've been shot, I've been stabbed, I've been everything but killed. You'll still be here when you are 87 years old telling me you deserve better."

"But saying all that," I spit out blood. "You can't stop me from leaving, can you?"

"You stop you from leaving!" He barked back.

"But you don't."

"You won't leave. You like this. You like being needed."

I inched away, every movement a struggle against pain and fear. As I neared the door, his voice softened.

"The girl comes back to you, you know?" I heard it in his voice now. He was standing, he wasn't hurt, but he was the one entering desperation. "It won't work out with the guy she wants.

You really are what's best for her. She will need you."

I kept crawling.

"Your friends really are as spectacular as you think," he confirmed. The floorboards creaked to mark his approach behind me. "You're going to miss the adventure of your lifetime staying with them."

I doubted that. I was going on a bus with monsters. What could be more adventurous?

"You're ignoring me," the Pepperjack man yelled. "You're ignoring me but did you know you came to me first? You act all high and mighty now but you came to me because you had no purpose. You didn't know what you needed. I gave you something to want."

I left my home and the Pepperjack man's whining. Again, I entered the bus.

"Hey, sorry about the scares, kid," the bus driver said. "But you didn't think it would be full of the angels and beautiful on this tough road out of town. Nah, to get to your world you have to sit with some others who are trying to get home. They're freaks, yeah but they're just like you. Just trying to make it home."

I nodded once and took my seat on the bus. The bus driver Sam, as I'd find out later, was right. They were freaks but also a lot like me. As the bus rolled on, I found unexpected kinship with my fellow travelers. We shared stories over card games, our laughter a strange counterpoint to our grotesque appearances. They urged me to write about this journey, to capture the beauty in our shared brokenness. 

I am still somewhat upset I wasted so much of my time there. But reader, I ask you not to judge me so hard, after all, like I said before, I'm Just Like You. Look around you. Are you withering away in a place that you don't quite seem to fit in? If you find yourself in a place you hate and you can't quite escape, understand you can, but you may be under the influence of the Pepperjack Man.
