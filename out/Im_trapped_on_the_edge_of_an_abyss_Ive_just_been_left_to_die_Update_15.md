We didn’t waste time after exiting the room. The door was calling out to listening ears with its grinding gears, and we weren’t going to wait around for the serpent to hear it.

Ann and Hope limped along carrying the dazed scientist while June and I cleared the path ahead of debris. The monster had done a number on the space in its tantrum, knocking over pews and the pulpit along with any other tables that might have been in range. Hell, even the push doors that we’d entered through had been smashed off their hinges and into the hallway as the beast tried to exit using the same method. The room hardly looked the same at all as when we entered, but it didn’t really matter to me. I was never fond of it.

Though, I tried not to let my eyes linger on the spilled grey soot that poured from the knocked over golden urn as we passed, or the picture of the beautiful woman holding her baby daughter with a smile that had landed next to it.

My heart was pounding, of course; that much was a given. It was even more amped at how long it was already taking to get out of the space. The door had finally come to its clunking stop behind us, and we’d only reached the main hallway. We were moving too slow. Even with multiple people supporting him, dragging the scientist's body like a 200 pound sack of limp potatoes was going to slow us no matter what, and we had a long way to go to get out. We needed a new approach. Luckily, half of the building was a hospital.

“Wait,” I called out, running off to the side of the space toward the medical section of the room, “June, help me with this!”

“What the hell are you doing!?” Ann snapped, “We don’t have time for this! That thing has to be on its way back!”

I agreed, but the thing was, we didn’t hear it yet. If it was on its way back, surely we’d hear it screeching up the hallways as it shifted back and forth between its two forms. Now that the door had stopped grinding, though, there was nothing but the eerie crackle of the now broken organ in the corner, still faithfully singing out its hymns. This was good news now, but was worrisome because it meant one of two things.

The first was that us ripping that scientist free had done exactly what it did to Zane's, and the rooms outside of this one had turned into a vast, expanding labyrinth of hospital rooms and funeral lounges. As likely as this option was, part of me had hoped so deeply that maybe the rig already malfunctioning would have prevented this from happening. I should know by now that luck isn’t usually in my cards, however.

The second reason was much simpler than the first explanation. The creature was smarter than we gave it credit for, and it was simply lying in wait.

Either way, we would have to cross those bridges when we got to one. For now, we weren’t being pursued, so I continued with my current plan. June helped me shove aside a few more pews, then I grabbed the edges of Mom’s old hospital bed from the corner, kicking the locks off the wheels and yanking hard.

The whole thing went rolling toward the door, and I could see Hope and Ann’s faces light up with recognition. They met us halfway, then June and I held the mattress steady while they flopped the poor soul down onto it. He made a slight gurgling as what blood he had left began soaking the sheets, and I tried not to feel too sick about it. They were dead soon no matter what; at least their suffering would be over.

My idea was an almost instant success as we glided into the hallway like a boat through still water, all of us hanging off the edge of the bed and kicking with our feet as we paddled along. With the body matter settled, the pressure of our timer seemed a little less head pounding, but it was clear that it was still very much a factor.  

The rig was doing as expected, I could tell even from the two plain halls that went either direction. They were longer now, stretching much further than natural, and from the looks of it, they were still spreading. I could see it at the seams where the building’s two styles clashed; the strange slices that turned hospital into funeral home where shifting. More wooden paneling slipped from the cracks and began snaking along the wall as if it were a roll of paper being printed, and the carpet followed suit. Like a conveyor belt, any furniture or objects in the halls found themselves moving along with the shifting rooms, and while it was unnerving to watch, it was at least a good indicator of how fast the place was coming undone. It was slow. Manageable.

So long as we kept moving.

“Which way?” June asked, urging us forward as she glanced over her shoulder.

“Well, we came from that side,” Hope noted, pointing down the left hallway, “We should try retracing our steps. It doesn’t look like the layout is changing at all, only the size.”

Nobody had any arguments; not even Ann had qualms for a change. We took off rolling down the hallway, the wheels of the bed clacking and humming as we shifted from hard tile to weathered floral carpet.

The roll of the wheels was nearly inaudible. The gurney was surprisingly well oiled for having been found in a decrepit recreation of my past. Still, whenever it hit the tile and got a little louder, my muscles would tighten and my teeth would clench, bitterly afraid that I might hear the screaming join the fray. Each bumpy seam made my heart skip a beat, and when we finally reached the turn into the hall we’d entered from, I couldn’t be more relieved.

The longer we ran the more worried I became, however. I knew I should be glad that we weren’t being disturbed, by I knew by this point that things didn’t work out easy for us, and this was far too easy so far. Perhaps this feeling also came from a revelation I had as we passed by the shifting floors and décor. It was something I caught when I witnessed a painting in the funeral home reach the end of its section.

Instead of meeting the hospital wall and continuing to slide onto that shifting surface, or just falling to the floor as the nail holding it was spit out, the edge of the frame slipped into the crack joining the corridors together. It was slow, and I didn’t get to see the entire process, but as we flew by I know I saw it start to crunch and shatter as it was swallowed by the rig.

This place wasn’t just expanding. It was eating itself alive. A building to compliment the Ouroboros living in its shifting guts.

I couldn’t process all the implications that fact held for us just yet, my brain too overwhelmed, but the stress it added I was certainly able to feel.

We sprinted down the next hall and passed the elevator, knowing that even attempting to ride it in the rig's current state spelled nothing but disaster. In silence, we all read each other's minds and agreed that ditching the bed and carrying the body down the stairs was the best path forward. It turned out, however, that we hardly needed to.

The stairs, like the rest of the building, were also in a shifting state, stretched slightly wider than normal and slowly rolling in on itself. To our luck, they were moving down instead of up, and with the wider steps, the slope would be less extreme if we just cautiously rolled the bed down them. The girls and I gingerly maneuvered the gurney into the stairs, then looked at each other to make another silent decision. This was going to be loud.

Before we even had time to think, Ann gave the bed a shove at the head, and June and I scrambled to catch the foot and lower it as gentle as we could. The frame of the cart rattled as it smacked loudly against the first step, and my frail bones screamed out in agony as I placed them under heavy strain. Still, we were in it now, and we had to roll with it.

*Ka-thunk, Ka-thunk, Ka-thunk!*

We stopped once the top part of the bed had finally been brought onto the stairs, then everyone listened. Still no screaming. Still no low hissing. Ann went to push the bed down some more, but I pressed back on it, holding it in place and shooting her a glare. Our bodies weren’t built for this kind of thing anymore, and we’d be in worse shape if June and I failed to keep the bed steady, let it slip, then broke our bones as it came crashing on top of us. We were already nearly to the landing platform; all we had to do was ride the steps like an escalator and we’d reach the bottom at the expense of only a few seconds.

I could see this angered Ann, but I didn’t budge, and Hope didn’t help her, sensing my intentions. Mine and June’s side of the bed hit the bottom, and we quickly lifted it off as the step it was resting on was swallowed whole by funeral carpet.

Ann and Hope guided their end down onto the switchback, then we repeated the process on the next set of stairs. I glanced over my shoulder toward the propped open stair door, praying that I didn’t see the serpent there waiting for us, its silent ebony form gasping with its bottomless maw. When we hit the bottom of that set of stairs, my anxiety spiked as I had to turn my back to it in order to guide the bed off once more.

*‘It’s too easy… this is all too easy…’* I couldn’t stop from thinking.

Something had to go wrong. It always went wrong. Even outside this place.

We rushed down the slightly longer hall with extra fervor, knowing we were in the home stretch. Ahead, I could see the side of the reception desk as it slid across the floor of the space, as well as catch the nameplates of the hospital and funeral home as they were slurped away into a crack. It wasn’t until we got closer and I saw the entirety of the reception desk begin shattering into the crevasse of the floor that my revelation from earlier finally reared its ugly implications, and the wrench that I knew was bound to get caught up in the mix finally slammed me in the face.

The exit wall. If it was sliding along too, then that meant the door out would also be.

“No… No, no, no,” I panted through gritted teeth, pushing myself to drag the bed a little faster.

We burst around the corner, and my eyes were damp with watery desperation as I stared toward the wall that we’d come in from. The entire wall was one moving surface, and we’d arrived just in time to see the last half of the exit door scrape into the corner of the room. The automatic sensor box popped off the wall and clattered to the floor with a loud plastic crash, and the glass barrier that peered into the parking lot beyond disappeared from sight. This might not have been an issue if every other window to the place hadn’t been replaced by bare concrete on the other side of its glass.

We were trapped.

“Shit!” Ann hollered in frustration.

“What do we do?” June whimpered, “Hensley, what do we do?”

“Was it worth it? Those few seconds we wasted on the steps back there?” Ann hissed at me, “What, were you too tired to get your ass moving!?”

My head swam with nausea as my mouth fell open, too in shock and panic and terror to even respond. I had no answer to June’s question, and I sure as shit didn’t know how to respond to Ann. The only thing I knew was that it wasn’t going to be kind, but that didn’t matter. Things were about to get a lot worse.

Not only had I been right about the rig collapsing earlier, but I was also correct in one of my theories about the snake. It was *much* smarter that I’d given it credit for, and the reason it had been so quiet was because it *had* been lying in wait.

It was June's face that alerted me to it first, then the screams that quickly followed. Ann’s vicious glare was smacked off immediately from fear as she and Hope whipped around and took a few steps back, all of us moving the bed closer to where the door had once been. We were trapped, locked in the alcove of the lobby with the snake slithering out of a nearby office behind the desk. It had known where we’d be heading once we left the room, and it came to wait in the nearest burrow.

Its haunting black, glistening scales melted into the dark room that it hovered from like it was emerging from a pond, the fleshy grey tissue in its maw undulating in hungry anticipation as it drew closer and closer. The moment it hit the hospital lobby, the scales flickered over to their pale side, the black snake folded backward to consume itself, and out came the porcelain head hiding deep in its gullet, bringing the infernal screams with it. The needles beneath its scales unsheathed like claws, and soon its steady, calm glide through the air was a dangerous, writhing dance.

Time felt motionless even though the whole world was shifting and collapsing around us. The beast continued closer, but it felt so far away as my brain ran frantic numbers on what to do. The first step was obvious, but simply not feasible given our position: escape.

The beast was too big to fight, and we didn’t even have anything that would make a dent in its massive form. All we could do was attempt to book it past.

Ann led the charge first, yanking the head of the bed forward and to the side, to which we all followed suit. I admit, we took off much faster than I’d expected us to be able to move, and with four sets of legs pumping at once, we flew almost as fast as a car. I think even the snake was shocked at how quickly its prey began to slip for the open gap on its side, and for a moment as we came parallel to its head, I thought maybe we’d been quick enough to make it.

Like its intelligence, I’d underestimated the agility of its hulking body.

The beast reared back in on itself with a rattling scream of agony, angling toward us and crashing through a few of the tiles that lined the shifting ceiling. That’s when its form became more horrific. Between the folds of tissue that its glass face was protruding from, pale, grasping hands slipped out on all sides, slapping at its own body and clawing at the air as if looking for a rope to pull them out. It happened so fast that I barely had time to register it, and before any of us could react, it lunged out in a blur.

One second it was reared up, the next I was getting slammed into the wall, crushed by the bed as its form pressed the other side.

A shooting pain shot through me, and I felt something in my hip nearly pop out of its intended joint. June screamed louder than the beast as it came mere inches from missing her, only catching the fury of a couple protruding needles. She fell back away from them as they cut at her cheek and arm like peach flesh, deep and effortless. Ann got the next worst of the blow as the serpent hit more to the front than the back, pressing harder into her than it had to me. I heard a full snap of something over the screaming and ringing in my ears, and I had a feeling it wasn’t part of the bed frame based on how Ann joined the chorus.

With Ann and June accounted for, I could barely bring myself to analyze the last member of our party. The best of us. The one closest to the serpent when it dashed…

Hope was knocked over the side of the bed onto its surface, smacking her face onto one of the handrails and leaving her disoriented. The look of pain on her bloodied face as she lifted her head will never leave me as her eyes locked mine for the smallest moment. Time was moving faster than ever now, but it still felt motionless. Frozen in that one instant as she shared a glance, almost acknowledging that she knew what was about to happen.

The arms from the snake's face lashed out at the new sensations set before it, looking for anything to grasp at. There were two things easily within reach. The body on the bed, and Hope. In that frozen instant, I prayed that they would focus on the body. That they would find it more weak and vulnerable; the easier target. I didn’t care if it was our only ticket out of here, I couldn’t lose Hope. I couldn’t lose the only person here keeping me sane.

It's like I said earlier, though; It always went wrong for me. That truth must have been universal for all of myselves…

The hands gripped at the body at first, but once they realized most of their siblings had found purchase on a better target, they switched over to Hope. She didn’t even make a sound as they gripped at the back of her jacket and hair, then began to pull. She only grew a desperate look on her face of silent acceptance. The snake started to rear back, lifting her off the ground, and as it did, the arms began to retract, claustrophobically consuming her between the space of the mask and the black serpent's folded-back maw.

Ann shook her pain fast at the sight, then cried out in determined pain as she reached a hand out, catching Hope’s wrist and fighting against the dozens of others on Hope’s opposite side. The game of tug-o-war instantly relieved the pressure the bed was putting on us, and though my legs protested in agony, adrenaline urged me on as I clawed onto the bed and grabbed her other hand. The two of us pulled with all our might, but we were no match. The bed began to roll closer.

Hope let out a cry of pain as a hand gripping a fistful of hair gave a hard yank, fighting its new resistance. Tears began streaking violently down her face as her eyes once again fixed on mine, and she called out in desperation.

“L-Let go! Get out of here!”

We ignored her, and honestly, I was surprised to see that Ann did too. For someone who thus far had been nothing but focused on escape, even at the cost of each other, I would have thought that surely she would be the first to let go and take the moment to keep running. Perhaps she was thinking the same thing that I was however, being the other shitty Hensley of the two of us. We couldn’t let the only good flicker of our life die out, even in this place.

“June, get your ass up and help!” I commanded through gritted teeth, causing the sobbing girl to jump to her feet in shock. In my periphery, I could see her shaking like a motor, her legs nearly buckling as she stared at the scene before her, uncertain of what to do. I let out an angry growl that she jumped at as we were once again tugged a little further across the lobby, the snake winning this game effortlessly.

It was a little unfair for me to demand her help considering there was no real way for her to climb into position and pull, given that all space was taken. Still, it was angering me that she was frozen while the stakes were so high. That a part of myself could be so weak and cowardly as to freeze up in such an integral moment. It turned out that the poor girl was thinking though, and the thing that came to mind was really the only option.

Brute force.

June dashed to the edge of the bed where an IV hanger was mounted, then tugged upward on it, hard. It was mounted and locked in, but somehow in her adrenaline, the tiny girl was able to shatter the thing from its clamp before raising it over her head.

“Duck!” she yelled, and I did so, slipping my ass further down the bed and leaning my body back, still clutching Hope and not letting go. Her hips had just slipped beneath the porcelain mask when June swung the post like a bat over my head. I could feel the wind of it cut past my face, and the sound of it slicing the air somehow came through over the screams.

*CUNK!*

A heavy, high pitch crack filled the air as the hanger part of the pole connected right at the bridge of the snake's nose. The human mask became two as a large chasm formed across its surface, and from it, a thick black ichor began spilling out like a faucet. It bucketed down on hope, the bed, and me, coating us in warm, slick filth that smelled a sour sickly sweet, but that was the least of my worries.

The arms let go, and the beast reeled back with a screech that now sounded like a muffled, broken speaker recording.

The bed slungshot away with me still on it, and Hope slipped loose with a wet suctioning noise. She fell on top of me with a grunt, a black, oily mess so bad that I couldn’t even see her face. She was safe though, and that was all that mattered.

We didn’t waste a second of our opportunity. I shoved Hope off me onto the body, then rolled off the bed as Ann tugged hard, getting the thing moving once more. June was quick to aid the limping clone, and though my legs nearly buckled when I hit the ground, agony shooting through them, I didn’t allow them the better of me. I forced them to pump forward, and together we slipped into the side hall, leaving the snake a thrashing, angry mess in the lobby as it attempted to soothe its pain.

Its cries grew distant and muffled as we rounded the first corner, signifying that the creature still wasn’t giving chase, and we had some extra seconds. Hope was still laying on the bed covered in the black goo, not even attempting to move save for weakly wiping a bit of the grime from her face. The fact that she’d hit her head so hard and still seemed so dazed worried me, so I tried to speak to calm her.

“It’s okay, Hope, you’re safe now. Are you okay?”

I expected her to return a usual positive response, but instead, she just vacantly turned to me and stammered out something far more chilling.

“Hen, it—it got in my mouth—I swallowed some… And it got in my…” She reached up and wordlessly touched her forehead where blood from her gash swirled with the black oil, and vice versa. Seeing the unknown black goo leak into her wound made my legs weak again, and combined with Hope’s ill expression, I cursed myself for feeling relief moments ago. I didn’t know if we’d truly saved her just yet; something was horribly wrong.

“I… I’m not feeling so good…” she whimpered.

My eyes watered from the stress and panic of yet another variable, but the burning in my lungs and ache in my legs distracted me. All I could offer was a small, “I’m sorry, Hope… I’m so so sorry…”

That seemed to draw some clarity back to her, a flicker of guilt in her eyes, like she didn’t mean to make me sad. She reached a hand across the bed and gripped my wrist, as my legs continued pounding the tile and carpet, “N-no, you saved me… I-I…”

Whatever she was about to say after that, it fell apart between her lips and never came out. She just fell back against the mattress and shut her eyes tightly, a ghastly vertigo haunting her brain.

Ann cut in, still huffing and grunting and clearly just as panicked as the rest of us, “What the hell are we doing!? Where do we go!? There’s no more exit!”

I bit my cheek and thought, the guilt weighing heavy on me for slowing us down back at the stairs. I looked around the hall at the still cracking and snapping rig, trying to sort the logic of the structure in my mind for any possible second exit. As I stared at a crack in the wall as we began to run by, I yanked the bed hard, coming to a stop and inspecting something I saw there. We might not need a second exit, just the same one we’d just lost.

“Hensley what the fuck! Are you trying to get more of us killed!?” Ann cursed, trying to pry the bed free and continue moving.

I turned to her and shook my head, snapping back, “Look!”

From the crack, a small piece of wood appeared, then got slightly bigger, one inch, then two. Finally, some glass appeared, flanked by wood on the top and bottom, and behind it all, an oil painting of the sea. A picture that was hanging on the wall reborn.

“This place is eating and rebuilding itself! We just need to wait for the exit to come back by. Like a conveyor belt.”

Ann looked at the painting and scowled at me, “Well, good luck with that! We just almost died over there, and it’s where that thing is now! Plus, what if the exit comes back and it's blocked like all the windows!”

“There always has to be a door in and out of this place because one exists on the outside!” I told her, “We don’t really have any other options!”

“You almost just got Hope killed!” Ann jeered, “You’re the last person I’m taking plans from.”

I looked down at Hope on the bed, softly panting and palms to her temples, trying to stop the spinning world. Ann was right; if we hadn’t wasted time on the stairs, we could have been out that door before it vanished.

I needed to fix this, and thankfully, Hope was out of commission to stop me this time.

I looked at Ann, a look of anger on my face, but keeping my words cool and calm, “Well don’t worry. This might be the last time you have to listen to me.” I pointed further down the hall to where the second half of the loop back to the lobby began, “Keep moving. Go slow. Wait for me to draw it out.”

“Hen!” June tried to cry in protest as I spun on my heels and took off. Ann didn’t say anything, but a few steps down the corridor, I heard the bed wheels begin rolling once more.

A jolt of pain shot through my body with each bound down the hallway, and I was almost certain the bed slamming me fractured something in my hip. I tried to move fast, but knew that if there was any hope of surviving this, I was going to need all my energy to run in a second. The screams of the beast grew louder as it still writhed in the lobby, but they were now broken by a few moments of silence in between. It was at least back up and moving.

I rounded the last corner of the hospital corridor that led to the main hall, and looked down it to see the serpent angrily starting down the other corridor I’d just sent the others toward. I didn’t let myself think twice about it as I shouted as loud as I could.

“Hey!”

The beast was in a funeral section when it heard me, and while its deathly form had usually been the more smooth and graceful one, it was moving fast and erratic now, its injury fueling a spell of anger. My heart crawled into my throat to hide as its vacant face turned to glare me down, black ichor spilling from its mouth and trailing the floor like a faucet. Angrily, its whole body began a U-turn, and it started gliding through the air toward me.

Much, *much* faster than it was before.

As soon as I knew it had me, I took off running, not bothering to look back over my shoulder. I was practically hopping one leg as the pain of the other one threatened to bring me to the ground should I treat it wrong. Behind me, bursts of crackly, gargled screams chased after me, echoing down the halls and damaging my resolve with every loud whine. There was so much left to run, and it was gaining impossibly fast.

I tried to remind myself what Trevor had once told me; it was a mental game—all a mental game. The issue was, this time it wasn’t. My body ached, my head pounded, and my useless, disease-riddled body just could not push itself fast enough.

I wasn’t necessarily doing this for survival though, and I’d come to terms with that. That was only a bonus if all of this worked out. I rounded the third corner back to the hall that I’d left the others, relieved to see that they were no longer there. At that encouragement, I pushed a little harder and chanced a look back, no longer able to take the suspense.

The beast was only about forty feet behind me, and closing in a couple of those every passing second. Its screaming, cracked face eyed me with pure malice, the black blood leaking across its surface making it all the more haunting to look at. I needed a leg up; anything.

I found it a few feet ahead. Another gurney, this one a simple, small one for ambulances.

I dashed to it, then threw my torso overtop and gave it all my weight, kicking my legs like engine pistons. The wheels whirled to life as they glided across the tile, sending me soaring at a normal running speed. The carpet sections of the funeral home slowed me down an amount that felt uncomfortable compared to the slick tile, but it was still much faster than I’d been limping, and tossing a look back to the snake again, it seemed to be working. I was actually gaining ground.

The monster's long, shifting form became more erratic as it realized its food actually might get away, and it too pushed harder, keeping pace with me. Black goo spattered the wall in its angry thrashes, and as its coils slammed the sheetrock, it put holes and dents in them, something the rig didn’t seem to like.

The whole structure rumbled, unable to take even the little bit of extra instability. Dust began to snow from the ceiling like back at the second rig, and the lights flickered on and off, threatening to give out altogether. I cursed under my breath and pushed harder, drifting the next corner and using my bad leg to stop myself when I nearly slammed into the wall.

It was the home stretch now. Only one more hallway till I was out, granted the exit hadn’t already come and gone in the time I was distracting the beast.

Or if it had even come at all.

If I was wrong about all of this, and the door never reappeared, then I was baiting the monster right back to where my other clones were standing, and I was taking down the whole rig with us inside. My last thoughts as I slipped into the dark innards of the snake behind me would be just how badly I let everyone down.

I tried not to dwell on that thought, but reality gave me a glimpse of it just as I was about to round the next corner. The snake hit a hospital section, burst into another frenzy, then hit the wall too hard for a final time. The building gave a shuddering gasp that dusted more debris on top of me, and the lights cut out, plunging me into utter blackness.

My heartbeat was the only sensation I could feel as my whole body went numb with dread. I had no way of knowing what was in front of me, and no tell other than the screams on how far the beast was behind. All I could do was grit my teeth and continue pushing, trying my best in my head to keep track of how close I was to the turn. If I was wrong, I’d go crashing into the wall beside me and come to a dead stop, a mistake that would leave *me* just as dead.

Unfortunately, I over compensated this thought by drifting too far the other direction, and by the time I heard the gurney scraping the wall on my right, I felt it stop altogether as I slammed into the wall ahead. I was trapped in the corner of the hallway.

When I say I’ve never moved so fast in my life, I mean it. My muscles went numb with an abnormal tingling sensation as I used all of my adrenaline to pivot the gurney away from the corner, plant my feet against the wall, then push off as hard as I could.

It was a funeral section, and I knew because the snake was quiet. I went rocketing away from the corner, relieved to find that I kept on sailing and didn’t find an opposite wall on the other side of the corridor. In the low rumble of the collapsing rig, a thunderous boom shuddered past me as the snake must have lunged into the wall at the location I was mere milliseconds before I pushed away.

With a primal scream, my feet found the floor again and I once again started paddling, although this time, I had a heading. Ahead, I could see the lobby, only a sliver of it. The lights were off there too, but around the corner, I could see a shaft of light beaming in from a door on the wall. The exit. It had to be.

I didn’t even try to look back into the dark this time—it was pointless. I just needed to keep my eyes forward. I spun around into the lobby and hooked my foot into the ground to stop, shoving off once I was angled to the door. I was right; the exit was there, doors pried open by the others and the glowing parking lot beyond shining like a heavenly beacon. But my guts did somersaults when I saw that, like last time, the exit was touching the corner of the wall, just starting its consumption back into the rig.

I let out a pained whimper as I jetted as close as I could, then hopped off the gurney, limping like a madwoman to escape. Somehow the rig seemed to be moving faster in its flow, but maybe it was just adrenaline making it seem that way.

It was that moment that I understood true survival instinct. After everything here that I’d been through—all the times I’d nearly died so far—I’d never felt more like an injured fox being hunted and trying desperately to claw its way back to the safety of its den. Knowing that survival was a guarantee only by my own hands this time.

Behind me, the snake hit the lobby, and the garbled screams sounded again. I looked back one last time to see its muck-covered face lit by the dwindling crack of light, then shoved the head of the gurney toward it as hard as I could. The beast didn’t see it coming, and as it slammed into its already damaged visage, it once again went into a frenzy.

It was slowed, but the ensuing rumble made me stumble, and I fell to my knees. No time to struggle back up, I embraced that fox and scurried on my hands, the door only two feet wide now. Adrenaline lifted me like the wings of an angel as I stumbled like an absolute drunkard in my movement, enough to get to my feet, and take a leap of faith.

I barely threaded the needle of the door, my toe catching it for only a moment before I pulled it through and saw the serpent on the other side go lunging into a solid wall.

At that, my body gave out, and I fell back against the concrete, panting hard and heavy as my breath appeared in wispy white ghosts. My hands and arms trembled, and my heart physically ached from beating so fast. I fell into a fit of coughs, the world a blur around me as my own body cursed me for pushing it so hard. Honestly, as much as I often cursed it back for failing me so terribly in life, I couldn’t help but feel some pride that it was able to carry me through that hell we’d just escaped.

A pair of hands gripping my shoulders snapped me back to, and I felt hot wetness coat my cheeks as I opened my eyes. June sat sobbing above me, and when she saw that I was okay, she lay herself atop me and gave into the despair. I did my best to wrap her back and comfort her trembling body, but I was still in pain, and a whole person’s body weight wasn’t helping. After a moment, I sat up, prompting her to move, but still kept a hand on her shoulder.

“I-I thought you were a goner…” she snickered in relief between sobs.

“I… I’m… Okay…” I huffed, hardly able to speak. She smiled at me in such a genuine way that I couldn’t help but give one back, but then I looked past her, and noticed that Hope, Ann, and the body were nowhere to be seen. “Where… where’s the others?”

June stood and helped me up while explaining, looking off toward the concrete structure where the Kingfisher elevator was, “Ann told me to wait here and see if you made it while she got Hope somewhere safer.”

That immediately didn’t track right in my head. Somewhere safe? We were back out in the abyss, and if anything, the dark tree line was less safe than the rig lot that the last beast wouldn’t even enter. Plus, why wouldn’t she have just taken June with her? They could still see the entrance from where they stood and just come to get me if I made it.

It must not have been more than a minute ahead of me that they escaped, because I could make out Ann with the bed and two bodies standing before the giant metal door, investigating the keypad. I took a step closer, and was ready to tell June “Let’s go”, but then my words caught in my throat at what I saw.

There was a small metallic whir that rang out over the lot, and I saw the metal slabs part, a bright light shining out from within. The elevator. Ann had somehow called it.

At that, I began to limp faster. June held me up and helped me, but my body was so beaten that I could barely keep up all the same. The lot was too vast, and by the time the doors stopped and Ann rolled Hope and the body inside, we were only halfway.

“Ann!” I yelled with a chuckle in my hoarse voice, whatever heard me be damned, “Ann, how did you get the code!?”

We were closer now, close enough for me to see her face when she turned around and pressed a button on the inside. When I did, the smile melted off my lips, and that nagging feeling that something was wrong became fully apparent.

It was cold. It was plain and calculated. It was the same face she’d given me back at the house when she left me with the angel, although this time, she wasn’t giving it to me out of necessity. It was out of guilt.

Guilt and pent up anger.

“Ann… Ann wait!” I called out, “What are you doing?”

She didn’t respond. She didn’t move. She didn’t stick an arm out to hold the door. She just kept her cold, broken eyes on me while the doors began to slide shut.

I hustled faster, then put an arm behind June, shoving her forward, “J-June, stop her!”

June looked at me, confused, then back to the elevator, piecing it all together for herself. She took off running, but we were still too far. June reached the door when there was only a small crack remaining, not enough to stop it without losing a hand, but within, Ann continued to stare past her straight to me, her gaze sharp and unwavering as the door slid shut.

I fell to my knees before the barrier once I reached it, June beside me staring numbly at the surface of the metal. Crawling to the keypad, I racked my brain for the code we had originally been given at the last rig.

*8-8-9-7-5-2*

The pad flashed red.

I tried again, this time with a different combo. Maybe I had misremembered.

The pad flashed red.

I tried again, then again and again. I tried everything I could possibly think of, praying that one of the codes might work. Hope had to have been right, right? The code for up here was never changed? That had to be it, because if it wasn’t, then it meant that Ann had figured it out somehow and…

And she hadn’t told us…

I didn’t want that to be true. I didn’t want to believe that there was a part of myself so bitter and rotten that she would let her anger drive her to leave the rest of us behind. Once I gave up on codes, however, and all I could do was sit there and wait for the elevator to come back up and get us, 5 minutes turned to 10, then that into an hour. June and I waited, staring at the door in disbelief until the revelation finally hit us.

Ann had left us, and she wasn’t planning on coming back.

Somehow, without us, she was planning on being the only one to get out alive.
