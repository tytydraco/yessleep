She was dead. I’d watched them lower her into the ground. And yet  here she was right in front of me. Close enough to touch. Hold. Not cold like before. She was warm. Full of something I didn’t dare call life. 

“Baby,” she said. HER VOICE. Her actual voice. None of the rest of them. Not like Tucker’s rattling glass or Dolores’s flat inflection. This was *her.* 

George stared. Held back by a dozen converted. “Kate, don’t–” 

But I couldn’t look away from her. The way she moved. The way her smile pulled to one side like it was attached to a piece of thread. 

“I missed you so much,” Mom said. She reached for me. I felt her arms wrap around me. And I was a little girl again. Resting my head on her shoulder. My eyes tightened and I began to cry. I didn’t care. “That’s it. That’s my girl. Just let us hold you.” 

I looked up. Past George. High above us -- jutting metallic grey formation catching the dim red light. Galena. Lead ore. The miners called it a silver belly. 

*– the silver belly – where crows turn their back –* 

Mom's notebook. The words that seemed like madness.

Dead birds littered the ground beneath the formation. Decades of them. Skeletons and fresh corpses. All facing away from the galena. Like they'd tried to flee mid flight before dropping. 

A gas pocket. Methane accumulating in this natural silo. The birds had flown in, hit it and died instantly.

The organism didn't breathe. How could it know?

“We can take it away. The guilt. The pain. All of it. We can make you *whole*.”

Suddenly the little girl George had hit at the cemetery moved closer. Her jaw hung on by a tendon. Black fluid seeping from the bone. Inside the wound, I saw them. Those eyes. 

Thousands of them. Moving like a millipede in the dark.

“I’m sorry, Mom.” 

I pushed her away with all my might and lunged. Not at Mom. But at the little girl. 

My palm sank into the wound. The black coated my hand. Burning. Eating into my skin. 

There was no pain. There was only pain. Numbness. Agony. At least this pain had purpose. 

"What are you doing?" Bennett scrambled back. “You’ll–” 

I ran. Straight toward the galena. 

The organism recoiled. I felt it as I entered the dead zone. The heat threads connecting it to the converted stretched. Thinning. People stumbled. Breaking connection. Breaking the hive. 

Mom’s face flickered. Her expression shifted. Confused. Then angry. “Katie, no–” 

I slammed my black-coated ruined hand against the rock.

There was a SPARK. 

I dropped. Covered my head. 

The gas ignited. A blue wall of flame raced across the pocket. A blast of heat rolled over me. The organism's surface blistered. Splitting. Spraying that black from the cracks.   

The sound it (all of them) made wasn’t a scream. It was a frequency. A low vibration. Deep. Like the mountain itself was screaming. It rattled my teeth. I was blind. For a moment. 

When my sight returned. Everyone in the cavern clutched their heads. All at once. 

I crawled to George. Shook him hard. "Wake up. NOW Goddamnit."

He was alive. I pulled him to his feet. Pointed up. "The ventilation shaft. There."

Dad had shown me when I was young. Every mine had them. Cut-outs to let gas escape. Thirty feet up. There it was – a rusted metal grate.

We stumbled. Pushing aside bodies. 

Bennett stayed. Crawling toward the organism. Still begging through broken sobs. 

"Please. I did everything. Take me."

Rock sheared from the ceiling. Crushing his legs. He didn't scream, though. He laughed. One hand on the organism as the mountain came down around him. 

"Finally," he whispered. Then he was gone. 

George boosted me up. I grabbed the grate opening and pulled myself inside. 

"Faster, Kate! Move."

George reached up. I tried to grab him with my good hand. As rock rained down, I pulled him up. We started crawling. Elbow and knees. 

I looked back one last time. Through the dust, I saw Mom below. For a moment, her eyes cleared. Then something pulled her back. Swallowed her. Gone. 

The mountain bellowed again. 

Millions of tons of rock folding in. Sealing all of them inside. 

The shaft angled up. Tight. Dark. Smoke and dust choking us. Still we crawled. Scraped. 

Until we reached rungs. And the light. 

\*\*\*\*\*

We emerged onto concrete landing. New construction. Clean. Some kind of safety retrofit they’d added when they reopened the mine. The "new" entrance. Two miles from the old one that Bennett took us down.

We must have looked like we’d crawled out of hell. Covered in soot. Blood and ash. 

My hand was gone. Not gone. But fucked. The black stuff had eaten through skin and muscle. I could see charred bone. It must have been the shock because I couldn’t feel anything. 

I looked back at the mountain. Smoke rising. A pyre visible for miles. 

George collapsed beside me. Breath shallow.  

"George?"

Nothing. His eyes rolled back.

I tried to stand. Tried to pull him up. My legs gave out. Vertigo. I hit the concrete and lay beside him, staring up at the empty blue sky. 

Then I heard it. A whirring hum. Getting louder. 

A drone descended. It hovered maybe a dozen feet above us. The camera eye adjusting. Focusing. Recording.

"Help," I screamed up at it. “Please. Help us.” 

The drone didn’t respond. It just watched. Steady. Waiting. 

George’s body jerked. Once. Twice. Seizing up. Gas exposure.

I tried to hold him still. The drone moved closer. I could see myself in the lens. Covered in filth and bleeding. 

For a split second, I thought: *This would get millions of views.* 

God help me. I kept my good hand on George's chest. Felt it rise and fall. Rise. Fall. Again. And again. And again. 

The drone just hovered. Adjusting its angle. Documenting. 

“HELP!” I screamed at the drone. “FUCKING HELP US!” 

Then I heard voices. By then, he'd stopped breathing. 

"Over here! I got eyes on them."

First responders in full hazmat suits. Military. They’d been waiting. How long, I don’t know. 

Hands grabbed me. Pulled me away from George. They strapped me to a gurney. An isolation stretcher. Plastic over my face. I could see through. Barely. I saw them work on George. 

The drone followed as they loaded me into an armored Humvee. It’s eye still recording. 

"Where are you taking him?" My voice muffled in the tube. 

No one answered.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke in a room with no windows. The air tasted sterile.

I tried to sit up. My right hand was wrapped in gauze.

"Don't." Said a woman in a hazmat suit. CDC badge visible through the face shield.

"Where am I?"

"Safe. But quarantined. For now."

"And my husband?"

She shook her head. 

I felt nothing. I was used to losing things by now. 

"How long have I been here?"

"Five days. We had to sedate you. Clean up the hand. And the rest."

She didn’t offer to elaborate on what exactly that meant. 

"And the town? My mother?"

She looked away. That was answer enough. 

They kept me for three weeks. Tests. Scans. Blood work. Psych evals.

I told the truth. 

They gave me a different one. A version of events. Trauma. Gas leak. Hallucinations.

"Losing a mother and husband can manifest in complex delusions," the psychiatrist said.

I nodded. Played along. There was no point evading. 

They showed me documents. Official statements from “the mining company” about a methane explosion. Tragic accident. Structural failure. The government expressed condolences. Same language as “the mining company” and all those old reports. Different decade. Same lies.

They gave me papers to sign. NDAs. Legal releases. Liability waivers. Who knows. I lost count. 

I skimmed pages of dense text until one phrase stopped me cold: 

>*...the incident contained at the Gatenville site pending investigation of additional extraction locations...*

Additional extraction locations.

I looked up at the lawyer. "What does this mean?"

"Standard language. Formality."

I wanted to demand answers. But they'd already decided the truth. And I'd already agreed to silence for a settlement check with seven zeroes. I imagine it was that or an unmarked grave. 

So, I signed. My new name. The one I can’t tell you.  

\*\*\*\*\*

Six months have passed. I'm living in Carmel. Alone. 

I own a small furniture shop. Estate sale finds mostly. Things I can restore with my good hand. The amputation and scarring nearly reaches my elbow. I mark it with a pen every week. Just to make sure it's not growing. The good news is… it’s not. 

I live in a one-bedroom with a view of the Pacific. No phone. No internet. 

My 800,000 followers – abandoned. All those carefully curated posts gathering digital dust.

>*“Where are you, Kate!?”*

>*“Miss your content!”*

>*“I need help with a breakfast nook. Are you alright? ”*

No. I’m not. But I’m here. This my life now. I mostly keep to myself. I sit on benches and read books. And when I’m not, I watch people. Their eyes. How they move and breathe.

Last Tuesday, a letter appeared under my door. No postmark. Just my name in handwriting I instantly recognized.

>*Kate,* 

>*We miss you.*

>*One day you'll come home again.*

>*Because everyone gets tired of being alone.*

>*Your mother sends her love. So do I.*

I burned it over the sink. Watched it curl into itself and disappear. 

Didn't sleep that night.

In the morning, fog came in thick over the shore. I noticed a man walking his dog down below. He stopped and looked up at my window. 

The dog barked. Pulling at the leash. Flaring teeth. 

But the man just stood there. Staring up at me. 

Then he shook his head. Snapping out of it. The dog calmed and they just walked on.

Maybe it was nothing.

But I'm thinking about moving. Further away. Some island maybe.

Because I know they'll find me eventually. 

How long do I have? Days. Months. Years.

George was right. Everyone gets tired of being alone.

I'm just not tired enough.

Yet.
