\*\*\*

I thought I could stay away. I've always vastly overestimated my own willpower.

\*\*\*

I made my mind up. Determined to leave the package on the front stoop. Maybe one of those people who steal packages from porches would take it. Relieve me of this burden.

So I curled up under my weighted blanket and slept. Dreams of Gen, as always. I can feel her gentle touch when I'm in that liminal space between awakeness and sleep. So real.

The banging  sounded like gunshots. Still in the haze of dream, I wondered if this was the end. If I could go gently into that good night.

Then it happened again, four sharp quick sounds punctuating the pre dawn. The door knocker.

Only one person in my life would knock like that. Arrogant, assuming, as if everyone's property belongs to him. The scorn of suburbia; the HOA president.

The door creaked open, lodging it's complaint for me.  Brendan stood there, Milly in his arms.

"We have leash laws." He held Milly out. She wagged her tail. I almost kept quiet. What willpower?

"She was in the yard." Internally he stiffened up. Not used to being challenged. He picked up the package and handed it to me.

"This has been here a week. That's an appearance violation, incurring a $500 charge. You'll see it on your next bill."

He crossed his arms and walked off with an audible sigh.

I shut the door. Milly l looked at me.

His wife had always been very affectionate around me. At neighborhood parties, she would lean in a little too far during my stories. Laugh a little too loud. I'm not THAT funny.

I pulled up the youtube page. The video. Before I knew it, I had forwarded her the link. "A project I'm working on. What do you think?"

I'd like to say I hesitated before I hit send. I didn't.

Later I was woken up by some commotion. I went to the door, where I could see Brendan's front door. He was stumbling out, just in his boxers.

Sarah was watching him from the doorframe, a mug in her hand.

I opened the door. Brendan stumbled closer. His eyes opaque, blood streaming from his nose. He reached my yard and fell down. Mouth foaming.

Realization set in that I had maybe done this. The blanket felt suffocating. Before I could at least claim ignorance. But this... was deliberate.

His eyes stared at me as his breath caught in his throat.

"She put it... in... my coffee." His chest heaved one last time, then the life left his body.

I looked over at Sarah. She lifted the cup in my direction, then drained the contents with a grimace. Empty. She smiled at me, then walked to the end of the driveway and sat.

It hit me. She was sitting there, waiting to die in the same horrendous way she had just watched Brendan die.

I ran inside, head spinning, trying to catch my breath. Sat down on the edge of the bed. Looked over. Milly had gotten to the package, had torn it open. The pages spread across the floor.

As I picked them up, my eye caught the first image. Immediately I was hooked. I could see it in my mind. I shuffled through them, the images becoming clearer.

When it got to the last page, there was just a sentence written.

WATCH THE FILM

For a moment, I struggled to figure out what was being said. Then I realized I had never watched the first video. Yes, I had filmed it. Edited it. But I somehow just knew when each part was complete. Like the tumblers on a lock falling into place.

I had never watched it in it's entirety.

People had tried to remove it. Other people fought this, claiming freedom of speech. Claiming there's no reason why these images should provoke this reaction.

I knew, though. It activated our deepest, hidden impulses. The ones from our time in the jungles, when it was kill or be killed. The desires Stalin had as he sent his friends to the Gulag. The reason horror films thrill us.

That area that modern society has pushed down deep, for comfort and convenience.

And to make this next film, I'd need that part fully alive. Not buried beneath a blanket, hiding from life.

Looking at the monitor, I was an equal mix of apprehension and anticipation. A live wire, brimming with electricty.

I hesitated before pressing play.

That hunger still gnawed at me. Something in the deep recesses of my subconscious told me to stop. That this hunger would just grow and grow, never satiated.

But I never felt so alive.

I knew it wouldn't kill me. Somehow I knew the effect on me would be much, much worse. For the world, humanity in general. Assuming humanity as we know it survived this. 

My hand reached out, almost of it's own accord, and pressed the button.
