My life is full of irony. In fact, the extent is so great, you probably wouldn't believe me if I told you. There are things out there certain people don't want you to know so I'm taking a risk being the one to reveal this information. They're the same people who took my work and buried it deep within the layers of the internet so it is lost even to me. 

It's funny, because although my expertise is apparently good enough to get me into this mess, they're not nearly good enough to find whatever secret Satan gloryhole those people threw my work into.
I can't let my work go dark, I can't let me go dark, so I'm leaving this here; where the truth is buried deep within a story; where only those who seek answers will find them. Therefore, if I don't eventually witness the fruit of my labour- somebody else will. 

Let me introduce myself;
I'm a biological researcher. 
I study systems of life and their moving parts in my own time, applying them experimentally to expand the knowledge I have of the human body and what makes us, as well as the potential of other life-forms and the discovery of new species.

I became interested in this career path after gaining a Doctorate in Human Psychology and a Masters in Applied Medicine during my time at University. I learnt a lot during my time there and made many friends, however, it was short lived. I became reclusive in order to focus on my goals and experiments, and through this, I gained a kind of fulfilment I could never find in others- and I didn't know if I was better off for it. 

Now, I don't really work for anyone but myself; excluding what's government funded, and about half of all of my business is done with my own interests in mind and on my terms, aside from situations like these. Most of my work isn't exactly conventional either- and a lot of it is based in theory, in fact one of the times I did collaborate with others scientifically, was back in the 80s, when I was young and restless in scientific spirit. We theorised that the human brain could access and observe higher dimensions through a process we called 'Hemisphere Synchronization' and therefore unlock the ability to 'Remote View' positions miles away whilst remaining in the original location.

We called it "The Gateway Experiment" and we understood this would revolutionise war and espionage because by having our soldiers transcend time and space itself, they would be able to see anything anywhere, potentially across all of time. Our calculations showed us how possible this was; I remember standing proudly amongst my fellow colleagues, staring in amazement at the beautiful and complicated numbers, letters and symbols that danced gracefully across the board as if they were equations in ballgowns.

We ran tests to both prove possibility, and observe to what degree this ability was useful to us, whilst our subjects successfully returned information only a controlled group of lead scientists knew about. Some of it was corrupted, and yet it was still enough to prove they had indeed phased through a wall somewhere out in the boonies, however not enough of what they brought back was to be considered reliable during times of war. We theorised this consistent inconsistence was because the 4th dimension caused a flip in the layout of the information; like a mirror almost, and therefore scrambled the writing.

Not only that, but the way they would receive information was cryptic and questionable. For example- if they wanted to receive advice from their now free-flowing brain, their answer would come in symbols and colours; and so we experimented with this as well, and information had never been harder to interpret. Of course they managed to decipher it- leading to a sort of personal omniscience, but it definitely came with drawbacks.

However, contrary to popular belief, reasons like these wasn't why we canned it, you see. Transcending time and space does things to some people- ones who can't handle themselves since they can't seem to turn it off; the flashing lights, the racing, booming, download-like thoughts, the sensations, the deprivation of physical feeling. 

They go insane from their brain frying itself like an egg being cooked in the desert and then they slowly die as their brain decides it no longer wishes to function.

So yeah, we took THAT patent, along with photos and arguably cursed, yet apparently "realistic depictions" of what those with "brain-fry" saw (which happened to include the fourth dimension drawn as best it could have on 2 dimensional sheets, all stapled and boxed together like some awful, mind-bending 3D jigsaw), and shoved it on some obscure website buried as far as it will go. 
Nobody really knows how to get there- except those with 'exempt permissions', which most certainly does not include some self serving independent researcher like myself. This is a corner of the internet I've heard many stories and rumours of, and it's about the last place on earth I want to visit; I don't know if what I've heard is true but I do know it's real, and I also know that must be where they put my damn work.

Now of course if you've been anywhere near the internet, you probably know of this experiment. They realised information of this nature has the inclination to... leak, and so they resolved this by finding common grounds with the force of curiosity and realised most of it was better off out there if they left out the sticky parts. So they had one of their guys dig it back up and fix the patent. 

This also came about after the Freedom of Information Act, and now they have two versions; the successful experiment and the one that went horribly wrong. Of course you probably didn't know they do this which makes it easier for them to explain madness with mental illness when it turns out it's your fault in the first place.

I'm getting off track here, where was I? Oh yes; I work occasionally for the government- I won't specify which one, I hope you understand. My work focuses on human biology, the mechanics of life and the unknown- I experiment with and on my findings, even having a few impressive ventures under my belt. 
If you thought Hemisphere Synchronization was cool, you'd love to take a look at the man with one thousand legs I autopsied called Milly, but don't get too excited; his 'legs' were essentially tiny thumbs littering his body like saggy nipples- he couldnt have used them for anything.

It turns out he was in the Fourth Stage of Malignant Breast Cancer.

For some reason he had developed breasts all over his body and they wanted me to find out why. He was an abnormality; a freak,it was a genetic instability which hindered the body's natural mutagenic capabilities. The poor man also had five times the normal oestrogen levels coursing through his veins; a perfect storm. 

I also experimented on a nuclear radiated pineapple- where the cells had differentiated out of plant mode, but didn't quite fit into an animal class, creating a new species of being. We called this the "intervitrum fructus" or 'Fruit between lives' and it's still in my lab, sitting in a lead box. It doesn't do anything or eat anything, or even rot- it's like a self sustaining being; fascinating, easy to care for and ripe with potential. I'm still running tests but I think it could even be sentient...

Now, this entire situation began after I uploaded an essay on the senescence of adult human cells and the pathology of ageing- dubbed 
"The Hayflick limit- a race against the clock". 

If you're not familiar with the Hayflick Limit, it's the proposed number of times a cell can divide before it is unable to divide anymore. During this process telomeres, the caps on the end of the genetic material we call DNA cannot replicate and so the ends become shorter- eventually killing the cell. The problem is that these caps are essential to preventing strand damage similar to the covers on the ends of shoelaces, and without the expression of the telomerase enzyme, which elongates the caps, the cells will die; eventually causing total arrest, or death for short. 

This unresolved problem has led many biologists, and the occasional philosopher, down that old road many have walked for centuries- and nobody has succeeded yet. The Hayflick Limit is partly the reason we age and die- or at least it's closely connected to it. Many of us believe it's a combination of complex external and internal factors, as well as mechanisms which power the ageing process, and not just one reason alone.

Leach's Storm Petrel is a perfect example of this, because their telomeres actually grow longer with age instead of shorter; it's a phenomenon that I've not seen occurring anywhere else in nature.

During this period of my life, I had an Angelfire website where I wrote blogs in order to store and share my work; this allowed other independent researchers and biologists (including myself) to contribute to the wider community, where we could all grow together in the subject field we were collectively passionate about- I called my website thefisherfiles.com.

Angelfire was a site active in the early 2000's and late 90's which hosted individual platforms- similar to Weebly or SquareSite. My platform sometimes recieved messages or comments from individuals looking to meet up and partner, the occasional obvious scam and sometimes college students needing help studying, which allowed me to make a little extra cash on the side. I wouldn't say I was popular by any means, but my ideas and trials were obscure and interesting enough to garner some attention at least.

It was a Saturday and late into the evening; I had just posted my essay and had began to settle down in front of the television, when I heard the familiar chime of my Windows Computer, signalling I had recieved a message. I flipped it open to see that somebody had left a comment, which judging by the layout of the notification wasn't somebody I recognised. They weren't a regular.

I raised a brow in surprise; it was dreadfully early and most normal people didn't read science essays shit o clock in the morning.
"Hm, strange- maybe it's spam. No, no couldn't be; I have a spam blocker",
I thought to myself, feeling a weird flick of something I didn't quite recognise, however it was so short lived that I almost didn't catch it.

I took a sip of the tea I had made earlier- it was still hot, and burnt my mouth a little on the way down. Outside, it was dark and raining somewhat heavily, triggering my brain to produce melatonin; causing me to feel sleepy and in need of rest. I didn't really want to check this now but I knew it would bother me until the morning, so I reluctantly clicked on the comment, expecting it to be some college student asking me to review their work or something, before whoever their science teacher was gave them a detention for rushed or unfinished work. 
I got a lot of those.

I blinked.
'Check your email' it read.

I looked at the username and frowned; it was some weird fucking shit- a bunch of numbers and letters, and it made me worry I'd been sent a virus. I almost didn't want to see what they had sent me, but when I went to open it, I didn't expect to see a real address in the 'new messages' section. I eyed it warily before I opened it because the email seemed disguised, however I had enough experience with identifying the difference between disguised and spam mail; the latter being literally just letters and numbers, and the former being a real email just with a site name in it somewhere- often in the '@' section.

I looked outside, it was pitch black now- darker than it had been before; and so I checked the watch on my right wrist; it's strap was cyan blue with cartoonish pink cats printed randomly over it, and the dial confidently read 3:56am. 
Jesus, who in the hell was up at this hour, sending random people mail? I groaned before realising I was also up in the middle of the night, reading random mail. 
Well, more like A random, singular really. Begrudgingly I clicked on it, my screen beginning to hurt my eyes slightly- causing me to adjust the brightness accordingly.

"Dear Mr Fisher,

Firstly I would like to formally apologise for contacting you this late in the evening. I have decided to reach out because the organisation of which I work for, has been following your work for quite some time now, and I understand you are already familiar with them.

We are avidly impressed at your innovation, initiative and overall willingness to explore and push the boundaries of what we already know, whilst remaing professional and sensible. This alone checks many boxes required for you to be considered as a valid candidate."

Candidate for what? What on earth was this guy talking about? This message had completely taken me off guard and freaked me out slightly, I honestly thought this may have been some stupid prank by some troll on the internet- but the professional tone of the entire thing unnerved me. I considered not reading any further, however curiousity got the better of me and I continued reading.

It was also clear this was no prank as there were very few groups I found 'familiar' and happened to be large enough to call an 'organisation'. 
God damn it- it was 3:56 in the bloody morning, although if this was heading where I thought it was, these guys were up 24/7 scouting, planning, theorising and surveiling. They were a determined bunch that's for sure.

"This organisation has been searching for capable hands and minds to aid in making our dreams a reality, and after much deliberation we would like to offer you the once in a lifetime opportunity to work alongside some of the greatest minds of the 21st century, and we wholeheartedly believe you will be an asset to our most exciting project yet.

As you most likely already know, our organisation is government funded and regularly performs approved trials, facilitating the strange, wonderful and borderline miraculous. 
Unfortunately I am unable to divulge much detail due to the sensitive nature of this information, however if you are interested, we can discuss our collaboration further over the phone. Details may be shared then.

You will be generously compensated for your contributions and all travel costs will be covered.

Please decide within the next 72 hours of reception of this message. 
I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks,

Head Scientist

Dr John F. Clair."

Oh for goodness sakes!

Jonathan Ferguson Clair was one of the lead scientists I had worked with back in the 80s whilst we were still researching the potential of the human mind. What were the chances they made this guy in charge of the operation? Whilst he had realised some impressive work; including a device which allowed you to teleport and a training system which allowed your physical body to travel directly through walls, I would never have guessed him the managerial type.

Now another thing you probably didn't know, was that government funders don't just pick from a pool of preselected 'victims' all of the time, they often have leading men and women who will return for every other trial in order to direct and plan as a team due to their experience. If you were continually picked or maintained a contract with the parties who were interested in what you were doing, you had a higher likelihood of being made one in the future. This was also true for those who 
A) had an individual work contract with a sector of the government itself in relation to the experiment.
And
B) had first hand experience in the subject matter.

I, of course, ticked both of those boxes- but because of the delicate nature of such information, they liked to be unnecessarily difficult about the process. You were never placed at an office, you didn't have any form of contact directly associated with your employer (such as a work phone or email) and they held no records of you unless it was on a backlog. This was often deleted after each interaction and so I have no clue how they even keep track of everyone who's ever worked there. Although I have a feeling they probably do have something that counts for this- but if they do, it's not like I would know about it. Maybe the contractors hold your information and that's kept separate from the actual government sector you work with? I really wouldn't know.

I instinctively thought back to the last time I had spoken to him and how horribly wrong those experiments had gone. Many of those in our team had cut themselves off from everything remotely involved with their line of work, from the guilt of practically ruining a handful of lives. Me, him and a few others stayed behind to finish our work with the successful patients and then afterwards all who were involved signed NDAs which I'm of course breaking now. 

I shivered a little bit. I certainly didn't like thinking about the bad eggs of the group that cracked, their guttural, terrible, constant 'noises' as their minds practically collapsed  under the weight of its own function and potential- with absolutely no way to slow it down. We tried sedating them but that only made it worse. Some of them endured like that for days, until they eventually snuffed themselves out and died of exhaustion. Once a roaring fire- now just smoke and ash...

I considered this for a few moments but the idea of adventure awaited, and just imagining another challenge and the opportunity for a well funded trial instead of the small ones I did in my free time was honestly quite enticing. John was an interesting man and I had never heard him to partake in anything boring- he was quite popular back in the day; known as an eccentric genius and liked to explore the stories of the world- wether they had validity or if they were unachievable. 
He believed wholeheartedly that myths and legends existed for a reason and he had to know what they were based on. Not to mention- he loved his country and knew he could aid greatly in it's defense with the potential his inventions held, with many officials agreeing, so he was always finding ways to improve our defenses and militia. That was 20 years ago, though. 

That's how he even got hired by the CIA in the first place.
One of his most widely used items was a specifically designed DNA Ariel which was able to communicate with other dimensions or versions of a person- and he combined this with a TV that could pick up any signal and broadcast it's original location by re-creating the spherical matrix of the brain.

He got the idea from the previously mentioned experiment. However, when combined with a Hemisync Subject, it showed exactly what they saw- it was a little hard to comprehend but now they use the device for space exploration missions and studying bodies such as black holes and stars, incomprehensible distances away, by picking up on the signals they transmit across space and time. This is without the need to even send the device anywhere, by the way. 

It was so useful in fact, that they harnessed it's ability to transmute signals into pictures, and then wired up suspected threats, such as terrorists or believed spies which allowed them to view memories, resolving the need for interrogation, which sucked royally for the enemy if you ask me. 

This filled my scientific side with excitement and my mortal side with dread; I didn't know what he was working on but I had a feeling deep down, this was going to be either the best or the worst experience of my entire life.

I started typing a little too quickly;

"To Dr John F. Clair,

Thank you for your message.

Judging by your writing, you remember me as well as I remember you; I am at a surprise to be in contact once again and I hope you are doing well.
Please do not worry about the timing- as I often do not sleep until the late morning and so I was not disturbed from rest by your message.

I agree that I may have had contact with this organisation in the past although not all of my memories are fond, I am glad the ones you speak of like my work and although the unfortunate results of our endeavours two decades ago are still fresh in my mind, I am scientifically curious and eager for a challenge, as well as the opportunity to build on what we already know. 

I understand why I have been chosen as a candidate and I am therefore pleased to indulge their offer.
It was good hearing from you again after all this time and I look forward to working with you and many other wonderful minds of the 21st century. 

Sincerely,

Mr Adrian Fisher.

07938 369 771"

I added my number in as an afterthought.

It took a few days for John to get back to me. He had taken the liberty of using the number I had provided at the end of my email and called me at some time between 12 and 3 in the afternoon come Monday.

I was in the middle of observing, recording and relaying the effect of radiation on the Pineapple which had somehow grown an entire nervous system within the span of 6 months, when my Nokia recieved three very loud buzzes which rung out in the empty room like a quiet jack hammer.

I almost jumped out of my skin. Fumbling around for the source of the noise, in the moment being reminded of who may be attempting to reach me, my reaction became more urgent- and I found myself concerned they would hang up before I managed to get there in time. I finally got my hands on the damn phone, and after catching my breath, I answered the call.

I hesitated.

"Er... He-hello-?"

Pause.

"He-"

"Hi, yes, could I speak to Mr Fisher please?"

The voice was cool, smooth and practically oozed confidence. He didn't sound how I remembered exactly, as there was a hint of age that was noticeable even through the phone, however I could still tell it was the same John I met all those years ago.

"Speaking."

"Firstly I'd like to say how pleased I am that you've shown an interest in this project we're working on. I definitely remember the last time I spoke to you- I believe it was 20 odd years ago- and although I can't say I'm not surprised to talk with you once again, I can certainly say that, from what I remember, you certainly are a good choice."

I was flattered- I didn't know what to say, so I kept quiet; John paused briefly, then continued.

"I'm going to assume you'd like to know where this will all take place- and as mentioned in the email; your travel costs, ALL of them, WILL be accounted for on our behalf. The people who want this done, want it done badly and they're putting a lot of money into this. I cannot give you the location exactly but I can give you directions; if you do decide to go through with this, they will be delivered to your house so there's no trail, you should destroy it afterwards. Are you with me so far, Adrien?"

I nodded, before realising he couldn't see me.

"Erm yes, that makes sense- you don't want the location compromised after all. Hey- so what exactly is this project? It sounds exciting, especially since you're leading it this time. Knowing you, I bet it's something like an AI with a soul or something crazy like that." 

I spoke as if it was a joke, but in reality, it was entirely within the realm of possibility that this guy would end up being responsible for some kind of apocalypse.

I hoped I wasn't getting myself into anything 'too crazy' and for a scientist like me, too crazy was akin to traversing spacetime and jumping into a black hole, the size of my thumb, just to see what it felt like to experience cosmic spaghettification, or jumping fully nude into a Hippo pool just to see what it felt like to experience earthly spaghettification.

He chuckled at that last comment.

"No, although we actually do have somebody working on that*. Our project is more on the side of what YOU like to study. Which is partly why you were even chosen in the first place; I wasn't kidding when I said they had been following your work for a while, and when they asked me for a reference I told them you breathed a new life into Hemisync that even I could not. It's quite ironic how you were actually writing about the foundation of our current cause as well- and until now you had no clue how valuable your work was to us."

I wrinkled my nose. 

"Like what? Are you guys working on the cure for cancer or something?"

He snorted. 

"No, we figured that one out ten years ago."

Now it was my turn to laugh. 

All of a sudden, his tone became serious- I could sense this sudden electric energy almost emanating out of the phone; it felt like the kind of vibration you would imagine a lion to have before it takes it's prey down, or a snake before it strikes. I immediately felt uneasy for what must have been the fifth time today.

"We've found it."

"Found what, John?"

"We have found the cure."

Why did he have to say it like that? So earnest and intense, so violently; like he had just shot and killed somebody. As if those words had left his lips the same way a bullet does out of a gun- their listeners' final moments alive spent digesting the meaning of that phrase.

I was treading a little more cautiously now;

"What the fuck are you talking about? What cure for what illness?"

John seemed to sense I was uneasy but he could also tell that large part of me, the chunk that got me up in the morning, the piece of me that lived for possibilities and new truths was practically wagging its tail.

"Look, this thing has got a lot of history to it, and frankly I could bore you to death with it, but we're not historians, we're scientists. All you need to know is that we think this thing could potentially stop or even reverse aging and heal all natural illnesses a person could get in their old age; so that means no Dementia for Granny."

Now obviously he wasn't joking but it sure felt like it.  

"So let me get this straight, you think you've found a cure for old age and therefore all illnesses that go with it." I stated incredulously, this was pretty big and indeed right down my alley. I wish now that it wasn't however, because maybe then I would not be in this mess.

"No, no..." 

I could hear him practically on the edge of his seat and I couldn't help but feel the anticipation of the moment as well.

"We think we've found a cure for all illnesses of old age and therefore the old age that goes with it." 

He didn't pause there;

"All I'm able to tell you right here is that Old Wrinkly next-door is a function of age related illnesses and not the other way around, which is what is commonly believed. If you come and work for us, your name will go down in history as one of 'the people who healed the world'. Isn't that what most prestigious and ambitious men like yourself spend their entire life searching for?"

I felt short of breath, my palms sweaty, and like somebody was prickling my spine with ice needles. This was huge, in fact so much so that I was acutely aware how this was a marker of history; we could change the course of the entire human race! People could work towards a future instead of a retirement plan, they would have hope, and hope was a powerful thing.

I didn't need to think it over. This was indeed a once in a lifetime opportunity, as advertised, and I was going. John gave me a list of what I would need to bring with me and left me with a strange and cryptic phrase before hanging up;

"Don't miss the Train, it will stop at your station and then embark onwards to Nowhere. That is where you get off, do not go any further." 

I remember the way those words creeped me out, but before I could ask anymore, the line clicked.

Well, that about sums up the first part of my story. We have quite a way to go dear reader, so I'll try to keep you all posted regularly, I hope they don't find this in the meantime.

May we speak soon.
