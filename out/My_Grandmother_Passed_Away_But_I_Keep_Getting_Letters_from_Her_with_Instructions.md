When my grandmother passed away, I thought that was the end of it. She’d lived a quiet life in her little cottage by the woods. But two weeks after her funeral, a letter arrived for me, with her familiar handwriting on the envelope. My name.

I almost didn’t open it. I mean, what could it be? A forgotten note? But curiosity got the best of me, so I slid open the envelope and unfolded the paper.

*"Dear Emily,*

*Do not open your windows tonight. Trust me. Love, Grandma."*

It was odd, to say the least. But I thought of her fondly and decided to humor her last words. That night, I left all the windows shut, and I slept peacefully, feeling silly for having taken her note seriously.

The next morning, another letter arrived. Same handwriting, same careful pen strokes.

*"Dear Emily,*

*If you hear three knocks on your door tonight, do not answer them. Stay away from the door until it is silent.*

*Love, Grandma."*

That night, I stayed up late, unable to ignore the growing sense of dread. It was past midnight when I heard it - a faint knock on the front door. Three knocks. My heart stopped, but I forced myself to follow her instructions. I stayed perfectly still listening to my pulse pound in my ears until the knocking finally stopped. I never saw who, or what it was.

The next few days, the letters kept coming, each with stranger instructions.

*"Do not look in any mirrors tonight."*

*"Place a bowl of salt under your bed before you sleep."*

*"Leave a glass of water in the hallway overnight."*

At first, I followed her instructions out of respect for her memory, but soon, fear took over. Each letter arrived with an unnerving accuracy, almost as if she knew I would hesitate. When I considered ignoring one of them, a chill would sweep over me, like an invisible hand pressing down on my shoulders.

But after a couple of weeks, I was exhausted. Her latest letter told me not to turn on any lights after 11 p.m. It seemed so ridiculous, and I was too tired to care. I didn’t want to sit in the dark, creeping myself out. So that night, I turned on my bedside lamp as I went to sleep.

I woke up to whispers in the darkness. Low, murmuring voices filled the room. I sat up with my heart racing, and glanced around but there was no one there.

When I looked back at the nightstand, the lamp was off. I tried turning it on, but it wouldn’t work. The room was dead silent again. No more whispers. No light.

The next morning, a new letter awaited me on the kitchen table.

*"Emily,"* it read. *"You missed an instruction. You must finish what you started, or they’ll come closer tonight."*

I felt a shiver slide down my spine. That night, I did everything the letter told me to do: locked every door, lined the windows with salt, and turned off all the lights. 

But I still felt them, lingering around me. I'd catch movement from the corner of my eye, only to find nothing there. And things in my house... they'd change. A book on the coffee table would be face-down when I swear I'd left it face-up. My keys would be on the kitchen counter instead of the hook where I always put them. Each night it got worse, and I started doubting my own mind.

The letters became more frequent, more demanding. It was like some force was watching me, testing me, waiting for me to slip up again. The only thing that seemed to keep it at bay was following each instruction exactly.

The final letter came on a night when I was too exhausted to resist. It simply said, ***"Come to the attic."***

I stood frozen at the foot of the attic stairs, staring up into the darkness. I didn’t want to go, every instinct in my body screaming at me to turn back. But I couldn’t resist.

In the attic, there was one last note lying in the center of the floor. I picked it up. 

It read:

*"You missed too many instructions, Emily. Now, you will join me in giving them."*

As I looked up, a figure stood in the shadows, her eyes hollow, her face pale. My grandmother - watching me with empty eyes.

I felt my own voice die in my throat as I realized… **my letters had only just begun.**
