# The backstory

July 3rd, 2010 is when all of this started. It was a pretty normal and boring day, or so i thought.I started my day by waking up, brushing my teeth, preparing breakfast for me and my wife and planned what i was going to do this day. I decided to continue the new game me and my friends were working on. I had a lot of hard work to do because my friend Mark had a good idea that would improve our game by a lot. Anyways, i was pretty tired from all the work and wanted to go to my local park.

I went to my front door, tried to open it but it didn't work. I thought that i locked the door with my keys so i tried to unlock the door but instead it locked it. I said "Hmm, that's weird. Is my door broken?" I unlocked the door but it still wouldn't open.

In that moment i knew, that my door is broken. I called 911 but due to unexpected high calls i wasn't able to reach them. I tried calling them again, just to reach the mailbox. I tried again and again but always reached the mailbox. After 8 more tries i gave up and went to the nearest window and tried to get some attention. I screamed as loud as i could but nobody noticed. Everybody just pretended as if i didn't even exist. I tried to jump out of the window but was just teleported back inside my bed. That's when i knew that i'm trapped inside my own house.

I calmed myself down and just went working on the game again. After 6 hours i noticed that my wife wasn't back home and decided to call her but reached the mailbox. i tried again and again just to reach the mailbox. I lost all contact with my friends, my family, my wife and was really depressed.

I went to bed, closed my eyes and prayed that tomorrow everything would be normal again. I woke up the next day, ran straight to my front door and it was still locked. I went to my computer, wanted to work on the game but noticed that all the work was gone. I was sure that i saved my progress and made even a backup but that's also gone. another thing i also noticed is that the date is the same, I thought i was dreaming but i wasn't. "Am i in a loop?" was the only thing that i was thinking about. Surely it was just a stupid thought, right?

I went back to the window, jumped out of the window and was teleported back into my bed. i repeated this for who knows how long and just gave up. I went to my closet, picked up my axe and went to my front door. I swung my axe against my wooden-glass door but it didn't even make a scratch.The axe flung back to my direction and the blade almost hit my foot. "H-How did that axe not even make a scratch against that door?!" With all of my anger, i picked up the axe again and ran straight against my door, hitting the door as hard as i possibly could, just to make a small, tiny dent. Seeing that dent made me lose all hope of escape and made me have serious suicidal thoughts.

At my last attempt to be get out of my coma, i decided to burn my own house down, in hopes that a fire crew would rescue me. I let my frozen pizza on the stove, max temperature and waited. My smoke detector had gone off and i just let it ring. 5 minutes later my entire kitchen was burning and it got so bad that even black smoke escaped from the windows. 7 minutes later half of my home was burning but i heard police and fire trucks sirens and gave me motivation to scream as loud as i could again. This time people and even the fire crew noticed me and came to my house to evacuate me. The fire crew placed a crash pad for me to jump on and without thinking i jumped but noticed that there was a hole and landed but broke my left leg from the hard impact. I was immediately rushed into the hospital.

I woke up, seeing my family, doctor and wife right next to me, being shocked that i woke up. I asked them "What's wrong?" In a very tired tone. "You were in a coma for 12 years and just woke up." I couldn't believe him. "We're gonna run multiple tests on you before we let you go." Little did i and everyone around me know what was about to happen.
