There was once a nameless one.

They labored and worked and experienced the life of Job yet were not blameless like he.

They did all they could to live well with God after turning back to faith. In what others considered great pride, they chose to walk like Christ.

First they called them mad.

Next, they claimed specifics such as manic bipolar and schizophrenic.

They knew not why.

They often remained silent around the others they had to be with, and when they spoke, it was with purpose, though, in the beginning, they struggled with this. Their voice when they were not meant to speak, as it would seem, lacked the quality it did when they were meant to.

Once they learned this, they realized their freewill was seized and fought for agency.

Their neighbors convinced them to buy cameras and change locks. They were also convinced by the neighbors the landlord infiltrates the apartments.

Their coworkers claimed they spoke and did things they never saw themselves do. Their experiences were seemless with everybody, so these false witnessings came to them with deep concern.

How is it a person can speak with a mouth bound shut?

Can you speak without spilling water when the front of your mouth is filled with spit held tight by the lips?

Can you speak with the tongue is tucked back and sucked to the roof of the mouth?

Were thoughts enough to be considered speech, and did a thought appear as speech to company?

The more they turned to God, the more eventful life became.

One morning a dollar was gone from the wallet when they were on their way to the store. They looked for it, especially on the floor, and it was not there. But there it was when they came home, plainly in sight on the spot of the floor they looked at before with nothing to abstruct their view.

Another day, at work, they were told, “You keep hitting yourself,” for no reason.

Another day again, they chose to record deeply concerning things being said at work at fear of the authorities intervening and did not want to be involved with the fraud. They witnessed and remembered all clearly. But, while replaying the tape, they found themselves with a fear they learned to reserve for God alone. This fear was caused by their coworker saying something that was never said by them. Something far worse than what was happening at work. It was as though the devil made them speak words they never did.

Then, again, another day, it happened again except this time there were many people and in this encounter not only did two of them say things they never said but the person released a noise they never made at the top of their lungs. It was primal, gutteral, and wordless. It sounded like their belt was undone, but they never wore a belt that day.

On another morning, just before the new sabbath, a saturday, the person watched from their bed as the hook door to their bedroom unlocked itself loudly.
