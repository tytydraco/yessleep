I woke up in puzzlement as my daughter jumped onto my bed. I vaguely heard screams, and rubbed off my sleepiness onto my alarm-it was 4:27 AM. I rubbed my eyes and asked her, "What's going on?"



She stared at me with wide eyes and said, "Mommy's different."



"Different how?" I returned, still not awake.



"Her nose is bigger," she said so seriously.



I smiled and shrugged it off as the fancy of a child's imagination running riot. "Go back to bed, sweetheart," I said, ruffling her hair. She nodded and padded back to her room.



The next morning, I woke up alone in an empty bed. My wife wasn't in it. Figuring she got up early, I went downstairs to make breakfast for me and our daughter. I was cracking eggs into a hot pan when, glancing outside, I noticed the car was gone. Odd. I hadn't heard her leave.



Then I saw something that made my blood run cold--her phone was still on the charger.



I had that sort of eerie feeling creeping over me-a feeling, I guess, that I was being watched. I shook it off, trying to be rational. I woke my daughter up, and we went downstairs to eat breakfast. As we sat at the table, I turned on the TV to distract us with some cartoons.



But just as it had begun, the screen flashed with an emergency broadcast. It wasn't the loud tone that usually accompanied them. It was silent. Red letters scrolled across the screen: "LOCK ALL DOORS. LOCK ALL WINDOWS. TURN OFF ALL ELECTRONICS AND LIGHTS."



Then it repeated. Nothing more.



My stomach twisted up in fear. I wasn't sure if it was a drill, but something about the broadcast felt different-ominous. I did what it said. I locked every door, every window, turned off all the lights and shut down every electronic device. But the growing dread in my chest would not be shaken.



Then I looked outside.



The world was unnaturally still. No birds. No wind. Nothing. It was as if the earth had stopped breathing. I saw my neighbors running around frantically, doing precisely that-securing their homes.



I didn't know what was going on, but instinctively, I knew I needed to get my daughter safe. So, I grabbed her and the cat, heading into the basement to wait for what was next.



An hour had passed. Downstairs, frantic knocking at the front door was joined by desperate screaming. I held my daughter close, her little body shaking with fear, her sobs muffled against my chest.



"I'll be right back," I said as softly as I could, laying her down carefully. I headed into the closet for my 12-gauge shotgun. As I approached the front door, I turned to the peephole.



It was my wife. Or. it looked like her.



But something was wrong. Her nose wasn't bigger like our daughter had said. That part seemed fine. It was something else—something subtle and horrifying. She looked distraught, tears streaming down her face as she pounded on the door.



But then I noticed—the car was still gone. There was no way she could have been outside if the car wasn't back.



It wasn't her.



I slowly moved backward away from the door. My heart was racing, and whatever was on the other side, it wasn't my wife. I needed to get my daughter to safety, quickly. I ran down the stairs and found her fast asleep on the couch, softly breathing yet sleeping like she had taken sleeping pills. I knew that she hadn't, but again, with a gentle shaking, nothing came out. And with that, the feeling of panic hit me.



I reached for my phone and dialed 911. It rang forever until finally a female voice answered.



"Please," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "Something's going on. My wife-"



"That means it's in the house," she said, apparently cool as a cucumber.



"What?" I asked, the word crawling through my stomach like dread. "What do you mean? What's in the house?



Her voice fell to that cold, detached tone. "If you've looked at it, there's nothing you can do. Just pray. Pray to God. It's already too late."



I froze. "But-"



"You know," she said, her voice distorting into something unnatural. "You know what it is, don't you?"



I hung up, my hand shaking. That wasn't a human I had spoken to. Whatever that was, wasn't from around here. It was playing with me.



I tried touching my phone again now, trying to get onto the news app, but there was no internet. Then I looked around and saw—I shouldn't have been able to call 911 in the first place, for there was no service.



But I had spoken to it.



Just then, a helicopter droned overhead, crackling instructions through a loudspeaker: "Evacuations are in order. Help will arrive within the hour."



We just had to hold on.



I looked down at my sleeping daughter, tears springing to my eyes. I didn't know if she would wake up. I didn't know if any of us would make it through this.



All I could do was pray.



And wait.



The sirens wailed from afar, echoing down the silent streets as fallout began. It was the day the world finally ended.
