I awoke to find my daughter jumping on my bed, by all accounts confused. I vaguely registered yelling in the distance, groggily turned to my alarm clock-it read 4:27 AM. I rubbed my eyes and asked her, "What's going on?"

She looked at me with wide eyes and said, "Mommy's different."

"Different how?" I asked still half asleep.

"Her nose is bigger," she said seriously.

I laughed and told myself that a child's imagination had run riot. "Get back to sleep, sweetheart," I said, ruffling her hair. She nodded and padded back to her room.

The next morning, I woke up to a bed that did not have my wife in it. I figured she had gotten up early and went downstairs to begin preparing breakfast for myself and our daughter. As I cracked a few eggs into the hot pan, I happened to glance outdoors and noticed the car was gone. That was kinda weird, because I hadn't heard her leave.

Then I felt the back of my spine tingle-her phone was still on the charger.

I couldn't shake the eerie feeling that crept over me-a sense that I was being watched. Shaking it off, I tried to be rational. I woke my daughter up, and we went downstairs to eat breakfast. While at the table, I turned on the TV to distract us with some cartoons.

But the show had just started when, out of nowhere, an emergency broadcast appeared. It wasn't that usual loud tone. It was silent. In red letters now scrolling across the screen, it read, "LOCK ALL DOORS. LOCK ALL WINDOWS. TURN OFF ALL ELECTRONICS AND LIGHTS."

And then repeated. No explanation whatsoever.

My stomach clutched up in fear. I didn't know if it was a drill, but something with the broadcast felt different-ominous. So I did what it said. I locked every door, every window, turned off all the lights, and shut down every electronic device. But a growing dread in my chest wouldn't be shaken.

Then I looked outside.

The world was unnatural in its stillness. No birds, no wind, no everything. It felt like the earth had caught its breath. I saw neighbors running frantically to do the same thing-lock down the houses.

I didn't know what was happening, but instinctively, I needed to get my daughter close by for protection. I grabbed her, the cat, and we all sat in the basement, waiting to see what was to happen.

An hour had rolled by when furious pounding started at the front door, joined by despairing screams. I had my daughter clutched against me, her little body shaking in fear. I could hear her sobs muffled against my chest.

"I'll be right back," I whispered, laying her down softly. I retrieved my 12-gauge shotgun from the closet and approached the front door. I looked warily through the peephole.

It was my wife. Or. it looked like her.

 

Yet, something wasn't right. Her nose wasn't larger, as our daughter had spoken of. That part was fine. It was something else, more subtle and awful. She looked stricken, streaming tears on her face, practically beating on the door.

 

I suddenly realized-the car was still gone; hence, there was no way she could have been outside if the car wasn't back.

 

That wasn't her.

I backpedaled from the door, my heart racing. Whatever was on the other side wasn't my wife. The bottom line was I had to protect my daughter. Racing downstairs, I found her fast asleep on the couch. She was still softly breathing, but she wouldn't wake up. It was as if she had taken sleeping pills, but I knew she hadn't. I shook her softly, but there was no response.

Panic began to envelop me.

I took my phone and dialed 911. The line rang for what seemed like an eternity before an operator finally picked up.

"Please," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "Something's going on. My wife-"

"That means it is in the house," the operator cut in. Her voice was eerily calm.

"What?" I asked. "What do you mean? What's in the house?"

Her voice dropped to a cold, detached tone. "If you've looked at it, there's nothing you can do. Just pray. Pray to God. It's already too late."

I froze. "But-"

"You know," she said, her voice distorting into something unnatural. "You know what it is, don't you?"

I hung up, my shaking hand still clutched around the receiver. That hadn't been a human I'd spoken to. Whatever it had been, it hadn't come from here. It was playing with me.

I started checking my phone again, attempting to pull up the news app, but there's no internet. Then I realized-it shouldn't have been able to call out to 911 either. There is no service whatsoever.

But I had spoken to it.

Just then, the whirring noise of a helicopter boomed overhead, crackling through a loudspeaker. "Evacuations are in order," it yelled instructions. "Help will arrive within the hour."

We just had to hold on.

I looked down at my sleeping daughter, tears welling in my eyes. I didn't know if she'd ever wake up. I didn't know if any of us would make it through this.

All I could do was pray.

And wait.

The sirens had wailed in the distance, their wails rebounding against silent streets. All i could do is pray.
