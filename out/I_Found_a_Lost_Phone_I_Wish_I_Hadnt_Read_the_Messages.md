Hey everyone, it’s been a while since I posted, but I found something you might like.

My mom found a phone on the street. Since she doesn’t know jack about tech, she asked me to check if I could unlock it and call a contact. I found a way, some glitch in the lock screen I found online (thanks, hackers of the internet ).

And yeah, curiosity got the best of me.

Before calling anyone, I started reading the messages.

I know, I know. Bad idea... But sometimes you just can’t look away !

Then I found this conversation :

Hey. Been a while since we talked. Don’t hate me for this, but I’m not reaching out for good reasons. You know it’s just you and Daniel for me. And with you so far away, it’s getting worse. The anxiety won’t go away. Ever since Emily died, every day is hell. But this… this feels different. I think I’m going crazy.

08:43:05 – Received
Hey, good to hear from you—even if it’s not for good reasons. You still sound like you’re struggling. Maybe you should see a therapist again? I still don’t understand why they let you out.

08:46:42 – Sent
Was kinda hoping for more compassion, less judgment. I’m a grown-ass woman, Jessica. I’m 46. I think I can tell if I’m doing okay or not. I’m not a danger to myself or anyone else, so legally, they couldn’t keep me. I’m just… tired. And sometimes, my brain gets tangled. I thought my sister would be there for me, but I guess not.

08:47:22 – Received
I’m just trying to help. But there’s only so much I can do. What does Daniel say about all this?

08:50:25 – Sent
He’s distant. Barely talks to me except to say I need to "wake up" and see a therapist—just like you. He’s been sleeping in Emily’s old room for a few days now. I think he’s seeing someone. I’ve overheard phone calls. Every time I walk in, he hangs up. Says it’s work, but I don’t believe him.

08:51:40 – Received
I really doubt he’s seeing anyone. Things are complicated enough. You said your brain gets tangled—what do you mean?

08:53:14 – Sent
Hard to explain. Feels like… my body isn’t mine. I have memories of things that never happened*, with people I’ve never met. When I tell Daniel, he listens. He tells me to “dig deeper,” that it’ll “come back to me.” It’s the only time he actually listens to me.*

08:53:39 – Received
Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this…?

08:55:45 – Sent
For fuck’s sake, Jessica, enough with the therapist! And they’re NOT memories. I never lived any of this. Anyway, I gotta go.

08:56:04 – Received
Okay. Take care… You know what I think.

Jessica. It’s happening again. I think I’m losing my mind. I woke up in the middle of the night—Daniel wasn’t there. I was mad. I was gonna confront him. But then… I walked past the mirror.

And I saw Emily.

It was quick. Just a flash. But I swear it was her. A mother knows. A mother feels these things.

Sorry for the late message…

06:30:39 – Received
Did you tell Daniel?

06:31:05 – Sent
Yeah. He laughed—nervously—then just broke down*. He’s not handling her death well. They were close. But Jessica, if you only knew… if you only knew how much I miss her.*

Sorry, I know it’s late. I had a nightmare. But it felt so real*.*

The fire. I keep dreaming about the fire. But this time, it was different.

This time, I was the one trapped in the room*.*

Jessica, I swear to God, I felt it*. The heat. The pain. The* smell*. Jesus, the smell. I don’t think I’ll ever forget it.*

06:43:21 – Received
What exactly do you remember?

06:44:38 – Sent
You know I don’t like talking about this.

06:45:27 – Received
I know. But your therapist was working through this with you, and it was helping. Just try. Please. You need to do this on your own.

06:48:23 – Sent
We were sleeping. Me and Daniel. We’d fought with Emily that night. Something about a party. Boys. First big fight. We went to bed. After that, it’s all a blur. I hear Daniel screaming. I smell smoke. Heat everywhere.

06:48:38 – Sent
Daniel is carrying me. We’re leaving Emily’s room.

But she’s not with us.

06:49:03 – Received
Why were you in Emily’s room?

06:49:20 – Sent
I don’t know. Why are you asking me that?

06:50:16 – Received
Think, please. What were you doing in there when Daniel found you? You have to remember, but you have to do it.

06:50:33 – Sent
I don’t know. I think… I think I was sleeping?

06:53:48 – Received
Sleeping. In Emily’s room.

07:01:37 – Sent
Yes! Maybe. I don’t know. Maybe Daniel and I fought and I crashed there. I don’t remember.

07:01:56 – Received
Okay… And then?

07:02:51 – Sent
Nothing. Blackout. I woke up in the psych hospital*. Daniel was there. He came every day.*

07:03:21 – Received
Why were you hospitalized?

07:07:11 – Sent
What the hell, Jessica?! My daughter DIED. Burned alive. Is that not a good enough reason to lose my fucking mind*?!*

07:07:42 – Received
Yes. But… how did the fire start?

07:07:58 – Sent
You know. The firefighters said a candle tipped over in Emily’s room.

07:10:17 – Received
And what was she doing?

07:12:57 – Sent
...She was burning photos*. Of the three of us. She was pissed off. Just* stupid teenage angst bullshit*. What’s your point? You trying to make me feel guilty? Make me say it’s my fault?*

07:13:19 – Received
The firefighters never mentioned burned photos. Just a candle.

07:15:38 – Received
No. But you were.

Emily.

You remember it because it’s your memory*. You started the fire. You burned the photos after fighting with your parents. Your mother died in the fire. Daniel carried you out, but you passed out from the smoke.*

You woke up on the stairs.

You saw your mother burning alive*.*

Daniel couldn’t save her.

This is the second time you’ve been hospitalized. And every time, you forget*. Baby,* it’s not your fault*. You don’t have to live for her.*

You have to forgive yourself.

07:16:39 – Received
*Daniel is taking you to the hospital now. They’re going to take care of you. Love, your Aunt.*Found this on some mental health forum before it got deleted. Figured it was worth sharing.
