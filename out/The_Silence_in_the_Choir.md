I’ve always loved singing. It used to be the one place I felt safe, free—until now.

It started two months ago when Clara, our choir’s lead soprano, died. We were rehearsing late for an upcoming performance, her voice ringing in the air like pure gold, when she just... collapsed. No explanation. The doctors said it was a heart attack, but the way her mouth hung open—stretched far too wide, like something unnatural had ripped her last note from her throat—haunted me.

Then it happened again.

Emily, another soprano with a voice like silk, was found in the choir room. I remember walking in and seeing her lying there, mouth wide open, frozen in a silent scream. Her voice, like Clara’s, stolen. The coroner couldn't explain it. We were told it was some rare medical condition, but none of us believed it. Not anymore.

Especially after the rumors started.

They say it’s her. A ghost. The spirit of a woman who once sang in this very church, long before any of us were born. Her voice was the most beautiful in the choir, but she was overshadowed, her talent ignored. In her bitterness, she took her own life right there, behind the pulpit. The church buried her in an unmarked grave, and now her vengeful spirit roams, stealing the voices of anyone who dares sing more beautifully than she ever could.

And she’s getting closer.

At first, it seemed random—Clara, Emily, then Jonathan, our tenor. But now, the pattern is clear. She’s taking the best voices first, one by one, and each time, their mouths are left frozen wide open, as though she ripped their voices right from their souls.

I’m next. I know it.

I’m the lead soprano now, but every time I open my mouth to sing, I feel her. I can hear faint whispers in the walls, a low hum that no one else seems to notice. She’s watching. Waiting for me to hit that perfect note, and when I do, I know she’ll come.

Last night, I stayed late after rehearsal, thinking I could practice in secret. But the moment I began to sing, the lights flickered, and a cold breeze swept through the room. I stopped immediately, heart pounding, but it was too late. The silence that followed felt heavy, oppressive, like the air itself had been drained of sound.

And then I heard it—her voice. A soft, raspy echo, like someone singing with no breath left in their lungs. It came from the back of the room, where the shadows clung to the corners. Her figure appeared, pale and thin, mouth stretched impossibly wide. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t move.

All I could do was watch as she glided toward me, her mouth opening wider, wider, a gaping black hole where her voice should be. The room filled with the sound of her breath, shallow and ragged, as though she was inhaling every sound around her.

I ran.

But I can still feel her, even now. Every time I sing, she’s there, lingering just out of sight, waiting for me to slip. Waiting for me to hit that one note too perfectly, to open my mouth too wide.

The choir has tried to fill the gaps left by those who’ve died. We bring in new voices, new singers desperate for their chance to shine, but it doesn’t matter. She takes them, one after another. Each time, their bodies are found with their mouths wide open, eyes wide in terror. No sound. No explanation. Just silence.

Tonight is our big performance, and I’m terrified. I can feel her closer than ever. As I stand here with the choir, my throat dry, hands trembling, I know what’s coming. The others don’t see it—they don’t feel her like I do—but I know she’s here.

I’ve heard the stories, I’ve seen the bodies, and I know there’s no escaping her.

I’m about to sing my solo, the note that will seal my fate. I open my mouth, and for a moment, the world goes quiet. Every breath, every heartbeat, hangs in the air.

And then I feel her cold fingers around my throat.

The last thing I’ll ever hear is her voice—stealing mine.
