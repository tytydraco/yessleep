The first night the alarm sounded, I thought it was a drill. It went off at exactly 2:17 a.m., not blaring, not urgent, just a low, steady tone that vibrated through the concrete like a distant engine idling underground. No flashing lights, no shouted commands. Just a sound that made it impossible to sleep through.

I reached for my radio, before I could key it, it crackled on its own. “Stand by,” command said calmly. “Remain in quarters.”

That was it. No explanation, no follow-up.

By morning, no one mentioned it. Not in briefing, not over breakfast, not even in the quiet looks soldiers give each other when something’s wrong but unspoken. I asked my bunkmate if he’d heard it.

He looked at me for a long second, then said, “You get used to it.”

That should’ve been my warning. The base sat on the edge of nowhere, dust, wire, floodlights, and a horizon that never changed. We were told it used to be something else decades ago. An outpost, a relay, a place no one wanted anymore. Now it was ours, and our job was simple: monitor, report, do not deviate.

The alarm went off again the next night, 2:17 a.m. on the dot. This time, I noticed something else. When it started, the insects went silent.

Not gradually, instantly. Like someone had flipped a switch on the world outside the fence. Even the generators seemed to hum lower, as if the sound was pressing down on everything.

I checked the clock, I checked my watch. Same time. I didn’t touch the radio, at 2:24, the alarm stopped. Seven minutes, always seven.

By the fourth night, no one slept through it anymore. You could feel the tension in the barracks, the way my fellow countrymen stayed rigid in their bunks, the way they breathed slowly, like we were all pretending to be somewhere else until it passed.

On the fifth night, someone broke. A new guy, barely a week in. When the alarm started, he bolted upright and shouted, “What the hell is that?”

The radio came alive instantly. “Remain in quarters,” command said, sharper this time. “I hear something,” the guy said. “There’s, there’s movement outside.”

Silence. Then: “Repeat. Remain in quarters.” The guy didn’t listen.

We heard boots hit the floor, the door slam open, then shouting, panicked, confused, rising fast. He kept saying the same thing over and over. “It’s standing wrong.”

Those were his exact words, then the shouting cut off. The alarm stopped, in the morning, his bunk was empty.

No investigation, no mention, even his name was gone from the roster by lunch. That afternoon, I noticed something I hadn’t before.

Beyond the outer fence, where the floodlights died into darkness, the ground sloped gently downward. I’d always thought it was just terrain. But now I could see impressions, long, shallow grooves in the earth, like something heavy had been dragged there repeatedly.

All leading away from the base. That night, I didn’t wait for the alarm. At 2:15, I was already awake, sitting on my bunk with my boots on and my radio in my hand.

2:17 a.m. the sound rolled through the walls. This time, I heard something else layered beneath it, footsteps. Slow, even, not running, not even patrolling, but circling.

My radio crackled. “Do not look outside,” command said quietly. “This is your final warning.”

My heart was hammering so hard it hurt. The footsteps stopped directly outside our building. I could feel it, pressure, like the air itself was leaning in.

Something scraped along the wall. Not metal, not nails. Something broad, careful. A voice spoke then, muffled by concrete but close enough that I felt it in my teeth.

“You stay inside now,” it said, awkwardly, like it was trying the words out. “You stay until quiet.”

I squeezed my eyes shut. The footsteps moved on, at 2:24, the alarm stopped. I put in my transfer request the next morning. So did three others, two were approved, one wasn’t.

Mine came back stamped: DENIED ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL.

That was two months ago, I don’t sleep much anymore. But I’ve learned something important, the alarm isn’t a warning, it’s a signal.

Every night at 2:17, something comes close enough to listen. And every night we stay inside, quiet and obedient, it leaves us alone, I don’t know what will happen when it finishes learning our routines.

I just know the alarm hasn’t missed a single night, and neither has it.
