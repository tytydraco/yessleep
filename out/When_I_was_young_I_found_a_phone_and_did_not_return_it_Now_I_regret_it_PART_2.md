If you havent read PART1 you can do it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/157rjz3/when_i_was_young_i_found_a_phone_and_did_not/).

We stood frozen in front of the small grayscale screen. The text read simply "Time's up." Present in the room were Nathan, Mike, and Joshua, Mike's buddy, just as Nathan was mine. We looked at each other, but no one knew the right thing to say. The evening had turned from an innocent game to a terrifying ordeal that had me almost throw up from fear alone.Nathan spoke first and said that he wanted to return home. I wanted to disagree, but I just remained silent, looking at the phone. Soon, Mike and Joshua left too; I don't think they said much when they walked towards their homes.

The next day, we went to school as if nothing had happened. I hid the phone between my bed's wooden frame and the quilt before leaving and acted as if I was just a bit dizzy in front of my parents. That day, Mike didn't come to school.

"It's only natural," Nathan said, "we don't feel good either, maybe we should have stayed at home too."

"When we walked yesterday, he seemed fine," said Joshua, "as fine as you could be given the... you know."

"Do you have it with you? We need to leave it where we found it," Nathan told me nervously."No, I didn't bring it with me," I answered, "for some reason, I was afraid to."

The three of us tried to go about our day as if nothing wrong had happened. When I went home, I tried not to think about the phone, tried to pretend it wasn't in my room, but eerie thoughts overwhelmed me. What if I opened it? Maybe there was something inside that could bring everything to an end.

I looked outside my window; on the opposite side of the road, there was a house. All the windows in the neighborhood were shut or black due to the absence of light, but on that specific building, the light was on, and a figure stood as if it was looking at me. I couldn't stand it anymore; I thought, "I need to take the phone and make a call. I'll call it, I told myself, I will ask for us to be left alone and that we wish to return the phone to whoever its owner is."But when I slid my hand behind the wooden frame of my bed, I gripped empty air. The phone was gone.

"What do you mean it's gone?" Nathan yelled when I told him. It was the first thing I did the next day morning when I met up with him and Joshua outside school.

"I had it hidden, but when I reached for it, it wasn't there."

"Maybe you forgot where you've put it, try looking somewhere else-"

"No, it's gone! I'm sure of it." Without realizing, I had raised my voice, but I was certain the phone was lost.

"A phone can't disappear into thin air, even that type of phone. I'll come by your house to look for it after school. Joshua, you should come too."

"I'll go check on Mike. It's the second day of school he misses; that's not like him. I need to see how he is doing," said Joshua.

Nathan and I searched my whole room, every corner, every possible place where the phone could be, but it was nowhere. After an hour of searching, Nathan cheered up.

"Maybe we're free," he said. "If the phone's not in our possession, then we are not in the wrong, are we?"

"I don't think it works like that," I answered.

"But think about it, a haunted phone? It could as well be Mike's prank. That's why the phone has gone missing; he took it back and is having the laugh of his life with Joshua."

"No, I remember hiding the phone after all of you guys left. There is no doubting that. Nathan, the phone is real; we all saw it; we all heard it. Being gone doesn't mean we are out of trouble."

"You know what, you are the one who found it; you brought it to us. How do I know it's not your prank?" Nathan looked at me with disbelief and continued, "Yes, you had the whole crew believe in some haunted phone you found on the street. That's very funny, Chris."

"How can you say that? We heard it together, the man in the bass voice talking to us, and then the text, the four of us saw it write 'Time's up.'"

"I'm going back home," said Nathan. "I'm done with this."

For the first time after I found the phone, I felt as if I was the only one who witnessed it. Nathan did not believe me; Mike was at home, and Joshua didn't seem to take anything seriously. That night I felt alone. How could Nathan disregard everything we saw together, all the otherworldly occurrences? After Nathan left, I looked outside the window; the light on the window of the opposite house wasn’t on tonight, the black figure was under the streetlight in front of that house. I fell asleep with an ominous feeling that things would turn for the worst.

The next day, Mike came to school. He was distant, but so was Nathan. Could they have talked behind my back? Maybe Nathan filled him up with his theory of how everything was a prank of mine. The bell rang, but Joshua hadn’t arrived; he was my last hope for company that day. As the hours passed, the three of us exchanged no words, and when the day ended, we got close to each other only because we were curious about the commotion outside the school premises. We saw police cars and sheriffs. A teacher walked by and said that nobody was to leave until we have cooperated with the police. A kid ran and yelled, "They found Joshua in a ditch."
