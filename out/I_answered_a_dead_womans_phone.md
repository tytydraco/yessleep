Two weeks ago, I bought a used phone from a pawn shop on the corner of Main and 3rd. The guy behind the counter was all smiles and tobacco-stained fingers. “Just came in this morning,” he said. “Practically brand new. Somebody probably upgraded and forgot to wipe it. Happens all the time.”

He gave me a slight discount after I haggled. The phone worked fine, if a little sluggish. No big deal. I factory reset it when I got home, just to be safe.

The first weird thing happened that night.

I was brushing my teeth when it rang. Not a default ringtone—some weird, echoing lullaby that sounded like it had been recorded on a cassette left in the rain. It echoed down the hall like it was coming from inside the walls.

The screen lit up. The caller ID said:
DO NOT ANSWER

I didn’t.

The next night, same thing. 2:03 AM, exactly. Same ringtone. Same ID.
Blocked the number. It still rang.
Put it on airplane mode. Still rang.
Turned it off. It turned back on.

By the fifth night, curiosity—or maybe sleep deprivation—got the better of me. I answered.

Silence at first. Then, slow, rattling breathing. Wet. Labored. Like someone trying to breathe through water.

Then a voice. A whisper. Female. Cracked and brittle like old bones:
“You have her phone.”

“Whose?” I asked, voice trembling.

Another breath. Then:
“You’re next.”

The call ended.

I should’ve thrown the phone out the window. Instead, I shoved it in a drawer and left it there. I turned the ringer off, took out the SIM, even removed the battery.

That night, it rang anyway.

I woke to the lullaby echoing through the bedroom. The phone—with no battery—sat glowing on the nightstand. I stared at it, heart hammering, throat too tight to scream.

It stopped after 30 seconds.

I didn’t sleep.

Next morning, I checked the phone again. A new folder had appeared in the gallery. It was named “See You.”

Inside were photos I didn’t take.
Photos of me.

Sleeping.

My mouth open. Head tilted. Eyes half-lidded like I was dreaming something wrong. There were at least twenty of them. All taken between 2:03 and 2:09 AM.

I live alone. The doors were locked.

I tried going back to the pawn shop, but it was closed. Boarded up. A neighbor said it had caught fire last week. “Total loss,” he told me. “Owner died in the blaze. Burned to a crisp trying to save something from the back room.”

I showed him the phone. His face drained of color. He stepped back like I’d pointed a gun at him.

“That… that looks like her phone,” he whispered. “The owner's daughter. She died last year. Car crash. They buried her with that thing. Said it was her favorite.”

I didn’t say anything. Just left.

Last night, I woke to cold air and the scent of wet soil. Like a grave.

The phone sat on my pillow.

A new photo had been added.

This time, it wasn’t me.

It was a woman, standing in my bedroom. Her skin was gray and sagging, mouth torn at the corners like she’d been screaming too long. Her eyes were gone—just black, sunken pits staring right into the camera.

The timestamp said:
2:03 AM. Last night.

It’s almost 2 now.

The phone just lit up. The screen says:
LET ME IN

I’m locking the door. But I don’t think it matters anymore...
