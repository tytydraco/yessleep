"But after his drinking problem came out nobody believed him anymore. Not sure why we did to start with." Emily said, "How about you, Grace?"

I thought for a second.

"Well, we don't have any cryptid stories like that but we actually have a family of saints in my hometown. The Andersons. The living Andersons don't get illnesses or infections, their garden is incredible without them even trying and their dead don't even rot."

Aiden had been quietly sulking ever since Carla's spooky hometown story had gotten attention but mine somehow gave him reason to strike.

"Bullshit," he said, "there aren't families of saints living in rural America, saints are an official thing. And of course their corpses would rot, that's just entropy."

"Not what entropy means, dumbass..." Carla mumbled.

"General movement towards balance and chaos not entropy? Whatever you say. The point is that nothing is being perfectly preserved without a boatload of preservatives. And no garden is going to be better than those around it without leeching their nutrients or being fertilised."

Carla opened her mouth to retort but Emily cut her off.

"The point was just to swap odd little stories about where we grew up, not to analyse the science of it. Grace never said she believed it. Carla, will you come to the bar and help me carry the next round to the table?"

Emily could almost certainly carry the drinks herself but splitting Carla and Aiden was wise, their breakup was still fresh and had not been amicable. Aiden neither continued his rant nor apologised when I was left alone with him and I was in my own world anyway. The Andersons definitely didn't rot - their corpses were displayed in the chapel. And whilst they could have been filled with preservatives that wouldn't explain their lack of illnesses. And their garden - we'd moved to live across the road from them and I'd not once seen it fertilised.

The idea that they were taking something lodged uncomfortably in my head. Some houses in our neighbourhood would fail to grow anything and whoever lived their would always be sick, regardless of how healthy they were when they moved in.

"Come back home." a new voice message on my phone said, the same message my mother always left.

Only this time I listened to two of those voicemails in a row and I realised that they weren't just the same words but perfect clones of each other. For the first time in years I decided to do as they said.

Booking both the flight and the time off work was difficult to do at short notice but everything in my body was telling me that something was *wrong*. Other pieces of oddness started to wiggle loose in my brain, all failing to form any kind of picture just yet. I remember that my mother had been involved in a vicious bidding war to move across the road from the Andersons but now I was wondering why. The house we'd lived in before that was an almost identical build and neither had substantially better links to transport or anything like that. 

My mother had been ill once, very ill. When was it that she'd gotten healthier? I was almost certain I remembered her being sick during the move and that filled me with a strange dread.

The weight behind the rental car was unfamiliar to me and I headed home cautiously. I was so distracted by the mechanics of driving that it took me longer than it should've to realise that my surroundings should have been familiar to me already. The houses, the actual buildings, were recognisable. But these houses should have been occupied, these lawns should have been grass and I could see an uncomfortable amount of plant pots with tall yet completely dead foliage in them. 

Instead of continuing straight back to where both my parents and the Andersons lived I took a detour to explore this dead zone. The satnav made it apparent that in following all of this emptiness I was beginning to slowly circle my original destination. I thought back to my memories of houses with dry lawns and sick inhabitants and wondered if, were I to plot those houses on a map, those places would form a ring around the sainted Andersons.

I had hoped to come across somebody who could tell me that the desolation I was seeing here had a mundane explanation. Perhaps there had been a wildfire that had ruined the soil or a chemical had been dumped here for some strange reason. I peered into the windows of some of the small, sad houses in the hope of seeing a sign of life. At one point I had to double back on myself as a huge tree blocked the road. It was severely rotten and so must have been here for some time and yet nobody had ever bothered to move it. 

After twenty minutes of driving and finding nobody I turned a corner to head to my parents' house. It didn't take too long for my surroundings to perk back up and soon it seemed like I was driving through a picture perfect suburbia, one far from any urban area of which to speak. The lawns were vibrant green, the paint on the houses looked new and the people I occasionally saw chatting to each other looked almost like models. Part of me wanted to see something slightly ill or chaotic just so that I'd know that this was normal; maybe more manicured than some areas but loosely normal.

I braked sharply and got out of the car.

The plants and painted areas aound me had been getting steadily brighter but the thing that had alarmed me was that I could have sworn that the houses were getting *bigger*. I walked towards the doorway of the nearest house to test this theory, no longer caring if I looked strange. It definitely seemed too large. I stood against the frame and held my walking stick to measure the exact height, wrapping a hairtie to mark the result. I pulled up a little of the grass from the lawn to take with me, figuring that maybe if the colours were getting brighter and brighter then I could hold this old grass against the new grass and judge it for myself.

I was driving at a snail's pace now, my eyes feverishly scanning the area around me for more signs of what was going wrong. It didn't take me long to find it. Susan had always been one of the smaller girls in our class in school and whilst I hadn't seen her in a while I'd only moved away at eighteen. A growth sprurt to change the petite young woman into the imposing statue of a person who was now curiously watching me from outside her house would have been highly unusual, if not impossible. I waved self consciously. She did not wave back.

I picked up the pace again, wanting more than anything just to get this over with. The houses were unquestionably growing now, no need to get back out and check my findings after all. The colours had changed from beautiful gardens into a technicolour nightmare and only a few minutes after seeing Susan I saw the first person here over seven foot. His eves were wide like a Disney princess and he watched me intently. He opened his mouth to speak but then closed it mutely, thinking better of it.

At least he'd looked like a human, I guess.

People were leaving their houses to look at me. All of their eyes a little too big, all of their torsos a little too long. When I finally saw somebody whose torso featured extra arms in the space below her normal ones I was no longer able to be surprised. These humans would have towered above me now if I was to get out of the car. Their eyes were too large and their pupils too wide. All of their natural colours had been turned up, redheads now with hair as bright as fresh drops of blood and blondes with hair the yellow of a hornet's stripes.

And still I wasn't home.

When I finally pulled up to my parents' now unrecognisable home their were creatures lining both sides of the street. It doesn't seem sensible to call them humans at this point. I mentally prepared myself to use my stick as a weapon as I climbed out of the car, knowing that there was still no way that I could possibly win. But they didn't try to fight me. They didn't even get in my way. I made my way to the front door as quickly as I could and used my full weight to pull it open.

The inside of the house was now a temple to a type of nature that was foreign to me. The colourful leaves that climbed across the walls were comoing from the small pots that had once housed my father's succulents but they had not been any form of succulent for a long time.

They were there in the living room, the things that used to be my parents. There was a platter of strange fruits on the arm of the sofa and, somewhat heartbreakingly, these things had brought down all of my childhood toys for my return.

"Home. Home. Home." my mother's voice said, though it wasn't coming from her.

She had a recorded message on her phone, perhaps the same one that she used to send me as a voicemail to ask me to return in the first place. My face was slick with tears and when I walked over to hug my once-parents I swear the steps I took were the easiest I've had in years.

I'm home, I suppose.

And I'm not sure if I want to [leave.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leavesandink/)
