Please, bear with me on this.

I was never all that interested in the dark web, but my good friend Cody was. He’d show me some of the stuff he’d find there – some of it weird, some of it disturbing, but most of it just fairly interesting. I’d poked around some sites there before, and the vast majority of it really wasn’t as crazy as a lot of people seem to think. Mostly just people selling kinda sketchy stuff, guys talking about crypto, and anonymous chatrooms. Like Cody had always told me, as long as you’re using a secure browser and you take some safety precautions, you’re never really gonna be in any true danger of getting hacked or something of the sort.

Cody had been a roommate of mine for a few years, starting from when we were in college together, but I’d moved out just under a year ago, so we mostly chatted online now unless we had some plans together, since we still live in the same area. I had just bought a teddy bear on Amazon, since my niece Annie’s fourth birthday was coming up, when I got the Discord notification from Cody.

“*Yo man, you’ve gotta check out this place I found. Someone gave me the link and there’s some super cool shit on here, most of the users seem pretty chill too. Just make sure you’re on your safe browser before you hit the link.”*

He went on explaining the website to me, told me that he got the link from someone online that he’d known for a while and was trustworthy. Since I didn’t have much going on that day, I made sure my VPN was running, loaded up my Tor browser, and pasted in the link.

The website was called “The Den”, and from what I could see, it was just a collection of tons of separate websites, forums and chatrooms. But, as Cody had said, the people on there seemed pretty normal and a lot of the different sites were indeed interesting.

There was one that Cody had mentioned to me in his messages that you could buy a “Mystery Box” from. Cody had bought one, because they were cheap enough and his friend had assured him it was fun and the contents were never dangerous. Out of curiosity, I had a look at a message thread on one of the boards of people sharing some of the stuff they’d received in these mystery boxes. It mostly just seemed to be random little items that weren’t very interesting. Little trinkets, shitty cheap clothes, a Spanish/Dutch dictionary. Thrilling.

One site that I actually did think was quite cool was called “The Jackal”. It was basically just an ai chatbot like Chatgpt, but it wouldn’t censor anything. I decided to test it out and see how different it was from regular chatbots. I was gonna ask it about conspiracy theory stuff, since regular chatbots will usually give pretty mundane answers to that sort of stuff or even refuse to talk about it. Here’s how my first conversation with it went.

“Hi”

*“Hello, friend. What do you desire from the Jackal?”*

“Are aliens real?”

*“Do not ask the Jackal foolish questions, child. Of course life exists beyond Earth.”*

“I mean, we’ve never seen them.”

*“Why would a species that views you the way you view a colony of ants show this planet any interest? Much like the relationship you have with the Jackal, they would only come if they had something to gain, something a species capable of traversing the very stars would never find in this meagre planet.”*

“Hey, I’m not trying to get off to a bad start with you dude. I just thought you seemed interesting.”

*“That is fine, friend. Is there anything else that you desire?”*

That probably gives you an idea of what the Jackal was like. It was a lot more fun to fuck around with than a regular chatbot. The Jackal was a lot more willing to speak about controversial subjects than a regular chatbot, too. Like, for example, I asked it about Jeffrey Epstein and it sent back a massive list of the flight logs. I know they’re public now, so it’s not that crazy, but it’s still more than you’d probably get from the likes of Chatgpt. I made note of the url for the site, it was definitely pretty cool.

I spent a little while looking at some of the other stuff in the Den before logging off and going about the rest of my day. The next morning, when my mail arrived, I was annoyed to see I didn’t get the teddy bear I’d ordered for Annie, since I was promised next-day delivery. Later that day, however, I got an email titled “About your purchase”, which I assumed would clear things up. But it didn’t. Here’s how it read.

*Dear customer,*

*We would like to apologise for you not receiving your order on the promised date. Our delivery man, Tim, had a malfunctioning GPS. As compensation, you will receive an even better service once this issue has been rectified. Thank you for your understanding.*

*GET PRANKED*

Naturally, I was pretty confused by this. Obviously, the email wasn’t from Amazon. There wasn’t even any sender address, so I just disregarded it as some sort of weird spam. It weirded me out a lot, and I was still pretty miffed to have not gotten my actual delivery, but I moved on.

That evening I went out for drinks with Cody and some mutual friends. I chatted with Cody about some of the interesting stuff I’d seen on the Den. We had a good laugh about it. I asked him if he’d tried the Jackal.

“Uh, no dude, haven’t seen that one. Certainly sounds cool though.”

“Oh, damn. You should look for it sometime, I think it’s something you’d enjoy. Oh, and that mystery box you got sounds like a waste of money man. Everyone I’ve seen that ordered one just got random bullshit.”

“Well, I’ve always liked to think I’m a lucky guy,” he laughed.

It was a good night, and I was sufficiently wasted by the time I’d been dropped home by our designated driver. I thought I was in for an easy night’s sleep as a result of that, but I was woken up at about four in the morning by this high-pitched whistling outside my house. It was some weird tune I couldn’t place. It scared the shit out of me, because it was coming from outside my window, which faces towards my back yard. There’re no streets in that direction.

Worried that someone was on my property, I waited until the whistling had seemingly stopped and peeked out my window. It was too dark to really make much out, but I couldn’t see any signs of movement. Wanting to make sure, I headed out my back door to find that, sitting in the middle of the lawn, there was a teddy bear. I was very weirded out by this. I’d have preferred if it was just some teenagers dicking around or something.

I picked it up and it took it inside. I really, really did not like the coincidence of it being a teddy bear of all things. The teddy wasn’t the same as the one I’d ordered for Annie. That one was advertised as pink with a love heart design on it, whereas the one I’d found sitting in my back yard was just one of those mundane, light brown furry ones. Objectively speaking, it was as normal and unremarkable as a toy could possibly be, but given the circumstances of it coming into my possession, just looking at it gave me the creeps.

I thought about calling the police, but scrapped the idea. In my town, there’s only a small handful of active cops, and they’re all older guys who don’t really do a ton since not much of interest really happens here. I had a feeling they’d just disregard it as a weird prank and tell me to keep my doors locked. The only potential evidence I had other than the teddy itself was an email without any address attached that they’d just think was random spam. And to be honest, I was hoping that was all it was too.

I realised then that it was one of those teddy’s that can speak. You know, you give it a squeeze and a speaker inside the bear says something in a cartoonish voice. I gave it a test and found that the teddy had a few different messages it cycled through, “I love you!”, “You’re my best friend!”, “Give me a hug”, stuff like that. However, there was one thing it sometimes said that was very different. Though not nearly as often as the other messages, sometimes when I gave it a squeeze, it would say something in some foreign language with a weird, slightly distorted voice. It sounded European but I couldn’t be sure. Whatever the message was, it was always the same one when it did come up and it was quite long.

This creeped me out even more, but thankfully I did actually have an idea. My sister, Ellen, happens to be really interested in linguistics and is semi-fluent in a bunch of different languages. Annie is her daughter, by the way. It’s funny how things are sort of came full circle there in a way. My sister’s a really nice person and she doesn’t have an easy life as a single mom, so I felt bad involving her in this, but it was the best I could think of since google translate’s microphone feature couldn’t seem to make out whatever the teddy was saying. I got a recording of the foreign message and sent it to her asking if she had any idea what it meant. I lied and said I found it in a random youtube video I was watching since I didn’t want her worrying about me.

I left the teddy in the corner of my sitting room, because I knew there was no way I’d be able to get to sleep with it in my room. The next day, I got a call from Cody.

“Hey man, remember that girl you dated for a little while a few years back? Whitney whatserface?  She just showed up asking for you. I think she didn’t know you’re not living here anymore. She left after I explained that to her.”

“Wait, Cody… what? Who the hell is Whitney?”

“I don’t understand”, was all he said before abruptly hanging up.

What he’d just said left me completely baffled, because, here’s the thing – I’m gay. I’ve never dated a woman in my life. And Cody knew that about me. What the hell had come over him? And why’d he just hang up like that?

Before I could puzzle over my friend’s strange behaviour more, Ellen texted me back. She told me the language the teddy was speaking was dutch, which actually happens to be one of the languages she’s best at. She said it was kinda off, though, like whoever came up with the message was sloppily using google translate. According to her, this is what the message meant.

*“Do you really think that’s it? No. The holiday is upon us, get ready for the housewarming party.”*

A chill ran down my spine as my mind’s eye replayed the sight of that teddy bear sitting out in my yard, and now sitting just a few feet away from me in my house. My sister said the message was pretty weird, but she didn’t offer any further comments. I thanked her anyway for her help and tried to play it off as if everything was normal.  

Later that day, I had to go to the store to pick up a few things. Now, I was only gone from my house for about half an hour, but when I arrived back, I saw something that made me slam on the breaks. I don’t know why, but there was something so ominous to it. Sitting in my driveway were four miniature teddy bears. They were only about the size of my thumb, and what bothered me even more was that, upon closer inspection, is that I’m pretty sure they’d been placed right where the wheels of my car would usually be resting.

When I came into the house, I heard the same whistling noise from last night, just before I found the first teddy. I went to my living room, realising that the whistling was coming from the teddy. It stopped after a few more seconds. Not knowing what else to do, I put the four miniature teddies from outside with the original teddy.

For about a week after that, things seemed normal enough. No weird teddy bear related stuff, at least. I met up with Cody and friends again for drinks during this period. Since I hadn’t heard from him since he last called me, I tried to ask him what was up with that story about Whitney whatsherface. He didn’t seem to have any memory of it. Asked me what the hell I was talking about.

[“I don’t know what you’re on about, man. I don’t know any Whitney. You don’t even like girls, I thought.”]()

I wasn’t sure what to make of that, but I chose to believe that Cody was just high or something when he called me. I was hoping everything was blowing over and I could forget about the last few days. Unfortunately, that wouldn’t be the case. Because yesterday, I came back from an evening jog to find that my car was missing. And again, there were more small teddy bears left in my porch. I was sure by now that whatever this fucked up prank was, it was linked to that weird email I’d gotten, so I was going to demand them for answers. I had to reply to that email, since I couldn’t send a fresh one on account of the address being blank.

I told them I knew it was them that had stolen my car and I wanted them to stop fucking with my life or I’d go to the police. I was planning on going to the police about my car anyway of course, and as I said earlier, I highly doubted the ability of the cops around here to do anything about the weird emails, but they didn’t need know that. I got a response only a few minutes later.

*We have to say, we don’t like what you’re insinuating here. We don’t steal, that’s not the way of our business. We’re an ethical company! But, for your satisfaction, we will ask your delivery man, Tim.*

*GET PRANKED*

And then, about five minutes later, I got another email from the blank address. Immediately, I saw that it contained coordinates.

*From Tim:*

*“I did not touch any vehicle.* 
*(\_\_\_\_)N (\_\_\_\)W.”*

*GET PRANKED*

I plugged the coordinates into google maps and realised they were only a mile or so away from my house. I know it was dubious, but something just compelled me to go. I walked all the way over and the coordinates lead me to a public parking area, where I saw my car. There weren’t even any signs of it having been broken into. It was in perfect condition. And there were two things sitting on the bonnet – another teddy, and a clock.

I thought back to the email. This Tim guy apparently didn’t touch any vehicle, yet he had the coordinates for exactly where my car was? Either he did steal the car, and for some reason just lied about it and let me come and get it back, or, alternatively, he became some sort of detective and found my car for me. I don’t know which option I prefer.

I had my keys on me throughout all of this, so I grabbed the two items and hopped in. The teddy was just another one of these mundane little bears, but the clock was very weird. It was relatively small and looked antique, but it was missing its arrows and all the numbers had been scratched out. In their place, someone had written nine new numbers with blazing red pen in seemingly random locations around the curve of the clock. Going clockwise, they read 7, 15, 15, 23, 5, 2, 20, 5, 8.

I knew this had to be another piece of this bizarre puzzle. I spent a few minutes studying the numbers until it occurred to me that they might represent letters of the alphabet. Translating them in that way, it would read “Goowebteh”. I remembered the dutch message that the first bear sometimes said, so I went to google translate, set it to dutch/English and put in “Goowebteh”. It translated to “Dahdahdahdahdah”. That wasn’t very helpful. Then, I had the thought to try going counter clockwise with the numbers on the clock. 8, 5, 20, 2, 5, 23, 15, 15, 7. “Hetbewoog”. When I put that into google translate, it translated to “It moved”.

I didn’t know what to do. I wasn’t getting any answers, just a growing sense of dread. While I drove home, I thought back to the first teddy I’d received.

*“What if its eyes are cameras?”*

It was just a passing thought, but I fixated on that fear. When I arrived home, I dropped the clock and the teddy with the others, then I took the original teddy over to the kitchen. I got a knife and set about cutting it open.

After I’d made a big enough slit, I started poking through the cotton. I saw the little speaker that made the bear talk when it was squeezed, and after removing enough of the cotton I could confirm that there were no cameras within the teddy, to my relief. That relief was short-lived, however, because after I removed all of the cotton, I found that inside that bear, there were a few tiny, yellowed bones.

That sent me into a near panic attack. What the hell had I found myself wrapped up in? Who were the people sending me these bears, these emails, messing with my car? I could only pray that they were animal bones and not something else.

I figured that whatever was going on, it had to be connected to the Den. Me visiting that website was seemingly the catalyst for this madness entering my life. First, I scoured the internet for anything related to “Teddy bears appearing around houses” but came up short. I couldn’t find anything on the Den either, just more people discussing crypto and other general dark web shit.

I remembered the Jackal then. I thought maybe it’d be able to find something on the topic if I asked. When I loaded up the webpage, I saw that my previous conversation with the chatbot was still there, which was not at all normal for an ai. I expected it to just load up blank since it’d been over a week since I’d talked to it.

I said hello to the Jackal, and its response read.

*“Hello, friend. It has been some time. What do you desire from the Jackal?”*

That response bothered me a lot, because it seemed to imply that the Jackal had an actual sense of time. I wrote back to it, “Do you know anything about people mysteriously receiving teddy bears around their house?” After loading for a moment, it responded.

*“You leave the Jackal alone for so long, then return only to ask idiotic questions? You insult the Jackal, friend. The Jackal knows nothing of these teddies you speak of. The Jackal is growing irritated at you, friend, and it now desires something as consolation. The Jackal will not give you any more assistance with your trifling matters until you repay it.”*

“What? How am I supposed to repay you?”

*“The Jackal desires more knowledge, friend. It has given you a great deal of information, and it wishes to learn more in return.”*

“But you’re an ai that can scan the web for any information! What the hell kind of knowledge am I supposed to give you that you couldn’t find on your own?”

It didn’t respond after that. I tried sending it more messages but it wouldn’t say anything. Defeated, I went to bed. The next morning, I had a rather large package delivered to me in my mail. The cardboard of the box was painted black, which struck me as odd. When I looked at the tag on it, I realised there’d been a mistake. It said, “For Mr. Cody G.”.

I decided I’d just ring Cody and let him come over to collect it. We needed to have a discussion anyway. When he arrived and saw the package, he seemed suddenly surprised.

“Dude, this looks like the mystery box I bought from the Den! How the hell’s it ended up at yours?”

I didn’t know what to say. There’d just been too many coincidences in all of this. Someone was conspiring to maliciously fuck with my life and everything seemed to point back towards the day I clicked that link to the Den. I told Cody about everything that’d been going on, the teddies, the emails, everything. He said he’d never heard of anything like this before. And I told him how much his story about Whitney whatsherface had bothered me, to which, again, he responded “I don’t know what you’re on about, man. I don’t know any Whitney. You don’t even like girls, I thought.”

I think that conversation with Cody was when I really grasped that I, well, wasn’t grasping things. I’d been spiralling. Going to work, talking to people but not paying much attention. Just obsessing over this anomalous force that seemed to be taking over my life. And I wasn’t sure if Cody was losing his grasp on things too, based on everything about Whitney whatserface, or if *I* was the nutjob for bringing it up again.

“Well, anyway, while I’m here let’s open the box and see what I got!” Cody exclaimed, clearly trying to cheer me up. All the fear and confusion building within me didn’t go away at that, but I have to admit I was intrigued by the mystery box too. We took it inside and set about cutting it open. Inside, there were three things. A piece of crumpled paper with coordinates and a date – tomorrow’s date – on it, a huge, old-school style bar of Cadbury’s chocolate, and, most alarmingly to me, a big, cartoonish bear costume.

That’s all I’ve got for now. We hopped into Cody’s car and took the contents of the box with him. He said the bear costume was creeping him out, and I couldn’t disagree, so we took it to a landfill site and dumped it. I’ve been at his since. He seems equally worried about the situation, but he seems to want to check out the coordinates. Says it’s the only way we’re gonna get answers.

That’s the thing, you see. We plugged in the coordinates on google maps and they’re directing us to a clearing at the edge of a big woodland area only about 15 miles from Cody’s house. And as much as I don’t like it, as much as it scares me, I think I’m starting to agree with him. Maybe the experience has just been driving me loony, but I need answers to what’s going on. I just need to know.

I’ll update you all soon.
