I've already contacted my local police department, last night actually.  but they don't seem to care. They don't think it's serious. Or they think I'm an idiot.

But I am. Serious I mean.

Maybe they know something about him that I don't. I  guess that's not saying much. I don't know

much of anything about him. But I'm certain he's up to something. Sometimes you just get a vibe

about a person. You can just tell.

I know it's not "pc" but anyone who's honest with themselves will admit it's true: sometimes you can judge a person at first glance.

And my neighor, he's a bad man... I know that for certain now. But even from the start, I knew.

Most people wouldn't be willing to come out and say that. If they really looked at him they'd think it. Ofcourse. But would they come out and say so?

NO.

If anything they might concede he seems a bit eccentric.

He is a weird guy. But that's only half the truth.

He's got a weird looking face. He walks weird, not quite a limp but something's off. His whole image

gives a rough approximation of a modern man.... But his clothes don't match. His hair seems off kilter.

He has this strange, stooping posture and a slack expression on his face-- an expression that never

really seems to change. At least not as far as I've seen any of the times that I've watched him through my window.

Like I said, anyone would say he's weird.

But I know weird doesn't cut it.

When he moved in a couple weeks ago he did so at night. I remember because the sound of his moving truck woke me up.

Every time he backed into his driveway, that obnoxious fucking beep-beep-beep. And then there were those burning headlights on his truck, pretty much blazing through my windows.

Inconsiderate, or so it would seem. I'm sure you think so, right? To beep and blind your neighbors who are trying to sleep, that sounds inconsiderate.

But I think it was deliberate. He thought if he aimed those highbeams into my house, I wouldn't be able to focus past the glare well enough to actually watch him and see what he was up to.

Maybe he was even fool enough to hope I'd put up some black out curtains or drape some blankets or something to just ignore him and go back to sleep.

The idiot.

He underestimated me. I snuck up to my attic, and peaked out through the vent. Up there, above the scope of those blinding lights, peering out from the darkness I could watch him unseen.

But I didn't hear any voices, you know why? He didn't hire movers. He did the whole thing by himself.

Every.

Single.

Box.

All by himself. I watched.

I thought: Maybe he's just poor and can't afford movers.

I thought: That wouldn't necessarily mean he's a bad person...

But I fucking knew better. It was literally just him, all alone, all night. No friends to help?

An adult male with NO friends? Moving in the night, all alone? Deliberately pointing his headlights to blind me?! EXTREMELY suspicious.

And those boxes! I watched all night and I never saw him move any furniture. No appliances. Only boxes. And every single one the same exact size.

Doesn't that seem fishy? I don't know what it means, but it's obviously not good.

I wish I knew what was in those boxes. For a while I thought: maybe he's a killer and those are full of mementos from violent crimes he's committed across the country. Maybe even pieces of corpses!

Or perhaps those boxes were crammed with stacks and stacks of typefaced ramblings, some sort of

psychotic manifesto!

Then I thought, more realistically, they must be full of ungodly science. Experiments against nature.

Or-- worst case scenario-- the equipment and plans of some kind of conspiracy.

In any case, he's never opened any boxes outdoors, nor did he open them in front of any clear windows. I know because I reviewed my tapes. I'm damn glad I had the forsight to set up cameras in the attic that first night.

I'm only human, I can't keep a full vigil all alone.

But even with the cameras I can't figure out what he's got in those boxes.

I don't want to give him too much credit but it really seems like he suspects me. Or atleast suspects he was being watched by someone, if not me specifically. But probably me.

I think he knows what will happen to him if I ever confirm what's in those boxes!

I just need something concrete.

What am I supposed to do if reporting my neighbor for suspicious activity didn't work?

I supposed the answer to this was: find something concrete.

I've actually tried once before. Last night when he went out.

He only ever goes out at night by the way.

I track his movement in and out of that house. He leaves shortly after dusk. The door to his attached garage rolls open, he backs out. It rolls shut again as he drives off to God know's where.

Then he comes back any random time-- though always before dawn-- and sneaks his car back into the garage, where I can't see what he's doing.

I know you probably don't think that's so strange, or atleast not damning. You're probably thinking some people work nights, you might say it's normal.

I mean, since he's moved in I stay up all night too, but that's just to watch him.

And I've reviewed the foortage from the daylight hours, when I was sleeping. But I've literally NEVER seen him leave his house during the day. Not even to check the mail.

I know, because like I said: I've got the camera's running.

There's NEVER any movement on those day tapes. He doesn't so much as open the blinds or crack the door. If anyone knocks, there's never any answer. I've seen salesmen knock once or twice. One of the old ladies in the neighborhood-- Mrs. Stephens-- knocked too, yesterday actually.

No answer, of course.

So she left the tray of cookies she was carrying on his front step.

He never ate them. They sat there till dusk, then I watched him open the door to leave at night, like it was the most regular thing in the world. He glanced down at the cookies with obvious revulsion on his face. I was too far to hear for sure, but the weird expression on his face made me think of a hissing cat.

Then he picked up the tray and dumped them into his trash bin!

What kind of maniac throws away cookies?

I saw he kept the note in his hand though. But when he read it there wasn't even a flicker of emotion in his empty glare.

He tossed the letter in the trash too.

Then he opened his garage, hopped in his car and left.

I had to know what Mrs. Stephens had written, to determine whether his reaction or lack thereof was as monstrous as it seemed.

It took me a good 15 minutes to work up the courage to go snooping.

I'm not a coward but I've seen enough to be wary of this man. I don't know if he carries any weapons but I get an overwhelming feeling-- and I know I'm right-- that he's capable of violence!

It's legal to look through people's garbage by the way. But some people don't care about what's legal.

Some people are selfish brutes. What if he came back and saw me elbow deep in his dumpster?   


Would he get defensive? attack me?

I can't picture him flying into a rage, or at least not a spitting and spluttering kind of rage. He seems too cold for that. But I can picture him attacking with a ruthless efficiency. I can picture him killing me without batting an eye.

I picture him drawing blood and ending a life with the same bland sense of disregard that he offered

Mrs. Stephen's welcome note. And her cookies.

All these thoughts swirled together-- a cold slurry in my worried mind, but I FORCED myself down from the attic and out my front door. My heart was slamming in my chest, and I had that nervous sweat in my pits.

You know. The pungent kind of fear-sweat that stinks worse than exercise.

I felt like the devil was raking my heels as I zipped across the road between my house and his.

Then I opened the lid of his trash can and peered inside. A couple plain black bags, and a wasted tray of cookies on top... with the welcome note lying across them. Impersonal like any other trash.

I reached towards the note, then hesitated. I thought: I'm already here, why not check his bags. Maybe I'd see something important. Something he doesn't want seen.

I picked up the letter first. I won't bother boring you with the details. Suffice it to say, Mrs. Stephens is your typical friendly old lady. The fact that her heartfelt letter didn't even earn the crack of a grin or a smile out of his mouth is baffling.

And telling.

It either means he's a sociopath who doesn't care about human connection OR too emotionally

stunted to understand and feel a normal response.

Either way Mrs. Stephens deserved better than to have her yummy cookies thrown away with such cruel disregard-- flirting with the edges of disdain.

My heart was still galloping, making my throat feel all tight and my muscles twitchy.

But it wasn't just fear. If I'm being utterly transparent it was also rage. I knew there was something deeply wrong with my "neighbor". I put that words in quotations deliberately, because it's too good a word for him. He only lives near me.

That is by no means a redemption.

It was time to check those goddamned bags and see what he was really up to and what he was so carefully hiding.

I reached down and grabbed the topmost bag and gave it a tug-- it was heavy! Really heavy and I knew

I was on the verge of the truth. On the cusp of true discovery!

The culmination of all my watchfullness--

but then lights swept the road between our houses-- a car was coming!

I froze between fear of his return and the NEED to know-- but I was only a statue for a moment.

Fear won. And it won hard.

I fled like a thief.

Like I was in the wrong!

Should a cop flee from a robber? Should a knight flee from a dragon? Should I flee from him?

No! Of course not, but I wasn't a knight. Not then.

Then I was a coward.

Emphasis on was.

Now, I'm resolved.

And it's all because of what I saw when I ran away. I couldn't run back to my house, I would have had to cut right through the flood of his headlights.

So I ran the only real direction I could: to the bushes.

I lay myself down as low as possible.

My heart beat was like a rabbit in my throat, my anxiety felt like a physical thing and I seriously thought I might choke on it.

I forced myself to lie perfectly still.

Each shaky breath brought in a taste of the salty winter dust and my face was pressed hard against the brittle twigs and leaves-- but I dared not move.

I heard the groan of metal cables and rails as his garage door rolled open. I felt the rumble of his tires only a handful of feet away as he pulled up the drive.

It's a miracle he didn't see me. The headlights never touched me as he pulled up into his garage. He was close enough that I could see the undercarriage of his car.

I could smell the exhaust.

And once he parked and cut the engine... I thought I heard a thump. Like something banging against the inside of his trunk.

I could practically see it in my mind's eye: he had someone trapped in there. A victim.

I strained my ears, expecting to hear a cry for help.

But then the garage door started to close, and the squeek and grind of that damn machine masked whatever other sounds and sights I might have won.

It was clear to me that he was dragging some poor soul into his hell house. I wanted to run back to my house and call the police. But deep down I knew all I really wanted was to run away.

I commanded my body to lie still and let my mind breath. I stayed there, still as a corpse, just thinking things out for what I'd guess was 15 minutes.

Embarrassing to admit, but I don't know how or why it took so long to realize that running to the phone wouldn't help whoever was in there. The cops wouldn't do anything without evidence.

At this point, you see, I still thought I needed something concrete. And it had finally occurred to me that I'd only seen his house from one side, the side facing my attic vent.

Oh how incomplete that picture was!

If only I had thought to investigate and seen his back yard sooner! I'd have been spurred to action and who knows how many of his victims might have been spared??

But that night I was still scared. Going against the grain of my frayed nerves, I decided to sneak around his house.

What I saw shocked me to my core.

Raw earth.

All over the place. Grass-less patches of loose soil.

You and I both know what that means.

It means bodies. Lots of them. What I saw was proof that he had buried about a dozen victims in his back yard.

I saw a shovel leaning against the back door, along with several buckets.

And there was a strange contraption-- probably some kind of sadistic weapon or maybe a torture device. Undoubtedly, an evil thing for any man to own. It's tough to describe what exactly I saw, but I knew it was sinister. A long metal arm with wires wrapped around it. There was a handle on one end with a weird box mounted above it. I saw dials and knobs but was too far to read them.

And I was too afraid to get closer. What if that thing was some kind of sensor or an explosive?

There was a terrifying disc on the end opposite the handle and what I'm calling "the control box." It looked foreign. Possibly even alien...

My courage broke and I fled.

I sprinted like a bullet going with the wind and flew into my house.

I did call the police of course. But as you know: they're fucking idiots. They didn't think any thing I described was serious. They said they'd send an officer to check things out, but so far no one has come by.

What am I supposed to do if reporting my neighbor for suspicious activity didn't work?

Like I said I thought the answer was find something concrete.

But that's not it at all.

I don't need anything concrete, he's rotten and I know it.

He's ROTTEN and I don't need proof of what I already know!

What am I supposed to do...?

CONFRONT THE FUCKER

That's what the fuck I'm supposed to do.

I know he won't open the door if I go and knock. And the way he threw away Mrs. Stephen's letter I know he's not one for diplomacy. He won't entertain a polite intervention.

I'm going to hide in those bushes again, this time right at sunset. And I'm going to wait till full dark, when he opens that door....

The only thing I've got to defend myself is a meat cleaver but it will have to do. With the element of surprise it will be enough.

My pulse is slamming in my ears just thinking about it. My hands are trembling while I type this. I know things could go poorly.

I know what he's capable of, I know how easily he could snuff me out if I slip up...

But this is a chance I've got to take. He's got to be stopped and the police won't do anything, so it's on me.

It doesn't make me a hero. I'm only a man.

So I need to steel my nerves and get a grip on this fear.

I can't allow for even the briefest inaction. No paralysis, my mind needs to be a machine and my muscles coiled spring.

I've got to get out of my own head, or these jitters might get me killed.

I'll edit with an update as soon as it's done. If you all don't hear from me, then assume the worst.
