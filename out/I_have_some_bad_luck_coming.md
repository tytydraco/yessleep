I’m not going to give you my real name or location as this is still somewhat on going and I need to remain anonymous. But do need some advice on escaping my predicament 

What led to my life being ruined started as a stupid gift. 

My girlfriend, I’ll refer to her as Audrey, texted me. She wanted to see me, she said she had something that would cheer me up. You see earlier at school I told her about the big fight my dad had started with me.

He was always nagging at me about responsibilities and manliness. He didn’t get it, I was going to be a YouTuber when I graduated. He knew this, yet he kept pushing. I had no interest in working my life away for pennies like he had.

But what really hurt is my mom took his side, she always had my back. But she betrayed me, she told me my dad was right. That I should have something to fall back on, it was like she expected me to fail! 

Audrey knew I was upset and being the sweetheart she was she wanted to help cheer me up. Just talking to her improved my mood, she was my rock. 

We met at our usual place, the abandoned boat house a mile from where I lived. The place was creepy and dirty but private. I would often go there during school, skipping a few classes to write in my journal or scroll Reddit. 

I got there and saw Audrey waiting for me, as usual she was dressed in all black. Some girls had a Goth phase in high school but Audrey lived it full time. She didn’t care what people thought about her and I loved her for that.

“Alright babe, you have to close your eyes”. I thought about arguing but didn’t, she was too excited. I closed my eyes, “Ok hold out your hand”. I did as she asked and felt something hairy and warm brush my fingers. 

My eyes snapped open, I almost dropped the object. It was revolting. Audrey had placed a stuffed monkey in my hand, and not like a toy but a grotesque malformed little taxidermied animal. 

“What the hell Audrey? What is that?” she laughed and closed my fingers around it. She got right up in my face. I was painfully aware of the gross little thing crushed between us. She whispered in my ear, “it’s a lucky charm, take it home and place a bowl of milk and some bread by it. At least that’s what the old Romanian woman I bought it from said”. 

I gave her a disapproving look, “you really shouldn’t be talking to people like that. They’re untrustworthy”. Audrey scoffed ignoring my advice. We playfully argued for a bit then sat watching the water until the sun started to get low. We said our goodbyes and went our separate ways. 

When I got home my dad was waiting. “Where have you been, we tried calling you”. I didn’t feel like talking so I kept walking. He yelled after me, “hey! I asked you a question Josh. You’ve been missing for hours”. I just didn’t have the energy to deal with his bullshit, I slammed my bedroom door shut and jumped into my bed. 

Audrey texted me, “don’t forget to feed Junior”. If she really wanted to cheer me up tiddy pics would have been a better solution. But despite my constant encouragement she was too self conscious for things like that. 

Knowing she would ask about it in the morning I crept downstairs and grabbed some bread and a jug of milk. I poured some in an empty MTN dew can and placed the bread next to it. Good enough, I thought to myself before going to bed. 

I woke up to my dad pounding on my bedroom door. I groaned, it was 8:00 on a Saturday, what could he possibly want? “What Dad?” I snapped. “Did you drink all the milk?”  looked at the gallon jug sitting on my dresser, “no, I didn’t drink any milk”. 

I could hear him talking to himself clearly confused as to where it went. I heard him walk back downstairs. I didn’t get out of bed until I heard his car leave. He would be at work until dinner time, meaning I had the day to myself. 

I checked my YouTube channel, nearly 200 subscribers. It was growing but I needed it to grow faster. “Why won’t this channel explode already? I wish it would just start growing”. 

I didn’t get it, it was a reaction channel. People loved reaction channels, I had funny jokes and insightful ideas. I must be shadow banned. 

I texted Audrey asking her if she wanted to come over while my parents were at work. She replied, “sure, how was your first night with Junior?” 

Oh crap. I had forgotten about that little monkey thing. I ran back upstairs, it was missing. Audrey would be pissed if I lost it. I frantically searched the room but it was no use. “I wish that thing would show itself”. I sat on the bed dreading Audrey’s arrival. 

“Do you really wish to see me?” I jumped at the sound. It was like a whisper on the wind. “Who’s there?! Show yourself!”

The whisper returned, “as you wish”. I heard a dragging noise from under my bed. I quickly pulled my legs up, the noise grew louder. That disgusting little thing crawled out from under my bed. It turned its head around backwards and looked up at me. 

I screamed, it was terrifying. “Are you not pleased with your wish?” I pulled out my phone, I texted Audrey. “Did you lace that thing with drugs???” she texted back right away, “no of course not, why?”

I looked back at the filthy thing on my floor. “Just not feeling the best, better stay home today”. She replied but I didn’t bother looking at it. I had more important things to deal with. 

“Are you pleased with your wish?” I shook my head, “not at all!” “What of your first wish?” the monkey freak stiffly sat and crossed his dry legs. He looked up at me with those soulless eyes. “I need to please you master”. 

My phone beeped, it was a notification from YouTube. A congratulatory message for reaching 100,000 subscribers. 

I nearly dropped the phone. “Are you pleased?” the thing asked. I looked from the phone to him in disbelief, “this was you? You did this?” 

It nodded. 

“What else can you do?” “What ever you need, are you pleased?” I nodded. The thing let out a creepy little smile before bowing his head. “Your wish is my command Master“. 

My head was swirling, I couldn’t think. I got to my feet and ran out the door into the hallway. Deciding I needed some fresh air I went outside for a walk. 

I found myself at the boat house. Going inside I was surprised to see Audrey sitting there, “hey. What’s up?” she looked up in surprise, she brushed a loose hair from her face. “Hey, how are you feeling?” 

To be honest I was a little queasy, I told her as much. She looked sympathetic. “Shouldn’t you be at home resting?” before I could answer that damn voice whispered in my ear, “let me cure you”. 

I jumped at the sound startling Audrey, “what?” She demanded. I looked around the boat house. It was just the two of us and Audrey clearly hadn’t heard the voice. 

I searched for the right thing to say, “I thought I heard something, but it was nothing. You’re right, I should be at home resting”. After a quick kiss on the cheek I rushed back home. 

I felt like I was losing my mind. I barely registered my dad’s car in the driveway. I burst through the front door nearly knocking him over.  “Jeez Josh slow down”. I ignored him and stomped upstairs. 

I slammed my bedroom door. Hands trembling I pulled the gross little monkey carcass out from under my bed. 

“Ok, this is crazy… Are you alive monkey?” If anyone saw me now they would think I was crazy. Hell I thought I was crazy. 

The stuffed abomination didn’t move. I sighed in relief. I wanted to try one more thing, “I wish I had $10,000!” Nothing seemed to happen. 

I laughed in relief. It had been a dream, or maybe a hallucination from the decomposition gases leaking off the monkey. I didn’t care, I was just glad it was over. 

I didn’t notice the footsteps until it was too late, I had left my door unlocked and my dad walked in. “Hey Josh, your mom and I have been getting calls from your school. They’re worried you’re falling behind”. 

I wanted to scream but that would have only made him more annoying. I knew it would be a waste of my time but I tried to explain to him yet again, “come on Dad, we’ve been over this. Times have changed, school doesn’t teach you anything. Is there a how to pay your taxes class? Nope, just junk about history and cells. I’ve got my future figured out, school is just a legal obligation for now”. 

The way he looked down and rubbed his temples was all the warning I needed, “damnit Josh I took this afternoon off to talk to you about this. Which isn’t something I could afford to do, and do you know why? Because I have to bust my ass hanging sheetrock because I never made it to high school. I don’t want you to be in the same boat”. 

I jumped from my bed, all my carefully contained emotions rising to the surface. “Guess what Dad? I never asked to be born, I never asked for you to give up your great life to pay for me. You chose to do that and I don’t owe you anything for it! I wish you and Mom would just stay out of my life!” 

I tried to calmly leave the room but he grabbed my arm, my brain shorted out for a moment. He had never laid a hand on me before, I never would have thought my own dad would get physical. 

“You can’t keep running away Josh, life is going to catch up to you”. I pulled my arm free from his grip. I rubbed it knowing it would bruise. I didn’t need him, I didn’t need this place. My channel was blowing up, I was going to make more in a week than he did in a year. 

I decided to get in the last word before leaving, “when you’re old and broken I hope you remember this moment. I’m going to be famous and you’re going to die early and alone, I know it”. 

To his credit he didn’t try and abuse me any further. As I left the house doubt started to creep up, I didn’t have a license. Or a place to stay, if I didn’t keep up my upload routine my channel might suffer. My fans would only be patient for so long. 

I saw a paper bag stuffed into our hedge. I don’t know what made me think to grab it. I was curious I guess, when I opened it I nearly dropped the bag. Stacked inside the bag were neatly bound rolls of $100 bills. 

I could no longer deny it, this was my path forward. Such divine intervention could only mean that I was meant to go on my own and start my career. 

Should I tell Audrey? It wasn’t even a question, she had always had my back. I called her and told her to meet me at the boat house. 

It took her longer than it should have to show up but when she finally arrived I could barely contain myself. 

“I’m doing it Audrey, I’m moving out and starting my YouTube career!” Her smile kind of faltered, it was only for a second but it was enough that I noticed. “What? Aren’t you happy for me?” 

She rushed up to me, “of course I’m happy Josh! I just don’t want things to not work out, that’s a huge step”. 

I couldn’t believe it, after all this time she didn’t really believe in me. I threw the paper bag at her, “look in there. It’s my first YouTube payment. I’ll be getting that monthly, still doubt me?” 

It was a lie but there was no way she could have known that. I just needed her to know I had what it takes. 

Her eyes widened at the sight of the cash, “Josh… that’s incredible. I didn’t know the channel had grown so much”. She looked at me, “and I wasn’t doubting you, I just don’t want to see you hurt”. 

I pulled her in close, “I can get you anything you want. Anything in the world, would you like that?” I could still see the doubt in her eyes, the way she was stiff against me. She didn’t believe me. I would show her. 

“Sure Josh, what do your parents think about this?” I let go of her, of all the things to bring up right now she had to talk about them. 

“I don’t care what they think. I’m practically an adult and can clearly take care of myself”. Audrey didn’t look convinced, she didn’t even look happy. She was ruining my moment. 

“It’s what ever Audrey, just go back to school if you don’t care”. She pushed me away, “fine, be that way. I’m just trying to be reasonable”. The instant she left regret filled me. 

I called out after her, I even looked outside but she was gone. I had to make it right, I could give her anything. So I called out, “hey monkey bitch! Your master is calling!”

A cold breeze caressed my face, I knew I wasn’t alone. “I need to make things better with Audrey”. My voice died, what exactly did she like other than me? Wishing she had me would be pointless, but it didn’t have to be a physical gift. 

She had always be self conscious about certain things. I could take that away for her. Or. 

I could fix it, she would no longer feel inadequate and I would have an even hotter girlfriend! 

“Ok monkey, don’t mess this up. Listen very closely, I want you to give Audrey the body of a model and a love for crop top shirts”. I felt like I deserved that second part, after all Audrey was going to get something that would normally take months of dedicated work if not surgery. 

“You can handle that right?” That sickly voice whispered in my ear,  “as well as I did your earlier wish”. 

A fantastic idea entered my head, I would go back to school. Just for a day. I had a few things to wish into reality. 

I decided I would need a full day for what I had planned. 

Finding a place to sleep sucked at first. Motels wouldn’t rent me a room without an ID or credit card. I wouldn’t go home, so I had no choice but to wish for an invitation to the biggest house around. 

The mayor and her stupid perfect  twins Jack and Jill. Yeah she was that kind of parent. Jack was the football captain and Jill was a cheerleader. It was gross how easy success came to them, I hated them. 

All the more reason to mess with them. “Monkey bitch, I wish Jack Delossantos would invite me to stay at his house”. 

I shivered as a cold breath ran down my neck. But my phone went off, it was a text from an unknown number. ‘Hey this is Jack, from school. I know this is a little sudden but would you like to crash on my couch?”

I literally could not stop laughing, that dumb jock had no idea what was coming! Next I made him come and pick me up. After an admittedly awkward dinner I felt like it was bedtime. 

On my way to the guest room Jill stopped me, she stood in the middle of the hallway with her arms crossed. I hated how perfect her hair looked, I hated how hot she was. I couldn’t stand how she got everything she had ever wanted. 

“Spill the beans Josh. How did you get invited here? Do you have some dirt on Jack?” I couldn’t help but smirk, she had no idea who she was dealing with. 

“Oh it’s nothing like that, he’s just a big fan of my YouTube channel. And as a fan he wanted to hang out”. 

Jill made an exaggerated puking motion. “puh-lease dude, Jack hardly even watches YouTube. We have this thing called a life”. 

At least now I knew who would be the first to be humbled tomorrow at school. 

I attempted to brush past her, after all it was clear I was beyond this conversation. But as I did she put a shoulder into my chest painfully halting me. “What ever it is you think you’re doing, stop it right now”. 

I couldn’t tell if she was threatening me or trying to seduce me. Either way, she had gone too far. 

I stepped around her and went into the guest room. After closing the door I flopped onto the bed. I lay their thinking about all the different ways I would make her regret her attitude. 

For probably the first time I’m my life I woke up on time and was excited to go to school. 

I texted Audrey, “can’t wait to see you in class”. She sent something back but I had other things to deal with. 

Peoples mouths hung open when I jumped out of Jack’s mustang, I tipped him $100 just to let everyone know who the big boss was. I strode through the crowd with a confidence I know they felt. 

This was going to be a great day. 

I started with Miss Marinoni, she really did try her best and was easily the prettiest teacher I had ever seen. For her, I wished her student loans would be lost and that she would get a raise. 

Of course Stanley was ogling her, I mean we all liked to look but that fat bitch was just staring at her. Well he would have to learn, I wished he would say the thoughts in his head. 

Stanley jumped to his feet and yelled, “Miss Marinoni I would please you all night if I had the chance!” Miss Marinoni turned away from the whiteboard and with one hand on her hip she pointed to the door with the other, “principles office right now. That is not acceptable”. 

I was the only one laughing which was a little awkward but whatever. 

I was surprised Audrey wasn’t in class, she would have been right there alongside me. Then I remembered her text, I pulled out my phone. 

“Sorry Josh, I’m not going to make it in today. I don’t feel right”.

 Of course she would be sick on a day like today. I almost texted her back that the girl flu isn’t a real disease but choose not to. 

When lunch time rolled around I took full advantage. Aries puked for all those times he called me names. Rafael slipped and was covered in food for that time he tripped me in middle school. The cheer table, aka bitch central had every member simultaneously blow milk out of their noses. 

By the end of lunch my sides hurt from all the laughing. 

When we were released Jill was waiting for me in the hallway, she stepped into a dark class room, “come here a minute handsome”. 

While I hadn’t wished for this it was a welcome outcome to my obvious charm. I had a brief thought about Audrey as I entered the dark room but rationalize it wouldn’t matter. 

Jill’s seductive voice called to me from deeper in the room, I couldn’t see a thing. “A little farther Joshua”. 

I was so ready. And then multiple sets of hands grabbed me, covered my mouth and began to beat me. I tried to call out, I tried to wish it away but they had a firm grasp over my mouth. 

The beating went on forever, my ribs and abs were bruised and possibly broken. 

And then, they all left the room. Like it had been a totally normal thing. Jill spat on my face as she walked past. I lay there crying, they had ruined my day. Violence was totally uncalled for, but if that’s what they wanted. I could oblige. 

The first to suffer would be Jill, she was someone that I always hated. She acted so above others, so properly dressed and spoken. I couldn’t stand her, and now she had tricked me into an assassination attempt! 

There was a reason why I was the most successful kid at school. I had what took to make it, all she had was looks. And that’s what I would take in retribution for her acts against me. 

“Monkey. I wish for Jill Delossantos to fall and break her nose, and knock out her teeth while we’re at it”. 

That sickly breath caressed me for a second, then I heard a clattering down the hall followed by a wail of pain. 

I couldn’t hold in the smile, Jill had gotten what she deserved. The school nurse rushed past me no doubt to try and assist Jill in her time of need. 

I turned and nearly ran right into principle Powers, “Josh could I speak with you for a moment?” Panic flooded through me, “I was standing right here! I had nothing to do with it!” 

Powers raised an eye brow, “nothing to do with what? Jill tripping?” 

I turned and ran, he was on to me. I ignored his yells about a phone call from home. No matter what he had to say I didn’t want to hear it. 

I left the school building. Things had gone horribly, I needed to get away. Police cars flew past me, I tried to hide my face. I felt like the whole town was looking at me. At the first chance I had I ran to the boat house. 

Audrey was there, she spun around when she heard me. “Josh!” she didn’t look happy to see me, she looked terrified. 

“Hey you said you were sick, what gives?” Audrey had been crying, “Josh please, just go”. 

It was then I noticed the bundle behind her, I walked closer and Audrey jumped in front of me. “Josh I’m begging, please just go. I’ll never say no to anything again, I’ll do anything you ask and you won’t have to worry about anything just please leave!” 

There was blonde hair spilling out of a rolled up rug. I turned to Audrey, “what did you do?” 

She broke down crying, of all the things to do she chose the least helpful. 

“I woke up this morning and she was laying on my bedroom floor. She’s a model I follow on Instagram, and somehow I have her body”. 

“so I panicked, I rolled her up and was going to dump her body in the ocean when you showed up”. 

I was both horrified and impressed, then I was furious. That dumb monkey had literally given Audrey the body of model! 

“Don’t worry about it Audrey, go home. I’ll have this taken care of so you’ll never have to worry about it”. 

She looked up at me confused, so I repeated, “go home Audrey”. Showing some decent common sense for the first time she did as I said. 

Once alone I spoke again, “you dumb little shit, that is not what I wished for. Now listen carefully, I want this body” I pointed to the body in front of me, “and the rug it is wrapped in to travel in such a way that there is no trail to the moon”. 

I barely had the words out when with a whoosh of air the body and rug flew through the roof of the boat house. The vacuum of their departure pulled me forward and I ended up splashing into the frigid water. 

I gasped as icy salt water filled my mouth, inadvertently I filled my lungs with the same water. 

I managed to splash my way over to the ladder and started to climb up, my mind was racing with all the things I would say to that useless sack of fur. 

Right then the ladder broke and I plunged back into the water. This time I kept my mouth shut. I swam under the boat house to the shore. 

My phone was ruined, my clothes were wet and I was freezing. 

The Delossantos house wasn’t far, I made my way there despite the universe working against me. 

I walked right into the stupid boomer house. No one was home so I grabbed some food from the kitchen and after a shower went to the spare bedroom. 
I woke up in the morning to Jack standing in my doorway. “I don’t know why I invited you here, but the least you could do is hang up your towel when you’re done”. 

He threw my damp towel from the night before on my bed before leaving. I wondered why he wasn’t at school on a Friday morning. 

Getting dressed out of my newly wish filled closet I made my way downstairs. 

Jill and her mom were sitting at the breakfast table, Jill was being fed through a tube. Apparently her jaw was wired shut, she had gone through a facial surgery the night before to stabilize her orbital bones and would need a few more over the next couple weeks. 

I think I did a pretty good job of hiding my happiness, at least the monkey had pulled through on this wish. 

Her mom had to go dick around ruining things like all boomer politicians do so Jack was staying home to give Jill her pain meds. I thought about wishing for the pain meds to be useless but chose to be merciful. 

It was around mid day, I had just uploaded a new reaction video to my channel. A no doubt sure to be viral video, truly some of my best work. 

I went downstairs to grab a zesty drink to recharge after work. Jill was sitting on the couch all stiff like a weirdo, she must have heard me because although she couldn’t turn her head or her eyes she gestured for me to come closer. 

Warily I did so, she held out a folded up paper. Written with embarrassingly bad penmanship was the sentence “sorry about yesterday”.

“Words don’t undo bad actions” I told her before returning upstairs. 

While admitting fault showed some character growth she still had a long ways to go. 

I was on my phone scrolling through YouTube looking for the next video to react to when a text notification blocked the top of my screen. I groaned in frustration, Audrey wanted to call me. I was busy at the moment but knew I needed to make time for her. 

She answered on the first ring, “Josh we need to talk”. “Yeah babe that’s what we’re doing”. I could almost see her grinding her teeth, “Josh this is really serious, have you been home at all today?” 

I didn’t like where this was going, “no, I told you I moved out. I’m at a mansion now”. “Josh forget all that, three white Tahoe’s showed up at school today. The guys driving them looked really mean. I heard they came from your house. And then they came to mine, they had all kinds of questions about you. I told them we had broken up a few weeks ago and I think they bought it, be honest with me Josh. Where did that money come from?” 

The sweetness of her lying for me was squashed by her not trusting me. “Babe, go look at my YouTube account. It’s clearly from there”. 

“Josh your channel is gone”. In a panic I hung up and opened YouTube again, my account was suspended. I logged out and tried to look up my channel. It was gone, all that hard work gone just like that! I had put my heart into growing the channel and now it was gone, because of bot subscribers.

That worthless monkey hadn’t shown my channel to people, he had fake accounts subscribe to it! This was the second time he had messed up, this time was the worst yet! 

I would have to call Audrey back at some point but first I needed to check something. The paper bag was still under the bed and still filled with cash. At least he had gotten one thing right. 

I was tempted to wish myself away to another country. Surely anywhere would be better than the fifty third world countries in a trench coat I currently lived in. 

But I didn’t really trust the monkeys wish granting abilities after the last two mistakes. He would have to earn my trust again. 

Mrs. Delossantos made us all stroganoff for dinner, Jill had hers juiced and pumped into her. It totally killed the vibe, especially when Jack would lean over and wipe the excess from her chin. She’s 16 she can wipe her own mess. 

Clearly they disagreed and shot me dirty looks when I suggested as much. What ever, weird family. 

Unfortunately by speaking I apparently gave Mrs. Delossantos permission to talk to me. “Josh, I know you are a guest here but I’ve had the school reach out. They want to make sure you are aware of the situation at home”. 

I just nodded my head without looking up from my food, I knew what they meant. My parents were no doubt pushing to get me back into school. But I had transcended above that part of my life. 

She pushed a little more, “and you’re handling it? Because the school has very good therapists, I helped vet them myself”. 

What kind of weak ass needs therapy to move out? Jack spoke, “Mom what exactly happened?” She shook her head, “that’s not for me to talk about”. Jack nodded like a good little bitch and dinner continued on. 

Say what you will, growing up with all that boomer privilege had turned into Mrs. Delossantos into quite the cook. It was going to be a shame when I took over ownership of their house, maybe I would keep her on as a maid. I’ll even give Jill a chance at begging me to let her stay. 

Not wanting to waste the moment I waited until breakfast Saturday morning, I stood and waited until all eyes were on me. 

Then with a big smile I said, “I wish I owned this house!” 

They just looked at me, Mrs. Delossantos said, “it’s a very lovely house. Lots of people would like to own it”. 

My smile faltered, it hadn’t worked. I spoke again this time a little louder, “I wish I owned this house right now! And had the deed in my hand!” I held up an empty hand. 

Mrs. Delossantos put down her fork. “Josh sit and eat your food please. You’re 16 you won’t be owning a house anytime soon”. 

I sat feeling shame rise up in me. That stupid monkey made me look like an idiot! 

After breakfast I went to my room. “Show yourself monkey!” that putrid smell filled the room, I nearly yelled when I saw the stuffed abomination on my bed. 

“Gross dude, I have to sleep there! Why aren’t you doing your job? I need those wishes!”

It stared at me with it’s creepy little eyes. “Where is my food master? You said you were pleased, but you did not give me my food”. I was pissed, “so that’s what this is all about? You want some milk and bread! Just get your own!” 

It smiled, and it was not a nice smile. “I’ll see you in hell Josh”. 

And then it was gone, the only thing left was the faint smell it left behind. I felt a chill run down my back, ice cold fear flooded my spine. Things were about to get really bad. 

I wanted to call my mom. But the ocean had ruined my phone and I didn’t know her number. Walking home would take hours and I wasn’t feeling up to that. I hated living in a car centric society. 

I wanted to wish for a drivers license but I was scared the monkey would mess it up somehow. I was stuck, my only option was to take Jack or Jill’s car. 

I summarized Jill wouldn’t be needing her Jeep anytime soon. I found the keys on her dresser. It was a little weird going in her room, I wasn’t sure what I expected but paintings of horses and family portraits surely wasn’t it. 

I managed to make it to the garage without being seen. This family really hated the environment, parked between Jack’s Mustang and Jill’s Jeep was Mrs. Delossantos’ Escalade. 

They were single handedly undoing any bit of good I might ever do. Screw the 1%.

I got in the Jeep, put the keys in the ignition and turned it. Nothing happened, I wiggled the stick in the middle and still nothing happened. After a few minutes of pushing buttons and flipping switches I gave up. I would have to get a different set of keys. 

I nearly ran into Jack as I was leaving the garage, I managed to smoothly hide the keys from him. 

“Hey Josh, I was actually looking for you”. He held up my phone, “I found this on the bathroom counter. I was able to take it apart and clean it out, it’s charged and working again”. 

I took the phone tentatively half expecting a trick, “how would you know how to do that?” I asked. 

Jack shrugged, “I’m two years into my electrical engineering degree but honestly it’s pretty simple. Just a couple corroded connections. Go ahead and try it, everything should work again”. 

He left and I turned on my phone. Sure enough it booted up and despite a little fog in the camera lens it seemed to be working fine. 

I tried calling my mom but the call went to voicemail. I wanted to say something to her, something that would cause her to tell me everything was ok. Instead I hung up. 

I was on my way to the spare room when Jack called me over to the living room. He was sitting on the couch next to stiff neck Jill. On the TV was a news report, there was an ambulance at the high school football field. 

A reporter was talking to the camera, about how a body had been found under the bleachers. She went on about other details that weren’t important. Jack spoke, “it was Aries, Trevor sent me a snap. They had him on a stretcher, he said he could over hear the medics talking about how he drown in his own vomit” 

I felt cold, I had to sit. Even Jill’s creepy blood shot eyes weren’t so bad when listening to the drone of the reporter. 

Then the scene changed, it turned to a place I was very familiar with. My house. 

Cop cars and ambulances covered the street. Jack froze, his finger above the channel button. 

The bottom of the screen read, “second death at local residence, foul play suspected”. 

I jumped to my feet, “what do they mean second death? Who was the first? Hell who was the second?” I slumped back onto the couch. Jill placed a hand on my shoulder, I elbowed her. I hadn’t meant to hit her in the boob but it was effective as she withdrew her hand instantly. 

“Hey!” yelled Jack, “that had better have been an accident”. I think he knew it wasn’t but he also didn’t want to start trouble with me. 

I needed to get home, I was so focused on solving that problem that I almost missed the next story. 

A body had been found on the roof of the Red Moon Bar and Grill. A body belonging to a fairly well known Instagram influencer. 

I swore internally, what if the body still had Audrey’s DNA on it? What if they brought her in for questioning and she turned on me? Could I be charged? There was no way to connect me to the body, only Audrey’s word. But what if that was enough?

Shit was spiraling out of control. I couldn’t go to prison, it would kill my career. It would be the end of everything I had built! 

Jack was talking, I didn’t hear him at first. “Yo Josh, are you listening?” I shook my head trying to clear my thoughts. “I’ll drive you home Josh. Come on, let’s go”. I nodded, I needed to know what happened at my house. 

Jack patted Jill on the shoulder, “hang in there, I’ll be right back”. 

Weirdos. 

It didn’t take long to get across town in Jack’s ego-mobile. Who buys a green car? Seriously. 

Jack pulled up to my house, “you gonna be alright dude? I can hang out for a minute if you need me to”. There was still a news van parked in front of my house. The fire trucks and ambulances had left but cops were everywhere. Remembering the body Audrey had drug into the boathouse I began to worry they had made some connection. 

“Let’s just go, I don’t want to be here”. Jack looked uncertain, “bro it’s ok to be scared, this isn’t a normal thing for a teenager to go through”. 

I glared back at him, where did this privileged little prick get the idea that he knew more about suffering than I did? “Just drive Jack”. 

Without any more arguing  he did as he was told. 

When we were just a block from my house a white SUV pulled behind us. Then another pulled out in front of us. 

Before I could react Jack whipped his car onto the sidewalk, I screamed fearing for my life. “What are you doing?” 

A rapid succession of pops filled the air, the back window broke and glass rained down on us. I looked out the rear and saw one of the SUVs right behind us and gaining fast. 

They were shooting at us! A guy with face and neck tattoos was standing up in the sunroof holding a gun. More pops rang out. I heard bullets thunk into the metal body of the car. At least it now had justification for the crappy misspelled decals saying Bullitt on the side. 

Tires screeched and the air smelled like burnt rubber as Jack hit the road again. My head was thrown painfully against the back of the seat. 

Jack weaved his way through streets and parking lots, our pursuers gradually falling behind. As if following a command they both turned off from chasing us. 

I looked around us, “I think they’ve had enough” I said. Jack jerked his head in my direction, “was that because of you? Did you get involved in something?” The way he demanded answers rubbed me the wrong way. 

“Of course not!” I insisted. Jack was quiet, finally he stopped the car. “I’m going to the police, are you coming with?” The way he said it without looking at me made it feel like an accusation. 

I threw open the door and jumped out of the smoking P.O.S, “I’ll walk from here, you go do what ever it is you think you need to”. 

Jack didn’t hesitate, he drove off at quick enough pace to close the door. What ever, I didn’t need his car. His house was just up the road. I would go there, retrieve my money and leave town. 

It didn't take a genius to figure out my parents were gone, Audrey was likely heading to prison and people were going to start pointing fingers at anyone who was different. And I was very different from all the losers in this town. 

Maybe I hadn’t noticed them parked outside, maybe they had hidden their cars. Either way I walked right into the Delossantos house with my guard down. 

My quick wit saved me though, I heard voices coming from the living room. Wanting to know what they were saying and if it was about me I crept closer. 

“Listen girl, you can talk or we can make you talk” said a rough voice. 

A second more mellow voice spoke up, “come on man. Can’t you see her jaw is wired shut? She can’t say anything”. There was a pained whimper then the second voice spoke again. 

“Dude, wired shut. Undoing the wiring isn’t going to fix what ever is broken, get a pen and paper”.

The first man simple grunted. Footsteps led away. The remaining man spoke in a softer voice, “listen kid. He’s gonna come back and if you don’t give him what he wants he’s going to hurt you or worse. We traced the license plate on the mustang to this address, we just want what’s ours. Can you help with that?” 

The money, they were here to take my money and that idiot Jack had given them all they needed in order to find me! 

I needed to go, I needed to get to the money before anyone else ratted me out. If they took it I would be stuck in this dead end town. 

I ran for the stairs. They must have been distracted because no one came after me. I pulled the money out from under my bed. It was all there, I could still pull this off. 

Knowing Jill had likely cracked by now I made my way out the window and onto the roof. Rich assholes like the Delossantos’ liked to have trees all around their house. I used one of them to climb down. 

I just needed a way out of town now. Surely the roads would be a mess, but the water wouldn’t. With a hint of a plan in my head I made my way down the streets and towards the water front. 

I thought I heard a female scream but I could have been mistaken. There was no way Jill would have waited that long to give me up. 

When I reached the shoreline I saw what I needed, a speed boat at the fuel station. The owner was inside the shack talking with the deadbeat service provider. 

I could do it, I had to do it. Anyone in my position would do the same. I couldn’t go to jail, I couldn’t give up my money. No, I deserved a future. And if that meant depriving some rich guy of his toy then I morally had no choice. 

It was easier than I had expected, the boat was idling with just a single bow rope holding it. I was halfway across the marina before anyone even noticed. By that point it was too late. 

I felt the breeze in my face, I started to laugh. Despite the odds being against me, despite the system being rigged to hold me down, I had done it. 

I was going to succeed. 

Out of curiosity I opened the glove box, I wanted to know who the previous owner had been. 

Inside was a note, it was hand written on old parchment. 

“Run ye east or west,

never shall you rest. 

My pound of flesh I shall consume, 

Until you, master Josh approach your doom”. 

That damn monkey wasn’t going to let me escape.
