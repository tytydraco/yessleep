“Press 5 to speak with a scheduling coordinator,” the automated voice said.

I hit ‘5.’ The phone paused for a few seconds, then… 

“We’re sorry. There is no one available to take your call. Please stay on the line. A scheduling coordinator will be with you shortly.”

I rested my elbows on the counter, annoyed. I’d been on the phone for ten minutes. Pressing the wrong buttons. Starting over. Listening to each option again and again. 

How hard was it to schedule an ultrasound for a bladder scan? Apparently, impossible. Welcome to healthcare in America.

I checked the time: *12:30 PM.* My lunch break was almost over.

*I could just drive there. Make an appointment in person.* 

I checked the address on my phone. Not far. If I left now, I could be there in five minutes and back for work.

“There is no one available to take your call,” the voice reminded me. “A scheduling coordinator will be with you shortly.”

I hopped in my car and drove across town. In a matter of minutes, I was at the front desk of the imaging center. 

“Can I help you?” The receptionist blinked from behind a plastic screen. 

“Yes. I’ve been on hold for twenty minutes. I need to make an appointment.”

“Sometimes our phone line has issues. Did your doctor refer you?”

“Of course she did.”

“Please don’t get short with me, sir.”

“I’m not being short. I just need an appointment!”

“Sir?” A firm hand gripped my shoulder. It was a six foot three security guard. “You need to keep your voice down."

“My voice is down! Why won’t anyone help me?!”

*Wham.*

The guard shoved my face against the screen.

“Ouch!! What are you…?” 

“You need to learn some manners.”

He twisted my arm behind my back and led me down a hall. 

“What are you doing? This is assault!”

He stopped at a metal door. Punched in a code. And threw me inside. 

The room was almost completely dark.

“No! Wait!”

He shut the door, killing what light the room had. 

*This is insane.*

I reached in my pockets, grabbed my phone. 

“That won’t work in here,” a weary voice said. 

I jerked upright, following the sound.

“Who’s there?”

I activated the device’s flashlight. A hunched figure lingered in the shadows. 

“Show yourself!”

They stepped forward. Their clothes were ragged. Their eyes were sunken like two dark pits. And their lips… chewed away, exposing rotten gums and yellow teeth. 

“Oh god… please… don’t hurt me…”

“Hurt you?” The chewed lips smiled. “There’s no need for that. You’re in the Other Place.”

“The Other Place?”

The figure motioned to the other side of the room. Lights flickered and I realized the space was larger than I anticipated. All along the walls were beds filled with patients. Each person was bound with straps, begging to be set free.

“This is where the healthcare system puts all the patients they don’t care about.” The figure grinned. “Now you’re stuck in here with us. Forever.”

*** 

I must’ve been in there for hours. Slamming my body against the door. My bones ached and my skin bled. 

“It’s hopeless.” The hunched figure croaked. “You must take your place among the forgotten.”

“But I’m not forgotten!”

A floodlight appeared, highlighting an empty bed.

“You’re not listening to me! I don’t belong here!” 

Shuffling footsteps sounded nearby…

… Odd shapes were materializing from the darkness. Maimed faces. Grotesque forms. One body lumbered along on misshapen feet. Another had a bald head and drooling lips, a slackened jaw exposing a swollen tongue.

“No!” I slammed my body against the walls. “Someone… help…”

Then… fluorescent lights. The security guard was in the open doorway, motioning to me.

“You cool?”

“Oh god! Yes! I’ve learned my lesson.”

He plucked me out and sealed the room shut, dusting off his hands.

“The higher-ups decided to give you one more chance. But if you give us any more shit, you go back in and you don’t come out.

“I won’t complain. Not ever.”

“Good.”

He led me down the hall, my exhausted body trailing after him.

“Lobby’s that way.”

I ducked inside and made my way to the front desk. The receptionist glared at me as I approached, my hands folded in front of my stomach, sheepish.

“Can I help you, sir?”

“Yes, I need to schedule an appointment.”

“Our scheduler isn’t here today. You’ll have to call tomorrow.” 

“But… what if no one picks up…”

“Doesn’t matter. You just keep dialing. Eventually, someone will answer.”

I slipped out the automatic doors, headed home.

The next morning, I called the number. The same familiar voice hissed in my ears:

“We’re sorry. There is no one available to take your call. Please stay on the line. A scheduling coordinator should be with you shortly.”
