I’ve just learned a terrible truth: Our world is under attack. By zombies.

Let me start at the beginning:

Grandpa served in WW2. He was eighteen when he enlisted. Grandpa rarely spoke of the war. In fact, I know very little about the man. Until recently. The other day, I received an anonymous package. Inside the package was a dusty, old tape player and cassette. I was shocked. I hadn’t seen a tape deck in years. Reluctantly, I pressed play.

Grandpa’s voice was ravaged by old age. Tears trickled down my face as he spoke. Soon, I was petrified. If what he said is true, then the world is in BIG trouble. I’ve transposed, word for word, what he said.

(Please forgive the crudeness of Grandpa’s speech. He’s extremely old, and he comes from a different era.)

“Nathan, if you’re hearing this, then I’m probably dead. Dead, or dying. Either way, I hope you hear me well. I won’t be going into how this tape came into your possession. So don’t bother asking. In time, you will receive another package. Then you will have no choice but to believe what I’m about to tell you.”

(Random movements, chair squeaking).

“You’ll have to bear with me.”

(Coughing).

“Do you ever get the sense that someone is in the room with you, even when you’re alone? Do you hear your name whispered from nowhere? Or feel that someone, or something, is lurking above your bed while you sleep?

“The answer is probably yes, although your mind may trick itself into saying ‘no’. You’re an adult now. Adults are dull. They lose their sixth sense. Not me. How could I? You see, when I was in the army, a million years ago it would seem, I was captured by the Nazis. Ugh. Rotten bastards.”

(Papers ruffling).

“I was twenty-one. The other prisoners were near-death when I arrived. Our cell was filthy beyond description, with rats as big as German tanks, scurrying across the cold, damp floor. Hmph. Those rats were treated with more dignity than we were. Mostly, I remember the smell. Rotten flesh, feces, sweat and decay. Ugh. Months went by. I was certain to die there. And I almost did. Oh, the horror of it all. But I’ll spare you the gory details.”

(Inaudible).

“Okay, so let’s get to the point, shall we? This isn’t a war story, after all. Unbeknownst to me, the war was ending. The Americans came to the rescue. About time, I may add. Suddenly, the Nazis were nervous. One day, a large wooden crate was dropped into the cell. By now, the other prisoners were dead. It was only me. I…I won’t tell you what I did to survive.”

(Long pause).

“Sometime in the middle of the night, I opened the crate. Took every ounce of strength, it did. I knew this would land me in a whole heap of trouble. But what did I care? Besides, this gave me something to do.

“Inside the crate were paintings. Magnificent treasures. Against my better judgement, I placed some paintings around the cell. Bold, I was. Then I slept. Sometime in the wee hours of the night, I heard a voice:

“ ‘Chester,’ the voice whispered. ‘Psst. Chester!’ ”

It kept repeating my name. Half asleep and sick with malnutrition, I grumbled, telling the guard to eat a turd. Then it poked me. I froze. Someone was lying next to me, cold as a corpse, breathing down my neck. I sat upright, soaring with adrenaline. My hands were clenched, ready to strangle the Nazi scumbag. To my amazement, the cell was empty. Save for the corpses of course, which were buzzing with flies and maggots, and stinking worse than a plague of sewer rats. I shook my weary head, cursing my stupidity, then sucked the sweat from my fingers before returning to sleep. Oh, how horrible those days were.”

(Coughing).

“The voice returned:

“ ‘Chester! Hey, Chester’

“Then I saw it.”

(Long pause).

“It…it came through the painting. I swear to God it did. It was ugly. Repulsive. Like a hideous monster drawn by a child. Its body was simple and small, but its head was huge and full of life, with droopy eyes as wide as fighter planes. Its gaping mouth exposed a pallet of pointed teeth, and a tongue that could smack the smirk right off your face.

“ ‘Chester,’ it said in a grim voice, raising the hair on my arms.

“My heart was racing. I started to convulse. Finally, I found my breath. I was petrified. Not only was a zombie haunting me…um, that’s what they are…more about that later…I didn’t want the guards to hear me. Turns out, they’d split. But how the hell was I to know? I didn’t get the memo.

“When I responded, my voice was thin and weak, and barely recognizable:

“ ‘Whatcha want?’

“Then the most amazing thing happened: The creature flew from the painting and landed on my chest. It made terrible grunting noises, like a dog in heat. When it’s wart-infested tongue touched my chin, I yelped. The damned thing wouldn’t let up. It didn’t take too long before I realized what it was doing: Feeding.

“ ‘Hey, Chester!’ Its icy fingers slid down my spine.

“Anger arrived like a flash of lightning. I went on a warpath, punching and kicking and thrashing about. To my surprise, the creature recoiled. It scurried inside the painting, but continued to stare at me with its all-knowing eyes and disfigured face.

“My mind and body went numb. I must’ve passed out. When I woke up, the damned thing was chomping on me again. Its teeth like tiny razors, stabbing my infected body, as it sucked the life from my soul. Fully enraged, I fought back, scaring it back inside the painting.

“I…I don’t remember much after that. Fortunately, within the coming days or weeks, I was rescued. You can imagine the relief. After spending a month or so in a hospital, I was brought home. The war was over. The fighting finally ceased.

“I found work at a printing shop. It was decent work and it paid the bills. Soon thereafter, I met Helen, your grandmother. Life was good for a while. Then sadly, our first child Michael, died very young. You can imagine the grief. Next came your father.

“When your father was three or four, your grandmother started acting strange. And that’s putting it mildly. She’d burst into a room full of people and start talking gibberish, making up words and senseless phrases. Sometimes she’d be naked, or wearing a lampshade on her head. Twice she tried setting the house on fire. Many such incidents occurred, which I won’t get into. Ultimately, Helen was deemed ‘insane and unfit’ by the doctors, and she was institutionalized.”

(Random noises, possibly weeping).

“Remember, this was a different world, Nathan. You must understand this. Shock therapy was still being administered. Ugh. Over the years, your grandmother’s condition worsened. So much so, that visitors were no longer permitted, including me. I fought like hell, but it was a losing battle. Some years later, I received a letter stating she’d died of ordinary causes. Yeah, right. Anyways, it was just me and your father. Oh, we fought like foes.

“One day, when I arrived home from work, there was a terrible commotion coming from his bedroom. Your father was bawling. The door was locked. Without thinking, I booted down the door. What I saw still haunts me:

“Your father was on the bed, clutching his throat. Eyes like springs popping from his young head; spittle and snot spewing from his cherry-red face. His hair was in disarray, his t-shirt soaked in sweat. His eyes scared me the most. They looked…um…non-human. In them, I saw It. The zombie. Somehow, that ghastly creature found me, and was possessing my boy, like it had done to my wife. Suddenly, things were adding up.

“You see, Nathan, up until then, I’d forgotten about the zombie in the painting. Now suddenly, those memories flooded my mind. It was clear: The zombie was ruining my life. Without hesitating, I pulled your father close, hearing the boy’s heart beat against mine, and told the creature to go away. Or else. I snarled, hissed and moaned. It worked. The air in the room stilled. Your father calmed down. His eyes returned to normal.

“A few years later, I brought this up, seeing if he’d remembered. Your father freaked out, calling me a liar and a terrible father.”

(Sniffles, plus random sounds, which could be him blowing his nose).

“After Helen was cast away, people started talking. The rumors spread like wildfire. People accused me of abusing my wife. Blaming me for her demise. Not only that, your father was bullied mercilessly. Damn near killed the boy. Broke my heart.”

(Sniffles).

“He never forgave me. That’s why I wasn’t around much. He wouldn’t let me near you.”

(Chair squeaking, papers ruffled).

As you may imagine, life got weird. Flickering lights, appliances running themselves, strange voices muttering murderous intentions in the dead of night. Footprints leading to the front door, then vanishing without a trace. Things would disappear. I’d put my car keys on the end table, as I did every night before bed, and they’d vanish. Same with my cigarettes. Usually, they’d wind up in the junk drawer. Don’t get me started on the remote control! Sheesh! 

Eventually, when I could no longer take it, I confided in a pal. Big mistake. I’ll spare you the details, but word got around that I was bat-shit crazy, and me and your father were driven out of town.

“Fortunately, I did find someone to confide in. A colleague. Cathy was her name. She believed me. Cathy was a good worker. Plus, she had no problems with old fogies like me. (Laughs). Now, don’t get the wrong impression. Our friendship was purely platonic. Cathy…um…liked other women. But that’s neither here nor there.”

(Long pause).

“Phew…telling this is harder than I thought.”

(Papers shuffling).

“Cathy was extremely clever. She’d developed these special glasses. With them, she saw what the naked eye could not. These glasses made zombies…or spirits, as she called them…visible. I’ll never forget the first time I tried them on. My head hit the ceiling.

“Those creatures were crowding the office. Cathy’s desk had one living in the grains of the wood. Mine did too. Every painting in the printing shop was possessed. Plus, the couch, the coffee table, the lamp…the radio…you name it. You see, Nathan, those zombies were everywhere, hiding under our very noses, and we never suspected a damn thing.

“Cathy and I would get together on Sundays, drink coffee, and discuss the meaning of all this. She’d go to nightclubs on weekends, where zombies thrive, and tell me stories. Turns out, alcohol is a conduit for the spirit realm. Zombies…true zombies…not the ones in cheesy horror flicks who walk and talk and shoot big guns, thrive off alcohol. Hmph. No wonder they’re called spirits.

“Zombies influence the living. Make us do evil deeds. Make us hurt one another. That’s how they feed. The more misery, the better the meal.

“Now get this: After wearing Cathy’s glasses for a few weeks, our eyes adjusted. Meaning, we started seeing Them without the glasses. Ugh. This is something I could’ve done without, thank-you-very-much. Nearly ruined my life.

“Once, while I was driving home from work, I saw a horrific accident. Traffic was thick. The sun was at that spot where it blinds you. In the lane next to me, was a young man, singing along to the radio. He was fully immersed. Sitting next to him was a zombie. Its claw-like hands were clutching the steering wheel. The creature snarled, then veered suddenly into oncoming traffic. BAM. So many casualties. A tragedy.

“I’ve seen this happen many times. Ugh. No wonder there’s so many car crashes. Those bloodthirsty zombies are causing the crashes. Ruthless, they are. And hungry.”

(Long pause).

“To this day, I don’t have an answer. Those zombies are everywhere. Even trees! Ever look at a tree and see it staring back at you? It is. Chew on that one for a while! Anyways, this was all too much for Cathy, whose heart was as big as an ocean. It ruined her. Eventually, she disappeared, and sadly, I never saw her again.”

(Coughing).

“I…I can’t blame her. If our world is under attack…and it is…by creatures from another dimension, then what’s the point? Oh, how I wish I never learned this terrible truth. But once you see them, you can’t unsee them. Believe me, I’ve tried.

“Mass shootings became rampant. What do you think the real cause of this is? Guns? Hell no. Although they certainly speed up the process. Zombies! Like I said, they’re influencers. And since they’re invisible, they have free rein over us. Once they find a suitable victim…someone depressed or under the influence of drugs and alcohol…or simply in the wrong place at the wrong time…they attack.

“I’ve seen this so many times I’ve lost track. Ugh. Those creatures are the cause of every tragedy. And I still haven’t found a way to stop them. Now, I’m old and dying.”

(A woman’s voice is heard, Grampa shoos her away).

“Now, this is where you come in, Nathan. Maybe you can stop them. Or at the very least, warn others. There must be a way to stop those bastards. Otherwise…”

(Heavy coughing).

“Nathan, I’m dying. Don’t worry about that. I should’ve been dead long ago. I’m older than dirt. Death will be a relief. But before I go, I’ll let you in on a secret:

“This hospital is Zombie Headquarters. They all are, in fact. Anyways, I’ve befriended one. Hot damn, I did! Goes by the name Hugo. Hugo told me things. First off, zombies can, in fact, eat human food. But only if it’s offered to them. Problem is, who the hell would do that? They’re invisible, for starters. And evil. But believe you me, they’ll do anything for pie and ice cream. Anything. Because of this, I’ve managed to turn Hugo into an ally. I leave him offerings every night, and he tells me things. Terrible things. The more he tells me, the more he gets fed.”

(Loud thud, probably from hands hitting table).

“Remember this, Nathan! This could be useful. If only I’d learned this when I was your age.”

(Coughing and hacking, followed by the female voice, presumably a nurse).

“I’d better hurry. Not much time left. Apparently…this is coming from Hugo’s own words…those zombies come from the spirit realm. There are many types of spirits, but zombies are the worst. And they’re waging war with humanity!

“That’s why this world is in such a wretched state. Those unholy beings are influencing the politicians. Making them do terrible deeds. Not only politicians, but anyone with influence. This is true, Nathan. But don’t take my word on it. Soon, you’ll see for yourself.”

(Shuffling noises).

“Uh oh, here comes the nurse. I must go now. Hope I said enough. And Nathan…I…I…love you boy. Always have. Be brave. And remember: They’re as afraid of you, as you are…or will be…of them!”

(End of recording)

…

Three weeks later, a package arrived. Sure enough, inside the tightly sealed box was a pair of peculiar-looking spectacles. The left lens was normal glass. The right lens, on the other hand, was deep purple, and coated with something peculiar. Needless to say, the moment I put them on my life changed.
For the worse.

I leapt from the couch, my heart beating like a hammer. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Attached to my bedroom door was a plague of zombies. The largest (and meanest-looking) was staring at me. It had a big, bushy beard with a heavyset jaw and strict eyebrows, and was wearing what appeared to be a cowboy hat. Above it was an alien-shaped head with square eyes and licorice lips. It snarled at me.

There were others. I had to turn away. My mind couldn’t handle it. In haste, I removed the glasses. But the fear remained. Although I couldn’t see them, I certainly could feel them. How did I not notice this before? When something touched my shoulder, I nearly died. Then I heard my name, although my apartment was empty.

“Nathan,” the voice whispered, mockingly. “Naaaathan.”

The glasses quickly returned to my face. I gasped. My gym bag was looking back at me. It too was possessed. This creature had sad, droopy eyes and a Tom Waits’ style bowler hat. It hissed. Scared beyond belief, I crept backwards, until my back was pressed against the wall.

Grandpa was right. They’re everywhere. Clinging to furniture, stuck in the sofa, hidden in tables and chairs, attached to the TV. My tie-dye tapestry was infested. I stopped counting at twenty-five. Disturbing thoughts crowded my eggshell mind, as I pretended to sleep.

The following day I got the phone call.

Grandpa had died.

…

They’re watching me. Even as I’m typing this. Currently, a pocket-size demon with empty eyes and horns attached to its wobbly head, is staring back at me from my computer screen. It just winked.

I’m terrified. Worse, I feel helpless. I see Grandpa’s conundrum. Who do I confide in? Who would believe me? I have no answers. So, after another sleepless night on the creature-infused couch, I’ve decided to turn to the good people of Reddit. I’ll leave you with Grandpa’s story. Maybe someone out there will know what to do. Yes, Cathy’s glasses remain. But what good are they?

I mean, how do we prevent the impending Zombie apocalypse?
