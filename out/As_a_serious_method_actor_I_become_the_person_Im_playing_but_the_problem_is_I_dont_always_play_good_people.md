“This is going to be your breakout role. This is going to make you a star,” my agent said as he handed me the script. “I have heard of this guy. He dies of Aids, right?” My agent leaned back in his chair as he beamed his usual smug smile. “Look what Philadelphia did for Tom Hanks. You are perfect for this role.” 

I flipped through the script, skimming the pages. The character was a struggling artist, something I could relate to. He was full of life until the disease took everything from him. 

“You know how these Oscar-bait films go,” my agent said. “Gut-wrenching performance. Raw emotion. You lose a little weight, shed a few tears on camera, and boom, awards season buzz.” 

I took a big sigh, still staring at the script. “You make it sound easy.” 

“That’s because for you it is,” he said, grinning. “Face it, you don’t just play characters, you become them. That’s why people are starting to pay attention.” 

He wasn’t wrong. The tabloids had a field day with my last role as an abusive husband, calling me unstable, obsessive, and dangerous. Maybe they weren’t entirely wrong. By the time filming wrapped, my girlfriend had walked out, claiming she couldn’t recognize me anymore. That I had become the cruel, volatile man I was playing. 

I handed the script back to my agent. “How far do you think I’ll have to go for this one?” 

“Far enough to make them believe,” my agent said. “Far enough to make them feel it.” 

I closed my eyes and exhaled. “Alright,” I said. “I’m in.” 

   
The weeks leading up to filming felt like a slow descent into something inevitable. I spent hours studying the character watching old interviews, reading about the early days of the AIDS crisis, and memorizing every line, every detail. I lost weight and avoided mirrors whenever I could. 

But before I fully became him, I needed one last night as myself. 

I met up with James, an old friend and fellow actor, at a quiet restaurant downtown. He smiled as I sat down.  

“So,” he said, raising his glass. “Who are you going to be this time?  

I smirked, but it felt forced. “Daniel Hayes. Painter. Diagnosed with AIDS in the late ‘80s. Dies before thirty.” 

James’s smile disappeared. “Jesus. Heavy role but if anyone can pull it off it's you.” James watched me for a long moment, then sighed. “I just don’t want to see you go too deep again.” 

I smiled, trying to shake off the unease creeping up my spine. “Deep is where the good performances come from.” 

“Yeah,” James muttered, finishing his drink. “But what happens when you can’t come back up?” 

I didn’t answer. I just drained my own glass, feeling the warmth slide down my throat before calling for the check. 

Outside, the night felt colder than it should have. As I walked away, James called after me. 

“Just promise me one thing,” he said. “When this is over, you’ll still be you.”  

Filming started with the usual energy, early morning call times, endless takes, and the hustle and bustle of the crew making sure everything was in place. For them, it was just a job, but for me, it was much more. 

I had shed myself completely. I wasn’t me anymore. I moved like the character, spoke like him, thought like him. I let his fears, his pain, and his desperation seep into my bones. 

The first few weeks passed in a blur, but somewhere in the second month, I started to feel off. A sore throat at first. A dull ache in my joints. Nothing serious, nothing I hadn’t pushed through before. But by week five, I was exhausted all the time. My skin was pale, my cheeks hollow. 

“You alright, man?” one of the crew members asked after a take. “You look kinda rough.” 

I shrugged him off. “It’s nothing, it’s just the process.” 

But then came the cough, that became a constant clawing at my chest. But when the fever set in, burning through me in waves, I couldn’t pretend anymore. The doctor on set diagnosed it as pneumonia. 

“Your immune system is shot,” he told me, shaking his head. “You need to rest.” 

But I couldn’t. Because the person I was playing wouldn’t. And the sicker I got, the more real the performance became. 

I pushed through the sickness like I always did. The weight loss? Perfect for the role. The night sweats? Added authenticity. The constant exhaustion? I used it, and let it seep into every line I delivered. 

By the time we hit the final stretch of filming, my body was a wreck. I barely had the strength to stand between takes. My cough rattled in my chest. My skin had taken on a sickly, greyish pallor. 

It was beyond method acting now. I wasn’t playing the character anymore. I was him. 

The crew whispered about me when they thought I couldn’t hear. The director asked if I needed time off, but I refused. I’d come too far. Then came the moment I couldn’t ignore. 

One morning, I woke up gasping for air, my chest so tight it felt like something was crushing me. My sheets were drenched in sweat, and my limbs were too weak to move. When I looked in the mirror, the man staring back wasn’t just sick, he was dying. 

When James came to visit the set, the moment he saw me his face went pale. “Dude, what the hell? You look like death warmed up. You look like someone with Aids”  

The thought sent a cold shiver through me. 

“You need a doctor,” James said firmly. 

I wanted to argue, but I couldn’t. I was too frail, too weak to pretend anymore. 

The doctor ran test after test, his frown deepening with each result. When he finally came back, his face was unreadable. 

“You’re not just sick,” he said slowly. “You tested positive for HIV.” 

I let out a short, breathless laugh. “That’s not possible.” 

But deep down, I think already knew the truth. 

Filming wrapped on a cold, grey afternoon. My final scene was the character's death, frail, breathless, lost in a hospital bed. When the director called cut, something inside me unclenched like I had been holding my breath for months without realizing it. 

Within days, my health began to change. The fever vanished. My cough eased. My strength returned so quickly that it didn’t make sense. 

I barely had time to process it before James dragged me back to the doctor. 

The same tests. The same waiting. 

When the results came in, the doctor looked at me like I was a ghost. 

“This… doesn’t make sense,” he murmured. “The virus is gone. It’s like you were never sick at all.” 

James let out a nervous laugh, clapping my shoulder. “Guess you’re a miracle, man.” 

But I wasn’t so sure. 

The film premiered months later, and it was huge. Critics called it a masterpiece. My performance was hailed as “devastatingly real.” When I won my first Oscar, the cameras flashed, the world cheered, and for the first time, I was seen. 

The offer came in the same way they always did, through my agent, with the same pitch about how this was going to be the role that cemented me as a legend. But this time, he wasn’t just selling a part. He was selling a transformation. 

“This is your Joker moment,” he said, sliding the script across the table. “A real deep dive into the mind of a killer. The kind of role that turns actors into icons.” 

I barely heard him. I was already flipping through the pages, drawn to the dark, twisted words on the script’s worn pages. Raymond Vance was a brutal serial killer who terrorized the city in the late ‘90s. The film was loosely based on his supposed crimes, supposed because no bodies were ever found. 

I leaned back in my chair. “How real are we talking?” 

My agent’s grin widened. “We’re going for complete immersion. Real locations. Real crime scene details. The works.” 

My heart pounded. This was what I lived for. “I’m in,” I beamed. 

From the moment filming began, something felt different. Usually, my process took weeks, slowly letting go of myself and stepping into the character’s skin. But this time, Raymond came easily. Too easily. 

I started wearing his clothes off-set. I spoke in his voice when I wasn’t filming. I found myself drawn to dark alleys, watching as women roamed vulnerable and alone at night. 

Then the blackouts started. 

The first time, I woke up in my apartment, my hands aching as if I had punched something hard. My knuckles were raw, and bruised. 

The second time, I was in my car, parked on an unfamiliar street at 3 a.m., my heartbeat thrumming with adrenaline. There were dark smears on my jeans. I told myself it was dirt. 

But by the third time, I knew I couldn’t lie to myself anymore. I woke up in my bathtub, fully clothed, my fingers curled around a bloodstained knife. I didn’t remember where it came from or what I did with it. 

I tried to shake it off. I told myself it was just exhaustion, that I was too deep into the role. That was until I saw the news reports. 

A young woman was found brutally murdered last night. The crime bears striking similarities to the infamous Raymond Vance killings from the late ‘90s. 

My stomach twisted. The details they described, the positioning of the body, the method of the kill, it was all in the script. At first, I convinced myself it was a coincidence. But then, a second murder. And a third. Each scene pulled straight from the pages of the movie. Each victim killed exactly how I had acted it out. 

I stopped sleeping. The terrified faces of women haunted my dreams, their voices echoing in my mind. Pleading, screaming, dying. Was I doing this? 

I had no memory of ever holding a knife outside of the set. But the blood, the blackouts, the way I was drawn to places I had never been before but felt familiar. I had to find out the truth. There was only one person who could give me answers. The real Raymond Vance. 

I pulled every string I could to arrange a visit to the maximum-security prison where he had spent the last twenty years. The guards led me into a cold, sterile room. The man on the other side of the glass was thinner than I expected, his eyes sunken but still alive with something knowing. 

When he saw me, he smirked. “Well, well,” he said, leaning forward. “Looks like I’ve got a fan.” 

I swallowed hard. “I need to ask you something.” 

“Let me guess,” he said, tapping a finger against the glass. “You’re playing me in that fancy little movie they’re making.” 

I nodded. 

His smirk deepened. “And now you’re wondering if I really did it,” he asked 

“Something is happening to me. If you didn’t kill those girls, then who did? I see them every time I close my eyes.” 

I clenched my fists. “I need the truth. Did you kill those women?” 

Raymond leaned back and laughed. “I’ve told them for twenty years I never killed anyone. No bodies. No proof.” He spread his hands. “But someone must’ve done it, huh? And now here you are. Acting out murders that could have happened or didn’t happen. Or maybe you're the killer.” 

My stomach twisted. Was it possible? Had I somehow become the thing I was pretending to be? Raymond leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. 

“You’re not acting anymore.” 

I left the prison with my head spinning. Maybe Raymond was manipulating me. Maybe he was lying. But what if he wasn’t? What if I really was responsible for those women’s deaths? 

As filming commenced the blackouts became more frequent. Terrified faces of women plagued my mind each one different every time I came to. Then, one night, I found myself driving aimlessly through the city. My fingers angrily gripped the steering wheel. I felt a hatred rise from deep within me. I needed to release this ugliness and that's when I saw her. 

 

She was walking alone, her face vaguely familiar. Then it clicked, she was an actress. Someone I had worked with years ago. I pulled up beside her and rolled down the window. “Hey, need a ride?” 

She hesitated. Then recognition flickered in her eyes. “Hey! Oh my god, I haven’t seen you in forever.” 

I smiled. “Come on, I’ll drive you home.” 

We chatted as we drove through the city, the young woman oblivious to my murderous thoughts. I could sense the unease radiate from her once she realised, we were travelling in the wrong direction. We had left behind the bright lights of the city, and I kept driving until I came to a secluded spot deep into the woods.  I had never been there before but had seen it a thousand times in my dreams. By now she was physically distraught. She knew the moment I pulled off the road what my intentions were.  

“Where are we?” She cried. 

I gripped the wheel, my heart hammering. 

She turned to me, her eyes wide. “You’re scaring me.” 

I swallowed hard. I didn’t remember deciding to hurt her. But my hands were already moving, reaching for her. She screamed and began fighting harder than I expected, scratching, clawing, kicking. Somehow, she broke free and ran from the car. 

I wanted to chase her, but I just sat there, breathless, staring at the dark woods around me. I was in a daze, not quite sure if I was dreaming or if I had imagined the whole thing. 

The next day, I was back on set, pretending none of it had happened. But I didn’t have to pretend for long. 

Halfway through filming, the set was swarmed with detectives and armed officers. The young woman was real, and she went to the police. She told them everything that had happened. I didn’t even resist. I barely even reacted as they shoved me into cuffs, before telling me I was wanted for attempted murder. 

My head was spinning as they interrogated me. I admitted to taking the woman into the woods, but I swore I had never killed anyone as I sat in the cold, windowless room. 

The detective across from me leaned in, close. 

“You want to tell me about what we found out there?” 

I swallowed hard. “I’m not sure what you are talking about.” 

His lips curled slightly, almost like he expected me to say that. “See, that’s the problem. Because what we found...” He reached for a file and slid a photo across the table. “That’s a lot of bodies, son.” 

I looked down, and my stomach heaved. The image showed a mass grave. Bones stacked upon bones. Some were wrapped in plastic, others nothing more than brittle, decayed remains. 

I felt like I was going to be sick. 

“I didn’t do this,” I whispered. 

The detective gave a slow nod, feigning understanding. “Okay. Then explain this.” 

Another photo landed in front of me. 

My knife, blood-stained and pulled from the dirt with my fingerprints all over it. 

“We dug this up with one of the bodies,” the detective said. “And the blood on it? That’s human.” He folded his arms. “So, tell me, how does your knife end up buried with a victim if you didn’t put it there?” 

I shook my head, my pulse roaring in my ears. “It doesn’t make sense.” 

“Doesn’t it?” His tone was sharp now. “You’re telling me it’s just coincidence that you led that woman to the exact spot where we found a serial killer’s personal graveyard?” He leaned closer. “That your knife just happened to be buried with one of the bodies?” The detective leaned in close and looked me dead in the eye. “We’ll see what the jury thinks.” 

The trial was a media circus. 

Oscar-winning actor turned a real-life monster. 

The headlines sold the story better than the movie ever could. They painted me as unhinged. A method actor who went too far. A man who let the role consume him until he wasn’t acting anymore.  

My lawyer tried to argue that it was impossible. That it didn’t make sense. That I was being framed. 

But then Raymond Vance took the stand. He was a free man now. No physical evidence had ever linked him to the killings. And now, all the bodies were tied to me. 

He sat there, looking at me. Studying me. And then he said the words that sealed my fate: 

"I spent years locked away for crimes I didn’t commit. And now, the real killer has finally been found." 

It took the jury six hours to convict me. As they led me away in cuffs, Raymond's eyes et with mine as he smiled at me like he had been waiting for this moment all along. 

Raymond Vance sat in a darkened room. He got up and adjusted the telly making sure it was loud enough. He turned to the woman he had bound and gagged to a chair before pulling out a sharp knife. He moved over behind her before making the woman stare at the screen. He slid the knife under her chin and leaned down close. “Can you believe they made a movie about me?” The woman tried to scream but it was muffled by the gag in her mouth. “Ssh, this is my favourite part. This is where I kill the girl.”
