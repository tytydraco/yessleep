The Whispering Woods

It started as a dare.

Maggie, Dylan, and Sam stood at the edge of the Whispering Woods, a place surrounded by legends. Locals warned that no one who entered after sunset ever came back the same—if they came back at all. The whispers of those lost were said to call out from the trees, luring anyone foolish enough to step inside. But teenagers rarely heed warnings, especially when beer and bravado are involved.

“Come on, Maggie,” Dylan teased, nudging her with his elbow. “It’s just trees. Are you scared of a bunch of fairy tales?”

“I’m not scared,” Maggie snapped, though the hair on her arms prickled as the first shadow of dusk stretched across the forest floor. “It’s just… stupid.”

“Then prove it,” Sam grinned. His flashlight clicked on, casting a sharp beam into the darkened woods. “We’ll go in, stay for an hour, and come back. Easy.”

With a nervous laugh, Maggie followed her friends into the forest. The moment they crossed the threshold, the air changed. It was colder, damp, and the faint scent of rot clung to the breeze. The sounds of crickets and rustling leaves faded, replaced by an eerie silence.

They walked in deeper, their chatter dwindling. Maggie noticed how the trees seemed impossibly tall, their twisted branches clawing at the sky. The deeper they went, the thicker the canopy grew, until no moonlight seeped through. It was just the flashlights now, weak and flickering.

And then they heard it.

A whisper.

Maggie froze. “Did you hear that?”

“Hear what?” Dylan asked, though his voice was strained.

“Shhh.”

It came again, faint but unmistakable, like someone murmuring just out of reach. Maggie’s heart thudded in her chest. It wasn’t the wind. It wasn’t an animal.

“Maybe it’s just the trees,” Sam joked, but his laugh was shaky.

The whisper grew louder, overlapping voices that seemed to come from everywhere at once. The words were incomprehensible, but the tone was unmistakable—desperate, pleading.

Dylan pointed his flashlight toward the sound, and they all saw it.

A figure stood just ahead, barely visible between the trees. It looked human but wrong. Its limbs were too long, bending at unnatural angles. Its head tilted sharply to the side, as though its neck had been broken.

“Who’s there?” Dylan called, his voice cracking.

The figure didn’t respond. It simply… moved. Not forward, not backward, but side to side, swaying unnaturally like a pendulum.

Maggie took a step back, and her foot snapped a twig. The sound echoed, and suddenly, the whispering stopped.

The figure turned its head toward them, its face hidden in shadow. Then it screamed.

It wasn’t a human scream—it was a high-pitched, guttural shriek that vibrated through the trees and into their bones. The sound sent Dylan and Sam sprinting back the way they came, but Maggie couldn’t move. She was frozen, staring into the void where the figure had been.

“Maggie!” Dylan yelled, grabbing her arm and pulling her with him.

The forest seemed to close in on them as they ran. Branches clawed at their skin, roots seemed to grab at their feet, and the whispers returned, louder and more frenzied.

Then Sam tripped.

“Leave him!” Dylan shouted, but Maggie couldn’t. She turned back, her flashlight shaking as she pointed it toward Sam.

He was on the ground, but he wasn’t alone. The figure was above him, crouching on all fours, its head impossibly close to his face. Its eyes were empty sockets, and its mouth stretched open far too wide.

Maggie screamed, and the figure turned to her. For a moment, it hesitated, as if studying her. Then, with a sickening crack, it disappeared into the shadows, leaving Sam writhing on the ground.

Maggie grabbed his arm, yanking him to his feet. They ran together, following Dylan’s fading flashlight beam until they finally broke through the treeline.

But something was wrong.

Sam was quiet. Too quiet. Maggie turned to him, still clutching his arm. “Are you okay?”

He didn’t respond. His face was pale, his eyes wide and unblinking.

“Dylan,” Maggie called, but when she looked for him, he wasn’t there.

She spun around, her flashlight darting through the trees. They had just been running together. Hadn’t they?

The whispering began again, closer now. Maggie’s breath hitched as she realized the whispers weren’t coming from the forest.

They were coming from Sam.

His lips were moving, but his eyes remained fixed and empty. The whispers poured out of him, overlapping and nonsensical, growing louder and louder until they weren’t whispers at all—they were screams.

Maggie stumbled back, and Sam’s head jerked toward her, his mouth twisting into a grotesque grin.

“Run,” he said, though his voice wasn’t his own. It was layered, echoing, filled with malice.

And then the forest swallowed the light.

The next morning, the townspeople found Maggie at the edge of the woods, rocking back and forth, her flashlight dead in her hands.

Sam and Dylan were never found.

But the whispers in the woods grew louder. And sometimes, on quiet nights, you can still hear Maggie screaming.
