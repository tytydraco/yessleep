I don’t know exactly when it started. But I remember when it changed—when something in me shifted from confusion to dread, from curiosity to outright fear.

It was about two weeks ago. I’d had a long day at work—nothing unusual, just the typical grind. I got home around nine, threw my keys on the counter, and collapsed onto the couch. I cracked open a beer, reached for the remote, and glanced out the window.

That’s when I saw him.

A clown.

Just… standing there in the backyard. Motionless.

He didn’t look like a regular clown. Not the goofy party type, not even the creepy movie kind. He looked wrong. Like something out of time, like he belonged to another century entirely. His costume was a faded mess of red and white fabric, with oversized buttons that looked like they were stitched on by hand. The ruffles around his neck were torn and stained. And that face—it wasn’t painted. It looked like a porcelain mask, pale and cracked, stretched into a smile that was far too wide. The eyes were black holes.

He didn’t move. He didn’t flinch when I stepped closer to the window. He just stood between the cherry tree and the old shed, facing the house.

I figured it had to be a prank. Some Halloween leftover, maybe a neighbor’s twisted joke. I went out with a flashlight. Called out. Told him to get the hell off my property. No reaction.

He stayed for exactly seven minutes. I counted.

And then, without a word, without turning around, he walked away. Backwards. Slowly. Into the hedge and out of sight.

I didn’t sleep that night.

He came back the next evening. Same time: 9:13 PM. Like clockwork. Same spot. Same seven minutes.

And the next night.
And the next.

I set up an old security cam facing the yard. Footage showed him appearing suddenly—one frame he wasn’t there, next frame he was. Always the same: frozen, silent, staring. And then gone.

By the fifth night, he began to move.

Just a tilt of the head at first.
Then a wave.

It wasn’t a greeting. It was slow and deliberate. Like he was mocking me. Like he knew I was watching.

His grin got wider, somehow. I don’t know how that’s even possible, but it did. His mouth looked stretched, torn at the corners. And behind that impossible smile… teeth. So many.

I called the cops. Twice. First time they came, looked around, found nothing. No footprints. No signs anyone had been there. Second time, they didn’t even bother showing up. Told me on the phone to “get some rest.”

Then came night nine.

I saw him in the reflection of the patio door. Not outside—inside. Just for a second. But it was enough. His grin had grown. His skin looked… tighter, like it was barely holding together.

I started locking every door, every window. Sitting in the dark, knife in hand, lights off, praying he’d stay outside.

But last night—he didn’t come to the yard.

I almost felt relief. Almost.

Until I heard the floorboards creak upstairs.
Until the hallway light flickered on by itself.
Until I heard the laugh.

Not loud. Not cheerful.
It was low. Wet. Like something gurgling from a drain.

I ran to my bedroom and locked the door. Sat there all night, barely breathing.

Now it’s night fourteen. 9:12 PM.

There’s no one in the backyard. I checked. Twice.
But I hear the stairs again.

He’s inside.
Closer.

And now—he’s knocking on my bedroom door.

He doesn’t say a word.
He doesn’t have to.

Because somehow, I know:

If I open it…
I won’t be the same ever again.
