Its still hard to make sense of this. The following is a collection of diary entries I made from last year to get a grasp of my sanity. To give you a brief introduction. I was in a very dark place last year. I was trapped at a soul crushing job working at a hospital. I would be attacked by patients and my co-workers verbally abused me. I was fighting with my partner often about money. All of this destroyed my mental health. I would cry myself to sleep many nights and hope not to wake up. I would question my sanity everyday. To keep track of the days I decided to start writing these entries. Some of the names I can not say because of patient confidentiality.

He (NL) attacked me today. My hand is cut up, I was able to clean up the blood but it still hurts. I went to the walk in after my shift to make sure my hand isn't infected. They said I'll be okay. But still, why did he attack me today? I thought we had a good relationship. I understand he's a special needs child but now my hand is fucked up. I better get some good scar money for this. I could really use the extra money.

NL tried to attack me again today. I guess I'm his target for the week. Sometimes these patients will lock in on a staff member and go after them for a few days. Still its been so difficult. I hate this job. I can't wait to finish up school in the spring. I am hoping I can find a new career unless this hospital kills me...haha

Natalie and I got into a big fight tonight. She still says I'm not giving enough to our relationship. I'm not working enough and we're behind on bills. I can't pick up anymore shifts at the hell hole of a hospital. I know we're behind on bills but I just don't know how to get more work when no one will hire me and my current place of work is killing me...I called a suicide hotline. I just couldn't handle anything anymore. Dying made sense to me but I didn't think it would be fair to kill myself over these issues. The call was awkward, I was crying while talking to a stranger about my most personal struggles.

I'm off this weekend. The sad part is I'm not even happy. My mind just goes to how I'm working next weekend...that job has killed my joy even when I'm not working I'm still thinking about how I have to go back on Monday. this is pathetic.

I haven't written anything in a week. I've just been too busy. We are planning a party for the 4th. Unfortunately I will be working that day. Its my holiday on. I can't wait to leave this place.

Natalie's party went well. She enjoyed some fireworks and spent a great day with her friends. Work for me was a drag. That bastard that cut my hand up was crying because I wasn't assigned to work with him today. I have never been so happy to see a kid cry. Is that cruel of me? I honestly don't think so. This kid is pure evil. I don't care about his tragic backstory anymore. He's a bastard.

Natalie and I got into a big fight. She called me a lying pussy because I didn't apply to any new places in the last few days. I locked myself in the bathroom and started slamming my head against the wall. I knocked myself out and woke up in the hospital. Natalie must have called the ambulance. I told the doctors what had happened and I'm being sent away to a crisis unit to make sure I don't kill myself.  I'm so confused she knows I hate where I work. I just haven't been able to get a hold of my life.
