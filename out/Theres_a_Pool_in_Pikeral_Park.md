My entire life changed in high school. Some people got a deeper voice, a few inches, and a scholarship to an impressive college. I got a broken home. My last year at Rythm Heights, for a long time, was something that needed to be relegated behind the doors of a therapist's office rather than a yearbook to look back on.

Until I went to Pikeral Park.

"Everyone is going after midnight tonight. You in?" Dylan asked.

"You know parks are open during the day," I said as I closed the steel door of my locker, half paying attention to him. The rest of my focus dedicated to a Calc finale I was woefully unprepared for."

Dylan rolled his eyes and elbowed me.

"Dude. Two words: Amber Rothaus." He then pantomimed an hourglass figure as if that meant something.

"The girl who has wanted nothing to do with you since junior year?"

"The very same." He wrapped an arm around me. "Until I slipped her some beautiful poetry straight from the heart that made her *swoon*."

"That's an odd way to say: 'Thank you, Scott, for making me sound less like a creep'."

"What I had before was from my very core..."

 "Ten mentions about how great she looks from behind? People don't immediately think of where you sit in Spanish class, dude."

"Anyway," He coughed to move on. "We've been texting since last Saturday and really hit off. Your wingman-ship and my silver tongue secured us an invite a sick ass party."

I raised an eyebrow at that. "...At a park. At midnight?"

"A *haunted* park at midnight, Scottie." I hated it when he called me Scottie. "It's the one where that Clemmens kid went missing."

I parked myself at the door of Mr. O'Reilly's Calculus class. "And you think that lovely background is going to get you an award-winning hand job from Amber?"

Dylan whistled. The scar on his bottom lip, the one he got back in the third grade from running headfirst into a flagpole, winked at me with the same lack of subtlety as his eyes. Given what he was saying, he was still the spitting image of that kid who loved to run Mach 3 into a broken face.

"I am appalled at your crass assumption of such a lady. I am a gentleman, Scottsman. I aim only for second base during a first meeting of lips," he said, marching toward our seats in the back of the class.

I sat down and unpacked my things. As I prepared to carve off another chunk of my GPA, Dylan leaned over to me, whispering to avoid Mr. O'Reilly’s Oscar worthy ass chewings.

"Before you cop an excuse, you are going. I need a homie there, and we both know you need this."

I shot him a glare, it was all Dylan needed to kill that line of thought.  He put his hands up in a defensive stance, expecting me to box him.

"All right, all right. But you know I got a point."

I didn't know that. At the time, I was convinced of everything but. Dylan had spent too much energy convincing me of what I needed lately. The only thing I knew for certain, was my best friend was becoming a real pain in the ass; even if a well-intended one.

And yet, I found myself ready at eleven that night, zipping up my hoodie and making my way towards a party that, at best, got my best friend laid. I didn't even want to consider the worst case. Some things are better left as surprises.

What was no surprise was where I found Dad lying that night. His usual spot, half-dozing on the dining room table. A bottle of cheap scotch drained dry. If he was on schedule, he’d been there since work and hadn’t eaten anything. The thought dawned on me as I threw the couch’s throw over him. Most people on their way to this party had to forge cover-up stories to make it, and all I had to do was cover up my dad. Just in the hopes he wouldn't freeze after he crashed onto the tile floor mid-stupor.  

Before I left, I put a glass of water on the table, tossed the meatloaf I made yesterday into the microwave, picked up a Sharpie, and wrote instructions on his limp arm.

"*Went out. Dinner in Mic-wv*"

I cringed as I ran out of room. Then, the buried part of me spoke out. I meant to think it, but spoke it as I loomed over him.

“Fuck it. You’ll figure it out.”

"Night, Dad," I said after a moment of guilt. I patted him on the back and was on my way.

Dylan and I got there about twenty minutes late. His idea. He insisted show times were for suckers. As we rolled up to Pikeral Park, killing Tears for Fears as they demanded we abandon Mother Nature, I thought Dylan might have underestimated how seriously other people might take a rule like his.

The scene was dead. There were maybe fifteen people. All clustered around a couple of barrel fires like a homeless encampment. The rest of the place didn't fare much better. The park was a scab of West Texas dirt, itching the skin of some emaciated pine woods, one cigarette away from a Burning Man impression. And yet, the off-beat reggae blaring out of some crappy, base heavy, Bluetooth speaker was the worst part.

I looked at Dylan.

"Looks like we are early," he said.

"Dude."

"Okay, okay. But the real party is at the lake in the back. There are probably more people there."

"Lake? You said it was a pool."

Dylan shrugged. "Just what it's called, man. You know, Camelot and shit."

"Right. The famous story of King Arthur and the Lady of the *Pool*."

Dylan opened the door. "Never heard it. Too busy listening to the Dillweed in the Subaru Outback. Would you just get out of the car?"

We sauntered up and, in moments, Dylan locked onto his goal.

"Miss Rothaus, I presume?" He said, shouting from afar. Once we made it to Amber’s little huddle, he leaned over the beer keg in the center and proffered his hand so he that might kiss hers. Riley, Amber’s best friend, grimaced in disgust–an appropriate reaction. The other three dudes I didn't know exchanged bemused glances. Amber, though, wore an ear-to-ear grin wider than I had ever seen.

"Oh, *darling*," She said, flicking her dusky blonde hair over her shoulder and twirling some imaginary pearls. "Long how I’ve awaited your arrival."

"Exquisitely, I’m sure, madame."

As Dylan went on with his horrid pageantry, I wandered over to the side of the group to get some distance. I could almost hear my internal Geiger Counter for cringe quieting as I did. The tallest of the gaggle, a guy with an X-Men Letterman Jacket, strapped tight over an athletic build, stuck a hand out to me as I approached.

"Sup, man. I'm Tomas. That's Dean and Rick."

Dean was a short and stocky guy with a stapled-on smile, clearly blazed out of his mind. Rick was a spectacled fellow with straight slicked-back hair, a short-sleeved button-up, and astute eyes. I'm pretty sure he was our school's photographer, or maybe a pre-bite Peter Parker.

They both threw me some nods, and I gave them my name in exchange.

 "You want a beer?" Tomas asked, offering me a red solo cup.

"I'm good. Not a fan, honestly." Someone had to be sober in my family. Part of my brain lingered on Dad for a moment, wondering if he made it into his bed tonight or if he was drooling, or puking, all over the kitchen tile.

"You smoke?" Dean wheezed out, confirming my assessment of him. I declined again, killing all conversation. Two swift strokes and I had become the D.A.R.E. counselor.

Before we could all sit around in silence like a group of husbands abandoned by our wives at a BBQ, Riley chimed in with a look of utter disgust still on her face. At least, I believe it was disgust. She was hard to discern in the dark. She wore all black and had midnight pitch hair. Her skin was a dusky olive color and melded with the shadows seamlessly. Had it not been for her emerald eyes, I would have lost her in the night.

"They were cute for ten seconds, but now I am gonna’ be sick." She gestured to Dylan and Amber, who didn’t seem halfway done with their horrid play.

"I think it's funny," Rick said.

"That's because you are a theater nerd," Dean said, passing his joint to Riley, who took a drag with such familiarity, it was like she asked him to roll it for her.

"Y'all got no chill," Tomas laughed.

"I don't think I can watch that anymore," I said. "Why don't we go check out this 'pool'?"

"Great idea," Dylan shouted, bursting into the group, hooking Riley and I into her pits.

"Shall I lead the way... to our *doom*?" He said, fingers wiggling. Only Dean and Amber laughed. Both of them were delirious in their own way, I suppose.

As I trailed the cluster, a lead weight dropped into my stomach. Not an uncommon phenomenon that year. Each passing day, the weight lessened–or I got more used to it, but now and again, it would hit. My legs would turn to fresh forged iron; heavy and fragile, flimsy and scathing. To move was to suffer. So much of me wanted to crash into the dirt but, like always, I put it on the shelf of my mind and marched on, even when it was difficult enough to hurt. There was too much to do and too many people who would see.

Except that didn't solve it like before. The weight persisted. A bad smell in the air. A corpse was unearthed. Something real. Tangible. Foul. I scanned the tree line; convinced something was in wait, watching. Each snap of a twig and rustle of leaves pinged around my head as if it were happening right in the canals of my skull.

Then, I saw it.

A blob of shadow, innocuous save for its isolation atop a branch, silhouetted by the crooked moon behind. At first, it was just a mass of shadow I had convinced myself I was characterizing. Laundry in the corner of a dark room that morphs into a serial killer. But right as I started to turn, two beads of piercing yellow opened from the center of the shadow.

Trained right on me.

Then, as if a stray piece of wind kidnapped some long-forgotten syllable, a hoarse sound funneled into my ears.

"*...you...*"

"What?"

"I said, How are you feeling—"

"Jesus!" I yelped, muffling it into a whisper as the word burst from my lips. I turned to see Riley, recoiled in shock.

"Sorry," she chuckled.

I snapped my head back to the tree. No eyes. And, as if in response to my fears, the wind brushed it. The confusing mass that had glared at me rustled into individual leaves. It was only a tree branch.

*But that voice...*

I let out a sigh. "No, I'm sorry. I think I am seeing things."

"I bet. You are probably stressed out of your mind."

"What'd you mean?"

Then there was a pause. A hesitation only those with pity to spare wear. Ahead, Dylan was locked in arms with Amber. Chatting. Joking. He looked at her and no one else. But I knew the side of his eye was on me. I should have known better. He had told Amber, who had told Riley, and now I was the Make-a-Wish kid who didn't know they had cancer.

"Right," I said. The image of what had terrified me moments ago overtaken by a budding resentment.

"I’m sorry."

"It's fine, Riley. Really."

"It doesn't have to be," She whispered.

She was kind. I knew it then, and I know it now. But it was warm like a sauna I had been locked into. I wanted to scream. I wanted to ask how many days the living must endure the condolences for the dead? How long do I have to hear how hard I must have it and how bad other people feel for me? I wanted to look her square in the face and say: “When the does my face pull back the panhandle and stop collecting bullshit tips on how to move on?”

But I didn't. I put it on the shelf. It creaked in complaint, pushed to capacity by another bottled burden. It wouldn't buckle tonight. So, I said thank you.

"I wasn't trying to bring it up, Scott, I understand what you are going–"

"Woah," Amber said. "Check it out, guys."

I was so preoccupied, I hadn't noticed. We had made it to the lake.

Pikeral Pool was a sheer piece of glass in the weak moonlight. Undisturbed. Not even a skitter bug ran across its surface, and the wildlife seemed to be under the same obligation. No wind, caw, or howl pierced the stillness of the air or water. It was as if the lake was a crystal lid to a terrarium we had unknowingly been placed in.

"Damn. Shit's dope," Dean said through a skunk scented cloud of smoke.

"Told you, dude," Dylan whispered. "Camelot!"

I shot him a confused look. Tomas walked forward to the lake's edge. 

"Check it out."

It was a small memorial. A cylindrical cedar post, painted white, and adorned with fresh flowers, Pokémon drawings, and images of superheroes. At its base sat a little xylophone, tiny enough for a five-year-old to play. A memorial much like those you'd see on the side of the road for folks who lost their lives in car accidents. But the middle stood out. Enshrined around the mid-section of the post was a tattered cape, cloaking a gold plaque. I read it aloud.

"In loving memory of Isaac Clemmons. Whose hugs, kisses, and laughs saved our day, every day.  Our loss is Heaven's gain. Miss you, bud."

The words fell out of my mouth like stones. We sat in silence. No one moved. Afraid to disturb the tension as unbroken as the lake. With each passing second, the reality of our situation worsened. We all thought the same thing. Seven loser kids, ready to get trashed and literally dance atop a kid’s grave. Motivated by shit beer and second base. It made me sick.

Then, Dylan walked up to Isaac's memorial, knelt, and placed his hand on the top of the post.

"Dude, Furret is an awesome Pokémon. When I played, I thought Sandslash kicked ass— Sorry. I thought he rocked. I used him even though he sucked. And is that a Blue Beetle drawing? My man!”

We all just watched as Dylan carried on a conversation with no one. If it were anyone else, it would be a joke; a mockery. But not the way Dylan talked. You'd swear he was a divining rod who had contacted the spirit world with the way he spoke to the grave.

“You seemed like a great guy, Isaac. Just going by what your parents wrote," He held the corner of his cape between two fingers. “A real hero…”

He looked back at me for a moment. Though he said nothing, his eyes spoke volumes. Filled with the words I had rebuked over and over again. I gave him a nod that I hoped showed my appreciation. He returned it with a smile like always and turned back to the memorial.

"So, save our night. A lot of us could use a pick-me-up."

He stood up and placed his hand on the top of the post, like he was ruffling the kid's hair. It was honestly too much. But if you knew Dylan, you'd know he wasn't saying that to impress a girl or to get laid. The real deal.

"That was so sweet," Amber said, hands clasped at her chest. Maybe his chances weren't shot, after all.

"Yeah, bro. That was poetic as hell," Tomas said, helping Dean set up the keg.

It must have worked, too. The mood picked up. Tomas busted out a good speaker and started to play some acoustic country. Dean made sure everyone was tipsy. We all settled into various parts of the lake to have a good time. Amber and Dylan were deep in the pool, playing a flirtatious game of Marco Polo. Amber's giggles constantly exposed her position, but they didn't mind. Rick took photos of the moon, Dean and Tomas chucked a football back and forth, and Riley mingled all around the water's edge, dancing by herself.

And there I was, sitting by Isaac's memorial. I wasn’t sad or miserable for him. I related to him. A share unfairness felt across the barriers of death and life. I winced in pain. I had twisted the denim of my jeans into tight spirals in my fist, my knuckles had gone bleached white, and they had cut through the core of my palm.

How is it that the heart is one of the strongest muscles in the body, yet so feeble that when we lose those we love, it fails twice. The physical loss is their absence. The destruction of routine, of joy, of anger, and annoyance. A robbery of our lives by vandals we trusted. The days after are the worst. Those break you. They broke my father.

When my mom died, it was as if someone chucked a window through my glasshouse and there was no repairman in town. My only solace was that, each day that passed, I got to wander past the fractured pane with the hope that I'd eventually have some nostalgia to muse over it.

What a bitter fucking joke.

"My dad died when I was ten," Riley said, sitting down. Glazed in a light sheen of sweat from her dance, looking to Dylan and Amber in the middle of the lake. But not truly. She was elsewhere. Wrapped in the arms of a man who'd been dead for almost a decade. Even with dilated, stoned eyes, red-tinted from tears and drugs, she was quite beautiful.

"He was my whole world. Still is. He loved doing things with me. We'd cook, clean, stuff like that. It's so weird. I never thought I would miss doing chores."

I didn't want to face her. I felt like I was intruding on some pure moment. A crinkle of her nose, a stifled tear, the unblinking way in which she watched the water, all of it was hers. If I spoke, I would be acid curdling the cream.

"But he made it, like, silly. You know? He'd make a flashlight have a voice, add sound effects to things."

She put a finger up to her nose to mimic a mustache and deepened her voice: “‘This only works if you make the noise first. Boop!’”

She laughed. A deep croak, which seemed rude not to join. After a quiet time, I found myself talking.

"How did he die?"

"Just... did. In his sleep. Aneurysm."

"That's..."

"Yeah."

She made small swirls in the dirt with her thumb.

"I don't pity you, Scott. Even at ten, each shitty condolence was like a hand pushing down on me. They all tried to pull me out of the water, save me from drowning, but each attempt just sunk me deeper." She skipped a stone. It fell through the surface as though it were made of air, hardly a ripple.

“I ain't going to sit here and lie that you will feel better one day. I haven’t. Not totally, but there are ways to keep going."

She put a hand on mine. And before it could be something more, Dylan shouted over.

"Scottsman! Make a move or get in the water."

Our hands snapped away. A beet red flush overtook both of us.

"You are the worst," Amber said, splashing a torrent of water towards Dylan.

"You want to take turns dunking him?" Tomas said, suddenly at our side, removing his jacket and shirt.

"Nothing would make me happier," I said. Riley cracked her knuckles in agreement.

After about ten minutes of waterboarding Dylan, we were all deep in the lake. I never wanted to leave. The moment the water kissed my abdomen, a rich warmth spread through my bones. A cradle of nature. Each ripple of movement was a departed embrace. My lungs were clear. My nose, which usually sported a congested passage, was free and filled with the scent of fresh ozone of a coming rain, but the sky was clear and peppered with stars.

"That's the spirit, Scottie." Rick said, his demure disposition abandoned in favor of a glazed-out, back stroke that glided before me like a wayward duck. I was confused for a moment, but then I touched the upturn of my cheeks. I hadn't noticed. I had a smile on my face. Looking around, we all did. And how long had we been idle here? Hadn't we been playing Marco Polo? Now, we were each meandering in our own waters. Content with nothing but the light of the moon, the dead air, and the warm water to swaddle us.

Rick was the first to go.

No one saw it. It stood atop him, weightless, using him like Carion's boat down the River Styx. A frail figure with messy hair, sheen grey skin, and a coat of white fur draped around its shoulders and back. Its arms were thin, twig-like, falling down to sharp, straight claws. Its face had no mouth and two light beams of yellow instead of eyes.

It looked down at the Rick, fascinated and analytical. It turned its head and narrowed its beamless eyes. Rick didn't see it and didn't feel it. His eyes closed. Lost amidst the same bliss which had ensnared me. I felt feverish. A lost actor in a dream I was half in. I couldn't speak and didn't want to. So at peace, the sight before me wasn't horrifying, but rather too precious to disturb. Fear hadn't paralyzed me. Joy had.

"...hurt..." Its voice was the dry gasp I had heard before.

"W-what the–" Rick said, suddenly snapping away from his peace. His expression flipped like a coin, and it disgusted me to see it. He sneered his face into a tight curve. His mouth carved out a snar,l and he flailed, intent on striking the monster.

"Get the fuck off me, you absolute freak! I hate you. I hate everything you fucking are. You sad, pathetic, waste of a goddamn population point–"

The figure raised its arms, pointed its needle fingers towards Rick’s face, and did it with a slowness of someone half interested. Then, they shot forward, pierced Rick's eyes, and exited out his skull, killing the words in his mouth.

"...hurt..."

Then, Rick sank. The water swallowed him without effort, falling beneath the tension without acknowledgment. Just like the stone Riley had skipped before. The monster went with him, sinking as the captain aboard a capsized vessel. When all the strands on his head were beneath the glass pool, I wasn't able to break my gaze.

Looking around the lake, not a single one of them noticed. They were all preoccupied with their serenity. Riley swam in a small circle, Dylan and Amber were sucking on each other’s faces. Tomas and Dean tossed a football back and forth. Not a single concerned soul. And on the outside, I wasn’t either. My placid smile and dazed eyes were etched onto my face like I were stone. My heart rate must have been in the mid-60s. I even paddled a few lazy breast strokes in a small circle. On the inside, I screamed. A faint resistance. An echo of horror from the well of my mind. A trapped line of thought, half buried in a numb vessel. Each movement was an action coated in molasses. Both in control and not. I wanted to run. I wanted to stay.

Then, it emerged near Tomas and Dean, but it wasn't alone. Rick rose with it. His skin was opalescent, and his eyes the same feverish yellow, shining bright enough to leave small circles of illumination on Tomas's skin. He wore a smile woven not with maliciousness, but rich, full happiness.

"...hurt..." 

The figure crawled atop Dean's stocky shoulders like a spider. It pierced his eyes more slowly this time, moving its fingers around his sockets in a blending motion. After the fourth revolution of the needles blending his eyes, Dean's peace shattered. His hands snapped to his head, desperate to hold it together, and he bellowed the ugliest shriek I have ever heard.

"Stop! Please, God. Stop! I'll be good. I swear I'll—" It was all he could manage before he sank into the pool. Not even a gargle from the water which filled his open mouth. Just a soundless plunge before erasure.

Tomas blinked and was freed. "Holy shit!" Rick had already begun to crawl atop him, urging him deeper.

"It's okay, man. It's okay. You'll see. It’s all fine."  Rick said, pulling on his clothes, his face, and hair, each tug sinking them both lower and lower.

Tomas landed haymaker after haymaker on Rick's face, desperate to free himself. He had almost 40 pounds on the guy, but from my angle, it was like battling a statue. Red welts painted his knuckles, battered and bloodied, while Rick’s face remained clean and blissful. They went down like that. Just before the water swallowed him, he looked to me, and try to scream, but the hands of Dean and Rick found purchase on his jaw, silencing him and pulling him beneath the surface.

The hold over me was lighter now. Maybe the creature's bifurcated focus helped, or my internal resistance had pulled through. I wasn't sure. But the water had switched from cement to syrup, and I pulled on the fleeting thread of sanity I had to flail to Amber and Dylan. Even as the veins in my face strained against my skin, a pressure as intense as defying Jupiter's gravity, I was still so damn happy for them. I cried tears of joy as I paddled like a drunk dog across the lake, urging my throat to scream, but unable to overcome the foreign cooing of happiness that bubbled in my throat. With each stroke, the gulf seemed harder and harder to cross.

When I was halfway, Dean, Rick, and Tomas emerged, encircling the two love birds in locked hands. A ring of cultists to their love. The creature sprang from the water in a spiral tower of flesh. Its thin legs and torso coiled tightly, stretched till it dangled over Dylan and Amber like an angler fish lure. The gang pulled the two apart with conviction. Their focus was on Amber, not Dylan.

Dylan opened his eyes wide after being ripped from Amber's lips.

"Guys, what the hell?" He said.

He was confused at first. Then, he saw their eyes, and their smiles, and then the creature that swayed above him. He saw me, crazed, smiling. Panic finally showed on my face, breaking through the miasma of serenity, and he realized how dire the situation was. He didn't run. And he never was entranced. He saw the twisted display before him and swam to them without hesitation, spearing his way towards Amber.

As they lifted her to the creature above, he yanked, pried, and clawed at their hands. An act of frivolity that none of the participants seemed to notice. Certainly not Amber, hoisted atop all of them, backlit by the lagoon glow of the eyes beneath her, embraced the dangling horror with pure glee. She never broke free, never snapped. Not even when it caged her skull with its needle grip and methodically pierced it with each finger. The squelch of her brain being skewered queued their descent back into the lake.

"No!" Dylan screamed, crying, slamming his fists on Dean's back, whose headbeams were too enamored with Amber to mind the pitiful blows. Then all but the creature’s head was gone. It floated amidst its wisping strands of soaked hair and stared at Dylan in analysis. Then, the creature's mouthless visage opened on a jagged hinge. A thin line tore through its pallid flesh like an invisible knife. Its crooked lips turn upward, unveiling dozens of fangs.

"Saved."  It purred.

With a plunk of a mis-skipped stone, it descended.

"Scott, we should go." It was Riley. She was behind me. Hushed. She tugged on my hand beneath the water. The moment her fingers graced mine, my trance shattered. I blinked, then flailed. I searched around the lake, my head snapping around. Nothing but the sheen surface reflecting the dead sky and the glowering moon and Dylan. Who bobbed and floated in complete shock.

"Dylan!" I said, whispering as loudly as I could. I reached out to touch him. He floated back like a buoy, staring at where the Amber had been.

"Dylan, come on, man." I started to pull him. "We got to get the fuck out of the water."

"It's my fault," he said.

"What?"

"He... he said, 'saved'." Tears welled in his sockets. "He said, 'saved', Scott!"

Riley's hand tightened around mine. She was shaking. She was terrified. But I couldn't leave Dylan. I grabbed his shoulder with my free hand.

"Who gives a flying fuck what it said. We have to go."

"He's right, though. We are saved."

My heart sank. I tried to move my hand and met a crushing vice instead of a tender hold. Then, Riley's other hand groped my chest. Then, another grabbed my hip. Then, another on my thigh. Until I was swarmed with the spider snares of ten hands, yanking, clawing, and caressing me down. I craned my neck to look behind me. Riley floated rigid in the front of the pack. Two corridors of brimstone had swallowed her vision and beamed at me. It hurt to look at. She vibrated. Not with fear, but pure excitement.

"Scott, trust me. You will feel so much better." Her voice was hers, but coated in some saccharine sickness. “Just let go.”

“No… no…” I started. The rest of the group had moved in an instant, surrounding me in a circle of smiling, sunken heads, beaming with joy.

"Come on, man,” Tomas said. “Lighten up.”

The hands worked their way up to my face. They yanked, clawed, and pushed. With each attempt, the bliss that had swallowed me had been replaced with a violent rage deeper than I ever thought possible. A thread of electricity ran through each vein, burning my fingertips, gritting my teeth. I felt the violence of a thousand hatreds, bubbling up from me like I had been set to boil. I want all of them to die bloody deaths. I saw a fantasy of Riley with her dad once more just to watch him be stabbed to death like the bitch deserved. The image of Dylan battered and bloodied beneath me, holding a baseball bat, and me screaming how much he needed to leave me alone.

“Get off me, you pieces of shit. I’ll kill you. I’ll kill all of you. I will drown you till each fucking bubble leaves those pathetic lungs.” My eyes rolled around in scalding hot tears.

“Stop it. Stop it right now. Mom, please. Please help me. Dad? Mom? Anyone? Mom… Mommy!”

They forced my face up and instead of the serene sky which had bathed us before, I was faced with the grey-skinned monster, its slimy nose so close that it touched mine. And all that anger melted out of the ice and into watery despair. When my eyes fell beneath the water, as it poised its needles over my eyes, the image of the creature blurred. Its bloody grin watered down to a concerned smile. Its jaundice eyes were blue sapphires now riddled with tears. And the matted fur animal coat had been supplanted by a pristine, red cape.

“You’re hurting.” 

Before I could scream beneath the surface, the needles pierced my eyes, and black was all I saw. 

Then, after an eternity, white. Details filtered in bit by bit as my eyes adjusted. But they were closed? I was crying, rubbing my eyes with fists too small for my face. A small chirp of distant birds rippled into my eardrums, muffled as if underwater, but the wind that pulled on my shirt and shorts was crisp and clear.

“Mommy, I want my mommy,” I said in a voice that was not mine. Or at least, wasn't currently mine. It was rehearsed audio, played through me as if on a recording.

“I guess it is a good thing I am right here.”

I opened my eyes and there she was. Right there, beautiful, tall, safe, and warm. Clad in her favorite white dress with blue flowers. I snatched her leg without a moment’s notice, burying my face into her knees.

“I thought I’d lost you,” She cooed, brushing my hair. Her words were soft with a tinge of buried sadness trailing them. She must have been worried sick.

“I thought I had lost you!” I shouted into her dress. “I was… so… scared… and I-I-I…”

“Take a deep breath, bug.” My mom said, stroking my hair.

I did. And I felt so much better. 

“I thought you left me behind on purpose.”

“Why would I do that?”

“You might! You might wake up one day and realize you don’t want to be my mom anymore.”

“Oh, honey.” She pulled me into the tightest hug I had ever felt. The kind that holds your whole body together and stops you from turning into a puddle of tears.

“That would never happen. Can I let you in on a little secret?”

I nodded, rubbing my eyes. When I stopped, she was crouched down at my level. Her red air curled around her in the light breeze, and she smiled something deep and somber.

“Some days, Mommy wakes up sad. On those days, I don’t want to get up. I don’t want to be anyone or anything. And even on those days, the only thing I ever want to be is your Mama.”

She Eskimo kissed my nose and ruffled my hair. When she pulled away, our eyes locked on one another, and I was freed, in control of myself once more. I still was me. This version of me from when I was young, but acutely aware of where I was and what had happened.

“But it's not enough. You will wake up one day, and being my mom won’t be enough to make you stay.”

Her smile faded, and she stared off into the parking lot. The pavement withered into the white like a half-finished watercolor painting, and she and I were the only subjects amidst the frame.

“Well, maybe. But that isn’t because you made me go. It’s because I wasn’t strong enough to stay.”

“And that’s not fair!” I stomped my foot. “Why should I have to be alone? Why should Dad have to drink all day? Just because… because you were too much of a coward to—”

She pulled me in tighter.

“You are right. It’s not fair. I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve that, Scottie. You didn’t deserve to have a mom like me. You didn’t deserve to find me like that." She cried into my shoulder. "I’m just so sorry.”

In all the days since I had found my mom’s body, in all the condolences and heartfelt comments, through the tears and anger, her words here were the only time I had felt seen, touched. I sobbed into her chest for an eternity. The void of the water muffled my ears, reminding me where I was. I had been on an island of pain since that day. Now, I was wading through the surf to find land.

“This isn’t real. You aren’t real. I am just drowning, imaging this stupid fucking closure.”

She clamped my cheeks between her hands and kissed me on the forehead.

"It’s okay. It’s all okay.”

Over her shoulder, I saw him. A little boy, no older than five, with dusky blond hair, a red cap, who was shedding happy tears. Mom craned her neck to see him.

“Is it that time already?”

He nodded.

She turned back to me. “I have to go, sweetie. You have to go. But you need to know I am so proud of you. I was then, and I am now. I always am. Mommy made a mistake. One she regretted the moment she did it, but it was never your fault. No one’s but mine, you hear? I know that will not fix it; it won't undo anything. But you need to hear it. You need to hear it so you can stop drowning yourself and finally come up for air.”

I looked into her eyes. A million thoughts and aches came to mind. I want to show how much I loved her and hated her for what she did. It flooded in and through me. Each thought made me lighter, lifting me higher. She grinned as I ascended, holding my cheeks as my legs lifted towards the surface of the dream. I waded through each painful remembrance with the deliberation of years. The moments of suffering lapped upon me like tides of the surf, and pulled away just as quickly. Isaac clapped soundlessly as I underwent this process.

“I love you, Scottie.”

Then, all those thoughts, all those aches, all that anger, all that sadness, muddled into five little words.

“I love you too, Mom.”

“Scott!”

Dylan shouted into my face. Suddenly, I was on the lake’s edge, looking at my crying friend, and the sprinkling of stars overhead. I glanced about. It wasn't just me. We were all back on land. Bone dry. Eyes on the sky above. 

Riley started to sob; Dean looked out at the lake, bewildered, ruffling his short hair; Rick and Tomas looked at one another as if ascertaining whether they had dreamed this or not.

“What…” I groaned. My body ached with the exhaustion of a completed marathon. I wasn't sore, just... spent.

“Did you guys see that thing?” Dylan screamed. “It… it took you all. Beneath the water. And, you were so happy about it. 

You were down there for so long. Like, twenty minutes. You should all be dead."

Riley ignored Dylan and ran over to me, crashing at my side and squeezing my shoulders. 

“Did you see her, Scott? Did you?” Before I could answer, she hugged me.

“I talked to my Dad. We… we played Monopoly and talked. It was a Sunday, right before he died. He told me he saw how sad I had been and… Please tell me you saw your mom. Please tell me I am not fucking crazy.”

Dylan looked at me with abject horror on his face. I looked over to Tomas and Dean. The moment our eyes met, they looked away in seeming embarrassment. 

Eventually, they returned my gaze with a soft nod. I never found out totally what they saw, but they both stood a little straighter than when we entered the water; more resolute in themselves.

“I saw my Dad,” Rick said, hugging his knees by the water’s edge. “He was watching TV, like he was when I left. But I got to hear the things he wants to say, but is too proud to. I… I got to go home.” 

He peeled off the sand and bolted to his car.

Amber looked at Dylan, smiling ear to ear. “She’s okay, Dylan. My sister’s okay.”

She kissed him and wrapped her arms around his neck. The horror on Dylan’s face melted into confusion.  He had seen a monster killing our friends. He must have been so lost and afraid, never getting the relief we had. But Amber’s embrace had begun to push him past the first barrier of doubt. He patted her on the back, looked at me, waiting for my answer, as if permission to believe any of what had happened did.

“My mom told me she was sorry and that she loved me.”

A silence fell over us. A warm one. One of comfort that eased the hallucination into something more. Then, we all looked to the lake and Isaac’s grave. The wind picked up his cape, and we heard, in a clear, crystalline voice, of a little boy.

“Saved.”

There were so many more things we could have said. But much like how the water had held us in this strange warmth, the aftermath of our baptisms had a similar hold. We all but Dylan shared the same look at first. A deep confusion we exchanged for relief bit by bit. The need to wonder lessened. I don’t believe much in God, but if those who witnessed Jesus’s miracles are to be believed, then I understand them now. Some things are too beautiful to ask more information about. Sometimes, you have to let a miracle be a miracle.

The fears, the horror, the insecurity, had all been swallowed by the water. We were cleansed, but not completely. In a way, we were still damp, but on our way to being dry and no longer held beneath the water. And as we made our way back to our cars, we joked. Laughed. Talked about things like we hadn’t experienced anything crazy at the lake at all. In some way, the experience faded. We remember, I certainly still do, but not in the way you remember an event. More like how you see an era of your life. A collage of experiences you wandered through and internalized. It was this precious, glass-sealed gift we had been given. None of us had any interest in shattering that seal. 

But the gifts didn't stop at the lake. When I got home, ready to pick up my father off the floor, I found him upright on the couch instead, still draped in the blanket I had given him. The plate on the table before him was cleaned, and he had a *sober-ish* smile on his face as he stared at Mom’s photo. I took a seat next to him.

“I had this wonderful dream about her. It was so real.”

He turned to me, and I swore he saw the scab on my heart that started to form. He hugged me suddenly, but it wasn’t for my sake. He did it like someone lost adrift in a blizzard, desperate to find heat for survival. It was as if he could sense the dryness inching away at the damp, and pulled himself to leech a bit for himself. And I knew, then and there, that he deserved it too. I lost my mom. He lost that and more.

I don't know if what happened was real. Maybe we were crazy, or drunk, or lost. I know I didn't drink that night, but is it more plausible to believe I *couldn't* have than what I remember? My life hasn't been perfect since I went to Pikeral Park, but the pain I felt up to my plunge doesn't ache like it used to. The scar is still there, but it has healed. It's firm now. Strong. Faded to a benign mark. And, yes, I do muse some nostalgia over the broken windows in my glasshouse.

Whether or not it was real doesn't matter. Because my life turned around that night and the morning after. I don't know what compelled me to ask him, but I am glad I did.

“Dad?”

“Yeah, Scottie?” His breath smelled of whisky, but the word Scottie didn’t sting. I hadn't realized how much I had missed it.

“There’s this pool in Pikeral Park. Will you go with me?"
