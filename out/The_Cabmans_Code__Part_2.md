Cabman’s taxi was parked just a few feet away from me, but Zoey still had some ground to cover. She was crossing a hill, firing rounds from her tactical shotgun at the enemy team as she ran along the edge of a cliff. I tried my best to dodge attacks, but my vitality was fading quickly. Forcing my character to roll to the right side of the taxi, I jumped into the passenger seat.

I watched intently as the mob of players chasing me closed in on the vehicle. To my surprise, the moment they touched the taxi, their characters began to disintegrate. It was as if they were being torn apart pixel by pixel, each step closer causing them to dematerialize more until nothing remained of their former selves.

Zoey was almost out of ammo, but she forced her character into a ground slide to quickly make it down the hill. Cabman remained completely motionless, seemingly unfazed by the chaos unfolding around us. Zoey barreled toward the vehicle with one last opponent hot on her heels.

“Zoey, there’s still one guy on your back! Be careful!” I shouted into my headset.

“Yeah, you guys aren’t exactly helping either!” she shot back. 

“I don’t really know what’s going on, but I don’t have enough health left to help anyway,” I admitted shamefully. “I know… I kinda suck tonight.” 

Just then, Cabman appeared directly behind Zoey, standing strangely still in the middle of the battlefield, as if he had just teleported there without making a sound. I never saw him step out of the car, yet somehow, he was now positioned between Zoey and the rival player.

For a moment, it felt like time stood still. We anxiously watched as the player careened headlong toward Cabman. Just as the player came within a foot of him, Cabman’s body suddenly levitated a few inches off the ground, and a strange shockwave emitted from him. The wave cut through the air with an unearthly droning sound, slicing straight through the player. Within seconds, the character’s body began to evaporate into thin air, as if being erased from existence.

Now that the opposing team was no longer a threat and we had made it to the cab, I was finally able to collect my thoughts. The game seemed eerily quiet—no in-game music, no sound effects—but I could hear the sound of the whispering from before, now louder and more distinct. It was definitely coming from Cabman’s mic: a shrill, austere muttering that sounded like hundreds of voices chastising me.

“That was pretty wild,” Zoey said. “I thought for sure that was going to be game over, but that Cabman guy… he’s some kind of something...”

“What do you mean?” Tray chimed in; frustration evident in his voice. “What am I missing? This sucks that I can’t see anything!”

“It’s honestly kinda creepy,” I answered, my voice low and apprehensive. “He doesn’t seem like a real character in the game. I mean, I’ve never seen anything like that before… it’s like he’s just erasing players from the game. It’s freaking me out.”

“Guys, I’m missing all the weird stuff, so I’m gonna reboot my computer and see if that fixes my issue,” Tray groaned. “Hopefully, by the time I’m back online, your match will be over.”

“You better come back quick,” I shot back, “I’m gonna try to talk to this Cabman dude.”

“Wait, for real?” Tray exclaimed. “Alright, keep me posted… I’ll hurry! Honestly, it’s probably just some ten-year-old rich kid with an expensive skin.”

“How are you going to talk to him?” Zoey asked, you could hear the surprise in her voice. “I’m not sure that’s a good idea with how strange this whole thing has been.”

“I get that, but he did help us out of a pinch back there, and we’ll probably win this match because of him.” I responded, trying to sound apathetic. “He clearly has a microphone; it’s been active this whole time…”

“Yeah, but have you heard the weird crap coming out of that mic?” Zoey retorted, her tone sharpening. “It doesn’t sound like background noise… it’s like a woman screaming in the distance, but it’s faint, like she’s far away. It’s distorted too, almost like it’s staticky. It’s been giving me the creeps this whole time.”

Her words hung in the air for a moment, sending a chill down my spine. I tried to wrap my head around what she had just said.

“What!? Why are you just now bringing this up?” I cried, my voice intensifying with a mix of anger and disbelief.

“Why didn’t YOU bring it up!?” Zoey shot back, clearly irritated. “I was surprised you didn’t say something about it sooner.”

“I haven’t heard any women screaming,” I stuttered. My voice faltering, hesitating as I tried to get my sentence out. “It just sounds like…”

“Sounds like what?” Zoey pressed, her tone stirring with curiosity. “What did you hear!?”

“It sounds like… people,” I said slowly, not wanting to say more but knowing Zoey would press me further. “Like lots of people whispering angrily. They’re distant, but it’s awful. Their voices are cruel, like they’re scolding someone… or maybe me… I don’t know!”

Zoey was silent, I could tell she wasn’t sure what to say. “That’s… not what I heard at all,” she said faintly. “But now it feels even creepier.”

We sat in silence for a few moments, trying to process everything we had discussed. I hung my head, with my eyes fixed on the worn-out carpet underneath me. The faded colors and frayed edges couldn’t distract me from the chaos inhabiting my mind. Nothing that was happening made sense… none of it.

The silence was broken by the hateful whispers bleeding through Cabman’s mic. The longer I sat there the louder they became, making it hard to think clearly. I took a deep breath and lifted my head to check my computer screen, I was surprised to see it flickering erratically again. The taxi had also started moving across the map. Not driving though, sort of phasing between different locations in a matter of seconds. With each flicker of the screen, its headlights would cast long, cascading shadows across the battlefield.

“Not to change the subject,” I said, trying to steady my voice, “but something weird is happening in the game right now.”

“What do you mean?” Zoey asked concerned.

“The taxi,” I said, watching the screen in utter confusion. “I mean… we’re moving, but not normally. The screen keeps flickering, and we’re kinda just teleporting to random locations on the map. Like… we’re glitching or something...”

Zoey stayed silent, and I could hear her control stick turning slightly as if she were adjusting her view. “Yeah, I see it now too,” she said quietly. “It’s like the whole game is breaking down.”

The flickering became more extreme as the taxi continued its course, all at once coming to a halt in the middle of the Convergence Circle. We had made it to the final destination, but I’d never seen it look like this before.

The circle wasn’t filled with other players; in fact, it was nothing like I was used to. The ground was littered with what looked like decaying bodies, their character models grotesquely melted and glitched. They flickered, fading in and out, as the rest of the world seemed to deteriorate and grow darker. The sound of wailing and screams could be heard growing louder as the cab came to a halt squarely in the middle of it all. The disfigured bodies clawed and scratched at the sides of Cabman’s taxi, their movements jerky and unnatural, as if they were trying to break inside.

“Do you see this?” I yelled, the words hanging on my lips.

“See it?” Zoey shot back, her voice trembling. “I can’t even describe it. What the heck is this? Something is seriously wrong with this game!”

Zoey tried to exit the taxi, but her character wouldn’t move. I tried to do the same, but no matter how many times I pressed the button, my character wouldn’t leave the taxi.

“So… I’m stuck,” I said, with apprehension in my tone. “I can’t get out of the car!”

“Same!” Zoey replied, her voice was confused and agitated. “What is this? Are we glitched?”

Suddenly, Tray’s voice cut through the chaos. “Guys, I don’t want to downplay this moment you’re having, but… something’s happening on my end,” he said, his voice sounded concerned. “When I rebooted my computer and logged back into Discord, I noticed I had a new friend request.”

“What? I mean, I guess it’s strange that anyone besides us would want to be friends with you, but that’s not nearly the weirdest thing that’s happened today,” I quipped, staring nervously at the flickering screen. The whispers around Cabman’s taxi grew louder, almost drowning Tray out.

“Ignore the unwarranted sarcasm, Tray! Who’s it from?” Zoey said, half laughing but also interested in what had Tray worked up.

“I don’t know,” Tray replied, his voice shaking slightly. “There was no name. It’s just… blank, but their avatar is a picture of a taxicab. But that’s not even the creepy part? They sent me a private message too, and when I tried to open it, this pop-up window came up. It said, ‘Cabman’s Taxi Service: The ride that takes you where you need to go.’”

Zoey let out a nervous laugh. “You’re joking, right? This sounds too ridiculous to be real… Please tell me you’re kidding.”

“I wish I was,” Tray shot back. “The pop-up wouldn’t go away at first. I had to click it three or four times, and the window kept acting glitchy, randomly displaying lines of code. When I finally got it closed, I could see the message from the unknown person.”

“What did it say?” I asked, though I didn’t know if I wanted the answer.

Tray paused, then said, “‘Your driver is here.’”

We all fell silent; the only sound that could be heard was the static and muffled cries in our headsets. My heart sank as I began to wonder if this was more than just a glitch in our game.

"You guys still there?" Tray continued, his voice straining. "I haven’t even gotten to the worst part yet..."
