Another  police car whooshed past my house for the forth time. I could hear  distant screaming and gunshots, but I reckon that as another shooting.  No big deal, it was something fairly common in the neighborhood.

Just  as I was about to curse at the monitor for the eight death streak in  Call of Duty, my phone on the desk buzzed, followed by an unfamiliar  ringtone which I immediately recognized as an amber alert. A  notification popped up on my phone as soon as I turned it on.

&#x200B;

>*“AMBER  ALERT: This is not a drill. All local residents of XXX town are  instructed to stay indoors immediately. Remain calm and shut all doors  and windows, and do not let anybody in. Your area is under attack by  unidentified threat. The military is expected to arrive shortly and will  neutralize anybody in sight. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EXIT. It is recommended  to stay indoors until further instructions are given by the  authorities.”*

A  shock-wave of dread hit me. Initially, I had no idea what to do, but as  soon as I regained sanity, I rushed to the living room to shut the big  door and windows as instructed. I pulled out my phone and dialed my  husband who was at work, only to enter voicemail. Soon, I dialed my  parents’ number who lived far away from where I was, but the signal was  immediately cut off.

From my  peripheral sight I noticed something odd from outside the window.  Instead of fences and beautiful neighborhood houses like one would  expect, they were shaded with layers of thick fog. In fact, it was so  thick I could only see as far as twenty meters ahead. The only things  visible were car headlights and the illuminated windows from houses  across.

Due to the thick fog  shading the entire neighborhood from the sun, my house got dark fast. I  hesitantly went to turn on the light switch when the ground below  unexpectedly shook. It became louder, followed by rumbling noises from  the distance. My heart was pounding harder as I took small steps towards  the other window to have a look.

From  the window I noticed several pairs of fog lights illuminating the  streets. As they got closer, I made out the green camouflage of those  heavy looking vehicles. A few heavily armed men were marching along and  aiming their rifles at various houses.

*“What the hell was going on? Why would there be soldiers?”* I  asked myself. My urge to open the window and ask one of the men was  growing impatiently. However as soon as I touched the window handle, a  series of deafening gunshots roared in a sudden, followed by muffled but  blood-curdling screams from one of the houses.

Primal  instinct kicked in and I instantly ducked for cover. I crawled under  the coffee table and hid in a fetal position. Several heavy gunshots and  explosions reverberated my home, and soon after an announcement came  from outside. It was the military’s loudspeaker. A rough voice, in a  slight panicked state yelled out the following.

&#x200B;

>*“All  residents, I am speaking on behalf of the military. This is a  compulsory order. Do not panic and find the safest spot to hide  immediately. Do not let anything enter your house no matter how  convincing, as they may endanger you and your family. Stay hidden and do  not show yourself. Do so until further instruct-”*

&#x200B;

The  announcement was interrupted with blood gurgling screams from the  announcer. I instantly stood up, nearly knocking my head against the  table. What I did was that I dashed into my bedroom and lock everything  up as fast as I could, tears filling my eyes as I did so.

It  was then that I realized my body was shaking from panicking. I sat on  my bed and dialed my husband again, only to realize the signal was still  down. To calm myself down, I hid under the blankets. Nevertheless, I  still couldn’t cool down so I peeked through the curtain of my bedroom  window.

An appearance standing  right on the lawn of my house nearly made me jump. The moment my eyes  try to identify that unknown object, it dashed towards the front door.

“BANG”  a loud crash could be heard from the living room. The impact was so  strong that my bone felt shock-wave from that crash. I yelped. Not long  after the breach, I was nearly paralyzed by a series of low frequency  growls. The unknown trespasser’s footstep sounded more apparent as time  went by. I regained momentum and stealthily crawled towards the closet  beside my bed to avoid being heard.

As  soon as the closet was in proximity, I stood up, opened the closet  door, pushed the clothes aside and took a step into the abysmal wooden  bunker. I closed the door and there was absolute darkness around me,  albeit the sunlight from the closet hole being the only source of  illumination.

There was dead  silence. So silent I could feel my heartbeat within my ribs. It was  incredibly fast and desperate. But it was soon cut off by the sound of  my bedroom door knob clicking, followed by the creaking sound that I was  familiar for five years. Peeking from the closet hole I could barely  see the door opposite of me, but one thing for sure is that I could see  four long red sticks grappling the knob.

It  felt like an eternity for the “Object” to enter the room. During the  entire process of its appearance reveal I prayed even more that this was  just a bad dream. However reality was reality and I couldn’t escape  from it.

Its appearance was  unearthly. It was humanoid, stood up to eight feet tall, and had  unbelievably lengthy limbs. The five pairs of fingers were razor sharp  long. Its skin was fleshy red and the face… oh god. The bulging eyes,  uncanny smile, I nearly passed out.

That  entity took several steps and scanned my room, like an apex predator  searching for its prey. Every footstep, every growl, I backed an inch,  hoping it wouldn’t notice me. When the abominated entity approached  closer, still unaware of my presence, the window shattered into millions  of pieces with bullets riddling through and hitting the creature.  Before I could process anything, four military men jumped into my room  and opened fire at the demonic creature.

The  scene was deafening. I was only a few feet away from the firefight and  the only barrier between me and them was a one-inch thick wood. I fell  among the clothes from shock and couldn’t stand, but that saved my life  as bullets whizzed into the closet, barely missing me.

Too  unfortunate for me though, as the military men were no match for the  supernatural entity due to the fact that it survived every shot. No  bullets stopped it from advancing towards one of the men. One swoop into  his neck and the soldier was instantly decapitated. It devoured the  man’s head with its monstrous jaw. The fate of the three remaining  military men were also pretty much sealed, and I was left hopeless.

It’ll  probably take some time for reinforcements, but that given time was  enough for the entity to regain stamina. I cried, I couldn’t do  anything. I could only pray that it ignores the closet but the last of  all hopes shattered when its head turned and our eyes locked onto each  other.
