Hi I’m Morton. I live on an old farm in the upper Midwest. My family has owed it since the 30’s, back then it was small, just a two story house a small pond and a tree line boarding the edge of the field. It was a struggle in the beginning but as time went on we bought up more farms around us. Nowadays it was a vast expanse of nothing but wheat, stretching as far as the eye could see, without a single speck on the horizon. It was peaceful existence, at least that’s what I thought until the farm was mine.

Well it’s funny how the older you get how your precipitation of the past changes. When I was a young it was a place of adventure and mystery. I would run through the golden string like stalks of wheat, or swing in the pond on a rope that seemed like it had always been there. But as I got to be a teenager I viewed this place as a prison, some where to break out of, try and get far away. Like many others I left. But as I got older the memories of the farm was warm happy ones, where a child like wonder and a slower time called to me. So I conceded. 	

For awhile the farm had lived up to the fantasies in my head. The only complaint was the awful smell at night, but this was to be expected there was a pig farm a little ways down the road. It was ran by an old man who didn’t come out much. Many would describe him as eccentric, others would just say he was caught up in the past. Whatever that’s worth I never met him, so I hadn’t made my opinion yet. 

I remember the first time, went to go drink my coffee on the porch as usual before starting my chores. There in front of my door was an old burlap sack and it seemed to have a note pinned to it say  “you take , you leave”. Looking inside it I saw what was meat wrapped in brown butcher paper. It was still cold so I took it in put it away, grabbed some grain from the bin and set it on the porch. Now to some of y’all this might seemed odd, but where I come from trading between farmers was common practice. After leaving the sack I went to work when I stopped for lunch I noticed the sack was gone. I figured my neighbor had grabbed it. 

That night I decided I would have some of the pork he had given me. It was a beautiful dance of tenderness and savory delights that before I knew it I had eaten everything I cooked. “Must have been the freshness” I thought out loud. It had been awhile since I had  fresh meat like that. Come to think of it I was young, my father used to have it every Thursday. That was before he ran off. I was probably 15 back then. no one told me what was going on, but as I got older I could put the pieces together. 

I kept trading with joe, I came to find out his name from an old address book my dad had left. I found myself looking forward every week to his drop offs. Till one week I was so busy I forgot to bring the bag and fill it with grain, after that the sack stop coming. I noticed that night the smell had gotten stronger like it was closer than before, it kept me up at night. Soon after I would hear the occasional long high screech of the deck and a faint tapping sound on the door. But every time I would try to focus, it seemed like it got even softer, making me question whether or not I was hearing it or if my brain was just trying to fill the gaps. It was driving me up a wall. 

Then one night I was woke straight out of my sleep my heart was racing, and that smell was even worse I could barely catch my breath. Then I heard what had woke me up “tap, tap, tap” against the window. I jerked my head to the window beside my bed and in the moon light all I could see was a long bony finger with a long curved finger nail on it. A chill rain down my spine, not because of the finger but as I panned up I caught just its bloodshot eyes peering at me on the top of the window. Fear over took me and I shut my eyes. But as soon as I open them it was gone. There was no way I was going to sleep that night so I sat up just try to tell myself it was my tired mind. 

I just got straight to work that morning, I didn’t even make coffee. The whole day just trying to shake that feeling last night. I could see him clear as day every time I closed my eyes. That look he gave me it was like he had that gleeful hungry look you give when you are looking through the glass at a butcher shop. That evening I called it quits early and went down to the old watering hole, I needed a good smoke and drink. 

Figured it would help, but while I was down there I ran into an old friend Pete. We hadn’t talked in years, he sat down and we talked, drank, and had a good time. I don’t know why but joe had came to my mind I hadn’t gotten a sack from him in a month or so. So I asked Pete “hey do you know old Joe he lives down by me”. “Yea It’s sad what happened to him” said Pete, “what happened” I asked “about 2 or so years ago he went missing, we thought he had ran off like the all the others but about three months later we had found his body” Pete answered. I looked at him weird, Pete took a shot staring off like he was trying to collect himself for the next sentence. He continued “there was limbs and pieces missing off him like someone had carved him up”, “who has the farm now” I nervously asked. “Nobody, they had trouble selling the place after he had passed” Pet said after taking a shot. 

I went home that night feeling even worse then I had when I went in. That night I stayed up watching the tv. Sometime in the night I was woke again by the awful smells filling my lungs. Then loudly “knock, knock, knock” I got straight out of my chair it was coming from my front door. Slowly trying not trying to make a sound I tiptoed to the window trying to get a view of my front door. When I looked I was frozen in shock. Standing in front of my door was this humanoid creature. The skin was brown and it was like it had wrinkles every where that had been pulled tight, as if it body was pulling it in. The body itself was tall with long limbs that looked as if someone had hung skin on bones. And as look up. Its head was shaped like an oval with two wide open blood shot eyes. Then sharply it looked at me and I could see it had a smile that stretched all the way across its face bearing its teeth, that where oddly white, even though the rest of him looked as if he had cleaned himself in years.

I blacked out my body couldn’t had the terror. The next day I woke up and I had a dull stinging pain in my hand. I looked down and my hand was missing nothing but a bloody stump. I freaked out ran to the kitchen to grab a towel so I could go to the hospital. I told them i had lost it in a farming accident, so they got me fixed up and sent me on my way. When I got home I noticed there was something on the counter when I got closer it was another package wrapped in butcher paper with a note beside it that read “you take, You leave”.
