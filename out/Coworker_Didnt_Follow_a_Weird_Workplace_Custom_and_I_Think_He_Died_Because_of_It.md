I work in maintenance at a museum in the Midwest (not giving the city because it’d be so easy to find lol). We mainly focus on local/regional history, but we also host many events in the city. Most of these events run late, and I'll be clocking out around 12:00 AM - 1:00 AM. I'm really only working here to save up for an eventual move to Chicago next Summer. Because of that, I haven't really made too many friends, and, to be honest, I don't even have my boss's name saved in my contacts.

But I got trained by a guy named Justin. He was super cool. We would work events, and he would show me the ropes around the building. Literally everything about the guy is and was normal. We would work late, listen to music, and laugh at brain rot. He'd worked there for years, and he knew more about this building than anyone on the maintenance team. Just a cool guy, and a good person to know if you work there. But one thing that always weirded me out was that he would make us say goodbye to Tucker every time we left for the night. Tucker is a taxidermied bison that sits right in the middle of our permanent exhibit. Tucker is extremely lifelike (kudos to the taxidermist). But his plaquard always gives me the creeps. It has so much detail about how he was killed and who killed him; it feels more like a trophy case than anything.

Justin would say, "Be sure to say bye to Tucker”. Most of the time, it was funny, but on certain nights it felt very eerie, almost ritualistic. I am easily scared when it gets too late, so I just chalked it up to that. But one night, when I was feeling this way, we were locking up this glass door right in front of Tucker and I turned to Justin and said something like, "Imagine if I decided not to say goodbye to Tucker and something bad happened." While locking the door, without turning around, Justin said, "Let's not talk like that”. It felt very casual, but that response just felt heavier than it should have.

Well, Justin quit about a month ago, and I've been training his replacement, Aiden. We were working an event together, and while I had nothing against him, Aiden and I did not click as Justin and I did. At the end of the night, it was around 11:45 PM. Aiden and I were on our way out. We'd turned off the lights, and I turned to him and said, "Now we gotta say bye to Tucker”. Aiden immediately laughed it off, told me it was dumb, and said he wasn't gonna say goodnight to the bison. Even though he didn't, I still did.

I had the weekend off, but got back to work on Monday, and my coworker told me that on the way home from our shift on Friday, Aiden got in a car accident and died.  I've texted and called Justin about it, but he hasn't responded. I’m working events alone now, and walking by Tucker in that dark exhibit alone, saying “bye” to him by myself feels very, very different.
