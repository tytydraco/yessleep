 I had an encounter I can’t shake, so now I’m starting a post about it to get other redditors' thoughts. A couple days ago I woke up one night around 12-1 AM , my tv was off which was unusual (I never went to sleep with my tv off which is probably what woke me up) so I went out to the kitchen to get a drink. When I went to turn on the kitchen light it didn’t turn on, in fact nothing would turn on. I also noticed the light on the freezer was off. I realized the breaker had probably flipped a switch and turned off the power. This wasn’t unusual as the house was pretty old. I live in a family of four but they were on vacation and I had to stay behind to watch the dogs so I had to go turn it on myself. Now you might have guessed the breaker was outside so I had to flip the switch to power the breaker on manually but not wanting to go back to sleep without the tv or the fan I put on my shoes and headed outside. 

I have a gate at my front door so I opened it quietly and headed around to the side of my house near the backyard. Stumbling around in the darkness and crunching the dirt I found the breaker on the side of the wall but I noticed something the lock on the breaker wasn’t there, I didn’t think to much about this though as I’ve stated the power switch flipped a lot because the house was old so I could have easily forgotten to put the lock back on one day but in the middle of the night this freaked me out a little bit.

As I opened the door and looked for the correct switch to flip, there’s like ten of them. I noticed a man on the other side of the street sitting on a bench smoking a cigarette looking directly at me. There was nobody else outside besides the two of us and the occasional car passing down the street but I tried not to look at him. I noticed he was in dark clothes and he was sitting with one leg crossed over the other and his eyes were completely fixated on me. I mean I never left his gaze. I thought maybe he was just surprised to see some else out this late at night but that thought quickly faded in my mind. I finally found the correct switch and flipped the power back on. I looked over at the man for just a quick glance and noticed he was still watching me and very obviously to say I hurried back into my house and locked the doors. 

When I got back into bed after a few minutes I heard a knock at the door, “hello.” It was in a very calm voice as if they had known what was on the other side of this door all their life but hearing a knock this late at night definitely made me freak so I walked quietly down the hall to the kitchen window and peered out the curtains to see who it was. When I opened them I noticed it was the man from across the street needless to say this made me almost jump across my walls like a cartoon so not wanting him to see me I ducked under the kitchen window but when I did I knocked a spoon off the counter. Then he said, "I just heard you.” This time with a bit more anger rising in his voice, “I know you’re in there. I saw you from across the street walk in here.” I said nothing. He continued back in a calm demeanor, “well I just saw you from across the street and II…I just thought you were very pretty I thought maybe I could get your number.” After about a minute of silence the last thing he said was, “well I’m sorry honey maybe you’re asleep so I guess I’ll come back some other time.” 

I finally heard his shoes hit the concrete and the sound of my gate close after what felt like a lifetime, I slowly got up from the tile floor of the kitchen and walked back down the hall back to bed I immediately texted my family what happened though I got no response as it was around 2:00 AM at this point but I reluctantly fell asleep. It's been a few days now and that sick bastard hasn’t shown up again, I keep thinking about what he said about coming back so I have my friend Riley coming over to my house on Friday to feel safe, I told him about what happened so he said he’d try to come over earlier if he can (he has school) but I’m posting this story in case anything weird happens in that time what should I do? I’ll keep you guys updated.
