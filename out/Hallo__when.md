Bill left the den air conditioner on again. I'm sure I will never understand why that man insists it be as cold as an icebox on the North Pole every blessed moment in this house. And my lord is it noisy. The quiet night air is just fine without it this time of year, so off it goes. Well. He will just have to settle with being a tad "stuffy," as I seem to recall him putting himself. Better stuffy than catching your death, I say.

It's just as well, with him busying himself with lord-knows-what in the cellar again while I'm left to my lonesome upstairs alone.

Lonesome. I can't say why, but I feel as though I should be saddened by the thought. I love Bill dearly and all, but the man can be quite nonsensical at times. Most times, that I can recall, I say. An enigma, he is. Never can understand him.

There is what sounds to be a light knock on the porch door. At first I think the sound to be Bill again, messing with his doo-dads and what-nots in that hellish place down below. But sure as snowflakes, there it is again. A light tap-tapping sound, just outside.

I think to myself, "what an odd hour for a visitor." Here, at the end of this farm road that's sure to be a clear half-mile long. A neighbor, perhaps? I hope they're alright. It is quite late.

Bill usually likes to answer to visitors these days, so I wait for him to head on up. But again the knocking, and I'd say with a fair level of some insistence for an answer now.

Oh, to Hell with Bill.

I call out, "Coming!" As the the last knock falls.

Though the porch light is on, its door is without windows, so I cannot see who might be outside. I think to open it before my wits overcome me.

"Who is it?" I ask.

It seems a dog's age before there's a reply.

"T- Trick. Or. T- Treat."

I cover my mouth to stifle a laugh, and I shake my head in sheer disappointment in myself for having not known what day it was. Of all the blessed days of the year, how could I have forgotten that today was Halloween? I've had no time for decorations! No candy! Why, no costume of my own! How could Bill have not reminded me? That scoundrel of a man.

Without further hesitation, I pull the door open to its widest. There on the front porch is a solitary figure: a child, who couldn't be but ten. A little girl, or so I believe, as her costume is by far and wide one to behold.

"T- Trick-"

"Oh, would you look at you!" I exclaim. "That is a scary costume you have there. So ... gruesome!"

And indeed it is gruesome. Delightfully so. While she wears an adorable blue fairytale-like dress with a white smock, it is near-fully soiled by soot and costume blood. The mask she wears is indeed a terrifying sight, the appearance of what was once a beautiful girl, now a ruin of flesh and bone so much as to be unrecognizable. There is only but one eye I can see, precariously dangling from what appears to be fine thread. Only half of what would be gorgeous locks of golden hair cover her head, the rest a mass of reddened scalp beneath exposed skull. An elaborate piece that, I must say, I do admire.

"Tr-"

Her speech is but a gurgle, what with all the flesh parts of her mask covering her mouth.

"It's a wonder you can speak! Tell me, did your folks help you put that together? Your mum?"

At this she falls silent. Her breath ragged. Only her empty bag hangs open before her. It, too, as soiled as her garb.

"OhMyGoodness. I'm so embarrassed. Sorry, my ... mind is not so sharp these days. I don't have any-"

But I do. I do, and I may just about jump for joy if I could at the recollection. I hold out a finger of wait to the girl and rush back inside.

Bill has forever had a sweet tooth. I and his dentures could not forget this unfortunate fact. Reaching the kitchen, I open his cabinet nearly clear off its hinges and reach inside. A Hershey's chocolate bar. It's the only one left, with two squares already taken. I suppose I will just fault Bill for not thinking so clearly himself, in that it is he who'd kept his own stock so light and will now have to go without.

I arrive back to the porch. The girl remains, seemingly swaying to an unsung song, patiently awaiting her bounty. Her costume, it appears, has gotten the best of the remains of her dress, it now more red than not.

"Here we are. I'm so sorry, it's ... opened. My husband has a way with candy, I guess you could say. Hope you don't mind."

I place Bill's last bit of indulgence into the girl's bag, careful as I can not to have it covered in the mess that continues to issue from her mask.

"M...M..."

She speaks, but for the life of me I can't make sense of what she is trying to say. But there ... is something ...

"Where did you come from, dear? Where are your folks?"

"M...M..."

Again, there is ... something. My mind. God damn, my mind.

"Have I ... seen you around before, sweetie?"

I'm not sure what I've done to cause it, but she turns and walks away. Down the porch steps. Down the pebbled driveway. Out into the night; a night cold enough to bring my own breath to a fog before me. Much too cold for air conditioning, and far too dark for a little girl to rightfully be traveling in alone.

I motion to call out. I stop something that compels me to run off after her. If there is nothing else I know, it is that my frail, God-forsaken legs would not carry me far, least of all down the stairs.

Just as I close the door, Bill is in the kitchen. He'd come up and I hadn't noticed.

"Irene?!"

At first I don't answer. There is something within me that has something to say yet ... it just will not come. Something.

"Irene. Did you eat my Hershey's?"

"No, Bill. I ... Bill, why didn't you tell me it was Halloween?"

"What?"

"Halloween! Halloween! You didn't ... you didn't think to remind me it was Halloween!"

"Halloween? Well what gave you that idea?"

"There was ..."

Bill's concerned. He has that face again. He doesn't care about the chocolate anymore and comes into the living room, pulls me into his big arms. He smells like the old boxes of things we store our photographs and memories in. Sometimes the entire house smells like him. Sometimes --- like now --- I think I like it.

"Honey. Honey. Halloween. I know. Your favorite ... holiday, you used to call it. Used to wonder why the station didn't give me the day off."

"It ... was my favorite day, wasn't it?" I say. And then I remember. "It is my favorite day."

He laughs a little, like he's remembering something too.

"You could say that, yep. Used to have this whole place decked out in spiderwebs. Had me play scary music from the stereo. Lord knows nobody came up to this neck of the woods for candy, but that didn't stop you."

He laughs again, but it seems different now.

"You used to dress up to scare the Devil himself, I swear. Last time ... Lord, it was so long ago. I think I recall you and Bonnie dressed up as fairytale characters. You were ... Oh! You were The Mad Hatter, only with his head cut off. You held a bloody melon with a hat in your hands! You were mad, alright! But not Bonnie, she-"

"Bonnie?"

His hug gets tight. It feels good, but I know there's something not quite right.

"Yeah," he says, and swallows hard in my ear. "She ... she just wanted to be Alice in Wonderland. Nothing scary. Just ... so pretty."

"Who's Bonnie?"

Bill pulls away and hides his face from me, wiping cellar grime from his face and eyes.

"Our girl, Irene. Our Bonnie. After all these years, I still miss her. It's why I'm downstairs all the time. Looking at the old pictures we have of her. And today ... today, of course ..."

"Halloween?"

He laughs, sounding a bit more like himself.

"Today she would have been forty years old. Her birthday. Forty, can you believe that? Christ, are we old."

He holds me again.

"Twenty-nine years. I thought I'd lost you both."

He lets me go and starts into the den. I still can make no sense on what he's going on about.

"Y'Know, there aren't a whole lotta blessings I can come up with these days, but there are three in particular that help me sleep at night."

"What's that?" I ask.

"Well. One --- and sorry to have to admit this --- that the accident made you unable to ever drive again. And two, that ... horrible thing you went through the last time you drove ... with Bonnie ... it did something to your mind where you can't remember what happened to our little girl. Sometimes I envy you of that. And I thank God you're mostly okay."

Little girl. Bonnie. I feel at any moment my Bill is going to hop right into the Halloween spirit unlike he'd ever done and tell me this is all some scary story --- some awful, awful nightmare of a story --- and that Halloween is as special of a time to him as it's ever been to me.

"And the third?" I ask. "What's that?"

He presses the button on the air conditioner, and the silence of the night is as gone as my recollection of why we are having such an odd conversation in the first place.

"Air conditioning. Sweet, sweet AC. My god, is it stuffy. It's the middle of July, Irene."
