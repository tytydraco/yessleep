I never went home for my dad’s funeral. I told myself it was because I was busy, but really, I was afraid.
We had not spoken in years. When my mom called, her crying was a high, thin sound. I did not ask for details. I did not fly home. The only thing I sent was the silence of my own guilt.

He had been sick for a while. Not a cancer you can fight, but something wrong in the head that ate away at the edges of who he was. My mom mentioned he started going to meetings, but when I asked what kind, her voice went flat.

The obituary said heart failure. Closed casket.
I buried my own regret under work and told myself it was better that way.

A year later, my mom called out of nowhere and asked if I was still coming home for Christmas.
I had not planned to, but the sheer, unfamiliar joy in her voice startled me into saying yes.

When I pulled up, it was already dark. The new house was enormous, bigger than they could ever afford, with a fresh, empty driveway and a porch light so bright it felt less like a welcome and more like a spotlight on a stage.

Mom opened the door before I could knock. She looked aggressively young. Her hair was a uniform, glossy black, and her skin was smooth, almost buffed. She hugged me like she was checking a box.

Then I saw him.

My dad.

I swear to God I almost dropped my bags.

He was sitting in his old recliner, watching a screen that displayed only a calm blue pattern. He looked up, smiled that wide, slow smile, and said, “Hey kiddo. Missed you.”

I froze in the doorway. The scent of the house, a strange sharp smell like metal and ozone, filled my lungs.

For a second I thought the guilt had finally broken my mind. But Mom just said dinner was almost ready and walked into the kitchen.

Dad stood, stretched, and clapped me on the shoulder. His hand was cold, but the texture was too smooth, like wax that had been handled.

“Glad you made it,” he said. “You look tired. Still dragging around all that old pain?”

I just stared at him. His eyes were the worst part. They were too still, too bright, reflecting the light in a way that showed no depth.

“Dad,” I whispered, “you died.”

He laughed, a sound that was a little too loud. “Heart attack scare. Your mom always overreacts. I started that new Therapy she mentioned.”

She had never mentioned it.

Dinner was alienating. The food was bland and had no aroma. They did not talk about memories, only about local news and neighbors, their conversation sounding like a pre-recorded loop. Every sentence felt correct, but entirely hollow.

When I went to bed that night, I heard them talking downstairs. Their voices were calm and even until my dad’s voice, now a fraction lower and heavier, cut through the quiet.

“He’s next. The pain is the key.”

The next morning Mom told me she had already booked me a session with Dad’s therapist.

“It’s not regular therapy,” she said, pouring black, unscented coffee. “It’s more of a system reset. Everyone around here is doing it.”

I said no. She just smiled, that same bright fixed smile, and acted like I had not spoken.

Dad drove me there anyway. The building was a small, modernist clinic surrounded by empty fields. The sign out front said:
THE WELLS INSTITUTE – RESTORE YOURSELF.

Inside, everything was white. Not clean hospital white, but a thick, matte, polished bone white. A woman at the desk greeted me by name, her gaze never leaving my face.

Dad patted my back. “Told you they’d take care of the mess you’ve been carrying.”

The therapist, Dr. Wells, was as unnervingly placid as Mom. She asked about my biggest burdens, my pain, my regrets, what I wanted to forget about my life and my father. My guilt felt like a physical weight in the sterile room.

She leaned in, eyes unblinking, and said, “He loves you. He brought you back so you could shed that burden and finally join him in his peace.”

I pretended to agree, nodding vaguely, and left the Institute with a racing heart.

That night I heard a wet, dragging sound outside my window. When I looked, my dad was standing alone in the backyard under the blinding porch light. He was whispering into the empty air.

Then I saw it. A tall, impossibly thin shadow, bent toward him like a black wire. Its head was high enough to graze the roofline.

When it turned toward the window, I did not see features, only a dense, absorbing blackness. I ran upstairs.

Mom was standing in the hall. She said, “He just wants to help you eliminate the noise.”

I locked my door and stayed awake, my phone clutched in my hand.

I should have left, but the wrongness of it all kept me rooted. I needed to know what had taken them.

So I went back to the clinic.

They put me in a white room with a simple chair and a full-length mirror. Dr. Wells told me to breathe and let go of the unnecessary emotional data.

The lights dimmed. The mirror rippled as if the glass was a sheet of black water.

Behind it, something moved.

It looked like smoke under pressure with a faint outline of a face. It pushed against the glass like it wanted out.

Dr. Wells whispered, “He gave you his body so the rest of you, the data, the consciousness, could live. It is your turn to give yours.”

The mirror cracked, a sharp, violent sound.

And in the cracks, trapped behind the smoke, I saw the truth. My real father. His face was gray and twisted, his mouth open in a silent, endless scream, trapped and powerless inside the thing that wore his face.

I screamed.

Dr. Wells said, “He was so proud of you for having the courage to come back.”

I woke up in the guest room. I do not remember being moved.

Mom was sitting on the edge of the bed, humming a tuneless, repetitive melody. She said, “You are almost ready. One more session and you will never feel anything detrimental again.”

Outside, I heard Dad talking with someone. His voice was lower now, heavier, and entirely devoid of the human rhythm I remembered. It sounded like something else was speaking through him.

I ran.


I am in a motel two towns away. My clothes still smell faintly of ozone and that sterile metal. I do not think they are my parents anymore. They are a perfectly maintained apparatus designed to lure me back.

And I know the thing inside my father has access to his memories.

Because it keeps calling my phone.
And every time I answer, it says the same thing.
