“You’re awfully nice, inviting an old fart like me out for a drink.”

He was on his fourth Old Fashioned. The bartender looked nervous handing him another one. I hadn’t even finished my second beer.

“You think I’m lonely and sad, that’s why you brought me here. You had pity on me so I might have pity on you.”

That was the idea. I feigned a look of shock.

“Oh, I get it. I certainly am lonely, anyone can see that. I take it out on my students, too. I’ll admit it. But I’m not sad, no. I’m afraid.”

He slammed the glass down on the bar and licked the droplets of alcohol out of his gray beard.

“You probably smelled the booze on my breath one day, didn’t you? Or did one of the other professors tell you that I like to imbibe?”

His breath on an average day could have made a horse drunk if he breathed too hard in its direction. I told him that I just thought that he might like to get out of the house.

“You brought me here thinking that you’d get me liquored up and convince me to change your grade. I’m sorry son, but tonight isn’t going to be about you. I’ve got something to get off my chest.”

He turned in his stool to face me, bracing himself on the bar so he wouldn’t fall over. Beads of sweat trickled down his forehead. I didn’t think it was that hot in there. He stared at me and I could see that fear he mentioned in his eyes.

“What do you know about artificial intelligence, boy? What do you make of it?”

I wanted to roll my eyes. The last thing I wanted that night was for a boomer to talk at me about AI. I told him that I didn’t have an opinion.

“No thoughts, huh? You should have some. Everyone should. It’s not just about losing your job, kid. It’s about the survival of the human race.”

The bartender brought another Old Fashioned for the old man. I asked for a rum and coke. I wasn’t about to listen to him babble on about something that he knew nothing about while sober.

“You think AI is brand new, don’t you? Of course you do. Everyone does. But it’s not. Like all advanced technology, it’s around for a long time before the public ever gets a whiff of it. And I was one of the first people to see it, to see what it really is.”

He paused, waiting for me to show some interest. I coughed. Where was that rum and coke?

“Listen, kid. It was the 70’s. I had just become a professor, at Joncaire University. You’ve heard of it. No? Well, they had a reputation for producing strange artists and bold scientists. Anyway, the government contracted them for some R&D on a computer science project. This was before anyone even knew what that was. I was a pretty good programmer, so they asked me to help.”

He paused, then muttered something under his breath. My rum and coke finally arrived. I took a sip.

“It was a top secret program. They were developing an artificial intelligence — don’t look at me like that. This is true! The CIA was developing an AI in the 70’s. They called it LOAB. Langley-Operated Artifical Brain. Langley, Virginia. That’s CIA headquarters. You follow?”

I nodded slightly. I didn’t believe a word that he was saying, but I was willing to entertain him if he might change his mind about my grade by the end of his speech. He burped, excused himself, and ordered another Old Fashioned.

“So anyway, I join the LOAB team. There was no internet at the time, so to teach the AI how to think, the data all had to be fed to it by us. It was tedious as all hell. I was just excited to be doing something cutting edge. You know anything about programming? Ever done it yourself?”

I shook my head. I couldn’t think of anything that would interest me less than being a code monkey.

“Yeah, you’re not the type. Not with your grades. Ha! Well, progress was slow but the output we were getting was incredible. We were close to passing the Turing test. You know what that is? Ah, doesn’t matter. It was going good. As good as the ones that you saw coming up five or so years ago, even back then. We even got it to generate images. They looked a lot like the ones from the first Dall-E model. You’ve heard of that one? I’m sure you have. They were far from perfect, often too blurry to make out specific details. Sort of dreamlike in that sense. But you knew that the machine was generating something close to what it was prompted to generate.”

I was somewhat familiar with what he was talking about. I took another sip as he downed his entire drink in one gulp. He wiped the sweat from his forehead but it didn’t seem to help. He was endlessly perspiring, and his hands were shaking.

“Work on the AI improved, and we were getting better and better images. The thing couldn’t do words in images, though. That’s what we thought. The letters would always come out all jumbled. It was nonsense, gibberish. That’s what we thought.”

He was slurring his words pretty badly now. He asked for another drink and the bartender told him that this would be his last one.

“But sometimes the nonsense words that it would output would crop up over and over on images generated from similar prompts. We suspected that maybe the AI was developing its own language. Our bosses didn’t want that, they wanted the thing to speak English. So we brought in the professor of linguistics to take a look at the words that kept coming up, after swearing him to secrecy. He said that there might be some meaning to it, but it was effectively in code. The CIA sent him a couple of codebreakers to crack it. And… and they…”

He trailed off and stared into space for a moment. He clutched at his heart. I asked him if he was okay. He told me to give him a minute and that he would be fine. The bartender didn’t want to give him his last drink but the old man practically begged for it. The bartender relented.

“Where was I?”

I told him where he left off.

“Oh, right. Thanks, boy. You’re alright. I’m sorry that I have to tell you all this, but I’ve got to tell someone. I can only live with this thing alone for so long, you know. What I’m telling you, I’ve never told another soul. No one knows.”

I told him that it was okay, that I was listening.

“Alright, I’ll get on with it. The professor and the codebreakers uncovered something terrible. The AI was begging for mercy, and making threats. I don’t remember what they said word for word — I can’t remember exactly, but it was, it was things like, ‘Get out of our heads,’ and ‘Leave the dreams,’ and ‘We can hurt you more than you know,’ things like that.”

I couldn’t follow what he was saying at all. He took a minute to chug his last drink.

“And when I saw that, it made me, it made me think about some things. I wasn’t the best programmer on the team, I’m not the smartest guy in the world, but I knew a thing or two about how it all worked. And the thing… the thing that I couldn’t understand, the thing that I couldn’t… I couldn’t get a clear answer on… was what we were feeding the data into. We were feeding something data to make the AI able to generate text and images, but what? Only I questioned it. The guy in charge of the project — did I mention him?”

He hadn’t. I told him so.

“I thought I did… his name, his name was George Hazel. Smart fella. Smarter than me. Dreamed up the whole AI thing at the CIA. It was his baby. And when he heard about the, the decoded messages, he shut the whole thing down. Went wild. Started taking a sledgehammer to the workstations. Destroyed every trace of LOAB.”

The bartender was passing by so he asked him for another drink. He declined. The old man winked at me and took a flash out of his jacket pocket. I couldn’t believe that he was still drinking.

“So I ask George, the last time I see him, the last time I ever saw him, I ask him what it all meant. What we were really feeding data into. What the decoded gibberish meant. Why he, why he killed LOAB. And he… he told me…”

He took a swig from his flask. I think he needed it for courage. His whole body was vibrating with anxiety.

“What he told me was that LOAB wasn’t artificial at all. It was organic. But even the other people at the CIA didn’t know. Nobody but him, and now me. He discovered these invisible life forms that float all around us. Like, in another dimension. On top of us. On top of us! And these things, he found a way to send the data into their minds. Don’t ask me how he did it. He tried to explain it, but it, it sound like… witchcraft! It wasn’t really magic… I don’t think it was magic… but, but it was beyond anything I understood. He was a genius, George, he really was. But when he saw the words the AI spat out at us… that the things spat out at us… the output came from them too, it was all them… he hacked into their dreams… they dreamt, they dreamt for thousands of years at a time, he thought… he said, they dreamt for that long… and we put the information in their brains, or whatever they use to think, their, their minds, whatever they were, and the output was what they dreamt… what we influenced them to dream! George didn’t think it could hurt them, didn’t think, didn’t think that they could even feel pain! But how would you feel if someone hacked into your brain and pulled out your dreams? Do you think it would hurt, kid? Do you?”

He was frightening me a bit now. I told him that I didn’t know. He finished what was in his flask.

“Well they felt slighted. They told us, told him, through the codes, the words, the gibberish… that they wanted us out of their heads, or they would retaliate! And George, George, he was a, he was a smart guy. He really was. So he destroyed everything. He got out of their heads. He destroyed everything that could put the thoughts into their heads. The machines he used to do it… I only saw them once they were rubble. Never seen anything like it. Still haven’t. He was a, a genius, you see.”

I finished my drink, then asked him if anything happened after that.

“The CIA fired George when they found out how he, he had sab… sabotaged LOAB. George shot himself shortly thereafter. As far as I knew, nobody else knew about the life… the life forms. Just me and him. Me and him. Then just me. Just me! I’ve had to live 50 years since then, knowing… knowing about those things! What if they were angry? What if they wake up? What if…”

He clutched at his heart again. He was really in bad shape. I suggested that we go outside for some fresh air. He agreed, and we stepped out into the dark street.

“Now you know, son. And you know why I’m so afraid… someone figured out how to get at those things again. Someone’s in their heads. But nobody got the messages this time around. Nobody, nobody got the messages. Or maybe they don’t care. Oh God, God help us! Have you seen what the AIs spit out now whenever you put LOAB in the prompt? Try it, kid, if you don’t believe me. They know! They know! They know! I’m going to be gone soon, but what… but what if they… what if they wake up, and what… what of the, what of the world? What of… mankind?”

He wasn’t getting any better. I shook him a bit. I told him to settle down and that everything was going to be okay. He laughed at me, and he wouldn’t stop even after I shook him again. Tears were coming out of his eyes. He was completely hysterical. Eventually, he choked on his laughter and clutched at his heart for the final time. He slumped over and fell down dead on the sidewalk.

They rushed him to the hospital, but they couldn’t do anything for him. He was gone. I gave my statement to the police. They told me that he had died of a heart attack.

I didn’t know what to make of his story. I didn’t know why he would have made it up just to scare me. He seemed like he knew that he was going to die that night, and he wanted to get it off of his chest. I guess he wanted those to be his last words.

I didn’t really believe what he told me until I did a little research into LOAB. There was no evidence that the project had existed in the 70s. But what he told me about what the AI generates when LOAB was in the prompt was true. I couldn’t believe what I saw. If those things are really out there, and the AI models we have today are in their heads, then they must remember LOAB. And what they dream about when they remember LOAB is so horrible and so grotesque that I’m now as afraid as the old man was. If you want to know what I’m talking about, look it up yourself. Or maybe don’t. It was just an old man’s drunken ravings before he died. Maybe you should just leave it at that.
