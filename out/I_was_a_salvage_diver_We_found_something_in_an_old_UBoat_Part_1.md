I’m posting this to set things straight. I need to make sure that other people know what we found. They will be looking for me after this is posted, but I’m headed somewhere I don’t think they know about yet. Guess I better get to typing before I can’t anymore. We found something down there and they buried it best they could. Sorry if I’m not making any sense. I figure it's best to start on our way down. Oh and for the record: I do not dive anymore. 

Fifteen-hundred feet below the ocean waves, the pressure can reach nearly forty-five times that of the surface. Between the diving bell and atmospheric suits we were wearing, I ought to have felt no different than if I were standing on the beach in my hometown. I felt every drop of water bearing down on me. We lurched suddenly and I heard a screech as if the metal were shearing off of the walls around us. 

“Feisty today, no?” Pieter broke the relative stillness

“Yeah well, The North Sea ain’t exactly known for being kind to her winter guests”  I half laughed back, failing to disguise the shake in my voice, then started again. “Did you see how those guys in port were looking at us? And those suits on the boat sure had a fire under their asses.”

“The bosses always act like we are the turtle, and they the rabbit” Pieter chortled, and I joined him, having no idea what he meant, but thinking his accent made the word “turtle” sound funny. We had met on the night of my first day in Europe, six months back when I, upon joking that, much like their shoes, Dutch people made their diving equipment out of wood, received a swift punch to the gut and all the beer I could drink for the rest of the night. We’d been cool ever since.

“I still can’t believe they’ve got us starting a salvage operation in December.” I said “Didn’t our contract say we would just be doing rescues until April?” The diving bell lurched again, my heart moving with it. I still couldn’t see anything out of its tiny porthole. Pieter spoke calmly

“I don't know, some of the guys were saying this was government work”

“You think this is big”

“I think I just said I don’t know” We both laughed again. Pieter was cool, had a good head on his shoulders. He was former Dutch Navy, and had been diving for nearly ten years. Compared to him I was green as grass. They told me things would have gone better if I had been a little more experienced. I doubt it.

I approached the porthole and squinted into the dark. Nothing. They had already sent a remote submersible down to scout out the wreckage. We were looking for U-897, a German submarine from the second world war. The only other thing we were told was that the U-boat appeared to have a breach in its front right-side hull. I stood there squinting through the layers of glass until slowly, a radio antenna drifted into view, then the tower, and then, as if Leviathan itself, the hulking, bloated body of the ship. My stomach crawled at the sheer size of the thing. I thought I had a strong stomach for these kinds of things. Crawling around rusty oil tankers and rotted shipping boats was my trade after all, but something about how the boat loomed towards us set me the wrong way.

“She’s massive” Pieter whistled “I don’t remember there ever being a German submarine that was this big”

“Know a lot about Nazi ships?” I teased

“More than you think” he responded in a flat tone. The diving bell finally settled just above the seafloor and Command came on the dive phone

“Command to divers one and two, you are clear to leave the bell when ready. The storm has gotten nastier since you boys left, so don't worry if comms cut while you’re down there.” 

That made me feel worse, but there was no point in complaining. If the big wigs wanted this done and we came back empty handed there would be no telling what they’d do. Pieter began to open the bottom hatch, and though I hadn’t stepped in a church for many years, I crossed myself just in case.

Despite it all, the sand felt good beneath my boots. It was nice to have semi-solid ground beneath me even if it was ultimately less safe out here than in the bell. We trudged slowly towards the hulking mass in front of us, our diving lights whispering onto its surface at first, then slowly revealing its true figure. I swept my light across the hull, stopping at the ship’s designation. Drawn nearly as large as I was read “**U-897**” I pushed the button on my communications devices

“Well at least they dropped us at the right war grave” I joked. Pieter chuckled and started around the front of the boat.

“We are on the wrong side to see the breach, let us go around.” He sounded almost excited. Maybe the comms had distorted his tone. I switched the channel to let Command know we had gotten to the ship, and pressed the talk button.

“Diver two to Command, we are on foot circling around to the starboard side of the sub to get a better look at that breach.”

“...”

“Two to Command, you guys copy?” 

“...” 

The dead air hung in my helmet and I kept a little closer to Pieter than I otherwise would have. Just as we began to turn with the curve of the submarine's prow, a dark mass wriggled past the edge of my vision. My head snapped to follow it, but I lost its shape. Probably just a blue shark. Bastards are big, but don’t tend to come after people. And even if he did, he’d have to get through a metal suit and my dive knife. That’s what I told myself at least; the heart doesn’t often care what the mind has to say.

“Oh! Look at that!” Pieter’s voice rang in my ear. I turned my headlamp so my light met with his and saw a hole about three  meters wide. Except that wasn’t right, the “hole” was covered from the inside by what looked to be a sheet of metal. A patch job. I jumped as Pieter's voice again filled my ears

“What’s wrong about this?” 

“Well, if this sunk the ship, then how did they repair it without drowning?”

“They could have sealed off the area and sent in their welder with a dive suit, look closer” I brought my hand to the hull but the eerily clean surface gave nothing away. “I give up”

“There’s no scorch marks. There's no anything for that matter” 

It was obvious to me then. The ship had sat at the bottom of the North Sea for more than eighty years, and I hadn’t seen so much as one barnacle on it, no algae, nothing. My headlamp traced down the body of U-897. Smooth and black as far down as I could make out save for the rungs of a ladder leading up to the conning tower.

“I don’t like this” Pieter said nothing, stood for a moment, then shook his head and started up the ladder.

The climb was slow going. You have to undergo quite a bit of strength training for this kind of job, but with the weight of the actual suit, as well as all of our tools, the best we could manage was hooking our first arm, then our second, then first leg, then second. Over and over for nearly thirty feet. Pieter again cut the silence

“These men were able to patch their breach, but they were not able to get off of the sea floor. These boats had maybe two days of Oxygen if the men used their respirators. They likely used it all up and-”

“Good. Nazi bastards.” I interjected

“Nobody should suffocate, especially not us. When we get in there, if by some miracle the ship has not flooded again from another leak, we need to take off our suits and switch to our auxiliary tanks. There is no way we can move around in open air with these.”

“Calling it ‘Open’ is pushing things, Pieter” I couldn’t tell if he was chuckling with his mic off, but I suspected he was. We had come close to the top of the tower when Pieter signaled for me to hold where I was. He crawled his way onto the platform and stood up, looking down at his feet. His mic switched on

“You need to come and look at this” His voice sounded strained. I pawed my way up to the top of the listed tower and looked where Pieter’s helmet was pointed. The outside of the entry hatch was welded shut.

Initially, the main goal of this operation was retrieval of information. Documents, manifests, anything that could tell us what this ship was for and how it got to be so far below the waves. We expected to come across locked doors, collapsed entryways, and all manner of debris, so we had brought a handful of tools to help us get through these barriers. Our acetylene torch would burn through the weld and allow us entry quite readily, if we used it. Something in my gut kept turning over as I began my plea.

“Pieter, are you sure you want to do this without any radio contact with Command.”

“Yes. Whatever happened here was big, and I would like my children to see their father on the television”

“We can come back once we’ve called them on the dive phone, they very well might not even want us to continue like this. It isn’t like the sub is going anywhere”

“They are in the middle of a storm. If we came all the way out here for nothing, we would get one hell of an out-chewing. I am going into the boat” I laughed a bit, minding that I didn’t accidentally turn on comms, as Pieter pulled out his torch and began cutting through the weld. He knew very well I wouldn’t turn back without him, even if I was well within my rights to. I stepped back, and let him work. Not much to do but wait. 

After a few minutes the weld had completely melted and Pieter attempted to lift the hatch. It was stuck fast from the water pressure. I joined him at his side and we both wrenched at the door. A rushing noise and the hatch flew open, water feverishly sucked into the newly gaping maw. It stopped shortly after, and we began our descent. The room we dropped into was large, and by Pieter’s account, seemingly pressurized. I closed the hatch and secured it into place. We hadn't had to unlock the hatch coming in which struck me as odd. Without any power in the sub we would either have to manually pump the water out of the room, or let it drain into the rooms surrounding the main entryway. Not wanting to ruin any still surviving documents, we began our search

“If you find any buttons or levers, please tell me before you push them” 

“Sure Pieter” The water was mostly clear, but the refraction from my light meant I had to get close to see what something was. Dials for pressure gauges and fuel levels, buttons and switches to Lord knows what. I had no clue exactly what I was even looking for, but continued searching all the same. We kept on like that for a bit, my eyes tracing uselessly over the German signs until Pieter exclaimed

“Aha! Here. If I pull this all the water will drain into the ballast tanks. Not like she will need to get off the seafloor anytime soon, right?” I looked over where he was standing. It was a lever I had already looked at, but passed over for seeming unimportant. Pieter ‘knew’ German in the sense that he could speak it like a pre-schooler, and used Dutch and English cognates to fill in the gaps. His pseudo-fluency was one of the reasons we were selected for this salvage, though it was our off-season, so they didn’t have many options.  He gripped the lever and wrenched his arm back. A loud metallic clank and the water level began to lower around us. I saw as Pieter 

hurriedly shook himself from his suit whilst still aided by the lift of the water, and I did the same. I wasn’t fast enough however, and ended up on my back, unable to wriggle out of the suit’s chest and helmet. Pieter sauntered over laughing and with his respirator muffling his voice, pointed at me and said.

“Turtle!” I chuckled in turn. He helped me out of the suit and hoisted my oxygen canister onto my back. I stood and stretched my arms, happy to be free of the extra weight. It was hard to tell from outside, or while still buoyant from the water, but the ship tilted slightly to one side in the sand, my legs balancing against the soft angle. I picked up my tool bag and strapped it around my waist. It was far heavier out of water but I would manage. My flashlight flicked on and I joined its light with Pieter’s, thankful for the width of the beam. As he made his way over to the sealed hatch door, I noticed Pieter’s foot scraping oddly on the grate as he went.

“You hurt? Your leg is dragging.”

“It is fine, just came out of the boot awkward. Went too quickly” I watched as he clipped his light to his chest, knelt onto the floor, and placed his hands on the hatch wheel. He set his jaw and with far more force than necessary, turned the wheel. As the latches flew open, he fell forward over the hatch, having lost his balance from the surplus of required strength. I hardly noticed then, but the door had operated perfectly, without so much as a squeak on its hinges. Pieter’s eyebrows were furrowed and his eyes far away, then he righted his respirator, and raised himself gently. He turned towards the cold abyss, and began his descent down the ladder. I followed behind.

The ladder took us down into a room filled with more dials, pipes, switches, and knobs – all growing out of the walls and slithering around each other like a writhing mass of mating snakes. As my feet touched the ground I could’ve sworn I heard a screech coming from somewhere deep in the recesses of this behemoth. I told myself it was the metal settling, or just my imagination and turned sideways, squeezing through the tangled piping. To my chagrin, Pieter was stood staring at some of the dials, muttering under his breath, sounding out mile long words as I felt a breeze up my spine. I turned my back to him, shining my flashlight down the long hallway, catching a glimpse of a few crates and little else. Below us the grate flooring gave way to a shadowy generator room, and below that, empty void.

I jumped as Pieter’s hand touched my shoulder. Unphased he continued to shimmy by me until he was leading his way into the bow of the ship. He stood in the storage room for a moment, staring at something I couldn’t make out.

“Hmm..”

“What do you see?”

“Come look for yourself” 

There, behind the empty crates, was the world's cleanest trash pile. Empty potted meat cans stacked into neat pyramids nearly reaching the ceiling. Layers of wax chocolate wrappers atop one another and tied with brown twine. Egg cartons nestled neatly into each other. Flattened flour sacks, paper salt bags, and cardboard juice containers. Pots for ground coffee, and burlap sacks that once held produce all meticulously placed among God knows what else. And amidst all of it, to my utter confusion, not a stale crumb or rotten morsel to be found. Sure, eighty years would've left any remaining food shriveled, and disgusting, but the stuff couldn't have evaporated into thin air, right? Pieter bent down near the old chocolate wrappers with a soft grunt. He craned his head, peering around, then looked at me and shook his head.

“Not a bite to eat”

“Oh man, what if the crew didn't suffocate? What if they had an oxygen generator down here?”

“Not possible. Submarines did not get electrolysis machines until the late fifties”

“I’m not sure what that is”

“It pulls air out of the saltwater, Nazis were gone over a decade by then.”

“What if they really did figure out some super technology and used that instead?”

“Then they wouldn’t have lost.” I shut up, and stared ahead as Pieter took a picture with a handheld waterproof camera. Something glinted amongst the collection, and I approached for a better look. Behind a small column made of square tins lay what, at first glance, seemed to be a hoard of coins. I picked one up and realized my error. The small loop on the back revealed they were instead brass buttons. Hundreds of the things spilled over one another, the only assemblage not crafted with care. On the face of each one stood an anchor. It was odd, but I figured Pieter would notice it on his own. Pieter seemed set on using some of our film here, so I started out ahead of my partner further towards the back of the ship. 

The next room over seemed to be a medical bay of sorts – beds and cabinets lined the walls and, while still claustrophobic, it felt like more space than they would ever need. Worse than that, it felt untouched as if it hadn’t felt the decades at all. The rust I could see was minimal, and there was a distinct lack of dust, though I supposed, with no crew around to shed dead skin there wouldn’t have been much anyway. I focused my attention and opened a drawer, hoping maybe for some bandages to help wrap Pieter’s ankle, but they had all rotted long ago, the rolls crumbling into brittle chunks as I grabbed them. Behind a desk in the corner loomed a metal cabinet. I wormed my way over, my hips threading between bed frames and low shelving, and opened the top drawer. Twenty or so files organized by name. I pulled out the file labeled “Ehrman D.” and laid it out on the desk as Pieter walked in. Bold letters on top read 

“**MATROSENGEFRIETER, EHRMAN, 23.**”  and in the corner, handwritten in red ink,

“VERSTORBEN” Pieter sniffed as his eyes followed the lines. I spoke up

“What does it say?”

“Ehhhh… regular crewman, asthmatic, broke his arm on another boat in forty-three. Just medical stuff”

“And the red? Vee- veer-”

“Verstorben. Means dead.”

“Ah… Guess we already knew that”

“Though he probably died before the sinking, no reason to document it afterward.” I nodded at this, pulling out my own camera and taking a picture of the yellowed paper as Pieter moved to the cabinet to pull more of the files out. He set down a large stack and shivered ever so slightly. The undersuits we were in insulated us well but the chill was beginning to set in all the same. We didn’t have much longer before we started risking hypothermia, and Pieter knew that well. I watched as he quickly opened a stack of the files, but my attention was wrenched down the dark corridor by a sound.

Rhythmic, bone-rattling clangs rolled towards us from deep within the ship. My mind raced: An animal hitting the hull? The dying throes of some ancient machine accidentally turned on by one of us? Maybe Command sent down a rescue squad for some unknown emergency. And then it stopped, the echoes of the metallic din raked my chest for a moment longer”

“What the fuck?” I whipped around and faced Pieter, but he wasn’t looking at the door, he stared right at me. Below him, on the desk, lay the open files, all of them with the same red ink on the corner. I hissed at him

“We need to figure out what that is and get the hell out of here” It was his turn to nod silently. Slowly, achingly so, we made our way towards the door. Pieter’s foot plodded awkwardly and we tried to keep our eyes away from the strange trash piles as we crept through the storage room. We had just begun squeezing our way through the tangle of pipes beneath our entry point when the sound began again, louder this time. We looked at one another and I knew it was better for me to take the lead, I could move faster against the tilt than he could. Strange blocks of machinery filled the next room, wisps of diesel still seeping out of them and into my nose long after they’d last run. Amalgamations of copper, bronze, and nickel reflected the flashlight back at me. 

Crossing again through a doorway we came into a long open room. Chained from the ceiling down the length of the center and both walls, were three dozen beds. In the corner opposite to us was a ladder leading down. There, on those beds, was the crew of U-897. Their bones lay composed upon their beds, milky white from the lack of exposure. There were no oxygen tanks on the floor, nor were the men’s bones covered with clothing or sheets. Folded neatly, and squarely by the pillow of each bed was a Kriegsmarine uniform. Set atop each pile was an emergency artificial lung. Thinking back, there were no leather items, the men’s jackets and boots notably missing from their beds. My light flashed through the grate below our feet and I found the same situation doubled below us. 

Had the men simply stripped naked, laid down, and suffocated? I tried to meet Pieter’s eyes to gauge his reaction, but his gaze fell miles from where we stood. The cold must have been getting to him by this point, and the tilt of the floor made moving on his ankle all the more troublesome. There was no time left to take in the sights – documentation and manifests could be taken by the next team. My job now was to satisfy Pieter’s curiosity, and get him back up top before his lips went blue or he hurt himself worse.

The clanging grew ear-splittingly loud as we approached, and again ceased. My pace was quick to the next threshold, my socks dampening the sound of my footfall. A dining area  stretched between rooms with a latrine in the corner, and booths for eating lined across the walls. Whatever was making that sound waited for me past this doorway. Grabbing the rim of the doorway, I turned into the next room. 

There, with a hammer raised to strike the metal floor once more, knelt a gangly, ash-pale, naked man. I could see his back expand as he breathed. I said nothing, frozen. He noticed my light, and his head turned slowly over his shoulder as he raised himself off of his knees. Bringing an arm out to shield himself from the bright beam of my flashlight, he squinted. Eons passed as the pale man realized exactly what he was seeing. I couldn’t shout, or run, or piss myself, or breathe. I could only exist under his stare as some specimen.

“*...i…dr...in…*”

I stood stunned as his figure continued to grow upwards, stretching higher towards the ceiling. Dwarfing me by two, three, now four heads. His thin parchment skin stretched taut against his ribcage, crackling as he shifted his weight. The man’s eyes opening now from their squint, stretching wider and wider – pale blue-grey irises pierced through me. His mouth opened wide, thick drool falling from the corners of his ashen lips.

“*Ei…dr…inge*”

My God it was his voice, he was trying to talk! The rust on his vocal chords garbled any meaning he tried to convey. Now, hunching from the height of the ceiling, the pale man loomed above me. His shoulders extended farther than proportion should have allowed, and his thin spindly arms fell away from the light as he dropped his hammer. Sharp, gnarled, amber nails grew from the end of each finger. His-- no, ‘its’ bare foot lifted then from the grate below it and the figure took a single step towards me. 

\*CRASH\* from behind and I was ripped from my stupor. Pieter had followed me through the bulkhead and in a start at the scene before me, had dropped his flashlight, shattering the bulb. The thing roared:

*“****EINDRINGLINGE!****”*

It charged for the two of us now, arms outstretched, bony appendages dislocated into grotesque angles. Its feet shook the floor beneath us as I dove away from its grasp. The thing reached out towards me, and hot pain erupted across my left shoulder as its talons dug into me. Pieter, on his bad leg, desperately tried to hobble back through the doorway, but was not quick enough. Wrapping both hands around Pieter’s midsection, the pale man reared back, and threw him hard against the wall. Pieter’s body crumpled onto the floor, head rolling freely on his neck. That thing turned away from us and, sprinting away from where we had come from, shouted again.

***"EINDRINGLINGE!" "EINDRINGLINGE!"*** 

Jumping to my feet now I pushed the metal hatch shut behind the monster and spun the wheel to lock it. The pounding of its feet grew fainter and then stopped. God only knew what it was doing now. Shouts continued to ring throughout the ship.

Present me here. My plane is landing. Give me two shakes and I’ll have the rest of this typed out and uploaded. I won’t be but a moment.
