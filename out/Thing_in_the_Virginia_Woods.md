I have a few spooky stories from this time in my life, so if you’d like to hear them, just let me know. So, like the title says, this story is about the man we met by the bridge. Around 11 years ago, I was living in Appalachia, Virginia, with my mother, father, and dog in a small country home. Now, Appalachia, VA, is quite rural on its own, but my family and I decided to go on a mini camping trip with a couple of family friends. We went to a beautiful camping ground called New River Gorge National Park. 

Back then, it was a bare little area sprinkled with cabins but absolutely nothing else throughout the miles of thick forests and brush. Nothing except the small river and the bridge. We took about a 4-hour drive around the countryside and then reached the site and found our way to an area to set up camp and wait for our family and friends to arrive. Once the other two families got there, we were all pretty tired, so we helped set up and got to bed. The next day, we were all looking forward to spending the sunlight with some smores, camping, watching the gorgeous scenery, and some light fishing since my friend's dad had brought some poles and nets. 

There were three of us: me and my two friends, whom we’ll call Kyle and Sam (fake names). We spent the day laughing and hiking, and the last of the sunlight caught some little fish and crawdads in the river. This river was directly below a rickety old bridge that was said to be haunted. When the sunlight finally ran out, mine and Sam’s parents, along with Kyle’s dad, were heading back to the campsite, but us kids somehow convinced our parents to let us stay by the river for a bit longer. 

We were 12 and 13 after all. What's the worst that could happen? The three of us sat on some large rocks by the river, just shooting the crap, joking around, telling scary stories, and eating our leftover snacks from the earlier hike. We had been there for 2ish hours after our parents had left, so it would have been around 10 o'clock at night, pitch black other than the lights of our lanterns and little G5 keyboard phones. After telling stories to scare each other, we got the bright idea to hike up the hill by the river so that we could get a closer view of the long wooden bridge above us. 

Like I said before, this bridge was said to be haunted, and we wanted a bigger scare than our stupid little camp stories could offer. So we went up the hill. This was our first mistake. With lanterns glowing gold and a dim light illuminating our path ahead, we trudged up the hill, the chill autumn breeze stabbing our skin with tiny freezing needles through our vests. We were hanging out again, trying to scare each other with ghost stories we’d heard from elders in our neighborhood about this bridge. 

That's when we heard it. This rustling in the woods that sort of sounded like a larger animal, which we thought might be a coyote or even a bear. This scared us enough, but what scared us much more was the painful silence of the forest. No crickets, no birds, no pitter patters of field mice. Just. Silence. 

We got this eerie feeling that sent shivers down our spines when Kyle, the 13-year-old very avid camper with a boy scout history, suggested we shut off our lanterns and drop to a whisper until it goes away. Surprise, it didn't. In what felt like an eternity of silent listening but was probably 10 minutes in reality, we heard this rustling getting closer. But what confused us was that there were two consecutive footsteps at a time. Bears have four legs, not two. At this point, we were convinced we were being stalked by a ghost or one of the many people who died on this bridge, according to those we've spoken to. 

We were still and silent for another 5 minutes when the rustling was about 15 feet away from us. Mind you, if we were to run down this hill, we would go flying because it was so steep. So we were dead still and huddled next to each other to hide when the rustling stopped. We began to hear this odd crunching sound in place of it. It sounded like a small animal trying to crunch on some bones from its last meal. But it was... wetter, strained even. 

At that point, we realized this was just some animal that couldn't be that big and probably had no idea we were even there. Feeling stupid, we stood up with our lanterns lit, and Kyle made some noises to shoo it away. When I looked back, though, Sam was behind me, crouched like he pissed himself, and I will never forget the look of sheer terror on his face. Confused, I followed his gaze to a tree in front of us and noticed Kyle starting to stumble backward. When my eyes adjusted to the night, I realized what I had seen and what Sam had been seeing. It was a man. Just sitting at the very top of the hill, bent over, is this strange and distorted position, eating off of something. 

He stood up slowly, just staring at us as we followed his every move with our eyes. Were we seeing a ghost of this bridge? If this was a man, what was he doing sitting like that? Then, as if in unison, we gasped. This man was naked. It had to be about the end of September, and autumn is not friendly in the mid-Atlantic. It was COLD that night. Yet this guy was sitting out here naked? For how long? What was he doing there? And what the hell is he eating off of? We were frozen in shock, but Kyle called out, “Hey! Are you okay out here?”. I kid you not, this guy starts walking toward us with this poltergeist-esque stagger and one arm bent. At this point, Sam and I are crapping bricks, and I'm clawing at Kyle’s arm, trying to signal to him that we needed to hightail it the absolute hell out there, but he persisted in trying to help this psycho. 

Kyle grew up with just his dad in a sort of trailer parky area, so he was not easily rattled. That's until we got a glimpse of what this guy was snacking on. Glass. The psycho was gripping a large shard of glass. Blood dripped from his hand, and he seemed to be covered in it along with caked dirt from being out here for, god knows, how long. We simultaneously hauled butt down that hill, and with no surprise, all three of us went soaring through the air at what felt like a million miles an hour, screaming like wild animals. We were able to regroup and collect ourselves, now covered in scrapes, splinters, and bruises, and Sam with a gnarly gash in the middle of his forehead. 

We were still running back to our campsite, which was about a 15-minute walk, but we managed it in about 5 minutes, high on adrenaline and pure primal fear. On our way back, we heard this blood-curdling shriek, almost like a deep guttural roar more than a human scream. We made it back to our parents, panting and looking like some cave people covered in blood and mud. We left our lanterns up on that hill, so we emerged from the pitch-black brush, yelling like maniacs about what we had seen. Our parents had a mixed look of pissed off, horrified, and “I knew we shouldn't have left these morons at the river." 

Luckily, we were able to get a hold of a ranger, and we explained what had happened at the bridge. It seemed like he wanted to chalk it up to kids scaring themselves on the “haunted” bridge, but seeing our sheer terror, it seemed like he believed us. We were cleaned up and told that a group of rangers would go and patrol the area. We didn't sleep a wink that night and got the hell out of dodge first thing in the morning. Sam ended up with a concussion, and Kyle and I managed with only a couple of small scars on our arms and legs. 

We never went back to that park preserve, and over the next few years, we would randomly bring up the encounter to see if it had really happened or was just some sort of messed-up dream. It wasn't. Nothing came of the patrol, as far as I know, and who knows? Maybe it really was a ghost. But we know what we saw, and we have the marks to prove it. About 4 years later, I moved down south and gradually lost contact with Sam and Kyle, although I still have them added on Facebook, and we are all doing well now. 

I still tell this story to my friends and co-workers, and I've heard a few suggestions over the years, like maybe we saw something like a skinwalker or a wendigo that night. Some of my friends brought up SCP and other cryptid stories that sound like what we encountered, but I'm not a superstitious person, and I'll always believe we saw some poor old bald man who lost his home, his clothes, his identity, and then his mind. Believe what you will about this story, and I welcome what you think it might've been, but it is 100% real and the scariest thing I've ever seen in my decades of living. Sorry if this story is a bit long-winded. I hope you have a good night.
