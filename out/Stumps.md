PART 1

I recently posted an experience of mine. Please read that before reading this post if you haven't already. If you do not, I would guess that none of the following would make any sense.

Things have been going well for me since I uploaded my last post. I talked to James and Aiden again. Both of them had recently (together) gone back up the trail and venture into the forest to see if they could find any evidence of that absolute lunatic that had caused Takuma's disappearance all those years ago. Why they did this, I haven't a single clue.

The three of us got together again a few days ago after they had jumped the fence into my backyard because I'd ignored their knock at my door. James tripped over an old stump and almost broke his wrist landing on it, the knob. After a few minutes of small talk the conversation somehow progressed to that night years ago, and ultimately ended with the man in the woods. James, ever the supernatural enthusiast, was convinced it was the person from the story his father used to tell him.

"I'm telling you man, who else would be out there? This is crazy."

I stared at him for a moment. "Are you okay James? It's a walking trail. It's not exactly an area that's hard to get to. There are a lot of weird people around here. I know it's...hard to admit, but Takuma was kidnapped by someone who is just sick in the head."

Aiden, still a quiet man, finally chipped in. "Yeah I dunno James, it's kind of far-fetched. What if your dad just made it up to scare you so that you wouldn't go wandering?"

James looked at Aiden, his gaze hardening. "Seriously? You think...After...You.." He paused for a moment, looking down at his shoes. Aiden was visibly nervous. He fidgeted with his hands and his leg started jittering slightly.

"James are you alright? Do you need some water? I've got some things in the fridge as well, if you'd like," I said quietly.

James' head snapped to me. His voice cracked as he spoke. "I'm okay. I'm okay. I just need a moment."

He was quiet for a long, uncomfortable time before talking again. "Aiden, you-we went out there again last week. Why would you come with me if you didn't think we would find anything?"

"I, ah, I wanted to help you realize that the thought of there being a century old thing in the woods was unhealthy and I-"

"Hold on, what kind of logic is that?" I asked in a low tone. "Aiden all you accomplished was feeding his delusions. You shouldn't have gone out there with him."

Again there was silence as James looked back and forth between us. I could see the anger rising in his face, although I couldn't guess where it was coming from. He bit his lip.

"Sam, I saw him."

I furrowed my brow. "Yeah, we all saw him. My father did as well. So did yours."

James shook his head. "No. You don't understand. I saw him again." I was taken aback for a moment, before leaning in slightly. I motioned for him to continue and he took a deep breath. "I went out into the Gorge before reaching out to Aiden again. I took my hunting rifle in case the bastard showed up again and tried to take me out. I got about halfway through before I decided to turn back, and I saw him in the trees. Staring at me." His eyes welled up and he looked to the ceiling before continuing. "I swung the rifle off my shoulder and took a shot at him, but he was gone by the time I'd bolted a second round. I got the hell out of there as soon as I could, man."

It took a moment for me to go over what he'd said in my mind. "So, let me get this straight, you took a goddamn rifle into the Gorge, an area where people still go to regularly, and shot at someone that was in the trees? What the hell is wrong with you James? If the police couldn't find him, neither can you. You shot at some random person, probably scared the hell out of them too."

I was starting to think there was something seriously wrong with James. He'd taken a firearm into an area where the public still frequented and shot at the first person he saw. Who the hell would do that kind of thing?

I made up my mind. "Listen, James, if it makes you feel any better I'll go out there-into the Gorge-with you again. You guys can stay here the night if you'd like, but you need to put this behind you after tomorrow." I was prepared to try and help him and if that meant I'd walk through the Gorge, that was fine by me.

James' face lit up. "Really? Thank you man. I just need to go home and get my rifle-"

I cut him off. "You're not bringing the damn gun. I don't want you getting a scare and shooting me in the head." James face dropped a little a bit at that, but he still seemed happy just to have me go back with him and Aiden. Aiden's face whitened slightly after the mention of going back but he made no complaint.

They both stayed at my house for the night. We got takeaways and lounged around for the evening, before I showed them the guest rooms of my home and got ready to sleep.

I woke the next morning before the others did. I rubbed my eyes and stood from my bed, throwing on whatever clothes I saw first. I walked to the kitchen and poured myself cereal before I noticed something on  the inside of one of the windows. I stared at it for a moment while eating my breakfast. I was a bit confused at first before I realized what it was. It was a little sticker of a man grinning. A chill ran down my spine as I put down my bowl and tore it off the window. As I did, James walked into the kitchen behind me.

"Hey, have you gotten anything ready?"

I spun around, my eyes wide. "We're not going."

His brow furrowed. "You-What? Why not?"

"We aren't going." I showed him the sticker and he let out a strained, nervous laugh.

"It's just a sticker, come on dude. Aiden probably thought it'd be funny to stick something like what we found on that tree. You can find stickers of frowning guys everywhere."

"Why the hell would he do that?" I asked quickly before registering what he said. "Wait, frowning? It's smiling." I looked at the sticker again and saw that its face was now frowning.

"Are you blind? It's obviously frowning."

"No. No no no. It was just grinning. I swear."

He looked at me like I was crazy. "Listen, if you don't want to go, you don't have to. I would really appreciate it if you did come with us though. Aiden and I are going either way."

I continued to stare down at the sticker on my thumb. Before my eyes, the stickers face once more curled into a wide grin. I tried to pull my hand away, forgetting it was a sticker. I took a moment to laugh internally at my idiocy before pointing my thumb towards James again.

"Woah, what the hell? It was frowning wasn't it?"

"Yeah, it was. As soon as you said that you guys are going it started grinning again. This is weird James."

He was quiet for a moment. "I told you some weird shit is happening Sam. You didn't believe me."

I stared at him incredulously. I raised my voice slightly. "James, you told me about how you shot at someone in the woods. You did not say that *anything* weird was happening at all. Don't you try and make me feel like an idiot."

There was the sound of glass breaking somewhere in the house. James' eyes widened and my head snapped to the direction the sound came from. I armed myself with a rolling pin and slowly moved towards the commotion. I walked into the hallway and hugged the wall, ready to throw the rolling pin at any intruder.

*Why the fuck did I grab a rolling pin? What am I going to do with this? Give them a headache before they gut me with a knife?*

Before I had time to finish that thought, I reached the end of the hallway. To my left, where the noise had come from, was the back door to my home. I turned the corner and saw that the window next to the door had been completely obliterated. I crept towards it and peeked outside, sweeping my gaze over my backyard.

A shiver ran through my body suddenly. There was an axe dug into the stump in my yard.
