Every flashlight in Moreau Bay scoured the forest for my missing wife, Jemma. All except his. His light pointed to the open water and lit a path to his strange little island about a kilometer from the coast. Two weeks passed with no signs of her and all I thought about was the outcast who fled her search party. She had a funeral, a plot in the cemetery, and a headstone inscribed with her name, but she was still out there. No one is presumed dead after two weeks. I didn't know what happened to her, I was convinced it had something to do with the hermit named Vaughn.

“We don’t get many pretty faces here. Gotta head down to Bécancour for that” Vaughn told today's guest. His voice grated me like a fly buzzing by my ear but never in sight. The three of us huddled in the sickly musk of Corpse 14. A specimen still in the early stage of active decay despite being here three weeks before my arrival.  The cold in northern Ontario froze time itself it seemed. 

Vaughn called her Carol. An elderly woman who at the time of her death had dedicated her life to a small bakery in Moreau Bay which, after her passing, was operated by her daughter. I clenched my teeth when he told me the story of a corpse. Vaughn, a man who gushed over the dead and abandoned the living. Even in her most dire moment. I pulled a dying flower from my pocket, encased in a plastic sleeve. I rubbed my thumb over the pistil until I was calm again. As much as I wanted to put a fist through his face, it wasn't in her best interest to keep calm.

Our guest didn’t acknowledge Vaughn. His knees quivered like a frightened child. He slipped his hand into his coat sleeve to scratch at the underbelly of his forearm. His eyes were expressionless and locked on Corpse 14.

A typical, above-board body farm would exist for scientific purposes. They would be used to study the decay process and serve as a reference for law enforcement. Law enforcement never came to the island. Only two types of people paid for a look at Vaughn's horror show. Creeps, and creeps pretending to be writers. Our guest that day was the latter.

“She had a dog. Unfortunately, the dog got hungry before the cops got to her.” Vaughn explained. Corpse 14 had deep gashes through the face that dug into the skull. Its face was unrecognizable, something it had in common with every other corpse I monitored on the southern side of the island. Though I was never permitted to go north of the main cabin, I was sure they were equally mangled. I had no clue how one would acquire bodies donated to science but these would be the cheap ones a piece of shit farm like Vaughn could afford.

"A dog." The guest rattled before slowly twisting his head to meet Vaughn's eyes. The guy's gurgly voice turned Vaughn's skin paste-white behind his grey-tainted beard. The sight almost allowed my sympathy to crack through my disdain for the man. Almost.

“Well. Anything else we can do for you?” Vaughn asked. The guest locked his gaze with Vaughn for a few more achingly long moments before he turned and swayed southward towards the dock. His knees still wobbled with each step.

“What was this guy’s name?” Vaughn asked me under his breath.

"Jacob H." I said.

“I hope Jacob doesn’t use a pen name. I want to avoid this weirdo’s writing like the plague.” Vaughn said with a grin. I reciprocated with an unconvincing chuckle while watching Jacob Highsmith step further down the southbound path. The more I watched him, the less I felt his wobbly knees resembled a frightened child. It was more like a newborn fawn, getting used to the weight of its new body. He took the first turn on the path and disappeared into the trees.

"Same goes for you too, Harrison!" Vaughn added with a chummy jab of his elbow and a cigarette-toothed laugh. Harrison was my real name. I scoured the papers before my arrival on the island to make sure I wasn't named. Vaughn also wasn't a social butterfly so I knew he wouldn't have heard my name around town. For the first time since I stepped foot on the disgusting island, I genuinely laughed too. I knew my cover story worked. To Vaughn, I was another creep pretending to be a writer.

“Can you paddle him to town? I’ll make the rounds on the southside this evening.” Vaughn asked when his laughter died down. I thought I’d rather spend time with the corpses than Jacob Highsmith, but I obliged and hurried after the creep.

***

On the path, the trees masked most of the remaining sunlight. My flashlight gave a dim, orange glow to the dirt ahead. I knew I was only five corpses from reaching the dock, so with each plume of rotted stench I walked through, I counted. Corpse 15, 16, then 17 passed with no sign of Jacob. The man moved with the speed and grace of a toddler. He couldn't have gone far. I flicked the light through trees and only found low-hanging branches. The path behind me was empty as well. Only the wind howling through the woods accompanied me. An urge to shout out to him was immediately squashed by a sharp snap coming from the trees behind me.

I pointed my flashlight where the sound originated and found nothing. I picked up the pace. My light shot side to side to catch each snap and I only moved forward when I confirmed it was a branch. Instincts pricked at my stomach to tell me I was being watched by hidden eyes. As I walked into the sharp stench of Corpse 18 I heard a whisper. It was soft and blended seamlessly into the breeze. I couldn't tell what it said but its pattern was human and far too high-pitched to be Jacob. I froze for an instant before frantically shaking the flashlight's beam through the trees. A figure moved among the branches.

With a full head of steam, I plowed through the smell of Corpse 18 and straight into the clearing of the coast. The water lapped against the muddy beach and the last sliver of sunlight was made a little brighter as it bounced off of the fishy lake and warmed my face. Jacob was nowhere to be found. I rationalized it must have been him in the woods. He must have been trying to get a rise out of me. 

"Jacob! Cut the shit man, you gotta go!" I shouted into the woods, but only silence was returned.

“You’ve got five minutes! If your ass isn’t in the boat you can keep it in the woods!”

I turned and stepped out onto the dock. Each plank of wood yelped under my weight. I kept my light down to avoid the holes that showed the water below. After a few steps, the dock came to an end. The cleat the boat was tied to only held a rope, severed a half meter from the knot. The small two-seater that once swayed atop the waves, sat at the bottom of the lake. Holes punctured the boat's floor. Its edges were beaten and crushed like a soda can.

I couldn’t believe it. No person could do such damage to a boat. Maybe a bear, but how? The island had no animals aside from the occasional duck stopping for a rest. I stepped off of the dock and examined the mud for a clue as to what did this. Hoof tracks strung from the edge of the dock among the cluster of shoe prints. I followed the tracks all the way to the treeline until I heard the noise again. This time it was distinct.

“I’m so hungry, Dad” The unfamiliar, high-pitched voice of a young boy pleaded to me from deep in the trees behind the bushes. I shined my light over them and only caught a glimpse. A full rack of antlers swayed side to side and vanished back into the shadows.

***

I went back to the dock in the morning. With each step, I surveyed the forest and found no sign of the antlers or children. Had I mistaken branches for a full rack of antlers? Had I hallucinated the boy's voice? Unlikely. But I had to know for sure. I passed the unwelcoming stench of Corpse 18 and saw the dock. I searched over the bushes and past the treeline and again it was empty. Only branches, none of which resembled antlers with their movement in the wind. The frigid nights hardened the muddy grounds and preserved the evidence of life from the night prior. I searched the water's edge first. I hoped to find the spot at which the deer swam ashore but found nothing. I searched every inch of the beach clearing and the hoof prints only started at the end of the dock's wood planks and led into the woods. It was as if the animal docked before coming ashore. All of the surrounding shoe prints were too large to be mistaken for children. I followed my shoe prints from the night prior as they trailed beside the hoofs. They were too similar. They were spread apart in an identical pattern. The animal seemed to walk on two feet.

I heard the rumble of an engine.

“Hi there! Mr. Vaughn not round today?” Called a voice from over the water.

I turned to see the mailman's familiar black, unkempt beard wrapped around his jaw and topped with a bulbous, cherry-red nose. I recoiled at the sight of him. The mail man was sure to be familiar with my wife's disappearance.  It was possible he knew my face, and could blow my cover. But, nothing was around to mask myself. So I threw the hood of my coat over my head and hoped for the best.

"He's caught up in something," I called back.

"No trouble in the slightest. I s'pose I'm running pretty early." He assured me. I felt his eyes study my face. The rusted gears in his brain churned to pinpoint why I looked so familiar.  I wiped my brow to break eye contact. He continued.

"Anyways, I'm supposed to hand-deliver Mr. Vaughn's mail but you'll do just as fine I imagine."

He pulled a sealed envelope from his bag. I kept my eyes to the ground and hoped the brim of my hood masked my face as I took it from his hand.

“I s’pose it fell off my desk at the office so it’s a few days late getting here. Boss said it had to get here ‘pronto’. I figure it don’t get more ‘pronto’ than the butt-crack of dawn eh?”

He gave his own joke a laugh before turning his attention to the mangled boat on the lake floor.

“Goodness. You know, I can have a new boat ordered for you. I don’t think Davey’s got any more in the shop so it may be a few weeks.”

"That would be good," I said as short as possible.

"Yeah well… Have V. radio in when he's got his payment ready. And same goes for if you folks need anything in the meantime… And 'course I'll come round when there's mail to bring."

"Thanks. Will do," I said before turning towards the treeline to retreat. I heard his boat engine sputter before roaring again, ready to take him back to the mainland. I took a sigh of relief at the close call, before he screamed over the volume of his engine.

“And I was real sorry to hear about your wife. It was a damn shame.”

Shit.

***

Snow started to fall on the walk back to the cabin. I hated the snow, especially on that island. It snowed about half a meter the first week I was on the island and we had to clear the snow off of the corpses for our daily inspections. I nearly vomited when my pinky slipped into one of the bullet craters in Corpse 16’s skull. I couldn’t dwell on the memory. All I thought about was how I was going to keep the mailman’s mouth shut and the contents of this letter. What was so important that it had to be brought out immediately? I considered ripping it open and taking a look, but doing so would ruin the rapport I’ve built with Vaughn. In the time I spent plotting ways to open the letter, I made it back to the cabin.

The fireplace burned in the living room. I slipped my coat off and threw it to the standing coat rack before sitting on one of the rocking chairs in front of the fire. As I bent over to take off my boots I noticed Vaughn's office door was ajar down the hall. I never stepped foot in the room until then and Vaughn made a point of keeping it shut. I never wanted to give Vaughn a reason to not trust me so I never questioned it. But I had his trust, and it was time to find answers. Hell, at the bare minimum, he might have some glue in there. If I found it, I steamed the letter open and glued it back with Vaughn never knowing the difference.

I tapped on the cracked door. The thought of him answering didn't occur to me until I had already tapped. I should have prepared a reason for me to knock but thankfully, it wasn't needed. The other side of the door remained silent. I nudged it open. A solid oak executive desk sat facing the door and lit by the window light. Its surface was clean except for a small reading lamp and the CB radio. The refrigerator hum filled the room as it preserved our rations for the coming weeks. Besides it was a gas can left without a purpose since there was no longer a boat to fill. To the right mounted above a shelf was a single-barrel shotgun. On the shelf itself sat a box of shotgun cartridges, half empty. I took a step in and turned to see a large corkboard hanging beside the door. A collection of about 100 faces stared back at me. Some were sketches, a few were clearly cut from family photos, but the majority were clipped from the obituaries.

The obituaries appeared to be sorted by time of death. I assumed the same order applied to the pictures not clipped from the obituaries, including the most recent photo of a boy. He couldn't have been older than seven. He gave a bright grin with a hole where his incisor would be. The oldest picture in the lineup was the Moreau family. If you had heard of Moreau Bay, its namesake the Moreau family is likely why. They were the first family to settle in the area back in the late 1600s when a heavy snow sealed them away from their trade route. Without a high crop yield, death was a certainty. A coin flip between freezing and starvation. When the snow melted, all that remained of the family of eight was the eldest son, and his family's bones covered in his teeth marks. Though distant family members wrote they had seen the other seven members since the incident, the eldest son was the only confirmed survivor.

I took a step back again to gaze over the mass of paper faces when I noticed a single word above them all written in bold red ‘BEWARE’. I chuckled. 

"The nut job must be a ghost hunter or something," I muttered to myself.

I went back behind the desk and yanked at the drawer but it didn’t budge. Locked. As I looked around the room I caught a blur through the window. A figure walked into the northern forest, forbidden territory for me. I couldn’t tell who it was, but I knew it was human. I pulled the flower from my pocket and rubbed my thumb over the pistil. I knew if Vaughn had secrets about Jemma, he wouldn’t keep them under the same roof as someone he just met. He would keep them in the north woods, where I wasn’t allowed to go. So with every ounce of my being wanting to stay in the cabin, it was in her best interest if I went. So, I grabbed my coat and hurried after the figure before the heavy snow set in.

***

The cold pierced straight through my coat. Each step I took down the northern path crunched my prints into the light dusting of snow. I told myself the figure would be around the next corner but the winding path kept it hidden. I hurried my pace, but whoever I saw stayed out of sight. Their footprints kept me from questioning their existence but it seemed I would never catch up to them. All I found were the corpses. Dark clouds rolled in and suffocated the sunlight. The snow would soon come down like a blanket and cover the tracks. I needed to catch up as quickly as possible. If the path continued to twist, it would be a shortcut through the woods before I met it again. The tree canopy would catch some of the falling snow too. I stepped into the woods and headed north.

Branches of snow-capped spruce needles pricked my hands as I shoved them out of my way. The smell of evergreen trees was a far better alternative than the occasional puffs of rot along the path, but I only saw needles. A sharp snap made me jolt before noticing the crushed pine cone under my boot. I laughed it off and continued shoveling branches to my side. The snowflakes grew with each step. Their flurry filled the space between the trees. I looked all around me. Branches and snow, branches and snow. The fog from my panicked breath blurred my vision even further, adding to the suffocation. It's like the woods swallowed me whole with no hope of escaping. Branches and snow. Which way was north? Which way did I come from? I was in a deep sea of branches and snow. A sharp crack shot to my ears. I jumped and picked up my boot to look for the crushed pinecone. But it was only snow.

 Whatever made the sound, was perfectly hidden by the woods. My lungs sucked in air rapidly and set off a smoke signal. A beacon for whatever staked behind the branches. Was it Jacob? The deer? The hungry kid? Had I gone mad? I was not going to move until I knew, even if it meant being buried alive by the quiet snowfall. I stood until my toes went numb. The more time passed with silence, the more I rationalized. It could have been a branch that snapped under the weight of the snow. The thought put me at ease again. 

A crunch of snow beneath a heavy step snapped panic through my body. I sprinted through the branches as fast as I could as they smacked against my cold, numb face. They broke as their thin arms tried to hold me back. Stomps and snaps were just behind me. It ran so close I heard it breathe. An echo of my own but raspy and guttural. The sweet smell of rot hit me. The path was close. I didn't care how close it was or if I planted my foot through the corpse's liquified guts, I needed out of those woods. It stomped at my heels. I felt its breath on the back of my neck. When I felt I was a razor's edge from its grasp, the woods released me.

I fell into the open space facing the wound I opened into the treeline. I scrambled backward to ensure I was safely out of reach. Not a single branch moved. The woods were completely silent, like nothing happened. I took a moment to ease my panic before orienting myself. The scent of rot was still strong and the snow wasn't deep enough to bury the corpses entirely, but there wasn't a body in sight. I looked around and realized I wasn't on the path at all. It was a circular clearing with a small structure at the center. A shed with a red, rusted door. The aged hasp drilled into the door waved in the wind. The padlock, whose job it was to keep the door closed, was missing. I took a curious step toward the building. The pop of the door seal sent me into another panic. I rushed behind the foliage before the shrill squeal of door hinges revealed Vaughn. I strained my eyes to focus through the snow flurry. His body shielded the contents of the shed before sending it into darkness with the flick of a light switch. He shoved the door shut behind him. He pulled a padlock from his pocket and locked the door before turning and heading on the path to the cabin.

The deathly odor was overwhelming. My eyes watered in the pungent stench. I must have been standing right on top of the putrid husk. I vomited. My puddle of bile spatted in the snow at the edge of the forest. It landed in a perfect divot in the snow. I looked at the strange divot closer. It was the perfect shape of a body. Posed with its feet together and arms at its side like all the others. I saw where the shoulders would meet the neck and the round imprint of its head at the top.

“The dog lies.” A gurgly, deep voice lisped in a hushed tone directly into my ear and I flung myself from the woods. I turned to see the source of the words and my heart banged against my ribs. Hidden in the shadows of the tree branches and a flurry of snow was a man. The dim light showed the edge of his sunken cheek. He swayed ever so slightly in the dark before turning away to allow the light to shine on the pulpy remains of his face. Such a grisly, mutilated mess of flesh and skull could only be left by a shotgun blast.

***

The run back to the cabin was grueling. I stuck strictly to the path and sprinted until my lungs ached. Mercifully, I made it to the cabin. I stomped the snow off of my boots at the entry door and hurried to the window to make sure the corpse hadn’t followed me. 

“Fire’s warm.” I jumped at the voice, the image of the man’s crater of a face was seared into my head. It was Vaughn who creaked back and forth in his rocking chair. He gestured to the identical one beside him. Between the boat, the whispers and the talking body I didn’t know what to tell him, or if I should at all. I wanted to slink back to my room and not mention a word to him before I dug up more information but I couldn’t deny, the fire did look warm.

I took a seat in the rocking chair, removed my boots, and extended my feet as close to the flame as possible as I soaked in the smell of charred logs.

“I was making my rounds this evening and I usually know where everyone is… I couldn't find old Patrick though. He’s the last fellow on my walk.” Vaughn said plainly. Crater face.

I gave a performative 'hmm' I hoped was convincing but if he saw my eyes widen, I would be caught. My mind bounced around the possibilities if I told him what I saw. Would he forgive me for being on the northern side of the island? Would he think the cabin fever got me and send me home with no answers to Jemma's disappearance? Had I seen something he wanted to be kept secret? I stayed quiet. I pulled the flower from my pocket to calm the barbed wire that constricted my gut but kept it at my hip so he wouldn't notice.

“What you got there?” He asked.

“It's uhh…” I stalled for a lie to come in the silence. The flower still had specks of hopeful purple. They shined from the decay surrounding them. I wasn’t able to lie, not about her.

“It was my wife's… It was the last flower I hadn’t picked for her… God, she loved that garden. She could make a cactus grow on ice if she wanted… I always caught her on her knees out in the backyard digging in the dirt. When she was done she’d come in the house and have dirt packed under her nails because she didn’t wear gloves, said they made her clumsy.” This was the second time I smiled on the island. I took a glance at Vaughn and he had a smile hidden under his wiry beard.

“What do you miss about her… You know, when you're here.” Vaughn asked. I didn't answer though. I was focused on the flower I suffocated in a plastic sleeve. It was such a vibrant purple when I cut it. Now the dots of purple were fleeting.

Vaughn pulled his wallet from his back pocket and opened it to a picture. I squinted to see the picture in detail and I was sure it was familiar but I couldn’t make it out. 

"I lost my boy a while back… I uh- I remember one day he ran in the house and he couldn't have been more than six at the time… but he comes running in and he says 'Dad I'm so sorry. Dad, I don't know what happened.'"

He gave a half-hearted chuckle.

"Seems silly thinking about him so worked up now, but what he did was he'd sent a baseball straight through the garage window… he had this face though… like the world was about to end. Like he'd caused so much trouble, hell would open up and take him whole... It sounds stupid but that's what I miss."

He stared at the small picture in his wallet before continuing, I only made out a familiar toothless grin on the boy. That's when it clicked. It was the same boy that ended his wall of faces.

“If I could just see that face again. And really know it’s him, you know? Then, he would say ‘Dad,’ -”

He sniffed.

“He'd say ‘Dad, sorry… sorry I’ve been gone for so long…’ and I’d just say it's alright you know?… and it would be.”

He sniffed again and remained silent. I tucked the flower back into my pocket. I was frozen. I racked my mind for the perfect phrase. A meaningful string of words to ease his burden.

“I miss her hair.” I blurted out. The fire applauded my blunder. He chuckled. A chuckle that rolled into a full laugh as he slapped me on the knee. I started to laugh too. Vaughn sighed before he continued.

“Hey, I'm going to radio the post office. Must've missed the mailman today.” He said.

I felt the barbed wire tighten again. If he got through to the mailman he would out me for sure. As much as I wanted to see what was in the letter, I had to sacrifice it.

“Actually it already came. Should be in my coat there.” I said.

He felt around the pockets of my coat and pulled out the envelope with a thankful nod. On his way back to his office he placed his hand on my shoulder.

“She would’ve wanted you to make good with the life you have left.” He gave my shoulder a couple of assuring pats and drug my chance at information into his office. I thought back to what the crater face whispered. ‘The dog lies.’

Vaughn's door slammed open against the wall. He tore through the living room, bolted through the front door, and into the deepening snow. I stood to watch through the living room window as he cut through the snow and headed south towards the boat dock.

With Vaughn's office door wide open, I had to know the reason he was so terrified. The gun, radio, refrigerator, gas can and even his board of faces all seemed untouched. But the previously locked desk drawer was left open and stuffed with papers. I pulled the page on top out and read. 

PATRICK W.

DECEASED: CANCER

DATE: 2025-11-24

Beside the writing was a picture of an old man and below was a long string of coordinates. I grabbed another page from the drawer.



CAROL G.

DECEASED: SURGERY COMPLICATIONS

DATE: 2025-10-13

Again, below were coordinates, and beside was a picture. Only because of the familiar chin was I able to identify her. This was Corpse 14. If this was to be believed she didn't die at home with a dog. I rifled through the papers, paying close attention to the causes of death. HEART DISEASE, STROKE, LIVER FAILURE, OLD AGE, OLD AGE so on and so on. Only a couple of car crashes in the stack could have caused facial damage. The rest were unexplainable.

On the desk was the envelope I received from the mailman. The seal was crudely torn open and its insides removed. I looked around the desk to find the letter it held until I found it alone on the floor. I picked it up and turned it over to read the message. It was the same as the others. Coordinates,  a picture of a familiar face, and the message.



JACOB H.

DECEASED: OVERDOSE.

DATE: 2025-1-14

A full week prior to when he set foot on the island.



*Knock, knock, knock.*

The sound was faint from within Vaughn’s office. I shoved the letters back into the desk drawer before I slammed it shut and stopped to listen closer. I was alone. My breath and heart worked to make the only noise in the cabin.

*Knock… knock…knock.*

This time they were followed by a muffled voice. Without hesitation, I grabbed the shotgun from the wall and stuffed a handful of cartridges into my pocket before sneaking back into the living room. It was empty.

*Knock…knock…knock.*

“It’s cold out here… I’m so hungry.” The voice ached.

I snapped the gun open, slid a cartridge into the barrel, and clapped it shut again. I wedged the stock into the pit of my arm and listened. The voice had a rattle like a diamondback. It was him. Jacob Highsmith, the creep who pretended to be a writer the day before. A man who, according to the letter, was dead. Yet, he stood on the other side of the door.

*Knock…knock…knock.*

"It's cold out here… I'm so hungry." He pleaded again. It sounded the exact same way - like he replayed a recording. I raised the barrel to the solid wood door between us as quietly as possible. My heart pounded at my ribs as I waited for the wood door to splinter at the lock and swing open. I put my finger on the trigger. I assured myself I was ready to pull it if need be though I didn't believe it. I pleaded again and again in my mind to hear his feet go down the steps and back to the woods, but he rattled instead.

“I hear your breath…” My lungs halted. I felt my bones turn to ice at his words, and still he continued.

“It sounds angry… angry for a looong time…” He said before what I only imagined was a chuckle, but it sounded closer to a rasp.

"Because your flower girl is pushing daisies?" Again, it rasped. I gritted my teeth and strangled the barrel of my gun to keep quiet while he continued to rasp and hack at my misfortune from the other side of a door. I wanted to open it. I  didn't have to assure myself. I wanted to pull the trigger. A sharp crack came from the other side of the door followed by an immediate wail.

"Pushing daisies!" It repeated after another crack and wail. This time he sounded different, younger even. A flurry of pops and cracks broke up his laughter. POP, SNAP, POP. Through the small gap was a sliver of its shadow. With each crack or pop it jolted from one side to another, growing, shrinking, growing again. An odor wafted under the door. It didn't smell like death in the same way the corpses did. Instead, it smelled like life. Life that should have died a long time ago.

"Daisies! Daisies! Daisies!" It repeated over, and over, and over. Each time its voice groaned from youthful to old, masculine, to feminine, raspy to clear, and between each was an inhuman rumble that shook the door.

“Daisies! Daisies…” With one final snap, it was silent again. The shadow beneath the door was still and thin. In a single step to my left, the shadow was gone. I followed the sound of its steps through the wall with the barrel of my gun. I pointed across the coat rack while it stepped on the other side of the wall, sounding more like the clop of hooves.

Left… Right… Left… Right…

I passed over a table, and a bookshelf, and turned the corner until my sighs were aimed at a frail glass window. I waited. Every ounce of me quivered in anticipation as I waited for it, whatever it was, to turn the corner into the window. All I needed was a clear shot.

“Fuck. C’mon c’mon.” I whispered to myself to keep any semblance of composure. From the top of the window frame, descended an antler.

*CRASH*

A bony, tar-black fist bursted through the window sending splinters of glass across the room. I covered my eyes and bolted for the door. Without turning back, I plowed through the snow as fast as I was able, southward. Snow completely blanketed the corpses but I took no caution as I sprinted. If my foot caved through the rib cage of a dead man, so be it. As long as I put as much distance between me and whatever beast broke into the cabin. It felt like icicles formed in my lungs by the time the path ended, and I was spit out at the dock. At the tip of the dock stood Vaughn with his head down. He turned to me.

“What’s your name?” Vaughn asked. The question was so unimportant I wanted to explode, but I had to let my lungs thaw before answering.

“You know what my name is. Now what the hell was-”

“I need you to tell me!” He demanded.

“Harrison alright? Jesus Christ, can we talk about-”

“In the cabin, what did you say your wife did?” He asked to cut me off once more. My patience shriveled.

“Gardening.” I snarled. Vaughn paused for a moment before he nodded in approval of my answers.

“And what do you do?” Vaughn asked. I write. At least that’s what I was supposed to say, but I couldn’t tell the lie.

“Can we be done with the dumb fucking questions? Because what the fuck was that thing at the cabin?” I demanded. 

Vaughn thought before admitting he didn't know. He said he watched it for a while. He told me the beast was as old as the town, the Moreau incident. It ate not for nourishment, but for skin. He said though it had the strength to uproot a tree, it often didn't risk damaging its target. If it had to wear the victims' scars too, it would be a less convincing deception to their loved ones. 

Ice stretched only a handful of meters from the dock before turning to a moat of cold, stinging water. Snowflakes rushed from the sky like bricks to build the walls higher. The island became a dungeon without bars and within it were two prisoners and a predator. Still, one question ate at me.

“Do you know that happened to her?”

Vaughn struggled to let a word through his mouth.

“I- I don’t.” he sighed before brushing the corner of his eye with his thumb. I saw his lips turn blue. His shoulders shivered beneath his suspenders. Suspenders that ran down over his pot belly, shielded from the cold by a thin long john shirt. His grey pants were wet almost up to his knees. Seeing him reminded me how cold it was, and in our rush out of the cabin we were unprepared and likely to freeze solid soon. I hoped all that was left in the cabin was the fire, our only chance at survival if we hurried. I opened my mouth to suggest we hurry back, but another voice filled the air. A small, shaky voice from behind the treeline.

"Daddy, I'm so hungry." Out stepped a boy. The same boy at the end of Vaughn's wall of faces. The same boy whose picture he kept in his wallet with the same voice I heard the first time I saw the antlers. I saw tears swell in Vaughn's eyes before he pinched them away with a squint and shaking his head rapidly. He whispered to himself while keeping his eyes closed.

“It’s not him… It’s not him.”

"We have to kill it," I said before raising my sights on the boy. I don't know if I could have pulled the trigger with a child on the other end of the gun, but I didn't get the chance.

"No!" Vaughn shouted before throwing himself between the kid and me.

“Not while it’s him… Please.” He begged with eyes as wide as lakes. It was a clear shot I needed, but I nodded and eased the gun barrel to the snow.

“You’ll be hungry too.” The boy said as he stared deep into my being. His expression was empty. As if he stated a well-known fact. He turned and vanished back into the trees.

Vaughn and I hurried back. We drug our feet through the ever-rising snow. Our bodies stiff from the element didn't allow us to hurry. We anticipated the beast ambushing us through the trees at any second, but it didn't. When we made it to the cabin I entered with my gun drawn. The fire still warmed the room beneath the mantle. Its heat fought a battle against the cold rushing in from the shattered window. The living room was left unchanged except for the coating of glass shards scattered on the floor. I continued my sweep of the cabin into Vaughn's office. Scattered on his office floor, were the remnants of a pulverized radio and a mess of empty ration cans trailing from the open refrigerator.
