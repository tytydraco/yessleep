Hey again, everyone - here’s the *Part 2* of my story.

So, he finally joined that tier 3 MBA college , the one he wasn’t excited about but had to settle for because there were no better options. It’s been a little over a week now. In the beginning, things felt okay. We were still talking daily, calling when we could, texting when we couldn’t. He was feeling a bit lonely in a new place, and I made sure to be there for him.

At the same time, I’m in the middle of my gap year, with just 4 months left for CAT — something I’ve been dreaming about and working really hard for. Before he moved to college, when he was still waitlisted at a tier 2 institute, he used to be *so* encouraging. He pushed me to aim for a tier 1 B-school, kept cheering me on, reminding me of my potential. That support meant the world to me. He even said he'd be there through my entire prep journey and once the exams were done, we’d meet and plan things out.

I know, I know ,sounds like a delulu fairy tale, right? 😅 But in those moments, it felt real. Genuine. This was someone I met online through XYZ, and somehow, he became a big part of my journey.

But fast-forward to now and things are shifting - in a not-so-great way.

Those sweet good morning texts? Slowly disappearing. Our calls? Less frequent. And when I *do* carve out time for him at night which isn’t easy with my packed schedule he’s either already asleep or doesn’t reply. And this is the same guy who used to be up late all the time. Now suddenly, he’s Mr. Sleepyhead?

Even when we talk, it feels like he’s barely present. He’s shopping, on another call, or distracted with something random. And if I ask where he is, he instantly starts sending me screenshots like he’s reporting his location which I never asked for. We’re not even officially dating, just two people who liked each other and connected deeply. But it’s like the emotional connection is slowly disappearing, and I feel like I’m talking to a wall. Literally. His responses? Just “hmm,” “hmm,” and silence.

I’ve tried to keep things light and sweet, thinking maybe the change is just temporary. But the more I try, the more distant he seems. Lately, even as friends, we’ve had small fights. He cuts the call when he’s mad or just goes quiet. Meanwhile, I’m still the one trying to communicate, to hold on to whatever little spark we had.

And now comes the part that really hurts.

He’s started *demotivating* me. Yup, the same guy who once pushed me toward my dreams is now saying things like, *“Even if you score well, they won’t pick you because your profile isn’t strong”* or *“Someone with work experience will get in, not you.”*

Like... bruh, are you on the admissions panel? Did you get a sneak peek into the future? 🙃

Hearing that once is bad enough, but he’s said it 2-3 times. It’s messing with my mind and shaking my confidence — especially when this exam is already such a huge deal for me.

We fought again today. And honestly? I’m drained. Emotionally, mentally, everything. I don’t know what to do anymore. Do I keep trying? Do I just let it go? I know I need to focus on myself and my goals but it’s hard to detach from someone who became a part of your journey, even if it was temporary.

Any advice would really mean a lot right now. I am currently lost :)
