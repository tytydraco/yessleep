I lay in my room for what feels like hours. Buried in the dark like a worm, but the blackness won't cover my shame. It practically glows. It's radioactive, slowly rotting my skin away. 

I can't believe I behaved so pathetically. Forget the zoo conspiracy. I know what I saw was real, I know the zookeepers are in on it, but who cares? I had a chance at an actually meaningful relationship and I squandered it. I chose fake animals over real human connection. 

God, why can't I be normal? Please fix me. Please fix this situation. Please change my footage so that there's no conspiracy and it's just been my overactive imagination all along. Please let Andy not be in on any of it. Please help him to be my friend. Amen. 

I open my phone. I don't actually expect my footage to be miraculously altered, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed at its intactness. Those vacuous mockeries will haunt me no matter what I do. 

As I near the end of my final video, I realize I kept recording throughout the whole debacle with Andy. I've been torturing myself all night playing it over and over in my head, but the chance to analyze his true reaction to me is irresistible. 

Did I really embarrass myself that badly? He looks hesitant, but not as disgusted as I remember. More concerned than anything, honestly. Could I possibly still have a chance to go back? To try again? 

He approaches, his lips pursed, his eyes unwavering, his full attention just on me. I feel that blissful wave of longing again as I hear my name come from his mouth. 

But his mouth doesn't move. None of their mouths have moved. None of them have blinked. Their faces don't fit. There's people inside of them. 

My whole body is shaking; my breath a barely-contained sob. I'm going to be sick. How could I not have noticed? They were right in front of me. This entire time. It's all been a lie. All of it. 

But my spiral is cut short by a hand grasping my shoulder. The grip is firm but gentle; providing stability and reassurance not fear or pain. The grip of a father. 

What's Dad doing here? I thought I locked my door; how did he get in? 

“What's wrong, Andy?” 

That name sounds disgusting addressed to me. It doesn't belong. Only to him. 

I turn around. Dad silently stands in the doorway, awaiting my response. A singular lightbulb down the hall illuminates his silhouette. 

“I heard you crying, did you hurt yourself?” 

In the dim light, I can't really see his face clearly, but I know for a fact that man's voice isn't Dad's. As my eyes adjust, all is revealed. There are eyelids beneath Dad's eyelids. Lips beneath his lips. Dad's face expresses worry, but the man beneath sports a smirk.

Rage and loathing engulf me. The gall they have to send one after me, to invade my home and pose as my only family. How arrogant are they to think I wouldn't notice? How stupid do they think I am? How weak? I'm not. I'll show them I'm not. 

Without another thought, I shove my thumb into the man's twinkling eye, slamming him into the wall behind. With both hands, I forcefully return his head to the wall a second time, then a third. Over and over. Again and again. Wet thump after sickening wet thump. Until a rough, gritty resistance scrapes against my thumbnail, returning my sapience. 

The brick wall. I must have pierced through his scalp. 

I gently lower the body to the floor. His head, like a loose bag of water, flattens as it settles on the wood. Red sloshes out of his ear, flowing down the hallway. I slump against the wall, utterly exhausted, sliding down next to the mangled mess. 

I know it's just a mask, but I can't bring myself to remove it. Even with a pulverized skull, his face is peaceful; forgiving even. He just looks way too much like him. But I know it wasn't. It's simply impossible. He sounded all wrong. I've never heard Dad scream like that. 

I shakily stand and inspect my throbbing thumb. The nail is cracked straight to the cuticle and my hands and shirt are completely soaked. I really didn't mean to react so violently; I seriously lost myself for a moment. 

Past my thumb, the body comes back into focus. The imposter’s one intact eye blankly stares back at me. I remove my dripping shirt and cover its face. I'll explain everything to the real Dad when he gets home. 

First, I need to clean myself up. The shower I take is so long that the scalding water eventually replaces with ice. I don't care, I just numbly scrub. I only stop when I hear footsteps in the hallway. 

“Dad?” 

I call out to him. I try to explain what happened, why there's so much blood, why there's a mutilated corpse wearing his face, why I haven't been myself for such a long long time, but I can't get the words right; too many sobs in between. 

I hear no response. I open the bathroom door to find an empty house. My only audience is the dead thing. 

I could've sworn I heard him in the laundry room; it's right across from the shower. The light isn't on, but I investigate anyway just to be sure. Nothing. 

While I'm here, I might as well get some dry clothes; I'm pretty sure there's still a fresh load in the dryer. 

There isn't. There's something else. 

A jumble of cloth and rubber, all neatly sewn together. The rubber is oddly soft and oily, almost skin-like. As I unfurl it further, I catch sight of hair, and then an ear, and then two parted lips. 

It's another flesh-suit. 

And this one looks just like me.
