Scrubbing blood from any surface is harder than you expect. It gets under your nails before you realize it, and the smell hangs in the air, poisoning the room. I remember going through the motions in shock the morning after all of this happened, methodically scraping away at the floor and walls until everything was clean.

At the same time, it’s also easy, in an unsettling way. Generic bleach cleaner and dish soap works perfectly fine. I had to put the sheets into the garbage, though – there was no salvaging those. I ended up sitting alone in my spotless bedroom, surrounded by a heap of bloody rags while trying to make sense of what I had seen the night before.

Anyway, I’m getting ahead of myself.

I met my freshman year roommate for the first time the weekend before classes started. We’d found each other on Instagram. *I’m Emma and you’re Jemma, isn’t that cool?* We were both math majors and read the same books, so I figured I might as well take my chances compared to a random assignment. It made sense that choosing someone with common interests was statistically less likely to end in disaster.

Jemma was half a head taller than me, with elegant features and perfect blond hair that fell down her back in waves. She had a cold sense to her, with a resting face sullen enough that it looked like a permanent glare at first glance. But when she smiled, it softened her angles into something more approachable. Everything about her made me a little envious and a bit self-conscious, and I wished I could carry the same gravity with me when I walked into a room.

The first week of classes passed without incident, and I tried to force myself out of my shell, talking to as many people as possible and trying fruitlessly to remember all their names. Jemma and I didn’t spend as much time together as we had over the first weekend, but we still hung out and watched TV together at night. 

It was strange being away from home, but I fell into the routine, taking comfort in wrapping myself in blankets and drifting to sleep at the end of each day. Chatter from the hallway leaked through the thin walls late into the night, but I was tired enough that it didn’t matter. My bed was in the corner of the room, and the presence of a wall right next to me gave me an odd sense of security.

At least, until Saturday.

I thought I was getting into the swing of things. Jemma had been staying out later than I had the few nights before, and I trusted her to be quiet when she came into the room. I went ahead and crawled into bed, hearing her enter minutes later. I tossed and turned as she went to sleep, her breathing evening out and falling into a steady rhythm.

It was then that I heard it. A knock, coming from the other side of my wall, a few feet above my head. I jerked up, turning to see if Jemma had heard it. She was still fast asleep, the noise too soft to hear across the room. The sound came again, two clear taps. *Knock, knock.* It sent chills down my spine, and I curled into my pillow, wondering if I should check the peephole. Maybe it was someone I knew.

But the knock was on the wall, not the door. I was sure of it. And there was no more chatter in the hallway. 

Eventually, the exhaustion of the day caught up to me. I woke up with my blankets twisted around me, my shirt sticking to my skin with sweat. A sense of unease remained in my mind, and I couldn’t pinpoint what caused it. At that point, the knocking seemed like a faint dream, and I didn’t believe it was real until I heard it again the next night. 

Knock, knock. I lay perfectly still, Jemma’s *inhale-exhale* on loop anchoring me to reality. The night before, I had brushed it off as my brain imagining things, but the tapping continued, repeating over and over. *Knock, knock. Knock, knock.*

I was fed up. I threw the covers off me and peered through the peephole, not seeing anyone outside. The knocking was fainter when it wasn’t next to the wall, but I could still hear it. Maybe whoever it was was just out of my field of vision. As soon as the door creaked open, the sound stopped. I craned my head past the doorway, taking in the expanse of the hall. It was completely empty. 

I gave up and went back to bed. The sound started up again immediately, moving down the wall until it was right next to my head. I shoved all my pillows between me and the wall and clapped my hands over my ears, curling into a ball and staying there until sleep overtook me.

When it kept happening, I tried talking to Jemma about it.

“I keep hearing a knocking on the wall at night,” I brought up hesitantly one afternoon. She looked at me strangely. 

“That’s weird,” she said. “I didn’t notice anything like that.” I didn’t know what else to do, so I just nodded awkwardly and walked away. We got along fine, but we weren’t close enough that I could ask to swap beds for a night or something similar. 

I tried waking her up one night when it became too loud for me to sleep. When I walked over to her side of the room, tiptoeing to avoid tripping over my feet in the dark, I could still hear the sound, although fainter.

“Hey,” I whispered. “Wake up for a second, can you hear that?” She opened an eye blearily and glared at me, trying to concentrate. After a moment, she shook her head.

“I can’t hear anything. Stop bothering me.” She pulled the covers over her head and turned away. I cursed under my breath, convinced that the knocking had stopped on purpose as soon as I brought it up with her. 

I felt guilty about it the next morning, so I tried to make sure she wasn’t upset about it.

“Sorry about last night,” I said sheepishly. “I hope I didn’t mess up your sleep.”

“It’s fine,” she shrugged. “I didn’t hear anything, though.”

Time passed quickly, and before I knew it, half the semester was over. The knocking continued nightly, although at this point it had become routine to me. I tried to assuage my spiraling thoughts that something would jump out and attack me. 

*Even if there is a monster on the other side, Jemma’s intimidating enough that it’ll probably be scared off by her before it can attack us.* I laughed about it to myself, back then. I wish it would have stayed a joke.

I felt a sense of unease around me as the weather started getting colder. Jemma talked to me less and less, and stopped smiling completely. I didn’t know what I could have done wrong. Once, I asked her how her day was, and she ignored me, walking out of the room minutes later while muttering under her breath. We started avoiding each other, and I tensed up every time she entered the room, brusque and angry with her lips always pulled into a frown, hostility permeating the air even though she hadn’t done anything to make me afraid.

It was just really, really awkward. She seemed to pretend I didn’t exist, turning on the TV before I was awake and almost making me fall out of the bed with how loud it was. She’d blast music too, enough that it could be heard through the door and halfway down the hallway. Her frosty demeanor almost made me scared to be in the room, but there weren’t any friends I was close enough to that I could camp out with them every evening.

I tried to convince myself that I was overreacting. She was just a person, and all that her chilly attitude was doing was making my college experience a little uncomfortable. 

Through all of this, the knocking kept appearing without fail every night. Eventually, I was fed up enough to try investigating. 

*Someone is knocking on the wall, and then disappearing. Whenever I check the peephole, it’s empty, and there aren’t any footsteps, either.* I had the horrible thought that something could be in the wall, but chased it out of my head. The frame was only a few inches across. There was no way anything living could fit inside of it.

The same day, as I was getting ready for bed, Jemma opened the closet door right into my face. It hit me square in the nose and I cried out, stinging pain prickling around my eyes and forehead. She continued as if nothing had happened, and I was so frustrated I could have screamed.

Jemma didn’t come back to the room that night, and I felt lonelier than ever, sad and angry enough to act foolishly. I knocked back. 

When the tapping started, I reached up to the wall and rapped it gently, echoing the sound. The knocking stopped abruptly, and I was left in complete silence for a second before it accelerated, so fast it seemed like something was *excited*. 

*Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.* 

I woke up in the morning blinking hazy images from my memories, dreams of being pulled into a dark void, an endless array of limbs wrapping around me and dragging me further into the black. I was terrified that somehow, I had opened a door, and whatever was inside my walls knew that I was on the other side, soft and vulnerable. 

I didn’t see Jemma around much anymore. Usually, we would run into each other a couple times in the afternoons and evenings, but at this point it was a surprise to me if I saw her before I went to sleep. Whenever she came inside, she was brusque and perpetually furious, and her demeanor set my heart on edge. 

Finals were approaching quickly, and I tried to reach out to every acquaintance I had made over the course of a few weeks, hoping I could pull myself out of my funk and finish the semester strong. I had to remind myself every night that there was no reason to be afraid, and my thoughts cycled between various lines of reasoning.

Often, I would respond to whatever was on the other side of my wall like it was a friend, only to receive indecipherable knocks in return. Other times–

*If something’s living in there, I hope it goes for Jemma first.*

I still feel guilty about that one. 

Fast forward to last week, when it all came to a head. I woke up in the middle of the night covered in sweat, my hair sticking to the back of my shirt uncomfortably. 

Next to me, the knocking was louder than it had ever been before, which was strange, because it tended to be quiet if I ever woke up in the middle of the night. I looked over to my bedside table, fumbling for my glasses for a second before giving up and squinting at the clock. 3:03 am. I glanced up.

Jemma was standing over me, a knife poised over my chest. Her lips were pulled into either a smile or a grimace, but it was too blurry to tell. I screamed and rolled off the bed, and the blade caught the edge of my shirt, slicing into my shoulder. I couldn’t see the wound very clearly, but warmth trickled down my skin, adrenaline distracting me from the pain.

She lunged at me again, and I dodged, colliding with the side of the bed and stumbling. I ran for the door fruitlessly, hoping to swipe at the light switch, but she grabbed me by the back of my shirt, throwing me against the wall. 

I gasped out something along the lines of, “why are you doing this? What’s gotten into you?” She didn’t bother with a response, moving once again to drive the knife into my heart. I flailed and twisted a doorknob open, diving into my closet and holding the door closed with every ounce of strength I had. 

The doorframe rattled as she attempted to wrench it open, and I could only watch in fear as the hopeless tug of war slid in her favor. I let go, aiming for the door to fly open and knock her back, but she must have been anticipating it, digging the blade into my side as I ran into the room and *dragging* it backwards.

I clutched my hand to my waist, trying to staunch the bleeding as my side erupted in fire, the pain finally overpowering the endorphins. Jemma’s movements were erratic, and she swung the knife in wild arcs through the air. I saw an opportunity and drove my fist into her stomach. There was a clatter as the knife dropped to the floor, and I kicked it away, planning to make a beeline for the door and call for help while she was distracted.

It was no use. Jemma was taller and stronger than me, and I regretted staying curled up on my bed the entire semester instead of working out as her hands wrapped around my throat and started to squeeze. I slapped my hands uselessly against her chest and face, but it didn’t faze her, and spots appeared in my field of vision.

The rest is a twisted blur to me. Somehow, I could hear the knocking again. *That’s not right,* I thought as my life was slowly ripped from my lungs. *That’s too loud. Shouldn’t be possible.* 

An explosion of noise. A massive, overwhelming tearing. A whirlwind of limbs and eyes and teeth burst out of the wall, pulling Jemma off of me as if she were a piece of paper. 

I couldn’t quite comprehend what I was seeing. It was tall, taller than the room, bending in odd angles and wrapping too many arms around her thrashing form. Dots of light that could have been eyes and jagged seams with teeth poking out lined it from head to toe. It tore into her, a blur of gory red. 

Jemma fell limp. The creature retreated back into the wall and pulled her in with it, leaving me frozen to the floor in shock. I sat there for hours, unmoving, until exhaustion took over and I collapsed to the ground. 

I woke up a few hours later to see the wall intact, with no indication that some inexplicable being had made its home inside. Thankfully, I hadn’t bled out, and the jagged wounds on my waist and shoulders were mostly clotted shut. I cleaned up all of the blood and showered, going about my day on autopilot. 

The knocking was still there, the next couple nights, though it was softer. *Are you still there?* It seemed to be asking. I was too scared to respond at first, but I gave in on the last time I slept in that room, tapping twice. 

*Thank you.*

I hope it understood me.

My room change form went through for the following semester, much to my relief. The police did come by after finals, with Jemma’s absence from every exam being suspicious enough to declare her missing. I denied seeing her, and they didn’t inquire any further.

I still don’t know what the creature was, or where it came from. It might still be there. Maybe there are more, an array of inhuman beings taking up in-between spaces, listening for a friendly voice. Or, maybe it was entirely random, and I had just as much of a chance of being taken as she did.

Either way, I’m praying that my mind is playing tricks on me. It’s been two weeks since this semester started, and I swear I heard knocking again the other night. The thing is, my new room is a single.

Wish me luck.
