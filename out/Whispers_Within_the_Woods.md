Livin’ in the forest’s got its ups and downs. The worst part? Ain’t no landmarks to speak of. Every direction looks the same, just a never-endin’ sea of trees and brush. Feels like you’re stuck in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight, knowin’ there’s things out there lurkin’, but you can’t see ‘em. At least, on the water, you’d have waves to keep your ears busy. Out here, though, the silence is a livin’, breathin’ thing. It presses against your ears till they’re ringin’. Sometimes, you reckon you hear something way off in the distance, but it’s just the echo of your heartbeat playin’ tricks.

Come nightfall, the forest wakes up with noises you can’t quite explain. Twigs snappin’, leaves rustlin’ - sounds that seem to trail behind you, then stop dead when you turn to look. Worst part of livin’ out here is that gnawing feelin’ of being watched. Like eyes are drilling into your back, but when you spin around, it’s just more trees starin’ back at ya. 

It ain’t all bad, though, once you get the hang of things. You get to see nature in its purest, rawest form out here. The wilderness offers a kind of peace you don’t get in the city. No honkin’ horns, no jabberin’ folks - just birds singin’ and leaves rustling. Sometimes the quiet’s so thick it’ll drive you mad, but more often, it’s a kind of quiet that settles the mind.

Life’s simpler, too. No bills piling up, no emails pinging, no social calls to answer. Just the basics - food, water, shelter. No screens or buzzin’ notifications, just a clear mind and the satisfaction of surviving with nothin’ but our hands and wits. There’s a real power in that. 

Jeb and I have been holed up in the Ozarks for three years now. The Ozarks - a sprawl of forests, mountains, and valleys stretchin’ across Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. We hiked in through Missouri, and truth be told, we’ve got no clue where we are anymore. But as long as we’re far from society, we’re content. 

Back in our old lives, Jeb and I were military men. We were part of America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Our special-ops unit got ambushed by Taliban fighters, and in the chaos, Jeb and I got separated from the rest. They assumed we were dead and pulled out without us. 

We evaded capture for three weeks. Slept in caves and under bushes, nerves stretched thin as wire. The Taliban were relentless, huntin’ us like animals. We lost count of how many we had to put down just to stay breathin’. Finally, we managed to fix up a busted radio in some abandoned building and sent out a distress signal. They got us out, but somethin’ inside us stayed behind. An experience like that doesn’t just let you walk away unchanged. We tried to stay in the army, but after all those failed psych evals, they stamped us as “unfit for duty.” An honorable discharge was all we had to show for it. 

Jeb and I, though, we’d been through too much together to just go our separate ways. After that, society didn’t seem to fit us no more. 

One night, we were knockin’ back a few at some bar when a bunch of young dickheads decided to make Jeb’s wooden leg the butt of their jokes. He’d just started comin’ to terms with having a wooden leg, and there they were, poking at the wound that was still raw. They probably figured a couple of old, weathered guys like us wouldn’t put up much of a fight - easy pickings to show off in front of their girls. 

We threw a few insults back, but then the worse of ‘em kicked at Jeb’s leg, trying to trip him up. 

That’s when ‘civilian’ Jeb and Darryl checked out, and ‘Afghanistan’ Jeb and Darryl took over. 

What happened next… Well, I couldn’t tell you even if I wanted to. It’s all a blur, like someone else took the reins. We didn’t mean to go as far as we did. We knew they were just kids, trying to puff up their chests in front of their girls. 

It wasn’t until a few days later, flipping through a paper a few counties over, that we realized what we’d done. The headline screamed, “The Bar Murders: 2 Unidentified Men Kill Police Chief’s Son & Friends in Bar Fight Gone Wrong!” We’d killed two at the scene, another died in the hospital, and one more was hangin’ on by a thread. 

We knew our time in society was up after that. The same night, Jeb and I packed our bags and gunned it for the Ozarks. Jeb used to go on a yearly huntin’ trip out here, so the land was familiar to him. We drove as far as the road would take us, then sent the car to the bottom of the lake and disappeared into the wilderness on foot. 

We didn’t take much when we headed out. Just the essentials. A few draw-strings to make or mend bows and traps, an iron skillet for boiling water and cooking meat, some bottles for storing water, and a couple of containers for food. We’ve got a solar-powered flashlight and a solar-powered two-way pocket radio too - keeps us connected, just in case.

Out here, days blur together. We wake up whenever the hell we want, spear us some breakfast out of the lake nearby. Jeb’s a lazy bastard, always draggin’ his ass outta bed hours after me. I’m usually up before dawn, while he’s still hibernating like a goddamn grizzly. Hell, he even hits the sack earlier than me, but somehow, I’m always the first one up.

After breakfast, we go our own ways - scavenging for fruits, nuts, or anythin’ that’ll keep us fed. Nights, we might sit around the fire and shoot the breeze, but not too often. Jeb’s paranoid as hell. Can’t blame him, though. The forest is pitch black at night, so dark you can’t see your own hand in front of your face. The tree-line’s so thick that even during the day, the sun’s got a hell of a rough time clawin’ through the brush. But at night? Forget it. No moonlight gets in, and you’re blind to anythin’ two feet away.

We know we’re the only ones out here, but that don’t stop the nerves. The fire’s light is like a beacon, givin’ away your position to God knows what. And in a place like this, where you wouldn’t know someone was creepin’ up on you till they’re breathin’ down your neck, it’s unsettling. The regular sounds of the forest - rustling bushes, weird animal calls - they just make it worse. Sometimes, bunches of leaves fall from the trees even when there ain’t a lick of wind. But what really gets under your skin is the silence. When the forest just stops, no animals, no wind, no nothing. It’s like the whole forest is holdin’ its breath, watching, waitin’ to see what’ll happen.

We were nomads up until about six months ago. We found a spot too good to pass up. Decided to settle here until the resources run dry. There’s plenty of overhead tree cover, keepin’ the place insulated, but it opens up a few miles down to a crystal blue lake. 

We’ve each got our own little huts, made from long sticks and branches piled up against each other, with a single upright stake in the middle holdin’ it all together. We packed on leaves, moss, and dirt for insulation and protection. Our huts are far enough apart for privacy - close enough for convenience, but far enough that I don’t have to listen to Jeb’s fat ass snore at night. We dragged our feet through the dirt to make a trail connecting our two huts. It works for us. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One mornin’, Jeb pulled off the impossible - he woke up before me. I crawled outta my hut, stretchin’ out the stiffness that came from another night on a bed of pine needles. Felt like my body cracked in places I didn’t even know could crack. Walked up the trail a bit and spotted Jeb hunched over, pokin’ at the embers of our fire pit. The mornin’ light actually made its way through the thick canopy of trees, and the birds were singin’ their good-morning songs. 

“Mornin’ Darryl,” Jeb grunted, not botherin’ to look up as he kept pokin’ at the fire. 

“Well god damn. Hell must’ve frozen over - you’re up earlier than me?” I said.

“Yeah, yeah. Don’t get used to it fucker. Just figured I’d get a head start today.” replied Jeb.

“Miracle of the Ozarks,” I said, grinning. “What’s next? You gonna start doin’ all the chores around here too?”

Jeb snorted, jabbing at the embers a bit harder. “Just ‘cause you like wastin’ half the mornin’ jerkin’ off in the bushes don’t mean I’m lazy.”

I couldn’t help but chuckle, enjoying the rare chance to rip into Jeb. “Sure thing, Sleepin’ Beauty. Just make sure you don’t fall asleep on us before breakfast’s ready.”

Finally, the embers Jeb had been pokin’ caught fire. He stood up, puffing his chest a bit. “Keep talkin’, and you’ll be eatin’ a knuckle sandwich for breakfast.”

“That was corny as hell, Jeb. Really? Knuckle Sandwich?” I held up my hands in a mock surrender. “But alright, alright, I’ll shut my trap. Speakin’ of traps, I’ll go check the ones by the lake. You stay here and… guard the fire… or whatever it is you do when you’re not asleep.”

Jeb muttered somethin’ under his breath, trying to play it off like he was pissed, but I could see a smile twitchin’ at the corner of his mouth. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The last few weeks, things have been weird around these woods. We’ve been seein’ less and less animals. This past week? Haven’t seen a damn one. Maybe we hunted ‘em all out. That’s not the only thing, though. Even back at camp, things have been off. Stuff’s been going missin’, turning up in places neither Jeb nor I left them. Things moving on their own, like the woods are playin’ tricks on us. 

Lucky for us, the traps by the lake a few miles down still work their magic. Caught a few salmon and perch today. Gutted ‘em right there, separated meat from bone, and packed it all up in a container.

This lake’s somethin’ else. The only spot where the Ozarks’ thick canopy lets up. Treeline sits about 200 feet back from the water’s edge. As I finished baggin’ the fish, I got that familiar itch - like somethin’ was watchin’ me. Common enough out here, so I didn’t think too much on it. Still, I poked my head around, natural instincts and all. Swear I saw somethin’ out the corner of my eye, far end of the lake.

Looked like a bear makin’ a break for the treeline, boltin’ from the bushes surroundin’ the lake. Couldn’t say for sure it was a bear, just a dark shape movin’ fast. But what else out here moves like that? Makes sense that it’s a bear, though - might explain why the animals’ve gone scarce. 

On the way back to camp, I stumbled on some tracks. We ain’t had venison in weeks, thanks to the animal shortage, and these looked like deer prints. I veered off the path home and started trailin’ em. 

Couple miles in, the tracks just stopped. The treeline’s thick here, barely any sunlight gets through, makin’ everything kinda blend together. I draw my bow, takin’ real quiet steps, eyes peeled for more tracks.

Suddenly, the bushes about 50 feet away start rustlin’. I freeze, my heart thumpin’ but I don’t make a sound. Bow up, I start aimin’. Whatever’s in those bushes has to be big.

Then I see a head poke out.

A deer, just slippin’ outta the bushes, completely unaware of me. Good thing I stayed quiet. 

I reach into my pack, pull out a stone-tipped arrow, and rack it. Slowly draw back the string, aiming right for the deer’s head. My heart’s poundin’ so loud I’m worried it’ll spook the deer.

But it doesn’t.

This deer is a big deal. It’s been weeks since we’ve tasted real meat. Fish is fine, but land meat? That’s a different kind of satisfaction. Sweat drips from my forehead, the salty taste hitting my lips, making me salivate. I’m already imagining the first bite - succulent, tender, the juices spilling out, searing hot and smokey. The crunch of the charred outside giving way to the soft, pink inside. I lick my lips, drawing the string back until it can’t go any further. My breath steadies, ready to release. 

Then, a whisper. A soft, breathy murmur right behind me. I flinch, and the arrow veers off, thudding into a tree, five feet from the deer. The damn thing bolts like the devil’s on its tail. Which, in a way, it was.

The whisper, though. That’s what made me miss. Close enough to raise the hairs on my neck, sending a shiver down my spine. I spin around, knife out, ready for anything.

But there’s nothing. Just the quiet, so thick it presses down on me. No wind, no rustle, not even the usual creak of trees. I stand perfectly still, ears straining, every nerve on edge, but I can’t hear a single thing.

Then, again. The whisper. Right behind me, the sound waves brushing against the back of my neck. I whip around, but there’s still nothing. 

I reach for my radio, thinking to call Jeb, but before I can, the whisper comes again. “Hello?”

The green light on the radio flicks on at the same moment. But the voice… it doesn’t sound like it’s coming from the radio. There’s no static, no distortion. It’s too clear, too close. Like someone’s standing right there, whispering in my ear. 

The voice doesn’t sound like Jeb’s. But who the hell else could it be? These radios aren’t the kind you pick up stray signals on. They’re paired, exclusive. Just me and Jeb, no one else.

“Goddammit, Jeb,” I growl, trying to shake the unease. “You just cost us two weeks of deer meat. What’s so important?”

There’s a pause. Thirty seconds, maybe more. Then that same unnerving whisper again, soft and eager, “Hi!”

The hair on my neck practically stands up and crawls away. This isn’t Jeb. But there’s no one else out here. I know that. We’re alone. We’re supposed to be alone.

“Tell me what you need, Jeb,” I say, forcing my voice to stay calm.

Nothing. No reply. Just the heavy silence. Jeb must be out of range, since he’s not responding. But there’s a gnawing feeling in my gut, an instinct telling me that voice wasn’t his. 

The deer cries out somewhere close by, and I hear the bushes rustling again. My first instinct is to go after it, catch us some meat, but something holds me back. That whisper, that voice… it doesn’t sit right.

I decide to head back to camp, make sure Jeb’s alright. The whole walk back, I keep trying the radio, but all I get is silence. No response, no whisper. Just that dead, eerie quiet. 

What the hell could Jeb have called me for? And why didn’t he answer?

When I get back to camp, the fire’s still going strong, but Jeb’s nowhere in sight. Our metal pan is face down in the dirt, like it was dropped in a hurry. The ground around it is wet. The trail leading to his hut is marked with fresh footprints. The same path we use every day, but this set is newer. I follow them, my heart thudding in my chest.

As his hut comes into view, I see him lying inside, motionless on the floor. 

“Jeb? Jeb, what’s wrong?” I shout, breaking into a sprint. I drop to my knees beside him, shaking him hard.

“Jeb?” I yell again, panic clawing at my throat.

Jeb suddenly jerks upright, screaming.

“Holy mother of fuck, Darryl! You scared the shit outta me! What the hell you doin’, wakin’ me up like that?”

I take a second to catch my breath, heart still racing. “Goddammit, Jeb! Why’s the pan on the floor, and why the hell are you lyin’ down like that?”

Jeb grunts, rubbing his eyes. “What the hell you mean, ‘Why am I lyin down?’ Ever heard of sleepin’, Darryl? Gotta lay down to do it.”

“Okay, okay, fine. But what about the pan?”

Jeb waves a hand dismissively. “Well, hell, you know I ain’t often up this early. Got sleepy boilin’ water and dropped the pan. Didn’t bother pickin’ it up. Just said, ‘Fuck it,’ and went back to my hut to get some shut-eye.”

“Didn’t I tell you not to fall asleep before breakfast?” I said, calming down a bit. “I thought something happened, you lazy bastard. Why’d you radio me?”

Jeb’s brow furrows. “I didn’t.”

“Uh, you did. I was about to snag us a deer when you started whisperin’ ‘Hello,’ into the radio, scared the piss outta me, and made me miss my shot,” I say back.

Jeb lets out a short laugh. “Don’t go blamin’ the ghosts on the radio for your lousy aim, Darryl. You missed ‘cause you’re a shit shot, plain and simple.”

“Ha-ha, very funny. But no, seriously. I got a whisper from you sayin’ ‘Hello,’ then a ‘Hi’ a few minutes later. Don’t play dumb.”

Jeb gives me a look, something between concern and disbelief. He studies my face, and after a long pause, he asks, “A whisper from me? Did it sound like me?”

“No, it didn’t, but it couldn’t be anyone else. These are two-way radios.”

“I’m tellin’ ya, I didn’t radio shit. Fell asleep right after you left.”

“Of course you did. Where’s your radio, Jeb?”

“It’s over… well, it ain’t in its spot. I probably left it by the campfire.”

“It better fuckin’ be there, or we got a real problem,” I mutter, already heading back to the fire with Jeb trailing behind.

Sure enough, we find his radio on the ground. I pick it up, glaring at him. “You can’t lose this shit, man. It’s our only way to communicate. But that doesn’t explain the whispers.”

Jeb scans my face for a few seconds, then breaks into a grin. “I think the only logical explanation, Darryl, is that you’ve gone batshit crazy.”

Despite the tension, I manage a small smile. Jeb’s the kind of guy who never panics, never worries. Seeing that look of concern on his face earlier had me more rattled than I care to admit. Even back in Afghanistan, no matter how fucked our situation was, Jeb would only let that worry show for a split second before it was wiped clean with that same confident grin.

“Let’s head back to where I almost got that deer. Maybe we’ll pick up its trail and actually eat tonight.” I said.

As much as I craved the taste of venison, that wasn’t why I was so eager to return to where I almost snagged the deer. The real reason is to see if those damn whispers would start up on my radio again. The deer was an excuse - what I needed was proof that I wasn’t losing my damn mind.

“Alright, but do me a favor and grab my bow for me. I ain’t in the mood to walk all the way back to my hut.”

“Lazy bastard. If you went to get it, you’d probably fall back asleep.” I fetch his bow, ribbing him a bit more to lighten the mood, but my mind’s elsewhere.

One half of me is on edge about the whispers, while the second half is trying to gaslight the first half into believing that I may have imagined them. But the feeling that someone is out there is clinging on to me.

It must sound ridiculous - a seasoned killer who survived Afghanistan, scared of what? One unknown person in the woods? Someone we don’t even know actually exists? But something about this just feels different. The Taliban? Predictable. Yeah, that might sound cocky coming from someone who got ambushed more than once, but when you’re out there long enough, you begin sensing things. You can sense if there’s a mine on the road just out of instinct. And if you were in town and it went silent, you knew an ambush was coming.

But more importantly, in Afghanistan, you knew your enemy.

Right now, I don’t know squat. I just know that there might be some psycho stalking us through the woods. I don’t know who they are, what they look like, or what they want. Or if they even exist. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After walking a few miles back to the spot, we found the same deer tracks I’d stumbled upon earlier and began following them. The woods were dense, shadows tangled with undergrowth, and the air felt thick.

“This is where I was when I thought the radio went off and scared the deer away. That’s my arrow in the tree over there,” I said, pointing out the spot. Jeb didn’t respond, already in hunting mode. His focus was intense, even with that slight stumble in each step from his wooden leg.

The tracks led deeper into the brush, exactly where the deer had veered off. It was the same direction where I’d heard the deer’s cry earlier.

We pushed through the bushes and caught sight of the deer. Or what’s left of it. 

The deer lay headless on the ground. Dirt and congealed blood matted its fur, and the smell - decay mixed with the sharp tang of iron - hit us like a wall. Flies buzzed around the carcass, their buzzing filling the otherwise silent woods. 

The body was a mess, ripped apart in a way that made my stomach twist. Some wounds were shallow, like scratches, but others were deep, cutting straight to the bone, exposing the ruined insides. It was brutal. 

“What in the ever-loving fuck,” Jeb muttered, barely above a whisper. His voice sounded as dead as the deer. “Where the hell’s its head?”

This wasn’t an animal attack. No bear or wolf could do this. This was the work of a person - someone with a knife.

A cold realization settled over us. We weren’t alone out here. Someone else was in these woods, someone capable of this kind of violence.

Jeb and I exchanged a look - one we hadn’t shared since Afghanistan. It was a look of pure survival, the kind you only get when you realize you’re being hunted.

As we stood there, frozen like a deer in headlights, the forest around us had gone silent. Not just quiet, but utterly, unnervingly silent. The kind of silence that suffocates you, making every breath feel too loud. The usual hum of life - the rustle of leaves, the chatter of birds, the distant trickle of a stream - all of it was gone. It was like the world had paused. 

Every instinct screamed at us to get the fuck out of there, but the fear of being heard, of being found, held us in place. Even the slightest movement, the crunch of leaves underfoot, felt like it would betray us. 

I could feel eyes on us, though I couldn’t see anything through the dense brush. It was the kind of feeling that crawls up your spine, makes the hairs on your neck stand on end, and leaves you paralyzed. In that silence, every breath felt like a risk.

We were trapped in that stillness. Caught between the urge to flee and the fear that whoever - or whatever - was out there knew exactly where we were.

It wasn’t us that finally shattered the silence.

It was a whisper.

“Hello?”

Jeb spun around so fast his bow was aimed at me before I could react.

“Get that fuckin’ thing outta my face,” I snapped.

Jeb’s eyes darted around, confusion etched into his face as he slowly lowered the bow. “The fuck was that? Sounded like it came from right behind. Didn’t mean to point the bow at ya… just at whatever the fuck was whisperin’ in my ear.”

I held up the radio, its green light still glowing from the transmission. “See? I told ya, someone’s fuckin’ with us.”

The sound was too real, too close - nothing like a voice crackling through a radio. It was as if someone had leaned in, their breath cold on the back of your neck. Just like I’d spun around the first time I heard it, now Jeb had done the same. I’m just happy he didn’t accidentally shoot me.

Jeb stared at me as I raised the radio to my lips. 

“Who are you?” I ask.

A minute passed, and then the voice responded.

“I can see you.”

We heard the faint rustling of bushes in the distance.

The faint rustling began getting louder, as if something was moving through the underbrush, circling us. 

Then, from the radio in my hand, came a low, guttural laughter as the rustling got louder and louder.

“Shit,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the growing noise.  “Run!" I yelled

I turned and bolted through the trees. Jeb didn’t need to be told twice - he bolted right after me. The forest came alive with the sound of snapping twigs and rustling leaves, the laughter from the radio echoing in our ears, twisted and inhuman. The rustling seemed to follow us as we ran, growing louder and louder with each step. 

Every step felt like it was in slow motion, the distance to camp stretching out like a nightmare with no end. The forest, our sanctuary from society, now felt like a trap. The laughter eventually faded, but the terror clung to us, thick as the sweat that dripped from our brows. After what felt like an eternity, we stopped running, our chests heaving, hearts pounding in sync with the adrenaline surging through our veins. 

We walked the rest of the way without saying a word. Every glance at Jeb made the fear tighten in my chest. The last time I’d seen this look was in Afghanistan when we almost got caught. We were hidden in some bushes near a road, and a Taliban convoy passed by just a few feet away - fifty soldiers with AK-47s and mounted .50 calibers. We didn’t move a muscle until they were gone, the shared terror mirrored in our eyes back then was the same now. 

When we finally reached camp, something felt wrong. Nothing was out of place, but a gut feeling told me we weren’t alone.

“Jeb, let’s circle the camp first, make sure everything’s fine.” I whispered. 

Jeb nodded silently. 

We made a slow circuit around the camp. Our “home” was just two shelters with a trail between them, the campfire in the middle. We passed my side, crossed the middle, and ended up on Jeb’s side. Everything looked normal, but the unease clung to me like a second skin. 

“We should bring our bunks closer tonight,” Jeb suggested. I agreed and told him to grab what he needed and meet me at my shelter. My side had a better line of sight, making it the safer option.

I started back to my shelter when the radio crackled. 

“Darryl. It’s Jeb. Come back to my bunk.”

“What happened?” I called out, but got nothing in return.

Cautiously, I made my way back to his bunk, trying the radio again. “Jeb? I don’t see you at your hut. Where are you?” Nothing.

When I reached his hut, I peered inside, expecting to see him.

Instead, I found the head of the mutilated deer.

Grabbing the radio, I growled into it, “Jeb, what the fuck is going on?”

As I spoke, I heard my own voice echo behind me - from the radio I was transmitting to.

I spun around, but before I could even process what was happening, Jeb swung a log full force into the side of my head.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Struggling against the weight of my eyelids felt like wrestling with a pair of elevator doors that stubbornly refused to yield. Each attempt to pry them open was met with resistance. The light that pierced through after hours of darkness only intensified the effort. After a few relentless minutes, my eyes finally obeyed, fluttering open and slowly adjusting to the dim light of my surroundings.

It was night now, and the forest around me was swathed in an inky blackness. Propped against a tree, my gaze settled on the campfire’s flickering flames. Across the fire, Jeb sat with his knife in hand, his figure etched sharply by the firelight. A rush of confusion and fear surged as I tried to rise, only to find my movements hindered. My limbs resisted, bound tightly to the tree with what I realized was the draw-string from our bows.

My breath caught in my throat as I was about to call out to Jeb for help, but the memory of his betrayal - of the log crashing into my head - flooded back. I clamped my mouth shut, stifling the instinct to seek his aid. 

“I know you’re awake, Darryl,” Jeb said, his voice low and strained. His leg bounced up and down. 

My throat felt raw as I forced the words out. “What the hell is wrong with you, Jeb? Why’d you knock me out and tie me to this goddamn tree? You had me thinkin’ I was losin’ my mind with those whispers. Everything that’s been going on - it’s been you, hasn’t it?”

Jeb slapped his thighs and stood up abruptly. He looked agitated, unstable, pacing back and forth with a wild energy. He muttered under his breath, too low for me to catch, but the words started to spill out louder as he paced faster, hands clasped around his head.

“It didn’t need to be like this, Darryl. I don’t know what happened, I don’t know why it started now after all this time. It wasn’t supposed to be like this.” Jeb’s voice began to crack, repeating the same phrases, almost like he was talking to himself. 

My head pounded, the pain from my concussion unbearable, but I fought to stay awake, stay focused. “Jeb. We’ve known each other for years. We’ve survived everything together. We became outcasts together. It shouldn’t be you versus me right now, brother.”

“It’s never gonna get better, Darryl,” Jeb said, his voice thick with emotion. “I tried, brother, I tried so goddamn hard. But this has gotta end.”

“What’s gotta end? Tell me what’s going on, Jeb. Talk to me.”

Jeb stopped pacing and looked at me, his eyes filled with a sorrow and desperation that I hadn’t seen before. “Darryl, there’s a lot you don’t understand. Things you don’t remember…”

“Remember?” I shot back, disbelief mixing with anger. My efforts to stay calm failed. “You think I can’t see what’s happenin’, Jeb? You’re the one out here playin’ twisted games, tryin’ to drive me insane.”

“Everything that’s been happenin’ - the misplaced stuff, the whispers, the deer, the radio - it’s all connected. And it’s all been you.”

“Me?” I stared at him, my heart racing. “You’re the one actin’ crazy. You knocked me out, you son of a bitch. What the hell are you talkin’ about?”

"It's all been you, Darryl. While I was tryna sleep, I heard you whispering into the radio. When we went back to where the deer was killed, right in front of me, you raised the radio to your lips and whispered, 'I can see you," before laughing like a maniac and bolting through the forest. And I couldn't figure out how you managed to put the deer's head in my hut without me noticing. But then I realized - it was when I asked you to go grab my bow, wasn't it? The head was what was bulging out of your backpack?"

"Jeb, you really believe this? That I'm some kinda fuckin' lunatic?"

“It all started in Afghanistan, Darryl,” Jeb said, his voice dropping low. “After Afghanistan, something clicked off inside your head. Why do you think the army didn’t let you back in? You failed all your psych evals, Darryl. Something changed in you. I don’t blame you - an experience like that would change anyone.”

“Jeb, we both failed our psych evals - “

“No, Darryl.” Jeb’s voice was firm, a hint of frustration creeping in. “The mine that blew up our Humvee before the ambush? It took everything below my right knee. That’s why they didn’t let me back in - I’m disabled. I spent most of those three weeks drifting in and out of consciousness. I was just along for the ride, Darryl. You handled everything on your own, keepin’ me alive. But it changed you. Think of the bar, think of what you did to those people.”

Confusion and disbelief twisted inside me. “That was both of us, too, Jeb.”

Tears rolled down Jeb’s face, his voice trembling as he spoke. “No, Darryl. They were just stupid kids, young and reckless, messing with me. I didn’t care. But something snapped inside you. You pulled out your knife and slaughtered them, Darryl. I’ve been worried about your mind slipping ever since things started going missing and the whispers began. But when I saw the knife marks in that deer, I knew. You did the same thing to those kids in the bar.”

My mind reeled, struggling to make sense of it all. “I don’t remember any of this, Jeb. You said you didn’t either. Whatever I did, I did to defend you, just like in Afghanistan.”

Jeb shook his head. “No, Darryl. Defendin’ me would’ve been throwin’ a punch, not mutilating them. You smiled while you did it, Darryl. I pretended not to remember so that we never needed to talk about it again. To get past it.”

“Jeb-”

“I felt responsible for you, Darryl,” Jeb interrupted, his voice breaking. “You saved my life in Afghanistan, but now you’re a danger to everyone. You blank out, and when you do, you hurt people - just like in the bar. And that wasn’t the only time. You’ve killed others since we got out, Darryl. The bar was the worst of it. You would’ve ended up in prison or dead. And who knows how many innocent people you would’ve taken with you. I felt responsible for you, Darryl. I didn’t want you locked up or dead, but I also had to think about the people you could hurt. That’s why I brought you out here, to the wilderness. I gave up everything to get you away from society. Out here, I hoped you’d heal. But these last few weeks, it’s been terrifying. I hear you outside my hut at night. It was only a matter of time before you killed me too, Darryl.”

I sat there, absorbing Jeb’s words, the truth sinking in like a weight on my chest. My face contorted, not with anger, but with desperation, regret. Tears began welling up in my eyes, blurring my vision as I finally broke down.

“I didn’t know, Jeb… I didn’t realize I was doing all of this,” I choked out. “I don’t want to hurt anyone, I swear. I’ll do better. Just… please don’t leave me like this, brother.”

Jeb looked at me, his eyes red and swollen from crying. He seemed torn, caught between the deep bond we shared and the terror of what I was.

“I’ll get better, Jeb. I’ll fight this,” I continued, my voice a mix of pleading and determination. “We’ve been through so much together. Please, give me a chance. I don’t want to lose you too.”

He hesitated as he stared at me - the man who had saved his life. The man who was now begging for forgiveness, for another chance. Slowly, cautiously, Jeb stepped forward, pulling a knife from his belt. He got close to me, a few more tears streaming down his face, before he slammed his knife down. 

I closed my eyes and flinched, but didn't feel any pain. Instead, I felt the wire around me loosen. 

“Okay, Darryl,” Jeb whispered, his voice trembling. 

He stepped back cautiously as I got up, but tears began rolling down my cheek as well. “I didn’t know, brother. I didn’t -” my voice started to break as Jeb lunged in to give me a bear hug. 

“You have to promise me… promise you’ll work on this, that you won’t let it take over again.” Jeb said, sounding hopeful.

Despite my tears, I couldn’t help but smile. “Everything will be okay, Jeb. Everything will be okay.” 

Then, as if on cue, my crying stopped. My grip on Jeb tightened as I reached for the knife tucked into the back of his pants. Before he could react, I plunged the blade into his spine.

Jeb gasped, his body going rigid with shock and pain. I didn’t hesitate; I pulled the knife out and stabbed again, and again, thrust after thrust. Blood spilled over my hands, warm and sticky.

Jeb crumpled to the ground, his life draining away in the dirt. I stood over him, watching the light fade from his eyes. The man who tried to save me, to protect others from me, now lay dead at my feet. 

Tears began streaming down my face as I knelt beside Jeb’s lifeless body. “You… you crazy son of a bitch,” I whispered, my voice trembling with a mix of anger and sorrow. “Lies, all lies. How did you come up with a story like that?”

I leaned in close to his lifeless face, my voice lowering to a bitter murmur. “I just went along with what you were sayin’, Jeb. None of it was true. I thought you’d kill me if I didn’t play along with your damn fairy tale.”

My hands gripped his shoulders, shaking his limp body in a desperate, futile motion. “It didn’t need to be like this, goddammit! It didn’t have to end this way!”

The frustration and grief boiled over as I shook him again, but Jeb remained motionless, gone. I let go, the reality of what I’d done sinking in, the camp around us quiet as I knelt there, alone. 

I wiped the blade on Jeb’s shirt. I glanced around the camp one last time, then turned and began walking. 

I walked, and I kept walking. I don’t know how many days or weeks passed as I trudged through the wilderness, my mind numb to the passage of time. The pitch-black nights in the forest seemed less threatening now. 

The first few days were a blur as I kept walking. I barely noticed as the trees changed from pines to oaks, as the underbrush thickened, then thinned. My feet carried me forward, step after step. 

I passed by rivers, their cold waters rushing by without a care in the world. I saw mountains in the distance, their peaks lost in the clouds, unreachable and distant. Days blurred together, the sun rising and setting like clockwork, while I moved like a ghost through the landscape. 

I walked through valleys where the ground was soft with moss, where each step felt like sinking into a dream. I crossed rocky ridges that cut through the landscape like the spine of some ancient beast, the wind whipping at my face, cold and relentless. I followed narrow trails that wound through thick woods, the trees pressing close, their branches scratching at my arms like they were trying to pull me back, trying to stop me. 

But nothing could stop me. Not the exhaustion that gnawed at my bones, not the hunger that clawed at my stomach. I had a destination, even if I didn’t know what it was. 

Days turned into nights, and nights into days. Eventually, I found myself on a road, cracked and overgrown with weeds. The road led me past rusted-out cars, their windows shattered, their tires flat. I passed houses that had been long abandoned, their roofs caving in, their walls crumbling. 

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the ground, I saw it: the distant lights of a town. The faint glow of streetlights flickered in the distance, drawing me closer with every step. The lights grew brighter, more inviting, as I approached.

After a few more miles, I found myself in a quiet neighborhood. People were out walking their dogs, cars cruised by, and groups of children zipped around on their scooters and bikes. It had been years since I’d seen another soul aside from… from Jeb. The sight of them brought a sudden awareness of how I must look - dried blood smeared on my forearms, dirt caking my skin, hair matted together, and clothes torn to shreds. 

A sound behind me caught my attention. “Look at that fucking weirdo!” a young voice shouted. The group of kids had stopped their bikes and scooters to gawk at me, the crazy man stumbling through their neighborhood. The girls hid behind the boys, their eyes wide with fear, while each of the boys took turns making snide comments.

“Ain’t your parents taught ya not to talk to strangers?” I shot back, my voice rough and worn.

But reasoning with kids was pointless. All they did was jeer back, “Whoa, the caveman can talk!”

These kids probably figured an old, weathered guy like me wouldn’t put up much of a fight - easy pickings to show off in front of their girls. 

I couldn’t help but smile. A cold smile crept onto my lips as I started walking toward them.

“My dad’s brother is a cop! You better stay away from us, Mister!” shouted one of the kids.

“Everything will be okay, children. Everything will be okay.”
