I moved into my apartment about a year ago. It’s nothing fancy—just a small one-bedroom on the third floor of a pretty old building. The kind of place where you can hear everything: footsteps in the hall, pipes groaning in the walls, muffled voices through the vents.

The guy who lived next door to me was an older man named Mr. Solomon. He kept to himself, always wearing the same gray cardigan, always shuffling down the hall with his head down. I tried saying hi a few times, but he never really responded—just nodded and kept walking.

Then, the notes started appearing.

They were small, folded pieces of paper, slipped under my door. No envelope. No explanation. Just short, scribbled messages in shaky handwriting. The first one said:

“DO NOT LET IT KNOW YOU SEE IT.”

I remember laughing, thinking it was some weird old-man paranoia. Maybe dementia. I tossed it in the trash and didn’t think about it again.

Until I got another one.

“IT WATCHES YOU WHEN YOU SLEEP.”

Okay, creepy. But still, I figured it was just harmless nonsense. Maybe Mr. Solomon had been watching too many horror movies. I ignored that one too.

Then came the third note.

“CHECK YOUR CLOSET. DO IT NOW.”

That one got to me. I actually did get up and check, half-expecting to find something horrible. But there was nothing. Just my clothes, my shoes, and a pile of laundry I kept putting off.

I almost went next door to tell Mr. Solomon to stop, but I didn’t want to be rude. He was old, probably lonely. So I let it go.

Then, three nights ago, I woke up to the sound of scratching.

It was soft, rhythmic, coming from inside my closet.

At first, I thought maybe it was a mouse, but the longer I lay there, the more it sounded deliberate. Slow. Like something inside was waiting for me to notice.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I just stared at the closet door, heart hammering. After what felt like hours, the scratching finally stopped.

The next morning, I found another note under my door.

“IT KNOWS YOU HEARD IT.”

That was when I decided to talk to Mr. Solomon.

I knocked on his door, but there was no answer. I tried again. Nothing.

Later that evening, I asked the landlord if he was okay. The landlord just gave me a strange look and said:

“Mr. Solomon? He moved out two weeks ago.”

I felt my stomach drop. That was impossible. I had just gotten a note from him the night before.

I went back to my apartment, my mind racing. If Mr. Solomon was gone… then who had been slipping me those notes?

That night, I barely slept. I kept hearing things—soft shuffling sounds, the occasional creak of my closet door. I tried to tell myself it was my imagination.

Then, last night, I woke up to the worst sound yet.

Breathing.

Right next to my bed.

It was slow, shallow. Not mine. Not human.

I didn’t move. I didn’t even blink. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, listening to that ragged breathing.

Then, from the darkness, a whisper.

“You should have listened.”

I don’t remember what happened after that. Maybe I passed out. Maybe I ran. All I know is, when I woke up this morning, my closet door was wide open.

And there was one last note on my nightstand.

“It likes you now.”

I’m writing this from my car. I don’t think I’m going back inside.
