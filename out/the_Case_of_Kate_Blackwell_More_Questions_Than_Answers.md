Case #2798: The Appalachian Murders

Location: The Blackwell Residence, \[ADDRESS REDACTED FOR SAFETY REASONS\], Fayetteville, NC 28314

Purpose of visit: To retrieve more information from only witness and possible suspect, Kate Blackwell, to the murders of four youths in Cabin #2 located in the Appalachian Mountains

It took many failed phone calls and “unread” emails, but I had finally got my chance to have another discussion with Ms. Blackwell concerning the case surrounding her. It wasn’t until my twentieth time reaching out to her immediate family members and being left on red when Ms. Blackwell had called me herself. She explained that she saw the caller ID name on her father’s phone before he had hung up on me without answering. She then took his phone when he left it unattended, copied my number, and waited for her chance to call me. Told me it took her days. 

We agreed to meet at her home and that she’d handle her parents and Mrs. Mayfield before I arrived. Whatever she told them had worked as, upon my arrival to the Blackwell residence, Mr. Jacob Blackwell was there to answer the door. A rather intimidating man, but he looked run down, like he hadn’t been getting the most adequate amount of sleep. He let me in and lead me to the living room, photos of Mr. and Mrs. Blackwell and Ms. Blackwell placed on nearby counters and at the edge of the mantle over the fireplace. Mrs. Helen Blackwell was sitting in a chair, looking just as if not more intimidating as her husband. She took looked weathered, but the fury in her eyes upon seeing me still sent chills down my spine. 

I asked if it was alright for me to record any conversations we had before Ms. Blackwell was made aware of my arrival and would be joining us.

MRS. BLACKWELL: Why? So you can force us to tell you that we failed as parents and turned our little girl into a cold, blooded murderer? 

Mrs. Blackwell had spoken to me as if I was the one being accused of murder.

ME: What do you mean? 

MR. BLACKWELL: We’ve been getting reporters and letters from people blaming us for not seeing the signs sooner and putting our daughter in the nut house before she could kill anyone.

ME: I’m sorry. Really, I am. 

MRS. BLACKWELL: Then why the hell are you even here?

Mrs. Blackwell had cut me off, shooting her death glare deep into my soul.

ME: Mrs. Blackwell, it’s my job to look into cases like this and prove a person’s innocence before I decided they’re guilty. With some… Recent activity… I’m beginning to believe that your daughter may indeed be innocent.

MR. BLACKWELL: Recent activity?

ME: I’m afraid I cannot give you much detail. Not until I’m absolutely sure of some things. That’s why I need to speak to Kate and get more answers from her concerning the murders. Where is she?

MR. BLACKWELL: She’s taking a nap. She’ll be down soon. The doctor gave her some medication to help her sleep… It… It’s some strong stuff…

It was at this point Mrs. Blackwell began to cry. 

MRS. BLACKWELL: They don’t even blame her… Why is she being treated like this…?

ME: ‘They?’

MRS. BLACKWELL: The other parents… Sonja’s, Jasper’s, Paul’s, and Luke’s… They say they don’t believe Kate did this… That she wouldn’t do something like this… 

ME: When was the last time you spoke to them?

MRS. BLACKWELL: We haven’t… They… They’ve been texting us and calling us… We just don’t have the heart to return their messages… For God’s sake… Our baby will be waking up soon and will be coming down those stairs in a few minutes… While they’re burying theirs’… I can’t imagine what I would be going through… Who I’d be blaming… I just… Can’t…

It was at this moment that Ms. Blackwell had finally joined us downstairs. She at least looked like she had gotten enough sleep, but she still appeared as broken as the day in the interrogation room. I asked if we could speak in private, looking to Ms. Blackwell’s parents to either leave us or lead us to a separate room. Ms. Blackwell offered to lead me to her father’s study, but Mr. and Mrs. Blackwell asked to wait for Mrs. Mayfield to join us before I began my next interrogation. Ms. Blackwell, however, told them she didn’t need to wait for her lawyer and that she wanted to tell me the truth of everything she remembered without someone telling her to keep everything vague. She then lead me to a different room from the living room, shutting the door behind her as we entered. I took notice of the rifle hanging up over a desk with a pitch black, screen desktop before joining Ms. Blackwell in a sitting area, sitting in the chair across from her’s. I then took out my recorder and began our discussion.

\[RECORDING OF INTERROGATION\]

\[WHIRRING OF RECORDING\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: This is Det. Ryan Snow with the Charlotte Police Department. This is my third attempt at a full interrogation of Kate Blackwell, the sole survivor, witness, and possible suspect of the murders that took place in the Appalachian Mountains. She has agreed to have this meeting at her parents’ home in \[ADDRESS REDACTED\] Fayetteville, North Carolina. She is currently under house arrest during the duration of the investigation. 

Ms. Blackwell, do you recall the last time we spoke?

KATE: Yes… You told me the land lord… Mrs… Mrs. Larson…? Died… That she couldn’t have been there while we were there because she was… Dead…

DET. RYAN SNOW: That’s correct. Have you been able to figure out how you could explain you saw her there since that day?

KATE: I… I can’t explain… How I saw her there, but… I saw someone there… She was an old woman, long white hair, and she was wearing… I think… I think it was a night gown… But we arrived there early the first time I saw her and it was night time when I saw her last… But… I do have emails where I exchanged contact information and questions about the cabin… I printed them out, but… But Mrs. Mayfield took them… Said she needed to read them over for the case… I can print them out again for you…

DET. RYAN SNOW: Yes, please. I need any and all information and contact with whoever you spoke to concerning the cabin. Have you exchanged any contact with her since?

KATE: Not since I escaped the cabin… I tried to contact her about everything that was going on before that night she attacked Paul… But, I never got a response… The number she gave me didn’t work either… I haven’t tried getting in touch with her since coming back… 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Have you received any phone calls since returning? Any numbers you didn’t recognize?

KATE: I don’t answer numbers I don’t recognize… I don’t call back either unless they leave a voice mail explaining who they are or why they’re calling… Especially now since most phone calls, texts, or emails I get are from news stations wanting my story… 

DET. RYAN SNOW: No one asking you to go back to the mountains? No unknown or restricted numbers?

\[SILENCE\]

KATE: N-No…? Why…?

\[SILENCE\]

KATE: It… It called you…?

DET. RYAN SNOW: I can’t disclose-

KATE: H-How’d it… How’d it know to call you…? How does it know who you are?

DET. RYAN SNOW: Ms. Blackwell, please, don’t freak out. It could have been nothing, just some stupid kids playing a prank. I only want to be sure… ‘it’ hasn’t tried getting into contact with you.

KATE: I… I haven’t… And even if I did… I never answered it… Like I said I don’t answer numbers I don’t recognize… 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Okay, then it’s most likely nothing and it’s just people making light of all of this. Now, do you remember anything else about the night you found the Ouija board in the cabin after you all left to find service?

KATE: Very little… But… I’ll try giving as much as I can remember… Like I said it’s all… Very blurry… I think my mind is trying to erase everything… Because of how… Unreal it all was… When we got back to the cabin and found the Ouija board… Jasper got really angry and told it we weren’t going to play its game and threw the planchette across the room… Sonja was getting upset and told him that we had to at least try saying goodbye to it before we moved along from the Ouija board…

DET. RYAN SNOW: Why did Sonja want to say goodbye to it?

KATE: It’s believed that once you welcome… Whatever you’re talking to through the Ouija board… You have to end the game by saying goodbye, so that it knows you’re done playing with it and that you want to close the doorway to the… Place… It came from… If you don’t, or if the thing keeps trying to communicate with you, then the doorway remains open… And you let whatever it is… Stay…

DET. RYAN SNOW: Did you all ever say goodbye?

\[SILENCE\]

Kate: No…

DET. RYAN SNOW: What happened after Jasper threw the planchette?

KATE: Sonja and Jasper started arguing about playing the Ouija board… Luke was telling Sonja that none of it was real and that we just needed to get out of there as soon as possible… Paul was… Paul was lying on the couch… His wounds were bleeding through the rags and I was trying to keep him from bleeding out while trying… Trying to calm everyone down… That’s when we heard the noises coming from the attic again… Voices telling us to play with the Ouija board… Then… Then Jasper… He got so angry… We… \[SNIFFING\] We tried to… To stop him…

DET. RYAN SNOW: What did Jasper do?

KATE \[SNIFFING\]: He… He said… He said he was going to put an end to it all… He took one of the pokers from the fireplace and went upstairs… Luke went with him, grabbing a butcher knife from the kitchen in case… In case they found… Found someone… Sonja and I stayed downstairs with Paul, trying to keep him awake… We could hear Jasper and Luke walking around upstairs… Then… Then… Oh, Jasper! \[SOBBING\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Ms. Blackwell, breathe. Breathe. What happened to Jasper?

KATE \[SOBBING\]: I don’t know! All I heard was him screaming! \[SOBBING\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: What about Luke?

KATE \[INHALES DEEPLY THEN EXHALES\]: He… He was screaming too… I could hear them… Struggling and… Jasper screaming… He was calling out to Luke for help… Then… Then it just stops… Luke was still screaming… And… And he ran back downstairs… His knife was gone and… And he was covered in blood… He said it was Jasper’s… That… That something… Something grabbed him in the attic and dragged him away… Luke said he went after him and… He ran back to us when… Something wet started splashing his face… It wasn’t until he left the attic that he saw it was blood… That’s when he stopped hearing Jasper scream…

DET. RYAN SNOW: Did Luke see what took Jasper?

KATE: He said it was too dark… Said he couldn’t see what it was doing to Jasper… It wasn’t until the police found him that… That I even found out how he… He… \[SNIFFING\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Ms. Blackwell-

KATE: When Luke told us what had happened… We… We agreed to play the Ouija board… We just wanted to say goodbye… But… But nothing happened… We said goodbye so many times… But… But, the planchette just sat there… The only time it moved was when we began shaking and couldn’t… Couldn’t keep our hands still… Sonja begged it to let us go… But… Then we heard it… We heard the voices again… It said… It said ‘no…’ that it wasn’t going to let us go… Then… Then… We heard it running from up in the attic… It was coming right toward us… I didn’t even… I didn’t even see it… But… Luke… Whatever happened… It… It hit Luke with the poker Jasper had… It was just a large black blur and all we could think to do was run… Sonja and I grabbed Paul and ran… We just kept running… I don’t know when we lost Paul… I just noticed he wasn’t behind us… We… We let him go… We dropped him… Oh, Jesus Christ, we left him behind on that trail! We stopped running… We tried calling out for Paul, but when he didn’t answer… I told Sonja we had to leave before… Before it found us… It was my idea to leave the boys behind… I left them behind… \[SNIFFING\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Ms. Blackwell… This probably doesn’t change anything, but it may give you some peace on Paul. When the police found him, they found he most likely died from blood loss from the supposed stab wound left by Mrs. Larson… Whatever killed Luke and Jasper never got the chance to kill him.

KATE \[SNIFFING\]: Th… Thank you, Detective… That… That does… Help… That Paul wasn’t killed by that… That thing… But… I still… I left him behind… He watched Sonja and I… Leave him behind… I left my friend to die… \[SNIFFING\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Ms. Blackwell, they found Sonja. It was believed she fell from a hight that broke her spine. What happened?

\[CREAKING IS HEARD IN ROOM\]

KATE \[SNIFFING\]: I don’t know how long we’d been running… It was almost completely dark and we couldn’t see anything… We almost fell off a cliff, because we could barely see where we were going… But… We… We heard it… It had found us… Somehow it found us… Then… Then Sonja… She… We were backing away from the sound of it getting closer and she… She… \[SNIFFING\]… I climbed down after her… She was still alive… But… She couldn’t move… Or speak… I just… Sat there with her… I just sat there, holding her… Until she…

\[SILENCE\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: What happened to the… Thing that was following you?

KATE: I… I heard it looking around for us… I kept as quiet as I could in a dark place under the cliff… I could hear it looking around the area near us… But… I guess it couldn’t see us… or hear us… Because I heard it wander off, mumbling something I couldn’t make out… I waited… Hours to be sure it was gone… It wasn’t until the sun came back up… That I buried Sonja with the note… And… I just started walking… I didn’t know where I was going or which way I needed to go… I just started walking…

DET. RYAN SNOW: That’s when you were picked up by those teens?

KATE: Yeah… I didn’t even realize I was on a road until they pulled up and stopped to take me to the hospital… 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Do you remember what this thing’s voice sounded like? 

KATE: It sounded unreal… Like it was using multiple voice changers at the same time… I was so freaked out about everything that, I didn’t bother trying to figure out where it was coming from, what its actual voice sounded like… I just know it was big…

\[DOORBELL RINGS\]

KATE: That might be Mrs. Mayfield.

DET. RYAN SNOW: Then that’s my cue to leave. Thank you for agreeing to another interrogating Ms. Blackwell.

\[SHUFFLING AS DET. SNOW GOES TO GRAB RECORDER\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: If you have any more information for me, you have my number.

KATE: Did you read th-

\[RECORDING ENDS\]

I had cut the recorder off before Ms. Blackwell could ask me her question. She had asked if I had read the guest book, to which I told her that I did. However, I told her that it didn’t hold and substantial evidence that could prove or disprove her innocence in the murders of her friends. Despite that, I did tell her that the entries did hold some similarities to her case and that I would need to do some more digging to finding answers. I didn’t tell her about Mr. Raines and how he had survived and was in prison for the murder of his fiancé. I also still needed to speak with Cloud Nine Vacation Rentals. If neither of those give me the leads I need, I may need to visit the crime scene myself and travel up to those cabins.

We met with Mrs. Mayfield once we left the room, the Blackwell attorney clearly displeased with her client, but more so with me. Her stating that if I wanted to speak to Ms. Blackwell again, I would need to contact Mrs. Mayfield first. Though, I can already guess that she won’t let me speak to Ms. Blackwell one-on-one again. Thankfully, I may have gotten all my answers from Ms. Blackwell for now. As far as she was letting on, she was just as lost as to what was going on in those mountains as I was. I still can’t deem her as innocent just yet, but her recollection of the night her friends’ died checks out in a bizarre kind of way.

My next move on gathering the leads I need, to pay a visit to Cloud Nine Vacation Rentals. They may even have something on the previous cases.

As for my mysterious caller; so long as he didn’t know where Ms. Blackwell was or knew how to contact her, I’ll just have to wait for another call to find out where to find the son of a bitch.
