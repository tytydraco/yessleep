“Slow down! Calm yourself and tell me *exactly* what happened.” The officer said.



“Okay… Okay…” I took a deep breath…



“So basically…

  
  


We’d been in the car for hours now, the sun already setting behind the rocky mountains, we were all barely keeping awake, except for Leo, since he was the one driving. 



We didn’t have a lot of time left all together, so we decided to all go on a camping trip together since Kaycee was going to move abroad to study at some fancy university and Jayce was going to LA. 



Leo, Jayce, Kaycee, Liza, and I have always been friends, you’d always catch the 5 of us hanging out together. 



Jayce and Kaycee were twins, I’ve known them since kindergarten, our parents were good friends. 



I wasn’t as close to Liza as the rest of the group, we didn’t really hang out just the 2 of us, mostly with the group, but she was still a good friend of mine. 



And there was also Leo. I’ve known him forever, he’s my best friend.



The place was in the mountains, great view up there, beautiful place. It’s almost dark when we get there, so we hurry to move our things into the tents and organize the place. We set up stools around the fire pit where we were going to roast marshmallows and sausages, while Leo went out to collect firewood. 



We laid out chairs, drinks, and food while we waited for him to come back. We had brought marshmallows, sausages, and a 6-pack of soda. 



Thunder struck. 



“Uh-oh. It’s raining… Good thing the area around the pit is covered.”



Leo soon came back with the wood for the fire and placed it in the fire pit. We were all ready to prepare our sausages in the fire with our skewers.



“Hey, you guys didn’t even bother to set a chair for me?” Leo intervened.



“No, we--  We did, we set up every chair!” I look at Kaycee, knowing we set up all of our chairs. 



All the chairs were filled, despite Leo being standing.



“Well, clearly not… Anyways, I’ll go set my tent…” Leo set off to the car to grab his tent and set it up.



Kaycee, Jayce, Liza, and I started on getting dinner ready: we decided to grill the sausages on the skillet instead of using the skewers, we also opened up our sodas.



“I’m bored, let’s play something, I brought cards.” Jayce spoke up, pulling a golden standard 52-card deck from his pocket.



“Okay, we can play--  Hey! Is that my deck?? Just because we’re twins doesn’t mean you can take my stuff!”  



“Oh, relax Kaycee, they’re just cards! Anyways, yeah, I’m down to play something while we wait.”  I set down my drink after speaking.



“Yeah, me too.”



“I agree, but what would we play?” 



“What about Go Fish?” Jayce looked at us, waiting for approval.



“Go Fish?? I mean… Sure, why not? 10 cards each?”



Jayce started dealing the cards to each player.



“Huh…  That’s strange… There’s no cards left besides the jokers…” Jayce looked around.



“You did something wrong, man.” Liza looked at him confused.



“Wait… Let me redo.” Jayce recollected all the cards and dealt them again. 



“Okay, what’s going on?” Jayce had no leftover cards again.



“You’ve never been good at math, huh Jayce?” Kaycee was mocking her twin as usual.



“How many hands are you dealing? Leo isn’t back yet…” I took another sip of my soda and set the now empty can next to the empty 6-pack.



“Why are there five hands of cards dealt?”



“Because we’re in five.”



“But Leo isn’t here…”



We all looked at eachother.



I stood up.



“Everyone stand up and hold hands.”



They all stood up from their chairs and held hands.



“Now, say the name of whoever is to your right.”



“Alex.”



“Jayce.”



“Kaycee.”



“Liza.”



“Alex.”



I looked at Liza.



“No, someone already said my name…”



Liza looked at me and we both looked at our hands.



“We’re definitely holding hands… What’s going on…? Let’s try again, but to the left now… I’ll go first. Liza.”



“Kaycee.”



“Jayce.”



“Alex.”



“Liza.”



A chill ran down my spine. Liza looked around and spoke up.



“Okay… Someone said my name twice… Who was the last to speak?”



“Jayce.” I looked at him.

“Alex.” Jayce spoke up at the same time.



“No, it was you, I was the first to say a name.” I rebutted.



Liza pulled her phone out and placed it next to the firepit.



“Let’s take a picture, that way we can see everyone.”



We all stood back. The camera snapped. Liza looked at the picture, showing it to us.



“There’s me, Kaycee, Jayce, and Alex. That's everyone.”



“It’s not a selfie. Who took the photo?” Jayce spoke out, shaking his head.



“Leo.”



“But Leo isn’t here.” I pointed out.



Kaycee pointed at the fire.



“The sausages are ready. We must be hungry, that’s why we’re confused…”



Kaycee’s attempt to comfort us wasn’t working. Something was wrong.



“It stopped raining, I’ll go get Leo…” I walked away from the fire, heading towards the tents.



“Leeeeo…. Where are you??”



“Over here!” He was crouching down next to his tent.



“What’s taking you so long?” 



“Look.” He pointed at the ground.



“What? Footprints?”



“Count them. How many are there?”



“Five pairs. What’s wrong?”



Leo looked around.



“Five pairs coming from the car. You guys went to the car to get the skillet, right?”



“Right. And?”



“I haven’t been to the firepit again since I left. There should be 5 pairs coming, 5 going to the fire, then it rained and erased the prints. Then 5 more coming since I came to the tents, and only 4 going back to the fire. But there’s 5 going to the fire.”



I scratched my head. Math wasn’t my strong suit.



“Erm… If you say so… Anyways… Dinner’s ready, come eat!” I took his hand and led him back to the firepit.



When we got there, we all sat down around the fire and ate dinner while playing cards. Once we all finished, we were all pretty tired.



“We should go to sleep now so that we can wake up early tomorrow.” I said, as I threw my paper plate in the fire.



“You’re right, me and Jayce wanted to go fishing tomorrow in the lake nearby.” Leo said, doing the same with his plate. Everyone followed suit too.



“I’ll be right back, I gotta go to the bathroom.” Liza said, standing up and walking away towards some trees.



“Weird stuff has been happening, we should sleep in pairs, that way no one has to sleep alone.” Jayce spoke up.



“Good idea.”



We headed to the tents. 



“Me and Jayce can sleep together since we’re getting up early tomorrow to fish.” Leo said, while looking at the rods.



“Wait-!” I blurted out.



Everyone looked at me. I blushed a bit, embarrassed. 



“I was thinking maybe… We… Could partner up, Leo?” 



They all exchanged smug looks. 



Jayce pushed Leo my way.



We all got into our tents, Kaycee and Jayce in one, Leo and I in the other.



“Hey ah…Leo?”



“Hm?”



“You know how we’ve been friends for a while…?” I was sweating bullets.



“Mhm.”



“Well ah…” 



“Alex. I like you.”



That was unexpected.



People being people, things happen. Usually until late at night, and after things are done happening they usually go to sleep until the next morning…

  


When I woke up, Leo wasn’t there anymore, he was probably out fishing with Jayce. When I left my tent, Kaycee was already outside.



“Morning, sleeping beauty!”



“Hey Kaycee. What time is it?” 



“10:30-ish.”



“Jayce and Leo out fishing?”



“Yep. Hey, there’s eggs for breakfast at the firepit for you by the way. They might be a bit cold by now though…” 



“Oh, thanks.” I said, moving towards the firepit to eat my eggs.



I was eating my eggs, thinking about how lucky I was. My best friend actually likes me back. And I actually got to spend the night with him…! Sleeping in the same tent… All our friends united here before they have to leave… Move far away…



Kaycee joined me at the firepit.



“So, how did you guys sleep?”



“Ah, you know… In pairs… Like everyone else… Ahah.” I laughed awkwardly, she definitely knew what happened.



“In pairs…”



We looked at eachother.



“Pairs…?”

“Pairs??”



I quickly stood up.



“Okay, what is going on?! Why do we keep counting six of us here?!”



“Wait-- Where’s Liza? Who did she sleep with?”



 “She slept with… With… Agh.. I can’t remember…”



“We left her alone Kaycee!!”



We ran back to the tents, blood rushing through our bodies. We opened Liza’s tent and Kaycee immediately wretched and spilled the contents of her stomach all over the ground. The smell of vomit mixed with the smell of iron in the air. What we saw in that tent… Was absolutely inhumane. Liza’s mutilated corpse crammed in her own suitcase, her limbs bent and folded in on themselves in order to make them fit inside, her eyes bulging from her face, staring in a horrified expression, how much she must’ve suffered in her final moments… We’re horrible friends… 

We let her sleep without a pair… But not alone. The person in Leo’s chair, the extra hand in Go Fish, the fifth pair of footsteps… Liza’s pair. 



“O-Oh… Oh god… Call the police!! We have to LEAVE. NOW!”



We ran towards the lake where the boys were fishing. We were too late. Kaycee stumbled on her own twin brother’s corpse, twisted into the bait cooler. Leo… My best friend… Missing his eyes, his nose, his ears… His scalp hanging from the fishing rod… We burst into tears.



“RUN TO THE CAR!”



We ran. We ran until we couldn’t. And even then we kept running. A wet crunching noise behind us, a twisted kind of origami, Kaycee’s screams echoed throughout the woods.



“A-- ALEX--! HELP M-- AAAHH!! HEL-- HELP!”

  
  
  
  


There was nothing I could do. Kaycee was gone. All my friends are dead. I kept running. All the way to Leo’s car, where I drove out of the woods. And now I’m here, in a police station in the middle of god knows where, telling this story to a police officer who probably won’t even believe me.” 



“Riiiiight… If you would please point us to where the camp grounds are, we will send a team to investigate.” The officer paused to take a sip from his coffee mug then continued, looking at me, sitting across from his desk:

  


*“And only you two made it out?”*
