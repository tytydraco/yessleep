I was helping my mom move house the other day and I found a small leather journal in the attic. I asked her about it and she said it belonged to her grandfather who was an archaeologist. Apparently he had a few of these from different digs he'd been on though she had never read that one in particular. She said I could take it home and read it but warned me that they could be pretty dry. Seems like my great grandfather wasn't known for his creativity. 

I took it home that afternoon and forgot about it for a while. I was reminded of it by, strangely enough, a dream. I was sitting in a field on a rock outcropping reading the journal. I remember, in the dream, being overwhelmed by a sense of serenity, like I was floating, like the grass, swaying gently in the breeze wasn’t grass at all but a vast ocean.

Anyway, the next day I made sure to set some time aside for reading.

It started out normal and was mostly just logistical things, supplies and such. But then about half way through the entries took a turn. The only way I can describe them is unsettling. I've been trying to convince myself that he just randomly decided to take up creative writing. Gunna write up some of the weirder entries here, hoping that by sharing them it'll take the edge off a bit. Hopefully we can all laugh at how dumb I'm being.



August 24th 1932

The dig has been nothing short of a disaster. We've found nothing and the money is running out. I knew it was a gamble and it took more than enough convincing from the committee to secure the grant. The books that led me to this location were entirely suspect, a queer leather bound tome barely held together by ancient bindings. Strange glyphs covered the front and back in its entirety, scrawled things that had been scarred into the leather itself. The text, if it could be called such, inside was entirely incomprehensible, much of it similar to the scrawl on the cover. Luckily, or perhaps unluckily, there was a map on one of the pages. It took months to decipher possible locations. It was a risk, a massive one. I just had a feeling. An inexplicable feeling. It wasn't a particularly good feeling mind you, but it demanded an answer. It was my decades of work at the college that enabled this trip and it will be my head if it fails. 

It pains me to think that if this dig turns out a failure, my so far immaculate career will be tarnished, an ugly, writhing blemish on an otherwise perfect legacy. Is it conceited of me to think about such things? Perhaps but when one's field is history you can't help but think about how you will be remembered, what you'll leave behind. Will anyone know my name in 80 years? I like to hope so.

We have two weeks of dig time left and I've little hope.  


August 27th 1932

A fight broke out between Moore and Thompson today. The strangest thing. Moore is one of the most sensible men I know. Likes to keep to himself, never causes trouble. But at tonight's meal he just lunged at Thompson. Thankfully they were broken apart before anything could happen. Thompson says he did nothing that knowingly could've drawn the man's ire, didn't even know he had ire he said. I spoke with Moore a bit later, after giving him a moment to himself. He didn't say much. Just kept saying that he didn't know what came over him and that he was sorry. It must be the stress of the dig weighing on him. He has another one on the way. I tried to reassure him but he seemed despondent so I left him alone. 

I just hope there will be no further incidents. This dig is teetering on the edge of a cliff as it is.



August 29th 1932

Things have just gone from bad to worse. There has been a plague- that is the only way to describe it- going through the camp. People have been vomiting all through the night. We've considered perhaps that the rations had gone bad but only a few men have come down with this mysterious illness. It is terrible to witness. Violent and disturbing. The substance they expel from their stomachs is- there is no word for it. I have never seen anything like it in my fifty seven years. Like tar, thick and black and shone an odd mixture of green and purple. It seemed to move on its own accord but thats-. Maybe it was a trick of the light. It must've been that, a simple trick of the light. Or I've been out here too long.



September 4th 1932

It's hopeless.



September 9th 1932

We found something. It's just a glimpse of something. We uncovered an opening and after lowering a lantern down we saw some odd stone. Definitely not natural. From the look of it it was impossibly smooth and the light bounced off it like nothing I've ever seen. The news has reinvigorated the men and I couldn't be more relieved of it. I could see they were starting to slip and the failure of the dig was starting to get to them. We've been out here for three months after all with no sight of anything remotely interesting and after… *the sickness* the men needed this morale boost. I've got a good feeling. This will be the find of the century, I know it.



September 22nd

We've continued excavation of 'the structure', as it has become known.



September 24th 

I have been examining the book that led us to this location, desperate for any sort of clues as to the nature of this ungodly structure and it remains as endlessly vexing as it was before. I have studied the book, cover to cover, hoping to gain some insight, and each time proves fruitless, the odd runes seeming more and more a jumbled mess each time. I have found something that I seemingly have overlooked in my previous study of the book. A sketch, of what I can now discern is our current location with a strange monolith-like structure reaching impossibly into the sky. Obviously there is nothing of the sort here. There are some phrases in the book, long rambling paragraphs that have the cadence of a sermon. A rambling preaching by a man so lost in his faith it has consumed him, unfortunately they make little to no sense at the best of times. The passage “and we shall indulge in one another and become the ouroboros of eternity given flesh” seems to be repeated many times throughout. 

My current theory is that this structure is a place of worship, though to what deity I haven’t the foggiest, a cathedral to the forgotten. I don’t want to imagine the sort of twisted divinity that would demand such a place.



~~September 34th~~

~~The dreams, they haunt my sleep and i can’t escape no matter how much I run~~

Disregard this entry. Lack of sleep.  


October 4th

It's colossal. Two weeks of straight digging and we haven't fully uncovered the structure. The walls reveal nothing. They are blank. Working near the stone is odd. You can see your reflection perfectly. But only that. Not the lanterns, not other people, it is truly odd. It has my stomach in knots. Looking into that mirror, you stand truly alone.



October 9th

More and more questions and no answers.



October 15th

I received a letter from my wife today and the pain of my family's absence has hit me in a way that I didn’t expect. The letter details my daughter's eighth birthday which I have unfortunately missed due to this dig. Just as I regretfully missed her first, fourth and fifth birthdays. The letter details her delight over my present, a small archaeology set that I put together, complete with brush and her own hat similar to the one I sport when I go on digs. My wife noted that she has refused to take off the hat for five days now. It pains me dearly that I can’t spend these days with my family but my career is something I hold very dear as well.



November 6th

The excavation is almost complete. It has been an enormous undertaking, much more than any of us had anticipated. The area we are uncovering seems to be the "front" of the structure, having seemingly more "decoration" though perhaps that isn't the best word for the odd patterns and curious carvings that line the wall. Queer swirling patterns that wind in on themselves and get lost and tangled. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to them and my best men cannot make heads or tails of it. No idea of any possible time period or known civilization they could have come from. I can get lost in them for hours, the intricate detail, every inch I follow reveals new details and patterns only for it to abruptly end and for me to realize it had seemingly led me nowhere. While the patterns inspire a sense of wonder and vastness that simply cannot be put into words, the carvings inspire something much darker. Faceless heads have been carved into the rock, again, seemingly at random. Due to the previously stated reflective nature of the rock, looking into this blank visages you would find yourself staring out from the infinite void within, as if you yourself had been carved into the rock. It inspired an odd feeling of fate, or destiny, a silly notion that somehow I had been selected by something higher than my understanding to find this structure. A feeling slithered inside me, while staring into my own, seemingly black, eyes, that everything in my life, every choice and look and breath had been guided by an invisible hand.

I am rambling. We estimate the size of the structure to be around one hundred and twenty meters by one hundred and ninety five meters.



November 17th.

People are starting to talk about going home for the winter and while it is disappointing it is also understandable, the pain of missing my own family is starting to weigh heavy on me. The only two who seem to share my vision are Albertson, which is no surprise as he has always been my stalwart defender and loyal companion and Moore who has only become more and more withdrawn since his spat with Thomson. He has been taking his meals in his tent, seeming to prefer solitude. He seems to have lost some weight, though he brings his plate back empty after meals. Something to keep an eye on.



November 27th

It is finally done. The structure has been fully excavated. It is glorious, more so than I could have ever imagined. A colossal monument of imposing nature, some fifty five meters high. It is almost otherworldly in its design, like nothing I have seen before. From the ancient Romans to modern day architects nothing matches the alien nature of what I have witnessed. The stone is immaculate which is impossible to even believe but we scoured the outside of the structure and there wasn't a single nick or scratch to be found. No erosion from water damage which is odd considering this area gets approximately 950mm of rain a year on average. This is especially strange when taking into account the flat roof of the structure. Never I'm my years have I seen something like it.

Our rough guess estimates of the size were close enough. They will be stated in full in the technical reports. 

As magnificent as the fully revealed structure is, this victory brings with it a new challenge. There is no entrance. The only thing that stands out from what has been newly uncovered is a 2.74 meter circle in the exact center of the 'front' of the structure.

The circle is entirely perfect.

It is endlessly frustrating to be denied at this pivotal juncture.



December 7th

Everyone else has left with the exception of Albertson and Moore. It feels childish of me to say but the thought of being alone with the structure sent a powerful chill throughout my being and to know that I've avoided such a scenario is the greatest of reliefs. Albertson and Moore have my endless thanks due to that fact alone. 

It is frustrating that our progress may slow with our lack of manpower and the increased caution that comes along with that but myself as well as the others are determined to see this through and at the very least discover the inside of this intimidating structure.

The entrance to the structure still manages to confound. The circular marking must be indicative of something, most simply an entryway of some kind, but remains resolutely obscure. Many of the men had suggested digging through the wall but I wouldn’t allow it. It was something that I had considered briefly but had discarded as something too drastic at the current moment. Both Albertson and Moore had agreed with me though Moore’s reasoning of it being “a great sacrilege” stood stark in my mind and had taken root in an uncomfortable way.

I will continue to consult the tome to see if I can glean some insight on this issue. Perhaps some primitive mechanism holds the door closed. I remain hopeful.

It simply must open.



December 11th

A curious phenomenon seems to be occurring that I have no logical explanation for. While my expertise lies solely in the fields of archaeology and history, the stars have always been a subject of interest for me. The mystery and majesty of the night sky while on a dig, illuminated in splashes of bright color is truly a unique sight. It gives a sense of scale like nothing else can. It touches the same sense of wonder that a new find does. While archaeology seeks to explore things lost in the past, the stars are the future and trying to grasp the possible discoveries of some unfathomable far flung future humans is enough to keep one occupied for an eternity.

That is all to say that I have a casual familiarity with the night sky, constellations and such, and I am certain there are stars missing, glaring voids where those pinpricks of light should be. I have consulted with Albertson and he agrees with me, though pointed out that some form of light pollution or other natural phenomena could be the cause.



December 15th

The structure is open. I wish I could claim some level of responsibility for this newest success however I have to admit that I played no part in it. I should be more suspicious of this occurrence but I find it difficult to assign the proper caution at this moment. The adrenaline that has been coursing through me all day is only now starting to wear thin. Ever since I saw it. The hole. It appeared overnight as if by unnatural means. A simple hole about half a meter in diameter. I must've stood there mesmerized by the twisting shadows that played inside for hours before calling from the others. We debated for a long time on whether or not it was safe to enter, Moore vehemently insisting that he had to go inside, while Albertson preached caution. Eventually something pulled me forwards and without a thought otherwise I climbed inside the hole, the sound of Albertsons protests fading behind me. It was a tight fit and the walls were much thicker than we ever would've thought and it took a good amount of shimmying to force my way through. Just when I thought my sense of claustrophobia would overwhelm me I tumbled out into a large room. The first thing I noticed was the stale quality to the air, and the lack of any noticeable airflow, as if the air from outside was being prevented from entering. The floor was much the same as the walls, the same black stone that seemed to drink the light leaving complete nothingness. It was an eerie sight that gave the impression of floating over an unimaginable void. I called back to the others that It was safe to enter and to pass me my lantern.

After they had made their way inside the structure, I pushed forward. Albertson and Moore inched along behind me, swinging my lantern this way and that though the odd nature of the stone meant that little was revealed at any one time. The room seemed bigger on the inside, which was surprising considering the colossal scale of the structure, though perhaps this was due to the reflective nature of the stone. The first thing we found was odd. A small pillar, about a meter across. It jutted out from the darkness, a shadow against shadow, made from the same queer stone. The most peculiar thing about it was that it didn't go all the way to the ceiling. In fact it was hardly half the size of the room. Clearly it wasn't for any kind of structural purpose which leaves me to conclude that it must be decorative in some sense. Perhaps ceremonial. There were two rows of these columns that led to the back center of the chamber.

The second and last thing we found instilled in me such a profound sense of dread that I fear will remain with me, even into death.

I am infinitely grateful for my cautious pace and Albertson’s quick hand as those factors prevented me from stepping into a large hole in the ground. As I held my lantern out over the hole only shadows swam up to meet me. I gained an incredible sense of height as I stood on the precipice as if standing on the edge of a cliff. The fear that struck me at that moment was something that I will remember always. 

After I had regained some sense of composure I pulled out a coin from my pocket, and tossed it into the hole, hoping to gain some idea of the depth.

It never made a sound.



December 16th 

The three of us have spent the day inspecting the inside of the structure, taking in the majesty and grace of its architecture. We have agreed to the terms that one person must remain outside the structure at all times as we are still unaware of the mechanism that caused the entrance to open. I find myself entranced and unnerved in equal measure during my time inside the structure and don’t like to linger there for too long. Albertson seems to share my mindset. Moore seems completely fascinated with the structure and will spend hours at a time in there. When I am in there, inspecting the walls and pillars for any clues as to the peoples who built this place he would simply stand at the hole gazing into it as if it were a beautiful vista. 



December 17th

The hole is an utter paradox in that it is mesmerizing and repulsive all at once. I am certain that it leads to that infernal plane that we mortals call Hell. It brings to mind the idea of the maw of a great beast, terrifying, endlessly hungry, devouring, consuming all. 

I am reminded, looking at the hole of something from my childhood. An old, abandoned well that my brother and I had found when out exploring the untamed wilderness of our homestead. I, immediately, was fearful of the well, my small childish mind not able to comprehend that the well wasn't an inescapable chasm of pure darkness. A place that could hold untold horrors, creatures of purest evil. My brother delighted in scaring me with stories of the monster in the well. I only grew out of my fear once I was slightly older and returned to the well with a torch. I lit the torch, tossing it in the well, illuminating the shadowy recesses that haunted my mind. Once I had seen there was nothing there my fear easily dissipated. Looking at the hole, I'm reminded of the moment I first laid eyes upon that well and despite the fact that I'm now a man grown it instills in me the same horrible terror. I told this to Albertson and while I punctuated my tale with a small chuckle to try and relieve the tension of it the uneasy look on his face told me I had failed. He suggested we throw one of the spare lanterns down the hole. Whether he thought that we would find nothing or a horrific nightmare in the illumination I wasn’t sure.

I dropped my lantern into the hole what seems like days ago. I can still see the pinprick of light, as if a single star in an empty night sky.  


December 18th

I woke up to a terrible sound, a ghastly wailing that struck my soul like a violent attack. Rushing out of my tent I came face to face with a stricken Albertson, a mirror of my equal mixture of confusion and discomfort. The sound was continuous, a horrible sound that I couldn’t picture coming from something human. It came from the structure. We shared a look of trepidation before rushing over there. There was a moment of deliberation, both of us unwilling to go first before I pushed myself forward, squeezing my way through the entrance and into the structure.

When I emerged on the other side, what I found scarred my mind in a way I couldn’t have imagined. 

The noise was coming from Moore, a deep, unsettling moaning that echoed off the walls to create a cacophony of sound, hundreds of voices joining his to create a terrible dirge, a solemn hymn to that terrible place. The song was deafening, as if all the souls of the damned were screaming out to me, pleading. Moore was kneeling before the hole, the arms held aloft as if in great exaltation. His face, lit by the harsh light of his lantern that rested by his knees, was a paradox of light and dark, frozen in a twisted mockery of jubilation. For a moment, as my eyes adjusted to the intense darkness, I could’ve sworn I saw a sea of robed figures standing in the room.

I rushed over to him and shook him desperately, wanting nothing more than for that terrible noise to stop. It felt as if the sound was seeping into me and when it finally stopped, it didn’t retreat right away, it stayed with me. The man looked at me but it felt as if he was seeing me from the bottom of a deep well, the water distorting his vision. I had the momentary thought, however much shame it brings me now, to throw the man into the hole, anything to stop that damned sound. Finally, my frustration peak and I struck the man across the face.

The spell seemed to be broken and he blinked awake from whatever fugue state he was in. Albertson and I helped Moore back to his tent where he collapsed on his cot.



December 19th  

Moore awoke in the middle of the night raving, his voice a shrill screeching that infected the night. He kept saying that he had to be inside ‘The Cathedral’ and that it was almost time. He spoke of ‘the face of divinity, of eternity’ and said that they shall indulge in one another. He preached about a grand city built by majestic beings, an ode to a holy pantheon of things so unimaginably vast that the human mind would shatter under the weight of their grace. He muttered about a dream that lasted an eternity, a gift from something deep in the annals existence, a quiver in the miasma of a newly born universe. He cried out about a vast antediluvian realm, where angelic beings made glorious music, a holy ode to life. He called it ‘The Undercity’

When I finally managed to calm the man and return him to his tent he just kept repeating the words, “It's time”.  
  


December 20th

As I was watching over Moore’s tent in the late afternoon, as the sun dipped behind the hills and the darkness started to infect the sky I heard a sound.

At first I thought it was just the wind, then convinced myself it was simply my mind playing tricks on me. Eventually I had to admit to myself that what I heard had started out as a low groan had progress into a bone chilling wail, filled with a terrible anger. The sound was so excruciating, so all encompassing, so suffocating, that all I could do was sit in place, staring straight ahead into the dirt and pray to the great lord above that I would never encounter whatever was making that sound. It sounded as it came to me from across such a vast distance that I couldn't possibly fathom.

It felt like it lasted for an eternity. It was as if the sound reach inside of me and dragged some part of me out, into that place, down that hole, lost to the mortal world forever. 

Eventually the sound died down and I still dare not move. I sat there for what ended up being hours, until the rustling of the Albertson’s tent broke me from my trance. He and I exchanged no words in the wake of what I know we both heard. I retreated to my rent while he took over the watch of Moore's tent. 



December 21st

What I have witnessed today will forever be scarred into my mind, the hideous consequence of an attack from some unimaginable horror. 

I awoke to the sound of a terrified scream that invaded my mind like a parasite. Quickly exiting my tent I came face to face with Albertson. We both wore mirrored expressions of a most solemn dread. In our minds at that moment we knew without a doubt that the sound was coming from Moore and that he was inside the structure. We both rushed to the entrance of the structure and after a moment's hesitation, a shared look of trepidation between myself and my long trusted companion, I pushed myself though the small passageway that served as the entrance to the structure.

Halfway through a paralyzing wave claustrophobia passed over me and the terrifying sense that if I passed through the tunnel I would be irreversibly altered coursed through me. Another horrific howl piece the fog that had engulfed me and I pushed myself out into the interior chamber of the structure.

The room was lit with the glow of what must have been Moore's lantern and what I saw cannot truly be described.

It seemed to be a mass. A mass of flesh, roiling and tumultuous like a stormy sea. It had no eyes, no features that I could discern and yet as soon I as I was aware of it, I knew, somehow, it was aware of me in kind. The presence of it bore down on me as if a hundred thousand people suddenly turned to me and I froze under that intense scrutiny. As an ant looked upon a human being, I looked upon it. It seemed to swell in my vision, grow and grow until it was an impossible size, engulfing everything in sight. I felt as if I lay bear under the gaze of some unknowable deity, some forlorn divinity forgotten to human kind.

Before I could be consumed by that unknown I rushed forward towards Moore. The creature had ensured him somehow and due to how slowly the thing moved all I can imagine is that Moore approached it willingly. Getting close revealed more hideous details of the thing and I once again struck with a timeless terror.

The creature wasn't made of flesh but rot. A huge mass of rot, of discard, of mottled leaves and shed insect carapace, of things forgotten, left behind. The dregs of reality. The smell was thick and cloying, giving the sense of a place forgotten, abandoned for a millennia, an eternity. The thing pulsed and undulated, some kind of vile ichor, a disgusting oil pit of oblivion. I swear, for just a moment the face of my long dead grandfather rose up from that mass to greet me like some hazy memory from the back of my mind. It was a face that I had forgotten long ago, only ever knowing him as a young boy but I am certain it was him.

The sound of my name reached me and I realized that Moore was wailing, crying out for my help, arm outstretched towards me.I reached out and grasped the man's arm with my own but at that moment I realized something was *wrong* with Moore.

His face, his skin was melding, melting into the creature, merging with it into some sick amalgamation of human and thing. I tried to pull back, a desperate panic overtaking me, but it was like trying to pull down a cliffside and no amount of force I used seemed to have even the tiniest effect. 

The moment I tried to pull away Moore's hand, what was left of it, tightened around my arm with vice like strength. Looking into the man's eyes only a fanatical kind of fever remained and nothing of the man I knew.

A searing heat crept up my arm, slowly invading my entire being. The pain was so much that I was barely able to think. All I knew was that soon I would be just like Moore, merged with this creature to be taken back to the ungodly realm within which it dwelled. I knew in that moment that death would be preferable as by merging with that unholy abomination I would be so far from our lord that I could never reach his great gates.

The next thing I knew I was on the floor, my arm still writhing with pain but my senses returned to me. Albertson helped me up and dragged me towards the entrance in my half delirious state. With his help I just managed to escape that oppressive tomb, that damnable cathedral to some unknowable thing from the dark depths of existence.

The pain still coiled around my arm, a thousand needles stabbing into my skin and as I looked down I found my arm in the same horrific state that Moore was in. My skin was moving, transformed into that fleshy mass, as if an uncountable amount of slugs raved in orgy to that deity, the one to which I now know the structure was built to honor.

Looking to Albertson the man was wielding a large machete and while I knew it was the correct course, the only course of action, to take I didn't relish the idea. I must have passed out at some point as I woke up some time later with my arm bandaged, severed from just above the elbow.

I am writing this now as I fear that if I wait any longer, I will try to dismiss these events as some feverish nightmare. 



January 18th

The committee has declared the dig and utter failure and revoked any remaining grants. I am relieved that I never had to return to that wretched place. The committee sent someone back to the site to collect the equipment and claimed to find no evidence of the structure. I am reluctant to return to the site myself to confirm this. The men don't remember the structure. Only Albertson and I, and perhaps Moore, if, as I suspect, he still exists in some form, have any recollection of the events pertaining to the structure.

Both myself and Albertson are content to go along with this story, what we found inside that pit should remain buried, though I suspect it shall not. It will find a way out.
