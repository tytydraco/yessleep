16th of August, 1969. 

It is widely celebrated as one of mankinds biggest achivement. Yet, among the Apollo 11 crew, we know we are at fault for the doom of humanity.

There we were; me, Henry King, and William Ross. We were floating through space within the Lunar Module. It was tight and cramped, the feeling of anxiety was harsh on me. And the 3 day trip wasn't helping any of that. 

"So... we got 3 days." said Henry, trying to spark up a conversation. 

"Mhm, and I already have to shit." said William. Henry was clearly amused by Williams statement. 

"Don't be childish, William." I chimmed in. "And Henry, don't encourage his behavior."

"Oh, boo hoo, Hakita. Stop being a party popper." retorted Henry.

"Henry's right, we have 3 days in here and if you are going to keep up that attitude then it's going to be a long 3 days." 

"I'm being serious, this is an important mission and we-" Henry cut me off. "I do not care. Just because you were assigned 'captain' doesn't dictate shit."

Just then, the mission control chimed in. "From mission control to Lunar Module, do you copy, over." 

I quickly responded "Mission control, this is Lunar Module, we hear you loud and clear, over." 

Henry quietly mimicked me as William giggled under his breath at Henry's impression. I shot Henry a glance but he didn't care too much. 

"Lunar Module, we hear you loud and clear as well. Your journey is going flawlessly so far. We will check in every 3 hours. We wish you a flawless trip, over."

And just like that, silence filled between us 3. I laid down as Henry and William were talking about family and movies. I wasn't really paying attention until Henry called out to me.

"Hey, grumpy pants. Talk a little why don't ya?" 

I sighed at what he called me before deciding to ignore it. I sat up and faced them. "Here, you have my attention. Ask." 

"God, you are insufferable." he mumbled, I could clearly hear him though. "So, family. What's yours like?" asked Henry. 

"They are fine, my father's a retired mechanic and my mom's a stay at home. And my sister's working on this mission, he is one of the people on the communications system."

"Ooooh, I think I know her." William nudged Henry to stop talking and he shut up. I decided to ignore what he said and laid back down. 

And then William chimed in. "So, any good books or movies you like?" 

"Something Wicked This Way Comes." I said. Henry spoke with a grin "I'm also coming." William ignored Henry's joke and continued talking. "I have read that book before." 

"Cool." I said. After that William and Henry continued talking. Somewhere along the first day, I fell asleep. When I woke up, I saw Henry sleeping as William was focusing on a notebook. 

When he noticed my awakening he talked. "Morning." 

"Is it actually?" I said back. 

"I don't know." He said back. I looked at him and hesitantly asked. "What are you writing?" 

"Oh, it's just my thoughts. I'm planning on writing all of this down."

"Why?" 

"It's my sister. She is severly sick and her sickness has her bedridden. I thought maybe this journey could uplift her spirits." 

I stared at him awkwardly, not knowing what to say. "Cool." Was the only thing I could say.

He stopped writing and looked at me. "Hey, Hakita."

"Yeah?" 

"If you had the choice, would you take a better life in exchange of binding your soul to an entity?"

"Might. I mean, a billionaire isn't made without selling your soul." He nodded at my response and continued writing. It was strange, I didn't have much time to think on it though as the radio came back on. 

"Lunar Module, this is mission control. Do you hear us, over." 

I quickly went over to the radio and responded. "Mission control, this is Lunar Module. We hear you loud and clear, over." 

"Good, Lunar Module. I hope everything is alright over there, over." 

"Thank you, mission control. Everything is fine over here, over."

"Good to hear, Lunar Module. We hope you have no accidents for the rest of your journey, over." And like that, silence took over again. The only noise being the scribbling noise Williams pencil made. 

I sat there, thoughtless as ever until Henry woke up. 

"Hey, big man. Hope our talk didn't ruin your nightly sleep." said Henry to me.

"No, don't worry too much." 

"Yeah..." he awkwardly floated over to William and looked at his writings. 

As I sat there, the pit inside my stomach was growing bigger and bigger. The anxiety I felt twisting my stomach into all shapes and sizes.
I have never been good at interacting with people. I always practiced what to say to myself over and over again, yet the words would just fold in on itself whenever I spoke. And that feeling wasn't gone. Seeing William and Henry talking without much thought made the isolating feeling I had grow larger.

My sister had always been different. Brilliant, outgoing, everyone wanted her. She always brought me along to her meetups. She said it would be a good way to find like minded people. Said it'd ease my anxiety. It never did, because I never wanted it to. I know what my problems are, and I know their solution. I just refuse to give into something like this, because change isn't something I need. 

As the feeling swallowed me whole, I heard Henry speak. "So, cap. What's got your mind all wobbled up? Are you thinking of a girl you have a crush on?"

I sighed at his immature question. I was about to scold him, but I held myself back. "No, not really. What about you, Henry? Any lucky ones?" it felt like my lungs were imploding in on itself when I spoke to him in an honest way instead of closing him off. 

He looked a little startled at my change in attitude from the day prior and smiled. "Nah, but if I had to pick it'd be your sister." He knew he was pushing his limits, and I didn't feed into it.

"Well, she is a though one to crack. You won't be the first to try, so good luck." His smile softened, more genuine than it had been before. 

"What does she like?"

"Hell if I know. Just try whatever you like. She hates ingenuity."

"That's not going to help much." he was right, but I didn't know what else to say. Even though she is as close as anyone could be to me, it felt like I never really knew anything about her. 

"Lunar Module, this is mission control. Do you copy, over."

I went over to the radio and talked. "Mission control, this is Lunar Module. We hear you loud and clear, over."

"Good. Lunar Module, your second day is coming to a close in a few hours. I'm hoping everything is alright up there, over."

"Yes, everything is fine. Thank you for the concern mission control, over."

"Good, we will check again later, over."

With that, without room for silence, Henry spoke. 

"2nd day is almost over. Unbelievable."

All 3 of us had felt it too, maybe it was a side effect. As time passed by, I decided to go to sleep after talking to them a bit more. The feeling of anxiety started to wear down. 

I was shaken awake and a hand was covering my mouth. I could barely make out that it was Henry and he whispered to me. "Don't make a noise, I need to show you this."

He let me go and I looked around. William had been asleep already and was laying down on his floor bed. I looked at him as he showed me Williams notebook. 

"Look at these writings. This... I... is William ok?"

I stared at the pages Henry was turning. Thousands of symbols and crude drawing of the moon itself. Every page had the same sentence in it. 'I must feed THEM.' It went on for 100s of pages. He couldn't have written this all in the 2 days we have been here. 

Before I could whisper back, Henry whispered again. "This isn't the only notebook." Before I could process what that meant, he showed me the bag William had brought as personal 'necessities'. Countless notebooks were inside. I looked through a few them and every single one had been the same symbols and words. 

My stomach fell again, and rock that was glowing in his bag didn't help me. 

I whispered to Henry "What the fuck is this?"

"I don't know? Did they not check bags?"

"No, they did. How did this get pass?"

"I don't know how, but I don't like that it's William."

"What do you mean?"

"I don't know. I just cannot put my finger on it but he feels... not there. I do most of the talking and he just listens and has this smile on his face. It feels so artificial. Like, I can tell you are actually real. Even though you are a dick, it's something. With him, it's just... I don't know."

"So you think we have a lunatic at our hands?"

"Yeah, but how did we get him here? They went through a background check on me before this. So they should have done one for him too."

I sighed and looked into the bag again, the rock caught my eye. I reached out. I grabbed the rock and could feel my heart pounding more and more. The rock had a squishy texture to it. I let go of it with disgust.

"Just put it back, we can talk about this later. I just want this mission to be over with."

After putting it back, Henry laid back down. "I'll rest a bit. I haven't slept at all, going through all of that." 

I nod to him and time passes. The feeling in my stomach gives way to a new feeling I never felt before. It felt like my sister was calling out to me. I brushed it off and continued looking at Henry and William laying down.

I answer mission controls check ins every once in a while and eventually William wakes up. 

"Hey." I call out to him. He looked back at me... was his eyes always this soulless? I feel like I'm seeing a thousand different inconsistencies in his body as I look at him. I wasn't sure if it was my anxiety or something else.

"We are almost there. Halfway through the 3rd day. They said we will be there in 4 to 5 hours." 

He smiled, I have seen this man smile and as Henry had put it, it felt artificial. But this one was genuine. But not in a good way. If his pass time was filling notebooks with those, then what made this man crack that smile.

"That's very good news." said William, pulling me out of my thoughts. I didn't talk to him for the rest of the time. As we approached to the last 2 hours, the radio came in again.

"Lunar Module, this is mission control. Come in, over."

William made it there before I could register a thought.

"This is Lunar Module, over."

"Lunar Module, you are approaching the atmosphere in an hour and 10 minutes. We recommend strapping yourself down for the landing. Don't forget your mission briefing. Be thorough in those caves, over."

That was not apart of the briefing we had.

"We will do so, over."

"Good luck, over."

Before I could say anything, Henry spoke.

"What caves? The mission isn't about any caves. We just needed to land and take a photo."

"You must have fell asleep. We did have an order to check the big cave on the surface. Right, Hakita?"

"I..." I was about to agree with Henry, but then I remembered it. I agreed with William and told off Henry.

Henry looked at me reluctantly before nodding. We strap ourself on the beds and eventually we enter the atmosphere of the Moon. The counter trusters kick in as the Lunar Module shakes violently before we softly touch down. We put on our protective suits and walk out into the rocky planet surface. It felt exhilarating, this thrilling feeling in me. 

Henry yelled at me. "Hey, big man! Let's pose for a photo!" Henry had set up the camera already. He seemed excited, and I understood it. He had been talking about the photo ever since we set off. Saying he'd show it off to the ladies and impress them.

"I'll take the photo and you go ahead and go in with Hakita." said William. I agreed as Henry slowly bounced over to me. We took a nice photo and William handed it over to Henry. "Man, captain. I'm definitely going to tell the ladies about you too. Don't worry, you'll get some fame from my stories. The big bad captain who saved us all." 

I placed the photo into the ship as he went on about the made up story he would tell the ladies. When I got out, we started following William to the cave he was talking about. And Henry was still babbling about the heroic story.

It felt like the walk took us hours, yet my legs felt fresh all the way through. We finally made it though. 

"Here it is." said William. 

"God, I don't like this cave. Do we have to?" said Henry.

"Don't be a wuss." said William. We slowly walked into the cave, the ground felt soft and sticky. The darkness only raising my anxiety as I felt my heart pound again. After a few minutes, my mind snapped back.

"Wait, why are we here?" I said. Henry looked at me, confused. "What do you mean? You said this was apart of the mission." 

I looked around, "No, William said that."

"Yeah, and you seconded him." said Henry. I looked at him with confusion.

"No I didn't. I..." and then I realized something. I haven't muttered a single word throughout that last day and until we entered this cave. Someone or something has been speaking for me.

"Henry, we are leaving." I quickly started walking towards the entrance. 

"Hey, wait! What's the problem?" Henry walked behind me in a confused manner. Before I could take another step, William spoke. 

"Where are you going, Hakita?" I looked back at William, my body froze in space. "Where are you going with my flesh?" 

That same thumping feeling appeared in my hand as I looked down at my hand. The rock in the ship. How long have I been holding onto it? 

Henry looked at the rock in my hand and started moving as fast as he could to the exit of the cave. I, in the other hand, couldn't move. 

I looked back at William. "William has been playing really nice with me, but he isn't my interest. He wants stuff. He yearns. Yet you, my dear. You don't yearn." 

William started walking towards me, but I knew that wasn't William. I don't know what was going on but I knew for a fact that was not William. I heard Henry's screams in the back as 'William' approached. 

"He yearned for his sister to get well. And such a being like me could never fulfill that wish. I'm not one for harmony."

The cave slowly started enveloping me. The thumping getting louder and louder. The walls were breathing into me, I felt my heart beat in unison along with something else. And it spoke again.

"I need to be whole again." it took its flesh back out of my hand and plunged it through Williams protective glass and straight into his face. 

"They are coming, Hakita. Consider yourself lucky." 

Before I could speak I got cut out of the trance with Henry screaming.

"HAKITA, HELP ME." I looked back to see 'William' bashing at Henry's glass. Henry was swallowed half way through one of the floors of the cave so he couldn't move.

I quickly pushed 'William' off to the side and tried pulling Henry out. 'William' just stared at us, watching me struggle.
"It is no use." said Henry. "Leave." I stared down at him. Regret filling up my stomach like a rush of water. 

If Henry was alive today, I would bash him, talk about how much of a fucker he is. I would berate him about how unprofessional he is. 

I miss Henry. I can't say anything about him, but he was enjoyable to be around. I walked out of the cave and slowly walked back to the Lunar Module. I could hear 'William' punching at the helmet Henry had the rest of the way. 

As I got on the module, I felt the planet rumble, like a hungry animal. I slowly pressed the radio. 

"Mission control... this is Lunar Module. Under unfortunate circumstances, I will be making it home alone, over."

Without a word from mission control, the module started it's rockets. I looked at the photo of me and Henry and placed it into my bag. 

The 3 days back was uneventful, mission control didn't check in once as I floated in space. Eventually, I entered back into the atmosphere. The module landed in the ocean and was later found by the ship they had sent out. 

Later in the day, they brought me into an office for a talk.

"So, Mr. Hakita. How was your trip? Please recount your trip."

I told him about the brief time we were on the planet.

"Yes, it is unfortunate that William had to succumb." said the guy in front of me. I looked at him, confused at how casual he was about it.

"We have grabbed the photo from your bag. Here is a copy for yourself, Mr Hakita." I sighed and pocketed it.

"What about my sister?" I said as the man was leaving. "Will she be working on the next mission? I hope she did well."

The man stood there for a few minutes before speaking. "Mr Hakita, what is the name of your sister?"

My words were stuck in my throat, I couldn't say anything. No, more like I couldn't even remember a single thing. 

"Exactly. Have a good day, Mr Hakita." I sat there, no words. I looked down at the photo he had given me. Me. Just me. Henry wasn't on it. I got out of the office and tried to find someone to talk about this, but security escorted me out. 

When I made it home, I needed answers. I looked and looked. No records of my sister existed. Every person I swear I had spent time together with my sister said that only me and them spent time together. 

But the results for Henry King, that was different. I found him on facebook, and reached out. He told me he didn't know me. Apparently he did try out for the program, but he failed to qualify.

After that, I waited for the article to publish, hoping for more answers. Yet, I got nothing. It was a fake article about those 3 scum that you currently know as the Apollo 11 crew. They had covered up the entire truth with fabricated lies, and I have never found an answer to my questions.

Till this day, I haven't gotten any answers, and I don't think I ever will.
