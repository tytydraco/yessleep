Updated Entry – Posted July 21, 2025

It’s been a while since I last updated this.

By the time you’re reading this, it’ll be July 21st.

I’ve continued writing, recording, and mapping my way through this… hell. I don’t even know what to call it anymore. At this point, it’s more of a biography than a log. And if you’re reading this, it likely means many things—none of them good.

As most of you know, I’m schizophrenic. This thread, this writing—it’s been my anchor. A lifeline to hold my sanity in place. A reminder that what I’m experiencing is real—or at least, I hope it is.

For almost two weeks now, I’ve been mapping this building.
And with each passing day, the outside world slips further out of reach.

It’s just me and Cleo now.
Me and my dog.
And the building.

—

Some of you suggested I call Dr. Sharpen. That I let him in. That I take him up on his offer.

And you know what?
I did.

Almost like the building wanted me to.

I let him inside—just to test it. See if he could see what I see.
But when I tried to show him anything… it all looked normal.

Fluorescent lights. Clean tile. Empty, ordinary halls.
No pulsing walls. No ichor. No labyrinths.
Nothing.

He met Cleo, and of course, he didn’t approve.
He said she was a “distraction.”
That dogs weren’t allowed in my building.

Thing is… I live in assisted living.
Not an asylum.
I’m functional enough.

But something about the way he looked at her—like she wasn’t even real. Like I was the only one seeing her.
And worse, like everyone else was trying to take her away from me.

Then it got stranger.

When we “left” the building… we ended up right back on the couch in my living room.
Again.
And again.
And again.

Looped.

“Well, that’s our time,” he’d say every time, calm as ever.
“It seems like your condition may be worsening. I’ll be prescribing something stronger. Do you have any questions for me?”

The exact same words. The exact same pause.

No recollection of the loop from him.

Once, I snapped.
Tried to pull him into the hallway to show him the truth.
And I was forcibly removed.

Next thing I knew, I was back on the futon.
Cleo in my lap.
Sharpen in the same chair.
Same fucking smile.

Cleo and I just stared at him.

This wasn’t therapy anymore.
It was a performance.
A reset.

Eventually, I stopped fighting it. I nodded through the motions. Let him speak. Let him leave.
And then I got back to work.

I’ve spent the past two weeks documenting everything.
Every turn. Every hallway. Every crack in this reality.
And now, I’m writing it down. Uncut. Untampered.

This is everything I’ve gathered.

Monday, July 14 – 3:00 PM

Floor 6

After clearing out the fifth-floor courtyard, Cleo and I decided to continue our climb.

The elevator only moved in one direction now—up. Nine floors total. buttons to return. Seemed that the only escape routes is the elevator.

The sixth floor felt… off.

Lights lingered longer than they should. The hallway warped as if stretched too thin. Windows showed nothing—just black. Like the glass had forgotten how to reflect.

Still, I rationalized. I lied to myself.
But the whispers—around me and inside me—kept spilling through, bleeding into thought.

“She’s the least of your problems now.”
“What have you done?”
“You think there’s an end to this?”
“Always too curious…”

Cleo tugged at her leash harder than usual, dragging me forward—like even she didn’t want to linger.
I followed.

Eventually, the corridor looped.

Back to the start.

That’s when I realized: each floor is a labyrinth. One entrance in. One exit out.
The elevator is the only constant.

I marked it in my notebook. Labeled it: Explored.
Third-grade class project style.

Cleo and I returned to the elevator, bracing ourselves for whatever came next.
Time: 5:00 PM.
We ascended.

Monday, July 15– 5:07 PM

Floor 7

It took too long to arrive. Or maybe it didn’t, and I was just unraveling faster now.

When the doors opened…

Everything changed.

The walls sagged like skin, bloated and split with blood-blisters.
The paint peeled like flaking scabs, revealing pulsing veins beneath—slick with ichorous mucus.
It was like standing inside a rotting lung.

My watch said 5:07 PM. We had only just arrived.
But I felt like we’d already overstayed our welcome.

The floor was coated in black tar and mucus.
Each step left behind a footprint that oozed and then vanished behind us.
The building wasn’t just growing.

It was breeding.

Doorways without doors. Scribbled symbols—failed attempts at language—lined the walls.
Everything dripped. Everything breathed.
Wet. Heavy. Sick.

Cleo pulled harder.
Like she was asking: Why are we here? What did we come looking for?

I wondered the same.
But deep down, I already knew.

Confirmation.
If this wasn’t real… then what the hell was?

We found the loop. Same layout.
One entrance. One exit.
Just like before.

Marked. Logged.
We moved on.

⸻

Monday, – Time Lost

Floor 8

Worse. Somehow.

The maze twisted tighter. The air turned toxic.
The wheezing halls seemed alive—struggling to breathe.

Cleo refused to walk near certain corridors, and I didn’t argue.
Ink wouldn’t stick to the walls.
It just sank in.
Like the building didn’t want to be remembered.

⸻

Monday, date loss July 14? – 8:50 PM

Floor 9

Something about this floor felt… familiar.

Almost like my floor. Like Floor 8. But wrong.

There were windows now. Real ones. But they only looked out into fog.
The coppery stench clung to everything.
It felt like this place was trying to appear normal.
Like it was preparing to be… finished.

But Cleo didn’t trust it. She wouldn’t walk down some halls.

We heard whispers. Laughter. Pre-recorded ambiance.

Fake.
Fabricated.

Rooms seemed lived-in from a distance—but up close, dead. Empty.

I tried marking our progress, but again—the walls absorbed it.
Corporate drywall melting into memory foam.

It felt like hours.

I wanted something. Anything.
Even Ms. Grace, or someone like her. Some sign of life.

But there was nothing.
Just isolation.
Me. Cleo. This place.

At 11:38 PM, we finally reached the end.

And that’s when we saw it—
An older elevator. Rusted brass. Faintly humming.

I should’ve turned back.
But I didn’t.

I had come too far.
I didn’t pack all this gear for nothing.

Something was calling to me.
Cleo felt it too.

We looked at the elevator.

And then… it opened.
By itself.

The buttons  led up—Floors 10 through 14.

We stepped inside.

⸻

Date loss– 12:07 AM

Floor 10

It looked like another rooftop courtyard at first.
But wider. Too wide.
It looked like an abandoned parking garage, stretching into infinity.

Pipes leaked black ichor.
Gated windows revealed a skyline blurred in fog.

I was so close to the outside world.
But I’ve never felt further away.

And then it hit me—

What if this is all in my head?

This floor was too massive to exist in the real building.
What if I’m just sitting alone in a real parking lot, scribbling nonsense on paper?

If it weren’t for the working outlets up here, my phone and gear would’ve died.
I’d be reduced to writing all of this in my journal… rambling into void.

Still.
Cleo saw what I saw.

That had to mean something.
Right?

We mapped Floor 9. The layout didn’t make sense.
But it was explored.

And now we were here.

I could’ve gone back.
But I didn’t.

Instead, I set up my tent in the furthest corner of this concrete graveyard.
I felt the breeze.
Even if it wasn’t real.

Cleo laid beside me—watchful, still.

And then the voices came back.

“Useless.”
“You think you know everything.”
“You’ll never see the end.”
“She is coming. Run.”
“You’ll never amount to anything.”

Over and over.
Like a vinyl warped by heat.

Cleo stopped. Looked at me.
Ears tucked.

“I’m here,” she said without saying anything.
“Just focus.”

So I did.

I laid out the tarmac across the concrete, pulled Cleo close, and drifted into sleep.

Waiting to see what this fucking building throws at us next.


Tuesday – Floor 11

Time: Unknown

We arrived after a long rest.
Breakfast. Water. Small comforts.

Everything had been going fine—until the elevator opened.

Then all hell cracked open.

Red. Everything—red.
Flashing emergency lights. Thick mist hung in the air like it had nowhere else to go.
This floor was burned.
Charred beyond recognition.

The walls, scorched. Ceilings half-collapsed. The stench of ash suffocating.
We stepped forward into blackened ruins.

Then I saw them.

Bones.

Scattered through the wreckage—but not human.
Some had too many limbs.
Others… two hips sharing the same pelvic cradle.
Whatever they were, they weren’t from here.
Or weren’t meant to be.

Someone tried to burn this floor down.
Tried to erase it.

Failed.

Walls collapsed into each other like dying lungs.
Cleo and I pressed forward. We weren’t even speaking.

Then… she took off. Fast.
She saw something.

And she ran.

I barely kept up—hallways twisting around us like intestines. The skeletal structures groaned, wheezed, collapsed.
And the voices screamed now—not whispered.
Not subtle.

“RUN.”
“Too late.”
“What did you bring her for?”
“You fool.”g
“She’s not yours to save.”

Cleo bolted harder. My grip slipped.
She vanished down the hall.

“CLEO!!”
“CLEO, WAIT!!”

But she was gone.

I sprinted, but no matter how fast I moved—she only got further away.
Eventually, she disappeared entirely into the fog-drenched red.

I searched. For hours. Maybe longer.

Every hallway looked the same.
Like a looping trauma reel burned onto my retinas.

I stopped trusting time.
I stopped writing.
I stopped thinking.

My only mission: Find Cleo.

Then—I saw it.

An elevator.
Old. Rusted. Bloodstained. Still humming.

I turned back.

Waited.

“Why did you bring her?”
“You knew this would happen.”
“You never deserved her.”

No Cleo.
Just the buzzing.
Just me.

I cried until the ceiling lights flickered—maybe in sympathy.
Then I pressed the button.

There was no going back now.

⸻

Tuesday – Floor 12

Time: Forgotten

After losing Cleo, I forgot how to navigate.
She was more than my companion—she was my guide.
Now I was just stumbling.

The elevator doors opened…
And I stood in the middle of a neighborhood.

Not just one.
Every neighborhood I had ever lived in.
All stitched together in one surreal, infinite cul-de-sac.

Familiar houses. Streets I grew up on.
People… alive and dead.

They stepped outside as I passed.
Perfect smiles. Clean clothes. Watching me like I didn’t belong.

I didn’t.

They looked at me with pity.
With disgust.
With empathy.

“Hey, haven’t seen you in a while. Come inside.”
“Where you going?”
“Still hung up on that dog?”
“Don’t worry. It’s for the best.”

I ignored them.
Kept moving.
Pushed through the cul-de-sac. To the elevator.
Pressed on to Floor 13. Then 14.

And each level got worse.

The voices got louder.
The faces more aggressive.
The invitations more manipulative.

“Come rest.”
“You’re tired.”
“Let us help.”

By the fourteenth floor, I was just a husk.
Shoving translucent arms off of me. Faces of old friends. Family. Lovers.
Mocking me with concern.
Twisting empathy into chains.

They grabbed at me, their fingers stretching too long to be human.

They whispered:

“You’re on the wrong path.”
“Cleo doesn’t matter.”
“You’ll never make it.”

I shoved them.
One lunged—I threw them off.

Were they even real?
Was I?

The halls melted into massive atriums—dozens of doors stacked like honeycomb.
No windows. No stairs.
Just whispers.
And rooms.
And me.

Still moving.

And then—I saw it.

Dr. Sharpen’s office.

⸻

It stood at the end of a blood-red corridor.
Just like I remembered it.
Plaque. Desk lamp. His voice.

“Derek,” he said gently.
“There you are.”

He stood inside.
Warm. Calm. Familiar.
Inviting.

“You’ve always been lost. Let me help you now.”
“Come in. You’ve suffered enough.”

I almost did.
I almost walked in.

Then I looked at the door.

It wasn’t attached to anything.

It was floating.
Framed in rot.
Disconnected from the world.

And there was no Cleo inside.

I stepped forward.
My hand on the doorknob.
But he grabbed it.

His grip tightened.

His face—smile gone.
Eyes hard.

“Don’t do this. If you keep going, there’s no coming back.”

I looked him dead in the eye.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered.
“But I’m not done yet.”

And I slammed the door shut.

The elevator behind me lit up:
Floor 15.

I turned.
Stepped inside.

There’s nothing but up now.

Floor 15

Time: Right when I needed it.

The ride was long. Too long.
I nearly passed out before the ding.

And then—

An overgrown parking garage.
Concrete cracked under wild roots.
Trash piled up in places untouched by time.
Fog spilled in from open, gated walls.

This place had been forgotten.

And then I heard it.

A bark.
Low. Familiar.

Cleo.

She was sitting—tail wagging slowly.
As if to say: About time.

She looked exactly the same.

But her eyes…
She had seen things.

I collapsed beside her.
Held her. Buried my face in her fur.

“Where were you?” I choked out.

No answer.
Just presence.

Warmth.

Real.

For the first time in… what feels like eternity… I felt whole.

Even if death comes next.
Or madness.
Or worse.

We’ll face it. Together.

I pitched the tent in the far corner. Fired up the camp stove.
The darkness was thick—but I didn’t care.

We made it.

A checkpoint.

I know this isn’t over.
The voices are still there. The whispers. The lies.

“Turn back.”
“They know.”
“It knows.”
“Ms. Grace was nothing compared to what’s coming.”

But now Cleo’s here.

And when we both stared into the void of that fenced-up courtyard—
we knew.

This is real.

And it’s almost over.

Return to Floor 4-reluctantly 

Date/time of departure: unknown

And as I lay here—exhausted, frayed, unraveling at the seams—with whatever’s left of my body, my sanity, and the hell Cleo and I just crawled out of, I realize we’re not safe.

Not even close.

A few half-dead portal batteries.
Dried food, scattered rations—if you can call it that.
My body aches. Cleo is quiet. We’re surviving off scraps I managed to salvage from the gear bag.

But we’re going to starve.
That’s the reality.

We can’t continue climbing like this.
Not without supplies. Not without strategy.

Which means one thing:
We have to go back down.

Through every floor we fought tooth and nail to escape.
Back through the red haze. The shadows. The whispers. The things.

Back to Floor Four.

Just to resupply.
To regroup.
To… think.

This isn’t just madness anymore. It’s math. Strategy. Terrain. We need to stockpile at each checkpoint. Plan rations. Replace batteries. Create a network—if we want to go further up. If we want to see what’s above Floor 15. If there even is an above.

After resting. After a long breath that felt more like a whimper—I reminded myself of the only truth I still trust:

We made it once. We can make it again.
Cleo and I—together.

I don’t even remember what time we began our descent.
Could’ve been morning. Could’ve been a full day later.
Time doesn’t flow the same anymore.
It waits, sometimes.
And sometimes it runs without you.

But somehow, after retracing every level—some clearer than others, some now warped by memory or trauma or both—we finally returned to Floor Four.

The date: July 19, 2025
Time: 11:42 a.m.

Back where it started.

Same hallway.
Same busted light above the laundry unit.
Same peeling paint that smelled like old pine and something worse.
Same apartment.

My door creaked open like it had been expecting me.

And inside—nothing had changed.
Not the stained couch. Not the journal on the table.
Not the untouched pile of clothes I swore I’d wash.

Some food had spoiled. The stench hit me hard.
But the rest?

The rest was untouched.

Like the building knew we’d come back.

I took a shower.
Cleo drank like she’d been in the desert for a month.
She collapsed after that—deep sleep, no dreams.

Me? I stood in front of the mirror for a long time.
Long enough for the fog to clear and still not recognize who was staring back.

I was ill-prepared for this journey.
I see that now.

But what’s worse…
Is knowing that I’ll do it again.

Because I have to.
Because something is up there.
And it knows I’m coming.
And I know it’s waiting.

When this entry goes live—July 21st—I’ll probably already be packing. Already reviewing maps, notes, charging what I can.

Not to run.
Not to escape.
But to go further.

Further than anyone else has.

But I know this place isn’t just reacting anymore.
It’s plotting.

The build—this monstrous thing—knows me.
It’s not just haunted.
It’s aware.

And I think it’s planning its next move too.

So this time…
We’re both preparing.

Let’s see who breaks first.

Update – July 23, 2025 | 6:35 PM

I’ve been stocking up on MREs.
Looking over my transactions lately, I’m starting to feel like one of those Mormon millionaires prepping for the end times.
The room feels smaller now.
Floor 4 is shrinking—almost like the walls are closing in, forcing us to keep moving forward.

The deeper I explore, the more time slips.
Not in hours or days, but in moments.
It’s like time is accelerating…
…but motion isn’t keeping up.

I’m sleep-deprived.
Dragging all these supply buckets up to the highest point I could reach.
The building feels empty now. Like it’s holding its breath.
Waiting for a storm.

I just wanted to drop one last entry before the next phase begins.

For now, I’m signing off.
My ascension starts tonight.

If time continues accelerating the way it has, I won’t be able to write again for a while.

So if you don’t hear from me in two months…
Expect the worst.
And if I make it out—

I’ll see you on the other side.
—Derek
