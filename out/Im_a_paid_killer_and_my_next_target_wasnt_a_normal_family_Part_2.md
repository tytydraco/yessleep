Tw: child abuse, mutilation

Hello again, do you remember that I mentioned something was coming?

Yeah, well, that instinct was right, the son tried to kill me. Pretty sure his name was Cody, damn brat had a knife.

Good news is, I beat the shit outta him, and he's definitely out cold, except he slashed my arm. Nothing fatal, considering myself lucky it wasn't a vein. I simply patched myself up and started planning.

A day or so ago, I had time to read comments. One suggested that these things could have a parasite of sorts.

So even though people may have found it gross or disgusting, I totally used the knife that kid had to gut his stomach open. What I found wasn't anything of the sort, I didn't notice any out of place organs or anything that looks like it shouldn't belong.

Except, I have some bad news. These things have an abnormal healing ability, and seem almost invincible.

Believe me I tried, that stuff just heals right back up after a minute, and honestly, surprised I was able to knock the kid out in the first place. And the knife I got wouldn't be able to penetrate the skull, not that it would do anything. Since a .17 HMR round right through the head didn't do jack shit.

So instead, I tied the kid up. I had some zip ties laying around. Plus when I'm done questioning the runt, I'm definitely gonna try burning this whole place down with the thing still inside.

There's also a detail I neglected to mention earlier. The eyes these things have are strange. No it isn't pitch black, or completely white, they all have heterochromia I believe it's called.

Specifically, left eye teal, right eye purple. I thought it wasn't important, but maybe it's supposed to mean something or has a purpose.

Anyways, kid woke up, and I gave a little wave.

"Good morning, Cody, now listen to me and answer everything I say, or imma do something real bad," I start to twirl the knife I had in my hand, but he didn't look frightened, not at all. 

"Try it, do it, we haven't been able to feel much pain for a while now," the thing said with a cocky tone, "Be our guest Mr. Alvarez."

I, at first, was surprised it knew my last name. But I realised if this thing isn't human, it probably would know everyone's last name somehow.

Oh well, it's asking for it. So I grabbed the hatchet I left near the corner of the room. Originally it was just for wood, but I had other plans.

My head turns to Cody, "Lets play a mini game, Cody," I approach him and slam the hatches head in a nearby wooden table, "You tell me everything you know, and if you do, I won't burn you alive," I grew a bit worried of the fact that once again, it didn't look phased.

"However, if you don't, I will burn you alive, how about it?" I had a confident tone, except the kid just smiled.

Cody tilted his head, "You really think I'll tell you shit? Didn't you do some Grey's Anatomy type shit earlier and realise you couldn't hurt us," the thing chuckled to himself, "You are stupid, Alvarez, really stupid."

Is that supposed to mean something? I didn't find anything out of the ordinary, it was just all supposed to be normal. Unless, that's what it's supposed to look, normal.

I sigh and grab a nearby gasoline can, "Was planning on burning this whole shack down after a week or so, but this should be good," I unscrewed the cap and threw it onto its side to let the gas pour out.

Afterwards, I grabbed my rifle and walked out, leaving the shack door wide open.

And then I just shot the gas, leaving the shack and Cody to burn. I cocked the gun and a bullet flew out. I only had two bullets left, because I was cocky enough to believe I could get them all easily.

Promptly, I ran, yet I forgot something. My compass. Since it was dark out, I couldn't tell where I was going. Plus the fact that my hideout place was built in the middle of nowhere.

When I reached a field, I thought I was finally back in civilization. Gone from that shitty family finally. But a crunch of a branch from behind caught me off guard. I swung over and aimed my rifle.

A familiar face stood in front of me. It was Cody, wielding a hatchet, the same one I left in the table.

"Like I said l, you are really stupid, Alvarez," I was definitely terrified, even fire couldn't kill these things. It just wouldn't die.

Immediately, I tried to flee again, and I heard a whooshing noise. Instinctively, I moved out of the way and a hatchet flew by my head.

Holy shit, I definitely was counting my lucky stars for that one.

Even though it was a bad idea, I had to ask a nearby house for help. My excuse would simply be I'm a hunter for the excuse of my gear.

When I got to a house I was exhausted as shit, and just started banging on the door. When it was opened, I didn't care who it was, I just went in and closed the door behind me and locked it. I was still facing the door at this time bracing it.

"Woah, buddy, what's the issue here, and what's with the gun, get out!" A gruff, masculine voice said from behind.

I spoke, "Sorry, I was in the forest out near the field hunting, and a bear was chasing me," Not really a good lie, but it was the best I could come up with.

When I turned around and continued to brace it, I looked on with horror.

This man had two distinctively different eyes, left eye teal, right eye purple.

*"Geez! Then feel free to stay a while! Also what's with the look? Is something wrong, sir?"*
