It was a Tuesday, but only because the dog said so.

I wouldn’t have known otherwise. The sky hadn’t changed in weeks, stuck in a dull, sunburnt haze, like the world had been left in the oven too long and someone had forgotten the timer. Clocks still worked, but time didn’t mean shit anymore. Days slurred together like a drunk at last call. It was easier to let the dog keep track.

I glanced down. “You sure?”

The dog trotted beside me, tongue lolling, tail flicking. He looked like any other stray—short blonde fur, a little too thin, eyes way too intelligent for something that still ate its own puke.

He nodded. “It’s Tuesday, dumbass.”

“Fair enough.”

I kept walking.

We were in a city, or at least the corpse of one. The buildings still stood, but not in any way that suggested they wanted to. It was like they’d given up, slouching against each other, hollowed out and waiting for something to finish the job. Cars sat abandoned in the streets, rusting and half-melted, like someone had parked them in a microwave and hit ‘popcorn.’ The wind pushed scraps of paper along the asphalt, whispering secrets to no one.

I was looking for water. Again.

The dog padded ahead, sniffing at the air.

“You smell anything useful?” I asked.

“I smell rot. I smell rust. I smell your shitty attitude.”

“So, nothing useful.”

“Not yet.”

I sighed and adjusted my bag. It was lighter than I wanted it to be. The last water bottle was half full. Maybe less. But optimism was important.

Something groaned in the distance. A low, warped sound, like metal being twisted apart.

I tensed. “That normal?”

The dog flicked an ear. “Define normal.”

“Normal as in, do I need to start running?”

“Mmm.” The dog sat down, scratched behind one ear with his back leg. “Not yet.”

The wind shifted. The buildings leaned, just a little. A ripple passed through the concrete, like the whole city had just woken up from a bad dream.

I froze. “The fuck was that?”

The dog sighed. “It’s waking up.”

I turned to him. “What is?”

The buildings groaned again.

The pavement under my feet felt softer. Like whatever was beneath it had started breathing.

My stomach sank. “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me.”

The dog yawned. “Told you it was Tuesday.”

Then the city moved.

Not a quake. Not a collapse. A shift, like something stretching after a long nap. The streets rippled. Windows shattered. A distant tower lifted itself toward the sky, then twisted sideways, its glass skin warping like plastic held over an open flame.

I swore and took a step back. The asphalt squelched under my boot.

I looked at the dog. “Suggestions?”

He blinked up at me. “Yeah. Run.”

So I did.

And behind me, the city groaned again—longer this time, deeper, almost amused.

Like it had finally noticed I was there.

I ran. Not the kind of run where you pace yourself, keep your breath steady, conserve energy. No, this was pure, pants-shitting panic. The kind of sprint where logic takes a backseat to survival, and dignity is left on the curb, waving goodbye.

The city wasn’t just shifting now—it was unraveling. Buildings shrugged off chunks of themselves. Streetlights bent at stomach-churning angles. The pavement rippled in waves, as if the city itself was having a seizure.

The dog stayed ahead of me, because of course he did. Nothing ever seemed to rattle him.

“This way,” he barked, veering left down an alley.

I followed, skidding on loose gravel. The walls on either side of us groaned, stretching taller. The sky—what little of it I could see—had darkened, the hazy orange bruising into something more sinister. I didn’t look back. I could feel the city shifting behind me, feel the weight of it turning over, like some colossal thing deciding whether or not to roll out of bed and kill me.

Something slammed shut behind us. A street? A building? A giant, godless esophagus? Didn’t matter.

The dog took another sharp turn. The alley spat us out onto a street that looked…normal. No crumbling facades, no melting steel, just cracked pavement and empty sidewalks.

I skidded to a stop, chest heaving. “Did we—?”

The dog cut me off. “Not yet.”

The quiet was all wrong. Not the silence of emptiness, but the silence of something watching. Considering.

I wiped sweat from my forehead. “Where the hell are we going?”

The dog glanced at me, then at the horizon. “Away.”

“Helpful.”

He sat down, staring at something in the distance. I followed his gaze.

At the end of the street, the city wasn’t just shifting—it was standing up.

A jagged silhouette stretched toward the sky, a tangled mess of buildings and streets pulling together into something…human-shaped. A torso, an arm, a tilted head of steel and concrete, its hollow windows like staring eyes.

It wasn’t a city anymore. It was a thing. A thing waking up.

I swallowed hard. “That’s new.”

The dog sighed. “Not really.”

The ground trembled beneath us.

I took a step back. “We should go.”

The dog didn’t move. He just kept watching as the thing—whatever it was—kept piecing itself together, like a puzzle no one should’ve finished.

“Hey,” I said, nudging him with my boot. “You coming or not?”

He blinked up at me, his expression unreadable. Then he stood, shook out his fur, and trotted forward.

“Still Tuesday,” he muttered.

And the city—
