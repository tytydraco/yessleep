Most parents at some point will declare their child a genius. But I *knew* that my daughter, Emery, was smart. I had paid extra to make sure she would be. 



Emery's dad was the one who found the Program. Derrick raced across the house with his laptop to show me, believing he had found the solution to all of our problems. We were having trouble conceiving, and I was beginning to take it as a sign. Maybe instead of bringing life into a cruel world, we could be one of those child-free couples that throws a dart at a map and has heedless sex wherever it lands. But if Derrick felt strongly enough to suggest something this radical, I thought I owed it to him to listen.



The Program was supposed to wipe away all of the uncertainty of parenthood. Beyond removing the risk of hereditary disease, the first-of-its-kind experimental study would genetically tailor a child to our specifications. The kid could be destined to become a star athlete, a virtuosic pianist, or a voracious reader on a cellular level. In my most pro-baby moments, I used to imagine sharing my favorite novels with a little bookworm, the kind of kid I'd have to tear a paperback away from to come eat. Suddenly I could have that—with a money-back guarantee.



It seemed like a miracle at the time, but after what happened, that's not the word I'd use. Now, I wonder what would have happened if we had shut the laptop and laughed off the idea. Could we have been that happy couple? 



Would anyone have died?



We built our child like a custom couch online. They'd have my eyes, obviously. They needed Derrick's wild curls and his big, dumb teeth, the ones I always loved. We'd skip my side's penchant for anxiety and depression, and anything we could do to steer clear of his father's... situation would be a bonus. With every detail of them right there for me to read on a computer screen, it was like I already knew this baby. 



While I was pregnant, Derrick joked that I kept reviewing our takeout order. I would look over the collection of features we had chosen and imagine the person they'd combine to make, how the world may treat them. Would she have my doubts? My fears? Or could she be better?



But when Emery finally arrived, she brought clarity with her. The doctor held her up for me to see, and she ceased to be a hypothetical. My first thought was that she didn't look how I had expected. My eyes were hidden beneath her swollen lids, and Derrick's curls were still months away. But as she was laid on my chest, she was undeniable. 



Exactly as I hoped she would be. 



Emery's first breath marked the beginning of Phase Two. She was born on the same day as the fifteen other children of her experimental cohort. Eight girls and eight boys. Derrick and I opted not to choose a sex for Emery. We wanted to leave something of her up to chance, but the symmetry within the group made me wonder whether the matter had simply been taken out of our hands. 



What else was decided for us?



Once released from the hospital, all 16 families relocated to a small island community on Lake Michigan. There, the Program would provide us everything a young family could possibly need. We moved into an adorable two-bedroom house, situated along a tree-lined street with fifteen others, all identical to it. The homes were a short walk from a corner store that accepted the play money mailed to us every two weeks. And at the center of the neighborhood was a perfect one-room schoolhouse with red siding and a charming belltower straight out of *Little House*.



The highly controlled conditions of the experiment made for a pretty ideal place to raise a kid. No one was older or younger. They lived in the same sort of house and wore outfits composed from a standardized wardrobe. There was no mortgage to pay, so maybe their parents would argue less. Their isolation kept them away from "normal children," but I think all the parents agreed that *privilege* could be a lesson for down the road. For now, in our perfect village, the genetically engineered kids could just be kids.



The first years flew by in a haze of giddy wonder, and Emery proved my worries wrong every step of the way. She was extraordinary, reading at two and doing algebra by six. But beyond what she knew, each day revealed more of the person she was becoming. She loved school and the other kids. She was curious, sharp, and giggled with abandon. She adored her dad, but would always share a look with me whenever his antics veered too goofy. There was an ease to Emery's bright kindness that I knew had to come from growing up away from it all. 



She certainly didn't get it from us.



But every advantage came with a cost. Exposure to the outside world could compromise the integrity of the experiment, so no personal electronics were allowed on the island. The school library had books and films to borrow, but all of them were Program-approved and then voted on by the parents. Derrick would get itchy at the meetings and mutter about censorship and coddling. I didn't understand why it bothered him so much. We had basically done eugenics, but the library not having *Alien* was suddenly beyond the pale. 



We started arguing regularly for the first time in our relationship. Our situation was unusual, but the fights were mundane. (His complaints about the island being confining were selfish. I was ignoring his feelings.) The details of each disagreement would vary, but they all ended the same way: Emery brought us back together. We would be in the kitchen or wherever we believed to be out of earshot, and she would enter with a problem that needed solving. Sometimes it was homework due the next day. Others, it was her own question about the world and how it worked that required two adult minds to answer it, usually insufficiently. 



Not long after I noticed the pattern, I began to see through it. She'd ask me to define *lugubrious* when I had heard her use it in a sentence the week before. And the math problems that stumped her had previously been easily within her grasp. To me, it was clear she didn't really need us. She just wanted us to believe she did. And so did we. 



When I mentioned my suspicions to Derrick—that our six-year-old was manipulating us—he stared, waiting for me to hear the insanity in what I had said. 



Derrick returned to the mainland for the first time the week after Emery turned nine. Parents in the Program had always been allowed onto the boat that shuttled the scientists, teachers, and grocery store staff to and from the island, but we never made the trip. Emery was our life, and she was here. But his mother hadn't been feeling well. Emery immediately began a painting for her La La. I wondered if my husband would come back. 



He did. That time.



\*\*\*



The news of our separation was greeted by the other parents on the island like an invasive species. The Program's director, Dr. Kapp, called a meeting at the schoolhouse to discuss how we would introduce the 11-year-olds to the concept. It was my and Derrick's fault that they would have to find the words, and since I was the only one still there, I became the sole mascot of our failure. 



To be honest, I felt freed, even as the woman who invented divorce for a group of innocent kids. Derrick's departure meant I could stop being a disappointing wife and focus on what really mattered—being a disappointing mother. 



Emery only existed because we thought we could truly protect her. Those perfect genes were meant to inoculate her against the suffering of the average life. Of course, they didn’t. They couldn’t. In fact, her superior intellect just made her all the more aware of her pain. How I could ever apologize to her enough, I will never know.



But, miraculously, Emery never withdrew from me. Her grades didn't drop off. She didn't lash out. In fact, she seemed to be about the only one on the island who didn't believe I had pushed Derrick away.



It perplexed me. My Emery, the girl who worshiped her father and laughed at even his worst jokes, should have been devastated by his decision to leave us. Where was that fierce sense of fairness when something so patently unfair was happening to her? It wasn’t that I wanted her to hurt. I just couldn’t make sense of the missing equal and opposite reaction. Over dinner, I would pry, trying to find some blotch on her brave face, but nothing ever surfaced.



Thinking back on that time, though, it's clear that her plan was already in motion.



\*\*\*



I don't blame Officer Calvin for what happened. I understand why the other parents did, but I never thought that was fair. No one on the island could have imagined  consequences so tragic from a mistake so small.



He had been warned, though. As the neighborhood's primary security guard, Calvin was expected to follow the same rules we all were. The most relevant to him was his phone. It was supposed to stay in his car at the ferry station, but with a disabled son back on the mainland, that was probably too great a distance between him and the assurance that he was all right. 



When I heard that his cargo pocket had chimed with a new text while the kids filed into the schoolhouse, I worried he was going to be fired. A few of us spoke to Dr. Kapp in his defense. Calvin may have broken the rules, but we actually trusted him—a man with a gun—to protect our children.



The day it happened again, Emery returned from school reporting nothing out of the ordinary, the first of many lies. We had just sat down for dinner when the doorbell rang.



It was Mailman Dan. 



Dan was a member of Dr. Kapp's staff, a childhood psychologist with the additional responsibility of alerting parents of an emergency meeting. The postal costume had been his idea, to avoid raising any alarm. It never really worked. Even our freaky little island kids knew that mail wasn't delivered at night.



And I don't think his name was actually Dan.



I brought Emery to the house of a friend blessed with two present parents for an impromptu movie night, while I headed to the schoolhouse. Dr. Kapp was waiting for us when we got there. Kapp usually had a polished look, half scientist-half PR rep. But his harried expression that night suggested that we were joining this story in the middle of it.



Calvin's phone was missing. 



The uproar from the parents was instantaneous. *How could this happen?* *Why didn't we hear about this immediately?* Kapp explained: Calvin first suspected that he had misplaced it shortly after class started that morning, but because he couldn't confirm that he hadn't simply forgotten it in his car, he waited until evening to report it missing. There was an immediate search of the ferry and Calvin's patrol route, but nothing turned up. Because of the timing of the disappearance and Calvin's subsequent search of his house, the device was believed to be somewhere on the island, in the possession of someone smart enough to turn off the location settings.



Dr. Kapp never directly stated that one of the children had taken the phone and was now hiding it, but the parents reacted like he had. 



*You can't seriously think that Grayson stole it*. 

*Amity has never even seen a phone. How would she know to take it?* 

*Well, we haven't introduced the concept of theft to Jexen, so....* 



I sat there, listening to the other parents rule out their own children as suspects, staring at Emery's nametag on the desktop in front of me and hoping that she had stolen the phone. I hated myself for it, but at least then I would have the reaction I expected. Then I could see the crisis I was dealing with, rather than grasping at one in the dark.



Kapp begged for forgiveness and quiet. None of the children was being accused, but for the sake of the experiment, every room on the island would need to be searched. The "subjects" had such voracious minds and had been raised in such a highly regulated environment that an internet connection could behave like a spark onto kindling.



The room grew silent with consensus, and Kapp gave his instructions. We would all return to our homes, send the children to the schoolhouse, and search their rooms. We'd be thorough, though careful not to make the intrusion known and cause more trouble than we were already in. 



On my way out of the school, I checked the faces of the other parents. More were pale than red, no matter how unfamiliar Jexen was with the concept of theft. 



Emery always kept her room neat, something I was grateful for until I needed to ransack it. Everything she owned had a particular spot and needed to be replaced precisely once I looked under it. Her colored pencils were arrayed like the visible spectrum. The stack of drawings in her desk was tucked into the drawer's corner. Her bedsheets would have received a stern nod of approval from a drill sergeant. She would notice the intrusion, and it would have been for nothing. 



The phone wasn't there. 



The guilt I had felt wanting her to be the culprit returned. How could I have hoped for such a thing? How could I have believed it was possible? The perfect daughter had been handed to me on a silver Petri dish. Maybe it was time I acted like it.



Emery sensed something was wrong as soon as she appeared at the schoolhouse door. Her mouth shrank as much as her eyes widened, waiting for me to tell her what this was all about. 



I threw my arm around her and said it was all boring parent stuff. 



The lying she must have gotten from me.



\*\*\*



Small huddles and hushed conversations popped up across the neighborhood early the next morning. All of the parents had searched their kid's room. No one found the phone.



Every last one of them found *something*, though. Once we each had a chance to clear our child, someone would confess to an unexpected discovery. A bad grade on a test or a weapon made from a stick. Then another would offer up the same, saying that the search had confirmed a suspicion they had been harboring. 



But here's the thing about children genetically engineered to display intelligence: They're not stupid. Emery didn't mention finding her scrunchies out of their proper order, but she didn't have to. The invasion of her room must have been as obvious as the rest of the searches were. I stood with the other parents as we sent the kids off to class, watching them abandon their usual cliques to unite as one group outside.



The children were talking. 



\*\*\*



But they were *not* talking to the adults. The day after the phone's disappearance, not a single hand was raised in class. And when their teacher countered their silence with a pop quiz, they answered each question incorrectly with coordinated precision. 



The parents pushed through a new rule banning congregating outside the school before the bell. An order forcing kids to go straight home after class came next. Since there was no point trying to hide that the parents were looking for something, Dr. Kapp spoke with the children about the issue directly. He explained how the person who had taken the phone was actually quite selfish, allowing their classmates to be punished for something they did. 



From there, the protest migrated home. For an entire week, Emery, like the rest of the kids, would finish her homework promptly upon returning—getting every answer wrong—and complete whatever chores asked of her, but not once did she speak a word to me. Her resolve was strong. I could see in her eyes how much the collective action hurt her, probably because she could see how alone she had left me.



After a few days of stalemate, Dr. Kapp made the decision that would mark the beginning of the end. He sent the kids home, where they couldn't organize. Class would be disbanded until the phone was recovered. The news was devastating to Emery, who lived for school. I asked Kapp if there was any other option, something less extreme, but he stood firm. And the other parents backed him.



Kapp's plan ended up working. But the children's plan was better. 



Three days went by. Emery would wake up promptly and go about her day with the discipline of a productivity coach. I should have been at least a little proud. My fifth grader was not needing me at a college level. 



That night with Emery in bed, I was up, trying to read my Program-approved book, when the alarm began ringing. The sound itself was small, but the electronic chime was so foreign on the island that it blared. It was louder on the porch. Other parents appeared at their own doors, drawn by the siren song. The phone was somewhere outside.



A handful of us began chasing the sound, alternating between running and listening for another clue of its location. It seemed to be moving.



A gunshot cracked the night air in half.

 

I froze, sure that I had imagined it. But then the screaming started.



*He’s dead! Call 911!*



\*\*\*



Officer Calvin was catatonic when we found him by the ferry terminal. The gun was still smoking in his hand. 



We begged him to tell us what happened.



He had been running around like us, searching for the phone. The alarm drove him toward the water, toward the dock. Then he heard children screaming for help. 



Silhouetted by the dock lights, all he could see was a tall male figure, struggling with smaller ones. Calvin yelled for them to identify themself, but when the man in the shadow raised his arm, Calvin had no choice but to fire. 



Calvin ran at the attacker, then realized with horror: it was Dr. Kapp, clutching the phone to his bleeding chest. No children were in sight. 



The next morning, none of the kids admitted to leaving bed.



\*\*\*



The Program's board convened shortly after Kapp's death and decided to continue with the experiment. Their explanation to us cited the late doctor's memory and the significance of his life's work—rather than the millions they had already sunk into the island.



But something irreparable had broken in the neighborhood. A man was dead, and everyone felt in their gut that some—maybe all—of the children had played a role. But there was no proof. The recovered phone didn't offer any clues. Whoever had taken it erased the browser history and wiped away their fingerprints.



The parents stopped speaking with each other. None of us could rule out our own kid this time.



At home, Emery was as defiant as ever, and I stopped waking up with her. The first morning I stayed in bed, I heard her poke her head into my bedroom just far enough to make sure I was breathing, before heading off to school. She was fine without me, just like her dad.



At the corner store, I noticed that the vodka stocks were lower than usual, so if nothing else, I found my community in day-drunk absentia. 



Almost a week went by like that, with me haunting my home like the ghost of my former self—the one who was a mother. It was around noon one day when a knock on the door pulled me from bed. Mailman Dan had dropped by to say that the Program was aware of the issues with the utilities and that they'd be back up as soon as possible. When I told him that I hadn't noticed any problems, he seemed surprised, so I explained how comfortable my bed was and how depression typically worked. 



When he left, I saw that my alarm clock was blank. None of the lights turned on, and the toilet bowl was as dry as the tap. Teams of plumbers and electricians arrived on the ferry that afternoon and quickly discovered the issue. 



The word "sabotage" struck me as overdramatic until I was met with its literal definition. Sewage technicians found clogs throughout the system. Dozens of kitchen sponges had wormed their way into the pipes across the island. The power outage was harder to figure out, since the island's central grid never went down. The hunt for a failure point led the electricians to the family room lamps, all of which had corner store coins hidden beneath the lightbulbs, blowing the home breakers.



This was escalation.



The plumbing crew was still working to restore running water when Mailman Dan returned that night carrying word of an emergency meeting at the schoolhouse. All of the kids were to be sent to their rooms, and every parent was expected to attend. 



I found Emery at her desk, doing homework incorrectly and wearing all of the black clothing she owned. I asked if I could come in and sit down, imagining her breaking her silence just to deny me. But she nodded instead.



I told her the parents were meeting at the schoolhouse, probably to hash out what sort of punishment infrastructure sabotage merited, but I didn't feel like going. I admitted that I didn't really like the other parents. They seemed to be operating under the premise that they were owed an apology, rather than owing their kids an explanation. 

Emery listened, curious about whether I had a point to make. And I did my best to hide that I was only half-sure of what that point was. 



I told her how before I got pregnant, I was afraid because I couldn't control where the world would take her. But she had proven me wrong. Now I couldn't wait to see where she would take the world.



I made a quick exit after that, knowing that my pre-teen window of patience was about to expire. I told her that I loved her and asked that she not stay up too late. She blinked.



You might think an experimental program with enough funding to purchase an entire island wouldn't have skimped on building materials, but the thin walls were the only reason I heard the front door close late that night. In the hall, I found Emery's bedroom door ajar. Her diary was resting open in plain sight, on top of her bed, where she had wanted me to find it.



The entries recounted the story of the last two weeks in reverse. I flipped back to the day the phone went missing. In the course of a day, her writing changed from loosely connected quotidian observations to an exhaustive list of her online reading with detailed notes. 



Emery began poking around where you'd expect any kid to—looking up her favorite animals, books she wanted to read but couldn't, and the actor I knew she had a crush on. The plot thickened when she transcribed the definitions of "control group" and "civil disobedience" in the same afternoon. She moved briskly from there to Henry David Thoreau and Jean-Paul Sartre, the Wikipedia pages for the Battle of Algiers and the Troubles, and something called the "Simple Sabotage Field Manual," a declassified OSS guide from 1944 for living under fascist regimes. 



The most recent entry, under that day's date, recapped a YouTube video about piloting a ferry boat and the Google results for her father's name, which didn't turn up much. 



By the time I reached the porch, all of the children were gathered outside the schoolhouse. The ferry, which had brought the utility workers, loomed in the distance. The bags on the kids’ backs were heavy with what I imagined to be food and a change of clothes. They stood watching as Finleigh, the island's most artistically gifted child, finished scrawling a message in white paint across the red-paneled wall.



"BRED IN CAPTIVITY" 



When Finleigh was done, the 16 of them gathered in a tight circle, examining something at the middle of it. But soon, they were spread out again in a wide line to face the schoolhouse. 



It was Emery who stepped forward to break the ranks. 



I could see her clearly, even from the porch. The fire from the molotov cocktail in her hand cast a brilliant light upon her face. She was so much more than my eyes, her father's wild curls, and his big, dumb teeth. As she reached back behind her to throw the flaming bottle of corner store vodka onto the schoolhouse's roof, I saw my Emery with perfect clarity—fierce, full of conviction, and utterly fearless.



Exactly as I hoped she would be.



Emery saw me approaching and paused. A few of the children moved to get between me and her, but my daughter waved me through. 



When I reached her, I held out my hand, asking for the bottle, and she handed it over without a fight. I told her I was proud of her, that I was proud of all of them, and that this would work better with a head start. 



"Just promise to call me when you get there," I said.



She squeezed my hand and, with the other kids, ran off toward the ferry.



Then I threw the bottle onto the roof.
