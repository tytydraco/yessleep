I’m not even sure how to start this. I never thought I’d see that thing again.

In case you haven’t read my last post — I don’t believe in the supernatural. At least not until a skinwalker tried hijacking my car at a gas station.

The gate was closed for days, but no one said why. No missing airmen. No reports. Just silence.

I should tell you all what my job is. If anyone’s reading this.

I’m a signals analyst. Intel, to say the least. I don’t know any super secret scary government conspiracy, I’m only an E-4. I just needed to state this so the next part makes any sort of sense.

I work in a building where no phones, Bluetooth devices, or any sort of outside electronics are allowed. My shifts are ten hours long, and it gets boring real fast.

Another thing about the building I work at — it’s going through renovations. We moved from the 2nd floor to the basement for about a year. We recently moved back to the 2nd floor. However, a lot of things were left in the basement. Last I heard, nobody worked down there, so I have no idea why they didn’t just bring everything up.

The only printer, scanner, and paper shredders were left behind. Really inconvenient. This brings us to my next encounter with the so-called skinwalker.

I was nearing the end of my shift. There’s always two of us, since my job requires someone watching the computer at all times. I had printed some papers for a volunteering event I was running, and needed to fetch it from the printer in the basement.

That “creepy feeling” was sneaking up on me as I descended the stairs.

The lights were motion activated down there. As I opened the door, I could see the far light turn off.

It was quiet again. Dead silence, no sound to comfort my ears. It was deafening.

I told myself that it was just a coincidence and walked to the office room, which housed the only printer.

My heart rate was picking up with every step I took.

I grabbed my papers and went to leave, back where I came from. Looking down the hallway on the other side of the room wasn’t a good idea in hindsight.

Maybe I just wanted to confirm that there wasn’t anything. That I was freaking myself out. I really wish that was true.

I glanced down the hallway, which was still dark. I didn’t see anything at first, but the creepy feeling didn’t leave me. The more I stared down the darkness, the more I started to see a figure. A silhouette.

A silhouette that was much too tall.

I dropped my papers, but I couldn’t make myself move. I just stood there. I could’ve just left, told myself I was seeing things, and moved on. But I continued to stare.

Eventually (I wasn’t sure how long it had been), the light down the hallway automatically came on. It confirmed my worst fears.

There it was — that thing — standing far too tall. With a long thin neck and too long arms. The only thing different was the uniform… and maybe the skin. It was too far away to tell for sure.

Instead of rocking BDUs, the thing was sporting OCPs — the current uniform. If I could see any better, I’d be able to make out the squadron patch and see who’s skin it stole.

Training should kick in, right? Fight, flight, or freeze. But I froze. I just stared as it started swaying and moving forward, looking like a puppet a child was trying to move.

The closer it got, the more I noticed differences. It was the same thing, just… wearing different skin. And not very well.

The skin didn’t fit. It was stretched in odd places, almost to the point of ripping. The eye holes were loose, too big for the thing’s eyes. Like it had been pulled on in all directions. It was almost ten feet from the door when I finally made my legs move.

I stumbled to the door on the other side, trying to push it open. It was stuck. I could only hear my breath and my tinnitus at this point, giving up on the door pretty quick. If I couldn’t escape, I had to hide.

Being a 5’1 woman, I had some options. The kitchen was just through a doorway, and it had cabinets. Big cabinets and big fridges that were empty. The office room had spaces between the printer and scanner that I could cram into. I had options, but not time.

I darted into the kitchen. The light came on, which may have given away my location. I tried to ignore that fact, and opened a cabinet. I closed myself in just as I heard the door open.

The only sound I could hear was footsteps. Slow, clumsy. But deliberate. I held my breath. I didn’t move a muscle.

Again, I wasn’t sure how much time passed. But the light in the kitchen turned off automatically. I didn’t know if it was a trick, so I stayed put.

The light flicked back on a moment later. Footsteps approached again, and paused in front of my cabinet.

It’s hard to scare me enough to scream. But I screamed when the doors opened.

“Thompson! What the fuck!” My co-worker, Johnson, screamed back.

“Johnson! Holy shit!” I still didn’t move. I was shaking, my lip was quivering, and I was on the verge of tears.

“What the fuck are you doing in a cabinet? In the dark?” Johnson questioned.

“Hiding from the… uhm…” I took a breath, sniffling and wiping forming tears away. I couldn’t cry in front of a co-worker. He was a rank lower than me, too. And I was technically his stand in supervisor while his was out.

“You really don’t wanna know,” I said instead, crawling out of the cabinet as Johnson stepped aside. “How did you even know I was here?”

“You didn’t come back upstairs. The other shift is already here, so I came down to see what was up.” Johnson shrugged, and it was then that I noticed he had picked up the papers I had dropped earlier.

“Okay, yeah I uh.. get that. But how’d you know what cabinet I was in?” I asked curiously. I had chosen a random cabinet; I hadn’t thought it was obvious.

“Did you not notice the dust?” Johnson raised an eyebrow, gesturing to the ground. I looked down and saw what he meant. The whole kitchen floor was covered in a layer of dust.

I glanced over at the entrance, the doorway where the office room met the kitchen. There were only two footprints in the dust, mine and Johnson’s.

I thought I was going crazy for a minute. I could’ve sworn that thing had come to get me.

Johnson saw it first.

“What the fuck?” He mumbled under his breath as he carefully walked over, squatting down to get a better look at the floor right by the doorway.

I followed him, following his gaze to see what he was looking at.

Sure enough, there was a singular footprint that didn’t belong to either of us. It was a big boot print — but toes extended past the edge, like the foot inside was too large.

“It followed me,” I whispered before I could think. “It followed me and we need to leave.” I grabbed Johnson by the sleeve and pulled him up, striding over to the door and shoving it open.

“What are you talking about? Tom what are you talking about?” Johnson demanded as I pulled him to the staircase and started walking up.

I didn’t know what to tell him. Where to start. I didn’t have to decide, because as we hit the first floor landing, the door to the staircase opened. We both paused. Loud, echoing footsteps filled the staircase. It stopped after a couple of seconds. Then a pale, skin-wearing face peeked from around the corner.

This time it was Johnson that grabbed my arm and pulled me along, leaving the staircase in a rush. We didn’t talk as we ran through several doors, two of which could only be opened with our badges.

I didn’t argue or put up a fight when Johnson got into the passenger seat of my car. I did check the backseats before getting in myself, though.

I turned on the car, locking the door as I turned the heat up.

We watched the gated area in silence. Nothing went into the building. And nothing came out.

“How did it get in?” Johnson finally asked. It was a good question.

“Animals get in all the time. We had a porcupine take up residence for a while. Named him McQuilliam.” I muttered, mostly in disbelief. How had it found me?

“Okaaayyy but a porcupine is like, this big.” Johnson said slowly, gesturing how big a porcupine was with his hands.

“Good point. Some bears got in a couple years ago. The guards aren’t that observant.” I didn’t want to say what I was thinking — that maybe the guards already knew. There’s no way they didn’t.

“… Are you gonna tell me what exactly that thing was?” Johnson asked. I could tell he was just as freaked out as I was, but he was doing his best to hide it.

“I don’t know. Skinwalker, maybe? The first time I saw it, it had BDUs. And was wearing different skin.” I explained, taking a deep breath.

“BDUs? The really old uniform?” Johnson asked in surprise. “That thing was wearing OCPs — and different skin? Does that mean it killed someone? Like, recently? Why does it want to kill us?”

“If I knew, I would tell you.” I almost interrupted Johnson, feeling a little frustrated. I felt bad, I knew I would’ve had the same questions. But I didn’t know and it was killing me.

“Wait waitwait — you said, ‘last time’. You saw it before?” Johnson recalled.

I went on to explain my first encounter, not looking at my co-worker as I spoke. My eyes were focused on the door to the building.

“Wow. I don’t… even know what to say. That explains why the gate has been closed.” Johnson said quietly, leaning back in the seat.

We sat in silence for a little while longer.

“We should uh… get out of here.” Johnson seemed to say the obvious. But he made no move to get out of my car. I didn’t ask him to leave, either.

We both jumped when my phone started ringing. It was connected to my car, and the Bluetooth had been turned up rather high.

It was Zack, my boyfriend. I pressed the answer button.

“Rose! Thank God —“ Zack rarely called me by first name, so I knew he had been seriously worried. “Where are you? I thought that — that thing might’ve found you.”

“Funny story,” I started, trying to ignore the waiver in my voice. “It did. It was in the building. Johnson saw it too, he’s in the car with me.”

“No — seriously? How’d it get over the fence?” Zack seemed to answer his own question in his head as he spoke. He had worked in the building longer than I had.

“Okay, okay that was a stupid question. But you got out of there, right? Obviously, you’re talking to me.” Zack seemed to be answering his own questions a lot. “Are you okay? Is Johnson okay?”

“We’re okay. I had to hide in a cabinet in the basement, but I’m okay.” I assured with a weak smile. “Johnson probably saved my skin. Literally.”

“All I did was walk into the basement. You’re the one who got us moving to begin with.” Johnson said dismissively, but he seemed to be blushing.

“Either way, I’m glad you guys are alright.” Zack seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. “You should tell the guards at the ECP… you know, just in case.”

I looked at Johnson, and he nodded. That might save a couple of people in the building.

“I’ll do that — I’ll be home soon, babe.” I said, glancing out the windshield and windows just to make sure nothing was lurking outside.

“Stay safe. I love you.” Zack said, still sounding a little anxious.

“Love you too. Bye.” I hung up and took a breath, double checking the mirrors and windows. I really didn’t want to get out of the car.

“… I can tell them,” Johnson offered after a second. “I have to get to my car anyway.”

The idea was tempting, but I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if anything happened.

“We can both go. Maybe they’ll believe us if we both vouch for each other.” I pointed out. After triple checking that there wasn’t anything lurking outside, we left the car.

We made it to the ECP with no issue, and went to the window. The guards were behind a bank teller type thing, and I wondered what exactly it was protecting them from. Terrorists or skinwalkers?

They looked at me expectantly once I walked up. Johnson made no move to talk, so I spoke up.

“There’s a uh… Thing. In the building,” I realize I could’ve articulated my words better. “I mean, like a skinwalker.”

The guards stared at me for a second before realization dawned on them.

“Don’t tell anyone. We have it handled.” One of them said.

I nodded and walked away with Johnson, not wanting to linger any longer. They said they had it handled. What was I going to do?

“I guess that’s done with. Uh, be safe? Tell me if you find anything out.” Johnson commented as we walked back to the parking lot.

“I will. See you tomorrow, man.” I promised as I checked the back seats of my car. I climbed in after verifying there wasn’t anything there, and watched Johnson walk to his car. I didn’t leave until he did.

I got home with no incident. Sounds seemed to return, I felt like I could breathe again.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about what happened. The thing got through several levels of security. I thought my work building was the one place I could feel safe and I was proven wrong.

The guards had been too calm about it.

There was one question that I really wanted the answer to.

*What did they know?*
