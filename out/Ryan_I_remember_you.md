I remember. Maybe not everything but most of it. I remember the balls, where we met. I remember us dancing and you teaching me in a small room off to the side. I remember your class mates clambering to peek in at the door. I remember you shooing them away. I remember standing and waiting for the men to come and line up for the dance. And how I stepped away and caused an entire scene. I remember not going back after that. I remember you showing up at my parents place years later. I remember you taking me to your house. It’s a little spotty at this point some stuff I remember some is foggy and I’m not sure if it’s me trying to fill the holes or just what happened.

 And finally I remember you showing up at the coffee shop. You said you had been looking for me for a long time. I was such a fool not to go with you. I’m so sorry I caused so much of a problem. I was so out of it. None of what happened there at that time felt real. I can’t believe you built that house for me. I saw it for sale and that’s when it started to spark memories. 

Of you, most of it finally came back when I saw you at cedar point. Please let me find you again? Please let me talk to you. Please let this message reach you. I don’t know what else to do. How to get a hold of you. I remember and like I said I would I miss you. I don’t know why but my heart calls to you. I don’t know how to make it stop. I honestly shouldn’t even be writing this. But I said I would try to reach out. So please if you get this if you see this try to get to me. I

 was going to post this in no sleep but I’m short around 170 words at this point. I may just put it in as many subs as I possibly can. I need to find you. I don’t know why. I don’t know what it will accomplish. I don’t even know what I will say to you. I just. Need to. Maybe I shouldn’t. I should leave you to live your life. I just hope you are happy. I love you.  I’m sorry. 
  sorry the rest is just going to be just 

gibberish.  
The Cotten eye never was and never will be Burt chuck told me that and I will never forget it. This all started when my father introduced me to a man with a box. The box was not ready yet and he wanted me to help him make the box better. So they put the box on my head and made me scream. I was good at screaming I could scream really loudly. So at the top of my lungs I screamed. And they took the box off and he said he had to work on it more.
