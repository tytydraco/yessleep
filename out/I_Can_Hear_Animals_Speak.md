I started hearing the voices after my car accident. Lying in the hospital with my arms in casts, I remember waking up to a faint whisper- 

*connectthedotshavetobuildhavetocatch* 

\-and yet I was alone in the room.

At first I assumed I was delirious from the crash- it had been a head-on collision with a deer, and later a telephone pole, after all. But the small voice continued, on and off, for most of that first day. A nurse came in to feed me that evening, a look of pity on her face reserved only for sick children and broken adults. When I asked her about the voice she told me some delirium was normal considering all i’d been through, as she brushed a spider web from the ceiling. 

Why had the voice in my head begun to scream?

The day they discharged me from the hospital was when I discovered the source of the voices. Just outside the exit, an elderly woman was walking past with a tiny dog being practically dragged behind her.

I looked around in disbelief. There was no way in hell I was awake. *This must all be some crazy post-crash nightmare*, I thought to myself. 

But it wasn’t.

The walk home was long and unbearable as I tried not to look like I was having a nervous breakdown. I could hear moans from the trash cans in the alleyways. I was taunted from the sky, and worst of all I could hear agonized cries from underneath my feet. At one point a particularly pleading voice was taking up most of the space in my head, and I stopped at a bench, bent over in agony. It was then that I noticed the thick black and orange caterpillar semi attached to my shoe. It had an obliterated back half, and its front half writhed in agony as guts spilled out of its mouth. 

*pleasehelpithurtsohfuckithurtsmommyithurtsplease*

I slowly grabbed a stick off of the ground and scraped the bug from my shoe, as the screams grew louder. I closed my eyes, lowered my foot, and for a moment, my head was quieter.

Back at my apartment, I isolated myself for the first few days, ordering groceries and mostly staying in bed. Luckily, work had given me a month of leave because of my injury, and I had a decent amount of savings. The voices were quieter inside, with only faint jeers and whispers trickling out from under my furniture. The only truly traumatic experience from that period was when I accidentally turned on the bathtub while a cockroach was inside, and it was sucked down the drain. The voices from under the fridge had murderous tones that night.

After a week of isolation I made an appointment with my family doctor and opted to take my bike so I could limit the amount of time I spent outdoors. On my way to the hospital, I heard a chorus of pleading voices that rose above all the other murmurs and mundane conversations and grew closer by the minute. As I rounded a corner, they became deafening. That was when I saw the faded yellow truck. It was one of those two story ones, with the metal air holes dotting its sides.

*dontwannadieitsokhoneystayclosetomeimscaredhelpmehelpmehelpme*

At the time I could have sworn that one of the pigs inside had looked directly at me. I was suddenly overcome by an overwhelming urge to follow this truck to its destination. 

As we slowly neared the outskirts of town, I noticed that the voices in my head were softer, and happier. Squirrels teased each other playfully, and birds sang beautiful serenades from trees and electrical wires. Yet, in the near distance, the pigs continued to scream.

After almost half an hour of biking I began to hear a distant rumble of voices, like a thousand screams stacked one on top of the other, fighting to be heard. The air had begun to smell slightly metallic, and that was when I saw the slaughterhouse. It was a looming, drab building, made almost entirely of concrete, with two large smoke stacks puffing out black, acrid smoke. I dropped my bike and crept to the edge of the large fence that surrounded the entire complex. The truck was being unloaded, and the workers shoved and hit their cargo.

*whyareyouhurtingmewherearewepleasestop*

I could not go any closer. The noises trickling from the few small windows were straight from hell, screams so primal that I felt as though my head would explode. I vomited in a nearby ditch and drunkenly made my way home, my legs like lead weights.

I stopped eating meat after that, and was once again staying in my apartment for long stretches. I ignored calls from my doctor, and extended my leave from work. Summer had arrived in full force and its heat was intense, so I began sleeping with the window slightly open, in spite of the many noises that tended to drift in. This was when I started hearing screams from down the street.

I tried ignoring them, only opening the window when entirely necessary. But finally, after much suffering, I decided one night to investigate them. 

I found out that the screams were coming from the basement of a small bungalow a few houses down from me. It was outdated, with peeling paint and smudged windows. There was a blocky pickup truck in the driveway full of foul-smelling garbage bags and long uncut grass. Trying to look as inconspicuous as possible, I walked over to the basement window, but it had been covered with a thick sheet.

Just then, I heard a small, pained yelp come from one of the dozens of bags in the truck bed. I ran over, tore open the closest one to me, and my heart caught in my throat. I was confronted by dozens of rodents, kittens, and puppies, in various states of decomposition. I began gently searching through them to find the source of the noise but it had gone silent. 

The screams from the basement seemed to be reaching some morbid crescendo and due to my lack of sleep, my borderline psychosis, and an internal rage that had been building for weeks, I broke down the door to the basement. What I saw will never leave my mind.

The basement smelled like piss, shit, and blood. Heavy metal was blasting through some ratty speakers on a workbench that was covered with blunt or sharp objects.. There were around a dozen pet store boxes packed full of mice, hamsters, and other small rodents, panicked and screaming. Beside these, were a few cages full of yelping puppies and kittens.

There were two large tables, almost like kitchen cutting blocks, covered in corpses and small limbs. Hooks dangled from the ceiling haphazardly with different animals attached to them, twitching as they bled onto the floor. A wiry man who had been bent over a large tub had turned to face me and in his hands I saw two waterlogged and gasping puppies. 

The next few moments were a blur, but what I do remember is his mutilated body and some morbid feeling of satisfaction once he’d stopped moving.. After emptying the truck bed, I placed all of the boxes and cages of living animals inside, and covered them with a tarp. In the front seat, I put the two puppies wrapped in a towel.

After moving the garbage bags to the basement, I doused everything with a jerry can of gasoline and started a fire. Those small animals didn’t deserve to be thrown away like trash, to sit and rot in an evil man’s basement. On my way out of town, I left the cages and boxes at the door of an animal shelter, but kept the puppies with me. 

And now, as I write this, I'm headed north, with only loving voices and birdsong in my head.
