As I'm writing this, I'm currently hiding. Let's rewind back to the beginning. 

I'm any normal kid, goes to school, comes back, plays videogames, and goes to sleep. I got into a fight with a kid in school, so my mom grounded me. "Bullshit.." I said under my breath, as I didn't start the fight. "What was that?" My mom said in that one obnoxious voice mom's do when they're annoyed.
"Nothing" "that's what I thought." I walked in my room, to see my console was gone. "Not surprising..." but something was different, there was a painting of a...creature?? I don't know what it is, but that doesn't matter. I walked over, and stared at it. Confused, I yelled "Hey mom, when did you get this weird painting?" "What painting?" Even more confused, I took it down and put it in my closet.

 For the rest of the day, I heard weird noises. They sounded like raspy faded groans..after I had dinner, I walked upstairs and used the bathroom. But before I opened the bathroom door, I saw a pair of Glowing dots in the darkness of my room. "Weird.." I said opening the bathroom door.I went in my room, and fell asleep.

 A few hours later I woke up, but something felt off...as I glanced around my room, my gaze fell on my closet. There was the same two glowing dots I saw that night. I thought I saw a hand, but brushed it off. I put my blanket over my head, I'm a very easily scared kid but it died down a bit as the Years went on, but this made me do that. I went back to sleep, but woke up again. My gaze went to my closet to see if the "dots" were still there. Instead of the dots, the creature from the painting was just sitting there. Staring at me. I screamed, but no sound came out. I looked away for a second, and I heard bones crackling. I instantly looked back. It was closer, but this time it was smiling.

 It. Was. Smiling. It's yellow teeth, that looked like it chewed on thousands of rocks. As I stared at it, it moved a bit. Trying to point, trying to get me to look away. I did. But I heard the bones, and turned. It was now on the end of my bed. It's smile even bigger than before. This time, I screamed and it actually came out. It's smile turned into a frown and it crawled back into my closet. My mom came in. "What happened?! Are you okay?" I was to Terrified to speak, I just pointed at my closet. My mom opened it, nothing was there. Nothing but that painting. That damned painting. My eyes widened even further. My mom sighed and just left the room. It took me about an hour to fall back asleep. I woke up, and instantly opened the closet, took the painting, and threw it in the trash.
I went to school, and went back home. 

I went inside, only to find the painting on my couch, and my mom cooking dinner. I grabbed the painting and stared at it. I threw it out the door. After we had dinner, I went to bed. I woke up and felt off. But this time, I didn't see glowing dots in my closet. I saw the creature, with bloodlust in its eyes, outside my window. It started banging its head into my window, making it Crack. Terrified, I ran downstairs and hid. I heard a shatter. As I heard my dad "I GOT A GUN AND IM NOT AFRAID TO SHOOT!" Shortly after, I heard his blood curdling scream, not long after that my mother's. I heard it's bone crackling, it's looking everywhere for me. It's getting closer, I have some advice for anyone who experiences the Same thing

.....Don't throw out the painting, and DONT. LOOK. AWAY.
