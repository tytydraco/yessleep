Nobody on earth needs to see The Mire Drip, wasn’t even like we was asking for it. Reminiscing now sends a shiver down my spine. Just thinking bout that thing—it gets the scars on my chest crawling. 

Even still, it gets stuck in your head. Pheromones, something like that. Every time you gaze into its swamp, no matter who you are, you can’t help but feel the clammy air against your skin and that pungent odor: rotting vegetation, stagnant water and moldy vanilla that never truly leaves your nostrils. You have to ask about the thing no one wants to talk about, like an itch needing to be scratched.

I was out with Harley on that day. I still remember how beautiful she looked to me, with her auburn pigtails swaying side-to-side and her big ol freckled grin. My boy Finch was there too, blonde cowlick in tow, the both of us competing for whatever smiles and winks we could get out of Harley. She got on about the government covering up mothman, which turned into talking about bigfoot, which of course devolved into a conversation about the Mire Drip. 

Back in the day, I didn't care what we were talking about as long as it was Harley’s sweet voice. The girl made my heart sing songs. When she said she wanted to go, I couldn't say no. It was right in the middle of our sophomore summer break, and I had promised myself that before the end of it, I’d take her out to the swamps to dance with the fireflies and kiss her. This was another stepping stone to reach that goal, ya see?

Our venture into the swamp wasn’t anything special. Humid air clinging to our skin, and the dampness seeping into us, making our clothes all heavy. Croaking frogs, chirping birds, and the constant rustling. 

When I was young, I grew to love the scent of it. Ancient vegetation, and stagnant water, its own ecosystem. You got to know it. But what old Finchy did that day to try and impress Harley. Well, what he did ruined all that.

You see, Finch walked up that old swamp road like he owned the place and tossed down a rabbit he had killed with his pa that morning. The way he stood over the dead skinned thing with his hands on his hips made my stomach churn. 

“Come on out,” he drawled. “Suppers up Mr. Mire Drip. Where you at?”

I remember Finch that morning had planned to cook the rabbit for breakfast, but instead made a joke about some blood being all he needed to bring out the demon. 

My heart pounded in my chest, and a cold sweat broke out on my skin. The air’s thickness became oppressive, every breath heavy with the scent of decay. My fingers started tingling and a sack of potatoes fell into the pit of my stomach. 

He shouldn’t have made a joke like that.

I remember me and Harley backing away from him, I forced a smile as our feet made sucking noises in the mud. 

Then, my chest caught fire, not literally, but beneath my skin. Like the worst damn infection possible. I ripped my shirt off and Harley’s pink lips opened wide as she screamed.

A blister had swelled upright in the center of my chest. A big, nasty son of a bitch, big as a fist. I poked it just once, and it burst like a damn firecracker. The liquid inside sprayed a metallic gunk, like what’s in a thermometer and blood poured all over me. My skin burned worse than any fire, it was like molten earth, like hot lava.

Then the stink hit me. The fumes were sulfuric and mixed with the repulsive stench of sweet and vanilla, so rank it made me gag.. 

Despite it being early noon, the whole swamp changed, bathed in a pale muave smoke. All the frogs and bugs fell silent, leaving an eerie quiet that only amplified my dread. My skin started prickling, my heart boomed like a bass drum in my chest. 

Finch got the second blister, a baseball-sized mother right above his eye. It swelled grotesquely, a shiny, reddish violet mound, before finally bursting and oozing out that thick metal oil. 

He screamed, clutching his face and cursing himself for being dumb as hell. Desperate, he scurried back to the rabbit, I dunno, he was probably convinced that retrieving his offering might set things right.

The sudden downpour had already raised the swamp's water level, and the skinned rabbit was now halfway submerged in the murky, fetid waters. The stench of rot and vanilla hung in the air. Finch's fingers trembled as he reached down to pick up the rodent, the cold, slimy water splashing against his skin. Just as his fingers brushed the rabbit's fur, my instincts screamed into my limbs. 

The weight of the gas made every breath thick and heavy. My knees were gibbering, begging me to buckle and run, but I was unable to tear my eyes away.

The Mire Drip emerged from the swamp. It was made of liquid algae and shimmering mercury-like oil, the stuff that’s in thermometers, and covered in clusters of mauve colored milkweed. It boasted a large luminescent eye, like the search beam of a lighthouse, and a gaping, blood-red mouth.

The metal ooze dripped onto Finch as he screamed, completely enveloping him in those bursting boils. They erupted in rapid succession, detonating with such force it seemed as if someone were lighting him up with a machine gun. Finch collapsed, and the Mire Drip pressed its suction cup mouth into his guts, sucking up what had spilled out of him with a high-pitched, consistent roar.

Watching my best friend being consumed stabbed at my heartstring. But when Harley stumbled in after him, my heart was ripped right outta me. I suppose she answered our question about which one of us she liked more.

She stopped halfway to Finch and found herself caught in the Mire Drip's spotlight gaze. The gasses had an adverse and sudden effect on me. Everything started to blur and shake. For a moment, it seemed like Harley had three heads. A fluid leaked from her ear, same as the silver mercury that made up the Mire Drip, and then she collapsed onto her side, and the horror slid onto her.

Damn right I took off. That mauve, noxious, vanilla swamp gas engulfed everything, made you hallucinate something awful. I saw bats swooping and giant death head moths fluttering on my way out. But I kept pushing. 

Years later and it still hasn’t gone away entirely. I still get the delusional bat beast fluttering in the corner of my eye, waking me up at night.

Of course, no one believes my story except those who already know bout The Mire Drip. Lawman still tries to squeeze information out of me, about FInch and Harley. He got real uppity when some fancy suit folks came asking me questions. But I just play dumb, don’t answer too many, don’t stir up no more trouble than I already have. Anyone living in the swamp knows better. If you knows, then you already understands those are the Mire Drip’s [swamps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTQMLpVO8nA)
