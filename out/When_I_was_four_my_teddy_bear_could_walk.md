An experience happened last night and it’s awakened something from my childhood and I feel like it’s worth sharing.

When I was really young, like as in under the age of 6- I lived in this big Victorian house. It always had problems with the pipes so my parents eventually moved us out of it.. but while we lived in it, little me had a nice bedroom with my teddies, wardrobe, bed and even an en suite.

The mini desk opposite my bed is where my teddies all were and the en suite was situated beside it. The way everything was angle was that I would face my teddies when sleeping and be able to look into the bathroom mirror at the same time. I used to be scared of my en suite because my parents would leave its door open and naturally 4 yr old me would hate seeing the ajar door into the dark room. The mirror was also slightly lit because I had good natural lighting during night, thanks to a window outside of the bathroom so the mirror was the only visible thing.

Well, one night I had a nightmare. Something about zombies or whatever- and as my eyes flutter open though, I look towards my teddy in the middle, a nice cream and pink one.. when suddenly it begins to stand up. It climbs down off the mini-desk and starts to waddle towards me with its little stitched mouth grinning at me. The beady brown eyes glinting from the light from my window.

It feels like an eternity. It’s about 30cm away when I think, “you need to blink. Make sure you can move”. So I do.
The cream teddy is back, seated on the mini desk. It keeps its horrible smile though.

This process repeats over and over for a number of months, sometimes there’s also something .. dark in the mirror, before I beg my mum to let me move to the guest room, she’s confused because I originally loved my room but now I can’t stand to sleep in it. I do move though, and I ask my mum if I can keep the teddies somewhere else than in my room, she obliged and the nightly terror stops with the cream teddy no longer watching me as I sleep, plus the dark mass I saw in the mirror stops too.

Well recently I was sorting out stuff in my attic and I found the bin bag with cream teddy in it and I decide, “oh I loved this teddy! I’ll keep this in my room on my shelf.”

I’ve never regretted it more. The teddy came towards me just how it used to, only now… it was less than 5 cm away from my nose, glaring into my eyes. 

Oh and the dark mass? It was peering at me from the corner of the room.  It has eyes now. It’s the morning after and I didn’t sleep, even when I blinked the creature was still there and the bear.. it still lingered in front of me.

As I write this, I’m plotting how to get rid of the thing. But honestly I might just throw it back in the attic, or burn it. Just so weirded out..
