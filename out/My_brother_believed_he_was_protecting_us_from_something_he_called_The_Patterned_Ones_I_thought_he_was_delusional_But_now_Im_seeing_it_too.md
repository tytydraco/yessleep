My brother didn’t believe he was God. Not exactly.

But he believed he could see what no one else could—that the rest of us were too distracted or conditioned or blind.

It started with harmless patterns. Coincidences, he said. Only they weren’t.

And when we lost him, it wasn’t like he died. It was more like he… evaporated.

Or maybe, like a virus, he just moved on to a new host.

⸻

Dan wasn’t always like this.

He used to be the kind of person who lit up a room—the favorite kid, the class clown, the ball of energy that made family dinners feel like a stage show.

After high school, most of his friends went off to college. Dan stayed behind. He said he needed time to figure things out, but what he really meant was that he didn’t know who he was without an audience. And when the spotlight vanished, he started to create one of his own.

He’d tell us about a new job, how well things were going. But the stories never quite lined up. Different job titles. Made-up coworkers. He just wanted to seem like his life was full—like it mattered.

⸻

It didn’t start with anything big. No voices. No threats. Just… patterns.

He said he kept seeing the same car. A rust-colored SUV. Then again outside the store. Again at the gas station. He started writing down license plates.

Then it was too many red cars in a block. Too many silver sedans in one parking lot.

He spent hours with the radio on, scanning between stations like a codebreaker. He’d only stop for a second—just long enough to catch a phrase or half a sentence.

“They’re stitching it together,” he told me once. “One station starts the sentence, the next one finishes it.”

He believed someone—or something—was trying to reach him through the gaps. Through the noise.

⸻

We kept telling ourselves it would pass. That if we forced it, we’d only make it worse.

Then Dan showed up at our house out of nowhere. Hair greasy, sleeves torn, eyes twitching in every direction. He wouldn’t sit. Wouldn’t eat.

Then he snapped his head toward me and said, “You told them.”

“What?”

“You showed them where I live.”

“Dan—”

“Don’t lie to me.” He was breathing fast. “The file with the address metadata. In the temp folder. You think I don’t check the temp folder?”

My dad stepped in between us. Like he was shielding me from a dog.

Dan’s lips twitched. “They’re using you now. You. Her. The routers were just the start. The light pulses. The searches—”

He turned on our mom.

“You used the search engine. They feed on that.”

He didn’t yell. He barked. Spit out words in fast, tumbling loops. “I blocked it—I blacked it out—I blacked it out—”

Then he screamed.

At the ceiling.

And ran out the front door.

⸻

The next morning, I found the front door cracked open.

And a USB stick on the welcome mat.

I didn’t plug it in.

I called the number.

⸻

They didn’t come in a marked car.

No ambulance. No flashing lights.

Just a silver van, quiet as fog, and three men in dark clothing with no names on their badges. Not police. Not paramedics. Just… efficient.

Dan fought. He screamed, kicked, clawed at the doorframe.

“You want proof?” he shouted. “You think I’m crazy? Then how did I know about the card?”

One of them jabbed a needle in his arm. His voice slurred.

He stared at me as he collapsed.

“You shouldn’t have kept it.”

The doors closed without a sound.

⸻

For the first time in weeks, the house was quiet.

But I realized something as I sat there in the silence:

I never showed him the card.

I hadn’t told anyone.

⸻

The hospital said no visitors for the first month. “Adjustment period.” To minimize outside influence.

Fine by me.

I told myself I was done. That he wasn’t my responsibility.

I deleted his email. I laughed when I saw three red cars go by. I rolled my eyes at the radio.

But then I saw the same silver van outside my apartment. Three times in one day.

Then I found my coffee mug in the freezer.

Then I opened a text file on my laptop that I don’t remember writing.

Just numbers.

⸻

Then the letter came.

Typed. Cold. From the hospital.

Dan was progressing. He’d soon be allowed access to his personal belongings.

It was signed with his name.

Only… he never typed anything. He hated typing. He signed cards with dramatic swirls and sharp loops.

This signature was small. Mechanical.

And the thing is—I never packed him anything.

⸻

The night before the visit, I burned the card.

Watched it curl in ash.

“I’m not Dan,” I said. “I don’t believe in ghosts.”

The next day, the hospital was silent. Too clean. No nurses. Just cameras.

They didn’t let me speak to him. Just observe through glass.

He was thinner. Quieter. Calm.

He didn’t look up.

But before they took him away, he slid something across the table.

⸻

It was a white hospital card.

With the address.

And my name handwritten in the corner.

I found it in my coat pocket when I got home.

I don’t remember taking it.

I don’t remember taking it.

And I think I left the front door unlocked.

Just for a second.
