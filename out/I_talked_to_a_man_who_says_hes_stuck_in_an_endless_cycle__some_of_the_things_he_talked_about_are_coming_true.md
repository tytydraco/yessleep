Let me preface this by saying that I do not know this man, I can’t find his name anywhere on social media, or in any sort of database. Believe me, I tried.

It started last Friday, I was getting ready for Halloween, and I spent most of the day outside carving pumpkins on my porch. My hands were coated in the slimy guts and pumpkin seeds when I saw someone walking down the street. He was tall, about 6’2, he had short, curly hair and a thick beard that seemingly swallowed his lips. He had a button up flannel shirt, overalls and a straw hat. He looked like any old farmer that passed by the house on a tractor, so I paid no mind to him until he stopped in front of my house and just stared at me. I did the courteous thing and waved at him, and he waved back in turn. Yet he didn’t budge.

“Can I help you?”

“Hm. You always say that.”

“I’m sorry?”

“Never mind.”

“…Okay?”

I went back to the pumpkins, and I started drawing the patterns for the jack-o’-lanterns. I was deep in concentration when I noticed the man was now walking up to me. I put my marker down and spoke,

“Change your mind?”

“No, but do you mind if I help?”

I thought it was odd to have a stranger carve pumpkins with me, but I had bought twelve, so I took the help. He was gifted with the knife, he put in an elaborate design that looked exactly like that spiral hill scene from *The Nightmare Before Christmas*. 

“Wow, that’s beautiful.” I told him.

He smiled as he sat it down next to him. He sighed and said,

“You’re a nice man, Franklin.” 

Only thing was is that I never told him my name. I looked at him and felt unease wash over me like a bucket of cold water.

“How do you know my name?”

“I just know these things, I know a lot of things. I know you got two dogs, one is a dachshund and the other is a chihuahua. Your daughters have named them Brat and Taco.”

“How do-“

“I’m not done. You’ve got a wife named Emily and today she’ll tell you that she’s pregnant with a little boy. And on the news, they’ll mention that an aerial strike from Russia will have struck the California coast.”

I laughed at first, expecting him to laugh with me, he had to have been a coworker of my wife’s or a friend of a friend. But he wasn’t laughing, he seemed overwhelmed with sadness.

“Listen, friend, I’d talk more but you’re making me feel a little weirded out. I think I’ll take care of the pumpkins.”

“God damn it.” He grumbled pinching his brow, “I’m sorry, I rushed it again, just let me explain it over coffee, do you have coffee?”

I was hesitant, he was odd but he didn’t strike me as a ‘dangerous’ person. I told him to wait on the porch, my wife asked me who I was talking to, and all I said it was some guy. I brought out two black cups of coffee outside, steam rolled off their times against the cold air. He smiled as he grabbed his cup.

I gave my cup one sip and asked,

“Well, I’m listening.”

“Right. It’s funny, I keep doing this, having this conversation with people. I keep thinking I have enough time on my hands each time I roll back to the beginning. I guess you could say it started when I died.”

I listened intently, and tried to hide my expression of complete bewilderment.

“Now, I know what you’re thinking. I sound like an insane person but just let me explain. I passed away on July 17th, 2051, ninety nine years old. I was ready to go home, embrace my Lord, and my family. And then I’m in a hospital surrounded by doctors, and I see my Mother holding me.”

“So, you were reincarnated?”

“No. Reborn. I was back to the year of my birth, but I was full of a life times worth of knowledge. I knew the outcome of so many events in not just my life but in history. I tried to change these events, but….”

“But what?”

The old man wiped his eyes.

“Would you believe me if the life you’re living right now is the best possible outcome?”

I thought about the current state of things. War, famine, genocide, poverty, so many awful things. I gave my answer:

“No. I’d like to think there’s a better life than…well, than this.”

The old man gripped my hand, his palm was callous and rough.

“I’ve been lived hundreds of lives. I’ve tried to change so many of them, but every change leads to something horrible. I tipped the FBI about the 9/11 terror attacks, but you know what happened afterward? The bastards tried again, went after that Year’s Super Bowl. Dove the plane right into the stadium. It’s like a house of cards, you pluck one thing out, it all goes to shit.”

I sipped my coffee, the man was obviously insane, so I decided to ask him a question. But before I could ask it, he said,

“You’re going to ask me what’s in hand. You’ve got three pennies and a quarter. Of maybe this time you’ve grabbed your keys which has a fidget attached to it. A little clicker I believe.”

I put the change back in my pocket and stared at him with a slack jawed expression. Before I asked him another question, he plucked the words from my lips,

“You’re gonna ask me for a detail about you only *you* would know….you had a daughter. Her name was going to be Robin, she was a stillborn.”

I felt my stomach drop and asked him,

“So, what are you exactly? Some sort of fucking time loop sage spouting out advice?”

“Listen, I’m not even sure what I am anymore, but all I can do is prepare people.”

“For what?”

“The end of everything.”

“I thought you died at 99.”

“Not of old age.”

He drank the rest of his coffee and seized a pumpkin. He extended an open palm to me,

“May I?”

I handed him a knife, and he started whittling away at the gourd.

“Today. Russia will strike the California coast.”

“You mentioned that earlier. When?”

He looked at his watch and with heavy eyes he told me,

“Six hours from now. You’ll get a notification about it soon.”

“And what then?”

“A Third World War, it’ll be quick.”

“Jesus. What happens?”

“The missiles will fly, and the presidents will point fingers and make claims. But both sides don’t have enough humility to end the war to save their own nations. In the end, the people rise up, start killing their leaders in the streets. Just like the French Revolution.”

“What about us? Everyone living around here?”

“To be honest, we don’t see a lot of conflict outside of the occasional air raid where we’ve got to go to storm shelters and bunkers. When the dust settles, things will be good for a while.”

“For a while?”

“Unfortunately, we neglected the planet to the point of no return. Many animals die, coral reefs blackened by oil, smog covered skies- enjoy the blue sky while you can because after the war, it ain’t coming back. It’ll be hard to breathe, and then…”

He was silent, he dropped the jack-o’-lantern onto the grass, and clasped his hands together.

“The atmosphere starts to erode, by the time I was in the nursing home…it just…I can’t even describe it. It’s just like the earth we knew and then it was overtaken by a sudden darkness. That’s the last thing I remembered, the screams of terror, and then…it all goes black.”

“Why tell me?”

“Why not? I’m here for some reason and I think it’s to help common folk like y’all. It’ll be hard, but you’ll survive until it’s time for the earth to end.”

I felt a rush existential fear overtake me, I was beginning to shake, but he took my hand and spoke softly.

“It’s not here yet, but it will be. Be prepared.”

And then, he was gone. Like I’d never even met him. I tried looking for him in town but there’s no sign of him. I write this because maybe I should be sharing his message too. If you see him, listen to him.

As I’m writing this up, I’m looking at the television showing images of scorched California coastal cities. The president will be speaking in 10 minutes, and the number one thing trending on social media right now is World War 3. Even after our conversation, I was hoping he was just some nut who was able to luckily guess some details about my life. But now I know he was telling the truth.
 
God help us, he was right.
