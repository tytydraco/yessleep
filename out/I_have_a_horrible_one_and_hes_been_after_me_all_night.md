I have a creepy memory that I had between the ages of 14 and 18. In my culture we call them jinns and almost everyone has such a memory. I will write the incident in a way that is a little bit from myself using a little translation, I apologize in advance for the parts that are not understood. If I will return to the subject, at that time, I started to experience this along with a lot of problems such as domestic violence, depression, anxiety, etc. and this made me sink even deeper. I will try to keep it as short as possible because it will be a long series of events;  

There was a dream I used to have all the time. In my dream, I was walking down a street and I came across a small house, and from the outside it looked like it was just a room. Then I enter this house and the house is huge from the inside, like a really big mansion, when I open the door, a long corridor welcomes me, I start walking nervously. The house looks very gothic and depressing aesthetically. As I walk along, even though I am scared, I start to hear quiet footsteps behind me and when I look, I don't see anyone. As I walk, I see a few trinkets, faded flowers, etc. and I ask myself why this house is like this, someone calls out to me, when I turn around, I see that there is no one again. I try to go back to the corridor I walked down because I am extremely scared, but I can't find the outer door and this scares me even more. As I run in a panic, looking for the exit door, a vase tips over and breaks behind me and something starts chasing me. When I turn around because I want to face it, I don't know how, but it disappears, and when I turn around again, I feel it close enough to grab me by the hair and pull me to the ground. 

This is the dream in general and I had the same dream for about 4 years. I was 14 years old when I first started having it and I had this dream 2-3 times a year, but as I got older I started having it more and more often and by the time I was 16 I was having dreams every night where something was chasing me until the morning. I didn't feel the need to tell my parents because it was just a dream and it wasn't something I thought they would be interested in at the time. I didn't tell anyone until I saw the reflections of this dream in real life. 

One night in my dream, 5 people (I don't know how I know this, 4 men and 1 woman) were chasing me and the woman threw a stone at the back of my leg and I woke up with that fall. When I woke up (I was wearing shorts and pajamas), when my mother came to me to see what happened to the back of her leg and looked at my leg, I realized that the place where the stone hit was blue. Then one day when we gathered with my friends, when I put the glass in my hand on the kitchen counter in front of everyone's eyes, the glass hit the opposite wall and crumbled in front of our eyes, I don't even remember how we escaped from the kitchen. 

After a lot of absurd events like this, I started to feel someone next to me all the time. Someone started talking to me in my head all the time, but most of the time it was just noise in my head, like when you are sitting in an overcrowded place and people's voices blend together. When I was alone, I was constantly surrounded by things that scared me a lot, like cabinet doors opening, books falling off the shelves, but when I told my family, I didn't think they would believe me and that's exactly what happened, I got an answer like you are trying to attract attention. 

Since the situation was not resolved and there was nothing I could do on my own, I started to live with this invisible friend and decided not to bring up the issue with my family again. However, things started to get uglier, I started not sleeping at night out of fear, and if I did, I would always have the same dream. When I went to bed, this "thing" would lie next to me. Whenever I fell asleep, it would shake me and wake me up, and since it wasn't a period when I was mentally healthy, I slowly started having suicidal and similar thoughts. I felt like no one else loved me but him, but at the same time I was extremely worried that one day I would see him physically, and if I did, I would go crazy. 

There are so many things I know about him, but I don't even know how I know them. Over the years I got used to his presence. Suicidal thoughts became too much, I was in a very severe depression and the medications I was taking were not helping me at all. I decided to bring up the subject to my family again, I told my father about the events and it was a catharsis moment that I didn't want to die but I couldn't get this thought out of my head, do something about it, then they resolved the issue and I got rid of this friend. 

I am now 25 years old and I have interesting mystical properties. I can read people, my senses are extremely strong, but I shelved this feature a long time ago because I didn't want to get too involved because of what you went through. Thank you for reading, there are a few more similar events, maybe I will share them with you later. 

Have a good day!
