when i was younger (9-10) i was diagnosed with a disease called TINU (Tubulointerstitial Nephritis and Uveitis) which basically means that my white blood cells in my eyes and kidneys don't know the difference between them and bad bacteria and stuff, so they attack each other, which can lead to blindness and loss in kidney function if left untreated.

After i was diagnosed i was introduced to a eye and kidney doctor (like you normally would) and kept seeing them for around 2 years, with regular check ups every 1-2 months. When i was 12, i went to the hospital for another check up. I remember checking in and going to the room, inside the room while waiting. Another person (who i had never seen before) came in and asked to talk to my mom, they stepped out and left for maybe 10 minutes.

In the middle of them leaving, my regular doctor came in and did a standard eye test (say the letters on the wall, look in my eyes, etc) And then she opened the blinds on the window. She had never done this before. The doctor asked if i had seen someone down there, near the parking lot.

I replied no, that i hadent, and if i should have. The doctor said no (then waited 10 seconds or so) then said this was just a part of the new eye exam. She asked that if there was someone, would i have been able to see them looking at me from below. (the parking lot was maybe 200 feet away 50 feet down) I replied yea, then i pointed out a random dude walking and said, look there's someone. I then looked at the doctor and remember her looking wide eyed at what i was pointing, like she was trying to see the persons face. she said, that's very good, i don't know if i would have spotted him if you didn't point him out. she then asked if i had come here with someone else than my mother, i remember her asking. "i know you've been here quite a lot, have you ever been here with someone else? maybe someone who needed a ride to work or something?" I replied no, that i had only ever been here with my mom, and maybe once or twice with my dad. she said ok and told me "lets continue with the check up" 

We finished the eye exam and then i went home with my mom, who came in after the eye exam was done (she usually stayed with me during the whole thing to ask questions and what not) when we were walking out she told me we were taking the stairs (pretty normal) and while walking down them she said that if i ever saw someone in a black suit looking at me from the parking lot that it was not normal, and that i should tell someone. she even made me repeat what she said.

I felt very odd but didn't think much of it at the time, because the doctor said it was an eye exam and the hospital was in a city so maybe she was warning me about strangers or something. Almost every visit afterwards, the doctor made sure i could see long distances, either by going out into the hallway and looking at something, but mostly by looking at the parking lot. the one thing that was odd was that when we looked at the parking lot, she made me point out a person, or something the same size.

I really don't know what happenI really dont know what happend. but i remember going home and watching youtube. this was around the time when the clown watching trend or whatever was gaining traction. I thought about this a few times, how it could have been someone doing the trend at a hospital, but my mom said that if i saw anyone in "a black suit"d, maybe some person was looking for a point of entry who shouldn't be there. but i remember this was around the time when the clown watching trend or whatever was gaining traction. I thought about this a few times, how it could have been someone doing the trend at a hospital, but my mom said that if i saw anyone in "a black suit"

About 2 years ago i went back to my last visit there before going to a new hospital because i was turning 18. i asked the same doctor about the visit. she said something along the lines of, "no no, i think he left, but it was a good sign you could see that far" (note that i only really remember her saying 'no no, i think he left' but she said a bunch of other stuff, and she acted as though this was a minor detail"
