There was this guy (or should I say, kid) named Roger who I first met in 9th grade. He was pretty shy but a nice guy to be around. Things started to get a little crazy in 11th grade when he developed a crush on this girl named Emily. This was around March of 2022. Anyway, he couldn’t stop staring at her at lunch and thinking about her, even during class.

Fast forward to a month later, and he started asking me and a couple of his other friends for advice. I gave him the usual, “be yourself, take it slow, and don’t act like you need her.” This advice would be important later in the story.

Roger finally mustered up enough courage to approach her at lunch, but I don’t remember the details of the conversation. It was probably just some generic stuff, but I do remember that he asked for her number. She declined, so he asked for her social media. She declined again, and then he left after one of her friends showed up. The funny part? Initially, he asked if she would be interested in being his study partner. He wasn’t interested in studying at all—he just wanted to spend time with her. He even joined the AP History class just to be around her.

Fast forward to a month later, and Roger, feeling a little more confident, approached her again—this time during a school trip to Area 53, an amusement park in Brooklyn. He nervously walked up to her, said “hi,” and asked if they could be friends. She sounded confused, but said, “I mean, we could try,” and that was the end of the conversation.

Now, before this encounter at Area 53, Roger had already sent Emily an email saying he wanted to be friends and that he needed someone to talk to about Attack on Titan. He also made the questionable decision of asking her friends for her contact information.

A few weeks later, Emily finally replied to his email. You can probably guess what she said: she didn’t want to be friends. Roger asked why, and she told him, “I don’t like you. You make me uncomfortable, and you didn’t respect my boundaries.” This was after he had asked her friends for her contact information and ignored her wishes.

Roger was heartbroken, but instead of moving on, he fixated on her even more. Remember that advice I gave him about not acting like he needed her? Well, he did the complete opposite.

Fast forward to senior year, and Roger starts doing some pretty crazy stuff. He starts stalking her on social media, taking pictures of her at school, staring at her from afar, and trying to get closer to her through people in the anime club. He even tried to join the anime club just to be around her. He approached her numerous times, against her wishes, and sent her emails that were nothing but riddles and a fake promotion to a cooking website.

Naturally, this led to trouble. His behavior got him confronted by Emily’s friends, and rumors started spreading about what he had been doing. Roger ended up losing a lot of friends and became alienated. He was called into the main office for allegedly sending multiple emails to her school account, and Emily’s mom even threatened to have him expelled.

Thankfully, after all this drama, which lasted from August to November, Roger finally stopped approaching her and sending emails. But it didn’t stop him from thinking about her, staring at her, or even taking screenshots of her photos on friends’ social media accounts.

The thing that really freaked me out was when Roger kept pictures of Emily’s prom photos and even tried to plan how he was going to see her again after high school. Luckily, he eventually forgot about that plan, but what was scarier was when he was sitting next to a girl—his ex-friend—and said to her, “You know, I’m going to the same college as you, so if I were you, I’d get used to it. You’ll see me around quite a bit.”

I wasn’t sure what he meant by that, but it sounded like he was planning to continue approaching her whenever he saw her on campus, and that’s pretty creepy.

Now, here’s the kicker. Roger had been rejected by numerous girls—something like 50, from high school to college. I also heard that he was academically dismissed from college after his second semester due to a low GPA. Yeah, that’s Roger’s story.

But wait, there’s more! Roger’s obsession with Emily wasn’t his only issue. Apparently, he also made another college girl uncomfortable. He met her during his astronomy class, and he genuinely thought they were cool, but when she had a boyfriend, things got awkward. Her boyfriend had to step in and tell Roger to leave her alone.

Another story involved a girl from our school who transferred after 10th grade. Roger went out with her to Dave & Buster’s and made her uncomfortable by asking about her breast size and even leaning in to smell her hair, saying she “smelled good.” Needless to say, that didn’t sit well with anyone, and it led to Roger being socially ostracized by most of the girls in our friend group.

By the way, Roger also loved telling this story about his crush to anyone who would listen, which was just… odd.

Finally, Roger mentioned wanting to join a gym so that he could gain some muscle and feel strong. The only problem? He couldn’t afford a gym membership and couldn’t even stay consistent with training at home. That was half a year ago and That was the last conversation I had with Roger and honestly I hope I never see him again.
