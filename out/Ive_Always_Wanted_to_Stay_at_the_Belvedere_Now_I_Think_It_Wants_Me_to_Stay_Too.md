Mr. Macklin jumped from the top floor of the Belvedere.

He was found no more than a splatter on the pavement, his crisp suit hiding a pretzel of shattered bones. The twisted state of the man's body could not detract from his eyes, frozen in a sudden and all-encompassing terror before their brightness clouded over.

The doormen hurried to rush the body away before the morning crowd could stumble upon it, but there were too many factors to consider and too little time. The blood had seeped from the man's threads, pooling upon the pavement. There was the sound of the collision. The fissure it had left. All of the fluids accumulated like a lake, seeping into every crack and pore. An impact like that could not simply be scrubbed away. It was found and never forgotten.

There are claims that in gloomy conditions, the puddle reappears, black and swimming along the pavement, leading toward the lobby doors.

This was not my story. It was one of many strange occurrences revolving around the Belvedere. It wasn’t even one I necessarily believed; not because of any far-fetched recollection of events, but because of how little was known about the man. There was no traceable family. No job history. No societal footprint apart from a bundle of neatly wounded bills on the nightstand and a scribbled message in his breast pocket:

*I rest my head, cruel world.*

*Mr. Macklin.*

It was as if the man had been erased.

While most of these peculiar (and often gruesome) tales would have hammered a nail into the coffin of any self-respecting business, they seemed to only add to the hotel’s mystique. Mysteries flowed out of its plastered walls. People seemed drawn to a good story. And that’s all they were to most–just stories.

I longed to see the Belvedere since I was a little girl, since I was old enough to shine a flashlight under the covers of my bed. I would devour pages and pages of books. The same things that kept me up at night gave me something to latch on to. Monsters and demons and ghosts and the truly unexplainable. I could imagine I was something bigger than the cramped bunk beds and empty refrigerator. I was not alone in those stories.

At eighteen, I said goodbye to my foster home. All of my possessions were stashed into a mangled hiking backpack. After bouncing around some friends' sofas, I scraped together what little cash I could gather and decided there was no better time than now. My friend, Dean, was foolish enough (or drunk enough) one evening to agree. We packed our things and boarded a bus that following weekend. The snow-clad trees danced in the wind, the blur of nature passing by the frosted passenger windows.

\*\*\*

Tory was a five-hour drive from the city. Once dropped off at the town center, we ditched the quaint little shopping district and hopped on another bus. Four stops took us to the parking lot of a large ski hill. The lot was lined with cars in all directions. We walked out back to the main road and trudged another thirty minutes through the snow, toward the road we believed would lead us to the Belvedere.

The access road was littered with construction blockades. A long, undisturbed blanket of white stretched vastly into the trees. We stuck our fingers into the metal loops and shakily hopped the fence. Our boots sank with every step, snow threatening the brim of their polyester shells as we marched onward.

Dean began to whistle. He did that as a front when he was retreating inward. The tune seemed to glide effortlessly through the thick expanse of forest.

I know how it must have felt to someone like him, trespassing down a road we knew very little about, chasing a landmark that existed in the confines of some paperbacks. This was undeniably, categorically, *not* Dean. We were a long way from home with very little money. His parents would be so upset. And he would never say it, he didn’t need to, but...

*he was afraid.*

I smiled, held his hand for a moment, the sentiment scary, but not lost on me. I didn’t know what this was or what it could be.

I just wanted to glimpse it, touch it, feel the history within its walls. All he cared about was that he was here with me, and I thanked God I didn’t have to do it all alone.

The sun glared down in a blinding curtain of light, amplified by the blanket of powder around us.

The road…it just kept on going. Straight as an arrow along packed drifts of ice and snow. We hadn’t noticed until I slipped on a particularly slick patch. The trees looked like tiny blotches of paint from this high up; the path had been gradually climbing.

There was no indication of anything other than pure, unadulterated nature. A fresh sprinkle of snow began to fall.

“Maybe it’s been knocked down,” Dean theorized. “This is quite a plot of land. They could do a lot with this.” I appreciated the attempt; he didn’t want me to get my hopes up.

I squeezed his hand and assured him it was fine. The walk, the escape from it all, none of it was wasted. But it was hard to disguise the tinge of discouragement spreading across my face.

We began to pant as the drifts got deeper, sweat dripping beneath our layers of nylon and wool. My socks began to squish beneath tiny, stagnant puddles. Some spots were like pillowy quicksand, your foot suddenly collapsed deeper into a chute of slush and ice.

*We’re close,* I told myself. *It’s gotta be here.*

Deep down…I wasn’t quite sure. I just knew I couldn’t surrender to the notion that it was gone, or even worse, that we had gotten lost. What if we abandoned the search when it was just around the next coupling of trees? We had to press forward, to Dean’s dismay.

Thankfully, the ground began to level. Tiny track marks were left behind us amidst a sea of miniature trees. The road back was nowhere to be found.

At this point, a cold front forced the toques back on our heads, loose snow swirling, spinning, dancing. Thick flakes began to fall which blurred our vision up ahead.

Dean’s singsong tune started up again. Some nearby branches stirred. A yelp leapt from my throat as a family of warblers sailed out from their covert shelter. But it wasn’t from his whistling. There was a sound travelling from some far-off source, a twang bellowing off in the distance.

I guess I didn’t know what to expect…definitely not what we’d uncovered.

As the mammoth structure began to materialize behind the wall of trees, Dean’s mouth was left agape.

A long walkway led to the compound, de-iced and cleared of snow. We plodded forward, heart pounding, into the chorus of laughter. A cloud of classical instrumentals and muffled conversation carried back to us in the wind.

The archway into the courtyard gave the impression that we were entering the confines of some ancient fortress. Cobblestone formed a center square where a fire was ablaze. Patrons had gathered around a pit, huddled around its warmth. Groups of admirers took to the more adventurous guests who donned skates and glided across the frozen surface of a nearby lake. People came and went in all directions, the wheels of suitcases toppling the ground as the four blocks towered over the plaza in a tidy semi-circle. Mountains stretched gloriously behind them for as far as the eye could see.

The whole place…the atmosphere…it was magic. I could hardly breathe.

“Can I help you, Madame?”

My gaze was drawn to the top of the tower, to the sound. It stood above like a glorious steeple, carved into a cramped quarters between brick and stone. The brass, cracked and speckled in ice and dust, floated back and forth rhythmically. The bell tolled with a resounding, heavenly momentum.

*Clang.*

*Clang.*

From this distance, I could only glimpse a flicker of movement. It was so quick I nearly missed it. A shadow gathered by the tassel of rope.

“Lost?” The voice enquired again. “Do you have a reservation, Madame? ”

Dean shook his head and began to speak. I chopped at his arm and coughed politely. “We do. Well… uh… we’d like to speak to someone about that, actually.”

He grinned with crooked teeth, his moustache coated in a layer of frost. “Come with me, then. I’ll see what we can do.”

Dean hissed through a tight smile as we approached the revolving doors. “*Val*? *What the hell are you doing?*”

I shushed him, embarrassment and panic swelling up inside of me.

*You know this makes no sense*.

We had reservations at the Sundown, a run-of-the-mill hostel sensibly catered to our budget. I could feel the springs of the mattress digging into my spine already. A mixed six-person dorm with beige walls and questionable stains. I could see Dean’s perspective, sure, but I doubt he could ever truly see mine. This was a real moment for me.

A silver chandelier glistened from above the vaulted ceiling, pelts of various wild game were strung along the intricate masonry like trophies, all of it *better* than I could have ever imagined.

We had to try.

Dean’s discomfort beaconed from his eyes when the clerk handed me an actual, physical key.

*Are you sure this is what you want?*

He kept a gentle grip on my waist, his smile wavering. The tassel at the end of the keyring displayed our room number: #1444.

My mind raced as we grabbed our backpacks and followed the signage to Block Four.

\*\*

It wasn’t the largest or most extravagant room, but it carried an old charm that made you feel at ease. Neat and tidy like your grandparents' bedroom, covered in bits of heirlooms and old artifacts that felt criminally outdated and out of place, but spoke to you in ways modern, cultivated decor could never do.

We took in the snow-capped mountains, the jubilations from the square, and the smell of the fire pit floating up to our balcony. He held me close as we shared a moment together. He seemed to have warmed up to the idea, the prospect of our very own *private* bedroom.

I left to go freshen up a bit. When I returned, Dean was standing, facing the last rays of fading sunlight. No shirt, boxers flapping in the recirculated air like a bad parachute.

He whispered, “Do you hear that, Valerie?” His back was to me, but his voice…it sounded different. Softer. There was something about it I didn’t like…but I figured it was just fatigue.

“Not really,” I responded. “No room is perfect, Dean.”

“I agree. But…” his voice trailed off, swallowed by a bout of uncomfortable silence. He stood still. Then, with a bewildered grimace, he turned and crept toward the peephole.

I followed. There was nothing but a white wall on the other side.

“Maybe call reception?” I asked, genuinely confused.

Dean walked to the nightstand and dialled, pressing the receiver to his ear. After a moment, he placed the phone back down. His head drooped, and he swallowed hard. I tried my best to bring his spirits back up, but he continued to ramble on, fumbling with theories about what it could be. Some stupid children. A couple getting a little too frisky. Or worse… something caught between the walls, thudding and banging to get free.

It didn’t feel like any of that. I heard nothing.

“Let’s leave it alone, Dean,” I sighed, tossing him the keys. They fumbled out of his hands. “Come on. Let’s grab your shoes.”

We strolled the halls of gold and taupe rugs, sauntering around every corner and bend. Block four was incredibly quiet. There was an elaborate wedding in the ballroom, a young bride with an uncomfortably old groom. We eyed the staggering menu at the restaurant and opted for snacks back in our room. But we never once left the complex. No need to. There would be loads of time in the morning.

Dean’s mood steadily improved. He had a boyish wonder upon his face, struck by the detail of the architecture and enamoured by all of the history that I was able to spew.

The stone-laden castle was built in the 1800s by a steady force of new immigrants. Workers trudged through the dense, remote forest and harsh winters for years. Somehow, the project survived. The Belvedere family had made its fortune off the back of various infrastructure projects across Western Canada, and the hotel would be their first (and only) venture into the hospitality industry. It was thought to have been a present from Connor Belvedere to his second wife, Marta, only dwarfed by the chain of Rocky Mountains wrapped around it. Every corner and nook had a noteworthy piece of medieval grandeur and brilliance. Featuring four wings, a sculpted underground pool modeled after a nearby cave basin, and clever touches from Madame Luria, a renowned architect and interior designer for her time. There were famous pieces of abstract and colonial art gathered from the south of France. It was admired, adored, and unrivalled. A timeless symbol of luxury and comfort.

The evening seemed to roll away from us effortlessly. We chatted through the night until the aftermath of the hike-in began to take its toll.

Nestled between the memory foam and satin sheets, it was like lying on a cloud. We admired the starlit backdrop from the balcony, uninhibited by any light pollution or cloud cover, with not a care in the world.

My eyelids began to flicker under the weight of the evening. Dean’s body heat radiated off mine. But it still felt cold. So cold.

It was an instant, sweeping sleep. But it was far from restless.

Our room fell into this foggy haze. Barely visible in the shadows of a bleary, dream-like shade, the walls began to ripple. They pulsated with a gentle rhythm. Then it wasn’t so much what I saw, but what I could feel.

It vibrated through me in a low rumble. Whispered conversations. Grumbling. Shouting. Conversations that trailed off into nothingness. Thousands of visages from hundreds of years all swimming together as one. Vapours of activity, memories, emotions. Everything travelled through me.

I tried to shriek amidst the throbbing, bursting pressure in my skull. My will was simply not enough. My body remained stiff.

I was trapped.

All of the voices and visions began to overload my amygdala. My mind scampered through the grating flurry like a starving rat stuck at the dead end of a maze.

It just wouldn’t stop.

Hearts entangling. Love withering away. Excitement and passion and the creeping passage of time. The minute conversations to the most visceral of fights. Everything vibrated from the walls like echo-location, and I was absorbed by its waves. Consumed by the tiny space that was now ours and all of the life that had been lived here.

There was a puff of breath. Clammy, sour. An uncontrollable tingle ran up my spine. What felt like bristles of short stubble chaffed against my neck. Foreign. Unannounced. There was a weight pinned down against mine, a force in the blackness holding me down like a trap.

Something told me it was not his touch.

I forced another desperate, miserable shriek that never broke free. Soon I was engulfed in an amalgamated cloud of blurred fingers and hands, creeping, gripping, moaning, rubbing against every waking space of skin. I erupted in a sudden, insatiable scream.

I don’t know how long I was out for when I finally awoke. The room still fell beneath a haze, but the voices had finally ceased. This time there was a whistle in the breeze. Calm and tempered, it drifted into the black quarters with a haunting ease. A vague pattern of drapes fluttered.

I managed to force myself upright, my head aching ruthlessly. A shiver ran through my body. I could just make out a thin layer of snow wetting the hardwood.

“Dean?” I called out weakly. I turned. The bed was empty.

I couldn’t place the thuds. Hollow and resounding and much too close to comfort.

“D–Dean?”

I crawled out of the covers, my mind halting my advance to an apprehensive shuffle. The thuds continued.

As I approached, moonlight cast its pallid glow. The drapes were drawn just enough to reveal it.

A fog upon the window. A sheath of icicles formed around the surrounding breath.

Face, hands, pressed up against the glass.

He was smiling.

“Dean…come in? This isn’t funny.” I shuddered, barely able to feel my legs under the gust of winter air.

I inched closer. More clunks echoed through the room. His head tapped the window. The figure was hunched over and eerily still. Only once I was mere steps away did the shadow retreat. He climbed the balcony railing effortlessly.

Only then did he jump.

There in the blustery winter evening, I stared down at the tiny star-fished imprint in the snow. The pool of blood. The limp, twisted limbs.

This time, my shrieks carried, rattling my eardrums.

—--------

It was hard to tell how much time had passed. The snow had erased every trace of us, except for some remaining bills blowing haphazardly across the hardwood. I battled through many manic bouts of rage, though I have truly screamed as much as I can scream. The walls have heard all of my pleas by now.

This place…it changed. The landlines don’t seem to work. Neither does the electricity. The beautiful tapestry and warm charm is cold, frigid, and covered in disgusting stains of black. I am reminded of the unforgiving winter that brutes forward– dust, dirt, a charred stench–all swirling together amidst the rubble. The stars looked beautiful through the collapsed support beams, but there was no end in sight.

At the end of the hall was a baffling slope of crumbled rock that may have once served as a stairwell. I located the lonely elevator shaft and its rusted steel cables. It would have taken quite the traverse up the slope of ice and rock. To make your way down, I couldn’t even imagine.

With dwindling battery life and spotty reception, I contacted every authority that I could think of. All I received in return was static and the occasional scoff at my desperation. They’ve known the stories as well as any.

Room #1444. The Macklin room.

It was Dean who never got to hear it.

Block four was rumoured to have been lost in a fire shortly after the jumper incident. How it started, no one knows. Could have been as simple as a cigarette butt left untouched by a thoughtless guest or as heinous as a cover-up. The fog never really dissipated, the arid stench of smoke domineering with a suffocating chokehold.

*But they were wrong. What we experienced… it was proof of that. Wasn’t it?*

Conversation from the square wafted up in a cacophony of unsettling joy. Somewhere in the distance, there was the sweet hum of Dean’s whistling. Somewhere in the distance, there was the bell.

*Clang.*

*Clang.*

It tolled, as if to remind me of the only way out.

*Down.*

The man had jumped. Escaped, like so many others across time and history, leaving very little answers.

Could he have leapt to join something greater? Something bigger than himself?

There remained promises waiting to be sealed, voices in the walls that I could not bear. They took Dean. *My* Dean.

I feared with every passing second that it was too late, that I had become a part of it now.

I pleaded and pleaded to the wind.

*Please.*

*Somebody.*
