I don’t know if anyone else has experienced something like this. Maybe you have, and you’re just too afraid to say it out loud. But I can’t stay silent anymore. I feel like I’m losing my mind.

It started about a month ago. At first, it was just strange dreams. Nothing out of the ordinary—everyone has weird dreams sometimes, right? But these were different. These dreams felt… real. Too real.

Every night, I’d find myself in the same place: a vast, dark, empty space. No walls, no ceiling, no sound—just blackness in every direction. Except for one thing.

A thin black thread. Hanging down from somewhere far above me. Perfectly still. Perfectly straight. Almost glowing in contrast to the void.

And I couldn’t look away.

There was something about it—like it was alive. Like it wanted me to notice it. And night after night, I would just stand there and stare, frozen in place. Until one night... I touched it.

That was my biggest mistake.

The moment my fingers brushed against it, the space around me shattered. I was suddenly standing in what looked like my apartment—but everything was wrong.

It was a mirror version. Like everything had been flipped, reversed. Familiar and completely alien at the same time. The furniture was where it should be, but it wasn’t mine. It looked like cheap imitations—like someone tried to recreate my home from memory and got the texture all wrong. The walls… were breathing. I’m not being poetic. They were rising and falling, slowly, like lungs. Something was alive behind them.

At first, I thought it was just a dream. A twisted version of sleep paralysis. But then I noticed the shadows.

They didn’t move with me. They lagged behind, like they were stuck in time, moving slower than I did. They twitched and shimmered like something glitching out in a video game. And then… came the people.

People I knew. Family. Friends. Coworkers. They appeared one by one. But their faces were wrong—distorted, warped like melting wax. Their eyes were hollow, and their mouths didn’t move when they spoke. But I still heard them—whispering my darkest fears back at me.

They spoke about things no one should know. Things I’d buried. Things I’d forgotten. They whispered secrets from my childhood, memories I hadn’t thought about in years. Each word felt like it was carving something out of me.

I couldn’t move. The air was thick, like syrup. Every step was a struggle. I was trapped there, night after night. And when I woke up… I was exhausted. Like I had actually been there, physically. No amount of coffee helped. Sleeping pills only pulled me back in faster. Days began to blur together. Reality started to feel as warped as the dreams.

Last night, I tried to break the thread. I thought if I snapped it, maybe I could wake up for good. But when I grabbed it, I felt a sharp, searing pain in my wrist. I woke up gasping—and there were bruises on my arm. Deep, purple ones. Like something had been gripping me tightly.

But I live alone. I’ve always lived alone.

I’m writing this now, half-asleep, drained, and desperate. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. I don’t know how long I’ve already been stuck in this nightmare loop. But I do know one thing:

Every time I close my eyes… the thread is closer.
Sometimes, I feel it brushing against my neck.
Even when I’m awake.

Please, if you ever find yourself in a dream with a black thread hanging in front of you—don’t touch it.
Don’t follow it. Don’t even look at it too long.

Because I don’t know if I’ll be able to post again.

And I don’t think I’ll be the only one it’s looking for.
