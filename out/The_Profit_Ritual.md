There was a fire at a cafe a few days ago that took the lives of four, and I was sent in to figure out what caused it. I'm embarrassed to say I wasn't able to find anything that could have set off such a localized inferno.

On a shelf beneath the molten register, I found a scorched journal. Only the last few pages survived, and I honestly have no idea what to make of them. At first I thought it was just a writing exercise, or perhaps an assignment for university. The campus isn't too far from here. 

But something about the journal intrigued me, so I took photos of the pages before I submitted them with my inconclusive report.

I've transcribed the journal below, deciphering the handwriting the best I could despite the soot and smudges, and I depicted the completely illegible or burned areas with "×××".

Dear Nikki, 

It's the big day!!!! *Café Nicolette* is finally open to the public! It looks amazing, we followed your design to the T, and it'll look even better with customers.

Unfortunately we had none today because George made a typo on the flyers we passed around campus last week. (Genius, as usual, right?)

He and Chloe ran to the wrong address to steer people here, but no one was there. It was a bit disappointing for a first day, but there's always tomorrow!


**Wednesday, August 2, 2023**

Dear Nikki,

The cafe isn't doing too well. We redid the flyers, advertised online, and Zeina even whipped up a batch of her donuts and passed them around campus, but we only made $23 this past week. And that included tips.

Chloe and I keep telling the others that we could save money by serving the leftover sandwiches and donuts the next day, but Zeina and Norm are adamantly against that. They say it's an insult to serve something not prepared fresh.

George is still scrambling about trying to market our little cafe, and I'm trying my best to manage our budget so we don't sink before we've even left the dock. But don't worry, we haven't lost hope!


**××× (date unknown)**

××× been a month since we opened the cafe, and we're already at each other's throats. After closing, Zeina threw her apron in the trash right over all the donuts she'd made, and Chloe yelled at her for giving up. They almost got into it before George pulled them apart and told them to cool it.

Norm isn't doing too well either. During the quiet moments, he'd stare off into space and spin his wedding ring around his finger. I know his pain. I never imagined you wouldn't be by our side as we brought your dream to life. If you were here, you'd probably have had this cafe up and running in no time. You were always the smarter sister. I miss you.

I began this journal to document our journey to success, to make you proud, to leave us with something to look back on and smile at, but all it's doing is making me depre×××

Dear Nikki,

I'd given up on this journal until George dropped by yesterday and told us he had a solution to our problem. He'd heard from a friend who'd heard from an uncle's cousin's tour guide that there's a ritual we can do called the Profit Ritual that's guaranteed to bring us customers.

Get this. First, we need a piggy bank. I'm not kidding. One that you can't see through or open unless you break it. Then, we had to put one unlit match and one extinguished match inside, making sure the second match was fully extinguished. Now, the ritual was ready to be performed.

Every day, we're to take the money the final customer paid, not including tips, and place it in the piggy bank. If they paid with a card, we have to take cash out of our own xxx

xxx next day we'll get that number of customers, rounded to the nearest whole number. The only rule is, we must never upsell that final customer.

When I tell you we laughed until we cried. We were literally shaking in fits of desperate hysteria. George was upset and said it wouldn't hurt to try, so after we collected ourselves, we humored him.

He opened his bag and pulled out a box of matches and a gaudy, ceramic clown with a slit in its hunched back, and we performed the ritual. Our third and final customer today paid $5.75 in cash, so we shoved that into the clown bank before we chuckled mirthlessly and went home.

And today.

We got six customers.

Can you believe it?

I'm thinking it's just a coincidence. Zeina thinks so too. But the three siblings are certain it's the ritual. Zeina and I needed more proof, so we did it again today. The final customer paid $12.13 by card, so we rummaged in the cash register and our pockets to get the exact amount. 

I don't want to get my hopes up, but I'm giddy with excitement. This could change the course of *Café Nicolette*. This could be it! We can finally realize your dream!


**Friday, September 15, 2023**

Dear Nikki,

It happened again! We got twelve customers! If this keeps going all through next week, then there's no way it's a coincidence. The ritual is legit.

We don't open on weekends, so we weren't sure if the $10.40 we stashed in the clown bank will work on Monday, but we're holding our breaths. 

**Monday, September 18, 2×××**

Dear Nikki,

It worked, we got ten customers today! Unfortunately, the last one didn't order much. We stashed the $2.50 in the clown bank, and this got us to seriously consider all the dimensions of the ritual. 

$2.50 means we'll only get three customers tomorrow. And if the final person's order is also a small amount, then what were we doing?

Not to mention, the money we're stashing away is untouchable. George conveniently forgot to mention that. We weren't allowed to use any of it or remove it from th×××

We argued for a while before we decided to let the ritual run through this week. Since we weren't allowed to upsell our customers, we decided to put our most expensive items near the cash register to hopefully entice them to buy on their own.


**Friday, September 22, 2023**

Dear Nikki,

The ritual is still going strong! Placing the more expensive items near the register was a good idea. George also printed out posters of Norm's fanciest sandwiches and Zeina's most delectable danishes, and people were buying more than ever!

Today, we only had two customers, but the first bought three dozen donuts for a conference and the second bought lunch for a family of six. So, everything was working out, we just had to have faith in the ritual!

As for the clown bank, I'm now treating it like our savings stash. Once we stop the ritual, we'll have access to all that cash again, but for now, it's safe in that hunchback clown next to this journal beneath the register.

After work, we went out to celebrate your birthday at Barnaby's. George had a smug look on his face the entire night as we clinked glasses and talked about *Café Nicolette's* future, and we didn't mind. He saved your dream.

Zeina made a speech about you that brought us all to tears, she really misses her bestie. We then all hugged, a group you brought together with your love, before we stumbled up to the stage and sang your song. Celebr×××


**×××ctober 9, 2023**

Dear Nikki,

I don't know why, but this past week our customers weren't buying much at all. The ritual is still working, but we're barely getting more than three customers a day.

I know businesses have ups and downs, but this is really eating into our budget. All the cheer and optimism we had has plummeted.


**Thursday, October 12, 2023**

Dear Nikki,

I almost broke the one rule.

I'm still shaking.

I shouldn't be scared, it's our cafe, I can do what I want … but the ritual has been working perfectly, which means there is something happening beyond our control. And who knows what breaking the rule might do. 

Our customers still aren't paying much at all. The final one today dawdled by the display way past closing, and then he only ordered a single donut hole. This was getting ridiculous. No one orders just one donut hole!

I was in front when he came up to pay, and I said, "Would you also like …"

I caught myself at the last second, and the customer fixed me with a gaze so piercing, it was almost as if he was daring me as he said, "Would I like what?"

I knew my anxiety was making me imagine his knowing stare, and I barely managed to blurt out "... a n-napkin with that?"

His gaze softened and he smiled. "Yes, please, honey."

It was close, so close. I was desperate, and I almost ruined everything. I don't know if we'll be able to keep this going. I'm going to ask everyone tonight if we can stop the ritual.


**Monday, October 16, 2023**

Dear Nikki,

We talked Friday and all through the weekend, but only Zeina was on my side. Norm was certain this was just a hiccup and we'll pass it, and Chloe and George agreed with their big brother. So, unfortunately, it was three against two.

×××s as depressing as last week. We're in the red, and since the ritual is still going, the clown bank is off limits. Some days I'm tempted to dip in, but I won't. I mustn't. 

I don't know what to do … I think I'm going to take a few days off.

**Thursday, October 19, 2023**

Dear Nikki,

I just experienced every single possible emotion in one day, and I'm traumatized, deflated, and regretful. I'm sorry, sis.

I came back to work today after taking two days off, thinking I'd be fresh and ready, and I was at first, especially when I saw the line of customers waiting for us to open up. I thought things were finally turning around.

In the afternoon, Norm and I were the only ones in the cafe when our final customer walked in. I was in front and I smiled and greeted the old woman, and I shuddered when she smiled back. It was the way her eyes locked onto me, their watery gaze unblinking.

I tried to ignore my unease as she shuffled over, her gaze still on me, her cane clacking against the checkered tiles. The closer she got, the more I noticed the color of her eyes. A strange maroon. I blinked a few times, making sure it wasn't a trick of the light. It wasn't. Her irises were literally red.

She reached the cash register, and I fought to keep my customer service smile when I saw the cracks in her face. From a distance, I thought they were wrinkles … but this close, it looked like her skin was brittle paper mache. It was unnerving.

And my stomach turned when I saw something inside the cracks.

Inside her *face*.

I *swear* there was something inside. I could see shifts in color. Shifts in … depth. 

I couldn't stop staring, my pulse racing. I'm sure my mouth was hanging open. 

And then she opened her mouth, and the most repulsive smell hit me right in the face. It was as if she was smuggling rotten eggs in her throat.

I gagged despite myself, tearing up as I stepped back and covered my nose and mouth with my hands, my heart hammering against my chest. I was scared. I was mortified. I was confused. I didn't know what to do.

Her red eyes twinkled as she asked in a deep, raspy voice that seemed to echo in her lungs, "How's business, honey?"

I stared at her, hyperventilating into my cupped hands, and my fear only multiplied as I swear the cracks on her face began to get wider.

And I ran.

I ran to the kitchen in hysterics, panting and sobbing as I tried to explain to Norm what I saw. He grabbed a knife and rushed to the front, and he came back a few seconds later and said nobody was there. But he did smell the lingering stench. I swore I s×××

××× closing up, we shoved the money from the register into our cash box, grabbed the clown bank, and went to my place before calling the rest to come over, and they all listened to me retell my encounter, Zeina hugging me and Chloe rubbing my back as my voice and hands trembled.

I asked if they'd experienced anything like that the two days I was away, and they all shook their heads … except George. He was paler than the wall behind him.

I asked if he knew anything about this, and he fumbled for his inhaler and took a few puffs before he shakily whispered that he thinks he broke the rule yesterday.

I couldn't believe it.

We yelled at him. And then we yelled at him some more before we demanded an explanation. 

He said last week, he tried to see if he could boost our numbers by slipping extra cash in the clown bank. It didn't work. In fact, it had the opposite effect as customers began ordering very little. He stopped topping up, but that did nothing to change the consequences of his cheating.

Yesterday, when the final customer walked in, he couldn't help but slide our drinks menu closer to her when she walked up to the register. He said he was subtle and didn't even speak, but she ordered a dozen iced coffees, and that must have broken the rule.

That was it. I told them we were done with the ritual. We were going to break the clown bank, take the money, and try to rebuild our business the honest and normal way. Everyone agreed. 

Grabbing my rolling pin, I placed the clown bank on my kitchen table and shattered it.

Ash.

All our savings were ash and molten lumps of metal.

I had goosebumps as I stared in disbelief, watching George dig through the charcoal pile and whisper "no, no, no". Panicking, I fumbled with the keys and unlocked the cash box. 

Ash.

Everything we made today. Gone.

Zeina shouted every explicative she knew at George while Chloe broke down and cried. Norm comforted his sister, but in his eyes was helpless defeat that matched mine.

At least the ritual was over.

And for our greed, we'd gotten our just desserts.

I'm crushed.

We failed you, Nikki. 

We all went home, agreeing that tomorrow would be our last day running *Café Nicolette*. I'm sorry, sis. We tried.


**Friday, October 20, 2023**

Dear Nikki,

There might be hope for us yet. George spent all night researching rituals, and he might have found one that can help us negotiate with whatever entity we were dealing with. He said we could get our savings back and then some.

Norm and Chloe were on board, but Zeina was incredulous. I didn't blame her. I couldn't believe I was agreeing myself, especially with George, and *especially* after what happened yesterday, but the temptation of realizing your dream was too much to resist.

Zeina quit, but the rest of us are back at the cafe now. George is setting up, and we have to wait until exactly noon to perform the ritual. If it's a success, I'll update. If not … then I guess we'll reunite sooner than expected, sis. 

I love you.
