Work Camp Northern Alberta 

I live in a camp in northern alberta for oil sand workers. This camp could be considered a 1 star hotel or a 5 star prison.. it’s not for everyone but the money makes up for it. 

everyone is made aware upon arrival to site that if you have poor mental health this is not for you. but this story has nothing to do with my mental health.

In a lot of ways camp has been good for me it’s a dry camp so i can’t drink or even leave due to how far it is from civilization. it keeps me in a routine and all your meals are made and lunches are ready. you just work and sleep. 

A lot of people i know has mentioned they find their camp room creepy at one spacific camp. I’ve never had a problem but this week has been different. we all hear the stories about people killing themselves in camp. This being due to the inevitable depression of being trapped in extremely unfavourable conditions for long periods of time. It’s enough to make you go insane..

 Everyone says the camp is haunted but not i think i finally believe them. 

 Over the last week i’ve been feeling very uneasy in my room. The temperature is going from being so hot it’s like a wood sauna (this is not an over exaggeration i had to plug the heater vent in the ceiling) to being so cold i was shivering for no apparent reason. i just chopped this up to the camp being shitty and not well insulated. 

last night i woke up to the loudest scream i’ve ever heard in my life. it was a distorted voice saying “WHAT THE FUCKKKKK” and i JUMPED up in a sitting position in bed and directly across from me is the door to my tiny room and i seen a man standing there and he was about 7’ tall with a plaid shirt, work pants, a ball hat. he was holding his hand out shaking and had no face like zero facial features. I just kind of said “AEHH” and back against the wall of my headboard and turned on the overhead lamp right behind me and then he just kind of faded away. 

i was very confused and left my light in and went back to sleep. when u woke up the light was still on so i know it was real.

you would think i would be running out of the room terrified but something about the “what the fuck”, his appearance and the way he held out his hand kind of made me feel bad for him. like he was confused and wasn’t there to hurt me.

pretty sure nobody i’ve told so far believes me except one friend. they just think i’ve had a bad dream but i know what i saw. 

would you work in the camps in northern alberta ? what really makes so many people kill themselves.
