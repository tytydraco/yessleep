“MOVE MOVE MOVE” is all I heard at the battle field during World War 2 and it makes me wish I had taken that awful gun making job that would have kept me from getting drafted. All of a sudden I had heard a distant whistle so I turned to my best friend and asked “Hey do you hear that?” And before he could even answer BOOM they had launched a middle over at our base killing everyone but me.

It has now been 3 years since the war and I can’t even hear a plate drop or toy soldiers playing on screen without having flashbacks it doesn’t concern me though it’s just part of the job I guess

It has now been 6 years since the war I have started hearing voices tell me to do the most awful things to my family I might get it checked out, I have also been seeing strange figures in my room but maybe I’m just paranoid 

H-Hello someone help me I’m losing my mind! The voices the voices “KILL THEM JOHN KILL YOUR FAMILY TAKE THEM OUT” all in a demonic voice I’m actually considering doing it the figures in my closet get closer every year and the doctor just shrugged me off saying it was part of the war I guess I will try to sleep it off

I don’t know how long it’s been I haven’t slept the voices have not stopped and they are telling me to harm myself now I can’t deal with this I’m going to do it next year I swear hopefully the voices stop all I can think about is my bestfriend.

“Hello John I’m doctor Cole what can I do for you today” “êöûÿhabchehw” “John I can’t help you if you won’t talk to me” I shake my head quickly asking of my whereabouts “John this is the psych ward you killed them John” “Killed who” Your family John this is the first time I’ve had you responsive” “No you can’t be serious” my head turned and felt like it twisted inside my brain before i suddenly passed

“Jakwkdumdndjwjwoqoaisjnnxjejsisikakwk”

There is writing on the wall in blood “John is ours!”

The sirens and lights arrive at the scene shortly “what’s his condition” “DOA sir” “I have never seen a case like this dude skinned his family alive then clawed all his skin off I almost want to puke”

Static can be heard as John proceeds skinning the guards and putting their flesh on himself.
