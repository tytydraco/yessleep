I was a 19 year old teenager who was the product of a prank by two teenagers, my then 15 year old mom and 17 year old dad. Throughout my life as I grew up I noticed that it was not normal for my parents to be separated and not even talk to each other, I grew up with my grandparents on my dad's side who today I love and love very much for all they have done for me.

Continuing with my story, all my childhood I spent trying to receive even a little love from my dad, I did what he asked me, I tried to be the best so he would show me a little bit of his love, but in my eyes it never worked, when I was little he started dating the one who is now my stepmother, for privacy reasons we will call her Marta.

When I was about 13 years old I began to feel jealousy and hatred towards Marta because she did have the love that I tried so hard to desire from my father, but she always had it without any struggle, as the years went by I understood that my father would never love me and that he only called me "Daughter" because my grandparents forced him to. One of the moments that hurt me the most was the day of my high school graduation, during the whole ceremony he looked very upset and serious as if he didn't want to be there, in the pictures he always looks serious and upset, that day was the first day I could take pictures with both my parents. Can you believe it when I was 17 years old I was able to have a picture with both my parents together.

Another thing that hurts me a lot is that on my dad's or Marta's social networks, they always upload photos of my cousins ​​but I don't appear in any of them, and when I go out there always have to be more people around, it's as if they were trying to hide, something that completely destroys me because I had a slight hope that now that my father was getting married he could be part of his family, that he would love me and that we would be happy but it was the opposite, they got married and They went to live in another place, they didn't ask me if I wanted to go live with them or if they wanted me to be present, if before I hardly spoke to my dad now we are practically like two strangers that are only united by blood and that's it.

Going to the present time, my dad has been married to my stepmother for almost two years, little by little I was accepting that I couldn't compete with Marta, it was clear that my dad only looked at me as a nuisance and sometimes I see how Marta doesn't feel so comfortable with my presence so in order not to bother my father or my stepmother I decided to keep a lot of distance for the good of all. Recently it was my stepmother's baby shower since she is pregnant with my future little sister, when I heard the news I literally cried with joy, I LOVE and will always love that little girl who is on the way, for a moment I thought that with my little sister My dad would finally take me as part of his family, but things remain the same, he doesn't even ask me how I feel, or if I want to be with him.

To finish, I just want to say that I feel a little jealous for my sister because she does have our father's love, that love that I tried to have for years and could never have. Don't get me wrong, I love her and I will always love her, but I can't help but feel jealous of her because I love her from the beginning and she only sees me as a nuisance.
