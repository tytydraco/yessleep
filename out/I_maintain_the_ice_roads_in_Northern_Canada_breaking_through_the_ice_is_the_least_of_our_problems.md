I won't bore you with the backstory of how I ended up in one of the most desolate places on earth, it's not relevant and it would take way too long. All you need to know is I found myself falling on some hard times and needing to lay low for a while so getting as far away from civilization as possible seemed like a good idea. The pay they were offering for a mere 4 months of work was crazy and I'd be able to survive for easily the rest of the year off of it until my troubles blew over so it was an easy decision to pack up all of my stuff and make the 30 hour drive from Vancouver up to Yellowknife.

To say that drive was a slog would the understatement of the millennium. Things start to get pretty desolate after Prince George and it's all trees until you reach Fort St. John where for some reason there's a bunch of farmland way up north on the border with Alberta. After that Fort Nelson is really the last major town you'll pass before you start the grueling 11 hour stretch up to Yellowknife. There are small settlements and indigenous communities along the mostly dirt highway but they are few and far between. For the most part you're on your own up there. Much to the relief of my back and my rusty old Ford pickup truck, once you reach the Mackenzie Highway the road is paved the rest of the way to Yellowknife and it's a much smoother ride.

Upon arrival I checked into a little motel, as my permanent accommodations were not yet ready according to my employers, and went out to explore the town a bit. While the Northwest Territories are quite isolated and barren the city of Yellowknife itself is surprisingly populated and bustling. Despite being just below the Arctic Circle and a good 10 hours from the next nearest town the city resembles any other Canadian city which really threw me off. I was shocked to find a Boston Pizza of all things while driving around downtown and decided to stop in for some dinner.

Since I was alone I sat down at the bar and began surveying the menu the bartender handed me. After I'd ordered these two guys down the bar who looked like they had just gotten off work judging by the high-vis jackets draped over the back of their chairs struck up a conversation with me. "You new around here?" The first guy asked. "Yeah I've never seen you before either." The second one said. "Um, yeah, just got in the afternoon," I said trying not to make eye contact. I'd seen enough movies to know that blue collar men in a bar pointing out that you're new to town usually means trouble. Fortunately I was completely wrong. "Well welcome to Yellowknife," the first guy said reaching out to shake my hand. "The name's Larry, and this is my buddy Jim." The second guy reached out to shake my hand as well." Pleasure to meet you," he said. "So what brings you up here?"

"I'm working on the ice road this winter," I said. "Ah so you're a trucker?" Larry asked seeming impressed. "Well not exactly," I admitted. "Honestly I'm not sure what exactly I'll be doing, this guy Mike that my friend knows just said they needed some help to maintain the road this winter, I'm assuming that mostly means plowing snow." Jim perked up a little when I said this. "Mike McCann?" He asked. "Yeah, that's the guy." "Oh I know Mike real well, we went to school together. He's been looking after that ice road practically ever since then. He's a real nice guy you'll like working for him just don't let him scare you off at first." Larry chuckled at this and said: "Yeah he's the only guy I've ever known who can make an Irish accent intimidating."

After dinner I explored the town a little more before returning to the hotel. I had expected to find this place a barren wasteland and in some way to be fair it was, but there was a certain beauty to it and the people here all seemed so friendly I was liking this place a lot more than I thought I would. Oh how I wish I could look at this place with that blissful naivety again.

The next morning I pulled up in front of the large warehouse the company was using as a shop for their equipment. Mike met me outside and shook my hand. He was just like Jim and Larry had described him. Tall, probably in his late 60s or early 70s, but still with lots of hair left, and yes somehow had a slightly intimidating Irish accent. He started showing me around the place and the various trucks and machines that they used to build and maintain the ice road every year. There was a bunch of big dump trucks with plows, a couple of graders and this weird articulated snowcat like machine that I had never seen before. "That's the Hagglund Bandvagn," he said. "It was built for the Swedish Military but we use it to check the ice thickness. It's got a sonar unit on it that tells us where the ice is too thin and where we need to flood, and don't worry it's fully amphibious so if you break through she floats." 

I looked over at a line of pickup trucks, some with regular tires and some where the wheels had been replaced with triangular crawler tracks. The last couple trucks in the line had a yellow stripe across the side and said SECURITY in large black letters on the doors. "What are those for?" I asked pointing at them. "Well most of those are just used to get equipment around out there but I see you eyeing up the security trucks, well this road does supply diamond mines so you can never be too careful of bandits." I stared at him blankly for a second then he burst out laughing. "I'm just messing with you, the RCMP doesn't come out on the ice roads so we kind of have our own police force. Speeding is a bit more of a concern out there because you can actually damage the ice surface if you drive too fast, they keep all the truckers in line, respond to emergencies and deal with, outside threats." He said trailing off. I didn't like the sound of that. "Outside threats?" I said nervously. "Oh yes, bears, wolves, that sort of thing," Mike said quickly. The way he said it didn't have me entirely convinced that was all he meant but at this point I really had no reason to doubt him.

The first couple of weeks were grueling work. We were out on the ice every day patrolling the route with the Hagglund and the tracked pickup trucks. If the ice was found to be too thin we would get out the ice augers and drill holes in the ice where we would then lower down a hose and pump water from underneath the ice up on top where it would then freeze and thicken the road. We did this on repeat until finally the sonar readings showed sufficient ice thickness, about 70 centimeters, across the entire route. You can imagine how long this took given that this machine doesn't travel very fast and the entire ice road is over 600 kilometres long. Finally the end of January came and the road was ready to open for truck traffic. Officially known as the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road, for the 10 weeks or so that it would be open this road is the only land link to the diamond mines in the north so the truckers that come up here are on a tight schedule to get all the supplies up there before the ice melts in the spring. Once the road was open we were pretty much in maintenance mode. Checking ice thickness and plowing snow so it wasn't nearly as intense as actually building the road.

One night I was out on the grader pushing snow near the halfway point at Lockhart Lake when I came across something odd. They were faint in the fresh snow but it looked like there were tire tracks heading off the marked road farther out on the lake. The ice out there wasn't thickened like the road was and who knows what kind of shape it was in so who would be crazy enough to drive out there? I stopped my machine and looked out at the tracks. They seemed to just disappear a few hundred feet off the road. I called it in on the radio and the security team said they would come check it out and to stay put in the machine so they could find it. My worry was that a trucker could have gotten lost in a blizzard and ended up off the road onto thin ice and and gone in the drink.

The security truck pulled up almost an hour later pulling a trailer with a couple of snowmobiles on it. By now the tracks were almost completely buried in fresh snow but they were still visible enough. "Well we got a call from the mines saying one of their shipments didn't arrive." One of the guys said to me grimly. "I think you might've found what happened to it." They strapped on some snowshoes and began following the tire tracks while prodding at the snow with a large metal bar. Their flashlight beams were almost out of sight when one of them yelled back to me. "We found a hole!" They came back a few minutes later and told me they had dropped a magnet down there and there was definitely a vehicle in there. This is where I learned one of the harsh realities of the ice road. If you go through there's basically no way to recover your vehicle or your body. The water's too cold for divers to hook up any kind of cables and even then the ice wouldn't support the necessary equipment, and this area is completely inaccessible in the summertime. We all paid our respects, the security team called it in and then we all just went back to work. 

It was the weirdest feeling just pretending like nothing had happened and it ate me up for days afterwards. The official story was a trucker got lost in the storm and veered too far off the road leading to his untimely demise at the bottom of Lockhart Lake but something didn't sit right with me. The truckers that come up here are the best in the world and all of them know how to handle this road and they would just stop and sit tight if the visibility got too bad. Mike's mention of external threats kept ringing through my head. Maybe they swerved to avoid a polar bear or something? Or was there something he wasn't telling me?

A few days later I came to the shop to find one of the truckers screaming at a representative from the mining company. He was shouting something I couldn't make out until I turned off my truck and opened the door. "Fuck you man!" He yelled pointing at the man in a suit. "Fuck you if you think I'm going back out on that road, not for you greedy bastards, not for anyone else, I'm done." He threw what looked like a truck's logbook on the ground and stormed off back to his truck. I've never seen a semi peel out of a parking lot so fast in my life. 

"What the hell was that about?" Mike asked coming out of the building and pointing to the rapidly disappearing flatbed semi truck tearing down the road. "I don't know," shrugged the man in the suit. "Says he saw something weird out on the ice, won't go back there again, I don't know what he's talking about." "Well some people aren't cut out for the northern life," Mike said in a strange tone. "Anyways what can we help you with?" He asked the man in the suit. The man pulled out his phone and showed us a picture that had been emailed to him by one of the truckers when they had reached the mine. It was of a grizzly bear laying dead in the middle of the road, its head was missing and there was blood everywhere. "Jesus," Mike mumbled. "Yeah it's kinda nasty," the man said putting his phone away. "Figured one of you guys probably hit it with a plow or something, now look I know shit happens up here but bears are still a protected species so it might be in your best interests to get that cleaned up before anyone else sees it." Mike got this weird worried expression on his face and told the man he'd deal with it. 

Mike gave me my tasks for the day and then he disappeared in one of the security trucks heading up the road. I found the whole situation rather odd, bears typically hibernate this time of year and while I suppose it wasn't totally unreasonable to think that the noise from the trucks could've woken one up and it had gotten in the way of some heavy machinery, something felt wrong to me based on the way Mike was acting.

After I finished my jobs for the day I was sent back up to one of the maintenance camps near the far end of the ice road. Until this point I had mostly worked the Yellowknife side of the road so I was looking forward to seeing more of it and being even farther from civilization. It was getting dark by the time I had almost reached the camp and the snow was beginning to fall heavily. My truck rocked in the wind as a semi rolled past me out of the blizzard. In the headlights I saw the sign telling me I was only 5 kilometers from my destination but as I looked back towards the road ahead I saw something else which made me slow down. There were lights flashing ahead and as I drew closer I realized it was almost all of the security pickup trucks parked on the side of the road. Two of them had empty snowmobile trailers and there were snowmobile tracks leading off the road towards land. I thought that maybe this was where the bear had been killed and they were just dealing with it so I began to speed back up. No sooner had I done this when suddenly I had to swerve around something that was running, no almost floating across the road. 

My truck spun out on the ice and I bounced off a snowbank and I found myself facing back towards the way I had come. In front of me there was this thing on the road that I don't even know how to describe. It was about 10 feet tall, cone shaped and covered in thick white fur. Its face strongly resembled a plague doctor's mask with a long beak that protruded from it. It was also white but lacked any fur making it distinct from the rest of its body. Its eyes were solid black and I figured about the size of bowling balls. They burned into my soul as it turned to look directly at me, and then it began walking towards me. It had no obvious limbs but by the way it was moving I could tell there must be legs somewhere under all that thick white fur.

I put the truck in reverse an began backing down the road away from the thing coming towards me. It was beginning to disappear into the snow when suddenly another one of those creatures started coming at me from the side. The slippery ice made it much easier to swing the truck around and take off again going forwards and as I did so I began to see more black eyes peering out of the blizzard at me. "Fuck the speed limit" I thought to myself as I floored the accelerator. Falling through the ice and drowning in the icy waters would be better than whatever those things would do to me. I finally began losing sight of them in the snow when suddenly I came up on a bend in the road. I was going way too fast to make the turn and skidded off the road into the deep snow. The truck stopped almost instantly and the tires shot loose snow straight up in the air. I tried to reverse out but I couldn't, I was stuck. I looked up in the mirror and the taillights were now illuminating at least 10 pairs of large black eyes slowly coming up behind me. 

I locked the doors of the truck not knowing if it would offer any protection. I had no idea what these things were capable of. They didn't seem to be able to move very fast, maybe I could outrun them? No that would be crazy in this weather. They were still getting closer at the same slow consistent pace. I could now see teeth on their long beaks as they started opening and closing them just as slowly as they were moving. I thought for sure I was done for when I heard the sound of snowmobiles approaching from behind the creatures. A gunshot rang out and the creatures all began screaming and took off a bit faster but still very slowly away from the road.

Then the white Ski-Doo Expeditions I recognized as belonging to the security team pulled up behind my truck. One of them stayed while the rest turned after the creatures and followed them into the snow. The man on the back of the snowmobile hopped off and removed his helmet. I recognized him immediately as Mike. "What the hell were those things?" I asked flinging my door open and jumping out of the truck. "We don't know," Mike said a lot more calmly than you would expect given the situation. "We sort of jokingly call them Furries, but we have no idea what they really are. They seem to just materialize out of the snow whenever it gets bad enough. You can't kill them, believe me we've tried, but thankfully they scare pretty easily and they can't seem to move too quickly. I think because they're so slow they can only feed on hibernating animals, and well, unfortunately they've been known to attack sleeping truckers at the rest camps along the road when they get too close to the road." "So that's the external threats you were talking about?" I surmised. "Yeah," Mike said grimly. "That's the real reason for the security team, they herd these things away from the road to keep the truckers safe. As long as you're awake and moving those creatures can't get you, they're too slow, but if you sleep unguarded rest assured they'll come for you." Rest assured yeah right I thought to myself. "That truck that went through the ice a few weeks ago," Mike continued, "probably swerved off the road to avoid these things and ended up in the drink." He then stopped and looked at me probably shaking in my boots. "Come on let's get you back to base" he said.

As I predicted I did not get much sleep that night. My dreams were haunted by the image of those creatures closing in on me from all sides. I got up around 3am and dragged a large desk in my room in front of the door. Over the rest of the winter I learned to cope with my fears and how to, for lack of a better term, coexist with these things out on the ice road. As longs as you could keep moving you were safe and for the most part the security team kept the creatures mostly out of sight. Every now and then I would see one staring at me from the edge of the snowstorm, I even swore I saw one just standing in the middle of the road in Yellowknife one night walking home from the bar. It's been years since I got out of there and moved back closer to Vancouver but even to this day whenever there's a blizzard I can't help but think of those huge black eyes staring at me from somewhere behind the falling snow. I'm sitting here now in my apartment typing this out with the TV on in the background and funny enough Ice Road Truckers just came on. If only the History Channel knew how much worse it is up there than what they show.
