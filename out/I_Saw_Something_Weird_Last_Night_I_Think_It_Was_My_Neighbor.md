Hi, I decided to post here because I didn't know where else to put it. It seems like the place to go when you see something weird so I think you all might at least be interested. 

Well I guess there isn't any other way but to just say it.

I have been on the hunt for a new place to stay after moving out of my parents home, but nothing in my area was below $2,700 a month too rent.  My job at this local burger place doesn't even pay me that. So I needed to look elsewhere. Rent here in Florida is hell I tell you. 

Then I find this place that is dirt cheap, now I initially thought that there was something wrong with the place so I wanted to go and look in person myself. So I got in contact with the landlord and he showed me the property. It was nice, quiet, the place was surrounded by trees and undeveloped land. The only other house near by was the neighbors. 

They seemed pretty normal, at the time anyway. Mid Thirties and seemingly single, almost like a sitcom character. I'm going to call him Ned for now.  
  
 During the House tour I did notice things right away. The trash bins had locks on them, I assumed it was for racoons but it was still pretty extreme. The windows also had these weird dream catcher things hanging above them from the inside. And it was on every window. There was also a panic room hidden inside a closet with a thick door on it and a numbered lock. I asked if there was any crime in the area and the neighbor told me they didn't have any break in's this far out. 

So after the tour we shook and I agreed to move in on the next day. Before I left though he handed me a list of rules to follow when living there. There wasn't much just a few things. 

Keep the Trash locked and take them out to the side of the road every Wednesday. 

Don't make changes to the house without permission of the landlord.

NEVER remove the wards (That would be those dream catcher things) off the windows.

Memorize the number key to the panic room in case of a break in and to not call 911 before calling the landlord. 

Last was to not stay out at night nor let anyone in at night, no exceptions. 

Some of these rules made sense too me while others I was left scratching my head. Why should I not call 911 first before a break in. That part was real shady too me. But I didn't worry about it because... Well not really sure actually.   
  
Next day I moved in and I saw Ned waving at me. I waved back at Ned and we had a brief conversation. He told me not many stay long on the property after the first night. He explains it was due too bears in the area and city folk couldn't really handle it. I guess that's why the trash has locks on them. 

Honestly I don't think bears would be enough to deter people from such a place like this especially for the price. But I'm not most people I guess. 

I'm not going to bore you much with what I did that day It was mostly moving in all my things and watching some Youtube when I got tired. 

When night fell I was just staying up watching movies when I hear a strange noise. I thought it was the movie so I paused to see and the noise was still there. It sounded like someone was outside knocking on my window. But like metal knocking on glass. 

I go too look to see where or what was making the noise. So I turn on the light and I honestly felt my body go cold at the sight of it. 

It was this... Thing.

It was misshapen and wrong, it was large as well. It only had a single eye it looked into the window with. Its face had no other features. It was tall as it hunched over looking into the window and the rest of the home. The Thing was a dark bluish color and the metal tapping was caused by a strange metal wand he carried. like he was prodding for a weak point. 

Tapping, prodding the window for something. Like he was trying to get in.

It looked at me for a brief moment, studying me with that large eye. Then went back to tapping the window. As if i simply wasn't there. 

It was at this point I turned the light off and entered the panic room. what else was I supposed to do!? How else are you supposed to respond to seeing... That!

I stayed in there the entire night, I couldn't even sleep. I just heard whatever was out there continuing to tap on every window and door around my house from the outside.   
  
It was terrifying to go through. I thought that at any minute I was going to hear the shattering of glass and that Thing was going to be outside the panic room waiting for me. But that didn't happen. 

Morning came and when I worked up the courage to go look it was gone. I went all around the house looking for if it had left tracks or anything and I couldn't even find a single footprint. 

Then there was Ned, up and early mowing his lawn like it was a normal day. So I asked him. Honestly I looked terrible I had not gotten any sleep and I bet I looked like a goblin man but he just said hi and answered me with a "Sorry I didn't see anything." How would you not see a blue cyclops tapping at you're window at night! He wasn't even concerned! Just smiling away! 

I don't have evidence nor proof but if you ask me I think he is not admitting to the whole truth. Its in fact at this point I noticed he didn't have any form of lock on his trash cans. 

I can literally see him from my window as I'm writing just watering his garden without a care in the world at 6:38 PM EST. Its almost like he's pretending to be human. I can't prove it but I think my Neighbor is the Thing wearing some kind of human body suit!

I can't confirm this I've only been here for two days but I'm already weirded out. 

I don't know what to do honestly, should I ask my landlord or call the cops? Neither would work I think because I sound crazy! I guess I'm going to just try and take a picture of this thing or at least keep a written log. Who knows maybe I might be posting here again in the future. 

If you guys have any clue or have advice with dealing with less than natural occurrences please let me know. 

I guess all there is to do now is too wait.
