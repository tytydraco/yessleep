I have failed as a therapist, but not as much as I have failed as a person. I let it happen, a psychosis had taken over me - An excuse that could be, right? I could blame my mental state, I could say I was depressed and that would take the fall for me. It’s worked for other people, would it work for me? I don’t know. As I write my recollection thoroughly, my fingers cramping from all the clicking and clacking, a small tear forms from my eye; it moistens my dry skin, sliding down slowly, eventually grazing my neck just barely. This madness, the one I let happen, I am responsible. When Alice followed the white rabbit, was she insane? No, she was just curious. When Alice drank from the mysterious bottles was she crazy? No, she was desperate to find a way out.



Madness, yes, madness surrounds my guilty conscience. A thunder shrinking and enlarging at will. A constant presence, never at a distance. Always present, never to let me forget.



I was wearing shoddy work boots, sliding through the snow with ease as I walked alone on a pitch black night. My breathing was rough, frost forming in the air as I struggled to breathe - You couldn’t see my face if you tried; it was covered in a thick scarf and parka. A lone waltz to nowhere important, just my house - my normal, bland house. The moon hung high, so pale that it was barely there. If the moon was a person they’d be dead, but their death wouldn’t be quick. A slow decay of a body for all the world to see. A sight to behold, a true sight to see, but it is the horror I see when I close my eyes. My face in a mirror is enough to make my stomach churn; I can no longer make eye contact, even with myself.



I can’t remember what happened next. In one theory, I made it back safely without anything going on. In another, I was dragged back. All I knew was one minute I was shoddily awake, trudging through the snow, the next I was in my bed. I don’t think I would want to know how I made it back - it’s basically non-important.



The next day was standard enough. I went to work at my town’s hospital - Due to the town being only 700 people, our hospital just housed all the necessary medical stuff in one building. I sat in my chair taking notes in my notebook, the pen danced writing each word that was needed. I was treating a young man, Colin Bedlam -  an average looking young man in his late teens. He had long bushy brown hair, he was wearing his coat, a parka that hides his figure - Although, even with it, I could tell he doesn’t eat enough.



Colin spoke gently, calm as ever, “Same thoughts as before. Same ideas.”



“Any weapons in particular?” I inquired.



Colin jostled around in his seat, slightly uncomfortable, and passive aggressively he answered, “Not important.”



Harkening back to our previous sessions, I figured I knew what these thoughts were about, “And these thoughts of violence, are they still related to thoughts of sex?” 



“Uh, that's a tough question.”



Colin laughed and paced in his chair, “Hmm…”



Whatever happened, it was like the angle changed with what he said next, “Sex is a weird thing to discuss, no? What makes one fantasy worse than another? I think that a lot of people like violence sexually, and in an awful world, a bad bad world - Bad people are born, you know, through violent sex. Wicked sex makes wicked types.”



He recoiled, though he was righteous and hopeful. He hoped that he wasn’t the only one, that he wasn’t an outcast. 



Breathing slow, his voice steady and well spoken, “I believe that most people are capable of murder. It's mostly because they choose not to, that they are more virtuous than most claim. Like they are bound by a responsibility, a covenant, now neglected, and that would make murder an absurd sport of self-destruction.”



Curious, I wanted more of an explanation, “Can you elaborate?”



“It's hard, I mean, most people don't realize they are murderers. So they might try to escape the label by claiming self-defense, or by claiming that they can't help themselves.” He put his hand over his heart. “Now to be frank, I believe all men to be murderers. That's the only thing that keeps us going. It's sort of a survival instinct. That's all we have, to survive. There is nothing else to live for.”



Again, it was like the angle changed. 



“And what about your parents, do you get along with your parents?”



Colin’s face flipped from a nonchalant teen to a bitter man in an instant, “Not the best relationship. My father, he works too much. My mother can get rather angry if I talk back to her, so she's not always here for me.”



“That can be hell, Colin. I understand what it’s like.”



Colin grew curious in a judgmental way, “What do you mean by ‘hell’?” I couldn’t answer him, at least in a way that didn’t make the situation worse.



Our therapy session ended pretty shortly after that.



At midnight, I was in my bed, naked. I was the only one in there, but it was almost like there was no life, an almost empty bedroom. I felt something slowly coming in the shadows, the windows reflected the moon’s light, but it wasn’t enough light. In the darkness there was something beckoning me to it. In an almost trancelike state, I got out of bed, still naked, exiting the room, walking down the stairs -  the shadow guided me like the Pied Piper to my mini library. Surrounding the bookcases, in the middle, was a painting of the landscape of hell - With a huge fire using bright colors, I stood and looked at it -  As if separated from my old love, I approached the Fire. 



Then - A succession of vocal strings moving in and out of music. Animals cry. There is no reason why. Then another sound, much closer - the scraping of something like nails on a chalkboard. I looked away from the painting, and when I did, I was a tiny figure in what seemed like an industrial forest - steam pipes blowing hot steam with a thunderous boom - big boilers standing tall like great oaks, the floor became vents - a dark forest of iron. However, in the distance I could see what appeared to be someone else. Yes, that is definitely a person.



I move towards them and it appears they do the same - they were hidden by the hot steam and darkness. Despite this, I trusted them on instinct alone - my goodhearted intentions were well intentioned, but it did not seem they felt the same - brandishing a knife - they slashed at me like a savage animal - making inhuman grunting sounds, at some points, squealing like a pig.

I was in shock and tripped over myself. Was I going to die? I didn’t know. I didn’t know where I was or why I was there. Nonetheless, this threat was very real. Were they on drugs? They kept coming at me mindlessly, piercing my trembling, soft flesh - it squelched and splashed and I groaned in pain. I kicked them off of me, and in the miniscule amount of light, I saw my attacker’s face; it was Colin. 



Suddenly, I was sent back to my kitchen, my stove was in flames, the smoke alarming blaring. What? What is happening? Despite my confusion, I put out the fire and put the kitchen’s window down to let the smoke out. In the window’s reflection, I saw something strange - Where I was stabbed, it was there and it wasn’t. It looked like I was fully healed but still had a reminder of my stabbing. How? Whatever the case, I went back to bed.



In our next session, Colin looked uneasy. However, he has yet to be screened for depression, so I wanted to check for that today, “Thoughts of self-harm, suicide?”



Colin’s hands are clasped, uncomfortably he rolls up his sleeves, showing his jagged scars, “Well, I’m not an expert or anything.”



“On?”



Colin stared at me like he analyzing something, “On suicide.” He answered. Colin shrugs his shoulders in a helpless gesture.



I jot down some notes, “How has your sleep been? Are you staying asleep or half n' half?”



“I’m a light sleeper.”



Some more notes, “Do you dream or do you not remember if you do?”



Colin rested back in his chair, “I do dream. A recurring one about a boiler room, large pipes and steam coming from every end. And a man is there with me, he's trying to kill me with this knife.” Colin mimes the size of the knife, “About this big. But I fend him off before he can do anything. And then the dream ends.” 



I was surprised by Colin’s answer. It’s one for one with the weird dream I had last night. “And this man, does he have any recognizable features? Is he someone you know or knew?”



I had a feeling Colin would say he saw me in his dream, but surprisingly, “No.” Colin said casually, “No, I don’t know this man.”



I have a strong feeling he was lying, but I will not force him to answer; it could just be a coincidence. There was a long pause.



Our time was about to come to an end soon, but I had just one more question, “What are you feeling in this dream?” Colin didn’t answer and just waited until he could leave.



That night, I was in the kitchen again. There was something about the fire painting that wasn’t there before that called to me - but that led me to the kitchen’s flame, so I don’t what I was trying to test - my

eyes were transfixed at the top of the blue flames coming from the stove. I held out my hand to the fire like cupping the face of a child. My hand burnt, the flesh crisping - I was in pain, but I felt calm, collected even.

Suddenly the telephone rang, ringing very loudly. I took my hand out of the fire, turned off the stove, and went to answer it. I picked the phone and put it to my ear, “Hello…”



The sound of the caller’s voice was very loud - speaking in different voices, changing from one to another. Some of the sounds were inhuman and mixed with growls and howls. A soft scream is heard, then quickly turns into a pained, choking scream - suddenly the voice changes to a man's, quietly pleading, “Help! Leave me alone! Please! God! Please! Leave me alone!”



I was confused and frightened by the call, “What do you want? I think you have the wrong number.”



A muffled voice could be heard, it became a woman's voice, crying, pleading with me for something I could not provide, “Listen! I can't do this! I’m going to hurt someone. I need help, please!”



“Who are you?” 



“The woman begins to cry hoarsely - the voice becomes manly, harsh and ugly - horrified, “Stop! Stop doing this to me!” Gasping and snoring sounds are heard - then the girl screams again.



I was in a panic, what could I do? Who was I speaking to? “Jesus Christ. Who are you? I’m a therapist, I can help. Just tell me who you are!”



A man starts huffing, puffing in between breaths - then yells, “ Listen fucker! STOP! STOP DOIN’ THIS TO ME!”



“Sir, sir, please calm down. What is happening where you’re at? Are you in immediate danger?”



The voice became low pitched - manic - sloppy - slurring words, “You have to die! You have to die!” Then faintly crying, “You won’t stop, please just stop! You have to die!”



“Who are you talking about? Sir? Sir?”



The line ended. The faint hum of a cut off call ringed in my ear. I looked at the phone and then put it up. Fuck it, I’m going to bed.
