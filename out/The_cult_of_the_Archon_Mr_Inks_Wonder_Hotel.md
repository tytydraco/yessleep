"What?!" I stood out of my chair, nearly knocking down to the ground. "Why didn't she tell me?!" David took another deep breath, then exhales the sadness of air. "If I was her, I would've done the same thing. You see, our great ancestor, Isabelle Cooper, was one of the disciples of the goddess; the goddess you've already seen at the mansion. The goddess passed along a great bloodline of power to her offspring, since its chosen for an important role. A power none of us understands, except Malka does. Throughout the history of the Cooper family, they've kidnapped dozens of lives and sacrificed them before the goddess, without leaving any evidence behind. We've been doing this for many generations, and no one has ever decided to destroy the cult. For crying out loud, nobody believes it. That's the reason why we got away with it."

"Why didn't she just tell me sooner?"

"Even if she tried, you wouldn't believe it, no matter how hard you try." I don't find what he said to make any sense. If they've done it for so long, then they should've been caught. But why haven't they? Every trace of evidence they made behind should be obvious it was the cult. But somehow, it wasn't. If she had told me, I would've done something, even move out to another country, if that's how much that can take to protect my family.

I looked out to the broken window, watching people hammering nails into wood and move their mouths fluidly. Every person wore clothes that haven't been washed for over a week or two. Their boots shine like steel, belonging to a world full of steam and rusted bronze. Some had the smiles that share their joyful moments, and others had the face that grieves for redemption.

I turn my head to face David with his hands clasped together. "Tell me what I have to do to get my daughter back." David shifts his chair forward, with a smile that shares comfort and delight. "To get your daughter back, you need to face the 3 of my brothers first.

"The first will be Mr. Ink. He lives in a messed up fleshy cartoon world of his. He'll be at the hotel called 'Mr. Ink's Wonder Hotel', and it's full of impossible worlds you've never believed it can fit. Once you go in there, there's no going back. You'll enter different levels, and each one will have their own unique areas.

"And I must remind you, if you've ever met a watcher around deep hallways or dark areas, don't make a sound and slowly move away from its range."

"What are the watchers?" The watchers seems to be interesting. While he spoke those last words, his voice was direct and alert, with eyes that gave me a sign to remember.

His smile disappeared, with eyes that stare into my soul, giving me a warning not to go deep. His brows narrowed with trauma, whilst the corners of his brows shook of nightmares from the dark. "Trust me, you don't want to know what kind of monsters they are." At that moment, I felt my body shook at the message. I looked away to my reflection at the liquid to find my eyes shine like the dark night itself. There was no light, not even a single speck of glow, just a deep husk consuming what's real.

I shook my head, defying my reflection from my very own mind and soul. He sat relaxed on his chair, fill of relief that he marked a warning into my mind; His voice of the message being the flag to raise as a reminder. "The other one of my brothers is Nyarlathotep. Nyarlathotep is a cover name he gives himself of course. You've probably heard of Howard Philips's works. Originally, his name is, unknown. I ain't got his real name, neither does malka know. Don't let that statue of himself fool you, that's just the technology to communicate simultaneously. He lives in the spaces above, a prison full of eldritch entities, who sought for power. Many came from different worlds, such as a fighting tournament, a government's secret prison, the streets, wherever. You best find something useful before you enter, otherwise you're going to be in a worse fate than death."

A prison in space might sound mysterious for its purpose. It could be that it's for a war we don't know will come or used as resources to feed whatever the hell kind of entity. Of course, prisons are supposed to imprison criminals who'd done illegal activity that could endanger society. Every prisoner has their own unique ways of crime. One who had a scar etched on his eye, a scar that would be caused by an explosion from a grenade or a murderer with a twisted knife from a broken down kitchen. He would look like he could cause much damage by murdering his victims or buying into a gang in the shadows. You get the idea.

"The last but not least is Dr. Fitz; one of the most dangerous and mind fucked brother I ever had. He lives at the capital city of his domain. And by domain, I mean the entire planet earth. He controls the supply, energy, military, money, material, everything. Whatever people you meet, they won't be friendly. They'll just kill you as if you're their daily kill. So you better to stay out of their way. He's going to wait for you at the tower of heaven. He will have everything planned just the way it is and how it should go, so think outside the box; try not to be simple."

It sounds quite confusing for someone to call themselves Dr instead of emperor. I remember the last time I met him was a complete mystery and terror. He had all of his armies around us, with their tongues licking the corners of their lips, hungry for murder and bloodshed."Ok, so why did he call himself a doctor though?" David gave a brief sigh before answering. "Sorry. Can't tell. You'll have to see it for yourself. You'll understand."

Suddenly, I had realized that there was another one of his siblings. He has a sister, a nun that cloaks herself away from the shadows. She seemed so soft but the bloodline she carried overwhelms her bright side. "Wait, where's the other one?"

"Who? Oh, you mean Caren. She's not here, she's somewhere else. And I'm afraid she can't help ya either, other than give you blessings along the way." David said, with a slight sad tone in his voice. I thought they could help me, but it seems impossible. "But couldn't you just fight back?"

"Sorry, we can't. They've done a lot more than Caren and I did. They're far too powerful." He said sadly. I had this urge in my chest to help break their chains, figure out a way to do it. But mostly I want to save my baby. I believe I can do both, but how am I supposed to do it? I'm literally powerless and I had no idea what else they can do.

"And no. I can't give you any weapons."

"What?! But aren't you going to help me?"

"Listen here. If I give you weapons of my design, they'll know it quick and get us both in trouble. Not just us but your daughter too. You don't want to know what will happen if I did so. Don't worry, there'll be weapons hidden around the area." David got up and walked towards the door entrance with a sad smile on his face. A smile that indicates he had no choice to do something that can truly help. "Come with me, It’s time you go out there and save your daughter. I’ll show you the way.”

\-

David instructed me to walk south of the woods and keep walking forward until I met first with a crimson cloaked man. I told him thanks, wishing him good luck, and went off into the woods. As I kept moving forward, I kept repeating myself that I should've been more braver. If I wasn't such a fearing coward, my wife would still be alive, and my baby Bonnie can live a happy life. But what if that didn't matter? What if it still happens no matter what I do?

Suddenly, I was approached by someone covered in a crimson cloak that defies the very nature of life. The only feature hidden was its face, shadowed by the hoodie. It seems the cloaked entity is breathing heavily out of excitement, and I can imagine its mouth clicking with rows of cubic teeth. It didn't speak, it just hissed at me, then pointed to the door before me. It was the same exact door I entered through at the mansion.

I stumbled towards it and grabbed the shining knob with my shaking hand. I glanced over my shoulder to find the cloaked entity vanished from existence. I was left alone with the door to my next destination.

Without hesitation, I opened it and was met with a black and yellow hotel. The lights glow like an old piece of paper, still bright but eerie. The eeriness of the lights gives off a backstory, but was not told in words. The shining obsidian walls and pillars consumes the light before it, belonging to somewhere ancient in an abandoned structure. And the entire hotel is so huge; about as high as the tower of Babel. It would look like it can truly reach heaven. If there really is a heaven up there, what will it look like?

Just as I took my first step through the door, my foot was met with an indescribable feeling. A floor that couldn't be described by the human mind. When I stepped out of the door, there was some sort of force that washes my whole skin. The force or the air is like painting me as if animating me the best they can. There was no giant pen or a mass of ink though.

When I looked at my hands, I saw that my skin color had changed to a paper yellow; an old material used to create cartoon layers. I didn't freak out much, just letting it slide for a bit. It's kinda weird though. I should be freaking out. But I didn't nor had the guts to.

While I walk to the entrance, I studied the area around me to find cardboard bushes designed for background stages, the inked gates could be designed like a popsicle, the far away houses made perfectly of cardboard, and the night sky filled with stars that could lighten the whole place. I admired the sky more than the rest. It was a beautiful sight to behold, but the more I stare into it, I start to wonder what else is up there; in a bone chilling way.

When I touched the glass door entrance, my finger felt a plastic surface instead of glass. I pushed it forward, entering into the lobby. The walls, of course, made of cardboard and decorated with posters of different variety. Posters of propaganda, elections, commercials, and disturbing messages are displayed all over the place like a mess. At the center was a statue of the one and only Mr. Ink, giving a sign that said 'stay in line or you get beaten down by the crooks. "That doesn't sound welcoming. More of a threat."

I walked forward to the service desk, since there aren't anyone around to line up. It seems I'm first to arrive early on schedule, but I didn't sign up for anything, other than getting my baby Bonnie back. On the table was a desk bell, waiting for thousands of years for someone to touch its tiny tip on its head. I looked left and right for any signs of life. Yet there aren't. Of course they aren't here at all, they would probably be asleep in their comfy cartoony beds(Or maybe they aren't on stage yet).

I rang the bell and waited for seconds for anything to happen. I turn around to find the entrance door has disappeared (Or was blocked by another large cardboard box but painted as a bricked wall). Truly, I will never go back again, as David reminded.

I turned back to the service desk to meet 'him'. "Ah! Mr. Donovan, I've been expecting you!" He was still talking when I reached my hands to grip the bastard's neck. But he reacted fast, jumping back from my bare hands. "Woah! Easy there, you don't wanna kill me yet! We're just getting started!" His voice is full of mockery, and it's damn annoying.

I wanted to jump over the table and kill him right there, but I quickly realized that I shouldn't yet. I have no firearms nor anything to protect myself. I stood still, glaring at him with thoughts in my head. Thoughts of killing the bastard before he could ever touch my baby. "Yeah? Then why not?" He let out a mocking laughter and spoke. "Because we're gonna have so much fun together! You and me! The old fashion way!"

When hearing the tone of his killer laughter, the grand pulse of rage just burns much more than I'd ever had in my life. It's true, I hadn't felt such a rage like this. But despite the rage that burns in my soul, I've yet to be able to endure it all. To relent this, I grit my fists and puffed a sigh beneath my breath. I tried my best to keep my voice low and regular. "Alright. How's it start?"

"Simple."- A puddle of ink appeared below, and he fell into it on 2's.-"All you have to do is get to the top. Plain simple." Although he's gone from view, his voice still lingers. It could be that the entire world is his body or just the speakers somewhere around the lobby. It's unclear to me how he does those things. Nevertheless, my exploration in this hell could give me the answers.

I approached the elevator and pressed the button, making a small click along the way. The elevator first ringed, then opened to reveal a room so well built and polished. If money existed in this world, then he must've been very rich to pay such an elevator like this (Or maybe he just made it himself, which sounds much more sense than the first). Why would there even be money in this place anyway?

Once I've went inside and before I went to press the top level of the hotel, I saw it was just a hollow hole, empty and alone; separated from its familiar. Additionally, the other buttons are gone too. Yet there are some which still stays for me to access. I have to find the right button in one of the rooms.

I pressed for the 3rd level. The doors quickly closed shut and the elevator begins to go up. In just a short amount of time, maybe underneath a second or two, it opened. Well, it is a cartoon world so why should I even bother. I'll get back to you all if something else happened, because this is going to take a while.

\-

(UPDATE)

Ok. So I've been going around level 3 for quite a while. Some of the rooms contain a large amounts of black sludge. It burns like hell when I stepped on it, as if I got myself into a room of lava, except it didn't pop nor made a single bubble. I did however find other rooms that doesn't have that lava like sludge. There were drawings, posters, and dead corpses all over. It could be that there was a psychopath who broke in and conduct their signature style (Or this is a torture room for innocent people, who are unlucky to suddenly awake in this world).

I found a key hidden in one of the wardrobes that are covered in dozens of paper, filled of character frames of Mr. Ink. The weirdest thing is that the key was made out of ink, impossibly structured perfectly. I'm beginning to think that the ink might be alive or something. It could be another version of the flesh. Well, why did I ever thought of that idea?

The last room I checked was number 323. Inside has just a dark obsidian closet, with 3 colored locks (Black, Ruby, and bronze) blocking access from whatever it is in there. I can guess that there's a button in there. There is one lock that matches the exact color as the key I found. I unlocked it and removed the lock. Now there are two locks left to break.

\-

I thought level 6 would be just the same. But when the doors opened, I was introduced to a huge room. It would look like it should be at the front of the lobby, but instead it's here. The room would be the size of a stadium, which should've been impossible to be here. It could crush the entire hotel down, but somehow it had the strength to endure such weight; holding a whale or a mountain with one hand. At the center is a large fountain, of course, it was Mr. Ink spitting out ink from his kissing mouth. It only made me cringe when I stared at him. There are statues that circled around it too. Statues of different characters that are a part of his messed up show.

I checked everywhere to find anything. I've found a beer bottle, the shape of a heart with chains wrapped around it. The bottle holds a dark liquor that holds an uncomfortable eerie paranoia. When I looked around, I found the statues around the stadium was staring at me with smiles that creeps make in the dark basement.

The milky shelves holds nothing but the same posters from the lobby, except they looked more distorted than the first.

As I scavenge for a key or a button, I looked at the statues every minute to see if they'd move their foot on the ground to chase me. They just stare at me, with carved eyes of pearl that could crush my head.

I still found nothing in the shelves, boxes, and the paper bushes. The statues are the worst part. They were watching me as I scavenge them. It was worth nothing of my time finding nothing and that I have to deal with their glares.

I checked everywhere but I felt it's still somewhere. I begin to check around the fountain, to find a button sticking beneath the seat. I sighed, releasing a puff of breath, relieved I hadn't missed anything important. I should take note to check beneath for anything.

When I popped my head up, the statues appeared near a feet away from me, reaching their killer hands to kill me. They were alive, their movements rigid, as if it's being animated on two's. I immediately sprung up and ran to the elevator. Attempting to look back might call for death, slowing me down. So I kept looking forward, carefully not to trip while running. I felt like the elevator is stretching far away from me, playing with me until I drop to my death.

Unfortunately, 2 titanic statues are blocking my way to the elevator. I don't know what to do at this point whilst still running. They're chasing me across, with every step it created a loud haunting stomp. Once they've reached my range, I immediately ducked and slid through the opening they made with their legs spread apart. They nearly caught my head for godsake. I quickly stood back up and dashed into the elevator. I didn't waste time to press level 9 as one of the statues nearly caught my collar shirt. Before they could, the doors sliced off its arm, executing its life in a death sentence. Before me, the arm lay limply on the floor. It did twitch a bit, but it died off later on.

My legs were shaking and so is my hand. I raised my hand up to find the button and key in my grasp. Its smooth surface was similar to a lightbulb made from the moon. I insert the button above 3. It accepted it with a sound of a click that soothes my mind. Before me, the door opened to reveal yet another supernatural display. I was met by a dark hallway full of the same sludge. If there's really something I needed to get, then there's something I need to get first that can remove all of that sludge off.

I find that the buttons I've went to are already been explored, except level 4.

I arrived at level 4 and went on scavenging as usual. The whole area looked to be where the mafia would be staying. The tables holds plenty of beers, a table cloth, a bundle of cards, gambling coins, and a piece of note. I held the note up beneath the light. Strangely enough, the note was written in english with a colored pencil.

I'll be finding more buttons and keys, while looking for more notes along the way. They just might have the answers we're looking for, but I fear the answers will be morbid, or something much MUCH worse. I'll be back with you when something unexpected happens or if I've found notes that peak interest. I just hope this is done fast.

*Note 1*

*I don't know how I got here. I was just sleeping and then when I wake up I was here. I don't know how to explain this. Everything is just wrong! Am I in a dream? The whole world looked cartoon. Somehow I still got the blue colored pencil in my pocket. When I touched it, that's when I realized that this is real. Is it really real?!*

*I'm going to go around for a while. If you've found this note, please help me! I don't want to stay here for long! I just want to go home.*

(Update)

After I've read the final sentence, I looked around to see if anyone is there. There wasn't, yet I still had the sense that someone was here before. I wonder if the person who wrote this is still alive. If so, I think I could help that person escape. If not, I wished to tell the person's family that he's resting in peace. I wished that person is in peace.

While scavenging, I found a ruby gem key at the office. It glimmers light when I raised it in front of me.  I also found another level that sends me straight to level 11. Right when I turned around, I was met with a gang of cartoony characters, holding a baseball bat and a boxing gloves. One said to give it back, I denied. 

The first to strike was their leader(The one with a scar on its left eye and a cigar sucked into his lips). He slammed me down on the desk and started banging my head repeatedly. The other gang members started to circle around me, preventing my escape. I grabbed a nearby beer cup and slammed it on the leader's head. 3 kindle birds circle around his head and his eyes went spiral. I got up and went for the door. But a gang member pulled me back by the back collar of my shirt, then wack the back of my head with his baseball bat. All of the gang members started beating me down by kicking and slamming their weapons on my huddled back. Just as I thought I was going to black out, one of the gang members accidentally hit the other's head. "Ow! What in the bloody hell was that for you ol bugger!" 

"Your head was in the way you bigot!" They began beating each other up. Instead of the cartoon way of a big beat up; a big cloud with random stuff flailing around, it was graphic. Their dark blood flying out of their sockets with each swing of their fists and bats. There are noises of cracks, brutal slices, a crush of flesh, and screams of disastrous pain. I began crawling away at a slow pace towards the door. Once I got to the door, I was already standing up and began running to the elevator. 

"Hey! He's running away!! Get him!!" While I was escaping to the elevator, I look back to see they're on to me. They flail their weapons around like maniacs, demanding that I come back and accept their cruel torture methods. Once I got into the elevator, I didn't waste time pressing the close button. They were throwing chairs and tables around, wreaking havoc for no reason as they beat each other, spreading their blood, flesh, and bone everywhere without a care. I thought I knew what they were after, but now I just don't know. They were chasing after me weren't they? Then why are they starting to kill each other? My torso was shaking as I sat down to take a break. In the palm of my hand was the ruby gem key, glaring its menacing features into my eyes. 

*Note 2*

*Its been days. I tried the food and it was awful. There's not even water either. There was a bar place though. I wondered around to find drinks. I had no choice because I'm thirsty as hell here. So I had to drink it. It tasted so good that I can't even describe the taste of it! But after for a while, I'm starting to get sick. I think it's the beer. Who am I kidding, of course it is!*

*Sometimes I look around to find nothing in sight. There was no one, but I couldn't shake the feeling that someone is watching me. I wish I could just wake up to find myself at home again, like none of this is real. Also, if you've found this, please help me and don't drink the beer. It tastes amazing but it'll do something to you.* 

I found this note while exploring level 11. I did, however, unlock the ruby lock at the closet first before I go even further. It's just that I didn't want to lose this key along the way. If I had lost it, I'm unable to know what's in the closet. 

The whole place is a bar area with tables that doesn't fit right with the picture. The note was found in one of the cabinets. The cabinets looked moisture with oil or something. The surface of it nearly made me puke, but I held it. 

The whole place didn't have anyone else. Nevertheless, the whole bar place seems to be abandoned. Glass beer cups lay empty on the table, waiting to be filled. The floor holds no light, it consumes it. The ceiling seems to be made out of wood, which caught me by surprise. Its brown surface shielding the light from the floor's consuming hunger. 

When I opened one of the doors, I was met again with the sludge. This time, however, I saw an entity levitating above it. Its legs merged together to form a slithering form, as if it was being sucked into an empty space. Its ribcage shaped by ink like being designed with the spider's web. Its head had stuck a curved shard, with small picks of steel that would have been its teeth to bite a cow. When It turned around, I saw that it had no face. Instead of a face, it was a bright oval, lighting the darkness like a lighthouse. 

I immediately shut the door and took a step back. My legs shaking as I tried to move. Yet my legs were exhausted due to the bats and kicks from level 4. There was banging on the door, loud enough to indicate that it's going to break through. Trust me, you don't want to know what kind of monsters they are. David's voice haunts me whilst I run to the elevator. I immediately pressed the close button repeatedly before the thing broke through the door in front of my view. By the time the doors closed, the watcher created a loud blood curdling scream that I shut my ears with my palms, desperate to block off the sound. It was much more than murderous intent. It was one of those screams that drugs the mind to fear without reason. 

Suddenly, I felt the whole world began to shift as the elevator started to move sideways instead of upwards or downwards. I stood there with my hands on my ears. The lights in the elevator started to blink; shutting it off and on hauntingly. The entire elevator began to shake that I have to hold on to myself to balance. If this is what the watchers can do, what else can they do more? As David had said, I shouldn't look deeper into it. 

Finally, the elevator stopped shaking and the lights returned to normal, at least. I felt an unwavering sense that it might still be there. I fear it might just be standing right in front of the door, waiting for me. My whole body is shaking; freezing from the haunting experience of the watcher. I looked at my reflection on the wall to see nothing but a shadow. I touched my cheek to feel a harsh chilling touch. My body temperature is warm enough, but why is it cold when I touch my skin? 

I was then shook awake when the door opens. I looked away from my reflection and started exploring the area I'm now in. I'm somehow at level R, which isn't on the list of the hotel levels. Wherever the watchers took me to or it's just Mr. Ink playing with me, I'll find my way back if possible. This is going to be a long journey, because I'm literally at a hall, leading to something alien. The walls could be the height of an obelisk and its surface seemed to be made out of a dark crystal. The walls reached up to the night sky, desperate to touch the stars. 

There is a sudden jolt of some alien feeling in my flesh. I don't know how to describe it or say. It felt like something or someone is waiting for me. My stomach churns, mixing both confusion and understanding. It's as if these 2 definitions are alive and fusing into an evolved meaning. This sounds like what an insane person would write. 

With just a blink of an eye, I wasn't in the elevator anymore. I'm outside. I turned around frantically as my mind races with thoughts I couldn't imagine. There are pictures in my head that tells me of an ancient tale, entities, and god knows what. It's all hard to explain as I look around for an escape, only to find myself that I have to go forward. 

I don't know how long I've been walking in these halls. It felt like hours, days, weeks, seconds? It's making my brain spin in different kinds of reality at the same time. Looking up into the sky, I saw the stars gleaming over the world. Their bright shining lanterns wondering amongst space itself. I wanted to show my baby Bonnie how beautiful the stars are. Maybe even sketch it with my wife, if only she was still alive. 

Every step I made felt like I'm moving backwards and forwards at the same time. My flesh doesn't seem to shift or be affected. The walls became much Much more gloomy as I continued my unanswered journey. 

Until suddenly, I felt an immense and terrible fear. The fear felt both painful and insane. The beat of my heart started to grow rapidly fast, making my vision sick. There's so many flashing imaginations that spirals in my head: Monsters, beast, worlds, gods, angels, demons, salvation, doom, revelations, kingdoms, chaos, wars, darkness, forgetfulness, the 2nd death. I'm seeing so many things simultaneously. I can't hear my voice, my scream, my heart beat. I can't hear anything but the spiraling visions in my head. The pain of fear wraps around me like a parasite digging into my flesh. It hurts and I couldn't help myself but drop to the ground. 

So many voices. SO MANY VOICES!! 

Until, I thought about them. I can't just die here. I want to save my daughter. I want to give her the life she needed. I want her to have a happy life. Without realizing that all of that fear and pain fell away, I continued on, but this time I ran. I will not be stopped, I'm going to break through, even if it costs my life to save her. Whatever demon, monster, or fucked up maniacs, I'm going to break every last one of them if they get in my way!

As I ran, I heard a voice behind me, screaming out to me. ***YOU WILL WITNESS THE REVELATIONS! SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES UPON A NEW WORLD! WHERE SAMUEL SHALL BE ONCE AGAIN THE ONE AND ONLY GOD!!***

And then, everything before my eyes was showered by a bright white flash. And that flash of light, I felt something burn away in my flesh. It was relieving. There's another voice, but it was the opposite. This time, it was a voice I don't recognize, but innocent and holy. *Find Seth.*
