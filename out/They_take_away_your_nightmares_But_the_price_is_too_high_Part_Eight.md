**** 

The oil was thick and sludgy, and Mrs. Graves had the idea of siphoning any old gas in the car out and mixing a little bit in with every balloon.  That worked well enough—we’d found a manual oil extractor, so we could add a bit of air and gas before squirting in a thick glob of oil on top and tying it off.  It was smelly, sweaty, tiring work, and the whole time I was terrified that the mob outside would suddenly remember their job and tear the garage down around us, but it never happened.  Graves was sitting against the front of the car with her feet propped against one of the big tires we’d wedged into the front door’s gap, and even though she looked like a light wind would blow her over, I could see she was vigilant for any sign our situation had changed, either outside or in.

I’d been thinking about what she’d mouthed to me as we’d gone back to get the oil drum a few minutes earlier.  *We’re losing him.*  She meant Holliman, of course, and losing him to the madness of this place seemed the logical assumption.  

I didn’t think she was wrong.  He had quieted down since we’d started working on the balloons, but his behavior had been out-of-character earlier, and there was a tension to his movements that made me think of a man who was fighting hard against a violent outburst.  Or maybe just a bellow of laughter.

“Mr. Holliman, can I ask you a question?”

He froze halfway through squirting a column of oil into his latest balloon.  “Can’t it wait, Clint?  I’m not as nimble as I used to be.  My fingers are stiff and slippery.  I need to focus.”

I paused for a moment and then decided to press on.  “Sure…yeah, it sucks.  Just real quick.  When we were in the gym and that kid attacked us.  You…well, you sure got your gun out fast.”

Holliman stopped again, a small chuckle escaping as he rolled his eyes up to mine.  “Well, you’re welcome.”

I nodded, holding his gaze.  “Yeah…I mean, yeah, I’m glad you did.  But I’ve just been thinking about that.  You were facing us.  Like, before he attacked, you were facing us.  And like you just said, you’re not as spry as you used to be.”

“I said nimble.”

“Uh, okay.  Nimble as you used to be.  But you still got that gun out really fast.”

Looking back down at the balloon, he finished injecting the oil and tied it off before gently adding it to the pile on the floor.  “And your point is…?”

I shrugged.  “I don’t know.  Maybe no point at all.  I just…if you were facing us and saw him coming soon enough to pull your gun and shoot that fast, why didn’t you call out when he was coming at us?  It was dark in there, but not that dark, and you should have been able to see him coming a few seconds before…”

“I was tired and not paying attention, okay?”  He snapped, his harsh tone cutting through even just barely above a whisper.  “That’s all it was.”  Holliman glanced back up to me.  “Or do you think it was something else?”

I lowered my gaze to the next balloon as I took the oil extractor from him.  “No, I just wondered.  I know it all happened fast.”

He giggled softly before clearing his throat and grabbing a new balloon.  “Yes, everything’s moving so quickly.”  Glancing at the pile of balloons we’d already prepared, he tossed the last one down.  “That’s fifteen already.  Should be enough, I’d think.”

Standing up stiffly, I finished tying off the last balloon.  Just gasoline and air in that one, but it might come in handy.  Turning away, I stuffed it into my jacket pocket before looking up at the open skylight.

I’d worried that would be the hardest part of our whole plan, but it actually wasn’t even latched or locked, and standing on top of the car I could reach the lip of the roof well enough to pull myself up.  Knowing neither of them were going to be able to make it up top, I asked Holliman to tie off his jacket to make a sling I could carry the balloons in when I went.  Meanwhile, Graves had found a pack of toilet paper and a lighter, suggesting I throw the burning rolls down onto the crowd once they were good and wet.

Going back to get the items from her, she met my eyes with a questioning look.  Not wanting to risk saying anything, I just gave her a slight shake of the head as I tried to send her my conflicting thoughts.  Holliman was definitely off, and I still wondered if he didn’t just stay quiet when he saw the boy coming at me in the gym.  Why he’d do that, I wasn’t sure, but he suddenly got moving when he saw Graves was the one getting attacked.  Still, what if it *was* just stress and fatigue?  Not just for him, but for all of us?  I wasn’t in a laughing mood, but by that point I’d gone through so many cycles of fear and adrenaline that my brain felt fried.  The only benefit of my stupor was it made it easier to set all my guilt aside about what I was about to try to do.  This wasn’t murder, it was self-defense.  This wasn’t slaughter, it was survival.  If, of course, it even worked at all.

**** 

I thought the smell of the people burning would be the worst part.  It *was* terrible—a mix of the sweet, smoky smell of cooking flesh with the thick stink of burning oil cooking its way through the crowd below—but it was far enough away that I only got a strong whiff when the wind turned in my direction from time to time.  And I had tried to mentally prepare myself as I climbed up onto the roof.  I needed to be clear and calm.  Not hesitate or panic.  Get it all done right and before they had time to figure out what was going on.  Not let the stench or sight of them burning overwhelm me before the job was finished.  

But in the end, it had all been very easy.  They were all still clustered together, a few of them milling back and forth, but largely still and silent aside from the occasional chuckle or titter.  A bunch of discarded toys that some awful thing had forgotten about until they were needed again.  Or maybe it was still trying to use them, and its signal was just being jammed from whatever it was that was supposedly protecting us.

I thought about Holliman again.  Why wasn’t he as protected?  If it was that easy to be infected by this laughter, this joy plague, why wasn’t it affecting me or Mrs. Graves?  What was different about him?

Reaching back down through the skylight, I grabbed the sling Holliman had made from his jacket and lifted it up.  Stepping back to the roof’s edge, I crouched down, fearful that the crowd would see me and attack again if I wasn’t quick or stealthy enough.  Mouth dry, I took out the first balloon.  It was heavy and uneven in my hand, sloshing this way and that as though something inside was alive.  But that was just a trick wasn’t it?  The only things in there were fire and death.  Pushing the thought aside, I threw the first balloon over the roof’s edge into the crowd below.  I was afraid it would just bounce off and roll harmlessly away, but no.  It burst, flinging gas and oil across five or six people near the point of impact. 

After that I threw the rest down very quickly.  Only two actually did bounce.  The rest all soaked the crowd, who for their part barely seemed to notice other than laughing a bit as they looked down at their wet and soiled clothes.  I had a couple of times where people looked up in my direction, but just for a moment, and when I peeked out again, they’d already lost interest or forgotten what had happened.  Even when I started throwing burning rolls of toilet paper into their midst, there were murmurs of surprise, but at first there was little else as people began to burn. 

It wasn’t until the entire mob was ablaze that I started to hear it.  Above the roar of the flames and the sizzling pop of people’s bodies cooking, I could hear this strange harmony that I first took for music, though it was harsh and penetrating, like a jagged shard of glass being shoved into my brain.  But the more I stared down at the crowd, some of them already collapsing as their muscles and tendons gave way, the more I realized that everyone I could see was looking up at me now.  Looking up and not singing, but laughing—and not from a hundred voices, but all one voice steaming up from a hundred mouths.  

It was the voice of the thing that lived here.  Laughing this terrible laugh that was heavy with pain and sadness and fear, but also a kind of jolly madness.  I couldn’t hear any words from it, but that didn’t stop my mind from forming a sentence, a sentiment, or maybe a challenge out of the clawing sound that was slowly dying down as the last of the people began to collapse or burn past moving or sounds or life.  It may have been my imagination, but the words in my mind were still crystal clear.

*All right, then, motherfucker.  Come and get me.*

Shuddering, I made a circuit around the roof to make sure I hadn’t left off any stragglers.  But no, they’d all been together at the end, at least the ones near the gas station.  Hands slick and numb, I eased myself back down to the garage and told Holliman and Graves that, at least for the moment, we had a means of escaping.

Holliman raised an eyebrow.  “Escape…true escape…is still blocked, I’m afraid.  But how do you feel?  Do you think we eliminated enough people to find this entity and kill it?”

I frowned at him.  “How the fuck would I know?  You’re supposed to…”

“Clint.”  I stopped and looked over at Mrs. Graves questioningly as she continued.  “I know it sounds strange, but what Gordon is trying to ask is how do you *feel*?  Do you feel like it’s time?”

I wanted to say no.  That the thing I’d heard laughing through all those poor people as they’d burned was the Devil, and you don’t go looking for the Devil, especially when you’re in Hell.  But…That’s not what my gut was telling me.  Instead, I felt like I was in the orbit of some dark, unseen planet, the gravity of it pulling at the core of me, whispering that yes, now was the time to strike, while this *other* was weak and afraid.  Yes, afraid.  Of me and what came with me.

I flinched and blinked at the flood of thoughts flowing through me.  What the fuck was…I heard myself speaking before I’d even fully thought the words.  “Yes.  It’s time.  It’s time for us to go to the mine and expel it.”

**** 

We headed west to the “Historic Old Mine” marked on Holliman’s “Braxton Sights” map.  On the drawing there was a small mining car filled with children zooming toward the black mouth of the mine, and I think they were meant to look like they were laughing.  But looking at their wide eyes and gaping, frantic mouths, I couldn’t help but think they were screaming.  Or that maybe laughing is just screaming that we choose to ignore.

It took over an hour walking there in the dark, and I was worried the entire way that we would get ambushed by another mob any minute.  That fear was also why we decided against going back for the car.  On foot we could keep to the shadows and possibly avoid trouble before it saw us, where in a car we’d draw more attention.  

In the end, it didn’t matter.  We didn’t see many more people, and the few we did were all still twitchily dreaming.  The road to the mine was loose, rough gravel, making each step a bit treacherous in the meager light from the moon and our phones when we dared to use them.  Maybe our focus on not falling is why the man was able to get so close to us before we realized he was there.

“Evenin’ folks.”  I jumped and spun toward him while Mrs. Graves stumbled back and Mr. Holliman uttered a short, startled cry.  The man’s features were obscured in shadow, but his body wasn’t—even in the pale monochrome of the available light I could make out the uniform and the name tag on one side of his chest that said “Marcus”.  On the other side was a silver star, engraved with scrollwork around another single word.

Sheriff.

“Seems awful late for ya’ll to be out and about in our fair little town.”  The man let out a hoarse giggle.  “Thinking about a trip to the mine, I’d wager.”

Graves found her voice first.  “Please let us pass.  We’re trying to help this town.”

Sheriff Marcus threw back his head with a deep, bellowing laugh that ended abruptly into a rattling cough.  “Hell, lady.  We’re way past saving.  And I know what you’ve been up to in town.  Your kind of saving ain’t much saving at all.”

Holliman stepped up in front of Graves, his hand shaking as it gripped his gun.  “You get back.  You won’t stop us, and I think you know what we do to those that get in our way.”

Marcus looked at Holliman for a moment, his nose wrinkling as though he smelled something bad.  Seeing his face, I had the thought that it had probably once been friendly, even handsome.  Now it looked haggard and worn, a hard-baked mask cooked in the heat of this place’s madness.  And when he turned dismissively from Holliman to me, I could still feel that heat from his eyes even though they were lost again in shadow.

“No need for hostilities.  He knows when he’s whipped.  Sent me to come fetch you.”  He turned and raked his eyes across my two employers.  “Not you two.  Only him.”

Graves was already shaking her head.  “No, absolutely…”

The sheriff cut her off with a snicker.  “There are still over fifteen hundred souls in this place.  I can feel better than three hundred within a mile of here.”  He shot a mocking look at Holliman.  “Did you bring that many bullets with you from Kerioth?”  The man turned back to Graves.  “Or do you mean to fight them all before bleeding away the last of your life?”

Stomach clenching, I walked toward him.  “No.  I’ll go.”  I looked back at Graves.  “Just me.  It’ll be okay.  Give me the Elixir.”

Graves seemed about to argue further, but finally she shook her head and pulled out the satchel.  Handing it to me, she held on for a second, meeting my eyes.  “Please be careful, Clint.”

I nodded, giving a laugh I didn’t feel.  “I will.  I mean, I’ll try.”  It was strange.  I was afraid then, and even more afraid when we went into the mine, but looking back now, I can see how small and remote that fear was in the face of the overwhelming sense that I was doing exactly what I was supposed to be doing.  That somehow, as insane as it seemed, I was meant to follow this madman down into the dark of the mine.

“Okay, Sheriff.  Lead on.”

The man in front of me had been staring dully as he waited, but now he sprang to life, doing a small, shuffling jig in the gravel before turning and heading off toward the entrance to the mine.  He didn’t look back, as though he was as sure as I was that there was nowhere else I intended to go.  I expected the entrance to just be a black hole in the earth, but to my surprise, there was a string of lights running from the mouth all the way down the throat so far as I could see.  I followed him silently into the first shaft for what felt like better than a mile through several turns and intersections, and then down a second shaft before we got to an ancient elevator that looked over a century old.  As though reading my mind, Sheriff Marcus chuckled as he pulled back the safety chain and beckoned me inside.

“It’s not as old as it looks.  Went in around ’53 I think.  This place has had several lives and deaths before this last one.  I guess he was just sleeping down there through all of it, waiting for us to get deep enough to reach him.”  He chortled.  “For him to reach us.”

I didn’t ask who or what he meant.  I already knew, or at least in that moment I felt like I knew enough.  I wasn’t sure what was going to happen when I met this creature, or how I was going to stop it, but every step I took felt like the right one, and in that moment, that was all I needed.

The elevator ride down was surprisingly smooth, though it was noisy enough I had the thought that we weren’t dropping through a void at all, but crushing the ground beneath us as we went like a neverending jackhammer or miner’s pick.  Then the ride was over, and these lower tunnels weren’t lit like the higher ones had been.

The sheriff pulled out a flashlight.  “We were restringing all this as we could.  Hard to stay focused, you know, what with all the other activities we’ve been up to.  But we were making headway until…well, until we fell asleep.  But never you mind.  Old Harry will lead you true.”  

Pushing out the light in front of him, he headed off again, and I followed him through a number of other tunnels and chambers before we finally came to a stop.  The man glanced back at me.  “He’s up here, around the corner.  He will be polite, I think, so you do the same.  Listen pert, you understand.”

My heart was hammering so loud I could barely hear him, but I nodded anyway.  Walking forward and around the corner, I gasped as the air suddenly changed, thickening and cooling as though I’d stepped further into a large chamber lit not by electric lights, but torches lining both walls.  Even at a distance, I could see bones sticking out of those torches, both holding the flame and feeding it as the color lazily danced between red and blue and green.  It was beautiful in a way, and cast a shifting palette of darkness and light across the thing that lay in the center of the room.

It was enormous—probably twenty feet tall if it was standing, and over twice that in length.  Even its head, broad and blunt and spiky with tufts of fur, was gigantic as it raised up to look at me with yellow eyes before giving a long yawn.  Opened wide, its mouth was terrifying—filled with twin rows of thick, jagged teeth on either side of a long tongue of speckled pink and black.  When it closed its mouth, it regarded me calmly enough, those eyes dancing with equal parts intelligence and madness.  Behind its head, I saw a ridge of fur raise and give a rustling shake, like the warning of a snake before the bite.  But this was no serpent.  

It was a hyena.  

Something in my mind caught and corrected itself.

No.  It was *The* Hyena.

The thing’s black lips curled back suddenly as a terrible bubbling noise came from its throat and filled the space around us.  It wasn’t the same as what I’d expected—it was a hundred times wilder and more varied—but it did remind me of hyena noises I had heard before.  And whatever those noises might have meant to the animals, I knew what it meant to this thing.

[It was laughing.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)
