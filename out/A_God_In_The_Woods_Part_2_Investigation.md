Josh is a fucking nutjob.

He actually thinks he found a supreme being. He claims it spoke to him through his thoughts, “beaming” pictures into his head. Apparently showing him in vivid detail how to make his parents give him a new dog.

So many of the things he said only came back to memory after he said it. His ramblings had me remembering things committed to oblivion long ago. Stuff like how he started to draw pictures of crying faces in his notebook, wrote I miss you fluffy letters to the “farm up state” and telling me all about how hard it was not being able to have a friend he trusted at home anymore.

According to Josh, the almighty thing in the woods told him to do these things. That if he could make his parents think that fluffy kept him from self-harming. And he stuck to it’s plan; it promised they would gift him another dog.

 

I mean coercing a child to manipulate and deceive their parents just doesn’t sound godly to me. It sounds like the ramblings of a very ill person with no regard for others, destined to grow up and become a serial killer.

And I do not remember sweet little Josh that way at all. And how the hell was a seven-year-old this cunning. Don’t get me wrong Josh isn’t dumb, but he sure as hell wasn’t that smart either.

The way he said it. He really believes this happened. The man has evidently lost his marbles! And as too whom he told. Apparently according to him “everyone”, so that’s no help.

 

I felt tricked. I should have seen the warning signs, even back then. How did I ever consider him a friend? He was psychopathic obviously, manipulating his parents for selfish gain. No wonder he would like the thought of having coerced other kids to go out and get lost in the woods.

Sure am glad that friendship didn’t last!

But if he was smart enough back then to manipulate his parents like that, why did he now as an adult try to sell that clearly bogus story to me? He made it sound like he actually believed it. It’s not like I gave a lick of ambiguity as to if I thought it was real. I made it very clear that I was mainly interested in too whom he told. And even if he thought he could convince me, it’s a prank of his from literal decades ago. Lay it to rest Josh.

Beyond that, if he did tell everyone. And he did convince others that he had a wish fulfilled.

Well, this conviction of his might be what made the story stick around all these years. The story of the kid that got a dog. I think I got my answer to my detective riddle.

One crazy kid’s devoted schizophrenic episode, and a story became a tall tale for an entire playground community.

 

But I was now, way more concerned about something else. **Me***.* Specifically my judgment of character. So, I asked a friend from that mutual friend group whom I’m still friends with, his name is Eric, if he remembers anything weird about Josh. Mostly because I refuse to be the only one that missed it.

And, if he tricked others, maybe even made Eric believe in that story. Well then, I wouldn’t need to be so hard on myself.

 

Eric did remember the change after Josh’s dog died. But he tells me that he remembers Josh suddenly changing a little over a week later. It wasn’t right after fluffy died, and he is sure of it. He specifically recalls having a playdate with josh where he asked if they should walk the dog, and being told by Josh there was no dog to walk. Josh apparently wasn’t all that broken up about it then, but that, Eric said, changed abruptly.

 

That I missed one of our friends being utterly psychotic, kind of turned my interest around for a bit. I ended up talking mostly about if Eric had noticed anyone else in my life being crazy without me noticing, and he jokingly said he did warn me about my ex. The conversation derailed somewhat after that. I guess a combination of nervousness and relief.

Relief that Eric always had been an amazing friend to me, living proof that I didn’t have all piss poor judgment of character.

But an uncomfortable nervousness simultaneously grew within me. Nervousness that I couldn’t bring myself to reveal that I had started obsessing about this childhood spoke story. Why did I hide this obsession from Eric?

In the end I told myself to drop playing detective, no need to dig any further. I was happy here looking at both of our kids playing together in the other room. Happy with how well mine and Erics small families got along.

But I could tell Eric felt my nervousness. And that only strengthened the feeling's hold over me. While trying to let go of the story, that nervousness spilled over, and brought back so many nervous impulses in me. Sitting there, listning to my son's laughter, looking into the eyes of a trusted friend. I felt vournable, and of cause Eric could tell I was on shacky ground.

"What's wrong?"

I couldn't let Eric know I at some level ended up believiving Josh's deranged story. And in that moment I chose to take care of Eric's question, my privacy and one of my nervous fears with the same answer.

"I want you to reassure me that if anything happens to me. You and Elise will...."

I don’t think I completed the answer, just slowly looked into the other room. That my son had no other adult caretaker, had sown a fear in me. And having a chance to quench that fear for good, I took it.

Eric waited for me to turn my head back to him. His face had relaxed and his look turned from curiosity to reassurance. Very calmly he told me

"Both of you are already family."

I gave him a hug that was more closely likened a viper strike, and held that embrace until we both understood that our emotions where synchronised. For the rest of that day, home didn't feel like a place.

But I still suspect that Eric noticed I was holding something from him. After all he had always been good at picking up on those kinds of signals.

 

I know it will take some time for my mind to truly lay this story to rest, but in time I will come to accept that it was Josh’s outspoken believe in the voices within his head that made the rumor so persistent. After all he did manage to get a new dog, and that must have been good proof for seven-year-olds.

 

Update:

 

So laying the story to rest didn’t last long. The other kid that went looking in the woods got back to me this evening.
