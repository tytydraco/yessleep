I think I killed my boss with a voodoo doll. No. I know I killed my boss with a voodoo doll. My ex-boss. And I got the recipe, the formula? online. At Esty of all places. Who knew you could buy a spell, an actual killing spell, one that works, on Etsy?

  
So here’s the story. Since, let’s say, Day Two, I haven’t gotten along with my boss. She wasn’t the boss I started with. No. That manager decided she had too many direct reports, so she hired someone to take over part of her team. And I was one of the (un)lucky ones to move under this new manager. 

  
At first, I was kind of stoked. I’m a contractor and have been for years, so I'm used to not feeling like part of the team, no matter where I go. But when I LinkedIn stalked our new manager, I noticed she used to be a contractor, too, so I was like, ‘Ah, she gets it! She’ll understand and make me feel at home.’

  
I even said as much to her in our initial meet and greet.

  
How wrong I was. 

  
Apparently, she wanted to leave her contracting roots behind her. Instead, welcoming the corporate mentality that says contractors are disposable. Here today, gone at the end of their contract.   
And I get it. We don’t get benefits, no paid holidays or vacations, no insurance. I signed up for that, so all of it is fine…it’s just the work culture that pisses me off. At this company, we weren’t invited to meetings that didn’t directly affect us (identified by the company as wider org meetings, full company meetings, any fun meetings like holiday parties –even though the entire company was remote and the meetings were over Google Hangouts, onsite meetings, etc.) You get the picture. And honestly, I was fine with all that. Who wants to travel? Who wants to sit around on a holiday video call? Not me. But it was the other stuff, like no weekly one one-on-ones to check-in that really made me feel ‘other’. 

Everyone else had their little inside jokes with her, and me? She didn’t even know me. Over a year and a half together, and she probably couldn’t name one little factoid about me outside of what I did at work…and I’m not sure she even knew what I did. I was constantly getting accolades and praise from other team members for important work I was doing…but never one shoutout from my manager.

  
And then came layoffs. She didn’t even have the grace to tell me it was coming, just seven weeks before my official contract ended, and less than a month before Christmas, I got an email to my personal account, at the end of the day—after the workday was over, saying my contract had ended. The day had been my last.

  
No notice. No email or Slack message at work. In fact, that morning we’d had our team meeting, and not a word, not a hint. 

  
The previous week, at home, a pipe had burst in our bathroom, and we were in the midst of a very expensive fix. We’d put down 10 grand which was only half of it, and there was no way to get the money back.

  
We’d planned a vacation for the end of my contract, which everyone at work knew about, because I’d mentioned it in a weekly meeting months before…and now, we’d have to cancel. 

  
And who is hiring at the holidays? With everyone laid off everywhere, there is fierce competition.  
So, I stewed. I ranted and I raved…and then I thought, just as a joke, whatever happened to voodoo dolls? I used to see them on Scooby Doo…are they still a thing? Do they work?

  
I googled and found some on Amazon. Obviously, I thought, those don’t work…but then this crazy link appeared in my search. Etsy.

  
You get the doll, you print out a photo of the intended, attach it, and then, well, you recite the spell, stick the pins…voila! Or, should I say, Voodoo!

  
So, you know, having $19.95 to spare (reader, I did not have $19.95 to spare), I gave ol’ Ozymondius my money (not his real name) for his ultimate death spell, and I waited.

  
I didn’t have to wait long. It’s not like he has to ship the thing. It was an instant download. He does ask you to provide a picture if you can, which helps strengthen the spell…so I did. I think he says a spell over the photo or something. Not exactly sure. 

  
It was a joke, really. I mean, who believes this shit? I mean. Okay, when I ordered it, I really wanted to believe. There are, like, 2000 reviews on there! And I was angry. Who does that to another human being? Such bullshit. So, yeah. I wanted to, you know, give her heartburn or something—which is really the most I thought a voodoo doll could do. On The Brady Bunch or whatever, you put in a pin, and Bobby’s arm hurt. You stuck in a pin and Marsha got a stomach cramp. I figured I’d give her a backache, maybe a hemorrhoid. 

  
No, not really. I wanted to believe and I wanted her to hurt. Hopefully, she’d be miserable; as miserable as I was. Maybe, yes, maybe she’d lose her job. Or she’d break a leg. Something.

  
*But she died.* Reader, she *died*.

  
That’s right. I saw it on LinkedIn. No, we are not connected (fuck that noise), but I do still have connections at that place, and a couple of them posted about it. Sad noises, sniffles. (And of course, as corporations do, these were soon followed by a job posting. Filling her role asap.) 

  
So, to back up. I purchased a doll as directed. I pasted her face on, and I recited the incantation. It made me feel instantly better, which I assumed was the point. Figuring that was it, I kind of put the doll away. Tossed it on a chair in the bedroom, actually. Did some deep breathing, meditated on it, felt great. Well, not great. But better. Applied for a couple of new roles. Made cookies.

  
Forgot about the doll.

  
Until later in the evening, when I found a piece of the doll in the dining room. A leg.

  
Then, I found a piece of the doll by the fireplace in the living room. An arm. 

  
And a piece of the doll in the bedroom, at the foot of the bed. The rest? In my dog’s bed. The doll was destroyed, pieces all over the house. My former boss’s smiling face peered up at me from the carpet—her picture peeled from the now faceless doll.

  
I tossed it all in the trash after laughing at my pup. No admonishment, because I couldn’t have cared less. It was junk. Meant for the garbage.

  
But then the LinkedIn post. 

  
She’d been hit by a bus. I googled the story. The bus splattered her everywhere (the article didn’t say as much, but it was implied.)

  
I looked at Rory, my pup. My *greyhound* pup.

  
“We did this,” I said to him. He rolled over and gave me belly.
