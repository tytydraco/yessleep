Day 1

Today I woke up in a great mood. I groggily rolled out of bed, slowly coming to my senses. A quick look at the calendar reminded me that it was Saturday morning. Excellent. This meant that my wife was cooking up some delicious breakfast at that very moment. I quickly got dressed, expecting to be met with the smell of some scrumptious eggs and bacon and the chatter of my two sons as I stepped out of my room. 

Nothing. Just silence.

"Honey? Are you there?" It was eerie in a way. I was confused. Had I checked the calendar wrong? Or perhaps, my family went out for breakfast by themselves, without me? Either way, I was annoyed. I called my wife to confirm my suspicions. No response. Weird. Olivia was usually on top of calls, and always had her ringer on just in case. So I called my older son, Tristan. Again, nothing. Then I called my younger son, Tyler. Nothing. I was beginning to become confused. Where was my family? Were they kidnapped? What the hell happened? 

I quickly ran to the kitchen to whip up some food. I was still confident they were fine, maybe they were just angry at me. I was not the best cook ever, so I decided on a burrito for my meal. As I chowed down on my warm, savory delight, I noticed something was off. I live in a big city, and usually on days like this, there would be a ruckus of noise outside. Cars honking, sirens blaring, birds chirping, it was always awake and ready to go. But today, there was... nothing.

I stepped outside my house for the first time today. The streets were empty. I heard nothing, not  even the barking of a dog. I was starting to feel uneasy.

I walked around the streets a bit more. Absolutely nobody was there. How did this happen? I had so many questions. I hated this. I just wanted to go home. 

I just decided to go home for the day. Maybe this was a bad dream. I'm probably just hallucinating. I'm gonna go back to sleep and see what happens the next day.

Day 2

So. Nothing. Nobody outside. I decided to search the streets of my city. I just wanted to be sure absolutely everybody was gone. Indeed, nobody was there. I saw what seemed to be a wallet in the sewer drain on the side of the road, and I was tempted to reach in and pick it out, but I realized it was pointless, considering money was nearly of no value at this point in time. Blast, I had just gotten that big raise from my boss. Frustrating to say the least. But I spent the rest of the day praying to every deity or spiritual being I could think of, hoping one would be around up there, chilling above the clouds (or below the earth), listening to my puny calls for the end to my torturous being. I have lost all motivation for anything and I am becoming weak.

Day 3

I am beginning to go insane. Earlier today I realized I hadn't eaten for days. I went to the Antonio's pizzeria, thinking that maybe the guy behind the counter would be there, ready to serve me up a delicious slice of pepperoni pizza. But nobody was there. What did I expect. Alas, my dreams of meeting another human were futile, and I was likely doomed to eternity of just walking around, endlessly, absolutely nobody to talk to. I thought about ending it all. Nobody was there to be sad when I was gone, so why not just leave? But I decided to have a little bit of fun first. My first stop was at the playground, where I could resolve all my childish pleasures without the restrictive judgement of society holding me back. Second, I went to the drug store. Again, might sound bad, but I was by myself, nobody was gonna think I was some sort of addict. I discovered things I had never found before. 

Lastly, I decided to go to a sex shop. Not something I am particularly proud of, but it was day 3 and I was getting a bit restless. A man needs his action, and this was the best way I could fulfill my simplistic desires.

Day 5

I slept all day yesterday. I think I'm going through the depression stage now. I can't be bothered anymore. The only reason I haven't ended it all is because of the small, futile chance that my family and friends would be back. Hell, I would be happy if Steve, my boss, would be back, even though I absolutely despise that man. Anyways, I'm going to browse the rest of the city and see what I can do. Maybe I'll break into someone's house and see what exciting trinkets I can find in there.

Day 8

Same old, same old. I found Steve's house this morning. I also found his wife's phone. Apparently there's some dirty texts on there from another man. Ha. I wonder if he knew. I really wish he would come back so I could rub it in. Unfortunately, I don't know if that's happening.

Day 14? 15? 17? No idea anymore

I've lost count of the days. My life is fading away. I'm forgetting basic things about myself. I'm losing track of my schedule. I forgot to brush my teeth yesterday. That is incredible for a guy like me, someone who is incredibly organized and neat most of the time (if I may say so myself.) I am probably going to end myself later. I have no idea anymore.

Day ???

I woke up today in a completely barren room. All there was was a small bed in the corner. I could vaguely see something behind some metal bars. They seemed to be... other people??? 

No.

It couldn't be. 

I must be dreaming. 

I was so happy. It was like my marriage day all over again. 

Before I could get back to my senses enough to talk to the people, a woman in a white suit opened a door using a key. I tried to get out, but she forced me back in. She called someone on a phone- "Patient 78 is awake. I will feed him now." An incredibly succinct but confusing message. What was this patient she spoke of? Was it... Me? Couldn't be. I was perfectly healthy! Sure, I was a bit crazy, but not enough to be institutionalized? Before I could ask a question, she handed me some food- bread and some pea soup. It was not particularly tasty food, but solid nonetheless. I was hungry, and I needed something to eat. 

After a while, I wondered what had happened. Where was the massive city I lived in? Where were the sprawling buildings and gargantuan towers everywhere? What about the endless litter, and pidgeons and sparrows and everything that gave it its identity? I was bamboozled. I was able to catch a glimpse of one of the people in the white suit, and it read, "State Psychiatric Hospital."
