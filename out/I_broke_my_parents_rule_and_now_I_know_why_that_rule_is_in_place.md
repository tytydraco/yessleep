I lived in with my parents since I was born and haven't left. I recently turned 18 and got a full time job. Now that I am an adult I bought a TV for my room. I brought it home after work was over. My parents were home early so I stashed it in our garage closet. I walked in and had small talk with my mom. Ignoring my dad I go to my room where I pretend to sleep. I stayed up that night to go bring my TV in. Since my parents were asleep it wasn't to hard to get to my room. 

I set it up in my room on one of my dressers. I made a second trip to our living room where I got my PS5 to hook it up. As one does I got everything turned on and working. I played in bed with my controller and start playing games. 

As the night continues on I stay up never growing tired. It wasn't til 2:00 am where I grew dreary. I turned off the TV and Playstation and fell asleep. I woke up at 2:15 to notice the TV is static. I saw was a static screen. I go to turn it off and walk back to my bed. I lay in bed as I turn around and see the TV on again. This time it wasn't static. There was a clear picture. It seems to be me. It was someone filming me from the window. I look out it and see nothing. I look back at the screen and I an still there.

I closed the blinds, turned off the TV and I lay in bed. Finally, I drifted off to sleep. I woke up and the time went back to 2:00 am. This time the TV was recording the screen the whole time. So being the curious side of me I watch 15 minutes of whatever it recorded. After each minute that past, nothing happened. Until I got to 10 minutes and 32 seconds where something strange happened. My door opened revealing a large dark figure. It inched closer to my bed before it stopped. It saw the TV, turned around and started walking towards the TV. I saw this thing reach its arm out. The thing went inside the TV. 

I shut off the recording and quickly turned the TV off and layed in bed. I noticed the time was 2:10:25. I stayed  up but under the covers where I could hide. 7 seconds later. The door opened. This ominous sound filled the room. I could hear it's breath and heartbeat. It inches closer reaching it's hand to my legs. It's arm felt like a tentacle. I peeked out and it was gone. However the TV is on. Something was different. There was a figure. I couldctelk out each detail. The face, seems burnt. The arms, bubbly. The heighth, lanky and tall. 

The creature creeps me out. The thing moved as the camera followed. There was a graveside in a graveyard not too far from here. The figure stood above a stone. On the stone, was my name. Again the door bashed open the figure stood there. All of a sudden, the figure ran towards me, held me up, threw me all across the room. My right arm was mangled and dislocated. Me legs, knees bent in the opposite way. My eyes saw the figure more clear than in the TV. It was my Dad. 

He turns into this creature from electrical waves which sends him into this transformation. He could only prevent me from getting hurt by not having a TV in my room. But by this he hurts me for he has no control. My Dad transforms back and went back to his room and sleep. I couldn't make a noise. The only thing that didn't make sense is how did I see the future through it. I closed my eyes and slept.

I woke up. It is 7 o clock. This night was made me think. How am I alive. And why am I no longer in pain. Who is my Dad. Who is he really.
