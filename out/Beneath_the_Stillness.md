I think something’s in the woods near the river.

We were out past the second fork—where the bend curves shallow and there’s that flat rock on the bank. Locals probably know the spot. It’s the one people say Emily used to fish from. You know—the sisters from the coffee shop. The kind ones. Everyone in town talks about them like they’re the only ones who really see what’s going on.

I never used to believe that kind of talk. Just thought they were sweet, quiet girls who ran a good place.

But after what I saw…
I’m starting to wonder if the rumors are true.

We got there just before dawn. Mist was clinging to the surface like it didn’t want to let go. Everything smelled like pine, wet stone, and cold air. It felt real. Steady. Safe.
We joked a bit, talked about nothing. It felt normal.

By 6:15 we had both lines in. No bites. Even the birds were lazy.

And then the wind changed.

Not the weather. Just… the way the air moved. Like it was hiding between the trees instead of moving through them.

I remember thinking: It’s too quiet for wind.
That was the first thing that felt wrong.

The second was the sound. Not loud. Barely there. Like something sighing under the water.

He stood up first. Said he saw something move on the opposite bank.
I told him to sit back down—that it was probably a beaver or a log or something.

But he didn’t sit down.

He stepped forward onto the rock.

And the water moved.

It didn’t splash. It didn’t ripple.
It peeled. Like skin. Like it opened up for something.

There was a shape—long, thin, too pale to be an animal. Too smooth to be a branch.
It wasn’t fast. That’s the part that still messes me up. It didn’t lunge. It just… reached.

I tried to shout, but nothing came out.
And he didn’t get a chance to scream.

It took him.
Pulled him under without a sound. No splash. No bubbles.
Just gone.

I ran. Left the rods. The tackle box. Everything.
Didn’t look back once.

That was yesterday.

This morning, I went back. I don’t even know why. Maybe to prove to myself I wasn’t crazy.

The gear was still there.
The rock was dry.

But there were marks in the dirt. Drag marks. Like something had slid—not walked—from the river into the woods.

I don’t know what I saw.
But I know something’s out there. And I don’t think it’s done.



If this reaches the sisters—Emily, Tiffany—I don’t know if you remember me, but I’ve been to your shop more times than I can count. You probably remember my order more than my face. Doesn’t matter.

People say you notice things others don’t.

I hope to God they’re right.
Because something’s waking up out there.

And I think it already knows our names. I don't know what IT is but I know it sees us. And It knows what we fear.
