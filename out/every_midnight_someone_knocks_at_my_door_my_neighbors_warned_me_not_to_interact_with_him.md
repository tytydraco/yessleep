it started when i moved to a new neighborhood, i was just settling in and meeting my neighbors when a female neighbor named samantha walked up to me and explained "our neighborhood is not normal" and when i told her to explain further my blood ran cold, she told me about the knocks and how i should never even do as much as look or talk to whatever is at the door, when i asked why she just shook her head, i did not understand what was going on in this neighborhood but sure enough at midnight the knocking began.

it started with soft knocks, barely noticeable, if it stayed like that i probably could have slept though but then it got louder, then a voice came through the door "jesse please let me in it's cold" i froze, that voice was my sister that went missing 4 years ago after a bad argument, i didn't respond i knew if what my neighbors said was true something bad would happen but the knocking didn't stop, and neither did her talking, her voice getting angrier the longer i waited, it was 1 am now and i couldn't sleep, not only because of fear but also because the knocking and voices were getting unbearably loud to the point i could hear it from my bedroom, i knew i should not have answered, but my sister was my best friend before she left, i wanted to believe her, to open the door but i trusted my neighbors, i knew i would have to just wait through the night then at 1:33 am it got worse, so much worse.

i was already scared to my core about what was going on but then i heard it, the unmistakable sound of a knock, this time it was coming from my window, i didn't make sense, i thought the knocks were only at the door, but i knew as much as looking out the window would trigger something sinister, then a voice started coming from the window "honey let me in" my mom,

i didn't answer or look, for hours i kept getting more knocks, my back door with my ex's voice, my upstairs window with my current girlfriend's voice, i didn't know how long this was gonna last, at 4:31 am i  heard wood cracking, coming from my front door, when i looked at it the wood looked undamaged, odd but compared to everything else not that weird i survived the night and at 7:00 am everything suddenly stopped, i went on with my life like normal after that using sleeping pills at night, things were going great and i thought everything was ok, i was so wrong, i invited 2 friends to a slumber party james and jordan,

i had been planning on blocking all windows to avoid anyone accidently looking at whatever is knocking but early into the party james started messing with my blockage, i panicked and told hi m about the knocks, james ever the thrill seeker wanted to know what would happen, badly, when the knocks started coming from the window james went towards the window, me and jordan knew something bad was bound to happen so we ran away, in the distance i heard cracking glass, then james screaming and flesh tearing behind me, then i realized jordan was not keeping up with me, he was too slow so as i went into the basement and locked the door i heard jordan screaming too, then the knocking came to the basement door, i rushed down the stairs but even at 7:00 the knocks on the basement door never stopped, every few minutes a terrifying voice says "let me in jesse" it knows my name, it's been 4 days now and the knocking has not stopped, i have tried calling people, neighbors and friends but no one picks on, when i look out my basement window i just see black, i am currently surviving on things in my basement freezer but supplies are low and i am not sure how much longer i can last, all because my friend looked out a window
