I would have done anything to be pretty.

I started plucking and popping as a teenager. Razor burn, the tingle of bleach on my scalp, the sudden uprooting of hair follicles with hot wax; little rituals learned from my mom, who was grief-stricken that I had inherited her looks. Painful, yes, but nothing compared to the constantly gnawing void of my own ugliness. 

A person could go crazy if they look into that void too long. 

I did.

It’d been a few weeks since Megan dumped me. The apartment felt like a funeral home without shitty pop music bouncing off the walls. The breakup was inevitable, honestly – she was painfully out of my league. She was a beautiful go-getter. I was a lumpy sack of depressed shit.

I missed her more than anything. Her thousand-watt smile, her boldness, the way her button nose would crinkle when she laughed and how she would snort if I made her crack up hard enough.

Scrolling on the apps was the only activity mind-numbing enough to distract me. The only way I found that could fill the silence that she left behind.

It was on one of those masochistic TikTok doomscrolls that I saw the ad that almost killed me.

It was for a face mask. A gorgeous woman with glossy blonde hair and sparkling eyes addressed the camera with a chirpy, aggressive friendliness.

“When I say I saw differences after just one use I *mean it,* girl.” She cooed, cutting from footage of her applying the minty-green paste to her standing proud with fresh-washed skin. She was flawless. “My pores haven’t been the same since.”

I wasn’t naive. Everyone uses filters. That’s not even getting into strategic lighting, perfectly placed contour, the million other tricks seasoned beauty influencers have. 

This wasn’t like that. She wasn’t hiding behind filters or good lighting. Frankly, she looked like she was in a warehouse with harsh overhead fluorescents laying her bare. Yet her skin was smooth as glass. When she zoomed in to pan over her cheek and the bridge of her nose I couldn’t see a single pore.

I looked from my phone to that old disappointment in my mirror. My eyes were drab and lifeless, my nose with its wide flaring nostrils like a squashed fruit on the center of my greasy face, my thin lips chapped and clotted. 

I ran my finger along the same route she took. I felt the awful topography of acne scars, the roughshod terrain of my oil-clogged pores, the swath of blackheads that covered my huge nose and puffy cheeks. 

The years of bullying. The loneliness. The shame.

“I know you feel insecure. I do too.” Her smile turned gentle, blue eyes brimming with the kind of compassion usually seen in sainthood. “Don’t you deserve a change? Don’t you want to feel beautiful? Let me give you that. Quick – go to my TikTok shop link and enjoy 75% off the best self care secret you’ll ever get. Get an extra 20% off if you order in the next half hour!”

I ordered a bottle immediately.

Even at the time I knew it was a stupid idea. Again, I wasn’t naive. But I was desperate. 

I would have done *anything* to be pretty.

I’d almost forgotten about the mask when it arrived a month later, postmarked from some fulfillment warehouse I didn’t recognize and covered with warnings to not freeze the contents. 

It was a clean little squeeze bottle, soft pink with girlish text emblazoned over an image of a fairy calling the product “Nymph.” 

“Nymph” had very specific instructions.

Once a day, I had to:

* Expose my face to steam for ten minutes *exactly*.
* Scrub the mask thoroughly into my skin to let the exfoliating beads “really clean out my pores.”
* Let it sit for 15 minutes- they said “*exactly*” again here.
* Rinse it off gently with cool water. 

A little odd, but I’d seen weirder online. At least I didn’t have to tape my mouth shut.

I followed the instructions to the letter with my nightly routine. Wiping steam from the mirror I looked into the smeary reflection once, twice, half-bent over my counter in disbelief, practically crawling against the mirror to make sure I was seeing this correctly.

The greasy-black mottle of my pores was completely changed: tan, toned, tight. Even more than that, I looked *good*. Dewy and supple; My face felt smoother, softer. Tolerable. 

It’s so embarrassing to say, looking back on it, but I cried. I felt this awful weight lift off of me, like I could start living. Like I could finally, *finally* be beautiful.

The itching started three days afterwards. 

It was mild at first, like an allergic reaction. Irritating, but the kind of thing I could mostly ignore. The day after, though, it had gone from a whispering annoyance to the only thing I could focus on. It was like something microscopic was chewing on the inside of my pores. 

It was unbearable. The second I stopped itching, the horrible sensation came back ten times worse. 

My coworkers gossiped as I dug my nails into my flesh, gawking at the blood under my fingernails.

I stopped using the mask, of course. I switched to sensitive skin cleaners and changed my washcloths constantly. I started taking Benadryl even though it made me nod off at work. I made plea after plea to my traitorous skin.

But it never let up. My face radiated heat, raw and painfully sensitive from my obsessive clawing. 

When I ran my hands along my irritated skin I felt bumps forming just under the surface. Over the next few days they grew hard like tiny plastic beads nestled in my pores. I tried to tell my coworkers and my few close friends that I’d been camping and gotten bit by mosquitos, but they were clearly unconvinced.

It was only after they doubled in size that I realized the depth of my mistake.



–--



*Maybe it’s cystic acne*, I thought bitterly, halfway through my nightly routine. I was pushing down on a particularly pernicious bump on my jaw, as if that could flatten the surface. *As if I couldn’t get any uglier.*

It pushed back.

It was quick. A split-second twitch. But clear as day I felt a tiny *something* squirm under my fingertip. I flinched back and honest-to-God yelped.

I gathered up my courage and pressed a fingertip to my jaw once again. The bump was fever-warm, churning and knotting like a microscopic menstrual cramp.

It could’ve been my pulse, I tried to rationalize. A trick of my mind. 

But I knew it was more than that. I knew how my pulse felt, and this wasn’t it.

*Fuck this*, I thought to myself. Any dermatologist or beauty guru worth their salt knows that popping your pimples is risky. You might introduce bacteria from your hands into the open wound you create. But anyone who’s actually struggled with bad skin knows having them gone is worth any temporary grossness. Especially those who couldn’t look any worse, like myself.

With the scrutiny of a surgeon I pinched the twitching bump between my fingers. My reflection stared back mutely, puffy eyes narrowed and thin mouth pressed into an ugly line. 

*Twitch. Twitch.*

I pushed out the itching of the other growths, honing on this one, pushing harder, harder, the bump giving way then suddenly rigid again- growing.

*Defending itself.* 

“God damn it, come *on!”* I grunted, pushing back harder until the pustule burst with a painful wet *squelch*, sending vile chunky fluid from my pore. 

It hit the sink basin and I immediately started to wash it down the drain, disgusted at myself. 

As the glob of fluid spun around the drain and vanished inside, I caught a brief glimpse of something that turned my stomach. A soft translucent shape, bristling with little spines.

Insect legs.

“I’m sorry, ma’am,” the dermatology center’s receptionist said with a rehearsed pity that conveyed the exact opposite. “I understand you’re experiencing some skin concerns, but Dr. Kemper is at a symposium until next Monday. Even then, with our limited availability…” 

“I’m better off going to urgent care?!” I cut her off. She was the tenth receptionist to tell me the same thing and I was tired of hearing it. My voice rose into a desperate cracking yell. “I *went* to Urgent Care. They told me to see a dermatologist, and I called nine other fucking offices who completely shut me down, and now I’m here about to get turned away AGAIN when my face is covered in these- these tiny tumors and *you won’t just let me see a fucking dermatologist!*”

There was a lengthy pause. 

I felt a throbbing growth push up from the epidermis of my cheek, one of too many. They were the size of marbles at this point- nearly tripling since the incident the night before.

“There’s something wrong with me,” I choked out, trying my best not to let on that I was starting to cry. I failed miserably.

She sighed, either out of annoyance and pity. I heard her long manicured nails tap tap tapping on her keyboard for a moment before she finally said, 

“Dr. Kemper is getting in late next Monday, but he lives near the office. I can tell him about your- … pressing concerns, and he can see you after close. 7:30.”

I accepted immediately, so overcome with relief I didn’t even thank her. 

It was only after the call that the grim reality set in: I’d have to wait eight days for an answer.



\---



My already flaccid social life withered and died. I spent each day leading up to the appointment obsessing over everything dermatology; almost losing my job one day when my boss caught me looking at scabies instead of spreadsheets. 

I found articles on allergies and contact dermatitis, on oil clogs and hives. All things that could cause itching and lesions, yes, but nothing as rapidly growing as what I had. I tried searching up the brand Nymph, and only found pictures of storybook fairies and articles. I scrolled for hours and never found that account again.

Soon, I didn’t have to look over my shoulder anymore. My skin had gotten so bad that I was practically forced to take sick time so my open-air officemates wouldn’t have to look at the oozing buds pulsing all along the bridge of my nose. 

I told my friends I needed some time to myself and ignored their messages of sympathy. I didn’t want them to see me deteriorate.

The little pinprick blackheads I used to torture myself over were dwarfed by these massive, painful grape-sized knots. The tan I’d mistaken for skin turned to a larval off-white, globes of maggot meat pushed greedily against the walls of my epidermis.

Like they were testing the limits, seeing how far I could be molded. How big they could grow.

  
\---



In my dreams I woke up in a deep, dark cave. It was so dim that I could barely make out the shape of its walls with my straining eyes.

It was humid- the kind of muggy heat that you drink more than breathe. I felt every clammy spot of my body, felt beads of sweat and rank cave condensation drip down the back of my elongated spine.

Miraculously, I couldn’t feel the bumps or their painful itch anymore. I tried to grope my face, so happy to be free of my pain, but I couldn’t reach to touch.

*I couldn’t move at all.* 

Panic gripped me. I tried to break free, undulating from side to side, but it was no good. I was tangled in myself, encased in some sort of membranous hull.

I craned my neck, trying uselessly to see what could be holding me, and felt a fresh horror when I pressed my digits against the greasy walls of my prison.

It was breathing. 

I shrieked with foreign lungs and the echo shook the pulsing sack’s walls, sending more rank liquid on my face and into my open mouth. *Pus.*

This was no cave. It was a coffin, and I would die if I couldn’t escape.

I gagged, spluttering and choking on the disgusting fluid. I was like a prey animal, desperately moving in any way I could to escape my confines- flailing my limbs against the thin material, feeling it start to give, to shred, yes, yes, let me out!

The air was growing thin, the smell of my own body repulsive, the sound of my scratching like a thousand insect legs, I kept slipping on oil and pus but I dug against the walls, began chewing with all my strength, swallowing chunks of bitter rubbery lining, my vision growing blurry with the lack of oxygen, but freedom so close, nearly something I could identify, until I was jolting upright in bed.

I tried to catch my panicked breath, tried to forget the whole thing and get as much sleep as my painful bumps would allow.

Even in the cold-sweat stark truth of my room, I swore I could still hear my desperate scratching. 

Somewhere distant, but steadily growing closer.

“So, Lindsay. I’ve heard you’ve been suffering from some unpleasant dermatitis?” Dr. Kemper was a short, bald little man whose shiny head looked like a hardboiled egg on a little serving cup. His nasally voice sounded like a bad pastiche of Kermit The Frog, but it was music to my ears.

 I’d made it eight days somehow. 

He gave me a pitying smile as he saw how covered up I was; a cloth face mask and beanie leaving only a little exposed skin for me to perch sunglasses on. The soft fabric of the mask was like broken glass against my weeping skin.

I opened my mouth to respond, but my face pulsated indignantly. Clearly, the bumps wanted to speak for themselves, so I took off my face coverings without a word. 

Doctors, in my experience, are good at keeping their cool. They're taught how to be compassionate and collected; to keep the severity of a situation away from their worried patient.

Dr. Kemper’s wide-eyed stare betrayed that facade.

“Well.” He gawped. “I’m glad you came in to see us.”

I told him everything in halting bursts. The ad, the mask, how my complexion had gone from mildly irritated to colonized within two weeks. He didn’t recognize the skincare brand either, let alone the kind of “allergic reaction” it was giving my skin. 

After that, I gave him the squeeze bottle of that damn mask and let him pull a little fluid from my face.  Even with the size of my growths, I felt every millimeter of the cold needle plunging in, felt myself grow just a little lighter without some of my contents.

I’d suffered for eight days straight only to be sent back out in less than thirty minutes, with some prescription cream and a promise that they would run tests on the mask and sample as soon as their technician could manage. Every bump on the uneasy ride to the pharmacy brought on a fresh wave of squirming. I hid my face as best I could, calculating how to get my medicine and leave in the least amount of steps.

None of that would matter.

“Lindsay?”

Shit.

I knew that voice instantly. I’d heard it so often, singing along off-key to terrible pop music, joking about shitty bosses, giving me the “It’s not you it’s me” speech.

Megan was across the aisle grabbing vitamins. Even in running clothes she was gorgeous, face aglow with a faint sheen of exertion, sun-kissed complexion still dewy in the harsh drugstore lighting. She approached me like a compassionate zookeeper approaches a frightened animal: slowly, with a gentle smile and apologetic eyes. 

My warm breath was fogging up my sunglasses, the heat of my skin permeated my mask. My sweat stung the swollen nodules that crowded the corners of my vision, like tumorous walnuts pressing insistently against each other. 

Why was she here? 

Why *now?*

“I’m sick,” was all I could blurt out, taking a step away from her. One wrong move, one twitch of a pustule and she would know. She would see the monster I’d turned into, see just how right she was to dump me. 

Mercifully she stopped. We stood three shelves apart, like a standoff from a terrible spaghetti western. 

“That sucks,” she said with a sympathetic wince. “I’m- look, I’m sorry I bothered you. I know it’s shitty to try and do this here, but I just don’t love how things went when…”

Her lips kept moving, but I couldn’t hear a word. Megan’s voice, the canned muzak on the shop speakers, the ambient noise of shoppers was all drowned out by a cacophony of muffled wriggling.

Something I felt more than heard, like the sound of fluid in bronchial lungs. Millions of microscopic legs crawling on my bone marrow. 

Insistent. Getting louder by the second.

My stomach lurched in nausea as the awful tumors on my face quivered, so heavy and obvious that I could no longer mistake them for anything other than independently living *things* that were now awake and writhing deep inside of my epidermis.

Dozens of masses, both ticklish and torturous as their contents writhed, pushed and pressed against me, testing the limits of their little confines and desperate to get OUT. 

Each spasm was a railroad spike of blinding pain straight through my frontal lobe. Each part of my face, my bloated cheeks, my squashed tomato nose, the papery skin under my dull eyes, was alight with a sea of ebbing and flowing agony as the bumps that blanketed my face began to split and crack, weeping foul clear fluid that seeped through my face mask. 

“And so my therapist was saying that maybe- Jesus, Linds, are you okay?!”

“F-Fuck off!” I cried out, each sound my mouth shaped out agitating the shuddering masses more and cracking my abused skin, fresh blood mixing with spoiled pus, a rank serum dribbling into my mouth.

I was sprinting out before she could say anything more, shoving past shoppers and workers, hands clamping my sodden face mask down tight, hoping that the dribbling liquid could form a sort of plaster and keep the inevitable from happening. 

*I know you feel insecure.*

Two blocks from my condo. I had to survive two more blocks, I didn’t have the medicine but it couldn’t do anything for me now. Nothing could. 

*I do too.*

I ran, not caring about traffic or who I had to shove aside to get home, lungs burning, skin burning, brain burning, everything on fire with all-consuming pain and fear, Oh God, get out of my way, don’t look at me!

*Don’t you deserve a change?* 

My ankle caught on the curb and I stumbled, barely catching myself and sending my hands slamming into my chin in the process. My vision went white with pain, a pustule opened in an explosion of squelching fluid and I felt the awful relief of its weight spilling onto the ground below me. 

*Don’t you deserve to feel beautiful?*

A passerby screams. I don’t stay to see what fell out of me- I’m almost home, the red-stucco roof of the condo two houses over, just one last push and I’ll be away from all these people, their prying eyes, their disgusted stares-

*I can give you that.*

I turned the key in the door, staggered into the dim living room with a ragged cry of triumph, half-ran half-limped to the sink, leaving a trail of chunky blood clots and fluid in my wake, my face revolting, escaping itself.

*When I say I saw differences after just one use I* ***mean it****, girl.*

I was terrified to take off the mask, even as the squirming noise became a deafening drone, even as the pustules broke further and further open, even as I knew what I would find. 

*My pores haven’t been the same since.*

I didn’t even need to peel the mask off. They did it for me.

One right after the other, hundreds of frantic pinchers and insect legs shredded their egg casings and burst from every pore on my face- chitinous bodies snaking out from my flesh. Every covering I’d put on my face was pushed aside by the weight of a hundred giant centipedes hatching from my soft tissue, my vision completely obscured by the writhing of long insectoid bodies and greedily scrabbling legs, my eyes swam with tears and the pain of my countless offspring using them for leverage to climb fully out of the eggs I’d been gestating for weeks now. 

All I heard was the chattering of carapaces and soft clicking of pinchers on my abused flesh. All I could feel was the awful, hideous pushing- like fingers forcing their way out.

Every sense I once held dear was forfeit. 

My body wasn’t mine anymore. I was nothing more than a host. 

I tried to focus my eyes against the unbelievable torture, tried to find my nose that I’d hated so much amidst the sea of carnage.

I wanted to die. I wanted someone, some merciful bystander, to set my condo on fire with me in it. I wanted every trace of my hideous face burned to ash. 

With a broken scream, I grabbed a tight handful of the wriggling insects still half-lodged in my face, and pulled with all my might.

Blinding pain gave way to nothingness.



\---



Lemon-scented sterility. 

A bright light pierced my vision.

A low whistle of wind.

Pain. Unimaginable pain. 

Awareness came in horrible waves, one sensation crashing into me at a time until I was awake in a hospital room. 

I gripped the hem of my thin paper gown. That was real. 

I ran my hands along my hated body, feeling the solid warmth. I was alive. 

I hovered my shaking fingers over my face. I couldn’t see myself, but I couldn’t see the insects either. 

Slowly, hesitantly, I touched my cheek…

And felt my fingers slide easily into the massive holes in my face.

No no no *no NO* *NO* ***NO*** *–* 

I started shrieking in pain, in terror, each cavernous flesh pit quivering with my voice, each gasping inhale sending air whistling through the perforated sack of screaming meat I had become. 

The nurses ran in, trying to calm me while shouting out codes, bringing an attendant to prick me with a syringe as I jammed my fingers deeper into my ruined epidermis, desperate to tear at the exposed nerves and end it–



\---



They had to keep me sedated for several days. I needed multiple serious skin grafts, stitches, and around-the-clock observation for a week after I woke up to keep me from hurting myself.

The doctors didn’t believe me at first. They’d never seen someone with their pores carved open like this and thought it was self-inflicted.

That changed when the dermatologist came back with those test results. The mask was teeming with centipede eggs; the careful instructions on use just ensured my face was the perfect hatchery. 

The authorities got involved, and keep telling me they’re looking into it. I doubt they’ll find anything. I’ve asked on multiple subreddits, looked everywhere I could, and I can’t find any indication the account I saw ever even existed.

When I look in the mirror, I see a patchwork quilt of scar tissue and grafted flesh. I used to dream of the day where I wouldn’t recognize my reflection. I would give anything to have my face back, every single flaw.

I’m recovering now as best as I can. Physical therapy has helped, but I’ll never be the same. 

All I can do now is share my story. I hope it can help someone out there. 

If you have read this far, thank you. And please, whatever you do, do *not* buy skincare from the TikTok shop. You never know what could be living in it.
