What's your favorite pizza topping? Mine’s sausage. I’m not sure what kind of meat they put in it, but it's heavenly — savory, bold, with that hint of spice that lingers after you’ve swallowed.

We went in Ben’s car. No point in using quadruple the gas. Even though I live furthest away, they had to pick me up — it was my birthday.

The entrance is in a back alley on the shady side of town. No signs. No lights. No competitors. It screams exclusivity.

I saw this place on Insta. Romeo’s Pizza. Great reviews. A delicious menu and all-you-can-eat pizza.

I hadn't eaten since breakfast, so I was definitely going to get my money’s worth.

After we walked in the unimpressive, narrow door, the interior was strikingly large for such a shitty entrance. It reminded me of a 50s-style diner, but it wasn’t trying hard. Just basic furniture — red metal tables and white walls.

Not at all the fancy atmosphere I expected, but the reviews were about the food — and besides, the pizza is endless.

The lights were uncomfortably bright. The kind of bright white light they use in hospital surgery rooms.

I can't believe how round the restaurant is. It's rare you enter a room and it’s perfectly round.

Just three doors: the entrance, the labeled bathroom, and presumably the kitchen. All have identical red metal doors.

“Bro, these lights are brighter than the gym,” said Scott, eyes squinting under his thick brow.

“What the hell, I thought this place was fancy,” added Vanessa. “Well, I better get an amazing cheese pull to make up for this fast food–ass vibe.”

Scott laughed. “Don’t be a bitch, Vanessa. It’s Mitch's birthday — let's loosen up, have some drinks, some pizza, and celebrate.”

As much as I appreciated Ben standing up for me, I didn’t really care. He’s always too busy partying and with other friends. Plus I had an odd feeling.

This place was empty, and I mean empty. Not even a few people hiding in the back.

A thought crossed my mind. “Did you guys reserve this place or something?”

Vanessa smiled. “Happy Birthday, Mitch! I may have DM’d them on Insta.”

“Well, did they reply?” I asked.

“No, but I bet they want to surprise me — I… I mean, us,” she said softly.

Everyone chuckled like one of those inside jokes no one quite gets.

No way a whole restaurant would close for Vanessa. I get it — she’s stunningly attractive, but not actually at an influencer level.

Unless she has a secret OnlyFans or something. Oh man, I gotta look that up when I get home.

“You good, man?” asked Ben, snapping me out of it.

“Yeah,” I replied. “Let’s sit down.”

We sat down in a large booth. I was glad that the seats were surprisingly comfortable.

We caught up for a while — about everyone’s lives, my university, Scott’s parties, Ben’s gym gains, and Vanessa’s influencer hustle. The usual stuff.

After around ten minutes, a robot scooted over. One of those waiter bots you see online from, I think, Japan. With a touchscreen for a face and an innocent little smile. It was cool — my first time seeing anything like it.

It didn't make a sound. We all looked at each other, confused, and one by one stood up and punched in our pizza orders.

“Are you serious?” asked Scott as the robot scurried away. “The only fucking drink they have is iced tea. I wanted a beer and a shot.” A frown grew across his face.

“Whatever, man. Beer has so many empty calories,” replied Ben, unfazed.

Vanessa giggled. “Yeah, it's almost bikini season. I’m gonna have a hot-girl summer.”

Scott, Ben, and I made eye contact. A silent mutual cringe.

“Plus, come on, man, you need to save room for endless pizza,” I added.

“I guess, man. I am ready to destroy some pizza,” replied Scott.

Four robots delivered our pizza.

I placed mine in front of me, mouth watering.

Sausage and pepperoni with a thick layer of cheese. I bet it’s one of those premium Italian cheese blends that melt just right.

I never questioned what's in the meat — who ever does?

The crust was that perfect golden — crispy but not too crispy, not floppy — riding that majestic border between thin and thick.

The lights made the beauty of the pizza emanate.

I grew impatient as the savory aroma reached my stomach and it gargled.

“Okay, guys, just wait,” said Vanessa, holding her phone.

She slowly pulled a slice while recording herself.

“There we go, guys, perfect cheese pull.”

I wasn't sure if she was talking to us or her followers. As ridiculous as she was, it was an immaculate cheese pull. The stretch going and going.

Almost — unnatural.

**Section II**

The pizza was even better than I expected. Imagine your favorite pizza place and crank the flavor dial up by 20. It was as if I unlocked a new sense of taste — a part of the brain that made me a super taster.

I was stuffed after my third, and so was Scott.

Ben had two — something about his diet.

It was so fucking stupid. Vanessa didn’t even touch hers — apparently she doesn’t like pizza. I wish her followers knew how much of a weirdo she actually is.

We were all completely gorged. A euphoric food coma. The best thing you can eat.

Scott was quiet, slouched into his seat. None of us talked much — that heavy, satisfied silence after eating too much.

These aren’t small pizzas. They feel like they’re meant to fill more than your stomach.

“Guys, when do you think the bill will come? My data isn't working. I at least want to step outside to post this,” said Vanessa, who at this point was checked out.

I’d usually snap some pictures, but it’s too good to care.

Eventually Ben got up to see if he could fetch somebody.

There has to be somebody in the back, right? Of course there’s chefs — only a chef could make pizza this good. This isn’t some tasteless, cardboard, factory-frozen crap.

Ben yelled at the door until it turned to mild profanity and stormed back.

“Well, let's just go. If they don’t want our money, we’re out.”

Vanessa shot to her feet, but Scott and I stayed completely overcome.

These seats have a way of swallowing you — giving you no reason to stand.

It took a few more minutes of convincing, but we were all on our feet. I honestly could have gone for one more pizza before leaving.

As we walked over the shiny white floors, I felt at ease. This is a place where you can really relax and go get a slice — hell, go get 20 slices — even one hundred.

When Ben pulled the door, all of our hearts sank.

The door didn’t budge.

Relief hit when the kitchen door snapped open and a robot scurried over to us.

“Thank God — it’s probably bringing our bill. Once we pay, the door will unlock,” I said.

The cute little robot scurried over with its usual uncanny face. It stopped in front of us all.

Suddenly the face disappeared, the screen switching to a message.

“Please — stay and eat until you are full.”

**Section III**

I never knew how long it took for someone to starve.

It’s hard to tell time in here.

Ben had all sorts of crazy ideas — government experiment, aliens, North Korea. And honestly, he’s not wrong. Who gets trapped with unlimited pizza?

She said she didn't want to be like us. None of us really understood what that meant.

I remember her decaying until she had no meat on her bones.

Eventually her shirt seemed too small for her. Her cleavage was visible. But I didn’t really care. I don’t think about sex much anymore.

She refused to eat at all. Ben stayed disciplined, eating just enough to maintain.

Scott and I — we ate when we were hungry.

You’d think I’d get tired of it, but this pizza’s different.

Every slice feels new. Every bite hits perfect.

There’s always another combination waiting.

Of course we tried to escape. Ben screamed at every door, even tried kicking them down.

Vanessa used to help him, but she doesn't have much energy anymore. It’s unbelievable — she won't take a single slice. She’d rather starve than eat what we eat.

Ben even tried to fight the robots.

They are shockingly sturdy — heavy. Must be titanium or something. Not even Ben could move them.

He wanted us all to break the front door down. We helped the first couple times. No luck.

The pizza never stops coming.

I never know when it’s breakfast, lunch, or dinner. When my stomach asks, I eat.

It’s not as bad as you’d think. Do you ever get sick of making food, or even earning money to buy food? All of that’s taken care of.

I mean, don’t get me wrong.

Of course I want out.

Ben's eyes burned with fury.

He spent days making plans, shouting at the walls, ranting half-baked theories about government labs and alien experiments.

At one point he said we are in some kind of purgatory — dead in a car crash on the way over.

No way. It’s probably just a glitch. Or maybe we’re on a game show?

Looking back, I always hoped Vanessa and I could be more than friends. Guess I should’ve known better.

It was around day twenty.

I don’t know why she didn’t eat.

A shell of her old self.

All that because she was too fucking good to eat pizza?

That morning she didn’t wake up. Ben nudged her shoulder, but nothing.

It was the first time I ever saw them.

I like to think of them as the cooks.

Beautiful humans with asymmetric faces.

Their lack of emotion was unsettling.

They didn’t even move when Ben started screaming.

They didn’t even react.

It was a swift display of dominance.

Ben rushed them — barreled straight toward a needle that extended from its arm. Without hesitation, it plunged into his heart.

He never had a chance. Why the fuck did he rush them like that?

We quietly watched as they took the bodies.

I lost two friends that day.

**Finale**

The next year or so was actually pretty good.

Scott and I joked around, wrestled, and daydreamed.

But what we did the most was eat.

We didn’t need entertainment, sex, tobacco, beer — nothing.

I guess it’s that good.

It’s hard to tell someone’s getting fat when you see them every day.

Scott’s breathing got heavier, though.

I’m glad there are no mirrors in here. Not like I’d care anyway.

One morning he slept in late. The chefs came in, grabbed him, and left.

I wonder if it was heart disease from the pizza.

Sometimes I imagine he’s fine at home with his family again.

I stopped counting around 500 days.

I don’t wanna have a heart attack, but it’s too good to stop.

I think about them sometimes — my friends, my family, my dog.

I scratch the paint on the doors until it flakes under my nails. I write things down, but they don’t always make sense.

It helps, I think.

I’d really like to know what’s in a sausage.

It’s the best topping on the menu.

With a medium crust.

WHAT’S IN THE SAUSAGE?

Pineapple for breakfast.

Olives for lunch.

Infinite combinations.

Every day.
