Bram Stoker once wrote, "I want you to believe in things that you cannot". 

Personally, I don't care what you believe. I'm not a whistle-blower and this isn't some hackneyed way of selling state secrets to some foreign intelligence. But it doesn't hurt to have a little life insurance via semi-public documentation, seeing as how I'm way off protocol already.

My name is... 

Let's go with Sarah Kerrigan. Queen bitch of the universe. I used to play a lot of StarCraft as a kid, so call it a private joke. Maybe by the end you'll get it. 

I've been recently educated on the power of Names, so forgive me if I'm not too inclined to just toss my real one around. Plus I'm already partially doxxing myself with this self-leaked manifesto, so I don't need extra information spreading out there. 

Besides, names are like weapons sometimes. You never know when or how they'll get used.

People like Stoker understood this. 

Shakespeare did too. 

But we'll get to that motherfucker later.

1

It all started because of a school shooting incident.

I've been with the FBI's Behavioral Analysis unit (i.e. "profilers") for less than a year, but got a chance to observe and do menial tasks on a couple of interesting cases. 

One case even received mild public attention ("Hedgehog Killer" in Michigan, couple years back).

My involvement was mostly tangential, though. I certainly wasn't doing any of the actual profiling work. But between coffee runs, paperwork, and the investigatory equivalent of deciphering illegibly hand-written lunch orders, I got to sit in, listen, and learn about building a theory of mind framework based on behavior patterns from the bureau's leading persona compilers.

My first hands-on experience came after a kid by the name of Todd Dryler went into a South Florida high school with his dad's .22, shot two teachers and five fellow students before taking his own life in his home ec classroom.

Being still very much a junior agent, I had been tasked with the menial labor of post-event interviews. There wasn't a case to build, and the FBI usually doesn't handle these sorts of non-federal incidents unless there's some sort of massive fuck up. 

But with the uptick in teenage mass shooting events year after year, the bureau has made efforts to update its psychological datasets.

The assignment was to interview witnesses and survivors in order to catalogue relevant perpetrator personality traits for an in-development "early warning signs" prediction system. Who the shooters associated with, what they were like at school, how they behaved online (yes, Big Brother IS watching. Deal with it.)

All this to say -- I wasn't sent to catch anyone, just to go ask a few general questions.

Five killed. Three witnesses. Shooter dead at the scene.

Open and shut case.

Looked like it anyway.

2

We were watching the CCTV footage from the high school when my FTO (field training officer) noticed something strange.

"The kid don't run."

Special Agent Fred Hauler had been with the Bureau for nearly 40 years, roughly 25 of which with Violent Crime Analysis. Inching up on retirement, Fred had been relegated to what he dubbed "chaperone gigs" - overseeing junior agents like myself as we take our first, Bambi-legged steps into a criminal psychology investigation. 

Needless to say, Fred - a proud, twang-heavy Texan - wasn't exactly enthusiastic, and made zero effort to pretend otherwise. But while he mostly kept to a begrudging silence and half-lidded disinterest, on occasion, his four-decade-career instincts would spark back up. 

And when they did, buddy, you had better been paying attention. 

I was incredibly fortunate to have him as a partner.

"Which kid doesn't run?" 

"Right there." Fred tapped at the corner of the monitor, where you could just barely make out a pair of blue sneakers standing still. 

Kids had fled the hallway just seconds before the shooter came prowling through. But apparently, not all of them.

Thanks to Fred, we found an unusual point of interest.

It seemed like there was a kid standing there, just shy of the camera's full view, while the shooter was moving through the hall.

"Frozen in fear maybe?" I suggested.

Fred clicked his tongue.

"Does happen, sure. Rare, though. Not this long too. 'specially not after--"

On the CCTV, Todd (the shooter) had fired a few rounds at a locker.

"--they start shooting."

The hidden feet in the blue sneakers didn't even jump. In fact, one foot was tapping. Like an impatient tick.

I felt my brow furrow.

"What's he doing just standing there?"

"What's it look like?"

Fred gave me one of his "catch up" glances, which he reserved for obvious questions with obvious answers. 

"I guess it looks like he's... watching."

3

We identified the blue sneakers kid as Edwin Siebon. 

He was one of the witnesses.

In fact, it was those same blue sneakers that greeted us when Edwin Siebon answered the door at his home.

A shaggy mop of hair and that lanky build plenty of teenage boys foster, some until their late twenties.

I remember thinking Edwin looked like he just got off woodshop class or maybe was just way into 90s chic, 'cause he had a pencil tucked behind his ear and a notebook sticking out of his red/black flannel's breast pocket. 

On the drive over, Fred had suggested I take point on the interview. Dive headfirst into the hands-on experience. We even did a last minute prep right after we parked. 

And still, this being my first genuine face-to-face with a potential criminal suspect, I let the moment get to me.

I froze.

Thank God Fred was there to stir me out of my stumble with a quick fake cough. I snapped into autopilot, holding up my big shiny FBI badge to do the movie thing:

"How are you doing, Edwin? I'm special agent Sarah Kerrigan this is special agent Fred Hauler. We spoke on the phone?"

I gritted a smile through my embarrassment, which made me feel like a total amateur.

"Right," Edwin mumbled, then smirked. "The feds... I heard you were talking to people."

There was barely disguised derision there, but Fred and I didn't take it personally. Angsty teenagers and aversion to authority kind of goes hand in hand.

Besides, although the concept of 'building rapport' with interviewees has become a cliche, it's a fundamental part of the work.

Your beloved TV Gods lied to you. Law & Order ain't real life. People don't just spontaneously confess to felonies, nor do they have a miraculous come to Jesus moment after a melodramatic shouting match. 

Us mere mortal federal investigators have to work hard for our confessions.

So I kept my smile up.

"May we come in?"

The living room of Edwin's small Craftsman-style home was kind of musty and sparsely decorated.

"Are your parents home?" I asked. 

Edwin was eighteen already, so we didn't need them, but sometimes a parent's presence can help. Scowls from mom and dad can create significant pressure on some juvenile suspects. Depending on the parents, of course.

"Mom died when I was a kid," Edwin said as he plopped down on the La-Z-Boy in front of his TV. "Dad's out somewhere, I dunno. But we can talk, don't need to bother him."

Fred and I shared a glance. Teenagers typically prefer having their parents present. Edwin's indifference, maybe even reluctance for his father to be there, was a bit unusual. At the very least it hinted at a tenuous relationship.

Fred and I took the couch across from Edwin.

His general expression looked apathetic. The other witnesses we interviewed were visibly nervous. Not because they were hiding something, but because they knew us being there meant they had to relive the experience of that violent day.

People can vary quite a bit in their trauma responses. Sobbing, frustration, general agitation. Even humor as a coping mechanism is far more common than you'd expect. But you typically see the same standard reactions with small deviations from those familiar patterns. 

Not Edwin. Nothing about him suggested he'd witnessed the murder of two of his classmates, or had experienced any danger himself.

He just looked... bored.

"So..." Edwin intoned. "What's up?"

He leaned his recliner back so he was staring at the ceiling. An old water stain had discolored the plaster directly above him.

"Like I said on the phone, we wanted to ask you a few questions about your classmate Todd Dryler. Help us gather some background information, who he hung out with, what he was like at school, that sort of stuff."

Edwin barely shrugged his shoulders. 

"Why does the FBI care about Todd? He's just some loser."

"Well he did shoot a couple kids at a high school," Fred interjected, visibly annoyed. "Sort of thing that tends to pop up on our radar, you know?"

We were meant to be taking a tentative approach.

The French have a saying that a frog won't jump out of a boiling cook pot if you increase the heat gradually.

Same goes for people. The idea is, you don't have enough to charge, let alone accuse. You may only have a hunch even. So you wanna tip toe.

Don't spook 'em. Cook the frog slowly.

Fred had opted for a different approach. Maybe it was his looming retirement or just utter jadedness with the job, but he was staring Edwin down with the most obvious "I see through your bullshit" sneer I've ever seen. 

Reminded me of a gunslinger's standoff, right before all the pistols go off.

"We're trying to understand people like Todd," I chimed in with a cooler tone. "To learn why they do what he did."

Edwin perked up a little.

"Why do you think he did it?"

"I mean, that's kind of what we're here to ask you, right?"

A twitch of amusement flickered on Edwin's face. I figured he was thinking something along the lines of: touch√©e.

I glanced over to Fred, who nodded slowly. Yeah, I saw it.

"And since we're already talking about it," I added, trying to sound casual. "Why do you think he did it? Was Todd bullied a lot or--"

Edwin chuckled. "That's Hollywood shit. Some kids get bullied a little, some get bullied a lot, sure, but everyone just suffers through it. Takes a real kind of loser to just come into school one day and start blasting."

Again, no real trauma response, unless you wanna say it was denial. But it felt more like uncaring dismissal. 

"Interesting," I said, which is a nice way of disagreeing without being confrontational. "You know, in college I studied criminal psychology. And from what I've read, bullying has actually been shown to contribute to--"

"It wasn't bullying," Edwin insisted, finally detaching his eyes from the ceiling. "Todd wishes he would've been bullied. At least then someone would pay him any attention."

"What do you mean, Edwin?"

"He was invisible."

"You mean socially? He didn't have friends?"

"He didn't have a soul."

I waited for Edwin to elaborate.

"I don't mean in the spiritual sense or whatever. I mean he was an empty person. He barely had enough hobbies to rub together into a personality. He was a boring, trivial excuse for a living creature who wasn't going to do anything with his life or amount to anything other than some background blur in somebody else's existence."

Edwin's open derision toward Todd made sense considering the intense trauma created from witnessing such an event. But it was his tone that seemed off. Anger, frustration, those would've been more than understandable. They would've been, for lack of a better word, normal.

But under Edwin's casual apathy there was a layer of what felt like arrogant disdain. The kind reserved for those one finds to be "beneath them".

I decided to try a little probe.

"Did Todd tell you all this?"

"No, the Easter bunny did."

I ignored his retort and pushed on the point.

"Did he tell you he felt he was an empty person?"

Edwin simply shrugged.

"Maybe I embellished a little."

He couldn't resist a little smirk.

I glanced at Fred, who had his teeth clenched, simmering. So I pressed on.

"Were you and Todd good friends?"

Edwin scoffed.

"Well, gee, he didn't shoot me, so I guess we must've been BFFs or something, huh? Is that what you're getting at? Trying to find out why he didn't kill me?"

"We're just looking for information."

It's vital to keep your composure when the subject lashes out. Manipulators often use this to force a diversion from a line of questioning they want to avoid.

Innocent people can also lash out when faced with a damning question. But that usually happens when you ask it, not well in advance, at the foothill of the path towards the eventual accusation.

Narcissists and sociopaths tend to do that quite a bit.

Look, I wasn't diagnosing Edwin. Any good psychotherapist will tell you it's bad practice to diagnose someone within a couple minutes. The human psyche is a little too nuanced to over-the-counter psychoanalyze like that.  

But I wasn't worried about getting disbarred, and when it comes to assessing a person's involvement in a criminal case, every tiny detail is a potential clue.

As the great Lester Freamon from The Wire once said (way cooler than I ever could): all the pieces matters.

Something in my expression must've given something away, because Edwin's face shifted to something that gave me pause.

"What is it that you think you've found?"

His entire demeanor changed. From a detached teenage indifference to something more focused, more mature, and maybe, with a little grinning sneer curling out the corner of his mouth, just a little more cruel.

"What is it that you think you've seen?"

The disinterested numbness was out of his voice now. Replaced by a flatter, slightly lilting tone. 

It was almost flirtatious.

I must've gotten distracted by Edwin's sudden shift because Fred jumped in, nearly making me stir.

"We watched the CCTV footage, Edwin."

Edwin didn't even flinch.

"Did you see me?"

"We did." I found my voice again. "You were following Todd around."

"No," Edwin said, as if he was a rigid schoolteacher scolding two dimwitted students. "Did you see ME?"

"In crystal clear 4K, pal" Fred shot back, the accusation tense in his voice. "Probably should've mapped out the corners a little more carefully. Caught those fancy shoes of yours standing there like a tourist."

Fred's impatience got the better of him, 'cause he didn't even pause to let the accusation hang there.

"So what's the deal, Todd tell you what he was gonna do and you just wanted to watch, or maybe the two of you plan this out together? Come one, help us out..."

"Plan it together?" Edwin spat out a chuckle, face scrunched up in contempt. "Since when does a lion consult a sheep on how to best cull the herd?"

Fred exhaled his frustration. He leaned in, eyes glaring.

"Looks like somebody watched too much Game of Thrones."

"You're right. Needs a bit more weight to make it feel right. Something more like Oppenheimer's I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."

It was a blatant tease and Fred was having none of it.

"Kid, please. You are completely full of yourself. You think you're impressing me with your edge-lord rhetoric? A big bad lion you are? Please. Know what you look like to me? A coward. Goddamn... armadillo is more like it. Just curl into a ball while your boy does all the dirty work."

There are a couple of ways to prompt a suspect into divulging incriminating information through an emotional reaction. Antagonizing them is probably the big one.

And Fred was playing that full hand. If he was playing at all, 'cause he seemed genuinely pissed.

Edwin, however, wasn't baited. Just flattened his mouth into a thin smile.

"The world is governed by those capable of persuading others into getting their hands dirty."

He paused for dramatic effect.

"The Unabomber wrote that."

Edwin stared at Fred and I with smug satisfaction as he took out the notebook from his breast pocket and pulled the pencil from behind his ear.

"It's amazing what you can find online," he added and started to jot something down across the paper.

Fred and I shared a confused look.

"What are you writing?"

Edwin said nothing, but it was quickly clear he wasn't writing. He was drawing something. A strange, crude symbol.

"Look Edwin, we're just trying to understand --"

Edwin had finished drawing but kept ignoring us. He tore off the page from the notebook and then tore it again into two halves.

"What are you doing, Edwin?"

He paused to glance at Fred then at me, and then winked like some kind of performing magician, crumpled one of the paper halves, shoved it into his mouth and swallowed it.

I honestly didn't know how to react.

Fred let out a kind of disbelieving chuckle. I don't know if he was genuinely amused or just annoyed, but he leaned in toward Edwin with a smirk of his own.

"Lemme tell ya, kid, I've been at this job through damn near seven presidents, and I thought I'd seen all the goddamn shticks, but this right here is certainly something new..."

"You ain't seen nothing yet," Edwin snarked, holding up the second half of paper. "Boomer."

And then he licked it.

Fred and I both just gawked, caught completely off guard.

But it was that strange, kind of creepy behavior that suddenly made me realize how physically close to Edwin we were.

Edwin knew it too, I'd realized. Or more correctly - he had planned it.

I failed to notice his right hand discreetly dropped down to the La-Z-Boy's side lever.

The strangeness with the paper was too distracting.

It was a brilliant tactic.

I startled as the recliner CLACKED out and jerked Edwin forward.

Fred leaned back instinctively, but Edwin was faster.

He reached out with the paper strip and smacked it onto Fred's forehead.

I jumped to my feet, nearly tripping backwards over the sofa.

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

The scream just spontaneously came out of me. My voice was too high and panicked. I got triggered into an elevated stress response. In other words -- I was in shock.

It didn't really matter what Edwin was doing with the paper or if we had enough evidence (which we didn't) for his suspected involvement with the school shooting.

He just committed assault. And on a Federal agent, no less.

That was an arrestable offense. 

I realized then, ignited by the procedure drills they make you rehearse in the academy, that I should probably get my gun out.

Here's something popular that's true: Training matters. Practice MATTERS. You do something over and over and over again, when it comes time to do it for real, you'll have a helluva better chance to actually do the damn thing. 

When adrenaline kicks up and your sympathetic nervous system hijacks your prefrontal cortex, the only thing you can rely on is muscle memory.

Now here's something popular that's not true: FBI agents are firearms experts. We're not. Most police officers aren't firearms experts. Most soldiers even aren't firearms experts. Not unless you're in one of those hard-hitting, high-action units or task forces. We are pretty basically trained, in the exact meaning of the word. The basics.

So yes, I knew how to aim a pistol and generally speaking how to make bullets shoot out of it with relative accuracy. But I never had to pull my pistol on anyone for real before.

It just wasn't what FBI investigators generally do.

But I did know that my partner had the experience, so I got ready to backup Fred on the arrest, which I assumed was where this was going to go now.

Assumptions are a bad habit.

Fred didn't jump up. He didn't even stand. He just stayed seated, facing forward, eyes half lidded as though he was dead tired and just barely keeping himself upright and awake.

"FRED?"

The panic hadn't left my voice, neither did the fuzzing shock from my high stress response.

Fred gave no response. No reaction. That torn paper strip sticking to his forehead like a price tag on a doll.

Edwin moved to stand beside Fred, grinning with a malicious sense of smugness.

My hands were moving. Fumbling, but moving. Training procedures flooded back to me like a river of instinct crashing against my head.

I reached for the belt holster of my service pistol.

Small digit manipulation goes out the window during elevated stress responses. Back when our human ancestors were out there doing the Bear Grylls survival challenge for real, our sympathetic nervous system evolved to worry less about dialing 911 and more about punching, kicking, or hightailing our way out of any life or death problem. Of which there were many.

That's why, as I drew my service pistol, it came up with the holster still attached.

I was so hyped and nervous I didn't realize I hadn't unclasped it, just yanked it out in a forceful rush of panic.

You'd be surprised how often people do silly things like that in high stress scenarios. Even career veterans. But ESPECIALLY rookies.

Edwin laughed.

"First day on the job?"

It's funny how our brain works. Despite my high stress, my heart pounding, my trembling hands - for what felt like a minute (but was probably a split second) I remember feeling embarrassed.

Luckily, adrenaline focuses you on task like a motherfucker.

I tore off the holster and tossed it, squeezing my concentration in a mental vice to get my shaking finger to flick the safety off. 

"There we go," Edwin declared. "Can't have you distracted when I'm about to do my big supervillain moment, you know?"

My hands were shaking, stabbing the gun out awkwardly. 

The FBI firearms instructors teach the traditional Weaver Stance for pistol handling - arms outstretched, feet shoulder width apart, knees slightly bent. 

I was lucky they were pedantic about it, 'cause you really do fall to the level of your training, and that two-handed pistol grip was a buoy in an ocean of adrenaline and I was holding on for dear life.

Edwin frowned at Fred.

"Shouldn't you be standing?" He looked like he was trying to decide between two different flavors of Slushy. "Yeah, I think you should be standing for this."

He put his hand on Fred's shoulder.

"S-stop", I managed to croak out pathetically, having no idea what he'd done to my partner to make him utterly non-responsive or what he was planning to do now. 

"Rise."

Edwin seemed to exert some sort of control over Fred, who immediately stood up from the sofa with frightening obedience.

"Take out your pistol."

I had an involuntary flinch as soon as I heard the words.

The brain operates at such an elevated state of alertness when you're in fight or flight that I actually had an image flash in my mind's eye of Fred taking out the pistol and aiming it at me.

It wasn't some precognitive vision or anything fantastical like that. It was just my hyper-aware brain churning the wheels of prediction, trying to get ahead of whatever it could perceive as becoming an immediate problem.

Fred got his service pistol out with the casualness of taking a hand out of a pocket.

"Fred -- STOP!"

Even in his strange entranced state, he had no trouble with the draw. 

Did his years of firearms experience automate the movement? Did this... for lack of a better word... "spell" he was under harness the person's subconscious muscle memory to perform actions? Would I have still fumbled with my holster had I been the one who became, for lack of an even better word, possessed?

All these thoughts came later, of course. I was too tunnel-visioned to ponder any of this at the time.

Fred wasn't aiming his pistol at me yet, just let it droop beside him, apparently obeying the command quite literally.

"Man, I should've 'popped up on your radar' sooner." Edwin chuckled with blatant sarcasm. "You guys are too much fun."

His foot started to fidget, blue sneakers tapping impatiently the same exact way they did on the CCTV footage.

It was then I understood that it wasn't an impatient or nervous tick like I originally thought.  

It was a sort of subconscious joy signaling. Kind of how dogs wag their tail when their excited. 

Edwin's smug, satisfied elation at my growing despair was textbook power fantasy. Most serial killer profiles have this as a core tenet. 

I guess now I am diagnosing him.

"Edwin..." I forced as much confidence into my voice as I could muster, understanding I needed to take control of this insane situation NOW. "You, whatever, however you're doing this -- you need to stop."

Edwin dismissed me with a lazy wave.

"Now you people care about what I 'need'. Everyone is just so obsessed with building their picture perfect post-high school dreams, they don't care about who gets left behind because they got dealt a shit hand in life. Well I don't have any dreams to chase, so why should they get to live out theirs? Do they deserve it more? Because of some arbitrary chance that decides who gets to be rich or poor, or have parents that give a fuck a bout you so you can have a real part in the world?! It's not fair!"

His voice cracked with pain and frustration. A dripping sense of raw jealousy I've heard before. 

You can hear it too, if you listen to some old serial killer interviews. 

That buried aching of people unable to relate to a world that can only rejects them. Sometimes they're born into horrible circumstances. Other times... and you can count this as my professional opinion: something is just fucking wrong with them.

Regardless of the cause, the symptom is all too similar.

An old German philosopher once wrote that despair is what we call it when a person feels truly alone. 

Everybody wants someone to connect with. Someone to relate to. 

And when you don't have that, whether due to cruel situations or some maladapted inborn trait, you become angry at everything that doesn't share the same pain as you.

And in this warped form of existence, when you feel the world has done you wrong, the only way to make things right... is to exact your vengeance back onto the world.

"People want to think bad things will never happen to them," Edwin continued, panting a little from his expelling confession. "They want to believe life is bright and shiny like an CBS sitcom. Because that's what the world is to them, so as far as they know, they're right. Until the day they realize they've been wrong all along. And man... you should've seen the look on their scared little faces..."

He took a deep breath, reading himself for something.

"So no. Nobody gets to tell me to stop. Not anymore. Not my dad, not my teachers, and definitely not the fucking government."

He turned to Fred again, smiling contemptuously.

"Raise your pistol, secret agent man."

My partner's vacant expression twitched a little. Teeth gritted, eyes bulging, staring out into space. I'd seen that sort of look before in a video during a first aid class. 

Fred looked like a man trying to break out of a seizure. 

His body, meanwhile, complied without hesitation, lifting the arm extended outward like a string puppet, pistol hanging loosely from its marionette grip.

Instinctively I thought it was Fred trying to fight the order.

But it turned out Edwin just wasn't specific enough.

"No, goddammit," he snarled. "Aim it at her!"

Fred's body surged with a galvanized force, loose arm turning rigid, grip jerking up.

Now he really was aiming his pistol right at me.

"FRED!" 

All I could do was shout, holding my own pistol up in a swelling panic.

Fred was my partner. My mentor. My friend. 

I didn't want to aim it back at him. 

I didn't want to have to shoot him.

Then I suddenly realized -- I had zero reservations about the other person in the room.

Edwin pressed his mouth into a daring sneer as I shifted my stance to aim my pistol at him.

"Stop this, Edwin. I don't want to shoot you!"

But it had become clear to me then that shooting him is exactly what he wanted me to do.

Suicide by cop is a terrible mental state to arrive at. Unfortunately, it's all too common for people with similar psychological frameworks, once they feel like they've reached the end of their rope.

"Let's make it more interesting," he said, flashing a vicious smile and turning his attention to Fred.

"Shoot yourself in the face."

A pulse of panic rippled out from my chest.

No.

Tactical units like SWAT go through extensive CQB training, with a big emphasis on hostage situations.

Comparatively, the firearms & tactics lessons a low-risk junior agent like me goes through at Quantico's Basic Field Training course is what baby pool classes are to Navy Seal training.

But at under 10 feet, with ample distance between suspect and hostage, you could be a terrible marksman and still land a hell of a shot. 

The trick is to aim for the only spot in the human body that harbors a permanent off switch.

The head. 

Fred's hand moved glacially slow. Time dilation made my trigger finger feel like it was moving through molasses.

Unlike in TV shows and movies, people in high stress scenarios don't take long introspective beats to contemplate the sanctity of life and all that crap.

Our brains are not wired for that. That pesky sympathetic nervous system has only one prime directive - preserving the integrity of your (and your ingroup's) vulnerable meat vessel.

But that doesn't mean those sentimental reflections don't come flooding later. Sometimes it hits you right when the adrenaline wears off. Other times only after there's enough distance between you and the trauma to stop and actually look back.

I've had that distance now, and I've thought back about that day when I took that shot, not knowing what else I could do, not even sure if it'll stop what was happening.

The worst thing, so they say, is not making the wrong choice, but making no choice at all and letting something happen that you think you could have prevented.

You can't look back on things with the knowledge you gained after. Decisions are made in the moment, with the information available at the time. 

So do I regret doing it?

...

No. 

Even if it didn't save Fred. 

Even if a whole lot of madness unfolded afterwards.

I didn't know it at the time but that bullet wouldn't just kill Edwin. 

It would kill me too. The person I was before. 

Who I thought I was, up until that point.

Before the veil was lifted.

But choices are made in the moment, with the information available at the time. 

It's only when we look back later can we determine whether they were ultimately good or bad.

And when you're trapped in a bad situation, a bad choice is the only choice you got.

\*\*\*

I have to take a break now.

I'll try to upload more sometime later.
