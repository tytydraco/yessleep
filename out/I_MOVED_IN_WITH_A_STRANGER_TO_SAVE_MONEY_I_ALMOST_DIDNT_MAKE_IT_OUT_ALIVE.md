Before you start questioning, let me clarify that this story didn't happen to me. It happened to someone close to me, and she shared it so I could narrate it. So here it goes.

I had to move to a new city because of a job opportunity. The city was way more expensive than I expected, so I started looking for a place to rent as soon as possible. After weeks of searching and finding nothing affordable, I finally came across a listing that seemed perfect.

The house was big, located in a quiet neighborhood, and the rent was surprisingly cheap, almost too good to be true. The only catch was that I had to share the house with the owner, a man I’ll call M. He seemed friendly in our messages, so I decided to give it a shot.

When I first visited the place, everything seemed normal. M was a middle-aged man, a bit reserved, but nothing about him seemed off. The deal was simple. He would stay in the master bedroom upstairs, and I would take a smaller room on the ground floor.

He mentioned that he was out most of the time due to work and frequent travel, so I figured sharing the house with him wouldn't be a problem. The first few days were fine. M was hardly around, and I started thinking I had made a good choice.

But as time passed, I began noticing things that made me uncomfortable.

Every time I left my room, he was nearby. Even when I was in the kitchen, he would suddenly appear out of nowhere and start a conversation. At first, I thought he was just being friendly, but soon, it became clear that something felt off.

He started asking weird personal questions about my family, if I had a boyfriend, how I spent my free time. I brushed it off, thinking he was just trying to be social, but the way he asked, the tone he used, made me uneasy.

Then, the weird coincidences started. Every time I went to the bathroom, he was in the hallway. If I went to the kitchen, he was already sitting there, even if it was late at night.

One night, I was in my room watching a YouTube video on my phone when I heard slow footsteps outside. The sound was careful, like someone was trying to be quiet. When the steps reached my door, they stopped. I held my breath, waiting for whoever it was to walk away, but nothing happened.

They just stood there. Then, after a few moments, I heard the doorknob move. It was M.

He tried to open the door. Luckily, I had locked it. I asked what he wanted, trying to sound calm. He said he thought he heard a noise and wanted to check if I was okay.

Something about the way he spoke made my stomach drop. It didn’t make sense. If he was really concerned, why try to open the door like that?

The signs were there, but his age confused me. He was old enough to be my father, so my mind kept telling me I was overreacting. But I didn’t sleep that night.

The next day, I avoided him as much as possible.

That night, it happened again. I was in the kitchen, making something to eat, when he suddenly appeared. I tensed up but tried to act normal. He started talking about random things, the weather, the neighborhood, but then he shifted the conversation.

He started talking about how lonely he was, how he wanted someone to talk to.

That was enough for me. I made up an excuse and left. I locked myself in my room and tried to calm down. That was when I realized my suspicions weren’t crazy.

Then, later that night, it escalated. I was almost asleep when I heard footsteps again. This time, they were faster, more determined.

Before I could react, the doorknob started shaking violently. M was trying to force his way in.

My instincts kicked in. I screamed as loud as I could, yelling for help. M kept trying to open the door, banging on it harder. My panic took over, and I screamed even louder.

And then, I heard voices outside. Neighbors shouting. Loud knocks on the front door. M suddenly stopped. I heard him mutter something before his footsteps moved away from my door.

I stayed frozen in my room, still gripping the door handle. Moments later, I heard my neighbors yelling from outside, asking if I was okay.

That’s when I finally felt a wave of relief. I ran to the door and opened it. Some of my neighbors had already stepped inside, looking as concerned as I felt. They surrounded me, asking if I was hurt.

M was standing in the hallway, staring at all of us. His face was a mix of surprise and frustration. He tried to explain himself, saying it was all a misunderstanding, that he heard a noise and just wanted to check on me.

But I knew better. This wasn’t paranoia. This wasn’t an overreaction. I could see it in his eyes. He was just waiting for the right moment. I was lucky my screams were loud enough for the neighbors to hear.

As I tried to process what had happened, one of the neighbors, an older man who lived next door, called the police. Two other neighbors stood between me and M, making sure he couldn’t get any closer.

He kept trying to argue, saying he didn’t do anything wrong, but nobody was listening. A few minutes later, the police arrived. They asked me and the neighbors some questions and took M outside.

He tried to protest, but with so many witnesses, there wasn’t much he could do. The officers were kind and patient. They let me tell my side of the story, then advised me to leave as soon as possible. I agreed.

There was no way I was staying in that house, not after what had just happened. One of the neighbors, a woman who lived across the street, offered me a place to stay for the night. I accepted. I was too shaken to think straight.

I spent the rest of the night on her couch, unable to close my eyes.

The next day, I packed my things as fast as I could and left. I called my parents, who freaked out and begged me to come home. I was so drained, so emotionally exhausted, that I agreed without hesitation.

As for the job opportunity, that was over.
