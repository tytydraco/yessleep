For a quick backstory I live in a town deep in the woods far from any major cities with my parents, last week they came back from a vacation in the woods.
So after they came back I noticed my dad was acting really weird as an example: forgetting things about his personal life,forgetting his birthday and acting out of character.

At the first night after they came back me and my dad woke up and couldn't find mom anywhere which was weird because she didn't say anything about leaving the day before she ended up getting back to the house at the evening and after we asked where she was she didn't give us any answers.

After this repeating it self for a couple times my dad came with the idea of installing security cameras to see when and where she went every night,after waking up the next day and not finding her home we decided to check the camera footage what we saw was her getting out of bed at around 3 am getting downstairs leaving the house and heading to the deep woods we were really confused why would she go to the woods so late at night without telling anybody we decided to check what she will do other days but she just kept doing the same things it was a routine for her at this point.

After a while my dad and i came up with the idea of following her when she leaves.
The next night me and my dad were ready to follow her, she woke up got downstairs while we watched her from our beds and when she left the house we did too we were 20 feet behind her so she won't notice us she took so much different routs that we lost her so we decided to just go home and do more investigating tommorow.

The next morning we woke up and like regular she wasn't there yet so we took the chance and reported to the police about her they said they will investigate in it but they couldn't really do much.

It was evening and mom came back we started asking her again where was she but she was just saying she were doing private stuff my dad got mad and told her that she couldn't come back home anymore until she tells us what's going on
She got mad and went to the bedroom My dad just decided to go to sleep so I did too.


The next morning my dad came up with the idea to not look for her at night but to look in the morning so we could have better eyesight and check where she could've gone too I agreed it was a good idea and we went searching for her.

I offered to split so we can find her faster my dad agreed and we told each other to call the other one if we found something.

After an hour of searching I found a weird small house in the middle of the woods I decided to not call my dad vecause I wanted to investigate myself I approached the house and opened the door there was my mom looking happy to see me she said "oh finally I can talk to you" I asked her what she was talking about and she said
"Your dad died from a heart attack on the vacation I dont know who came back home".
