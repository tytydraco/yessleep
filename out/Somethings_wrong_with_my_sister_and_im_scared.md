 

Liz is my little sister, just by two years. We know each other better than we know ourselves, every secret we’ve ever had, the other knows. We’re so glued at the hip to where it’s seen as a problem to other people. We even have that sorta of twin telepathy despite our couple year difference. All I’m trying to say is that I know my sister and that's why I’m scared. 

Liz is a pretty quiet person, definitely an introvert and doesn’t tend to talk to other people unless she is spoken to first. She still has that teen angst despite being in her 20s. Even when she's in conversation she doesn’t make an effort to keep it going.

The first small alarm went off a couple days ago when Liz and I went out to lunch together. Every single person we walked by,

“Hi! Hello!” she would jump and say with a wide toothy grin. So wide it seemed to make people uncomfortable. 

“Looks like someone woke up on the right side of the bed.” I joked to her.

As soon as those words slipped from my mouth she stopped dead in her tracks and stared at me with the blankest expression. 

“What's with you?” I asked nudging her and then she quickly turned around and kept walking with that big grin. 

When we got to the restaurant she went back to her reserved self and stayed like that the rest of the day. I honestly thought she was just messing with me so I brushed it off and continued on with the day.

The next morning (yesterday) started off fine, Liz greeted me with a cup of coffee like normal and we both worked on our laptops for a while in silence. Almost two hours passed and I finally got up to take a break and noticed Liz staring at me from across the room. I was so lost in my work I didn’t notice until I got up. Her eyes were so wide and so bloodshot like she hadn't blinked in at least 30 minutes.

“What the fuck Liz don’t do that.” I snapped at her

She didn’t move for a few more seconds and then burst out hysterically laughing. She was laughing so hard she started crying and wouldn’t stop. It honestly freaked me out so I didn’t say anything and went into my room. Five minutes later I could still hear her muffled laughter and then it went dead silent. I debated whether or not to go out and check on her but I decided against it and went back to working. 

Another hour passed and I went back into the living room. Liz wasn't there but her laptop was wide open. I called her name and nothing. I checked around our small apartment and she was nowhere in sight. I called her a couple times and it went straight to voicemail. 

**Im at the store**

My phone lit up with a text. I didn’t reply because I was still bothered by the situation from earlier. Liz came home not long after and again was acting like her regular self. 

“What was that all about earlier?” I questioned her.

“What was what about?” she looked genuinely confused.

“How long were you staring at me and why?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about Lucy.” she said, dismissing me and went straight to her room with her shopping bags.

Hours passed with no communication until dinner time. Liz came out of her room bouncing around in a bright yellow apron. 

“I'm going to make us dinner tonight!” she sang while twirling around. 

That was not my sister. Something looked so off from her besides the fact that she hates yellow and cooking, and is not the type of person to dance around and sing. In her 24 years of life, she has never acted like that, not even as a little kid. 

I couldn't pinpoint it but there was something so different about her face. Her eyes were almost hollow and expressionless yet she was smiling so big. It seemed like she wasn’t really there. She was just talking out loud and not really to me. She didn’t even look at me once. 

I didn’t say anything and turned on the tv loud enough to drown out her humming. I kept my eye on her as she danced around the kitchen cooking.

“Almost ready!” she swung around and stared right at me with the biggest, most painful smile. 

I didn’t say anything and just looked at her. Her eyes were even more hollow than they were 30 minutes before. She was dripping in sweat and holding out a plate for me.

“What is it?” I nervously asked. She looked so different, almost like another person.

“Come and find out silly!” she didn’t move, she just stood frozen in place.

I hesitated before I slowly got up and made my way over. She didn’t take her eyes off of me once, they were burning into me. I looked down at the plate and back up at her. 

“What is that Liz?” My eyes started to well up and I felt my mouth fill with saliva.

“You’re dinner Lucy! Please, oh please eat it, I made it for you!” Her eyes were wide and staring into me. 

She motioned the plate full of dead mushed up bugs towards me and I almost puked. 

“I’m not eating that Liz.” I pushed the plate back.

Her smile completely dropped and she turned around in silence with her head down. Her fist pounded the table over and over again. 

At this point I was far beyond disturbed. I locked myself away in my bedroom the rest of the night. I blared my tv to drown out the banging. 

Now comes to the reason I decided to write this post. Around 4 am this morning I woke up in a panic. I woke up to Liz standing over my bed. I’m not sure how she got in because I locked my door, but she was standing over me with that empty stare, wide grin and in the light of my tv, I could see a butcher knife in her hand. 

I stared at her, I felt tears fall onto my cheek. She was frozen in place. I started to move and slid out of the other side of my bed. She still stayed staring at the spot I was just laying. I quietly made my way around her and grabbed my keys and ran to my car.

I drove for a while, it’s been a few hours and I don’t know what to do. Our parents passed away a few years ago and we don’t have any other family where we live. I don’t know if I should contact the police, I mean she's my sister. Someone please help. I don't want to go back home.
