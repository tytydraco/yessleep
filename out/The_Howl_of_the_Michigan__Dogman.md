I’ve always been a skeptic. Ghost stories, cryptids, UFOs—I’d roll my eyes at them all. That was until the summer of 2023 when I encountered something I can’t explain. It was something straight out of a nightmare, and I’ve never felt the same since. Let me start from the beginning.

My name is Ryan, and I live in northern Michigan. I grew up in a small town near the Manistee National Forest. As a kid, my friends and I would spend countless hours exploring the woods, fishing in the lakes, and telling each other ghost stories around the campfire. One story that always came up was the legend of the Michigan Dogman.

For those unfamiliar, the Michigan Dogman is a cryptid said to resemble a large, bipedal wolf. Sightings have been reported since the late 1800s, with people claiming to have seen a creature that stands over seven feet tall, covered in dark fur, and with piercing yellow eyes. Most locals dismissed the stories as nothing more than folklore—just another tale to scare the tourists. And that’s what I thought too.

Until last summer.

### **The Camping Trip**

It started with a camping trip. My girlfriend, Emily, and I decided to spend a weekend in the wilderness, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. We packed our gear and drove out to a secluded spot deep in the Manistee National Forest. It was a place I had been to many times before, far from any other campers. It was peaceful, tranquil—exactly what we needed.

The first day went by without a hitch. We set up camp, went for a hike, and cooked dinner over the fire. As the sun began to set, the temperature dropped, and the forest came alive with the sounds of nocturnal creatures. Crickets chirped, owls hooted, and the occasional rustle of leaves indicated a passing animal. Nothing out of the ordinary.

But as the night deepened, a strange feeling began to settle over me. It was subtle at first, just an odd sense of being watched. I brushed it off as my imagination. We were in the middle of the woods, after all. Of course, it was going to feel a little eerie. I didn’t mention it to Emily—I didn’t want to freak her out.

Around midnight, we decided to turn in. We crawled into our tent and zipped ourselves inside our sleeping bags. The fire outside had dwindled to glowing embers, casting faint shadows on the walls of the tent. Emily drifted off quickly, her breathing soft and steady. I, however, couldn’t sleep. That feeling of being watched had only intensified. Every snap of a twig or rustle of leaves made my heart race.

Then, I heard it.

A howl, unlike anything I’d ever heard before. It wasn’t a wolf, nor was it a coyote. It was deeper, more resonant—like a primal scream from something ancient and powerful. The sound echoed through the trees, sending a shiver down my spine. I sat up, straining to hear, and that’s when Emily woke up.

“What was that?” she whispered, her voice trembling.

“I don’t know,” I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. “Probably just a wolf or something.”

But we both knew it wasn’t a wolf.

The howl came again, closer this time. I could feel the vibration of it in my chest. Emily grabbed my arm, her fingers digging into my skin. “Ryan, what if it’s…?”

She didn’t need to finish her sentence. I knew exactly what she was thinking.

The Michigan Dogman.

I tried to calm her down, telling her it was just our imaginations getting the better of us. But deep down, I was terrified. We listened in silence for what felt like an eternity, but the howling stopped. The forest was eerily quiet now, too quiet. Not even the crickets dared to make a sound.

Suddenly, there was a rustling just outside the tent. My heart nearly stopped. Something was moving around out there—something big. The footsteps were heavy, crunching through the underbrush with deliberate, measured steps. Emily’s grip on my arm tightened, and I could hear her trying to stifle a sob.

I slowly reached for the flashlight next to my sleeping bag. My hands were shaking as I clicked it on. The beam of light cut through the darkness, illuminating the thin fabric of the tent. I couldn’t see anything outside, but the footsteps continued, circling the tent.

Then, it stopped.

Whatever it was, it was right outside our tent, barely a foot away. I could hear its breathing—low, guttural, and unnatural. The fabric of the tent suddenly bulged inward, as if something was pressing against it. Emily let out a small scream, and I shone the flashlight directly at the spot.

What I saw still haunts me to this day.

Through the thin material of the tent, I could make out the silhouette of a massive creature. It was hunched over, its broad shoulders and elongated limbs casting distorted shadows. But the most terrifying part was its head. It was unmistakably canine, with pointed ears and a long snout. And those eyes—those glowing, yellow eyes—stared right at us.

I don’t know how long we sat there, paralyzed with fear. It felt like hours, though it was probably only minutes. The creature continued to press against the tent, its claws lightly scratching the fabric, as if testing it. Then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, it backed away.

We heard it retreating into the woods, its footsteps fading into the distance. For a long time, neither of us moved or spoke. When we finally mustered the courage to step outside, the first light of dawn was beginning to creep through the trees. The forest was still and quiet, as if nothing had happened.

But something *had* happened.

All around our campsite, the ground was disturbed. Deep, clawed footprints marked the earth, leading from the edge of the clearing to our tent and back into the woods. They were unlike any animal tracks I’d ever seen—too large to be a wolf or a bear.

Emily and I packed up our things in record time and left the forest without looking back. We didn’t speak much on the drive home, and we haven’t gone camping since.

I’ve tried to rationalize what we saw that night, but I can’t. There’s no logical explanation. The Michigan Dogman—it’s real. I don’t care if you believe me or not. I know what I saw.

But it didn’t stop there.

### **The Nightmares**

The nightmares started about a week after we got back. I’d find myself back in the forest, wandering through the trees in the dead of night. Everything would be eerily quiet—too quiet. Then, I’d hear it—the howl. It would echo through the trees, sending chills down my spine. I’d start to run, trying to find my way back to camp, but no matter how fast I moved, the howl would always be closer.

In the dreams, I never see the creature. But I can feel it. It’s always just out of sight, stalking me through the woods, watching me. I’d wake up drenched in sweat, heart pounding, convinced that it was still out there, waiting for me. Emily had her own share of nightmares, too. Though she didn’t like to talk about them, I could tell they were affecting her as much as mine were affecting me.

The worst part was that the feeling of being watched didn’t stop when I woke up. Even in the safety of my own home, I couldn’t shake the sensation that something was following me. I’d catch glimpses of movement out of the corner of my eye, only for it to vanish when I turned my head. I started avoiding the windows at night, afraid of what I might see if I looked outside.

Emily and I began to argue more frequently. The stress of what happened—and the lingering fear—was getting to both of us. We stopped going out as much, and our social lives dwindled. Friends started asking what was wrong, but I couldn’t bring myself to tell them the truth. How do you explain that you’re being haunted by a creature that most people don’t even believe exists?

Then things escalated.

### **The Scratches**

It was a Thursday night, about a month after the camping trip. Emily and I were watching TV in the living room, trying to take our minds off things. It was one of those nights where the air felt thick with tension, like a storm was brewing. I could tell Emily was still on edge, even though she was trying to pretend everything was normal.

Suddenly, we heard a noise coming from the back of the house. It was a scratching sound, faint at first, but unmistakable. We both froze, staring at each other in silence. The sound continued, growing louder and more insistent, like claws raking against wood.

I grabbed a baseball bat that I kept by the door and slowly made my way toward the back of the house. Emily followed close behind, clutching her phone with trembling hands. The scratching was coming from the back door—the one that led to our yard.

I hesitated, my hand hovering over the doorknob. Part of me didn’t want to open the door, didn’t want to see what was out there. But I knew I couldn’t ignore it. Taking a deep breath, I flung the door open, raising the bat in preparation for whatever was on the other side.

But there was nothing. The yard was empty, the night air still and quiet. I stepped outside, looking around, but saw no sign of anything unusual. That’s when I saw it standing about 20 feet out in the brush of our yard a tall figure with those piercing yellow eyes, I stared for a few seconds, and then stared back I freaked out and immediately went back and made sure everything was locked and stayed up. Until Dawn in the living room. This may be my last post from now on. We’re gonna try to focus on other things besides posting on Reddit.
