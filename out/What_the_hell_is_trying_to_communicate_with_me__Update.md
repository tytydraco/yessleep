I'm currently 51 miles away from my home. I have nowhere else to be so I'm on a drive to be as far away from home as possible. One night has gone by, so the things living in my kitchen probably know I don't want to be around anymore. I can't understand what they are or what the void they bring with them is, but I need to be as far from them as possible.


To avoid another sleepless night in my car, I booked a hotel room for at least a little bit of comfort. The first night there went by without issue. I settled in, slept a bit longer, the service was smooth… the second night, there were two people speaking to each other in the room next to mine. At first, I wasn't paying attention. Two people just having a conversation? None of my business. But then I started hearing my first and last name being used. Not together, so I told myself I was just being paranoid. Then one of them said my full street address. I put my ear up to the wall and listened.


As I focused on their voices, I couldn't make out what they were saying. It took a few seconds for me to realize they were speaking as if they were fusing words together with each word, with the only coherent thing being my name and street. I didn't recognize their voices, and everyone I knew was far from the hotel. I even texted each of them to make sure they hadn't told anyone my full street address. I contacted customer service to tell them two people with voices I couldn't recognize had the street address to my home and knew my name. The service man told me he'd check and give me an update, so I waited.


Eventually, I heard footsteps. Then a knock. The voices stopped. The door creaked open, then… more silence. I waited and waited, but there was nothing. I opened the door to peer out into the hallway, but I was met with the dark void. I could really take note of how cold it felt against my skin. My heart dropped far, then I slammed the door shut.


I called the police, reporting threats of violence. I watched as a cop car pulled into the parking lot, as the officer stepped out, then I waited… no footsteps, no voices. everything was dead silent. I looked through the peephole to find the void was still there.


A notification popped up. The sender was my social security number. The email itself included specifics, reading, “your social security number,” “your phone password,” “your Google account password.”


I got a knock. Finally. I sped to the door, then looked through the peephole. It was a service member. The hallway was its usual appearance too! I opened the door, expecting something to be said about the weirdness of the past night. However, he told me he hoped I enjoyed my stay. He walked away, not saying another word. I called out to him.


“Do you know what happened last night?”


No answer.


“They know my address and want to do shit to me.”


Still no answer.


I shut the door, then stared at the peephole. Fuck this. In my downward spiral, I noticed a note lying on the floor right in between the door and I. I picked it up. This is what it read:


“Meet me at the church up the road in one hour.”


It was better than staying in this room with who knows what next door. When the time came close, I headed out. I had noticed the church on my way here, so I could already picture it. I wasn't very religious, but whatever. I needed to meet somebody.


Inside, I noticed the service worker on the third row away from me. He had a straight face, and gave me a little wave. I went up to him and couldn't hold it in anymore. “What the hell is going on? Why is all this happening? Why are we even meeting here?”


“This place is comforting to me.”


“Well, I need to be comfortable at all.”


“Those beings haunting you… talk about them. How do they make you feel?”


“They're invasive and terrifying. What do you know about them?”


“They're us… but a different version of us.”


I guess that made sense. They don't seem human, but they know English. I'm still kinda confused, so I pressed the man further.


“Where did they even come from? What do they even want?”


“They want to extort. I don't know how much I can tell you beyond that.”


“Has anybody gotten out of it?”


“People have avoided being pulled in, but out? Not that I know of. There was one individual who would've been pulled in had it not been for them panicking and shouting in public. It helped that people were recording. I don't know what the agent expected, hounding somebody in public, but they were probably exiled for it. Unfortunately, no footage of them got out.”


That sounded familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it. What I could recall was my attempt to record them. I told the man such and showed him the videos I took. He told me they'd be no use, so I asked him what would.


“It's not about video footage. There's nothing that can be done, other than talking to them. If you're lucky, you can get through to them.”


Before I could answer, my surroundings went dark… my body froze over. My heart dropped as I realized what was happening. I fell for what felt like a minute, barely being able to breath, then my fall slowed somehow. I was landed on the ground with a light thud. The dread, chills, and frozen air were too much pressure. On top of that, I wasn't able to see a single thing. Then, a baritone voice came along to make it all worse.


“Meet me at the lighthouse so we can trade info.”


“W-why does it have to involve me?”


“My place needs more workers. A deal was set on January 5, 1924 for us to return to an individual on your bloodline in 2024. Work for us and the ones you love will be safe.”


What even was this? These terrifying versions of us were running some sort of business? How'd my great great whatever grandparents make a deal that made them fuck off for a hundred years? Because I sure as hell wanted one of those. The dread was too strong.


“I want to make a deal like that.”


“Our services have been requested so much more than usual since the 2000s. This opportunity will not go to waste.”


I could only assume I wasn't going to shake these things. They weren't going into detail either, and it's not like I was interested in the details. That was on top of the fact my nerves were aching. Instead of hopelessly arguing with them, I gave in.


“Please just visit me in a month or something then.”


“Alright. If you avoid us again, your bloodline will be erased.”


“I get it. Now, please, let me out!”


The void disappeared. Instead of being in the church, I was left in an empty room with white-painted walls and a carpeted floor. The door was opened by a man who looked to be from customer service. He told me to follow him, so I did. I asked him who he was, where I was, and what was happening, but I got no answer. He walked me through the lobby, then held the door for me. I thanked him, then stepped out into a welcoming wall of heat. It had to be 35 degrees at that moment. I looked around. The street was lined with parked cars and beyond those cars were four storey buildings. Where was I? I turned my head back for the name of the building I just stumbled out of. The Mark. I had no idea where that was and, from where I was standing, I couldn't spot any landmarks. I hadn't heard of The Mark before, but from the looks of it, it had to be some fancy hotel. There was no point in trying to make sense of this, so I checked my phone for my location, then went on my way back home.


I slept well that night. Nothing happened whatsoever. Everything was calm and quiet, allowing me to have a deep sweet sleep. Being 22 was chill again! Of course, the reality set back in this morning, when I found a note taped to my front door.


“I hope you slept well. We will return to discuss specifics on June 20.”
