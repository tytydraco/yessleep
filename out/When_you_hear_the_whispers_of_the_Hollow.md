We had made the annual trek to the Appalachian Mountains every year since we could remember, but this late fall trip felt eerily different. The leaves had turned a curtain of vibrant red and gold, but the chill in the air hinted at something darker lurking beneath the picturesque surface. I could feel it, a tension woven into the very fabric of our adventure. 

“Come on, Abigail, lighten up! It’s just a weekend away,” Lucy laughed, her breath visible in the crisp air. Her voice was bright against the deafening silence that surrounded us. The four of us—Lucy, Mike, Jamie, and me—had just settled at our campsite near Craggy Hollow. Shadows thickened among the trees as the sun dipped low, leaving us to fight the encroaching darkness with our campfire.

“Yeah, don’t ruin the fun.” Mike rolled his eyes, tossing a twig into the flames. “Besides, what’s the worst that could happen? Boo! Some ghost comes to snag us?” He chuckled, but I could hear the slight tremor in his voice.

“Very funny,” I shot back, though a nervous laugh escaped me. I recounted a ghost story I had heard about the Tsalagi, a spirit said to lure unwary adventurers deeper into the woods. As I spoke, the air turned still, and an uncomfortable quiet settled among us. 

Then, a distant wail shattered the fragile calm, rattling through the trees. “What was that?” I asked, my heart pounding as I stared into the inky blackness beyond the firelight. Was it a coyote, or something worse? 

“Probably just an animal,” Jamie said, though he didn’t sound convinced. “Let’s stick to the fire; it’s just the wind playing tricks on us.” 

We tried to dismiss the noise, but as night deepened, unease crept in like a fog. “I’ll check on the tents,” Lucy finally said, her voice barely above a whisper, as she slipped into the shadows. “I’ll be back in a sec!” But as minutes stretched into an agonizing eternity, the chill escalated with each passing heartbeat. 

“Lucy!” I called out, my voice taut with anxiety. “You okay?”

A sudden rustle from the direction she had gone made me jump. “Lucy?” Mike’s tone was apprehensive now. “This isn’t funny.”

When she didn’t respond, a knot of dread twisted in my stomach. “We have to find her,” I urged, desperation pouring through every syllable. 

“Let’s not panic,” Jamie suggested, but his own voice trembled. Together, we ventured into the dark, our flashlights casting trembling beams that felt utterly insufficient against the oppressive forest.

After what felt like an eternity of calling her name, we stumbled into a clearing, where Lucy’s backpack lay abandoned, its fabric catching the faint light like a warning. “Lucy?!” My heart raced as I crouched down, hoping against hope she’d jump out with a laugh. 

But everything changed when we found her—her body sprawled at the edge of a bramble as if she had just sat down to rest, her eyes wide, frozen in time. The horror clutched at my throat. “Oh God, no!” I gasped, rushing forward. A cold array of crimson stained the ground, glistening in the moonlight.

“Lucy! No!” Mike's voice cracked as he dropped to his knees, tears welling in his eyes. “What happened? She was just here—” 

“I don’t know!” I choked out, fighting the urge to vomit. “We have to go back! We can’t stay here!” 

But as we scrambled to retreat, Jamie stumbled backward, gasping as he lost his balance, tumbling into the thicket. “Help! Abigail!” His voice echoed as he fell against a jagged stone, a sickening snap reverberating through the air.

“Jamie!” I screamed and rushed to him, my heart hammering in my chest. I found him on the ground, blood pooling where he hit, his breathing erratic. “Stay with me!” I begged, but as I looked into his panicked eyes, all I could see was the life draining from him.

“Don’t leave me!” he whimpered, his voice barely a whisper as he went limp, the warmth fading from his small hand. I clutched it tighter, but it was too late. My leg slipped fast into a frenzy, and panic gripped my heart as I staggered back, losing my breath in a sob.

“Where’s Mike?” The words left my mouth like a lifeline I desperately sought. “Mike!” 

Sudden silence weighed upon us, thickening the air. We turned in terror, and that’s when Mike disappeared—one moment he was there, and the next, he was gone, swallowed by shadows. 

I gasped as a chill slithered down my spine. Panic rocketed my heart rate as I backed away, the forest around me distorting into a nightmarish blur. The suffocating fog of despair enveloped me, and I felt like an animal caught in a trap.

“Mike!” I screamed, but my voice was lost in the wind. “Where are you?”

The twisted trees loomed ever closer, shadows shifting as if they had purpose, and I pressed on, desperate to escape the haunted remnants of my friends. I stumbled deeper into the woods, tripping over roots and rocks, hopelessly lost. My mind spiraled, the cries of Jamie and Lucy replaying in my head, and each sound resonated with their loss.

Then, I made it to a small clearing, and for a moment, the moon hung high above, illuminating the scene like an eerie stage. But the shadows still danced at the edges, watching, waiting. I could hear them, their whispers flowing through the branches like water through a sieve. “Abigail...” they beckoned, my friends’ voices twisted in sorrow. “Join us.” 

“Get away from me!” I screamed, covered in goosebumps as the figures began to emerge, distorted, their faces unrecognizable yet familiar. Lucy’s laughter echoed mockingly from somewhere behind. Jamie’s whisper surged with shadowy tendrils. “Help us, Abigail…” 

I shook my head violently, stumbling back. “No! You’re not real!” I cried, backing away from the chilling scene. I turned to run, not caring where the path led me; I only knew I had to escape the consuming darkness.

As I fled, I could feel the forest closing in, the wind howling in dissent around me. I pushed past branches, willing my legs to move faster, until finally, I burst onto the dirt road beyond the trees where the shadows could no longer follow.

Collapsing against a gnarled tree, gasping for breath, I finally let the tears flow, reliving the horror of that night over and over. I was alone. In that moment, I wanted to scream my friends’ names, to reclaim their existence: Lucy, Jamie, Mike! But there was only silence, the weight of their absence pressing heavily against my chest.

In the distance, I heard the rumble of a car engine, and with every ounce of strength, I pushed myself upright, running toward the sound, the hope of salvation pulling me. I made it, tears streaking down my face, desperate and broken. I was a survivor, the last thread of our once close-knit group—all that remained from a life filled with laughter now haunted by shadows that whispered their dark secrets in the corners of my mind.

But I knew, deep down, the mountains would forever hold a piece of my heart, one buried deep within the echo of every gust of wind that brushed through the trees—the haunting reminder of what I had lost to the suffocating darkness of late fall in the Appalachian Mountains.
