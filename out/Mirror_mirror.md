I had been driving for hours, and it felt like days. I needed to pull off and get a couple hours of rest.

When I saw the flashing vacancy sign off the freeway, I took it as a sign.

$50 for the night, no fuss, but the clerk told me one thing.

She was pushing 90 years old, gray hair that was so frizzy it looked like she had been shocked recently, and glasses that were held together with scotch tape.

She leaned across the desk when she handed me the silver key.

“Mirrors stay covered, don’t take the sheets off.”, she huffed at me, traces of her cigarette smoke lingered behind her.

“So, no mirrors?”, I asked, “What if I need-“

“Don’t matter what you need, missy.”, she snapped, “Mirrors stay covered, you’ll be thankin’ me later.”

She pulled her magazine forward and began to flip through it.

“Room 3, to the left, sleep tight.”, she called after me.

Which brings me here, to this room.

At first glance, it’s your general slightly sketchy motel room.

Burgundy bedspread, orange and brown patterned wallpaper with equally atrocious brown carpeting. Wooden dresser and a tv that supersedes my age.

Whatever, it was $50.

I toss my bag on the bed and walk to the bathroom to get ready to sleep.

Sure enough, white sheets had been draped over the vanity mirror.

Behind the door, a full-length mirror was nailed to the door with a similar sheet draped over it.

I stared at the sheets, surely there is a reason why they are covered. Maybe the mirrors are broken, and the place is too cheap to fix it.

Better leave it alone.

After I used the bathroom and brushed my teeth, I changed clothes and settled into bed.

It was the first time I had been alone since my brother’s funeral that afternoon, so I finally let myself cry. All the feelings of the day flooded through me, and I openly wept into the cheap pillow.

At some point, I dozed off. I don’t remember even getting comfortable in the stiff bed, let alone falling asleep. But I had this eerie feeling of being watched.

I dreamt I was in my hotel room, watching myself sleep. It felt like I was looking through someone else’s viewpoint, because they moved closer to me.

Closer and closer, while I blissfully slept.

My viewpoint then reached towards my sleeping form, and right before contact was made, I woke up.

I sat straight up, breathing heavily and looking around in the dark. Fumbling for the light switch on my nightstand.

When the lamp flared to life, the room remained empty.

I sighed. What a nightmare.

I rubbed my hands over my eyes and down my face.

When I looked down at my hands, they were caked in something dark.

“What the..”, I whispered, and brought my hands closer to the lamp.

Dark red coated my hands, and I could smell the familiar metallic smell.

Blood.

“Oh shit!”, I yelped, getting up out of bed.

I got nosebleeds all the time as a kid, I really hoped the habit wasn’t coming back.

Though the lamp was on, the glow was faint. In the dimness, I use my phone flashlight and stumble into the bathroom and turn the light on.

The covered mirror was waiting me.

“Okay well, I’ll put the sheet back once I clean my face”, I say, and in one move I remove the sheet.

I hold my breath, hoping there isn’t a mess of shattered glass waiting me.

And thankfully it’s just a mirror, still intact, a bit dusty, but just a mirror.

However, my face is quite the sight.

Sure enough, blood is coming from my nose and the sticky substance is caking my chin.

I take a washcloth and run it under the warm water, then bring it to my face to dab away the mess.

I stare into my reflection as I clean my face, and I think, wow I look rough.

Dark circles hang under my eyes, my skin looks dull, my hair’s frizziness is in competition for the hotel clerk’s.

It’s been a long day.

As my face becomes clearer, I see my reflection start to change.

My skin becomes brighter, my dark circles slowly fade, and my hair looks shinier, bouncy even.

I continue to dab at my face with a confused expression.

I must be so tired I’m hallucinating.

I finish cleaning my face and rinse the hand towel, when I look back up at the mirror, my reflection smiles at me.

Am I smiling?

I touch my mouth, and my reflection follows.

I turn my head left and right, trying to track the motion in the mirror, that’s when I notice there is a half second delay against myself and my reflection.

“What the hell is this?”, I say out loud.

The reflection doesn’t match my movements.

My heart begins to race, and I’m thinking I need to just go back to sleep when the my reflection speaks to me.

“You really do look rough.”, it says to me.

My jaw drops, while my reflection tilts her head at me as if she’s studying me.

“Did you just.. How did you know I thought…”, I ask, trying to look behind the mirror for any screen.

“Well of course I know what you thought,” my reflection laughs coldly, “I’m you.”

“No.. No you’re not.. Okay, I’m going back to sleep..”, I whisper.

I grab the sheet and begin to place it back over the mirror.

“Wait.”

I pause.

I wait.

“How was the funeral?”, it asks.

How does it know I was… Am I going crazy with my grief? Does that happen?

I say nothing.

“Pretty brave of you to show up.. Considering the circumstances..”, it coos.

I’m still holding the sheet, half covering the mirror.

“But were you brave enough to tell Mommy and Daddy that it was your fault their favorite child died?”

I rip the sheet off.

“That’s not true!”, I yell.

My reflection smiles at me.

“Oh, I think it is. You know it too. Wasn’t he driving to pick you up because you and your boyfriend got into another fight? Wasn’t he on his way to you when the drunk driver hit him?”, she asked, steadily watching my reaction.

“He.. He wanted to come..”, I whispered to the sink.

“Did he? He wanted to be pulled out of bed to deal with his sister’s drama, again? Did you really have no other options?”, it demanded.

“If I had known..”, I stammered, “If I knew he was going to.. Then I wouldn’t hav-“

“Well it’s too late now, isn’t it?”, it interrupted.

It laughed at me.

I felt my hands start to shake.

This was a nightmare, a horrible nightmare I will dissect in therapy this week, but a nightmare.

“Goodbye”, I say firmly, I place the sheet over the mirror and straighten it out.

I rub my eyes, wash my hands, and open the bathroom door.

“Did I say you could leave?”, it says.

I slowly turn back to the covered mirror.

My heart is racing, my arms are shaking, and I can hear my breaths coming out in quivering bursts.

I reach up to the sheet, and tear it down.

My reflection stares back at me.

But this time it’s the frizzy hair, dull skin, and dark under-eyes.

I let out a shaking breath.

“Just a nightmare..”, I laugh to myself.

I turn to the bathroom door and notice the sheet covering the full-length mirror is no longer covering it, in my shaking terror I must have knocked it to the ground.

I bend over to pick up the sheet and when I turn back to the mirror, I gasp.

My terrorizing reflection is back, smiling at me.

When I open my mouth to scream, its hand reaches through the mirror and wraps around my throat.

I drop the sheet and begin to try and detach its hand, but its grip is too strong.

I can feel the air leaving my body.

It sees my struggle, and laughs coldly.

“You stupid, stupid girl. You shouldn’t have talked back to me.”

Just then, my familiar appearance begins to laugh again. Closing its eyes, and throwing its head back. When it looks at me again, its eyes are red.

I have never felt terror like this.

“Your mind is a dark place, girl. I can’t wait to tear you apart from the inside out.”, its now deep voice tells me.

“You folded too easily.. not only are you gullible you’re also WEAK.”, it cackles.

Its grip on my neck tightens with each second.

“Lucky for you, I need a new host, so I’ll make this quick.”

The creature starts to pull me towards the mirror.

“No.. No!”, I try to shout.

“No? NO? You’re out of options, girl.”, it continues to laugh.

I still have my phone in my pocket for the flashlight, and I fumble to get it out of my pajamas.

Once I get the grip on my phone, I throw it with full force at the mirror.

I watch my reflection’s expression shatter into a million pieces while it screeches.

Its grip releases on my throat as its hand retreats back into the shards of mirror.

I collapse on the glass, panting and sobbing. I can feel the broken pieces slicing into my hands, but I can’t move.

My head is pounding, and I feel my nose has started to bleed again.

Just then, I realize the pounding isn’t in my head.

It’s my room door.

I scurry out to the room and peer out the peephole.

The hotel clerk is standing there, hands on hips and tapping her foot.

I open the door slightly.

“Yes?”, I ask.

She pushes past me and marches straight to the bathroom, she pushes the door open and sees all the broken glass covering the floor.

“You idiot! I told you not to uncover those damn mirrors!”, she scolds.

“I’m.. I’m sorry..”, I stammer as I begin to sob again.

“What did it say to you, missy?”, she demands.

“It.. It knew about my brother.. It wanted a host..”, I whisper.

She hands me my bag, and looks me right in the eye.

“You need to run missy, you need to go, the gate is still open and it will find you. You have to go, now!”, she yells, shooing me out the door.

“But what about you? Are you safe?”, I ask.

“Oh I’ll be fine. It ain’t scared of me, it’s scared of you now. That makes it angry.”, she tells me.

“What do you mean?”

She laughs, coldly.

“It used your worst fear against you, and you fought back. Didn’t you?”, she asks me.

I nod.

“The only thing evil hates more than good, is someone who fights back. You have to go.”

I nod and stumble into my car, flip it in drive, and peel out of there.

In my state of adrenaline, I made it home in no time. When I got into my apartment, the exhaustion overwhelmed me, and I passed out on my couch.

When I woke up, there was no blood on my face, no bruises, no cuts, nothing.

I have tried looking up the motel I stayed at that night, and it doesn’t appear on any search. I also never got a charge on my credit card I used. Nothing remained to show any evidence of my time there.

I avoid mirrors now, using only my phone’s camera to check my reflection.

I told my parents, that my brother was on his way to me when he died. They cried, and hugged me. They told me it wasn’t my fault, and the relief I felt when they said that.. is indescribable.

I’ve talked about the stay in therapy, and my therapist assures me it was just a bad dream about my fears regarding my brother’s death.

But I will always remember the hotel clerk’s words.

And I will never stop looking over my shoulder, and I will never stop fighting back.
