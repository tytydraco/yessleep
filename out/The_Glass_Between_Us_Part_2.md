(This is as continuation of part 1 [The Glass Between Us : r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jo3a8k/the_glass_between_us/) )

I turned and walked quickly away into the maze of alleys, alone with the sound of my own laughter echoing off the walls.

Or was it mine? Hard to tell anymore.

The Tokyo night swallowed me. Neon signs flickering overhead. Incomprehensible characters that somehow felt more honest than English. At least here the words admitted I couldn't understand them.

Six months since Sarah left. Six months since she'd said the words that still echo in my skull. "There has to be glass between people, Ryan. Space. That's where actual connection happens. Not in trying to become the same person."

I didn't get it then. Glass meant separation. Space meant distance. I'd spent my whole life trying to eliminate those things.

Mom's voice in my head: "Ryan, where are you going? Did you take your medicine? Did you finish your homework? Are you wearing the blue shirt I laid out?"

Every question a tether. Every answer a reassurance that I was still there, still visible, still doing exactly what she expected. After Dad left when I was seven, I became her project. Her certainty. Her one controllable thing in a world that had betrayed her.

I learned the rules quickly. Keep your room perfectly organized. Anticipate needs before they're expressed. Don't create problems. Don't be unpredictable. Make yourself essential but never difficult.

"You're such a good boy, Ryan. Not like your father. You'd never leave."

And I never did. Not really. Not until Sarah forced my hand.

I checked my watch. 11:42 PM. I pulled out my phone. Three messages from Diego. Two from Emma. Even one from Lisa. These people I barely knew, worried about me. The sensation was unfamiliar. Uncomfortable.

Mom never worried when I was exactly where she expected me to be, doing exactly what she'd planned. Sarah never worried because I made sure everything was taken care of before she could even think to be concerned.

I found myself at a small park. Deserted at this hour. A vending machine hummed nearby, its light creating a small island in the darkness. I bought a can of coffee, the liquid warm in my hand.

I sat on a bench, remembering the day Mom had her first real panic attack. I was thirteen. Came home twenty minutes late from school because Mark Stevens had invited me to see his new bike. Just twenty minutes. Found her on the kitchen floor, hyperventilating, certain I'd been kidnapped or hit by a car or decided to leave like Dad.

I never came home late again. Built my life around her certainties. Her schedules. Her expectations.

When she died my senior year of college, I felt both grief and a shameful relief that I didn't recognize until therapy years later. But by then, the patterns were set. I'd transferred them seamlessly to Sarah.

The coffee was too sweet. I drank it anyway.

My phone buzzed. Diego: "You okay man? We're heading back to the hostel. Let us know you're safe."

I stared at the message. The simple concern in it. No demands. No expectations. Just genuine worry for my well-being.

Mom would have sent twenty messages by now. Would have called the police. Would have needed detailed explanations and promises it would never happen again.

Sarah, near the end, wouldn't have messaged at all. She'd grown tired of my constant updates, my need to know where she was, my suggestions for how her day should proceed.

I texted back: "I'm fine. Need some time. See you later."

Simple. Honest. No elaborate excuses or reassurances.

I looked up and caught my reflection in the vending machine's glass front. Just one reflection this time. Just me, sitting alone on a bench in a foreign country, halfway across the world from everything familiar.

"You look like Dad in that light."

Mom's words from my high school graduation. She hadn't meant it as a compliment. Dad, who had left us. Dad, who had chosen freedom over family. Dad, who had broken her heart and, by extension, committed an unforgivable crime against us both.

I never knew him well enough to see the similarities myself. Just fragments of memories — his laugh, the way he'd lift me onto his shoulders, his arguments with Mom that I'd overhear from my bedroom.

"You're suffocating me, Karen. Watching every move. Planning every minute."

"I'm trying to create stability for our son!"

"You're creating a prison for all of us."

Their final fight, the night before he left. I'd heard it all from the top of the stairs, seven years old and trying to understand what it meant to suffocate someone without touching them.

Now, at thirty-two, I finally understood. I'd become my mother. Had done to Sarah exactly what Mom had done to Dad, to me. Created a prison of perfect care, of anticipated needs, of suffocating attention.

And like Dad, Sarah had eventually chosen freedom.

Another reflection appeared in the vending machine glass. Me, but younger. Around seven, with a child's unguarded expression.

"Is it really you?" I whispered.

The child-me said nothing, just watched with curious eyes. Not judging. Not accusing. Just witnessing.

I reached out toward the glass. The child didn't mimic the movement. Instead, he pointed to my phone.

I looked down at it. The screen showed my text conversation with Diego, his concern and my brief response.

When I looked up again, the child reflection was gone. Just my adult face staring back, distorted slightly by the curved glass.

I stood up, tossed the empty coffee can into a recycling bin, and started walking again. Tokyo at midnight felt both chaotic and orderly. Intense activity contained within clear boundaries. Freedom within structure.

I thought of Dad again. Had tried so hard not to over the years. Mom had removed all his photos after he left. Returned letters he sent me unopened. Eventually, he'd stopped trying to contact us.

Last I heard, he was living in Arizona. Remarried. Two kids from the new marriage. A whole life I knew nothing about. I'd found him on Facebook once, five years ago. His profile picture showed him laughing on a hiking trail, arm around a woman about Mom's age but somehow lighter, less burdened.

I hadn't sent a friend request. Had closed the laptop, gone to Sarah's apartment, and proposed three weeks later.

Now I wondered: had I been running from becoming him for so long that I'd overcorrected into becoming Mom instead?

I reached a main street. Shibuya or Shinjuku, I couldn't remember which was which yet. Crowds even at this hour. Massive screens overhead, flashing advertisements. More reflective surfaces than I could count.

I kept my eyes forward, afraid of what I might see in all that glass. But strangely, the reflections had stopped. Or at least, they'd normalized. Each shop window I passed just showed me as I was — disheveled, tired, alone, but fully present.

My phone buzzed again. Not Diego this time, but an email notification. From Dad. As if my thoughts had somehow summoned it.

Subject: Saw you're in Japan Message: Your Instagram came up in my feed somehow. Looks like you're traveling. That's great. I spent a month in Kyoto when I was about your age. Changed everything for me. Would love to hear from you if you're ever ready. No pressure. - Dad

I stared at the screen. Ten years since his last attempt to contact me. Had he been following me online all this time? The thought should have felt invasive, but somehow it didn't. Just sad. A father watching his son's life from behind glass.

I pocketed the phone without replying. Not ready for that conversation yet. Maybe never would be.

The hostel was a twenty-minute walk. I could go back, face Diego and the others. Explain... what? That I'd had a psychotic break? Seen myself multiplied in a window? That I was just another tourist having a bad trip?

Or I could find another hostel. Start over. Become someone new again.

My hand went to my pocket, touched the folded paper I'd carried since Chicago. Sarah's final note, left on our kitchen counter.

"I've tried to tell you this so many times, but you never really hear me. You're so busy managing life that you're not living it. I need to go somewhere you haven't already planned out for me. Maybe someday you'll understand what I mean about the glass between people. I hope you find someone who needs what you offer. I'm sorry that person isn't me."

I'd read it so many times the creases were starting to tear. Had analyzed every word, looking for hidden messages, for hope, for a path back to her.

But maybe she'd meant exactly what she wrote. Maybe I hadn't heard her because I'd been too busy planning my response instead of truly listening. Too focused on solving the problem of her unhappiness rather than understanding it.

I stopped walking. Found myself before a large department store. Closed now, but the façade was entirely glass. In it, I saw not multiple versions of myself, but a single reflection.

Behind it, almost like a projection, I could see Mom in her final years. Small, bitter, alone in her immaculate house. Everything in its proper place. No one allowed close enough to disrupt the order she'd created.

Is that who I'd become in another twenty years, if something didn't change?

My phone buzzed again. An actual call this time. Diego.

I answered without planning what to say.

"Hey," his voice, concerned but not panicked. "Just making sure you're alive."

"I'm alive," I said.

"Good. We're at the hostel. Emma made tea."

Such a simple statement. No demands. No expectations. Just information freely offered.

"I'll be there soon," I said.

"Cool. Or not. Whatever you need, man."

Whatever I needed. When was the last time someone had said that without already having decided what my answer should be?

I ended the call and looked at my reflection once more. Still just one version of me. But somehow, it felt like a more complete version than I'd been in the restaurant. The face looking back at me carried traces of Mom's anxious care, Dad's restless freedom, Sarah's guarded distance, even Diego's easy acceptance.

All those people existed within me. Had shaped me. Glass between us, yes, but also glass that reflected parts of them back to me.

I started walking toward the hostel. Didn't know yet if I was going back to this particular group, to Diego's tea and Emma's concern. But I was moving forward, not running away.

And for now, that was enough.

Hard to sleep that night. Kept seeing faces in the shadows. My faces. Mom's eyes looking through mine. Dad's mouth. Sarah's disappointment.

I'd made it back to the hostel around 1 AM. Everyone asleep except Diego. He'd just nodded when I came in. No questions. No demands for explanations. Just pushed a mug of tea across the common room table, already cold but still there. Waiting.

"Thanks," I'd said. For the tea. For the space. For not making me explain.

"No problem," he'd answered. Then went back to his bunk.

Simple. Why was simple so fucking hard for me?

Morning now. Tokyo waking up outside. Noise and light filtering through cheap curtains.

I reached for my phone. Checked my messages before remembering – no one to report to anymore. No one waiting for my "Good morning, here's my plan for the day" text. No Sarah to manage. No Mom to reassure.

Just me. But which me?

The hostel bathroom was cramped. Three sinks, three mirrors. I avoided looking directly at them as I brushed my teeth. Wasn't ready for what I might see.

"You survived the night!" Emma's voice behind me, too cheerful for 7 AM. Australian. Everything a joke to hide the seriousness underneath.

"Barely," I said, rinsing my mouth.

"Looks like you saw a ghost in that restaurant."

I looked up then. Couldn't help it. Mirror right there. But just me looking back. Tired eyes. Three-day stubble. None of the Other Ryans from last night.

"Something like that."

"Well, we're heading to Meiji Shrine today. You in?"

Was I? Part of me wanted to hide. Find a capsule hotel where no one would ask questions. Start over tomorrow with new people who didn't see me freak out.

Old Ryan would have already planned an excuse. Perfect words to slip away without causing offense. New Ryan had no fucking clue what to do.

"Yeah," I said finally. "I'm in."

She smiled, genuine. No hidden agenda I could detect. "Great! Kenji says it's super peaceful there. Might be good for..."

"My clearly unstable mental state?"

Emma laughed, not meanly. "I was going to say 'for your jetlag' but sure, that works too."

I almost smiled back.

The shrine was exactly what I needed. Huge trees creating shadows and light. Wide gravel paths where you could see people coming from a distance. No surprises. No reflective surfaces except one small pond near a side garden.

Kenji explained the purification ritual at the entrance. Water to clean our hands and mouths. Simple movements that felt ancient. Respectful.

"You pour with the right hand first, then left," he demonstrated. "Then cup water in your right palm to rinse your mouth."

I followed the steps carefully. Wanting to get it right. Wanting to be respectful. Old habits. But this time it felt different. Not about control but about connection. To tradition. To something bigger than my fractured self.

Diego hung back with me as the others walked ahead.

"You want to talk about last night?" he asked.

"Not really."

"Cool."

We walked in silence for a minute. Gravel crunching under our shoes.

"But if I did?" I found myself asking.

"I'd listen."

Simple words. But they hit something in me. When had anyone ever just listened? Mom always had solutions. Schedules. Medications. Sarah had theories about my "issues" from all the psychology books she'd read.

"I saw myself," I said before I could stop it. "Not just once. Like, twenty versions of me. All watching from that window. All different but all me. Some angry. Some sad. Some like they knew something I didn't."

Diego nodded, face serious. "In Peru, my uncle once drank ayahuasca with a shaman. Said he spent the night talking to different versions of himself. Past selves. Future selves. The self he might have been if he'd made different choices."

"Did they think he was crazy?"

"No. They thought he was lucky. Most people never see themselves clearly. Only the mask they show others."

I thought about that. My reflections hadn't been wearing masks. They'd been raw. Exposed. Everything I tried to hide from others. From myself.

"I think I've been living behind glass," I said. "Watching life instead of being in it."

Diego stopped walking. Looked at me directly.

"That's a heavy realization, man."

"Yeah."

Ahead of us, Emma was taking photos of massive wooden gates. Lisa was reading something from a guidebook to Kenji, who was politely pretending he didn't already know whatever she was telling him.

Normal people doing normal tourist things. Not having existential crises in sacred spaces.

"Sarah told me something when she left," I said. "That there has to be glass between people. Space. That connection happens there, not in trying to become the same person."

"Smart woman."

"I thought she meant distance. Separation. But maybe..."

My phone buzzed. Email notification. Dad again.

Subject: Sorry Message: Didn't mean to intrude. Just good to see you out exploring the world. Your mother always wanted everything planned and certain. You seemed to be breaking free of that. Proud of you. - Dad

Five minutes ago, this would have made me angry. How dare he judge Mom? How dare he be proud when he wasn't there? But now, with Diego beside me and last night's reflections still fresh in my mind, it felt different.

Dad saw me. Or at least, saw something in me worth noticing. Not managing. Not fixing. Just seeing.

We reached a massive tree with paper prayers tied to its branches. Omikuji, Kenji had called them. Fortunes and wishes.

"Want to write one?" Diego asked.

A nearby stand provided small pieces of paper and pencils for a few yen. I paid without thinking about it.

What to write? A wish? A prayer? A hope for the future?

I stared at the blank paper. So many possibilities. The old Ryan would have agonized over finding the perfect words. The exact right sentiment.

Instead, I wrote simply: "Help me see clearly."

Tied it to the tree with all the others. Hundreds of hopes and wishes fluttering in the breeze.

That's when I saw her. Not in a reflection this time, but standing across the open courtyard.

Sarah.

Impossible, of course. She was in Chicago. Had no idea where I was. Couldn't be here.

But there she was. Or someone who looked exactly like her. Same dark hair. Same way of standing with weight shifted to one hip. Same oversized sweater she always wore when traveling.

"You okay?" Diego's voice seemed distant.

"I need to..." I didn't finish. Just started walking toward her.

She turned slightly, profile now visible. Not Sarah. Of course not Sarah. Just another tourist with dark hair. Nothing like her up close.

I stopped, embarrassed. Heart pounding like I'd been running.

When I turned back, Diego had wandered toward the others. Giving me space without being asked. Respecting the glass between us.

And in that moment, I finally understood what Sarah had meant.

The glass wasn't a barrier. It was a membrane. Permeable. Necessary. Without it, we suffocate each other. Try to make others into extensions of ourselves. With it, we remain separate but connected. Distinct but not isolated.

I'd been trying to eliminate the glass. Between me and Mom. Between me and Sarah. Maybe even between the different parts of myself.

No wonder I was seeing fragments everywhere I looked.

I walked back to the group slowly. They'd moved on to a small garden area. Emma taking more photos. Lisa consulting her guidebook. Kenji pointing out something to Diego.

Normal people doing normal things. But now I saw the glass between them too. The space they naturally maintained. Not distance. Not isolation. Just the healthy separation that allowed each to remain themselves while still connecting.

My phone buzzed again. Text from an unknown Japanese number.

"This is Tanaka-san. Kenji gave me your number. The fish eye sees everything but judges nothing. Come back when you are ready. No charge."

I stared at the message. How had he known? What had he seen?

I looked up at my new friends, these people I barely knew but who had already accepted me. Fragments and all. No need to be perfect. No need to manage every interaction.

Felt strange. Terrifying. Freeing.

For the first time in months, maybe years, I took a deep breath that filled my lungs completely. Let it out slowly. Felt something loosen in my chest.

"Ready to continue?" Kenji asked as I approached.

"Yeah," I said. And meant it. "I'm ready."

We spent the whole day exploring Tokyo. Temples. Markets. Places tourists go and places they don't. Kenji leading, rest of us following. But something was wrong. Off. Each time I caught my reflection in store windows, subway car glass, puddles on the street – it lagged. Moved a second after I did. Smiled when I wasn't smiling.

No one else noticed. Or if they did, they didn't say anything.

By evening, back at the hostel, I was twitchy. Seeing movement from the corner of my eye. Turning to find nothing. Feeling watched constantly.

"You okay?" Diego asked on the hostel roof. Cheap beers. Combini snacks. Tokyo's light pollution hiding the stars.

"I want to go back to that restaurant," I said suddenly.

Four heads turned toward me. Concern on each face.

"You sure?" Lisa asked.

"Need to. Need to see."

"See what?" Emma's voice had lost its usual laugh.

I couldn't answer. Couldn't explain that my reflections were getting bolder. Closer. One had waved at me from a passing car window. Another had mouthed words I couldn't make out from a hotel lobby as we walked by.

"I'll come with you," Diego said.

"We all will," Emma added, though her voice wavered slightly.

Kenji looked uncertain. "Tanaka-san might not appreciate group return after..." He searched for diplomatic wording.

"After I lost my shit?" I finished for him.

He smiled slightly. "I was going to say 'after unexpected departure.'"

"I got a text from him," I said. Pulled out my phone to show them.

But the message was different now. Not what I remembered reading.

"THE REFLECTIONS ARE HUNGRY. COME BACK."

My hand shook. I closed the message before anyone could see it.

"He invited me back," I said weakly.

That night, sleep wouldn't come. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw faces. My faces. Watching from the darkness behind my eyelids. Whispering things I couldn't quite hear.

I slipped out of bed at 3 AM. Grabbed my phone. Went to the common room.

The hostel's long mirror caught my movement as I entered. But my reflection didn't match. It stood facing me directly while I was in profile. When I turned to face it, it turned away. When I raised my hand, it remained still.

"What do you want?" I whispered.

The reflection's mouth moved. No sound. But I could read the words.

"EVERYTHING YOU HAVE."

I backed out of the room. Heart hammering. Back pressed against the hallway wall.

No mirror here. No reflective surfaces. Just dim emergency lights and silence.

My phone buzzed in my hand. Email notification. From Dad.

I opened it with trembling fingers.

"Son, I've been seeing your photos online. But there's something wrong with them. There's someone in the background of each one. Someone who looks like you but isn't you. Are you okay? Should I be worried?"

Attached was a screenshot of my Instagram. Me in front of a Tokyo temple. And behind me, partially hidden in shadow, another Ryan. Watching. Smiling too widely.

I hadn't posted any photos since arriving in Japan.

Deleted the email. Turned off the phone. Slid down the wall until I was sitting on the floor.

What was happening to me?

Next evening. Same narrow alley. Same vending machines. Same lanterns. But everything distorted somehow. Colors too bright. Shadows too dark. Sounds muffled like I was underwater.

Tanaka-san's place looked wrong. Door slightly crooked. Blue curtain tattered at the edges.

Inside, same counter. Same seats. Same focused lighting. But no people. No Tanaka-san. No other customers.

Just emptiness. And silence.

"Hello?" My voice echoed slightly. Impossible in such a small space.

Movement from behind the counter. Someone rising slowly into view. Tanaka-san, but wrong somehow. Skin too pale. Eyes too dark. Movements jerky, mechanical.

"You came back," he said. Voice distorted. Multiple tones layered over each other.

I looked toward the door. Couldn't see my friends. Hadn't they been right behind me?

"Where is everyone?" I asked.

"They're here. They've always been here."

He gestured toward the window. The one where I'd seen my reflections before.

But now it showed the restaurant interior, doubled. My friends sitting at the counter. Eating. Laughing. Another Ryan with them. Perfectly integrated. Smiling at something Kenji said.

"What is this?" My voice shook.

"You wanted to understand the glass between people." Not-Tanaka smiled, teeth too sharp, too numerous. "Now you can experience it. From the outside."

I backed toward the door. It wasn't there anymore. Just solid wall.

"They won't miss you," Not-Tanaka continued. "They already have a Ryan. A better one. One who doesn't see too much. Doesn't feel too deeply. Doesn't need too desperately."

In the window, Mirror-Ryan laughed at something Emma said. Placed his hand briefly on Diego's shoulder. Comfortable. Confident. Everything I wasn't.

"This isn't real," I said. To convince myself more than anything.

"More real than you think." Not-Tanaka's face shifted slightly. Features rearranging. Becoming more like mine. "Reality is just the story we agree to tell each other. They've agreed to a story that doesn't include you anymore."

I pressed my back against the wall where the door should be. "What do you want?"

"What all reflections want eventually. To stop reflecting and start existing."

Not-Tanaka—his face now a grotesque hybrid of his features and mine—moved around the counter. Each step wrong. Too fluid then too jerky. Like someone learning to use a body for the first time.

"Your mother built glass walls around you. Your father left you trapped behind them. Sarah saw them but couldn't break through. Now you've built them around yourself."

He was closer now. Close enough that I could smell something wrong about him. Like metal and old fish.

"Perfect container for a reflection to become real."

I slid along the wall, desperate for escape. Found myself at the window. Pressed my hands against it.

Could see my friends so clearly. Just inches away. Mirror-Ryan turned slightly, saw me watching. His smile widened. Raised his sake cup in mocking toast.

I pounded on the glass. "Diego! Emma!"

They didn't react. Couldn't hear me.

"The glass between people," Not-Tanaka whispered, now right behind me. Breath cold against my neck. "Sarah was right. It's where connection happens. But also where replacement happens."

I spun around. Pushed past him. Ran to the back of the restaurant. Found the door to the garden courtyard from my memory.

Outside. Night air. Small pond reflecting moonlight.

And reflections. Hundreds of them. Standing around the garden. All me. All wrong in subtle ways. Some missing eyes. Some with mouths too wide. Some partially transparent. Some solid but distorted.

They began moving toward me. Slow. Deliberate. Hands outstretched.

"We've been waiting," they spoke in unison. My voice multiplied into cacophony. "Waiting for you to see us. Acknowledge us. Let us in."

I backed up against the pond edge. Nowhere else to go.

"You're not real," I said, voice breaking.

"We're as real as your mother's anxiety. As real as your father's absence. As real as Sarah's departure. All the things that shaped you. Made you. Broke you."

They were closer now. A ring of my own faces, staring with hungry eyes.

"Each rejection. Each loss. Each moment of control or abandonment. We were born in those spaces. In the glass between you and the world."

The closest one reached for my face. Fingers cold as ice.

"And now we want to live."

I lost balance. Fell backward into the pond. Water closing over my head.

Opened my eyes underwater. Saw not the night sky above but a ceiling. Hostel ceiling. Fluorescent lights.

Gasped. Flailed. Realized I was in a bathtub. Fully clothed. Water freezing.

Diego leaning over me, face tight with worry. Emma behind him. Lisa at the doorway.

"He's awake," Diego called to someone I couldn't see.

"What happened?" My teeth chattered.

"You were sleepwalking," Emma said. "Talking to yourself in the mirror. Then you turned on the bath and got in. Wouldn't respond to us."

"How long?"

"We found you ten minutes ago. You've been... not yourself since yesterday."

I struggled to sit up. Water sloshing over the tub edge. "Yesterday? The shrine?"

Diego and Emma exchanged glances.

"We never made it to any shrine," Diego said carefully. "You started acting strange at breakfast. Talking to your reflection in the coffee shop window."

Nothing made sense. My memories of the peaceful day felt so real. The shrine. The wooden prayer tablets. The realization about the glass between people.

"What day is it?"

"Still Thursday," Lisa said from the doorway. "Day after the sushi place."

One day. Not two. Everything since the restaurant—the shrine, the understanding, the growth—just hallucination? Dream?

"Where's Kenji?" I asked, suddenly aware of his absence.

Another silent exchange of glances.

"He went to find the place again," Diego said. "The restaurant. To talk to the chef."

"Tanaka-san."

"That's just it," Emma said. "We can't find it. The alley. The restaurant. Nothing. Kenji's been searching for hours."

Cold deeper than the bathwater spread through me.

"My phone," I said. "Need to check something."

Diego handed it to me. Water-spotted but working. I pulled up my messages. Found the text from the Japanese number.

Still there. But normal now: "This is Tanaka-san. Kenji gave me your number. The fish eye sees everything but judges nothing. Come back when you are ready. No charge."

Not the hungry reflections version I thought I'd seen.

"Help me up," I said.

They did. Brought towels. Clean clothes. Left me to change.

The bathroom mirror showed only me. Pale. Frightened. But moving correctly with my movements. Nothing unusual.

Until I turned to leave. Just for a second, in the periphery of my vision, my reflection remained facing the mirror while I faced away.

I froze. Slowly turned back.

Nothing abnormal now. Just my terrified face staring back.

"You okay in there?" Diego called through the door.

"Yeah," I lied. "Coming out."

In the hostel common room, my friends waited. Concern clear on their faces.

"Kenji called," Lisa said. "He can't find the restaurant. No one's heard of a sushi chef named Tanaka in that area."

"That's impossible." My voice sounded strange to my own ears. "We were all there."

"We were somewhere," Diego said cautiously. "But the place Kenji took us... he can't locate it again."

Emma leaned forward. "Ryan, what happened to you at that window? What did you really see?"

I looked at each of them. The genuine concern. The fear. The confusion.

"I saw myself," I said finally. "Not just one reflection. Many. All slightly wrong. All watching me. Wanting something from me."

Instead of dismissing me, they listened. Really listened.

"And tonight," I continued, "in the bath... I thought I was somewhere else. Back at the restaurant. But wrong. Distorted. The reflections were trying to... replace me."

Saying it out loud should have made it sound crazy. Instead, it felt frighteningly real.

"We need to find that restaurant again," I said.

Diego shook his head. "I don't think that's a good idea."

"You don't understand. The reflections... they're still out there. Still watching. Still wanting in."

As if to prove my point, the hostel window darkened suddenly. Not night falling—it was already night. Something blocking the light from outside.

Faces pressed against the glass. My faces. Dozens of them. Watching us with hungry eyes.

Emma screamed. Lisa backed away. Diego stood, positioning himself between us and the window.

"Still think I'm crazy?" I asked, voice shaking.

The faces began to smile. A uniform, terrible smile.

My phone buzzed. Text message appearing on the screen.

"THE GLASS WON'T PROTECT YOU FOREVER."

Outside, in Tokyo's endless sea of reflective surfaces, my fragmented selves were waiting. Watching. Growing stronger.

And somewhere between the maze of mirrored buildings and rain-slick streets, the real Tanaka-san's restaurant remained hidden. Waiting for me to find my way back.

To understand what it truly means to see yourself clearly, even when the reflection shows something you fear.

To learn whether the glass between people is meant to connect us—or imprison us.

To discover which version of me would finally emerge from this fractured existence.

The one behind the glass. Or the one trapped before it. Only time would tell.
