From a Drinking Fellow (not many down; enough to forget the words in Webster's):

I don't know any other way to say what I have to say except to just say it: I know there are seven other people out there who got home late one day and found something crammed into their mailbox, right next to the evening newspaper and that month's batch of bills. A bag, a brown paper bag, something one would use to pack up a lunch, that you found was wrapped over again numerous times in duct tape, found to be a paper bag only when you opened it, stared into its interior, and took in its inner walling and the thing sitting at the bottom of the bag. If you were me, you did this and didn't even know there was a pigeon's head on the bottom of the bag, wrapped over in the duct tape, its outline clearly birdlike yet indistinguishable from that of any other fowl.

Did the package smell for anyone? Not for me, even though the thing inside was rotted and decomposed more than a month-old middle-of-the-median roadkill. The finger at the bottom of the bag didn't smell. It didn't reek. It had no odor, except maybe for some nasal reminders of the odorless yet powerful aroma of saliva. It was like that, if the taste of saliva had a smell. It goes well, I suppose, with the fact that the finger didn't have a fingernail: it had a tooth right where that's supposed to be. Do you guys still think that's crazy? A fingernail that's a tooth?

For me, the tooth looked like a human's. It looked natural, though, natural in its placement, as if it was roused at the root and grew in. It looked natural that way, otherwise entirely unnatural. Irrational. I dunno. I can't think of many adjectives right now.

I suppose if I wasn't in the right mind at the moment I opened the package, I wouldn't have thought it was a finger. I would have thought it was the world's most compact stick of dynamite, only if it were capped and not fused. That doesn't exist, though, so I guess I'm spewing bullshit. I mean to say that the finger was gray, its texture rough. This was the skin beneath the skin that had already aged off. I don't know what color the outer skin (the veneer?) was, or what it was. Does skin blacken as it decomposes? If not, I guess the outer layer was African American. It went with the liquid stuff leaking from the flattened end where the finger was cleanly cut away from the knuckle. The color of that stuff was reddish. Darkest maroon beneath the moon (dos that rhyme?)

I don't know about you seven, but I touched the finger immediately. You may have thought it was a joint from your good Buddy Walt, if you shoot up often, but I thought it was what I said it looked like to me in the moment, a little stick of dynamite, and I wanted to get rid of it. If it were dynamite, I guess the person who made it had the firmest press of his finger if he had printed on a full fingerprint. The fingerprint that was pressed into the second inner layer of skin. I saw the layers of shed black skin laying around the bottom of the bag when I shifted it around and adjusted into the light above my counter. Some bits had their leftovers of a fingerprint, too.

Now, I admit it's possible I'm the only person who knows there are seven other people out there with the same package. Did you all get the letter, too? It was at the bottom of the bag. I cut out the pigeon's head from the duct tape and saw: tightly rolled into a little hole in its face, where its beak should be, was a piece of paper. I removed it, and the little pigeon's head's eyes just popped and bounced around my counter; I still haven't found them. The paper making itself a bird's beak had on it, written, in small print, after I enrolled it:

"Tommy Tony has eight fingers, Tall Tony has eight fingers, Tommy Tony has eight toes, Tall Tony has eight toes, But they don't have feet, And they're like an ogre, And Daddy Randy gave the fingers, Like gold, to some to the needy. Hello, friend, Merry a merry Christmas."

Tell me if any of you got the note as well. Is it the same? Does it make more sense?

And do any of you still have your finger? Mine is barely any longer. It's been peeling and peeling away like an orange. Skin the colors dark, yet many and varied. Black, then gray, than the color of its blood, then the color of molasses, then the color of machine oil. Now, the color of honey if it were melted wood. And barely any longer, as I said. It is peeling away and is like a steel wool, ended with a tooth; still intact, never yellowed. Perhaps grown, in fact, like the nail it was making itself be.

If you seven are out there, I know you don't have much time either before it's dead and gone and nevermore, never any more, ever at all. I got a second package in the mail. It was another duct-tape bag, flattened as if air-sealed. Envelope inside. I will know if who you are is true if you got the same letter as me. Trust me, I know you seven others got it too.
