Background: I work at a local restaurant in my area; just a minimum wage job as a dishwasher. Typically, as dishwashers we spend a lot of time at the end of the day cleaning up and doing various maintenance jobs after we close at 8:00pm. Most nights, including the one in this story, the dishwashers are the last people to leave. There's only ever 2 dishwashers on per night, so it was just me and my coworker in the restaurant. The building itself is a repurposed residential home in a sparsely populated street. Behind the building is a backyard. I never go back there, but we keep some tools there for when we tend to the gardens at the front of the building. The backyard is pretty small, maybe 128 square feet total (rectangle shape).



It was a mostly normal Tuesday night. The time is around 11:34pm. We ended up taking ages to finish cleaning up the kitchen and washing the last dishes. It was one of the busiest nights we'd had in months. I was about to clock out when my coworker came in after taking out the trash. He reminded me, "Yo, we forgot to tend to the backyard." We went out there with some basic gardening tools, and I surveyed the area. We don't have much to do out there, except we do need to cut the grass lining the fence. The grass was about 4ft high now, comparatively to the 6ft tall fence. We spend a while cutting the grass until it's all as short as the rest of the backyard. I check my phone to see the time, and it's around 1:00am now. At this point, I'm panicking. I don't have my own car or driver's license at the time of this happening, so I would have to call a family member at this hour. 

  
I start walking inside the restaurant to clock out and think of what to do. Suddenly, my coworker stops me again and says, "bro, where you going? we havent event fed the shed beast yet!" This was really confusing because there was no shed beast. We were just in there a moment ago putting the gardening tools away. I certainly saw no shed beast, and my coworker didn't seem to acknowledge one. My coworker walks into the kitchen, which we just finished deep cleaning not long ago, and starts cooking. I ask him what the fuck he's doing, and he says he's preparing food for the shed beast. After not long, he puts the burger he cooked on a plate and walks outside to the shed. Suddenly I'm hit with fear. I can't see anything, but I hear a deep breathing sound coming from inside the shed. My coworker, also clearly stricken with fear, approaches the shed door slowly and quickly opens, throws the burger and plate in, and closes. The plate breaks, and we can hear something eating on the other side. After a moment, it sort of roars. My coworker says to me then, "bro, we fucked up. we need to get more food. the shed beast isnt pleased with our offering." And so, a few more times it repeats. We each cook up a couple dishes. throw them into the shed quickly and carefully, only to feel an overwhelming fear and desperation to cook more food. 



Eventually, I look at my phone, and it's already roughly 3:30am. I say to my coworker, "bro what the fuck, its already 3:30! we gotta wrap this up and finish this shit already." He starts going off on a tangent about how "we need to feed the shed beast", and "if we dont please it, we'll die". At this point I'm too tired to deal with it. So, I tell him, "Well if you like this shed beast so much why dont you pay it a visit?!" In a moment of anger and frustration, I kicked the shed door open and shoved my coworker in there. He started screaming back at me to let him out, and to let him live. I don't listen to it. I mean, we just kept wasting food and breaking plates for his sick entertainment. I wasn't going to buy into his bullshit anymore. Afterwards the fear I felt when around the shed was gone. It was like a weight had been taken off of me.

  
There was no more roars. After I clocked out I went to go check on him and he still hadn't come out. His sweatshirt and phone he left by the door were still there, and the noises from the shed ceased. I looked inside to check, and it was just a shed. Just like the one we got our tools in, and the one we put the tools back in. My coworker wasn't in there. He'd always been non-serious and playing jokes anyway. I believed he just went through the fence gate when I was calling my dad inside the building. 

  
I left work for the night without hearing from him again. Later that week I'd heard he wasn't coming in or answering his phone. I never said anything about it to anyone until this post. I'm really concerned about this. This seems like a huge safety hazard. First, we're highschoolers. We shouldn't be working that late on a school night. This has got to be some kind of workers rights violation. Second, this side of the building has no cameras unlike the rest of the building. There was no way anyone could have known what happened without being there. Third, theres no fucking lights in that yard! We had to keep the door to the kitchen open the whole time to let the light shine out, and we STILL could barely see shit! Theres sharp things inside that shed, and we could barely tell a handel from a blade in that lighting! 

  
Anyways, sorry for the tangent. I just can't help but feel uneasy when thinking about that shed. I though this would be a good place to post about it because I've certainly lost plenty of sleep over this whole thing. I never saw anything really in the shed, but I did get a quick glimpse of what i think were eyes? I don't know, I didn't take the time to investigate out of fear for my life.
