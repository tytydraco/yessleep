 Hi, I'm John and I'm the smartest student in my class, but that doesn't mean I have it easy. I'm constantly bullied by my classmates because of my intelligence.

 I wanted to share with you the story that changed my life. It all started when I was walking down the street, listening to my music, when I noticed an old man. He was wearing a long, black coat and had a hood pulled up over his head. He was standing in the middle of the sidewalk, just staring off into the distance. I stopped and stared at him for a moment, wondering what he was doing there. Then he turned and looked right at me. "What are you looking at kid?" he asked in a gruff voice. I was taken aback by his sudden question. "Um, nothing," I stammered. "I was just walking to school." He nodded slowly and then said, "Be careful out there. Have you heard the story about the forgotten diary of the devil?"

"No, I haven't," I said. "What's it about?" The old man chuckled. "It's said that long ago, the devil wrote down all of his secrets in a diary. But then he lost it, and no one has seen it since. Some say it's still out there, waiting to be found." I was intrigued. "Do you think it's real?" The old man shrugged. "Who knows? But if you ever find it, make sure you don't open it. The devil's secrets are not meant for mortal eyes." He winked at me and then walked away, leaving me with my thoughts. I continued on my way to school, wondering if the forgotten diary of the devil really existed.

I mean, how could something like that even exist? It seemed like something out of a horror movie. But then I started to think about it more and more. What if it was real? What if there was a diary out there that contained all the secrets of the devil? It seemed too crazy to be true, but I couldn't help but wonder.

Suddenly I heard a loud crash. I looked up to see a truck had hit a man crossing the street. He was lying on the ground, motionless. I ran over to him, my heart pounding.

"Are you okay?" I asked, kneeling down beside him. He didn't answer. I looked around for help, but no one else was around. I noticed something had fallen out of his pocket. It was a book.

It had a black cover with a red pentagram on it. I was both scared and intrigued. I had never seen anything like this before. I reached out and grabbed the book, and as soon as I did, I felt a chill run down my spine. I knew that this was no ordinary book. It was a diary, but not just any diary. It was the Devil's Diary. I quickly picked it up and put it in my bag, not wanting anyone else to see it.

I stayed with the man until the ambulance arrived and took him away. As I watched them drive away, I wondered what was in the book and why he had been carrying it with him.

I shuddered at the thought and quickened my pace. I knew that whatever secrets were hidden in this book were not meant for me to know. But still, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of curiosity.

\*\*\*

I am running late for the class.

I had to get to school before the bell rang or else I'd be in trouble. As I rushed through the school doors, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I was walking down the hallway, trying to get to my classroom as quickly as possible, when I felt a sudden jolt. I had bumped into someone with my backpack. "Hey, watch where you're going!" a voice shouted. I looked up to see the school bully, standing there with a scowl on his face. I gulped. "I'm sorry," I said. "It was an accident." The bully just glared at me. "I want you to know that you better watch your back," Jake said. "I'm gonna beat you up after school today."

I gulped. I knew Jake was serious. He had a reputation for being a tough guy and I didn't want to get on his bad side. "Look, Jake," I said, trying to stay calm. "I don't want any trouble. Can't we just forget about this?" Jake laughed and shook his head. "No way," he said. "You're gonna get what's coming to you." My heart was pounding in my chest as I watched Jake walk away. I knew I had to do something or else he would come after me after school. I had to find a way to stop him.

I sit in my desk, my eyes darting around the room. I can feel the weight of the book in my bag. I know that it's forbidden, but I can't help but be curious.

My teacher is lecturing at the front of the room, but I'm not paying attention. All I can think about is the book. What secrets does it hold? What will happen if I get caught?

I take a deep breath and make a decision. I slowly reach into my bag and pull out the diary. I open it to the first page and start to read.

"If you read this, you will be cursed with a fate worse than death. You will be denied entry to both Heaven and Hell. You will be forever trapped in a state of limbo, unable to move on to the afterlife."

The words were strange and unfamiliar. It was like nothing I had ever read before, and I couldn't help but feel a little scared. The words seemed to be written in a language that was not of this world, and yet somehow I could understand them.

It seems like it could be a real curse if I do.

After some thought, I've decided to take the plunge and keep reading. Who knows what I'll find?

As I start reading, I felt my heart racing faster and faster. The words seemed to be describing something dark and sinister, something that made me feel uneasy. I felt like I was being pulled into a world of darkness and evil, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go any further.

But then something strange happened. The words began to make sense. They seemed to be telling a story about John. He was a strong and courageous man who was always willing to take on any challenge.

One day, John was challenged to a fight by a much bigger and stronger opponent. Knowing that he could not win in a physical fight, John decided to use his wits instead. He quickly removed his shoes and filled them with his s\*it.

When the fight began, John's opponent was taken aback by the sight of John's shoes filled with s\*it. Thinking that John was crazy, he charged forward with all his might. But when he tried to punch John, the hit from s\*it shoes caused him to lose his balance.

John took advantage of this opportunity and quickly pinned his opponent down. After a few minutes of struggling, the opponent finally gave up and conceded defeat.

John had won the fight by using his wits and courage. He had proven that even the smallest of things can be used to great effect if used correctly. From then on, John was known as the brave man who fight by shi\*ting inside his shoes.

That was both fascinating and terrifying at the same time. I couldn't help but be drawn in by the story, and before long I had finished it. I start to feel more confident, knowing that I have a plan now. I close the book and put it back in to my backpack, feeling ready to take on the bully.

\*\*\*

I was walking through the cafeteria,, feeling a little nervous about the fight with the Jake. I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn't even notice my best friend Tom walking towards me until he called out my name. "Hey, what's up?" Tom said, giving me a friendly smile. I smiled back, trying to hide my nervousness. "Oh, not much. Just thinking about the fight I have to have later." Tom's eyes widened. "You're fighting someone? Who?" "Jake," I said, feeling my stomach twist into knots. "I got a plan and I'm going to try it out." Tom shook his head. "That's crazy! I want to come and watch." I shook my head. "No way. That's too dangerous." Tom shrugged. "I know, but I want to help you out. I'll hide in the bushes and watch from there. That way, if anything happens, I can jump in and help you out." I hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "Okay, that sounds like a plan." Tom grinned. "Great! I'll see you there." He gave me a quick hug before running off. I watched him go, feeling a little better knowing that he would be there to help me out if anything went wrong.

The rest of the day went fast. After the school I nervously walked into the school parking lot, my heart pounding in my chest. I knew what I had to do, but I was scared. I had to face my bully.

I can already feel the anger and fear bubbling up inside me. My palms are sweaty and my stomach is in knots as I get closer.

I finally reach the spot where the Jack is waiting. I spotted him across the lot, leaning against his car, looking smug and confident. He looks me up and down with a sneer on his face. I try to stay calm. I remind myself that I'm not alone in this fight, and that I have people who care about me and are willing to help me if things get out of hand. The bully starts to say something, but before he can finish, i pull down my pant and start sh\*ting inside my shoe.

The Jack face turns pale and he takes a few steps back. I stand there, my face expressionless, and I look him straight in the eye. I can see the shock and confusion in his eyes. I held the shoe in front of me like a shield and faced the bully.

"What are you going to do with that?" Jack said. "Hit me with it?"

"Maybe," I said, trying to sound brave. "But if you don't leave me alone, you'll find out."

I felt my heart racing as I saw Jack charging towards me. He was bigger and stronger than me, and I knew I had to think fast. I threw one of the shoes in the Jack's face, temporarily blinding him. He stumbled back. I quickly tackle him on the ground and pinned him down. I shouted for help and soon Tom, holding a stick came to my rescue. We beat the bully and I take the opportunity to tell him that this is what happens when someone messes with us. Finally Jack pass out.

I saw Tom standing there with a huge smile on his face. He was clapping and cheering me on. "You did it!" he shouted. "You finally stood up to Jack!"

I couldn't believe it. Tom had been my biggest supporter throughout this whole ordeal, and now he was congratulating me on my victory. I felt a wave of relief wash over me as I realized that the bully was no longer a threat.

Tom asked me where I learned the tactic of s\*it shoes. I was a bit taken aback by the question, but I decided to tell him the truth. I told him about the Devil's Diary, a book I had found on my way to school.

"I can't believe you have it!" he exclaimed. "I've been searching for it for so long.

Then said, "I need your help. I need you to give me the Devil's Diary."

I stared at him in disbelief. "The Devil's Diary? What on earth do you need that for?"

Tom looked away, embarrassed.

"I need it to bring my dad back," He said. "He died a few months ago, and I can't accept it. I need to find a way to bring him back."

I shook my head. "Tom, this is crazy. You can't just go around asking people for the Devil's Diary."

Tom looked me in the eye and said, "Please, I'm begging you. I need your help." I sighed and said, "Okay, but i cant let you read the Devil's Diary, you will get cursed.."

Tom, nodded "I understand," he said. "

I nervously start reading the Devil's Diary, my hands shaking as I did so.

"Do you think we can use this to bring my dad back?"

I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to say. I knew that the diary contained powerful magic, but I wasn't sure if it was enough to bring someone back from death.

"I don't know," I said finally. "But we can certainly try."

Tom nodded, his expression determined. "Let's do it," he said.

I spent the next few hours pouring over the diary, looking for any clues that might help us bring Tom's dad back. I found a story about a family living in a small village in the Middle Ages. The father of the family was a kind and hardworking man. One day, he decided to go to the nearby shop to buy milk for his family.

Unfortunately, he never returned home. The family searched everywhere for him, but they could not find him. They were desperate and did not know what to do.

One day, an old man appeared in the village and told them that he could help them find their father if they were willing to make a sacrifice. He said that they needed to sacrifice someone in order to reunite with their father.

"This is getting weird. We need to sacrifice someone in order to figure out the phrase." I gulped. "Sacrifice someone? That's crazy!"

Tom nodded. "I know. But it's the only way. We have to do it if we want to figure out the phrase."

I shook my head. "No way. There has to be another way."

Tom sighed. "I'm sorry, but I don't think there is. We have to do this if we want to find out what the phrase is."

I looked away, not wanting to believe what he was saying. But deep down, I knew he was right. We had no choice but to sacrifice Jack if we wanted to find out the devil's phrase.

\*\*\*

I looked at Tom, my eyes wide with fear. We had just finished drawing the pentagram on the ground and placing Jack's body inside.

"Are you sure you want to do this?" I asked.

Tom nodded, "Yes," He said. "It's the only way."

I nodded and stepped back. He began to chant the ancient words of devil, and I joined in, my voice trembling with fear and anticipation. As we spoke the final words of the spell, a red light filled the sky and Jack's body disappeared in a puff of smoke. I was trembling with fear, not knowing what to expect.

Suddenly we heard a deep voice. "You have come here to reunite with your father?." Tom stepped forward, his eyes wide with anticipation. "What do I have to do?" he asked.

 the voice said. "To do this, you must hold the front door handle and recite a special phrase "I am going for milk. I will be right back. ", "Then go forward and never stop or look back."

Tom eyes filling with tears. "Ok," He said. "Thank you Devil."

 The voice was getting fainter and fainter, until it was gone completely. I stood there for a few moments, trying to process what had just happened.

"Hey, can you come over to my house?" Tom asked me. I looked at him, a bit surprised. "What for?" "I just want you to assist me with the ritual," he said. "It won't take long, I promise."

I hesitated for a moment, but then I nodded. "Okay, sure. When do you want me to come over?"

"How about now?" he said with a smile.

\*\*\*

Tom grasped the cold metal handle of the front door and took a deep breath. He turned back to the house and said, "I am going for milk. I will be right back,". With that, he opened the door and stepped outside. He took a few steps forward, feeling the ground beneath his feet, and then he was off, walking down the street.

I watched as my friend Tom walked down the street. He had a certain air about him, a confidence that I had never seen before. He seemed to be in his own world, and I couldn't help but follow him. I was walking with my friend, when I saw the same track that had hit the man in the morning.

I stopped in my tracks and shouted out to my friend, "Stop! Don't go any further!" But he just kept walking, not paying attention to me. I started to panic as I watched him get closer and closer to the track. I shouted out again, but he still didn't listen. I started running towards him, but it was too late.

The track hit him. I screamed out in horror as I watched my friend get thrown into the air and land on the ground. I ran over to him and saw that he was dead. I started crying and screaming for help, but no one came.

I felt so helpless as I watched Tom lying there motionless. I knew that this was all my fault for not being able to stop him in time. I felt so guilty and wished that I could have done something to prevent this from happening.

Suddenly I felt a cold hand grab my arm and I spun around to see an old man that i met in the morning standing there. He had a mischievous smile on his face.

He reached out and snatched the devil's diary from my hands. "The devil's secrets are not meant for mortal eyes." he said in a gruffy voice.

 "What happened to Tom?" I asked, my voice trembling. The old man sighed and looked at Tom body. "Tom is dead. He's reunited with his father in Hell," he said laughing. I stood there in shock, my arm still tingling from where the old man had grabbed it.

I felt my heart sink. I had been so close to saving him, but it was too late. I had failed. Tears streamed down my face as I looked as old man started to walked away. His laughter echoed in the air as he held the Devil's Diary tightly in his hands. I knew that I would never forget this day. The old man's words still rang in my ears: "The devil's secrets are not meant for mortal eyes."
