As the title says, I suspect my mother is a serial killer. A few days ago I was clearing some stuff out of the attic when I found a weird looking wooden box with some eyes painted on it tucked away in the corner. Being my overly curious self, I looked inside and found it was packed with journals and letters. I read them, and I seriously can’t tell if this was some weird fiction she wrote or were accurate accounts of her life before I was born, but either way, I don’t want to ask. Some of the shit written here is dark. 

I have no idea where else to share this in case it does end up being fiction, so here it goes, entry one: 

——————————————————————————


“Hey there pretty lady, what are you doing out here in the dark? It’s starting to snow if you didn’t know.”

I sighed. It was too cold for this shit. But I knew the type and figured it would be best if I at least acknowledged him. 

My boots squelched in the mud as I approached the idling truck. When I was close enough to see his ruddy, bearded face I shrugged, and in a well-crafted monotone designed to sound as unappealing as possible said, “walking.” 

He guffawed and leaned over to unlock his passenger-side door. “Hop on in, I’ll give you a ride.” He said that last part with a not so subtle wink. 

I humored him and took a look inside. The seats and floors were littered with wrappers and bottles. It smelled terrible too. Like a mixture of sweat and cigarettes. I also noticed a large knife jammed between his seat and the center console. I took a step back and stared up at him, silent. 

I was far too young when I first started attracting the attention of older men, and it had only gotten worse with time. Nothing seemed to help. I tried heavy hoodies and cargo pants, barely maintaining my short brown hair with some scissors in my pack, and constantly wearing big sunglasses that hid eyes the color of ice. Though sometimes they were storm-blue. Depends on who you ask. 

Yet always, always, I drew them in. I wish I knew why. It certainly wasn’t my body. Years on the road had kept me lean, and I tried my best to get rid of my natural curves through fasting and intense exercise, though it didn’t help much. They lingered, and I was still, according to a lot of people, ‘beautiful.’ Pair that with the spray of freckles across my nose and lack of affect in my tone and you got a girl who often had to take drastic measures to be left alone. 

He frowned, confused. Tried waving a couple of times, but I kept staring. As if on cue, I watched his face twist when I didn’t respond to him flirting. “Oh, so that’s how it is huh? Am I being too nice to ya? Want me to be meaner? I heard that’s how y’all like us to be these days.” He paused, again waiting for me to respond or at least react, but I didn’t. He turned red as a tomato. “Answer me damn it,” he growled. 

I tightened the straps on my pack, gave him the finger, and headed towards the gas station across the street. I really needed to stock up on supplies. I heard him cursing and yelling after me, but I ignored it. Most of the time, that was enough. These kinds of men, as a rule, were cowards. 

I hummed to myself as tiny specks of snow drifted down from the darkening sky. I stuck out my tongue and caught a few. It was fun feeling them melt. The wind picked up and carried a nasty bite with it, leaving me wondering whether I should have taken the offered ride. I had seen people freeze to death in temperatures like this, and there wasn’t a motel for miles. 

I passed by the gas pumps and rifled through the trash for a bit. You’d be surprised what you find in gas station trash cans. I’ve found food still in its packaging, clothes, and more. The gloves I wore came from the trash, actually. They had rubber grips and provided good insulation. I sighed — there wasn’t much in these here cans outside of a half full liquor bottle. Oh well. Can’t get lucky all the time. I was about to step inside the station when I heard the truck pull into the lot and screech to a stop. 

Gas billowed out the exhaust and stained the air. The driver killed the engine, slammed his door open, and started towards me. He was huge. Easily over three hundred pounds and it wasn’t all fat. At his hip was a revolver built to match his size. I tensed, considering whether I should make space or get closer. The only tools I had on me for self-defense were a bayonet passed down to me by my father and some pepper spray. 

My indecision cost me. He was too close for me to grab either in time now. I eyed the gas station attendant behind the counter and made myself look pleading, but the reedy, spectacled boy went back to his magazine, unbothered by the threatened woman outside. 

“You little bitch. What makes you think you can tease me with that pouty mouth and get away with it? Come here.” He reached for me with his hairy hands. I forced out a yelp and staggered backwards, throwing an arm up across my face in defense. 

“Please, don’t hurt me,” I begged. 

“Should have thought about that before all that teasing of yours,” he snarled. He dug his hands into my hair and yanked me away from the door. I screamed and shouted until my voice was hoarse. But this was the rural Midwest. No one was coming. Not at this hour. He took me past his truck and out towards the tree line behind the gas station, where there were no cameras. He kept calling me a bitch under his breath and said it was my fault he had to do this. I slapped at his arms but the strikes were ineffective. 

After we were well hidden from view, I was tossed up against a tree, the impact slightly lessened by my pack. Clods of snow fell from the branches and hit us both. He shook his head, swearing, and leaned in. I could feel hot breaths and spit on my face and neck along with the terrible reek of alcohol. I hoped it would be over quick. I always hoped that. 

With bleary eyes he looked my body over and licked his lips. “I hate that y’all make me do this,” he whispered as he pressed his bulk up against me, hands fumbling at my clothes. 

A wicked smile suddenly cut across my face like ice breaking on a frozen lake. He stopped, stunned by the sudden change of emotion, then gaped in surprise at the needle poking in his neck. “The hell…” he muttered before crashing down. 

———————————————————————————

I stoked the fire and waited for Gabe to wake up. Initially I wasn’t sure if the dosage would be enough to put down a man double the size of my normal targets, but hey, it worked! I left him naked and propped upright against a large rock, bound at the wrists and ankles with rope. At his feet, I laid my personal treasures. Currently, I was in possession of only eight pairs. They were so shrunken and black that the untrained eye could be forgiven for thinking I carried pebbles in a jar of preservative. But what was often the case was that my captives would see the jar and feel their bindings and consequently know what was to befall them. 

I felt giddy with a happiness that eluded me outside of moments like this. A true joy that radiated throughout my entire being. Here I could allow my very soul to enter my voice and sing to the men who were the most vital part of this sacred dance. So I sang, the firelight casting my shadow across the cave walls as I pirouetted and flowed, ready to begin Gabe’s much needed operation. 

Unfortunately, I was lacking in anesthetic!

I heard him begin to moan, and when his eyes finally opened I was there to greet him. “Smile, beautiful!” He howled. I laughed. 

——————————————————————————

The next morning found me resting my head on the countertop of the first diner I had spotted off the highway. 

I had torn into a stack of pancakes and downed two cups of black coffee before the waitress could come back and ask how everything was going. What could I say, it was my comfort food. My dad’s too. It always made me feel a bit better  to splurge after she took over. The older woman who worked there, Kathy, ended up bringing me an extra plate of bacon and eggs on the house because it looked like ‘I needed it.’ 

I thanked her, though it bothered me that I stood out enough for her to notice me. That told me I should get going soon, but I was shaken up. 

Typically, when Kali took over, it was for a relatively short length of time and I was able to, on some level, influence certain choices she made. But this time around, she had retained control for an entire night. I was forced to spectate, my inner voice silenced completely, as she went above and beyond with Gabe. There was hardly anything of him left by the time the wolves got to his remains. I felt control return only after I was on the highway but by then it was too late. I was in possession of Gabe’s truck. 

I drove deep into the woods at my first opportunity and ditched the vehicle, hoping the still falling snow would cover my tracks. I cursed Kali over and over for taking too many risks and walked the next six miles until I arrived at the diner. I felt her there the whole time floating within my subconscious, singing her death-song, a wide feline-smile on her face. Don’t ask me what she is. I have no clue. I simply woke up one day and knew she was there, hungry for violence. 

“Good riddance I say,” clucked Kathy, her eyes glued to the TV screen. She shook her head and motioned to me with the remote. “That’s why I hate to see a girl traveling alone. You aren’t here alone, right?”

On the news they were reporting the story of a hero police officer and loving father of three who had gone missing the night before with the last remaining footage of him being a CCTV clip of him escorting away a ‘thief’ from a gas station which, according to the reporter, was his favorite to visit while on duty. There were multiple angles captured that night, and when one of them showed my face I felt a sinking feeling in my gut. 

Kathy grew visibly tense and tried her best not to  make it obvious that she was glancing my way, but I caught it. I slid off the stool and started towards the door. 

“Wait dear!” Kathy called. She rushed around the counter as fast as her aged legs would allow. 

I don’t know why I waited. Everything within me except for Kali was screaming to run. I was afraid for myself and knew every moment counted if I was going to escape across the border. But it had been so long since I had spoken to someone who wasn’t trying to hurt me. Maybe that is why I stayed. 

That decision would lead to more deaths than I ever wanted to be responsible for. 

“Listen hun, I knew that man there. He was no good. And you will find a lot of people around these parts would agree. So if you stand your ground and give a statement, I am sure it will all work out. But if you run, everyone will think you are guilty. You are not a runner, are ye?” 

I shook her arm off me. “Call the police and I will be back,” I growled over my shoulder. Kathy squeaked and stepped away. There wasn’t anger in her eyes. Only hurt. 

Powerful winds tore at my hair and face, carrying the sound of rapidly approaching sirens with it. I stumbled through the knee deep snow, desperately trying to reach the tree line that would take me over the border. I was so weak, my body’s reserves fading rapidly. But freedom was so close! I could nearly touch it. I just had to push a bit harder…

“STOP,” blared an artificially boosted voice. I turned and saw several snowmobiles rapidly gaining on me. 

I surprised myself when I started to ask Kali to take over. I was completely spent, left to crawl on my hands and knees through mud and snow uphill. She did not deign to reply. Her presence merely watched, excited at the violence to come. 

It never did. I collapsed right at the edge of the Canadian border. The last thing I remembered before drifting into a warm deep sleep was a sense of gratitude at finally being able to rest.
