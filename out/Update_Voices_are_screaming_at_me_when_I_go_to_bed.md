I wanted to give an update on [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1memj1f/voices_are_screaming_at_me_when_i_go_to_bed/). A couple of people asked whether it was the bed or the room that was the problem, and if I could try sleeping somewhere else.

Unfortunately, I live in a small apartment, so no guest room. But I did try putting my mattress on the floor of the bedroom — spoiler alert: it didn’t help.

I also tried leaving the bedroom door open at night. The voices still screamed. Maybe they sounded a bit more muffled, but they were still very much there. I’m not sure if there was a real difference or if it was just wishful thinking on my part.

I tried putting on music, but I couldn’t hear it over the voices. Then I tried white noise instead, but that was worse. It felt like the voices were trying to fight over it, like they wanted to be louder. After about five minutes, I tore off my headphones and just tried to sleep.

With the door open, I noticed a clear difference in temperature between the bedroom and the living room. I’ve always liked my bedroom cold, but *why* it’s that cold, I don’t know. It’s always been that way. But lying there and feeling the warmth from the rest of the apartment creeping in made me think.

It might be the window. I don’t dare open it, it’s loose in the frame, so maybe the night air seeps in through there.

Next, I tried dismantling the bed to move it into the living room. That turned into a two-hour wrestling match. I still don’t know how I ever managed to assemble that thing in the first place. I cursed, bled a little, and probably scared the neighbors with the noise. But eventually, I got it reassembled.

And, to my delight, it worked.

No screaming.

It wasn’t all that surprising. There aren’t any voices when I sleep on the couch either. But still… it made me happy.

Just the usual background voices now, chatting about dinner plans and having a surprisingly intense debate about running shoes.

Last night, after I moved the bed, I decided to clean the entire bedroom. With the bed gone, it felt easier somehow. When I vacuumed the carpet where it had stood, I noticed a whole colony of dust bunnies living under there. I think I saw some dog hair too, but that might’ve just come from petting my neighbor’s dog the other day.

I also found a long-lost sock under the bed. No idea why I hadn’t found it sooner, it was caked in dust, so I tossed it into the laundry basket. Or at least, I thought I did. When I went to do laundry earlier today, it was gone. So maybe I imagined the whole thing.

I’m moving next month, closer to work. Just a new apartment, nothing special. But I’ll admit, it’s not just the commute. I’m hoping that whatever is going on doesn't keep on happening when I'm out of here.

I really don’t know what else I can do… I’m looking forward to moving day.
