From the earliest memories of my childhood, a chilling prophecy haunted me – a recurring dream where a colossal airplane plummets from the sky, crashing right where I stand. 
These dreams, always ending in a blinding explosion, felt more like harbingers of doom than mere figments of imagination.I remember the first time I had the dream. I was only seven, and it felt so real that I woke up screaming. My parents, with comforting yet puzzled expressions, assured me it was just a nightmare. But deep down, I knew it was something more sinister – a premonition.As years passed, the dreams became a part of my life. The plane, its engines roaring in distress, would always find me, regardless of where I was in the dream. In fields, on streets, even in unknown territories, I was the target. And each time, I would be rooted to the spot, unable to escape my fate.This unshakable fear of a predetermined end started shaping my life. I avoided flying and stayed away from airports. 

Therapy, consultations with dream interpreters, and visits to psychics – I tried everything to break free from the grip of these nightmares, but to no avail.In my quest for answers, I stumbled upon various theories and stories. Some spoke of premonitions as warnings, others as inevitable events set in stone. The more I delved into these stories, the more I felt a connection with others who had experienced similar premonitions, yet no story mirrored mine precisely.Determined to escape this fate, I took control of my life in the most literal way. I chose a career that wouldn't require me to travel by air. I picked a place to live that was far away from any major airports. 

My life became a carefully constructed fortress, built to protect me from the sky's looming threat.Then, in my mid-twenties, something shifted. The dreams, which had become less frequent, suddenly stopped. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, with no sign of the airplane. It was an unexpected reprieve, and for the first time, I entertained the possibility that I had successfully altered my destiny.

Emboldened by this new sense of freedom, I began to venture further from my safe haven. I traveled by land, exploring new cities and landscapes, always keeping a vigilant eye on the sky. Life took on a new vibrancy, and I relished every moment, free from the shadow of my nightmares.But the relief was short-lived. 

On a quiet evening while visiting a friend in a distant town, the familiar hum of an airplane engine filled the air. My heart sank as I looked up to see a commercial airliner, its silhouette unmistakable against the twilight sky.In that moment, the dream came rushing back. The sense of impending doom, the roar of the engines, the inescapable descent – it all returned with a paralyzing clarity. I stood there, frozen, as the realization dawned on me. It wasn't over. The dream was a warning, a glimpse into a future I still couldn't escape.As the plane passed overhead, my mind raced with questions. Was this the moment? Was the prophecy about to fulfill itself? But then, just as quickly as it appeared, the plane vanished into the horizon, leaving me alone with my racing thoughts.That night, the dream returned with a vengeance, more vivid and terrifying than ever. The message was clear – I could run, I could hide, but I couldn't escape my fate. The plane, a harbinger of my end, would find me.

 It was only a matter of time.I woke up to a new day, filled with a resolve born from fear and acceptance. If my fate was sealed, then I would no longer live in its shadow. I decided to embrace life, to make the most of the time I had, whether it was days, months, or years.But deep down, I knew the truth. 

The plane from my dreams was out there, somewhere in the skies, waiting for the day when destiny would bring us together in one final, catastrophic moment.
