The first note showed up on my car windshield three months ago. 

It was just a piece of plain white paper, folded neatly under the wiper. At first, I thought it was just some stupid flyer, but when I unfolded it, there was only one line written in blocky, uneven handwriting.

**"I saw you smile today."**

I looked around the parking lot, but it was empty. My stomach churned as I crumpled the note and tossed it in the trash. 

The second note came two weeks later. This time, it was taped to my front door.

**"Blue looks good on you."**

I'd worn a blue sweater that day.

I told myself it was just some weird prank, but my hands were shaking as I locked every door and window in the house that night. 

The notes kept coming, always short, always unnervingly specific. 

**"You hum when you cook."**

**"I love the way you tuck your hair behind your ear."**

**"You forgot to lock the back door last night."**

That one made me vomit. 

I called the police, but they didn't take me seriously. "It's probably just a neighbour," the officer said. "Let us know if it escalates."

*If it escalates.* 

The next week, my dog, Roscoe, disappeared. I searched the neighbourhood for hours, calling his name until my throat was raw. Roscoe wasn't the type of dog to run away, he barely liked going on walks. The next morning though, I found another note on my doorstep. 

**"Roscoe was in the way."**

I broke down. I didn't leave the house for days, calling out of work and ignoring texts from friends. I wanted to pack up and leave, but I had nowhere to go. 

That's when the photos started. 

The first one was tucked into my mailbox. It was a picture of me, taken through my living room window while I watched TV. My face was illuminated by the screen, my expression relaxed, oblivious. 

The next photo was worse. 

It was of me sleeping. 

I could see myself curled up on my side, the blankets pulled halfway up my body. The angle was too close, too intimate. Whoever took it hadn't taken it from a distance using a telephoto lens. They'd been *inside* my room.

I called the police again, but they still didn't help.

"We don't have enough evidence," they said. "It's probably some kids playing a prank."

*A prank.*

Two nights ago, I heard footsteps in the hall. I locked my bedroom door and shoved a chair under the handle, clutching my phone and a kitchen knife. The footsteps stopped outside my door, and for hours, I listened to the sound of someone breathing. It was slow, steady and deliberate. 

Eventually, it faded. 

In the morning, I found scratched on the outside of the door. Deep, jagged marks, as if someone had been dragging a blade across the wood. 

Last night, I woke up to find a new note on my pillow. 

**"I WATCH YOU SLEEP."**

I didn't scream. I didn't run. I just sat there, frozen, my skin crawling as I stared at the words. 

This morning, I checked my phone. There were 47 new photos in my gallery. They were all of me, taken at different times, walking to my car, brushing my hair, sleeping. And in every photo, I wasn't alone. 

He was there in the background. A shadow just barely visible, a shape hiding in plain sight. 

I'm writing this now because I don't think I'll have another chance. He's here, somewhere in the house. I can hear the faint creak of floorboards, the soft rustle of fabric. 

The last note is sitting on my desk.

**"You should have smiled more."**
