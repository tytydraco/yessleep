A few weeks ago, I decided to visit my twin sister Alice in our remote home nestled in The mountains. I arrived at our quaint home and knocked on the door. My sister, Alice opened the door, and was quite shocked to see me because when I would visit, I’d mention beforehand I was coming over. She let me inside where my 8 year old niece, Annie was happily playing. When she saw me, she extended both her arms and ran in for a hug. So far everything was going nicely and I was planning to extend my stay for a few more days, that was until I had an experience I would consider unexplainable. 

After dinner, my sister went upstairs and prepared the guest room. Alice always had a guest room which was reserved for either me or my parents who would visit in our spare time. After a late night shower, I went to bed at around 11pm. Imagine my confusion when I woke up at 2am in the morning. I don't know why I was awake at this ungodly hour but I was irritated. I was about to go back to sleep when i heard it, laughter, sweet childlike laughter, it sounded like my niece. Confused, I got up and went to turn on the lights but it wasn’t turning on. “Great” I said to myself, there was a blackout and if I want to know who was making those noises, I have to be out there in the dark. 

I scurried around in the dark trying to find a source of light as my phone was dead. Conveniently, one of the drawers had candles and a lighter, I didn't find this weird as Alice would mention there are frequent blackouts in their area. I lit the candle, opened the door, and braced myself for what was hiding in the dark. I made my way listening to where the sounds were coming from, cautiously as I didnt want Alice to know I was awake and was casually wandering around her house. I made my way downstairs to where the sound was getting louder.

 “Boo!” A childish voice behind me spoke. I jumped and turned around to see “Annie?” I said in a confused tone. “Why are you awake at this hour?” I asserted. “Let’s play a game, Auntie” Annie said in a sheepish voice “Annie this is not the time to play games!” I spoke in a louder voice this time but she didn't react to what I said, Annie simply said “let’s begin”. Just then, she blew on the candle and everything went dark. 

I checked around my pockets trying to find the lighter I bought with me and re-lit the candle. I glanced around my surroundings then I saw it, something that made my blood run cold. On the floor were Annie’s clothes, as if she had vanished in the time it took for me to light my candle. I was getting this really off atmosphere telling me I shouldn’t be here. So I made my way upstairs and locked the door.I wasn’t getting that much sleep after whatever just happened, but I eventually dozed off.

I woke up at around 7 am and was certain everything that happened earlier was just a figment of my imagination. I was sure Alice wasn’t awake at this hour, so I made my way downstairs to cook breakfast for her. I thought of it as an apology if I unintentionally woke her up in the middle of the night. As I made my way to the kitchen, I noticed something that sent chills to my spine. Annie’s clothes were on the floor, the same ones she wore when I saw her last night. I was a bit shaken but I shrugged it off, picked up the clothes and left it in the laundry.

 As I was cooking, Alice peeped into the frame. “What’s all this for” She asked. “Just thought i’d cut you some slack and make breakfast for you and Annie” I said “Thanks?” Alice replied. I wasn’t ready to tell Alice what happened, so I made up a lie that there was a work emergency and I needed to go right away. As I was packing my things and getting ready to leave, Annie came up to me and wrapped me in a tight hug “Goodbye, Auntie” She said in an upsetting tone. The minute i was out of reach, I drove as fast as my car could go away from that place. I didn’t visit Alice a lot after that incident, I’m not really sure if I want to tell her, because even I wasn’t sure if what happened that night was real or not. All I can say after all this was that I’m never getting up late at night again.
