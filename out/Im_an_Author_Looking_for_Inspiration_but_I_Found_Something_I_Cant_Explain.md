I sit here, nursing the dregs of a now-warm pint of Golden cider, swirling it absent-mindedly while the pub around me sinks into the soft murmur of background noise. It’s gone flat. Sweet. Slightly metallic. I don’t mind.

What I do mind is the relentless echo of the last few days, looping over and over in my head. They’ve left me adrift—unmoored from everything familiar. Shaken something loose.

I came here for inspiration.

I think I found something else.

⸻

I’m a writer. Or I like to think I am. That worn-out stereotype: blocked, bitter, prone to staring out of windows and romanticising decay. Ideas come and go like birds on a wire. Sometimes they perch long enough to give me hope, but most of the time, they fly off the moment I reach for them. Nine times out of ten, I’m left blinking at a blank screen, frustrated, talentless, thirsty.

University did nothing to change that. If it had, maybe I’d be like my former classmates—writing young adult trilogies with film options or working cushy remote gigs as content creators for vapid media outlets. I saw one of them post the other day about how they’d been paid to write “15 actors who vanished after one season of Peaky blinders ,” and it got thirty thousand likes.

Thirty thousand.

And here I sit with a lukewarm pint and a blinking cursor for company.

⸻

The Bodmar Arms is the kind of pub you forget as soon as you leave. Perched on the outer bend of a coastal road, it’s a thirty-five minute drive to anywhere that might reasonably be called civilisation. The village it anchors isn’t even listed on some satnavs.

The pub floor is warped and stained in patches. Walls are crammed with dusty oddities: brass plaques, yellowed photos, signed rugby shirts, and that ever-present cricket bat over the bar that looks like it’s been used more for breaking up fights than scoring runs. There’s a peculiar picture near my usual table—one I keep staring at even though I don’t want to. A man and a woman smiling broadly, each gripping what looks like a dolphin between them. Only, it’s not a dolphin. Not really.

Its flesh is dark red, almost veiny. It has no eyes, no fins. Just a long, lipless mouth and rubbery skin like wet leather. I tell myself it’s some rare Amazonian species, but something about it makes my spine twitch.

Still—I digress.


I came here to get away. To write. To force something out of my tired, anxious brain. I arrived four days ago, checked into the tiny room upstairs, and planted myself in the corner booth beside the window. I opened my laptop with a flick of the lid and watched the cursor blink at me.

Mocking. Silent. Empty.

Outside, the sea was a blank stretch of grey, smudging into the horizon. Not a boat. Not a gull. Not even wind. Just a pair of buoys bobbing up and down like they were anchored to something trying to rise.

Even the woman on the beach—metal detector in hand—seemed to give up before she began. I watched her wave it once, twice, then sigh and walk back to her car. That kind of town.

Eventually, I shut the laptop with a slap, scraped my chair back, and wandered to the bar.


The stool I chose had once been upholstered in velvet, maybe red. Now it was threadbare and brown, the sponge beneath poking out in crusted, flaky lumps. I adjusted myself into some semblance of comfort.

The barman was in the back, watching Doctor Who on an ancient portable TV. I recognised the voice—Tom Baker—dripping sarcasm at a cyberman.

“Hello, mate,” I called, my voice overly bright with performative cheer. “What ciders have you got on tap?”

He sighed. Didn’t turn around.

“We’ve got  cider. Beer. Or wine,” he muttered, standing with the slowness of someone who’s had enough of all things human. He waddled over—short, round, and sour-looking—and climbed a little step behind the bar to meet my gaze.

“Right,” I said, after a pause. “Cider’ll do.”

I carried the pint back to my table and opened the laptop again, hoping—foolishly—that the cursor might have started writing in my absence.

Of course, it hadn’t.


I went to the loo, more out of frustration than need. When I returned, four young men had taken the table opposite mine. Each had a pint in hand, and they spoke with the lazy rhythm of friends who had long since exhausted the need for introductions.

I braced myself. I could smell the banter coming.

But instead of stories about wild nights or Tinder disasters, the one in the black hoodie leaned forward and asked:

“So lads, who’s got a tale to spin this evening?”

The others chuckled. One nudged another. After some lighthearted arguing, the one with thick neon-framed glasses leaned back and cleared his throat.

“All right, all right,” he said. “Here’s one for you. Mad one. Bear with me.”

He took a deliberate sip of his drink.


“So this lad—Luke—goes camping with his missus. Long-time couple. Childhood sweethearts. But things had been rocky. That night, big row. Massive. He finds out she’s been cheating on him. With his best mate.”

A low whistle came from one of the others.

“Oooo , bitch.”

“Yeah. So he storms off. Heads toward the cliffs to get some air. She follows, all apologetic. Says it meant nothing. Hugs him. Says she loves him.”

He pauses. Smiles grimly.

“Then—BANG. Knife in the back.”

The table jumps. Even I flinch.

“She pushes him. Over the edge. He falls. Sees stars spinning. Cold wind in his ears. Then—nothing. Just the sea. And silence.”

The table is silent too.

I glance at my laptop. Open it slowly. The cursor is still blinking, but suddenly it doesn’t seem quite so cruel.


The tale haunted me through the night. It wasn’t just the twist—it was the way he told it. Earnest. Measured. As if he’d lived it.

I took the bones of it and spun them into a short novella. Just a rough one. Posted it anonymously to a writing forum I used to lurk on. “Inspired by a tale overheard in a seaside pub,” I wrote. Within hours, it started gaining traction. Comments. Shares. Even a message from an old uni mate: “Mate, this is unreal. You finally found your voice.”

It felt like being seen for the first time in years.

And so—of course—I went back.


Day two. Same table. Same pint , I opened my laptop and waited.

Sure enough, the group arrived—minus the storyteller from the previous night.

No one acknowledged his absence.

I didn’t care.

The lad with the shaved head and calm eyes took the lead this time.

“This one’s weird,” he said. “But bear with me.”

He leaned forward, voice soft.


“Sam. That’s the guy’s name. Out on a boat with a couple of mates. Sam’s into boating. Takes it seriously. The others, not so much. They’re pissing about. He doesn’t mind—just wants everyone to be safe.

“Then a wave hits. Big one. One of them falls in. Sam jumps in after him—instinct, no hesitation. Gets him back to the boat. Other mate pulls him aboard. But Sam’s not wearing a life jacket.

“He starts struggling. Arms flailing. Then—something grabs him.

“Not water. Not seaweed.

“A hand.

“Big. Cold. Clawed.”

He pauses.

“It pulls. Slowly. Not yanking. Like it knows it’s won.”

I sit, transfixed.

“Sam looks down. Nothing but grey. But he can feel it. Wrapping round his leg. Not knowing if this was real or a figment of imagination in these last fleeting moments Pulling further and further down .And then… the cold becomes warmth. Like a blanket. Like sleep. And Sam’s gone.”


I wrote all night. Changed the names. Added some ambiguity. Kept the clawed hand.

This one went viral.

People messaged to say how it got under their skin. Asked when the full novel was coming.

I told myself I was only borrowing the tales. Honouring them. That I was transforming pub chat into art.

But really—I was feeding.


Day three. Only two lads now. The one in the hoodie, and the quiet one with the pale eyes.

They sat in silence. No pints. No laughter.

Then the hooded one said: “Tell me. What is your tale?”

The quiet lad stammered. “I… I don’t know. I don’t know anything.”

“Then find one,” the hooded figure said. “Know the story. Return when you are ready.”

The lad left.

And then—for the first time—the hooded one turned to me.

I didn’t breathe.

He stared. Expressionless.

Then said, simply:

“Sometimes, reality is more compelling than fantasy.”

He stood and walked out.



I stayed long after closing. Couldn’t move.

Eventually, the barman waddled over.

“We’re shut.”

I looked up. “Those lads—who are they? Come in every night, sit over there. You must’ve seen them.”

He frowned.

“You’ve been the only one here most nights. You and the couple in the corner.”

I laughed. But he didn’t.

His face remained blank.

No trace of irony.

No hint of a joke.

⸻

This morning, I returned again.

The table by the window—their table—was occupied.

An older couple sat there, heads bowed over an urn. The woman clutched a tissue. The man stared at nothing.

I walked over, slow. Unsure why.

“I’m sorry for your loss,” I said gently.

The woman looked up. Her face crumpled.

“Thanks, love,” she said. “Our Luke. He used to come here with his mates. Loved this place.”

I felt the blood drain from my face.

She sniffled. “He—he died camping. Fell. Off the cliffs.”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t.


The door creaks open.

The lad in the black hoodie steps in.

But this time, he’s not alone.

A new group trails behind him. Older. Quieter. Faces pinched and pale.

They sit.

He doesn’t look at me. Doesn’t need to.

I open my laptop.

The cursor blinks.

A story waits.

And I will write it.
