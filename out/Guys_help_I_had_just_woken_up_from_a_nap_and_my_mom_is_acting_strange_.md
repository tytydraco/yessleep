I had just got home from school. Being in middle school is very exhausting and it was a cool rainy day in the middle of October. A day perfect for taking a nap, especially an after school nap, the type of nap that just simply… hits different. 

“Hey mom.” I say, waving to her. “Hello honey, how was school today?” 

“Fine, I guess. Same old thing. You know how it is. Where is dad at?”

“He is still at work sweetie.” “Oh, I thought he got off at 3:40. It’s 4:00 right now.”

“He decided to stay a little bit longer at work to make up for the time he lost when he was sick last week.” 

“Oh, ok. That’s right, I forgot about that.” “Anyways, I am gonna take a little nap and then do my homework after since I am very tired right now. I love you mom.” 

“Love you too honey.” She says in a voice so amazing and loving that I felt warm inside. 

Walking up my creaky wooden stairs to my room, I open the door and set my backpack down on my floor. Hopping onto my bed, I close my eyes and fall into a dream.

In this dream, I was flying in the sky (a very typical and common and stereotypical type of dream that I bet everyone has had at least once before in their life). 

I remember the sky being a orangish colour with bright pink clouds that resembled cotton candy. I was riding a horse and was flying around, just enjoying life in my own imagination of being a growing kid. 

Then suddenly the horse started making a very creepy noise. A loud demonic neigh. 

The horses head fell off and looked at me with bright red glowing eyes. 

Suddenly I fell out of the sky and everything became black from there and I woke up in fear. Panting and scared I noticed I had peed my bed and was sweating profusely. 

Looking at the time on my clock, I saw that it displayed…

10:18 PM!!!!

“I had been asleep for… 5 and a half hours!” I whispered in shock. 

I then decided to get out of bed and get myself some water. Going down those damn creaking stairs again. 

That’s when something strange happened. 
 

Something, real, real, strange.

“Honey. Is that you? Help me honey? Please?!” 

It was…

My mom?

It was HER voice! 

It sounded muffled. 

And it was coming from behind the walls. 

“Mom what are you doing up there? Is everything ok?”

“Your father wants me to make sure you are being a good boy today!” 

She screamed out with a demonic roar at the end. Laughing maniacally.

“Mom, you are scaring me. Stop!” I screamed back in fear and just straight confusion to be honest with you. 

“Whoever said I was your mom?” She replied. 

Then there she was. Coming from the corner. 

On…

ALL FOURS. 

Hair in her face. 

Mouth open, laughing hysterically and evil! 

“Honey, dad told me that he will be staying even longer at work today!” She said with a bloody grin on her face barely being able to be seen behind her hair covering her face. 

In fear, I ran down the stairs and tripped on something. 

Looking back at what I tripped on, I gasped in total shock and disbelief as to what I saw. 

It was my

DAD!

His eyes had maggots crawling in them, his ears were cut off and his stomach was ripped open. 

“Hahahahahahahh.” The lady from above made out. 

This IS not my fucking mom! 

But if she isn’t…

WHO IS THIS LADY AND WHERE IS MY MOM? 

Is this thing a skinwalker? A demon? A doppleganger? An alien? Or just simply a crazy murderer? 

I GUESS WE WILLL NEVER…
