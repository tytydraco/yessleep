The king of fruits, many can’t stand its foul smell but some enjoy eating it. If you are part of the latter, just an advice that might spare your life… DON’T EVER BUY PLASTIC-WRAPPED DURIANS.

I have this acquaintance of mine, let’s call him Jeff. An active young public servant that has been a part of numerous organizations doing community projects. The first time I met him was during a tree-planting activity when I was still a sophomore. I don’t really have the genuine compassion of planting mangroves and praying for them to grow. I just joined because of a school requirement.

But Jeff is different, he has this bright aura around him and it shows that he loves the life of service. He talks with a contagious smile and is surrounded by peers. He stands out, hence why I noticed him. His face was not familiar then so I thought he was from a different school. I didn’t know anything about him other than this, not even his name… Not until we meet again in the first week of December.

To my surprise, our place is the next stop for Jeff’s team. I live on the outskirts of town, it is extremely far from the city proper. It is rural-like in this location; there are rough roads through a thicket of bushes and trees, and also a nearby beach. Apparently, their next project is a coastal cleanup and our sitio is one of the options. He is the sole representative to explore the area. He approached our purok leader and just because I live next door, my introverted self ended up being his tour guide. 

The local beach is near but we are not living on the seaside. It’s about a 3-minute walk if you use the shortcut that only the residents of this place know, hence why he needed an assistant. There was an awkward atmosphere between the two of us. After a casual introduction, he told me stories about himself, his team, their goals, and whatnot, while we were walking. He was trying to make a conversation. I, on the other hand, was so focused on clearing our path. Holding tree branches blocking our way and trying not to step on the muddy soil. 


“One left turn and we’re there.” I uttered. “You will notice soon that we’re stepping on the sand.”


“Great! Never been on a beach since the lockdown so this excites me,” he replied. “By the way, thank you. We’ve been crossing walls and narrow roads I couldn’t remember. I will surely get lost without a guide.”


I responded with a smile then we continued. It is complicated to explain the route going to the beach but that one final left turn we took led to a footbridge made of a series of huge coconut lumbers. This connects to the main entrance of the shore. As soon as we reached the seaside, he started roaming around while I waited on a makeshift seat at the end of the bridge. 

It took him over an hour before he finally got back. Just like how I first noticed him, he was again exuding a positive and lively aura like a toddler getting new toys. He shared that he got to know some residents and interviewed a few. It seemed like that coast could be their next project. While he's busy sharing this to me, I saw something seeping through the right pocket of his backpack. I was looking at it intently even my brows furrowed.

Jeff might have noticed this as he suddenly diverted his words. “Oh right! I got these at a discounted price. Aling Neneng sells it, a very kind woman. She kinda reminds me of my grandma, she even offered me water and food.”


He took it out and showed me. There were three fleshed durian seeds wrapped in a transparent plastic bag. It looks delicious with its yellow and smooth texture. It smells good as well. 


“I was about to accept the food she offers but then I thought that I shouldn’t keep you waiting, so I decided to buy this as a little support to Aling Neneng’s business and also as a sign of gratitude. Here.” Jeff handed it to me.


I did not respond right away, I was lost in my thoughts. Those durians made me recall an old belief. My parents always remind me not to buy ready-to-go durians that some vendors sell. They said that these durians might be “dinuraan”. The root word “dura” literally translates to “spit”. It is a common fact that whenever you buy durian or any other fruit, you must see how the vendor cleans and opens it before they give it to you. 

They said that some vendors spit on the fruit they sell before they wrap it up. They will then put some spell on it making those who consume it their ‘loyal customer.’ Have you ever heard of a belief that if you spit on the food of your pets, then they will be more loving and obedient? It’s like that, but with humans. 

I don't believe this because it feels like judging the small vendors. But honestly speaking, I couldn’t accept Jeff’s offer. Not because of this old belief, but mainly due to hygienic reasons. If I were there with him at that time and witnessed how Aling Neneng chopped off the durian and put it on the plastic, then I would definitely devour it. But I wasn’t and I have trust issues with the man.


“No, thank you. I’m allergic to durians.” I answered mindlessly. This is one of the crappiest lies I’ve made in my entire life. 


I do feel bad about how I responded because it made Jeff silent for some time, which is unusual. But still, he just smiled and put the durians right back on where he placed them saying that he’ll keep them for himself. 

Once again, I assisted him in getting back to the main road where he could fetch a tricycle on his way home.

Yet our paths crossed again yesterday morning. 

I was casually walking when I saw a familiar figure. A pale-skinned thin man wearing jeans and an oversized shirt, who has a very good posture despite carrying a huge black backpack. I was about to turn my back but I had to buy bread at that bakery next to where he is standing. 

I didn’t have a choice but to move forward, or else, there's no pandesal for breakfast. I continued striding until eventually, he called me.


“Hey ****!” He greeted me while waving his hand.


“Hey… Jeff.” I awkwardly uttered.


I stopped in front of him. As I got a closer look at him, he seemed skinnier.


“I saw you from a mile away. I bet it was you and I was indeed right.” 


“Yeah, you too! I recognized you from afar.” I said while forcing a smile. 


He was maintaining eye contact but I was distracted. My sight was diverted to his bag, the bottom seemed soaking wet. There was also some sort of smell. It’s reeking all over the place. I looked around to track where that pungent odor came from. It smelled rotten.

Then an idea came into my mind. The foul smell might have come from a bunch of trash.


“Is today the day for coastal cleanup?” I asked to feed my curiosity.


“Ah no.” He quickly responded. “We will do it on the third week, but on a coast nearer to the city. We are tight on budget. We chose it over this place so that we can accommodate the transport costs of all the volunteers.”


“I see." I was weirded out. "What brings you here, then?” 


“My mom is craving some Durian. I bought a bunch last time, she loved it and is asking for more.”


“Oh ok.” I was so confused. Did I hear that right? To buy durians in such a secluded place? At this time of the month?


“Wait... Have you been coming here lately?”


He nodded indicating that I was right. “I’ve been coming here for weeks now. Even last Christmas. I always buy durian from Aling Neneng”


My smile gradually faded as I started to feel worried. I pinched my nose, that smell was really something.


“So… you are going to the beach today?”


“Not anymore, I've been there.”
