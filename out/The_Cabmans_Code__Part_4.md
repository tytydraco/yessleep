As if stepping into a vision, my eyes opened, and I found my hands gripping the wheel of a filthy cab. The cracked leather seats were worn and stained, seemingly from years of neglect. The car reeked of stale coffee and some sort of strong, chemical stench that burned my nostrils.

The headlights pierced the darkness as I pulled up to an apartment stoop at a dimly lit street corner. Panic gripped me as I realized I was driving, but the horrifying truth became clear… I wasn’t in control. My hands moved on their own, like I was trapped in a cutscene from a first-person video game, helpless to do anything but watch as the scene played out.

I turned to my reflection in the rearview mirror. The face staring back at me wasn’t mine at all. It was grotesque and unkempt, with sunken eyes, a scruffy beard, and a foul grin. He wore a jet-black flat cap and a tattered peacoat, his expression cold and calculating. Looking into those horrible eyes, I realized this was no ordinary cab driver. He was a monster, prowling the shadowy streets, waiting for his next helpless victim.

I stepped out of the car, the air heavy and damp, as if an impending storm were brewing nearby. I slowly circled the rusty, beat-up 1989 Ford Crown Victoria, its paint peeling like flakes of dried skin. The smell of cheap gasoline mingled with the humid night air. As I rounded the back, I stopped dead in my tracks at the sight of the vanity license plate: CABMAN. My heart sank into my stomach, but before I could fully grasp what I was seeing, I found myself walking up the steps of the darkened stoop and knocking on the door.

I knocked again, searching my surroundings for any signs of life. There was no answer, just the sound of leaves rustling as the wind picked up. Reaching for the handle, I found the door was locked. After looking around once more, I began fidgeting with the lock. I’d never tried to break into a house before, but I could tell in my current state that I had done this before. Even so, my attempts were futile.

I returned to the car, every step I took was not my own, my mind pleaded for control as I opened the trunk; my eyes once again drawn to the haunting license plate. Inside, the trunk was lined with old newspapers dated September 14th, 1999. On top of the faded pages were a few feet of rope, a crowbar, and a plastic bag containing what looked like duct tape and pruning shears. My hand lingered over the bag for a moment, but I grabbed the crowbar instead and headed back to the door.

This time, I wedged the flat end of the crowbar between the door frame and the door, prying it open to create a gap. Rocking the crowbar back and forth, I was able to widen the opening. Without hesitation, my body slammed into the door, lurching back as the force hurled splintered pieces of wood and caused the latch or bolt mechanism to break. The hinges creaked as the door swung open, revealing nothing but blackness. I peered inside, nervously awaiting what might lie ahead, the crowbar heavy in my hand. A small bit of light crept in from outside as I stepped through the door into a hallway next to some stairs. My mind continued to fight against the involuntary movements I made, trying to comprehend the horrific details of what led me here, unsure about the house, but this body moved with eerie familiarity.

In the silence, I heard the faint creaking of footsteps on old floorboards coming from somewhere upstairs. Flashes of memories began to flood my mind, a young girl’s terrified face, her desperate pleas for mercy, and the tension-fueled resolve that had driven me to this very house. I could feel the sinister intentions that Cabman had in mind, leaving me both disgusted and entranced.

The memories became clearer, solidifying in my mind with vivid detail. I saw myself driving that filthy cab late at night, the dense fog made it hard to see anything beyond the headlights. A dilapidated signpost appeared through the haze; the faded lettering spelled out 'Service Road.' Instinctively, I pulled onto the broken pavement, the tires crunching against loose gravel. A woman’s voice broke the silence from the backseat, her tone filled with agitation. “This isn’t the right way… I said Hamilton Avenue!” she protested. “This way is quicker,” I slurred, my tone flat, devoid of any real emotion. “There was an accident up the road when I dropped someone off earlier.” It felt strange as the words escaped my lips, my mouth moved, but I wasn’t in control of what was said. The voice didn’t belong to me, yet it came from my mouth, I was still trapped watching through Cabman’s eyes.

The car continued down the desolate road, the woman’s protests growing more forceful. My body remained rigid, moving robotically as I blindly followed the twisting path. We rounded a sharp curve and neared the edge of a massive ravine, where only a rickety, old guardrail stood between us and the jagged rocks below.

The car slowed to a halt at the cliff’s edge, the idling engine and the distant chirp of crickets were the only sounds breaking through the silence. A wave of fear washed over me as I felt the evil intentions of Cabman’s heart rising within me. The woman’s voice trembled as she asked, “Why are we stopping here?” I remained silent, ignoring her question as my hand moved to the door handle. I stepped out of the cab, moving with a purpose that wasn’t my own. I knew exactly where I was headed, feeling myself being pulled to the trunk. My thoughts flashed to the pruning shears I’d seen earlier, and everything was starting to make sense.

The trunk lid opened, revealing the rope and the plastic bag with the duct tape and pruning shears. There was no sign of the crowbar, but the scene was eerily familiar. I grabbed the rope and pruning shears, then walked back to the rear car door. As I approached, the woman shoved the door open, slamming it into me as she scrambled out of the car.

“What is going on!?” she screamed hysterically. “What are you doing back here?”

I remained silent, my body moving towards her with a relentless determination. She backed away, her chest heaving with each panicked breath. Wrapping the rope around my left arm, I picked up my pace, narrowing the distance between us.

I pulled the pruning shears from the bag, gripping them tightly in my right hand. She turned to run, her panicked breaths turning into shallow gasps.

“Stay back!” she shouted, her voice trembling with fear.

My body didn’t stop. Words that weren’t mine spilled from my mouth. “Give me your money and anything valuable, and I won’t have to hurt you.”

She clutched her bag tighter, shaking her head. “Stay away from me! Please, just let me go!”

I lunged forward, feeling Cabman’s excitement at the chance to fight. I grabbed at her arm, swinging the shears violently. She screamed, twisting to break free from my grasp, but in the struggle, the shears plunged into her forearm, leaving a shallow cut but nothing that would be fatal. She shrieked in pain, clutching the wound as tears streamed down her face.

“Give me the bag!” I barked, holding the shears up. The words felt foreign, as though Cabman’s will was speaking through me.

She shuddered, reaching for the wound to stop the bleeding. While she was preoccupied, I reached for her purse again, but she twisted to avoid my advances. Still gripping her arm, I forced her to the ground. She cried out, struggling against me. My hand, moving on its own, grabbed her left hand and lifted the shears. A large, luminous engagement ring adorned her finger, the expensive diamond gemstone glittering even in the low light with each desperate move of her hand.

“I’ll happily take this ring instead!” I hissed. Her sobbing grew louder as she writhed beneath me. “Do you want to lose a finger!?”

“Please, stop… please!” she begged, her voice cracking.

I could feel her squirming and twisting beneath me, kicking her feet violently in an attempt to break free. As she bucked, one of her legs slipped free. She pulled it into her chest and kicked with all her remaining strength, hitting me hard in the chest. I felt the breath leave my lungs as I fell back, the shears slipping from my grasp. She scrambled to her feet, holding her bleeding arm, and fleeing toward the tree line.

Seemingly unfazed, I stumbled after her, the rope still in my grip. The fog was thick, but I could hear her desperate sobs and the pounding of her footsteps. She ran, trembling, into the woods near the guardrail, disappearing into the darkness. I pursued her relentlessly, adrenaline fueling my every step as I struggled to regain my breath.

The woods were completely shrouded in darkness from the thick fog. I turned and caught a faint glimpse of the cab’s headlights, barely cutting through the dense haze several yards away. The rustling of leaves and the crunch of the woman’s frantic footsteps echoed through the trees, disorienting me. I tripped on a fallen tree branch and tumbled down the hill. As I struggled to my feet, my pulse pounding in my ears, I spotted the forest’s edge and a clearing leading to the main road.

Suddenly, she burst out from behind a tree, hurling herself off the embankment toward the road below. I stumbled after her, Cabman’s rage fueling every step. In the distance, I heard a car engine approaching. I knew I only had seconds to act, and I could feel the dreadful panic that consumed Cabman as if it were my own. Instinctively, I pulled the rope from around my arm and hurled it toward the fleeing woman. It struck her, wrapping around her shoulder and causing her to waver, yet she managed to stay upright. I yanked hard, trying to drag her down, reeling in the rope and tightening it toward her throat. She pushed back against it in a desperate attempt to free herself, but I closed the distance, wrapping my arms around her waist as she struggled.

Headlights sliced through the fog, burning into my eye sockets like two stars exploding in the night sky. Blinded and disoriented, I froze for a moment in the beam’s reflection. She wasted no time, lunging back against me, forcing me to release my grip and propelling herself out of the car’s path. The car drew closer, and the headlights grew brighter, searing into my vision. I didn’t have the time or perception to brace for the impact. The car hit me with such intense force that it sent me flying. I landed hard on the cold pavement, my eyes shutting as the world around me dissolved. When I opened them, I was back in the house I’d been breaking into, still trapped in Cabman’s body.
