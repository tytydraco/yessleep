*Ok. I’m finally ready to talk about what led to me being locked up here. Hopefully, this last message will serve as a warning. If you haven’t already, please check out the first three transmissions above before reading further.*   


  
“So the core is a demon?” I would’ve laughed were it not for the Hell-on-Earth I'd just witnessed in the ventilation room. 

  
“That’s our best guess, given the entity’s nature,” Yumiko said. She stared at a tablet computer, reading damage reports as she led us deeper into the power plant. We passed through rooms full of arcane equipment, giant metal vats bubbling over with blue liquid, jet black turbines, walls of glowing occult symbology. The further we went, the less everything looked like a power plant, and the more it started to resemble a futuristic temple.

  
Yumiko radioed a bunch of people as we walked. She directed a team to go and “fetch” Colton. He was still an icicle sitting in the ventilation room. Yumiko claimed they were going to take him to the ICU to “thaw out.” She didn’t sound hopeful when she said this, however. Another team was sent to search for Abby.  

  
“How likely is it they’ll find her alive?” I asked. 

  
“They’ll do everything they can,” Yumiko said.

  
*That sounds unlikely.* 

  
“Why am I here?” 

  
“Someone will explain when we reach the core.” That was all Yumiko said on the matter before radioing more employees. I thought of asking more questions, but she was clearly too busy. 

  
Yumiko had given me a hazmat suit to wear, complete with the Frog Hollow logo. It was that strange circuit board symbol with a grotesque human stick figure in its center that I now assumed was the demon “Ash." The suit was bulky, clearly meant for someone a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier than myself. But it was high quality material and perfectly sealed. 

  
We saw dozens more workers as we continued onward. All of them wore hazmats. And all of them carried weapons, mostly assault rifles and handguns. But a few carried those strange ice-thrower weapons that had frozen Colton. I overheard Yumiko refer to the specialized guns as “cryo-lances.” She directed some of the cryo-lancers to secure the station’s perimeter, while others came with us, serving as our guards. 

  
“This is it,” Yumiko said. We'd reached a large stairwell with only one way to go: Down.

  
“Stay behind the cryo-lancers. They need to check the area first.” 

  
“Check for what?” 

  
Yumiko didn’t answer. 

  
We descended six flights until we reached the bottom of the stairwell. It led to a tunnel deep underground. The sector was hewn out of limestone, like the interior of an old mine. There were occult symbols everywhere, carved into the ceiling, the walls, even the rocky floor. It was like someone had written a massive protection spell. At the end of the tunnel was a cavern containing a giant metal box. Various wires and tubes sprouted from its sides, leading up to the ceiling and, presumably, the rest of the power station. 

  
“Is that the core?” 

  
"Yes."

  
There were numerous burn marks along the core’s metal edges, as if a raging inferno had threatened to burst out of it. Long strings of glowing fungus grew across its polished steel surface. The same kind of fungus I’d seen in the drains earlier and on the worker in the ICU. Clearly, the growths were a sign of the demon’s presence. 

  
“Ice those tendrils,” Yumiko told the cryo-lancers. They lifted their bulky weapons, spraying icy smoke on the core. The fungus strings quickly froze and flaked off of its metal exterior. 

  
I was told to stay back near the cavern entrance while the hazmats finished their “cleaning.” Seeing the fungus tendrils freeze into icy dust made me wonder if the same thing would happen to Colton when they finally thawed him out. My hope for his survival was dropping by the second. 

  
Yumiko glanced back. “What the Hell are you doing?” She yelled at the guards by my side. “Get him prepped for the transmission. We’re almost done here.” 

  
“Yes ma’am.” The guards ushered me over to a computer station in a back corner of the cavern. The area was connected to the plant’s core via a series of wires taped to the floor. Scientists worked feverishly at a giant computer terminal with dozens of computer screens. Most of them flashed warnings in red letters: CONTAINMENT BREACH. MELTDOWN IMMINENT. Everyone was laser focused on their work. 

  
The lead scientist scoffed when she saw me. “Why is he here?”

  
“He’s our best chance at communication,” Yumiko said, coming over. “This boy survived close proximity with one of the thralls. His mind’s still intact.” 

  
*Thrall? What was that? Were they talking about Colton?* 

  
“What’s going on?” I asked. 

  
No one answered. One of the guards held my shoulder, as if making sure I wouldn’t bolt out of the cavern. 

  
“What about the other techno-priests?” The lead scientist asked. She kept working at her computer as she talked, feverishly typing out code.

  
“Out of commission,” Yumiko said.

  
“All of them?”

  
“There are others on the way, but they won’t be here for another four hours. Minimum. We need to patch in now.” 

  
The lead scientist stopped for a moment, glancing at me. “He’s not even trained.” 

  
“Then we’ll be quick, far below the limit,” Yumiko said. “Set a timer for 90 seconds. We just need to calm it down.” 

  
“Will someone please tell me what the fuck’s going on?” I was shocked by the tone of my voice.  

  
Everyone fell silent, staring at me. There was an awkward beat. Then—

  
“Just prep him,” Yumiko told the lead scientist. “Before we have another breach.” With that, she left the station, returning to the cryo-lancers who were finishing cleaning the core.  

  
The lead scientist sighed as she approached me. A tag on her hazmat said she was named SOPHIE. “You can let go of him,” Sophie told the guard holding my shoulder. “We’ll take it from here.”

  
I recognized Sophie’s voice. This was the woman who led me through the decontamination process earlier, right after the bombing. The one with the soft, gentle tone.   

  
“Look, whatever this is, if you think it’s too risky, I’m more than fine leaving,” I said. “I don’t want to be here.”

  
“I know,” Sophie said. “And I’m sorry, but we have to try. You’re Jason, right?”

  
“Y-yes.”

  
“My name’s Sophie. I’m a comms specialist at Frog Hollow. Now Jason, I’m going to need you to be very brave for me. Ok? What you’re about to do could save many lives. The whole power plant and beyond.” 

  
“Ok.”

  
Sophie led me to a windowless metal pod at the back of the computer station. It was about the size of an SUV. Various wires connected it to the computer terminal. “I’m going in there?” 

  
“Yes. You’ll be fine. I’m going in with you. I’ll be right beside you.” 

  
Once we were sealed inside, Sophie and I removed our hazmats. The pod was crammed with medical equipment. An articulated chair lay in its center, like the kind you’d find in a dentist’s office. It was almost fully reclined. Dozens of electrodes were attached to its sides. Sophie motioned to the chair. “Lie down here.” 

  
“What is this?” My whole body was shaking as I got into the chair. I sank deep into its plush leather cushions. 

  
“We’re going to patch you into the plant’s core,” Sophie said. “This pod has highly specialized receptors. They can connect a human consciousness with Ash.”

  
 “What? No— I— I don’t wanna talk to what’s in there…” 

  
“I know. I’m sorry.” Sophie placed my right finger into a pulse oximeter. Then, she began attaching the electrodes to my forehead and scalp using a cold gel. “But you won’t have to say anything. All I need for you to do is relax and keep your mind open. We’ll do all the communication on our end.” 

  
“Then why don’t you sit in this chair?” 

  
“It’s not that simple,” Sophie said. “We need a human conduit who’s had contact with the demon. You had direct contact with a thrall, someone under Ash’s control.”

  
“Colton.”

  
“Yes.” 

  
“Is he going to be alright?” 

  
“Honestly… I don’t know.” Sophie finished placing the electrodes on my body. My scalp tingled. “Normally, we’d use someone specially trained for this kind of thing. Someone who has experienced small, regular doses of demonic contact while entering a meditative state.”

  
“You mean the techno-priests?”

  
“Yes.”  


  
I couldn’t believe such a job really existed. In my mind, I pictured someone in flowing robes embroidered with the circuit board logo. I felt I had to ask the next question, though I dreaded its answer. “What did Yumiko mean when she said the techno-priests were… ‘out of commission.’” 

    
Sophie checked a heart monitor nearby. It tracked my vital signs. “They're too tired to sit in this chair,” she said. Her voice was slightly different. Less certain. She was lying. BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. 

  
“Your heart rate’s elevated, Jason.”

  
*Well, duh. I’m fucking terrified.* “Can you get someone else to do this? Please?” I asked. 

  
“I’m sorry, Jason,” Sophie said. “The transmission will feel strange, but it will only last a minute. And I’ll be right by your side the whole time, in case anything bad happens. Ok?” She looked at me with a soft expression, her crystal blue eyes watering.

  
*She’s fucking terrified too.* “Ok.” 

  
Sophie pressed an intercom button inside the pod. “We’re clear.” She checked my vitals one more time, then said: “Now lie back and relax… It’ll be over before you know it.”  

  
I smirked. *Famous last words.* Sophie pulled a lever and the tingling in my scalp intensified. Then I felt a wave of heat spread across my head, like my hair was on fire. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. My jaw wouldn’t open. My arms and legs wouldn’t move. I was paralyzed. It was like a waking nightmare. And then things got really, really strange…

  
*I was standing in a boggy swamp, my legs frozen in place. Giant insects crowded the humid air. There were moss-covered trees and dark brown water in all directions. Booming animal calls echoed in the distance. The noises were loud and resonant. They reminded me of giant birds. A huge creature with red and green pebbled skin lumbered through the murky surroundings on four stout legs. It was headed my way. It took me a moment to realize what it was… My eyes widened in fear and awe.*    


  
*It was a dinosaur, one of those massive but docile herbivores I’d seen in countless science documentaries. Only this one was real. I could smell its musky order, feel the vibration of its thunderous footsteps. Dream or nightmare, this was the most incredible sight I’d ever witnessed. Until something even more magnificent surpassed it…* 

  
*A prismatic light passed by overhead. I looked up and saw an ethereal creature floating through the treetops. Its iridescent body was so faint it took me a moment to realize it was an actual being and not just a trick of the light. The creature resembled a translucent manta ray, hovering over the swamp. The nearby dino paid it no attention. I felt like I was the only one who could see the spirit. It gazed down at me with dozens of shiny eyes, shining like tiny stars. As it did, I heard a soft voice in my head, as gentle as a summer breeze…* 

  
***Hello Jason.***

  
***You know my name?***

  
***I’m in your mind. And you are in mine.*** 

  
*Ash. For some reason, I didn’t feel any fear. The being seemed to radiate calmness. I felt like I could stand in that swamp for years.* ***Where am I?*** 

  
***My past.***

  
*A sudden bright flash overtook the swamp. I didn’t move from my spot, but now I was standing in a frozen wasteland, riddled with ash and snow. The sky was covered in thick dark clouds, blocking out almost all sunlight. But still, the spirit hovered above. It flapped its mighty “wings” and moved the clouds, allowing for warm sunlight to reach the ground. A tiny plant sprouted in the sunlit patch.*   

  
***I've watched over this plot of Earth for longer than you could ever comprehend.*** 

  
*Another flash…*

  
*I was standing on an icy tundra. Wooly mammoths wandered in the distance. They followed the spirit. It was leading them to a bubbling stream nearby.*  

  
*Another flash…*

  
*I was in a temperate rainforest full of huge trees and colorful fungus. A bonfire glowed nearby. People in animal furs danced around the flames, chanting in strange tongues and pointing towards the glowing spirit above them.*  

  
*Another flash…*

  
*I stood at the bottom of a huge black pit. Mining excavators dug deeper and deeper into the earth. I looked around for the spirit. But it was no longer there. There was nothing living in sight. Just dirt and machines.*

    
***Until I was wrenched from it.***

  
*DING! The excavator’s bucket struck something hard. The machine readjusted around the buried object, digging at its sides. Then, it lifted out a giant chunk of glowing stone. It had the same shimmery iridescence as the floating spirit I saw earlier. The stone radiated tremendous energy. It washed over the excavator in tremendous waves, causing the machine’s computers to short out.* 

  
*Another flash…*

  
*I was inside a steel box alongside the glowing stone. Blasts of fire hit the stone from tubes up above, causing the object to release more and more energy.*

  
***They realized I could provide them with boundless energy. But with each ounce siphoned off, I lost more and more of myself…***  

  
*In the corner, I saw the spirit. Once a shimmering creature of beauty, it now resembled a cancerous blob of bubbling tar. Its tiny star eyes had turned into fiery coals. They burned red. Blood red. Rage red. I felt its rage surging through me. Burning up my soul.*  


  
***There’s a button on the computer terminal outside your pod. It’s big and red. You can’t miss it.***

  
*One more BIG flash and…*

  
I opened my eyes, blinking away tears. Everything was bright and blurry. Someone stood over me. “Jason? JASON?” 

  
It was Sophie. She’d just sprayed something into my lungs with a large inhaler. I gasped myself awake, heart pounding. “Wha— What?” I was back in the pod. My scalp burned. Sophie had ripped the electrodes off of my head, taking some of my hair with them. “What happened?”

  
“You went into convulsions for a few seconds when I switched on the transceiver,” Sophie said. “I had to do a hard abort or you would’ve entered a coma. Sorry about the spray. The adrenaline’s just to pull you out.” 

   
“But… I was speaking to it,” I said.

  
“That’s not possible,” Sophie said. “We hadn’t even established a full connection yet.”

  
“It was…” I wanted to say beautiful. Then terrifying. Then enraging. “I saw it. I saw Ash.” 

  
“You were hallucinating.” Sophie helped me back into my hazmat and then she suited up herself. The pod door unsealed with a pneumatic hiss. We stepped out. 

  
“What the fuck happened?” Yumiko was waiting for us outside. She looked pissed. 

  
“He started seizing immediately,” Sophie said. 

  
“Could he still establish a connection?” 

  
“I’m not going to kill him just so we can get a baseline for what’s going on in there.” 

  
“We could all die if we don’t know what it’s thinking.” Yumiko was shouting now. 

  
She and Sophie continued arguing, but I no longer paid them any attention. I was laser focused on the big red button. It was unmarked, sitting at the far end of the computer terminal. Just a couple feet away. Almost within reach. There was no one else around.   

  
“The techno-priests will be here soon—”

  
“That could be too late—”

  
“We don’t even know if he can—”

  
“JASON!”

  
I’d raised my hand over the button, about to slam my palm down on its shiny red surface. 

  
“What the Hell are you doing?” 

  
No one moved: Yumiko, Sophie, all the scientists and guards. Everyone stared at me in abject terror. 

  
“It wasn’t a demon,” I said. “It was a nature spirit. It only wanted to help living things.”

  
“Jason… You press that button, we all die,” Sophie said, trying (failing) to keep her voice calm. “It wants to destroy us.” 

  
“Of course it does.” My body shook. “I felt the horror you put it through.” A deep, unwavering rage clouded my thoughts. A desire for revenge. Somewhere in the back of my mind I wondered: *Was I a thrall now, like Colton?* My hand remained above the button.

    
One of the guards raised an assault rifle at me. Finger on the trigger. —

  
“WAIT!”   


  
A familiar voice stayed my hand. Someone in a hazmat suit had just entered the cavern, accompanied by more guards. It took me a moment to see her face through the plastic face shield.

  
“Abby?”

  
“Don’t do it.” 

  
“What’re you doing here?” I asked. 

  
“The boss wanted her,” one of the guards accompanying Abby said. 

  
I looked at Yumiko. She was still standing beside the communication pod. “Were you going to plug her into that thing next?” 

  
Yumiko sighed. Then nodded. 

  
She would’ve turned Abby into a thrall too. And for what? To keep some stupid power plant running? My hand inched closer to the big red button. 

  
“Jason. Please,” Yumiko said. “I’m sorry we forced you into this. We won’t put either of you in the pod. I swear. Just step away from the terminal.” 

  
“Why’d you do it?”

  
“Do what?” 

  
“That…” I motioned to the core. Its metal surface was steaming.  

  
“Ash can solve the world’s energy crisis. That core alone can power the entire eastern seaboard,” Yumiko said. “And it doesn’t even release greenhouse gasses. All the smoke you see outside? It’s just harmless water vapor.”  

  
“What about the toxins released into the water supply?”

  
“Toxins? There’s no evidence of any toxins,” Yumiko said. “That was from the old plant. Before we switched.” 

  
“We saw the fungus growing outside,” Abby said. “It was in the storm drains leading to this place. You say Ash can solve the world’s energy crisis? But that’s only if you can keep it under control.” 

  
“It is a challenge. I’ll admit,” Yumiko said. “But it’s one worth taking. Look at the insurmountable odds facing our planet’s future. We’re destroying it faster than we ever thought possible. And still we depend on fossil fuels. With this…” she pointed to the plant’s core. “We can leave them all behind in one fell swoop.”  

  
“You don’t know what you’re dealing with,” I said. 

  
“And you didn’t even know this place existed until an hour ago,” Yumiko said. “Suddenly you’re an expert on the topic?”

  
“No. But… I know this is beyond our understanding.”

  
“He’s right,” Abby said. “I think it’s safe to say you haven’t done a good job controlling Ash’s power if one minor outage could cause all of this.” 

  
Yumiko scoffed, but there were murmurs of agreement among the gathered scientists. Especially Sophie. No one spoke aloud, but I could see the tide shifting. 

  
“Maybe we take a step back and—AH!” I was thrown to the floor with my hands forced behind my back. Apparently, one of the guards had snuck up behind me while I was talking. 

&#x200B;

  
*That was how I ended up where I am today: sitting inside a quarantine facility far beneath the Arizona desert. I’ve been here for months now. They claim it’s to study my body and mind, to make sure there are no latent traces of Ash still in me. Supposedly they contacted my parents. I can only imagine how pissed they are now. The scientists have refused to let me speak with them directly for fear I might contaminate their minds.*    

  
*Yumiko claims they’ve vastly increased the security at Frog Hollow since that fateful night. They moved the plant core deeper underground, adding more walls and written spells to quell its rage. And they’ve decreased the core’s capacity. They’re “starting small” now. “Gradually working their way to more power,” so the scientists claim. Sophie is leading the charge. I wonder how she really feels about the project now. If it will ever be safe.*    

  
*A total of 50 employees lost their lives the night we snuck in. According to the general public, all of them died in a massive transformer explosion. It was supposedly an accident brought on by a random power surge. The company has already paid tens of millions in life insurance. And there are still lawsuits in the works. I hope they bankrupt the place.* 

  
*At least I’m not alone. Abby and Colton are down here with me. They’re in separate quarantine cells, but close enough that we can hear each other through the walls. We trade stories about the strange tests they run, the random questionnaires about nature, the strange MRI-like machines they run our bodies through every day. Each time, the scientists jot down notes and we ask how we did. They always respond with the same two words: “Results inconclusive.”* 

  
*“We’re never getting out of here,” Abby told me the other night. “Isn’t that right, Col?”*

  
*“I’m ok,” Colton said. It was one of his go-to responses.* 

  
*While Abby sounds like she’s mostly recovered from her ordeal, Colton has almost become a mute. His answers are always brief, usually just a few words:“I feel fine.” “It’s cold down here.” “When are we leaving?”* 

  
*Whenever Abby or I ask him about the bomb or Ash or the horrors in the ventilation room, his answer remains the same: “I don’t remember.” Is he really suffering from amnesia or does he just not want to relive those memories? Abby thinks the thawing out procedure damaged his brain. If he truly can’t remember that night, I envy him. I’d give anything to forget Frog Hollow.* 

  
*“They said it’ll just be another week,” I told Abby. “Then we can go home.”* 

  
*“They said that last week.”* 

  
*“True… But at least the tests are getting shorter,” I said. “Perhaps that means they’re finding less and less residue in our systems.”*

  
*“I doubt that,” Abby said. “I don’t think this has to do with contamination. I haven’t heard Ash’s voice in weeks.”*

  
*“Then why keep us here?”*

  
*“Because we know too much. No matter how many NDAs they force us to sign.” There was a long pause. Then, Abby added: “I think they already told our parents we’re dead.”* 

  
*“Don’t say that.”* 

  
*“What? It’s the only explanation,” Abby said. “Unless you’re still hearing things.”*

  
*“No,” I told her. But that wasn’t quite true. I no longer heard Ash’s voice calling out to me. But each night, I had the same vivid dream. I still have it now…* 

  
***The demon core breaks open, releasing a great Black Smoke. This smoke rises up through the earth, enveloping the Frog Hollow power plant, causing its towers to crumble. Then it spreads across our hometown, covering every building, every person, every animal, every plant. The great Black Smoke keeps moving, blanketing the rest of our state and beyond. It stays like this for centuries… millennia… eons. Choking out all life. And finally, once everything has turned to dust, the Smoke evaporates, leaving behind a world reborn. Alien growths sprout from the ashen ground, lighting up the night sky with their calming glow.*** 

  
*I don’t know what this dream signifies, but it absolutely terrifies me. Not just because of all the death and destruction such an event would cause. Because a part of me secretly hopes it will come true.* 

&#x200B;

*Perhaps I'll have to stay down here a little while longer.*
