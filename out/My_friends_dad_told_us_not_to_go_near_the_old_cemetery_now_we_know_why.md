It was August 23rd 2008 and I went out to celebrate my friends (mitchell) 19th birthday.
All of our friend group was with us 9-10 people, and we were all having a good time. It was getting late at around 1am and that's when we all decided to go home and enjoy our night. I was going back to Mitchell's house for the night. Mitchell lives on the out skirts of the main town on a farmhouse with 250 acres of land surrounding it. His house is roughly 5 miles away from town centre and we had no form of transport so we decided to walk.

We got nearly 3 miles into the walk before we heard a ear piercing screech come from the old cemetery. Mitchell's dad has always told us to not go near that cemetery no matter what. And he never told us why but we listened to him as he is 6'5 280lbs and served in vietnam. Mitchell looked at me with a scared look on his face and said with a trembling voice"

"What was that" 

I didn't reply I just shared the same expression.

We started to walk again but we heard it again, but this time it was louder and closer. I thought the thing that was screaming was right behind me so when I turned around I was expecting to see something but to my shock. Nothing.

We then realised that the scream is coming from inside the cemetery and that's when we realised something isn't right.

We both knew that we shouldn't go into the cemetery but we never knew why. We started arguing over if we should go in or go home.

I convinced him to come into the cemetery with me to check it out. We opened the gate and as I took the first step into the cemetery the air went cold and my breath was snatched. And that's when I realised I can't turn back now. 

We carried on walking further and further into the cemetery trying to find what is making the ear piercing screech we heard moments ago. 3p minutes went by and we hadn't found anything and that's when we decided that we should just go home.

We started walking back to the gate and that's when we heard it again but this time it was coming from Inside the Chapel. 

Neither of us wanted to know what was inside the Chapel so we started running to the gate. We left the gate open for a quick escape if something went wrong but when we reached the gate it was locked with a chain and padlock. 

Our only way out of the cemetery was over the 9ft wall. We climbed the wall in a matter of seconds out of fear and as we were just getting over the wall we saw what was making the noise 

To our shock stood a large pale humanoid creature standing at 7-8ft tall. it was abnormally skinny with freakishly long arms nearly reaching the floor. It was turning the other way but I knew it could tell that we were there as it was stood exactly were we was stood looking around. 

At this moment it's around 2:30 - 2:45 am and we were not staying out here any longer.

The creature turned swiftly and locked eyes with me and let out another screech but this time it was deeper than the rest. And then it started to run at us. Me and Mitchell got down from the wall and ran for the next 2 miles back to his house. We got back at 3:10am and as soon as we got home we locked all the doors and closed the curtains. 

We thought we had escaped but we hadn't. We heard the screech again but this time it was the same pitch as the first 2 and we heard it coming from the surrounding fields.

We woke his dad up and he was confused to why we woke him up. We told him everything and he looked at us with anger and fear in his eyes and simply said,

"What have you done"

I replied with a shakey voice,

"What do you mean?"

He looks me in my eyes and with a cold face says,

"It follows you"

His dad has a scar going from the top of his leg to the bottom and he always told us he going it during a football injury and they had to cut his leg open to fix it. Keep that in mind.

We started to panic. His dad went upstairs and told us to stay down here whilst he gets something. We heard a loud rustling noise coming from the side room which normally has a lock on. No one has been in that room and no one knows what's in it besides his dad. After about 10 minutes his dad came down with a rifle and 2 pistols. He gave me and Mitchell a pistol and a few more rounds of ammo and said,

"You're gonna need this"

I have shot guns before but I am not too experienced with them. Mitchell on the other hand is as his dad has taught him from a young age how to handle a firearm.

We stayed downstairs and told him everything bit this time in detail. He didn't say anything but instead sat back I'm his chair thinking about what to do.

It was 3:50am by now and the screams were still occurring around the farm house. And we still hadn't come up with a plan.

By 4:30am we had our plan, and it was to get into his dad's truck and search the area. 

His dad turned on all the lights surrounding the fields and attached his light strip to top of his truck. And we set out looking for the creature.

Whilst in the truck his dad told us that the scar on his leg wasn't from a football Injury but from the creature we had encountered. He told us that one night he heard the same screeching noise and went to investigate but he wasn't fast enough to outrun the creature and it cut his leg open. But luckily for him a car was driving his direction. He waved the car down and got in. He took his belt off and made a make shift tourniquet with it to slow down the bleeding.he was drove to the hospital where they was able to patch him up without removing his leg.

Shortly after he told us what Really happened. We saw it. Stood motionless in the beam of the trucks light. His dad shouldered his rifle and said,

"Time to kill this son of a bitch"

He shot the creature 4 times. 2 hitting the lower back and 1 hitting the upper shoulder. The creature collapsed to the ground and let out one more screech. But this one wasn't like the rest. It was louder and you could hear the pain behind the screech. 

We drove to were it collapsed and its blood was black, the creature was led in the long grass in a deformed position breathing heavily. Its eyes were blue and its skin was almost transparent.
The black blood surrounded it and covered the grass around it. His dad shot ot ons more time in the head before ot stopped moving all together. 

We left the creature in the field and we would deal with it the next day.

Its the next day at around 12pm and we decided to go see it. We walked to where it was led but to our surprise. Nothing. The creature had vanished and hadn't left a trace, the black blood was no longer there but the grass was flattened from where it was led. We knew it couldn't have move as the grass around it was untouched apart from were we came through. We searched the property for atleast 2 hours before we gave up.

His dad drove me home that same day and told me not to tell a single soul about what I had encountered. I kept hearing the screeches every so often and everytime I heard them I wouldn't sleep that night I would stay up at night holding the pistol he gave me.

This was 15 years ago and I still have troubles dealing with it. I'm now 34 and have a wife and 2 kids. Mitchell is 34 aswell and has a child with his fianc√©. I still keep in contact with his dad who is now 76.

We don't bring up the night with each other and when we hear the screeches together we ignore them but I know that when he here's them alone he doesn't sleep either.
