(Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault)

As a kid, I've  always wanted to go to disneyland. Just watching the commercials, looking at the rides, the characters, it was all so whimsical. So imagine how happy I was when I was told I was finally going to be able to go after years of waiting.

It was my senior year in high school I was 18 at the time, and my parents wanted to surprise me with a trip to disneyland, however they said that I would be going alone because my parents had something important planned for that week so they wouldn't be going with me. I was told to go pack a bag to stay in the hotel at disney world. I was excited but feeling slightly nervous because I would be going alone.

The next day I was dropped off at disney world, got a wristband so I could explore the area. My parents helped me find my room in the hotel. I was a little upset that my hotel room was isolated from the other hotel rooms. They told me I would be fine, then they put all my things into my hotel room.

They said goodbye, made sure I had everything I needed, gave me a camera for photos and then left me with my own devices.

After they left, I went outside my room to find the mickey mouse character sitting outside of my room. He stood up and approached me speaking in a really good mickey mouse impression "Hello there young lady. Welcome to the happiest place on earth! I hope you enjoy yourself missy!" and with that he walked away, staring at me all the while.

I thought it was strange that Mickey was inside the hotel and not outside hanging around with the children. However I thought nothing of it as I went out to the explorable areas. I wanted to check out Toontown due to the fact that I thought a cartoon neighborhood would be really cool, and I could get some good pictures there as well. As I went to the elevator, I noticed Mickey Mouse was already standing at the elevator I was going to go to.  He looked at me as the elevator doors opened, I entered first, then Mickey entered and stood uncomfortably close to me. I didn't say anything because perhaps he didn't notice, afterall mascot suits are hard to see out of. The elevator went down to the first floor and the doors opened. He watched me as I walked out of the elevator and out the door. I thought that was weird, but I just shrugged it off.

I made my way to toontown and spent all day taking photos around the vibrant village. The entire time I noticed Mickey Mouse waving at me, I would wave back and then walk away whilst he stared at me. That made me really uncomfortable. I didn't know why he was staring at me...why he was following me.

I was exploring toontown all day and I lost track of time, I found myself alone in the town as the sky got darker. Well, I wasn't completely alone, Mickey Mouse was waiting for me at the entrance to toontown.

"Mind if I walk you to the hotel?" He said quietly "It's not safe for a young lady to be roaming this area at night."

I wanted to say no, but the thought of walking around the park at night alone scared me more than some guy in a costume.

Mickey held his hand out for mine, I reluctantly put my hand in his thanking him as I let him lead the way.

He walked me all over the park until we finally reached the hotel. We took the elevator up to my floor as Mickey stared at me, still being uncomfortably close.

Mickey took me into my room, let himself inside, and closed the door I heard a click after he closed it, I turned around seeing that Mickey locked the door. He then stood in front of the door and stared at me.

"Thanks for your help." I said, not trying to appear panicked "Have a nice night."  hoping and praying that saying goodbye would get him out of my hotel room.

He didn't leave, he just stood and stared at me, that cheerful smile now feeling a lot more sinister than before. He walked up to me, he was so close that his chest was pushing mine. "If you don't leave, I'll call the police!" I shouted, hoping that would scare him off.

"With what phone?" He said while giggling, still maintaining the Mickey Mouse impression. I quickly checked my pocket to see that it was empty. I looked at Mickey and he was holding my phone in his hands "Were you looking for this? I must've taken it on that little walk of ours.". He then threw it on the ground and stopped on it until it was no longer usable. He then laughed as he turned back to me.

He walked even closer, cornering me in the room, I found myself against the wall, unable to escape. I tried to hit Mickey, but to no avail. "You're so pretty you know?" He whispered as he grabbed my arms "I just wish you were more cooperative." After Mickey said that he slammed me to the ground, then sat down on top of me. I tried to struggle, but to no avail. He wouldn't budge, he wouldn't let me go. I tried to scream, but he just covered my mouth with his hand.

"Shhhh, you don't want to ruin the fun do you?" He asked using that same Mickey Mouse voice impression. "Just be a good girl."

He leaned so close to my face, the head's nose was touching mine. He lifted himself up as he started to grope my body, I started to cry, feeling helpless. I started to struggle even more now, he hit me in the face "Stay still!" He said as he started to remove my clothing. I felt numb, realizing there was nothing I could do as he stripped me, I just sat and sobbed. He turned me over on my stomach and continued to grope me.

"You're starting to behave very well. Good girl. Good girl." Mickey said in my ear as he started to undo the buttoning on his pants. I just cried even more, wanting it all to end.

"You're so adorable... I've been watching you for so long, waiting for this moment." Mickey said, still maintaining his impression, He started to do what he wanted, whilst grasping my shoulders intensely.

"Good thing I broke those cameras so no one can catch us, it would be a shame if the fun was ruined right NOW, wouldn't it?" I was sobbing as he grabbed my body, he started to hit me even more as he moaned. I just wanted him to be done, it felt like an eternity before he was finished.

Once he finished doing what he wanted, he got up, tidied himself in the bathroom, and walked to the hotel door. What he said before he left will forever haunt me:

"If you tell ANYONE about tonight. I will make sure you never see your parents again...so remember, this is our little secret! You're going to take it to your grave, understand?" I nodded "Goodnight." He said chuckling In that same Mickey Mouse impression as he took my key and closed the door.

I was left on the ground, beaten and bruised, that's where I fell asleep, feeling too weak to stand up.

Once the sun rose, I never left the hotel room, I spent the entire day within my room, feeling too strained to leave. Mickey Mouse had my room key so he was able to open my door and come inside my room whenever he wanted to. He continued to come inside my room every night, forcing me to do things I didn't want to do. I was too scared to do anything for the rest of the week.

Once the week was over, I quickly packed my bags and waited in the parking lot for my parents to come get me. They sounded so worried when they saw me, asking why I didn't answer my phone.

That was 6-7 years ago and to this day, I never bought up what happened to anyone, I still haven't to this day, out of fear of my life as well as the life of my parents. He said he knew who was....and that's what scares me the most...I'll never know who it is that's following me.
