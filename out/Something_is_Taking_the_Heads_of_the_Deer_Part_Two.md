Entry 4:          

I never made it to my parents.

I didn’t even make it to the main road. As I slugged down the uneven dirt trail that leads from my house to the main road, my path was blocked. The trail was crawling with deer. Living deer. Dozens upon dozens of them. They were already staring directly at me as if they were expecting my attempted escape. They remained unblinking and unmoving despite my best efforts to scare them off. I shouted, blared my horn, and even shot my gun once into the air. All to no avail.

Since night was quickly approaching I decided to trail back to my house and hunker down for another night. I found a wider patch in the trail to allow me to turn my truck around. The deer still unmoved as their outlines disappeared behind my rearview mirror. Seeing all those deer staring at me with their soulless looking eyes was almost as unsettling as the deer I tripped over this morning. It certainly was an unexpected sight to me.

As I rolled back into my yard nothing seemed out of the ordinary. As I put my truck into park, I prepared myself for the dash I was going to make back to my house. I grabbed my flashlight and my gun. Right as I took the keys out of the ignition, for the last moment my headlights illuminated the forest ahead of me I glanced at the sight of antlers. There was no way I was going out there without knowing what was ahead of me. As I fumbled to put the keys back into the ignition, I finally got them in and my headlights once again lit up the forest. I was greeted by the sight of a buck staring back at me about 30 feet away in some dense brush covering its body.

The fur on its face was a bit patchy, and its eyes appeared slightly clouded in the reflection of my headlights. Contrary to what the deer in the road did, the buck darted away through the thick brush. All I could really see was the way its antlers moved as it ran away. It didn’t look like it was galloping like a normal deer would. It bounced in the way that a humans’ head bounces when they run. Seeing all of this, I’m assuming that this was an old, sick deer that probably won’t survive the winter.

Waiting a few moments after that ill deer ran out of vision, I grabbed my gun and flashlight, then sprinted the 5 or so feet between my truck and the front door. Unfortunately, I can’t park in my garage as I have the snow mobile I have been repairing and a bunch of kayaks which take up most of the space in my garage. Not enough for my truck to park in.

I am now safely back in my home as I am typing this.

I have zero intention of leaving the confines of my house. I have everything locked, all of my curtains drawn, and all my exterior lights on, hopefully to ward off any intruders. I will update you all tomorrow or when anything changes.
