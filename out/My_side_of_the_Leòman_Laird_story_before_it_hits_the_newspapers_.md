Details of this event will emerge in the court case, and posting this is pushing my luck (as my wife used to say), so for now, I’ll use fake names. 



All related events are true to the best of my perception. 



...



‘Dad, I can’t see,’ Matty said. 



‘What, son?’ I replied, trying to control the hysteria in my voice. 



He pointed at the windscreen. It was true; I’d driven the three hours from Newcastle in a kind of trance. The glass was a smorgasbord of bugs.



I hit the little doodad to clean the fluid. Empty. The wipers washed further bug crud across the window. 



I pulled over at Stevie McDonald’s hamlet store, leaving Matty in the car in case questions were asked. 



Stevie’s accent was as thick as his jam jar bottom glasses. Seven years earlier when Matty was born and we’d first bought the log cabin, Stevie was a puzzle to me. I thought he was speaking Swedish. 



‘IzitBillorWillum?’ 



‘Excuse me?’ 



‘BillorWillum?’ 



My wife was from Edinburgh and had acted as translator. 



‘He’s asking if you prefer to be called Bill or William?’



‘Ah, William.’ 



‘Nae bother, Willum.’ 



Stevie had not aged much in that time.



‘Alone are you?’ 



I nodded and collected the wiper fluid and the other stuff we’d forgotten in the rush: milk and bread.’ 



‘Aye, loadsa beasties.’ 



‘Come again?’ 



‘Beasties.’ He nodded at the windscreen washer. ‘You know why?’ 



‘I don’t.’ 



‘Leòman Laird.’ 



I rubbed my eyes. ‘My brain ain’t working properly, Stevie. Can you give it to me in American English?’



‘The Moth King!’ 



He gestured at a cardboard cutout of his moth guy. 



In another life, away from the remote Scottish backwater, Stevie would have made a good living in marketing, advertising- maybe politics because he was an accomplished bullshit artist. 



‘I’m telling you, son, the Leòman Laird, he’s real. I’ve seen him with my ain two eyes. And how do you explain the beasties?’ 



I paused. ‘Climate change?’ 



‘Hadawayinshite… Anyway, you’re on the way up the road?’ 



‘Yes.’ 



‘Well, keep your lights off at night.’ 



‘I thought it was the dark I was meant to be scared of?’ 



‘Not with Leòman Laird on the prowl. He’s attracted tae the light.’ 



I stepped toward Stevie’s Moth King exhibition and picked up a sealed plastic packet- clearly Cadbury’s chocolate buttons repackaged as 'Leòman Laird droppings.’ 



‘I’ll buy your shite,’ I said, picking up the bag, ‘if I can use your landline.’ 



Stevie broke into a broad grin, his orange whiskers twitching. 



The village had been scheduled for modernization, a 100ft cell tower, and fiber optic broadband, but someone with a keen mind at the Scottish Tourism Board realized they could save money and exploit a gap in the market. In our hyper-connected world, there was space for a dark spot, an off-grid oasis. 



I went into the backroom of Stevie’s shop– his living room–and dialed my lawyer’s number. 



‘Jesus Christ, William, what have you done?’ 



‘They left me no choice.’ 



‘If you bring Matty back now, they’ll not press charges.’ 



‘I’m not going to do that.’ 



‘They’ll charge you with manslaughter.’



‘He’s a little kid!’ I shouted and then lowered my voice. ‘And he’s a human being, and he deserves to see whatever time he has left in … peace. I’ll be in contact when…’ 



I couldn’t bring myself to say it. 



The phone clicked. 



…



Returning to the car, I passed Matthew the chocolate buttons. 



The chocolate went unopened; he hadn’t eaten anything for days. 



Matty had a silent cancer. Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas– the same thing that had killed his mom. The only blessing was that there was no pain, but then again, that wasn’t strictly true; there was a hell of a lot of pain from a senior oncologist with a God complex who wanted to keep him alive(when the suffering would start) even as the nurses and other doctors knew all hope was lost. 



That is when we’d made our break for freedom. 



It was a 15-minute drive from Stevie’s store to our cabin. It didn’t take long to get from tarmac to dirt track and for the forest to grow thicker. 



Pine lined the sides. Of course, there were no street lights, so the sky was awash with stars. 



With Matty, it was like all that physical life force kids have– running and jumping and fighting– was channeled into books. His mind was a hungry caterpillar. 



‘Dad?’ 



‘Yeah, buddy?’ 



‘Was I breast feeded?’ 



I laughed. 



‘No, son, you weren’t.’ 



I was driving slow, probably too slow, but when you’ve got a sick kid, your mind starts playing tricks– the bump in the road will unstick something. 



‘Why do you ask?’ I continued. 



It was too dark to read, but he still held the book open in his hands like an old guy at the library, musing. 



‘They say that Hercules, he tried to get milk from Hera when she was sleeping, and she pushed him off, and the milk splashed out, and that's the Milky Way Galaxy.’ 



‘Well, I suppose it makes as much sense as a guy with a beard creating it in six days.’ 



I was not particularly book-smart unless you counted sports autobiographies. He got that from his mom. 



‘Icarus,’ he continued. 



‘Now there’s a jabroni I know.’ 



‘You know what his mistake was?’ 



‘He flew too close to the sun.’ 



‘Yeah. You know what he should’ve done? Flown at night because the moon reflects the same light but wouldn’t be enough to melt his feathers.’ 



I glanced up. The full moon hung suspended over us like a celestial mirrorball. 



‘And you know, Dad, what a lunatic is?’ 



‘Yeah, I saw my fair share growing up in Philly.’ 



‘No, I mean a real lunatic… In Greece, lunar means "moon", and tic means "hit by". They thought if you spent too long looking at the moon, you went crazy. Do you think it’s true?’ 



‘No, buddy, I don’t.’ 



I looked over at my son swaddled in blankets, wasted away as he was, and tried to focus on not driving us into a tree at high speed. 



You don’t know crazy until you see your son dying and realize you’ve spent the last ten minutes fantasizing about ways to kill him and then yourself. 



…



Our place had been built by the Forestry Commission in 1920. I always got a kick outta that–building log cabins to save trees. 



After WW1, there was a shortage of timber, so the Scottish Government planted the fast-growing pine. 



I liked the pine forest, the smell, the shade, but the locals bitch-moaned that pine was non-native. There were projects afoot to restore the ‘native temperate rainforest’. 



My wife said it was my imagination, but they seemed to take particular pleasure in sounding off on foreign interlopers. 



We’d done minimal work on the cabin in the time we'd had it. The first two summers, we’d lived like the dude at Walden Lake, and then when the baby came along we fitted mods and cons like hot water and electric light. 



Still, no phone, no internet, and our closest neighbor was three miles away. 



I lifted Matty out of the car, laid him on the sofa, and checked the cabin to see if it’d been rewilded. 



‘Dad?’ 



‘Yeah, buddy?’ I shouted back from the guest room. 



‘Who is Leòman Laird?’ 



The toilet in the bedroom looked far from healthy. 



‘Who?’ 



‘Leòman Laird. A moth and a man.’ 



On the back of the chocolate buttons, Stevie had included a little Bio of his cryptid. 



‘Don’t read that trash, son.’ I answered, shutting the blinds and scraping away a fine layer of dust.



Returning to the living room, I went over to our old vinyl player and put on some Miles– Miles for miles driven. Then, I poured myself a Laphroaig and sat in the leather armchair, suddenly overcome with fatigue. 



My wife liked Edward Hopper and his paintings adorned the walls. 



That American master in a log cabin in the ass end of Scotland? Yet somehow, it made sense. 



Hopper’s paintings are city scenes but depict people who somehow find themselves adrift– that idea you can be surrounded by people and still entirely alone. 



I took a bigger gulp of the whiskey than I should have and lit the log fire. It was summer, but not in any way most Americans would recognize. 



‘Dad?’



‘Yeah, kiddo.’ 



‘What is it like to die?’ 



We sat in the silence of the cabin's low light, the sound of splintering wood. 



I wanted to answer: you tell me. 



…



I carried him to bed and sat in the corner.  



I must’ve drifted off after because the whiskey was in a pool at my feet. 



My first thought was always Matty; I checked his breathing. 



And then from the living room, there was the sound of something softly rapping against glass. 



I’d left the lamp on, and Hopper and the sofa were reflected at me in the window. 



And that’s when I saw it– a flash of white. 



Because the glass was reflecting the room, I looked over my shoulder at nothing. 



I took a few faltering steps forward; the forest outside still blended with the inside. It was only when I pressed my nose against the glass, the living room faded from view. 



Moths and midgies and the things that ate them flitted around the glass, trying to get at the light. 



A figure leaped into view! 



I jumped back, spreadeagling across the hardwood floor, a pathetic yelp escaping me, and then I dragged myself up. 



What exactly had I just seen? It was a guy with a white crew cut, and beard, and hairy cheeks– and black eyes. No, he was wearing shades and some kind of novelty ears. 



The police in tactical gear? They’d tracked us down, and they’d take Matty and attach him to some awful machine that’d give him one extra week of life and enough pain to last a lifetime. 



I switched out the lamp, and the room disappeared. Taking up an old walking cane from the umbrella stand, I pushed open the door. If it wasn’t the cops, maybe it was a local loony. Then again, maybe I was the local loony. 



The terrace gave way to a carpet of pine needles that made no sound underfoot. 



I did a lap of the cabin. Nothing other than the long, dark night. 



Returning to the cabin, the room was cut with a sliver of light- the fridge open. 



‘Matty,’ I said in hope rather than expectation. 



I flicked on the big lamp, and something snapped inside my brain– or at least that’s what the prosecution will claim. 



Standing across from me was a… creature. 



(I’ve been advised not to use the word creature because I’ll get memed out of existence, but I can think of no other word). 



It was a half-moth half-man. It stood a full head taller than me, and that fucking head!



Set in its circular white fur-covered dome, were two black bulbous eyes. 



It had a powerful torso, also fur-lined but thin legs that bent the wrong way at the knees. The outline of wings were folded against its back. 



I stood transfixed as the operating system of my mind crashed. 



It was something extremely human that snapped me back.



‘You motherfucker!’ 



In place of a nose was a proboscis as thick as a hose pipe, and it was in my fridge submerged in a pint of milk. 



I swung the stick madly, and that’s when the wings unfurled. It veered madly to the left, splashing milk in a 360-degree arc and crashing into and then through the cabin window. 



Matty screamed, and my thoughts diverted. 



I moved pretty decent for an older guy, all those years running bases, but instead of a bat, I was still holding my cane. 



I rounded the door and burst into the bedroom. 



‘Matty!?’ 



‘Mothman,’ he whispered.



‘Where?’ I darted toward the window. 



‘No, the wardrobe.’ 



The wardrobe was a great big Victorian thing we’d meant to get rid of but had never found the time to take an axe to. 



Tentatively, I opened the door. 



Empty. 



I went to beat the old clothes, and then they came whirling at me– a tangle of tartan. 



The creature flapped wildly around the room, crashing into the ceiling, discarding a bathrobe as it did. 



It hit the ceiling once, twice, thrice, and crashed through a skylight, zipping up into the sky and discarding some mothballs and a lady’s nightie. 



I picked up Matty and bolted for the car. 



A curious kind of stillness had fallen over him. 



‘I don’t think it was hurting me, Dad.’ 



I wasn’t about to test the hypothesis that a 7-foot mothman was a swell guy. 



As we exited the cabin, a cloud passed in front of the moon, shrouding us in temporary darkness. 



And then the moon reappeared. 



Even in such a panic, I couldn't help but stand in awe. 



On the roof, among the trees, flapping overhead, was an army. 



I didn't bother yanking the car door handle because escape was impossible. 



A path was cleared among the creatures that swirled and danced and one mothman descended. 



That was when Matty whispered, ‘Leòman Laird’.



At first, the Moth King was hard to see. He was silhouetted against the moon's brightness, his translucent wings, almost the length of a hang glider, eerily beautiful. 



He landed near as his subjects hummed and buzzed. 



Leòman Laird was entirely black in contrast to the white soldiers. He was so black he seemed to shimmer purple in the moonlight. 



And it hit me. This was death. All those metal songs I listened to as a kid: Slayer, Sabbath, Metallica. This is the Grim Reaper– not personified- because it wasn’t a person. 



Yet it was personal. He’d taken my wife, cut down at 36, and he was coming for the only thing I had left. 



I set Matty down on the pine carpet and looked at Leòman Laird.



‘Let’s do this, motherfucker.’ I charged at him like a geriatric Viking with the cane above my head, and then everything went black 



… 



It was still night when I came to. 



I wasn’t at the cabin anymore and not in the pine forest either. 



What confronted me was an ancient oak the locals would have called native. 



In each of its thick, outstretched branches stood a moth man. 



Leòman Laird stood at the base of the tree above a package. 



As I got to my feet and stepped closer, I saw it was something wrapped in silk., 



No not silk, a cocoon. 



‘Matty! Matty!?’ 



I rushed over the bare earth toward this carapace. 



‘You motherfucker! You fucking bastard! You couldn’t give me the final 48 hours with my son?!’ 



Tears ran freely down my cheeks as I clawed at the fibrous case. 



Matty’s face became visible, and I didn’t have to put my finger under his nose to see if he was breathing; my boy was completely still.  



I stood and started beating that monster’s chest, but it seemed entirely futile. It was man versus existence. Man versus entropy. Man versus the heat death of the universe. 



And then, under me, the carapace began stirring and Matty's eyes opened. 



‘Son?’



He recognized me, but some part of him wasn't entirely there. 



‘You’re alive!’ I went to grab him, to reclaim him, return him to… the real world. And that stirred the Moth King into action. 



He nudged me back. 



‘Fuck you. That’s my son!’ 



‘No, Dad.’ It was Matthew in a soft voice. ‘It’s time.’ 



Further sections of his cocoon cracked and then started the whirring of the moth army’s wings. 



Matty broke free, and some of the moth men flew down and lifted him. Again, I went to snatch him but this time stopped myself. 



Two wings, beautiful delicate structures, extended from his back. 



The Moth King stepped forward and took Matty under his arms. 



That mad buzzing of wings reached a fever pitch. 



‘But…’ I trailed off because as the Leòman Laird grasped him, I knew, although it was against every instinct, I had to let go. 



And then they ascended, the Moth King and Matty. They soared upward until the bigger released the smaller. 



My boy, my lovely boy, he drifted this way and that and then seemed to gain confidence with his newfound powers of flight. 



He zipped and darted, giggling madly. 



And then the army of moths took off too and with Matty and Leòman Laird in tow, made for the moon and the heavens beyond.
