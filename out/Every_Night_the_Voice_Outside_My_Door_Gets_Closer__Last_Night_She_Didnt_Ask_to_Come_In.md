I moved into an old house hoping for peace and quiet after my divorce. Instead, every night at exactly 2 a.m., I hear a woman’s voice outside my bedroom door. Every night, she gets closer. Last night… she didn’t ask to come in.

I haven’t slept in eight days. Not really. Not the kind of sleep where you close your eyes and let your guard down. Because every time I do, I hear it.

I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe to warn someone. Maybe to convince myself I’m not insane. If you think this is some creepy pasta or a joke, I swear on my life—every word is real.

The First Whisper

The first time it happened, I’d just moved into this house.
It’s an old single-story place on the edge of town. Cheap rent, quiet street, only one neighbor two houses down.

I wanted peace. After my divorce, all I needed was silence. My ex-wife, Julia, used to tell me I never listened to her. She’d get angry when I’d sit there, staring at nothing, lost in thought. Truth is, I just didn’t like noise.

The first night here, I was lying in bed, half-asleep, when I heard it.
A whisper. Low, shaky. Coming from somewhere near my bedroom door.

”…Can I come in?”

At first, I thought it was my imagination—just the wind through the hallway. I live alone, but the place creaks and groans like an old man shifting in his sleep. I ignored it.

Patterns

The second night, it came again. Same time—around 2 a.m.—but this time, the voice was clearer.

“Please… I just want to talk.”

It was a woman’s voice. Weak, almost childlike, but not quite. Something about it made my stomach twist—not the words, but the way it felt like she was smiling when she said them.

By the third night, I was starting to get uneasy. I made sure every door and window in the house was locked. I even wedged a chair under the doorknob to my bedroom.

At 2:04 a.m., I heard it again. Only this time, it was closer—right on the other side of the door.

“Please… I’m cold.”

My skin prickled. I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. I stared at the shadows on my ceiling until sunrise.

⸻

The Voice Changes

By night five, I was jumpy during the day. I kept checking the locks, kept my phone in my hand like a weapon. My neighbor, old Mr. Wilkins, noticed.
“You look like hell,” he told me over the fence. “Bad dreams?”

I almost told him, but something stopped me. I didn’t want to see that look in his eyes—the one people get when they think you’re losing it.

That night, the voice changed. It was no longer pleading. It sounded… irritated.

“Why won’t you let me in?”

I tried something. I whispered back.
“Who are you?”

The silence that followed was worse than the voice. I waited, my heart pounding, until finally, she said:
“You know me.”

I swear I’ve never heard that voice before in my life, but my chest tightened like I had.

⸻

Recordings That Lie

Night six, I set up my phone to record audio. I left it on my nightstand, hit record, and tried to sleep.

At 2:03 a.m., the voice came.
“Please… it’s so dark out here.”

Then… footsteps. Slow. Bare feet on wood.
They circled my bed.

When I checked the recording in the morning, there was nothing. No voice, no footsteps—just my own breathing.

That’s when I realized something: it wasn’t in the house. It was in me.

⸻

The Door Opens

Night seven is when I broke.

It was louder than ever, right at my ear:
“Let me in.”

I bolted upright, fumbling for the lamp. Light filled the room—and the chair I’d wedged under the doorknob was gone.
The door was wide open.

I swear I saw something slip out—tall, thin, with hair that moved like it was underwater.

I ran through the house, every light on, searching. Nothing.

Daytime Intrusions

Now it’s not just at night. I hear her when I’m cooking. When I’m in the shower. Sometimes, she hums. Sometimes, she scratches at the walls.

Two days ago, I woke up on the couch, even though I went to bed the night before. There was dirt on my feet. My front door was unlocked.

⸻

The Connection

I started digging through the old papers in the attic. I found a photo of a woman standing in my bedroom doorway—long black hair, pale skin, eyes that didn’t reflect light.

On the back, written in faded ink: “Don’t let her in.”

The handwriting was shaky, like the person was terrified while writing it.

⸻

Losing Time

Two mornings ago, I woke up to the sound of boiling water.
I don’t remember getting out of bed. I don’t remember turning on the stove.

When I walked into the kitchen, there was a pot—my pot—filled with dark water. Not black like coffee. Dark like… blood thinned with water.

It smelled metallic.
I threw it in the sink, turned on the tap, and just watched the red spiral down the drain.

For the rest of that day, every time I blinked, I saw a woman’s face in the steam. Not just any woman—her.

Mr. Wilkins’ Warning

That afternoon, I decided I’d had enough. I went to see Mr. Wilkins, my neighbor. He’s been here forty years—if anyone knew the house’s history, it would be him.

He didn’t even let me finish my question.
“You’ve heard her, haven’t you?” he said, eyes narrowing.

When I nodded, his hands began to shake.
“You don’t talk to her. You don’t answer. You sure as hell don’t open the door.”

I asked him who she was.
He just looked past me, towards my house, and said:
“She’s patient. More patient than you. One day, you’ll be tired enough, scared enough, or lonely enough… and you’ll say yes.”

Before I could ask more, he slammed his door.

⸻

The Window

That night, I did everything—chair under the doorknob, windows locked, lights on.

At 1:50 a.m., I woke up. Not because of the voice. Because I heard tapping.
Soft. Rhythmic. Coming from the window beside my bed.

I didn’t want to look, but something made me glance.

She was there. Not outside—in the reflection.

I was staring at my own empty room, but in the glass, she was standing just behind me.
Her lips were moving.

I couldn’t hear her, but I could read them:
“Let. Me. In.”

⸻

The Hair

I’ve started finding strands of hair in my mouth when I wake up.
Long, black, and wet.
I don’t have black hair. I don’t have long hair.

Last night, I tried to burn one. It didn’t catch fire. It just curled and twitched, like it was alive.

I don’t know if it was my imagination, but I swear it moved towards me before I dropped it into the sink.

⸻

The Second Voice

This morning, something new happened.

I heard a knock at the door—normal, human.
When I opened it, no one was there.

But from the end of the hall, I heard her voice, mocking:
“You left your door open.”

I slammed it shut and locked it, but then…
I heard another voice. Deep, raspy, like someone who hadn’t spoken in years:
“Don’t.”

It came from inside the house.

⸻

Tonight’s Plan

I’m not waiting anymore. I’ve set up my phone again—video this time, not just audio. I’ve also placed a line of salt under the door. I don’t know if it’ll do anything, but it makes me feel less helpless.

It’s 1:45 a.m. now.
She’s early. I can hear her humming that same tune again. Louder this time, like she knows it’s almost over.

The boards creak. She’s outside my door.

“Please…”

The salt line shifts—like something heavy just stepped over it.

“You know me. You’ve always known me.”

I want to run, but my body won’t move. My phone screen lights up on its own, camera on, pointed at the door.

The knob turns.

If you’re reading this and my account goes silent after tonight… don’t look for me.
Don’t come to this house.
Don’t answer the voice.

Because I did.

And now she’s not behind the door anymore.
She’s behind you
