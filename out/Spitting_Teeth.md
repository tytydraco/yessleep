I have really bad teeth. To be perfectly clear, my mouth is a train wreck. Growing up, I had several accidents where I was hit in the mouth and either chipped, cracked, or completely lost a tooth. I didn’t really play any sports, especially hockey or baseball; I guess I was just a clutz.

By the time I was in the 3rd grade, I had been well-acquainted with my local dentist's office. When every other kid in my grade was afraid of going to the dentist, it was like a second home for me, what with my constant emergency visits and weekly check-ups. I had lost all my baby teeth pretty early on and had spent quite some time with hardly any teeth at all.

Once I got to middle school, I needed braces. My permanent teeth had come in extremely wonky and crooked. I had an uneven set of teeth, all different shapes and sizes. My orthodontist tried to make me feel better by telling me each tooth was different because it came from my past lives. I thought that was batshit crazy.

I was told that even after the braces, I would need a couple of different cosmetic surgeries to make my teeth appear normal. I already had low expectations, and wondered if I should just save money and either get veneers or crowns as an adult. The whole ordeal would be expensive regardless, and my parents’ dental insurance wouldn’t be able to cover everything.

I was given headgear to wear around the clock, and at the time, that was pretty much hell. I had a strict routine to follow for my dental care, which took a lot of careful planning and time management. I could barely eat, especially if I was feeling lazy. I was already pretty skinny, so my mom found a diet plan of blended drinks for me to try so I wouldn’t become malnourished.

My dental care consumed me, and I started having nightmares related to it. At first, it was little things, like forgetting to use mouthwash or accidentally removing my headgear when I wasn’t supposed to, but the nightmares quickly grew more intense and began following me into my everyday life.   

The first time this happened was when I had a dream about neglecting to floss before school. Flossing is one of the most tedious steps in my routine, and in my dream, I didn’t have time for it. As I was sitting in class, I felt a thick, warm sensation oozing from my gums and beginning to pool beneath my tongue. I was used to the taste of metal, but this was strong, like rusty coins. I gagged, and thinking I might vomit, I hurriedly left my seat and ran to the bathroom. I pushed open one of the stalls and spat into the toilet. Blood. I turned and opened my mouth to inspect it in the mirror. To my disgust, I saw that my gums were bleeding. It dribbled down my chin. I wiped it vigorously and tried to contain it in my mouth. I tipped my head back and attempted to swallow, but I couldn’t will myself to do it and ended up choking and coughing up the blood. It just kept coming. Leaking out from every corner, every crevice of my gums, between my teeth, and down.

I was awoken by my teacher, who had come to check on me since I’d apparently been in the bathroom for a while. He found me lying on the floor by the toilet, and upon waking up, I immediately went and looked in the mirror. The blood was gone.

Another time, I’d dreamt about one of my brackets breaking. This wasn’t a big deal, as it’s happened to me before, but as my mom was driving me to the orthodontist’s office to have it fixed, I felt something pull in my mouth. Suddenly, I let out a pained cry as a bracket was ripped off. Before I could process what or how that’d happened, more brackets began being yanked off my teeth, by the tooth. My teeth were already extremely hypersensitive, and the sudden trauma being inflicted on my mouth in that moment sent every nerve into shock. My hands were shaking as I brought them to the sides of my face, my fingers twitching as I screamed. Bits of metal fell out of my mouth along with drool and spittle. Some of the brackets were being stubborn and wouldn’t come off so easily. The pulling and tearing were persistent, causing a few of my teeth to be forcibly twisted around as they were still burrowed into my gums. The pain was unbearable, and being unable to do anything to make it stop drove me insane. I awoke to my mom shaking me slightly and asking if I was okay. I must’ve dozed off in the car.

These incidents were scarce, but each time I would experience something like it, I was left feeling deeply disturbed and questioning how much stress could possibly cause such realistic nightmares, if I could even call them that, considering they only really happen during the day. My parents decided to start taking me to see a counselor, who suggested I was simply stressed about my teeth, and gave me a list of ways to get my mind off it. This seemed to help in the beginning, but it wasn’t long before things got worse.

When I started high school, I had barely made any progress with my teeth. The braces had accomplished next to nothing during the three years I’d had them up to this point, and my orthodontist couldn’t tell me exactly why this was. All she had to say was that because I had so much mouth trauma, it may take longer than the standard amount of time to fix my teeth. So, I had to continue living with the damn headgear.

One night, I noticed something unusual while doing my dental routine before bed. Another tooth had come in on the bottom row, in the front. How hadn’t I noticed it until now? More than that, how hadn’t my orthodontist noticed? It was fully grown in and impossible to miss. I stretched my tongue over to feel it, staring at it closely in the mirror. Suddenly, it began to wiggle. I blinked, thinking my tired eyes had imagined the movement, until it wiggled again. This time, more aggressively. The sensation was accompanied by the sound of soft clicking at first. I gasped and covered my mouth with both my hands. I could feel the sharp root of the tooth moving around, wiggling back and forth, loosening itself in my gum. My ears erupted with the sound of high-pitched vibrations, grinding, and scraping as the tooth kept rubbing against other teeth and their brackets. After a few short moments, I felt it swimming around in my saliva. Pointy and hard as a pebble. I immediately spat it into the bathroom sink. I stared down at the tooth, holding the side of my jaw in pain and disbelief. I thought I’d already lost all my baby teeth. Upon taking a closer look, I realized it was too big to be a baby tooth. More than that, I realized I wasn’t even in a nightmare. I’m supposed to wake up from these things, aren’t I? Nevertheless, I turned on the faucet and let the water take the tooth down the drain.

Following this incident, I was scheduled for yet another orthodontist visit. She was polite at first, but seemed fed up with how often I was coming in with some insane story about my teeth as an explanation for the continuous damage that was being inflicted on my braces and headgear. My mom was upset and expressed how she didn’t know what to do to help me. The orthodontist replied with a sly remark about sending an orthodontist to do a psychiatrist’s job.

While sitting in the car on the way back home, I was feeling around my teeth with my tongue, when I felt another fully grown tooth. It was toward the back of the top row. My heart dropped as the moment I noticed it was there was the moment it began to wiggle. I tried to stay calm, but the feeling of the tooth shifting so vigorously, pushing and twisting out of the socket, made me release a muffled cry. Just as it happened the first time, the tooth eventually popped right out. I held it in my mouth, cleaning it off before spitting it out into my hand. It was smaller than the last one. Still big enough to be considered an adult tooth, but it was wider on top than the previous one had been. I rolled down the window and flicked it out.

This began happening regularly, and it didn’t bother me after a while. It became like a routine. Sure, it hurt like hell in the moment, but all I had to do was bear the pain for a couple of minutes, then spit out the discarded tooth. Nothing more than that. It didn’t make a huge impact on my teeth, aside from a few slightly damaged brackets and wires, so I couldn’t complain too much.

Each tooth was different from the other, but they were all undoubtedly adult teeth. In fact, they were similar in the sense that they were like my main set of teeth. All different in shape, size, and even color. Some were whiter, some were more yellow, and some were even greyish. Some were shorter, wider, taller, thinner, duller, pointier, etc. I wondered if I should start keeping them, and considering it happened almost daily, I decided I would. I was like some sort of biological anomaly; maybe some prolific scientist or ambitious rookie would study me someday, or at least pay me a nice amount for a jar of my mystery teeth. I figured maybe this would be how I’d pay for my future cosmetic surgeries.

I kept the jar in the top drawer of my dresser. A week later, I had seven teeth in the jar. It was like clockwork. However, after about a month of collecting my spare teeth, I noticed something strange. The jar was looking a little too full. I counted each tooth, expecting roughly a number in the upper twenties, but instead found closer to forty. I was shocked. How did I not realize I had been spitting out more than one tooth a day? Had I grown that accustomed to it? I scooped the cluster of teeth back into the jar, quickly sealing it and placing it back in the drawer. I tried not to think about it until I felt that familiar sensation in my mouth. I spat a large, elongated, yellow tooth coated in blood and saliva into my palm. I stared at it blankly before going to rinse it off in the bathroom sink and adding it to the jar.

Later the next day, I was sitting during lunch period. I’ve had my braces and headgear for so long that I’ve found workarounds, especially with eating food. I was pretty comfortable with eating more solid foods, which I usually cut up into bite-sized pieces. I took a bite of the dry slider I got in the cafeteria, and as I chewed, I felt something hard. Holding it in my mouth, I swallowed the rest and spit it out onto the tray. It was another tooth. Only hours since I spit out my last one. It was smaller, tinted grey, and more of a box shape. I was overcome with a lingering sense of dread, but chose to once again ignore it and try not to think about it. So I was spitting out more teeth than usual. Big deal. I’ve become so used to the discomfort and strangeness of it all that it doesn’t bother me anymore. So, if it stayed like this, I assumed everything would still be fine.

I just recently graduated, and have currently filled 19 thirty-two-ounce jars with teeth. I lost count once it got into the thousands, which was a couple of years ago. The number of teeth I spit out in a day has wildly increased, especially in the past year. I’ve gotten into the habit of spitting out a tooth every 3-6 minutes now, but that only came about as a means of deluding myself into thinking I have some sort of control over the situation. I’ve resorted to holding teeth in my mouth so I’m not spitting a tooth every time I breathe. I have to carry a jar around with me wherever I go. My mouth is in a constant state of disrepair, much more so than it ever has been. I’ve given up on fixing my main set of teeth, having thrown away the headgear when I became a junior in high school. I had the braces removed shortly after, insisting nothing could be done. I just wanted them out. I feel like that may have contributed to the worsening of my unexplainable condition.

As I’m sitting here writing this, I feel them all around my mouth. The teeth. They’re coming in by the minute, like flower buds ready to bloom, embedded deep in the trenches of my gums, and along the roof of my mouth. Rows of jagged, misshapen teeth burrow into my oral cavity and have begun working down the very back of my throat. I can feel them growing and wiggling like eggs about to hatch. Even without the metal in my mouth, there’s always a lingering metallic flavor caking my taste buds. Raw iron. I can barely eat anymore, so I hope malnourishment will kill me before this does. I can barely sleep either, as lying down has caused me to accidentally swallow more teeth than I probably realize. But even sitting up, with the teeth in my throat making it difficult to breathe, several have come out, and I’ve had to choose between swallowing and choking.

I feel them in the pit of my stomach, the pile of teeth forming a small bump. It’s kind of like a pregnancy. Maybe that orthodontist from my childhood was right. What if these are really teeth from my past lives? Whether that be my own past lives or others. These teeth could become like children to me. I’m constantly birthing them from my mouth, small and covered in blood. They’re all-consuming, and I can’t help but spit them out. Perhaps I should just detach my jaw and let them fall out. Keeping my mouth closed feels more like a chore to me these days anyway. Regardless of how I do it, I must not fight it, and I must not give up either. Surely, there must be a reason why I was chosen, why this had to happen to me. I know I will die here sooner or later, but until then, I will continue to live out my purpose. Spitting teeth.
