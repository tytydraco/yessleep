I never wanted to believe in the supernatural. Ghost stories, urban legends—they were things I’d laugh off or roll my eyes at. But I can’t laugh this off anymore. I can’t unsee what happened. I don’t expect you to believe me, but if you’ve got a cat, maybe you’ll understand why I can’t sleep anymore. Why I don’t even trust the shadows in my own room.

It started a couple of months ago. I’d been begging my parents for a pet forever, and after what felt like years of nagging, they finally caved. A cat seemed like a good compromise—independent enough to not be a hassle for them, but affectionate enough to keep me company. I remember how excited I was when we went to the shelter.

I didn’t even have to choose. The sleek black cat with glowing green eyes chose me. He weaved between my legs, purring like I was his long-lost friend. His name was Whiskers. It felt meant to be. He was perfect.

At first, Whiskers was everything I’d hoped for. He followed me everywhere, curling up on my lap or next to me in bed. He even purred me to sleep that first night. But it didn’t take long for things to… change.

The first weird thing was the staring. Whiskers would sit at the edge of my bed or on the windowsill and just stare at me. I know cats do that sometimes, but this felt different. His eyes didn’t just look at me—they pierced me. And at night, in the dark, those green eyes seemed to glow, almost like embers. I told myself I was imagining it. I mean, all cats have quirks, right?

Then the whispering started. I woke up one night to this faint, scratchy sound. At first, I thought it was just the wind, or maybe the TV in the living room. But then I realized it was coming from inside my room. I flipped on the lamp, and there was Whiskers, sitting at the foot of my bed, staring at me. The whispering stopped the second the light came on.

That was the first time I felt real fear.

Over the next few days, it got worse. Whiskers would sit in the hallway, batting at something invisible. I swear I heard whispers whenever I got close, like they were just out of reach. And then there was the growling. I didn’t know cats could make sounds like that—low and guttural, almost… human. My parents just brushed it off. “You’ve got an overactive imagination, Tom,” they said. I wanted to believe them, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that Whiskers wasn’t… normal.

One night, I set up my phone to record. I needed proof that I wasn’t crazy. I pretended to sleep, the camera pointed toward my door. I could barely breathe as I waited, heart pounding in my chest. Hours passed. And then, it started—the whispering.

I stayed as still as I could, my whole body tense. The whispers got louder, closer. Then I heard something shuffle across the floor. I flipped on the light, but there was nothing there. Whiskers wasn’t even in the room.

The next morning, I watched the footage. What I saw made my stomach drop. Whiskers was in the hallway, just out of view from my bed. His eyes glowed brighter than they ever had, and his mouth… his mouth moved. Like he was talking. The whispering on the video was louder than I remembered, almost deafening. And then, behind him, the shadows started to shift. They weren’t just shadows—they were things, crawling out of the walls, circling him.

I showed the video to my parents. They didn’t say anything for a long time. Then my mom whispered, “We’re taking him back.”

Getting Whiskers into the carrier was a nightmare. He hissed and clawed like I’d never seen before, his eyes burning brighter than ever. For a moment, I swear he wasn’t a cat at all. He was something else.

The shelter staff seemed surprised when we brought him back, but not in the way I expected. One of them hesitated, then admitted that Whiskers had been returned multiple times. Families always reported strange occurrences, but no one could ever explain what was wrong.

That night, I tried to sleep, telling myself it was over. Whiskers was gone. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was still watching me.

I woke up around 3 a.m. to the sound of whispering. My blood turned to ice. Slowly, I turned on the light.

Whiskers was in the corner of my room. He wasn’t alone. The shadows were with him, twisting and writhing like living things. His green eyes locked onto mine, burning with a light that was almost blinding. I pulled the blanket over my head, shaking, praying for it to stop.

When I finally peeked out, he was gone. But I’ll never forget those eyes, inches from my face, burning like flames. I screamed. My parents rushed in, but it was like nothing had happened.

We moved shortly after. I don’t know if it was the house, or Whiskers, or both. I just know I couldn’t stay.

Even now, in our new place, I still feel like I’m being watched. Sometimes, I wake up and swear I see a pair of green eyes in the corner, just for a second. And sometimes, when it’s quiet, I hear the faintest whisper, like a language I’ll never understand.

Last week, I was unpacking some boxes and found one of Whiskers’ old toys—a little mouse he used to bat around. I know we left all of his things behind, but there it was, sitting at the bottom of the box. I didn’t touch it. I just closed the box and shoved it into the garage.

Then there was last night. I woke up around 2 a.m. to the sound of scratching. It wasn’t coming from the walls or the floor—it was coming from inside my closet. I stared at the door, frozen, as the scratching stopped. For a moment, I thought I saw the knob twist ever so slightly. I didn’t sleep after that.

This morning, my mom asked me if I’d been up late. She said she heard whispering coming from my room. When I told her it wasn’t me, she went pale and didn’t say another word.

I don’t know what Whiskers was—or what he brought with him—but I don’t think this is over. Whatever he was, wherever he came from, it’s still with me. I see it in the shadows, hear it in the whispers, feel it in the cold that creeps into my room at night.

Maybe he didn’t leave after all. Maybe he never will.

If anybody has any advice or information on what Whiskers might be PLEASE HELP!
