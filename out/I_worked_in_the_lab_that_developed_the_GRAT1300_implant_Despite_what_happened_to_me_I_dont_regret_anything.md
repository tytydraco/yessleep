“Mia?” I called.

  
I barely had to raise my voice. She walked in, as beautiful as ever. Even knowing she has the GRAT-1300 implant, I still can't believe she is with me.

  
I reached out my arm to her “Come snuggle up baby.”

  
She cuddled up to me. I inhaled her hair. She smiled deeply. “Oh Alan. I am so grateful to be with you!”

  
I smiled back. Her eyes were a clear limpid blue. For a moment I had a flashback to that terrible night with my ex, Layla, her terrible eyes flashing gold. Then I buried that memory in the delight of being with my sweet sweet Mia.  


GRAT-1300 will be everywhere soon- if you’re not wearing one already, you soon will be. How else do you think all those strikes and labour movements of 2021-22 died down? Have you forgotten already? It was us, well, our lab. We manufactured GRAT-1300- the implant that releases the hormones associated with being grateful and expressing gratitude.

  
The need was clear. Society had been brought to its knees by constant strikes and labour disputes, an unruly workforce, and an oligarchy simply refusing to lower profit margins. Then, our company prototyped GRAT-1300. The government legislated it for a few essential occupations- you didn’t hear about that either? It worked like a dream, and even as I speak these words and they appear before me on the screen, legislation increasing the occupations which can mandate using the implant is being passed. Heavy-hitting advertising is under development, and within a few months now, it will become the new norm. If you are working, in any sort of workplace, earning below a certain amount, you will probably have to have the GRAT-1300 inserted.  


It is a miracle. Using the latest biochemical technology, it reprograms the brain to produce constant feelings of gratitude at working and being employed, while stifling any form of resentment and frustration at workplace issues. My bosses- the lab owners are already on their way to becoming multi-millionaires. And I received a nice bonus check and a raise.

  
Which subsequently enabled me to pull a girl like Layla.

  
Oh I’m under no illusion how Layla and I got together. A geek like me, spending my entire in a lab fiddling about with chemicals and brains? I know I am virtually invisible to a girl like her- one of those girls who looks like she just walked off the set of a music video from the nineties.

  
And even when I wined and dined and gifted my way into her bed, I was still insecure. How could she ever settle for me? How long before her head was turned by some other guy desperate to win her favour? God knows there are enough, she just has to walk down the street and heads turn.

  
All is fair in love and war, right? And it’s not like I haven’t paid a price. A terrible price.

  
So, about three months into our relationship, I did it. I tweaked with one of the implants and customized it to her biometrics, and then smuggled it home from the lab. I inserted it while she was asleep. It is completely painless.

  
She rolled over, and she woke up sooner than I expected. I looked at her apprehensively.

  
But at first, it seemed to work fine. She kissed me- with a certain submissive tilt to her head that was new and just enormously charming. I felt like melting with delight. “Oh Alan” she murmured, “I am so grateful to be with you”. I actually laughed out loud with joy.

  
It must have been the third day. I came home from work. Layla was already home, and threw her arms around me. “Oh Alan, I missed you. I am so grateful to be with you” she said.

  
I smiled back at her. “Me too baby”.

  
“I am so grateful” she repeated, holding me tight.

  
I drew my head back and looked at her more closely. “Me too sweetheart”

  
A row of yellow sparks seemed to run along her eyelashes, and her hazel eyes gleamed gold. She let go of me, but then took my arm. “I - am- so-” she gasped.

  
“Layla?” I cried, trying to take my arm out of her tightening grasp.

  
“Grateful” she sputtered. Her eyes flashed, and she twisted my arm off.

  
Our screams ripped through the apartment, and we collapsed in my spurting blood.

  
\*\*\*  
I was fired of course, but not before I received a hefty buy-out for the design for Layla’s implant. Workplaces, you see, won’t be the only places which will benefit from GRAT-1300. My bosses realised there is a huge potential for the implant adapted to improve romantic relations, heck, family relations, parent-child relations. They are working on my original design now, and I think they will be ready for the market next year.

  
Therapy will soon be a thing of the past.
