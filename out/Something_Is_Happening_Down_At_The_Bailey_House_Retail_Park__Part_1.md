I'm hiding, and I'm scared. I've locked myself in the manager's office, and I don't know what else to do. How did my world change so quickly, so vastly? When I awoke this morning, all I knew was I had an eight-hour shift at work before I came home, ate my tea, and went to bed. But now? Well, now, things have changed, for the worse, considerably so. Anyway, this is a warning, one that you need to listen to, something is happening down at the Bailey House retail park, some outbreak or something. I’ll tell you what I know below.

I stood serving at the till when the shoplifter’s radio crackled to life, the voice on the other end requesting help from the onsite security and any other workers who could be spared. "Can site security come to Esther's ASAP? We have a situation. Any other workers from nearby stores can come to help if possible. It's bad." Then it crackled again, its message ended. The lady whom I'll call Jane looked at me with wide eyes and raised eyebrows, "Sounds serious," she said. Casting my eyes to the now-silent radio, I replied, "Yeah, sounds that way, hopefully not too bad, eh?" I looked back, and she gave me a tight smile. After handing over her bagged items, she thanked me and wished me a quiet shift. Returning her smile, I thanked her before my eyes once more returned to the small radio.

"That didn't sound good," I thought, my chest fluttering with anxiety. I suffer from anxiety anyway, so it doesn't take much for it to rear its ugly head. Hearing the flaps leading into the warehouse, I could see the manager and the supervisor jogging down the centre aisle. As they neared me, the manager paused and said, "I'm sure you heard the call from next door. We're going there to help. Can you hold down the fort in the meantime? James is on break, but if you need him, he can come back, OK?" I nodded before saying, "Sure, no problem."

With that, they took off through the doors. That would be the last time I saw them. Well, I saw them like that anyway. I stood by the till for a minute longer before leaving to wander around the shop floor and do some tidying. I was alone for the moment, doing my best to keep myself occupied, when the radio crackled to life once more. This time, it was issuing a warning. "Anyone on their way to Esther' don't come, turn back, lock your shops and call the police, don't let anyone in, don't take the chance." With that, it cut off again. It had been the same voice as before, but this time, it was laden heavily with panic, its tone urgent. What did she mean? "Lock your doors, don't let anyone in, don't take the chance." What the hell did that mean?

It was then that I noticed the shouting and raised voices. Turning and walking towards the door afforded me a view of what can only be described as pandemonium. People shouted, pushed, and fought in front of the next door. The crowd seemed to be spilling out from Esther's. Screams echoed as the large collective of people pushed forward, now spilling out properly onto the walkway. People trying to run were grabbed by others and attacked. I stood frozen, watching all this happen in front of me. What pulled me out was when a woman managed to push her way, though, running towards where I stood in the doorway. Not far behind her was a man, well, I think it was a man, running behind her on all fours. She was quick, but that thing was quicker. As it neared her, it leapt from the floor, landing on her back, screeching, bringing her down like a cheetah does a gazelle.

After some rapid scrabbling between the two, the thing grabbed a fistful of her hair and slammed her head down into the pavement. Her head gave a sickening crunch as it made impact. It then repeated the motion twice more, by which point she had given up, most likely having lost all consciousness. Once seemingly satisfied, it pulled her head up and twisted it, so they were face to face. Then suddenly, it lunged forward and began biting her nose, teeth dug deep, its head tugging backwards with chunks of flesh breaking away into its mouth.

As this had been happening, my hand had been searching my trousers’ pockets for the key. Having found them, I moved towards the side of the door. Not wanting to take my eyes off whatever that thing was, I slowly fumbled, trying to place the key in the lock to signal the automatic doors to close. Unable to find the right setting, I turned briefly to check, twisted the key, and swung my head back. Luckily, it was still preoccupied with its meal, which I could now tell was that poor woman's face, having deprived her of her nose and now tucking into one of her blushed cheeks. As the doors slowly came to a close, they made a slight suctioning noise. This caught the things ‘ attention, or perhaps it was the movement, not that it matters.

It stood upright, its balance off, legs shaky, and wobbled over to the door, screeching and moaning as it did so. There it stood, watching me, its head turned as if studying me, then, without warning, it slammed both hands into the glass and began screaming. Streaks of blood from its hands tainted the windows. I pushed my key into the lock on the door and pushed. The doors are old and sturdy, yet they do not sit properly together. Fighting with this creature, pushing the doors back and forth whilst I tried to twist the key, I was hoping to catch it at the right moment. After what felt like an hour of back and forth, the key slid with some resistance and clicked. I quickly pulled the key out and began to run towards the back of the shop.

As I neared the back, James began making his way down the stairs from the staff room. “Hey dude”, he said, giving me a wave. I ignored him before running into the back and pulling the bolt on the bay door, and checking that the fire exit was properly secure. While I was busy doing that, he followed me into the back and spoke again. “Hey, hello, what’s going on? What’re you doing?” I stopped and turned to face him, my eyes wide, breathing heavy. “James”, I said, holding my hands up as if I were trying to placate a scared animal. “You’ve got to listen to me, something is happening out there, people are panicking, and I just saw a woman get attacked.” Now it was his turn; the colour drained from his face, and now his eyes were as wide as mine. He spun, looking down the middle aisle toward the door. From where I stood, I couldn’t see the man thing anymore, hoping deep down that he had moved on. “Don’t worry”, I said. He spun back around, staring at me. “I’ve locked the door, they shouldn’t be able to get in, but I think for now we should hide inside the office and wait for help to arrive. There are cameras in there so we can see outside.” He didn’t say anything. “James”, I said, louder and a bit more forceful than intended. “What do you think? Good plan?”

He nodded and walked towards me and the office door. It was then that a large banging echoed throughout the building. James spun sharply, and I leaned to look over his shoulder. It was back, and worse, there was more than one. We quickly hurried into the office and shut the door behind us, hoping that if those things got in, the door would be able to hold them. I doubted it with all of my being, but still. Once we had secured the office as best we could, I told James what I had seen. He shook his head in disbelief, but after watching these things through the cameras, he came around rather quickly. He sat down in the corner and hasn’t said a word since.

As for myself, well, I’m sitting here, typing this out on the office computer, hoping to get the warning out. Most likely, if you’re local, you may already have heard about what’s going on or maybe already fallen victim. Even as I type, I still can’t get that face out of my head. That face covered in blood, its body thin and almost emaciated, and its eyes, its eyes, staring at me when I close mine. The whites are blood red, with yellow pupils. That poor lady’s blood was dripping down from its mouth and onto its chin. But even now, sitting in the office, I can still hear them screeching and howling.

I don’t know what to do, and James is in no condition to provide any help. If anyone has any suggestions on what to do and how to get out of this situation, please let me know. But please, don’t come down to the Bailey House retail park.
