The next morning, I told myself I was done thinking about it. Whatever happened last night? Didn’t happen. Case closed. No mirrors, no monsters, just my overworked, sleep-deprived brain playing tricks on me.

I had bigger things to deal with. Rent was due in a week, my boss was already looking for an excuse to fire me, and my bank account was balancing dangerously close to overdraft territory. The last thing I needed was to start unraveling over some sleep paralysis hallucination.

So, I did what any responsible adult would do: I avoided my own reflection like it was a debt collector. Brushed my teeth with my eyes down. Got dressed without checking the bathroom mirror. Walked past every shiny surface without glancing at them, like I was in witness protection from myself.

It was working. Mostly. Until I got to work.

I work at a call center. Customer service. The kind of place where time doesn’t exist and everyone’s either too tired or too miserable to be there. It’s the perfect job if you hate socializing but love suffering.

I was halfway through my shift when the first “favor” happened.

My manager, a man who once wrote me up for “unapproved bathroom breaks,” walked in and handed me an envelope. “You left this at your desk.”

I frowned. I didn’t leave anything at my desk. But I took the envelope, opened it, and nearly choked. 

Inside was cash. My rent money. The exact amount I needed, I’ve never told him I was struggling.

I looked back up at my manager, but he was already walking away, like he hadn’t just handed me a miracle.

“I didn’t—” I started, but the words died in my throat.

He didn’t seem weirded out. Didn’t act like he’d just bailed out one of his worst employees for no reason. He was just… normal. Too normal.

I checked the cameras after my shift.

The footage showed him walking over to my desk, picking up the envelope from under my keyboard, and handing it to me.

But here’s the thing—I checked that desk myself earlier that night. It was empty.

I told myself it was just luck. A weird, incredible coincidence.

Then it happened again.

The next night, my schedule changed. Normally, I work a full eight-hour shift. But when I got to the office, my manager told me, “You’re off early tonight.”

“What?” I blinked at him. “Since when?”

“Since you requested it.”

No. I didn’t.

But sure enough, he showed me the schedule, and there it was. A request in my handwriting.

I hadn’t written it.

And the best part? I was getting paid for the full shift anyway.

That was when I made my second mistake.

The first was ignoring the mirror. The second was letting this slide.

I could have questioned it. I could have pushed back, made a scene, demanded to know how my manager suddenly thought we were best friends.

But I didn’t.

Because for the first time in months, my life was easier. The crushing weight of barely scraping by was suddenly… lighter. My rent was covered. My hours were shorter. The universe had finally decided to stop kicking me while I was down.

I should have known that meant someone else was getting kicked instead.

I only realized it was happening when my coworker, Josh, came in at the end of my shift, looking exhausted.

“Dude,” he groaned, rubbing his face. “I just pulled a double. I thought I was off tonight?”


I stared at him. “You… were.”

“Yeah, well, I guess there was a mix-up or something.” He let out a tired laugh. “No one tells me anything around here.”

My stomach turned.

I went home. I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, staring at my reflection for the first time in two days.

It stared back.

And then, it winked.

I should have said something. Yelled. Smashed the mirror. But I just stood there, because deep down, I already knew:

It wasn’t done helping.
