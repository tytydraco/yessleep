For context; I was born and raised in a tiny town in Kansas and lived there all my life. I lived with my Mother and her boyfriend, but when she died in 2021 I thought it'd be a good idea to keep the family house.

My mom was always doing something, always having family over or friends over. Most of my childhood my mom was smiling like the sunshine. I didn't think she ever had and enemies and everyone seemed to love her, but still, She was murdered 2 years ago and the suspect was never caught so I was left alone, and none of my family really wanted to be around me or the house much after that. The only person I could imagine that would hurt her would be her ex-boyfriend who she broke up with about a month before she died, He was quick to anger and pretty dumb though I never thought he'd actually hit her much less kill her.

Without my mom around I was pretty reclusive, with none of my family around I stuck inside other than to take the trash out once a week. The house was essentially silent other than the sounds I made when walking or etc.

Until around January last year I heard the washing machine turn on suddenly, It had always been pretty shitty, my mom had it even before I was born. So the metallic death rattling and loud water gushing sounds were very shocking to hear. It sounded closer than the actual laundry room was and I didn't even notice till after I opened the washer and found it wasn't turned on, It didn't even have a drop of water in it. I was obviously pretty frightened, I tried unplugging it but it didn't stop the sound from happening. confusedly going back into my room I tried to sleep past it, thinking maybe the neighbor was doing their laundry this late at night for some ungodly reason. After I woke up the next day I heard nothing so I assumed it was just a bad dream and left the house for work.

Around mid February I noticed a talking sound coming from my moms room, and when I got closer it turned into a news broadcast that sounded like it was talking about a Snowstorm that was pretty brutal to my town 7 years ago, I was almost too scared to open the door, when I went in the sounds immediately stopped, as if they were hiding from me for some reason. My mom never had a Tv in her room and everything in her room was how she left it the night she died which scared me. I searched and found no one hiding in my house or around it, I searched everywhere except the crawlspace below my house. All of this started to really scared me, I never really believed in ghost but whatever was happening was making me start to believe.

The final straw for me was around a few months after that when I heard \*her\* laughing and talking to multiple people in the kitchen though I didn't hear anyone reply, I could hear it from the bathroom as I was brushing my teeth one night and I bolted, not even trying to stop and grab anything I owned. I found a cheap hotel and stayed there for the weekend. I got in contact with a realtor before Monday  began and sold the house as quickly as possible, I didn't try to grab anything from home after either, I only had what was in my pockets at the time I left.

unfortunately the sounds followed me wherever I went, I moved into an apartment in a city right outside of Colorado shortly after I sold the house I grew up in, but even still they fucking \*followed\* me, \*She\* followed me!

Almost every night I could hear knocks on my balcony door and frantic but quiet pleas to let her in, I knew it wasn't my mother or anyone I knew. I was the only one on my floor of the building and I lived on the fourth floor. So I tried my best to ignore it and go back to sleep every time. When I heard the balcony knocking stop and the latch for the lock on it's door open I knew I wouldn't sleep that night.

Slow heavy footsteps sounded through my living room, only a wall keeping me safe from whatever or whoever was in my apartment. I could hear the door to my bedroom jiggle a few times and then open, the door was pretty old and it creaked louder than any other noise I ever heard in my life. I had my eyes held shut and my blanket over my head like a little kid. When I peered out I saw a tall dark figure with inhuman grotesque anatomy puppeteering what looked like the corpse of a woman by one of its many many long gangly limbs. The corpse wasn't my making the sounds of my mother talking or anything like that, whatever demon holding that poor soul was.

I was too scared to make any noise, but it still turned as if it heard me gasp or scream, peering down at me as I got a good look at its horrid face. I looked like it was wearing the face of the corpse which had no face as it dangled from its, I think, Arm. What \*finally\* knocked some sense into me and got me to flee was the fact that the corpse had been wearing my mother's clothes, but they were horribly torn and bloodied along with the corpse itself. I somehow got away from it, It did chase me for a while but it wasn't that fast.

I've been moving from shitty motel to shittier motel for the last six or seven months, every time I heard \*her\* I'd run before I could even fall asleep. I bought a gun with the last of my savings and might need to start sleeping in my car soon.
