My wife and I have been married for six years, and we’ve always done the same kind of vacation — beaches, hotels, too many people. This year, I wanted something quieter. I told her, “Let’s just go somewhere peaceful. Somewhere we can hear ourselves think.”

I found this small cabin in northern Maine. The photos made it look perfect — pine trees, a little lake, one road in and out. I’m not the type to get paranoid, but I do like knowing what’s around me. So before we left, I even looked it up on Google Maps, checked reviews, everything. Nothing weird.

The first two days were great. We cooked, read, played cards. I remember saying to her that the silence there was the kind that makes you *listen* — you start noticing the ticking of your watch, the creaks in the walls, every distant sound.

On the third night, we both woke up around 2 a.m. because of footsteps on the deck.  
At first, I thought it was an animal. My wife squeezed my arm and whispered, “That’s not a raccoon.”

I got up, grabbed the flashlight, and looked through the window. Nothing. Just fog and trees. I went outside — barefoot, stupidly — but all I found were two sets of footprints on the deck. One was mine from earlier that evening. The other wasn’t.

They led down the steps… and stopped at the treeline.

I tried to calm her down. I told her it was probably the owner checking on the place. But in the morning, I called him anyway. He said he hadn’t been there in over a week.

That day, little things started bothering me. The back door — we always locked it, but it was open that morning. Some of our snacks were gone from the counter. My wife swore she hadn’t touched them, and I hadn’t either.

We tried to laugh it off. But that night, I woke up again — this time to the sound of something moving *inside* the cabin.  
It was faint, like fabric brushing wood.

I sat up, whispering my wife’s name, but she was already awake, staring toward the kitchenette.  
“Someone’s in here,” she mouthed.

I grabbed my phone for the flashlight, but before I could turn it on, there was a soft creak — right from the storage hatch in the ceiling. The attic.

I’d never opened it.

The next morning, I waited until daylight and pushed a chair under the hatch. My wife begged me not to. But I’m stubborn, and honestly, part of me *needed* to prove to myself it was nothing.

I opened it and climbed halfway up. The first thing I saw was a pile of clothes — not ours. A jacket, men’s jeans, a toothbrush. An empty can of beans.  
And next to all of it, wedged between the beams, was a small **Polaroid photo**.

It was taken from inside the cabin.  
I recognized the back wall, the lamp, the couch.  
And us — my wife and I — sitting together, reading, smiling.

We packed up that morning.

I didn’t tell her about the photo. I just said I wanted to leave early to “beat the weather.”  
But the whole drive home, I couldn’t stop thinking: if there’s one photo, there might be more.

And someone, somewhere, still has the camera.
