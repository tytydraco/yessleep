Have you ever wondered what your reflection does behind a mirror if it’s not being observed? Does it have thoughts? Does it have activities on its own? Does it have any emotions? Free will? Does it plot for your doom? Unfortunately, these questions are left unanswered because reflection does what it’s supposed to be doing whenever it’s being observed, to mirror your every move, to succumb to whatever you wanted it to do, whether it likes it or not.



Speaking of mirrors, I’m sure you know by now how to differentiate between one-way mirror vs two-way mirror. The trick is to touch the mirror and based on the distance between your finger & the reflection, you can tell what kind of mirror it is. If you can touch your own reflection, it’s a two-way mirror, and most likely there’s another person on the other side of the mirror looking through. If there’s a gap, then it is a true mirror, and you should be safe.



Now, here’s the thing. There’s a reason why there’s a gap between you and your reflection if you tried this method in front of a one-way mirror. It’s not about the layer of glass thickness or the reflective coating behind the glass, but it’s a force barrier created to keep things the way it’s supposed to be. It’s a protective barrier to keep the things inside the mirror from ever coming out.



What if I told you that there’s such a thing called a “false two-way mirror”? Like I mentioned above, if you touch a two-way mirror, you will be able to touch your own reflection. However, if you touch a false two-way mirror, in an instant, you will switch places with the being before you. That being will take over your body, your job, your family, your life, practically everything that you have. All of the above questions that are left unanswered, you will find out the truth once you are living inside that mirror.



How do I know? Well, I was once a victim of the body swapping…



It happened so quickly I almost didn’t realize it happened to me. All I remembered was, here is a random mirror in a bathroom stall. To satisfy my curiosity to find out if the mirror is see-through, I touched that dirty mirror with my index finger, and before I knew it, I lost control of myself, and everything around me is no longer what it’s supposed to be. All the words are mirrored, whatever I see on the right side before, now are on the left side. It gave me a major headache for a moment.



However, that was nothing compared to what’s going on afterwards. I realized that I have no control over my own body anymore. I was moving against my free will, I couldn’t control myself, and the next thing that happened was, I looked at myself in the mirror, brandishing a devilish look and an evil smile. It was so sinister, but so am I. I realized that I am also brandishing the same look and the same smile, but actually, I was hurting myself physically. It was so grotesque and wide that it felt like my mouth was about to be split open.



It feels like I’m in a trance. Everything that I do from that moment on is against my free-will. I soon found out that I am actually doing everything that my used-to-be reflection does. The only thing that I’m in control of is my own thoughts. Even when I’m not in front of any mirrors looking at the being that took over my body, I am still powerless to control myself. I am basically a puppet to my own reflection.



Here’s a weird discovery though. Everything in the mirror world that’s considered edible has the exact opposite taste. What used to be sweet is bitter in this world. Savory flavored foods became unsavory. It was pure torture, as the only thing that probably tastes good in this world is trash, but what are the chances my reflection is going to eat that?



Another discovery was, I have to reflect whatever my reflection wants to see in front of any weirdly shaped reflecting objects no matter what. If the reflecting object is bent in such a way that the reflection appears tall, I stretch my spinal column so that my body appears tall, and the pain is agonizing. If the reflection appears short, my spinal column is crushed so that I appear short. If there’s rain, my body separates into smaller pieces, and I move at a really fast pace from one place to another, resulting in the worst vertigo I’ve ever felt. All of these experiences are agonizing and truly the most painful experience, but I have no control over it.



I was basically in hell, accompanied by only my own thoughts. I can’t yell, ask for help, cry, run away, or escape from this nightmare. I can only count the days of how long I was trapped in this world. So far, it has been one month, and from the way my reflection takes over my life, it does not look like it has any idea of what it’s doing. It got me in trouble at my workplace, yelled at by my parents, fought with my girlfriend, and basically just slowly ruined my life.



After the second month, I started to lose hope, and I just started to let my mind wander, not caring anymore what my reflection does, until something fortunate happens. There it was, my reflection stared at me in front of a random mirror, taunting me, until a random stranger accidentally bumped it, and unknowingly touched the mirror, touching me. Just like that, in an instant, I escaped the mirror world, and my reflection was back where it belongs.



As soon as I realized I was back in my own body, living in my own world, taking back my life, I instantly broke down in tears. I didn’t realize that I was in a random public bathroom and people were staring, but I did not care. A wave of relief washes over me & I’m sure I gave time to my reflection to grief as well, for being back in the mirror world, where it belongs.



Unfortunately, the damage my reflection has done for the past two years is somewhat irreversible. I was laid off from my job, broke up with my girlfriend, and kicked out of my parents house, currently living in a car. However, this is minimal compared to being trapped inside the mirror world. I can still get another job, find another girlfriend, and repair the relationship with my parents, as long as I have control of my own body.



So, there you have it folks. While it’s important to check if there’s someone behind the mirror spying on you, it’s best to not make direct contact with any mirrors. Use an object as a medium between you and your reflection so that it won’t take over your life. Moreover, watch out for your surroundings, pay attention to any living beings around you. If they started behaving out of character, they might just be a reflection that has switched bodies with their humans. If your suspicions are accurate, then you know what to do to rescue your friends, but tread carefully. You don’t want to accidentally force your friends to live in that awful mirror world…
