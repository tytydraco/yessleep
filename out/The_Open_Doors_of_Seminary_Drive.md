*The following are four letters received by a friend of mine while he was in basic training.  After receiving the fourth letter, he sent all four to me, with no explanation, and is no longer responding to any attempts to communicate with him.  The sender of the first three letters is a coworker/friend of mine who went missing after the third letter, and the fourth is from...well, you'll see.  The letters have been formatted for readability and the names have been redacted, but they are otherwise unaltered.  There appears to have been some time between the second and third letter, but I don't know how long.  Friend in basic is A, sender of the first three letters is B, and the sender of the fourth letter is C.  I don't really know what to do with the information they contain, so I'm just going to post them online so people know: if you see a vacant house with an open door,* ***don't go inside.***   
   

Hey \[A\],  

Feels weird writing an actual letter. I don't think I've done that since we did those soldier letters in elementary school.  How's basic so far?  Is it like movies, with people yelling at you all the time?  You're made of stronger stuff than me for all that.  

You know that school I work at once a week, where you came to jump my car, spring semester of last year?  The one next to all the nice houses?  One of the houses kinda creeped me out today.  I figured since you and \[/u/OrgoneKillsVampires\] are into all that spirit/occult shit you might get a kick out of it.    
   

So when I parked in the neighborhood, I noticed a house that had the door wide open.  It was for sale, but it didn't look like a realtor was there, so I asked an old lady walking her dog about it.  She seemed concerned and said there were no open houses today, so she went to go check it out.    
   

When I came back after school, the door was still open.  Weird, right?  Are there supposed to be haunted places here?    
   

Anyhow, I hope you're doing well.  Tell me all the weird crap they're making you do, I'm curious.    
   \-\[B\]    
  

 Dude,  

I know you probably haven't even had time to respond to my first letter yet, but I had to update you on that creepy house.  Remember how I told you some old lady went to check it out?  Literally right after I dropped your letter in the mailbox, we got a local alert that an elderly person was missing.  It was HER.  Swear on my life man.       
   

I called up \[local police department\] and told them about the house with the open door, and that I had seen her right before she went missing heading into that house.  They went and checked it out, but couldn't find anything.  Said some schoolkids probably were messing around in there and left the door open, but they appreciated knowing where she was that morning.    
   

How fucking bizarre is that?    
   \-\[B\]    
  

 Hey \[A\],    
  

I'm writing to you while my little monsters are doing a project to update you on the creepy house.  Wait til you hear this: there was ANOTHER open door.  I asked a jogger about it, and she said it had been owned by the woman who disappeared.  Her family had been in the process of packing up her shit, and she said that they probably had just accidentally left the door ajar because they were making so many trips in and out.    
  

I'm gonna go and check up on it later.  I swear if I find out our students are fucking around in empty houses I'm gonna make them scrape gum for weeks.

Hello,  

My name is \[C\].  I run the occult store on \[redacted\], and do spiritual readings there. I want to start off by saying that *I* *don't want any money from you.*  I know people in my profession have a reputation for preying on grieving friends and family, but this is not a scam.       
   

Last night, I was contacted by a spirit named \[B\].  He is the one who told me how to reach out to you.  I looked him up and saw that his missing-persons case is still open, but this kind of letter isn't exactly something I can give to the police.  Your friend just wanted you to know what happened, and to warn you.    
  

He says that when he went into the house with the open door, he was suddenly in his own house, with no memory of how he got there.  He couldn't touch anything, or communicate with anyone, and sensed that there was something else present with him.    
  

Over the next few weeks, he learned that this thing feeds on people's grief and despair over the missing victim.  He said he could see their grief, like light blue steam coming off their bodies.  It rose up to the ceiling and disappeared into the dark corners, consumed by the presence.  He wonders if the family and friends are like “appetizers”, and he suspects he will be the “main course”.  This thing is increasing his despair by forcing him to watch his family suffer, like marinating a steak.    
  

He thinks the open door, once the family has packed up the house, is to lure its next victim.  He ended by saying that, when you return from basic training, you may drive past his house and find the door ajar.  *Do not go inside.*    
   

I know you may have follow-up questions, but honestly, this is far out of my comfort zone and I'd like for you to please not write back to me or come into my shop.  My usual readings are for people who want to know when they'll meet their significant other, or whether a career change would be beneficial.  This is a level of darkness that I don't want in my life.  I wish the best for you and everyone else involved in this situation, and will have you in my prayers.    
  

Sincerely,   

\[C\]  

*As I said, this is all the information I've received.  I agree with C that the police won't take the letter from a local psychic seriously, but her letter rings true to me.  I still have to work at the school near where this took place, and I need to figure out if I can warn my coworkers without sounding like a loon.*  

*I hope that publishing these letters prevents people from falling prey to the same evil presence as my friend, and if the missing persons/open doors thing sounds familiar to others, that they have an explanation as to what happened to their friend or family member.*

*Thank you for allowing me to post this here.*
