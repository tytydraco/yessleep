She was beautiful. Her skin fair. Her ocean blue eyes almond shaped, staring off into the distance. Her blonde hair depicted with skillfully placed threads as it flowed over her shoulders and past her waist. The flowy fabric of her white chemise that came all the way down to her ankles depicted in such detail that it looked real. She stood in what I can only describe as a forest, dark, and thick with trees, but…off. She seemed to glow in the gloom surrounding her. The tapestry was undoubtedly a masterpiece created by the most skilled of hands, and yet it was found in the neglected corner of an auction in a dusty old box, and purchased by me for seven quarters and a dime.

I look up at her proudly. I have saved her from the negligence she had received, and have given her a place where she will be cared for in my living room. As I sit on the couch and work, I can’t help but sneak occasional glances at the tapestry, a stupid grin unwillingly forming on my face. As the room begins to darken, I yawn and decide to prepare myself for bed.

I toss and turn. I have never had problems with sleep, and yet, sleep won’t come. I feel a longing. It pulls me out of bed. I stumble towards the living room. Towards her. Even in the darkness, I can see her mesmerizing carefully threaded eyes looking off into the distance. I carefully take her off of the wall and tiptoe back to my room, where I hang her up above my bed, and fall into a deep slumber under her watchful eyes.

I am in a forest, dark, thick with trees, but…off. A gloom blankets the forest. It is cold. Incredibly cold. I see my breath with every exhale. Something is here. Something is waiting in the swirls of darkness. Something I do not want to meet. I run. My breath grows ragged. The thing is close behind. My heart beats wildly, and yet, not fast enough. I cannot run. It is at my feet. I stumble. I fall and fall and fall; the earth has disappeared. I am in a forest clearing. 

I look up, the girl stands in front of me. She is the thing. She smiles. She is not beautiful. She is a monster. The flora around us begin to grow. She smiles. They reach towards me. She smiles. I feel a barbed vine wrap around my wrist. She smiles. I rip the vine away, tearing my skin. She smiles. The wood consumes me.

I gasp. I am in my bed. I look up at her. Her enchanting eyes all the same. My heart slows. Nothing but a dream. Nothing but a nightmare. As I look back down at my hands, I find the skin on my wrist torn and bleeding.

I look at the clock. 3:42. I look at her. She looks at me. I look at the clock. 6:52.

I close my eyes. All I can see is her. I open my eyes. All I can see is her.

She has consumed me.

I am outside. I clutch her in my hand, a box of matches in my other hand. It is cold. It is dark. She is on the ground. I light a match. The fire is warm. The fire is bright. 

I hoped to rid of her.

But she will never leave me.

I will never be free.
