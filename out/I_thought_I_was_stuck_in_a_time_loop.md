Hi all. This just happened to me so I am still collecting myself, so please bear with me please. I should also say I have a terrible memory so I will definitely leave some things out. This is also my first post here. And I am not too good with words. 
 
There are some things you should know about me before we start. I hardly dream, like maybe twice a month at most, sometimes I don't dream at all through the month. I can't imagine things and see them like some people can, I just see black when I close my eyes. I have never lucid dreamed or anything of the sort, I don't do drugs beside weed. 

So, i crushed my weed and rolled a relatively small joint, I went outside and smoked it. When I came back inside my ears started ringing, and over time it got louder and louder, and higher pitched. Then I started to feel a sharp pain in my chest. And when I looked up from the couch that I sat on when this happened, my vision started to sort of swirl to a point in the middle of my vision and as everything was swirling my vision got clearer and clearer, sort of like I could see colors more vividly(I am near sighted, and I'm not sure if I had my glasses on at this time). That's what I saw, but what I felt like I was being sucked to this point as the light in my vision was, like a small black hole. But as this was happening I felt like time was slowing down, then stopped, then the swirls started moving in the opposite direction, and it felt like time was moving backwards. The whole time I was in pain and the paint in my chest was getting worse and worse. This happens the entire time. 

The whole time I was freaking out, my feelings were looping going from extremely happy, sort of a blissfull feeling to worried to scared to sad and other things that I can't remember. But the scary thing about that was the entire time I was trying to figure out what was going on and and those thoughts were looping and my emotions was connected to that loop. The loop of thoughts went as follows : what's happening, why is this happening, how can I stop it, calm down, ok you're doing better, calm down you're getting to excited(x5-7). However for some reason I believed that I was during an doing to heaven because of how good I was feeling at times, I felt complete, content, and super happy. Something like that. Know this is happening the entire experience.

I ended up coming to the conclusion that I was stuck in a time loop and decided I needed to break it, so I got up to make a sandwich. I walked past my step mom and talked to her because she asked me what was going on, what did I smoke, did I fake anything else and stuff like that. I said no, I said I was stuck in a time loop, she was like what the fuck I'm gonna call you dad. When I got to the kitchen I decided to make popcorn, so I got a pot and put oil in and put in the stove. Then I get a glass of water to quench my thirst. I start drinking it and watching tiktok, after some time my step mom came back inside and wanted to talk to me, the entire time I'm trying to tell her not to worry because I'm totally fine, and she was genuinely scared for me. During this time I'm thinking that I'm dying and that this is all going to go away and I'm going to excend to heaven and shit. My step mom then points out that the oil is burning and I say I Wil handle it, and then my body starts moving on its own.

I tunr off the stove and grab my glass of water and pour it in the pot, fill up the water, pour it in the pot, I did this until the pot was half full, during this time I was extremely scared because I thought this was hell and my punishment was feeling paraoint and scared and such a large mix of emotions because ei could not control my thoughts. I was spirilxing out of control because my thoughts were looped and I couldn't get out of it, then I had control over my body again. Then I made a sandwich and walked to the couch to lie down. 

I my walk to the couch time felt at it was moving backwards, and it felt like my dody was folding from inside out and my mind was imagining my mody being ripped apart by this and it felt extremely painful. By the time I lied down on the couch I had excepted the fact that I was stuck in this hell and calmed down a little bit. Because I calmed down a bit I decide to search on tiktok for videos explaining how to get out of a lucid dream because to me this situation seemed so surreal and fictional at the same time the only solution I had was that this was a dream. Then I got up to go to my room and my body started moving on it's own again and I started running to my room and I rolled on my bed fell off of it and then ran back out and to the lounge, I did this about 3 times before my step mom came into my room to try and figure out what was going on. 

At that time I was laying on my bed, the lower part of my body was on the bed and the top half was over the edge. Then time felt like it was moving super fast and then it stopped and I felt a change. Then I got up super excited and started freaking out because for some reason I had deja vu and what came after that part I remembered seem to be that somehow my life was complete and I was living my life backwards somehow. And I was In heaven of sorts. Then I sat my step mom down after I calmed down and tild her that I was reliving my life and reincarnation exists and blah blah blah, at some point she started asking questions and I had no answer and the after about 5 minutes my thoughts handed up looping again and I spiraled down again in terms of my thoughts and became depressed. 

I went back to the lounge and decided to try sleep. My thought ran wild and got worse, my breathing was getting worse, I felt like I was having a panic attack because I realised I was stuck in hell. I ended up falling asleep at some point, and when I woke up I didn't feel any of this again. 

This entire situation was terrifying and scary, painful and calm, I felt the happiest I have ever felt in my entire life, to the point of tears, I also felt the most depressed I have in my entire life. I'm not sure why this happened. 

Thank you for reading, I'm willing to answer any questions about this situation so please ask.
