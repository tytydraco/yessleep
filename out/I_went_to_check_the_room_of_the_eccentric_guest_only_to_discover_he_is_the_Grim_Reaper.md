​I am Nick. I’ve been working as a housekeeper in a hotel for about a month now. We have a guest—an eccentric, mysterious old man named Samuel. I rarely see him. Every time it’s time to clean his room and I head there, he intercepts me and refuses to let me in.

​But he just left about fifteen minutes ago. This means he won’t be back anytime soon, so I took the leap and decided to go take a look at the room. I got permission from my supervisor and took the key to his room; Room 036. I climbed to the first floor, my heart pounding with every step. I stood before the door. I opened it, and a strange, heavy stench filled my nostrils—worse than the smell of rotting corpses.

​I entered the room. It was spotless. I don’t believe I cleaned it, and even if I had, I’m not that efficient. No one is. I work alone now; well, I became alone after my two colleagues died.

Ethan: Died last week in a car accident.
Sarah: Died a week before him of a heart attack, even though she was perfectly healthy.

​I headed toward the bedroom, but before glancing at it, I followed the source of the stench into the bathroom. It was impeccably clean; nothing there could possibly emit that smell. Did he forget to flush? I scanned the entire bathroom. Nothing suspicious, except for a dark stain in the washbasin. It wasn't blood; blood isn't that viscous. But that stain was the source of that smell.

​I moved to the bedroom and opened the drawers. Nothing. They were completely empty. I decided to leave, but on my way out, I realized I hadn't checked the wardrobe. A debate sparked between my heart and my mind. My mind won; I decided to go for it. I grabbed the two doors and pulled them toward me.

​Instead of clothes on the shelf, I found a dark black cloth covering the surface, with a massive book resting on top. A black book with a leather cover—but what kind of leather, I don't know. There were no drawings on the cover, only engravings; as if someone had taken a knife and slashed the leather to carve those strange symbols and that number in the middle: 666.

​I opened the cover and found a dedication to the "God of Hell." The page was bizarre, looking like the scorched earth of the underworld, and the script was fiery and cracked. I turned the page. Total shock. A picture of Sarah. Underneath was her name and her mother’s: Sarah, daughter of Yvonne.

Date of Death: Thursday, 1-8-2026.
Cause of Death: Heart attack.
​The exact day she died. The exact cause of death. Is he a fortune teller who knows death? Or is he the one who chooses it? I turned the page, and as expected, I found him: Ethan, son of Lara, with his picture at the top.

Date of Death: Thursday, 1-15-2026.
Cause of Death: Car accident.
​The same precise information. Wait... Thursday? It wasn't a coincidence. I swallowed hard as I turned the next page. It was me. A picture of me: Nick, son of Lauren.

Date of Death: Thursday, 1-22-2026.
The curse! Three days from now. He is the one who sets the time of the kill. Before I could look at how I would die, I heard the click of the main room door. My heart began to race. I slammed the book shut, closed the wardrobe, and rushed out of the bedroom only to find him entering. He caught me in the living room, where I pretended to be cleaning.

​"Mr. Samuel. How are you? You’re back early," I said with forced calmness, looking at him.

"What are you doing here?" he asked in a voice void of emotion.

"I..." I said, hiding my trembling nerves, "I came to do my job, but it seems you’ve already taken care of it."

He said, "Fine. Leave."

​I headed toward the door, clutching my cleaning supplies. I froze in my tracks when he said, "Boy. Why are you so pale and drenched in sweat?"

I looked at him with a fake smile. "It’s nothing. You just startled me with your sudden entry."

He said, "Fine, Nick. I wish you a happy life."

​I left the room knowing when I will die, but how? I have no idea. Three days. I don't know whether to hide or what to do. Is this fate? I don't know whether to go back to that room, run far away, or just wait for my death.
