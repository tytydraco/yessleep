this happened last night and i still can’t shake it. i had this dream that felt so real i woke up in full panic and then forced myself to go back to sleep just to keep it going. it didn’t feel like a dream at all. it felt like a memory or a warning or something

it started off with a mom and her daughter lying in bed. the mom was reading a bedtime story and the room had this really calm warm vibe. big window behind the bed looking out into the woods. pitch black outside except for this huge bright full moon lighting up all the trees. it looked like late fall. trees were dead, brown, no snow though

eventually the daughter falls asleep. the mom closes the book and leaves the room to go downstairs and get a glass of water. super quiet. nothing weird yet

but then the camera i know that sounds weird but it felt like a movie the camera pans outside through the window and into the woods

and one of the trees moves. it doesn’t shake like wind it just shifts. a subtle lean like it had legs

meanwhile the mom’s in the kitchen. she’s filling a glass at the sink and looking out another window at the backyard and the same woods are behind the house. and she sees it. one of the trees has a weird split at the bottom like legs. it’s standing way too straight and it’s pale like dead wood

she doesn’t even go outside. she just kind of stares at it like she’s trying to see if she’s imagining it. and then it sees her. calmly. all of a sudden about 10 of the creature but smaller like maybe only 9 feet tall run straight toward the house. the mom screams

then more of them come. same tall weird figures all different heights. some crawl on all fours some stand upright. no faces. just pale and stretched

the mom tries to run but before she moves one of them smashes through the glass sliding door and grabs her. no sound. it just rips her apart like she’s made of paper. no struggle

upstairs the daughter wakes up. she hears nothing. she doesn’t even go look. she grabs her phone and hides in her closet immediately. like she knew what was happening. like she’s done this before

she calls 911 whispering and crying. the operator tries to calm her but she says there’s something in the house and her mom is gone. the operator tells her to stay on the line and help is on the way

a few minutes later two cops show up. she hears the door creak. hears footsteps. she’s still hiding in the closet whispering updates to the operator

then all hell breaks loose. the creatures ambush the cops. tear them apart instantly. no fight. but not before one of them yells something over the radio. something like “they’re not human” and then static

outside more are standing in the yard. not moving. like statues. watching the house. waiting

a helicopter comes. shining a spotlight. the creatures look up. no reaction. then the gunfire starts. the spotlight flashes over them and you see they’re changing. adapting. getting more aggressive. they jump straight at the helicopter. one of them lands on it mid air and pulls the rotors apart. the chopper spins and crashes in the woods and everyone inside is dead. except the creature. it evolved to withstand the crash on the spot.

then the dream shifts. now it’s me

i’m in my own house. in my room. same time of night. i hear something outside and look through the window and i see them. they’re in my neighborhood. walking calmly between houses. i grab my phone. i can’t call anyone. no signal. my lights won’t turn on. power’s dead. i hear screams from a few streets over

then i realize it’s not the same place anymore. this was happening (like the cabin part) in maybe rural usa because the soldiers had american patches. this is manitoba now. where i live. they’ve already crossed the border. it’s spreading

i hear a window break downstairs. my brother yells once. then silence. i crawl into the cabinet under the sink. heart racing. can’t breathe

it goes quiet for hours. i hear footsteps. sometimes they stop outside the cabinet. i can hear them breathing or maybe not breathing at all i don’t even know

eventually i sneak outside. hide in a bush for two days. no food. no movement. i couldn’t run or hide or do anything. they were everywhere. they don’t patrol. they don’t talk. they just stand still and appear somewhere else later

i finally made a run for it when someone in a car got their attention. i made it to a nearby military base. they let me in. there were maybe 50 people inside. they told us they weren’t sure what these things are. maybe not aliens. maybe not creatures. something else. something old. something that’s been watching us long before we ever knew they existed

they think the creatures don’t even want anything. they’re not trying to invade. they’re trying to replace. and they hate us. they said stuff like “we are your gods you are our belongings”

and they evolve. the more we fight the smarter they get. like a virus. like they learn from every attack. nothing works twice. they get faster. stronger. they hide in human skin now. one soldier said he watched his whole team die because one of the creatures pretended to be a survivor

the last part of the dream i was underground in a hidden part of the base with a few other people. we thought we were safe. we really thought we were finally away from them

then the lights flickered. one of them was already in the base

it just walked in. didn’t even run. just walked from person to person and pulled them apart. it didn’t speak this time. just watched

i hid behind some crates. it didn’t see me

when it finished it didn’t even try to find a way out. it looked up at the ceiling and started digging. just straight up. in a perfect square tunnel. and it left. again this was a dream so i don’t know why it would be a perfect square but here we are

then i woke up

i had chest pain. head pain. like i had been screaming all night but i wasn’t. i was completely still. i felt like i had died and come back. like i had lived through the whole thing. it wasn’t a nightmare it was something else

i’ve had weird dreams before but this one feels different. i keep checking the trees outside my window. keep waiting for one of them to lean the wrong way

if you ever see something out there that looks human but isn’t don’t run
don’t move
don’t blink
and don’t let them see you
