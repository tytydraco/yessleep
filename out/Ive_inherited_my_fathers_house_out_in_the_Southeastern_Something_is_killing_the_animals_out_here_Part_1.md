I’ll try to make this as short as I can but just understand there’s a lot. At the end of November, my father died after falling off the 3rd story roof of his house. It was an accident; he had lost his footing and struck his head right on the edge of the patio. The only sense of comfort was that he died instantly, terrible but instant. My aunt was the one to call me, I had just gotten back to my apartment after a long day of work when she called me. My Aunt Lucy is an emotional woman; I’ve seen her cry and sob more times than I can count. But this, this was pure, anguish. She was scream crying, yelling “He’s dead he’s dead he’s dead!” It took me a few minutes to calm her down enough to tell me that my father was dead. 

Two weeks later was the funeral, which was most of the same thing my aunt began crying 30 seconds into her eulogy. I had to bring her outside and calm her down, I held her for a few minutes, and talked her back down to just a sniffling mess. Like I said before my Aunt is overly emotional, It started when my grandma died when I was 7. I remember she wouldn't leave her house for a whole 4 months after the funeral. She loved everyone in our family more than anyone I know, and it was clear she loved my father the most.

When we went back inside, the service had ended, and everyone was now in the lunch area. Besides me and my aunt, there were 15 other people who had come for the funeral. Mostly old coworkers of my father, nobody I knew, except for Randy. Randy was my fathers neighbor, and the person who found my dad. He walked up to my and my Aunts table, quickly said his condolences, and told us that if we ever needed any help, then just call him. I had met Randy a few times before this, mostly in little parties held by my father at his home. I’ll explain in a moment but yes, I’ve been to the house many, many times before. 

After this was the actual burial, which was just the same as before, Aunt Lucy cried, and I was ready to go home. And I did, at this point I lived in Denver, and I didn’t want to deal with traffic, so while everyone went to my Aunts house for the after party. I just drove back to Denver. But when I got home, just like that November night, I got another call. Once again it was my Aunt, but instead of crying, or asking why I didn’t go to her house. She explained to me that she had just gotten My Dad’s will. Stated at the end of the will was a single sentence, a sentence that would curse me. 

“For Leo, He will receive my home out in the County.”

Fast forward another week, and I now have the keys to the property. And the part where this story starts. Sorry about that exposition piece. I felt it was important to start with for you to understand why I’m here. I loved my dad, and this house was his passion project. I remember when he bought in 7 years ago, I was 19 and going to CSU Fort Collins. So while I never saw the house in its original state, I saw it a few times wherever I came for Chiasmas or thanksgiving. The house is located 3 miles off Highway 50 in Colorado, right between Pueblo and Rocky Ford. The closest piece of civilization was Nepesta, a small-town right off the highway. The land was mostly flat, with fields of grass and dirt as far as the eye can see. Behind the house about 50 yards away was the Arkansas river, which was surrounded by a thin tree line. And out west you can see the Rocky Mountains. From here they were only a faint blue, but you can make out the 3 major ranges of Southern Colorado. Pikes peak, The Spanish/twin peaks, and Greenhorn Mountain. The house itself was beautiful, made up of three sections, the main section being three stories, with a large patio that has a canopy that you could pull out during the winter. The inside had . The other 2 sections were wings of the main area, both two stories. The right wing was a garage, with the second floor being a storage space. While the left wing was an entertainment area, 2 pool tables, a dart board, and a makeshift movie theater. In summary, it was a nice house. 


Now here’s when things get strange, I’ve been staying at the house for about a week now. Mostly maintenance and keeping the place cleaned. I was in the backyard, raking leaves that had fallen from the trees when I smelt something, it was faint, but unmistakable. It was the smell of death, no other way to describe it. Despite how faint it was, I still covered my face with my hand. I followed the smell, leading me about 100 yards East, just at the tree line. There, I found the body of a Coyote, its stomach had been cut open, the entrails of the wild dog had been pulled out of the animals, leaving the animal as a husk. I steered at the carcass for several seconds. Almost gagging but not at the sight, but at the scent. That smell was in full force now, invading my nostrils and taking over every thought. I always heard people describe the smell of rotting corpses as something you’d never forget. Something that even if you’ve never heard of it, you knew what it was. 

I didn’t think about what did this to the Coyote, or why the cut didn’t look like bite marks of any other animal. I wanted the smell gone, now. I went back to the house, grabbing a shovel and mask from the garage. And dug a grave for it, right next to where I found the body. Once done, I gently shoved the body into the pit with the head of the shovel. Doing my best to hold back the eggs and hashbrowns I had eaten that morning from shooting up and adding to the stench. But I got it in and covered it up, patting the ground with the shovel and stared at it. All remaining evidence of the animals was the blood stained grass just 2 feet away. 
I assumed somebody had come onto the property and killed it. But now, and even as I walked away, I knew this was a lie. The cut was too clean, and why not take the body? If it was a poacher, I doubt they’d kill it by cutting its stomach and taking its guts. It all just didn’t sit right with me. 

That night, while in the mini theater watching Warfare. I heard a sharp, painful scream from outside. I couldn't tell if it was a man or woman's scream, but it could make out that it was a painful scream. My first thought was that it was from the movie, but as I stared at the door that led to the backyard, I felt my throat tighten up. Like somebody was grasping my throat tightly, choking me with no intent to let go. It wasn’t until a second scream 15 seconds after the first one that I realized I was holding my breath. I instantly rushed for the door, expecting somebody to be outside maybe 10 feet away from the door. But when I opened it, the screaming suddenly stopped. Now, the only sounds were the Arkansas flowing East, and the movie. It was 8:00 pm, so the sun had already set some time ago. My only light source being the ones from the theater, which illuminated maybe 5 feet around the door. Everything past that was pinch black, with only the silhouette of trees standing out against the slightly cloudy night sky. I stood in the doorway waiting for one more scream. I thought that maybe if it happened again, I’d be able to pinpoint where it was and find the person. But it never came, I waited for 30 seconds but nothing came. So I went back inside and closed the door. sufficiently freaked out, I decided to close the door. So I grabbed the theater remote and turned it off the T.V. 

At that exact moment, I heard something run up to the door, and shortly after

Tap…Tap…Tap…

Something was knocking on the door. My head instantly shot over to the door. My entire body went cold as I imagined what was on the other side. I could feel my heart beating like a war drum, and my breathing stopped once again, forcing me to take deep breaths. This paralysis of fear was only broken after whatever was outside knocked again, the same Tap…Tap…Tap… as before. I slowly walked up to the door, grabbing one of the cue sticks from the rack, hoping I could use it as a weapon against whatever was outside. I’d clear my threat before yelling out as masculine and confident as I could, although it was still obvious that I was scared. 

“Who are you? What do you want?”

There was a moment of silence for a moment before whatever was outside started pounding on the door. It shaked and bulged against its frame, looking like it was about to break. This was when any sense of sensible thought left my mind. I dropped the cue stick, scrambling  out of the wing into the main part of the building. I thought that if I looked behind me, I’d see some monster from a horror movie, my mind conjuring dozens of creatures. These stayed in my mind until I got to the master bedroom. I locked the door, and placed a chair under the door knob. Hoping it could barcode me from whatever it was. I stared at the door for a minute, waiting to hear any footsteps or banging noises from outside. I imagined the werewolf running through my house, tracking my scent. I imagined the creature from the black lagoon walking into my kitchen, its slimy body leaving a trail everywhere it went. These thoughts filled my mind like a river flowing into the ocean. And before I knew it, I ended up watching that door for 15 minutes. I only broke out of my daze because I had gotten a phone call. I didn’t answer it, instead letting it go to voicemail as I got into bed. Even though I wouldn't sleep, I figured I’d at least get comfy. So, I laid there watching the door until by some miracle, I fell asleep. 

I woke up late the next morning, the memory of what happened the day before still fresh in my memory. I walked downstairs and into the left wing. The door that led outside had a large crack in it. The hinges were loose against the drywall. Opening the door, I was immediately met with the same rotting smell as with the coyote. This time it was much, much closer. I gagged, covered my face with my hand. When I looked out, I immediately saw the cause of the smell. Just in front of the tree line laid the corpse of another Coyote. Killed in the same way as the one the day before. Now fresh, the smell of iron rich blood filled my nostrils. Its face stuck in a painful snarl.

That was the final straw, I got into my car and drove to my aunt's house where I’m currently at. It’s been three days since that night, and I don’t plan on going back for another few days. I called the police and explained what happened, they just said it was probably some homeless guy trying to break in. When I asked about the screaming and him banning on my door. They just brushed it off as the guy being on drugs. This wasn’t good enough for me though, I don’t think whatever was outside my house was some druggy. And that's why, I’m going back to the house. It’s stupid but this house meant too much to my dad. And I don’t want to just sell it, so right now I’m just going to do research and buy cameras to put around the property. I’ll update you all in a few days. I hope this is a drug addict, I haven’t gotten any sleep, and I don’t want to steal all my aunts Morning coffee.
