“I love you too, I’ll see you tonight.”

I stepped out the door at 6:34 on Monday, waving to my wife from the sidewalk as she headed back inside, presumably to grab another cup of tea and get our daughter, Olivia, fed and ready for daycare before she left for the train.  

We moved to Brookhaven, from Southern California five years ago.  We were ready to start a family and we just couldn’t get on firm ground in SoCal, so when my wife got a job offer in Brookhaven, we jumped at the chance.  My in-laws have settled into their golden years nearby, so we bought a place five minutes from em, popped out a kid, and haven’t looked back.

I’m luckier than most.  While I can’t work from home, I can walk to work, door to door, in twenty minutes flat.  I struggled my first two winters here, but walking year round has thickened up my California blood, those dorks are right, there isn’t bad weather, just bad clothing! I start the day with some fresh air and exercise, and the quiet calm gives me time to decompress after a long day at the station.  I’ve made it a point to leave my phone alone in my bag, and my headphones out of my ears.  For forty minutes a day, I’m afforded the opportunity to disconnect, to feel the air and sun on my face, to hear the birds chirp and squirrels fight, to simply exist where I am. 

I began walking south, it was a brisk September day, one that requires a jacket for the morning walk, and room in my bag for said jacket on the walk home.  My neighbor Scott, from two houses down, was loading up his work van as I walked by.  4 inch PVC pipe, bonding, fittings, and a shovel.  I’m guessing drainage project. 

“Morning Scott, what’s todays gig?”

“Sump pump discharge.” He replied.  Nailed it!

“There are worse days for it, have a good one!”

“You too.”

I continued walking, passing the dozen or so houses on my street before rounding the corner and heading east.  The north side of the road continued the sprawl of single family homes, but the south side’s residences were cut short by a small, naturalized prairie.  Indiangrass and big bluestem dominated the landscape.  Drifts of purple gentians, yellow goldenrod and orange prairie dock gave color to the otherwise muted hues of the prairie grass.  Ahead, the street continued east over the river.  Just before the bridge, a pedestrian crossing split the road.  I crossed the road and followed the limestone path, heading south.  To my left, the river meandered lazily, its shoreline crowded with tall grass and sedges, lobelia and swamp milkweed.  Occasional clearings reached the river for benches and water access.  River birches and black walnut trees hung over the water, the rockbed occasionally breaking the surface, creating turbulence in the current.  

As I continued down the path, the prairie on my right gave way to mature, dominating oaks, maples and sycamores, separated by manicured lawn; a beautiful, curated savannah.  The river bended further east before passing under another bridge, marking the end of the park. A playground and gazebo sat in the triangle created by the river, bike path and street, and the savannah on my right thinned into a large clearing, useful for whatever large clearings are needed for. 

A single car was parked along the southern boulevard, an old, red Honda hatchback.  In the clearing, a stout, short woman moseyed in the well maintained field, some hybrid of shepard and retriever bounded toward her, frisbee in mouth.  The woman bent over the dog, wrestling the disc from its grasp.  The moment the dog lost tug-of-war it took off, into the clearing, ready for the next toss.   The woman flung the disc.  The dog tracked the frisbee, sprinting at top speed before leaping and snatching it out of the air.  What a catch!

The woman clapped her hands, smiling.  She turned and noticed me, I was still over 100 feet away but smiled at her, and shot a thumbs up.  She stopped, glanced at her watch and whistled for her dog.  “Cmon Reggie, time to go!” she called.

Reggie trotted up to her.  She quickly attached his leash and shuffled to the lone car.  She popped open the rear and Reggie hopped in, the hatch closing quickly behind him.  The engine started, and before I knew it they were on their way.  I guess she was running late, good on her for finding some time for her dog.

I crossed the road.  East, across the river, began downtown.  On this side of the river, a small plaza, composed of a corner restaurant, a boutique and my favorite cafe, The Coffee House, flanked the south side of the road.  Outside The Coffee House, half a dozen tables spread out, all empty at this early hour save for a lone employee, Steve, a college age barista, wiping the morning dew off the tables.  A small table outside the entrance had half a dozen cups on it, holding online orders for commuters before they caught their train into the city.  I gave Steve a nod, and headed west.  I crossed the street and waved my badge at the entrance to the police headquarters, heading into work.

Monday night was fun.  I met some buddies at The Lamplighter, a small bar downtown.  We watched the Bears blow another strong lead.  God I am so glad I’m not a Bears fan, but they sure are fun to watch with genuine Bears fans.  I swear my friend’s blood pressure spiked 80 points in that last quarter. I got home around 10, and only had three beers, but between being a dad and being in my late 30s, I’m paying for it today.  It took 3 hits of the snooze alarm before I mustered the strength to pull myself out of bed.

I got out the door at 6:55.  My truck was sitting in my driveway, I could probably make it if I drove, but I’d rather bribe my coworker Mark to cover for me.  A coffee is a fair price to pay to get my morning stroll in.  I shot him a text and ordered two Americanos from The Coffee House.  

Across the street, The Garons had their American flag waving proud and high.  Last year, under that same flag, flew Trump 2024.  I have to remind myself the Garons are good folks, despite their political ideals.  Leslie brought us a beautiful bouquet and delicious homemade lasagna when we had to put our dog down earlier this spring, and she knows we’re a house of bleeding heart liberals.  They’re a part of our community, and I’m glad they’re here, even if they are a bunch of God damn republicans.

Kids gathered at the corner, waiting for their bus.  I saw Bennett, my neighbor’s 8 year old son, staring into space.  I gave him a little bump, “Our deal still stands Benny Boy, you beat me in one Mario Kart race, you, me, your dad and Olivia get ice cream.  My treat.”

“I’ve been practicing!  You’re going down!”  He shouted as he punched me in the arm.

“I’ll believe it when I see it!”  I yelled back as I made my way around the corner.  That kid’s never gonna beat me.

As I headed down the park path, I watched a great blue heron in the shallow, flowing river.  It stood virtually motionless, it’s focus on the water.  Suddenly it lunged it’s head toward the water.  It raised it’s head, a fish impaled on it’s bill, blood dripping down it’s long neck.  The fish flailed briefly before going limp, succumbing to the deathblow.  Brutal.  I continued along the path.  Ahead, I could see the old red Honda from yesterday, parked along the curb ahead.  I looked to my right, and saw the owner treading along the perimeter of the prairie, Reggie on lead, sniffing asters and goldenrod.  A bumblebee flew near Reggies head, Reggie pulled back and nipped at it.  The owner turned and noticed me, bracing her hands on Reggies leash.  I waved and called to her, “Beautiful dog.”

Reggie looked up and barked in return, jumping, constrained against the leash, begging to be petted, to play, but she said nothing.  She turned quickly, pretending not to see me.  She shuffled away from the path, dragging the dog into the savannah.  That was weird, I guess she’s just really shy.  I continued south, to the end of the park, glancing at her car as I walked across the road. An old Bernie 2016 sticker adorned her bumper, a “coexist” just to the right of it, and on the opposite end a sticker that said “Please be patient, I’m just a girl”.  I chuckled.  At least we think the same!  

I passed The Coffee House, snatching mine and Mark’s coffees off the to-go table, and headed into work.

I took the next day off, and took Liv to the park that morning.  I stood at the base of the playground.  Above me, Olivia stood at the top of the ‘big kids slide’, as she calls it.  I tried to reassure her, “You can do it, love.  I’m right here, daddy’s got you.” She grabbed the sides of the slide and squatted, but I could see fear bubbling up in her.  She stood back up and backed away from the slide.  “It’s okay to be afraid Liv, just try it again in a minute.”

Two boys, a bit older than Liv, were running around the elevated play paths, playing tag.  They were rough, and had no regard for my two year old trying to conquer her fears.  I glanced at their mother, she was in her late twenties and had her nose in her phone, completely oblivious to the chaos her boys were creating.  Classic Gen Z mom behavior.  I guess I’m gonna have to parent these kids too.  “Hey!”  I barked at the boys, “careful around the little kids!”  They froze, eyes wide, stunned by a stranger telling them what to do.  

Their mom perked up, “Don’t speak to them like that!”  She yelled from her bench.

“Get off your phone and pay attention.” I responded, dismissively.

She scoffed and called the boys over, they headed for the SUV parked nearby.  “Some people are so rude!” She exclaimed, opening the car door for her little hellions.  Don’t let the door hit ya on the way out, lady!  

I focused my attention back on Olivia.   “Let’s try it one more time.”  She approached the slide cautiously.  I positioned myself at the base of the slide and reached out to her.  “You’ve got it baby girl.  I’m here to catch you.”  She was clearly nervous, but sat down, her feet dangling down the angle of the slide.  “Give yourself a little push, it’ll be just like when we go down together!”  She took a breath and inched forward, little by little, until gravity grabbed hold and began to drag her down the slide.  Her body was thrown back by the momentum, and she grimaced the entire ride down, bracing her body with her elbows.  I caught her at the bottom and picked her up, her grimace turned to elation.  “Again!” she cried.

After another 20 rides down the big kid’s slide we loaded into the stroller and headed for The Coffee House.  We’ve earned some java and a pastry.

Inside, a room-spanning industrial pipe chandelier, light bars integrated into the pipes at irregular intervals, cast a warm glow onto a large, beerhall-style walnut table.  The table was split by a succulent planter that ran the length of the table, and customers chatted with one another or typed away on their laptops.  Artwork from the Brookhaven High School Art Department (Go Cats!) decorated the walls.  The Shins played at low volume, drowned out by quiet chatter of customers and the pulverizing of beans in coffee grinders.  Steve waited behind the counter, his expression vacant.  I walked up to the register, “Hey Steve!  I’ll have my usual, and she’ll have a croissant.”  I said, pointing to Olivia in the stroller.  

“Hey man….  You’re gonna have to remind me what your usual is…”  Steve said, glancing at his coworker leaning on the counter.

“Sorry, thought you might’ve remembered me, I’m in here most days.”  Come on dude, remember your regulars.  “An Americano, splash of oat milk please.”

“Sure thing man.”

I meandered to the order pickup counter, looking around the cafe.  Ian, a city council member, sat chatting with a middle-aged woman.  “How are we doing councilman?”  I said, walking to their table.

“Tyler, hello.  Good, just having a meeting.  This is Sara, she works with city legal.”

I extended my hand, “Nice to meet you!  I knocked on doors for the Councilman two years ago.  So now he owes us at the police station a big raise on our next contract!” I said, laughing.

She shot Ian a quick look.

“I kid, I kid” I said.  “I’m just happy to help people who wanna do good for our city.”

She shook my hand and smiled “Well, nice to meet you”.

“Good seeing ya Tyler, have a good one.”  Ian said.

“You too!”

I walked back to the stroller as Steve motioned to me.  “Here’s your drink, man” he said with a smirk, handing me my cup and a baggie with Olivia’s croissant.  I headed for the exit and took a swig, “Mr Brookhaven” was written on the side of my cup.  I glanced back to the counter to see Steve and his coworker look away and laugh.  Fucking kids, I thought to myself.  

It was about 11, still an hour or so before lunch and naptime.  Once Olivia was down for her nap I had a hole in the drywall to patch, wasn’t looking forward to that.  I opted to take the scenic route back to our house, to stretch the morning a bit further.  We walked up the main road to my neighborhood, a residential street connecting vehicle traffic from downtown.  Lost Prophets blared from my headphones.  The avenue is flanked with houses on the east side, and apartments on the west.  The guys at work say the apartments, Armpit Acres, they call em, is the hood of Brookhaven, but they really aren’t a big deal.  Sure there’s the occasional odor of cannabis, and last winter a maintenance worker was stabbed in the neck, but the guy lived, we got a guy in custody, and the domestic calls we run there are no different than the ones we have in the mansions south of downtown.  Most of those folks in Armpit Acres moved to our town for the same reason we moved here, to raise their kids in a stable, safe town with good schools.

I passed the garden style apartments, their balconies overlaid with planters, folding chairs, kids bikes and “Class of 2026” signs.  The parking lot was only half full, only the beater cars remained, with their beater owners presumably contributing to the smell of marijuana.  Among them was the red Honda that I’d seen at the park the last few days.  So here’s where miss antisocial lives…

It was just shy of 6:40 when I left the house on Thursday, not ideal but I’d still make it in time.  Olivia woke up early this morning, 5:30, and would not stop whining.  She asked for cereal for breakfast, but when it was in front of her she changed her mind.  Same with apple slices and yogurt.  I guess she’s proof that one can live off God damn pop tarts.

I hurried down the street and onto the path through the park.  I could feel the tension in my shoulders, I needed to calm down.  What kind of man lets a two year old get under his skin.  I slowed my pace and looked at the trees of the distant savannah.  I noticed the gentle upward arches of the maples branches, the leaves at the top just starting to tint orange with the impending fall.  I followed the sharp angles of an oak’s massive limbs, showcasing the strength of the wood.  The rough morning began to fade into distant memory.  Two cyclists pedaled opposite of me.  “Morning!” I called, the cyclists answering with a short wave as they passed.  I passed the prairie and the open field revealed itself.  

My vision traced the current of the river when my periphery caught a dark object on the other side of the path.  I flinched and looked to my right, realizing it was just our antisocial friend with Reggie on leash.  She was standing next to an old oak, Reggie braced himself towards me, against his collar.  He growled, propped up onto his hind legs by the tension of his leash.  “Sorry!”  I said with a chuckle, “You scared me!”

She didn’t respond.  Instead, she tried to break eye contact, but kept glancing at me, she stepped behind the oak, a shitty attempt to hide herself.  I stared for a moment, before scoffing, “Okay then!”, and continuing my trek to work.  What a fucking weirdo, what is she afraid of me for?!  She must lead a sad life if she can’t even a handle a friendly run-in, she needs to get her shit together.

I glanced at her car as I crossed the road, rust spotted the bumper.  A crack split the rear window.  What a beater.

On Friday, I was out of the door at 6:30, plenty of time.  It was chillier this morning, I shoved my hands in my pockets and kept my head down on my walk.  

A low fog covered the prairie.  Moisture hung in the air and I could feel the cold humidity in my lungs. The sun was just beginning to peak through the clouds as I crossed the street and walked down the path.  The prairie ended and ahead, through the orange, sunlit haze, I could see the woman and her dog well ahead of me.  This bitch, I thought to myself.  She walked along the rivers edge with Reggie on a tether, his nose stuck in the shoreline sedges.  She’s gonna take one look at me and high tail it to her car, I just know it. 

She glanced up at me, and flinched when she saw me, fucking flinched!  She turned and marched towards her shit box, dragging Reggie along with her.  I fucking knew it, this fucking bitch.  What in the fuck is her problem, what does she have to be afraid of?!  Doesn’t she understand that it’s friction that makes the world a good place to live?!  Talking to cashiers, waving to neighbors, interacting with strangers is what makes life vibrant, what makes life worth living!  This fat bitch, this waste of life, she’s not fulfilling her social contract!  Doesn’t she understand that she’s a member of this fucking community?!  Be a fucking part of it!

She got into her car, the chassis shifting as she sat down.  The engine fired up and she was off.   Enjoy your whole half mile drive, lazy piece of shit.  I bet she’s gonna spend the whole day in her shitty apartment ordering Grubhub and watching TV.  She won’t retrieve her food until she’s sure the hallways clear, so she doesn’t have to speak to anybody.  What a life to lead.  I could feel vitriol in my heart.  I closed my eyes and tried to focus on my breath.  The leaves of river birches flittered in the wind, and spackled sunlight warmed the left side of my face.  The right side of my face remained in the cool, crisp autumnal shadow.  I focused on the contrast, on the warmth and cold.  I felt my pulse slow, my body calm itself.  Am I really gonna let this bitch ruin my day?

Crossing the intersection before the police station, a volunteer for the Knights of Columbus held a tootsie roll toward me, “Donations for the needy?”

I glared at him, “Fuck off” I muttered.  I guess she was gonna ruin my day. 

That night I decided to go for a little stroll, taking occasional pulls from my weed pen.  The night was calm, still.  Our friend’s rusty shitbox sat in front of me.  I pulled my phone out.  I took a picture of her plate, and took another rip from my vape.  I spit at her bumper, and headed home.

On Saturday, I held my badge to the electronic reader, and, with a beep, the mechanical lock clicked open.  I stepped into the police station and headed up to the darkened second floor, just the skeleton crew of the weekend inside.  I walked past the large glass wall, unlocking the attached glass door with my badge.  Inside, the dispatch center sat in darkness, a warm, low glow from dimmed overhead lights.  The only other light came from multiple monitors decorating the three dispatch stations, and a TV quietly playing college football on the opposite wall.  Mark sat watching the tv at the left-most station.  “Mark!  What’s up man?”

“Hey Tyler, what are you doing here?”  He asked, turning away from the television.

“Nothing, kiddo is taking a nap, and forgot something yesterday, figured I’d swing by…” I said, rocking back and forth on my feet.  “Hey, I’ve got a favor to ask of you.”

Mark raised an eyebrow, “What do ya need?”

“I need you to run a plate for me.”

Mark leaned forward in his chair.  “I dunno man, that’s really not for public use.”  He said.

“Cmon Mark.” I insisted, “My sister-in-law says she’s seen the same car parked outside of her place quite a bit the last few weeks.  She lives in a nice place, she’s afraid it’s getting cased.  You know she had that incident a few years ago.”  

“You mean when those teenagers raided her beer fridge?”  Mark chuckled, glaring at me, “in her open garage?”

“It still freaked her out man!”  I retorted.  Mark stared at me, arms crossed.  “Mark, please.”  I begged, “we’re the police, I’m not gonna use this for something dumb, just looking for some peace of mi-”

He cut me off, “Tyler, I’m not trying to be a dick, but you’re an office administrator.  We appreciate what you do here, but…” I could feel heat building inside me.  “You’re not supposed to have access to this stuff.”  He paused, “Look, there’s a reason you’re not an officer, if you can’t pass the psych then you shouldn’t be-“

“I told you that because we’re friends,” I growled back, “not so you could hold it against me.  I’m looking out for my family, that’s it.”  

He looked away from me, shrunk in his chair.  I could feel my jaw clenching, my anger building.  I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply, trying to calm myself.  I unclenched my fists,  but could still feel the raw tension in my hands.  I tried to speak softly, “can you just tell me if this person has any history?”

Mark took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.  “I don’t need any details, just wanna keep my family safe” I pleaded.

He sighed, “Give me the info.”

“Thank you” I replied.  I gave him the plate number as he typed it into his keyboard.

He scanned the screen.  “She’s clean, no warrants, no arrests.  Happy?”

I walked to his side, leaning over his monitor and bumping his mouse.  “Can you give me an address?  See if she lives in the area?”

“You’re not supposed to see this shit!” He exclaimed, grabbing at his mouse and closing the query.  But not before I saw her name, Taylor.

I could still feel the frustration in my gut, but I had gotten what I’d come for, well, half of what I’d come for.  I continued through the darkened halls and stopped at the logistics officer’s door.  I pressed my badge against the electronic lock, and the latch clicked open.  I may not be police according to Mark, but the city deemed it appropriate that I have access to virtually the whole department.  Behind the officers vacant desk, a key cabinet was mounted on the wall, it’s own key inserted in it’s lock, our excellent security on full display.  I turned the key and opened the cabinet, scanning the keys inside.  I found what I was looking for, a spare Knox key.  I grabbed the key and returned the cabinet to the state I’d found it.

I headed outside and into The Coffee House.  The afternoon crowd was thin, Steve saw me walking in, “Hey, it’s Mr Brookhaven!  You want your usual?”  He laughed, bumping his coworker with his elbow.

I felt my freshly cooled rage bubble inside me once more, as I walked up to the counter.  Steve walked up to the register.  “I’m just joking man, you want your Americ-“

“You think you’re funny?”  I said quietly, cutting him off.  “You think it’s funny?  Think it’s fucking funny to mock good people?”  I felt my fists clenching.  “You think you’re cool?  Shitting on me for trying to make the world a bit brighter?”

“Woah man” he stammered, taken aback, “I didn’t think-“

“No shit you didn’t think” I interrupted.  “You don’t think, life is just a fucking joke and you’re just here to laugh and make fun, aren’t you?” Steve reeled back as my voice raised, “don’t contribute, don’t help, don’t seek conversation or betterment, don’t give a shit.  Just shit on everything.”  I jabbed my finger at him, “You’re what’s wrong with this world!” 

The cafe was quiet.  I could feel the eyes of the few patrons bounce from me to Steve.  Steve stayed back from the counter, staring, his mouth agape.  I stepped back, remembering where I was, “I’ll just go to fucking Starbucks” I muttered to myself.  I snatched a cup off the online order tray as I walked out the door.

I crossed the street, heading back home.  I needed to ground myself.  I took in my surroundings.  The field of the park was abuzz with pee-wee soccer.  The limestone crunched beneath my feet.  The din of kids learning team sports filled my ears, of parents cheering and whistles blowing.  The trees of the savannah, bright with the afternoon sun, heaved with the wind.  The same breeze blew dry autumn heat into my face.  I raised the warm cup to my lips and took a sip.  

I reeled back and tossed the cup to the ground.  Fucking pumpkin spice.

Sunday night, after yet another rousing reading of ‘Llama llama Misses Mama’, I got Olivia tucked in and down for the night.  “I’m stepping outside for a few, I’ll be back in 20.” I called to my wife.

I grabbed my jacket, threw in my headphones and stepped outside.  The sky to the west was the deep red of a bygone sunset, rapidly transitioning to purple and black.  The night was chilly, and I zipped up my jacket and braced myself against the cold.  I walked south and turned west.  A few folks have begun putting out their halloween decorations, inflatable pumpkins and plastic skeletons.  Orange and purple porchlights cast an eerie glow on the quiet houses.  A bluster of wind carried dry, fallen leaves across the road, clicking and ticking as they bounced on the cold cement.  I really let this Taylor girl get under my skin the other day, but I cannot fathom why someone would be afraid of me!  If I could just talk to her she’d see that I’m a good guy, just another guy that makes our community special.  She could be so much happier if she’d just participate in society!  She just needs to see it from my perspective!

I headed south on the main connector, arriving at Armpit Acres.  The red Honda sat in the parking lot, a beacon to what had to be her apartment building.  I approached the front door and gave the door a tug, locked.  I scanned the exterior wall.  Behind a large bush, about six feet off the ground was the Knox box.  I inserted the Knox key into the lock, twisted and pulled the box open.  Inside were two keys, one, small and labeled FACP, the other, large, with DO NOT DUPLICATE stamped on its body, the master.  I inserted the master key into the door lock and she turned.  Inside, fluorescent bulbs bathed the hallway in sallow light. I looked over the mailboxes, scanning the names written on each receptacle.  204, got ya.

I headed up the stained carpet stairs.  I’m just gonna talk to her, let her know I’m a good guy.  Who knows, maybe we’ll be friends!  A Wipe your Paws doormat lay cockeyed in front of 204.  I knocked on the door, Reggie barked inside.  A few moments later the door cracked open.  Taylor’s face appeared in the crack, “Can I help you?” She moused, barely audible over Reggie barking.

“Yes hi, I live in the area.  I’ve seen you at the park…”

She stared back at me, “Okay…. What…. What do you want?” She stammered.  Reggie’s nose peaked through the cracked door below her.

“I live in the neighborhood, I’ve tried to say hi, but you don’t seem to want to be a part of our community.”  

She stared at me, “What?  I don’t know you…”

“We can get to know each other, when I wave it’s just out of friendliness.  We can be friends ya know.”  I said, earnestly.

She continued to stare, wide eyed, “I…. I have anxiety.  People give me anxiety.”  She spoke quickly, her cadence unnatural, stilted.  “What are you doing here?”

“Hi Reggie!”  I reached down to pet the dog.  “I’m not a threat, I’m not gonna kidnap you or hurt you or anything crazy.  I’m not a murderer.”  Reggie snarled and bit at my hand as it got close to his face.  I pulled my hand back.  “Easy buddy, you remember me!”

“What the fuck!  Why are you here?!”  Her breathing was fast.  “How do you know where I live?!  I don’t even know you!”  She was raising her voice.

“Taylor please, If I could just come inside,”  I reasoned with her.  “I bet we could figure this out.”  

“What the fuck!  How do you know my name?”  She was clearly alarmed, on the verge of panicking.  This wasn’t going well, “How do you know my dog’s name?  Are you stalking me?!  I’m calling the police.”  She tried to slam the door, but I caught it with my foot.

“Taylor come on!”  I exclaimed, forcing the door open as I stepped inside.  The door thrust open, hitting Taylor on the head and knocking her backwards, onto the ground.  This really wasn’t going well.  I took another step inside, reached down to help her up, “I’m so sorry, I-“.  A snarl cut me off as Reggie lunged at me, teeth bared, hitting me on my right side.  His weight knocked me to the left, my body slammed into the kitchenette.  Fortunately, Reggie’s teeth couldn’t find hold and he was picking himself off the ground.  He lunged again.  I braced myself, covering my head.  He aimed for my neck, but his body crashed into my forearms.  He gnashed at me, but his mouth only found air.  Using my whole body, I threw him across the room.  He landed on an end table, his yelp accompanied by a choir of clatter as the corner of the apartment went dark, a lamp shattering as it fell.  I tried to regain my composure, and looked to Taylor, who had picked herself off the ground.  A fresh laceration on her forehead.  Underneath, an expression of fear and retribution. She held something towards me.  “Wait, this wasn’t-”

“GET THE FUCK OUT!”

Wetness hit my face.  I was blinded, my eyes burned, my throat was on fire.  I’d been maced once before, when I was going through the college police academy.  The cadre coached me through the process, to control my breathing, to fight my panic, to remain in control.  I did not have that luxury today.  I howled.  I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t see, I stumbled backwards into the hallway, Taylor continued to shout at me, but I couldn’t make it out, it was just noise.  “What the fuck!”  I coughed, I tried to catch my breath, each inhale increased the intensity of the napalm in my throat.  Through my blindness I could only see one thing, red.  I clamored up and took a step towards the threshold of the apartment.  

I was met with 80 pounds of fur, and I stumbled back into the shared hallway.  Reggie found his purchase on my right forearm. Reggie’s head wrenched back and forth, his teeth shredding my forearm and sleeve while his hind legs dug at my stomach. I could feel warm blood beginning to pool in the elbow of my jacket.  I punched at Reggie with my free arm, but his grip only tightened.  I was fully panicked now, I howled and shook my arm, a primordial plea for relief.  Half blind, I watched Taylor grab Reggie by the collar and try to pull him off me.  Thank God, I thought.  Reggie finally relented, releasing his grasp.  As Taylor pulled him backwards she began kicking me, in the legs, the crotch, wherever she could find impact.  

I scrambled to my feet.  “You fucking psycho” I gasped, but I was defeated.  I retreated down the hallway, past Taylor’s neighbors, drawn to the hallway from the commotion.  I staggered out the front door, my left arm cradling my mangled right.  

I limped back toward my home.  My face burned, my eyes were on fire, my nose a dripping faucet of mucus.  The turbulent wind like daggers twisting into my cuts and scrapes.  Blood dripped from the elbow of my jacket and onto the sidewalk.  The night was dark, and I felt the darkness in my bones.  I recounted the events of the evening in my head, of my good intentions, so willfully rejected.  All I wanted to do was find a common ground, to help her become a part of this town, and this is the thanks I get.  I focused once more on my breathing, to calm my racing heart, but I just couldn’t let go.

This neighborhood is going to hell.
