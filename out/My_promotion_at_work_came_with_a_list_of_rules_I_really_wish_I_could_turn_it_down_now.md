Since so many of you guys are so interested in the other stuff I’m privy to now that I’m inside the inside, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a little more. Nothing here really identifies me enough to cause an issue and I’m pretty sure no amount of keeping my head down is gonna unring the bell, if you know what I mean.  
  
Now if you read what happened with [No-Red Wayne](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15clf4p/i_found_out_i_work_for_monsters_and_ive_seen_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), you know I got a promotion out of it. I’m GM of the club now, with a nice hiring bonus in my pocket and no medical expenses. Though I do have to hire some new guys since half my security staff is outta commission and I’m not exactly sure when or if I’m getting them back. There ain’t no rest for the wicked.  
  
Now, I know how to run a club. I was No-red’s hand after all, and so taking over was gonna be simple enough. At least, that was my general expectation when I woke up the next day. I half expected Jimmy James to still be there when I showed up, but he left about an hour before I went in at noon. That would mean he left while the sun was up, so I’m not really sure how that works out with his…condition.  
  
He did, however leave me a list of rules. A couple were just reminders of things I kinda knew or was aware of, but the way Jimmy danced around this shit is really testing my whole head down policy. It feels like I’m stuck sitting on a bomb now. One that’s a lot worse than just working for a family.  
  
1. Your new job is to make money and lose money correctly. You know how that works, so check the two binders on the desk. One black, one green. The black binder has all the non-negotiable suppliers in it. They’re your first go to. Anything you need or any work that ain’t got a black binder contact will have a green binder contact. Greens are all the ones you need to be careful with. They are not family owned and operated.   
  
2. Always have two counters on the dancers. One floor manager and one door guy. Keeps things honest.  
  
3. No outside food.  
  
4. No spray tan in the building. I don’t care if she wore it in, you send home any girl wearing that shit. Fucks with the AC unit and the repair companies out here are all green binder.  
  
5. No perfume on the girls. No cologne on the boys. No smells that aren’t natural. If someone stinks, send them home. Unless they smell like corn chips. Then they can only come in if they are on the corn chip list. Not on the list, they can’t come in. Unless they are looking to work, then interview them like normal. Don’t acknowledge the smell. You might not even notice it unless you grew up with dogs.  
  
6. No fighting between the girls is tolerated on the property. If any of them ever give the slightest hint that they got beef, you call me. NEVER break up arguments or fights with the girls though. Just tell them you’re gonna call me and then actually call me. Don’t take chances. Always call me, even if the girls involved beg you not to. ALWAYS CALL ME.  
  
7. Don’t take any of the girls home. I don’t give a shit if she's more hot and ready than a Little Caesar’s, don’t do it. I don’t care what she says, offers, or promises. Don’t mess around with the girls at all. It’s not about shitting where you eat. It’s about me not needing to find a new GM.  
  
8. The boys can mess around with the girls if they wanna, but don’t encourage it. Just because this is a college town don’t mean the bouncer supply is infinite.  
  
9. Keep your closing door guys until you leave the lot. Always be gone by 4am.  
  
10. No boyfriends OR girlfriends in the building. This shit goes double if they smell like corn chips.  
  
11. No corn chips in the vending machines.  
  
12. Don’t ask about the corn chips. Don’t mention it when you smell it. Don’t comment on any other smells you pick up along side it.   
  
13. Onyx, Helena, Jade, and Sage don’t have to pay house. They do not have to pay a cut. They will if they feel like it. If one of those four bring a new girl to the club, she doesn’t have to pay anything either. Don’t fuck that up. I don’t want THAT call and neither do you.  
  
14. If someone shows up looking somewhat formal and wearing a strange mask and asks about me, call me. If they ask about one of the girls and she is in the building, send the pair to the alternative counting room. If only the formal one comes out, don’t go in after. Call me.  
  
15. If you start to notice people hanging around the lot in groups of 3-8 specifically, call me. This goes double if Onyx, Helena, Jade, or Sage is in the building.  
  
16. If anyone shows up and feels slightly cop-ish but isn’t one, treat them like a normal customer unless they are asking questions about individuals. Then politely but firmly ask them to leave and call me.  
  
17. The Sheriff is kin to me like No-Red was, so let him and his boys in without issue, but if the fire marshal or that god damn food inspector show up, pay them what they ask for.   
  
18. I know you don’t wanna know to much but this I need to be direct about. Some of your girls might have ghouls. Ghouls can be trapped for a time. They can be slowed down for a while. They can not be stopped. They don’t like it when people try. So if another one shows up, go out and ask them to wait. Say you will bring the girl to them. Tell your guys not to fuck with it. Go back inside, send the girl to the alternative counting room, then call me. After you do that, leave. Send the guys home. YOU go home. Lock the doors, apologize to the ghoul, say their target is hiding inside, and leave. It will let you go. I already called the guys to fix and reinforce the doors so expect them today.  
  
Most of these won’t kill you, Lenny, so you can still have a nice long life with the family. Possibly longer, if you play your cards right.   
  
That last line made me nervous, but it wasn’t really my focus. My concerns were with the weird ass corn chip entries and that ominous shit about the girls. I’ve seen the lists. The problem girls list, the banned list, the mom list (which the girls from rule 13 were on), and the CC list which I now know must stand for corn chip. I thought it was something like closed circuit or something that meant the girls were to be watched closer since the girls on that list would usually only stay a few months. No girls are on it right now, except one waitress I haven’t seen in a week or two.  
  
All in all, the rules would be easy to follow, but it just didn’t stop nagging at me. What is this corn chip stuff? Why is it okay for girls to work if they smell like them, but outside of that, persona non grata? I wonder if rule 12 was something in general or should I not tell the person who smells like snack food that they need to brush their teeth or something?  
  
Rule 18 cleared some stuff up for sure. Rule 7 was something No-Red had always warned me about. “These girls can be dangerous, Lenny. Find yourself a nice, sweet, normal girl. Someone that talks to their parents and can keep plants alive,” he would say to me. I thought he just didn’t like strippers, but he was the same with the waitresses and the bartenders too. He wanted me to stay clear of all the girls, without exception. Now I see why.  
  
That said, I have a rule in play already. Onyx caught me on the way in, asking me to interview a friend or cousin or something. That’s gonna be rule 13. It’s a shame, because if she is anything like the others from that rule, she’s gonna make a killing and that cut would be nice.  
  
Speaking of Onyx, when I told her No-Red was gone, she seemed kinda pleased. I’m not sure what was going on there, but the bitch was downright smug. I’m wondering what that was all about. I didn’t go into detail, but she just seemed to know something. That’s worth looking into. Might be something Jimmy will want to know about.  
  
Anyway, if something else happens I’ll let you guys know, but I’ll be busy. No-Red was here all the time and I ain’t got nobody to do for me what I did for him. Not yet anyway. So be patient, eh? I'll sneak you what tidbits I find.
