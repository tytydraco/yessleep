Over the past few months, I’ve watched my brother transform into someone I barely recognize… and I’m beginning to believe it has to do with a tree we discovered in our childhood.  
Before I start, I want to make it clear that I’m not here to be judged. I just… need to get this off my chest. My brother—let’s call him Henry—has become obsessed with something we experienced as kids, and I’m afraid of what he might do.

Henry and I grew up in a house in Canada, in a region where the city meets the forest. It was a peaceful place, almost idyllic, especially in the fall, when the leaves formed a golden carpet, and the woods felt almost magical. Like many children, we spent hours exploring the area.

It was during one of those days, when I was 6 and Henry was 10, that we found a lone tree in the forest, not far from our home in Canada, just a bit deeper into the woods. It was massive and stood slightly apart from all the other trees, as if it had its own little circle that made it the center of attention, like a stage. We spent that entire autumn playing around the tree.

We created a sort of innocent ritual: we’d gather fallen leaves, make crowns out of them, and leave them near the roots as an offering. We pretended the tree was our secret guardian. Even when winter came and our visits became less frequent, the connection with the tree remained. To me, it was just a child’s game. To Henry… I now see it might have been something more.

As we grew older, our visits became less frequent, but we’d still go back every now and then, as a reminder of simpler times.

When I was 20, I got an offer to study abroad in France. I spent three years there, away from my family. It was an amazing experience, but I missed home, especially my parents and Henry. We stayed in touch through messages and calls, but it just wasn’t the same.

When I returned home, I was surprised. Everything looked exactly the same as when I left. The house, the yard, even my parents—it was as if nothing had changed. Henry seemed the same too, but one thing caught my attention: he had started visiting the tree much more often.

He would leave at dusk, always two days a week, and return after dark. His hands were often scratched and dirty with soil. When I asked about it, he gave vague answers like, “I just like walking at night.” I thought it was strange, but I didn’t realize how deep this went.

Some time later, our mother fell ill. She was diagnosed with cancer, and my parents decided to move in with my aunt, whose house was closer to a good hospital. Henry and I stayed behind, living alone, which made me notice his routine—and the changes in him—even more.

He had always been a calm person, the kind to stay in his room playing video games or watching movies, but now he seemed more introspective. He spent hours locked in his room or out in the forest. I knew he was going to the tree, but I didn’t think it was anything too odd. It was nostalgic for us, right?

Henry always had his peculiarities, but after our parents moved out, I started noticing the truly strange things. I’d already observed that he would leave for the forest twice a week at dusk and come back when the moon was high in the sky. He said it was to clear his head, maybe to relive childhood memories, and I believed him… at first.

But things got stranger when I began noticing the details. He’d return covered in dirt, with small cuts not only on his hands but all up his arms, and there was a smell I couldn’t place. It was like wet soil mixed with something metallic. I asked a few times what he was doing out there, and he always shrugged and said, “Oh, nothing much. I just like walking around.”

I was starting to get used to it, but then something happened that made me lose sleep.

It was one of those nights when the house made those usual noises—the creaks of wood adjusting to the cold. They always annoyed me, but I’d learned to ignore them. That night, however, I woke up thirsty, and the water bottle by my bed was empty. So, I went to the kitchen to refill it.

As I walked down the hallway, I noticed Henry’s bedroom door was slightly ajar. That wasn’t unusual, but something felt off. The light wasn’t on, and when I looked more closely, I realized the room was empty.

Henry wasn’t home.

I thought maybe he had gone out to buy something or just gone for a walk because he couldn’t sleep. But something inside me whispered otherwise. I knew he was in the forest.

Out of caution, I decided to stay up until he returned. I turned on my computer and tried to distract myself, but the clock seemed to drag on. It wasn’t until the numbers read **3:33** that I heard the sound of the back door opening and quietly closing.

It might sound silly, but that time of night always gave me chills. I’d heard ghost stories about 3 a.m. when I was a kid, the "witching hour," and I thought maybe I was just being paranoid. Still, I decided to keep an eye on him.

The next night, I did the same thing. I waited, and there he was, leaving at dusk and coming back at ***exactly*** 3:33.

*This happened every single night that week*.

When I finally worked up the courage to ask him about it, he brushed it off. I asked him directly: "Why are you going out so much at night, Henry?" He looked at me for a moment, wearing his usual distant smile, and simply said, "Sometimes I just need some fresh air."

But there was something about the way he said it. It felt rehearsed. He avoided eye contact and immediately changed the subject to something more cheerful.

Okay, I’ve given enough context. Let me get straight to the point. This happened a few weeks ago, and I really don’t know what to think. I’ll try to tell this as clearly as I can, but it’s hard to piece everything together.

After so much time watching my brother sneak out at night (now every day, not just twice a week as I’d originally thought), I decided to confront him. It wasn’t just curiosity—I was genuinely worried. So one night, as he was getting ready to leave again, I took the initiative and said:  
"I'm coming with you."

I thought he’d get annoyed, but he just looked at me and laughed. "Alright, brave one. But don’t start crying halfway through, okay?"

I rolled my eyes but felt relieved. He seemed like the same old Henry—playful, as if everything was just one big joke. As we walked down the trail, he made a point of pointing out every root I could trip over, sometimes even stopping to grab my hand on purpose, just to tease me.

"You're slower than I remember," he said, laughing.

"Maybe because you're a lunatic who comes out here in the middle of the night!" I shot back.

It was almost comforting… until we reached *the tree*.

Suddenly, the atmosphere changed. Henry grew quieter, more serious. He didn’t have to say anything—it was clear that this place meant a lot to him. It was almost like he was silently asking for respect with the way he looked at the tree.

And, well, it was just a tree. Or at least, it should have been. There was nothing obviously strange about it. But as I looked closer, I began to notice the details: the bark was flawless, without any fungus or moss, as if someone cleaned it every day.

And around it, there were all sorts of things scattered about: crowns made of leaves, pinecones painted in vibrant colors, hand-carved wooden trinkets… even some jewelry that clearly didn’t belong there. It looked like some kind of altar.

Aqui está a continuação traduzida para o inglês:

“What is all this?” I asked.

“Just a way to keep things organized,” he replied, his tone flat, as if he didn’t want to talk about it.

I stood there for a while, looking, trying to understand. But in the end, it just looked like a tree—no matter how bizarre his care for it seemed. I decided to ignore it. Maybe I was being a jerk for judging my brother’s weird hobbies.

For a few weeks, everything went back to “normal.” Or at least I convinced myself that it was fine. Henry kept going out at night, and I tried to get used to his peculiarities.

Until *that* happened…

It was exactly midnight when I heard the back door open. I went to the living room and saw Henry coming in, but this time he was… different.

His hands were covered in dried blood, and there was dirt all over his body—on his arms, legs, even his face. His clothes were filthy, as if he’d been crawling on the forest floor.

“Henry? What happened?” I asked, trying not to panic.

He barely looked at me. “I’m taking a shower,” he mumbled, walking past me.

I just stood there, frozen. It was obvious something was very wrong.

I waited until I heard the shower turn off, ready to confront him as soon as he came out. But before I could say anything, I heard his bedroom door lock.

“Henry!” I knocked on the door. “Are you okay? Did you get hurt?”

“Go to sleep,” he replied, his voice muffled. He didn’t sound angry, just exhausted, like he’d just endured the longest day of his life.

I kept calling out, insisting, but he didn’t respond again. Eventually, I gave up and went to my room. But I couldn’t sleep.

The blood, the dirt, the silence—it wouldn’t leave my mind. Something was terribly wrong, and I knew I wouldn’t rest until I figured out what it was.

This was just a few days ago, before… everything. At the time, I didn’t know what to think, but now, looking back, I realize this was the turning point. Maybe I should’ve done something then and there, but it’s hard to act when you’re not sure if you’re losing your mind or not.

Here’s what happened: Henry had left the house in the middle of the afternoon, as he usually did, saying he was going for a walk. Nothing out of the ordinary. But I was still stewing over everything that had happened—the dirt, the blood, the strange way he acted around the tree. So, while he was out, I decided to check his room.

I know it sounds invasive, and I did feel bad about it, but I *needed* answers.

As soon as I opened the door, a strange smell hit me. It was a mix of wet soil and… iron? Like the metallic scent you get when you cut your finger. It was strong and seemed to grow worse the longer I stayed in there.

The first thing I noticed was how the room looked normal from the outside, but once inside, nothing was actually clean. The curtains were drawn, as always, but up close, I could see they were stained with dirt. In the corners of the room, the floor had small dark stains that I didn’t want to think about.

Then I opened his bedside drawer, and that’s when things got truly bizarre.

Inside, there was an old, crumpled piece of paper, smeared with dirt. It looked like it had been ripped out of a school notebook, and it was written in crayon, in a way that clearly resembled a child’s handwriting.

What did it say? Something like:

**“*****^(I PROMISE TO BE NICE TO THE TREE.)*****”**

The strangest part was the signature. He had used his thumbprint, and around it was what could only be dried blood.

At the time, I tried to rationalize it. Like, "Okay, this is just kid stuff. A silly game he never threw away." But why was it still there? And why was it smeared with blood?

I didn’t have much time to think about it. I heard the front door opening—Henry was back.

I closed everything as quickly as I could and left his room, trying to look casual. When he walked into the kitchen, his pants were dirty with soil, as usual, but otherwise, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. He grabbed a glass of water and looked at me with that goofy smile of his.

"Everything okay?" he asked, as if absolutely nothing strange was going on.

I stared at him, trying to decide whether or not to ask. In the end, I just said, "Yeah, fine."

"Cool, I’m gonna take a shower."

And that was it. He left the kitchen, and I stayed there, completely lost, with a thousand questions racing through my mind.

Later that same night, that’s when things got truly weird. I was in the living room, trying not to think about anything, when I heard heavy footsteps on the porch. I went to the window and saw Henry, standing outside. He was holding what looked like a wooden amulet, and he was... singing?

I couldn’t understand the language—it sounded made up. But there was something about it that didn’t sound *normal*. It was deep, almost echo-like. And then he stopped. Slowly, he turned his head in my direction, like he knew I was watching, and he smiled…

A smile that was utterly bizarre… accompanied by an even stranger growl.

After that, he simply turned and walked away, heading toward the tree. *I knew that was where he was going*.

At that moment, I didn’t know what to think. Now… well, now I know that wasn’t just in my head.

A few days have passed, and things seem to have only gotten worse since then. The house is constantly dirty with soil in the corners, Henry spends hours and hours away from home, and the creaking of the floorboards always starts up at night. I keep hearing the sound of the shower running, and when I’m in the living room or kitchen, I can hear my brother singing in that strange language.

I swear on everything holy, I’ve seen him smiling in that creepy way out of the corner of my eye. But every time I look directly at him, he’s back to normal.

I don’t know if it’s some kind of prank, but it’s starting to get seriously disturbing!

After that night when I saw Henry standing outside and looking at me with that eerie smile, I tried to ignore it. I pretended everything was fine and went on with my life. But the truth is, that image was stuck in my head, along with all the other strange things that had happened.

This morning, I finally gave in. I called our parents.

They dodged the topic, as usual, but one comment kept echoing in my mind. My mom said something about how the tree was our "special place" and how, after I left, Henry became obsessed with it. According to her, he spent hours there, alone, as if trying to relive the memories of our childhood.

I don’t know why, but that made me feel guilty. I decided to put the thought aside for now.

After hanging up, I decided I needed to talk to him—lay everything out in the open. But before I could leave my room, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.

On the doorway threshold, there was a trail of blood… Not a lot, but enough to freeze me in my tracks.

I followed the trail to the living room, and that’s when I noticed the smell. Wet earth and something metallic, strong, almost unbearable.

The blood led to the front door. When I opened it, I saw a perfect circle of salt around the house. And the strangest part? There was a line of coarse salt stretching across the yard, through the grass, disappearing into the forest.

I don’t know why, but I just knew it led to the tree.

Before I could make any decisions, I heard a loud bang from the back porch, as if something had slammed into the house with immense force. And I wasn’t wrong.

When I got there, I saw a deer. It was smashing its head against the glass door of the porch—repeatedly, over and over, staining it with blood every time it hit harder.

**WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?**

Okay, I’m no expert, but ***that*** definitely isn’t normal anywhere. What the actual hell?!

That damn deer kept smashing its head into the glass until it broke and fell forward, collapsing like a rag doll.

The thing was dead. Not because it had smashed its head into the glass so many times, but because its stomach had been ripped open—as if some beast had torn it apart and left the remains to rot.

I threw up. A lot.

Can you blame me? There was a dead deer in my kitchen that somehow looked like it had been decomposing for months!

I was done. No, I was exhausted! I couldn’t take it anymore. I didn’t know what kind of twisted nightmare this was, but it had to end. I had to put a stop to it!

I grabbed my phone and a hatchet hanging on the wall in the living room, and I marched into that cursed forest, heading straight for that damned tree.

I knew it was all the tree’s fault — I could feel it! So I was going to *cut the problem at its root*. *Literally*.

I’m not sure how to explain what happened next. My hand was shaking so much that I almost dropped my phone while following that trail of coarse salt. It was already strange enough that the salt was there, but the blood that seemed to mix along the way made my stomach turn. There was no logical explanation for it. The trees around me seemed more alive—or maybe more dead, as if they were sucking something out of the earth. The roots were everywhere, intertwining like pulsating veins. With each step, the air grew denser, almost sticky.

When I finally reached the tree, I almost didn’t recognize it. It was surrounded by a circle of salt, lit by candles that flickered despite there being no wind. There were animal bodies—rabbits, birds, even a dog—arranged around the trunk like a macabre offering. There was something deeply wrong about it all, but before I could process everything, my eyes landed on Henry.

He was kneeling in front of the tree, murmuring something... I think he was praying. His hands were clasped together, fingers stained red and covered in dirt. Even from a distance, something felt... different. Henry had always been thin, but now he seemed elongated, as if his body no longer fit the normal proportions of a human. His clothes were covered in dried blood and mud. My instinct was to run, but my legs wouldn’t obey. I hesitated.

That was when I made the worst decision possible: I took a step forward and stepped on a dry twig. The sound was like an explosion in the oppressive silence. Henry immediately stopped praying. For a few seconds, there was no sound—just that unbearable silence. Then, he laughed. First softly, almost like a whisper, but the sound grew louder, becoming something inhuman. He slowly stood up, almost mechanically, and turned to face me.

I almost vomited. Henry was smiling, but it wasn’t a normal smile. It was too wide, his teeth looked bigger and sharper, and his eyes... God, his eyes. The whites of his eyes were overtaken by black veins, and his pupils were so dilated they covered almost the entire iris. He looked happy to see me, as if this was the most anticipated reunion of his life.

— You arrived... just in time — he said, his voice hoarse, but with an almost childish tone. — We can do the ritual together, like we used to.

My body froze. Then I realized he was talking about those stupid games we played when we were kids. Pretending to talk to the tree like it was a guardian or something like that. It was just a game. At least, that’s what I thought.

— Henry, what is this? What the hell is going on here? — I asked, trying to sound firm, but my voice came out shaky. He didn’t respond immediately. Instead, he tilted his head to the side, still smiling.

— You abandoned me! — he suddenly said, the smile disappearing. His voice came out loud, almost a shout. — You left me here alone, and I prayed every day for you to come back. The tree talked to me. It listened when no one else did. I gave my prayers, confessed my sins, and it rewarded me... It brought you back!

I took a step back. Henry had never spoken like this before. He had always been too playful to get angry, I couldn’t even remember the last time he yelled at me. Now, it seemed like all the repressed anger was coming out at once.

— Henry, you’re scaring me — I tried to say, but he interrupted me.

— Scaring? I should be scared! You have no idea what I’ve been through here, alone with her. But now it’s okay. We’re together again, and we just need to renew the contract. That’s all.

He started walking toward me slowly, the macabre smile returning. — You’ll understand. You’ll see. The tree is good. *She loves us*. We can do rituals together, make offerings like we used to!

I had no idea what was going on, but hell no, I wasn’t going to be part of this sick thing!! I raised my axe and threatened Henry... it was me or him, even if I had to go through my brother, my goal was to cut down that tree.

— Henry, back off, I’m not joking! I’m going to end this, and you’ll go back to normal!! — I yelled, hoping he would hear me, but he didn’t stop...

When he started walking toward me, with that smile that seemed more and more... inhuman, I didn’t know if fear or anger was stronger. Henry was unrecognizable. The playful boy who always followed me like a puppy was now this deformed figure, his voice carrying an authority that should never belong to him.

I tried to argue, to say that this wasn’t him, that we needed to leave. But he just laughed. "I’m not going anywhere. I can’t! Not after everything I’ve done for us! You’ll thank me! You’ll see, it’s going to be fun!! Just like old times..."

That’s when he lunged at me. I don’t know if he meant to hurt me or just hold me, but instinct is a powerful thing. My hands found the axe I had brought just in case — but he was too fast. Henry grabbed my arm before I could fully react, and his fingers were so strong I felt him tearing into my skin with his nails. Blood started flowing down my wrist, and the pain brought me back to reality. ***This wasn’t my brother***.

I shoved him with a force I didn’t know I had, knocking Henry, or whatever this thing was, to the ground and grabbing my axe with both hands, ready to strike back.

"You think you can stop me? You think you can undo what the tree has given us?!" he shouted, his black eyes locked on mine.

That’s when I saw my chance. I used all the strength I had and swung the axe. He tried to dodge, but I was done with all of this. The axe hit his shoulder, and he screamed — but the sound wasn’t human. It was... something deeper, almost like the wind howling through the tree roots.

The next strike was definitive. His head was no longer part of his body. The blood flowing into the earth was proof of that. I swear I could hear him grunt even after I struck his neck with the axe. And then... silence.

I stood there, frozen, with the axe still in my hand and my brother’s body in front of me.

But it didn’t end there.

*I needed to put an end to this.*

I approached that damned tree, ready to use the lumberjack skills my own brother had taught me... But the voices...

The voices started as a whisper, but soon became deafening. It was hard to tell what they were saying, but all the words pushed me toward the tree. I saw faces in the shadows, figures that weren’t there. I could swear I saw the tree’s roots moving, trying to grab me, like a mother’s warm embrace.

I knew I needed to get out of there. ***I couldn’t fight it***.

Something wasn’t right... It was just a matter of cutting down the tree, and everything would end, but... why did I feel like it was so wrong to do that?

I dropped the axe right there, but I’m not stupid enough to wait for something to happen. I ran. I ran like never before. I didn’t look back as I stumbled on the way back to the house, heading toward the car, my hands still covered in my own blood. I got in the car, slammed the door, and only when I turned the key did I realize I was shaking so much I could barely drive.

Even so, I took a deep breath and didn’t hesitate to start the car, leaving as fast as I could.

The whole way, I could hear whispers, so many whispers. I drove for a long time until I found a cheap motel on the side of the road. I definitely wasn’t going to sleep there, but it was either that or risk a car accident.

Honestly, I don’t know how they let me into the motel all covered in blood. I just know I don’t have much time, and I’m trying to write all of this down before it’s too late, to warn as many people as possible.

Because I can hear my brother’s laugh in the midst of the voices, and when I looked at myself in the mirror, I saw something in my eyes. *Something that shouldn’t be there*.

If anyone is reading this, I beg you,

**BURN.  THAT.  TREE.**
