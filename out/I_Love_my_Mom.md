I love my mom. 

Every morning, I wake up at 5:30 so that I can help her sit up and watch the sunrise. She has always enjoyed the early morning hours and would always be outside in our chicken coop gathering eggs just as the first beam of sunshine cascaded over the hills. I enjoyed the early days of childhood when we had fresh eggs and milk for breakfast. She’s no longer able to do these things anymore, but that doesn’t hinder the love I have for my beautiful mother.  

Her eyes are wide and gray as she watches the sunrise from her wheelchair. No sound ever escapes from her breath, but it’s been like this for the last six months since she took a turn for the worst. That’s when everyone left us…Dad, Jamie, Susie, and Kade. They told me to leave her alone, too, since she was gone. That’s what they said, but I wasn’t going to give up on my mom. I need her. She needs me. If they wouldn’t help her, I will. I always will. 

After the sunrise, I wheel her to her favorite spot at the table—right by the large window that broadcasted the hills into our view. I make the same meal for her every day. Mom can’t eat a whole lot anymore—just one meal a day. Her body has become nothing but skin and bones because of this, but she’s still my beautiful mom, and she always will be. They kept calling her a corpse, but she’s not. She just needs more help. I place the plate of poached eggs over toast in front of her, sitting down and feeding her what she would willingly eat. Mom couldn’t chew anymore, so I had to move her jaw for her. It always nearly brings tears to my eyes to see her in such a state, and it doesn’t help that my family abandoned her. 

They don’t love her like I do. 

“I bet you would tell me that I’m your special boy if you could talk, huh..” 

Nothing, but I know she can’t help it. She would most certainly brag about how special I am if she had the ability to. 

For the remainder of the day, I place her in front of the tv and cut on her favorite channel. It always helps pass the day along. I know she’ll get better soon, though. She always does. 

I love you, mom. 

I need to run into town today and pick up more fly paper. They have been especially numerous as of late, and I know Mom would love some strawberries—her favorite fruit. 

A sudden knock at the door sends instant chills down my spine. It’s them. My dad and the siblings always try to come and take Mom away from me. She doesn’t need to go away. I can take care of her. I always have! 

My mom loves me too. 

“Zach! I know you’re in there! Open up!” 

I’m not Zach. I’m Mom’s special boy. That’s my name. 

Quickly, I open the cellar doors next to the staircase and place my beautiful, fragile mother in there. The seller has always been dark and a tad spooky, but I knew that she would be safe in there from them. 

“Zach, if you don’t open the door right now, the cops will kick it in themselves!” 

I will always love you, Mom. 

I straighten my composure and gently open the front door. Dad is standing there with three officers. 

“Give her to them, son. We tried it the easy way, but I’m afraid that you’ll have to go to jail this time.” 

“I’m just trying to take care of her!” 

“She’s dead, you fucking psychopath! She’s been dead for six months! We just need her body back, and you’re going to the crazy house!” he screams at me. 

I stare at him as if he’s grown two heads, “No she isn’t! She’s just taken a turn for the worst, but she’s not dead! Mom just needs help!” 

One of the cops sighs, “Alright, kid. Put your hands behind your back. Anything you say or do will be held against you.” 

“Do what he says, son.” 

Mom, please…I love you. 

I know better than to fight against four men double my size, so I comply. Another officer cuffs me, “Where’s the body at, boy?!” 

“C-cellar…” 

The third officer slams open the cellar door, nearly gagging, “Jesus Christ!” 

There’s my mom in all of her radiant beauty. I don’t understand why everyone is so taken aback by her. 

My dad’s eyes fill with tears, “You’re a sick animal, Zach! For fucks sake, her skin is nearly gone! What the actual hell is wrong with you?!” 

“I’m taking care of her!” 

“You can tell that to the court, son,” the cop holding me says as he turns to lead me away. 

“Guys…” 

Everyone turns to the cop, his skin as white as a spirit and his eyes as wide as they could go. Shakily, he points his finger towards the gorgeous woman that is my mom. I smile brightly, my eyes brim with tears. It’s a miracle! 

Her fingers are twitching. 

“Mom…I love you.” 

And I hear it. I hear what I’ve been wanting to hear for the past six months. 

“My…special…boy…”
