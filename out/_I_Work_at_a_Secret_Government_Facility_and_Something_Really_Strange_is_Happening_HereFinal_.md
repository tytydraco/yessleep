Even as a little pup, Buster showed a heightened sensitivity to sound compared to other dogs. He would become paralyzed with fear, when he heard loud noises like thunderstorms, fireworks, car horns, gunshots, or even the vacuum cleaner.

Being a security personnel, I decided to help him deal with the anxiety in the best way possible – to zone them out and become a guard dog. I taught him simple commands to help overcome the problem.

“STAND!!”

Buster would remain standing, alert for the next sequence of commands.

“SIT!!”

He would rest his waist on the floor while his shoulders would be upright. His face fully focused on me.

“DOWN!!”

He would go down on all flours.

“CLOSE!!”

Buster was trained to close his eyes from a very young age. Whenever he found himself in stressful environments, I would gently stroke his head continuously in an effort to calm him down. There were times when I would do this for hours on end.

Over the years, I have made him repeat these maneuvers thousands of times so that it became second nature to him. The training not only enabled him to respond to existing triggers in a calm manner, but also allowed me to earn his trust implicitly.

When the commands are uttered there is NO DOUBT, NO CONFUSION or RELUCTANCE from his part. It’s right down to the business end of things.

And as he got older and stronger, I included more commands to complement his training.

“STAY!!”

Since he had become accustomed to moving around me all the time, I had to first teach him to remain put in his current position.

“GUARD!!”

It could be anything - a ball, a bat, a suitcase or a person. If he was given nothing, it simply meant to guard the piece of earth he was standing on.

“ATTACK!”

He would go after perpetrators or unknown assailants, and I would follow right after him. He instinctively knew that I always had his six.

◆◆◆

So, when I saw these buggers close in on my dog, I decided to revert back to familiar ground.

“BUSTER!!” I yelled as loud as I could from the other end of the room.

He turned to face me, and I immediately sensed a feeling of relief descend upon him.

“STAND!”

“SIT!”

“DOWN!”

“CLOSE!”

“STAND!”

“SIT!”

“DOWN!”

“CLOSE!”

I kept repeating the commands as Buster dutifully started to follow them. He soon became oblivious to the electric discharge that was happening around him, even as it was steadily building in intensity with every passing second. He also ignored the aliens that were trying to close in on him. His focus was on me, all on me.

The aliens were exchanging confused looks with one another, unsure about what exactly was going on. The look of bewilderment on their faces was understandable, for they could not figure out if their job had suddenly gotten easier, or if they were simply walking into a trap. Korelo ordered them to stop wasting time and move ahead.

So they continued to move in cautiously, as if approaching a ticking time bomb that could go off at any second. They looked alert with their batons clenched tightly in their hands.

The jolts of electric current that were already accumulating into Buster, was now lending his form a candescent glow that was only becoming more and more prominent with time.

One of the aliens to the right, then pointed his baton that ejected yet another stream of charge at Buster. The stream however was having the intended effect, because it was successful in severely restricting his movements.

It forced Buster to put in the extra bit of effort to adhere to my commands. The other two aliens also quickly followed suit, targeting him with energy beams from their own devices. As Buster lay down on the floor with his eyes closed, the three alien guards managed to advance considerably coming within just a few feet of him. The alien with the glass dome was also not far behind, and looked ready to get pressed into action at any given moment.

“STAND!” I yelled as loud as I could.

Buster leaned heavily on his shoulder to power his hind legs off the floor. He was using every ounce of strength in him, and finally pushed through to stand fully erect.

The aliens by this point, were literally holding onto their batons with both hands, to try and control the flow of charge that was relentlessly hitting their target. This combined with the electrical discharge already happening around Buster, now created a halo kind of effect along the contours of his ethereal form. But Buster wasn’t bothered about any of this, nor was he making any side glances to check on his captors.

“GUARD!”, I yelled at the top of my voice.

Buster got into position, ready to get into attack mode as soon as the words escaped my mouth.

“SHAKE!!!”

He locked eyes with me briefly, just to make sure he heard me right!

“SHAKE!! BUSTER SHAKE!!!”

And then he vigorously shook his body, just like a wet dog trying to rid itself of wetness.

BANG!!!

A minor explosion erupted near Buster's position, causing substantial damages to an operations console a few feet behind him, and generating thick plumes of smoke. The two aliens who were managing the console had their heads blown off. The security guards even with all their protective gear were thrown back 10 feet and lay scattered on the floor, writhing in pain, their bodies bleeding and severely lacerated.

Buster looked at the carnage all around him, and he finally managed to figure it out. He got it… He finally got it!

Meanwhile Korelo started yelling at his staff with his finger pointed at me. I didn’t need to know alien speak to realise he wanted me dead.

His senior security guard, who was already badly injured, pulled himself off the floor with great difficulty. Crouched on all fours, he slowly lifted his hand, and pointed his baton at me.

But Buster was alert and ready. He lunged at him from behind, and then something strange happened.

In his ghost-like form, I expected him to simply pass through the alien and emerge on the other side. Instead, he wound up entering his body through the rectum, and slowly worked his way up.

The baton instantly dropped to the floor as the alien writhed in agony, resembling the likes of someone undergoing the painful transformation of a werewolf on a full moon night.

His body was being violently lacerated by the electrical discharge that was accompanying Buster as he moved upward towards the head, from the waist down.

Buster then slowly emerged from the mouth to descend briefly, only to rise up again like a serpent.

He calmly looked at the alien who had kicked him in the face just hours earlier.

And yet, only half his body emerged from the mouth, while the rest remained inside, completely frying his head from within.

Buster seemed to have realized the longer he waited, the greater the torment it would unleash on his enemies. The alien’s head began to swell like a pumpkin as he shrieked in blind pain. I could almost see his head bursting at the seams.

SPLAT!!

The headless body hit the floor with a loud thud, with fragments of blood and bone scattering everywhere.

 

Korelo’s crew members were absolutely mortified and immediately vacated their stations to form a huddle in a corner of the large oval room. They looked panic stricken at the rampage Buster was on, and turned a deaf ear even to the emergency beeps emanating from the giant screen.

A quick peek at the screen revealed that the missiles were only a few minutes away. The jets that were already in transit, had now reached Korelo’s ship, and started a fresh line of attack.

The force shield so far was still absorbing all the fire power, but was fast depleting in strength.

Also, my own government deployed another squadron of fighter jets. There were atleast 40 of them this time. And according to my estimate, they were probably 30-40 minutes away from reaching the ship.

However, there was a silver lining for Korelo here. The charging was almost 80% done, and nearing completion. The solitary ship was still circling the mother ship and delivering a huge charge of power. He just needed a little more time for whatever he had planned next.

Meanwhile, Buster menacingly started moving towards the frightened crew members. They looked helpless and trapped, and were clinging to each other.

I almost felt sorry for them, but they had no reservations about destroying my own species. They probably even just saw it as an ordinary day’s work, casually wiping out civilizations with the press of a button.

So, I was actually enjoying this, seeing them in their misery.

And then suddenly, Buster disappeared into thin air, the electrical arcing that was continuously happening around him also came to an abrupt end. I looked outside and saw the subsidiary ship had come to a halt.

I turned my head to look at Captain Korelo. He had now turned off the amber light as well. He pointed his finger at his crew members and quietly told them to get back to their seats. They complied reluctantly.

Right then, two aliens teleported themselves into the oval room. They both came and stood next to me on either side of the chair. They looked like security officers and I could tell from their demeanor that they were summoned to keep an eye on me, and to keep me quiet by whatever means necessary.

Korelo then turned back to focus on the screen. The only remaining subsidiary ship also now exited the force field and shot up into the sky like a rocket.

Three of the six fighter jets went after it while the rest remained in position. The spaceship then executed a rapid turn, maneuvering along a semi-circular arc that immediately positioned itself behind the pursuing jets.

The spaceship, spinning like a frisbee, discharged a 360 degree barrage of fire upon the planes, simultaneously destroying them in the process.

It then skillfully began to traverse along the contours of the mothership's force shield, systematically outpacing and outmaneuvering the remaining fighter planes.

The pilots struggled to cope with the spaceship’s speed and got eliminated one after the other.

It then went after the two missiles that were enroute to the spaceship, turning them into rubble in rapid succession. The spaceship later re-entered the force shield and came back to its original position next to the mothership.

Korelo immediately turned around to face me. He had just managed to deal with another urgent threat and bought himself some more time.

He got straight to the point, “Michael, Get out! I’ve had a change of heart and have decided to spare your life. Get out of here before I change my mind.”

“You can take your dog with you as well,” he finished off, pointing to Buster’s body on the floor.

The cuffs came off at that very moment, and I was no longer confined to the chair.

I didn’t have to be a bright man to realize what was at play here.

To deal effectively with the external threat of my own government, he needed to charge his ship to full capacity. But he couldn’t proceed with the plan since that would mean enabling Buster to wreak havoc from the inside, which put Korelo in a Catch 22 situation.

He was probably hoping by getting rid of me, Buster would also follow suit.

So I decided to simply play along for the time being.

“How am I supposed to do that? My dog is dead because of you.” I said.

Korelo paused briefly for a moment before continuing to speak.

“You can confine him in his current state by using a container we provide, but you must summon him to you, and see the task through. “

“And why would I do that?” I asked.

“You are anyway going to kill us all. Once your ship starts to work again, you are definitely going to go through with your plans. So why should I do anything you ask of me?”

Korelo replied, “That plan has been scrapped. We are only looking to leave Planet Earth. Nobody else needs to get hurt. This should be seen as a win-win situation for both of us. “

“If that is true, you would have already done it. I understand that this ship has developed problems, but you could have used the other one to escape,” I said pointing at the smaller spaceship hovering close by.

I saw a look of reluctance appear on the Captain’s face, and I immediately understood. I suddenly burst out laughing.

“HAHAHA!!”

“You can’t leave Earth without the mothership, can you?”

“Well, well, well… It seems the Captain is bit of a control freak…..isn’t he?”

“Why am I not surprised? People like you have the obsessive need to have everything under your control. No wonder you are trapped.”

“So what is it Captain…..don’t trust your own team huh?” I asked Korelo smiling.

He simply glared at me in silence, and that only made me want to laugh even louder.

“HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!”

I knew I was being dramatic, but I just wanted his whole crew to witness someone laugh at their boss.

For a second, I wondered if these rascals even had a funny bone to understand what I was saying. But I instantly felt some satisfaction, when I saw Korelo’s green face turn a deep shade of violet.

I could see that it was torturing him to sit and negotiate his survival with a lowly earthling, that too, an ordinary security guard at that.

I slowly leaned back in my chair and relaxed.

”Anyways, I am comfortable being where I am. And I have no interest in leaving.” I said.

“But I do have a better idea!”

“Why not all of us die together?”

“We don’t even have to do a thing! They will come, and do all the work for us!” I said pointing to the cluster of fighter jets fast approaching the spaceship.

Korelo was trying hard to maintain his composure. He took a quick peek at the screen, and then began speaking to me in a slow and menacing voice.

“Michael, you would be better served to accept my offer. Not only for your own wellbeing, but for that of the entire planet as well. I am not without options here. You have seen the devastation that thing can cause,” he said pointing to his spaceship.

“Well, it is capable of a whole lot more. You can be rest assured if I am pushed to the wall, I will use it to flatten out multiple cities, and millions of people will die.”

“And in the off chance, me or my crew members don’t make it out of here safely, the repercussions would be dire for Planet Earth. My part of the world will not take this lying down. “ Korelo warned me.

“Well, I seriously doubt that. You are just a private contractor right? I challenged him.

“I mean, who loses sleep over the death of a contractor?”

“The answer is likely no one!” I declared, not bothering to even wait for a reply.

“They will probably assign the project to someone else immediately. But for argument’s sake, let’s assume, I do help you and you do manage to escape Earth. Why shouldn’t I consider the possibility that you might go and station yourself somewhere in the Solar system that is just beyond our reach, but well within yours, to attack us again at a moment’s notice?” I queried out loud.

“Maybe you will park your ship somewhere beyond Saturn, and then slowly bid your time waiting for reinforcements. That does not sound like a very positive scenario for Earth now, does it?”

“I mean I am alive right now only because you see me as a cash cow for some research group. You expect me to believe that you will leave Planet Earth alone, when you’ve been waiting for decades to wreck this place.” I remarked, skepticism evident in my tone.

“Your little presentation today about your expansion plans was bad enough for a general sitting. And now that you have been so thoroughly inconvenienced, I shudder to think what a revised plan would entail. Perhaps, it’s best not to release the animal now that it has been caged.” I concluded with satisfaction.

 “Also, I really do doubt if other alien beings out there are obsessed with Earth the way you are, for them to sit and make multiple trips over the years. Makes me wonder if Earth is actually a passion project of yours,“ I added, as an afterthought.

 “And who knows?

“Maybe, just maybe, they might even move on to another planet and leave Earth alone. Or, if they do decide to come after us, we will figure it out. Either ways, you are not getting any help from me.”

I waited for him to react. But all I got was silence and a murderous glare from korelo.

I continued to speak, “You killed my friend and brother, Captain. And then you tortured my dog.”

“You don’t deserve second chances.”

“And considering you already called me an agent of death, perhaps I was put in your orbit by somebody else to take you down. “

“Heck! When this ship goes down, taking all of you to your deaths, I might even miraculously survive! You never know!

“And when that happens, I will be waiting here, ready, to take a piss on your filthy corpse!” I finished off.

I was half hoping Korelo would snap, and go for the kill. It would give Buster the right kind of impetus to go to town with these scoundrels.

But he just sighed deeply, and signaled his guards to take care of me. He then slowly turned around to continue to lead his crew.

The two guards held me by the collar of my shirt, and tried to get me off the chair. When I resisted, I felt a hard punch to my plexus. I doubled over in pain only to get punched in the face again. I fell to the floor clutching to my sides, when the guard kicked me again in the stomach.

Both the aliens were incredibly strong, and the pain was excruciating. I knew my ribs had cracked in multiple places.

I began to cough up blood and started fading in and out of consciousness. They then dragged my body to the portion of the room that had the teleportation device. I could see a large red coloured rectangular object fixed to the ceiling.

As I lay on my back, breathing heavily, I saw one of the alien’s pick up Buster’s mortal remains and place it next to me.

While I could no longer see him in his spirit form anymore, I knew he was close by, desperately trying to do whatever he could to save me.

I tried to speak as clearly as possible, while fighting through bouts of coughs.

“Buster…Stay!....Guard!……Atta…”

I was blinded by a flash of white light, and immediately faded out of consciousness.…..

**A Few Months Later.....** 

After buying flowers from the nearby florist, I continued down the road, finally turning right to enter through the gates of the cemetery. Few minutes in, I stopped by the headstone of my cousin Henry, and laid down some of the flowers I brought for him.

I said a little prayer for the departed soul and then continued walking ahead. A minute later, I pulled out a foldable chair, and sat by the tombstones of my wife Jessica and dog Buster. Both of them were buried alongside each other, which I thought was fitting, and their headstones looked beautiful.

It’s been 3 months since the alien attack happened, and the world has slowly begun to move on. But things have not been all that easy for me.

Jessica’s surgery had gone well, and she was put on the ventilator to help deal with her breathing problems. But when Korelo used one of our own missiles to bomb the power grid, it caused an acute power shortage for the entire city.

The explosion and the bombings also resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, putting a great strain on the hospital resources. They had no option but to prioritize on healthier patients, which meant letting Jessica go.

It didn’t help that I was at that point, lying unconscious, battered and bruised in a hospital.

Had it not been for some well-wisher of mine who rescued me from the desert, I would also probably be dead by now. It took me over a week to regain consciousness, but by then it was already too late. She was gone.

The cemetery’s groundskeeper William went out his way to help me, even assigning burial plots at a location that gave me the space and privacy to grieve for the dead. I guess I have Adam to be grateful for that.

When I eventually went to collect Jessica’s remains, the coroner had issued me William’s calling card. Apparently, he had also come by twice to the hospital to check on me, but I was still unconscious back then.

So when I finally did contact him at the cemetery, I was surprised to see that Buster had already been buried there. He also offered the vacant plot next to Buster for my wife and I was grateful.

I guess he must have his own crazy alien story with Adam, for him to be so helpful towards me.

Meanwhile, I haven’t seen the alien with the French beard since I last saw him at his shop. I knew at some level I should be a little cross at him, for all subterfuge that he orchestrated on me and Buster without our knowledge.

But after seeing a mad man like Korelo, and what he had planned for us, I could fully see and understand his point of view.

With regards to the Captain, I learned from the news that our pilots managed to take down both spaceships, killing all aliens on board.

The media dubbed it as “The Greatest Victory of Mankind”.

“I know you too have a share in that buddy. Atta boy!” I said, smiling while placing flowers by Buster’s tombstone.

I sat beside them for an hour before finally getting up to go back home. When I reached my apartment, I saw a small rectangular box by the door. There was also a letter underneath it with my name on it. I opened the letter and began reading.

Dear Michael,

How are you doing?

I hope you are better, at least much better than when I found you in the middle of the desert. I know the last few months haven’t been easy.

You must have many questions that bother you, and I would have ideally liked to see you in person to answer them. But I am not sure if I am somebody you would like to meet right now.

So I am writing this letter to explain my side of things, in the hopes that it will give you some clarity and closure.

My twin brother and I are part of a Universal Collective that was formed to combat players like Korelo. So we settle down in various planets that are vulnerable to such attacks, and help local civilizations as and when required. Our motive is to provide technological and strategic guidance that can be of help to these governments.

Michael, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t puzzled when you walked into my shop with your bizarre tale. It made absolutely no sense until you showed me the telescope. Even then, I had a hard time believing you.

Most of all, I never expected you or Buster to end up in Korelo’s ship. It was a contingency that we thought would never come to pass.

But somebody like Korelo has always been a formidable opponent, and even civilizations that are more advanced have struggled to defeat him.

So when I saw his telescope in your hand, I had to account for the possibility of the two of you coming face to face with each other, whatever the circumstances, and however remote it maybe.

I had a duty to use all avenues that were available to me.

So I decided to put a chip in your hand, while my brother stuffed a ball like object into a muffin, and fed it to Buster. The ball is actually our version of an EMP device that has the ability to severely cripple defence, and aviation systems. But it can be activated only from within the confines of a spaceship, and not from the outside.

The device is designed to lay dormant and be virtually undetectable in such a state. And it can be activated only at a very specific frequency, right down to the decimal level. The chip that could emit such a frequency was inserted in your hand with a syringe gun.

And when it activated, it also began to store everything you see and experience through your own eyes.

So when we recovered the chip after admitting you in the hospital, we too got a glimpse of all that transpired inside the spaceship.

Michael, I am going to be frank with you.

I knew Buster wouldn’t survive if the chip turned on. Nor did I think you would live if you came in the crosshairs of someone like Korelo. And yet, it is a call I would repeatedly make, if the fate of a civilization hangs in the balance.

But I never expected to see what came next following Buster’s demise. That was something extremely rare even in my part of the world. It usually happens only when the departed has a very close bond with the living.

However, I do apologize for not being honest with you, and for misleading you even when I knew your life would be in danger.

Considering the bravery you and Buster showed in confronting Korelo and his crew, I know you can understand better than most that sometimes, fighting for a cause takes precedence over our own individual lives.

If you ever feel the need to talk to me, I’m always here for you. I can be reached through William.

This is not the end. Till then so long my friend!

Regards,

Adam

I put the letter away, and opened the box. There was a pair of sunglasses inside. I removed it from the box to take a closer look. It looked like regular sunglasses. But the frame had a series of small black buttons on either side. There was also a small note attached to the box.

It read, -

Michael

Attn: Please be careful if you are in the vicinity of a large power source, or when there is a bolt of lightning coming your way. And always watch your six!

I put on the glasses and pressed the first button I could reach.

All my surroundings suddenly transformed into shades of amber, and I immediately turned around to see…. Buster happily wagging his tail at me…
