Everyone that reads this please, \*please\* listen to me! Something is not right with that meteor that will pass us. I swear I can feel it. 

Everyone is so excited but I, **I**, know better! It's not right. Even Lisa is all up and arms for this stupid piece of rock that'll pass us. I don't buy it. Even in school everyone is talking about it. I've tried telling people that it's wrong and that we are in terrible danger. 

But seems that only damaged my already horrible reputation. Damnit they just won't listen! I've even tried telling mom and dad about it and I know for a *fact* that I am too old for them to dismiss me with some childish rambling. But still, they won't listen! Something is coming I can feel it in my bones. Like a dog can feel thunder I can feel this doom drifting towards us and instead of raising our weapons we are welcoming it with open arms! 

I'll keep you updated when this thing comes closer. Also, any tips on building a bunker in the backyard on your own without anyone noticing would be helpful too.

  
Edit: Shit guys it came closer! It's all over the news and it's even visible now with a telescope! I've looked at it! It's shaped oddly, like some sort of oval? Like some ship. I swear this is all going to be an alien take over! I bet it's some messed alien ship. Damnit my bunker isn't ready yet.

Lisa is all happy about it but I can't help having nightmares about it. I've been waking up regularly in a cold sweat and shivering. I can't help feeling paranoid about this shit. My parents have gotten more distant as well. They its "because of my childish and insolent behavior!". Apparently digging a hole in the backyard like some anon guy told me wasn't the best idea for a bunker. Never trusting Ao3 again.

I've looked up online some things that could protect me from any alien mental manipulation (I mean you never know) and I'll be building some of these triangular things with sticks and get a few crystals. And maybe I'll even look into how to build some radio into something that can fight against waves. 

Obviously I won't put on one of these weird hats, that's dumb.

Anyway, I've found some online forums as well that *finally* agree with me. Though they keep talking about "trumpets and horses", don't know what's that about.  At least they agree with me, thats what counts. They also keep trying to take my weekly allowance? "For the cause of our souls" they keep saying. I gave them 5 dollars. I need to keep as much as I can for the bunker im building.

I'll keep you all updated if anything happens again, sorry is this edit is a little but just so much happened. If you know any forums that won't demand a 50 dollar entry to support some "cause" I'd be very thankful.
