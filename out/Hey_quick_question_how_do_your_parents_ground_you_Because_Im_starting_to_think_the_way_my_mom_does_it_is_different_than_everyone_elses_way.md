So do your parents put you in a box when they’re mad at you? I used to think this was a normal thing, but I’ve recently started public school after being homeschooled for my entire life, and I don’t think anyone else does this.

My name is Ainsley, and I started middle school this year (Seventh grade, I lived in a place where sixth grade was a part of elementary school, but apparently that’s not normal in the place we just moved to), and my mom decided that I shouldn’t be homeschooled anymore so I could learn proper social skills. I like school, for the most part. The teachers are nice, for the most part, and I’ve made a couple of friends. But now that I’ve hung out with people my age, I’ve begun to realize that some of the things my mom does are kind of weird.

When I asked my mom about it, she shrugged and said that I’m just different, and the way people do things in this city is different too, but I’m not sure if she’s lying or not. So that’s why I’m asking you guys.

The first thing I noticed was that there was a girl in my english class that had a missing hand, which wasn’t unusual at first, but it’s been four months, and it hasn’t grown back. Not only that, but when I asked her when it was going to grow back, she looked at me like I was insane.

“My hand can’t just grow back. Is it your first day on Earth or something?”

I thought she was being rude, but everyone else at my table agreed with her.

“Wait, but…mine grow back.”

“No they don’t! Stop lying about shit to seem cool!”

“I’m not lying!”

“Really? Prove it.”

“I’ll send you a video on Snapchat tonight.

So after I got home from school, I grabbed a kitchen knife, cut my thumb off, and filmed it growing back. It was a bit tricky, since it takes like three minutes to re-grow, so I had to make a few cuts, and when I sent the video to her, she said it was fake.

Then, I made the mistake of telling my mom about it, and she flipped out.

“AINSLEY! YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEND THINGS ONLINE WITHOUT ME LOOKING AT THEM FIRST!”

“But Celeste said that people’s hands don’t grow back! I was just trying to show her that mine do!”

“Well, some people don’t. It’s rude to point out yours do. You can’t just post stuff like this on social media! It’s dangerous. You could get arrested for posting something like that.”

“Oh. I’m sorry.”

“Well, I’m afraid sorry isn’t enough. Hand me your phone. You’re grounded.”

I sighed, and handed it to her.

That’s the other thing, getting grounded. Apparently my mom does it differently? My friend Anya came to school today all upset because her parents grounded her.

I was confused, because she was still at school. If she was grounded, wouldn’t she be stuck at home?

She giggled, and said she was allowed to go to school, she just couldn’t go anywhere else, and she couldn’t be on her phone.

I don’t understand how they could ground her and let her constantly leave, but I didn’t ask any other questions, because I didn’t her to think I was weird, but now I’m wondering if it is, and I don’t want to ask my mom, because she’s just gonna say it’s normal, or ground me again.

Here’s how my mom grounds me.

The first thing she does is take away all my electronics. Sometimes she goes through my texts too. That’s a more recent thing, I got my phone and computer last year. She’s got this tracking app that lets her see anything I do on them. She says it’s for my safety.

My mom is REALLY paranoid about my safety. There’s camera’s in almost every room in the house, I’ve got an airtag on my backpack, my phone tracks me, and I think there might even be a microchip in my arm. The only reason I’m able to post this without her knowing is because I’m using a laptop in my school’s library, and my mom doesn’t use Reddit, so I know she won’t see this.

After she’s taken my phone and stuff away, she’ll give me a lecture before she tells me how long I’ll be grounded. Usually it’s a week, sometimes it’s shorter, sometimes it’s longer. The last time I was grounded it was for a week, so that’s the example I’m going to use.

Then she tells me to turn my back to her so I can’t see what she’s gonna use, but it’s usually something that works quickly. Usually it’s the gun, or the syringe, occasionally she uses the knife or the weight, and one time, when she was *really* mad at me, she’ll stick my head underwater. That hurt a *lot.*

Whatever she uses, everything goes black, and when I wake up, I’m in the box.

The first few were lined with wood, but when I learned how to kick open the siding and get un-grounded early, she got one that was lined with steel. No amount of kicking will bust it open.

It’s big enough to fit me, but it’s still extremely claustrophobic. When I was little, I was able to sit up inside it, but now that I’ve gotten taller, I can only lie down inside it. The air in the box is thin, and not breatheable for very long, so I’m constantly blacking out and re-awakening. It’s extremely dark inside, but I’ve got great night vision after years of doing this, so I’m able to see pretty well. Not that there’s much to see anyways. There’s just blank wooden walls.

The isolation is not the worst part. Hearing what lies below is the worst part.

The ground has voices. Screaming voices. Whispering voices. The only time I can hear them is when I’m underneath it. They repeat the same phrases over and over again.

“Please…please don’t do this…I love you. PLEASE! I LOVE YOU!”

“MEN! FALL BACK! RETREAT!”

“I’m just going to…rest my eyes a little…”

“Goodbye.”

“Fuck you.”

“Why…why…”

The voices are the kind you don’t hear with your ears, but the kind you *feel* with your entire being. They make my head hurt, which is inconvenient, because my head most likely already hurts, because it takes the slowest to fix itself, so oftentimes I’m waking up with a gaping head wound that’s only partially healed.

What’s worse is the voices that I hear with my ears. Sometimes, the people I hear yelling or whispering will be talking to me at the same time they’re yelling or whispering at me. They keep saying that they’re sorry I’m seeing this, they can’t control it, and they wish they could make it stop for me. They mean well, I think but hearing the same voice saying two different things at the same time is even more disorienting.

As time passes, I start to *become* the voices. Suddenly, I’m a tall man, holding a gun, running from an unseen enemy while getting sprayed with bullets. I *can taste the blood in my mouth and I’m afraid, I’m thinking, God, why does it have to end like this, I promised Cindy I’d come home, I’m going to leave her to raise our child all alone, I won’t even get to meet them, they’re gonna grow up without a father.*

*I can smell the blood, I can hear the screams, people crying for their homes and their mothers, my brothers- these are my brothers, and we’re all dying here.*

*I bleed into the dirt that I instinctively know is right above this box.*

*And then I’m a different voice. I’m a lady driving home from work, and I’m exhausted. I’ve been working overtime, and the drive home is so long…and they’re playing christmas carols on the radio.*

*They kind of remind me of the lullabies my mom used to sing to me. They make me feel so calm…so relaxed…but I can’t…sleep…just…*

*Airbags deploy. I fly through the windshield, and land on the cold hard ground, right where this box is underneath.*

Darkness. Time to collect myself. Time to remember that I’m me, and I’m not anyone else. I forget when I become the voices. I worry that one day I’ll forget everything and I won’t be able to be myself again.

Time in the dark moves slower than the light. It feels like I’ve been grounded for years, but I know it’s only been a couple days.

Sometimes, the voice is me, and all of a sudden, I’m re-living an old memory. That’s a little easier, because I usually know what’ll happen at the end.

*“Mommy, what’s this?”*

*“It’s a diving board. You jump off of it.”*

*“But it’s really tall, and there’s nothing underneath. Isn’t there supposed to be water?”*

*“This is a special diving board. Just jump.”*

*“But…it’s scary.”*

*“You’ll be fine.”*

*“The last time I fell, it really, really hurt!”*

*“I’ll take you to Target and let you pick out a new toy if you jump. You can pick out anything you want.”*

*“...Even the Bratz doll that you said I couldn’t get?”*

*“Yes, even that.”*

*Without hesitation, I threw myself off, pretending I could fly. For a moment, it feels like I can. But then, the ground starts to get closer, and I slam into it.*

*It hurt just as much as it did last time.*

For months, Mom made me jump off the board over and over again to get me used to it, before she switched to something else.

When the voice is me, snapping out of it is less disorienting, because I remember my name and stuff way easier, but it’s disappointing, knowing that I didn’t wake up in my bed, safe and sound and given a reward for behaving, and I’m actually grounded.

Sometimes I’m me, and then I’m immediately someone else, which is even weirder because then I have to try and remember which one is real. It’s like when you take two colors of playdough and mash them together- it’s almost impossible to separate them. What if, one day, I’m unable to separate them, and I’m stuck as half Ainsley, half someone else?

One minute I’m-

*Riding on my bicycle, unaware of the driver that’s just swerved, and now I’m soaring into the windshield-*

*-and I scream as the flames burn me alive-my mother rushes out screaming my name, but her voice is getting fuzzy-Mom said it would hurt, but I didn’t think it would be as bad as this-Why is she so far away-Why do I have to do this?*

*I am the little boy who was hit by a drunk driver. I am the woman who had a heart attack. I am the girl who didn’t know she was allergic to peanuts. I am the man who tripped, fell, and hit his head just a bit too hard. I am all of those people, and Ainsley at the same time.*

But eventually, I go through all the voices on that particular spot the box is underneath, until there’s only one left. Even though the voices change depending on the spot where the box is, it’s always the same voice at the end, and it does not shut up.

*She wanted to be a doctor. He wanted to marry Alex, the love of his life. She wanted to go to her best friend’s sleepover. But they all met their ends before they could.*

*Do you understand, little one? Do you understand now? You’ve been through many of the things that they’ve been through, but you’ve got a long way to go.*

*They’re jealous of you. They never got a second chance. Nobody gets a second chance, except you.* 

*You never should have existed, little one. You are an abomination.*

*But maybe that’s a good thing.*

I can never respond to the voice. It’s the only one I can’t become, but I can’t speak back to it. It feels oddly familiar.

And then they cycle loops around again and again, until my punishment is over and I get un-grounded.

According to my friend Anya, when she gets grounded, she can’t use her computer or hang out with friends. I asked all my classmates. All of them said pretty much the same thing.

So does anyone else’s parents do this? Because I’m starting to think this isn’t normal. Should I be concerned???
