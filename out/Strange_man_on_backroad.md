So, this happed about two years ago but I still remember it clearly , I was heading home from a friend's place. It was late, probably close to midnight, and I decided to take the backroads. Usually, I don't mind them; they're quicker and less traffic, but this time, it was a little different. This particular road cuts through a pretty dense wooded area. We're talking trees on both sides, thick enough that they block out almost all the light. On a night like this, it was pitch black, the kind of darkness that’s like oh shit this is spooky .

As I was driving, my headlights caught something up ahead. It looked like a car pulled over on the shoulder. As I got closer, I could see it was an older sedan, and the hood was popped open. There was a guy standing there, bent over the engine, like he was trying to fix something. I couldn't see exactly what he was doing, but his hands were moving around and the car wasn’t running , so I figured he was having car trouble.

I'm generally a helpful person, so I slowed down and pulled up a bit behind his car, making sure to leave plenty of space. I didn't want to get too close, especially since it was so dark and I was alone. Rolling down my window, I called out, "Hey, do you need help?" I kept the car running and didn't get out, just in case. He looked up when I spoke, so I knew he heard me, but he didn't say anything. He just looked at me.

Maybe he didn't hear me clearly, or maybe he was just surprised, so I repeated myself, a little louder this time. "Hey! Do you need help?" Still nothing. No response, no nod, no wave – just silence and a stare. And then, he started walking towards my car.

That's when my gut started screaming at me. There was something really off about the whole situation. The silence, the way he was moving, the fact that he hadn't said a single word – it all felt wrong. As he got closer, I started to feel a knot of anxiety tighten in my chest.

"YO... YO, YO!!" I yelled, as loud as I could. I was trying to get him to stop, to say something, anything. But he just kept coming, steadily walking towards the front of my car. It was like he was locked onto me, and nothing I said was registering.

I didn't wait to see what he was going to do. My heart was pounding, and my mind was racing. I slammed my foot on the gas and took off. I didn't look back. I just drove as fast as I could until I was out of the woods and back on a main road.

I'm still not sure what that guy was up to. Maybe he really did need help and was just a bit weird, but something about the whole encounter felt predatory. I'm just glad I trusted my instincts and got out of there when I did. It's definitely made me think twice about stopping to help strangers .
