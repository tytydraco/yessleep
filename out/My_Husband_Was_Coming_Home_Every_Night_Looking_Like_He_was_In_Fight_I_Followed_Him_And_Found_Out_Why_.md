At first, it was a small bruise on his cheek. When I pressed my husband on it he told me he had an accident at work. 

I had no reason not to believe him, accidents happen, but it was slightly odd he would have an accident while punching numbers into a computer. It would have made more sense if he was working in construction. 

I didn’t think much of it until he came home the next night with a black eye. If his excuse was another accident at work it wasn’t going to cut it. 

When he got home he tried his best to avoid me, so I knew something was up. 

“What happened to your eye, honey?”

I could see his brain ticking over as he tried to think of an answer. 

“Some idiot cut in front of me at the gas station and when I confronted him about it he went berserk and punched me in the face.” 

For as long as I have known my husband he has always been a terrible liar. “That’s awful honey. Did you report him?”

“I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. Just paid for my gas and got the hell out of there.”

I could tell from his face he was lying to me, which only made me suspect he was doing something other than working. 


Over the next few days his injuries were getting worse and his lies more elaborate. He started to get more distant and a little less like my husband every day. Someone was hurting my husband and it was taking a toll on him.

He stumbled in the front door barely able to hold himself up. I could see the pain etched into his face as he fell into my arms. 

“My god, what happened to you?” 

As he struggled to get words out of his mouth I looked down and saw the bone sticking out from his limp arm. 

The doctor at the hospital pulled me aside when he was finished seeing to my husband's broken arm. He had the same concerned look on his face after my husband's explanation for his broken arm didn’t satisfy his curiosity. 

“You’re the fourth couple this week in my surgery with similar injuries. While not unusual, but all having the same explanation, is.” 

The doctor's words rattled around in my head on the drive home. If my husband wasn’t going to tell me what was going on, I was going to find out one way or another. 

I got in my car right after my husband left for work and started following him. He worked in an office in town so I was suspicious when he started traveling in the opposite direction. 

He stopped his car outside an abandoned building which was strange because it was in the middle of nowhere. He waited for others to turn up, all men who looked just as battered as he was. 

Then it hit me, my husband's favourite film was Fight Club and I read somewhere that fight clubs exist, but not in a million years would I think my mild-mannered husband would be the kind of guy who would enjoy having his teeth knocked out.
 
I waited until the men disappeared through the doors of the abandoned building before getting out of my car. I peered through one of the many dirty windows and watched as my husband along with the other started taking their clothes. 

“Why do they have to be naked,” I thought to myself. 

They all lined up as if they were waiting for something as men in white overalls collected their clothes. 

What happened next was like something straight out of a horror movie. I had to cover my mouth to stop myself from screaming as a giant Praying Mantis came crawling out of one of the doors. 

I wanted to run in and pull my husband out of there, but I was too terrified to move. The Praying Mantis crawled over to the men before it stood on its hind legs. The creature loomed over the men who just seemed to stand as if awaiting their fate. 

Suddenly one of the men stepped forward and began doing a strange rhythmic dance. The Praying Mantis watched on as the man continued to dance. Suddenly the creature lashed out hitting the man and sending him flying across the concrete floor. 

Next, my husband stood forward and started doing the same strange dance as if he were trying to impress the Praying Mantis. 

The creature swayed from side to side in rhythm with my husband's dancing before embracing him with its grasping forelegs. 

I was suddenly sick to my stomach as he started having sex with the creature. Just as I was about to run back to my car in disgust, I watched as the Praying Mantis bit down on his head and began chewing it like an apple as my husband came. 

When the whole mating ritual ended the men in white overalls dragged my husband’s headless body to another room. 

I was overwhelmed with a barrage of emotions, fear, disgust, and grief, that I didn’t know whether to cry or scream. 

My legs felt like jelly as I made my way around the back. 
A bright light radiated from one of the windows at the back of the building. The source of the light came from large heat lamps that hovered over a group of large eggs. 

Some seemed to be rattling as if they were ready to hatch. The torment of watching my husband die barely sank in when all of a sudden a man who looked identical to my husband emerged from one of the eggs. 

Men in white overalls came into the room and handed him the clothes my other husband was wearing before he was eaten alive.

I jumped in my car and made it home before whatever came out of that egg did. 

I sat in the kitchen contemplating packing my bags and getting as far away as possible when suddenly my husband's car pulled up into the drive. 

He came through into the kitchen with a big smile on his face and all his injuries magically healed.   

“What happened to your broken arm and don’t lie to me,” I demanded. My body was still shaking from earlier, and I wasn’t sure if I was safe with the thing that looked like my husband. 

“I don’t know what you're talking about, honey. All I know is I woke up feeling like a brand new man today.”

“I followed you to that abandoned building today. I saw what happened. I saw you hatch from that egg.” 

The man who looked like my husband had a look on his face as if he had just lost a hand of poker.

“I promise, I’m still the man you married. I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want to worry you, but I was dying. Remember a few months ago when I was having trouble with my digestion? It turned out I had stage four stomach cancer.”

“What does that have to do with a giant Praying Mantis?”I asked.

That Praying Mantis was the answer to my prayers. I’m cured and feel better than I ever felt. I swear to you, I’m still the man you married.”

“A part of me believed him and he did look healthier,” I thought to myself as I walked over and threw my arms around him. 

But just as I was about to forgive him I watched as a green translucent film of flesh spread across his eyeballs as he blinked, sending a shiver of dread down my spine.
