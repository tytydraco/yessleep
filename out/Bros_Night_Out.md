My name is Jake and, I have something interesting to share, as I am writing this, I am in a hotel room with my friend Connor, I don't know how long we'll be staying in this hotel, but maybe in a month or so, we'll be ok to go back home, so, onto the story.

&#x200B;

I was in my room one day, on my computer going through Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, I was bored on that day, my dad came in my room and sat on the bed, I looked at him and said. "Need something dad?" He looked at me with a soft smile. "I've noticed you've been bored lately, your finally done with school and passed all grades, I'm proud of you son." He said in a soft tone of voice. "Don't mention dad, I'll do everything in my heart to be a good son." I said in a happy tone, then my dad said. "You know, I'm going out of town for a couple of weeks, you can feel free to have a sleep over with Connor and Rob." He said, stretching his arms. "Really?" I said in an excited tone. "Of course champ." I went up to him and hugged him. "You're the best dad! I love you." "Hehe, love you too son."

&#x200B;

On the same day, at 9:00pm, the doorbell rang, and my father went to go open the door, of course, Rob and Connor were there. "Ah, it's good to see you guys again, how are you boys doing?" My dad said in a friendly tone. "Meh, I'm doing good." Rob said in a bored tone. "O-Oh, doing excellent!" Connor said in a happy voice, Rob was the kind of person who is intimidating and chill, Connor is always shy, but very nice. "Alright, I'm gonna head out of town to see Dason, if you boys need anything, give me a call, and don't wreck the house while I'm gone." My dad said in a normal voice. "You can count on us sir!" Connor said. "Alright." Rob said, as he let out a huff. "Ok dad, see you when you get back." I said as my dad went to his car and drove off, I closed the door and sighed of confidence. "So, since my dad's gone for the week now, what do you guys wanna do?" I said in a excited voice. "The only ideas I have are watching movies or videos on YouTube." Connor said, I thought it was a good idea, but Rob thought otherwise. "Really? That's just fucking boring."

&#x200B;

Connor exclaimed. "How is that boring?! You act like we've seen every movie in the multiverse!" Rob grunted. "Whatever, sounds boring, but Jake seems to like it so, that's 1 thing on our list." I came with my own idea. "I got some games we can play." "What kind of games?" Rob asked. "Any kind, video games, board games, card games." I replied. "That's something I find boring, board games, but Video games, yes, I can work with." Connor said, I then remembered something I found 2 days ago. "You know, me and my dad found something 2 days ago, I can show it to you, right here, right now." I said, smirking. "No fucking way, show us!" I then pulled out this really ancient leaf, Connor was somehow amazed, Rob was just confused. "Your fucking kidding? A FUCKING leaf?!" Rob yelled. "Not just any leaf, this leaf was an object that was very rare, there was only 5 of its kind, and it was called the bloodhound leaf." I said. "Meh, seems cool, it's better than those tarantula fuckers, those crawlers scare the living shit out of me." Rob said, before letting out a shudder of fear. "Oh, is someone scared?\~" I said, teasing Rob, he then yelled. "N-NO! I-I'm just very arachnophobia." "Sure, you are."

&#x200B;

Connor then said. "Even though I wanted to see some sort of rare merchandise, I can count the leaf as rare." I then put the leaf back in my pocket. "Alright, I'm gonna get some snacks and some drinks, any requests." Rob said. "Um... Chips and a sprite." I said, Rob turned to Connor. "I would like some chips too, and I would like a coke please." Connor said, then Rob went to the kitchen to get a drink, then Rob backed up and yelled. "WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!" Me and Connor ran to Rob, then we saw a pair of orange glowing eyes, staring at us, I said, reassuring Rob. "It's probably just a wild animal." "I-I hope so, that scared the shit out of me." Rob said in a shaky voice, me and Connor went back to the living room couch, Rob came back with the snacks and drink.

&#x200B;

Everything was doing good until... 12:00pm, me, Rob, and Connor were just watching movies since there was no more games to play. "So, Rob, where are you gonna sleep at?" "Eh, probably in your room Jake, hope you don't mind." He said. "Oh, I don't mind, it's completely fine, how about you Connor." Connor replied. "Probably on the cou-" He was cut off by a bang coming from upstairs. "What the fu- Did you guys hear that?" He said, raising my eyebrow. "Must be my dad's golf equipment that fell." I said, Connor turned to me and said. "Wait, I didn't know your dad plays golf." I replied. "Yea, he does, he's very good at it-" I was cut off by another bang coming from upstairs, Rob had enough. "You know what that's it, I'm going up there to see what the fuck is going on!" Rob then stomped upstairs, Connor hugged me and said in a worried voice. "What if it's an intruder?..." I said in a reassuring voice. "Intruders are rare in my town, I'm sure Rob will be fi-" I was cut off by the blood curdling scream of Rob and stuff being shuffled and thrown around.

&#x200B;

Connor started to tremble. "W-What's going on?!" He said in a scared voice. "I-I don't know but, whatever it is I'm gonna go check!" Before I could get off the couch, Connor held my arm. "No! Jake! Don't!" Connor said, I reassured him I'll be ok. "Dude, I'll be fine." I said, he then let go of my arm and I rushed upstairs, I looked at the open door of my dad's room, I rushed in there and saw... Oh god... And saw a blacked-out fur monster, killing my friend Rob, blood was all over the room, the monster didn't notice me, I quietly backed up, then without hesitation, ran back downstairs, grabbed Connor's hand, and ran out the door with Connor holding my hand. "What is going o-" I cut him off by saying. "ROB'S DEAD! HE GOT KILLED!" We continued to run for half an hour, he soon arrived in the middle of nowhere, I looked around me, there were only a few houses, and 1 hotel complex, and that's how me and Connor ended up here.

&#x200B;

Look, I don't know what the fuck happened over there, but maybe that bloodhound leaf, was a tracking device for that, THING of a creature I saw mauling my friend alive... But what kills me the most is... What will happen when it finds us?... No, I don't have the leaf on me, so it's impossible for that creature to find us.... Well, I have to go, Connor's cooking food, and I'm hungry, so, yea, that's my story...
