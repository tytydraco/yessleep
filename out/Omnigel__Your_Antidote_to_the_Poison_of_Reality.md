*“It’s weightless, carbohydrate-free, and keto-friendly. It’s non-toxic, locally sourced, and cruelty-minimized. It’s silky smooth. Rejuvenating. Invigorating. Handcrafted. All-natural. Exclusive. For the every-man. State-of-the-art. Older-than-time-itself.”*

The Executive abruptly paused his list of platitudes. I think he caught on to my sharp inhale and slightly pursed lips. I swallowed the yawn as politely as I could, keeping a smile plastered to my face in the meantime. Seemed like the damage had already been done, though. I heard his wing-tipped shoes tapping against the linoleum floor. His chiseled jawline clenched and his eyes narrowed.

Sure, my disinterest was maybe a bit rude. But in my defense, I ain’t the one investing in the product. Barely had the capital to *invest* in the six to eight Miller Lites that nursed me to sleep the night prior. No, I was the guinea pig. Guinea pigs don't need the sales pitch.

*“Uh…please, continue,”* I stammered.

His features loosened, but they didn’t unwind completely.

*“It’s…Omnigel -* ***your antidote to the poison of reality***.” he finished, each syllable throbbing with a borderline religious zeal.

I clapped until it became clear that he didn’t want me to clap, face grimacing in response, so I bit my lip and waited for instruction. The impeccably dressed Executive walked the length of the boardroom, his right hand trailing along the table’s polished mahogany, until he towered over me. I rose to meet him, but his palm met my collarbone and pushed me back into my seat.

*“Don’t get up,”* he said, now grinning from ear to ear. *“Let me ask you a question, Frederick: are you willing to do whatever it takes to* ***be*** *something? Are you ready to cast off the shackles of hopeless mediocrity - your plebeian birthright, vulgar in every sense of the word - and ascend to something greater? More importantly, do you believe I am merciful enough to grant that to you?”*

I didn’t quite understand what he was asking me, but I became uncomfortably aware of my body as he monologued. My stagnant, garlic-ridden breath. The cherry-red gingivitis crawling along my gumline. My ghoulish hunchback and my bulging pot belly. The sensation of my tired heart beating against my flimsy rib cage.

Eventually, I spat out a response, but I did not get up, and I did not meet his gaze.

*“Well…sir…I’m just here to get paid. And I apologize - I’m not used to the whole ‘dog and pony’ show. Usually, I just take the pills and report the side effects. But…I’m, I’m appreciative of…”*

He cut me off.

*“That’s exactly the answer I was looking for, Frederick. I’ll have my people swing around and pick you up. We’ll begin tonight. Your new lodging should be nearly ready,”* he remarked.

*“I’m not going home?”* I asked.

*“No, you’re not going home, Frederick,”* he replied.

*“What about my car?”*

The tapping of his wingtips started up again as he dialed his cellphone.

*“What car?”* he muttered.

The car I used to drive there, obviously: a beat-up sedan that was the lone blemish in a parking lot otherwise gleaming with BMWs and Lamborghinis. I was going to explain that I needed my car, but he was chatting with someone by the time I worked up the courage to speak again. It seemed important. I didn’t want to interrupt.

Could figure out how to get my car later, I supposed.

\- - - - -

The limousine was nice, undeniably. Don’t think I’d been in a limo since prom.

That said, I didn’t appreciate the secrecy.

No one informed me of our destination. Nobody mentioned it was a goddamned *hour* outside the city. After thirty minutes passed, I was knocking on the black-tinted partition, asking the driver if they had any updates or an ETA, but they didn’t respond.

I stepped out of the parked car, loose gravel crunching under my feet. The Executive had already arrived, and he was leaning against a separate, longer, more luxurious-appearing limousine. He sprang up and strolled towards me, arms outstretched as if he were going to pull me into a hug or something. Thankfully, he just wrapped one arm around my shoulder, his Rolodex ticking in my ear.

*“Frederick! Happy to see you made it.”*

*“Uh…well, thanks, Sir, but where are we?”*

I scanned my surroundings. There was a warehouse - this monstrous bastion of rusted steel and disintegrating concrete that seemed to pierce the skyline - and little else. No trees. No telephone poles. No billboards. Just flat, dirt-coated earth in nearly every direction. I couldn’t even tell where the unpaved gravel connected to a proper road. It just sort of evaporated into the horizon.

The Executive began sauntering towards the warehouse, tugging me along. He winked and said:

*“Well, my boy, you’re home, of course.”*

*“What do you mean? And what does this have to do with ovigel - “*

*“****Omni****gel.”* He quickly corrected. The word plummeted from his tongue like a guillotine, razor sharp and heavy with judgement.

I shut my mouth and focused on marching in lockstep with the Executive. A few silent seconds later, we were in front of a door. I didn’t even notice there *was* a door until he was reaching for the knob. The entrance was tiny and without signage, barely a toenail on the foot of the colossus, blending seamlessly into the corrugated metal wall.

He twisted the knob and pushed forward, moving aside and gesturing for me to enter first. The creaking of its ungreased hinges emanated into the warehouse. The inside was dark, but not lightless. Strangely, tufts of fake grass drifted over the bottom of the frame, shiny plastic blades wavering in a gentle breeze that I couldn’t feel from the outside.

*“Let me know if anything looks...familiar,”* he whispered.

Fearful of upsetting him again, I wandered into the belly of the beast, but I was wholly ill-prepared for what awaited me. I crossed the threshold. Before long, I couldn’t move. Bewilderment stitched my feet to the ground. When he claimed I was *home*, he hadn’t lied. No figure of speech, no metaphor.

It looked like I was standing on my neighbor’s lawn.

I crept along the astroturf until I was standing in the middle of a road. My head swung like a pendulum, peering from one side of the street to the other. I felt woozy and stumbled back. Fortunately, the wall of the warehouse was there to catch me.

Everything had been painstakingly recreated.

The Halloween decorations the Petersons refused to haul into their garage, skeletons erupting from the earth aside their rose garden. The placement of the sewer grates. The crater-sized pothole that I’d forget to avoid coming home from the liquor store time and time again.

My house. My family’s house. The time-bitten three-story colonial I grew up in - it was there too.

*“Why…how did you -”*

The feeling of the Executive once again curling his muscular biceps around my shoulder shut me up.

*“Pretty neat, huh? You see, we need to know how people will use Omnigel in the wild, and when we heard tale of your legendary compliance through the grapevine, we felt confident that you’d agree to participate in this…unorthodox study.”*

He reeled me into his chest, slow and steady like a fishing line, and once I was snugly fixed to his side, he started dragging me towards my ersatz home.

*“From there, it was simple - City Hall lent us some blueprints, we found a suitable location, called in a few favors from Hollywood set designers, a few more favors from some local architects…but I’m sure you’re not interested in the nitty-gritty. You said it yourself - you’re here to get paid!”*

My shaky feet stepped from the road to the sidewalk. Even though it was the afternoon, it was the middle of the night in the warehouse. The streetlights were on. There were no stars in the sky. Or rather, there none attached to the ceiling. How far back did the road go? How many houses had they built? I couldn't tell. 

Every single detail was *close* to perfect - 0.001% off from a truly identical facsimile. It doesn't sound like a lot, but that iota of dissonance might as well have been a hot needle in my eye. The tiny grain of friction between my memories and what they had created was unbearable.

The floorboards of my patio winced under pressure, like they were supposed to, but the sound wasn’t *quite* right.

*“Frederick, we wanted you to experience the bliss of Omnigel in the comfort of your home, but, at the end of the day, we’re a pharmaceutical company: Science, Statistics, Objectivity…they’re a coven of cruel, unyielding mistresses, but we’re beholden to their demands none-the-less, and they demand we have control.”*

The air that wafted out of the foyer when we walked inside correctly smelled of mold, but it was slightly too clean.

*“Thus, we built you this very generous compromise. Your home away from home.”*

The family photographs hung too low. The ceramic of the bowl that I’d throw my keys into after a shift at the bar was the wrong shade of brown. The floor mat was too weathered. Or maybe it wasn’t weathered enough?

*“The only difference - the only meaningful difference, anyway - is the Omnigel we left for you on the dining room table. I won’t bother giving you a tour. Feels redundant, don’t you think? Now, my instructions for you are very straightforward: live your life as you normally would. Use the Omnigel as you see fit. We’re paying you by the hour. Stay as long as you’d like. When you’re done, just walk outside, and a driver will take you home.”*

I spied an unlabeled mason jar half-filled with grayish oil at the center of my dining room table. I turned around. The Executive loomed in the doorway. Don’t know when he let go of my shoulder. He chuckled and lit a cigarette.

*“What a peculiar thing to say - ‘when you’re done here, in your home, walk outside and we’ll take you home’.”*

Goosebumps budded down my torso. I felt my heartbeat behind my eyes.

*“How…how much will you be paying me an hour?”*

He responded with a figure that doesn’t bear repeating here, but know that the dollar amount was truly obscene.

*“And…and…the Omnigel…what do I do with it? Is it…is it a skin cream? Or a condiment? Some sort of mechanical lubricant? Or...”*

The Executive took a long, blissful drag. He exhaled. As a puff of smoke billowed from his lips, he let the still-lit cigarette fall into the palm, and then he crushed the roiling ember in his hand.

He grinned and gave me an answer.

*“Yes.”*

His cellphone began ringing. The executive spun away from me and picked up the call, strutting across the patio.

*“Yup. Correct. Turn it all on.”*

The warehouse, my neighborhood, whirred to life with the quiet melody of suburbia. A dog barking. The wet clicking of a sprinkler. Children laughing. A car grumbling over the asphalt.

Not sure how long I stood there, just listening. Eventually, I tiptoed forward. My eyes peeked over the doorframe. The street was empty and motionless: no kids, or canines, or cars, and I couldn’t see the Executive.

I was home alone in the warehouse, somewhere outside the city.

It took awhile, but I managed to tear myself away from the door frame. I shuffled into the living room, plopped down in my recliner, and clicked on the TV.

Might as well make some money, right?

\- - - - -

Honestly, I adjusted quickly.

Sure, the perpetual night was strange. It made maintaining a circadian rhythm challenging. I had to avoid looking outside, too. Hearing the white noise while seeing the street vacant fractured the immersion twenty ways to Sunday.

If reality ever slipped in, if I ever became unnerved, the dollar amount I was being paid per hour would flash in my head, and I’d settle.

Grabbing a beer from the fridge, a self-satisfied smile grew across my face.

*What a dumb plan*, I thought.

*I didn’t even* ***have*** *to try the product. The Executive told me to “use Omnigel as I saw fit”. Welp, I don’t “see fit” to use it at all. I’ll just hang here until I’ve accumulated enough money to retire. No risk, all reward.*

As I was returning to my recliner, I caught a glimpse of the mason jar. I slowed to a stop.

*But I mean, what if I leave without trying it and the Executive ends up being aggravated with me? They must have spent a fortune to set this all up. I could just try it once, and that’d be that.*

I unscrewed the container’s lid and popped it open, expecting to smell a puff of noxious air given the cadaverous gray-black coloration of its contents. To my surprise, there were no fumes. I put my nose to the rim and sniffed - no smell at all, actually. Cautiously, I smeared a dab the size of a Hershey’s Kiss onto my pinky. It looked like something you’d dredge up from the depths of a fast-food grease-trap, but it didn’t *feel* like that. It wasn’t slick or slimy. Despite being a liquid, it didn’t feel moist. No, it was nearly weightless and dry as a bone to the touch, similar to cotton candy.

*Guess I’ll rub a little on the back of my hand and call it a day.*

Right before the substance touched my skin, a burst of high-pitched static exploded from somewhere within the house. I jumped and lost my footing on the way down, my ass hitting the floor with a painful *thud*. My heart pounded against the back of my throat. After a handful of crackles and feedback whines, a deep voice uttered a single word:

*“No.”*

One more prolonged mechanical shriek, a click, and that was it. Ambient noise dripped back into my ears.

I spun my head, searching for a speaker system. Nothing in the dining room. I pulled my aching body upright and began pacing the perimeter of my first floor. Nothing. I stomped up the stairs. No signs of it in my bedroom or the upstairs bathroom. I yanked the drawstring to bring down the attic steps and proceeded with my search. Nothing there either, but it was alarmingly empty - none of my old furniture was where it should have been.

Over the course of a few moments, confusion devolved into raw, unbridled disorientation.

*My* first floor? *My* bedroom? *My* furniture? What the fuck was I thinking?

I wasn’t at home.

I was in a house, on a street, within a warehouse, in the middle of nowhere.

\- - - - -

Sleep didn’t come easily. The dreams that followed weren’t exactly restful, either.

In the first one, I was sitting on a bench in an oddly shaped room, with pink-tinted walls that seemed to curve towards me. I kept peering down at my watch. I was waiting for something to happen, or maybe I just couldn’t leave. My stomach began gurgling. Sickness churned in my abdomen. It got worse, and worse, and worse, and then it happened - I was unzipped from the inside. The flesh above my abdomen neatly parted like waves of the biblical Red Sea, and a gore-stained Moses stuck his hands out, gripping the ends of my skin and wrenching me open, sternum to navel.

It wasn’t painful, nor did I experience fear. I observed the man burrow out of my innards and splatter at my feet with a passing curiosity: a TV show that I let hover on-screen only because there wasn’t something more interesting playing on the other channels.

He was a strange creature, undeniably. Only two feet tall, naked as the day he was born, caked in viscera and convulsing on the salmon-colored floor with a pathetic intensity. Eventually, he ceased his squirming. He took a moment to catch his breath, sat up, and brushed the hair from his face.

I was surprised to discover that he looked like me. Smaller, sure, but the resemblance was indisputable. He smiled at me, but he had no teeth to bare. Unadorned pink gums to match the pink walls. I smiled back to be polite. Then, he pointed up, calling attention to our shared container. 

*Were the walls a mucosa?*, I wondered.

*In other words, were we both confined within a different person's stomach?*

He clapped and summoned a blood-soaked cheer from his nascent vocal cords, as if responding to things I didn't say out loud. I looked back at him and scowled. The correction I offered was absurd, but it seemed to make sense at the time.

*“No, you idiot, we’re not in a stomach. Where’s the acid? And the walls are much too polished to be living,”* I claimed.

He tilted his head and furrowed his brow.

*“Look again. The answer is simple. We’re in a mason jar that someone’s holding. The pink color is obviously their palm being pressed into the glass.”*

This seemed to anger him. 

His eyes bulged and he dove for my throat, snarling like a starving coyote.

Then, I woke up in a bedroom.

\- - - - -

Days passed uneventfully. 

I drank beer. I watched TV. I imagined the ludicrous amount of money accumulating in my bank account. I slept. My dreams became progressively less surreal. Most of the time, I just dreamt that I was home, drinking beer and watching TV. 

One evening, maybe about a week in, I dreamt of consuming the Omnigel, something I’d been choosing to ignore. In the dream, I drove a teaspoon into the jar and put a scoop close to my lips. When I wasn’t chastised by some electric voice rumbling from the walls, I placed the oil into my mouth. I wanted to see what it tasted like, and, my God, the feeling that followed its consumption was euphoric.

Even though it was just a dream, I didn’t need much more convincing.

I woke up, sprang out of bed, marched into the dining room, picked up the jar, untwisted the lid, dug my fingers into the oil, and put them knuckle-deep into my mouth.

Why bother with a teaspoon? No one was watching. 

I mean, I don’t know if that’s true. Someone was *probably* watching. What I’m saying is manners felt like overkill, and I was hungry for something other than alcohol. Just like in my dream, I wasn’t scolded, but I wasn’t filled with euphoria in the wake of consuming the Omnigel, either. It didn’t taste bad. It didn’t taste good. The oil didn’t really have any flavor to speak of, and I could barely sense it on my tongue. It slid down my throat like a gulp of hot air.

*Disappointing,* I thought, *No harm no foul, though.* 

I procured a liquid breakfast from the fridge, plodded over to the recliner, and clicked on the TV. The day chugged along without incident, same as the day before it, and I was remarkably content given the circumstances.

Late that afternoon, a person's reflection paced across the screen. It was quick and the reflection was hazy, but it looked to be a woman in a crimson sundress with a silky black ponytail. Then, I heard a feminine voice - 

*“Honey, do you mind cooking tonight? Bailey’s got soccer, so we won’t be back ‘till seven,”* she cooed.

*“Yeah, of course Linda, no sweat,”* I replied.

I felt the cold beer drip icy tears over my fingertips. A spastic muscle in my low back groaned, and I shifted my position to accommodate it. A smile very nearly crossed my lips.

Then, all at once, my eyes widened. My head shot up like the puck on a carnival game after the lever had been hit with a mallet. I swung around and toppled out of the recliner. Both the chair and I crashed onto the floor. 

*“Fuck…*” I muttered, various twinges of pain firing through my body.

*“Who’s there?”* I screamed.

***“Who the fuck is there?”*** I bellowed.

My fury echoed through the house, but it received no response.

*Why would the company do that? Was she some actress? How’d they find someone who looks exactly like Linda?*

I perked my ears and waited. Nothing. Dead, oppressive silence. I couldn’t even hear the artificial ambient noise that’d been playing nonstop since my arrival.

*When did it stop? Why didn’t I notice?*

The sound of small galloping against wood erupted from the ceiling above me. Child-like laughter reverberated through the halls.

*“Alright, that’s it…”* I growled, climbing to my feet.

I rushed through the home. Slammed doors into plaster. Flipped over mattresses. Checked each and every room for intruders, rage coursing through my veins, but they were all empty. 

Eventually, I found myself in front of a drawstring, about to pull down the stairs to the attic. My hand crept into view, but it stopped before reaching the tassel. I brought it closer to my face. Beads of sweat spilled over my temples. 

I didn’t understand.

My fingers were covered in Omnigel. 

I started trembling. My whole body shook from the violent bouts of panic. My other hand went limp, and the noise of shattering glass pulled a scream from my throat. My neck creaked down until I was chin to chest.

A fractured mason jar lay at my feet, shards of glass stained with ivory-colored grease.

*I have to check.*

My quaking fingertips clasped the string. The stairs descended into place.

*I have to check.*

Each step forward was its own heart-attack. I could practically hear clotted arteries clicking against each other in my chest like a handful of seashells, but I couldn’t seem to stop myself.

*I just…I just have to check.*

My eyes crept over the threshold. I held my breath.

Empty.

No furniture, no intruders, no nothing. Beautifully vacant.

I began to release a massive sigh. Before I could completely exhale, however, I realized something.

Slowly, I spun in place. 

The attic stairs weren’t built directly into the wall. There was a *little* space behind me - a small perch, no more than six inches wide.

My eyes landed on two pallid, bare feet. 

The skin was decorated with random patches of dark, circular discoloration. Craters on the surface of the moon.

But there weren’t just two. 

I noticed a line of moon-skinned feet in my peripheral vision. There even a few pairs *behind* the ones closest to me, too. 

They were all packed like sardines into this tiny, tiny space.

Maybe I looked up. Maybe I didn’t.

Part of me thinks I couldn't bear to. 

The other part of me thinks I've forced myself to forget. 

It doesn’t matter.

I screamed. Leapt down the stairs. Cracked my kneecaps on the floor. The injury didn’t hold me back. Not one bit.

I took nothing with me as I left. I raced across that faux-street, irrationally nervous that I wouldn’t find the door and the asphalt would just keep going on forever.

But I did find the door. 

It was exactly where I left it. 

I yanked it open and threw my body out of the warehouse.

Waning sunlight and a chorus of male laughter greeted me as I landed, curled up on the gravel and hyperventilating.

*“Don’t have a conniption now, old sport,”* a familiar voice said amidst the cackling.

I twisted my head to face them.

There were three men, each with a cigarette dangling between their lips. Two were dressed like chauffeurs. The third’s attire was impeccable and luxurious.

*“What…what day is it?”* I stuttered.

The heavier of the two chauffeurs doubled over laughing. The Executive walked closer and offered me a hand up.

*“Well, Frederick, the day is today!”* he exclaimed. *“For your wallet’s sake, I’d hoped you would last a little longer, but two and a half hours is still a respectable payday.”*

*“No…that’s not right…”* I whispered.

The Executive’s cellphone began ringing before I was entirely upright. He let go of my hand and I nearly fell back down. As I steadied myself, the smaller chauffeur reached into his pocket, retrieved my phone, clicked the side to activate the screenlight, and pointed to the date.

He *was* right.

I’d only been in the warehouse for one hundred and fifty minutes, give or take.

I looked to the Executive, my godhead in a well-pressed Italian suit, for an explanation. Something to soothe my agonizing bewilderment.

He turned away from me and started talking shop with whoever was on the other line.

Already, I’d been forgotten.

*“Did you get everything? All the Vertigraphs? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, wow. You’re sure? Thirty-seven? That’s exceptionally high yield. Yes. Agreed. He’s one hungry boy, apparently.”*

He looked over his shoulder, flashed me a grin, and winked.

Slowly, painfully, I felt my lips oblige.

I smiled back at him.

\- - - - -

Linda was thrilled to see the wad of cash I brought home. According to the orthodontist, Bailey will need braces sooner rather than later.

I haven’t told her about what I experienced. No, I simply told her they awarded me a bonus for my work ethic at the bar.

It's been a few days since the warehouse. Overall, my life hasn’t changed much.

With one exception.

I startled my wife the first time I entered the house through the backdoor, but I don't plan on entering through the front for a long while. 

*“Sorry about that, honey. I really fucked up my knees the other day, hurts to climb the patio steps.”*

Which, technically-speaking, isn’t a lie, but it’s not the real reason I avoid the patio.

I avoid the patio because I'm afraid of what I might discover. 

What if I step over the floorboards, and they wince like they’re supposed to, but it isn’t *exactly* right?

I wouldn't be able to cope with the ambiguity.

I don't think I'm still in the warehouse. 

But I think it’s just safer not to know [for sure. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
