Post 1: [People can't recognize me, anyone help please](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zp9zi8/people_cant_recognize_me_anyone_help_please/)

This is an update to a previous post I madea couple days ago, one that you may not remember, so if you do then good. If you do remember, then you remember me and my friend's plan to for her to remember me, and it didn't work. So now I have no one to help me, but you guys. Which helps since, I found out what may have caused this, thanks to a one of you guys. The creature is known as The Wild Hunt. From what I know they can take on many forms, riding horses, being bipedal, and more. This is what may be haunting me and messing with me. So I am going to share a story, one that may be the time I first encountered them, and I am going to need your guys' help for me to get my life back. For some background information these Wild Hunt entities are from european folklore, so I must have encountered one when we were visiting an old european town for a week, analyzing the church that was there, for a project for my college. But, I never said anything about this before was because I newly remembered what happened, which is likely due to the entity trying to erase any knowledge of its existence. Now since you have some more information about the story, it can begin.

The story begins an hour before we visited the church, I was walking around the small town, learning more about its history since that is what our project was on. As I was walking around, talking to the towns folk, I came around an old man. I was talking to him, but then I remembered I had 20 minutes left to get to the church, so I blurted out on accident, "Damn it! I need to get to the church!"

The old man stopped me saying, "DON'T GO THERE! It is dangerous"

I stopped saying, "How so," he replied, "Most vistors and tourists that go in that cursed place end up disappearing anywhere between 9 months to a year later."

I chuckled, "Is that what your towns people say to scare others?"

He said, "It isn't a joke, others forget, but I don't, and that's beca-"

I interupted, "Sorry, but I gotta, I am done with jokes today."

I probably should've listened, but I didn't since I didn't know what was coming. But after that, I don't remember much, next thing I remember is making it to the church on time. After that, I entered the chruch to see no one was there, not even a preist or nun. That's when I checked my email to see that the time was changed from 1:30 PM, to 5:00 PM. But since I didn't want to be there for nothing I decided to explore the big church. Until I saw something weird, which was a crucifix. Normally a crucifix in a church is normal, especially an old one, but the way it looked was odd. So I went over to pick it up and see if there was anyone makers date. Which is when I saw something that I was told was a sign of a Wild Hunt, which I didn't know at the time, but what I saw was the date, and it wasn't anything like 1475, or 500 bc, no it said 3170. After seeing the year I heard a noise, which made me drop the crucifix, after looking around to see it was nothing. After that I went to pick up the crucifix to see it was gone, and back on the wall it was on, so I picked it up again to check the year, and what I saw made me think I was delusional, it no longer said 3170, but 1531. So thinking nothing of it I put it back on the wall and decided to go back to where I was staying. Then after that my memory gets foggy again, so I'm going to skip to my next big memory that help with my story.

My next memory takes place in what I'm going to call day 2, so the last memory will be day 1. Now to countinue, it was day 2, nothing much happened, since my horrors began at night, all I remember is waking up that in the hotel room I was in, getting out of bed to get a glass of water. But something felt off, it was as if someone was watching but no one was there, well no one was in the room that is. Since moments after I was feeling off put I went to the window near the nightstand and opened the curtains to look outside. After looking outside I saw nothing, it was a black night sky, with clouds covering the stars. So I thought there was nothing to worried about, and as I was about to just close the curtains, a flash of light came down making a loud thunderous sound. It made me jump from being so sudden, so thats when I looked outside again to see it raining, with lightning striking what seemed to be every couple of seconds. Then it looked like a figure came down from the sky, it was like a shadow riding a horse. After that nothing, my memory cuts off to the next day, or night I guess since that is where all the bad stuff happens.

Day 3 of my memory from the trip starts in well, the day, where I am exploring the town with somewhat of a shaken up feeling, likely from the previous night. As I am walking I encounter the old man again, who was calling out to me, but I ignored since I was meeting up with my friends, aka Tony and them. I remember telling them what I saw, what happened, but they laughed so I played it of as a joke, saying that it was just a story I was making up campfire tales. Then after my memory cuts again to the night of the same day. I wake up in the middle of the night again, got a glass of water, then before I was about to lay down, I got that feeling again, as if something was there, but this time, if felt like more than one thing, or entity. So I rushed to the window for then again, a lightning storm to begin, but this time it wasn't just one figure to follow the storm, but 3 shadow like figures, but this time I remember them approaching the window, then lightning stuck, and my memory blanks.

I don't remember anything for the 4th or 5th days and nights there. As if these wild hunts are hiding something. But I do remeber part of night 6. It starts with me already having a glass of water, going to the window to open the curtains, then for a lightning strike to occur. Following figures, but no longer 3 but 7 figures, as if 2 joined everynight. But this time when they came up to the window, it was as if they were talking, but I couldn't understand a thing, it was as if they were speaking some alien language, along with them changing who was speaking, finishing each others sentences or words, then a flash of lighting struck, and they were gone.

Then day 7 came around, all I rememeber for the day is walking around looking for the old man, seeing if he knows what happened. Then I remember finding him, telling what I was experiencing, and him saying something like I was foolish, and should've listened, so he gave me a note, one that he had ready thinking I might come to him.

I remember him saying, "Keep this somewhere safe, somehwere to where you can find it again."

I replied with a simple ok after that, then came night again, but this time, I remember the entire night. What I remembered was waking up for a glass of water, then after I went and got one, I remember siting down on the bed, prepared for what is to come. Then the storm began, so I rushed to the curtains, opening them to see 5 of the figures come down this time. But this time they weren't there to chat, in a flash of lightning they disappeared, then in another they were back right against the window. As a reaction a jumped backwards in shock and fear. The curtain went back down from me jumping, but when I went back to see if it was still there it was gone. So I crawled in bed, with my heart pounding, trying to forget about it and sleep, but the lightning and thunder countinued. It countinued, getting faster and faster, as if I was on a ship at sea. But after a while it was just thunder, the windows started rattling, as if they were trying to get in, until I couldn't take and decide look outside.

By looking outside, I ended up face to face with the creature, having what looked like to be armor on them, and their face is hard to see, just a faint outline of what they had on, with their eyes just being pure black voids. Just by looking into their eyes I was getting the chills, it was almost as if I was fading, and as if I couldn't look away. But I was able to, after looking away and closing the curtains, I jumped in bed. After I was in the bed I hid under my blankets just trying to sleep, and forget about what happened, but they countinued to shake the windows, it even started to sound like they were banging on them. But somehow I managed to fall asleep, waking up the next day to my alarm, and to clear and sunny skies. So I got dressed, ate breakfast, and brushed my teeth, going on the plane back a few hours later at 5:00 PM, that would take at least half a day, but what I was scared for was the ride, but the night. So it eventualy came to night, but nothing happened, I was able to just sleep normally from that day on.

Forgeting about what happened entirely as if it was erased from my memory, until recently. Then I also remember the paper note, and having it in the pants I wore on the day we took the plane back. So searched for it everywhere, until I came accross it in my dresser drawer, and the old man wrote in some weird wording, but since it might have a solution to my problem, here is what it has on there.

To rid of them, you need to exploit its weakness, which is to stab it in its source, keep this hidden or saved somewhere so they can't take it.

At first I couldn't solve it, but now I did after some extensive searching, but be careful because now. Because since I have said something about them to you guys, I put a target on you guys. So I need you help to find out how to stop them soon, since what I have to do is stab it in the middle of it's chest, but I can't because of the armor they have. So, I need your help on ways to remove the armor. Also sorry for putting you guys in danger, but if I can stop them, no one will come after any of us, since only the ones that have been seen attack people.
