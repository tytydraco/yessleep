The world around me never stopped moving, no matter how much I wished it would. People rushing to work, cars screaming down highways, the constant noise of living. I hated it. Keeping up with that pace felt like treading water in a storm, every day a little harder than the last. If I didn’t stop to breathe, I’d drown.

Luckily, the D.N.A. wasn’t the kind of organization that demanded constant loyalty. They only cared about results. I could turn down hunts when I needed to. As long as I got the job done, they didn’t ask questions, which was fine by me.

The sound of popcorn popping filled the silence of my cabin, a rhythm that almost matched the gunfire from the old action flick flickering across my CRT television. I was sprawled on the couch in nothing but boxers, half-watching the movie, half-listening to the hum of the microwave. The moonlight poured through the windows, painting the walls in cold silver. Out here in the woods, the night was calm, untouched. The kind of stillness city people would pay money for.

The microwave dinged. I got up, grabbed the bag, and set it down on the counter next to a bottle of Everclear. The burn hit hard on the first sip, softer on the second. I didn’t drink often, not because I couldn’t handle it, but because it made me think too much. On nights like this, though, I liked to let the silence swallow me. To drink until the noise in my head quieted down, until the weight on my chest felt a little lighter.

The TV kept playing as I leaned against the counter, the sound of explosions echoing through the cabin. For a second, I imagined the world outside wasn’t real, that the monsters, the hunts, the D.N.A., all of it was just part of the movie. I almost laughed at the thought.

When the credits rolled, I tossed the empty popcorn bag into the trash and took one last swig from the bottle. The alcohol hit me like a wave. The edges of the world blurred, my muscles went heavy, and I stumbled my way toward the bedroom.

The floor creaked beneath my feet. Outside, the wind brushed through the trees, soft and distant. I left the window open; I liked hearing the forest breathe. The sheets were cold, the pillow smelled faintly of gun oil and dust, and I sank into them like a corpse into earth.

Sleep never came easy for me. Too many nights spent on hunts, too many memories I didn’t care to revisit. But the Everclear helped dull the edges. My mind drifted, heavy and slow.

\*\*\*

The night was dying as I pulled myself from the depths of my drunken slumber. A splitting headache tore through my skull, and I gripped my hair in pain. I had some aspirin in the cabinet downstairs. Before I left, I walked to my open window. The cold air brushed against my skin. I took a deep breath, allowing the oxygen from outside to flow into my lungs. The horizon was a deep purple, a sign of the day beginning to break. This was my favorite time of the day. The sounds of animals outside woke up as the world began its daily schedule.

My heart rate accelerated as I realized the world outside wasn’t waking up. No noises came from the trees, no birds chirping, no animals roaming. The woods were deadly silent. Something was out there. Something big. My eyes adjusted and I noticed… footprints. Long, deep footprints in the dirt around my house. In front of each was a handprint with fingers that were nearly a foot long.

I ducked under the window. Something had found me, and given the look of what was outside, all I could do was pray it wasn’t what I thought it was. There weren't supposed to be any cryptids nearby. I’d made sure of it myself. I jumped up and moved for the door to my bedroom, heading into the hall and toward the stairs. I kept my footsteps as quiet as possible. I turned to the stairs and froze. My front door, which sat near the start of the stairs, was wide open. The night air flowed into the cabin.

I swallowed. In the arch to my living room, I could see a leg. It was long, and a deep, earthy gray, and with a digitigrade joint halfway down. Sharp toes emanated from the toes, digging into my carpet. A small tail sprouted from the humanoid torso, which had skin tightly grasped around the ribs of its body. I slowly backed away from the stairs, doing everything in my power to keep my weight off creaky floorboards. The worst possible outcome had been realized:

A Wendigo was in my house.

Wendigos are tall, lanky humanoid things, built like a stretched-out sasquatch. Taller, thinner, and meaner. Some grow patches of fur, but most of their bodies are bare, showing skin that ranges from dark green to light brown to gray. Their heads are vaguely human, but their jaws are unhinged nightmares, able to open six times wider than ours.

They hunt for sport, not survival, and they collect trophies from what they kill. Most of them wear the skull of their first victim like a mask. Their nasty, noseless faces get covered by the bone, and it fuses to their heads to become an exoskeleton. Needless to say, they’re apex predators. No doubt the Wendigo in my house had picked up my scent, one that would intrigue it beyond hunger.

I could hear the creaks of the kitchen floorboards as it silently searched my house. There was no way for me to get to the basement; it was behind the pantry that was currently being raided. As the beast below cleared the living room, I slid back into my bedroom. Soon enough, it would be up here. I noticed the radio on my bedside and grabbed it. I set it to a station and cranked the volume before switching it on and throwing it back into my bedroom. I ran down the hall as fast as I could, hiding in the bathroom.

The monster had heard the commotion, and I heard it crawl up the stairs on all fours. It was moving faster than before now that it had a target confirmed, but was still silent and cautious. As it passed the bathroom, I held my breath. I could see the shadows on the walls, claws the length of rulers stepping silently.

The Wendigo leapt into my room, tearing the radio to shreds. The guttural noises that came from its throat sent shivers down my spine. I refused to take Wendigo hunts; I had a terrible history with them. I sprinted out of the bathroom and down the stairs. Aware that it had been duped, the Wendigo leapt out of the room, crashing into the wall and sending splinters everywhere. I made it to the kitchen and ran for the basement door. It was reinforced and would grant me at least a few extra seconds.

I peeked over my shoulder, catching a glimpse of the Wendigo as it pursued me down the stairs. It was wearing the skull of a moose, and the large, flared antlers were knocking photos and vases off shelves as it landed on the floor. It jumped at me, missing by an inch and crushing my oven. I dove down the basement stairs, slamming the door and throwing the bolt an instant before the razor fingers landed on my face.

The door bent under the weight of the Wendigo. It screamed in rage, a noise that was eerily human. I had no time to waste. I grabbed my shotgun and searched for the correct ammo needed. I hadn’t ordered any; I never expected to have to face another Wendigo. My ill preparation didn’t fully screw me, as I found a single slug round.

Wendigo’s had incredible regeneration. It was like their metabolism was cranked up to eleven. However, one material, one single element, would immediately cause full body necrosis if it came in contact with their heart.

Silver.

I loaded the silver slug into my sawed-off. The pounding on the door had stopped, and I could see large cuts in the door that led to the other side. Silence had returned to my house again, and the lack of noise made me feel uneasy. I quietly crept to the door, peering through one of the cracks. There was a crash that made me jump back as the oven that usually resides in my kitchen was thrown at the door. I pointed the barrel at the wood, expecting at any moment for the Wendigo to continue its assault, but nothing came.

Another scratching noise caught my attention. There was no movement from behind the door, and I realized this side of the room wasn’t even close to where the sound originated. It was coming from directly above me.

Shards of wood covered the basement as the Wendigo punched a hole through the roof. It was in the living room, tearing planks from the floor to reach me. I saw sharp claws scratch through oak, and its spindly arms emerged to reach for me. I ran for the door, trying to push it open, but it didn’t budge. Genius. It threw the oven to keep me locked down here.

By now, its entire upper body had pushed through the hole above, and I could see the dark pits it had for eyes staring at me as it screeched. The noise wasn’t necessary, but it knew that a slight fear was sent through me when it did, and it was using that to its advantage. I aimed for its chest, but the writhing of its torso didn’t grant me a perfect shot. I didn’t have any second chances.

I tried to make a decision, but a strange feeling of panic had started to set in, one I had never felt when I was prepared. The Wendigo burst through, landing on its feet and rising slowly. Its attempt at intimidation worked, but it had also given me a half-second to aim. I pulled the trigger, and the deafening blast from the shotgun lit the room up. The Wendigo howled in agony as the slug tore through its shoulder. A deep crimson blood sprayed on the wall behind it. I could see the innards of its body, the chrome muscle fibers, and the deep black bone. The body began regenerating, hiding its biology from my sight.

My hands had been shaking. The fear in my body had ruined my aim, and the slug had missed by inches. It was over for me. The beast was upon me with a vengeance. Its claws tore through me like a shredder. As thin as these things were, their muscles were twelve times as dense as a human's.

I caught one of its hands as it went for my throat, pushing it back with all the power I could muster. Its other claw dug into my side. Its jaw unhinged, and I felt it chomp down on my neck. My hand had managed to sneak under its bite, and I pushed up to prevent it from taking a fatal amount of flesh from me.

I let the claw I was holding stab my ribs, tearing through things I didn’t want to imagine. I grabbed the antler on its head and yanked, pulling part of the skull from its head. It roared in pain and stumbled back. I could see bubbling flesh where half the skull had fallen from.

I was hurt, bad. Not even the Daywalker had torn me up this much. I looked down at my body. The cuts were deep, obviously, and I could see things under my skin I never would otherwise. Blood leaked from my side, and I noticed part of my silverish muscles peeking out. The Wendigo noticed my anatomy and stopped, staring at me with a look I assumed was confusion.

It gave me enough time to reach for the workbench behind me and grab a silver knife. I threw it at the dazed creature, and it landed in its chest. It screamed in pain, but jumped at me instead of dying. The blade of the knife was too short. Its claws were around my face. It stared me in the eyes, its gaze a deep and dark hatred. Wendigo’s never killed their own kind; they worked together, so it was no doubt confused as to why I was doing everything in my power to end it.

It seemed to give up on figuring me out and dug its claws into my head. I could feel my heart pulsing behind my eyes, and I spit into its face. The stun of saliva allowed me to pull my arm back without it seeing. Pushing every ounce of energy I had into my inhumane body, I punched the knife that still sat lodged in its chest. The handle pushed through its skin, and the Wendigo stopped. It didn’t scream, just gargled up a mucus as it stumbled back. It fell back-first onto my gunrack, sliding down with a squelching. It finally hit the floor and flopped over, unmoving. The pinpricks of light behind its eyes had vanished, leaving only craters of darkness.

I limped to the locker by the desk and opened it, pulling a D.N.A distress beacon from the shelving. My vision was sparkling, bits of black running in and out of my eyesight. I pressed the button on the beacon and dropped. My body hit the blood-soaked wood, and the light left my eyes. I passed out. The last thing I was able to hear was footsteps and garbled speech from agents entering the basement.
