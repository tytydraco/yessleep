I never counted how many steps were on my staircase. But every time I walked those steps in the dark, I knew exactly when I reached the top. I never thought of how I might react if one day I found an extra step when I thought I cleared them all. I would've probably brushed it off. Counted it as an error. But if I were two off? Three? I wasn't sure how many steps I was past the top when I realized something was wrong.

  
My grandmother was a first-generation Chinese immigrant to the United States. Grandma always said I looked like my mom when she was my age, no matter what age I was. I always looked like Mom apparently. Grandma died last year. She did well enough for herself, but my mom did even better, especially as a single parent raising my brother and me. She bought this house, a one-story space with a basement, perfect for the four of us. Grandma always watched us while my mom was at work. Grandma almost exclusively spoke Chinese. I was a bit of a brat; once I realized that everyone at school only spoke English, I had little interest in keeping up my Mandarin. As a result, Grandma and I didn't always talk much. But I still remember her stories. Stories like Ye Xian and The Magic Lotus Lantern, or Sun Wukong and The Journey to the West; that one was particularly close to Grandma. I wondered if she ever wanted to return to China like the Monkey King.

  
It was nice to be able to put Mandarin on a resume. Although, it seemed antithetical considering my degree was in English Literature. I was the first in my family to graduate college at the ripe old age of 22. Upon graduating, I wanted nothing more than a break, so I moved back in with my mom and my brother. But my break was going on longer than I intended. There was less to do with an English degree than I anticipated. I was sending my resume and credentials left and right. I guess nobody wanted a little Asian Shakespearean even frying their chicken.

  
One night, I considered putting Smith as my last name on my resume, just as a little experiment. I was in the basement, watching a movie while emailing job applications on my laptop. I sent out my last round of credentials and checked the time: 1:02 a.m. I closed my laptop, tossing it gently on the couch cushion next to me. I reached to grab my phone off the charger. Turning its face to me, I found it was dead. I had forgotten the charger downstairs was broken. "Whatever," I whispered to myself. "I'll just charge it in my room." I turned off the TV.  
It was pitch black. Of course, I had navigated this basement thousands of times. Like clockwork, I made my way around the couch, down the short hall, up the four stairs to the landing, then turned left to go up the rest of the stairs from there.  
It was claustrophobic on the stairs. A wall to the left and right, and a short ceiling above. The distance between the walls was only two-thirds of my wingspan. There was one wooden handrail on the right wall. I placed my right hand along the smooth wood and my left hand in my pocket with my phone. My phone began bouncing with each step.

  
As my hand glided against the rail, I angled it just the right way so that it would slide smoothly off the end of the railing. But to my surprise, the railing didn't end. This gave me pause. I stopped and looked over at the rail. It was too dark to see anything. Standing in place, I kept sliding my hand up, but the end wasn't within my reach. I was sober. I wasn't on anything---I hadn't even ingested anything since dinner. So, I figured I was just more tired than I realized. I kept walking up the stairs. After maybe five steps, I had to pause again, scanning the rail with my palm, but still no end. I started to go up the stairs at a faster pace. I heard my heels hit the wood under the carpet; I must've climbed the length of at least two of my staircases before I stopped again, catching my breath. Kneeling on the step ahead, I waved my hands wildly in front of me, searching for the door at the top of the staircase. Or the little strip of hardwood from the ground floor that slid under the door. As I looked up, I couldn't even see the outline of light that would've come from upstairs.
