There was a well-known story that everyone knew. It was whispered between friends, passed down like an old, worn-out legend. We all grew up hearing it, but none of us truly believed it. It was just a tale, something to scare little kids. No one ever really took it seriously, not until that morning.

I never thought it would happen to me. I’m writing this now because I know what’s coming, and I can’t stop it. 

It was early—too early—when I heard it. The hum. That low, vibrating sound that crawls under your skin, chilling you before you even realize what's happening. I’d heard it before, but never this loud, never this... close. It’s hard to describe, like a distant buzzing, or maybe the sound of an engine far away, humming just beneath the surface of everything. 

I’d woken up around five a.m. that day, like I always do. The night had been restless, but that wasn’t unusual for me. I lay there, staring at the ceiling, listening to the hum. It was faint, but it was there. I remember thinking to myself, *just stay still. Just stay still, and it’ll pass. It always does.*

But my friend, Alex, didn’t know that. He never took the story seriously. He laughed when I told him about it—about the hum, about the darkness that came with it. I told him everything I’d heard growing up, how the hum would come at dawn, and how, if you heard it, you had to stay perfectly still. Because if you didn’t… if you moved, it would *find* you. It would take you. 

“You’re just paranoid, man,” Alex had said, his voice groggy from sleep. “It’s just some dumb story. There’s nothing to worry about.”

I wanted to argue, to make him understand. But the hum was louder now, vibrating through the walls, shaking the air itself. I closed my eyes, trying to ignore it, trying to believe it would pass. 

Alex sat up in bed, rubbing his eyes, his face still half asleep. The room felt off, like the air was thick with something we couldn’t see. I wanted to tell him to be quiet, to stay still, but the words stuck in my throat.

And then it happened. 

I don’t know how to explain it. There was a shift in the room, a sudden, oppressive stillness that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Alex turned toward the window, his face puzzled. He didn’t hear it like I did—the hum, the pull of something ancient and wrong.

I watched, helpless, as he stood and took a step toward the window. He glanced at me over his shoulder.

“Seriously, dude, what’s your deal?” he muttered, half-joking, half-annoyed.

That’s when I saw it. It wasn’t a shadow or a movement—nothing tangible. It was just a feeling, like the air had thickened, pressing in on us. Something *was* in the room. Something I couldn’t see, but I knew it was there. 

And then Alex made the fatal mistake. 

He reached out toward the window, his fingers brushing the curtain. I saw it then, just for a moment—a shape, something moving in the darkness, too fast to track, like a shadow with no form. It didn’t have a body, but I felt it. I felt its *hunger.*

Before I could even call out to him, it happened. A sickening, wet sound—a *crack*—like something snapping, like the world itself was breaking open. And then, Alex was gone.

There was no explosion of light, no dramatic noise. One second, he was there, and the next... he wasn’t. It was like the space around him collapsed into itself. 

He was just… *gone.*

I didn’t see how it happened. I didn’t see the mouth, the thing that took him. All I know is that there was a vast emptiness where he used to be, and a terrible, hollow silence in its place. 

I stayed frozen. I had to stay still. 

I don’t know how long I sat there, staring at the empty space where my friend had been. The hum had stopped, but the air felt thick, like something was still watching me. I didn't dare move. I didn’t dare make a sound.

Now, I know better. The stories are true. The hum is real. And I am so, so sorry I didn’t listen. 

Every morning, I hear it. It’s a little louder each time, a little closer, like it’s growing stronger, like it’s waiting for me to slip. Every day, I have to remind myself: *Stay still. Don’t move. Don’t make a sound.* 

I thought I could outrun it, but now, I’m beginning to realize there’s no escape. It’s coming for me, just like it came for Alex. And every morning, I sit in silence, waiting for it to pass. Waiting for the hum to stop.

But deep down, I know it won’t stop.

It will find me. It will find *all* of us. Everyone who reads this.

And when it does… you won’t be able to stop it.

*Just. Stay. Still.*
