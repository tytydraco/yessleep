This has been happening for the past week, and I don't know how much more I could take. I just recently finished high school, and my mother thought that it would be a great time for me to live with my grandparent's at their house for a month. The last time that I visited them was when I was 9 years old, I actually enjoyed my time there as they involved me in various kinds of fun activities back then, such as fishing and since their house was isolated with big trees, me and my sister were able to play hide and seek in the vast land. At first I didn't want to go, since my sister who was older, was still taking up her classes for college at a university. I wanted to back out, when I realized that my grandmother must be lonely as just a year ago her significant other, my grandfather passed away. I thought about it and it wasn't that bad of an idea, I mean I wasn't really that sociable so I didn't have friends and my hobbies include listening to music, reading books, and playing games at my phone. I later agreed as my mother said that it would only be a month, and I would love to see my grandmother just to see how she was doing.

It was a long tedious transportation of busses and tricycles, (tricycles are transportation vehicles in the Philippines that could carry 2-3 persons), but it was worth it seeing my grandmother at the front of house with her warm and precious smile. I went to hug her, and we exchanged greetings, then she asked me to unpack my stuff in the room where we stayed when we came last time. It is the same as I remember it, the only difference is the absence of my grandfather sitting in the living room and watching news through the old television. As the light of day dawned, I helped my grandmother prepare dinner. At the dining table, I was shocked to see my grandmother preparing three sets of plates and silverware, I asked her about it and she said it was for my grandfather, I was both uncomfortable and downhearted, it is sad to see my grandmother missing my grandfather, but I wasn't really good with expressing my feeling so I just ate and helped clean after.

After fidgeting my phone for hours in bed, I could feel myself getting drowsy, so I closed my eyes and anticipated myself to just fall asleep, when suddenly i hear a faint sound of a staff thumping on the wooden floor. "That's weird" I thought for myself, I was confused since I didn't see my grandmother use a staff earlier, I shrugged it off and I eventually dozed off. In the morning, my grandmother was baking what seems to bread, yet again there were three sets of plates and silverware on the dining table. I was shocked when I spotted a wooden staff leaning on the empty wooden chair, I didn't notice it yesterday. After breakfast, I asked my grandmother what she was doing so late at night, her face displayed a sense of confusion, she denied being awake at the time I provided her, then next I pointed to the wooden staff and asked her who's is it since it mustn't have been hers as she could walk in a cinch manner. Her response sent me chills, she replied "It was your grandfather's". I asked myself, if those thumping noises were made by a wooden staff or something else, like a mouse or something, I just didn't want to believe that something or someone could be walking trough the corridor at night using my grandfathers staff.

The night came quickly, the day consisted of me relaxing, and helping my grandmother create sweets which I then use as a comfort snack when I read books. As I was laying in bed, fidgeting my phone yet again, I felt drowsy and opted to sleep early since the day was tiring, forgetting the previous occurrence and fell asleep. I was woken up when I heard a thumping noise, one sounding to be near, but when I tried to move, I realized I couldn't, the only thing that I could move are my eyes, and later it was fixated on a  black figure at the corner of the room, I was sweating and unnerved, though it didn't have any visible eyes, I could feel the figure staring at me, I forced my eyes to close until I passed out due to fear. Note that I have never experienced sleep paralysis before, coming to the place so I should have known it was odd back then. 

The third day of my stay at my grandparent's house came, I told my grandmother what happened the night before and while I was explaining things to her, I saw a smirk on her face then not short after she replied with a joking tone "Maybe grandfather just want to see his little boy", to say that I was scared at the moment was an understatement, but I compelled to give a smile to not dread my grandmother's mood.

I wasn't in the mood to do anything on the third day so I just read and slept in my room, I only left the room whenever it was time to eat. I was scared when the sun set, I forced myself not to sleep, but not long after, I was forced to sleep because of my drowsiness, I always slept early even during major events.I just awoken to a figure at the corner of the bed like the night before, I also noticed that it has come closer. Yet again, I forced myself to sleep, in the morning I called my parents and told them if I could leave now, which they denied hastily.

This has been happening every night in my week stay at my grandparent's house, just lust night I saw the figure near my bed bending down and staring at me.
