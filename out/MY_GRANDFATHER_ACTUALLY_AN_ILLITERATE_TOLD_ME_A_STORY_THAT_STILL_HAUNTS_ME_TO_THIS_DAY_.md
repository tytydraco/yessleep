My Grandad, we called him PUPU. He died in 2013, was very religious and usually did'nt talk to much. Every year on 31 December, our family meaning all the members ( aunts, unc.s, grandmas, cousins, sis in law, etc) will sit in a round, and will make a special sweet called ( CHENG KABOK) by locals. Now, this say event is usually held upto 2 in the morning and is a very noisy event ( noisy yet not disturbing neighbors).
Here, according to some local believes, when a family or a group of people gets so loud specially in the night, the ghouls would sprinkle tiny pebbles (local : NUNGJRENG) up on the roof of the houses there're in. Now, this believe is widely known by the locals and some notorious kids would prank by throwing handfulls of sand to the roofs of houses that are so noisy in the night yet the actual pebbles are'nt made of actual matter (i.e) one can never see/touch it yet it still produces sound. Now lets come to the exact story

It was the 31 December of 2010, we were all ready to start the event. It started and since it's winter each of us had a blacket. 

Stories were told by each other, we got bored as the stories were typical made up stories.
For reference : My grandfather was born in 1929 and in my country especially my state education was'nt taken that seriouly and an actual education system was seriouly adopted since the 1980s and technological advancements since the early 2000. Meaning out of 1000 people 5 people has a T.V in the late 80s-90s.

My grandfather said to us do you want to hear a story? We were like hell yeah!! And, he was like I haven't seen a ghost in my 81 years of living. So, no ghost stories. We were like 12 at the time so most of my cousins left him but I and my brother (he was 16) sat right next him. Then he continued : 

"Before we all came and settle here, I and my 3 bothers and 3 sisters used to live in a village.
People were happy there, farming, fishing, as the village was right next to a huge rage of mountains.
I grew up in a family of 9, the family of the house right next to us was also a charming one and the sad part is they don't have a child. My father and the neighbor Man were friends.
They go farming together daily. Their family had around 7 paddy fields while we have about 20.

One day, I was really ill so my father took me to a local priest ( local name : MAIBA) and he went to the fields with my older brother. My older brother came home but he didn't. 

They searched for him for a month and more yet couldn't find him. People said, he kept all of his belongings in the hut of one of his paddy fields.  Assuming that he might have died or might have been swallow by a python, etc. 
They held his funeral.
As Time flows, he was slowly forgotten.

Yet 35 years later, HE CAME BACK. Wearing the same clothes he wore, fresh muds on his feet and  he didn't age at all. His house was flooded with people of the village. His friends and family even I have aged 35 years yet he is still the same as he was 35 years before. 
In confusion with the changes in his surrounding he asked "what was going on?" He was explained everything that had happened. He cried seeing his  wife in her 70s. 
He was also asked where the hell he was to this he answered, FIELD!! I WAS IN THE FIELD"

We looked at my grandpa and asked "WHAT??" and all he said was he saw it and it was real.

Now, I realised this is a very controversial topic of physics and reality. And even if he made up the story, how on earth could one do it without any physics knowledge? 

Thank you guys for readingðŸ–¤
