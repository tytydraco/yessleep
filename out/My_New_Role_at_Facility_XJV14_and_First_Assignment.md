A close friend of mine, Saed, requested my transfer to Facility XJV-14. He needed to replace the senior technician who had recently been reassigned to a new facility. My role would be similar to my previous one: handling all physical and psychological evaluations of the patients.

That was fine with me. I hated Facility XJV-06 anyway; it was far too cold for my liking.

I arrived at Facility XJV-14 via the most concealed route the Institute could devise: a deep underground railroad system extending for hundreds of miles, hidden from the public. I was surprised they even had the funds to invest in such transportation.

After a grueling 12-hour commute, Saed greeted me as I stepped off the train. "Hello, my friend! How are you today?"

"I'm fine," I replied. "A little sleepy, though. I can never sleep on those blasted things."

"How come?" Saed inquired. "They're super quiet with very comfy beds."

"I never know why," I said. "I guess I'm just restless when I use those trains."

"Of course," Saed said. "Let me show you to your quarters. I'll help you with your bags. Get some sleep. We'll talk more tomorrow."

As Saed guided me to my quarters, I took in the sight of Facility XJV-14. From the outside, it appeared small, covered in a multitude of artificial lights that cast an eerie glow on the concrete structure. The train departed almost immediately after we, along with a few other passengers, disembarked and entered the facility. The sound of the train's departure echoed faintly in the underground tunnel, a reminder of the constant movement below the surface.

Despite the small number of people, the train stop was a hive of activity. Passengers hurriedly gathered their belongings, some exchanging brief nods or words of farewell before heading in different directions. The air was filled with the low hum of conversations and the occasional clatter of luggage wheels on the tiled floor. Security personnel moved efficiently among the crowd, their presence both reassuring and imposing.

The facility's entrance was a stark contrast to the bustling train stop. As we stepped inside, the noise from the platform faded, replaced by the soft hum of the facility's ventilation system. The lobby area, though not crowded, had a steady flow of people moving purposefully from one area to another. Clean white tiles covered the floors, reflecting the bright overhead lights and giving the space a sterile, almost clinical feel. Despite the vastness of the lobby, it wasn't very busy, though there was a steady flow of foot traffic, with people moving purposefully from one area to another.

Inside, the facility was much larger than it seemed from the outside. The lobby area spanned multiple levels, each connected by sleek, modern staircases and glass elevators. The clean white tiles and bright overhead lights further emphasized the facility's secretive and controlled environment.

Armed security personnel greeted us at the entrance, their presence a stark reminder of the facility's importance and secrecy. They checked our IDs at a small security post that resembled a foot border crossing, complete with barriers and surveillance cameras. The guards were efficient and thorough, their eyes scanning us with a mix of suspicion and professionalism.

As we passed through the security checkpoint, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The facility's cold, impersonal atmosphere was a stark contrast to the warmth and familiarity of Saed's greeting. The walls were lined with various signs and directions, but the lack of windows and natural light made it easy to lose one's sense of time and place.

Saed led me down a long corridor, the sound of our footsteps echoing off the concrete walls. The corridor branched off into numerous other hallways, each leading to different sections of the facility. Despite the labyrinthine layout, Saed navigated it with ease, his familiarity with the place evident in his confident stride.

Finally, we arrived at my quarters. Saed opened the door and gestured for me to enter. "Here we are," he said with a smile. "Get some rest. We'll talk more tomorrow."

I stepped inside, the door closing behind me with a soft click. The room was small but functional, with a bed, a desk, and a small bathroom. It was a far cry from the comfort of home, but it would have to do. My previous room in Facility XJV-06 had been larger, but it was much colder due to its location, making it difficult to ever feel truly comfortable. I set my bags down and took a deep breath, trying to shake off the lingering sense of unease. Tomorrow would be a new day, and I had a feeling it would bring its own set of challenges.

The next morning, I woke up to the soft hum of the ventilation system. I stretched and rubbed the sleep from my eyes before heading to the small bathroom to brush my teeth. The cold water splashed on my face, helping to shake off the remnants of sleep. I made myself a cup of coffee, black as usual, savoring the bitter warmth as it coursed through me.

*Damn*, I thought to myself. *I forgot to ask Saed for directions to his office.*

Determined to find my way, I exited my dorm and began to explore the dormitory. The corridors were quiet, with only the occasional sound of distant footsteps or the murmur of voices behind closed doors. The dormitory was a maze of identical hallways and doors, each one leading to another section of the facility. After a few wrong turns and dead ends, I finally found a directory mounted on the wall.

The directory was a detailed map of the facility, with color-coded sections and clear labels for each area. I traced my finger along the map, locating my current position and plotting a route to Saed's office on the tenth level. With a clearer sense of direction, I headed to the nearest elevator.

The elevator ride was smooth and silent, the kind that made you feel like you were floating. As the doors opened on the tenth level, I stepped out into another labyrinth of hallways. The walls were lined with signs and directions, but they all seemed to blur together in my mind.

I walked down several hallways, each one looking much like the last. The facility's size was overwhelming, and I found myself getting lost a few times along the way. The sterile, white-tiled floors and bright overhead lights only added to the disorienting effect. Despite the confusion, I couldn't help but be amazed at the sheer scale of the place. It was a stark reminder of the Institute's power and resources.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of wandering, I found Saed's office. I took a deep breath and knocked on the door, ready to face whatever challenges the day would bring.

I heard footsteps approaching, and then the door opened. "Hello, my friend! Come in, come in," Saed said warmly, gesturing for me to enter his office. It was a small space with a window overlooking the lobby. Fortunately, I wasn't afraid of heights, as the view could be quite intimidating for the faint of heart.

I sat down in the chair opposite Saed's desk. As he took his seat, he looked at me with a mixture of concern and urgency. "I hope you managed to get some sleep," he began. "However, I'm afraid we need to start your assignment right away. I can't delay this order, my friend, even though I wish you could be well-rested for it. Director Anya has requested that patient 20134 be evaluated immediately."

I wasn't surprised. Director Anya had a reputation for always rushing things. I knew that Saed valued keeping his team happy and well-rested, believing it was key to their success. When situations like this arose, it went against his principles, and I could see the frustration in his eyes, despite his efforts to hide it.

"Understood," I replied, trying to sound as composed as possible. "I'll get started right away."

Saed nodded, his expression softening slightly. "Thank you. I know it's not ideal, but your expertise is crucial. Patient 20134 has been exhibiting some unusual behavior, and we need your assessment to proceed."

I stood up, feeling the weight of the task ahead. "I'll do my best," I assured him.

Just before I exited the office, Saed walked towards me and whispered, "I shouldn't be telling you this, but you need to know that this priority directive came as a result of an incident with patient 20133. Director Anya believes that patient 20134 is somehow linked to patient 20133, and we need to conduct this evaluation before something unexpected happens. I'll be assigning you two armed security members to keep you safe."

I nodded, absorbing the gravity of his words. Saed continued, "If you ever feel unsafe, my friend, leave the area immediately and lock the patient's door. Make sure all staff present are outside the room before you lock it. The patient's isolation is crucial for ensuring the safety of you and the other people."

His concern was palpable, and I could see the worry etched on his face. "Thank you for the heads-up, Saed," I said, trying to convey my appreciation and resolve. "I'll be careful."

Just as I exited his office, I was greeted by two members of the security team. 

“Salutations. My name is Cecilia. This is my partner, Dmitri. We will be keeping you safe today,” said Cecilia as she shook my hand firmly. Dmitri followed with a silent but equally firm handshake.

“Let’s guide you to patient 20134,” Cecilia continued. “Follow us.”

As we walked down the hallway, Cecilia handed me a rather thick binder and began to speak about the details of the patient. “I will give you a brief description of patient 20134 so you know who you’re handling. He used to be a lifeguard in a small, isolated town. One day, he found some black glass or crystal at the bottom of the pool and was somehow teleported to a body of water in another world. After returning to our world, he suffered some intense side effects, which seem to come from his time swimming in the other world. First, we noticed hard white and black patches appearing all over his skin. Within months, these patches began to expand across his body, leaving only his face untouched. Wherever the hard patches appeared, he lost the ability to move and feel in those areas. It’s all very sad, really.”

She paused for a moment, allowing the gravity of her words to sink in, then continued. “After about a month, his skin began to crystallize, covering all but his head. His body has become more see-through, and he is now unable to move. We can see some of his organs through his skin.”

Cecilia's expression grew more serious as she continued. "The doctors and researchers here tried all sorts of treatments to cure him, but nothing worked. They used everything from advanced skin therapies to experimental drugs, but his condition just kept getting worse. It's like his body isn't part of this world anymore."

The weight of her words hung in the air. The binder in my hands felt heavier as I realized the severity of the situation. The hallway seemed to stretch on endlessly, each step bringing me closer to the patient.

We crossed another security checkpoint before entering a section labeled *Patients Ward*. The atmosphere grew even more tense, the air thick with the scent of antiseptic and the low hum of machinery. Dmitri, who had been silent until now, began to speak in a thick Eastern European accent. “Cecilia has provided a good description of the patient, yes. But I should mention that he used to talk clearly with people a few weeks ago. Now, he talks in riddles. He speaks of things like a giant tower on an island. Could be relevant, yes?”

I nodded silently, pondering what that could mean. The idea of a giant tower on an island seemed like something out of a dream—or a nightmare. The cryptic nature of the patient's speech added another layer of mystery to an already perplexing case.

As we walked further into the ward, the environment became more oppressive. The walls were lined with doors, each one leading to a room housing another patient with their own set of challenges. The sterile white tiles and bright overhead lights did little to dispel the sense of unease that hung in the air.

Cecilia continued to brief me as we approached patient 20134's room. "We've tried to make him as comfortable as we can, but he's getting worse quickly. The crystallization is speeding up, and we're running out of time to figure out what's happening to him."

I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what lay ahead. The door to patient 20134's room loomed before us, a barrier between the known and the unknown. With a nod from Cecilia, Dmitri unlocked the door and we stepped inside.

The sight that greeted me was both fascinating and horrifying. Patient 20134 lay on the bed, his body almost entirely encased in a crystalline shell, with only his face untouched. His eyes followed our movements with a mix of curiosity and despair. The translucent nature of his skin revealed the faint outlines of his internal organs, a grotesque display of his condition.

The crystalline shell covering his body was a mosaic of white and black patches, each one glistening under the harsh fluorescent lights. His limbs were rigid and immobile, the crystal formations rendering them useless. The patches had spread unevenly, creating a jagged, almost artistic pattern across his skin. His chest rose and fell with labored breaths, each movement causing the crystals to shimmer slightly. Through the translucent shell, I could see his lungs expanding and contracting, their rhythmic motion a stark contrast to the stillness of his crystalline exterior. His heart beat steadily, pumping blood through his visible veins, a macabre display of his internal organs working in unison to sustain him despite his condition.

"Hello," I said softly, trying to keep my voice steady. "I'm here to help you."

The patient’s eyes flickered with recognition, and he began to speak in a low, raspy voice. "The tower... the island... it's calling me..."

His voice was barely more than a whisper, each word strained and filled with a haunting sense of urgency. The mention of the tower and the island gave me goosebumps, the cryptic nature of his speech adding to the unease in the room.

I exchanged a glance with Cecilia and Dmitri, both of whom looked equally unsettled. The gravity of the situation was clear, and I knew this was going to be a difficult evaluation. The patient's condition was unlike anything I had ever encountered, and the mysterious world he had visited seemed to hold the key to understanding his transformation.

Determined to uncover the truth, I approached the bed and began my assessment, my mind racing with questions and possibilities. The crystalline shell, the cryptic speech, the connection to another world—all of it pointed to something far beyond the ordinary. I was resolved to find answers, not just for patient 20134, but for the safety and well-being of everyone in the facility, and possibly, the entire world.
