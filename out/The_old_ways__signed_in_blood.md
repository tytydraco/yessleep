As the only daughter of the Clarke clan, I have been coaxed from a young age to marry a rich man. From preschool I have been pressured to be neat and to learn to cook well in order to be a good wife. 

My family imprinted on me that the most important day of my life is that of my wedding day. My mother always plucked a hair from my head on valentine's day and wrapped it around my ring finger. She swore that it was a good luck charm. This magical hair would draw a suitable partner to me and quickly at that. This was an extremely strange and uncomfortable thought for a little girl. I shrugged it off as yet another crazy superstition. 

This year I turned eighteen and she still insists on carrying on the tradition. When she wasn't looking, I tossed it into the trash. I don't believe in the ‘bad luck’ this act would cause. My future career prospects were more pressing on my mind.

I'm sure you've heard of the superstition that it's bad luck for a groom to see their bride before the ceremony on their wedding day. Especially bad luck to not have something old, something new, something borrowed or something blue. Even worse luck if it should rain on your big day.

The more logical people that I’ve met overlook such silly notions. Adults always make a huge fuss about matrimony. A tradition millennia old and ever present. A legal bonding of two people which changes nothing tangible at all. An excuse for a massive party. The planning, the stress, the tears, all for one day. The one day where you and your beloved stand at the altar in your white dress and black tuxedo. 

When the world shifts on its axis for the happy couple.

Soon my world would shift on its axis.

Unfortunately, not for any good reason - but from pure evil.

I would learn that superstitions, traditions and culture are immensely important to the Wilson clan. To an absolute fault. I would learn that the vow, “Until Death Do us part”, would forever send shivers down my spine. The madness that is about to ensue was catalysed by an invitation to my dear uncle’s wedding and the only proof of this subreddit. The madness being a perfect illustration of the detriments of the old ways.

Ways I had forgotten about until tonight.

**\*\*\*\*\***

Mom clumsily connected our old family laptop to the power outlet. The battery was so old and banged up that it needed to remain plugged in at all times to function. With the click of the power button, the machine heaved to life. 

*Poor thing.*

It was covered with scratches and dents. Plastered with glittery stickers from my Hello Kitty phase. I swear I could hear the ancient inner mechanics struggling and gasping with every passing moment.

With some assistance from my dad, we got our Zoom call up and running. The sunburnt face of my uncle Rodney took up the screen. The quaint dining area of his farmhouse looked like a super realistic green screen backdrop.

“Hi Uncle Rodney!” I chirped. 

I squeezed myself into the frame, pressing against my mother's arm.

“Hi Sugarplum!” He beamed back at me. He still treated me like his little niece.

His eyes wrinkled at the corners as he shot me the most sincere, heart-warming smile I'd ever seen on his face. A woman walked into frame.

She pulled up a dining chair next to him and held Uncle Rodney's hand.

“Everyone, meet Martha! Martha, meet everyone!” Rodney exuberantly introduced her to us. 

She smiled shyly back at us, waving weakly at the camera. Her long blonde hair pooled at her waist in waves like the locks of a mermaid. She had aquamarine-coloured eyes to match the watery aesthetic. They sparkled at us through the tiny screen - wild and lovely. 

I could imagine her perched on a rock out at sea, hair bellowing in the wind. Green strips of seaweed stuck in her hair, imitating bold highlights. A long scaly tail and beautifully decorated clamshell bodice. 

She was an absolute siren. 

*What on Earth was she doing with Uncle Rodney?*

“What the hell is a woman like you doing with a fool like my brother?” Yelled my father. Candidly speaking what was on our minds.

“Bill!” My mother gasped. She smacked his shoulder a little harder than my dad expected.

I could feel myself turning ruby red with embarrassment. 

Dad massaged his aching shoulder in silence.

“Don't mind my husband, dear. He lacks even the slightest bit of etiquette. His mother and I sometimes joke that he was raised by wolves.”

My mother always had a way to smooth things over. She was the queen of smoothing things over and sweeping other things under the rug. 

*Far* too well.

“Well, we don't want to take up too much of your time. We wanted to make a quick call to say hi and…” Uncle Rodney looked expectantly at Martha.

“Um…We're engaged!” she gleamed.

Suddenly the cracking sound of thunder spilled out of the laptop's speakers.

The screen went dark on their side.

“The power's cut out! Darn storm fried the circuit. I'm sorry about this guys…we'll keep you updated! And just…be happy for us, would ya?”

“We will, Uncle Rodney!” I yelled at the screen. 

“Love you guys!” he yelled back. 

“Byeee!” We sang out.

Then there was nothing but the melodic tone of the video call ending.

\*\*\*\*\*

The next week we received a blue envelope in the mail. I anxiously ripped it from our monstrosity of a mailbox. Dad had fashioned various animal skulls onto a wooden beam, totem pole style. 

My family is a strange bunch. My mother is a reiki healer (heals through your energy field and stuff - I know) and does part-time grocery deliveries, my dad is a mixed media artist creating all kinds of grotesqueries (coffee tables with Crash dummy limbs for legs or lamps adorned with shark teeth). 

Uncle Rodney is the groundskeeper at Elm Wood cemetery. He always seemed a bit too comfortable around death. Growing up I would get made fun for my eccentric family but it was nice that things never got boring in this family. Little did I know how true that statement would prove to be.

The blue envelope had a silver card inside embellished with white lace trim. It was an invitation to attend his wedding in Elm wood. In just a month's time. 

*Gosh, he barely knows this chick and now he's marrying her in four weeks!*

My head swirled with the absurdity of it all. At least they seem very much in love. Mom and dad seemed happy for them, with the right amount of weariness.

I thought of the venue handwritten on the shimmering invitation. The old church on Ringwood Road. The last time I was there was for pop-pop’s funeral.

My parents grew up in that small town of Elm Wood. We have very fond memories of visiting it from time to time. Summers spent at lake Agnes, winters huddled in log cabins watching shooting stars against the darkest skies, community potlucks filled with laughter. Just your typical close-knit rural town.

I smiled to myself, clutching the blue envelope to my chest. 

*It'd be really nice to visit again.* 

I paused my nostalgic thought as I felt the discomfort of something, not at all made of paper, pressing against my chest. I fished around the envelope's insides and grabbed a thumb-sized rectangle. It was tightly wrapped with what seemed like animal hair. I curiously removed the strands to reveal a small wooden tile.

A bizarre rune was burned into its surface.

**\*\*\*\*\***

Dad had been singing nonstop since we left home, approximately two hours and 17 minutes. Another one of his strange quirks was that he did not listen to the radio on road trips. He believed we should “be in the moment!” and “bond through song!”. He forced me to put my phone on airplane mode and to chuck my earphones into the boot. From time to time I'd check if my ears were bleeding from the sheer racket he called singing. 

“You might as well have thrown in a ball and chain since we *torture* in this family!” I yelled, furious at the circumstances.

We seemed to be driving along this winding road for eternity. The skies had grown overcast and full as we headed to a higher altitude. The palm trees of home morphed into giant evergreens that whooshed past in blurs of autumnal hues.

Then we passed a little sign, the only thing protruding from the ground besides the surrounding flora.

A sign reading “Welcome to Elm Wood: Population 333 666”. 

*What an odd number,* I thought.

It too whooshed past in a yellowy blur.

I rolled down the window excitedly.

We rolled onto the main road that split the city's economic hub into two. Redbrick stores and restaurants flanked either side of us accented by endless rows of string lights overhead. An old man swept Auburn leaves from the pavement outside his barbershop. 

His 1950s style outfit and handlebar moustache made it feel like we'd stepped through a time portal. He tipped his bowler hat warmly at us as we cruised by, then continued sweeping. The streets were so clean, the town so quaint and picturesque.

“Wow!” My mother exclaimed. “They've really polished the place up nicely! Oh, imagine what the cabin will look like!”

My parents had no living family left in Elm Wood aside from Uncle Rodney and some estranged cousin in an old age home. They booked a cabin not far from the town centre for the next two weeks. They decided to turn the wedding visit into a full on vacation. I fully supported their idea.

After about 20 minutes we pulled into a clearing in the woods. A charming log cabin stood before us, a creek rushed past its left. An inviting swing set sat to its right.

Dad was still fiddling with the front door, clearly struggling to get it open.

I hopped to my feet and inhaled the surrounding woody scent deeply. 

I exhaled happily, “Feels like home, doesn't it?”

**\*\*\*\*\***

Mother was smearing blood red lipstick on her lips in the bathroom mirror when dad's phone rang. 

“Hey Bill!” Uncle Rodney blared through the phone.

“Hey, Rod! How's it hangin’?” Dad replied. He was currently fighting with the tie mom got him for the rehearsal dinner. Dad never usually wore anything dressier than closed shoes. 

“Listen, I have some bad news. Martha's come down with something awful. She seemed okay this mornin’ but things took a turn for the worse. We're on our way to Mount Manson Hospital over in Lawson”

“You don't say? That's awful, Rod. Should we come through?”

“No, it's 30 miles out. I'll keep you all updated and I'm sorry about all the fuss with rehearsal dinner and everything, but we'll have to push out the whole lot.”

“Okay, Rod. Don't worry about anything, just focus on Martha right now.”

“Can’t stop worryin’ I'm afraid.”

“You're in our thoughts, Chief. Keep us posted.”

“Betcha.”

*Click*.

Mom stood in the doorway, halfway through a French bun hairdo. 

“What was that sweetie?” She mumbled with a Bobby pin gripped between her teeth.

“Martha's going to hospital, dinner's off,” he stated. Totally uninterested and already scrolling through a food delivery app.

“Pizza?”

\*\*\*\*\*

Uncle Rodney was still at the hospital when I decided to stop by his work. My parents had no qualms getting me out of their hair for a few hours and I’d grown tired of their antics all the same.

I know it's super weird but I actually really enjoy visiting the cemetery. I spent quite a few afternoons hanging out with Uncle Rodney here when I was little. 

It felt homely and sweetly nostalgic.

The wrought iron arch stood proud over the entrance. Tiny grey stones created paths that converged at a central bubbling fountain. This place always seemed like a little city in itself. The scattered family mausoleums looked like houses in an opulent neighborhood. The stone pathways, roads connecting the homes. 

The grass surrounding the graves was lush, green and perfectly manicured. Well kept wooden benches were thoughtfully placed every few feet. Little brass signs were riveted to them, representing the person or family the bench was donated in honour of.

My favourite place was the little chapel on the far end. The grass sloped off to an embankment, a wider part of the creek. A curved concrete bench stood overlooking the rushing waters. I'd often sit there and make little arrangements from the flowers that bloomed randomly between the graves or sometimes from bouquets left on headstones that were beginning to wilt.

I checked for the grave of Storm Lewis (D.O.B 2015 - D.O.D 2021). When I was a bit younger I remembered looking forward to seeing her grave. A rather morbid thought, I know, but she had a very caring mother who tended to her grave. 

With every passing holiday she'd clean it up and decorate it for her little girl. Last Halloween she carved orange & white pumpkins and placed them around the grave. She placed little bat decorations on the headstone and a plastic cauldron in front of it with dry ice. 

The previous December she stuck artificial candy canes into the soil, wrapped the headstone in tinsel & blinking fairy lights and placed a reindeer plushie next to the grave.

This particular visit a white, orange and red floral arrangement sat in front of the headstone. A garland displaying bright paper turkeys adorned the headstone itself. I smiled to myself and touched the headstone. Fairly apt for the first week of November. 

*I really hope she can see what her mom does for her.*

I turned my attention to the chapel again and flinched.

It looked like a woman was sitting there already. She hadn't been there a moment ago. Her blond locks swayed gently in the breeze. I back stepped, wondering if I should turn and run. Then in a split second, the woman was gone. 

Goosebumps appeared all over my shaking body.

*What was that?*

*I must have been seeing things.*

Uncle Rodney did tell me about *things.* The legends that he'd heard and the personal experiences he had working as the resident caretaker. All the typical ghost stories: A floating woman in white, a black shadow dog, a scratching sound seemingly coming from inside the newly buried coffins. All of which seemed to revolve around *night time*, though. He never mentioned an apparition of a blonde lady. And she looked so *normal,* so *real*.

A deep sense of dread twisted my stomach into knots.

*Why did this seem so important?*

**\*\*\*\*\***

The melodic ringtone of dad's phone cut through the silence of the night. It sounded like it could be in the room with me.

Our cabin was set up so their bedroom was cozied into the back left of the building and my room (a spare bedroom with a fold-out couch) was sat tightly on their right side. Though the exterior facing walls were constructed from thick ancient logs, the inner walls were paper thin modern drywall.

I blinked the sleep from my eyes and pressed my ear to the connecting wall.

I could hear the flick of a bedside lamp.

“God Rodney, it's the middle of the night,” Dad mumbled. His voice was thick and groggy. 

A gut wrenching wail erupted from his phone's receiver.

The sound seemed to seep through the connecting wall, coating my room in absolute dread.

I didn't need to hear anything else. 

I knew at that moment that Martha had passed away.

\*\*\*\*\*

The service was brief and beautiful. A handful of Martha's family attended the church and stayed for the burial. They were from out of town and needed to leave just as soon as they'd arrived.

Uncle Rodney went above and beyond with the gravesite of his beloved, planting tree saplings and flowers in delicate patterns around the grave. A freestanding wrought iron bird feeder stood next to her headstone. Apparently she'd been an avid lover of birds. 

It was extremely touching.

The day passed at superhuman speed. It finally felt like things were settling when we were gathered around the cramped dinner table at Uncle Rodney's. We ate straight from our Chinese takeout boxes. I didn't dare open my fortune cookie. It seemed…*inappropriate*. 

Spirits were oddly high around the table. Mom made light banter and Uncle Rodney even managed to crack a smile. I furrowed my brow as I chewed my dinner. 

*Was I the only one in mourning here?*

After a roar of laughter in response to a dirty joke, my dad inquired with Uncle Rodney, “So should I arrive at the church around 7 to help set up or what's the deal?”

My jaw dropped, chopsticks halfway to my mouth. My father has a pretty messed up sense of humour but this was going way too far. I looked to my mother, preparing for the verbal berating she was without a doubt about to unleash upon my father. 

But nothing. 

She merely added that she would do her best to get me out of bed on time the morning of the ceremony.

I couldn't believe my ears.

“This is a sick joke, guys,” I blurted. I pushed away my takeout. My appetite had been completely ruined.

“What are you on about, dear?” Asked Mom. No sign of remorse for her disrespect or any inclination of acting.

She was serious.

My head spun.

My eyes flicked to the other two adults seated around the table.

Each one’s face as deadpan as Mom's.

“I….need to go to bed,” muttered to myself. I nearly stumbled as my spiraling thoughts turned into literal vertigo.

“It's only 7PM?” My mother asked, worry clear in her voice.

“I can't be around you all right now!”

I clambered down the hall, vision fuzzy like it was whenever I had a high fever.

I collapsed onto my bed and let the darkness of my room swaddle me to sleep.

\*\*\*\*\*

*My eyes shot open at the sound of church bells ringing. I sat on an oak pew close to the pulpit. A giant stained glass window stretched out behind the priest and a dapper-looking Uncle Rodney. The early morning light poured through the stained glass, covering the congregation in a kaleidoscope of colour.*

*The priest clad in cream and gold vestments called upon the congregation to stand. A distant organ began to play a wedding march. We turned eagerly, peering down the aisle to catch the first glimpse of the bride.*

*The bride made her way down the red carpeted aisle, arms hooked with her proud father. She wore an elegant white satin gown with a skirt that jutted out all around her like a princess in a fairy tale. Her face was covered by a thick tulle veil, bordered with an intricate lace. The pair slowly made their way to the pulpit in time with the music.*

*Her father placed the bride’s gloved hand on Uncle Rodney's - symbolically giving her away into his care. The couple turned to each other, she curtseyed in front of Uncle Rodney and he lifted the veil off her face.*

*My breath caught in my throat.*

*That was no blushing bride.* 

*A greyed face looked out from under the veil. Her eyes were empty sockets, somehow still able to see her groom's face. Flaps of skin hung loosely from her decaying skull. The remaining ligaments and muscles contorted into a perverse imitation of a smile. Unmistakable Golden locks framed her ghoulish face and bounced as she recited her vows.* 

*I began to hyperventilate, looking around the church for any confirmation of what I was seeing. I only saw happy tearful faces, watching the ceremony unfold.*

*I turned back to watch the unholy union that was taking place at the chapel. My eyes met the empty sockets of the bride inches from my face. The holes where her eyes had been were overflowing with fatten maggots.*

*I screamed, clutching my hands to my face protectively.*

My eyes snapped open to the varnished knotty pine ceiling above my bed.

I glanced around me.

No church. No corpse bride. Just my room in the cabin.

The next 24 hours were a blur. I stayed in my room, staring out of the window. My parents would knock at my door and leave food for me on a tray. I refused to reply to them or eat. 

I sat curled into a ball on my bed, staring at the pale blue bridesmaid dress that hung off my wardrobe’s handle. The wedding was set to take place tomorrow. 

*How could they pretend this was okay?* 

*What would I see?* 

*Who or what would Uncle Rodney marry?*

My stomach twisted into knots at the thought.

A knock came at the door again. 

“Kayla, I'm coming in,” Mom called and pushed the door open.

I hid under my blanket, pretending I was asleep. Evidently I was not doing a good job.

The coils in my mattress squeaked as she sat next to me. She put her hand on my covered body and began to stroke my arm.

“I didn't think the time would come so soon, Buttercup, but I think it's time that I tell you about the old ways.”

**\*\*\*\*\***

“Back in your gram-gram’s time people didn't live a very long time. When a couple were to be wed it was such an incredible and special thing. It meant so much more than it does in modern times. 

Sometimes it was strategic and people were arranged to be married for financial or political gain. Or, sometimes, possibly a peasant girl was lucky enough to snatch a wealthy tradesman's heart. Prenuptial contracts took on a whole other life in those days…

Anyway, If you married into the right family it could mean the end of poverty for you. It could mean generational wealth: Not having to worry if your family would have to worry for food or shelter ever again, same for your kids, their kids and so on. 

So as I said, unions were extremely important. So important that if things went wrong, say the groom or bride passed away, the marriage would still need to take place. Remember the contracts I told you about? 

Sealed in blood, I'm afraid. 

Absolute. 

And these traditions…haven't left parts of the country”

I threw my blanket off in a huff.

“So what does that mean? Uncle Rodney’s supposed to marry a bag of bones tomorrow?”

“Well, no, he will be marrying Martha's spirit. The two of them were fully aware of this scenario should it arise.”

“And that thing in the invitation? The symbols?” I could hear my voice quivering as I spoke.

“This phenomenon is called a ghost marriage, sweetie. That rune is there to ward off…*other* spirits…that may *interfere*. Now, with the ceremony happening tomorrow I need you to follow my instructions.”

I just stared wide-eyed at my mother.

I scanned the room, looking for any sign of absurdities like pink elephants or fairies.

I was desperately looking for proof of my psychotic break.

“When dealing with the dead like this we need to be extremely careful. There are do’s and don'ts. Are you listening, Kayla?”

I looked at my mother incredulously.

Mouth still agape.

I managed a nod.

“Good. Things could get a bit hairy over the next few weeks if you don't do as I say. Listen carefully:

* After the ceremony you need to pour salt across the threshold to your room. 

* You need to lock and unlock your door three times before you go to bed and don't open it until morning, no matter who you think is asking you to.

* Keep the curtains shut after sundown.

Okay? Now say it back to me.”

I sighed and repeated a summarised version of her crazy rules.

“That should do it. And be kind to Uncle Rodney. This isn't an easy thing for him to do.”

**\*\*\*\*\***

The ceremony time had been moved to 6PM by my mother, apparently this was an auspicious number. 

This trip really brought the quack out of my family. 

We met in a round clearing further East. Uncle Rodney was waiting for us. He wore all linen, organic and beige. His shoulder length hair was slicked back from his face. His feet were bare and covered in the mulch of the forest. He held an A4 photograph of Martha tight against his chest.

My mother would be the officiant today.

My father and I stood awkwardly as mom wrapped a long strip of brown leather around Uncle Rodney’s wrists then around the photograph of Martha. She bound them together tightly with multiple knots.

She recited a strange shortened version of vows that she had Uncle Rodney repeat back to her. After no more than five minutes she pronounced the ghost couple husband and wife. A breeze kicked up a pile of dead leaves, causing them to crackle across the forest floor. The Earth's energy shifted. I could see tears beginning to form at the corners of Uncle Rodney’s eyes. 

My heart ached for him. 

I ran up to him, squeezing my arms around him tightly.

With the makeshift ceremony complete, we headed back to his house for a small ‘celebratory’ dinner. We decided to spend the night there to give him some comfort in company. Mom planned a buffet breakfast for the following morning. 

I was given the worn loveseat to sleep on in the lounge. The house was open plan, meaning the kitchen lounge and dining area were all practically squished into one room. The lounge opened onto the back porch via a glass sliding door. The back porch overlooked a wide expanse of forest.

Mom sprinkled salt around the couch since I wasn't in my room and told me to lock the sliding door like she asked. She duct taped a tablecloth to the sliding door as a makeshift curtain. She nodded as she confirmed that all the rules had been followed. 

“Now sleep tight, sweetie. I love you”, she cooed and kissed me on the forehead. *I wonder at what age she’ll stop doing that.*

“I love you too,” I responded and curled up on the springy mattress.

My eyelids drifted shut in the dark comfort of the room. Sleep came to me quickly that night.

A bluish hue shone behind my shut eyelids. I yawned, opening my eyes, fully expecting it to be morning already. 

Moonlight.

Moonlight had flooded the room with a fantastical blue. The off-brand tape holding up my makeshift curtain had come loose, causing the right corner of the table cloth to hang untidily against the sliding door. I could see the moon and trees clearly through the glass.

I rose to my feet and groggily made my way to the sliding door. I shuffled my feet thoughtlessly cutting a path through the grainy salt circle around my temporary bed. As I raised the tablecloth to stick back in place, movement in the woods caught my eye. Aside from the moonlit ground I could barely make out anything in the black treeline. I squinted, forcing my eyes to find the source of the movement.

That's when I saw it.

Or her.

A figure.

Standing still as a statue amongst the trees.

A faint voice called to me through the departing glass.

“*Kayla…*”

I slammed my hand against the part of the wall where I knew a light switch existed. It flicked on, bathing the room in a cool white. I looked back out the sliding door.

The figure was gone.

**\*\*\*\*\***

I managed to fall asleep after my midnight jump scare. In the morning I woke to the smell of bacon and flapjacks. Mom was hard at work lining the entire kitchen counter with various breakfast foods. I grabbed a crispy strip of bacon and chomped off the end. 

“How'd you sleep, honey?” She asked in a sing-songy voice.

“Not well, actually…” I trailed off.

She turned from the fruit bowl she was arranging. Her face was instantly concerned.

“What happened?”

“Nothing really. I just…the tablecloth came off in the night. I think I saw something outside when I went to put it back.”

Mom digested this information carefully then grabbed the salt pig off the counter.

“Grab a handful of this,” she commanded.

After last night, I would not question anything she asked of me again.

I took a scoop of salt from the ceramic holder and waited for her next words.

“Good, now throw it over your left shoulder. Look straight forward.”

I did as she asked. Feeling incredibly silly.

“Now spit over your right shoulder.”

I frowned. 

*Gross*.

I obliged. This was the most disgusting thing I'd done since wetting the bed as a toddler.

“That-a-girl. Now help me lay the table.”

Oddities seem to be our new family norm.

\*\*\*\*\*

Things seemed to calm after this. We headed home shortly after. Back home to palm trees, golden beaches and people in shorts & flip-flops. 

I still had a month until college orientation. I spent most of the day at home with dad while he worked on his projects in the garage. I took the opportunity to get a head start on my literature reading list.

My favourite place to read was on a beanbag in the TV room. I tucked my feet beneath me and turned to the second chapter of ‘Pride and Prejudice’. I slipped into the world of the book in my hands, happily allowing the minutes to pass when I began to hear an annoying creaking. The weather was fair with not so much as a breeze. Perhaps that tropical storm was coming sooner than reported. Or maybe dad was using some strange machinery again.

The creaking faded into the background as I immersed myself into the book once again.

“Kayla?”

“Yes”, I responded automatically and flipped to the next page.

“Kayla?” 

“Yes? I'm in the TV room!” I yelled over my book.

*What did mom want?*

My stomach dropped.

*Mom?*

*Mom wasn't home. She had appointments in town today. She wouldn't be back ‘til dinner time.* 

*But it sounded like she was down the hall.*

I shook my head. I must be hearing things. I snuggled into my beanbag and continued reading.

“KAYLA!” The voice yelled loudly now, directly into my ear. 

I shot up, dropping my book.

I sprinted straight out of the house and into the garage. Checking over my shoulder for anyone following me. Dad had a welding helmet on and earplugs in. He seemed to be in the middle of fashioning a metal sculpture of…a pineapple?

I whacked him against the head to get his attention. 

“DAD THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE!” 

**\*\*\*\*\***

He threw off his protective gear immediately and grabbed the wooden baseball bat he'd recently decorated with thrift store dentures. 

I moved behind him as he made his way into the house, gripping the back of his hoodie. 

“COME ON OUT HERE!” He yelled, ready to confront whoever had invaded our home.

We stood in the entryway as we awaited an answer.

“COME OUT! I HAVE A WEAPON AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO USE IT!” He yelled into the emptiness of the house.

SLAM!

The front door slammed shut behind us.

I ran to the door handle, rattling it wildly. It wouldn't budge. We were locked in.

“If you don't get out of here I swear I'm going to call the police!” Dad gripped the baseball bat to the point that his knuckles were completely white and devoid of blood flow.

Our tropical climate suddenly ceased to exist, replaced by a frigid arctic cold. I wrapped my free arm around myself in a weak attempt to keep my body temperature up. Dad finally plucked up the courage to step further into the house. 

He peaked around every corner, still ready to swing at any potential threat. I knew deep down that whatever threat was in our home, would not be overcome by brute force. This was something else. The energy of it seemed to float upward from the floorboards, like fresh rain evaporating off hot tarmac. I could almost see its ghostly gaseous form dancing in the ether.

A click and whoosh of gas being ignited could be heard through the adjacent wall. The sound originated from the garage. I could recognize that sound anywhere. 

Dad's propane torch. 

Dad gasped, muttering to himself that he absolutely positively switched it off and that there would be no way to ignite it unless the intruder was outside. Then we heard the low roar of flames carpeting the garage floor.

We split up, frantically rattling windows, turning all door handles leading to the outside world. All to no avail. Dad grabbed his phone and tried emergency services. Impossibly, there was no service. 

A distinct smoky smell hit my nostrils, urging me to try harder in our attempts at freedom. Freedom? The basement window. The only unbarred window in the house, just slim enough for a child to slither through and call for help. Without a second thought I ran down the rickety wooden staircase to the sublevel two steps at a time. 

The grime covered window stared back at me in the far corner of the room, conveniently located above a wooden writing desk. I grabbed the closest heavy object I could find (a heavy duty clothing iron) and heaved it through the window. It crashed through the glass and landed with a hollow thump on the lawn beyond. I grabbed a nearby dust cloth and wrapped it around my fist and forearm. 

Now protected, I smashed the remaining fragments of glass out of the opening and clawed onto the green grass beyond. Black smoke now streamed from the garage and portions of the house. I attempted to unlock the front door from the outside but shot back as the metal door handle burned the sensitive skin of my palm. The fire had spread to the interior of the house already.

I began to scream. Urging anyone who could hear to assist and call the emergency services. A neighbour three houses down curiously peaked out their front drapes towards the source of the commotion. I could see his expression change from interest to pure horror in a split second. I saw him raise his cell phone to his ear as he stared awestruck at our house. 

Orange and red flaming tendrils crashed through the front windows revealing a smoke-filled dining room. Finally people began to gather, hauling hosepipes from their yards and buckets of water to the scene. My vision blurred with salty tears. 

Through my watery field of vision I could make out the shape of Dad laying collapsed in a heap on the wooden floor. There, standing next to him was a feminine figure, veiled and enrobed in white. 

**\*\*\*\*\***

Dad hadn't suffered more than smoke inhalation and some trauma from the entire affair. The damage was quite severe to our rental home though. The landlord had decent insurance that would cover the repairs but he politely asked us to pack our things and never come back.

Uncle Rodney had moved up here recently to be closer to us, among other reasons. With the assistance of his upper middle-class in-laws he was able to fund his new business venture: Clarke Landscaping and Tree felling. A brilliantly located entrepreneurial gig in the heart of a tropical city. 

With kindness and understanding he let us stay at his condo until we could get back on our feet. Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months. After a year of tightening the purse strings and careful saving, my parents were able to put down a deposit on a two bedroom house 5 minutes over. 

With this new home my mother cleansed the space in every way she could think of: hiring priests, mediums and freelance ‘Ghostbusters’. We laid down roots in this cleansed sanctuary. Years passed without incident. 

This winter my boyfriend, Keith, and I will have been together for 7 years. Yes, we had the usual ups and downs but these 7 years have been absolutely magical. With the end of his training at a prestigious law firm on the horizon, Keith popped the question on my birthday. Mom and dad were absolutely thrilled. “We're going to have an attorney in the family!” She boasted. 

*Nevermind her only daughter's accomplishments*. 

To celebrate, she invited us for a 3 course dinner tonight. She insisted we bring nothing but ourselves. The air smelled like Christmas when we walked through the front door. Crispy ham, cloves and honey. 

 

“Hey sweets! Sit at the table, gonna bring the food to the table now”, mom called from the kitchen. 

Dad was already seated at the head of the table. He carefully rose to his feet, hugged the two of us then threw himself back down onto his seat. His knees had been giving him serious problems lately. That’s what years of recreational baseball gets you. Dad beamed with joy through the pain. My parents were so overjoyed for us.

Uncle Rodney arrived a few moments later apologizing for his tardiness. He evidently had an emergency tree felling job. Keith and I took our seats at the table and chatted idly with my boisterous father and his over-boisterous brother. Mom brought out bowls of soup as our starters, placing them on the table settings in front of us. Bright red tomato soup with half a cheese toastie perched delicately across the rim of the ceramic bowl. I practically drooled at the sight. We spent the night eating merrily. My heart felt full surrounded by old and new family. 

Our dessert seemed to be served from a decorative silver cloche. Mom made her way from the kitchen and placed it in the centre of the table. She exchanged looks with dad and Uncle Rodney. I flicked my eyes to Keith, telepathically communicating my concern at this exchange. 

 

“Thank you, lovebirds, for joining us tonight! We’re ever so happy for you and can’t wait to welcome Keith into our fold!

Dad clapped enthusiastically. Uncle Rodney hiccupped in response, face flushed red from consuming one too many glasses of wine. 

“Keith, I’m not sure if my daughter has told you but we are a very traditional bunch,” Mom lifted the lid of the cloche with finesse, “So we’ve taken the liberty to start your marriage off on the right foot! Just like the old days!”

I gripped Keith’s hand.

Upon the platter lay a sheet of parchment inscribed with calligraphic writing ending with two dotted lines.

Keith frowned with confusion. 

*How blissful ignorance can be.*

I looked into his eyes, tears beginning to form at the corners of my own. The trauma still fresh in my mind. 

“It’s a ghost marriage agreement.”
