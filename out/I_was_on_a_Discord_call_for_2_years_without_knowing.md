I downloaded Discord around 3 years ago to play video games with my friends. When I graduated university and had to become a functioning member of society, I had to unfortunately move on from the usual late-night gaming sessions.

Maybe leaving it at that would’ve been the best option…

One night, for some reason, I decided to get back on Discord. I got settled in a job as a Marketing Consultant in a well-known firm fresh out of university and am now used to the demanding work schedule, so I figured why not reconnect with my mates. It was 2am and had no work the next day, plus my parents were out of town for the week so it was perfect.

I opened Discord on my computer and began looking through the messages that I had been missing, thinking of which one to respond to first. One of them, however, stood out from the rest.

It wasn’t a message. It simply said “ongoing video call.” It was a call with someone I hadn’t messaged before.

I am in a lot of Discord servers, so getting random messages from several people wasn’t out of the ordinary, especially back when I was active. Maybe it was a bug? A friend pranking me? I wish.

I hesitated and checked the call. My face was seen on the screen, which was weird because the computer didn’t signal that the camera was on. Same with my microphone. It was also on.

“What the fuck?” I muttered under my breath. The thought of being on a call without even realizing sent shivers down my spine. Feeling my fingers tremble, I took a deep breath.

Next to my face on call was a turned off camera from the person I was supposedly calling. Their profile picture was an anime girl. Their microphone was on, but I didn’t even dare to say anything. 

Panicking, I ended the call and grunted.
“What the fuck was that?!” I said to myself. Surely that was-“

Before I could finish my sentence, I heard the recognizable sound of a Discord notification coming from my computer. I could feel my heart stop for a second before I looked down.

“Looks like you finally realized lmao.” It was from the person I had just called, probably a guy. “2 years on a call and just now you know? HAHA”

“2 years?! Wo tf are u?” I responded. I couldn’t even spell correctly with my shortness of breath and my hands trembling. I don’t know if it was paranoia, but I suddenly felt a strong feeling that I was being watched.

“You should see your face rn haha.” They typed back. 

I heard a thud and jolted from my seat. Turning around, I saw my dark room. It felt strange, but I thought I saw a shadowy figure on the other side of my room, staring at me. Not even the brightness from my computer could catch it. I couldn’t even confirm if it was real or my brain playing tricks on me, but the fear certainly was there.

“Who’s there?!” I yelled. I cringed at my shaky voice and voice crack echoing across my room.

No response.

Taking a leap of faith, I ran across my room and quickly turned on the lights to my room. I don’t know why that was my first instinct, but I felt safer with the lights on. But as soon as I did that, that shadowy figure was gone.

“Fuck!” I muttered.

I slammed the door to my room closed and locked it. “If you don’t leave now, I’ll call the police!”

The only response I got was the same Discord notification sound coming from my computer. I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to curl into a ball and pray that this would end. I wanted to block this creep, but what if they had personal information on me or my family? After all, he was stalking me.

You know that feeling when you walk while constantly feeling the need to look behind you? That’s exactly what I felt at that moment.

I sat back down and read the message they sent me.

“HAHA what was that reaction?”

“What do you want from me?!” I typed back swiftly. 

I heard another loud thud. I felt embarrassed being this scared over Discord, but I still couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was being watched. This time, it felt like whoever was watching me was even closer than before.

I once again heard the Discord notification sound.

“Lol, maybe you should open your curtains and get your answer there. Do it or your family will be in danger.”

My heart skipped a beat.

“Open your curtains.”

It echoed in my head again.

“Or your family will be in danger.”

As I read the message once more, I heard a knock on my window right in front of me. Pushing myself off my chair, I grabbed the closest object I could use as a weapon: my lamp on my bedside table. 

My legs began shaking uncontrollably. I didn’t want to know if someone was out there or if they were trying to mess with me, but the fact that they were on a call with me, stalking me for such a long time, was all I needed to know.

Taking a deep breath, I ripped the curtains open and clenched my lamp as hard as I could. As I saw what was in front of me, I screamed.

I saw the face and hands of a man pressed against the glass window, eyes red and wide. He had a wide smile, one I wouldn’t think was possible to achieve. So wide in fact that his saliva was drooping down the window. The second he saw me, he began shaking uncontrollably, as if he couldn’t contain his excitement, that he had just been found after all this time playing his twisted game of hide and seek.

I dropped my lamp on the floor and booked it. As I did that, the man began screaming, banging on the glass.

“Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!” I said to myself as I locked myself in my bathroom.

I dialed 911 and tried explaining everything. I began hearing a sound of legs scurrying around my house, a speed as fast as bees wings. I don’t know if the police will get here on time.

I’m trapped with nothing but my phone and a few toiletries that I could throw at him to distract this psycho while I run away, but I’m afraid that he would catch up to me really fast.

Help, I don’t know what to do. I’m out of options and I hear his footsteps getting closer to my bathroom door.

Why has he been watching me from a call for all this time? Why only after I noticed the call is he after me? What does he want from me?! What do I do?!
