My old job was odd, and a bit opportunistic. Maybe one could consider it “taking advantage of the misfortunate,” but hey. I had to keep the lights on somehow. I used to scout out failing and foreclosed properties for wealthy clients. Mostly old abandoned strip malls on the side of the road, or restaurants that got shut down for not being up to code. Things like that. I would look around and make notes of what went wrong, and come up with ideas on how to improve and revitalize those forlorn failures. I would present the reports to my clients, and if they liked what they saw, they would buy up the property and I’d get a cut. Not anymore though. No, I didn’t have some stroke of guilt for capitalizing on the failures of others. Nobody said life was fair.

It was the Estates that did it. The quaint collection of buildings that served as a “bed and breakfast” in rural Texas. A location I will not disclose. I don’t know if I could even if I wanted to. 

It was a strange email from a new client that sent me there. I figured they had looked me up, or one of my other eccentric buyers referred me. Either way, the property they were sending me to was massive, and I wasn’t about to turn away a commission of that size. I never got the name of the sender, but I didn’t think much of it at the time. Sometimes new buyers liked to keep things impersonal at first. Fine with me, all I needed was a legitimate offer. 

Looking back it feels pretty stupid, traveling out to the middle of nowhere at the behest of an stranger. But the reviews were good, and the B&B website looked professional enough, albeit a bit dated. So I gave it a shot. 

I pulled up to the wrought iron gates to find a winding driveway, just wide enough for one car to snake it’s way through the scrubby brush that encroached on all sides.

The first few buildings I passed were rather dilapidated. Small, stucco cottages that looked like they had been reassigned to storage units, with strange, random objects poking out of the windows and open doors. Not a good first impression, and I made a mental note to recommend sprucing that up in my report. Driving a bit further on brought me to a sort of plaza, littered with more stucco buildings. Fortunately, these seemed to have more regular upkeep. They weren’t immaculate, but the dusty look of the place added to the central Texas charm of it all. 

The slim road I was traveling on wound through the buildings, giving me a decent look at what the place had to offer. The biggest attraction seemed to be the restaurant, according to the rickety sign swinging over the door. It was in the center of the smattering of buildings, and looked pretty standard. A square, wooden structure with a patio area on one side. I mentally evaluated the property as I scanned the other cottages surrounding it. A hot spring spa passed my on my right as I drove. A venue of sorts passed on my left, with open doors that exposed rows of seats facing a worn wooden stage. I finally pulled into an empty parking lot that was nestled between three buildings. The inn was directly in front of me, decorated with wooden inlays depicting tribal hunts and animal spirits. To my left was a long one story building with a sign simply reading, “museum,” and to the right was what I assumed to be another storage building. 

The estates seemed deserted, which was something I was used to, scouting closed facilities and all, so I was surprised to be greeted by a man as I walked toward the inn. He seemed to slip out of the shade near the inn’s door, and his appearance gave me a start. He was dressed in a full black and white 3 piece suit, with slicked, dark hair and droopy eyes. He did not smile upon introduction, but bowed to me. 

“Hello, sir,” he said, with a very dry, old school drawl in his voice. “Your accommodations have been set, just this way.” He gestured with an open, white-gloved hand toward the inn. 

“There must have been a mistake,” I corrected him. “I’m just here to look around, I’ve got a hotel back in town.”

“Oh, no sir,” the butler chided. “That will be much too far of a journey, especially considering that it will be dark soon. There is so much to see here. I expect it will take a few days at the least.”

I wrinkled my brow in confusion. Sure it was a long drive from the nearest town, but I left around mid-morning, hadn’t I? I looked into the sky to see the sun glaring back, sinking toward the western horizon. I shrugged, thinking I had simply lost track of time, and allowed the ostentatious butler to lead me to the inn. Surely the commission I made off this place would make paying for a hotel I didn’t use worth it. 

The interior of the inn was even more intriguing than the outside. A long, carved oak table ran down the center of the entrance hall, accompanied by chairs crafted from horn, bone, and pelts. Two sweeping staircases framed the table on either side, leading up to a number of doors lining the walls overlooking the main chamber. It was a bit eerie knowing that they were all empty, not helped by the fact that the main decorations of the place were full-sized taxidermy animals. My lips tightened in distaste as I was led up the stairs, past stuffed bears and lions. Those would have to go; I hoped most self-respecting guests were opposed to poaching. 

“Here you are.” I nearly ran into the butler outside of the door that he had led me to. I was too busy gazing around, making my mental notes. He handed me an old-style brass key, and gestured to the room that he had just opened. It was unassuming, with a dusty four-poster bed and an old CRT television on a nightstand. That would need to be updated. I smiled and thanked him, to which he responded with another bow. 

“I’m not quite tired yet, perhaps you could show me around the property before night fully falls?” I asked. The look the butler gave me in response was strange. His stare was just as emotionless as it had been since his introduction, but it lingered a bit too long. His eyes seemed a little more sunken. 

“Of course,” came his drawn reply. He turned and sauntered back down the walkway. As I followed him, I felt eyes upon me. I looked across to the opposing row of doors, and noticed one at the far end slightly ajar. It was difficult to determine, but it looked like a gaunt, pale face was peering through the crack. 

“Are there any other guests here?” I asked, quickening my pace. 

“No,” my host responded. “Perhaps the owners, they come and go as they please. I am not always privy to their whereabouts.”

I glanced back to the open door, but it had passed out of sight as we descended the stairs. To be honest, I was not thrilled to be spending the night there. I tried to take my mind off the situation as we stepped into the Texas air. Sunset had arrived, and my new friend sullenly stared into the blazing sky. 

“Did anything in particular pique your interest upon arrival?” The butler asked. 

“Well, I always enjoy a good soak in a hot spring, but maybe I’ll save that for later.” I looked around the barren parking lot, and my attention was drawn to the sign labelled “museum.”

“Maybe we can take a look in here?” I gestured to the rickety building. 

“Of course, sir.” The butler produced another old looking key from his jacket pocket, and strode brusquely to the museum door. 

“We do not normally allow guest admittance at this hour, yet accounting for our current state of… emptiness, and your important role in resolving such an issue, I would be remiss to deny you such hospitality.”

There seemed to be a bitter undertone to his words that I was relatively used to, yet still, the butler unnerved me. I exhibited only the briefest hesitation when presented with the darkness of the open doorway. The butler ushered me in, and flicked on the light. 

Inside was an assortment of odd and intriguing items. The most stand out were the multitude of life-size wax figures. They were recreations of frontier rangers and Native Americans. As I walked among the displays, I noted the brutal depictions of their interactions. They were certainly interesting, but I doubted the vividly detailed sculpture of a Native American scalping a frontiersman would do much to draw guests. 

There were also skeletons of local animals on display. Armadillo, coyote, bobcat, many of which were decorated with what appeared to be Native American garb. 

“Most of the Comanche artifacts were found within one hundred miles of this property,” came the butler’s voice from behind me. “As well as the animal skeletons.”

I remember staring at the perfectly preserved bones. I’m no anthropologist, but they didn’t look like discovered carcasses to me. I shrugged off the thought. So they killed a few animals to better display their historical items. Maybe it’s a bit tacky, but there wasn’t anything to do about it. Though I certainly had a few changes in mind that I’d suggest to my client. 

As I made my way to the back of the building, I felt the butlers eyes boring into me. I glanced back to find a grim stare full of malice. It was a shocking, and quite frankly frightening expression to see on such a wrinkled face, and I quickly looked away. When I did so, my attention was drawn to an inconspicuous door on the back wall. I stared for a moment, taking note of the old, rusty lock that fastened it shut. 

“What’s through there?” I asked my host, without turning to look at him. 

There was a moment of silence before his response. “Storage and restoration of exhibit pieces. I beg your understanding that it is off limits to any guests.” 

I turned back to the butler, dreading the countenance of the rather off-putting man, but when I looked at him, he had regained his composure, and gestured back toward the exit. 

“The museum is not large, and you have now seen all it has to offer, I urge for your retirement. The nocturnal animals of this region can be rather aggressive.”

I nodded and followed him back through the building, all the while sensing a coldness emanating from the locked door behind me. Darkness had fallen heavily, and no lights illuminated the parking lot. I followed the butler’s silhouette back to the inn. He ushered me inside and bade me goodnight. 

It was odd. It seemed like only a few hours had passed since that morning, but I felt a deep exhaustion. I trudged the way back to my room, and fell into the creaky four-poster bed. Despite how tired I was, I found little rest. In my sleepless haze I thought I heard movement outside my door. Whispering and footsteps permeated the silence. I tried to ignore it, chalking it up to my nerves getting the better of me, but what was much more difficult to ignore was the sudden noise that came from outside.

In the dead of night, maybe two or three in the morning, I heard wailing coming from my window. It roused me from my bed, and called me over. I opened the window and the noise crescendoed into shrieks of madness. I shut it quickly and tried to steady my breathing. The wailing persisted, permeating into the walls of my room. 

I dressed hurriedly and made my way out of my room. The darkness of the inn was oppressive, and I couldn’t help but feel as if hostile eyes watched me as I hurried down the stairs and out the door. Once I stood in the dismal parking lot, I listened intently, but heard no noise. The world felt impossibly still and empty. I felt a chill cut through the warm Texas air, and looked around for its source. There was an open window facing me from the inn with dark, drawn curtains. It was the same room that I thought I saw a face in earlier. The window felt ominous, but that could have been due to the fact that I was standing in an abandoned parking lot in the middle of the night. Of course it would feel ominous. 

Still, the chill persisted, growing from everywhere. It was like a calling more than a physical feeling of cold. An icy beckoning to a locked door. I walked to the museum, each footstep emanating the sound of crunching gravel in the silence. 

The padlock hanging from the wooden door was rusted and old. Now look, when you’ve been around as many abandoned properties as I have, you get used to getting into places you aren’t supposed to go. So I grabbed a nearby rock, looked around the deserted lot, and smashed the lock off with a quick strike. 

I opened the door and moved to the back of the museum in a matter of seconds. I treated the second padlock the same as the first. It took a few more swings, this lock hadn’t been exposed to the elements like the other had, but it was still old as hell, and popped off after my fifth hit. 

I remember the door creaking inward to reveal a staircase that sloped down into darkness. The air was cool and moist, like that of a cave. The walls and steps were roughly hewn stone, carved into the earth. It didn’t appear to be a particularly long staircase, because I could see the base of it, flickering with what looked like candlelight. 

I looked around once more to ensure that I was alone before descending. The steps were slippery, and I had to steady myself on the stone walls. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, a small cavern chamber opened up before me. In the center was a stone altar, atop of which stood a statue of the virgin Mary. Her eyes were dripping with a viscous black liquid, and surrounding her were various organs in wood and bone bowls, bright red and still dripping with blood. 

Black candles burned all around the chamber, casting distorted shadows onto the uneven walls. A red book sat amidst the viscera. I’m sure there were more details, but in that moment, my heart began pounding, my head started spinning, and I turned to run out of that place. But there was someone… something blocking my path. 

Crouching at the top of the staircase was a hunched, naked figure. Even through the darkness I could see its pale, pallid skin. It had a misshapen head that sank too low, on a neck that seemed too long. It stared at me for a moment, before shrieking an inhuman sound. It began slinking down the steps on four impossibly long limbs, slowly at first, but gaining speed. 

I reflexively backed up. I began hyperventilating and shaking uncontrollably. I collapsed at the base of the horrid shrine. I vividly remember knocking over a wooden bowl, spilling a long, sloppy intestine onto myself. I retched and cried, and before I could regain my faculties, the creature was upon me. 

Its breathing was ragged, and its eyes were wet. In crooned and caressed my face with slimy fingers. It seemed a perverse mockery of humanity. 

“Enough!” A powerful voice boomed through the chamber. The cold, wet flesh retreated from me, and the beast shrank back beside a robed figure that was now standing at the foot of the staircase. 

“Eager, aren’t we?” The voice said. “I suppose this simplifies things.” A glint of silver caught my eye as a jeweled dagger appeared from the folds of the robe, clutched in a gloved hand. 

Adrenaline rushed through me. I dove forward, knocking the surprisingly frail figure aside. I felt a tugging in my back and a tearing at my ankle. I fell forward onto the steps, and looked back to see the wide jaws of the pallid creature latched onto my foot. Pointed teeth punctured my flesh. Its black eyes rolled in its bald, vaguely humanoid head. I kicked it with my other foot, and the bone of its face cracked like old ceramic. It howled and fell back, giving me time to turn and scramble up the steps. 

I tore through the museum, the pain of my ankle catching up to me only when I reached the door. A new pain also became apparent then, a searing slash across my back. I reached back and felt warm wetness, and my hand returned covered in blood. I swore and bolted to my car. I wrenched open the door, jumped inside, and slammed my key into the hole. I turned it and… nothing happened. Not even the dry turnover of the engine. 

Fuck. I manually locked the doors, and crouched in my back seat. I chanced a glance out of the window, and saw a truck idling nearby. Its lights were off, and it sat in the narrow drive. With a building in either side, there was no getting around it even if my vehicle was working. 

I saw the museum door slowly open. Nothing came out, and it was too dark to see in. But I knew something stood just inside that darkness. I crouched back down, determined to wait until morning. I had left my cell phone in my car. I had no service out here. It was something I had been warned would happen, but I reached over and tried to turn it on anyway. After a few moments of hitting the button, the red battery symbol flashed. 

It didn’t make sense, I had charged it the entire drive over here and hadn’t used it since. But nothing made sense here. I wasn’t even surprised. I hunched, bleeding and in pain, for a few more minutes. I heard lopsided footsteps circle my vehicle. I heard faint scratches on the doors. The trying of the handle. Then I heard the revving of an engine. The fast crunching of gravel on tires. Then my world lurched. The idling truck had sped toward my sedan, smashing into it and sending it spinning away. I was tossed like a rag-doll, wrenching my neck in the process. 

The passenger door broke open, and I felt cold air blow inside. Far too cold for Texas summer. I crawled out as more adrenaline filled my veins. I heard excited yelps in the night. I attempted to stand, but my body failed me. I writhed and crawled as quickly as I could toward the nearest sanctuary as I heard the truck door slam. 

Somehow I made it to the door of the storage building before the approaching footsteps could make their way across the parking lot. I lurched inside and pulled myself to the nearest hiding place: a misshapen form covered in a sheet. I didn’t notice at first, but the rather sizable building was full of them. I was more preoccupied with the front door, and my pursuer standing in its frame. 

I crouched behind the sheeted object, trying to steady my breathing. Slow footsteps echoed through the sizable room. I wanted to move, but the pain of my injuries was beginning to take over. I had lost a lot of blood, and I felt as if I were about to pass out. 

The footsteps approached, but halted a few feet from me as a new sound filled the building. It was the snarling and scrabbling of the abomination from the museum. 

“Wait now,” I heard the smooth voice of my pursuer say. “You are not whole yet my child. You must be patient. You will have his flesh soon.”

A new cold terror filled me then, and I managed to lurch backward. I had no plan, no means of escape, but instinct forced me to move. There was a rush of sound from my pursuers, but I couldn’t bring myself to look. Not that I could see in the shrouded darkness anyway. All that I could make out were the many sheeted forms that surrounded me. In my desperate flight, I tore a covering away from one and was so shocked I actually stopped in my tracks. 

It was a stitched-together mass of desiccated body parts. A dozen shriveled arms spiraled out from a fusion of cracked craniums and jawbones at the center. It stood on five legs and even seemed to sway. I fell before it, my heart threatening to explode. It was all too much. I couldn’t do anything anymore. I think my mind broke then. I merely stared, entranced. 

“Magnificent art pushes the boundaries of the medium, wouldn’t you say?”

I turned to see the robed man looking upon the horrid amalgamation with a look of admiration on his pale, drooping face. 

“Is it not a comfort to know that your body will become such beauty?”

The creature whimpered at his heels. Darkness began to ring my vision. Then, the strangest occurrence of the night happened. The desiccated tangle of limbs shivered, then took a step forward. The robed man let out a gasp and stepped back. The monstrosity lurched forward again, toward the robed man. Its movements were more than unnatural. They were fluid, yet jerked violently. Its gait was stunted from the odd number of legs, and its multitude of arms flailed in an abhorrent, yet graceful way. 

The robed man wailed, and his crawling, vaguely humanoid creation launched forward in an attempt to protect its master. The many handed abomination effortlessly intercepted the creature and promptly tore it apart, its multitude of limbs working incredibly fast. The robed man wailed again and turned to run, but the monster was faster than any living creature I had ever seen. What it did to the man was over in seconds. There were no recognizable remains. Only gore splattered about the room. 

The conglomerate of limbs came to me then. Slowly. Reverently. It wiped blood from my body and rubbed it into itself. It seemed to relish in the experience. I felt it then. It was a part of me. I was a part of it. I was barely conscious. Completely inert and unable to move, I merely laid limp as it lifted me and began binding my wounds. As it did so, I glimpsed the back of the storage building. Alone in a room by itself was a full sized representation of Jesus on the cross. It had skeletal features and wept black blood. Native American garb adorned its emaciated figure. It seemed to stare at me. 

The many limbed creature then took me from that place. It carried me far. There were others that watched our passage, I think. Dark silhouettes in the night. We passed the many buildings of the estates, back to the front entrance of the property. I was wrapped amidst a dozen rotting limbs trotting on uneven legs. I did not know what to feel. Afraid? Perhaps. Yet I felt as if all the fear had burned through me, leaving behind only a husk. More than anything, I wished for oblivion. So that is what I sought. 

I awoke the next morning on the side of a rural Texas road to a state trooper crouching over me. He was asking me something, but I could not respond. I do not remember much of the time after. I must have been taken to a hospital, because I have a few memories of one. My wounds were treated by someone at least. I could not speak for days afterward, and once I regained my voice, I could not use it effectively. I was… not the same man for a long time. I don’t think I even am now. I have not known how to properly convey my experience. I suppose that is what I am trying to do now. 

I don’t know what happened at that place. It did not feel of this world. Sometimes I feel like a piece of me was left behind there. Sometimes I think I feel it, residing in an unholy amalgamation of flesh, alone in a dark building in the middle of nowhere. I do not know if it’s real. I am not curious. Some things are better left unknown.
