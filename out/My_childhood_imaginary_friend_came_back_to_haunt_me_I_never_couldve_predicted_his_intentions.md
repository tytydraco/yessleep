I was about five years old when Andrew appeared to me. He was my first imaginary friend. I didn’t have any real friends, so I was grateful for Andrew. Mostly we just played dolls together or made up games outside. He never really want away, living with me and accompanying me to Kindergarten. The only time that Andrew didn’t follow me was when I went to church. I’d made some friends at kindergarten but not at church, so I was sad that he disappeared when we went there.

I did enjoy church though. I liked the singing, I liked the people, I liked dressing up for it. Even if I didn’t have many friends there, there were always kids my age that I’d occasionally play games with after the services, so it wasn’t too bad that I didn’t have Andrew with me. I didn’t always understand the priest’s words, but I liked him and I knew that he was very well-respected.

As I grew up a bit, I became more and more of a tomboy. I got my hair cut and joined sports teams. Sometimes strangers would mistake me for a boy, which always got my parents angry for some reason, but it didn’t bother me too much. At some point I started going by the name Ash instead of my full name Ashley, after Ash in Pokémon. My parents didn’t like this, because I was naming myself after a boy, but I didn’t see how it was a problem. They always called me by my full name, but my teammates and Andrew called me Ash.

I’d talked about Andrew a lot when I was a little kid, but I think at some point you’re expected to outgrow your imaginary friends, so when I was about ten years old I stopped talking about him, but he was still there and he was aging alongside of me. My parents had forced me to grow out my hair, and I no longer got mistaken for a boy, which relieved them...but I personally hated it. I liked it more when everyone thought I was a boy. My friends were split pretty evenly between girls and boys, and I always wanted to be seen as a boy around them. Most of them kept calling me a girl, but there were a few who’d call me a boy. I think they thought it was a game of some sort, and I suppose even I thought it was a game too. My parents were constantly telling me that God made me a girl and I better respect that and stay one, that girls can’t change into boys. Well, I knew that much, of course I couldn’t change my gender. I just wish I’d been born different.

By the time middle school rolled around, I still hadn’t outgrown Andrew, but I didn’t interact with him much anymore. Andrew and would only get to hang out when I was alone, and we did less playing and more talking. I’d tell him all about my day and he told me a bunch of cool facts about the world. 

I’m not sure where I was when I first learned about being trans. I think I read about it in a book or something. I started to wonder if that could be me. Had my parents been wrong? Was it possible for a girl to become a boy? I told Andrew before I told anyone else, and he supported me. He immediately started calling me a guy and by he/him pronouns. He asked if I still liked the name Ash or if I wanted to change my name completely, and I said I wasn’t sure.

It took longer to come out to my parents. I was really excited to tell them, but I knew it was a big change and that they might have some questions. I told them over dinner one night.

“Remember how you told me that girls can’t become boys? Well it turns out they can!” I said happily, telling them all that I’d learned. But my Dad cut me off halfway into my lecture.

“No. Stop with that nonsense, I will not tolerate it in this house. You’re a girl, you always have been, and you always will be, being transsexual is to be against God. It’s to say that He created you wrong, do you really believe that?” He slammed his fist down on the table. “You will not be changing your gender, it’s not possible! You can talk to Father Mason if you’re really going to be this deluded about it.”

I remained strong at the table, but I stayed up for most of the night crying. Andrew kept hugging me and telling me that my parents were wrong, that everything was perfectly okay with me. But he did warn me to not tell anyone else, or at least to be careful about who I told.

I became a bit more secluded after that. Andrew was the only person who knew, and although I do think some of my friends would’ve been supportive, I still wasn’t ready to tell them after the horrible incident with my parents. My friends had all outgrown the “game” in which I pretended to be a boy, so Andrew was the only person who saw me for what I was.

High school was better in some ways. The building was much bigger and had way more people, so it wasn't too hard to make friends. I joined the Gay/Straight Alliance without telling my parents, and introduced myself for the first time as James, a transgender boy. I told them to call me Ashley in public though - I was only James during the meetings, but at least it was something. I wasn’t as involved in extracurriculars in high school as I had been in middle school, but I attended every GSA meeting. I doubted my parents had forgotten my failed coming out, so I slowly eased in to trying to present more masculine. A short haircut one month. Gradually buying a more masculine wardrobe over the course of a few more months. I really just looked like a butch lesbian with a really bad fashion sense, but I was happy, and to my relief, my parents weren’t too suspicious about it. I think I pretended it was some type of Hollywood or internet trend, to be a girl who dresses more masculine. Puberty prevented me from being “mistaken” for a boy in public anyway. 

I didn’t think about Andrew much at all anymore, which therefore meant I didn’t see him. I always looked back and assumed that he had been a coping mechanism of some sort, at first for my loneliness and lack of friends, and later for the transphobia that I was facing from my parents. But there will still some things about him I couldn’t explain, things that disturbed me a little - for instance, how many of you could see your imaginary friends? Like, I swear I’m not making this up, but I could *see* him. It’s possible I just had a really active imagination...but he was...*there*. It wasn’t just “I have an imaginary friend with brown hair and eyes and he always wears Spongebob tees.” No, Andrew was as legitimate as the other people that I saw every day, four dimensional and *real*. I could hear him too; he always had a bit of a high voice for a boy which I suppose, again, was some type of comforting feature I made up about him to deal with my own gender identity. But I was the only one who ever saw or heard him. For awhile I thought maybe I’d suffered from some type of hallucination in childhood, but 1.) Andrew was the only thing I saw that didn’t exist and 2.) he didn’t cause any type of *suffering*, quite the opposite. 

Church remained a fixture of my life, but no longer an enjoyable one. I’m sure you’ve all figured out where my mom and dad — and, I was realizing, most of my town in general — got their homophobia and transphobia from. I can’t remember what the sermons were like in my childhood, but the ones I was attending as a teen became increasingly more bigoted. I tried not to take it to heart — I knew that the cruel words were wrong — but it hurt to hear.

I don’t remember how it happened, but at some point I got outed to my family. I think they’d read my texts or overhead me talking about it to a friend from GSA. It was terrible, but they never hit me or even verbally abused me. They took my phone and computer away, and they even stopped letting me take the bus to school — they had to drive me every day now. They made me drop out of all after-school activities. Luckily, GSA meetings were held during lunch time, so I didn’t lose the small support network that I had. My parents made me grow out my hair again and I was forced to wear dresses and skirts every day. They wouldn’t let me wear pants, even if they came from the women’s section.

Not only that, but bad things started to happen to me and my parents, and they were convinced that it was because I had cursed them with my “sinful lifestyle.” There was one weird thing though - every time something bad had happened, I started to see Andrew again. He hadn’t been in my life for years, and here he was again, turning up at my worst times.

The first time he appeared was a night when we’d gotten robbed. Someone had broke into our house and stolen money from our safe. How, I don’t know, but I do know this: When the police came to the scene, I could make out a figure standing in the street. It was too dark to see much, but I saw a tiny teenage boy about my age, with short curly dark hair, brown eyes, and tan skin. He looked familiar, but the person he looked like didn’t exist. I was sure he was just some nosy neighbor watching the crime scene. It had to be a coincidence that he looked like my imaginary friend from childhood.

He appeared again a few months later, during the first week of summer vacation. We were all going on a road trip across the country, and I was actually pretty excited about it. While I didn’t care to be spending so much time with only my parents, it’d be nice to get out and see more of the United States.

We never made it — we got hit on the highway and hit a guardrail. No one was fatally harmed, but the car was totaled and I even passed out due to the shock and initial pain. As I blacked out, I could see Andrew standing in the trees, watching me. I came to only a few minutes later, and he wasn’t there anymore. It didn’t go over too well with my family nor the parademics when I was screaming about seeing someone who wasn’t there, but at least I had the sense to not mention that it was my imaginary friend who had turned evil.

Those were the only two major incidents, but Andrew remained in my life, and he was no longer a welcome presence. I seriously started to wonder if my theory about experiencing hallucinations was true, considering the fact that no one else had ever seen Andrew and he now had became sometjing evil. One day my whole family got sick with a stomach flu, and as I was puking into a trashcan on the couch, I could make out Andrew’s likeness reflected in the black TV screen, staring at me. When I turned around to look, he wasn’t there. Another time I broke my leg walking down the stairs getting ready for school, and I saw him in the waiting room. I learned to associate any pain or injury or suffering with Andrew, and I hated him and I just wanted him to leave me alone.

A strange fact about me is I don’t often have dreams, but I still remember my most vivid nightmare. I was a child again in the dream, playing tag with Andrew, but all of the sudden the dream turned dark. Andrew, who never said a cruel word to me as a kid, took a step closer to me in the dream, glaring at me.

“You need to get out of here. Run somewhere far away. No one here likes you, you’d be better off anywhere else.” I ran away to my house, crying, and when I got inside, my parents were there, but in no state that I ever wanted to see them in. Dead and bleeding out on the floor. Andrew, who had somehow beaten me home, was brandishing a knife. “You’re next, James.”

I woke up screaming at the top of my lungs, turning my lights on and jumping out of bed. I was sixteen years old, no longer a child, and my relationship with my parents was, obviously, strained. But still, I expected them to come in and check on me when they heard me screaming. I ran to their room, terrified that the dream had been real, but they were peacefully sleeping — and yes, I checked to make sure that they were breathing.

“It’s not worth it. I mean it. I was warning you, leave!” a voice from behind me said. I turned around, and I heard footsteps running away but I did not see Andrew or hear his voice again. Needless to say, I did not fall back asleep, and I had to be up in about two hours for church anyway, so I went downstairs and made myself some coffee and tried to forget the dream. 

I couldn’t tell you what happened in church that day. The pastor could’ve given the most disgusting hateful sermon imaginable, or he could’ve changed his course completely and told all of us in the pews to spend the rest of our lives advocating for queer rights — *I was not there mentally*. I kept looking around the room, expecting to see Andrew. 

He never showed up, but I was way too scared to sleep that night. Luckily, that night brought the dreamless and peaceful sleep that I was used to, though due to the lack of sleep I’d gotten the night before, I ended up oversleeping and missing first period.

I got called down to the office in second period, which I at first assumed it was due to my tardiness, so you can imagine my shock when I saw my parents and two officers there.

“Ashley, take a seat,” the officer said, and I had conditioned myself to not flinch at my birth name, but it did make me remember something — hadn’t Andrew called me James after he threatened me? I’d never told him that name. I was only Ash to him. How did he know my chosen name?

It turns out that being late to school that day saved my life. See, I’d had this one suitor at my church, Patrick, a nice Christian boy on the surface, but deep down he was someone who’d heard the rumors about me being queer. He thought I was a lesbian though, not a pansexual trans guy, and he’d always ask me if I wanted him to “fix” my homosexuality. He was just a sleezy dude, I never saw him as much of a threat, but it turned out he’d been lingering around the school that day with an attempt to kidnap me — he also had a gun and a knife in his trunk. He’d gotten pulled over for speeding, and he confessed everything, which seemed weird to me, but then the officer made a comment that made me freeze up.

“He said that someone named Andrew said that he would kill him if he did not confess. Is there anyone at your school with that name, or at your church?”

Imaginary Andrew had been the only Andrew I knew, but this comment made me think. Could Andrew still be looking out for me? After all, he’d threatened to kill my potential kidnapper/murderer/rapist/God knows what. But Andrew had threatened *me* as well, telling me that I was next, and I couldn’t forget the nightmare about what he had done to my parents. My former friend wasn’t a serial killer, was he? Maybe I was still loyal to him in a way, because I still couldn’t bring myself to see him as much more than symbol of really bad luck. I hated him and feared him, yes, but I still had so many years of good memories with him.

Life quieted down a bit after the incident with Patrick. I put all of my energy into applying for colleges, trying to find ones that were located in queer friendly areas and were far away from my parents. I couldn’t exactly look up “LGBT friendly colleges” on the home computer, which was surely being monitored, and I still didn’t have my devices back, so I mostly relied on school computers or my friends from GSA who were in the same boat. I actually forgot about Andrew for awhile, until one more final incident, the night before I was going to sneak off to my first Pride parade. I ended up getting awfully sick from something I ate, and when I was crawling from my bedroom to the bathroom for the fifth time that night, I got a glimpse of someone sitting on my neighbor’s porch. It was only because I knew who it was that I was terrified. Had it been anyone else I would’ve assumed it was some guest that my neighbor was hosting who was taking a smoke break in the middle of the night. Stomach issues aside, I didn’t get much sleep that night, and I was way too unwell to make it to Pride.

After that, life looked up. I got accepted with a full ride to a huge college about eight hours away, in a medium-sized hippie town in a blue area. My parents were pretty concerned about me going off to a big liberal school for reasons that I don’t have to explain, but I’m luckier than most people, because at least they still *allowed* me to go. The end of high school was a whirlwind, now that freedom was in site. I never saw Andrew again, and I truly forgot about him as I started to count the days until I moved to my dorm.

College was much easier than in high school in a lot of ways; the workload was heavier but I could also choose my own classes and schedule, and of course, I was free to be myself in peace. Life was going great! I had a job, I was thriving in my program, and I had a great social life. I only saw my parents over holidays, which was more than enough for me. In my second year of college, I decided to bite the bullet and start my medical transition. I knew that this would surely mean getting disowned, but I could handle it. It was well worth it to be able to be me. About a year into my transition, I passed as male to most people, and even those who initially read me as a woman would be accepting once I corrected them. I got a boyfriend who not only was okay with my trans identity, but outright celebrated it. I’d gotten back into sports again, being able to play on male teams. Life was crazy, but it was also normal, all things considered.

Last week though, I got a text from a number I didn’t know. It didn’t even look like an American number, but the text was in perfect English and it was clearly meant for me, as it read,  
 “Hey James! Could you meet me on the third floor of the library at 7 PM, in the computer room?"

I texted back, “sure, but who is this?” I assumed it was some project partner or classmate whose number I’d forgotten to save, but I was unsure why they might want to meet me, as I couldn’t remember lining up any study sessions or anything. I never got a text back from the number, but I made my way to the library around 7 anyway.

At first I thought maybe I’d been pranked, as I didn’t see anyone there. But a few minutes later, someone walked in, someone who looked familiar in ways I couldn’t place, but it was not a pleasant familiarity. Definitely not anyone from a class.

“It’s been awhile,” the man said.”How are you doing?”

“Uh…I’m alright. I’m sorry to be rude, but uh…” I didn’t know how to ask this guy who he was without coming off like an asshole.  
 “You don’t recognize me, do you?” he asked. “I’m Andrew.”

Andrew. My first friend who later became someone who wasn’t that.

“You mean, you were real?” I asked. I don’t know why I asked it — of course I knew he was real. I’d see him any time something terrible happened to me.

Andrew smiled. “I am, but not in the way that you might think. Let me explain. I’m not a figment of your imagination, but nor am I a person proper. I’m someone who is like you, or was like you at one point.”

I cut him off, I couldn’t help it. “I know exactly what you are. You don’t need to tell me you’re not a person, no person could be as fucked up as you are.”

Andrew smiled sadly. “James, please just hear me out for a minute. I never wanted to cause you any pain. I’ve always been protecting you.”

Bullshit.

“The first time you saw me again, when you first started to think me evil. Tell me about that night," Andrew went on.

I scoffed. “We’d gotten robbed. We’d gotten robbed, and you were just there watching! Probably laughing!”

Andrew smiled still, but his smile was no longer sad. “You’re right that I was laughing, but wrong that I was only watching, and surely wrong about the reason why I was laughing. It was me who took the money. Your parents had…not great intentions about how they wanted to spend it. They wanted to put a bunch of their savings into sending you to conversion therapy, James. I couldn’t let that happen.”

“Conversion…therapy…” I repeated. I wouldn’t put it past my parents, honestly, but I still didn’t believe Andrew. I’d seen him too many times, in too many bad circumstances for it to make sense.

He went on, “Same when you got into that car crash. There was never a road trip or a vacation, they were gonna send you to one of those awful religious camps. The trip they told you about was a lie. I had to get you into that accident. When you broke your leg, your parents were going to send you to a private meeting with that awful priest later that day. That time when you saw me when you were sick with the flu? You’d missed church that week due to your illnesses, and Patrick was planning on inviting you to lunch after the sermon. I’m sure you can figure out his intentions. Same for that nightmare you had, and again when I warned you verbally...I meant it literally, James, that you were next. I never intended or even wanted to hurt your parents, though it did tempt me at times when I saw how they treated you. No, I chose that nightmare because I knew it would stick with you. When I said that thing to you in the dream about how no one in the town liked you, again, I didn’t mean to hurt you, I just thought it’d be something that would eventually push you to get out. The night you got sick before going to Pride, it was because your parents would’ve caught you and I couldn’t bear to think about what they would’ve done to you.”

I was quiet for a few minutes, taking in Andrew’s explanation. I decided that I believed it. Andrew had been my friend all along - my protector - and I'd thought that he was evil.

“I hated you, you know,” I said. “I really thought you were out to get me. I should’ve known better.”

Andrew waved away my apologies. “Don’t feel bad about it. If it’d been up to me, I never would’ve caused you any pain whatsoever. If it were in my control, I would’ve had you win a trip around the world and that would’ve been why you couldn’t go to conversion camp. I would’ve given you a sweet dream of the real me, the me who loves you, where I warned you directly about Patrick’s intentions and told you how much you meant to me. But there are some things that I can’t control, and even still, fear sticks with you more than any other emotion does. Scaring you and hurting you was the only way I could make my plans work, and although I know I scared you and hurt you less than what the alternatives would’ve been, I still regret causing you any type of pain.”

“I forgive you,” I told him, because of course I did. “This whole time I thought you were some sinister force, when you were really a guardian angel.”

“Not quite an angel, for an angel wouldn’t have caused you to suffer at all. But I am a spirit,” Andrew said.

“A spirit?” I repeated.

Andrew nodded. “You see, I came from a family not unlike yours. I realized I was trans much younger than you did. I didn’t have the word for it, but I started talking to my parents about how I wanted to be a boy instead of a girl when I was just six years old. They didn’t take too well to it, but I didn’t let up. My father murdered me when I was about ten.” Andrew said it so casually, but my heart broke more and more with every word. I stepped closer to him and pulled him into a hug, not letting myself cry even though I wanted to. 

“That’s terrible,” I told him. “I’m so sorry.”

Andrew hugged me back for a solid moment, but then he pulled away to look me in my eyes. “Do not be sorry. After I…well, you know, after I died, I came back to this world as a ghost. Not your typical ghost, though. As you can see that I’m plenty solid and capable of presenting myself as a human when necessary. What I do is, I act as a protector for other trans children in unwelcoming environments, providing them with friendship and doing everything in my power to protect them. As you’ve seen, unfortunately that protection doesn’t always look like protection, but it is what I’m doing. Remember when we were kids and I’d always tell you all of those geography facts about the world? Well, they were all based on places where I travelled, other kids I needed to protect. I still do it to this day. I always change my age to be around the same age as the kids, but if you account for my human birthday I’d say I’m in my mid-forties, age wise, though I don't age like humans do.”

It was surreal - most people wouldn’t believe it, but I believed every word. Andrew had been my friend, then I saw him as my enemy, but he’d always been my protector.

“I’m very grateful for you,” I told him. “I’m so glad you appeared now, to explain yourself. I never should’ve feared you.”

Andrew smiled at me again. “I understand why you did. But it’s okay, James, you’re safe now. I’m still making sure of that, I’m still looking out for you.”

This time, I smiled back at him. “Yeah. I’m safe now.”

“And if you ever feel unsafe again, you have my phone number now,” Andrew said with a slight laugh. 

I don’t remember how the conversation ended, I just know that we went our separate ways, but it was not a goodbye. I can still feel Andrew looking out for me and watching over me, and like I said, he’s just a call or text away if I ever feel threatened.
