I used to be the kind of person who could sleep through anything. Thunderstorms, sirens, even my upstairs neighbor’s all-night parties—I slept like the dead. But I haven’t really slept in almost a month. Not since I started hearing him down there.

It started as a faint noise under my bedroom floor. A tap. Always one, then two more. Then silence. I ignored it for days. Maybe it was the pipes. Maybe a rodent. I didn’t want to deal with it.

But the tapping kept happening, always between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m., without fail. Eventually, I stayed up one night, phone flashlight on, ear to the wood. Tap. Tap-tap. Silence.

I knocked back. One knock. Then two. Then three. Nothing. No response. I told myself I was being stupid. I’m not the paranoid type. I’m not even the cautious type, to be honest. I’ve lived alone for years. I handle myself. Or at least I thought I did.

One night, I was so exhausted that I passed out early—maybe around 10:00 p.m. I woke up at 2:17 a.m., freezing. My window was open. I never open it. I live on the ground floor. That’s rule number one.

I locked it. Sat up. Listened.

No taps.

I should’ve been relieved, but I wasn’t. Something was… wrong. Like the room was holding its breath.

Then I heard the whisper.

It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t even clear. But it was *underneath* me. Right below the floorboards.

“…help me…”

That voice was hoarse. Weak. Definitely human.

I jumped out of bed, grabbed the crowbar I keep in the closet (don’t ask why—I used to be a bouncer; old habits die hard). I pried up two floorboards. Just insulation and darkness.

“…please…”

Another whisper. Louder. Closer. I yanked more boards up. At this point I was shaking. Not from fear—I told myself—but from the adrenaline. That’s what I thought, until I saw the fingernail.

It was wedged between two floorboards. Old. Dirty. Broken. Blood-caked. Human.

I fell back. I swear I couldn’t move. I stared at that jagged little piece of a person and wondered how long it had been there. I called the cops. They arrived at dawn, asked questions, taped off the place. Told me I’d be contacted later.

That night, I stayed at a hotel. I didn’t go back for three days. When I did, half my floor was gone, replaced with caution tape and a gaping crawlspace below.

They found him.

A man.

Not *buried*, not dead. Just *placed* there, deliberately. Bound. Gagged. Nails driven through his hands and ankles. His mouth was sewn shut with fishing line. He’d been alive—barely. They said he was unconscious from blood loss when they pulled him out, but he made it to the hospital.

I never saw his face.

I got a visit from the detectives last week. They told me something I haven’t repeated out loud to anyone.

The guy under my floor?

He wasn’t the victim.

He was the kidnapper.

And in his bag—which they found beside him—was a camera. Dozens of photographs. Mostly of women. Sleeping. Tied up. Bleeding.

One of them was me.

Taken from above. While I slept. From *inside* my room.

But here’s the part I haven’t told the cops. When I moved in six months ago, I noticed something weird: an old, half-nailed floorboard under my dresser. I assumed the landlord had just done a lazy repair job. So I hammered it down.

I think I sealed him in.

And I think he was watching me that entire time.

I haven’t gone back. But sometimes, at night, when I’m in a new place with new locks and fresh drywall, I swear I still hear tapping.

One.

Then two.

Then silence.

  
I thought that was the end of it.

A human monster under my floor, caught by pure accident—locked in by me, unknowingly. That should’ve been a satisfying conclusion, some poetic justice. But the cops missed something. Or maybe they didn’t tell me on purpose.

When I went back one final time to collect my stuff, I opened the bedroom door and immediately gagged. The floor was clean. Too clean. Bleach. Thick chemical burn in the air. But I saw it anyway—because I knew exactly where to look.

The dark streak that had soaked into the floorboards near the dresser.

Blood.

Not a spill. A smear. Dragged. It wasn’t his.

I knelt down, stupidly, and touched the edge of it. My hand came up wet. Not bleach. Not blood.

Something else.

It was *oil-black* and thick—almost like it had congealed. My heart froze. The room was quiet again. But now that I was listening… I realized the floor was hollow in more than one spot. Like there were sections.

Compartments.

I followed the smear with my crowbar and yanked up a nearby plank. The smell hit me like a hammer. Not just rot. Not just decay. *Sweetness.* Rancid sugar, like spoiled meat sealed in plastic left under the sun.

The compartment wasn’t empty.

It was a box.

A sealed wooden crate, nailed shut from the outside. I clawed it open. Inside was something wrapped in layers of black trash bags, duct-taped shut. The plastic peeled back like skin. Underneath?

Hair.

Human hair. A whole scalp. Long. Matted. Still attached to… something.

I threw up in my mouth but couldn’t stop unwrapping.

What I found inside was a head.

Just a head. No eyes. The sockets were burnt shut—*cauterized*, maybe with a lighter. Her lips were sewn with thick black thread. Her neck stump had *teeth marks.* Human teeth marks. **He bit her.**

I stumbled back, dry-heaving. Then I saw what I wish I never saw.

Carved into her cheek, with the same fishing line he used on himself, was a word:

**“NEXT.”**

That night, I didn’t sleep.

I didn’t even shower. I just sat on the edge of my hotel bed, trying to convince myself none of it was real. Maybe the cops were wrong. Maybe *I* was the one going crazy.

But at 2:41 a.m., the hotel phone rang.

No one calls hotel phones anymore. That alone gave me chills. I picked it up.

Nothing.

Just static.

Then breathing.

Then tapping.

One.

Two.

Silence.

I slammed the phone down.

I called the front desk, demanding to know who called. They said the line was dead—no incoming calls had come through since midnight. I checked my door. Locked. Deadbolt too.

But the window?

Open.

On the table beside it was a single Polaroid.

Me.

Sleeping.

Taken from just above me. Angle was low, like someone was crouched near the bed.

There was something written on the back in red sharpie.

**“Still watching.”**

I don’t know if he got out. I don’t even know if he was ever *alone* under that floor. Maybe there were more like him. Maybe I just got in the way of something older, something worse.

I move every week now. Cash only. I don’t tell anyone where I am. I don’t use my real name, not even online. I keep a bat beside the bed, a knife under the pillow, and a habit of staying awake until the sun rises.

But last night, I slipped.

Just for a second. I blinked, nodded off.

And when I woke up?

There was a fingernail on my chest.

Still warm.
