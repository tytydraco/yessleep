*“I’ll put down 50K on ‘violent outburst’ !”* I shouted, startling a few of the other players at the table.

My intention was to project confidence, asserting myself as the only female in the otherwise entirely male player pool. It was my first game, after all. I didn’t want to appear like the amateur I actually was. So, I had been dead silent and nearly motionless for the prior two hours, quietly observing how my competition played *Tipping Point*, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.

Jittery nerves had unfortunately gotten the better of me, though, and my declaration came out as more of a schizophrenic yelp rather than a firm statement of belonging.

After I placed my bet, there was a long pause as we waited for the arbiter to respond. Big red letters above the game’s central monitor read:

***SBL - OLIVIA and ADULTERY.***

***BASELINE - DEPRESSION/SADNESS.***

***REACTIONS - 2:1 for ANGER, 5:1 for LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS, 10:1 for VIOLENT OUTBURST***

***PLACE WAGER NOW.***

“*…you sure you wanna do that, Sunshine? Olivia never tipped before, no matter what The House puts her through…*” slurred the arbiter, a southern gentleman lounging across the table from me.

Didn’t love my assigned alias, but it wasn’t my choice; they’re given to you by The House. Listed in bold under the rules and regulations in the welcome email.

*“Yes ! Uhh…”* I trailed off, glancing down at the seating chart, “*…Albatross. I’m sure.”*

The grizzled man clucked his tongue and nodded at the concierge working the leaderboard.

*“Alright, darling.”*

Bitting my lip, I prayed that my background in psychotherapy would prove useful for once, and I slid all over my chips into the middle of the sleek wooden table. Between the foreclosure on my house and the recent unemployment, my bank account was dwindling fast.

I needed the win. I needed the win badly.

Another few minutes passed, and all the other players remained silent. With no other bets, Albatross directed us back to the central monitor. Through hijacked cellphone cameras, laptop webcams and CC-TV feeds, we watched the twenty-three-year-old Olivia navigate her day, unaware of her invisible tormenters and voyeurs.

Here’s the premise: The House that ran the game would subject a pre-selected target to a string of “synthetic bad luck (SBL)”. Manufactured car crashes, severe food poisoning, crippling identity theft; to name a few examples. Overtime, this would establish the target’s baseline reaction to misery, whatever that ended up being. Once it was established, us players were off the races, so to speak. Free to bet on what would be the target’s *tipping point*.

Olivia’s baseline was depression.

In that way, we were similar, I mused, watching the young woman’s torment unfold in front of me with bated breath. Like Olivia, agony caused me to crumble into a state of helpless melancholy, time and time again.

That’s where I was a few months ago, actually; stuck in a mire of heartache after the unexpected loss of my mother. One thing led to another, and I eventually found myself here. After becoming a regular at my local casino, a friend of a friend approached me and asked if I was interested in betting on something a little more unconventional, with a lot more potential for profit.

The distant mirage of a big payout enticed me instantly, and I gave that stranger my email address without hesitation.

Minutes later, the encrypted email appeared in my phone’s inbox. The message explained that it was the player’s aim to bet on a target’s “*tipping point*” - the juncture at which an additional episode of SBL strengthened misery into insanity, causing the target to deviate from their baseline reaction. 

Essentially, we were betting on which straw would break the camel’s back.

Once that happened, the email mentioned that the targets were “disposed of” - a discretionary measure to prevent any sort of paper trail that could lead back to The House and its players. I wasn’t sure if that meant murder, but I didn’t exactly feel it was in my best interest to ask and clarify, either.

Ignorance is bliss, and like I said, I needed the money. I could regrow some morality once my life was put back together.

From the vantage point of a Ring doorbell camera, we all witnessed Olivia break a wine bottle over her partner’s head, face flushed and pulsing with red-hot blood. Discovering her spouse’s adultery (at the hands of someone hired by The House, of course) had been her tipping point.

I felt for the young woman. She didn’t deserve the suffering, nor did she deserve to be “disposed of”. At the same time, I couldn’t help but rejoice.

Theoretically, I had just converted my 50K into half-a-million dollars. Honestly, it was pure, undiluted ecstasy. The relief was indescribable. A veritable parade of dopamine exploded into my brain, drunkenly marching through its creases like the streets of New Orleans’s during Mardi Gras.

This was it; this was my win.

Before I could savor the moment, however, a police raid descended on the illegal gambling circuit. 

As I was walked out of that basement by a police officer, handcuffs burning my wrists and my head held low, hot began tears welling up under my eyes. All the hope I had felt just minutes before fizzled out of my deflating heart, diffusing to my skin and leaking from my pores into the night air, leaving me cold and breathless.

On the way to the cruiser, I passed Albatross, his chest pressed against a different cop car, and the expression on his face perplexed me.

I could have sworn I saw him smiling.

When I got home today after spending a night in jail, depression hit me like a sledgehammer. I stumbled around my apartment aimlessly, completely defeated by the circumstances, face contorted into an immovable frown.

But in the last thirty minutes, my sorrow’s been completely erased by a much hungrier emotion.

Absolute fucking terror.

I was checking my emails, seeing if I could find the message that included the rules to *Tipping Point*. I mean, I had technically won. At the very least, the police’s intrusion should invalidate my bet, and I should get my 50K back. It was a Hail Mary, sure, but I didn’t know what else to do. That said, the damn thing was nowhere to be found, and certainly didn’t delete it.

My search was interrupted by another email. Apparently, someone had opened *multiple* lines of credit in my name, and I was now in the hole for another 10K dollars.

In a heartbeat, I felt an unfamiliar emotion crackle at the base of my skull; wild, reckless fury. Before I gave in to the rage and put my fist through the computer monitor, though, I noticed something that may have saved my life.

A tiny red dot on the face of my webcam, showing that it was currently in use.

I was being watched. 

Sweat poured down my face as the realizations started flooding in. 

The last few months have been absolute hell. 

My mother’s unexpected death. My recent unemployment. The foreclosure on my house. Me *almost* winning half-a-million dollars. And now, crippling identity theft at the worst possible time. 

None of it was a coincidence.

Somewhere far away, I’m convinced my *tipping point* is being bet on, and if I had visibly given in to my anger thirty minutes ago, I would no doubt have been promptly “disposed of”.

This post may precipitate my death just as much as anything else, but I’m out of money and ideas.

What should I do?
