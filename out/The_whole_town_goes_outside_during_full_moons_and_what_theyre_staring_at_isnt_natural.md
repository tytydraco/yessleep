My girlfriend Jordan and I moved to Roxboro Hollow three months ago. We thought we'd found paradise: a tiny town nestled in the Appalachian foothills, population 914, where you could rent a two-bedroom house for what we'd been paying for a studio apartment back in Kansas City. More importantly, it was far enough from our families that they couldn't interfere with our plans to get married without the circus they all wanted.

The real estate agent, a cheerful woman named Mrs. Wood, had shown us around town with obvious pride. Main Street stretched for exactly four blocks, lined with the kinds of shops you'd expect: Jacob's General Store, Mariah's Diner, a small post office, and an old-fashioned barber shop with the spinning pole. Everyone we met seemed genuinely friendly, the kind of place where neighbors actually knew each other's names.

"You'll love it here," Mrs. Wood had said as we signed the lease. "Roxboro Hollow is very... traditional. People here value their routines."

We settled in quickly. I found work at the county's road maintenance department, and Jordan got a part-time job at the library. The pace of life was exactly what we'd hoped for – slow, peaceful, predictable. For the first month, everything was perfect.

Then came our first full moon.

I should mention that our house sits on a small hill at the edge of town, with a clear view of Main Street and most of the residential area. Jordan loves to sit on our back porch in the evenings, and I'd gotten into the habit of joining her with a beer after work. The night sky was flawlessly clear at least once a month.

It was during one of these quiet moments that we first witnessed what the locals simply call "the watching."

It started around 9 PM. Jordan noticed it first – she'd been mid-sentence, telling me about some new books that had arrived at the library, when she suddenly stopped talking.

"Tony," she whispered, grabbing my arm. "Look."

Down in the town, people were emerging from their houses. But they weren't walking normally. They moved with an odd, mechanical precision, their arms hanging straight at their sides, their heads tilted back at angles that made my neck hurt just looking at them. Men, women, children – entire families filing out of their homes and gathering in the streets, their faces turned skyward.

"What are they doing?" Jordan asked.

I didn't have an answer. From our vantage point, we could see at least fifty people spread throughout the town, all standing perfectly still, all staring up at the stars. Their necks were craned back so far that it looked painful, unnatural. Some of the angles were so severe that I wondered how they could even breathe.

"Should we go check on them?" Jordan asked, but something in her voice told me she really didn't want to.

Neither did I. There was something deeply wrong about the scene below us. The way they stood, motionless as scarecrows, their faces pale in the moonlight. Even from a distance, I could see that their eyes were open unnaturally wide, like they were trying to take in as much of the sky as possible.

We watched for nearly three hours. None of them moved except for the occasional slight adjustment of their head position, tracking something across the heavens that we couldn't see. No one spoke. No one even seemed to blink.

Then, as suddenly as it had begun, it ended. Around midnight, they all turned and walked back to their houses as naturally as possible, disappearing inside. Within minutes, the town looked completely normal again.

Jordan and I sat in stunned silence for a long time after that.

"Did that really just happen?" she finally asked.

The next morning, we debated whether to ask anyone about it. At Mariah's Diner, our usual breakfast spot, everything seemed perfectly normal. Mariah greeted us with her usual smile, the coffee was hot, and the other customers chatted about mundane things: the weather, the upcoming church BBQ, someone's new partner.

Finally, I worked up the courage to bring it up. "We noticed something interesting last night," I said to Mariah as she refilled our coffee. "Looked like the whole town was out stargazing."

Mariah's smile brightened considerably. "Oh, you saw Him too! Wonderful. Not everyone can see Him clearly on their first viewing."

"Him?" Jordan asked.

"The Gazer," she said, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. "He appears on the full moon, right there on its surface. Such a blessing to witness."

I exchanged a glance with Jordan, our brains both saying *What the hell?* "We didn't really see... anyone. Just people looking up."

"Give it time," Mariah said warmly. "Some folks need a few months before they can make *Him* out properly. He's quite large, you know. Takes up most of the moon's face, even."

We got similar responses everywhere we asked. At the general store, Mr. Patter described "the giant" as having kind eyes, though he admitted you had to look very carefully to see the features forming in the lunar craters. The librarian, Mrs. Chan, told Jordan that the Gazer had been appearing to their community for generations, watching over them with paternal care.

It was like the entire town had agreed on this vague, dismissive explanation and refused to elaborate.

The next month, we were ready for it. We'd marked the calendar, noting that it had happened exactly on the night of the full moon. This time, we watched from the beginning.

At 9:03 PM, the first person emerged – old botanist Mr. Gareth from down the street. Then Mrs. Buckley with her twin boys. Then the Gibsons, the Kings, the family whose name we still didn't know from the blue house on Greenview Street. One by one, they came outside and took their positions.

But this time, we could see more details, and what we saw made my blood run cold.

Their eyes weren't just wide open – they were opened so far that I could see white all around the iris, like their eyelids had been pinned back. Their mouths hung slightly open, and I swear I could see drool glistening on some of their chins. The children's necks were bent at angles that would have been agonizing if they'd been conscious, their small heads tilted so far back that their faces were nearly parallel to the ground.

"Tony," Jordan whispered, her voice shaking. "Look at their fingers."

I followed her gaze and felt my stomach drop. Their hands weren't just hanging at their sides...their fingers were spread wide, stretched so far apart that the skin between them looked painful and white. Some of them had their fingers bent backward at the joints, creating shapes that human hands weren't meant to make.

I forced myself to look up at the moon, trying to see what they were all staring at so intently. At first, it just looked like a normal full moon to me; bright, round, crater-marked. But the longer I stared, the more I began to notice patterns in the shadows.

The dark patches seemed to be moving, shifting and rearranging themselves. What I'd initially dismissed as random crater formations began to look almost... deliberate. Like features trying to form. The longer I looked, the more convinced I became that there was something pulsing and tunneling just below the moon's surface.

"Do you see it?" Jordan asked, her voice strange and distant.

I did see it, or thought I did. A massive face taking shape in the moon's geography, with deep craters for eyes and what looked like mountain ranges forming the suggestion of a mouth. The face seemed impossibly large, as if something the size of a continent was pressing itself against the back of the moon, leaving impressions in the rock.

"We need to call someone," I said, tearing my gaze away.

"Who? The police? What would we tell them? That our neighbors like to look at stars in uncomfortable positions?"

We watched for four hours that night. The face in the moon seemed to become clearer as time passed, more defined, and I couldn't shake the feeling that it was looking back at us. Looking back at all of us.

The third month, I made a decision that I now regret. I decided to get closer.

Against Jordan's protests, I crept down the hill and hid behind the Wood's garden shed, about twenty feet from where Mrs. Wood herself stood with her husband and teenage daughter. From this distance, I could hear them.

They were humming.

It wasn't a melody, exactly but more like a constant, low vibration that seemed to come from deep in their throats. The sound made my teeth hurt and sent shivers down my spine. But worse than the humming was the smell.

They reeked of ozone. The odor was so strong it made my eyes water, and I had to breathe through my mouth to keep from gagging.

I watched Mrs. Wood's face from the side. Her eyes had rolled back so far that only the whites were visible, and the veins in her neck stood out like thick ropes. Her daughter, who couldn't have been more than sixteen, was making small clicking sounds with her tongue in rhythm with the humming.

That's when I noticed the footprints.

In the soft dirt of the Wood's flower bed, I could see dozens of footprints from previous months – but they were wrong. They were too deep, pressed into the earth as if the people making them weighed far more than they should. 

I looked up at Mrs. Wood again, and this time I focused on her bare feet. Her toes were extended, clawing at the ground, and they seemed to be bulging and getting longer as I watched. 

Then I made the mistake of looking up at the moon.

The face was clearer now, more defined than it had been from our distant porch. I could see what looked like enormous eyes formed by the Sea of Tranquility and the Sea of Serenity, with the lunar highlands creating the impression of a broad forehead. The dark patches that formed the mouth seemed to be moving, opening and closing in rhythm with the townspeople's humming. 

Movement.

But worse than that, I was convinced it was looking directly at me. Those vast crater-eyes seemed to focus on my hiding spot behind the shed, and I felt a pressure in my skull, like something massive and alien trying to push its way into my thoughts.

The face in the moon tilted slightly, and I swear I could see what looked like a smile forming in the arrangement of shadows and ridges. A knowing, predatory smile that seemed to say: *I see you there, little watcher. Soon you'll join them.*

I'd seen enough. I crept back up the hill, my heart pounding so hard I was sure the whole town could hear it. Then I'd really be screwed for interrupting their fucked up ritual.

"We're leaving," I told Jordan as soon as I got back to the porch. "We're packing tonight and we're gone by morning."

But Jordan was staring down at the town with a strange expression on her face. "Tony," she said softly, "do you hear that?"

I stopped and listened. The humming was audible even from our house now, a low, thrumming vibration that seemed to come from everywhere at once. But there was something else – a higher pitch, almost musical, weaving in and out of the deeper sound.

"It's beautiful," Jordan whispered.

I grabbed her shoulders and turned her to face me. Her pupils were dilated, and she was swaying slightly on her feet.

"Jordan, we need to go inside. Now."

She blinked slowly, and for a moment, her eyes focused on mine. "Yes," she said. "Yes, you're right."

We went inside and I closed all the curtains, turned on the TV loud enough to drown out the humming. Jordan seemed to snap out of whatever trance had been affecting her, but the experience left us both shaken.

We tried to leave the next morning. I loaded our belongings into the car while Jordan handled the last-minute details like canceling our utilities and dropping off the house key. But when I went to start the engine, nothing happened. The car was completely dead.

Mr. Jacob's from the general store happened to be walking by. "Car trouble?" he asked cheerfully.

"Won't start," I said. "The engine won't even turn over."

"Oh, that happens sometimes around here. Something about the elevation, or maybe the mineral content in the ground. Plays havoc with electronics. I'll call Matt's Garage for you."

Matt couldn't get to us until the following week. His explanation was identical to Mr. Jacob's: something about the local environment affecting car batteries and electrical systems. He'd need to order parts.

We're still waiting for those parts.

It's been two weeks since our failed escape attempt, and I'm writing this during the day because I know what's coming tonight. It's almost time for the full moon again, and I can already feel something changing in the air. The humming starts earlier each month, so faint during the day that you might mistake it for tinnitus or distant machinery.

Jordan hears it too, but she doesn't seem bothered by it anymore. Yesterday, I caught her standing on our back porch, her head tilted slightly upward, her eyes closed and a peaceful expression on her face.

"Just listening to the music," she said when I asked what she was doing. "And waiting for Him to show Himself again. Mariah says He's been especially clear lately."

I don't hear any music. I only hear that terrible humming, growing louder as the sun sets. And I refuse to look at the moon anymore, not after seeing that malevolent intelligence staring back at me from its surface.

Tonight is the fourth full moon since we arrived in Roxboro Hollow. I've barricaded myself in our bedroom with the radio turned up loud and towels stuffed under the door. Jordan is somewhere else in the house. She said she wanted to "get some fresh air" about an hour ago.

I can hear footsteps on our front porch now, slow and deliberate. The humming is so loud it's making the windows vibrate. And underneath it all, I can hear Jordan's voice, calling my name.

But it doesn't sound like Jordan anymore. Her voice is too deep, too resonant, like it's coming from somewhere much larger than her throat.

"Tony," she calls. "Come outside. You need to see this. You need to see what's up there."

The footsteps are moving around the house now. I can track them as they circle from the front porch to the side yard, then around to the back. But there are too many of them. It sounds like a dozen people walking around our house, all in perfect synchronization.

"Tony, the stars are so beautiful tonight. Don't you want to see the stars?"

That's not Jordan's voice. I don't know whose voice it is, but it's coming from right outside my window.

The humming is getting louder. I can feel it in my bones now, vibrating through the floor and up into my chest. The radio isn't helping anymore – the sound seems to be coming from inside my own head.

I think I understand now why no one in town wants to talk about the watching. It's not because they're embarrassed or secretive. It's because they don't remember it happening. Whatever takes them over during those nights, it leaves them afterward, and they go back to their normal lives with nothing but vague impressions and an agreed-upon story to tell curious newcomers.

But I remember. I remember everything I've seen, and I know that whatever's out there in the sky, whatever comes for them every month, it's not going to let me leave Roxboro Hollow. Not now that I know.

The footsteps have stopped. The humming is so loud now that I can't think straight. And Jordan, or the thing that sounds like Jordan, has stopped calling my name.

I can hear the front door opening.

If anyone finds this, don't come looking for us. Don't come to Roxboro Hollow. And whatever you do, don't look up at the stars when the moon is full.

Some things are better left unwatched.
