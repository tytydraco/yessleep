The first thing to note is that the apartment we live in is ANCIENT. Like circa 1930s ancient, pre-dating the hefty requirements demanded by most modern fire codes. But our university’s never been one to cough up even a modicum of the millions of dollars we pump into the institution, which would explain why the apartment is falling apart. It’s fine. Honestly. We managed to skirt our way through the miserable residential buildings we were forced to live in as underclassmen.

Now, as juniors, we had access to somewhat better options. Better’s a subjective term by function, however. Sure, we have our own rooms. We have a kitchen with potable water. No more communal bathrooms either, which has re-instilled my faith in the power of prayer. Though, that doesn’t mean everything’s in perfect condition. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t feel like I’m stepping into a time capsule every time my key manages to brute-force the iffy tolerance from the door lock. It truly does feel like a place preserved in amber. For one, our stove was always kind of funky. It wouldn’t turn off properly sometimes. Nor did our oven.

Now, the second thing to note is that I don’t have very many friends. The way I was earmarked for this apartment unit was through random assignment, the importance of which entails little elaboration. It’s not that I have a hard time making friends, it’s that I have a hard time keeping them. College has always felt like this liminal space, a crossroads in the cosmos, where the only thing that feels permanent is the impermanence. But, I couldn’t help but feel a little more optimistic when I met the guys I’d be living with. Well, two of them, at least.

Tommy and Wyatt—pretty cool dudes.

Tommy’s a junior, Wyatt’s a senior. Tommy has these really sweet, limited edition Andor posters in his room (and like fifty LEGO sets). He’s majoring in astrophysics, which isn’t too far off from my own major: pure mathematics. Wyatt, meanwhile, is a major pothead. I’m not even sure what he’s majoring in, he said he’s dipped his toes in enough pools. He would’ve liked to earn a degree in philosophy, but our school doesn’t offer that. Wyatt’s dad is the owner of some auto-insurance conglomerate, so even if he doesn’t end up graduating, he can probably score an internship there. But, anyway, the best thing about Wyatt is that he *loves to share*. He always keeps at least four Stiizzys on him.

“Alright. How much do you guys know about Descartes?” Wyatt takes a merciless hit of his Stizzy. Puffs out smoke from his nostrils like a dragon.

“A fair amount actually,” I say, taking in my own share from the pen. “I think this might be the first time we’re speaking the same language, Wyatt. The Cartesian coordinate system, the rule of signs, imaginary numbers, and whatnot.” 

“That’s right.” Wyatt grins. “I’m assuming that comes up for you too, eh, Tommy boy?”

Tommy coughs. Nods. “Oh, yeah. Obviously. Heaps of analytic geometry.”

Wyatt smiles. “I bet. I’m coming at this from a slightly different place, however. See, Descartes was one of the founding fathers of strong foundationalism. And to get to this point, he developed what’s known as Cartesian doubt. It’s a pretty well known tradition of skepticism.” 

“Alright, now you’ve lost us,” I say, and Tommy coughs again. Presumedly in agreement.

Wyatt chuckles. He picks up a LEGO figurine of Darth Vader. 

“Think of it this way. What do you think I’m holding?” 

I cock my head. “Well, if I had to guess, it’s a terrible omen. It’s the reason Tommy’s going to remain a virgin.”

“Hey!” Tommy shoves me. I choke a little on the smoke, trying to contain my laughter. Tommy plucks the figurine from Wyatt. “I don’t know about you, Wyatt, but I’m pretty sure this is Darth Vader.”

“Pretty sure? What makes you say that? Why aren’t you a thousand percent certain?”

“I don’t know. I mean, I suppose I am,” Tommy replies.

“The point is you can never be a thousand percent certain.” Wyatt leans back. “At least, not about the external world. All you *can* be sure of is your own existence. *Cogito, ergo sum.* I think, therefore I am.”

“Oh, sure, that I’ve heard of,” I say. “But…” I snatch the figurine from Tommy. “If Darth Vader doesn’t exist, what is it that I’m seeing? That I’m holding in between my fingertips?”

Wyatt shrugs, and his smile grows knottier. “That’s where the Fiend comes in. According to Descartes, our entire reality could be a manipulated construct, one orchestrated by some evil, evil little creature. A demon who just tricks us into thinking there’s any sense to our senses.” 

We sit in this for a minute or two, thinking, taking respective puffs of our Stizzys. Then, I glance at the clock. It’s half past midnight. 

“Hey, guys,” I say, standing up. I hand Wyatt my pen. “It’s officially been a week now, hasn’t it? Has anyone actually seen Ezra?”

Wyatt and Tommy look at one another. Clearly zooted out of their minds.

“Um,” Tommy begins. “I don’t think I’ve met him yet. But, you know, his door’s locked. And I’ve heard him come in and out. He’s used the kitchen too, some of those pots and pans aren’t ours.”

“Why don’t you give the door a try,” Wyatt says. He nods in the direction of Ezra’s room. The place always appeared to be a blackhole. A vortex of sorts that never emitted any of its own light, though it seemed to eat up whatever managed to graze through from our side of the plane. 

“Yeah, I mean, hopefully, he wouldn’t mind,” I say. I hesitate but reach toward the doorknob anyway. Jimmy it—but it's as we thought: locked. I turned to look at the other two. “I mean, it’s all a bit strange, right? Do you think we should let someone know about this?”

Wyatt stands, stretches. “I dunno, man. Some people just like to be left alone.”

He makes a good point. So, with that, we all went to bed. I remember lying under my comforter that night, the insides of my head buzzing a little. The buzzing soon manifested into this dreamy headache. To be perfectly frank, I rarely got high before I met Wyatt, so I guess I chalked this all up to my unenlightenment and nothing else. What I couldn’t explain, however, was this faint *whistling* that came from the wall. And it just happened to be a wall I shared with Ezra. 

The next couple of weeks continued almost exactly like this. Classes and homework would swallow us up during the day, and, at night, we’d get baked. I once made the mistake of talking to my *very Mormon parents* while high, which resulted in a long lecture the next day on the dangers of drug abuse.

“We won’t be paying thirty grand a year just for you to poison yourself,” says my dad.

“Honestly, it’s sickening,” my mom adds in this quiet, mousy voice. She sounded like she was on the verge of tears.

Though, of course, I wondered how they even knew I was high? Sounds like they had the necessary experience to pass on judgment like that. These lovely little heart-to-hearts every now and then were bearable, however. At least, it folded in some sense of normalcy into my continued quiddity. Because getting high is just what I did early on in the nighttime. But the further the clock ticked, deeper and deeper into the twilight hours? Well, that was a different story. That’s when the whistling from the other side kept me up. It was always the same somewhat breathy sting. I became less and less confident in my theory that it was due to the weed after talking to Wyatt. The guy looked at me like I was crazy when I first brought it up. 

“Dude, seriously, see a doctor,” he said. “That’s not normal.” 

Besides the whistling, there were other rather subtle signs that Ezra was around. Like Tommy said, he clearly seemed to use the kitchen. Once, I found a pile of this stinking, rotting mystery meat underneath the sink. It took pest control two hours to exterminate all the roaches that had burrowed into the fleshy mounds. Another sign was the dirt tracks. The rest of us would take our shoes off before walking around. But there was always a consistent trail of dirt leading to and from Ezra’s room. Finally, the biggest sign came when Ezra accidentally left his door open for us. We didn’t let the fact that it was midterm season stop us for one second. Seriously, screw Abstract Algebra, right? This should obviously take precedence. 

“Wowza,” Wyatt says as he slowly pushes the door open. “His room’s bigger than ours, that’s for sure.”

Tommy and I followed in tow. Right, no kidding, the room was huge. And yet, it was also barren. It was really just in the same condition our rooms were in when we first moved in. A bedframe, a lone wooden desk, an empty closet. Untouched. The other difference was the temperature. It was freezing. I blinked before my eyes snapped up at the rather sizable AC duct shared between our rooms. I wasn’t entirely sure why the draft was so much stronger in here. The apartment only had the one thermostat. 

“You know, I’m not feeling too good,” Tommy mumbles. “And, anyway, I don’t think we should be snooping.”

“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” I add, looking at Wyatt. “But I agree with Tommy. Maybe this was a bad idea.”

So we closed the door behind us, returning to our own rooms to continue cramming for midterms. That night, however, there was only what I could describe as a ripple in the fabric of our universe. The whistling came as it always did. It came in these slow dog-like pants. The sound tickled my eardrums, slithering it’s way up and down my spine in this chilling cadence. And that’s when the ripple came. That’s when I heard a *knock*. I sat up straight as an arrow. Then, two *knocks*. Three *knocks*. I got to my feet at once, pressing my ear to the door. The knocking continued, keeping with the electric pace that my heart was beating at. 

“Ezra?” I say, softly. 

The knocking stopped. I open my door with a *creak*. I wasn’t sure if I was relieved or even more terrified to learn that nobody was standing outside. I scanned the kitchen, the couch we used as our proverbial hotbox. And then came another *knock*. Then, two *knocks*. I whipped around, confused. What the hell was happening? Where was it coming from? I was about to give up when I noticed something. It appeared to be the tip of a finger, a thumb, right behind the kitchen island. 

“Jesus.” I scampered toward the island, dug out my phone to use as a spotlight, not exactly sure what I was expecting. *It was Tommy*. Insy-bitsy roaches scoured his nude, now catatonic body, weaving in and out of every one of his orfices. His eyes, his nose, his mouth—even his anus. I couldn’t help what I did next. I mean, could you blame me? I turned and retched, hot vomit scorching my nostrils raw. It splatters my soiled shoes. 

I crashed down to my knees. "Tommy... Oh my God. Oh my God."

First, the paramedics came. Then, the cops. I didn’t know what to tell either one of them.

“A knocking, you said? From a-where?” asked one of the officers. He flips open a notepad.

“I-I don’t know,” I say my teeth chattering. “I thought it was coming from outside my room.”

The officer notes this down. “And you think this was Tommy?”

“No, it c-couldn’t have been,” I say.

“Why not?” 

I cradle my head in my hands. The headaches were getting worse as of late. “It’s impossible. You saw the state of him, didn’t you? He’d been dead for a long time.”

“Dead? Oh, no, not at all,” the officer, says gruffly. “Well, not yet anyway. He likely overdosed on fentanyl. But he’s in stable condition.”

A beat. I frown. “Wait. He’s not dead?”

“You seem displeased.” 

“No, no, of course not I’m not!” I say, blinking on the double now. “It’s just… I know what I saw. There were these roaches all over him—“

“Roaches?” The officer raises an eyebrow. “There were no roaches, boy. You sure you don’t want the paramedics to take a look at you?”

I grit my teeth. “No, I don’t need anyone to take a look at me. I know what I saw, I’m telling you! He was dead.” 

The officer pockets his pad. “Did you now? And what makes you so sure?” 

The authorities left the property an hour and a half later. They searched all the rooms, including Ezra’s. Wyatt had slept over at his girlfriend’s that night, so he was in for a pretty rude awakening when he returned. The police found the drug stashes under his bed, which is why they took him in custody. Apparently, there was a good chance the fentanyl Tommy had overdosed on was from the sativa Wyatt had been given us. The police also had the university put in a couple work orders to fix our stove and a couple other appliances. They wanted me to stay in a hotel for the time being. The strangest thing about the entire situation, however, is that the authorities then informed me that no one had been assigned to Ezra’s room this year. I insisted that they were mistaken, there were clear symptoms that pointed toward the contrary. The whistling, the freezing temperatures, the use of our kitchen, the dirt trails, the rotten meat. But the same cop who doubted my story about the roaches pulled up the rental history on our apartment. And, sure enough, there were only three signatures. Tommy's, Wyatt's, and mine.

Even stranger, there used to be a boy named Ezra Reeds, who lived in the building thirty-three years prior. But he died of jaundice when he was barely 21-years-old.

“It really is a terrible thing about your friend, son,” my dad said on the phone, once I was in the hotel room. I sat on the bed, turning Tommy’s Darth Vader figurine in my hand over and over. “But this is why we tried to warn you. Isn’t that right, Martha? It’s a poison.” 

“That’s right,” my mother said in her same quiet, mousy voice. “I just… can’t bear to think. What if it had been you instead?”

After finally finishing that smarting conversation with my parents, I switched off the lights. Set the figurine on my bedside table. For a minute or two, I tried to decompress. Think straight for the first time this  semester. Perhaps even my entire life. The image of Tommy’s body was burned into my brain. The roaches, his near lightless, sea-glass eyes. My own eyes fluttered a little as the weight of the day began to set in on me. 

Which is when I heard the whistling… 

It was raspier than usual, almost melding into what I can only describe as laughter. Despite every cell in my body reeling in protest, I rolled over in the hotel bed. And I glimpse an AC duct above, one  even smaller than the one in my apartment. Two, big yellow orbs peered down through the grating. The eyes of a Fiend. 

I’ll keep everyone posted.
