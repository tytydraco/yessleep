Last summer was so hot, I decided to get a pool built in my yard, it’ll help me and the kids stay cool, and make for great adults night parties. 

I did not for see any issues when I reached out to the company at the end of spring. 

Where I live it rains a lot in winter but the company said they had no problem working on clear days. 


The hole was dug out before the rains came. 

Expensive equipment in the rain is a no no, mud is harder to move, the ground more unstable, just basic knowledge. 


Shortly after it was dug everything froze. A sudden dip into freezing temperatures without any rain. 

Made for a lot of spiders in my house as usual this time of year, my husband was good at taking care of that. 


I do wonder where all the rest of the bugs go? 

Oh well, here I am with my adhd, sitting here rethinking my life, wondering why I have a giant pool sized hole and still no work done on it in December. 

Hell it’s almost January. There’s a break in the weather for the week and the company is closed until January 2nd for holiday. 

My birthday is January 7th, a pool party for my birthday is all i want. 

I mean the hole is there, everything is smoothed out, all it needs is pool cement… they left all the bags in my garage. 


That’s when i got the stupid idea and set my stupid mind to it. I pulled out all the cement bags and started. 

My husband showed me how before he passed. 

He showed me how to renovate everything, he built our house from the ground up along with the rest of the farm. 

He just had to pass before the pool. Fuck him for that, fuck him for leaving me. 

Fuck here I am crying and smoothing cement, I haven’t stopped crying since I rolled over and saw his eyes open, but no life inside. 

It haunts me to this day. 

Fuck now I’m not paying attention, I pushed the pool trowel right into the dirt with my body weight behind it, leaving a crater in the dirt. 


Fuck fuck fuck this is fucking perfect. 
Now I have to get more dirt, fill and compress it, then remix concrete and try again. 

Fuck quick Crete.


I’ve never cussed so much in my life. 

I guess seeing your love of 20 years dead in your bed where your children were made just does that to a person. 


What is that coming out of the hole? I wipe my tears and sit on my knees to look better. 


Ants. Ugh, I guess bugs go underground when it freezes. 16 feet underground is warm when your a tiny bug, that is until I needed a pool. 


Suddenly there were more ants coming out, is that an antenna? From the queen? I scream and jump back as a cockroach crawls out of the hole. 

I guess that was a cockroach arm digging the ant hole bigger…. Is that an ear wig? 

How many bugs are there all together, I guess I thought like people, they separate into their own areas and homes. 


And that’s when I had to run. 

Suddenly black widows, hobo’s, beetles of every shape and color, maggots, worms, ants, every bug on the west coast suddenly flooded out. 

I turned and ran for the house, screaming. 

I tripped and hit my knee on the framing to hold the cement, I feel warmth flooding down my leg as I hobbled towards the house. 


I was screaming and trying to get the bugs off me, i only looked back for a second and I saw the 16 foot pool sized hole overflowing with bugs. 

I shut the door as hard as I could and grabbed the gorilla tape and started taping window sills and door cracks as fast as I could. 

And now here I lay. In my bed. 

At 2 am. 

With an electric Mosquito racket in my hand, my kids curled up together on the mattress I pulled into the living room, with a net over them. 

Let’s play fortress I said… I wish my husband was here, he’d know what to do. 

Fuck…
