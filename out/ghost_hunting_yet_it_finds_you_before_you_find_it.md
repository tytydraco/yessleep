being a ghost hunter isn't one of the best paying job in the world, but the experiences and adventures you get to go on are one of a kind, though I don't like to talk about my experiences much, i had one recently that just doesn't sit right with me, it was the cliché old haunted house type of jobs, a family of four used to live there until they just vanished in the 90s, no ones seen them since and it has even the most profound detectives puzzled, so i didn't have much hope in finding anything.

i arrived at the location at about 11pm so i had time to set up cameras and i don't do this often but i brought my Ouija board with me those spirit boxes aren't always reliable in remote locations like this, once id finished setting up everything i started to record, after about 1 hour of finding or hearing nothing i decided to use the oujia board as a final attempt in making contact with the family, i carefully set up some candles around the board and started the session, i started to lose hope because nothing was coming through but then i heard a whisper, well it was more of a growl, i quickly placed my fingers on the planchet and it stated to spell out the word leave, i asked why hoping to find out more but then everything went silent not even a gush of the wind could be heard, i grabbed the spirit box the see if it would work and it did thankfully, i started asking questions like why should i leave, what's your name, you know the normal stuff, then the candles went out i was in complete darkness but i could still somewhat make out a shadow of some sort in the middle of the room, and then it spoke ''run'' 

i didn't even bother grabbing my things my gut told me to get out of there now, i ran as fast as i possibly could towards the front door but it slammed shut right Infront of me '' times up'' is all i heard before it covered my eyes '' im here'' was the last thing i heard before waking up, i get nightmares but this one felt real, anyway i got out of bed looked at the time, 4 am, i walked to the kitchen to get a drink, but when i walked passed the bathroom door i saw something in the corner of my eye, i was tired so i didn't think anything of it. 

after i got a drink i went to the bathroom to wash my face, after i leant down to the sink i looked up and saw it behind me i read in an article that you're meant to ignore it otherwise it will take over your body, so i did, i continued washing my face and going back to my bedroom, i put a film on my tv and did everything i could to not look at it staring menacingly at me from the corner of my room, for a while it worked but i kept feeling like it was getting closer, so close that it was right infront of me smiling creepily and tilting its head like a confused dog, like it was m̬̟̑͗ó͎̥͡c̖̩̮̔̾͐́ͅk̢͖̠̠͑͗͝͞ĭ̢̜͝n͕̰̳̏͝͡g̥̤͌̈ m̬̟̑͗e͎̫̻͕͒͒̑̃̊͟  i did my best not to look and i think i pulled it off because after zoning out it just d͇̹͎͖́͐̀͠ĭ̢̜͝s͚͈̭̦̈́̈̄͒á̘͉̉p̠͖̠̈́͋p̠͖̠̈́͋e͎̫̻͕͒͒̑̃̊͟á̘͉̉ṙ̻e͎̫̻͕͒͒̑̃̊͟d͇̹͎͖́͐̀͠  anyway that was all, i jus wanted to share my experience with that thing Ĭ̢̜͝ Á̘͉̉M̬̟̑͗ H̫̜̓̂E͎̫̻͕͒͒̑̃̊͟Ṙ̻E͎̫̻͕͒͒̑̃̊͟  i still need to get my things from that hosuefi ugfkau eyfbiai HELP ME kdieoeavuegfho Ý̗̙̝̫̱͐̄̚͞Ó͎̥͡Ụ̩̪̇͆͑́͜ Á̘͉̉Ṙ̻E͎̫̻͕͒͒̑̃̊͟ N͕̰̳̏͝͡E͎̫̻͕͒͒̑̃̊͟X̲̂T͙́, Ý̗̙̝̫̱͐̄̚͞Ó͎̥͡Ụ̩̪̇͆͑́͜ C̖̩̮̔̾͐́ͅÁ̘͉̉N͕̰̳̏͝͡T͙́ H̫̜̓̂Ĭ̢̜͝D͇̹͎͖́͐̀͠E͎̫̻͕͒͒̑̃̊͟ Ĭ̢̜͝ Á̘͉̉M̬̟̑͗ C̖̩̮̔̾͐́ͅÓ͎̥͡M̬̟̑͗Ĭ̢̜͝N͕̰̳̏͝͡G̥̤͌̈
