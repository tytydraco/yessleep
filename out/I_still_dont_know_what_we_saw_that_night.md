*Everything I’m about to share is true to my memory. I don’t care if you believe me. I just want it off my chest. I still can’t sleep properly because of what happened that night.*

Okay… I’m trembling as I write this. Not because it just happened recently, but because the incident was so horrific that even putting it into words makes my heart skip a few beats.

Hi. My name is Duke. Not *the* Duke you might be imagining—but that’s what my friends call me. This happened years ago, back when I was in high school. I can't remember the exact year, but it's something that’s burned into my memory forever.

Back then, I was the typical party kid—staying out late, hanging with friends, living for the moment. That night was supposed to be like any other. We planned a simple sleepover at my friend Darren’s place. Darren was that one guy whose parents *never* gave a damn about anything. Parties, music, drinking—you name it. So we figured, why not chill at his place, drink a few beers, and talk about life under the moonlight?

So night came. It was me, Kyle, and Lenny who showed up at Darren’s place. His parents were out visiting an aunt, and he had the house to himself. We started drinking, talking, and just enjoying the night.

Then things started to get... weird.

We were in the middle of a deep conversation when the power went out. But here's the strange part—only Darren’s house lost power. The streetlights and neighboring homes still had electricity. It was odd, but not *scary*… at first.

We shrugged it off since the moonlight gave us enough visibility through the windows. But it was still a bit dim, so Kyle asked Darren to get a candle or something. Darren nodded and started to get up—

Then **a lamp** flew into the room.

It came out of *nowhere*—from the direction of the hallway. It smashed on the floor, glass everywhere. We just froze.

Darren, being the curious one, decided to go check it out. He grabbed his phone and stepped into the hallway. The rest of us stayed behind, waiting. A minute or two passed in silence.

Then we heard **screaming**.

We jumped up, ready to run to him, when Darren suddenly burst back into the room and locked the door behind him. He was pale, shaking. We all asked what had happened, and his voice was trembling as he told us.

He said he thought maybe a thief had broken in and was messing with us. But as he searched the downstairs area, he suddenly heard voices… **his parents’ voices**.

Which made no sense—they were supposed to be out of town for two days.

He called out: *“Mom? Dad? Is that you?”*

And the voice replied: *“Yes… please come here.”*

Something about it felt *off*, but Darren hesitated only for a moment before heading toward the living room. He pointed his flashlight across the room… and that’s when he saw it.

Two figures, crouching behind the couch. He recognized the shapes—it was his parents. Or at least, it *looked* like them. He could see their backs, their clothes.

He whispered, *“Mom? Dad?”*

Then the living room light **flickered briefly… and went out again**.

In that short flash of light, the two figures stood up slowly and said:

**“Come closer, sweetheart.”**

Darren said his body froze. Something wasn’t right. So he took a step back and asked, *“What the hell is going on?”*

Then the two figures fully stepped out from behind the couch…

And **they had no heads**.

Blood was pouring from where their necks should’ve been. Their bodies were swaying as if they were puppets held up by invisible strings.

That’s when Darren screamed and ran back upstairs.

As he finished telling us this, we were all trying to process it. Was this a prank? But that didn’t explain the flying lamp—or the look of sheer terror on Darren’s face.

Then, **a knock on the door**.

Three knocks.

We all went completely still.

Then a voice spoke from the other side:

**“Darren, honey… can you please open the door?”**

It was his mother’s voice.

Or… something *trying* to sound like her.

None of us answered. No one dared move.

Then the voice came again, a little more insistent:  
**“Please, sweetheart. Open the door.”**

Still, we stayed frozen.

Then, the voice changed. It deepened, twisted—*wrong*.

**“OPEN THE DOOR. I SAID!... OPEN IT!!”**

We backed into the farthest corner of the room, all of us staring at the door, waiting for it to burst open.

But it never did.

Then, out of nowhere, Lenny—yes, *Lenny*—pulled out a cigarette and lit it up.

I gave him a look like *Are you serious right now?* But he whispered back that in his culture, lighting a flame—especially a cigarette—wards off evil spirits.

We were desperate, so we didn’t question it.

And almost immediately… the voice behind the door **stopped**.

Just like that.

We stayed up the rest of the night—completely sober despite all the beer—huddled together. Every hour or so, Lenny lit up another cigarette, just to be sure.

Morning finally came. Darren called his real parents. They were still at his aunt’s place, just like they said they would be. They rushed back after hearing what had happened.

Since that day, none of us ever did another sleepover without a full pack of cigarettes. And definitely *never* home alone.

Now, maybe this story doesn’t sound scary to *you*. But even now, I still remember that voice behind the door—Darren’s “mom” begging us to open it.

I still wonder…

**What would’ve happened if we did?**..

Thanks for reading this all the way to the end... I had a more terrifying incident with my friends after this one... So let me know if you want to see more of it...
