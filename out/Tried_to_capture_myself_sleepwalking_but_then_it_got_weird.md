This morning, I watched a creepy ass video of myself sleepwalking that I can't explain. Then, as soon as the video ended, the file vanished. Gone. 

I figured someone here may know what is happening.

I've usually got quite a scientific mind and generally attribute "supernatural” stuff on the internet to some type of logical and natural explanation. A breeze, a change in air pressure, magnets, psychology, just plain fake, etc… but I genuinely can not think of any explanation that could fit what I just saw.

When I was very little, I was a serial sleepwalker. I didn't think anything of it. My parents used to just usher me back to bed. And at some point, it just stopped.

Then randomly, there was a moment a couple of weeks ago, where at the very moment I was falling asleep, I felt myself begin to sit up. That night, I had a very nice but vivid dream, which I no longer recall, but when I woke up, I could still remember the feeling of sitting up! I felt well rested and didn't feel like I'd had a restless night, but it was bugging me, so I asked my wife if I had been sleep walking. 

She told me that she didn't wake up and didn't notice anything, so I put it out of my mind thinking it was my imagination. Weirdly, she also commented on how well rested she felt and that she'd had a crazy dream that night.

Then it happened again… and again… and a third time. Each time I'd feel myself start to get up, literally at the split second I started to dream.

So I asked my wife again, and she still hadn't seen, felt, or heard anything. She even exclaimed that she's been sleeping better than she had in years. I have previously told her about my history with sleepwalking, and it was something we'd discussed just in case it came back, but in our 10-year relationship, it's never had to come into practice. So we had the same discussion again, just in case, because I was certain it must be happening again.

During this conversation, it was her who suggested I move our ring doorbell from the front door into our room for the night. If I was sleepwalking, I'd set off the motion sensor, and she'd get a notification on her phone. Great idea, I thought, and I did just that.

Well… something happened.

I was laying in bed thinking about work and other rubbish after a busy day, and sure enough, right as I felt the slip into sleep… boom.

I'll now describe what the doorbell camera captured.

In black and white, I see myself sit bolt upright, inhumanely fast. I'm not sure if it just seemed fast in the video, but it must have been within just 2 or 3 frames.  Immediately apparent is the fact that my eyes are wide open by the reflective, shiny way eyes look in infrared. The video quality isn't good enough to see where I was looking properly but it seemed or felt like I was looking at nothing at all… like nobody was home, like someone sleeping with their eyes open funnily enough haha! But… My wife doesn't stir at all. Which is very odd because our bed is quite bouncy and squeaky, also she is a light sleeper usually!

I sit there for roughly 10 seconds before standing up fully on the bed, stripping down completely naked out of my pyjamas, and then I just walk casually off the end of the bed in a straight line towards the bedroom door. The bed was bouncing like crazy and you could hear how loud it was in the video. The wife still doesn't move. 

The camera was placed on the top right corner of the door frame, so it got a perfect view of me walking straight at it. As I come closer, the features of my face just fail to fully come into focus apart from the bright, white of my eyes. Everything else in the picture looks fine, but the face looks just blurry enough, nothing too crazy, to make out any features… Like the rest of the video is in 1080p, but only the face is in 240p. 

So, I walk right up to the door, open it, then simply disappear out of frame. There was nothing too weird about the way I was walking… but I usually have a bit of a limp with a bad knee… while I was sleepwalking I was spry as a spring chicken, just stepping off of the high bed like it was a roadside curb.

The video continues for a little while, showing just my wife, soundly sleeping on her side of the bed without me. Then it ends.

The whole video was about 2 minutes long.

I was expecting to find another video of me returning to bed. But there was none, and as I clicked out of the video to check… it had just disappeared. Fully deleted. I tried to figure out a way to restore it, but unfortunately, it seems there is no way with a ring camera to restore, and as I didn't download the file, I can't get it back.

I didn't even get to show it to my wife, and I haven't even yet told her about this because it would scare the crap out of her… I don't want to do that unnecessarily.

Why didn't she wake up?? I made enough noise and movement to wake up even the heaviest sleeper.

I have checked the house for anything strange or anything having moved etc… just anything to give some clue as to what the heck my sleeping body was up to, but nothing jumped out. Doors were still locked… all seemed fine.

I'm not usually spooked easily. And even now, I'm trying to find some rational explanation why the video just disappeared and a reason why my wife didn't wake up somehow. All of my sceptical braincells are whirring, but I keep coming back to the same conclusion for the first time in my life, that I cant explain this... and the thing I, for some reason, can't shake, is my face in the video. I wish I could show you it. The more I try to remember it, the more it feels like a dream slowly fading or something...

I've set up the camera again tonight in the hopes of getting myself and you all any more information. This time, I've positioned it looking up the stairs so you can see my bedroom door, the stairs, and my downstairs hall leading to our kitchen. I've only got one camera and no other home CCTV, so I'm trying to cover as much as I can with just this single camera for now.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm already planning to pick up more cameras. 

I'm about to head to bed, so I will update this thread in the morning if we capture anything!
