Maria had an idea.  She wanted to trade problems with the Folklore Society.

It took a bit of pleading, but she finally convinced me to go to one of their meetings.  I didn’t want to see any of them ever again, not after what happened last time.  Out of all the entities on campus the thing in the hallway scares me the most.  The flickering man had motives and could be understood and punched in the face on occasion.  The laundry lady could be bargained with.  And the other creatures on campus could similarly either be communicated with or their rules and how they worked could be deciphered to some extent.

The thing in the hallway was more like a force of nature.  Like standing in an open field and hoping to not get struck by lighting during a storm.

That is also why Maria didn’t think the Folklore Society should pursue it any further.  We had more hands-on experience, she reasoned.  They only knew what they’d heard and read and even then, they hadn’t believed it was even *real* until they encountered it directly.  If we figured out what to do about the thing in the hallway for them, then they’d stay safely out of the way, and in exchange Maria wanted them to look into something for us.

And that’s how I wound up sitting uncomfortably at the back of the weekly meeting, waiting for it to end so that I could politely slip away.  Maria had already shared with them our particular problem and I was wondering why I was even there.  My presence felt completely superfluous.  I wondered if Maria thought it would make me feel better to see that our little investigation was in good hands, but I was miserable.  I didn’t want to involve outsiders.  It all made *sense*, but this was personal.

You see, we’re having the Folklore Society look into the dates on that headstone.  The ones that Cassie took a photo of.  That and finding out the lineage of the university’s president.  You can only find information about the current one.  We haven’t found anything about the prior presidents (probably because there was none, there’s only been this one over and over).  But this kind of research is their forte and I guess killing monsters is mine.

I hate it.  I hate that’s what my friends associate me with now.

I wasn’t able to escape that easily, though.  Right at the end of the meeting the club president slipped into the chair next to me.

“Just wanted to tell you what we know so far,” he said quietly, “without making it public knowledge to the rest of the club.”

I do appreciate his discretion.  Throwing this wide open for the whole club feels like a *bad idea*.

“We think there’s a schedule,” he said.  “We’ve been compiling sightings of the creature.  It’s happening about once a week but we think there might be more sightings that aren’t being talked about.  We’re looking for a pattern.”

Uh.  *Once a week!?*  That’s way too much.

“Thanks,” I replied awkwardly.  “Can you send me everything you have found out so far?  And relay anything you come across?”

“Of course.  Hey, uh, are you *sure* you want to do this?”

For a moment I was stunned.  I don’t think anyone has asked me something like this before.

“No, not really,” I finally replied, staring at the ground to avoid his eyes.

“I can tell Maria I’ve changed my mind and we’ll handle it ourselves.  She can get a little ahead of herself when she’s excited.”

Yeah, that was certainly true.  I sat there, waging an internal war.  I could back out.  This didn’t have to be my problem.  For a moment the only thing I heard in my head was the noise of the snapping bones as the thing in the hallway chewed on his latest victim.  It sounded like the noise the flickering man’s skull had made when I slammed it against the pavement, over and over.

“I’ll tell her you’re not getting involved,” the club president finally said, snapping me back to reality.

“No - wait -!”

I grabbed his sleeve.  He paused to look down at me and then very deliberately pulled out of my grasp.

“We’ll still help with the president research,” he said.  “But you know what they say - you don’t have to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  Sit this one out.”

He walked off, making a beeline for Maria. I took off.  I didn’t want to be around for that conversation, or the aftermath, or anything else to do with it.  I wandered around campus instead, walking as quickly as I could as if that would stave off the tight feeling in my chest.  Then my phone buzzed in my pocket and I looked and it was a text from Maria.

‘Sorry,’ it said.  ‘I shouldn’t have volunteered you like that.  Do you want to talk about it?’

Not really.  I didn’t know what to tell her, though.  I wanted to tell her that the club president was overstepping and I was fine and could take care of this, but I also felt deep inside that I wanted to run and not stop running until the university was miles away from me.  I told her that maybe we could talk about it later, but I needed some time to think first.  Then I went home.

Much later, in the safety of my bedroom, I had a thought - I could get some help.  Maybe there would be an easy solution and I could stop feeling guilty about leaving the thing in the hallway up to other people.

I texted Grayson.  I’m not sure what I was expecting.  We haven’t talked since his dad threw himself into the river.

‘The thing in the hallway is getting out of control,’ I texted.

He left me on read for almost an hour.  And when he finally texted me back, all he said was, ‘I know.’  I told him that we were trying to figure out what to do about it and asked if he could help.  He had some authority over the creatures on campus, after all, and perhaps he could use that to bring that thing back under control.

‘if I wait long enough it won’t be my problem anymore,’ he responded.

Because he was going to graduate and leave.  We’d just wrapped up midterms, so we only had a semester and a half to go.  Still.  I turned off the screen of my phone and threw it on the bed before I said something regrettable.  It felt like there was an ugly knot rolling around in my chest, searching for a way out.  I’ve been trying so damn hard to understand how these creatures work and how people can save themselves from them and here he was, declaring that it *wasn’t his problem* to deal with.  I stormed out of my room to find Cassie so I would have someone to complain to.

“Grayson and I are about to have our first argument,” I told her.

“Oh good.  An important milestone of your relationship.  Are you going to actually have it out with him or do that thing where you avoid the topic for three months?”

“We’re not dating.”

“Sure.”

So then I just walked right back into my bedroom before I got in a fight with Cassie.  In her defense, I think maybe she’s getting a little sick about me talking about Grayson.  It’s been on my mind a lot, since we kind of got his dad killed and all.

Grayson wasn’t my only option, however.  A few days later I was heading on campus to sneak into a dorm laundry room.  The laundry lady was there, presumably waiting for me, because none of the dryers were currently in use.  There wasn’t any laundry that was in imminent need of folding.  Her narrow face broadened into a thin smile as I entered.

“You’re my new favorite person,” she declared.  “In case you were wondering.”

“Who was your previous favorite person?”

“This sophomore that sorted their clothing by color after I folded it for them.  That’s some true dedication to the craft.”

Pro tip: sort your laundry by color if you want to get on the laundry lady’s good side.

“So what did I do to surpass them?” I asked.

“Got rid of the university president, of course.  You already got rid of the flickering man and then you just go and throw him into the river for me.”

“That wasn’t what happened,” I muttered but she wasn’t paying attention to me.

“At this rate, *I’m* going to be in charge of campus,” she continued gleefully.

I’m not sure how I feel about that.

“I need help with something,” I said, trying to ignore the horrible idea of a campus controlled by the laundry lady.

She eyed me critically, her eyes narrowing and the wrinkles in her brow deepened.  Her gaze darted up and down, sharply scrutinizing, and I saw a hint of suspicion in her stare.

“You didn’t bring laundry with you,” she said softly.

I pressed my palms against the sides of my legs and forced a smile.  This relationship didn’t have to revolve entirely around her doing my laundry.  I could ask for other things.  That was reasonable.

Or at least, it’s reasonable when dealing with *humans*.

“And you look *nervous*.”

It was the way she said it that broke my resolve.  Slowly, drawn out, like savoring a perfectly cooked steak.  I blurted out what I wanted before I could stop myself, first admitting that yes, I *was* nervous to be asking her for help with this but I didn’t know of anyone else I could ask that wasn’t the devil because oh yeah I have an agreement with him too but that’s not going well and I don’t think I should trust him with *anything* because it’s the devil so I’m here asking her for help and I really hoped she wasn’t offended because I didn’t bring laundry-

“Stop.  Please.  Stop,” she interrupted with a sigh.  “Just tell me what you want, I don’t need the full backstory.”

“The thing in the hallway.  It’s out of control.”

“And?”

She arched a thinning eyebrow at me.

“How do I stop it?”

“You don’t,” she replied curtly.  “You stay out of its way and hope you don’t look particularly appetizing when it passes by.”

“I’m willing to make a bargain-”

“You want to give me your firstborn?” she asked, sharply cutting me off.  “This is a ‘firstborn child’ level of favor.”

“Nevermind, no bargain, got it.”

Okay I mean I have given like zero thought to having children but that’s the kind of bargain you DO NOT MAKE.  Full stop.  Because I feel like even if you never change your mind and remain firmly in the childfree zone, fate will still find a way to screw you over by taking like, I don’t know, the first dog you adopt instead.  This is the kind of bargain that will break your heart, one way or another.  That’s how it’s supposed to work.

“Good, because I don’t want your firstborn.  Nasty things, babies.  All those disposable diapers and flushable wet wipes and other such nonsense.”

It crossed my mind that she might actually prefer cloth diapers and burp cloths because that means more laundry to do, but also that’s a terrible thought to contemplate so I’m just going to bury it in the back of my head.  There’s a lot stored there these days.  I’m sure that won’t be a problem.

There was one more thing I could try.  It was time to be clever.

“The thing in the hallway is *really* active though,” I said, trying to sound casual.  “At this rate, it’s going to be the most feared thing on campus.  Might put a damper on your whole plans to take over.”

She froze.  Her eyes darted towards the silent dryers.  I could almost see the gears spinning in her head.

“Maybe I misspoke earlier,” I continued.  “We don’t have to stop it or kill it.  Maybe we just need to make it… a little less threatening.”

To both the students and her aspirations.  Slowly, reluctantly, she said that she’d think about it.  Then she turned her back to me and stalked over to a washing machine that had just finished its spin cycle.  We were done talking.  This was going to have to be good enough.  The idea was planted in her mind.  Maybe the club president was right in keeping me from being directly involved in this, but I was going to do whatever I could to get them an edge.

So that catches us up to last night, when I was jolted out of a deep sleep by the sound of something crashing around in the living room, followed by Titanosaur tearing across my bed, squealing and hissing.  I froze as an obese cat rocketed across my body, claws fully extended and ripping at the bedsheet, only stopping when he bodily hit the wall, hard enough to shake it, and fell down the gap to hide somewhere under the bed.  My room was silent again.

The commotion in the living room was on-going, however.

Something large was crashing around.  I could hear the thud of it hitting the wall and then the coffee table.  Then silence.

I was frozen in place.  I couldn’t move a muscle, not even to reach for my phone.  There’s terror like confronting a monster and then there’s the terror of being woken in the night, in your own house, and not knowing what is happening.  I couldn’t discern where sleep ended and reality began.  It was like being trapped in a nightmare, but the pounding of my heart told me that this time it was real and there would be no waking up.

The door to my bedroom creaked open.  The streetlight shone through my window just enough to illuminate a tall, slender body and thin, dangling fingers.

The forgetter was in our house.

And stuck on one foot was a box.

The devil-box.

I guess that explains the racket in the living room.

Its gaze locked on me.  It made a sound, its throat bulging as it did, but its mouth did not open. A trilling sort of noise, like the call of a wild animal, one to another.  Its entire body went still, the devil-box still stuck on its foot forgotten about, and it took a step towards me.  The front of its chest cavity rippled, like a pond disturbed by a stone.  Its head was slung low and its hands… its hands were pulled back, tucked just past the waist, the long fingers extended away from me.

It had been stalking me for too long.  It wasn’t after my memories anymore.  We were way past that point.

And Grayson wasn’t here to tell it to stop, Grayson was too busy, Grayson *didn’t care anymore* because he was graduating and he was going to leave all of this behind but *I* was still here and *I* had to deal with it all-

I wanted to sink under the covers and cry, overwhelmed by everything I was carrying.  Could I get the window open in time?  That thing was jammed by at least five decades of layer of paint upon layer of paint.  I suppose I could join Titanosaur in hiding under the bed, for all the precious seconds that would give me.  I sunk lower into my bed, my breath coming in short gasps, because that thing was between me and the only feasible exit.

And the ripples were gaining definition, taking shape, into the ridges of a throat, glistening with moisture and rasping in anticipation.

Then Cassie burst into the room and she was carrying a baseball bat.

The creature whirled on her.  I saw her eyes widen with shock, focusing on the creature’s abdomen, and her raised arms paused, too startled to swing.

“It’s - it took-” I croaked, forcing my throat to work.  “It takes memories!”

Cassie’s face shifted.  It went from shock to fear to realization -

- the creature took a step towards her, the more immediate prey, not realizing what was happening -

- to anger.

And Cassie swung the baseball bat with an anguished scream, bringing it straight down onto the creature’s head.

“You took her!” Cassie screamed.  “I *loved* her and you took *all of that from me!*”

Another swing.  The creature reeled.  Stumbled, fumbling over the box that was certainly an intentional gift from the devil for this specific purpose, and went over backwards.  Cassie kept swinging, no longer watching what she was hitting but Cassie played softball in highschool and it didn’t matter that she was sobbing, because every strike connected with a wet, meaty impact.  And eventually it stopped moving and then so did she, holding the baseball bat limply between her fingers and staring at the ceiling.  Her shoulder shook with sobs.

At some point the creature’s body had split open and then fallen apart under the assault.  There was no blood, for which I was distantly grateful because I wasn’t sure if we would be able to clean that up well enough to get our deposit back.  It left behind a pile of desiccated tissue, as dry and thin as tissue paper, held together with a webbed lattice like the husk of a sponge.  We bagged it in a single garbage bag and threw it in the trash bin.

Then, in the very early hours of the morning, just before sunrise, Cassie and I sat down to talk about what had just happened.  She seemed to be in a daze.  I asked if her missing memories had come back with that creature dead.  They did not.  They were gone and she cried some more at that.  Then she asked if this was what it was like, when I killed the flickering man.

Yes.  I think it was.

“I guess we can be fucked up together, then,” she said with a bitter laugh.

I suppose we can.  Me, her… and everyone else that is going to start remembering the students that go missing now that the forgetter [is](https://alderrayne.com/) [gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/).
