I’m coming on here because I need to know if the same thing has ever happened to anyone else. If you or anyone you know has experienced the same happenings, talk to me. Please. 

Someone talk to me. 

The country roads in Scotland are pretty dangerous. The winding rural roads are pitch-black after sun-set. The hedges are serpentine through the fields. A labyrinth of packed mud and risky headlights. 

My brother Theo was in the passenger seat. We’d been at the pub for his birthday, and I’d only had one pint because I knew I had to drive us back. Theo, on the other hand, went all out. You don’t turn twenty one every day, after all. He was flush-faced and babbling, head pressed to the glass as he mumbled something nonsensical. I only hummed agreements to keep him satiated, and amused myself with how bad his hangover was going to be tomorrow.

I wasn’t expecting anyone out at this hour. It was one in the morning, in the middle of the country outside of Glasgow. Miles from the city, from the nearest pub or village. Why would anyone, or anything, be out?

I looked away from the road for only a moment, just to fiddle with the temperature dial on the dashboard because steam was beginning to curl at the edges of the windscreen. When I looked back up, a shadowed figure had lurched onto the road.

And what are you even supposed to do in that scenario?

I could not hit the breaks. I would not make it in time, and Theo wasn't wearing a seatbelt. He would’ve gone flying into the glass screen, and I did not and still refuse to entertain that idea. I could not swerve — I did not know what lay in waiting behind the thick snarls of hedgerow that lined the road. I slammed into the thing — person? At first I thought it was a cow, but it was too tall, too thin — and it bolted against the bonnet and went flying into the road.

My car’s brakes squealed to a stop. 

I sat with Theo in shocked silence before my adrenaline finally started clawing through me. I threw on the handbrake and stared in shock out at the dark road. I’d never so much as scratched my car’s paint job before. The animal is a dark lump, having been thrown halfway across the mud track. 

They’re illuminated by the yellow headlights of my ma’s old Peugeot, curled in on itself. Its fur was blanched sterile in the flood of light so I still could not make out what it was. A creature of some kind, that was for sure. 

But it was too wide to be a deer, with too many legs for a human. It was uncannily still. Not like it was unconscious. Once I watched a predator bird feign a limp to get close to a passerine and snap it up when it wasn’t looking. This suddenly reminded me of that: an animal not injured, but pretending to be. It was too still, its breath so slow I had to consciously look for the rise-fall of its stomach, the skin round and bloated. 

My hands were shaking with leftover adrenaline. I fumbled for my seatbelt, swallowing against a constricting throat, and reached for the door. The night air was a slap to the face. The air I sucked in didn’t feel like it was reaching my throat, and I realised I was taking short, shallow gasps. 

Some hindbrain instinct of mine wanted to linger by the car, but my curiosity drove me forwards. I stepped around the bonnet, my legs creating long, dark shadows over the white bathe of headlight. 

That’s when the thing twitched. 

It started to move. And not in the usual sense. There was no shift of limbs or the rearing of a head, or even a half-delirious scarper into the nearby cover. That’s what usually happened when you came face to face with a prey animal, right? When the flight instinct finally overrode the freeze instinct and it bolted?

Why wasn’t this thing running? And why was it beginning to move underneath its own skin? The texture beneath its thin, gleaming hide was raggedly, like broken bones. This bumpy texture began to move and squirm, bloating in darting lumps beneath the skin.

It let out a sound — somewhere between a whine and a bleet. It was pitched high and needy, and needled its way into my brain. 

It did not sound pained. It sounded like a baby. An infant. I was so stunned that it took me off-guard. I paused my wary observation of the thing, my heart jumpstarting at the idea that I had actually hit a child somehow.

"Hello?" I called, to no answer. I tried to take in what I was seeing. Tried to look for the child. I took a step forward, trying to piece together the disconnect between my ears and eyes. Where was the baby?

"Lucas?" Then my brother got out of the car. I heard him more than saw him — I didn’t dare look away. The click of his car door as it opened was as loud as thunder. “What’s happening?” he croaked. “Did you hit a deer?”

I felt utterly frozen. Like my body cut all communication with my mind, and no matter how much my brain screamed for me to run, I was immobilized in terror. My breath billowed like fog, backlit by my car lights.

At the sound of Theo’s voice, the infantile wailing choked off. There was silence. The black mass of the animal — if we can even call it that —- shifted, and it reared some huge body part up in the dark.

Then, illuminated in the floodlights, I saw the whites of the eyes of a crazed thing. They gleamed alabaster. Below those eyes, though I could not form the outlines or the shape of a mouth or nose in that cluster of fur and shifting flesh, I saw whetted, drool-slick teeth.

“That’s not a fucking deer,” I choked out. It wasn't a baby, either. When I decided to move, it was in a sudden burst of movement. I darted round the bonnet as fast as I could, feeling my trainers slip unsteadily in the mud. My car door was still open, leaking warmth, and I threw myself back into it and slammed the door shut behind me. 

Theo was getting back in. I grabbed his wrist and pulled him almost on top of me in my haste to get him inside the car and away from the creature. Then I pulled up the handbrake and floored it. The creature was halfway up on mangled legs, shaking like a newborn foal and swivelling towards us. 

I ran it over a second time. My tires skidded against the gravel and I kept my foot, although shaking, tight over the acceleration. It was an awful thing. I could feel the car bump over it, first over the front tires, then the back ones. I could recognise the soft give of an animal’s body, the snap of bones beneath the machine I drove. 

Guilt licked against my chest but I didn’t stop. I shifted the car into reverse and backed over it again. Only when it was back in my yellow headlights, and I saw teeth and eyes and too many legs, I drove it over one final time before skidding around the corner and away.

It’s a wonder I didn’t bin the car that night. It’s a wonder Theo and I actually got home safe. Afterwards, I did not sleep. I stayed in the living room with the lights on and I waited. Waited for the thing — a half-deer, half-cow, half-whatever-prey-it-took-the-form-of — to come back.

It didn’t, thankfully. Or if it has, it's gotten better at mimicking.

The thing I hate the most, though, is the crying. It was not hurt. It was trying to tempt me closer, like a venus fly trap, trying to catch me in a web to devour. What would I have done without Theo? What was that thing?

I've read stuff about fungus taking over the bodies of insects to control and hollow out from the inside. Maybe it was something like that, stretching and morphing the sinew and flesh of a poor animal, rewriting its organs.

God, I feel sick just typing this out. It's been plaguing me for the better part of a week. I needed to get it off my chest.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? In Scotland specifically, but anywhere else in the world works too. I heard the Scottish highlands used to be connected to the Appalachia in the times of Pangea, so maybe some of the organisms scuttling around over there stuck around in Scotland. I dread to think. 

I won’t be driving at night for a long time after this.
