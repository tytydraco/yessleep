Growing up, I always heard the same warning:

“Don’t go out late, it’s not safe.”
Especially if you’re a girl.

I heard it from my parents, aunties, even older girls in the neighborhood. And they weren’t joking. They said it like they knew something.
They’d say:

 “Being outside too late is already bad. But being a girl? It makes it worse.”

They never really explained what “worse” meant.
Sometimes it sounded like crime. Other times… something else.
But I listened. I stayed in. I wasn’t trying to find out what they meant.

Then I left home for university.

Everything felt different.
Here, people went out late all the time. Like it was normal.
Girls, guys — they’d go clubbing, partying, walking the streets at midnight like it was nothing.

Nothing bad seemed to happen.

I started to think maybe all those warnings were just fear talking.
Old habits from people who grew up in different times.
So when my friends invited me to celebrate after exams a night out, just to relax I said yes.

That night still haunts me.

There were five of us: me, Rina, Amina, Jo, and Feyi.
We didn’t even go far  just a lounge near campus. We danced a little, ate, took pictures, laughed. It was the first time in weeks we felt light.

We left around 2AM. It was late. We knew. But we weren’t drunk or careless just tired and ready to go back.

That’s when we noticed them.

At first, it didn’t seem like anything. Just three guys walking behind us. The street was mostly empty, so we could hear everything except… we didn’t hear them. No footsteps. No voices. Just… presence.

Rina glanced back and slowed her steps.
“Guys,” she said quietly, “don’t panic. But I think those guys are following us.”

We brushed it off.
“They’re probably just going our way.”
But when we turned right… so did they.

We crossed the street. They crossed too.

Now we were panicking, even if no one said it out loud.
We walked faster. Then started to jog.
We turned down a shortcut alley to lose them.

That’s when we saw two more men at the other end.

They weren’t moving. Just standing.
One of them had his head tilted back like he was sniffing the air.

That’s when it clicked.

This wasn’t just “guys being creepy.”
This was something else.

We turned to run back and the original three were already at the entrance of the alley.
Still silent. Still watching.

Then one of them raised his hand.
He had something long and shiny. It wasn’t a knife. It looked like a saw.

I’ve never screamed that loud in my life.
We all did — screaming, begging, calling for help.

And then, out of nowhere 

“Hey! What’s going on there?!”

A flashlight. A voice. A man in a police uniform walked up.
We ran to him, shaking, sobbing, explaining. But when we turned to point at the men…

They were gone.

Not walking away. Not hiding.
Just gone.

The officer didn’t seem to believe us. Said we probably imagined it, or that maybe someone was trying to mess with us.
But he gave us a ride back to campus.

He told us, again:

 “This is why it’s not safe to be out late.”

That should’ve been the end of it.
But it wasn’t.

When I got back to my hostel, Rina stayed over in my room because we were too scared to sleep alone.
We locked the door. Blocked it with a chair.
I closed my curtain, but not fully just enough to peek out.

And I swear on everything…

They were there.

Three figures. Right across the street.
Standing still. Watching.

Not moving. Not saying anything. Just… watching.

I called Rina over. She saw them too.
We shut the curtain, turned on the lights, and sat up till morning.

The next day, we all met up and talked.
Every single one of us saw them that night.
From our different rooms. Different buildings.

They were outside.
Watching.

We made a silent agreement after that.
No more going out late. No matter what.

Even now, if it’s getting dark and I’m walking home, I feel it.
That prickly feeling in the back of my neck.
Like I’m being followed.

Like I’m being watched.

I should’ve listened.

They were right.
