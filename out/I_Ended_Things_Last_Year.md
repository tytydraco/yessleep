I am not a danger to myself. 

I want you to understand that going in because I want you to trust that when I say I should be dead it's not a cry for help. It was once, but that was before everything got better. I also want to apologize if this isn't written well. I've never been the writing type. Using words like this is new to me. Which might be why I didn't talk to anyone after everything with Dr. Hall. But you can't trust doctors. Everytime my aunt took me in because I had "an episode" he would say the same thing when I woke up. At least once a week for as long as I can remember it was the same. Waking up to the hot lamp over my head. The dry scratching in my throat. The throbbing in my head. And having to sit up to see that look on aunt Carol's face. That look like I was going to jump off of the table at her. She was always so distant after the appointments. I know she was mad at me. She hated me but wouldn't ever say it. She resented that my dad died and she had to take care of me. But I was ten when it happened and all I remembered from the accident were the police carrying me outside. I never saw his body. Aunt Carol said he was creamated, but I never saw the vase either. It's was probably too hard for her to have around after losing her only brother. She would never admit to anyone that he killed himself. Whenever someone would say "your son" she was so quick to correct them. 

She would tell them my parents died in a car accident. Which is almost true. My mother was hit by a drunk driver when I was 2. But she wasn't driving. The driver crossed 4 lanes of road and had hit her on the sidewalk. She was pushing me in a stroller a mile from home when it happened. Sometimes I think I can hear the crack of cement as the car carries my mother through the side of the building. The smell of the burnt rubber and the sour reek of the gasoline that spilled out of the wreckage. The steaming engine. All just a few feet behind me. It was 11 at night and no one saw the accident for three more hours. I sat there in that stroller for three hours before the ambulance came. I know this because my dad would tell me all about it when he drank. He wasn't ever mean when he drank but that sadness was always there. That guilt. He would never look at me. 

The medicine never worked. Dr. Hall always said to "Take it one day at a time", like I had any other choice than to take it one day at a time. Stupid. The clear grey capsules I had to take for the next 8 years would always get caught on the back of my tongue. All I would taste for the rest of the day was dirt and copper. And still. Every day I could feel the sky digging its long fingers over my shoulders. Trying the push me into the ground. Crushing out all the air in my lungs. Going to school and seeing other kids laugh and smile and feel something other than that scraping on the back of their forehead. That feeling that no one else seems to feel. Like there's too much pressure behind their eyes and they just need to come out. 

I moved out on my 18th birthday. My friend Jacobs dad is a foreman for the shipyard in our town and he got me steady work. Hard work. The kind that keeps your thoughts from wondering. And I stopped losing time for a while. I never told aunt Carol where I was going. I packed the few things I needed into a duffel bag and left while she was at work. I tried to keep going to school since it was my senior year, but between work, trying to avoid covid, and sleeping at bus stops I couldn't keep up with the homework and stopped going altogether. Jacobs dad saw me sleeping outside of this Chinese food joint that closed down a few months ago after a shift one night. He let me sleep in their pool house for two months and then helped me get an apartment.  He was a really nice guy. I wish things could have been different for him. He was so sweet. As much as he tried to be friendly and tell me how "Reliable" I was and, "Such a better work ethic than Jacob" I had. I don't think he likes having me around. He never made eye contact with me. Just like everyone else I guess. 

Things were okay for a while. I hadn't been to Dr. Hall in 4 months and I was living in my own studio apartment. Sure it was just a used mattress on the floor and a coffee maker but it was mine. And I was alone. For the first time I was really alone. And when I realized that, just how alone I was, it suddenly felt like I wasn't. 

From my bed in the middle of my apartment you can see all four corners of the unit except the bathroom. And with the ceiling light on you can see ever spot in every corner of the empty apartment. But it wasn't empty. I could feel eyes on me. It was like when you look across a busy restaurant and lock eyes with a stranger. And you had felt them staring at you. That tense stare. That tense hungry stare. I would lay in my bed with the light on staring at my phone and feel it. From the corner of my vision I would see those hungry eyes behind the wall. I could feel whatever it was trying to slip it's long boney arms through the paint and claw it's way to me. My mind would paint these terrible pictures. A hand split down the middle with too many fingers on either side. All of them a crooked and broken. And a face with too many expression. Those eyes with two pupils, swollen in their sockets. It's jaw, too wide, distended with extra teeth pushing out from its bleeding gums. Like it's baby teeth never fell out and the rotting black mollars just pushed them to the side. Hours could go by and I would just be laying there in my bed. Staring at the white fucking wall and imagining this thing. This thing I would draw as a kid. The thing I would describe to aunt Carol before she started taking me to Dr. Hall. This thing that wasn't fucking real. This thing that wanted out of me. 

Things started to blur for a little bit. It felt like I just blinked and suddenly two more months had gone by. My apartment was a mess. Flies had started making a home in the half eaten gas station got dogs I left in the corner by the door. I kept telling myself I would take the trash out but looking around I could see the yellow and black stains on the molding carpet. I had let things get really bad. At some point I had stopped going to work. The police stopped coming to my door thankfully. I had let them in once after the third or forth time my next door neighbors called in a noise complaint. I got tired of them waking me up in the middle of the night asking about a man screaming in my apartment. They came in, looked around my empty studio apartment and stopped bothering me finally. I just wanted to sleep. If I was asleep I didn't have to be lucid enough to feel how sore my throat was. How dry the air felt all the time. How swollen my stomach has become. I had put on a lot of weight and it hurt. It felt like my guts were trying to tear an opening to escape. But I couldn't remember eating. I would see food wrappers on the floor but I didn't remember going to the store.

Then Dr. Hall came over. I think he used the key I made him because I don't remember opening the door to let him in. He was sitting against the wall across from my bed. We were talking about something important I'm sure but I can't for the life of me remember what. I think he wanted me to take the pills again. I think he wanted to get me out of there. To get me help. To get Aunt Carol out of my bathtub. He was so sweet. So much sweeter than I remember. He smiled up and he tried so hard to say something I didn't care about. I wish I could have cared but he had lied to me for so long. I remember feeling angry. It was such a nice feeling. To feel something. And he was so sweet. So warm and wet. He was so alive then. I could feel his heart beating on my fingertips under his ribcage. 

I took off my skin that night. My head so clearthe air outside tastes so fresh. Do you remember the cold air on your tongue after brushing your teeth. It's been like that every day. I finally tore my way through that distended gut and could breath for the first time. I left that rotting fleshy sack at that apartment. And the world and everyone in it has been so sweet ever since.
