A middle-aged man sat behind the wheel of his car; his eyes fixated on the raindrops dancing on the windshield. Sighing, he turned his gaze toward his reflection in the rearview mirror, taking in his chiseled features, slightly worn with age and experience. There was a subtle air of refinement about him, as though he was no stranger to luxury, but the world's harsh realities had also humbled him. His once jet-black hair was now peppered with distinguished streaks of silver. Weary yet piercing blue eyes held a small glimmer of determination that sparkled, declaring that he still had something to prove to the world. His dark suit was immaculate, the satin red tie that encircled his neck slightly loosened after a long day at work.  
  
The rain relentlessly pummeled the pavement of the deserted afternoon streets, and the man finally decided to cut the engine. In his haste to exit the vehicle, his opulent leather shoes sank into a puddle of rainwater on one side and dug into a harsh gravel bed on the other. Irritated, he shook off his soaked foot and locked his car, confidently striding towards the door adorned with a flickering neon sign that read “The 12th Layer”.  
  
Pushing open the heavy, creaking door, a musty smell assailed his senses. The bar was shrouded in darkness. A few feeble lamps flickered intermittently, and typical neon bar signs cast eerie shadows on the peeling walls. The air was heavy with the scent of cigarette smoke, and his shoes stuck to the floor, the surface covered in some viscous substance he cared neither to acknowledge nor identify. The ceiling above him sagged in some places, as tired as the bar patrons. Grime coated the establishment’s windows, making it impossible to see inside or see the world outside. The isolation within its walls was intense for somewhere meant to be a meeting place.  
  
Despite the warning signs, the man's curiosity shoved them to the back of his mind. The promise of a reprieve from his troubles lured him deeper into the smoky, dank realm. Entirely within the belly of the beast, his eyes adapted to the lack of light, and he took notice of the bar’s patrons for the first time. They were a motley crew, looking like they’d lived many lives. Something unpleasant prickled at the back of his consciousness, a warning he ignored, and he pressed on like a moth inexplicably drawn to a flame.  
  
The man slowly lowered himself onto the plush cushion of an empty barstool, feeling the weight of the day bearing down on him. He carefully removed his suit jacket, revealing a dress shirt that was slightly wrinkled. With a heavy sigh, he placed the blazer on the back of the stool, loosening his tie to half-mast and rolling up his sleeves, revealing the topography of veins that ran across the back of his forearms.  
  
Glancing around the bar again, a voice whispered in his mind that coming here was a mistake and that he should turn back and retreat to the safety of his usual watering hole.. A cacophony of insistent whispers overwhelmed and silenced the first with their sibilance, keeping him rooted to the spot.  
  
  
As the rain continued to pound against the filthy windows and the sound of thunder rumbled in the distance, a bartender appeared behind the counter. Her gaze captured his, her presence effortlessly commanding attention. Dark brown hair fell in loose waves around her face, framing features that were striking in their beauty. Fathomless, almond-shaped eyes drew his gaze, holding him captive with an otherworldly intensity. A neutral smirk graced her full lips, adding to the enigmatic aura that surrounded her.  
  
"Which unspoken, unfulfilled desire led you to my door?" Her words slithered out like a serpent, enticing and dangerous. The man's eyes flickered with momentary confusion, brows furrowed, uncertain how to respond. He quickly shrugged off the oddity of the question, chalking it up to playful banter.   
  
His eyes were drawn to her alluring figure, the curve of the bartender’s waist as she leaned over the counter of the bar, dragging him in like a maelstrom. Her form-fitting black dress accentuated her long, lean limbs and an hourglass figure that could have stopped traffic. Every body curve was in perfect proportion, from her slender waist to her shapely hips. Smooth, flawless skin, the rich, honeyed amber hue glowed in the bar's dim light. The fabric of her black dress stretched over sensual, imposing curves with every movement. Raw sexuality dripped from her pores, alluring and unsettling. The man was captivated by her undeniable beauty but unnerved by something about her he couldn’t entirely focus on.  
  
Pulse-pounding, heart in his throat, a mixture of fear and desire coursed through his veins. Studying her intently, alarm bells rang through every fiber of his being. No matter how gorgeous she may have been, he knew something sinister was coiled beneath the pretty surface, poised to strike.  
  
He had bigger things to worry about than a beautiful woman. He forced himself to tamp down the sudden emotional turmoil that left him flustered like a teenager.   
  
"Just a whiskey, splash of coke," he replied, his voice coarse and exhausted.  
  
The bartender's movements were precise, skillful, and practiced as she finished pouring the man his drink, her every gesture somehow suggestive. With a slow and deliberate push, she slid the glass towards him across the hardwood surface, the liquid inside shimmering in the flickering, inconstant light.   
  
The bartender leaned into his space, and he got a subtle waft of her perfume, the scent stirring a primal desire within him. The heat of her breath on his neck sent a shiver of anticipation down his spine, the sultry tone of her whisper laced with pleasure and danger in equal measures.  
  
“Here you go," she purred, her words carrying an unspoken promise of something more.  A commitment to fulfill the darkest, most depraved desires he had lurking in the inky shadows of his subconscious.  
  
His mind was clouded, his thoughts swirling in a bottomless void as he gazed from the dangerously low cut of her dress to the amber elixir that sat patiently before him.  He felt that the alcohol held a hidden power, beckoning him towards an uncertain fate with its irresistible siren’s song.  
  
His eyes fixated on the swirling liquid within as he brought the glass to his lips. Once the amber liquid touched his tongue, it was as if he had been transported to another world. The burn was immediate, and he craved more of the agonizing sensation. The fiery liquid scorched his soul, purging him of all his fears and anxieties while offering a strangely unsettling and intoxicating comfort.  
  
The taste lingered on his tongue, filling his senses with a heady mix of flavors that seemed to swirl and dance before his eyes. The man couldn't help but feel a sense of unease creeping up on him as he had just stumbled into something forbidden. But the allure of the whiskey was too strong to resist, and he took another sip, allowing the burn to spread through him once more, and he felt himself becoming more and more lost in the dark and mysterious world of this bar.  
  
The man finished his first few sips, and the bartender's eyes shimmered with an otherworldly glow. Her movements were fluid and graceful but in an unnatural way.  
  
"This is damn good," he said, trying to ignore the strange sensations flowing through him.  
  
The bartender returned his compliment with an alluring smile, her lips curling up subtly. "I take pride in my craft," she replied, pouring herself a drink with practiced ease.  
  
“How long have you been a bartender?" he asked, his voice soft but curious.  
  
The bartender's eyes cast downward and darkened momentarily, her smile fading into a pleasant but blank expression. "Long enough," she replied cryptically, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her glass. "Why do you ask?"  
  
The man shrugged, the pangs of unease in his gut growing. "Just curious, I guess. You seem like you've been doing this for a while."  
  
The bartender's lips curled into a sly smirk, her eyes glittering with a strange light.  
  
"I've been around the block a few times," she said, her voice low and laced with an almost imperceptible menacing growl. "But you seem to be looking for more than just idle conversation. What's really on your mind?"  
  
The man hesitated, unsure of how to answer. The bartender probed him, searching for something he wanted to keep hidden beneath the surface.   
  
"Just...life stuff, I guess," he muttered, hoping to steer the conversation away from his troubles.  
  
But the bartender wasn't easily deterred. "Life stuff can be pretty heavy," she offered sympathy and understanding pouring from her lips and seeking to coax the truth from his tongue, leaving space for him to open up.   
  
The man's voice was rough, his words laced with hesitation and doubt. "Yeah, but we've all got troubles, you know? I don't want to bore you or take you away from your job," he said, his eyes shifting away from her gaze.  
  
The bartender's response was smooth and controlled, her words sliding along his skin like silk. "It's just the afternoon crowd. Only a handful of regulars come in this time of day. They're all busy complaining about the country's state or retelling the same old story for the fiftieth time. That leaves me bored and with plenty of time on my hands," she said, that mild, maddening upturn of the corner of her lips audible in her tone. "I don't mind sitting and talking with you. After all, that's what I'm here for. To help you feel better, in one way or another."  
  
The way she spoke was both youthful and ancient, as if she had lived a thousand lifetimes but still retained the innocence of youth. Her voice rippled with secrets and ageless mysteries the man felt no other had bore witness to. He felt that she held the answers to all of his problems, and her animal magnetism held him captive.  
  
The bartender's words hung in the air like a cryptic message, coaxing him to spill his secrets and inner turmoil. His mind raced with the implications that dripped from her tone, but he dared not let his thoughts wander too far down that path. The way she looked at him had him intrigued, but the gleam of something dangerous in her eyes made him equally uneasy.  
  
The sound of ice clinking against glass filled the air as the bartender mixed another drink, snapping the man back to the present moment.  
  
"I've been in this line of work for quite some time now," she began, her voice soft but low and velvety, a stark contrast to the raucous sounds of the bar. "But I've come to learn that people don't just come here for the drinks."  
  
The man was taken aback by her statement, unsure of what she meant. As he watched her step out from behind the bar, he noticed how she moved with an effortless predatory grace, as if she were gliding across the floor. When she sat down beside him, he felt a chill run down his spine.  
  
He tried to brush off the feeling of unease and maintain his composure. But as she continued to speak, he felt out of sorts, like the bartender didn’t belong in this world.  
  
"I don’t think anyone gets into slinging drinks if they don’t have a touch of therapist in their personality. This place may seem like just another dingy dive bar to most, but it has a way of making you feel comfortable. Of giving you exactly what you desire," she said, her voice almost a whisper as she took a slow sip of her drink and lit a cigarette.  
  
As the lighter sparked to life, the man's attention was drawn to the bartender's eyes. At first, they appeared wholly pitch black as a starless night sky, but as the flame flickered out, they returned to their natural deep brown hue. The man stared transfixed for a moment, wondering if what he had seen was real or just a trick of the light. Unable to come to a conclusion, he pushed the thought aside and focused on the bartender's words as she spoke again.  
  
"Michael, tell me... what is it that you desire most? A fresh start, perhaps?" Her question hung in the smoky air, thick with the same seductive undertone that had permeated their entire conversation.   
Michael's mind raced as he tried to rationalize the bartender's ability to know his name when he’d never offered it to her. "There's no way she just knew it," he thought, skepticism taking over and a spike of fear jolting through him. "It's gotta be a lucky guess, or maybe she saw it when I handed over my credit card." There was something else going on, some secret game he wasn’t privy to, but he tried to convince himself that it was just his imagination.  
  
Quickly scanning over the other patrons, he noticed that they all seemed to be caught up in their own worlds, oblivious to the bartender's charms.  
  
"Maybe this is just a typical server con," he thought to himself, reassuring himself that he wasn't falling for her manipulation. "She hopes I'll leave her a nice tip, that's all." His instincts told him that there was something more to the bartender’s motives, and he wasn’t sure how much longer he could push that sensation aside.  
Michael's next words hung heavy in the air, thick with a palpable sense of longing and melancholy. "Don't we all harbor secret desires to hit the reset button, Miss...?" he trailed off, his overly eager gaze fixed on the bartender with a wistful yearning.  
  
"Lilli," she replied, her voice carrying an enigmatic depth that belied the casualness of her tone. "It's true; we all long for a chance to wipe the slate clean, to start anew. But, would you really let the Devil take the lead in that dance?"  
  
As she spoke, the hair on the back of his neck stood on end with a sense of foreboding.  
  
Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Michael began to speak, his words constricted and thick with emotion. "My life is unraveling," he confessed, his hands gripping the glass so tightly that his knuckles turned white. "My wife is leaving me, and I feel like I'm losing my grip on everything. My kids... they're distant and angry with me for reasons I can't fathom. And the worst part is, I did everything right! I followed the script that society gave me and checked off all the boxes of what it means to be successful. I worked hard, climbed the corporate ladder, and now I'm the head of my department. I gave my family everything they could ever need: a beautiful home, the best schools, and all the material things money can buy. Sure… I’m not the best husband or father of the year, but I do my damndest to provide for them. I thought that was enough. But it isn’t. None of it is. Now, I feel like I'm left with nothing. Like I've been abandoned by those closest to me. And even by God himself."  
  
As he spoke, the air around him grew heavy with ominous energy, the clinking of glasses and murmur of conversation fading into the ether. A veil had been lifted, revealing the dark underbelly of the facade that Michael had so carefully constructed. The weight of his words hung heavily in the air, leaving behind a tangible feeling of discomfort.  
Michael’s thoughts were in turmoil as he grappled with the weight of his troubles.  Sensing his unease, Lilli drew closer to him, dark eyes locked on his with unwavering intensity. A hint of apprehension fought to break her hold on him, but her alluring voice–smooth as butter–compelled him to listen only to her.  
  
Her hand settled on his thigh with a gentle warmth, her voice soft like cotton. “You’re feeling lost, Michael. But you have nothing to fear. It’s alright to let go.” He gazed into the depths of her eyes, idly thinking he’d be content to drown in them. “You have a great deal of untapped potential, so many valuable things you can still contribute.  What you need is someone who sincerely supports your desires and can help you find the path you’re meant to travel on, Michael. I can help you break the hold your past has on you so you can move into your destined future.”  
  
Michael's body tensed, his mind struggling to wrap around the meaning behind her words. He couldn’t deny that he was attracted to Lilli. Yet, as he cast his gaze downwards towards his banded finger, clasping the glass, he was reminded of the wife he still loved. She had willingly walked away from him and all of their years together, but he was hesitant to cast her out of his heart.   
  
She was the love of his life, the mother of his children. Yet, as fleetingly as these contemplations infiltrated his subconscious, a contrasting inner monologue chastised him, growing in volume and confidence. The voice resonated with ominous authority, serving as a stark reminder to Michael that it was his wife who had willingly abandoned the sanctity of their home. It was she who brought their relationship to a close. Michael…she hates you. You deserve to be with someone who will fulfill your soul’s deepest desire.  
  
Lilli leaned in closer, the heat from her nearness thrumming along his skin. "I know that this is not an easy decision for you, Michael," she said. "But sometimes, we must let go of that which no longer serves us in order to grow and evolve. You deserve to be with someone who will fulfill your deepest desires and help you become the best version of yourself."  
  
"Who are you?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.  
  
A smile crept onto Lilli's face, and her lips curled into a mischievous, toothy grin that chilled Michael to the marrow of his bones. "A friend with your best interests at heart," she replied, the grimace fading back to a relaxed smile so fast he wondered if he had imagined it. "Someone who understands what you're going through. A woman who understands the depths of your pain and wants to help you get through it."  
  
Michael stared at her, disbelief and confusion, warring for control of his expression. Her words echoed through his mind as he tried to make sense of the situation. How could she possibly understand his pain and struggles? What could she possibly offer him that he didn't already have? He’d only just met her, yet she spoke like she’d known him intimately for decades. Michael's bright blue gaze remained fixed on Lilli, his eyes searching for any hint of deception but finding none. With a deep breath, Michael finally spoke. 

"Okay," he began, his voice thready and unsure. "What do I need to do?"

Lilli's full lips spread to flash a hint of perfect white teeth as her grin widened. Her hand slid slightly higher up his thigh, and she leaned her weight more fully upon it. "Put your trust in me, Michael," she said. "Trust that I know what's best for you. I can guide you to where you need to be if you allow it. And in return, I promise you'll be granted everything you've been searching for. The things your soul has been crying out for, if only you would listen to its desperate pleading."  
  
Michael's heartbeat stuttered as he pondered her words. Should he really trust this woman? What did she want from him? What would she get out of this? The questions swirled in the circling drain of his mind, disappearing finally under a wave of mixed excitement and apprehension.  
  
Giving his thigh a squeeze through his slacks, her breath was warm on his cheek. Lilli’s voice was laced with heat as she asked, "You’re ready for a refill, aren’t you?" and pushed the glass she had been holding toward him.   
  
“I already have a–!” Michael gazed down in bewilderment as he came to the realization that his glass was indeed empty. It appeared to have been sitting vacant for so long that the ice had melted. Michael was perplexed. He couldn't remember drinking more than a few sips from the glass, which he was certain had been full just a short while ago.   
  
As he raised the fresh glass provided by Lilli to his mouth, he observed that the liquid was transparent but had both a bluish tint and a delicate aroma. Initially, he detected a subtle fragrance of lilies, which he found ironic, but then he was hit with the unmistakably cloying odor of gasoline, reminiscent of a motorcycle on a hot summer day.   
  
Michael lifted the glass to his lips, hesitating for a moment before taking a long swallow. As the liquid flowed down his gullet, he was hit with an intense rush of pleasure that set fire to every cell in his body. His entire being quivered with pleasure, and it was as if he had just been overwhelmed with the most soul-shattering climax of his life. Never before had he felt this total sensation of being whole, sated, utterly and unabashedly content.   
  
After a few short moments, the sensation began to fade, and Michael was hit with a wave of despair that washed over him. It was a feeling of profound emptiness as if something precious had been taken from him that he could never get back. He tried to shake it off, but the desolate feeling lingered, clinging to him like a shadow.  
  
Lilli took a drag, the cherry of the cigarette glowing brightly before she exhaled the smoke directly into his face. Coughing and waving the cloud away, Michael's emotions dissipated, leaving him confused and disoriented. It felt like Lilli's smoke had the power to control his emotions, to manipulate his innermost desires and fears. Michael leaned back on his stool, feeling violated, powerless, and unable to explain what the hell had just happened.  
  
At that moment, Michael considered leaving the rest of the drink untouched, walking off, leaving the bar, and driving away from this whole odd experience. But the memory of the intense pleasure he had just experienced was too enticing, and he found himself taking another sip and then another.  
  
As he drank, Michael felt himself slipping further and further into a world of darkness and uncertainty, a world where pleasure and pain were two sides of the same coin and where nothing was as it seemed.  
  
Michael was lost in a haze of emotions that seemed to stretch on for years. His mind was consumed with sensations of ecstasy and dread, pleasure and pain. He felt trapped in a never-ending dream, unable to escape.   
  
As suddenly as it had started, Lilli blew another puff of smoke into his face, and Michael was yanked back to a sobering reality. The world around him snapped back into focus, and he realized with a jolt how long he had been lost in his own mind. He looked at Lilli, and he was overcome with fear and mistrust.  
  
Michael's mind felt fried and crispy while also pliable and shapeless like gelatin. He had just experienced a time distortion that defied explanation. How long had his thoughts held him prisoner? Several hours? Days? He scanned the bar, studying every person's face, looking for some clue, some indication of what had happened. That someone else had experienced the anomaly, too. But there was nothing unusual or otherworldly about them. Every person who was there prior to his fall down the rabbit hole was still present.   
  
Thoughts racing, Michael tried to make sense of what he had just gone through. He felt like he had been in a dream, but the vividness and intensity of the emotions he had experienced were unlike anything he had ever felt before. Hastily pulling his phone from his pocket, he discovered that the time was 3:57 pm. As he replayed the events in his head, he recalled glancing at the time on his car's dashboard when he arrived, which read 3:29 pm. That meant a mere 28 minutes had elapsed since he first set foot inside The 12th Layer. “How is that possible?” he murmured.  
  
"Michael, what you just experienced is completely natural," she began, her voice low and sultry. Her words were calm and reassuring like he was a wild animal about to bolt if he couldn’t be brought to heel. "This depth of emotion is something you’ve been searching for your entire life, even if you couldn’t put a name to it before. And I can make sure you never have to stop feeling that all-encompassing ecstasy."  
  
Michael stared at her in disbelief, struggling to comprehend what she was saying with his fried and jellied grey matter. "What do you mean?" He hated the way his voice trembled, but he needed answers.  
  
Lilli’s hands shot out, pulling Michael into uncomfortable proximity by the loops of his pants. "I'm showing you everything you've ever wanted, Michael—everything you could want to fill the aching emptiness in your heart. But there's still more I can offer you," she murmured.  
  
As Michael let Lilli's words sink in, a peculiar feeling that was a cross between dread and exhilaration washed over him. His curiosity was piqued, and he’d never experienced anything like this before. He might not get another opportunity and was afraid to waste this one.  
  
"What more can you offer me?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.  
  
Lilli took another drag from her cigarette, her lips curling around it suggestively as she inhaled deeply. "You'll have to come with me to find out,” she said with a wink, her tone cryptic. Her eyes glittered with an emotion he couldn’t pinpoint as she continued, “That is what you desire. What you've been longing for? Fulfillment, acknowledgement… Satisfaction?"  
  
“Yes.”   
  
Michael's response was immediate and impulsive, driven by a powerful wave of desire. At that moment, he couldn't recall anything about his mundane life; his responsibilities, his wife, and his children were pushed to the back of his mind.   
  
All he could think about was Lilli. Her presence was addictive, a forbidden temptation that consumed his thoughts and his senses. Without her, he felt incomplete, as though he would surely wither away into nothingness.   
  
The desire to be with her consumed him. He wanted everything she had, everything she was offering, and that still didn’t feel like enough. Lili’s hands held the key to a new world, a world that he never could have dreamed of. Michael was captivated by her. He knew that he would follow her to the ends of the Earth and beyond, even if it meant losing himself completely.  
  
Michael's heart thudded in his chest as he held Lilli closer, hands pressed to the small of her back, his lips near enough to hers that he ached for a taste. But just as he was about to lose himself in her kissable mouth, she suddenly retreated, leaving him bewildered and vexed.   
  
Without a word, Lilli gracefully hopped off her bar stool and offered Michael her upturned hand. He stared at it, fascinated and uncertain until her fingers wiggled enticingly, and he slid his fingers between hers.   
  
Not missing a beat, her grip tightened on him, and she led him towards a crimson door situated at the back of the dimly lit bar - an entrance that he had failed to notice before. As they weaved their way through the crowd of patrons, Michael's senses fixated on the roughness of Lilli's hand. Her palms and fingers were lined with well-worn calluses, giving him the impression that she had spent countless years engaged in hard labor. It wasn’t unpleasant, but it was difficult to ignore the coarse calluses sliding against the smoothness of his own skin.  
  
As they walked, Michael's gaze lingered on the other customers. Initially, they appeared as ordinary as any person one might expect to see in a bar, but the longer he observed them, the more wrong they appeared. They were silent. Not a single sound came from them despite their mouths moving and their hands gesturing animatedly.   
  
He peered into their eyes and noticed that they were a deep, glossy black devoid of any semblance of life or warmth. Even their sclera were filled with inky emptiness. The skin of their faces appeared worn and aged, sunken and sallow, like they were wearing old latex Halloween masks. Due to the dim lighting and distance from them, he hadn’t noticed those details until he’d gotten closer to them. Insides roiling with disgust, Michael genuinely wanted to leave.   
  
As they finally reached the red door, Lilli paused and turned to face him, like she could sense his apprehension. Leaning her back against the door, she gazed up at him with her mesmerizing large, dark eyes. Her pouty lips were inviting, and her words echoed that invitation, her pose open and welcoming. "Don't be afraid, Michael. These people are seekers, just like you and me. Searching for something more…No need to be shy. You don’t strike me as the type to leave a lady wanting.”  
  
She opened the heavy door, and he followed her through the aperture, the latch shutting behind them with a sense of finality that made his blood run cold. Swallowing audibly, Michael shook his head, a measure of his confidence returning. He certainly was not.  
  
Their footsteps echoed in the stone hallway, passing closed doors on either side. Fluorescent lights stuttered where they hung from chains on the industrial ceiling. Michael knew that this hallway went farther than the length of the bar should have allowed for, but glancing down and watching the sashay of Lilli’s hips as her stiletto heels clacked on the concrete floor, his concern dissipated quickly.  
  
How long had it taken them to reach the door at the end of the hallway? How many doors had they bypassed on their way here? The answers hovered at the edge of his consciousness, but they were just out of reach. It is too unimportant for him to grab at them and make them tangible.  
  
A symbol perched just above the doorknob, a simple icon of two black wings. Lilli lifted their joined hands, pressing his palm against the symbol. Devastating desire flooded through Michael, his slacks suddenly uncomfortably tight as he instantly hardened.  
  
Grazing her free hand over the front of his slacks, a devilish chuckle rolled from Lilli’s lips as she noticed the falter in his steps. She gazed up at him from under dark lashes, dragging the corner of her full lower lip between her teeth, then pulling him into the room with her.  
  
It could have been any other bedroom, the flickering candles filling the air with the heady scent of lilies and a strange sensation of heat that prickled along his skin. Windowless, the air would have been stale if it weren’t for the multitude of small flames that made the plain walls dance with shadows.   
  
“Nuh-uh,” Lilli cooed, grabbing his face in her hands and giving him the kiss he’d been craving earlier. Her hands slid to tangle in his hair, crushing her lips to his with a fervor that was unexpected. “No running off in that brain of yours, Michael. You’re here. Now. With me.” Her words were borderline breathless, hovering just over his mouth.   
  
Wrapping his red tie around her fist, she used it like a leash to lead him to the bed that beckoned to them from the center of the room. Her fingers deftly undid the buttons on his rumpled dress shirt, hands slipping beneath the fabric to glide across his chest and down his torso with a reverence that gave Michael pause.  
  
He was in decent shape, but he wasn’t a young man anymore. For such a gorgeous woman to be so pleased merely by touching his body made him feel seen in a way he hadn’t in years. Decades, even. Intimacy with his wife had petered off to nothing years ago.  
  
His wife…  
  
He hadn’t even noticed when Lilli had unbuckled his belt and unzipped his pants. He was firmly rooted in the present as her teeth scraped against his ear, her warm breath tickling his skin. “Head empty, Michael. No other thoughts. Focus on me.” Squeeze. “Focus on us.”  
  
She gripped his chin in her free hand, a throaty chuckle bubbling from her lips. His eyelids fluttered, and he exhaled heavily, but he fought to keep his eyes on her despite the way the movements of her fingers were shutting down entire sectors of neurons in his brain.  
  
“Much better, Michael,” she practically purred...pleased with his reaction.
