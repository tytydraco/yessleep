This happened a  week ago, and honestly I've not been able to sleep comfortably ever since this experience.

For context, I have 3 older siblings and a younger one- the sister I'm discussing is the third eldest. She never really "fit in" with the rest of my family- she was always considered the black sheep, never got along properly with any of us and had frequent arguements and shouting matches with out family; she's reserved and quiet in nature, and I guess our family ( not  me) has picked on her because of it; for example she'd be lectured and yelled at for not speaking to us or enough or not trying to;  she has a distant relationship with my mother in comparison to all of us and mainly just wants to be left alone. This isn't a new thing- the distance in relationship, the shouting matches, her being reserved and in her room alone. She was always labelled as, you could say, "the crazy one." One of my siblings said that she needs to be put in a mental institution or get checked in to therapy because of "anger issues" when an argument was occuring; sometimes my family calls her sociopathic because she can seem blunt and cold, one time my mother said she didn't trust her with her credit cards (TO HER FACE) and when she came out with a kitchen knife when making something, my mother said what are you doing with that? (as if she was going to stab us.)

Leading up to this night, she seemed rough and tired from school and more quiet than usual. I vividly remember her digging in the cutlery drawer for something when we were all having dinner- this is the night that it had happened. 

I heard creaking downstairs - I sleep at the top bedroom with one of my eldest siblings, so if someone is moving around enough downstairs I'm able to hear them. At this time, it's 1AM and completely dark; I'm up watching a show and I'm able to hear movement downstairs; I find this odd because at this point, everyone is asleep. I think nothing of it. 10 minutes later, I hurriedly put away my phone because I can hear creaking up my stairs, and i think it's someone coming to check if I'm sleeping or not, even though this has never been done in my family before .

I see the door open ( to understand the situation better, I'm going to briefly describe my room. My bed is directly facing my door, and as soon as step in my room, there's a window, followed by another one.)
I was pretending to be asleep, but peeking up from my blanket. 
I swear, it still shakes me to my core. She was just standing there, watching me and my other older sibling as we were sleeping. It must've been five minutes, her silhouette just stood in the same position, completely unmoving. At this point, i could feel her stare at me, even from under the covers and I couldn't see her eyes. Why was she doing this? Why was she there? Surely if she wanted to check up on me it must've only taken 20 seconds and she would've left.

For the five minutes she was stood in silence, these were my thoughts. Then I swear I saw it. I don't know what it was, but it was an object in her hand- a knife I'm guessing. From the window I described earlier, I could just make out the shape of what she was holding. It was grey, and glinting from the faint light outside, and she was gripping the end of it. From where she was stood, I couldn't fully make it out, but I'm 100% sure it was a knife. My heart was racing like crazy. What was she doing with a knife??! She was trying to harm us?? All these thoughts were going through my mind, but she suddenly moved slowly from her position and advanced towards me.
I immediately jolted up and said "_____, what are you doing?"
She seemed to snap out almost, and she didn't answer me for arleast 10 seconds. The "knife" wasn't raised, it was still by her side, but I still couldn't fully make out the object.
She sounded nervous, almost guilty when she answered me.
"Nothing. Just checking up on you. Go to bed. It's late."
She RAN for my door and closed it.

Nothing has changed. I still think about it. What if I wasn't watching that show? Would she have killed me? She's still the same. She acts like she's done nothing, maybe she didn't intend to so anything, but I've noticed she's been increasingly nice to me nowadays. I wonder why.
