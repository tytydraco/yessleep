My wife has been missing for over a week. 

My wife's name is Bailey. We been married for 12 years, We have 2 children, Tristan & Tucker.
Tucker just turned 11. Tristan's 16.

I don't know how to start this without sounding insane. But after being betrayed by both my parents and my own coworkers, I fear this is my last resort.

For starters: 
I’m a cop - have been for a little over eight years. Last Wednesday, I was stuck working late, helping detectives follow up on an incident that happened during patrol. 
I was still at the station when my son Tristan called me. His voice was shaky, confused. He asked about a note he found on the kitchen table

“My hands wrote this but I didn’t. If I smile at you but my eyes don’t follow. You’ll know. God, I hope you’ll know”

/Bails.

I chuckled after hearing Tristan say “Bails”, I hadn’t heard that nickname for Bailey since we were seniors back in 2003.

Tristan asks

“Where’s mom, what does she mean, She’s not answering her phone as well?”

*He reads the note again loud and clear*

“My hands wrote this but I didn’t, If I smile at you but my eyes don’t follow. You’ll know. God I hope you’ll know.”

His words were followed up by short breaths, indicating panic.

I reassured him that it was probably Tucker messing with him and that’d Bailey probably had gotten stuck in traffic or gone over to a friends house unannounced.

I ended the call a few moments later with
“I’ll be home in ten. Love you, bud.”
I walked out the station and quickly got into my car, I turn the key and start the engine.

The whole drive home I kept thinking about that weird note.

“My hands wrote this but I didn’t”

A thousand possible questions popped into my head.

What could Bailey have meant?
Was this even Bailey?
Was she forced to write this? Is that what she meant by ”My hands wrote this but I didn’t”?

I shake off the confused, slightly paranoid look on my face once I realise I’m only a few blocks away from home, I quietly repeat to myself that it’s probably Tucker messing around, that he’d probably seen some scary movie and wanted to play a prank on us. I pulled into the driveway and saw almost all the lights off except for two.

The first one I noticed was the one in the hallway, Maybe indicating that Bailey had returned home? 

Although her car was NOT in the driveway. 

The second one is why I’m sitting here today writing about this.

The second light turned on was the one in our upstairs hallway, the one Bailey always left on when the boys were scared or. When she was.

That light hadn’t been on in years.

That uneasy feeling I had went away some minutes ago after reassuring myself enough. 
But it quickly returned and was a hundred times stronger now, I’m gonna be completely honest, it almost made me barf.

I decide to as my dad would like to call it “Man up” and I begin to get out of my car and walk up to the front door, reminding myself quietly that I have two children in there. 

I step on the porch and began searching in my pockets for my keys, 

“Ah, Found them. “I mumbled to myself.

I unlocked the door and walked into the fairly lit hallway, I took my shoes off, walked into the kitchen

I saw the note that Bailey had left, sitting there on the kitchen counter for me, A part of me wanted it to be a prank but it sure didn’t feel like it.

I reread the note again, trying to find any flaws in her handwriting,

 I couldn’t find any. 

I decided to leave the kitchen and go and try to unwind on the couch, because I knew there wasn’t much the police could do, She had only been “missing” for a couple of hours, at most maybe 5. 

Then it hit me, Bailey always has her phone, She shares her LOCATION with me on her phone. 

I went on my phone, unlock it and pressed on the 
“Find my app”

**LOCATION DISABLED**

“F*ck, F*ck”. I knew I had to do something. 

Right as I’m brainstorming what I should do, Tucker walks down the stairs.

I tried to play it of cool by saying something like 

“Hey buddy you hungry?”

But he saw right thru me and asked why I was being so weird. Just as I was going to tell him about why i was acting “Weird”, 

Tristan walks down the stairs. And I decided not to, Why? You may ask, I wanted to spare him the panic and trauma. even though all odds are against it being a prank, I still wanted to believe that sooner or later she would come through that door with the biggest smile on her face and having a logical explanation of her disappearance.

 I told Tucker that I was just stressed about work and that

 “Mom (Bailey) was just sleeping at a friends house for a few nights”

Shockingly Tucker believed it and went to go brush his teeth.

As Tucker left the room and went up the stairs it was just me and Tristan.

I told him about baileys location being disabled and he told me that he had tried to call her multiple times, but with no answer.

This didn’t help at all so whatever or whoever abducted my wife had this planned out.

Could she have ran away?
Who or what took her?
Will she be back?
If she comes back is it really her?


It is now in the night, more so 3:17 AM. These unanswered questions won’t leave my head, and now they’re stuck in yours too.
