My eyes fluttered open from a dreamless sleep, and I stared up into a blackness that was as empty as a starless sky. My breath stung my lungs and felt heavy as I drew it in, as though I were trying to suck the air from a wine bottle. A sheen of sweat slicked across my skin.

Blinking into the blackness, I tried to remember where I was and when I had gone to sleep. My throat still ached, and the crackle in my cough reminded me that I had been ill. It had started as a tickle in my throat and spread into a dry cough. My skin had gone clammy, and a nagging ache in my bones fought against every movement. But I had refused to stop working, despite feeling under the weather that morning. The fever had crept in throughout the day, slow and merciless.

And then I remembered the sudden faintness that had washed over me. The room had begun to spin, and I had toppled over. With no one else in the building, there had been no sense in crying for help.

I blinked again into the utter blackness. Was this my sewing room? No, the sewing room had windows that overlooked the streets. I should have been able to see the glow from the lamps outside. This darkness was like nothing I had ever known.

Every bone in my body ached, defying movement, screaming for a breath of cool, fresh air. 

I lifted my hand a few inches and jumped at the soft thunk of my knuckles striking something hard. My other hand met the same resistance. I kicked out my feet.

thud, thud

More unyielding surface. Something was across the top of me. Was I under a table?

I turned my head left, then right, blinking blindly against the nothingness. To my sides, I heard the echo of my own labored breathing bounce back at me.

The air was damp, clinging to my lungs, feeding my cough. My ears rang from the silence, and the faint pounding of my heart filled the cramped space. Walls pressed against my sides, a solid surface pinned me from above. A sick realization crept through me as I accepted the horrifying truth.

I was in a coffin.

I tried to raise my fists to pound against the lid, but my arms couldn’t fit between my chest and the wood. They stayed locked at my sides, adding to the unbearable claustrophobia. Panic flared in my chest. My boots lashed out wildly. A whimper slipped from my lips, rising into a shriek of terror and rage.

My nails dug into the wood above me, clawing frantically. I felt them peel back, hot pain tearing through my fingertips. Blood trickled down my wrists, soaking my sleeves, making the coffin’s lid slick. I thrashed, slamming my head against the top as I twisted, desperate to free at least one hand. The slickness of my own blood gave way and I managed to slide my right hand upward along my chest until it pressed above my head.

Now one hand lay pinned above me, the other trapped at my side. My lungs ached, each cough a violent spasm that heaved my chest upward. The force thrust my arm farther back until my shoulder snapped out of its socket. I screamed, the rawness of my throat tearing open with agony. Fire consumed my shoulder, my fingertips buzzing as if electricity raced through them. I tried to yank my arm back down, but it dangled uselessly above me in a grotesque mock salute. My free arm spasmed helplessly at my side, desperate to help.

I gasped shallowly, choking on the dense air. It felt less like suffocating and more like drowning. Sweat soaked through my clothes and plastered my skin. 

I made one last, pitiful attempt to force the shoulder back into place, twisting against the coffin’s side. My teeth clamped into my lip as pain ripped through me, but the joint refused to snap back. I screamed again. Blood welled in my mouth, metallic and bitter, puddling on my tongue.

Tears streamed down my face and mingled with blood in the darkness.

“Help me,” I croaked, my voice weak, my strength unraveling. The darkness shifted before my eyes, like the mouth of a deep well yawning open beneath me. I felt myself leaning into it, tipping forward as though my body were weightless. My stomach lurched, my feet seemed to rise, and I plunged.

I fell endlessly, hair twisting like snakes against my face. The abyss pulled me deeper, directionless, merciless. I opened my mouth to scream again but instead it filled with the stale, suffocating air, thick as fog, choking me. My body convulsed, froth bubbling at my lips. My eyes stared unblinking into the void, desperate for a glimpse of light at the bottom of this endless well.

Somewhere in my mind, I imagined the splash when I struck the water waiting below. I told myself it would be cool, soothing against my fevered flesh. It would wake me. It would save me. I thrashed harder, my forehead banging the coffin lid above.

And then I smiled. I felt it.

A cool drop slid down my face. Relief surged through me as I waited for the flood of well water to wash over me. But it never came. Instead, the bead of hot blood began running down into my eye, pooling until it spilled over my cheek and clogged my ear. 

But by then, I barely felt it.

My shallow breaths stilled. 

My bleeding fingers fell open limply. My boots splayed outward, tapping softly against the coffin walls. My eyes, sticky with blood, remained open.

They would stay open, expectant, until the coffin was opened again the next day.

And though I would never taste the cool air again, my tombstone would be engraved with a warning. Or, some whispered, a curse:

“The people shall be troubled at midnight and pass away.”
