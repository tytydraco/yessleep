Hi. First of all, today I’m here to tell you something that happened to me a long time ago — so long ago that the memories are blurry. It happened 8 years ago, I was 10 at the time. Like always, I went to my grandma’s house for the summer. My grandfather had passed away about 3 years before that.

Anyway, let’s get to the story.

My grandma’s house was big, with a faded kind of luxury. My parents said it was built in 1879 — old, you know? Well, at the beginning of summer everything was normal. Even though it was summer, time felt like it had stopped in that village. The summers were cold, mostly cloudy, and the sun didn’t feel very warm.

The first few weeks were peaceful, but one night, right in the middle of it, I got up to get a glass of water. My phone had died, so I plugged it in to charge. As I walked down the stairs, I started hearing a murmur — it was getting louder. At first, I thought it was the TV or the radio. My grandma was a bit deaf, and she usually fell asleep around 10:00 p.m.

When I reached the main hallway, I heard it clearly: the piano. That old piano in the living room — the same one I once tried to play, and it didn’t even make a sound. I started walking, guided by the sweet notes of the piano, step by step, as if I were being pulled toward it.

When I was almost at the doorway, I suddenly remembered the glass of water. I changed direction and went to the kitchen instead. I drank, filled the glass again, and walked out. I could still hear the piano playing, so I decided to check it out. I had never seen my grandma show much interest in music.

I walked into the living room. My grandma was asleep and the TV was on. The piano music was louder than the TV. I turned to see who was playing... and there was no one there. The glass slipped from my hand. And in the time it took for that glass to fall and break, time slowed down. The music stopped. The keys were still pressed, the notes fading away.

Then the glass shattered, and time snapped back to normal — along with the music, reaching its final climax. It was intense, furious, relentless... and then fast again.

My body reacted on its own — I ran. When I got to the stairs and started going up, I realized my grandma was standing there. I tried to go back, but my body wouldn’t listen. It took me straight to my room. And when I got there, I saw the **same** glass of water on the nightstand — full.

My body shut the door.

Morning came. I left the room, went down to the kitchen, and saw my grandma making breakfast. I asked her about what had happened the night before — and about the glass.

"Grandma, what happened last night? The piano was playing by itself, the glass broke… and then when I got to my room, the broken glass was there but whole again."

She replied:

"Sweetheart, that’s the ghost of the house. Every night he plays like he used to when he lived here. I took care of him, and one day he died. He left me the house as inheritance. But when you show him you don’t like the song... he punishes you."

The rest of the summer went by with the piano as the soundtrack of the house. Until one day, I found out my girlfriend had cheated on me. That night, I heard the piano again. I went downstairs to the bathroom, but I made a bad face — a gesture. My grandma wasn’t home that night; she was at a 24-hour café with some friends.

The house started burning. I ran and ran. Fire flooded the way out, and as always, the piano played its furious climax. I could hear the fire trucks in the distance, but the melody never left my head. That year, my grandma died.

The last time I passed by that village, you could still see the ruins of the house. My family says that if you go at the right time, deep within the ruins, you can still hear music coming from under the ground.

Since then, at 10:30 p.m., wherever I am — even in another country or at the far end of the world — I hear that classical music. But not like other sounds, no — I hear it inside my head. And if there’s a piano nearby at night, I can see the keys moving, and the melody flowing from it.

I guess... because I was the last one to see him.
