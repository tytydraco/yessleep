[The Hunger Grass Situation Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/v7IIHyf6Pj)

There was a Post-It note on my desk in Deirdre’s handwriting. Bless her. She must've had some inclination that I'd be making a mad dash back. Thankfully, the address she'd written down wasn't far. After downing some Excedrin and a glass of water, I was on my way. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

If anyone was curious, *yes,* I was an anxious wreck during the drive. There was a lot weighing on my mind, one of those thoughts being the possibility of Wes getting himself killed. I didn't believe for a moment that Iolo would take my words to heart. He'd do what he wanted. I just had to have faith that the vampire knew what he had gotten himself into. 

On another note, a smarter person may have recognized that after having something as substantial as the second sight bestowed upon them, they should go home and try to figure out how to deal with such a huge change. Unfortunately, I had neither the time nor the patience to be smart. And in case I haven't made it clear enough, self-care is *not* my strong suit. 

I spotted Reyna's Monte Carlo in the driveway of the address on the Post-It. Silently, I hoped that I'd be walking in to good news. However, when Deirdre answered the door, her face told me *that* was out of the question. 

“Reyna's tried so many different mixtures,” She whispered grimly. “We have yet to find one that works.”

The one they were trying now contained rice coffee, as well as the leaves and bark of a plant called ‘fragrant manjack.’ The Hunger Grass victim was slumped over his kitchen table, sipping at the concoction while Reyna observed him with wide, worrying eyes. The farmhand was a big man, though given the sallow cast to his skin, his strength was starting to wane. 

Then I saw his shadow stretching along the ground. Gaunt. Skeletal. 

*What the hell?!*

“Anything?” Reyna asked the farmhand. 

“Could use some sugar.” He mumbled, his lukewarm joke falling flat with how fatigued he sounded. 

When he noticed me, I introduced myself to him as another Orion employee, hoping that my unease at his shadow's appearance wasn't too obvious. It didn't help that Deirdre was searching my face. Reyna also knew me well enough to recognize that something was wrong. 

The farmhand didn't seem to notice, understandably too preoccupied with his own dilemma. He kept sipping at the rice coffee, eyes and face blank. 

While Reyna tended to him, Deirdre ushered me back into the farmhand’s hallway. “What happened?”

Deirdre’s shadow. It was strange, too. It rippled as if it were underwater. The edges of it were fuzzy. What did that mean?

When she caught me staring at it, she understood instantly, “Dà shealladh. Who gave it to you?”

“It was the Hungry Man’s idea of a gift,” I explained quietly, forcing myself to tear my gaze away from her waving silhouette. “He told me to use it well.”

Deirdre’s lovely gray eyes were as gentle as her palm against my cheek, then she suddenly frowned. “You’re feverish.”

I didn’t doubt it. The room certainly felt far too warm. The chill of her palm was refreshing. 

“Good for me,” I said absent-mindedly, then feeling somewhat unhinged, informed her, “His shadow is all wrong. It’s all emaciated. I don’t think whateve you’re trying is working… or if anything is going to work, for that matter.”

“I know what sights you’re being haunted with all too well,” Deirdre replied with a sad smile. “So allow me to assure you that fate is not sealed in stone. We change it and shape it like dough.”

I then hurriedly informed her that Wes was keeping the mechanic busy. Buying us time to shape this farmhand’s fate, preferably into something more favorable than what was showing behind him on his dining room wall. When asked, I told her that Wes’ shadow had been normal before I left him. According to her, that was a good sign. If his silhouette had been missing a head, however, that would be another story.

I’ll admit that having the second sight scares me, even with Deirdre here to help me navigate it. It’s often been said that humans weren’t meant to be able to glimpse behind the veil; that’s why it’s there to begin with. An opaque boundary between the world of the atypical and ours. Certain things are best left unknown.

Another glimpse at the man’s silhouette confirmed that the tincture still wasn’t working. The remains of other unsuccessful treatments lined the counter. Goodness gracious. 

Thus came the discussion of how to proceed. Unfortunately, I did not have much to contribute, given my lack of knowledge on the matter (and fever-related fatigue). Mostly, I sat on the couch, waiting for one of them to give me instructions. 

“I do know of one ritual performed by the Druids, but, truthfully, it may be a bit far-fetched,” Deirdre had said in a hushed tone. “It was mainly used to treat infertility and poisoning.”

Reyna’s brow furrowed, “But mistletoe is poisonous.”

“With the way that the Druids prepared it, it was safe for human consumption in small doses.” Deirdre explained. “However, that preparation is arduous.”

Running a hand through her hair nervously, Reyna reasoned, “Broadly speaking, curses are a kind of spiritual poison, so… it could work. What’s the ritual.”

It is as follows: two white bulls are tied together at the horns beneath a patch of mistletoe growing on an oak tree. Someone clothed in all white must then climb the tree and cut the mistletoe off with a golden sickle. The mistletoe must then be caught in a white sheet and not be permitted to touch the ground under *any* circumstances. Afterwards, the two bulls are sacrificed. 

“That’s quite a shopping list.” I commented unsurely.

“As I said, it’s far-fetched,” Deirdre agreed. “I’m not even certain if there’s mistletoe in this area.”

“There is,” I informed them. Then, not wanting to throw Vic under the bus, I told a little white lie. “We spotted some on the night of the Mare incident.” 

Reyna nodded gravely, “Okay. That’s one thing accounted for. A golden sickle and two white bulls are a pretty tall order, especially on short notice, but a lot of these things are symbolic. Hypothetically, if we can recreate the symbolism correctly, it *could* still work.”

They went back and forth for a while, using their combined knowledge to find meaningful substitutions for each missing piece. 

From what I gathered, the bull in Druidic culture personified strength and potency, hence why they were so valuable in a ritual intended to treat infertility and poisoning. White is often attributed to cleanliness or purity, which is possibly the same reason why whoever cuts down the mistletoe will have to also be clad in it. Ordinarily, white bulls wouldn’t be too difficult to come across, but given recent events, cows are in short supply around here lately.

Similarly, rams represent strength and were utilized in fertility rituals. Since white rams are a lot less difficult to come across, and as far as we knew, haven't had their population decimated by cursed Grass, that was a strong possibility. Snakes were also brought up, since they’re associated with healing, but they agreed that the rams seemed to be more suitable. 

“There is a sheep farm out towards the highway,” Reyna supplied. “It’s the same one that let us use one of their lambs for Samhain, so hopefully they’ll be willing to help us out again.”

As for the sickle, gold, like other precious metals used by ancient Celts, is believed to have purification properties. That’s why it was so effective for fending off the Dullahan on Samhain. The metal appears to be more important than the tool itself; so as long as we used a tool made out of either gold, silver, or platinum, it should suffice. 

“So our silver knives should work?” I asked.

“If our logic is sound, then yes,” Reyna confirmed. 

Finally. Something I could help with. 

I rose from my seat, trying to pretend like my head wasn't swimming, “Since I have the truck, I can take care of the sacrifices. I imagine the bed should be able to hold two full-grown rams, but I guess we'll find out.”

Both of them looked worried. 

“Are you sure you're up for this, Nessa?” Reyna questioned, eyeballing me as if expecting me to keel over dead any second. 

Did I really look that bad?

“Admittedly, I'm not feeling the best, but I can still function.” I assured them. “Besides, I've done crazier things while feeling worse.”

Deirdre gave me a weird look, “That is not comforting in the slightest.”

Reyna did not help. “Like the time you snuck out of your bathroom window to make your girlfriend read a book to ruin Psycho Mantis’s life?”

“Yeah! Like that!”

Deirdre balked, “You snuck out of a *window* to get to me? With *pneumonia?*”

“Uh, yeah, Briar was kinda camped outside of my front door,” I said sheepishly. “Also, we should get moving.”

“I'll stay with the client,” Reyna offered. “See if I can keep him as calm and comfortable as possible. Maybe I'll try to get the vitamin D deficient king to answer his phone, when I have a chance.”

With our last ditch attempt to fix the Grass sickness plotted out, Deirdre and I were en route to the sheep farm. The Excedrin was starting to help with the headache, thankfully. Once again, Deirdre tried to convince me to go home and rest, but me being the ‘stubborn mule’ that I am, I refused, determined to see this out. This is ‘Murica, we ignore illness here. 

Everything was going alright, for the most part. I’d called ahead to the farm and they had a couple of rams that they could part with. Between Samhain and this experimental treatment, they’ve made some good money off of Orion. I’m just grateful that we have somewhere that’s actually willing to work with us. It can’t be easy.

The trouble came when we reached the crossroads. 

It was snowing pretty hard, thanks to the polar vortex. When I saw the writhing figures waiting for us by the stop sign, I slammed on the breaks, almost causing us to spin out. Normally, I know better than to do that on slushy roads while it’s below freezing, but if yinz could’ve seen what I did, you’d understand why I was shaking by the time the truck finally came to a stop.

For starters, we need to stop calling them ‘snow people;’ before I could *really* see them, some appeared to have humanoid figures. But now that the veil was lifted, I could see that some bore a shape more similar to fleshy coffins, which gives the impression of a head and shoulders as the snow rushes past. A round, wide, pink mouth was in their centers, pulsating and ravenous as the black ‘lips,’ for lack of a better term, flexed and unflexed in time with my frantic heartbeat. 

The others were tangles of wriggling, tubal appendages that reminded me far too much of a bundle of black, meaty worms. What appeared to be lobster claws could occasionally be glimpsed in those strange snow figures. Even though I can’t confirm it, I’m fairly confident that one of these delightful worm balls was responsible for messing up the truck that one time.

In the past, snow figures were just a nuisance. A dangerous nuisance, granted, but pests nonetheless. Now that I could see them, I am ashamed to admit I was somewhat petrified, for a moment. Even though the snow figures didn’t have eyes, from what I could see, I knew that they were waiting for the truck to get closer. 

“They’re exactly the same as they’ve always been,” Deirdre soothed me, her fingertips stroking the back of my hand comfortingly. “You can beat them with fire, same as before.”

I gave myself a small shake in an attempt to snap myself out of it. Deirdre was right. They hadn’t changed. They were still just snow figures. Heat drives them off. And if I could get the truck through the intersection quickly enough, I wouldn’t have to worry about confronting them. 

After a swallow and a deep breath, I started off accelerating slowly, not wanting to skid again. The last thing we needed was an accident. Time was of the essence. We’d already wasted enough. Once the truck felt as if it had traction, I pushed it further.

Even though seeing the snow figures’ true forms was a shock to my system, it did make avoiding them easier than ever. As the truck soared through the crossroads, I noted that the coffin-shaped ones couldn’t move around very well. The worm balls, on the other hand, move fairly quickly, though they take unsteady, loping strides. Their claws snapped at the truck. I grit my teeth as one managed to nick the passenger side mirror, causing Deirdre to jump.

We lost that mirror, but as far as damage goes, it’s minor. I wasn’t able to breathe easily until the crossroads was far in my rearview mirror. 

“We’re taking the long way around on the way back.” I swore, willing the trembling in my hands to stop.

Equally as shaken up, Deirdre nodded quickly as she gaped at where the side mirror had once been, “I think that would be best.”

To my relief, the rest of our trip to the farm was uneventful save for some idiot cutting me off, then going ten miles under the speed limit because *why not?* 

The rams, thankfully, were agreeable as they were loaded up into the truck’s bed, then secured with rope. For the record, I always feel terrible whenever we have to resort to animal sacrifices, but if I have to choose between animals and people, I will always pick people. No matter how much I want to run them off the road sometimes. 

With the rams acquired, the next step was to perform the ritual and hope that our substitutions were acceptable. Before returning to the farmhand’s home, I stopped by my apartment to fetch a white sheet and every piece of white clothing that I owned, which admittedly wasn’t much. 

I ended up returning to the truck donning a white turtleneck that’s been in the back of my closet for God-knows-how-long, a pair of white skinny jeans that were left over from my extremely unfortunate days as a wannabe emo (I’m amazed that they still fit, by the way. Though they are a tad snug), and white cowboy boots from when my mother and I attended a bachelorette party in Nashville. 

In other words, I looked absolutely ridiculous. But the ritual called for color coordination, not haute couture.

When Reyna saw me upon our return to the farmhand’s home, she snorted, having to clap a hand over her mouth, quickly apologizing soon after. Even the farmhand did a double take. My milkshake was not bringing all the boys to the yard that evening. 

With that mild embarrassment out of the way, next was to get the supplies and find the tree that Victor had been referring to. I thought I knew which one it was, since there is an oak I pass by on my way to the mechanic’s clearing that’s hard to miss. It’s a pretty tree with a curved trunk and proud branches that reach to the sky as if to embrace it. Of course, it is a forest, so there was bound to be more than one. 

Speaking of the boss, Reyna wasn’t able to reach him either. That worried me. Of course, there was nothing that could be done about it at the moment. We just had to hold our breath and hope that everything was alright. 

We brought the farmhand along with us. For one, we wanted to be able to give him the experimental treatment as soon as possible. For another, we didn’t want to leave him alone in case the mechanic came looking for him. We just had to pray that no other victims of the grass would be targeted in the meantime.

On another note, I don’t understand how I wore skinny jeans so much as a young ‘un. They’re *so* uncomfortable. They weren’t flattering either. I promised myself that once the ritual was complete, those hellish jeans were going straight to a thrift store. 

The farmhand was a good sport as we wandered around, the rams being led along like dogs by their ropes while we looked for the mistletoe. In turn, I had taken the truck’s ladder with us, not keen on having to climb a tree in horrifically tight pants whilst feeling under the weather. 

After I couldn't feel my nose anymore from the chill in the air, we finally found it. Above our heads, one of the oak’s branches was being overwhelmed with parasitic mistletoe growth.

Working quickly and quietly, we secured the rams, then Reyna and Deirdre held the white sheet open underneath the branch, ready to catch the mistletoe when it was cut down. 

After all of the other preparations were complete, I got the ladder into position, finding that it was a tad too low, but determined that it should be close enough that I could get at least a few pieces off. Being tall has its perks sometimes.

I had to stand precariously on tiptoe on the top rung, but managed to get it with my silver knife. The newly-cut fronds fluttered gently down onto the white sheet while my colleagues were careful to not let a single one touch the ground. 

While I concentrated on this task, I could hear them discussing the next steps, and the one I was looking forward to the least: the slaughter. We had to pick a god to invoke. While Gwyn ap Nudd has an interest in Orion, I didn’t think he’d give a flying fuck about blessing an experimental concoction for a human he wasn’t interested in. That could easily backfire. 

Deirdre’s eyes suddenly became glazed in the same way as they do whenever she receives premonitions. Even more bizarrely, I saw a new addition to her shadow in the dim winter light: something was perched on her rippling shoulder. A bird? 

Reyna and I glanced at each other. Shakily, I descended the ladder, my arms aching from the effort. To tell the truth, I had begun to feel sore all over. And despite the frigid temperature, I was sweating profusely.

Once I'd dismounted the ladder, it was time to do the hard part. I faced the rams with the silver knife, a pit in my stomach and a lump in my throat as I steeled myself for what I was about to do. While in her trance, Deirdre spoke to me in Gaelic, having me repeat every word she said. I stumbled through it, noting that *Morrígan* was used in this invocation.  

When it comes to the sacrifice, I promise that I did my best to make it as painless for them as possible. But they screamed. They shrieked and their blood coated my hands, feeling hot as molten fire, the liquid steaming as it became exposed to the cold. The terrible white outfit became a splattered canvas.

Some of the blood was collected for the concoction. The rest coated the snow. I remember sending out a second prayer that these animals’ lives weren't taken in vain. 

Meanwhile, Reyna and Dierdre got to work. The shadow bird stayed on her shoulder the entire time, occasionally tilting its head or stretching its wings. Her eyes were still glazed and distant, though she was keeping up with Reyna flawlessly. 

During all of this, the farmhand was slumped against one of the trees, head hanging low. He hadn’t questioned anything so far. Due to his profession, he might’ve had his fair share of atypical experiences prior to his unfortunate encounter with the Hunger Grass. Like I've said in the past, the farm folk around here are a hardy bunch. 

Reyna abruptly halted her work, eyes huge, “Guys, my hagstone! Something's here!”

The mechanic’s voice came from nowhere, giving me a heart attack, “So this is what you were really up to?”

Iolo looked like something from a nightmare. He was covered in blood, though it didn’t appear to all be his. There was a bullet wound above his right eyebrow, as well as numerous in his chest. By the tightness of his jaw and the way his eyes blazed, it was clear that Wes had done his job a little too well. The mechanic was *livid.*

Whenever he was in this state, he was reactive. Dangerous. Now was *not* the time to try anything funny. 

The farmhand tried to scramble away from him. He made the mistake of meeting Iolo's eyes. I tried to step in between them to break the Huntsman's line of sight, but it was too late. 

The farmhand’s eyes rolled back in his head as he crumpled to the ground. Reyna let out a sound that was somewhere between a gasp and a scream. Deirdre still seemed out of it as she kept adding more mistletoe to the mixture.

As I rushed to him, it took everything I had to keep my tone as neutral as possible, “What did you-” 

“Don’t get all panicked, he’s fine,” Iolo snapped, cutting me off. “He just ain’t gonna remember shit.”

Reyna found her voice, though it came out as a terrified squeak, “Please just give us a minute.”

His smile wasn’t friendly, made even more menacing by the blood coating his cheeks. “Why, sure! I’m *dyin’* to see what you all cooked up.”

While he watched them, arms crossed, I did my best in my fatigue to drag the farmhand over to somewhere more comfortable. He was out cold. Probably for the best. 

In the end, I settled with leaning him against the oak’s trunk, unable to find anywhere that didn’t have snow for him to sit. Poor guy was going to be freezing when he woke up. But even if I didn't feel like my brain was being sawed in half, lifting him would be difficult. 

Once I got the farmhand situated, I marched over to the mechanic, breathlessly asking, “My colleague? Is he still alive?”

“I didn’t kill your coworker,” He replied curtly. “Just made him wish I did.”

I knew it was going to be bad. *Shit.*

“If I’d told you what we were doing, would you have stopped us?” I challenged softly.

“Probably,” Was his frustrating answer, but then he continued. “I get it. Ain't happy about it, but I get it. Same reason why I waited to tell y’all about how the bread crumb thing was bullshit.”

Truthfully, I'd expected that conversation to go worse. A lot worse. 

In the meantime, Reyna kept nervously glancing at him from the corner of her eye, which unfortunately, activated the banjo bastard’s prey drive. 

Smirking, he mocked her, “Somethin’ spookin' ya, witchdoctor?”

“Please leave her alone.” I urged, resisting the impulse to be more forceful. I didn't like that look in his eye. 

After that, Reyna kept her head down, mouth set firmly as she focused on her work. 

Still sounding strangely distant, Deirdre eventually announced that the mixture was done.

Iolo watched Reyna in a way that made me glad she was diligent about keeping her hagstone on her as she poured a few drops of the mistletoe concoction down into the unconscious farmhand’s mouth. Silently, I prayed that this would work. That we hadn’t just strung this poor man along, giving him false hope. That we hadn’t just led him right to his executioner. I stared at his shadow, willing it to match its owner. Willing it to stop reminding me so much of the Hungry Man.

*Please work. Please work.* 

The farmhand coughed. His silhouette began to change, filling out, resembling a balloon being inflated, as strange as that comparison might be. 

Still smirking, the mechanic told Reyna, “I s’pose I stand corrected.”

Her and I exchanged an astonished glance, then seemingly without thinking, she let out a soft sob of relief, having started crying from the stress of her situation. At a glance, Deirdre looked disoriented, as if she had just woken up. The strange bird on her silhouette’s shoulder was gone. 

“Well, that saves me time tonight,” The mechanic chirped, looking down at his gore-covered arms in disdain. “Now, if y’all will excuse me, I gotta get all this vamp blood offa me. No trainin’ tonight, by the way! I’ve had enough o’ you for one day.”

The feeling was mutual. *Good riddance, banjo bastard.*

To everyone’s relief, he departed just as quickly as he had appeared. The first thing I did was call Wes, knowing that whatever state he was in couldn’t be pleasant.

However, when he answered, he sounded more inconvenienced than anything else, “Yeah, I’m fine. Just gotta *pull myself together.* You know how it is.”

Well, if he was punning, he couldn’t be that bad off. However, the implications of that pun were gruesome.

“Wes, seriously.” 

“Yeah, it hurts, and your boyfriend is a dick, but I’ll be back to normal in about five more minutes. Just don’t come looking for me. I’m feeling a bit peckish after all of that.”

At the ‘boyfriend’ joke, I glared into the distance as I playfully threatened him, “You want me to go over there and finish what he started?”

There was a horrible crack. When asked, he nonchalantly replied, “I just had to put my arm back into its socket real quick. Hey, I’ll see you at work, alright?”

“Yeah. Okay. See you.” I replied numbly. 

Are all vampires like this or just ours? At least I knew he was okay. Relatively speaking.  

Now that I could be assured that my colleague wasn't lying dead in the snow somewhere, the next thing was to check on Deirdre. She had been aware of everything that was going on, but she was also attuned to something beyond the veil. That shadowy bird had acted as a guide, ensuring that the ritual would go the way it was supposed to. 

At the same time, the farmhand had woken up, not knowing why he was in the woods. The last thing that he recalled was drinking the rice coffee. At least the mechanic hadn't screwed with his memory too horribly. The poor guy was discombobulated, but let us lead him back to the truck without protest. 

Reyna and Deirdre made plans to locate and spread the treatment to the other victims of the Hunger Grass that were still alive, though they insisted that I wasn't going to be a part of it. 

“You. Need. *Rest!*” Deirdre told me firmly. 

I didn't have the energy to disagree with her anymore. 

That's part of the reason why it took me a day later than anticipated to update yinz: once they dropped me off at my apartment, I ripped off my terrible, too-tight clothes, washed the blood off of me, then went into what could be best described as a minor coma for twelve hours. By the time I finally returned to the land of the living, I numbly realized that I'd missed half a day of work. 

In a panic, I called Victor. 

I'm truly lucky to have such a good boss. “You're fine. Deirdre and Reyna filled me in on what happened. Ergo, I'm making you take tomorrow as well as the following two days off. Paid, of course.”

“Okay. Thanks.” My brain took a moment to catch up, but once it booted up like an old computer, I finally became cognizant enough to ask, “By the way, what the hell happened to you?”

After our talk the day before, Victor had determined that the best way to convince this real estate development company that they were dealing with more than just some townies’ campfire stories was to have one of them contend with an atypical infestation themselves. And if that chairperson didn't cooperate, then another would be targeted and so on until they finally got the point. 

Naturally, my jaw dropped. I could see why he’d thought I’d talk him out of it. He had resorted to using Charles Dickens tactics. 

Of course, he had to find a Neighbor to act as his Ghost of Real Estate Development Future. He determined that he needed an atypical pest that was frightening enough to spook the chairperson, but not cause them any physical harm. A tall order, considering how the Neighbors feel about this development company and human greed in general. Can't say I blame them. 

I can't stress enough that *nobody* wanted The Avalon to be built. Humans and Neighbors were united on that front. 

Victor's first thought had been Housekeepers. They're pretty standard, as far as atypical infestations go, and to those not accustomed to their presence, they can be alarming to encounter. However, transformations cause them to become violent and unstable, which is a liability. 

Dreamers wouldn't have been ideal either. It'd be too easy for someone to rationalize an attack from one of them as a nightmare or the result of sleep paralysis-induced hallucinations. 

Lastly, the False Tree would probably kill the chairperson on sight if it figured out that he was one of the humans responsible for the construction in its territory. So, what did that leave? 

The answer floored me: a Wild Huntsman. Namely, a certain [thorny boi](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/1OYaFXSnfE). 

“At first, a Huntsman - particularly *that* Huntsman - was last on my list of potential collaborators.” Victor had explained. “But as far as Neighbors go, they have a remarkable degree of self-control. They're not as prone to acting on instinct. It's just a matter of finding the right bribe and when it comes to that, Briar is the easiest to work with.”

With some reluctance, I asked, “What did you have to promise him in return?”

After a heavy sigh, Victor admitted, “The next time we find bedbugs, he wants me to capture a few of them alive, then plant them in the bed of someone who pulled a gun on him during a repo call.”

There is a lot to unpack in that sentence. I wonder if that's Briar's way of starting the ‘breaking down’ process with whoever this gunslinger is or if he just likes the idea of petty revenge. After talking with Vic more, I think it may be a combination of the two. 

Anyways, when they made this agreement, Victor gave him the stipulation that he couldn't cause any physical harm to their target or anyone else for the duration of this task. 

I pointed out, “Now he knows that guy's address.”

“He knew the address beforehand,” Victor told me to my shock. “He also knew the chairperson's name, seeing as how it's publicly available on the company's website. The entire board has already been on the Hunt's radar. They've got something in mind for them. Just not sure what yet.”

While Wes, the mechanic, and I were contending with the Hunger Grass, the head chairperson of that development company had called Orion’s emergency line in a panic due to black thorns growing around the outside of his house, trapping him inside like something from a fairytale. When he tried to get out through his back door, he was terrified to see that there was an antlered, winged, goat-legged figure sitting in one of his patio chairs, waving at him.

After receiving the call, Victor had pretended to chase Briar off with a crucifix. There’s a part of me that wishes I could’ve seen that pantomime play out. In my imagination, it looked a bit like a fourth grade school musical. But that also could be the migraine talking. Making me loopy.  

Once he’d ‘rescued’ the chairperson, Victor then made up a story about how Briar was a guardian of the trees that they’d angered with these repeated attempts at expansion. Even though Victor pretty much plagiarized *The Lorax,* it was enough for ~~the Onceler~~ the chairperson to profess that he was going to strongly suggest halting the project permanently when he met with his colleagues the following day. 

It made local headlines when The Avalon's construction was declared to have been postponed indefinitely. 

Once Victor's recollection had concluded, I told him honestly, “I'm actually amazed that worked.”

“You and me both.” He agreed brusquely. “But for how long, I'm not sure.”

I then filled him in on everything that happened on my end, including the newfound knowledge that a Wood Maiden was the culprit for the Hunger Grass outbreak. Victor is a bit more well-versed in Norse atypical infestations than I am, so he was able to shed some light on the Wood Maiden's behavior. 

They are extremely territorial to the point of rivaling a False Tree. However, I would argue that the Wood Maiden was worse; the False Tree has never tried to commit terrorism on the entire county before. It just focused on the specific perpetrators. Though, the Wood Maiden has a good reason for her hostility. Her life force is tied to a single tree: if that tree dies, so does she. 

For right now, my goal is to start feeling better. And to figure out how to deal with having the second sight. Good thing I'm dating an [expert.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD)


Update: I encountered the [Wood Maiden. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/DcNDwThHNi)  It went as well as yinz would expect.
