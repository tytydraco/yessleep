I guess I should start at the beginning. Years ago I lost use of my eye. It just blew up and stopped working right. Sort of rolls to the side and only saw distorted images. Slowly, over time, the distorted images turned darker and darker. Recently my eye just winked out. Total darkness. I've always worn an eye patch. This morning I was standing in my yard in the blowing snow and I took the patch off to rub my eye. I fluttered the lid for a second and looked around and, this freaks me out, I saw it. Just it at first. Only one. In the blindness there was this glowing thing. It was big, like about as tall as my garage. It had these moving, waving tentacles, lots of them. Each tentacle had an eye. It was walking, slithering, maybe oozing around the corner of where I think my garage is. Those tentacles were looking everywhere. It had six legs, hands, paws? Not sure. It seemed to stand on four and two were holding something. Spindly, sharp and squishy looking all at once. It had hair, but it was dripping ooze, each foot hand thing had curled dirty claws. I didn't scream, oh I wanted to but didn't. My breath came in sharp and I did jump back. All those tentacle eyes whipped in my direction. Under those eyes I saw light blue foam begin to drip. Drool? I fumble, my hands are shaking and cold but I slip my patch back on as fast as I could. Then turned to look at the creature. Nothing. My good eye sees snow, garage, my house. In order to get to my house I have to go by the garage. There was nothing there, right? Just some dead eye phantom. Not some impossible thing. I ran past the garage, up my stairs, sliding, stumbling, in the door, locked it, then just shook. Composing myself, I poured a cup of coffee and took my winter coat off.  
I should have let it go. Why didn't I just let it freaking go! I convinced myself it was some wacky fluke but I still walked over to the window. I had to see it wasn't there, right? So, I lifted up my patch and looked. There were tentacle pressed up against the glass! I counted 8, at least, they were squirming and waving in the wind. There was foamy blue dripping down the glass. Something caught my attention and I looked over to the street. There are more of them coming. So many more. Some with eight legs, some with two. Some with more fur, or scales, or extra tentacles. Each one a little different. Each one a walking, slithering sprinting nightmare!  
I sat under my kitchen table with my tablet and my coffee for awhile.Â  Every curtain is closed tight. I was afraid to move, afraid to look again, afraid not to.  
Eventually I crawled out from under the table and decided this must just be a fleeting burst of crazy. Impossible things certainly aren't possible, right. Deciding maybe I was just tired I got a snack and put some true crime on the telly to relax. A little snack, a little nap, I woke up feeling so much better. Maybe that was a dream? Sitting up from my nap I looked around. My patch had slipped off while I was sleeping. I didn't realize that when I opened my eyes. I scanned the room, just me. No monsters. See, just a silly nightmare.  
I took my patch off, absently tightening the cord as I walked down the hall to the bathroom. Turns out when I closed all those curtains, I forgot one. I looked out. It wasn't just a nightmare. Most of the crowd had wandered, skittered,oozed away, but a few were still out there. They didn't see me see them and seemed to have lost interest in me. Just wandering around doing whatever it is monsters do for fun. It looked like they were gathering things. Soil samples, snow, an old rusty bit of fencing. Why? What are these things? Have they always been here? I have a blind friend who almost never leaves her house. Does she see them? Or maybe, I'm just crazy?  
Sooner or later I'm going to have to go outside. I slipped my patch back on but not before I noticed a slight glow, a slight movement, from the other room. I think one of them may be in the house but honestly I'm afraid to look. Maybe if it doesn't think I've seen it, I'm safe? This is freaking me out. I have to know. Just one quick peek, what can that hurt?
