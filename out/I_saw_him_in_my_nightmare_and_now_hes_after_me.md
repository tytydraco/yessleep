Ever since June of 2022, I had been having these terrifying nightmares. I would be in this house, running from something... Someone... And as soon as I'd turn around to look, they were gone. These nightmares keep waking me up, sweaty and as though my breath has been taken out of me. It feels as though I was actually running, with my lungs burning and my legs aching. But Thursday night... Something different happened.

I was having the same nightmare, only this time I actually saw the monster. A tall, shadowy creature with very long arms and legs. Where it's eyes would be, were bright red eyes that were glowing and pierced through your soul. And it wasn't running. It was... Crawling. The creatures eyes looked like they became more enraged as it let out a shattering screech. I woke up sweating, and heaved in a huge breath of air. I adjusted my eyes and stared at the ceiling, and realized I had to use to bathroom. I went to get up, and was held down to the bed. I was spread out and unable to move at all. I couldn't speak or scream. 

That was when I saw him, standing in front of my door. My eyes grew wide as I tried to yell out for help, but all that came out was a weak, pitiful cry. The creature moved closer to me and slowly lowered one of his scrawny fingers down to my chest. A pain surged through me, and I was finally able to sit up. I frantically looked around, but the creature was gone. I slowly got up and peeked out my door, looking for any sign he had been here. As I made my way towards the bathroom, I realized any sign he had been here was gone. 

I used the bathroom and slowly made my way back into bed. I drifted to sleep, and actually had a normal dream for once. After waking up, I got out of bed and got dressed. Having had a normal night's sleep after that terrifying encounter, I felt better than ever. I checked my reflection in the mirror, making sure my outfit looked good. It was then I noticed the dark spot on my chest, with black lines almost like veins spreading out from it. As I continued studying my reflection, my eyes began to glow a dull red.  The realization hit me; I saw him in his world. He came to mine to mark me. 

And now he wants me to stay in his world.

Panicking, I immediately grabbed my laptop and tried looking up what this creature could be. I tried to figure out why he would appear to me, how he could, and what he was to no avail. I tried to talk to my friends, but they all think that I'm losing my mind. I think I understand. He wants me in his world so no one ever finds out he's the one who causes nightmares, I think.


I don't know what to do. I haven't slept in days. Is there anything I can doâ€¦? I don't think I can escape. I feel as though it's better just to accept that he will always be there, trying to capture me. He's never going to let me go, now that I've seen what he is. He will always be haunting me, until I come back to his nightmare he's created. All because I saw him, and he didn't want me to. I wasn't supposed to turn around
