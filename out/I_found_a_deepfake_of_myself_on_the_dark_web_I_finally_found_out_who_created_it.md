CONTENT WARNING: SUICIDE



My parents picked me up from the airport. Prior to my flight, I had told them everything over the phone, which saved me the discomfort of a face-to-face explanation. The ride home was awkward and quiet, and my dad spent most of it consoling my distraught mother, like *she* was the one who needed emotional support. 



I spent the next five days mostly in my room, too nervous to stray far from the house. I felt I might turn down any street corner and run into Angelica's creator. I returned to Tor, looking for any discussion of DOV3S that I might've overlooked. I revisited the *MirrorFrame* forum, and saw yet another post by the same user who had inquired about Angelica's identity. 



"DOV3S down for good??!!" asked the user, dismay palpable through the screen. There were three replies to this post, all of which confirmed that the website had disappeared without a trace. I figured they simply changed URLs, but if loyal customers could no longer track them down, then perhaps DOV3S really had ceased operations. I would've been ecstatic if I wasn't concerned it would impact my case.



After a week with few updates from either the police or the FBI, I started to emerge from my room more frequently, trying to rebuild bridges between my parents and myself. My mom and dad weren't bad people exactly, just distant. There had been that whole pageantry thing in my early childhood, and then my failed attempt at modelling when I was a teen. Sometimes it felt like they viewed me more as a side-hustle than a daughter. At least they had calmed down considerably once I turned 15 or so. My dad came into some money thanks to sports-betting, and he was generous with his earnings. He put me through both private high school and all four years of college, and I knew he spoiled my mom rotten with vacations. 



I remembered that my Dad had at one point been friends with Adam's stepdad, who I'll call "Mr. Doe". I broached the topic over dinner one night, and the inquiry made my dad stiffen. 



"John's son? No, can't say I knew the boy all too well," he said. "He seemed nice enough. A little awkward, maybe. One of those computer geeks." 



"Pot, meet kettle!" My mom said with a laugh, oblivious to the shifting tone of the conversation. My mom and dad knew only that I'd found a deep fake of myself, and that a "fan" had broken into my apartment. I hadn't mentioned Adam and Mary's involvement, partly because I just didn't want to talk about it, and partly because I didn't want my mom telling the whole neighborhood. 



"What about Mr. Doe himself? You guys were friends when I was in highschool, right?"



"Hm? I suppose John and I golfed now and then."



This time, it was my mom's turn to stiffen. Her expression of displeasure departed from her face as quickly as it arrived, but I caught it nonetheless. Oddly, it seemed to be the mention of golfing, not Mr. Doe, that agitated her. I asked a few more questions, and then the three of us fell into an uneasy silence. After a solid minute of this, my dad slapped both his palms on the wooden dining table, startling both my mother and I. He looked up with a smile. 



"You know what? It's been too long since the three of us did anything together. I say we need a vacation, Grace more than anyone. Don't you miss Ixtapa, love?" he asked my mother, who all but squealed in affirmation. 



"Dad, I can't go to *Mexico*. Not with everything going on right now." 



My dad's smile tightened a little. "Kiddo, everything going on right now is *why* you need to get outta here. I want you as far away from that man as possible, and the police up north are already working with you remotely—they can call you with any updates. Besides, you're a victim, not a suspect. They're not going to restrict your travel." 



I wasn't sure what to make of my dad's plan, but the thought of getting out of the neighborhood was a pleasant one. I reached out to the detective on my case about leaving the country short-term, and while he wasn't exactly pleased, he said I was free to move around as I wished. 



I started packing. When I couldn't find the swimsuit that I wanted to bring, my mom suggested checking the storage bins in the attic, the entrance to which was in my parents' room. With some reluctance, I pulled down the folding ladder and ascended to the dingy, claustrophobic place, more like a crawl-space than a room. I didn't find my suit, but I did find many mementos from my childhood: toys, books, photo albums, schoolwork, and an absurd amount of home videos copied to DVD and VHS. My parents *had* always preferred to look at my life through a camera lens. I spent so long rifling through my old essays from high school that I forgot what I was looking for altogether. I returned to the attic several times after that, each new visit unlocking some previously-forgotten memory. 



For a few days after my dad's impromptu vacation suggestion, I was in limbo. There were no updates to my case and my endless queries about DOV3S yielded little new information. My only success was learning a few more facts about Mary through the abandoned Facebook profile of her mother, whom I'll call "Mrs. Roe". The profile, despite belonging to the mother, almost exclusively featured Mary. There seemed to be an endless stream of posts documenting Mary's childhood, everything from her 5th birthday party to her junior varsity soccer games. 



I never found mention of a "Mr. Roe", either on social media or in the news, so I had a feeling Mary's father was out of the picture. 



As for Mrs. Roe, I could barely find a thing about the woman. She seemed to have disappeared off the face of the Earth after the search for Mary died down. It seemed unjust, in a way. How was it fair that her daughter was plastered all over the internet forever, whereas she had escaped its panoptic gaze unscathed? 



On April 2nd, 2025, I received a text from the detective up north. He asked if I was available for a video call, as opposed to our usual phone conversation, which immediately told me that they'd found something. I expected to hear that they'd discovered who had made the deep fakes, or at the very least, that they had found my stalker. 



Instead, they told me that Adam was dead. His corpse had been found in a ravine in the hills near his home, not far from where he asked me to meet only a week prior. He was found by a hiker, and though his body was wracked with broken bones from the fall, his cause of death was exsanguination from a series of stab wounds in his back.



The news shocked me to my core. After our last interaction, I had been certain that Adam was either the perpetrator, or in some way working with DOV3S' creator. I thought back to our texts, to his change in tone and his sudden desire to meet me in person. Maybe he had confronted the person behind the deep fakes, who had murdered him and then tried to do the same to me. I told the detective my theory.



I don't remember much of the next few days. I spent most of it in bed, trying to sleep off an ever-worsening numbness. Adam was dead. Mary was missing and probably dead. If I dared to leave the cage of my parent's house and try to live a normal life, I would very likely follow my fellow "birds" to the grave. And for what? What had I, or any of us, done to deserve any of it? 



For most intents and purposes, this story ends on April 6th, 2025. I woke up in the evening after a day of fitful nightmares. My mom was out with some of her girl friends, and had sent me a text stating she wouldn't be back until the early morning. My dad was in his office, likely making travel arrangements. After the news about Adam, the police asked me to postpone any trips out of the U.S., yet for some reason, my dad still seemed dead-set on getting us out of the country. 



My bedroom started to feel suffocating. I went to the attic, maybe hoping to find comfort in memories of a simpler time. I spent a while reading my thoroughly uninteresting diaries from middle school, and then I happened upon a small, leather-bound journal. My mother's name was written on the inside cover; it must have been with my things by mistake.



I sat cross-legged on the dusty floor and looked inside. The journal's entries began back in 2011 but only ended in 2020. It was unfinished and sparsely populated, and most of it seemed to be about my dad—complaints about his late nights at his engineering firm, sadness over unnoticed attempts for emotional connection. I regarded some of what she wrote as unfair, but I was also sympathetic. The reflections were those of a very lonely person. I was about to close the journal and move on when I came across an entry from 2017.



*… He's out again today, despite my begging him to spend a little time with me and Grace for once. Why do I even bother? It was bad enough when it was just his buddy John Doe, but now those two are always with that Jane Roe woman from across town. They golf together every single weekend, always huddled up on the green, scheming like mobsters at a wake. Does he think I'm blind to this little ménage à trois? What a joke.* 



I felt like my heart stopped beating. Suddenly, gruesomely, everything clicked into place. Who would have been capable of creating Angelica? Someone with plenty of access to photos and videos of me, as well as recordings of my voice. Someone who would want to protect my identity so that fans couldn't trace the videos back to my family. The same would've been true of the person—no, of the *people* behind Mary and Adam's videos. 



At that moment, the bedroom door opened. 



"You up there, Gracie?" My dad said, and I remember my whole body freezing in place. I closed the journal and backed away from the hatch. There was nowhere to run or hide. The ladder squeaked as my dad climbed up the rungs one by one. He peeked his head over the lip of the attic entrance and stared at me.



"Everything alright?" 



I stared back wordlessly. I couldn't help it; I've always been a terrible liar. After a few seconds, I mumbled some excuse, but fear made my words quiet and unconvincing. He started climbing further into the attic, resting his forearms on the floor. Not knowing what to expect, I got to my feet, crouched like a cornered animal to accommodate the low ceiling. I told him not to come any closer, and his face darkened. He kept asking me "What's wrong, Gracie? Why do you look so scared?", but with every word, his voice tone became less concerned and more angry. At last, my good sense scrambled by fear, I asked him: 



"Why did you do that to me?" 

He froze. The way his face was completely lit from underneath gave his face a flattened, uncanny effect. For a second, he looked a lot like Angelica in her white room. 



"Oh …" he said, and then came a stretch of silence so loud it made my eardrums ring. For some reason, after he said that, he started smiling. Really, it was more baring his teeth—there was no humor in his eyes. I couldn't read his expression whatsoever, had no clue if he was angry, guilty, sad, or something else. 



Then, he descended the rickety ladder. I crept my way over to the hatch. The ladder could not be pulled up from inside, so I knew that my best option was to make a run for it. Cautiously, I peered down through the square hole in the attic floor just in time to see my dad procure a handgun from his nightstand. We locked eyes for a moment, and then, with that same smile on his face, he lifted the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. 



I watched, transfixed, from the attic as blood rushed from the hole in his head. I stared at his body, crumpled and lifeless on the same soft rug I used to play on as a baby. I stared and stared until my mom came home and her screams broke me out of my trance at last. 



When the police arrived, I explained everything, including my hunch about the involvement of Adam and Mary's parents. Adam's step-father was arrested the following day, and it was not long before the police extracted a confession from him. He said that he, along with Mrs. Roe and my father, had begun producing and selling the deep fakes when the three of us were still in highschool. DOV3S gained an extremely devoted fanbase, and the revenue generated by the videos was exorbitant. I couldn't believe my eyes when I finally saw how much money my father had tucked away. 



As of my writing this on May 5th, 2025, Mr. John Doe is still awaiting trial. Despite his attempts to paint my father as the manipulative mastermind behind the operation, it seems pretty clear that the three adults were equal partners. Neither Mary nor her mother have yet been found, and unfortunately, neither has my stalker. I was hopeful at first, *certain* that the police would find some of his DNA at my apartment and swiftly apprehend him. With every passing day, that scenario seems less likely. I'm trying my best to stay optimistic. I remain hopeful that one day I'll be able to see a dark blue Jeep on the road without my heart skipping a beat. 



You know, on one hand, I can't believe what happened to me, and on the other, it seems like the most natural thing in the world. Every time I open Instagram, I'm greeted by some idiot parent posting endless photos of their underage children. Every time I look at Twitter, I see some AI-generated slop of *real* people doing and saying outrageous things. Of course, I'll always hate him for what he did, but in a strange way, I can understand the siren call of an eager, well-paying audience. I'm sure in his head, he staved off the guilt by spending the money on me and my mom. I wonder how long he would've kept going had I not confronted him. 



Well, I have to get going again. I can hear my mom crying in the other room of the hotel suite that's become our temporary residence. I thought I would be bitter, but instead, it brings me comfort to console her. It helps me keep my mind off of the image of his dying body, and how the trapdoor of the dark attic framed it just like a viewfinder.
