*What was that*? I thought. 

There was a blur from my peripherals, a flash of silky white that broke me out of my dull stupor. 

Out of place.

In and out like a glimmer of light. 

It appeared to have alarmed my partner Axle too. He stood up from the lookout point as I did. The binoculars revealed nothing. There was a murmur of acknowledgment as our eyes narrowed in on the vague patch of blackness that blotted out the spaces between the trees. We froze in the brisk breeze like two children who had thought they’d seen a ghost. 

“Hold on,” I urged, my hand pulling my partner back from the ladder. Axle lowered his gun. 

There it was again, weaving through the shadows of the treeline. It was coming *closer*, at a pace we hadn’t seen in these woods for quite some time. My heart slapped erratically in my chest as I recalled stories from my youth– tales of monsters in the woods donning human skin, deceased hikers in the form of poltergeists, or even scarier yet– the hulking figure of a starved and aging grizzly.  

Could we rule any of those out? There was only one way.

“You good?” Axle asked. 

I gave him a nod and we climbed down. 

“Be careful, friend,” he warned. His eyes had a bleak dim to them.

“Likewise.” I patted him on his helmet.  “Just like they taught us. Stay alert. Stick together.”

Of course, we had been trained for situations like this, but possibilities turned into old wives' tales the longer the days piled up without incidents. 

We took off in the prototypical march, crouched over and steady through the woodland. The blood-orange sun began to cast a dim light in our favor, rising slowly in the thick morning haze. 

But nothing could simulate this moment. Oh, how heavy the boots felt. Our breathing precipitated into ragged snorts before too long, our bodies barely chugging along as they battled the weight of the suit, the canisters, and the equipment. How unnecessary, we often bitched to one another on those cold lonely nights when it was just us under the dilapidated wooden roof, the stars our only source of light. Infrequency had dulled us into poor form and left us unprepared to traverse this wild, unmanicured terrain we had once sworn to protect. 

Time felt slow. And while the target hadn’t shown itself again for quite some time, no one dared to issue a proposal to turn back, for fear of shame and ridicule, although, I’ll admit, the inclination had crept up my spine on more than one occasion.

We continued our death march toward nothing good, only stopping when we heard a voice.

Straggled groans rustled in through the darkness. We stood still for a moment. Axle pointed and I slogged into position, taking cover opposite him. In a matter of seconds, the man appeared, and we rushed him before he could react.

He was large. That was the first thing I noticed, how sweaty he had become around his fluffy folds of fat. Overfed. That was a rare sight these days. Other features slowly began to raise alarm bells–his dark, swollen eyes, wide with utter panic, his lack of shoes, his lack of *everything*. No supplies and yet so old and so clearly taken care of that it made me question–*how?*

And*…why?*

The morning light cast its glow upon his garments to reveal the lily-white robe. A pulse of fear fluttered in the pit of my stomach. This was no ordinary man wandering the woods. He was bestowed the blessed embroidered linen. His place was up there with the divine. This man of such prominence and prestige had blood dripping from the tears in his sleeves, the wool had holes and was tangled in bits of dead leaves. 

My body went stiff.

“Axle,” I announced in awe. “I can’t believe it.” 

But my partner had already dragged the man to the floor. 

“No…No…Stop!” I shouted, wrestling with Axle’s grip. 

“Stop it, Teej. Stay down, old man!” He reached into his pocket and slapped together the cuffs. The magnetic latches locked with a sudden *clack* that forced a squeal of agony out of the man. 

*Does he not see it? He must not know?* 

A moment of clarity rose from the dead forest as I informed Axle of who I believed the man to be. We had been isolated, out of the general population for quite a while now. Life in the barren wasteland had finally appeared in the most unforeseen circumstances. 

Tears traveled down the man’s pallid cheeks as he begged and he pleaded. Axle’s fierce charcoal eyes met the man's own black pools of despair. 

*Those are our eyes. Our features.*

“We must call this in,” he urged. 

“Hold on,” I replied. “ Just a second.”

*Was he not curious at all?* 

I scanned the old man’s brows and bowed ears, the cut of his jawline, his teeth. I inspected, to the man’s annoyance, and then apologized for my keen interest.

He broke out in a frenzied cough fit, a splat of mucousy tar puddled in his pale palm. 

“Help me grab him,” Axle ordered. “He needs air. Geez, look at his wounds.” 

The man dropped to his knees again, shaking his head violently. “Please! Please, no! 

Then, over and over in a manic chant:

“I cannot go back. I will not go back.” 

Axle gripped the flailing man by the shoulders and thumped him a few hard times against the earth. The man groaned back in pain. 

“Easy!” I shouted back. “If you damage him, that is on *you*. He comes back alive, dammit.” 

“*Alive*,” my partner repeated. My dear friend. My comrade. The rhetoric coursed through him.  

He yanked the man's arm so suddenly the limb threatened to pop out of the socket.

“Careful!” I warned. 

Axle chuckled coldly to himself.

With us all on our feet again, we began our march back. We trodded slowly through the crosswind whistling through the trees and the crunch of our feet against the tough dirt.

Caught in my throat was the chilling realization of the man’s predicament, a lump so big I could hardly swallow.

*How had the man escaped?*

*And…why?*

We were to carry him back to the lookout point for the deliverables to fetch him away. After that, his fate was out of our hands. The tribunal could be tricky at times but this was a man of a distinguished few.  

However, somewhere along the way, we hadn’t noticed the mechanical click. Before we could react, the man leaped for Axle’s hunting knife, and in a series of swipes, he slashed my friend's neck. Blood trickled down his chest plate. Axle collapsed, clutching the oozing wound, his gurgles and drowned gasps for air sudden and resolute. 

I shook hysterically, struggling to release my gun from its holster. The man was quick, he had a grip of Axle’s weapon just as he hit the floor. Along the dirt was a piece of metal, a carved trinity key.

“Lower your weapon! Now!”

Raising my hands in surrender, I obeyed the man’s orders. He removed my gun and kicked it out of reach.

“Hands up! On your knees!” 

I dropped and watched the man strip from his robe. It revealed raw patches of tender skin around his genitalia. The appendage hung sorely like a deflated piece of flesh, saggy and scarred. The damage to his body made me cringe. There were scars like deep skin troughs, singed, and yellowed bruising around his wrist and ankles. 

“Off,” he pointed at my equipment. “Now!”

I refused and he aimed the gun at my chest. 

“You think I’m playing games?”

I shook my head and begrudgingly removed my equipment, laying the helmet, body suit, and utility belt on the dirt. He squeezed into the suit (barely), sacks of fat around his midsection clumped together from the sides in an almost comical fashion. He breathed in deeply, soaking in the fresh air from the canister hooked up to the back of the chest plate.

“Alright.” He tossed me the dirtied robe and flashed me a stern look. “Put this on. Now.”

“You don’t have to do this,” I pleaded.

“Put it on. Now.” 

The robe smelled sour and was damp from the man's sweat. I felt like a child as the large garment seemed to sway with the wind like a tent wrapped around my thin frame. As he approached, he poked the gun against my back. I felt something slide from the garment’s midsection and there was a stern tug around my wrists as he tied the knot tight. 

There was a strange smile upon his face that I couldn’t quite place. It was not sadistic or maniacal. It was faint and crinkled, softened maybe by a shred of relief and awkward pity.

 He gathered the other gun and clipped it to his waist.  

“You need to know they are coming,” he warned.

Before he turned to leave, he tossed Axle’s knife off into a clearing, in plain view.

“Wh–who?”

He bid me ado like a fellow citizen– a firm salute, and *that* smile—before he took off running. I stood by my dead partner in the Borealis Memorium, the last “living” symbol we had left. There were few visitors permitted, mainly the horticulturalists and naturalists left to revive and infuse the sacred land before there was nothing left. 

They would be here soon. They had to be here.

I ran to the knife and began to whittle myself free. I felt the fibers slowly stripping away as I rubbed the blade against the knot. 

But I could hear them now.

Off in the distance there was chittering. There was rustling, like many things were being dragged along the forest floor. 

Then there was a chorus of demented wails.

My stomach twisted at the sound as it got closer and ever more discernable. 

*Infantile screams.* 

We all had our place in this new world.

I ducked behind a dead oak and desperately hacked at the knot. The rope finally gave way. Knife in hand, I waited. But I soon realized that there were far too many to manage. Their little knees knocked against the roots and rocks with fury the moment they spotted the glint of white. Their sacks of skin, tangle of limbs, an abomination of mutation and disease. They all cried, a chorus in the wind.

*Da-Da.*
