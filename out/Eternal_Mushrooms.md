***Ringing phone—***

Picked up.

I say: “Hey.” *Hung-over.* “Crane here.”

Breath reeks of alcohol.

Winston says: “Chief, we got a situation. Lead on a cold case—actually, many cold cases. Same lead. All cases: missing persons. Wouldn't call on a Saturday unless it was serious. It's serious, chief.”

“What cases?”

He lists a couple off the top of his head, ends in: “Eugene Codwalder.”

“Never heard of that one,” I say.

“Married. Banker. Twelve children. Exits his carriage one night in Philadelphia and disappears. Nobody hears from him again—”

“Until now.”

“Yeah. Until now.”

I ask: “When'd he disappear?”

Winston chuckles. “That's the thing, chief.

“1876.”

I say, thinking the connection's gone to shit, “I think the connection's gone to shit.”

“Connection's fine,” says Winston. “You heard right. 1876. Like I said, it's serious. I need you out here.”

“I'll be there in thirty.”

“You won't.”

“Why not—what's the address?”

Winston chuckles again. “There isn't one. It's a cave system in South-fucking-Dakota.”

My wife asked me once whether I'd like to live forever. She was dying. I didn't know. “But if you could—would you?” I said probably not. She said: “That makes one of us.” A year later she was gone and I was standing at her funeral holding a closed umbrella in the rain.

Plane touches down.

Hard landing.

Absolutely nothing around save the airport. I don't know how people live around here. “If you want fun, go to Sioux Falls,” a local cop tells me in the car.

“That the capital?”

“No, sir. The state capital’s Pierre.”

I guess Sioux Falls (pop. 220,000) feels big compared to Pierre (pop. 14,000).

Winston meets me at the cave entrance. There's a slight buzz of activity. “Been out here long?” I ask.

“Three days thereabouts.”

“Fill me in.”

“Fifteen of our missing persons accounted for in the cave so far. Probably more. It's—well, you'll see. And we're liaising with departments around the country. One arrest, but nothing to hold her on. A few people of interest.”

“So fifteen Philadelphian bodies buried—”

“Fifteen *people*, chief.”

“They're alive?”

Before he can answer we duck under a low arch and enter a large subterranean chamber. Looks natural to me, but I'm no speleologist. Inside: arranged in neat rows, hundreds of straws sticking up, out of the ground, in pairs: red / white. “Food and water,” says Winston.

The woman Winston arrested introduces herself as caretaker. She's remarkably calm. “I keep them fed and watered. No one's there against his will. We have paperwork dating back to the seventeenth century.”

Eugene Codwalder, born March 7, 1833, lies peacefully on a bed, pale as alabaster, covered in thick, dark body hair, near-to-no muscle on his body; but the bones and organs function, and the mind's still there.

Like all of them but a little more so *he resembles a jellyfish made of milk.*

He asks: “Why. Did. You… Exhume… Me?”

“You've been buried alive—”

“We. Are… Becoming.” His gelatinous mass trembles: [*“Eternal Mushrooms.”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)
