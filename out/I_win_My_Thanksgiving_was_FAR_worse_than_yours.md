Kids can say the dumbest shit.

Don’t get me wrong. I would die for my five-year-old son; I love him more than I love myself. 

But that doesn’t make his commentary any more meaningful. Any parent who’s had to explain why jellybeans can’t go in the toaster will comprehend; every parent who’s had to clean melted jellybeans *out* of the toaster will empathize.

So “Daddy, there’s something scary under the bed” had gotten old long before my wife and I loaded Liam into the car to begin the two-day trip to her parents’ house for Thanksgiving. 

“It’s your turn,” I mumbled to Stacy as I rolled over on the pull-out bed.

“Last time, I had to clean and entire bottle of Gatorade pee,” she huffed. “That counts for two. Besides, he called for you.” She pushed me to the edge of the uncomfortable bed.

Sighing, I stood up and shambled over to the miniscule twin bed on the other side of the room and sat down on the mattress. “Liam, do you remember that I need a good night’s sleep so I won’t crash the car while I’m driving tomorrow?”

“But something’s moving under the mattress,” he whispered in a voice that was inappropriately dramatic.

I rubbed my eyes before trying to focus on Liam’s silhouette in the faint moonlight. “Matt’s one of my best friends from college, and he’s being very generous to let us stay in his house. I’m sure he gave us a room without any monsters in it.”

That usually calms him down. Usually, but not always. This was one of those “not always” moments. Liam wheezed like he was finishing the final stretch of the Boston Marathon, which meant that I could either check under the bed for potential threats or spend the next thirty minutes mopping up piss. 

“The tapping is coming from beneath my pillow. Check that part of the bed first,” he gasped.

I’ll be honest, that part made my hair stand up just a little as I got to my hands and knees. “Okay, Liam,” I announced as I lifted the edge of his sheet. “I’m sticking my head underneath the bed right now, and-”

Damn, it stank. What was Matt keeping under here? I blinked, struggling to see in a space where the moonlight barely reached. 

The first thing I recognized was the eye. It stared at me, just inches away from my nose. I really, really didn’t want to move, because that would mean accepting what I was seeing as real.

The hand on my wrist forced me into action. Her grip was slimy and gritty, and it left a cold, wet, and copper-smelling residue on my skin. I pulled away and scrambled to my feet, very angry with gravity for confusing me.

I’ll admit that a tiny, selfish part of my brain contemplated running away from Liam and heading out the door. But I ignored the thought and leapt forward, scooping my son from the bed and turning around.

It was enough time for a clammy hand to find my ankle. This time, her grip felt like ice. 

But I broke away and stumbled to the pullout bed, crashing onto Stacy as Liam screamed. That was enough to get her from asleep to fully standing in a quarter of a second.

“Dave,” she gasped, “what are you-”

She didn’t need to finish. The woman now crawling out from beneath Liam’s bed was visible even in the dim moonlight. 

It was my turn for an inappropriate piss as I realized that she was standing between us and the only door.

Still urinating, I grabbed my son in one arm and my wife in the other and ran for the window.

We had just enough time to crawl onto the roof before she reached us.

The next couple of hours were a blur. I’d like to say that I climbed down from the roof gracefully, but I’m trying to stay as honest as possible. Without our car keys or cell phones, we had to pound on a neighbor’s door until they woke up. 

The police arrived faster than answers did. Matt was taken away in handcuffs, and the woman was taken away in an ambulance. The truth eventually found its way to us: Matt had been kidnapping and torturing people, mostly women, for years. He’d pulled the tongue from the mouth of victim beneath Liam’s bed, and she’d actually been begging us for help as she bled to death.

She didn’t survive. 

Matt hadn’t planned on letting us leave his home with this knowledge. He’d been waiting in the hall, intending to catch us as we ran out. Apparently, capturing people in the moment of panic is the biggest thrill for him.

He hadn’t counted on us climbing out of the two-story window.

That’s the only reason we’re alive. 

He’d already killed nineteen people, and another thirteen were trapped at various places within his home in various makeshift torture chambers. At first, I’d refused to believe that one of my best friends was capable of what prosecutors claimed. 

But that was before they showed me his notebook, which documented the grisly details of each murder. 

At the end of it, five pages had been set aside for Stacy, Liam, and me. 

He was going to make me choose one of them to get tortured first, then force me to watch every second of it. 

So that was how my Thanksgiving travel plans went awry. I hope yours played out better. 

I doubt Liam will be able to sleep alone until he’s a teenager. To be honest, I don’t blame him. He’s seen the world for the worst it can be.

Kids really do say the dumbest shit.
