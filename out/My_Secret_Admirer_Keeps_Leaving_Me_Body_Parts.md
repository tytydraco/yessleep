*Hi!*

*My name is Marrissa May, head camp counselor for cabin 4, the best cabin in Camp Chagrin. My hobbies include, cooking, archery, and swim instruction. I’m here to make your camp experience the G.O.A.T., or greatest of all time.*

These words hang from the door of cabin 4, inviting all its residents to read and learn a little bit more about me, to make them feel a little more comfortable when they come to camp. The paper is old, fraying at the edges, water damaged and lightened by the sun. No one else would know how long it had been there but me. 6 years. The camp had been just a way to spend my summers to avoid being at home through my college’s summer breaks, but now cabin 4 was my cabin, my home, and this year would be my last one here.

It was not a good last year either. There had been a death in the woods, campers, probably college kids drunk on cheap beer wandered into the woods for a piss before getting lost and probably eaten by a bear. It was a tragedy that almost prevented the camp from opening this summer. I was delighted the camp had even opened in the face of this tragedy, but a fog hung over the camp since then, both metaphorically and in a literal mist off the lake that has clung to the trees despite the sunrays desperate attempt to burn it away.

Almost none of the local families sent their kids this year, nearly all the campers were from parents out of town who probably hadn’t been informed of the campers’ demise. This loss of the locals has been awful for my last year. I had known some campers here for the entirety of my 6-year run and now I would not be able to make my final goodbyes.

I’ll be the first to admit that my melancholia has not been doing anybody any favors, but this year just feels different, like the camp is unnatural around me, changing, shifting beneath me. Sometimes I’ll get lost in the woods while leading hikes, suddenly losing my baring on trails that I have memorized for 6 years. I’d chock it up to the stress of having to move on, but someone out there has been paying me especially close attention.

The kids think that I have a secret admirer. Sure, I’ve had a number of campers develop kiddie crushes on me, but this goes way beyond the expected swooning and blushing. This “admirer” has been breaking into my cabin to leave flowers under my pillow, tracking in dirt as they do so. They’ve even been leaving drawings of flowers, that kind you find in textbooks, you know.  I talked to the camp owners about changing the cabin’s locks, I even did a sit-down discussion with all the campers about the importance of privacy, but it hasn’t gotten better. It’s only gotten worse.

I was now getting teeth under my pillow, even a whole fingernail once. All still things a camper could naturally lose and think it funny to put in my cabin, but I couldn’t shake a feeling that there was something more behind it. I hadn’t recognized it yet, but I realize now that in total all the Camp Chagrin campers had lost a total of 7 teeth over the summer, 2 less than the total I had received as nightly presents.

I decided to take it into my own hands, so I called the police down. Made a whole show of it to the campers, really tried to show them how seriously I was taking this.  The police paled upon seeing the flower drawings. They said they’d have to take them into evidence, asked me to go home to my parents tonight said that they were worried about “intensifying behavior”, which I deemed vastly out of proportion, so I stayed.

I spent last night half awake, half out of unease and half out of sheer insomnia. During the daylight it had been easy to shrug off the polices request, but now upon nightfall I began to doubt my decision. I think, deep down, I knew that something was coming. I must have fallen asleep at some point, my eyes shutting for what felt like only a moment before waking to the sound of the cabin door closing. I bolted, rushing outside in my night gown, ready to confront the intruder.

I wish I could say it wasn’t human, but it was the human elements that scared me the most. The human eyes embedded into the malformed skull, now resembling more of a deer than a human. Human teeth rimming the pronounced snout. Antlers sprouted behind human ears. It was illuminated only by the flickering light of the porch, which glinted off its drooling maul. Despite the darkness I could make out the white pages of a sketchbook, gripped by talon tipped fingers.

I was stuck still. Taking in the monster. Slowly, it ripped out a page of the sketchbook and extended it out to me. Its arm reaching unnaturally far, muscular yet sickly. It was another flower drawing, meticulously etched in flowing lines of black ink. I screamed.

Its mouth tried to open to speak, perhaps seeking to soothe me. It did not however, as its attempted syllables ripped apart its cheeks as its unnatural jaw lowered.

“Ssss-” It creaked. Its mouth unable to open farther without splitting its flesh to an irreparable degree. Human tears fell from its eyes as it wept over its tongue, no longer able to enunciate letters. It moved closer to me, I inched my back along the side of the porch, trying to feel for the doorknob, my eyes still fixed upon the creature.

“Ssoo” The creatures mouth fully tore open, hinging apart, blood pouring from its split flesh. It crawled closer, each arm reaching forward painfully slowly. Finally, its taloned hands touched the old wood of the cabin’s porch, digging into it with ease.

Finally, my fingers grasped the doorknob, twisting it slowly, afraid any quick movements might upset the beast. It looked up at me pitifully, although when it was unstretched in the darkness it was at least 7 feet tall, it was now no larger than a large dog hunched at my feet.

“Soorry” it crooned. Its hands reached up to cover its face, pausing to sob before digging its nails into its eye sockets, popping them free from its skull. It held them out to me.

“Taake” The creature pushed the eyes towards me again. I hate to admit it, but I took them. I grabbed the 2 eyes, and I held them close to my chest as if they were the one thing that could save me.

“Thank you, that’s very kind of you to give me, uh, something you hold so dear,” I muttered. The eyes were still warm in my hands. The deer creature almost seemed to attempt a smile, but with the torn flesh that made up its mouth made it appear much more like an animal baring its teeth. It’s now hollow eye sockets staring back at me. It retreated back into the forest, moving like a wild animal into the darkness.

I called the police after that. The official story is that there was another bear attack, one that I miraculously survived. That at least explained the scratches on the porch and partially explained the various body parts left in my cabin. I had been too drowsy to notice when the creature had woken me last night, but it had left another “present” for me in my bed. A heart, presumably human, presumably his. The cops confiscated all the body parts, said that they could sweep it all under the rug.

They finally told me what really happened to those campers. They had been visiting near the camp because they had been previous campers at camp Chagrin, campers 6 years ago, one of them from cabin 4, a boy. Robert Speck, a college student majoring in art, minoring in botany.

They said something got him out there, made him into what he was now. They said he must have been coming back to see me, fueled by some boyhood crush or half-forgotten memories. They say these creatures do it a lot, give their body parts to the people they trust, something about letting them hang onto the remaining human parts of them.

 I don’t know if I believe in all that, but I know that I’m not staying another night at this cabin. I told my bosses this morning, I packed my bags, and I’m taking that cabin sign with me, along with all the flower drawings that thing Robert has become gave me. I can at least keep that part of him alive, and human.
