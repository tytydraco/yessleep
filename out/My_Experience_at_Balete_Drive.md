If you are from the Philippines chances are you know where this place is and all the associated urban myths, stories and legends about it.

I shall add my own to it today. To start I believe in the supernatural but have grown somewhat desensitized to the horror genre due to years of consuming content from horror let's plays to reading stuff here on reddit, not to mention though that I myself have already experienced quite a few events relating to the supernatural.

So one late evening around 11pm or so I was coming home from a classmates house finishing up our Thesis Project and hailed a taxi as transport. The route we took dove straight through the infamous stretch of road but at the time I paid it no heed because one I was exhausted through the cram session I just had and two that I was organizing my documents on the ride I was at.

As we started to traverse that road I briefly glanced about still rifling through my stuff. I saw that there was another vehicle behind us travelling at a decent speed and distance from my taxi. Outside was the paved road rows and rows of Balete Trees or in English Willows I think they are called, mixed in are structures from both modern and colonial Spanish era.

The ride was mostly smooth up until upon crossing a certain intersection the car behind us started erratically flashing their high-beams at us. Annoyed my driver pulled up to the side where the other person followed suit. I came out of the car as well as my taxi driver to confront this guy. 

My taxi driver started with translated to English "What's the emergency/problem bro?", the guy then replied "I saw something that you might want to take a look at". The guy in his hand then showed us his dashcam where we saw something one might consider spine chilling.

On it we saw that me and the driver weren't the only people on the taxi. Behind us was a figure with feminine features long hair and slender body dressed in a grayish white night gown but slightly blurry as if she was draped in fog. That was when it hit me that we were visited by the so called "White Lady" of Balete Drive.

The guy from the other car said "I wasn't going to do anything when I saw her because she was an almost common occurrence in the area but what I saw next made me flash my lights at you guys look look ".

What we saw next as we watched the video feed on the dashcam both confused and enlightened us, it was as if the entity was fiddling around with the cars gear stick.

We all came to the conclusion that this might be why or maybe one of the reasons of why a lot of accidents happen at that stretch of road.

We said a prayer the taxi driver sprinkled some salt at the back seat -- surprised he had some on him probably leftover condiments from his packed lunch or something -- and went our way to which no further incidents happened.

Days have passed after the incident I had almost forgotten about it but then in my apartment there on my computer I saw her again now fiddling with it. -- said to myself a crap probably should have done "pagpag" or that Filipino ritual of going into a restaurant or convenience store first before going home to confuse wandering spirits from following you home -- 

Well so long as she's not causing trouble, she ain't getting exorcised I jokingly said to myself to which a week passed then a month where she didn't show which I concluded that either she passed on or returned to Balete Drive ready to play some kind of prank to next individual she takes a curiosity to.
