During my time at Goodwill, I’ve seen people turn in so many crazy items. One time, a lady tried to donate her dead husband’s false teeth. We politely told her “no thanks” and gave them back to her. We called her “Chompers” every time she shopped in the store. 

While the weird and gross things are fun to gossip about, what I love getting are personal journals that people have accidentally donated with other books. It’s surprising how often this happens. There’s a thrill in reading something a person never intended for someone else to read. The honesty and true feelings that leap off the page are a gas to read.

Last week, I came across a journal someone had dropped off late in the evening with a cache of other books. As soon as I fished it out and started reading, I was hooked. This is, without a doubt, the weirdest, freakiest thing I’ve ever read. It’s a hybrid journal of handwritten pages and printed transcripts. It’s odd.

I’m gonna post the best parts, hoping someone out there can fill me in on what I’ve read. If any of this sounds familiar, please reach out. I have to know more.

8/20

I’ve been married to my wife Faith for four years and together for six. It’s been the happiest six years of my life. Before we got together, I had been going through a very rough time in my life. My parents had died in a house fire about four months before we got together. The fire department suspected arson, but never found who was responsible. Never getting closure on such a profound loss numbs your heart. On top of that, I had learned that my company was downsizing, and they gave me my walking papers a week after I buried my folks. 

Since these things come in threes, joining my parent’s death and lack of career prospects was the last member of the trio: alcoholism. I hit the skids pretty hard. I was looking for a good time and thought I’d find it at the bottom of a bottle. While there was a brief period of “fun” when I’d go out drinking (in this case, fun meaning not feeling like jumping off a bridge for about two hours before blacking out) that soon gave way to hooking up with random weirdos, feeling like garbage every morning, and a rapidly dwindling savings account.

It was during this low point in my life when I found Faith. I first saw her working at the grocery store near my house and thought she was a knockout. Since I was there all the time grabbing something to drink, I eventually got to talking with her. Liquid courage and all that. Turns out, we had a lot in common. While we first bonded over small things - bands we liked, favorite cereal (we were in the aisle), stuff like that - but soon we started having the type of conversations you’d have on dates. I took a shot and asked her out and, after she berated me for taking so long, she said yes.

It was the first good news I had received in months.

Our first date was amazing. We met for Mexican food at a local favorite and lost track of time chatting. She told me she’d finished school two years earlier with a degree in substance abuse psychology, but had trouble finding a good job. She was working at the store temporarily until she found something better. I joked that while I was upset she hadn’t nailed down her dream job yet, I was glad it had led to us meeting. She agreed and added that it felt like fate. I couldn’t disagree.

Faith helped me heal myself. Her warming presence in my life helped to thaw my heart. She had noticed my drinking and, while never judging, she helped to guide me to putting down the bottle for good. It was a revelation, and I immediately felt the changes in my life. I had gone through a tunnel of shit and came out clean on the other side. Faith did that.  

It’s not an exaggeration to say that I fell head over heels in love with her about a month into our dating. 

I knew I had fallen into the best thing that’s ever happened to me and I didn’t want to lose it. I started thinking about ways I could support and help her. While I’d never be able to repay her for saving myself from myself, I became her biggest supporter. When she felt down, I did whatever I could to lift her up. Eventually, she found that job. Not long after, we moved in together. My happiness had returned and Faith was my north star.

I say all this to set the table for how weird her behavior lately has been. Ever since she started her new job, she’s been working long hours at the office. At first, she said it was something everyone goes through when they first start in this line of work. Low man (or woman, as it were) gets the extra workloads. Faith didn’t mind too much. She loved her job and was amazing at it. Anyone who got her as a counselor could count themselves as lucky.

I missed her, but I understood. I, too, had found new employment and saw my free time dwindle. We both had to try a little harder to make things work. It wasn’t always easy, but some things are worth the hassle. Faith was worth the hassle.

Within a few weeks, my job fell into a normal routine. I expected hers to follow suit, but that wasn’t the case. In fact, her hours got more erratic. She started having counseling appointments later into the evening, as some of her new, more difficult clients had to work around very full schedules. On top of that, she had become closer to her coworkers and, after rough days in the office, they’d sometimes need to blow off some steam with a drink at the local bar. Faith told me I could join them if I wanted, but I didn’t want to be that guy. I trusted her implicitly and wanted to give her some space.

If you’ve ever spoken with a teacher, the bond they get with their coworkers becomes ironclad. They have to deal with so many unexpected issues from their students, parents, and administration…and that’s before they’re expected to teach the Revolutionary war to bored middle schoolers. It’s like soldiers bonding in a battle. Unless you’ve been there, you can’t really understand it. 

Working to help people get clean is like that, too. You get to know your clients on a deep, personal level. You care about them. Faith has told me as a counselor, you take the journey with your clients. When they succeed, you feel successful. When they fail, you feel like a failure. She told me that when a client fails and ends their life (which can happen), it leaves you a wreck. All that said, if she needs to have a drink with her coworkers to decompress after, I understand.

About two months into her job, a new guy named Blake started at her office. They slotted him into the office next to her and they clicked instantly. Blake and Faith would hang out most lunch breaks and discuss their cases and brainstorm solutions. I met Blake a few times, and he seemed like a good dude. I joked with Faith that he was her “work husband” and she didn’t argue. They’re good friends making their way as best they can in a demanding job.

Naturally, they would text back and forth. Most of the time it was work related but, as you become friends with someone, your personal relationship bleeds through. Again, I wasn’t worried. Faith never hid her phone or erased texts or anything. I could freely hop on her phone with zero issues from her. There were no red flags. I trusted her.

Then she started staying late most days. I’m talking, seven/eight o’clock. She tells me she’s in the office, but I swear a few times it didn’t sound like she was in the office. When she’d come home, she looks worn out. I know what it sounds like, but it doesn’t seem like physical exhaustion. She looks mentally drained. To the point where she just crawls into bed and goes to sleep. I don’t want to even tell you how long it’s been since we were intimate, but trust me, it’s been a long while.

The last thing that’s pushed me into questioning Faith is the note. The other day, my car was in the shop, so Faith let me borrow hers. After I dropped her off at the office - where Blake was waiting outside for her - I drove the car to the gas station to fill up. While cleaning the windows, I spied a piece of paper wedged between the seats. 

Expecting it to be a receipt, I fished it out to discover a handwritten note. In neat, boxed print, it read, “Thanks for giving the proposal some thought. I think we’re both going to be pleased. Blake.” I felt my stomach drop. I know what it sounds like, but I also know that Faith had been talking about a potential job at work. She said Blake had pitched it to the higher ups and wanted to bring Faith on board. It’d be more work, longer hours, and potential work trips, but Faith told me the rewards were well worth it.

Am I a sap? Am I clinging onto the desperate hope that Faith has been true? Am I letting my brain get to me and red stringing unrelated acts into a conspiracy?

I guess what I’m really asking is: Am I overreacting?



9/3

I love Faith and, up to this point, she’s never given me a reason to doubt her. She’s been as loyal as they come. But I find myself doubting if she’s been completely honest. I love her so much and I don’t want to accuse her of something without having concrete proof. If nothing else, putting these thoughts to paper has made me determined to look a little closer.

I asked Faith about Blake waiting for her and she said it’s a habit they’ve gotten into. Blake read about “meeting your team members as they come into the office” as a way of strengthening the team bond. That sounded insane to me, so I asked for the book’s title to look it up. She hasn’t given it to me yet. Red flag.

I read an article about a suspicious spouse putting a tracker on his wife’s car and hiding an airtag in her purse. While I can see his point, that feels like a big invasion of Faith’s privacy. It’s something I’m not totally comfortable with. If she’s being honest and found anything like that, it would end my relationship. I love Faith. I don’t want to lose her if I don’t have to.

That said, it’s on the table.

Okay…the update. I kept the note in my pocket the entire day. Every time I felt it with my hand, I felt a pang of fear rush through my body. Faith had helped me through the toughest time of my life. She was my north star. I’m afraid what would happen to me if I found out she was cheating.

When she got home from work that night - her latest yet, just after nine - I stopped her from going right to bed and sat her down. She protested, telling me she needed to get some sleep because she was feeling drained, but clammed up as soon as I dropped the letter on the table. She sat in silence for a bit, and I swear I could see the gears in her head moving. It was like she was in a trance or something. I finally cleared my throat, and that seemed to snap her back to reality.

When I asked her about the note, she told me it was totally innocent. She mentioned Blake was very formal, and he gave similar notes to all the new team members. I questioned her about the phrase “we’re going to be pleased” and she chuckled. She said it meant with the results of the project. I asked why she’d be coming home so late and, like every other question, she had a ready-made answer. She said it shouldn’t be a big surprise. She had mentioned there might be some later nights. But she assured me it was only temporary.

I asked the thing that had been bothering me for a while but had been tiptoeing around. I asked why, when she comes home, she goes right to bed. No greetings. No TV watching. No questions about my day. And sex? Forget about that. She seems to recoil at my touch. I told her that when you couple all that with this new guy showing up and the sudden increase in late nights, it’s not crazy to assume something else is going on. 

Faith waited a beat, and I braced for a fight. Instead, she looked dead in my eyes and didn’t break her gaze. She said that if I was suggesting she was having an affair, that would be totally inappropriate. I said it felt like she was hiding something and was either afraid or unwilling to share with me. I said I’d like some answers or, at the very least, some reassurance.

Faith stood, kissed me on the forehead and plainly said that “I was being irrational and she wasn’t doing anything out of bounds.” She added that she “loved me and only me but wouldn’t stay up late fighting with me about my hunches. She needed rest.” Then she walked out of the kitchen and went to bed.

I sat at the table, floored. I’d never felt more dismissed in my entire life. What made it hurt all the more was that it came from a person I never thought would do that to me. I was furious. I slept on the couch that night.

Not surprisingly, I had a restless night’s sleep. My stress was bleeding into my subconscious. I had nightmares, but it wasn’t the typical scary fare. I would’ve welcomed that. Instead, I felt alone and confused and lost. I woke up feeling as bad as I did when I went to sleep.

Not wanting this fight to continue, I thought I’d try to talk to Faith again. Maybe I hadn’t been clear about how I felt. I wanted to let her know I didn’t think she was lying to me, but I felt like boundaries were being crossed with Blake. But when I went into my bedroom, Faith was gone. I looked outside and saw her car was gone as well. She went to work and didn’t even bother to wake me. She knew I went to bed upset, and it was like it didn’t matter to her at all. 

Blake would be waiting, after all.

That’s when I knew I was going to have to be more proactive if I wanted to find out what was really going on. I brought up Amazon and added a few items into my cart. I haven’t purchased yet, but I’m ready to. If she couldn’t be honest with me, then I’d find out the truth the hard way. I’ll post a new entry when I find out more information.



9/10

Okay, so, things have gone from bad to worse. I decided not to call or text Faith that day. If she wanted to talk to me, she could make the effort. I thought maybe my silence would help get across my feelings.

I was wrong.

Not only did Faith not call or text, she stayed out until just past midnight. I was a mixture of anger and concern. She’d been out late before, but never like this. Around ten, I finally broke down and sent a text asking where she was, if she was okay, and when she planned on coming home. She never replied. 

I sat on my couch, stewing in my emotions until I heard the front door swing open. I jumped off the couch and ran over to the door. Faith was a bit surprised to see me still awake. She smiled, said hello, and tried to give me a hug. I pushed her away and started nervously laughing.

She asked what was wrong, and I nearly shot through the roof. I asked where she had been and Faith said she had been working late at the office. I mentioned it was midnight, and working that late wasn’t normal. Faith just shrugged and said that it was quiet during those hours and she could get so much more done. 

I asked her why wouldn’t she wouldn’t call or text me to let me know what her plans were. That she had left without saying goodbye and stayed away all day. Without any trace of emotion of in her words, she said I shouldn’t be concerned because “we talked about this yesterday. I’m not having an affair. It’s just work.”

I snapped. I asked if she was out of her goddamn mind. How could she believe that her brushed off statement about not having an affair last night cover her actions for tonight? How could I come to any other conclusions when she left early, went no contact, and then showed up after midnight?

She sighed and said she had to get to bed because she had another early day tomorrow. Letting my emotions get the better of me, I asked if Blake was there with her. Her entire demeanor changed. Her posture got more defensive and her face, briefly, let her annoyance seep through. “We were working” is all she said, before walking past me and heading toward the bedroom.

My blood was boiling, and I knew I’d never be able to fall asleep. I hadn’t planned on doing this, but I knew if I stuck around, I’d insist on fighting. The way I felt, I’d be setting myself up to say something I’d regret. Better to just remove myself from the situation.

With my keys in hand, I left the house. I slammed the door behind me, though I instantly regretted letting my anger get the best of me. I shrugged it off, though. At this point, in for a penny, in for a pound.

After my impromptu night stroll, I quietly reentered my house. Faith had shut off the lights and went to bed. She, apparently, had no desire to fight either. I couldn’t blame her - no couples like fighting. Especially if it concerns a growing lack of trust.

I snuck into my bedroom to grab my phone charger and found Faith fast asleep. She didn’t move at all when I entered the room. I was about to leave when her phone chimed. Someone had sent her a text. I decided I needed to take a look at who thought a text at nearly one in the morning was a good idea.

It was Blake.

I pretended to close the bedroom door and stood quietly in the dark to see if she’d respond. After a few minutes, I realized she was actually asleep and not pretending. I walked over to her phone, opened it up, and read the text. 

“Dinner was splendid. Can’t wait for the next one. Sorry I kept you so late, but I think we’d both agree it was well worth it. B.”

I wanted to crush her phone in my palm. Instead, I took a photo of the message and scrolled through the rest of their communications to see what else I could find. To my shock, she had erased every other text between them. Big red flag. 

The anger and betrayal I felt was rushing through my body and making me unsteady. For a fleeting second, I thought I might have the first symptoms of a stroke. I looked down at Faith. She was as calm as can be and sleeping like a newborn baby. That’s when I noticed a faded purple mark just below her collarbone. It had a twin on the other side. 

Fuck.

Weird as this sounds, I prayed that maybe this was a little emotional fling and nothing physical. Not that an emotional affair would be any better, but if they hadn’t actually done the deed, we could recover from that. But staring at those twin hickeys on her neck crushed that dream. At that moment, I realized I hadn’t seen her naked in weeks. Who knows what other “war wounds” she had on her body?

I put her phone back on the charger and left the room. As soon as I closed the bedroom door, I felt the weight of the situation hit me. I plopped on the couch and started crying. I’m not proud of it, but it had been welling up in me for such a long time I knew it had to come out at some point.

Once I dried off my tears, I opened the Amazon app and ordered the things I kept in my cart. I had them delivered to my office, so she’d never know. Felt good to have a little secret from Faith. Two can play at that game. I’ll update when I get some new info.



9/20

Things have been rough at home. Faith and I haven’t spoken to one another in about a week. While it’s made me an emotional wreck, it hasn’t seemed to bother her in the slightest. She just keeps working long hours and avoiding any in-depth conversations with me. We had a moment where we actually joked about an old movie we both loved, but that moment blinked out faster than a dollar store light bulb.

Worse, I’ve seen more hickeys on her body. Now that I know to look for them, I see little marks on some of her exposed skin. She tries to hide them, but she’s gotten sloppy. She had some scratches along her neck. When I asked about them, she told me she fell at work. Yeah, fell on Blake’s dick, I thought.

Her personality has shifted, too. Gone is the carefree and loving woman I knew. It was as if someone had replaced Faith. When she came home late before, she would at least say a few words to me before dragging her exhausted body to bed. Now, if I got a “hello,” it was a minor miracle.

I’ve come to terms that she’s sleeping with Blake, and this marriage is over. At this point, I want to gather as much evidence as possible. I’ve started talking with a divorce attorney and am making a plan. A divorce would be relatively painless. We don’t own a home, nor do we have kids. My lawyer says if I can prove infidelity, I might even be due spousal support. I don’t need the money, but fuck it. If she wants to screw around on me, I’m going to take what I can get. I’ll use her payments to go on an amazing trip.

I’ve hidden a tracker under her car. It’ll let me know where exactly she goes. I know it’s not the office, because I’ve called several times when she was “working late” and no one answers. I also put an airtag in her pocketbook. That way, I can see where she goes when she leaves the car. Unless she’s boning Blake (what a dumb fucking name) in the backseat. I’m sure it’s a “splendid time.”

Also, I’ve been able to check her phone pretty regularly. Once she’s out for the night, a bomb wouldn’t wake her up. It’s like she’s dead. She must be coming home super exhausted because she used to be the lightest sleeper I knew. The texts between her and Blake are usually deleted by the time she gets home, but every once in a while I find one still in the hopper. They’re all the same - vague suggestions at their affair. No nudes exchanged or anything. 

The last text Blake sent her actually made me chuckle. It read, “The moment is approaching. I know you feel it too. Soon, we will be one.” Sooner than you think, buddy. 

Once I get some data, I’ll update.



9/28

Well, she’s not staying late at the office. Not surprised. According to the trackers I installed, she leaves work every day at five on the dot. Then she travels about an hour north to a place that I assumed was a hotel. But when I traveled out there, I discovered it was an old farmhouse. At first, I thought it was an Air B&B or something, but it looked abandoned. Maybe the inside is magnificent. I didn’t go inside, but from my car, the building wasn’t giving the most alluring curb appeal.

That said, the tracker from her pocketbook never left the car. That is, it never entered the building. Since Faith always brought her pocketbook with her, I was left with two possibilities: 1) she was lying about taking it everywhere and 2) they fucked in the car. I know the latter made little sense - why drive that far to just sleep together in the backseat of a sedan? The more likely scenario was they were so hot and heavy for each other, she forgot about the pocketbook altogether. 

I kicked myself for not buying the buttonhole camera and microphone. They’d been on sale, too.

The lawyer says this is all good information and shows a pattern of lying. However, it doesn’t prove infidelity. I’d have to get denial proof evidence if I wanted to get alimony. Previously, I didn’t care if I’d gotten anything, but the more this went on, the more I wanted it. I wanted to punish Faith.

The day I skipped work to visit the farm, Faith texted me out of the blue. “Hey babe, just thinking about you. Hope you’re having a great day!” I found it odd and was worried she might’ve somehow seen me out there or, worse, was tracking my data. I chose not to respond and see what course she took.

When I got home, I opened the door and saw Faith waiting for me. Surprised is too basic of a word for what I felt. She stood and smiled widely, showing all her teeth. Faith walked toward me and tried to hug me, but I weaseled my way out of it. She noticed.

Faith looked confused and said she thought I’d be happy to see her surprising me in the middle of the day. I didn’t take the bait and asked what she was doing at home. She asked me to sit, and we did. Faith said that she’s aware that things had been off between us and wanted to have a long, overdue chat to set my mind at ease. I asked her why she suddenly had a change of heart. Before she could answer, I heard our toilet flush.

I stood up and glared at her. I asked her who was with her. The door opened, and my question was instantly answered. It was Blake. He nodded at me and plastered on a fake smile. He extended his hand to shake, but I didn’t move. Blake eventually got the hint and lowered his hand.

I demanded to know what was going on. Faith, ever the counselor, kept a neutral face on during all of my questions. In a measured voice, she said that she could see that I was upset and that I probably had a million questions and that it was her hope she could explain everything. I leered at Faith. The sheer audacity of this woman was astounding. 

I snapped. I asked her on what fucking planet would I be okay with her being at my house with him all alone in the middle of the day? Blake tried to step in and suggest that the only reason he was there was to vouch for her story. I told him to shut the fuck up. Faith tried to calm everyone down because she could see I was getting a bit upset.

I laughed. I couldn’t help it. I told her they haven’t invented a word for how apocalyptic I felt in the moment. She acknowledged my feelings and said that I should remember that Blake was just trying to help. I glared at Blake and told him he could go suck his own cock for all I care and that they both needed to leave right now.

There were tears in Faith’s eyes, but years of counseling had trained her on how to keep a smile on her face when feeling awful. She glanced over at Blake and then back to me, before saying she “knew this was a mistake.”

I laughed again. I told her that this little escapade didn’t even rate as a gaffe compared to the other shit she’s pulled with Blake lately. My body and brain were humming. I ran my hand through my hair in a vain attempt to still my racing mind.

Faith lowered her head and, in a voice just above a whisper, reiterated that Blake and her were just co-workers and friends. Nothing more. There was nothing nefarious going on. Despite being threatened, Blake chimed in and confirmed Faith’s claims. I told them both to leave. After a beat, Faith stood and they both left.

As soon as they were gone, I did two things. One, I packed a bag and made plans to find a place to stay for the next few days. Two, I ordered cameras to hide in the house. Despite my mind racing, I clocked how comfortable Blake was in my house. I knew in my gut he’d been here before. I wanted to capture him here to help build my divorce case.

I’ll let you know what happens in a few days. Right now, I want to punch a hole in my wall.



9/30

It took two days to catch them at the house. Two. Days. I can’t believe it. They weren’t fucking, but it showed that he’d been over before. In the footage I recovered, they came in and sat at the table. They had a conversation but spoke in such hushed tones that my microphone couldn’t pick up most of what they were saying. A few words broke through, but, while I think I know what they’re discussing, the lawyer said it’s not enough. 

Blake had said “If he knows,” which, to my mind, is a pretty obvious admission. Faith had said, “how much longer do I need to wait?” at another point in their conversation. Again, to my ears, that’s clear as day. To a judge, though, perhaps it isn’t enough proof of an affair. Weirdly, at the end of the video, Blake stood up and looked like he was singing or chanting or something. I don’t know, because the mic cut out. There was a flash on the camera and it stopped recording.

Again, I should’ve bought the good cameras when they were on sale. Instead, I got these cheapos that screwed up when I needed them to work the most. Lesson learned for next time.

Knowing that if I wanted to turn the screws on Faith, I was going to have to get concrete proof that she was fucking around. So I’ve decided to follow them out to the farm tonight. I’d wait for the tracker to tell me they’re on the move and follow behind. I’d wait, snap a few photos, then quickly send them over to my lawyer. If he agreed they’d work, the paperwork gets going.

I’ll have time to kill, so I’ll update as this goes on. Join me, will you, as we catch my wife destroying my life…live! If I’m going to lose Faith, why not do it with an audience?



10/4

At around five o’clock, I finally got the notification that Faith and Blake were on the move. I hopped in the car and took off after them. I got to the farm about twenty or so minutes after they were there. Faith had parked her car in the long gravel driveway leading up to the dilapidated home. The tracker said her pocketbook was still in her car, but I could see she wasn’t.

They must’ve been in the house.

I made my way to the front door and saw that it was already slightly ajar. I pushed it open just enough to squeeze through and found myself inside the remains of a decaying farmhouse. It smelled horrid inside. A potent mix of mildew and rot. It was disgusting and I couldn’t imagine being able to get turned on in here. It’d be like fucking in a slaughterhouse.

Still, I listened for any noises that would indicate the horizontal mambo. There was nothing on the ground floor, but I still checked all the rooms. I came to the well-worn stairwell and hesitated. These things looked rickety, and I envisioned myself plummeting to my death after they gave way below my feet. I was going to skip it because I felt that if anyone was upstairs, I’d have to hear them, but then my ears picked up a faint moan. 

I froze. It sounded like Faith. I took in a deep breath and took the stairs as cautiously as I could. In fact, I kept my feet along on the edges of each step because I was worried the middle wood had rotted away and would collapse. 

I breathed a sigh of relief as my foot hit the top of the landing. I listened again for Faith’s moaning, but heard nothing. Still, I checked the first room upstairs. It was empty, and all I heard was the echo of my footsteps. The second room was no different.

The third room, though, that one was off. There was a line of white chalk or salt poured in front of the door. Not knowing what that was all about, I grabbed the handle to open the door and felt my hand sizzle. I yanked it back in a flash and waved it in the air in a desperate attempt to soothe it. I bit down so hard on my lips to stifle my scream I drew blood. The pain was nearly unbearable. 

After I came to my senses, I looked around for smoke coming out of the cracks. If the handle was that hot, there had to be a roaring fire behind the pine door. However, there wasn’t anything seeping out. In a slightly deranged move, I held my burned hand close to the door to see if I could feel the heat. I tried several spots, but the results were always the same: no heat. 

I backed away from the door. I decided I didn’t need to find out what was in there. Unless Faith was riding it, I didn’t need to know. I had come to into this house to catch her in the act, not play Robert Stack in the home version of Unsolved Mysteries. Finding Faith was turning out to be hard enough. Nothing made sense. I had heard her moaning, and I knew she was here. 

Where the hell was she?

As I approached the stairs to head back down, I heard Faith moan again. This one was loud and seemed to come from outside. I crept back to the room with a south-facing window and peered out. That’s when I saw Blake. 

He was standing in the barn, as naked as the day he was born, with a smile on his face the size of Texas. He was saying something, but I couldn’t make out what it was. From my vantage point, it looked like he was glancing down at someone just outside my view, and I knew it had to be Faith. On her knees, most likely.

I snapped a quick photo of Blake with my phone, but knew I’d need to get Faith in a picture as well. I spied a bush not far from the barn door and thought I’d be able to get a better look inside. The idea of witnessing my wife on her knees begging for Blake made me want to puke, but I thought of the trips I would take with her alimony payments and soldiered on. 

I’m heading for the bush. The night gives me excellent cover and I should be good. I don’t want to forget any details, so I’m typing this all in an email I’ll send to my lawyer. In case things turn south and Blake wants to get weird with me, I’m also sending along the farm’s location. Ya know, so the cadaver dogs know where to look first when I go missing.

Jesus, I’m too bleak for my own good.



10/4 Update

Okay, forgive me for rushing this, but I’m inside the bush and something is wrong. Majorly wrong. After navigating the stairs, I used the cover of darkness to exit the house and make my way to the bush. But as soon as I stepped outside, I heard what sounded like a choir singing from inside the barn. It wasn’t a recording playing on a speaker or anything. It was a live choir singing some ghastly song I’d never heard before.

This gave me pause. Were they performing for a group? When I parked, I had seen no other cars nearby and wondered where these singers had come from. Maybe they lived in the house, but that place looked like something you’d see in an urban explorer video. I realized Blake was into some freaky stuff and had swayed Faith to try it. She obviously took to it quickly, which blew my mind. I once joked about having a threesome and she was mad at me for two days. Now she was fucking for a live studio audience. It made little sense.

From this vantage point, I can see inside. It’s not great. Faith is nude and on all fours. She has these strange markings all over her body. I don’t know if it’s blood or paint or what. Blake has been circling her and occasionally hitting her with a leather paddle. I don’t think she minds. Every time it hits her skin, she moans and smiles. I snapped a few pictures of them together and send them off to the lawyer. If these don’t work, then nothing short of me shooting their sex tape will suffice. 

Faith and Blake seem to be into some weird shit. The choir I heard singing was standing about ten feet out from where Blake and Faith were at, singing that horrible song and watching the action unfold. I didn’t know if this was an orgy or if everyone took turns or what. Frankly, I don’t want to know. This seems like more than a simple affair and I don’t want any part of it. Blake can have Faith. 

I…oh shit. 

Sorry, I had to hide my phone. I heard a few people walking around outside of the barn. As they passed, I saw long, ornate knives hanging from their waists. They said that someone had been inside the house and messed with the “birthing portal.” I looked down at my burned hand and knew that I was the guy who had messed with the “birthing portal.” Great.

They also mentioned that they needed to find “the interloper” before “he arrives, blessed be.” I don’t know who he is, nor do I want to find out. I had what I came to get and now needed to get out before the roaming security guys made a pincushion out of me.

The singing inside has gotten louder and Faith’s moans barely registered above the din. There’s a charge in the air like a storm is approaching, but there isn’t a cloud in the sky. Despite the passing guards, my curiosity got the best of me and I tried to get a better view of what was happening inside the barn.

Faith had flipped over on her back and had ropes lashed to her arms and legs. Four masked men held them, keeping her in place. Instead of being afraid, Faith looked thrilled. Blake slowly circled her naked, splayed out body and poured some salt around her. As the grains hit the ground, he kept repeating, “pleasures of the flesh, pleasures of the soul, the project is complete, two will become one. Blessed be.” Blake was as hard as a rock while doing this incantation. Faith’s eyes follow his bouncing member with anticipatory glee.

That’s was my cue to leave. 

Faith had abandoned me and taken up with the weirdest group of orgy loving freaks this side of the Mississippi. Whatever fucked up BDSM, hump club Faith has gotten mixed up in is no longer my concern. She can let Blake slam her haunches with his paddle and whatever else, for all I care. He’s her problem now.

I can hear the distant rumbling of thunder and I swear I saw a few flashes of lightning. I don’t want to be caught outside in a bush if a major storm blows through. This night has been as hard as Blake was and I had no intentions of hanging around any longer than necessary.

The security team has moved away, and the path to my car is clear. With everyone preoccupied, I’m going to make a break for it. I’ll update you all when I get home. As weird as all this been, I find myself smiling. Soon, I’ll be free of all this nonsense. I can restart my life Faithless and far away from whatever the fuck this goofy shit is. 

Wish me luck!

I made it out. Faith is fine. Please do not look into this. Thank you.

That’s the last entry in the journal. It’s written in a completely different hand. Maybe it’s the lawyer, but it sounds too ominous to be from the guy’s lawyer. Maybe it’s Faith? Or Blake? All I know is that it’s killing me not knowing what the hell was going on at the farm. Or what happened to the writer? Or Faith and Blake, for that matter.

And what the fuck is a “birthing portal”?

If you’re reading this and it sounds familiar, please, again, reach out. I have so many questions. I hope you have some answers.
