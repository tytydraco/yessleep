I am an avid Urban explorer, and have been to many, many places. Abandoned Kmarts, Schools, Malls and ESPECIALLY Police stations. You can find interesting stuff there if you look hard enough. 

All the good shit is in the evidence and interview room. By chance you could find a phone, a knife and maybe even weed.

Look everywhere but BE CAREFUL, you could potentially set off security alarms. 

Take at least 3 people with you just to be safe.


I’ll tell you something that happened around 11 years ago. 

It was June, and the nights were hot and humid, most people were inside so we took the opportunity to explore somewhere riskier, as suggested by a friend.

F: “You think we can go somewhere new? I’m getting sick of the orthodox, boring stuff. 

Me: “Sure, Where do you think we should go?”

F: “Somewhere risky, like an old abandoned police station”

Me: “Doesn’t sound too bad actually..”

Everyone agreed and so we went. 

It didn’t seem to be guarded, but the power was still on. 

We couldn’t back down now. We walked 10 miles to get there. 

The interior felt dusty, and stunk of rotten wood. You could see that time has taken its toll; Exposed insulation from the ceiling collapsing. The odd few rat droppings and doors taken off their hinges. 


Of course, graffiti was there, lots of it.

Everywhere was surprisingly pristine, and we walked In every room. 

The custody cells were clean. 

One thing to consider is that the place abandoned a good few years. (Around 2005) 

My friend brought up; 

“Hey, you wanna go into the kitchen? Wonder if there’s mold building up inside? I dare you to touch it!” 

Me, getting startled by my friend’s eccentric voice abruptly cutting the silence, replied;

“Jesus, dude! The kitchen?”

F: “Yeah”

Me: “Sure, Why not?”

The kitchen was slightly dusty, and very empty, apart from a few utensils inside the sink.

From our prior experiences, we looked harder for random stuff. You never know what you can find in places like this. 

Looking in the most obvious places first, I opened A drawer that was near a blender, its jug shattered into lots of pieces on the floor. 

It was hard to get open, the drawer clearly sticky from the years it has been untouched,  there were things inside as they rattled around, sounded like pens, pins and something more plastic. 

With one big pull, it opened, and I saw paperclips, lots of pens, a few batteries and a dusty cassette tape.

We never found something like that before, my friend being an audiophile, was curious, so I wiped it. 

“85102”, was written on the peeling off label. 

It was getting extremely late at this point, so we walked home. 

First thing we did, was get the cassette decl out, and play it. 

*tape starts*



A: “Here’s a bag, for your uhhh… problems…”

B: “Thank you. *sighs* it doesn’t seem to be getting any better. Everything you tried isn’t working”

A male and a female voice spoke, age related damage distorting the audio 

A: “I don’t know what to say, at all. Is there anything that will work, EVER? I tried morphine, fetanyl, hydromorphone and even carfetanil, every opioid I can think of. And still, you say your body won’t stop hurting, maybe you have bone cancer?”

B: “It doesn’t help. It never helps. You only get me more hooked. And no, I don’t have bone cancer.” 

A: “What do YOU think is the best option? You’re obviously in a lot of pain….. the only option sounds like suicide. It will get rid of the pain. Your body can’t move without you screaming. It’s practically eating you alive.”

B: “*laughs* oh you’re seriously going to say that. After all that, the tank, the femur peeling, you’re going to suggest I DIE, Just because you can’t help.”

A: “It’s the best option, the pain will leave you”

B:”yeah? Here’s some truth, it can never leave me. I’ve been dealing with this for FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS! *the audio distorts from the sudden yell*

*B appears to have snapped, and says something before getting cut off*

B: “here’s one thing though, it wouldn’t work because you can’t die tw-“

*the cassette cuts to some jazz music for the rest of side A*

*Click*

F: “What the actual…… holy shit.”

I didn’t have the words to speak…. It was simply the most unnerving thing I’ve heard.

There were different meanings to what B was obviously going to say. “You can’t die twice” 

 
Despite the previous audio shaking us up pretty badly, I went to go and turn the tape over to side B. A sharp, intense feeling of pain surged through my head, my lungs losing their oxygen slowly. Fell on the floor, tried to get up by getting on the couch and did my best not to pass out and die as breathing was getting difficult now. 

My head was pounding , my right eye felt like a sharp wooden stick with infected piss with every type of STD you can think of spike going through it and the back of my head.

Who knows how long later, I got up, the pain subsided, and the environment was extremely unfamiliar. There was just this river, an endless river, length and width,  with a dark navy blue sky.

All that could be heard was wind blowing around. 

I must drink, I need food.

Around half a mile through, something tripped me over, and a massive whirlpool formed, I fell, not expecting the at least 90ft fall.

Everything felt slow, and the impact of landing on a SHARP big rock, broke a rib and punctured one of my lungs. 

My lungs filled up with blood as I landed on a sharp, big rock. 

The “blood” was odd… it was gel-like and was black, with this glitter substance inside. 

The dark, devoid room changed into a beautiful jungle, 

the smell of the waterfall and plants. 

“Blood” filled up my nose and mouth.

I was starting to choke. It wasn’t runny enough to swallow.




Couldn’t take any chances and limped to the white door that was open, coughing wildly, the “blood” stickying the soft cotton of  my beige hoodie. 

The door opened, it felt light. 

And I entered the light.

Everything went white, and I woke up at home.

My friend doesn’t think we should listen to side B.
