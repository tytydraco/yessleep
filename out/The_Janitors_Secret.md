When I was 14 my parents and I moved to California. It was far from where we lived in New York. We moved into a small red bricked house in a small town. Everyone in the town was really sweet. A lot of the kids there my age went to the same high school. On the first day in our new home, we were greeted by our neighbor, Mrs. Sonya. She came in with freshly baked oatmeal cookies and talked to us about the town and everything. She told us she had a daughter my age named Sara, that went to Northbrook High school. Apparently everyone in this neighborhood goes to that high school so I assumed that was where I was going. Mrs. Sonya told me it’s a wonderful school for everyone and Sara loved it. After chatting for awhile Mrs. Sonya left and I finished unpacking all my stuff in my room. My mom enrolled me into the school a couple days later. I wasn’t excited to attend school, I was perfectly fine staying home all day in my room. I woke up Monday morning on my first day of school. They had stupid uniforms unlike my school in New York. I put on the plaid skirt and white button up shirt. I put my hair in a ponytail and walked into my kitchen to eat breakfast. I got some cereal and milk and poured it in my bowl. My mom asked me if I was excited for school, obviously not. When I finished my cereal, I hopped in the car to go to school. We drove out of neighborhood and I watched trees pass by us.

We soon arrived at the big school, with a huge sign that said Northbrook High. I said bye to my mom and walked out of the car into the big white double doors of the school. I walked to my homeroom class. I had received my schedule yesterday so I already knew all my classes. When I walked in, I sat in a chair near the back corner. I sat behind a blonde girl with a white tube top and jeans. She turned around and said her name is Sara. I smiled and told her I’m Nora. I asked her if her mom was Mrs. Sonya, I remember her saying she had a daughter named Sara. She said yes and we started bonding. We had basically the same music taste. 

She walked me to my next period. When we were walking to our next period, she asked me if I new the secret. What secret? I didn’t know a secret. I asked her what the secret was. She told me that there was a huge legend here about the janitor. She told me to never speak, look, or even get close to the Janitor, or bad things would happen. I initially thought this was a prank. But, when I asked her if it was, she got really serious and told me that it wasn’t and I should really be careful. I asked her what happened to the people who looked or talked to him. She told me that anyone who did weren’t able to speak about what happened, because they would either go missing or stop speaking.   


She said that nobody knew what he looked like, he always had something covering his face. But when students tried to look, they were never heard from again. I stood there in the hallway for a minute, looking around to see if the janitor was anywhere. When I got to my first period, I was a bit nervous. I was so curious on this janitor thing and I didn’t know if she was actually kidding or not. I asked to use the bathroom that period because the teacher was talking and talking and it was getting boring.   


She let me go and I got up out of my seat. I roamed around the halls for a bit, taking in every detail of the paintings of old principles on the walls and pictures of old students. I was walking around the corner next to the library, when I saw a tall man with his back facing against me. He had grayish green scrubs on and a cap with the matching colors. But, when I saw the cleaning cart infront of him, I knew it was the janitor. My heart dropped. I immediately turned around and ran away, I heard his keys jingle. I darted for my classroom. I went down the flight of stairs and made a right turn, walking into my classroom. I was out of breath. I sat back down and regained my breath.

The next day at school, I walked into first period. I set my bags down and got out my pouch to work. The teacher assigned us a google slide project. You have to make 10 slides about you and what you hope to learn this year, then at the end of the year we will reflect back on it. I didn’t have a computer at home or anything, so I knew I would have to stay afterschool and use the school computers in the library. After school, I walked to the library. I hesitated when I got close to the corner where the library was next to. I slowly walked closer and closer to it. My heart was beating as I slowly walked up. I peered my head around the corner, to see if he was there. I didn’t see him. I took a deep breath and quickly walked into the library. Now, you’re not aloud in the library after school hours, but I needed to work on this project. The lights were off since nobody was there and the only light was the daylight peaking through the blinds. Luckily the internet still worked. I opened a computer and sat down. I logged into it, opening my google slide presentation. It was blank. I started typing some facts about me, until a heard a noise.   


It was keys jangling. My heart dropped as the sound began to get louder…and louder… and louder. I hid under the desk, praying he wouldn’t walk in. The keys stopped jangling. I sighed. I heard the library door creep open and his cleaning cart‘s wheels squeak as he walked into the library. My heart was pounding so much, I think he could hear it. I tried crawling to the back of the library, under the row of desks, until I banged my head on the table. I sat there, still and quiet as a mouse. I heard his keys jangle as he turned around, walking to the tables. In a quiet, low voice he asked me if I needed help. He sounded kind of sweet, 

I was starting to think everything Sara told me was a prank. I told him yea, since I needed to get up from this huge desk. He gave me his hand, it was cold and veiny. I took it and crawled out from the desks and got up. I looked up to see his face. My jaw dropped, the janitor's face was a grotesque, contorted mask of horrors. His sagging, waxy skin seems to barely cling to his skull, hanging in heavy folds that twist into unnatural angles. One eye bulges grotesquely, staring unblinking and bloodshot, while the other is sunken deep into a shadowy hollow, leaking a thick, blackened ooze. His mouth stretches into an unnervingly wide, broken grin, revealing jagged, yellowed teeth that look more like splintered shards of bone. His nose is crooked and smashed as though it's been repeatedly broken, and wisps of thin, greasy hair hang limply around his head, clinging to his skull in patchy clumps.   


Dark veins, like crawling shadows, snake beneath his skin, throbbing and pulsating with an eerie rhythm, while the scent of decaying rot seems to linger in the air around him. When I catch a glimpse of the janitor's grotesque face, a wave of primal fear washes over me, freezing me in place. My breath catches in my throat, a cold, suffocating dread squeezing my chest like a vice. The world around me seems to warp and close in, the walls bending and pulsating as if they, too, are recoiling from the janitor's presence. A strange, high-pitched ringing fills my ears. drowning out all sound, and my vision blurs as my mind struggles to comprehend the horror before me.   


The janitor tilts his head, and a guttural, bone-chilling croak escapes from his cracked, split lips. Suddenly, my paralysis breaks, adrenaline flooding my veins, and I turns to run, my footsteps echoing in the eerie silence of the hall. But the janitor's shadow stretches and writhes along the floor, reaching out like inky, skeletal hands. Lights flicker and buzz violently, casting twisted shadows, and the air grows heavy with the acrid scent of rust and decay. As I sprint desperately, I hear his slow, uneven footsteps dragging after me.

I never speak again. No matter how much I try, no matter how many times I feel that familiar pressure of words wanting to escape, there’s only silence. The fear has stolen my voice, leaving me with only memories I can’t share. But sometimes, in the quiet of the night, I still can hear his keys jingling, right outside my window like he’s waiting.
