Hi, Something really strange happened to me a week ago, and I need to talk about it.

Context: I live in the apartment where I grew up. My parents moved out, and now I live here with my boyfriend (he’s a bartender and comes home late at night). The building has 4 floors, but there’s also a 5th floor with small rooms (for social housing/reintegration), so there are lots of comings and goings and new faces.

One morning, I ran into a new neighbor from the 5th floor while getting the mail. I just said hello. A few days later, at night, I started hearing light knocks on my door. Same time, every evening. I was scared but thought I was being paranoid. Until one night, I stood behind the door and noticed the hallway light (motion sensor) was on… but no one was in front of my door.

The next day, I got a DM on Instagram from an unknown account: “You live in [my neighborhood], right?” I blocked it immediately.

That same day, my boyfriend was home. We heard the knocking again, but this time I found a letter I had thrown away in the junk mail box — except now it had writing on it. “-Instagram account name- ‘message me if you want to have some fun or join me in the stairwell’ ‘22cm :)’”. I freaked out. My boyfriend searched the building but didn’t find anyone.

He then went out to pick up my medication because I was too scared to leave. Two minutes later, he texted me: “Send me a picture of the letter, quickly. A girl is going to knock on the door — let her in.” I had no idea what was happening, but I trusted him.

A girl showed up: red face, tear stains, mascara running. She came in, we talked. And then she said:

“The person who did all this… it’s my boyfriend. I’m sorry for his behavior.”

I was shocked. She explained: he’s obsessed with sex, cheats on her constantly (even with her aunt and her stepmother), won’t let her have a phone, and he’s 29 while she’s… 19 (they’ve been together since she was 15 — not exactly legal). Basically, super toxic guy.

She was stuck: he had taken her only set of keys and her phone. So I kept her at my place, and we talked for hours. Eventually she reached him, and he told her to meet him “in a place with no people and no cameras.” Creepy. She said yes to calm him down, left at 9:30 p.m. Around midnight she knocked on my door again just to say she got home safe.

The next day, she told me she had bought a train ticket back to her family in the south, thanked me, and said I had been her wake-up call to leave him.

And me? Once everything sank in, I realized: •	I had been stalked for days, •	I comforted the stalker’s girlfriend, •	and I don’t even feel safe in my own home anymore.
