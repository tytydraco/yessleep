It was the beginning of summer in Ohio, the weather had just stopped flip flopping between warm afternoons and cold rainy mornings. I was driving an old beat-up ford id acquired when I was 18 as a graduation gift. I was enjoying the drive on the back roads of rural Ohio. They were beautiful this time of year, a yellow filter seemed to layer a haze over the various fields of greenery I passed, the song of the cicadas like a quilt of sound reaching out over empty fields. I was heading out to a textile mill a friend had told me about. I’d been out of a job for about two weeks, the retail job id had previously had gone under, didn't get much but a boot out the door after the last of the product had been liquidated, the warehouse I'd come to known as a second home seemed so empty and silent on my last day there. I was excited though; to try something new, the hustle and bustle of customer service had begun to wear on me the last couple of years.  the textile mills name was Bees in the Basket, cloth and loom co., my friend had promised they’d take in anyone who knew how to use a sewing machine, they’d teach you how to do anything else on the job. The building was mostly known for repairing old boat covers and mass-producing bean bag chairs. It seemed like a chill place to work.  

Upon pulling up into the driveway of the old textile mill, big Betsy's tires swallowing the gravel into the large groove of her tires, I noticed what looked like an old one-horse town out behind the building, it looked forgotten in time compared to the mill. The mill itself had been recently painted a bright yellow, tasteful brown shutters over large bay windows, a field of sunflowers full in bloom off to the left, that must've been owned by some local farmers. The town behind was lost though, a water tower, a small school, and what looked like an old bar, all boarded up so long ago that the wood had aged to grey some falling off the windows. I parked the truck one of her belts whining as she slowed down to park. 

As I approached the building I noticed their logo a black graphic of a bee on a yellow board, a dotted line following the bee in a large circle, inside were the letters B&B in an ornate font. Upon entering the place it had the familiar smell of a large warehouse, id entered a large waiting area with normal padded office chairs you'd see anywhere lined up, there were a couple other people there, an elderly couple, a man in a brown suit and a janitor messing with what looked like an elevator. I approached the woman at the desk, who seemed absorbed in whatever she was typing, she noticed me and looked up. 

Politely she said, “Hello how may I help you?”  

“I called last Tuesday; I'm here for an interview.” 

She sat up looking excited “Oh, nice to meet you I’m Marice, we haven't gotten someone so young in some time, usually elderly woman, not many young'uns interested in the trades.” 

Marice started going through some papers in her filing cabinet, she pulled out a small pamphlet. “Alright ill need you to fill this out, and there is a drug test, if you head down the road about 10 miles, there's an urgent care there, they’ll take care of everything and send it down to us.” 

Marice handed me the pamphlet “you seem like a good kid I'm sure Barney will be excited to have you on board.”  

I sat down and started filling out the pamphlet, it was standard fair other than a few questions that stuck out to me, have you ever had any fear of needles, have you had any fear of the color yellow,  then back to normal questions, are you comfortable lifting over 25 pounds for extended periods of time, are you comfortable working long hours inside etc. Those two questions seemed to stick out to me, odd but not a deal breaker. Why would someone applying at a textile mill be afraid of needles? 

About a week later my drug test had come back and id gotten a call to come back in i went to talk to Marice she perked up seeing me. 

“Oh, hello young man, Barney is upstairs and to the left he’ll see you now, don't tell anyone but he seems excited.” 

I headed up the stairs the back of the building didn't have the flair of the front just brick walls painted white a normal office door with a fogged glass window. Barney was sitting behind his desk the only things in the office were a desk a fax machine, a coffee machine, and a sewing machine sitting in the middle of the room. 

Barney waved me over and held out his hand for a handshake. I shook his hand; he had a tight and slightly sweaty grip. 

Barney released me from the handshake and looked over to the sewing machine “sorry about the sewing machine, you don't have any training on it specified in your resume, just wanted to make sure you're comfortable with the machine.” 

I replied “sorry most of my know how is from my grandma, I haven't done it in any professional capacity, mostly just fixing dresses for my sisters or fixing up some old stuffed animals. I was told there'd be on site training.” 

Barney waved towards me in an assuring manor “We all got to start somewhere, just want to see where you stand.” 

Barney pulled out a spool of yellow thread from his desk, he sat it next to a square cloth with a fringe of black around the outer edge. “I need you to use this spool to make a square yellow box about three inches from the center of this cloth.” 

I sat at the machine and did the things the way my grandma had taught me I used the measurement tools on the machine to begin my stitch, and started the machine, it had been some time since the last time id used a sewing machine and I was used to my grandmas machine, but I felt I was doing good, I moved the cloth going with the flow of the machine, before I noticed Id almost finished the first stitch and was feeling good, the second stitch and third went just as smooth. I was focused and I had an audience, so I felt the need to do good work. The final stitch was going smoothly I felt almost like I was in a trance when I noticed a scarlet red color blotting on to the pure white cloth, I finished the final stitch but realized I had gotten myself. 

I licked my finger where the needle had gotten me. 

Barney chuckled “Thats a good job their son, The machine gets us all sometimes, you didn't freak out though. I've seen people pass out from the sight of their own blood.” 

I felt like an idiot, I needed this job and had made myself look foolish, the iron from the blood stung my tongue. 

Barney sat at his desk “Well I'll give you call in a couple days if we select you for the position, you did good though don't feel down about that little mishap.” 

I was angry at myself leaving that day, Betsy showed she still had some kick left in her tearing up those back roads that day. 

It had been about a week since the interview at Bees in the Basket, I'd had a hard time, I applied at McDonald’s, rock bottom I would imagine. My friend who had told me about the mill passed away he’d overdosed, he’d had a long battle with drugs, and he’d finally lost. It was hard facing his mother; I had walked that path with him once when we were younger, but our paths had diverged. He had gotten into harder stuff and id backed off I was never going to touch anything that involved a needle. My thought process was that he was a grown man and could make his own decisions. I wish now that I had gotten involved, but that kind of guilt always follows in sad situations like these. 

I attended the funeral with my friend's mother, watching a parent bury their child is heart wrenching.  They lowered him into the ground, and he’d never been dressed as nice as he was now a black suit and tie. The whole situation was mildly grandiose he would have hated it; his hair was parted to one side completely different from how I had always known him, with his messy bed head covered by a Carhart beanie. I said goodbye to his mother as I was leaving, she gave me a limp hug, her tears wetting my shoulder. 

I woke up late the next day me and couple friends had been out drinking in my friend's honor, stupid and bullish but a traditional way for the midwestern to mourn. Doing burn outs around a bonfire and falling asleep under the stars unpolluted by the inner city's light pollution can be beautiful in the moment but painful in the morning. I woke up around noon and wiped some gravel off my exposed back my shirt being pulled up about halfway. I noticed id had two missed calls one at six thirty, and one at ten both were from Bee’s in the Basket. I fumbled with my phone the mid-day sun piercing my eyes and called them back. Marice answered the phone. 

“Hello Bee’s in the Basket, is this a personal project, or business related?” 

I replied groggily “I had an interview a week or so ago, you guys called earlier, but I missed them. I was dealing with a family issue.” 

I heard some loud typing on Marice's end “Oh no problem sweetheart, do you have time to come in today sometime before five o’clock, so we can get you worked in to the schedule, and iron out some details like your banking info and such?” 

“I got the job.” I replied confused. 

Marice seemed chipper “Yes of course honey, Barney was very impressed by your interview. Sorry it took so long to get back to you, your drug test took a while to get back must have been lost in the mail.” 

I was excited, I had been worried about the drug test, id smoked some weed with friends two weeks before, let alone how bad I’d felt the interview went. 

“I’ll be there in 45 minutes, thank you both, this means a lot to me.” I replied feeling a sort of relief fall over me, it was nice to have something work out for me considering the week I'd had. 

“Ok darling well be here and were glad to have you.” Marice hung up the phone. 

I went into my friend's bathroom and gave myself a whore's bath, threw some water on myself wet down my nested hair and borrowed some of his body spray. I hopped in Ol Betsy and spent some rubber flooring it to the mill. 

I’d been working at Bee’s in the Basket for about six months, summer had left us all behind and the Ohio chaos had begun. It was November and the weather swapped between a baron grey landscape of naked trees and dead fields at seventy degrees and a snow scape with a thin layer of white like a sheet blanketed over the backdrop of the once flourishing farmland. Bee’s in the Basket stayed the same though no matter the background, a large yellow building with a monotonous fog obscuring the forgotten town behind it. 

My time at the mill was uneventful, my coworkers were mostly elderly women who seemed like they’d been working there for a while. They were all obviously more tenured than me. They mostly kept to themselves; I had no doubt they gossiped amongst themselves, but I wasn’t making any waves. My days were spent fixing patches in boat covers and I found I enjoyed the sewing more than I thought I would. It felt like a connection to my grandma who had passed slightly after I finished high school. I thought at least this would make her proud. The money was good, and it was a full-time job. I was doing better than I had in some time. I stopped by my friend's grave twice both times felt overwhelming. Just before he passed, he’d helped set me up and got me out of bad situation. I wondered how he even found out about Bee’s in the Basket. It was so out of the way, an odd find. 

After the second visit to his grave, I spent some time with some of our mutual friends at a bon fire at their house. This mutual friend lived out on some old farmland he’d never moved out of his parent’s house. He just helped around the farm, so he didn't have much to do in the colder months.  Me and him sat around the fire trying to absorb some of the warmth into our extremities. 

“You have any idea how Drew knew about Bee’s in the Basket?” I asked looking over and rubbing my hands together. 

My friend chuckled “He was obsessed with that place; he never told you about it?” 

I shook my head “He always made fun of me for helping my grandma with sewing and stuff like that.” 

I felt a chuckle escape me remembering Drew “Called me gay all the time.” 

My friend laughed “Yep, real homophobic bastard.” 

I replied squinting “I’m not gay.” 

He slapped me on the back “No no, he wasn't interested in sewing or anything. He loved these like local ghost stories. You ever hear of the stitcher?” 

I was confused Drew had never talked about any like that with me. 

“No, I didn't know he was interested in stuff like that.” 

My friend was looking into the fire “Yeh he was super into that stuff. In the 1930s There was supposedly a guy there who would fix clothes and stuff in that old town behind that mill and he was good at it. It being the great depression no one could afford his services, so he worked for cheap. He became a local hero of a sort for lowering his prices. Anyways a hard winter hit that town. Back in those days there wasn't anything else around nowhere for the townspeople to go.  

I interrupted “Aw man this reminds me of history class, you ever think about teaching after they fix your brain.” 

My friend waved his hand at me “Shut up and let me tell the story alright. Ok where was I? These people where stuck in a storm, they had no food didn't have clothes for the weather. So, these people were cold and starving like that group of people that got stuck on that mountain.” 

I interrupted again “So they ate each other scary.” 

He rolled his eyes “Do you want me to finish? you keep interrupting, sure sounds like your scared.” 

I replied, “Scared of some bullshit, I'm shaking in my size 12 boots.” 

My friend pawed at his forehead exasperated. 

I put my hands up “fine, fine finish. I’ll stop.” 

He looked off again “So there's more to it than them eating each other, so this stitcher guy would take the skin of those they ate, he made sure they saved the skins, made coats and boots and other things out of those they ate. Sounds fake as hell but Drew loved that shit.” 

I laughed “So Drew sent me to get skinned and turned into a nice fur coat.” 

He chuckled “Your Balding ass would be a Duster or something, no fur involved.” 

I rolled my eyes. 

My friend put his hands in his pockets “I think he wanted to get into the basement of that mill; he said those places were connected with underground tunnels. He probably thought you'd be able to get him in there after a while.” 

I spent the next couple of months working normally at Bee’s in the Basket I was doing well there. I’d gotten a new truck, and Barney had bought Old Bertha off me she was being used as a work truck moving boat covers around, Barney seemed to take a pride in her he kept her close to the main entrance when she wasn't in use. I’d been there almost a year, mostly I had forgotten about that story my friend had told me around the fire, just a goofy ghost story. I would occasionally hear that elevator ding while I was working. Barney would storm off cursing. 

“Marice that damn elevator is going off again “ 

Marice would reply “Oh Barney the repairman said there might be a draw somewhere in the building giving it power.” 

Barney would storm off “I’m going to get this whole damn building rewired.” 

Barney had put a lot of trust in me and had given me a key to lock the building up if there were any days I felt like working overtime to finish a project or finish cleaning up. 

I’d caught Barney during lunch sometime in May, I asked him about the elevator and why it upset him so much. 

Barney clasped his hands together “It’s a damn safety hazard, there's a basement floor down there, but it's filled with stagnant water. If someone fell in there I’d be up to my ass in lawsuits.” 

I tapped the table “Why not just have it walled off?” 

Barney looked at me “The city, it’s a code violation of some sort, can't even have it filled with cement. Why so interested?” 

I shrugged “You guys have helped me out a lot, I’ve got a little bit of electrical experience. I could head down there could be a junction box or something causing the draw.” 

Barney put his arm over my shoulder “No, there's no need for that, we got professionals who look into that kind of thing. I know I get upset but don't you worry about it.” 

I left that conversation content, it didn't feel like Barney was hiding anything, but it did bring to mind Drew, his final wish on this earth was to get into that basement and I had everything I needed to sneak in there. 

I waited a couple weeks till we had a large project a local lake had needed multiple boat covers to be finished within a week. The old ladies were throwing a fit but working hard none the less. It gave me the perfect chance to investigate that elevator. I’d finished two boat covers during the day and was working on a third. I told Barney I was going to stay late he thanked me told me to lock up on the way out. 

You could see the dark country night through the large windows that normally lit the sewing room floor. The darkness was an ichor like the whole building had been swallowed by the sea. The only light coming from the flickering tube lights hanging from the ceiling. I finished the boat cover and cleaned up. I made my way to the elevator. It was stuck shut and looked to be stuck between two different floors. I stuck my fingertips into the edges and tried to pry it open, but it wasn't budging. I leaned back and sat on the floor trying to come up with a plan of action. I’d sat there maybe 15 minutes or so when the elevator dinged. The yellow light above the elevator flickered and the elevator came to life. The elevator box moved erratically opening and closing leaving a small gap. I went and grabbed one of the metal push brooms meant to clean the sewing room floor. I pushed the broom stick into the small gap and managed to pry the door open just enough to push myself in. 

The Elevator was very spartan on the inside, mostly just caged metal a small grate on the bottom a yellow caution light flashing underneath. I pulled out a pin and opened the grate it creaked and whined like it hadn't been opened in a long time. I pulled myself through and fell knee first maybe four feet, in the darkness I had a hard time judging the distance, it was going to difficult to pull myself back up into the elevator. My knees were wet but there wasn't much more than a puddle at the bottom, a small channel of [water.as](http://water.as) I looked up at the end of what looked like a long utility hallway a caution light moving in a circular pattern. At the end of the hallway, I swore I saw Drew.  

I called out “Hey you stuck down here, need any help?” 

The person didn't respond. I stood up and as I did the person at the end of the hall opened a metal door and ran off. The door slammed shut, the screeching of the door was like nails on a chalkboard, the sound bouncing off the confined metal walkway was deafening. I walked down the hallway, it was the only path to take, I didn't realize from looking but the hallway was at a slight decline and was a lot longer than I had originally thought. The sound of my footsteps echoed it almost sounded like someone else was walking behind me matching my stride, I looked over my shoulder every couple steps, for an old utility hallway this place felt ominous. I figured the person I saw was my mind playing tricks on me, the place smelled strongly of iron, I figured there must be a significant amount of rust somewhere lower down. The door must have been set to a timer a slight draw on the power grid wouldn't be fully powering this area, Barney must have hired a craigslist handyman or something. I reached the end of the path and realized along with the declination of the path, the ceiling was also lower my head was touching the ceiling. I had to crouch to reach the door. The door itself was odd; there was a cylindrical hole with a T shaped handle on the other side, the older kind like you would use to open a sluice gate. I looked around and waited with hope that the door would open based on a timer. After about fifteen minutes I figured it might be set to an eight-hour timer like some of the old mines and I didn't have time. 

I felt along the inside of the cylinder, it didn't feel rusted at all, strange. There were some small holes along the inside of the cylinder I didn't understand what use there would be for them to be there. I slowly fished my arm through the cylinder, I was in an awkward position, crouched over my arm completely stretched out, I could barely reach the handle my fingertips brushing it. I had to take a knee and push my arm to reach the handle. I quickly turned the handle towards the twelve o’clock position. 

I heard a large thunk sound and the door opened as it did twelve needles shot out of the cylinder piercing my arm, my white shirt sleeve became speckled with multiple spots creating a webbed network of red. 

“FUCK!” 

The needles had stopped as soon as they drew blood, barely entering the skin, but it was still excruciating being pierced by so many foreign objects. 

“Fuck fuck fuck.” 

The needles remained where they were, my animal brain ignored the ridiculousness of the situation and was more focused on the fact that if the needles didn't retract, I was going to have to pull my arm and hand through the needles. 

The yellow caution lights in the hallway had turned red. I was starting to freak out. I'd been rabbit hunting before seen the leg of a white rabbit bone and sinew pure white invaded by red. The rabbit hadn’t gotten far dead behind the tree, but being trapped had given it the will to remove its own limb to survive. That old idiom, an animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to survive. 

“Shit.” I breathed mumbling. 

I started taking deep breathes to calm myself, figure a way out that didn't involve mutilating myself. I reached back towards the handle firmly grasped it and returned it to its original horizontal position. A large thunk and the door slammed shut screeching as it returned to its original state. The needles retracted. I had sunk to the floor panting my arm resting in the cylinder. The caution lights dulled returning to a yellow swirl. 

I removed my arm from the cylinder nursing it. Then made my way back to the elevator. I felt a strong need to get the hell out of the place. I jumped towards the grates on the bottom of the elevator smacking my ribs on the grates, the pain shot through me, but I pulled myself up. Light pierced the gap in the elevator doors blinding me. I pulled myself out of the elevator the sun was rising, I’d entered the elevator around midnight there was no way I’d been down there six hours. 

I shut the elevator behind me pushing it shut with the broom, locked the building then limped to my truck. My arm was leaking, and I’d remembered there was that urgent care down the street. It took me 15 minutes to get there riding the pedal, trying not to get blood everywhere.  

The urgent care was empty; I made my way up to the desk my head was pounding. The receptionist was absorbed in a book. 

“Hey mam, I scratched myself up a little bit working on my truck, I think I might need a tetanus shot.” I said trying to get her nose out of her book. 

She looked up “Oh. Yes, fill this out for me, I’ll let the doctor know your here” 

The receptionist scurried off and I filled out the form. 

The receptionist returned about 5 minutes later “Here let me take you to the doctor, sir.” 

I didn't have to wait long for the doctor, he came in asked me about the wound, I told him I was trying to get the manifold off an old truck at home and got my arm stuck. He poured some peroxide over my arm and wrapped it with gauze. 

The doctor spun towards me in his chair “The wounds are mostly superficial; you got pretty lucky. I’d say. I’ll still give you the tetanus shot just to be safe. You afraid of needles at all.” 

I rubbed my temple. “No not particularly doc.” 

The doctor walked across the room grabbing a packaged needle out of the cabinet. “How did that job interview go by the way?” 

I was confused. “Pretty good, I’ve been working there about a year. Why do you ask?” 

The doctor chuckled grabbing a small bottle. “Well, I know I’m not supposed to look, but there was a little Willie in that pee. Come to think of it, they never even sent me the ups packaging to ship it.” 

The audacity of this doctor was blowing my mind.  

“What?” I said confused by the whole situation. 

The doctor sat in his chair and pulled up next to me. “Don't pay it no mind, seems like they may have been impressed by you, don't look a gift horse in the mouth, or so they say.” 

The doctor flicked the needle. “Alright you're going to feel a little pinch.” 

The drive home was strange, the whole situation had me on edge. My arm ached and I was starting to digest everything that had happened. I felt eyes on me. Backroad drives usually calmed me down but at the moment nature itself seemed to be dancing, mocking me as it swam by. I should never have gotten into that elevator. 

I called in to tell Barney I wouldn't be in that day, I told him I’d hurt myself working on a friend's car after I left work. He was upset but told me to get better and not to push myself too much. I fumbled my keys into my front door lock, shut and locked the door behind me, stumbled to my bedroom and fell in my bed. The exhaustion hit me all at once my bed consumed me. I was laying on the quilt that I'd always had as the top layer of my blanket tapestry. My grandma had made the quilt for me when I was 6, it was larger than a king size blanket, she told me I'd grow into it big and strong. It was a white quilt, with deer head motifs stitched into it, green flowers bordered the edges. My eyes flickered as I breathed in the smells and safety of home, then I noticed something that had never been there before. A small yellow stitch was woven into a large square making a border around the quilt.
