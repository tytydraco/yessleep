I took this job because I was broke and out of options. That’s how they get you — when you’re tired enough, you’ll say yes to anything, no questions asked.

The ad just said: *“Night Monitor. $30/hr. No experience needed. Must work alone. No phones allowed.”* No company name, no details — just an address wedged between rusted warehouses near the rail yard.

They buzzed me in without a word. No sign on the door, no front desk. A man named Grant handed me a blank ID badge and led me down a hallway that smelled like bleach and stale carpet glue.

The room they gave me is the size of a broom closet — one metal chair, a folding table, and a black console about the size of a microwave. No markings. No brand. Just a volume dial, a green light that means the feed is live, and a big red kill switch I’m not supposed to touch unless I hear the knock.

That’s the only rule: *If you hear the knock, you hit the switch. Then write down the time. That’s it.*

They call it *“environmental monitoring.”* Nobody says what I’m actually listening to. Some nights it’s just static or wind that sounds like it’s blowing through a tunnel that never ends. Sometimes I hear dripping water echoing so deep it feels like it’s dripping straight through my chest.

At first, it was easy. I’d doze in the chair, jerk awake when it squeaked too loud, check the time, go back to fighting sleep. Easy money.

About two weeks in, I heard it for the first time — four slow knocks, spaced out so perfectly I found myself leaning closer to catch the next one.

I stared at the switch but didn’t press it. Part of me wanted to see what would happen if I didn’t. The knocks stopped after the fourth tap, like whoever was knocking decided I wasn’t worth it yet.

I didn’t mention it until Grant caught me smoking out back. He didn’t even ask why I didn’t hit the switch. He just asked, *“Did it talk?”* When I shook my head, he said, *“If it talks, don’t answer. If you hear it using your voice, that’s the last chance you get.”*

He didn’t explain. He just flicked his lighter over and over until his thumb bled.

Last night, the knocks came back. Four — then static — then four more, closer this time, like they were coming through the floor under my feet. Then I heard my own voice under the hiss: *“Help me. Let me out.”*

It didn’t sound like a recording. It sounded like me, but wrong — like someone dragging my voice out of a throat that hadn’t learned how to shape the words.

I ripped the headset off but I could still hear it — humming through the console, rattling my teeth. The overhead light flickered like the whole room was waiting for me to answer.

I didn’t hit the switch. I don’t know why. I couldn’t move.

Grant says if it learns your voice, it doesn’t need the feed anymore. It’ll crawl through any line, any wire. It won’t care where you run.

I’m supposed to go back tonight. The badge is still on my table. Rent’s due next week.

If you ever see an ad like that — *Night Monitor. No questions.* — don’t take it. But if you do, promise me this:

When you hear the knock, hit the switch.

Because once it knows you, it won’t stop knocking.
