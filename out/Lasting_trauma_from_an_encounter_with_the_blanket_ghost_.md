Background: on a church youth trip with about a dozen kids including our you minister. 


There was this church rally that was happening a couple hours away from the church I grew up in and the youth pastor took us on a youth trip, we planned on staying at the youth pastors parents house(was very close to the event). 


Once we arrived at his parents house we played games for a bit then went to our respective rooms to sleep. This is where the story gets freaky and I’m honestly getting chills just typing this. 

The parents house had a huge basement that had a separate room with a door. My brother and I decided to share the bed together since their wasn’t any other sleeping spots. 


We keep the door slightly ajar(not really sure why but I was like 12 so who knows) and I’m sleeping on the side of the bed that’s closet to the door(my head would be perfectly in line with where the door is situated. 


One important note is that my feet were slightly hanging off the bed(honestly can’t remember if it’s because I was sleeping lower down or if the bed was really short) at one point during the night I feel something lightly touch my toes. I sit up and look at the foot of  the bed and I see what looks like a white dog just sleeping( important note they had two dogs they were just the generic small white dogs) I brush of this encounter because my mind instantly attributed this thing with being the white dog. 



I start to fall back asleep, when this time I feel like something is legitimately pulling on my foot(not heavily kinda like a light tug) I again sit up and peer over the bed and I swear to you I see what(in my mind the image is still so very clear) appears to be a whole ass person laying in like a fetal position under a white blanket. Like I don’t know how to describe it other then it instantly looked like someone just decided to curl up and sleep at the foot of the bed with a blanket covering them. 



This is where it gets slightly more weird and creepy. My brain immediately goes “oh someone’s just sleeping here no biggie” which is odd because 1. Nobody would do that 2. That’s fucking weird 3. Why keep touching me? 


Looking back I think my brain was just trying to rationalize something disturbing into something normal. Then the fucked up part happens.. as I’m peering over the bed the thing legit stand the fuck up.. no joke. As I’m watching this thing curled up, it slowly sits up and begins walking over to my side of the bed(to give you a mental image it legit looked like someone under a white blanket just slowly walking to the right side of the bed) It gets to the point where it’s right beside me and I’m so scared at this point I start hitting my brothers arm to wake him up.

 The moment I start doing this the thing just walks out the slightly open door. I tell my brother(clearly pissed at me) that I saw something and it just walked out of the room. I’m crying with fear at this point so I force him to walk outside the room to make sure nobody was pranking us. A total of 20 seconds after this thing walks out the door we follow. And nothing. Two other guys were sleeping down there and they both aren’t the prankster types and both looked actually asleep. To this day I have a fear off my feet hanging off beds and I can’t sleep next to a door. I usually don’t believe in stuff like this but I honestly can’t shake the feeling of how I felt during that moment. Scares me shitless thinking about this to this day. And sorry for bad grammar
