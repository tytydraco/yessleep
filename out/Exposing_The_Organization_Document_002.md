Hello once again dear readers. I’ve finished typing up the 2nd Document, which is about the Dark Watchers, as mentioned in my first post. I must thank the rule stating everything is true, even if it is not. These stories may seem false, but understanding these things requires an open mind. We simply wish to send these stories out into the world, and it’s my job to do that now, and I must say I rather enjoy it.

Anyhow, our 2nd Document awaits below.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1: We finally reached the Santa Lucia mountain range, and we’ve already seen the Dark Watchers observing us from the mountains. We’re setting up camp, and I can’t wait to get up there and start setting up equipment. We think there may be some hidden, unwritten burial ground up in the mountains. I think that the Watchers are just ghosts, but a majority say they are something we haven’t encountered yet. Honestly, after the incident at the Minnesota facility with the Wendigo, anything is possible. I didn’t even believe in Wendigos until I heard about it.

Day 3: We got the equipment set up on a couple of the peaks, and we were surprised how little animal life there was. We also encountered multiple patches of dead foliage, occasionally even small portions of shrubbery withering. Perhaps such is the cost of the Watcher’s manifestation? I am a little worried about whether or not small wildlife shared a similar fate if they got too close…

Day 4: We might need to think outside the box. We couldn’t find the Dark Watchers on anything last night, not even the night vision cameras. We knew they were up there, we could see them looking down at us. Their eyes were… unsettling, to say the least. 

Day 8: We requisitioned some small wildlife yesterday to distribute along the monitored sections of the range, just to see what would happen. They should be here tomorrow, but they aren’t coming with trackers, so we have to individually set up tracking devices and cameras on them. Everyone was really annoyed with this, but I like mice so I have no problem with it. Kinda worried about them though.

Day 11: We’re done setting up the trackers and cameras, and we’re freeing the mice this evening. I have a feeling that something bad will happen to the mice though, I think they are going to suffer a similar fate as some of those patches of foliage.

Day 12: It seems I was correct. We found 7 mice corpses, in advanced stages of decay in small patches of dead foliage. Their cameras showed the small patches growing at a slow but steady pace, but without any observable source. As the mice approach these patches, they become sluggish, as if the life was being drained from them. I don’t think the Watchers intend to drain the life around them, but there is no denying that is what is happening.

Day 15: I’ve been reading some of the folklore surrounding the Watchers, and it seems like the local populace generally ignores them. It’s said that as long as you look away and mind your own business, they wouldn’t bother you. Perhaps the reason that it is mentioned that they won’t bother you is because something happened to someone who didn’t ignore the Watchers. I feel like we should pack up and leave, I don’t want to take chances. At least with most of the folklore legends they have obviously physical bodies, but we’re almost certain the Dark Watchers are like living shadows.

Day 19: Nothing interesting has been going on, but the number of Watchers are beginning to grow. They all stare directly at our camp. It’s really unsettling. I read a poem that described an encounter with one of the Watchers up close, in which the protagonist in the poem sees a Watcher face to face, and it looked just like him. Much to my dismay though, a group vote was held to decide whether or not we would move the camp up onto the mountain range, and the decision was we would move up there. I worry what happens if we get too close to the Watchers.

Day 26: We’ve moved up to the peaks. The Watchers stare us down during the night, and it's beginning to give some of us nightmares. Their eyes are like dual stars blazing in an empty sky, and their forms are much larger than they look at the base of the mountains. The tallest we’ve seen so far looked like it was around 11 to 12 feet tall. It’s only a matter of time before something happens to someone in the camp.

Day 28: I can’t sleep. The eyes haunt my dreams. No one is sleeping. Everytime I begin to drift off, I can feel them peering deep into my soul. I just want to sleep. Someone requisitioned some sleeping medications, so we should be getting sleep again soon, I just hope the nightmares will stop.

Day 29: Elizabeth was stargazing last night. I think she forgot she took one of the sleeping meds, because we found her this morning just outside of camp. A Watcher must have manifested close to her. Her left hand is completely withered. It’s just dead, she can’t move it or feel it. There is a surgeon on camp though, so she’s going to have it amputated. It’s been decided that no one is sleeping outside of camp anymore, lest a Watcher manifest too close to something vital.

Day 32: The nightmares are getting even worse, in fact you could call them night terrors now. People have begun sleepwalking, and we have no idea whether or not the sleepwalkers would come into contact with the Watchers or not, but everyone is now being told to try any precaution they can think of to keep themselves from sleepwalking. The Watchers are also beginning to surround the camp at night. I am thinking of leaving. I don’t want to know what fate I will suffer at the hands of the Organization, but I might just risk it.

Day 37: They came into camp last night. The cameras detected them too. They peered into our tents. Johnathan’s dead. Everyone’s tent is observed by a camera as a safety precaution. It walked straight through the little door-flap, and laid its hand on him. He just withered away. It turned and looked directly at the camera. It’s eyes… they glowed so bright. They shined like bright neon white stars. I’ve made the decision. I’m leaving.

Day 45: I’m packed. The Watchers are outside. They see everything from their perch at the top of the mountains. The stars are they’re eyes. No matter where I go, they’ll see me, and they won’t let me escape. I acknowledge this, and I will not let it discourage me. I shall not face the dark rot they’ve brought to my friends. They can try and hunt me, but I’ll be ready for them. This is Junior Researcher Adam Monroe, signing off.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

This has to be my favorite recording we’ve found. I want us to go look for this Adam Monroe fellow, I think he would like to join our group, but who knows he’s still even alive. I think the Dark Watchers are neutrally destructive, based on what I’ve heard from this recording, it seems like they can’t control it. I must also admit, I find it creepy that he proclaims that the stars are their eyes. Doesn’t matter though, we found the camp during the day, no Dark Watchers to find and hunt us.

I would like to thank u/ crazyace339 for the idea of looking into the Dogman of Michigan. We’re going on a little search to see if the Organization has conducted their research on the Dogman, and we’re hoping to find some more audio logs. If requested, I will document our expedition, and share it with you readers. Since I am participating in the expedition, it will be a few days before you receive our next document. Thank you for reading.

Until Next Time…
