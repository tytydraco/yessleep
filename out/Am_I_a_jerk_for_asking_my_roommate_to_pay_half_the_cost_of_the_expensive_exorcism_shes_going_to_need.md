It’s been a minute since my housemate decided it would be fun to [play a game](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nz6qy/am_i_a_jerk_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my/) in which we make a sock doll, partly out of human hair (ours), and treat it like a Real Boy™ until it starts walking around, and somehow assume this will all turn out well.

*Morgan Freeman*: “It did not, in fact, [turn out well.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ryj2m/my_roommates_creepy_doll_went_viral_am_i_a_jerk/)

We contacted a spiritual specialist called “PsychicDeathLady123” whose credentials include a paranormal PhD (short for Pretty Heckin Dubious if you ask me). She directed us through a series of rituals in which we [Burned the ~~Witch~~ Boo Boy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11t1v9z/am_i_a_jerk_for_burning_my_roommates_creepy/) And to all of you who hollered in the comments about how it is OMG TOTALLY COMING BACK—*congrats!* You’ll receive your official “I told you so” trophy in the mail. Now pat yourselves on the back and put those hands together in prayer—because boy, howdy, are me and my roomies going to need it!

Nevertheless, I’ll try to keep things light while recounting the events leading to my possible (but hopefully preventable) demise. Humor being my coping mechanism...

I've got a feeling I'm going to need it....

**Back in the Game**

First off, let’s get one thing out of the way: the sock doll itself has *not* come back. His ashes have remained ashes, his dust has remained dust. So for those of you who were wagering on his return specifically—sorry. The laws of entropy still apply, and in this universe anyway, combustion is generally irreversible. Meaning “Doll in the Hall,” or at least the doll part of it, is officially concluded. (Which leaves us just playing “In the Hall,” I guess. A truly cryptic game given my home has no hall. Oh well.)

The days following the game’s conclusion found us in a return to normalcy. Curt was surly. Karen was in mourning (“My channel! Why’d you have to delete my whole channel?” Gee Karen, I don’t know, because you summoned a demon and we’d all like to live to see another day?). Life returned to status quo.

To be honest, I sometimes missed those glimpses of Boo Boy trotting at the corner of my eye. I know, I know. You don’t have to remind me what was puppeting him. Believe me I remember.

It. The figure. The… demon.

I still see it, when I close my eyes. I see it, and I remember PsychicDeathLady123’s warning—“Images summon it.” I worry that as long as I remember it, there’s a chance of Boo Boy—that is, the demon that was puppeting it—coming back. Coming for me. I made the mistake of asking Curt if he thought it was gone for good, and he gave me a look I will generously call “displeased” and stormed off without a word. A couple hours later, Karen and I each received an email from him informing us that he will *not* be renewing our leases. While inconvenient, I don’t entirely begrudge him this stance. Karen and I brought a demon into his house that may or may not have been moseying toward his room to kill him when we caught it in the camera flash, so, uh… a bit peeved still? Fair.

(Do you think he’d react better if I offered to put an extra deposit down to add Boo Boy's demon to the lease?)

(I’m kidding! Obviously. Remember I’m a philosophy major—you think I can afford that extra deposit?)

Anyway, final bit of back-to-normal news, Binky is back with us! Yay! (People have been messaging me to pay the hamster tax. Ok, ok, I’ll pony—I mean *hamster* up—in the comments.) But as delighted as I am to have our little furry mascot back in our lives, Binky is, unfortunately, also the reason I am posting here again…

**Binky and the Boo**

So this morning, Binky bit Karen.

Now, a hamster biting is not exactly newsworthy. Binky is pretty mellow as her species goes, but does occasionally get in a mood. Especially if Karen feeds her too late, or picks her up too much, or if Binky just generally is feeling bitey. Happens to the best of us. But after the bite, Karen yelped, and then set her hands on the cage, staring down with such a wrathful expression I stopped in my tracks (I was bringing coffee from the kitchen to the sofa in the living room). I thought for a split second I might have to interfere. Then Karen turned away without a sound and walked into her room and shut the door.

Odd.

Very odd.

Under normal circumstances I’d dismiss the interaction as Karen also being in something of a mood. But after the events of the past week I was hyper-vigilant for anything even slightly awry. Karen’s normal reaction to Binky biting is to yelp and then scold playfully, often with video: “Guys, ohmigosh, Binky is being extra today! Binky, you wanna say sorry…?” She never… *not* reacts to something. Especially not to Binky, star of 80 percent of her content, and primary source of clicks (especially with Boo Boy gone).

Concerned for her, I knocked on her door. Hearing no response, I knocked again. Finally I opened the door, and Karen was sitting at her desk. Just… sitting. Staring. Doing nothing. Staring at her mirror on the vanity at her own face as if she didn’t recognize it.

“Uh… Karen?” I said. “Everything A-okay?”

Her head snapped toward me. Her lips curved up, but it was a smile at her mouth only. Almost as if the corner of her lips had been pulled up by invisible fingers. She seemed to struggle for words, before saying, “A. A-okay. Binky.”

“What?”

“Binky,” she said, rolling around the word in her mouth as if practicing it. “Binky.”

“Sure. Binky. She bit you.”

“Bit you.”

“Uhhhhh….”

“Everything A-okay.” She grinned and raised her hand, making the A-okay sign with her thumb and forefinger together.

Yeah, no. Cute. But this was clearly not A-okay. She was either possessed by Boo Boy, or else this was another attempt to start up a new channel in which she herself became the main attraction and videoed her jumpy housemates in a scare prank. I noticed that she was, in fact, videoing me, which lent some credence to the idea I’d wind up on whatever new channel she was making as some sap who got scared by her act. It struck me as very cold, that she’d do something like this right after all the creepy stuff we went through. Though Karen was nothing if not efficient in her self-promotion. But…

“Look. I’m tired. Can you just cut the act and be normal for a bit? And also… turn off your phone? I don’t want to be on your channel again, okay?”

Her smile vanished and she nodded, somberly. “Sure. Look, I’m also tired, okay?”

I narrowed my eyes. That… sounded more normal. But not *quite* normal. I held out my hand. “Can I borrow your phone?”

“Sure.” She picked up her phone and handed it to me, then turned away and crawled into bed.

“You’re… not getting up?” I asked.

“I’m tired.”

“Ooookay.”

“A-Okay.” She yawned.

JFC. I left her alone, but brought her phone out to the living room with me and began madly searching through her accounts for any trace of video or images I might have missed when purging Boo Boy from our lives. Nothing.

Was she just having an off day? On a hunch, I looked through my notes from when I was documenting all of Boo Boy’s antics. And I noticed a trend that I neglected to mention in my previous posts, where I basically simplified the data as “he moves four times an hour.” Which is true—on average. But at the beginning, the first few times I glimpsed him move, it was considerably less than that. And by the end, the day we ended the game, Boo Boy was in almost constant motion—walking every few minutes. Also, his motion got *smoother* over time. Now, I’m no PsychicDeathLady123, but if I were to hazard a hypothesis about *why* his movements increased in both frequency and dexterity, given what we now know about Boo Boy not actually being animate himself, but rather, being a puppet—I would have to say that in the beginning, the manipulating force was struggling to get a handle on him. Trying, from the astral plane or whatever, to just get the basics down of making stuffed socks move. And as its control became more fine-tuned, it became able to move its puppet longer, more often, and with more precision.

But that’s the rub, isn’t it? Boo Boy never came to life. Boo Boy was a puppet. In “Doll in the Hall,” who says the doll has to be made of socks?

**“Doll in the Hall”**

I spent all afternoon thumbing through Karen’s phone, searching her messages. It all *looked* normal enough. Nevertheless, I shot a message off to PsychicDeathLady123 asking what were the chances of Boo Boy’s spirit coming back without any sort of image to latch onto? And if it did, what viable solutions were there? Burning the doll was one thing; obviously we couldn’t burn my housemate. I was still scouring Karen’s accounts for any clues as to what might be going on with her when the late afternoon sun was coming in through the curtains. Curt had gone out early in the day and not come home yet. I considered whether I should discuss Karen’s behavior with him when he came home, but opted not to, on the off chance he actually did have a day job as a mafia hitman or something (never can tell, with that guy).

My eyes were bleary from scrolling through sites on exorcisms, hauntings, and possessions, when motion in my periphery caught my eye, and I turned my head.

Karen loomed over Binky’s cage.

My heart thudded. “Hey, Karen!” I called.

My heart’s tempo tripled when I saw something in her hand.

“Karen!” I yelled, leaping up. A small furry fluffball flailed in her grip. I snatched her wrist, twisting, and she yelped and opened her fingers.

Binky dropped into the cage, squeaking and rolling around in her bedding.

“Hey, what the fuck!” cried Karen.

“What were you doing to Binky?”

“I was holding her! Jeez! What the fuck did you think I was doing?” she snapped at me.

This was normal Karen. Or at least, she looked and acted like normal Karen. Certainly, her flashing eyes and snarl were the Karen I knew. “She was struggling,” I said, weakly.

“She needed to come out so I could clean her cage! She doesn’t always like being picked up. Christ, what the hell is wrong with you?”

“I just—you were acting strange this morning—”

“Oh my fucking God. I was *tired.* And you and Curt destroyed my channel. I’m pissed off. Jesus, can’t you leave me alone? Come on, Binky!”

I really didn’t think I should let her take Binky. But the fact is, Binky is *her* hamster, not mine. In the moment, I didn’t know what to do. Was she perfectly normal, and *I* was the paranoid one? I wondered, while sitting there in the living room, her phone still in my pocket.

Her phone. She hadn’t asked for her phone back in hours. Because she was still in mourning…? Or…

I waited, tense, pacing the living room. Fifteen minutes later Karen emerged from her room with Binky’s cage, freshly changed, and set it on the shelf. Binky was inside, fluffing up her wood shaving bedding. My pounding heart slowed with relief. Karen was obviously still pissed at me for even suspecting she’d ever hurt Binky. She didn’t make eye contact with me, and strode back into her room, slamming the door.

**AITA?**

So here I am, finishing up this post. I’ve gone through several AITA titles. AITA for thinking my roommate might be possessed? WIBTA if I arranged an exorcism for her even though she’s told me she’s “fine,” because that’s just what a possessed person would say? (It’s also what a non-possessed person would say. I have never, when asked if I were acting under the influence of demonic possession, said “yes” or “maybe” or “oh most definitely.” So I’m aware this metric might need tweaking.)

While writing, I’ve also been checking my phone for any responses from PsychicDeathLady123. She finally responded a few minutes ago—firstly, to tell me to just call her Marge (note that she didn’t actually claim this is her name, just that she prefers it to, “Hey, Psychic Death Lady”). She also asked for more info, so I copied and sent her most of what I’ve written. She replied back almost immediately with more questions. How is Karen’s behavior now?

I have to admit, Karen came out about ten minutes ago to microwave dinner, acting totally herself, and glared daggers at me when I inquired “How are you feeling?” Ok. Karen’s acting normal now. Does that mean we’re in the clear?

No. PsychicDeathLady123 aka Marge replied back that with the doll, there were times when it went inanimate. The thing puppeting it wasn’t there then. The same could be true for Karen. The times when the doll was inanimate are like the times when Karen is herself.

This being more or less my deepest fear about the situation (but also jibing with my hypothesis), I’m still sitting here trying to process it. Mind you, there’s a part of me that still thinks (hopes?) that this is all just Karen being Karen and messing with me for clicks, or something. But of course, there *is* one way to find out. One aspect of this whole experience that is unalterably *real* and forever burned in my brain as incontrovertible evidence of the beyond.

I asked if I should take a picture again, with flash.

Marge: NO. ASSUME SHE IS POSSESSED. DO NOTHING, BUT PUT THE HAMSTER SOMEWHERE SAFE.

(I forgot to mention Marge writes everything in CAPS. I’m not sure why. She’s an older lady, so probably just unaware of netiquette. Or else she wants me to vividly imagine her shouting warnings at the top of her lungs?)

I wrote back, resisting the temptation to tap my finger on capslock: I understand.

Marge: I WILL BE THERE TOMORROW. ADDRESS?

Me: \[redacted address\]

Marge: $500 FOR EXAMINATION $1200 CLEANSING $2500 EXORCISM, OR ALL THREE FOR $3500

Wow. What a racket. Her in-person prices are sky-high compared to her zoom consultations. I was pretty sure I was being taken for a ride. I almost wrote back, No thanks, but then I weighed my options: ongoing paranoia for myself and Binky and the possibility of an untimely horrific death, or one-time payment to a possible huckster.

Me: OKAY. THREE FOR 3500

I’m such an easy mark.

Marge: DONE. SEND HAMSTER AWAY. DO NOTHING TONIGHT. BE THERE 2PM

Me: I can’t wait.

My sarcasm was lost on Marge, resulting in an ensuing back-and-forth in which she asked why I couldn’t wait and told me she could be here sooner for an additional 2k, and I tried to tell her the definition of sarcasm. I think I just pissed her off. Anyway, she’s on for tomorrow. And now that I’ve typed this, I feel marginally better. I mean, I definitely can’t afford that much and will probably have to wheedle Karen into helping with the cost… which will be a very awkward conversation, if this all turns out to be a farce. (But hey, it should give her some great traffic for her channel, right?) But I mean, given I’m *already* buried under student loans, what’s another few years of my life paying debt? Who knows, after this, maybe I’ll switch back to the vet tech track….

Guess I’ll go drive Binky to Karen’s sister’s place and maybe then I’ll update this, or post it… or… I don’t know.

**Token:**

Shit. Shit. Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit I can’t think I can’t. Shit. I think I’m having a panic attack.

I shouldn’t have made all those jokes.

Do I leave them? Does it matter? Should I just delete this entire post?

JFC can’t think I can’t I can’t I…

Oh fuck. Okay. Okay. I’m just going to write it out.

I just found Boo Boy.

Not the doll. A drawing. A pencil sketch in Karen’s notebook. I’m guessing she drew it after we already burned him because its says “Boo Boy R.I.P.” She probably thought that a drawing, since it’s not an exact replica like a photo, wouldn’t count. God, Karen, how could you be so fucking stupid—okay, okay. It can’t help blaming her. But here’s my supposition (oh, let me be wrong! Please let me be wrong!): See, Boo Boy was made not just from our socks, but also from clippings from our hair. Bits of *us.* And Karen herself stitched him together. And… this is a bit me spitballing here… but… I think the—the *act* of creating him, of handmaking him, is part of what bound the entity to us. The players. Marge said an image could be used by the spirit as a substitute for the token. Now, a drawing may not have the exact details that a photograph has, but like the original Boo Boy, it’s handmade. Personal. This would make a drawing *even more powerful* as a substitute than a regular image.

Oh fuck. I just can’t, I—fuck. It’s a shame that Karen is so artistically talented. If it were me, we’d never have to worry about this scenario, because I can only draw stick figures. Any malevolent entity would be too embarrassed to use one of my kindergarten scrawls for possession.

… Ok. I’ve burned the picture. It’s gone now. I’m just going to post this. I… I shouldn’t have joked so much. I’m shaking. My hands are still shaking.

With the drawing gone, you’d think I’d be able to calm myself down, but…

Oh, but come on. You’re smart. You can guess as much as I can. I probably could have pinned that picture up on the wall, couldn’t I? I could’ve copied it and pasted a thousand of it all over the house. I could draw Boo Boy myself, in pen and ink or permanent marker or if I wanted to be particularly gothic and authentic about it, in my own blood, with bits of my hair pasted on for good measure. Heck I could make an entirely new Boo Boy, Boo Boy 2.0, and this time give him teeth so he could be 500% more terrifying. It totally wouldn’t matter. None of it would matter, because the *thing* doesn’t need Boo Boy anymore. It’s already attached itself to its new puppet.

Karen is the new [doll in the hall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
