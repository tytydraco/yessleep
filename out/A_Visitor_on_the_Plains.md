I woke to the sound of my dogs’ muffled barking.  Not the “I saw a deer and want to chase it” kind of barking, more the “danger is eminent and I want to be as intimidating as possible” kind of barking, laced with a tinge of fear.  This was alarming in itself, but perhaps more alarming was the abruptness at which their barking ceased.   

I sat up in my bed, knowing that it would be necessary to go out and check on them, and glanced through heavy eyelids at the digital clock on my bedside table.  2:43 AM.  What the hell could be outside bothering my dogs at 2:43 AM?   

It might seem normal to have your dogs making a fret about some nighttime creature, a deer, raccoons, etc, but this was the plains of western Kansas.  Endless miles of mostly flat, unsheltered farmlands, where whatever patches of grass sprouted were slightly yellowed from recent weeks exposure to the cold winter air.  Aside from the occasional coyote there just wasn’t much out here that would pose a threat to them, and they had never been bothered by coyotes before.  Coyotes typically see my 2 big boys, and sprint in the opposite direction. 

My father had left me this place about 3 years ago, after his suicide.  I had been living here for a little under a year.  A small, cozy, isolated farm that seemed to be uniquely prosperous for the area.  The environment had allowed the sort or “lack of human contact” that my father had always seemed to seek out.  He’d always been a quiet man who never had much to say, and we never had any real closeness or relationship as I was growing up.  Sadly, due to my life situation at the time, I didn’t see my father for several years before his death. 

To be blunt, until recently I was a complete failure as a son, and a man.  Growing up in western Kansas there isn’t much to do for fun or for a pay check, so a lot of folks turn to cooking meth, myself included.  This of course comes with lots of “getting high on your own product.”  After years of living on the streets and crashing in drug dens, I finally got my shit together in my late 30’s.  I was working a low paying, dead end job, and living in a dingy apartment, but at least I was clean.  Getting a permanent address had brought me the news of my father’s passing, and the farm I had inherited.  I doubt he’d wanted to pass this place to me at all, but my mother passed 20 years ago, and I was his only heir. 

As I swung my legs over the side of the bed, at the exact moment my feet touched the floor there was a soft, gentle knocking at the front door.  Three knocks of the knuckles, tap, tap, tap.  

I felt my heart racing.  I’m not what you would consider a brave man, but I shakily sprung to action regardless. I grabbed my dad’s old shotgun out of the gun closet on the way to the front door, and quickly chambered a round in the already loaded gun.  Before opening the door, I stood on my tippy toes and looked out of the window at the top of my front door. 

Underneath the glow of my security light, a man stood facing away from my house seemly surveying the empty, slightly frost covered lands to the south, barely visible under the faint light of the moon.  He stood maybe 15 feet away from the door, as if he’d simply walked away a few paces after knocking.  He looked to be wearing very old-style clothing, my best guess was that his clothes may have been a current fashion trend back in the mid 1800’s, and held a cane against the ground in his right hand.  His hair was dark, containing just a hint of curl, and fell just below his ears. 

I slowly opened my door, the hinges creaking with age, and hesitantly stepped out onto the porch.  The cold winter air was noticeable, but had little effect given the waves of adrenaline coursing through my veins.  I noticed my dogs sitting quietly at the edge of the security light’s range, and felt a slight bit of relief cross my heart. 

I tried to be casual and project with confidence towards this man, but I’m sure the cracking in my voice gave away how I really felt about the situation.  

“W-what’s up man?  Don’t get many visitors out here in the middle of -.”   

“I’ve always been good with animals,” came his reply, cutting me off as he continued to face away.   

I felt unsure about how to proceed in the conversation, as he had just pointedly ignored what I said, while rudely interrupting me.  His tone was also much too casual for a guy who had shown up at somebody’s house in the middle of nowhere on a cold winter night, which only served to further my unease about the situation.   

There were crazy folks all over the place, I’d dealt with a lot of them back in my junkie days, but the dangerous crazy folks were always the ones who spoke as if they had not a care in the world, nothing to lose.  That was the sort of aura radiating from this man, he had conveyed it all with a single line. 

“Do you need help?  Why did you knock at my door?” 

The man paused for a moment, continuing to survey the land.  After a good 10 or 15 seconds passed, he finally deemed it a good time to give what he felt was a reply. 

“This land has served you well, has it not?  You’ve only been here for one summer, but the beans and corn you planted thrived.  Thrived *curiously* so, wouldn’t you say?  Many of your neighbors lost entire fields due to drought, but not you, not here.  You may have not even noticed, the halfwit that you are.  You simply moved out here on a whim, put the seeds in the ground, and proceeded to ignore them.  I will tell you that most men have to give much more time and effort than you gave to yield a good batch of crops.  You don’t even deserve to prosper as you did, really, given what a stain on society a man such as yourself truly is.  In my eyes at least.” 

I was taken aback by his words, partly due to the retained fear I held from previous moments, but also due to the absurdity that he seemed to have paid me a visit simply to disparage my farming capabilities.  I didn’t want to admit it, but I had not, in fact, noticed how well I’d prospered the summer before in comparison to my neighbors. 

“Many years ago, a deal was made,” he continued “generations have passed, come and gone, and anyone who has used this farm has borne a successful crop each and every year.  You yourself have used the farm, and are now part of the deal that was made.  Yes, I know you didn’t personally agree to any sort of deal, but the time for not getting roped in has come and gone, and that’s just something you’re going to have to live with.” 

If I’d had a few minutes to think rationally about the situation, maybe I wouldn’t have believed.  I wanted to brush him off as a loon, threatened him with my shotgun the best I could and called the sheriff’s office in the morning.  That’s what I would have likely done, had he not turned around to look at me. 

He looked to be a younger man, perhaps in his late 20’s, with a pointed chin and larger than average nose.  The feature that stood out the most, however, were his eyes.  His pupils glowed a deep, dark tinted orange, like the color of an iron bar that’s been heated to extreme temperatures then allowed to cool, while still remaining dangerously hot. 

As his gaze washed over me, I felt slightly entranced, as if a calmness washed over me, and briefly abated the symptoms of my fear.  It was a curious feeling, feeling sheer terror in my mind unlike any I’d felt before, or since, but retaining clear ability for thought and motor control.  I had the brief thought that this is how he must have gotten the dogs to stop barking, some sort of hypnosis attached to those smouldering orange eyes. 

“What do I need to do to fulfil my end of the deal that has been made?  I get prosperous land, what do I have to give up?” 

The man smiled, “I’m glad you’ve so easily accepted your fate, some folks stay in denial, even after they’ve gotten a look at me.  Maybe you aren’t quite as much of a halfwit as I thought.” 

“All you need to do,” he continued, “Is continue to work the lands every year, you’re not allowed to leave.  All you’re really giving up is a touch of your freedom as a man.  If you try to move away, you’ll find me at your door once again, and I won’t be so cordial.” 

As the word “cordial” left his mouth, his eyes opened wide for a brief moment, and for half a second his eyes glowed more brightly.  Along with this brightness, several images flashed into my mind’s eye.  Visions of torture and death, of brains bashed in with a peculiar old-style cane, and the screams of pitiful looking victims experiencing their final moments in this world. 

Despite my entranced state, I still felt quite shaken, but eventually managed to choke out “Ok...understood, I’ll do what you ask...” 

“Great then, I hope we don’t meet again sir,” and with that he calmly turned around and walked away, leaving the glow of my security light.  He walked not up my driveway, but out into the darkness of the fields.  His faint silhouette faintly visible in the moonlight for several minutes as he casually strolled away. 

When he was finally out of vision, and no trace of his presence remained, I slowly came out of my entranced state.  The crushing fear returned in a rush, and I fell to my knees and vomited on the porch, but otherwise I was ok.  My dogs were also traumatized after returning to normal, and I let them stay inside that night, and for several of the following weeks. 

4 years have passed since the night the visitor showed up at my doorstep at 2:43 AM. I’m still here tending the farm, and the crops do well every year.  I have a nice little stash of cash, but nothing to really spend it on. 

Over the past 4 years, I’ve often wondered if my nighttime visitor didn’t fully disclose the conditions of the deal I’ve been roped into.  I feel so tired and so drained, every day I feel a little less vibrant, as if my very essence is being slowly stripped away as the years pass by.  I don’t know if this is some sort of direct draining from the visitor himself, or if the feeling of being imprisoned on this farm is the entire cause.   

I find myself glancing at the gun in the hallway closet every time I walk past.  Still loaded, still waiting for a round to be chambered.  I now feel a strong connection to my father’s plight, and what he must have experienced on this quiet, isolated farm.  I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.
