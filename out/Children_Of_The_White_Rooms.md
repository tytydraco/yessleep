IF YOU’RE READING THIS, BE WARNED. THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEAK MINDED. It has been brought to my attention that many of you have questions regarding the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ms6vy7/i_watched_tv_at_3_amthe_static_channel_had_feed/). The boy from that post is Pat. A decade ago, neighbors of Pat's family that lived in the Telechony suburb reported a bug infestation in their villa.

A few days of neglect later, one of the elderlies approached their house, finding their balcony window broken. He went in, and...came out screaming. Pat's parents were still in their beds, bugs surrounding their bed. The floor was dried blood.

I had nothing to do with this until a month ago, when a dump load of pagers greeted me outside my workplace in a large, black garbage bag.

At first, I...I didn't know what to do with them. I got in touch with an old friend of mine who works in the IT, and he told me to send over a sample. The pagers were the same as the others—white, numbered, with a text embedded on their bodies...*"I MUST GO NOW".*

A few days later, my friend got back to me. He sent a photo. I tried a few of the pagers, including the one I sent over. They were all empty, no texts, no messages. Wiped. My friend was able to recover the memory of Pat's pager.

The things that go on in this world without the knowledge of the many...I-I couldn't read past page 13.  
This post will contain Page 1 to 9...no more. No more.

If you have anything on the 2012 Telechony Kidnappings, please, help those children.  
Bring them home.

**PAGER LOG (PAT)**

**PAGE 1**  
I don’t understand how time works here, but it feels like a few days have passed. The tiles are white, the walls, the ceiling, even the tube lights are white. Nothing here is of color other than us. We have been given pagers to write while we stay locked up in our rooms. The pagers are white too. I woke up wearing white. Everyone here wears white. I’m not the only one here.

The last bit of what I remember is my parents’ room. I remember...tiptoeing into their room. With each one of my steps, I could hear my feet plop into the liquid that submerged the floor. I could feel it—lukewarm. I remember reaching my parent's bed. They were covered with blankets. It was cold that day. Their blankets were red. I didn't remember them having those. I lifted the blankets up, they were heavy. Under the blankets, the mattress was red too. At first, I thought those red pillows were my parents. Those weren't my parents, my parent's breath. Those pillows don't breath.

I don’t know what happened after, I don’t know what happened before. Strobing lights cover my periphery when I close my eyes, and then a stream of red liquid follows. They told me it was blood. They told me they did that to my parents. The timeline...doesn’t match up.

A while ago, before I started this day’s typing session, I was puking in the corner of my room. The white walls and tiles were splattered with yellow. I was relieved to see such color coming out of me. It made me feel human.

In some time, one of us will make rounds, and they’ll make us put these pagers in a basket. Today’s my day to collect them. I’ll be going around the white hallways, pressing the basket against the white doors, waiting for the white pagers to pop out of the door holes. It’s my day today to hear the whispers of the other kids here, some my age, some younger. They whisper about the red liquids I saw. They whisper about their dead parents. They’ve seen it too, the pillows. They’ve been misinformed. Our parents are alive.

A loud beep grates against our ears. It's time, I must stop writing here. When my door opens, making the same suction sound it did yesterday and the days before, I will be facing the white basket. It’s made of plastic, they won’t let us touch metal with our bare hands. There is a metal door near the great hall. It’s either an exit or an entrance. I hope it’s an exit.  
I must go now.

**PAGE 2**  
It’s the next day. A boy in a white turtleneck named #54 was crying yesterday. He counted on his fingers the time that passed, hoping to get a grasp of the hours. He seemed smart. Today, during the Assembly which takes place in the great hall, #54 smashed his pager upon receiving it from the basket. He wasn’t as smart as I had thought. Turns out, the metal door was an entrance. A person in a white raincoat entered from it. His movement scared a lot of us. I was scared too. He bolted towards #54, dragging him by his turtleneck into the space behind the metal door. His screams were audible through the closed doors. Most of us didn’t notice them because…most of us were petrified. The raincoat person was too tall. His hands were slender, long, twitchy. His voice was a deep gurgle of liquid washing down a narrow creak, like in those cave documentaries. He was taller than my father.

\#5 tugged at my sleeve before we dispersed. She was 14, a year older than me. She told me that when the metal door closed behind #54, his screams travelled upwards. She thinks it's a lift. I don’t know what to think. The white doesn’t allow me to think. #9 is standing outside my room with the basket, I hear him nudging it on the door.  
I must go now.

**PAGE 3**  
The loud, grating beep was given a name today. #1 refers to it as “The Call”. He thinks someone sits behind a mic and makes that sound. The beep is metallic, as if a woman hitting a pan on a man’s head. My mom didn’t care that my dad was bleeding after she did that. She stood there with her hand on her waist, whining about something irrelevant. My dad slipped to his knees, bent over, letting the blood drip down onto the floor. We all recognized that sound, somehow. We were all familiar with it. It plays twice a day from behind the ceiling—once when we must gather in the Assembly, and next when we must bucket our pagers before turning in.

Today, The Call rang thrice. It rang again during the Assembly. The metal door opened, and the raincoat man came out of it. He seemed less agitated today, not reacting to our terror of him. Some of us scurried backwards, some of us fell back. #41 stood still, he couldn’t move his legs. When we all had settled, the raincoat man brought forward a new kid. The back of his white shirt read, ‘#54.’

In a moment’s time, someone younger than me will be outside my door with the basket. Every day, a number pushes forward on the digital platform above the Assembly when The Call rings the second time. The digital screen reads the number that must collect. It’s become a routine now, we know when our turns will arrive.

In the Assembly, #5 tried to talk to me. She thinks the numbers on our backs represent the days. She made a bet—if she’s right, #10 will collect the pagers today. Before she could counter that bet, the metal doors had opened. The second beep has sounded. I wait for whoever will collect the pagers today. Tomorrow, I’ll write about it.  
I must go now.

**PAGE 4**  
It's been a day since we were given back our pagers. Yesterday, the raincoat man came early, before the first Call. He took the bucket with him, and a child. When the Assembly took place, #5 was missing.

Today, the pagers were returned. I was the last one to pick the pager from the basket along with the plastic wrapped plate of food with my number on it. We all took our pagers, yet one was left inside it. I picked it up. It read “#5” on the back of it.

I left my pager in the basket and took hers with me. I wanted to see why she was taken. The pager is void of any of #5’s messages, but it has writing on its body. Every pager does, other than the number of who it belongs to, the face of the pager reads *“I MUST GO NOW.”*  
\#1 told us to type that out at the end of each day’s session, and so we did. #1 is the oldest here, I’ve noticed. He’s been here the longest too. On #5’s pager though, unlike all others, the text has been cut. Below it, engraved in ink, it reads—*”RUN BEFORE 100”.*

\#5’s fingers were wrapped in bandages when we first met. We are all given a medical kit under our beds which have such supplies. Nothing sharp, strong, or flexible. Basic supplies. An instruction manual on how to use them is kept below all the medicines. I haven’t needed to use it. I’ve been eating the wrapped plates of food without asking for more. I don’t need the vitamin supplements inside the medicine box. I’m too afraid of running out of anything at this point, be it bitter tablets or choking syrups. I wonder if whatever we write in these pagers is ever read by the raincoat man. Maybe #5 wrote something that got her taken away. If I’ve written something like that, please, don’t take me. I won’t do it again. Please. I’m sorry.

\#12 is here.  
I must go now.

**PAGE 5**  
Today, #5 returned. I’m overjoyed. I tried approaching her during the Assembly, but I didn’t get the opportunity. The others had circled around her, asking all sorts of questions. She didn’t answer them, though. She must’ve been tired. Her eyes were wide, as if not slept for days. Her lips were chapped, her hair was disheveled, and she walked a limp, like those cowboys in movies, but she seemed fine otherwise. I wonder if I’ll get to talk to her tomorrow, ask her about the engraving. For now, she’s the only one I know here. The younger children don’t talk to me. They don’t talk to each other either. Some of us are teetering on the brink of something that the older children refer to as “Going #2”. Today, they told us about why they called it that.

Sorry, I had to stop typing for a bit. Someone knocked on my door. I tried to look through the door’s hole, but no one was there. Where was I?

The first #2 here, was a girl. She was smiling when she first came here, #1 told us. Her smile would die by bits every day, and by the time they had lost count of the time, she had stopped smiling, he said. She went to sleep in her room a few days later, and didn’t wake up. Her head was red with blood when she was carried out, as if she bludgeoned herself on the walls. #1 kept silent for a few seconds after that, until he scoffed, putting on a smile for all of us to see. He was on the brink.

It feels like the second Call is taking longer today than any other day.

…It’s been a while since, and The Call hasn’t rung yet.

What’s going on?  
I must go now.

**PAGE 6**  
I typed a lot yesterday, but it seems to have been corrupted. I can’t find the full texts anywhere in the pager’s memory. Two of the children were wheeled out of their rooms yesterday. #1 was one of them. An alarm rang loudly, followed by the suction noises of the doors opening. Every door had been opened, mine included. The metal door opened too, and four people in gray raincoats with stretchers rushed out of the lift. We stood at our doors, peeking out to see what was going on. No one had the guts to rush into the open metal doors, or even try putting a leg out of our rooms. Two raincoats went into #1’s room, two others went into #52’s. The sounds of grunting were heard, as if attempting to lift something and failing to do so. Then, a body was wheeled out of #1’s room, a limp body with red smeared across the white clothing. I couldn’t see the number of the body, but today in the assembly, #1 wasn’t here. A moment after #1 was wheeled out, #52 followed. Rumor was, they had an appointment with the raincoats. They had gone #2.

Today, in the Assembly, I approached #5. I was the only one that did, no one else dared to. Her hand was twitching. I tried asking her what happened, but she didn’t reply. I asked her about what she meant by the engraved text on the pager, and when I did, she turned her head towards me. She looked at me. Her eyebrows pulled towards her nose. She was disgusted. You did something to her. I won’t forgive you. I must go now.

Today, a count took place. I didn’t approach #5 during the Assembly, it felt as if she didn’t want me to. We were made to stand in a circle, as the raincoat man ran his hand across our backs, taking count. He moved his hand quickly, taking breaks where the girls were. The total count came out as sixty-four. There were sixty-four children left. “Soon….” The raincoat man gurgled. “...You’ll be making a few more friends.” He said, standing near #5, his hands twitching. He turned around to leave, and so his twitching stopped. One thing #5 had noticed back then, when she was herself, was that a flash of light penetrates the slit in the metal door whenever the lift goes up. When the raincoat man entered the lift this time, closing the metal door behind him, there was no light. He didn’t leave. He was still there.

Once the raincoat was out of sight, we all dispersed. I had stayed for a bit, tracking back to the previous few seconds assuming I had missed it—the light. Eventually, I turned around and went back to my room. The sound of suction meant the doors were now closed. I shouldn’t have turned around.

When I first woke up here, 15 days ago, I was made aware about the group chat in the pager. For the first few days, I kept myself on it, reading through the texts the children wrote about. The highest record of texts came from #1, and then #12. It shuffled around that way. The group chat wasn’t necessarily to chat with each other, it was like a common room, where the children sent their daily page for others to read. You could keep the option on, or you could keep it off. One of the reasons the new children kept their distance from me was that I kept mine off. They didn’t know me. I didn’t care.

The 2nd Call has rung. #15 will be on basket duty today.  
I think I understand what #5’s engraving meant.  
I’ll talk to you about it tomorrow.  
I must go now.

**PAGE 7**  
\#5 didn’t come out for Assembly today. Many of us gathered in front of her room, wondering why a sign was stuck to it that read “Plagued”. We all looked at the older ones. They tried to smile. They were hiding something.

At the Assembly today, seventeen new faces were brought down the lift. The raincoat man was different, his hand wasn’t twitching. He seemed more bulky, less tall. He was more rough with the girls than the previous one, as if the gender didn’t matter. The previous one was more polite, I thought. The numbers shifted. Seventeen new faces meant seventeen shifts in the numberings. Our numbers were assigned as per age, eldest to youngest. I was number 8, eighth oldest there. I wasn’t there the eighth longest, just meant I was older in age. It was time to assign numbers. The metal door opened, and the other raincoat man entered with a trolley. He was the tall one, the polite one, I thought.

The trolley was filled with new clothes, all white, with numbers expanding from sixty-five to eighty-two. The remaining children who got an already assigned number were to exchange clothes. We were then asked to take them off—our clothes. We did. My number shifted from #8 to #7, and the ones above me went one place higher. #2 went #1. #5 went #4. The rest shuffled their clothes around, while the raincoats inspected us. The tall one helped move the clothes around, while escorting the girls to their new positions while they dressed. The bulky one did so for the boys. Whenever I would look at the tall one, I would feel an unease in my chest. It was as if his hand only twitched around us, or specifically, around the girls. As if he’s holding something back. Holding himself back.

Our rooms changed in the same way—I got #7’s room, and so the chain went on. We got a different meal today with our pagers. Our usual meals consisted of unsweetened fruits, bitter veggies, and spoons that smelt of old socks. Today, we had porridge. The new #8 took my room. She wasn’t very friendly. She was a new one, and became accustomed to our hierarchy quickly. She started posting on the group forum, her experiences, and some routine of hers for some reason.

\#5, who had now become #4, stayed in her old room. She was the only one who was allowed to stay. The others had to adjust accordingly.

What did you do to her?  
What have you done?  
I must go now.

**PAGE 8**  
Today, #4 attended the Assembly. She must’ve been very ill, for she wasn’t able to walk very well. Even during the count, she was crouching forward in a limp. The pain of whatever illness she had showed on her face—contorted. Her hair was disheveled again, like the time she returned from the lift. I felt bad for her, but she wouldn’t allow me near. I didn’t know how to help.

The count happened again today to maintain a strict count of the new and the old. The total was 82. The bulky raincoat man did the count. I must’ve been staring at him very intensely when he noticed me. He returned my stare, and I looked away.

Once the count was over, we could grab our food and pagers. I reached for mine while #8 reached for hers. We bumped heads while doing so. I had to apologize, seeing that she wasn’t in the mood to. She stormed off with her food and I was left searching for it in the pile of the remaining. The others picked their plates and returned to their rooms, while I continued to search. The last plate was #4’s. It was different from the others. It had an extra compartment, with a white dip. Was it medicine?

\#4 snatched her plate off the counter, storming off to her room the same. I felt a void in my heart. I didn’t understand. On top of that, I didn’t have my plate. Either they forgot to make one for me, or someone else took it. I returned to my room empty handed, with the pager in my pocket. Before stepping in, #8 saw me. I looked at her, and she snapped her head away from me in a grump while shutting her door behind her. I was once again, despite being alone, left alone.

The second Call has rung. Today is #17’s day, a new kid that wears glasses. I saw him feeling uncomfortable during the cloth exchange, many of us were. When he comes, I’ll ask him if he’s okay.  
I must go now.

**PAGE 9**  
Last night, #17 was on collection duty. He knocked on my door instead of scrapping the basket on its surface. I approached the door, opening the hole’s hatchet through which the pager was to be dropped. Before I could drop it, he pushed something through the hatchet. A plate. It was half empty, half filled. The number on it read “#8”. I didn’t sleep on an empty stomach.

The ones who wake up early notice that the pagers go up and down the lift. After the 1st Call, the lift door opens and a different raincoat than the bulky or the tall one comes out with the filled buckets. We believe that it happens every day, they take the pagers up at night to read, and drop them back for us to fill. That way, if anyone misbehaves, they would know. We don’t try writing anything that will offend you.

Today, the raincoat person was late with the basket. We stood outside in a circle around the platform where the basket is kept. There was no basket. Murmurs began among the numbers, while I stayed silent. I had no one to pitch my theories to. “Are they often this late?” #8 asked me. I looked towards my right where she stood. “...No.” I answered, she nodded away while scanning the others. “Thank you.” I coughed. She smiled, accepting my gratitude without words. We received our pagers shortly.

During the food distribution, a funny thing happened. There were 41 plates missing. No one had nabbed into the pile and pooled together the 41 missing plates, they weren’t there in the first place. I had a plate, with #7 on it. #8 didn’t. I was getting a grasp on what was happening, and so were the others. They were cutting down.

\#4 took her plate immediately, rushing back to her room. Seeing her hurry, the others knew why. A war broke out right then and there. I grabbed my own plate and rushed back, grabbing #8’s hand while doing so. She didn’t have a plate, and I could share mine like she did for me. Running back, I understood the situation better. 3 other numbers ran towards me, jostling at each other. #43 was one of them, who fell to the ground and rolled back. I grabbed the latch of my room’s door and threw myself and #8 in, pulling it to a close. 41 of the numbers that had their plates had entered their rooms, and so, the suction closed the doors.

The 40 that remained outside *(1 of the plateless with me)*, stayed outside. It was a deafening scuffle that took place there, in the hallway. And soon, the grunts of elbows and fists turned to screams. I couldn’t see what was happening, the hole’s hatchet doesn’t open until night. We could only listen to the sounds of animosity turn to fear as they bolted across the hallway towards the right end, away from the Assembly hall. The screams continued as we slid down on the floor. #8 had her hands covering her ears, whimpering as she did. Her whimpers weren’t audible, just visible—the sounds from outside were deadening. All of that, just for food.

The screams stopped. For a moment, the silence felt louder. Not a pin’s drop of sound could be heard. I stood up, with an ear to the door. Not a sound.

The doors haven’t opened yet. We ate the halves of our plate, and I let her sleep on my bed. I'm on the floor. The tiles are cold, they remind me vaguely of how I got here. It was cold then, too. I sit in my blanket, knowing that today, no rounds will happen, no one will collect the pagers, and no one will talk about it in the group.

The silence from outside has plagued our minds.

We must stay silent.

We must not speak.

We must obey.

I must go now.
