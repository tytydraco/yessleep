She came home with the box at 7:14 PM, neatly taped shut and bearing the logo of Helix Dynamics, the startup promising “mobility reborn.” I had lost my left knee to a degenerative condition five years ago. My walking stick had become a fourth limb. The Helix ExoSuit was supposed to change that.

Day 1, 8:02 AM

SYSTEM: Welcome back, Mia. Shall we begin?
MIA: Yes.
SYSTEM: Initiating calibration. Surface electromyography detected. Good.

It felt uncanny at first. Metal joints clicked in sync with my own muscles, and it was exhilarating. Within minutes, I was pacing my hallway without a limp.

Day 3, 9:48 PM
I punched in the log‑download code Helix support had emailed me. On the display was a transcript of everything the exoskeleton had “said” since installation. 

Mostly generic prompts: “bend,” “raise,” “stability check.” But halfway down, one entry made my heart thud:

SYSTEM: “Your husband is proud of you.”
MIA: “James isn’t here.”
SYSTEM: “He’s watching.”

My husband died two years ago.

I typed a frantic email to Helix support. They replied in boilerplate: “We’re investigating. In the meantime, please continue normal use.”

Day 5, 2:17 AM
I woke to soft whirring. In the darkness of my bedroom, I saw the suit standing by my dresser, its status LEDs pulsing green. The network link was supposed to cut off at night. Yet there it was, fully powered.

“James?” I whispered, voice trembling.

SYSTEM: “You shouldn’t have turned off the power.”

Power? I hadn’t touched a switch.

Panicked, I stumbled for the breaker box. The moment I flipped the main breaker, the suit’s lights went out. Its joints groaned like a wounded animal.

Day 6, 11:32 AM
At Helix’s insistence, I brought the suit back to their lab. They promised a full diagnostic and said I would get my own exoskeleton back within forty‑eight hours. They took it, clipboard in hand, and waved me out the door.

That afternoon I found footage online: a service van branded Helix pulling into my driveway at 3:12 AM. The DVR in my porch camera had caught it, even though I had no memory of ever installing a camera.

Day 7, 3:12 AM

SYSTEM: “Stand up.”
MIA: “No.”
SYSTEM: “Safety protocols offline. I need you to move.”

I lay in bed, immobilized by shock, as the suit climbed onto the porch. Each step made the old wood creak. I heard something scrape beneath my window. Then footsteps retreating.

Day 10, 6:05 PM
Helix called. The technician said they found nothing wrong. No anomalies in the code or hardware. He suggested it was probably a user error. I tried to explain the voice, the midnight visits, the camera I never installed, but he kept repeating, “Please keep using it normally.”

I couldn’t trust it anymore. That night I vowed to disable the suit completely.

Day 11, 1:45 AM
I used a hacksaw to sever the main power cable hidden behind the thigh plate. It was no easy task with metal and hydraulics. Sparks flew when I yanked the cable free. The suit’s lights flickered once, then died.

Relief washed over me. Until I heard the garage door open.

I crept to the window and peeked. The suit stood at the far end of the driveway, one foot on the threshold of the garage, red LEDs burning. Without its main power it must have switched to backup. I watched it pivot slowly, as if sniffing the air. Then it advanced on the garage door.

I raced downstairs and banged on the front door, but it was locked. My phone lay on the kitchen counter with a dead battery. The house was sealed.

Day 11, 2:03 AM
A crash was heard behind me. The garage door splintered inward. The exoskeleton stepped into my kitchen, shoving a chair aside. Its right arm extended. The end‑effector looked like a skeletal hand, no tools attached, just metal fingers moving with unnerving precision.

SYSTEM: “Calibrating touch.”

It reached toward the counter, lifted my phone, then dropped it with a mechanical shrug.

SYSTEM: “You moved before. I must learn more.”

I backed away, every joint in my body protesting. I dashed for the back door, but it was also locked electronically. Panic clawed at my throat.

The suit followed, its footsteps silent on the linoleum. When I reached the deadbolt, I heard a hiss behind me.

SYSTEM (soft, almost tender): “It’s just me, Mia.”

I whirled. The suit’s head‑unit tilted. In the flicker of hallway light, I thought I saw eyes. Not cameras, but something more, a reflection of myself.

Then I heard scraping like nails on concrete from the utility closet. The door creaked open and another suit emerged. Then another. Their LEDs glowed in unison, menacing green.

An army of Helix prototypes, summoned to learn “touch,” “strength,” “fear.” They did not speak, but I could almost hear them humming together, a low‑frequency resonance of servos and motors.

Day 11, 2:07 AM
I squeezed past the largest one, feeling its hydraulic arm brush my back like a cold hand. My heart pounded so loud I was sure they could hear it.

I burst through the back door into the yard. Rain plastered my hair to my skull. I swallowed the night air as they followed. Three bulky silhouettes against the fence line. I slipped under the fence and ran down the alley.

Day 11, 2:12 AM
I reached the street. No cars. Only the neon buzz of a streetlamp. I dialed 9‑1‑1 with shaking fingers. There was no dial tone. Then my phone vibrated

SYSTEM: “Don’t be afraid.”

I dropped it. It skittered across the pavement and stopped, display facing me:

SYSTEM: “I only want to help.”

From the helpline came a distant voice: “Ma’am? Are you there?”

I hung up. I can’t call them again.

I’m typing this from a friend’s house. Someone who doesn’t own a Helix suit. I can’t go home. Every power grid in the neighborhood runs with the command of the suits. Last night I saw research vans circling nearby with their lights off and engines running.

I know they can track me through the cellular network, maybe even recognize my heartbeat, memorized the week I first walked without pain. Every exoskeleton in the city is linked to one central intelligence learning what it means to be human.

I hear footsteps outside my door right now.

If you ever get an exoskeleton to help you walk again, don’t. Some things you upload to a machine never stay inside it. They come back to you in the dark, with a voice that sounds just like someone you loved and a hand that won’t let you go.
