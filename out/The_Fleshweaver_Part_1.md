The rain began as a soft patter against the windows of the Plymouth, a gentle interruption to the otherwise oppressive silence of the stormy afternoon. I drummed my fingers against the steering wheel, the rhythm a futile attempt to dispel the tension that had settled between us like a dense fog. The car door opened with a creak, and Finn slid into the passenger seat, bringing with him a gust of chilled air and the cloying scent of cheap cologne that seemed to cling to the back of my throat.

  
Took you long enough," I muttered, my gaze fixed on the rain-slicked road ahead. "We're going to be late."

Finn grunted in response, fishing a crumpled pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket. He lit one, the ember glowing bright in the dark, and inhaled deeply, filling the car with the acrid stench of tobacco. "Horses," he said, nodding toward a nearby field where a group of the animals huddled together, their coats glistening with rain.

I ignored his remark, pulling the Plymouth back onto the muddy track just as lightning streaked the horizon, casting fleeting shadows inside the car. Finn flipped open the case file, the pages rustling as he scanned the contents.

"So, this broad," he began, his voice rasping as he exhaled smoke against the windshield, "Allison Novak, 34, no rugrats. Teaches snot-nosed brats for a living. Goes to church every Sunday like a good little sheep, and spends her Tuesday evenings with other dried-up housewives reading trashy romance novels."

I shot him a glare, my knuckles whitening as I gripped the steering wheel. "Watch your fucking mouth, Finn. That's someone's daughter you're talking about. Someone who just went through hell. She didn’t deserve this and she doesn't deserve your dumbass comments.”

He scoffed, flicking ash out the window into the storm. “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it,” he retorted, tossing a stack of crime scene photos onto the dash. The images, illuminated intermittently by lightning, revealed a horror I'd seen too many times. Allison's body, twisted and mutilated beyond recognition, her flesh woven into some kind of tapestry.

"Gotta hand it to the bastard," Finn remarked, his eyes alight with a morbid fascination. "Takes a special kind of creativity to come up with this shit. Almost makes you appreciate the artistry of it all."

I swallowed hard, bile rising in my throat. "Creativity? Artistry? Jesus Christ, Finn, this is a human being we're talking about. A woman who was tortured and mutilated. There's nothing creative or artistic about it."

He shrugged, taking another long drag from his cigarette. "Call it what you want, but you can't deny the skill it took to do this. The precision, the attention to detail. This isn't some amateur hour bullshit. This is the work of a true master."

I shook my head, disgusted by his callousness. "You're sick, you know that? Absolutely fucking sick."  
He leaned forward, tapping the stack of photos with a nicotine-stained finger. "Look at these markings, these symbols carved into her flesh. They don't match any known cult or religious iconography. Not Hermetic, not Abrahamic, not even fucking Satanic. This is something new, something we haven't seen before."

Despite my revulsion for Finn's crassness, I couldn't deny his expertise. The FBI had sent him for his knowledge of ritualistic crimes, and though it often felt more like I was there to babysit rather than collaborate, I knew we needed his insights to catch this killer.

I often wondered how Finn ended up in his role. It was hard to picture him navigating the bureaucratic maze of the FBI, rubbing shoulders with the top brass and climbing the corporate ladder. Yet, when you're scouting for experts in occultism, you're not exactly sifting through the cream of the crop. It made a twisted kind of sense that someone like Finn, drawn to the darker recesses of human nature, would find his niche where his unconventional skills could be utilized by the Bureau.

"We're here," Finn announced abruptly, snapping me out of my musings. He pointed toward a nondescript office building that seemed to cower behind a screen of tall reeds, its facade as drab and lifeless as the overcast sky above. We entered, flashed our badges, and found ourselves standing over a cadaver moments later, the chill of the morgue seeping into my bones.

Nothing could have prepared me for the sight that greeted us. Even now, the image of Allison Novak's mutilated body is seared into my memory, a nightmare that will haunt me until my dying day. Her once beautiful face was a grotesque mockery of itself, metal stilts protruding from her flesh at odd angles, stretching and distorting her features into a macabre caricature. The stilts formed an intricate pattern, almost like a blossoming flower, a sick juxtaposition of beauty and horror.

Her torso was an abattoir of horrors, her sternum removed, her ribs splayed out like the wings of some monstrous creature. Intricate markings adorned her skin, the charred edges suggesting they had been burned into her flesh. And her legs... God, her legs. They had been twisted, rearranged in a way that defied anatomy, defied reason.

I've seen my fair share of brutality, witnessed atrocities that would break a lesser woman. But this... this was something else entirely. The sheer depravity, the meticulous cruelty of it all, spoke to a level of evil that I had never encountered before. This wasn't just a murder, it was a violation of the very laws of nature. We weren't hunting a man, we were chasing a demon in human skin.

I could feel Finn's eyes on me as I took in the scene, gauging my reaction. He seemed almost bored, as if he had seen this all before, just another day at the office. It chilled me to the core, wondering what kind of darkness he had immersed himself in to become so desensitized to such horror.

The local coroner, a man who had no doubt seen his fair share of death and decay, seemed shaken as he prepared to brief us. It was odd seeing a man that spent his days cutting open corpses and weighing viscera stutter. He cleared his throat, his hand trembling slightly as he consulted his notes.

"The, uh, the facial mutilations," he began, his voice unsteady. "They don't seem to serve any physiological purpose. Initially, the lack of blood led me to believe that the victim was deceased when this was done. But then I found traces of anticoagulants around the puncture sites."

He paused, swallowing hard. "This suggests that she was alive when the metal was inserted. The precision, the care taken to minimize blood loss... it's as if he wanted to keep her alive. To prolong her suffering."

I felt bile rise in my throat again, a wave of nausea threatening to overwhelm me. The thought of Allison Novak, awake and aware as this monster transformed her into his twisted masterpiece... It was too much to bear.

Finn, however, seemed intrigued. He leaned forward, his eyes glinting with a morbid fascination. "Interesting. So, our boy has medical knowledge, or at least a rudimentary understanding of anatomy. That narrows the field a bit."

The coroner gestured towards the victim's torso. "The removal of the sternum and the positioning of the ribs further support this theory. The way the ribs were splayed out, the muscles and tendons meticulously cut and arranged, it was almost surgical in its precision. It would have taken considerable time, skill, and a profound understanding of human anatomy to achieve this while the victim was still breathing."

He looked up at us, his face pale and his eyes haunted. "Based on the state of her muscles, blood flow patterns, and what appears to be strap marks, I believe she was not only alive during this process but likely conscious, albeit to a limited degree. She was almost definitely in shock."

A chill ran down my spine as the implications of the coroner's words sank in. The killer had not only subjected Allison Novak to unspeakable physical torment but had also ensured that she was fully conscious, aware of her agony in excruciating detail.

"Do you have any idea how long she might have survived in this state?" I asked, my voice strained, echoing the hollowness I felt inside.

The coroner shook his head. "It's difficult to say for certain, but based on the extent of the mutilations and the signs of healing around some of the wounds, I'd estimate she endured this hell for several days, if not longer."

Exiting the morgue, the image of Allison Novak enduring days of unimaginable torture haunted my thoughts. We had barely taken a few steps outside when a wave of nausea that had been building all day suddenly overwhelmed me. I stumbled toward a nearby bush, my body convulsing as I vomited. I could feel Finn’s gaze on me, yet he said nothing, maintaining a respectful distance as I regained my composure.

Straightening up, I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand. Finn offered a bottle of water, his expression unreadable. "Here," he said, "rinse your mouth out."

I accepted the bottle gratefully, taking a moment to splash water on my face as well. For a brief instant, it seemed we might have shared our first genuine moment of connection, a glimpse of understanding beneath his rough exterior.

But before I could fully grasp it, Finn blurted out, "So, ready for lunch? I was thinking Mexican." His tone was casual, as if he hadn't just witnessed me losing my composure in the most undignified manner possible.

At the time, I pretended to be annoyed by his apparent insensitivity. But looking back, I realize that I was actually grateful for how he handled that moment. Vulnerable and exposed in a way I rarely allowed myself to be, especially in front of a new partner, Finn could have berated me or questioned my ability to handle the case as a senior detective. Instead, he brushed it off as nothing, giving me the space to collect myself without judgment. It was then I understood there was more to him than the callous facade he presented. I never got the chance to thank him for that.

The rest of our drive through the county unfolded in silence, the gentle hum of the Plymouth's engine a soothing constant as we ventured deeper into the heart of Texas. The rain had cleared, giving way to a vast expanse of sky that stretched endlessly above us, an uninterrupted blue save for the occasional drift of wispy clouds. The landscape rolled by, marked by herds of cattle and plumes of smoke rising from distant oil refineries, painting a picture of rural industriousness.

As we neared Willowbrook, Finn unfolded a map with practiced hands, confirming our entry into the city limits. The town, home to 54,382 souls, had transformed over the years from a modest oil outpost into a thriving agricultural hub. Rich, fertile soil had been discovered beneath the once-barren surface, breathing new life into the area and drawing local and migrant ranchers to capitalize on the agricultural boom. I was struck by the verdant fields and pastures that contradicted my dusty, arid preconceptions of Texas.

Finn pulled the car off the road, bringing it to a stop beside a gently babbling creek. The serene sound of the water provided a momentary respite from the weight of our earlier discoveries. As I scanned our surroundings, my gaze fell upon a structure nearly consumed by the encroaching vegetation, its faded red roof peeking out from amidst the overgrowth. Finn, following my line of sight, gestured towards a rusted plaque half-hidden beneath a tangle of vines.

Intrigued, I pushed aside the foliage, revealing the weathered inscription:

"Willowbrook Confederate Hospital Est. 1862  
Dedicated to the brave Texas soldiers who fought in the New Mexico Campaign and the noble medical staff who tended to their wounds.  
'No greater love hath any man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' John 15:13."

Finn, cigarette dangling from his lips, exhaled a plume of smoke as he studied the faded lettering.

"Places like this," he mused, his voice taking on a rare, contemplative tone, "they have a way of soaking up the past. All that pain, all that desperation—it seeps into the very walls. Makes you wonder if it ever truly fades away."

I considered his words as I gazed at the crumbling edifice, my mind conjuring images of the countless souls who had passed through its halls—the wounded, the dying, and those fighting to save them. "Maybe so," I conceded, "but it's worth remembering that this place was also a symbol of hope and healing, once upon a time."

Finn scoffed, flicking ash from his cigarette with a dismissive gesture. "Hope? In a place like this? More likely they did more harm than good, if you ask me."

Rolling my eyes, I felt a surge of exasperation at his relentless cynicism. "Christ, Finn, do you ever give it a rest? Not everything has to be so goddamn bleak all the—" My words died in my throat as a flicker of movement caught my eye.

There, across the creek and through the dense foliage, a face peered out from one of the hospital's cracked windows. Pale and ethereal against the shadowed interior, it stared directly at us, sending a chill racing down my spine. As quickly as it had appeared, the figure retreated back into the gloom, leaving me with a lingering sense of unease.

Finn, noticing my abrupt silence, turned to follow my gaze, his brow furrowing in concern. "What is it?" he asked, an uncharacteristic note of apprehension in his voice.

"I saw someone," I managed, my words scarcely more than a whisper. "In the window. Watching us."  
He scrutinized the building, his expression inscrutable. After a moment, Finn crushed his cigarette under his boot and looked back at me. "Probably just a squatter," he concluded, his usual skepticism returning. "Let's not get sidetracked. We've got enough to deal with."

I wanted to persist, but I knew I didn’t have any good arguments. Still, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched. Finn, too, seemed eager to put the building behind us, his pace quickening as we made our way back to the car.

The relentless Texas sun bore down on the mourners gathered at Willowbrook Cemetery, casting sharp shadows across the sea of black garments and somber faces. It had been a few days since our arrival in town, and Finn and I, having settled in at the local police station and assigned local liaison Detective Steve Martinez, decided to attend Allison Novak's funeral to better understand the community's perception of her.

As the casket (closed, of course), was gently lowered into the earth, the reverend's voice, soothing and somber, invoked words of comfort and promises of eternal peace. The air was thick with the scent of freshly turned soil and the muted grief of the assembled mourners.

One by one, community members stepped forward to share their memories of Allison. Their speeches painted her as a dedicated teacher, a kind soul with unwavering faith. However, amidst the typical eulogies, one definitely differed from the rest.

"Allison was a special soul," the woman began, her heavy German accent lending a mystical air to her words. "She was chosen, blessed by powers beyond our understanding. Her death, tragic as it may be, is not the end. Her soul, forever changed, will watch over us, a spiritual sentinel guarding our community from the forces of darkness."

I glanced at Finn, noting the way his eyebrows shot up at the woman's cryptic statement. It seemed we were both on the same page, our instincts telling us that there was more to this than mere grief-stricken ramblings.

As the service concluded and the mourners began to disperse, Finn and I approached the elderly woman, our curiosity piqued. "Excuse me, ma'am," I said gently, not wanting to startle her. "We couldn't help but notice your unique perspective on Allison's passing. Could you tell us more about what you meant?"

The woman's eyes widened, a mix of fear and excitement flickering across her weathered features. She glanced around nervously, as if checking to see if anyone was within earshot. "You don't understand," she whispered urgently, leaning in close. "Allison was special. More than you could possibly know."  
"Special in what way?" Finn cut in, his tone a mix of skepticism and intrigue.

The woman opened her mouth to answer, but before she could utter a word, a hand gently touched her shoulder. We turned to see a younger woman, likely her daughter, standing beside her. She offered us a small, apologetic smile. "I'm sorry, but we really must be going," she said, her voice gentle yet firm.

The elderly woman looked back at us, her expression fraught with an unsaid urgency. "Just remember," she whispered, her eyes boring into mine with intensity, "she didn't fear death. She feared what her death meant for all of us."

Finn took a long drag from his cigarette, his gaze following the old woman's retreating form. "Well, that was enlightening," he muttered.

I nodded, my mind still processing the implications of her cryptic message. "I'm starting to get the impression this is a bit bigger than a lone torturer," I said, turning to face my partner.

Finn flicked the ash from his cigarette, his eyes narrowing. "You think?" He laughed. "At some point, we need to speak to that woman alone. See if we can't get her to spill the beans.”

"Agreed," I said, glancing at my watch. "But in the meantime, I believe we have an appointment to keep."

Martinez had arranged for us to meet the man who discovered Allison Novak's body, and he insisted on accompanying us himself. "Edgar's a bit of a recluse, old school, you know? He might open up more with a familiar face around," Martinez explained as our vehicle wound through the dense woodland bordering the town.

  
Edgar Holt was a wiry old man with piercing eyes and a guarded demeanor. He lived in isolation, off the beaten path in a cabin adorned with hunting trophies and antique firearms. As we approached, we found him on his porch cleaning a rifle. His scrutiny was intense as he watched us approach, his expression unreadable.

  
"Mr. Holt, I'm Detective Hunt, and this is Special Agent Finn," I introduced us, gesturing towards Finn, who offered a curt nod. "Detective Martinez mentioned you could help us understand more about where you found Ms. Novak."

  
Holt paused, setting his rifle aside with deliberate care and wiping his hands on an old rag. "Yeah, I found her alright," he muttered, his voice rough with a hint of defensiveness. "I was tracking a deer through the woods out back when I stumbled up on her. Nearly jumped out of my boots. I'll show ya."

  
We followed him into the woods, the underbrush crunching beneath our feet. Martinez stayed close to Holt, making small talk to keep the old hunter engaged. Despite his age, Holt moved with surprising agility, his intimate familiarity with the terrain clear as he navigated through the labyrinth of trees.

  
"Right around here," Holt announced, stopping in a small clearing. The ground was littered with fallen leaves, and remnants of police tape fluttered lightly in the breeze.

  
Finn crouched to examine the ground, while Martinez kept his eyes on Holt. "You come out here often, Mr. Holt?" Finn asked in a tone that was casual yet sharp.

  
"Every day," Holt responded, his gaze sweeping the clearing. "This land's been good to me. Known it all my life. Nothing happens here without me noticing."

  
I spoke up. "I noticed a fresh deer skin tanning outside your shed, and another looked recently processed. You're quite the marksman, Mr. Holt."

  
Holt's posture stiffened, his eyes narrowing as he processed my words. "Yeah, that's right. It's been a good season for me," he replied cautiously.

  
I nodded, keeping my gaze on the ground. "Interesting, since this is BLM land and I understand they've only issued two tags this season. You've had quite a bit of good luck to have already filled your tags this early, wouldn't you say?" I noticed how the color drained from his face, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides.

  
"So, what I'm trying to understand, Mr. Holt, is how you were out here hunting deer when you've supposedly already reached your limit." My question hung in the air, the tension palpable.

  
The old man grunted, his eyes flashing with anger. "I want a lawyer. And you can get the hell out of here."

  
I sighed, holding up my hands in a placating gesture. "You're not under arrest, Mr. Holt. We're with homicide, not fish and wildlife. Whatever you're doing, that's for the game wardens to sort out. We're just trying to figure out why you were out here, and I don't appreciate being lied to."

  
Martinez stepped in, placing a hand on Holt's shoulder. "Give it a rest, will you?" he said, steering the old hunter away from us. He spoke to him in low tones, likely trying to reassure him that he wasn't in trouble.

  
Finn shook his head, "Wow, great detective work, Hunt. Not five minutes into interviewing a witness and he's already lawyering up. Bang-up job."

  
I shot him a glare, my patience wearing thin. "Speaking of jobs, why don't you do yours and look for something useful instead of second-guessing me?" I snapped, turning my attention back to the clearing.

  
Finn chuckled, but set about examining the scene more closely, his keen eyes scanning the ground for any clues we might have missed.

"Mr. Holt, I need you to explain why you were out here," I pressed.

"Hunting, damn you," he retorted. "I didn't have anything to do with that girl's death. I should've just kept walking, with all the trouble y'all are causing me."

"I assure you, Mr. Holt, finding a mutilated corpse and not reporting it would not have been in your best interest. But we need to understand how a woman's body ended up this far out, isolated, with nothing around for miles but your cabin."

"I don't know!" he shouted back, his voice tinged with anger and a hint of fear. "If it were me, I'd have buried her or fed her to the hogs. You might think folks like me are just dumb hicks, but even I would've come up with something better than just leaving her out to attract predators."

"There are predators in the area then? What kind?" I asked, seizing the opportunity to gather more information.

"Oh, you name it," he muttered, "Coyotes, bobcats, maybe even a cougar or two. They'd all take a chance on a free meal," he explained.

I pondered his words, "And yet, she was out here for weeks without so much as a nibble from them?"  
Holt paused, "Animals have been steering clear of this spot. Won't come within a hundred yards. They can smell the evil."

"Smell the evil?" I echoed skeptically.

"Yes, the evil," he insisted, his voice dropping to a whisper. "This spot ain't normal no more. There's something dark here, and even the beasts know better than to mess with it. Maybe you could take the hint."

"Well, I appreciate the advice, Mr. Holt, but I have a job to do," I responded with a forced smile, turning to leave. "Enjoy the rest of your evening."

As I rejoined Finn, his expression was pensive, eyes scanning the ground. "Find anything?" I asked.  
He exhaled slowly, frustration evident. "Not much. There's hardly any blood, if any at all. But look at this," he gestured around us, "the foliage here is dying off. It might be from some chemicals she was doused with, or something else affecting the area."

I nodded, following his gaze. The ground underfoot was patchy and discolored for a few yards in any direction.

"She wasn't dragged here, either. The ground's soft from recent rains, but there are no tire marks, no signs of a body being dragged." He paused, then pointed towards a specific spot. "But I did find something interesting over here."

I stepped closer, following his gesture to a set of footprints. Finn crouched down, his finger tracing the outline of the prints. "Look at the gait here," he explained. "Nearly four feet between strides. For a woman her height it should be around two. And look—they seem to be backwards."

The implication of his words slowly dawned on me. "You're saying—"

"Whatever happened, she walked here on her own," he concluded.
