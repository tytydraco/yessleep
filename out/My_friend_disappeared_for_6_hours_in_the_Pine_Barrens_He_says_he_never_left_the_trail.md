We were just hiking.

Not deep. Not off trail. Just a straight shot down Batsto River Road before doubling back at sunset. The Pine Barrens are quiet in that weird, almost oppressive way—like the trees are holding their breath. But it was nothing we hadn’t done before.

Until Jared vanished.

It was only for a second. I looked back and he was gone.

No sound. No struggle. No footprints off the path. Just me standing there, calling his name into the brush.

I searched for two hours.

Then he came back.

He walked out of the woods like nothing had happened. Calm. Pale. Eyes a little too wide.

I ran up, asked him where he went.

He just blinked and said, “What do you mean? You were the one who left.”

That night, I noticed the scratches on his arms. Long ones. Parallel. Like talons. When I asked, he looked confused and said they were already there.

They weren’t.

He’s been different since.

He doesn’t blink as often. His voice sounds like someone else trying to mimic him. He stares out the window for hours.

Last night I caught him whispering something.

Not English.

Something low and broken. Like a recording played backward.

I confronted him.

He smiled—too wide—and said: “He showed me where the sky ends.”

The next morning, Jared was gone again.

No note. No shoes. Just the front door swinging open on its hinges, like he didn’t care about letting something else inside.

I told myself to stay put.

But after an hour of pacing the living room, I couldn’t help it.

I grabbed the recorder we’d used for trail logs, stuffed it in my jacket pocket, and followed the tree line behind the house where his tracks disappeared.

The Barrens are different at night. Even in the daylight, you can tell. The sand feels colder. The trees lean in closer. Like they want to hear you breathing.

I found him about a mile in.

Standing completely still.

Head tilted back, staring at the sky so hard I thought his neck would snap.

He was whispering again. That same garbled language—like broken static, like something trying to crawl into my ears.

I clicked the recorder on.

For a moment, he didn’t move.

Then he spoke in perfect English.

“You’re early,” he said.

Before I could even process that, he turned toward me.

His mouth moved first—lips stretching unnaturally wide, like his skin was too loose. Then the rest of his face caught up.

And when he smiled, I saw it:

The teeth.

Not rows.

Not human.

They were jagged, twisted like snapped branches jammed into gums too soft to hold them.

And his eyes weren’t Jared’s anymore.

They were glassy.

Like an animal that had been left to rot.

I ran.

I didn’t look back. I just sprinted until my legs gave out somewhere near the old firebreak road.

When I finally caught my breath, I pulled out the recorder.

I expected static.

Maybe my own panicked breathing.

But when I hit play—

It wasn’t Jared’s voice at all.

It was something else.

Something deeper.

Slow.

Breathing.

Long, shuddering inhales, followed by wet, shuffling sounds. Something big. Something that wasn’t alone.

And just at the edge of it—

You can hear my name.

Whispered, over and over.

Growing closer.

I’m still listening to it now, sitting in the truck with the doors locked, trying to figure out what to do.

Because just a few minutes ago, I saw Jared again.

He’s standing at the edge of the tree line.

Smiling.

But there’s something wrong with his skin this time.

Like it’s starting to slip.

And something underneath is pushing to get out.

He didn’t sleep that night.

Just sat in the living room, facing the window, whispering in that language again.

I recorded it.

Didn’t plan to—I just opened the voice memo app out of instinct, like part of me knew I shouldn’t be hearing it alone.

When I played it back later, it was silent.

Not low quality. Not muffled.

Just nothing. Like the app refused to acknowledge what I’d captured.

But my phone did something else.

The time on the recording said 6 hours and 13 minutes, even though I only listened for ten seconds.

And in the background—barely visible in the waveform—was something pulsing.

Like a heartbeat.

That’s when I noticed Jared wasn’t in the living room anymore.

The front door was open.

There were hoofprints in the hallway.

I grabbed a flashlight and followed the tracks out into the woods. I didn’t know what else to do. He wasn’t answering his phone, and my gut kept screaming that if I waited, I’d never see him again.

The prints led off the trail.

Deep into the trees.

Farther than we ever hiked.

And the deeper I went, the quieter it got.

No birds.

No wind.

Even my own footsteps stopped making noise after a while. Like the air had gotten too thick to carry sound.

That’s when I found him.

Standing in the middle of a clearing, barefoot, shirtless, eyes rolled back.

The sky above him looked wrong—too low, like it was sagging over the trees. Cloudless. Heavy. Humming.

He was whispering again.

The same language.

But this time… something answered.

Not aloud. Not with words.

But through the dirt.

Through the trees.

Through me.

I felt it crawl up my spine like cold teeth.

Jared turned toward me.

His arms were longer now.

Fingers too.

The skin at his joints looked stretched, thin enough to tear.

And from his back—just beneath the shoulder blades—something twitched.

Trying to push its way through.

He smiled.

Not wide this time.

Just… knowingly.

And said, “He knows your name now.”

He took a step toward me.

Just one.

But the sound that came with it wasn’t right. Not the snap of twigs or the crunch of dirt—just a wet, sinking noise, like something pulling itself free from deep mud.

The air around him shimmered.

Then something else stepped out from behind him.

It was tall. Wrong. Built like it remembered being a man, but had grown in the shape of something else. Its legs bent the wrong way. Its hooves were split and cracked. And its skin was the color of ash soaked in blood, stretched too thin across a skeleton that didn’t match.

It didn’t look at me.

It looked through me.

And in that instant, my knees buckled.

My head felt like it had been filled with static. Not sound—pressure. Like every thought I’d ever had was being pulled up and sifted through by something that didn’t know what memory was, but wanted to wear one.

I think I screamed.

Or maybe I didn’t.

Jared spoke again—his voice all wrong now, like he had too many teeth behind it.

“He’s trying you on,” he said.

The thing stepped forward.

I didn’t move. Couldn’t.

Its fingers—or claws, or branches—brushed my chest.

And that’s when I saw its face.

It didn’t have one.

Not really.

Just folds of skin, like wings that hadn’t opened yet. But beneath them, where a mouth might be, was something moving.

Mimicking.

I watched my own mouth form in its skin.

My jaw.

My nose.

My scream.

And then—suddenly—I was back on the trail.

Alone.

Middle of the day.

No Jared.

No creature.

Just my flashlight in one hand, and my phone in the other.

And a new recording I don’t remember making.

It’s exactly 6 hours and 13 minutes long.

I haven’t listened to it yet.

But I can see the waveform.

There’s a voice in it.

One that sounds like mine.

Only it’s still speaking.

Even when the file is paused.
