 

(Part one will be linked in the comments)Yes I am alive and I am going to update with what is currently going on. In my last post I mentioned that I was last stuck in my bedroom with my “husband” cooking and singing. I planned to escape and go to my work (even though it was my day off) to check for details regarding our new “home”. After I posted my story I sat in bed listening to my “husband” sing a melody that made me even more uneasy. I eventually got up the courage to leave the bed, I put on some clothes trying to be quiet hoping he wouldn't hear me.

“Honey?” he called in a sweet voice, I cursed myself.

“Mhm yes dear?” I slid on some of my old tennis shoes that I happened to luckily still be packed in a box.

“You should sleep in a bit more! I think some extra sleep will help clear your head.” He hummed, “I just want what is best for you.”

I hated this, I felt so defenseless, a part of me wants to believe that Larry is still Larry and I'm just making this up. But I'm not and that message I wrote to myself proves it. That thing continued to hum.

“I..I think some fresh air would help me.” I said my voice squeaking. 

The humming stopped, and a long silence filled the air. I felt my heart pounding as I slowly made my way out of our room. The house creaked and I felt as if something was watching me while I slowly made my way to the entryway. I had to pass by the kitchen in order to get to the entry and I held my breath as I made it closer and closer. The silence was still there and all I could hear was my heart which felt as if it was about to explode. As I passed the kitchen I realized it was empty. So where was he..it? I turned and found Larry standing by our shoe rack in the entryway.

“Honey? What are you?” I mumbled glancing at his hands which were still covered with gloves.

“You are right, fresh air does sound nice.” He smiled a smile I now hated, “But I don’t want to leave you alone, what if you pass out again, so I thought I'd join you!”

My stomach was churning and I thought I was going to be sick. I did not want to take a walk with this thing.

“I would actually..um” I was stuttering and the air seemed to chill. “ I was thinking of going alone, you know, to clear my head. You see I've been um having ....” I was rambling again.

Larry took a step closer to me and put his hand on my shoulder. It was ice cold, which was terrifying that I could feel it through the gloves. I felt goosebumps all over my body.

“Honey, I really” his hand gripped my shoulder harder “don't think that's a good idea.”

I was just standing there like a mouse stuck in a trap, but really what could I do? 

“O..okay..” I tried to plaster a smile, “Let me get my sweater and you can clean up whatever you were cooking earlier. We can eat it when we get back.”

The thing paused, looking me up and down, I felt like he was seeing right through me.

Then he grinned as big toothy smile, “Alright, why don’t you get my coat too.”

“A..alright.” I turned around and began walking back towards our bedroom.

It was hard to not run, I wanted to leave as soon as possible, but I was patient and walked. I still felt as if something was watching me, observing my every move. Well eventually I made it to our bedroom, and I grabbed my coat, wallet and car keys. Then I went to our bedroom window, opened it as quietly as I could, and climbed out. I ran as fast as I could towards my car. I didn’t know where he was in my house and if he was still by the entryway, so my only hope was that he actually went back to the kitchen. I made it to my car, and that thing was nowhere near my car.

I started it up and backed out of the driveway, that's when I saw him staring out of a window directly at me. If that wasn’t unnerving enough he was grinning ear from ear, a big toothy smile I hated. Why? Why was he smiling? He must've known that I didn’t plan to come back. So why did he look like that? I drove out of the neighborhood and I heard a ding on my phone. My heart was pounding again, the message must be from him. I didn’t want to view it, I was terrified of what it might say. I drove to a gas station near my work so I could look at my phone. I was right, it was a text from that thing, my “husband” “Drive safe see you soon.” I feel as if I am going to puke, what does he mean see you soon?

I have so many questions, what is it planning? I decided to go to a hotel instead of straight to work, so I could clear my head. So I drove, checked into a room and took the rest of that day to think about what I'd do next. I am typing this in a hotel room, I plan to go to work today and view some old newspapers. Hopefully I'll find some of my creepy house and it's past residents. I also want to thank the person who commented. Although I don’t plan to burn my house down I will not be returning alone. I don’t really have a plan on what to do after going to work. I might go see my parents, but then again they have no reason to believe me. I’m also looking into priests and exorcisms. I'll update again soon, again any advice is welcomed.
