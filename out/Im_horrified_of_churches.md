For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a strange relationship with houses of worship. 
Most people’s senses are overcome with melancholy when they step through those doors. The rows of wooden pews carrying souls from all walks of life to one destination. A transparent Jesus Christ painted on the windows above them, acting as their compass. The moment you step into that altar, you're laying yourself completely naked in front of an ancient deity that you can’t even begin to understand. A church is an unexplainable phenomenon.

Maybe that explains why I’m so terrified of them. 

I don’t know why I hold such a strong fear for something that’s supposed to be so good. So revered, so important to so many people.
What am I supposed to say to my friends who invite me to their weekly Sunday services? 
I know I sound crazy.
I know it’s not normal to physically recoil every time you drive by a sign that reads “Join Us For Communion.” I know that.
It’s irrational, but there’s a feeling in the pit of my soul that tells me I’m right. That a church is not a safe space for me.

I was adopted when I was eight, ever since then I grew up in the Georgia countryside, which at least in my experience was painfully rural, had amazing food (seriously. The peaches.) and just about the most religious community you could think of, which meant me going to church was inevitable. 
Even at that young age, I was seriously put off by the whole ordeal.

I vividly remember sitting next to my parents during service, asking if I could go to the bathroom, walking out of the common area making sure to check if the lobby was empty, then sprinting out of the building before anybody could catch me.

My therapist thinks I have some sort of religious trauma, that something unspeakable happened to me in a church and that’s why I’m so scared of them. I wish I could tell her that she’s right, unfortunately I don’t remember much from my early childhood.
I heard the human brain starts developing memories at the age of four, in my case I started remembering things clearly when I turned  eight (around the time I was adopted).  Everything before that is a total blur.

That's why I’m writing this, actually. My therapist thinks if I document everything I remember from my fragmented childhood, I might be able to piece together why I turned out the way I did.
I guess this is a good time to introduce myself. My name is Judith, I turned 23 a couple days ago and this is my therapist assigned writing project. I’d like to apologize now for the clunky writing. I'm not much of a writer.

How I remember my adolescence is indistinguishable from how you’d remember a dream. Faces blur together. Things seem so familiar, so cold, so abstract… yet you know you’ve been there before. As time passes, that memory fades. You can try your best to grasp the feeling while you hold it in your hands but eventually it will slip away, like most of my past already has. It’s a dilemma that’ll probably haunt me for as long as I breathe. Despite that, there are some things from my formative years that I’ll never forget.

“I wanna see the wall.” Eve grinned, barely able to hold in her nervous laughter. 
Eve was the kind of friend that could make anything seem funny, no matter how dangerous it was. I didn’t respond, we were both probably delirious at that point in the day anyway. We had been crushing grapes under our feet for hours, with no shade, in an open field. Me and Eves stomping became almost rhythmic after a while.  Eve said we sounded like soldiers, marching to battle. “I know you want to see it too. If we go now, nobody will see us.” Eve was still now. She had stopped crushing grapes, She was just staring at me. “I.. I don’t know. I don’t think it’s allowe-“ Before I could finish, Eve grabbed my hands, interrupting my train of thought. “Please, Judith.” I looked at the thick line of trees in the distance, then back at Eve. 

Sharp blades of grass cut across my l legs as I tried keeping up with Eve. When me and her were racing, she always won, but not this time. The sun had already begun setting when we started running. The bright orange hues of the sunset lit up the field, but it was quickly fading. We weren’t allowed to be out after sunset, I prayed we’d be back to our post in time. Before I knew it, Eve’s messy blonde hair started to disappear through the tall thick grass. I tried keeping pace with Eve but she was gone. Worse, without her leading the way, I was lost. “Eve? Eve! Wait up!” I frantically turned around, looking for Eve in every direction. The sound of strong winds traveling through the grass drowned out my cries for help. My only choice was to run, so I ran. I ran so fast in fact, I burst out of the tall grass falling on my face.

 Eve was waiting for me, she found it hilarious. I looked up to see her chuckling. “I win,” she declared proudly. “Maybe this time.. first to the wall wins!” I scrambled to my feet and ran into the treeline, chasing after my opponent. Night had fallen by this point, but I didn’t feel so scared when Eve was with me.

After a good ten minutes of trekking through the forest, we made it. We stood in front of a large stone wall, stretching across the woods, farther than the eye could see.
The wall itself wasn’t too impressive in height, even me (seven at the time) could easily climb over it. I stared at the wall in awe for a few moments, I wondered what its purpose was. There was a reason why I wasn’t allowed to approach the wall, I just can’t remember it for the life of me. I heard Eve calling me over, she said there were loose stones in the wall. “Wow. This thing is falling apart!” Eve laughed. “Yeah. We should rebuild it,” I responded jokingly. We were laughing, we were happy. I don’t remember what happened next. I mean, I do, but nothing I could put into words. 

Now I’m sure you have questions, trust me I do too.
Like, “why were you smashing grapes in a field?” “Where were your parents?” “What did that wall in the middle of the woods mean?”  “Why were you praying? Isn’t that something you don’t do?” Well yeah. The strange thing is, before I got adopted I think I prayed frequently. Whatever weird commune I grew up in, was very religious. Not like “we go to church on Sunday’s” type religious. It was different. 

I know this isn’t normal.

Anyway, setting aside the weird stuff, this was oddly therapeutic for me. I don’t open up about my feelings a lot, especially regarding my past. It’s strange, the more I write, the more I seem to remember. I guess this means my therapist was right, which means this will probably be the first of many posts. If anybody has had a similar experience to me, I’d love to hear it.
