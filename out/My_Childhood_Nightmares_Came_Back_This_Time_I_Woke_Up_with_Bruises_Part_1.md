A few nights ago something started to bother me. It began as a nameless anxiety while I brushed my teeth. The feeling escalated as I stared at my trembling hands. I lost control of my breathing, and when I looked into the mirror I saw another’s face staring back in place of my own–my father’s. Foreign words ran through my mind in the shape of unintelligible mutterings as I traced my shaky fingers across the features that I hadn’t seen in years.

Above my shoulder I saw the shower curtain crumple violently, and the words in my head were drowned out by violent laughter. The next moment, I collapsed.

When I regained consciousness, I found the bathroom in ruins–words were choppily etched all over the walls as if the paint were torn by fingernails;

“STATIC. LIGHT. MOVIE. BURIED IN YOUR BODY. WARM. COLD. FLIES. VOMIT. COME BACK. YOU FOLLOW. HANDS. THROAT. ALONE SUDDENLY ALONE SUDDENLY ALONE. FLIES. BREATH IN. FLIES. DON’T LEAVE. COME BACK.”

When I was ten and a half, my father died. His gravestone read:



*In loving memory of Joseph Michael Calhoun*

*Dedicated Son, Brother, Father, and Husband.*

*‘In our youth, we fly…*

*I have come to much prefer the nest.’*

*1965-2007*



The quote came from a poem he wrote just before my sister’s birth titled, “Into the Rising Sun.” 

He wrote a lot–poetry, short stories, love letters–really I think he just liked to read his own words, we all did. If he had his way the gravestone may have been able to fit a few chapters on it, but his death was sudden, and his mind was the first part of him to go. 

Many nights my mother would sleep downstairs; I was always so certain it was because he was tucked in that dark room to work on a story for me, with one gentle, flickering light to guide him. Often, if this seemed to be the case, I would try and peek in to see what he was writing; I could never hear the keyboard though, it was always drowned out by some humming white noise. I only remember seeing the light lunge across the room, my one sign that my father was there.

\---

  
At only ten and a half years old, I lost far more than just a father. In his passing, he took with him my idol, my caretaker, and, possibly his most selfish choice, he took away my chance to hear all he had to say.

Every weekend we would stay up as late as we could watching his favorite old tv shows, or reading his favorite books–we did just about anything we could together. I couldn’t part from his side, and he never left mine. It’s a difficult relationship to relay, I’ve spent most of my life without him but even now I see him in every little thing. I can hear the way he would describe the most mundane things with such magic. I fell in love with his world and felt so lucky that he invited me into it. Just as fully as I feel his presence, I continue to feel his loss. The pain remains the sharpest of my whole life, yet I wouldn’t trade a thing in the world for our memories together.

I ran home from his funeral; I couldn’t stand to see him sealed away in front of my eyes–forever unreachable. In search of a single thing that could draw me closer to him, I tore apart the boxes of his belongings that my mother just recently moved to the attic.

While my family said goodbye to him I desperately clung on. I fought through a storm of tears, until finally something turned up; a letter for my sister, inscribed:



*I love you, my Angeline. In this letter I give you a piece of myself, in case I one day leave you.*



I couldn’t justify taking the letter away from Angie, despite my every selfish urge to destroy it. I put it back where I found it, but only after I transcribed it–if only just to make sure I never lost his words. This was a false promise to myself, as days later I tore my copy apart in one of my many fits of rage–my mourning was not gentle. One piece remained intact, though, the beginning of the poem;



**Into the Rising Sun**

*Dedicated to my Angel*



*Many years ago, the Moon was formed, a piece of the Earth.*

*Many years ago, the Moon found its footing, creating the tides.*

*The Sun sat patiently, bearing witness to beauty beyond comparison.*



*So it began, an endless waltz between these three celestial bodies*

*The Sun brought warmth, despite being forever separated from the other two*

*The Moon brought balance, despite being fated to remain incomplete, only a drifting piece of the Earth*

*The Earth, paying back its companions, brought life-*

  


Only a few weeks ago I found the scrap buried in an old writing notebook from high school. I thought back to a lesson during my astronomy elective in college; the Moon was created when an asteroid struck the Earth, breaking off tremendous debris. This debris, all magma and rock, slowly fell into itself, forming into a giant chunk of the Earth, now bound to orbit its life giver perfectly, forever separate. I’m certain it longs to return, to become part of the Earth again; what suffering it must experience in its incompleteness.

It took a long time for my mother to find Angie’s letter; she refused to look through Dad’s stuff until I was stable enough to help. Having hidden it so long ago, it took me a few minutes to realize that it had been missing from where I left it, then I noticed the corner of an envelope sticking from her sweatshirt pocket. She saw the recognition in my face and asked what was wrong, but I just told her,

“Give her that letter, Mom.” I was furious–I couldn’t believe that she was trying to hide it, but more than anything, I couldn’t believe that I was arguing to give it to Angie. My baby sister was too young to understand, but I had left it in the attic for a reason.

Shortly after, I began to read constantly; first I poured through every piece of paper left in my father’s wake, reading many of them over and over until the paper began to stain and crease. Once it became a concern that I would damage or devalue these prized possessions, I moved on to other forms of literature, exploring some of the many influences my father made reference to. As my knowledge of the literary world grew, so did my prowess as a writer. I especially enjoyed writing prose, and at many points, free-form poetry–I learned my style from my father’s. Despite this, I felt my work was entirely inadequate in the shadow of his legacy.

At night, even now, I ask myself if my life has amounted to anything other than chasing a ghost. Muddy, distant memories of our relationship before his death are all that remain, some of which are, to put it pleasantly, unfortunate. In his best times, he was a life raft upon which the whole world could float. It would be impossible to truly claim that this was the majority of the time, but I remember the good far more than I do the bad. On occasion, however, I can see the image of his face, sunken, pale against the unlit void of my parents room. More memorable is the stench from the room in times when he would refuse to leave the bed for days.

\---



Two weeks after the funeral, my mother took my sister and I to visit the grave. I felt ready. My mother held my hand in her left, hoisting a sweet, chubby-armed Angie up with her right arm. I can still see her wandering, wide-eyed expression on our walk through the aging plots. In my memories her shallow breaths, giggles, babblings, and whispers are an overture played over grainy B-roll footage. This film plays through my head often, always in the same order; 



*I see countless monuments to the dead, their lettering cruelly washed away by time, leaving stones that do little more than remind me that my dad’s words will go away one day too; Angie being set down to crawl; my mother attempting to stifle an expression that took me many years to understand. Directly after seeing her steely, confusingly furious gaze, I see the coastal sky hanging over the tips of impossibly tall white pines. I hear my sister giggling.* 

*Averting my eyes from the gloomy sky, I take in an unfortunate sight–the most vivid piece of this memory: my mother’s expression has collapsed. Her quivering lip and her tear-battered cheeks stand in stark contrast to the stillness of her body, as if all of her humanity existed only in those cascading tears and the lip that fought valiantly to hold back the screams of a fresh widow. She was left behind, a mother of two, a grieving wife, and, more than anything else, a person forced to mourn her best friend. Angie’s babbling words echo in my ears.* 

*Then, I look to see what may have caused this overwhelming shift in Mom’s demeanor, and see nothing but the stone that has my father’s words engraved into it. Angie coos, seeking attention.*

*Unable to understand what had upset Mom so suddenly, I thought I may cheer her up by doing an impression of my father–I had become a real talent at replicating his voice in the many hours I spent clinging to him. Maybe I was learning about sentence structures at the time, or simply liked the way it looked, whatever it was that lead me to read his words doesn’t matter.* 

*In our youth, we fly…*

*I have come to much prefer the nest.*



*I see my mother turn her face to me, her features obscured and unrecognizable. I have never been able to recall that expression.*

Most often, I lose track of the memory here, with my father’s words, *my words*, echoing in my mind for days afterwards. Oddly, I do not hear it as a boy’s imitation, but instead, my father’s actual voice, somehow weathered and extremely comforting.

\--



For some time after our visit to Dad’s grave the memory appeared only as a dream, but it deviated from the actual morning significantly. Of the many fabrications that a dream is bound to incorporate, I only remember the following changes with any clarity.



*I stand with my family, but only I notice the foul odor of death riding along the wind–the smell of damp, rotting flesh. Instead of staring into the gloomy sky, I stare deeply into the woods, unable to break eye contact with something hidden within them.*



This portion of the dream often seemed to last for hours. I would never wake up without completing the dream, leaving me stuck.



*I can’t move, feeling as though some invisible hand is latched around my wrist. It tugs against my arm, trying to pull me into the gaps between the pines.*

*In these gaps, a sort of shifting is occurring.*



In my best description, given to a therapist years ago, the empty space sat in complete darkness, like a curtain that was perfectly fitted between each tree, leading all the way to their peaks.



*On the other side of this perfect veil, millions of small, unidentifiable, buzzing creatures attempt to escape. With endless force they work to drive themselves through the curtains, but they fail each night, no matter how long they try. Each one moves independently, trying different angles and squeezing against each other. As the curtain swells, I see the shape of a human face pressing against it, nearly ten feet up.*



I was unable to even speak about this dream at the time. I would wake up still able to smell the stench of the bodies. My wrist was constantly sore during the period that I suffered these nightmares. At the time a doctor examined me, whispering to my mother that the sensitivity I felt indicated some trauma, but it was dismissed as a boyish injury. It took me years to rationalize that the lingering effects of my dream were psychosomatic–the brain’s influence on the body is far stronger than we realize.



Despite being aware of the nightmare’s insignificance, a therapist I attended in my teens urged me to explain the feelings in the best wording I could. We worked together to journal my explanation, which was as follows;



*Imagine; you are paralyzed, stuck with a cold, concrete floor against your back.  Above your head hangs a thin sheet, strung up at its corners by rusty hooks. Pounds of chubby, writhing larvae begin raining down onto the sheet, pressing weightily into the fabric. More, and more, and more. Slowly, the corners of the sheet begin to tear, the fabric no longer able to bear the increasing mass of fleshy, wriggling grubs.*

*By now, you’re unsure if you would even survive the massive weight if it were to collapse. Meanwhile, you remain entirely incapable of moving, or defending yourself, or even closing your eyes. The sheet does not collapse, though; it stretches impossibly, yields endlessly to the weight without buckling under it.*

*This process goes on for hours, you are now certain it would kill you, but not by crushing you–now you believe that you’ll be suffocated underneath a mountain of these festering things.*

*It will not be quick; you come to the conclusion that a pile of larvae would definitely be porous enough to allow for pockets of air. Instead of simply suffocating you by denying you access to the air, the maggots would provide a much harsher fate.*

*Looking to escape the mountainous pressure from the pile above them, the maggots would crawl into your nose, preventing you from breathing comfortably and you would begin to panic. Your desperate struggle for air would cause you to reflexively open your mouth, even if just the tiniest bit. Immediately, you would feel a few of the writhing grubs fall through your lips as you struggle for air–their bitter, mucus drenched skin worsening your reaction. As your mouth continues to fill, you would choke, sucking them into your throat. Still choking, but now on their fleshy bodies, you begin hacking up larvae. No matter how many you expel, they climb back down, deeper, deeper, deeper.*



*Of course, the sheet still hasn’t actually broken.*



After enough time, however, the torture of waiting becomes tantamount to the suffocation itself. If, per say, I slept for 9 hours, I would estimate that I dreamt for almost the whole time, and almost all of that time was spent waiting, terrified that the curtain would fall. That I would suffocate, choke to death upon whatever was hiding in the dark.

\--



Most nights I would wet the bed; I struggled with my appetite, I became hostile, lashing out at anyone around me. I would love to say that it was just my grief, but I was consumed by fear of that monster in the dark.

I stopped going to school in this period, my mother felt that I wouldn’t handle peer interactions well and thought it best to allow me to process in the comfort of my home. In some ways, she must have done it just as much for herself as she did it for me; although it was certainly bittersweet, my resemblance to my father and my incessant imitation of his every characteristic was of still a piece of comfort in a house that felt so empty in his absence. His vacancy weighed on us as though we had only ever been aware of his company–my own mother felt alien to me. Angie was blissfully unaware of our troubles but she must have felt the palpable emptiness, even if she couldn’t have recognized it.

My night terrors only lasted for a few weeks but I would say that these were, markedly, the worst weeks of my life.  
\--



The other night, after I collapsed in the bathroom, I fell asleep only to “awaken” in the cemetery. Years after I escaped it, the hand found me again, ready to call me back into the woods. 

*In my dream I walk down the path, once again a child, experiencing the same procession that I did on that fateful day. This time, though, I can hear the buzzing from behind the curtains well before reaching the plot. My wrist begins to ache in anticipation of the hand’s steel grip. I try so desperately to avert my gaze from the gaps in the pines, but my effort is fruitless.*

*Beneath me, my feet begin to tread towards the woods, as the trees grow taller and taller. The sky slowly disappears, shrouded behind the canopy. I shout at my legs to stop, yet they continue. After an eternity I arrive at the edge of the woods, the swelling curtains reaching out, inches from my face. Well above me, the face–outlined by the curtains–looks stoically forward.*

*I stand in anticipation, my hearing beginning to dull from the cacophony of bestial noises born mere inches in front of me. The stench fills my nose as my eyes peer up–the canopy seems to still grow, and only a tiny bit of the sky remains.*

*The hand finally joins me, brushing gently against my cheek. Slowly, I feel the fingers wrap around my throat. My pulse throbs, veins stifled by the meaty fingers. The grip brings an unbearable pressure–bit by bit my windpipe collapses. Like sucking all of the air out of a plastic water bottle; the plastic crumples until, ultimately, it becomes a shriveled, twisted mess–a completely alien form. Equally alien to its original shape, my windpipe is distorted and crumpled, the little air passing through my throat catching against the sharp angles of my trachea.*

*I struggle to hold my head up as my seizing neck muscles give into the pressure and lose all strength. With a snap, I fall limp and my vision turns sideways. My head is held on by nothing more than my tattered throat, a bungee cord on which my skull bobbles back and forth. The hand, trembling with some concealed fury, worsens this effect. I feel my inhuman neck elongate and contract in reaction to the angered shaking of my lifeless body.* 

*My vision–hazy from experiencing a level of pain entirely new to me–bounces in tandem with my head’s movement. My eyes largely point to the ground, but occasionally I get a look in a random direction. I look to the grey, far off shimmer of sky; it fights to reach me through the sprawling canopy. After a few excruciating moments, my vision then crosses the face above me, still stoic against the curtain. Then, just as I begin to realize that I may never escape the hand’s grasp, my eyes land upon my father’s grave.*

*Suddenly I regain control of my body–my arms reflexively pry at the massive fingers to no effect. Weakly, I reach toward the curtain, hoping to make any attempt for my life. Before I can tear it open the hand throws me down. My head slams violently against a root.* 

*I look up to see the shape of the face, high above me, look down as it begins to smile. On the verge of death, the sound of my own sobbing fails to reach my ears, impossibly quiet in comparison to the hum of the millions of unseen things behind the curtain. I feel a warm liquid pool in my crotch.*

*The curtain now stretches to accommodate a human figure, seemingly attached to the face far above me. Its proportions are inconceivable; it is not simply “too tall” to be real, each part of it seems to be a poorly done rendition of the human figure. It’s more similar to crayon drawings–misshapen and far from anatomical–than it is to any natural being. As it pushes itself closer to me I hear the curtain tear, my eyes quickly shut to avoid whatever was coming. I feel a warm hand against my cheek–reflexively my eyes open. Only inches in front of my face is another. In a flash, I see a set of kind, watering eyes. I refuse to look below them; although hazy in my periphery, I know that if I do, my gaze will meet with a set of snarling teeth hanging loosely from an unhinged jaw. So instead, I stare deeply into the eyes, coming to recognize them–they were his.*



I woke up. Tearing my way out of bed, I found the bathroom and flipped on the lights. I struggled to recognize my reflection–my face was covered in a mix of blood and salty tears, and beneath, my throat was host to extensive bruising, the marks all at least eight or nine inches long, making up the loose shape of fingers. Grime and dried blood piled under my broken fingernails, pushing them up off of my nail beds and threatening to tear them away entirely; or perhaps their displacement was a result of whatever led them to get chipped, torn, and bloodied in the first place. 



I spent the day locked in my bathroom in a fetal position. The stench of my piss-drenched pajama pants filled the air as I begged for help, uncertain who would ever be able to hear me. A cough lingered from being strangled. Every gurgling choke brought with it blood and a frothy white substance, almost like a baby’s spit up. I gently cleaned my scruffy five-o-clock shadow as memories of my father’s scratchy facial hair flow through my mind. 

Each time I coughed I worried that my head may fall to the side, my neck suddenly giving in to the pressure of that beckoning figure from beyond the woods.

I laid on the cold tile floor until night returned. In a brief moment of lucidity I decided to gather myself to take a shower. If I was going to sleep again, at the very least I could fall asleep clean, if only to feel slightly more grounded. By then the bruising on my neck had purpled, sensitive to the touch. Before getting in I washed my hands, staring intently down at my fingernails as I cleaned the grime from underneath. I pulled apart the chipped remains with clippers, wincing as I ripped off more than just nail.



My task now completed, I looked in the mirror–behind me the shower curtain began to swell forward, emanating the familiar stench, paired with the pestering sound of what I could only imagine were countless insects. 

I refused to turn around and face this monster. I would go to bed dirty. More than anything, I needed to keep moving rather than accept that my reality was shattering–the monster found its way out of my dream. As I exited the bathroom I chose to ignore the set of eyes I saw in the mirror, peeking curiously from the shower, nestled in the dark. I also chose to ignore the familiar, timid laughter it emitted.

I couldn’t trust that I was really seeing anything at all. My delirium was notably worse than in my childhood, but not totally new to me; I know my mind is capable of tricking me into whatever it wants. Besides, I was already confident in what I had to do to fix this.

\--

  
Then, I had the dream for the second time.

And last night, a third. I’ve woken up bruised and bloodied, unable to recuperate.

I caught a last minute flight from JFK to Boston thinking that whatever was going on could only be settled at my family home. I can’t quite explain the feeling; perhaps I simply acted on instinct, unsure whether my hallucinations were becoming increasingly powerful or if some unseen force had actually been bringing this misery upon me, but nonetheless confident that the solution was there at home, waiting.



My sister is in her first semester at a local community college–her life path has been entirely opposite my own. Having never truly known my father, she was left to struggle with his absence, but not the loss of him as a person. If anything, she spent her life just as jealous that I had known him as I was for the fact that he wrote her a letter. 

She was successful throughout school, had friends, and generally lived a fulfilling youth. She made the plan to stay at home for her first two years of college out of a sense of responsibility to my mother, who faced a rapid decline in her mental health almost immediately when my sister and I were both old enough to take decent care of ourselves.

I felt little responsibility for that. It was simply not an option to live in the overwhelming absence of my father. 



At the airport I called my sister–no answer–and then my mother, who picked up after a single ring. I asked if anyone was home; after assuring her that everything was alright and that I just needed to look through some of my old possessions, she told me that she and my sister were there and excited to see me.

I packed my duffle into the passenger seat of my rental. For two hours I navigated the Maine coast, reminiscing on many drives from my youth. I pulled up to the house, it was exactly the same as I left it. By now it was nearly eleven at night, but I could make out every detail of the house under the illumination of the streetlight–a subject of earlier childhood nightmares, the oddly tall streetlight would spend each night staring through the cracks in my curtains as I slept. If I was struggling to sleep, I would ask my father to sleep with me–the nightmares always went away. My troubled sleeping habits aside, I found the streetlight comforting after all of this time. In a strange way, the return of the dream made me sentimental, and the sight of the house ushered back memories, good and bad, but all worth having.

Inside I was met with a look of shock on my sister’s face rather than her usual reaction–unmasked resentment. “You look like shit, did you crash on your way here?”



“Do you have the letter Dad left you?”



A familiar look came across her face–simultaneously readying her defense of her letter and openly pitying my lack of one.



“Is *that* why you came here?”



“Angie, why do you care? Did Mom ever tell you about my dreams? I know you were young, but she must have mentioned them.” My frantic questioning visibly unnerved her.



“Listen–you need to grow up. Mom brings you up all the time. She already lost Dad, why are you leaving her? And *yes*, JJ” she said dismissively,  “she mentioned them. She’s always been worried about you, and if she knew you were talking about Dad’s letters again? How would she feel? She already told you, there isn’t anything for you in them.”



“Them?” I asked.



“I mean… in the letters we got–Mom and I. JJ, I’m sorry that he didn’t write you one or whatever but you should be happy, why do you need to hold onto an imaginary letter from a man who couldn’t be bothered to see you grow up? Just drop it, okay?” With this final point, she let out a frustrated grunt and then looked away, immediately regretting what she said.



“Please, Angie. I promise I won’t let Mom know that this is why I came back, just let me see the letter, I’m begging you.”



Sighing, the same deep, frustrated sigh she always did when I’d complain about the letters, she said, “Fine–but you have to make sure she thinks you just wanted to come home to see us and grab some stuff, and please hide those bruises–there’s makeup in my room.”



Waiting until I was alone, I read over it again hoping to quell the resurgence of the dream.

\--



Thus far, I have failed to explain two things: the full contents of the letter, and the nature of my first time reading it. In a moment I will transcribe it, but first I would like to explain my urgency in retrieving it, and what really happened upon my first read-through.



In the attic, rummaging through boxes of Dad’s stuff that were tucked away only a week prior, I found the envelope. I instantly ripped it open, tearing away a seal that was not mine to break. The words left for my sister were clearly not meant for me, though no amount of shame could have stopped me from reading them. My anxious scanning was pointless, the words left for Angie meant nothing to me. As a result there was no revelation to stop my dreams; quite the opposite in fact, it became an entirely new hurt to see his deep love for Angie instead of me. I hid the letter back where I found it, unsure why I felt the need to.

That night, I fell asleep feeling far worse than I had any night in the past month. To my surprise, I experienced a night without bad dreams, or any dreams at all. From that point on I slept at night–every night–without a single dream, this relief lasted until the nightmares returned. It only felt natural, then, that reading the letter *should* help me move forward again.

Tears began to well as I, years later, reread words; “I love you, my Angeline. In this letter I give you a piece of myself, in the case of my passing.” The envelope had wilted slightly over its lifetime, splotches of discoloration were left behind from the tears I shed over it as a child.

So here it is, written just before my sister’s birth, over eighteen years ago;

  
**Into the Rising Sun**

*Dedicated to my Angel*



*Many years ago, the Moon was formed, a piece of the Earth.*

*Many years ago, the Moon found its footing, creating the tides.*

*The Sun sat patiently, bearing witness to the formation of the Earth and the Moon.*



*So it began, an endless waltz between these three celestial bodies*

*The Sun brought warmth, despite being forever separated from the other two*

*The Moon brought balance, despite being fated to remain incomplete, only a drifting piece of the Earth*

*The Earth, paying back its companions, brought life, if only to allow them to witness its beauty*

*Inseparable, now, these three companions have continued their dance for eternity.*



*Many, many years later, I saw the sky.*

*In my first life, I was a bird, soaring above endless expanses of land.*

*For many years I refused to look down,*

*I exhausted my wings, flying upward*

*Into the Rising Sun*



*My wings burned, my feet ached for land, and so*

*I descended from the heavens*

*And found another bird, one so beautiful that I forgot the sky entirely*

*And she said to me,*



*“In our youth, we fly…*

*But should we continue?”*



*Without a second thought, I answered*

*“No, these wings have brought me here,*

*I think they should rest.”*



*And so, I stopped chasing those tragic stars.*

*It was a quiet life, but I took pride in that.*

*Not once did I miss the Sun or the Moon.*



*I realized something, though*

*Retiring from flight had broken me down,*

*Made my body weaken.*

*Going against my nature had come at the cost of my life,*

*I felt it slipping away as my body grew cold.*



*As I sat, for many hours pondering how to confront my fate,* 

*I felt the warmth of the sun, and it was the next step towards* ***our*** *life.*

*Before departing, I simply told my companion*



*“In our youth, we fly…*

*I have come to much prefer the nest.”*

  


In an attached letter, he wrote:



*My dear Angeline,*



*I look forward to meeting you,* *more than anything**. In my heart exists a space that has, for my entire life, been empty. Upon the arrival of your brother my heart began to fill, and now it is your task to complete me. Thank you, for everything you are and everything you will become. As I write this I am next to my beloved Catherine, “Mom” to you…*

*Consider yourself lucky, you will grow up with the most compassionate, talented, brilliant, and beautiful woman as your mother. At her side, old “Pa” will be patting himself on the back for helping to make such a beautiful family. So while you feel lucky to have your Mom, just remember that I am the luckiest man in the whole world.*

*In the last few months your brother has begun asking all sorts of questions about you; “Who will she be? What does she like? Can I be her best friend?” He smiles endlessly, although I have been doing just the same. In fact, the whole world has begun to brighten, anticipating your arrival.*

*For the first time in my life, I feel as though I am at a loss for words. By the time you read this you’ll probably find the idea of my wordlessness to be pretty amusing; I cannot wait to prattle on to you about just about anything.*

*I suppose I should recognize the unfortunate truth of this letter. I will leave you one day, and although that may feel a tremendous loss to you, it will be far worse for me. My life will only start when I hold you, when my heart is filled. Yours will go on, long past mine. Some days will be unbelievable, and those days will become cherished memories (of which I hope to be in a few); others will be far from perfect, but I promise you, with all of my strength, that I will be your support, your rock, and anything else you ever need. Someday, when I depart, you will no longer need me. On that day, you will realize that I was nothing more than a port, and now your ship is prepared to sail. At your side will be your brother.*



*Please protect him.*



*By the time you read this, I hope you’ll understand why I ask that of you.*

*So here they are, my first words to you, and my last.*



*Thank you, my joy and pride, my cherished daughter, my Angeline. Thank you for joining us, we are truly lucky to have you. The sun has never shone this brightly, nor has the wind ever smelled so sweet. The world is ready, I hope that you are as well. I love you for eternity.*



*With love,*

*Dad.*



And then, he left. He left me, my mom, and my sister–he said goodbye to them. I never did read what he left my mother, she didn’t keep it for very long.

\--



I poured over the words left for Angie in my head. I thought about the Moon. What a fate; forever unable to do anything but sit in awe of its creator. 

As my mind wandered aimlessly, a timid knock at the bedroom door jolted me into reality. It slowly opened with the aged hands of my mother wrapping around its edges.



“What’s up, Mom?”



“Hi, Honey–” She quickly interrupted herself, and instead chose to walk toward the bed, gently setting herself down at the foot.



I loosened the blankets, sitting up to meet her wavering eyes. “Is everything alright? You don’t look like yourself, why are you even up?”



“He was a really great man, really great. You know he loved you, right?”



Stunned, I shifted further up the bed, stiffening my back against the wall. As I did so, I saw a sudden turn in her expression, now surprised.



“JJ, you look so much like him–”



Fully aware of her meaning and concerned she knows exactly why I came back, I sheepishly asked, “Mom, what’s going on with you? Are you talking about Dad? I don’t really look like him, and I’m honestly not sure why you’re suddenly looking to talk about him.” 



My tone, doctored to appear innocent and unaware, came out less coy than I had intended; again, her face was contorted, now some vague feeling beyond surprise was aimed at me.



“Please, you know why I’m thinking about him. I can tell the dreams are back, have you looked in a mirror? Honey, you know what the doctors said, it's not real.”



“Mom–” before I could say anything more, she spoke over me.



“You really have grown up. It’s okay to talk about him, I promise. I don’t mind that you miss him, you’d be silly not to.”



“Do–do you?” I had given up on hiding it, she knew, and soon my sister would be aware that I violated our promise. Not that it was particularly important, though, I had already gotten what I wanted.



“Honey, he died a long ti–”



“Mom, he wrote me a letter, right? He had to have left me something, right?”



As a child I made a habit of abruptly springing into this line of questioning nearly every day, she would always reply in the same calm tone, “I’ve told you a billion times, there was no letter.” 

The first time I ever asked, though, she told me something else; “I’m sorry my love, but I’m sure he knew that you’d be alright without him. Look at you, what could he tell you with words that you don’t already know? Honey, you’re just like–well, you’re so.. *similar*. You’ve been by his side since birth, he chose to trust that you would find what you needed in your memories, rather than simple words…” I was particularly frustrated by this–if we were so close, wouldn’t I deserve a letter more than anyone?

For longer than seemed possible, we sat in the silent presence of one another, remembering the years of hardship brought to mind by this familiar conversation. 

She adjusted on the bed, now looking directly at me for the first time. In the quiet of my childhood bedroom, under the watchful gaze of the streetlight, she found a new response. With an excruciatingly cold tone, as if reciting a script, she told me; 



“He loved you, more than he did me or your sister, more than he *could have* loved us. If you don’t realize that, you really have no idea how much you meant to him. But you should know that it was hard for him, I guess, to see so much of himself in you. I never really understood why, but it hurt him–over time it began to make more sense to me than I would like to admit. Can’t you just be happy knowing that even his wife was jealous of how much he loved you? What would a letter do for you, you had him all to yourself when he was alive.”



With that, she got up and left. As she walked out I couldn’t help but think how much more present she was; it was as if her aging was reversed, just for a moment. Maybe I’ve taken too long to say this, but yes, I did know my father loved me. It was never really a concern to me, honestly. More than anything, I couldn’t believe that I would spend the rest of my life without him–at the very least, I could have had a final memory to hold onto. It made no sense to deny me that little kindness. I couldn’t understand how quickly he left, nor could I heal until his absence was any easier to swallow.



Now, laying in bed and writing this out, I know that this monster is ready for me. I have my headphones on, but the quiet laughter coming from the window curtains is unaffected by my attempt to drown it out. 

It seems like no explanation will really make anything better. I’ll plan to update you all tomorrow, maybe by then someone out there will be able to give me some peace of mind on all of this–maybe I’ll have fixed it myself.
