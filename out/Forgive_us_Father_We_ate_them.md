They left a final prayer on the wall, My flashlight hovered over the words, each letter dragging a cold nail down my spine:

**Forgive us, Father. We ate them.**

The flashlight shook in my hand. Not from fear—not at first—but from something worse. Some deeper instinct was waking up inside me, something old and broken, begging me to turn around, run, and pretend I never saw any of this.

The church sagged around me, a corpse of wood and stone, bones poking through where faith once was. The air hung heavy and sticky, buzzing with the kind of silence that only comes after the screaming stops. Pews splintered and overturned. Bones — real bones — scattered like kindling against the walls. A fire pit still burned in the center aisle, its greasy smoke curling along the ceiling like fingers searching for something to pull down.

I didn’t have to wonder what they'd cooked. The bones told me everything. Little ones. Split clean, hollowed out, marrow sucked dry like it was the last edible thing on earth.

And that smell. Fuck. That fucking smell. It hit the back of my throat like a fist. sweet, burnt, wrong — coating my tongue, sticking to my teeth, sinking into my skin like it wanted to stay there.

*Forgive us, Father.*

I stumbled back, tripping over something behind me. I flinched — like it had screamed — and when I looked down, I saw it: a child's shoe, still laced, still neat, like somebody thought they'd be back for it.

My stomach turned. Not from hunger, although I hadn't eaten in days. Not even from horror. From something deeper — the awful, shivering knowledge that if it had been me trapped here long enough... If I had been starving... *Would I have done any different?*

I like to think I would have.

They didn’t bury their dead here. They ate them. And they prayed for forgiveness with their full bellies and blood still wet on their teeth

I turned in a slow, clumsy circle, breathing through my teeth, trying not to gag.

There were so many bones.

Tiny hands. Tiny ribs.

Bits of fabric clinging like dying flags.

They must have sat here, once — all of them — praying for salvation that never came.I pictured them huddled in the pews, whispering desperate prayers between sobs, the fire crackling behind the altar.

And then, when the hunger got too loud, I pictured the silence that followed.

The choosing.

The decision.

The knives.

I squeezed my eyes shut, but the images stayed, stitched behind my eyelids, sewn in with the stink of burnt flesh and the sound of my heartbeat going too fast, too hard.

I stumbled back against the wall, dry heaving so fucking hard enough that spots burst behind my eyes.

Nothing came up as I hadn't eaten in almost two days, but the body remembers even when the belly's empty.

For a second, I wanted to tear at my skin, to rip the stink out of my pores, to scrape the taste off my tongue.

I pressed the back of my hand to my mouth, forcing the bile down, forcing myself to breathe.

It didn’t help.

The walls pressed closer, the fire hissed louder, and somewhere deep inside me, a voice I didn’t recognize whispered:

*You'd have done the same.*

*You'd have eaten too.*

The air was too fucking sweet.  
Too thick.  
It clung to the back of my throat, heavy and greasy, made it feel like I was breathing through syrup.

I stumbled, one hand clamped over my gut, but it didn’t matter.  
The hunger was louder than the nausea.  
Louder than the fear.

**You’d have done the same.**  
**You'd have eaten too.**

I whispered “no” without thinking — shaky, hoarse — but it didn’t sound real.  
Didn’t even sound like me.

I dropped to my knees before I realized what I was doing.  
Ash kicked up around me, sticking to my hands, my skin, my mouth.  
I groped for the flashlight, but my fingers brushed something else.  
Something smooth.  
Something warm.

A bone.

I jerked back like it burned me.  
Felt my chest hitch.  
Felt something crawl up the back of my throat.  
Tried to spit it out.  
Tried to swallow it down.

Didn't matter.

The smell was in my nose.  
The taste was already in my mouth.

And Christ, I wanted it.  
I fucking *wanted it.*

I sat there, gasping, shaking so hard my teeth clattered together, and I knew —  
it wasn’t just the hunger clawing at me anymore.  
It was *me.*

It was what was left.

My fingers closed around the bone like they had a mind of their own.  
And then my mouth.  
My teeth.

And the crack —  
that sick crack of bone splitting —  
echoed off the empty stone walls like a prayer gone wrong.

Hot marrow spilled onto my tongue, thick and bitter and sweet all at once.  
I gagged.  
I swallowed.  
I kept going.

Somewhere deep inside, some last fucked-up piece of me cried.  
Begged.  
Screamed.

But the hunger screamed louder.

It always fucking did.

I wiped the mess off my mouth with the back of my hand, shuddering, heart hammering so hard it hurt.  
I couldn’t even look at the fire.  
Couldn’t look at the bones.

Couldn’t look at myself.

So I closed my eyes.  
I bowed my head like a coward, like a sinner, and I whispered into the smoke:

*Forgive me, Father. I ate them too.*
