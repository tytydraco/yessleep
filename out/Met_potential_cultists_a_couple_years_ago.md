So, I have had this experience a couple years ago now, but I thought I'd share because it's something that will forever stuck with me (no wonder why lol)

When I was in middle school, like 5th-6th grade, a couple of my classmates found an abandoned territory. It didn't have much things in it, just an old shack that was forever locked and a few bricks that was left over there. I'm guessing they wanted to build a small house there, but at the time they never did, and the place kind of just stayed there without being touched. With that, a lot of trespassers went in there, including almost my entire class.

So after we discovered the place, the people who were in this got seperated into two different groups, basically playing a war-game where each of us were fighting for the territory. I remember we even brought our own flags there to mark it. A for of that, almost each time the group I was in went up there, the flags were usually changed. Because of this entire thing, friendships were unnecessarily ruined, and so things changed up a little over the time. 

With that, a part of the group members and some other people and I one time went to this local playground to just hang out and chat about the abandoned place itself, and how we're going to get it back and all that. As time passed, a few people left, so only about 4-5 people were left including me. Well later on, out of nowhere, this little girl came up to us who were about 3-4 years younger than us. She was being extremely pushy and aggressive over-all, and wanted us to play with her constantly. Well, we were raised to be nice and she was a little girl after-all, so we thought why not, just for a little, then we get back to chatting. 

Her 'playing' with us though was a lot more different than what we thought would be. As I mentioned, she was being aggressive, and she kept being mean to us, especially me since I was a fat kid back then, so she made me do more things than my other friends. I remember at one point I cursed because I nearly fell from a monkey bar, and the girl got really offended and told me that she will "act the same way as I do to you". 

Well, my friends responded defensively to that, and they somehow convinced her to just not play these games anymore and to do something else. Later on, my friends left to get something real quick, so I was left alone with the little girl. I tried to make some kind of conversation to maybe get to know her more, and out of nowhere she brought her family up. I asked something like, what her and her family does as playtime or something, and I remember this so vividly, because she full on said "Occasionally, my family goes around my house in circles with black hooded coats on, holding candles while they do so!" 

That freaked me out, I wasn't too sure where to put that at the time. I was really into paranormal and scary stuff back then, but I didn't know if I'd actually hear something like this from a literal conversation, let alone a little girl. After that my friends came back from I'm guessing talking about how we should get away from this girl. We made up a lie that we have to go home soon because we have homeworks and our parents are quite strict about getting home early. So, we started to get going, and guess what, the girl started following us.

We told her that we seriously can't come back after this, and I remember that I went up-front so I can get home first because of how stressing the situation was. So, I went up to the apartment we used to live in, and then I texted one of my friends that they could come up because of how weird this all was. She texted me back alright, and so I waited for her. 

As soon as she came up and I opened the door for her, I noticed that the girl was right behind her. I made eye contact with her, and then I ushered my friend in and closed the door in front of the girl, locking it. I got really angry at my friend and asked her why she brought the girl up, and I remember her saying 

"I wasn't. The girl was sitting right outside the door. I thought you brought her up here?" 

Now, I want to stress the fact that to get into the building itself, you have to type in two codes, one that's on the outside, and one that's on the inside. And, to get into my apartment, you have to go up several floors, and each floor had about 6 different apartments. I told NONE of these to the girl, and to this day, I still have no fucking clue how she knew which apartment I live at exactly. 

I went to my dad after this and told him all what had happened, so he made the girl leave, and then it was all over.

A week or two later however, me and the group talked about visiting the territory again, because a classmate wanted to install new locks to the entire place. I said sure, I'm going to go with them because why not, I didn't have much to do that day anyways.  
About 6 of us including me were going there, me being in the front. As I was going, I was in a conversation with a friend, and we decided to get into the place from the backyard. It had a complicated lock but, we didn't want to go around the entire place, because you'd have to go through a foresty area, and it'd take too much time anyways. 

As we reached the back entrance, I was fiddling with the lock before my friends caught up, and I remember looking up the long stairs that led up to the place itself. I was not ready for the fact that, on the top of the stairs, were about five people dressed in all black, hooded cloaks covering their faces, holding torch-like things, and one of them holding a huge empty, white sign. 

As soon as I saw them, two of the cloaked figures also noticed me, and with that, I told my friends to run, and so we did. 

We ran out of the entire neighborhood and onto the streets. I remember that we also lost like two of my friends because they decided to go to the front entrance, and about a minute or two later they sent a video into a groupchat, out of breath, explaining that they had also seen the cloaked figures. I seriously wish I still have that video, because I'm pretty sure there were glimpses of the figures there, but the app we used had cleaned out all the older messages, so the video is forever lost, probably. 

After this, nothing particularly happened again. There was a huge house fire that was right next to the territory, and that house was also abandoned. What I can theorize is that the cult (?) moved to that place so that we wouldn't find them again? I'm not too sure.

Since then, nothing has happened. I hadn't heard any news of this either, especially because the both abandoned places were cleaned out, and there are actual houses there now.
