We codenamed the jet Skyhawk, the first aircraft ever to have warp drive.  It almost resembled an SR-71 Blackbird, except with a deep sapphire blue finish and with five streamlined engines.  The goal for the first test flight was to reach Puerto Rico from Nevada in less than thirty seconds using wormhole creation.

“Testing airway has been cleared.  Permission granted,” Command Central messaged Skyhawk.

With the acceleration on full throttle, my plane darted across the runway.  Instantly, my back stuck to the chair like a mouse in a glue trap.  I held my chest tightly to prevent the g-forces from crushing my chest like an almond in a nutcracker.  The air from my chest dove into my trachea and punched my lungs from the inside out.

Then, I pulled the wheel back, making it lift off the ground.  After realigning it, I gave her a hard turn to the right.  Clouds started to transform into arrows of white, gold, and gray as she reached Mach 1.

“Desired speed has been reached. Activating warp drive. Over.” I spoke into my earpiece.

I pulled back the warp drive lever.  Before my eyes, maroon fuel cell crystals blended together into a liquid soup, slithering down tubes like soda in some strange Willy Wonka machine.  The g-forces from traveling at Mach 1 already pushed my spine to my seat like a magnet against iron.  With one final push of a button, it activated.  The blood in my torso dropped to my legs like mercury in a barometer in a high pressure air pocket.  Sky surrounding cockpit shifted to a rose quartz pink and the clouds flattened into thin, spider silk thin lines.

Slowly, I counted to fifteen based on my instructions.

Although neither the GPS nor the radar were of any use during this phase, I still was able to determine where I was.

Eight seconds passed.  By that point, I should have passed the southeastern states.

Before I knew it, fifteen seconds had passed.  Then, I released the warp drive lever with a *ker-chunk.*

All that greeted me once I deactivated the mechanism was a black void.

“Was it dawn?” I wondered.  I checked the time on my watch.  

11:00 am.

I knew that I had passed multiple time zones.  Even if it was night, something was up.  There were neither clouds nor stars, only emptiness.

I reduced my speed to conserve my fuel.

“Command Central, this is Skyhawk.  I appear to be in an unidentified destination.  Must have been set off course, but there is literally nothing present here.  What instructions do you have? Over.”

Static came out.  

“This cannot be happening,” I thought.  I closed my eyes, rubbing my temples.

“Command Central, this is Skyhawk.  Do you copy?”

Nothing.  I narrowed my eyes when I looked at the compass; it was spinning faster than an Oklahoma tornado.  My chest rose and fell rapidly.  I gave myself a pinch on the leg to snap myself out of it.

“Command Central, do you copy?”

Nothing changed.  

I pounded my leg in frustration.  Where the hell was I?  I could have not gone THAT far off course.  Ever since I reached Mach 1, I’ve been traveling in a straight line towards the southeast, right where Puerto Rico was, just like my instructions.  Going around in circles was ruled out for an explanation.  

Still, why was my compass behaving so weirdly?  I thrashed my head around to see if I was dreaming this whole thing due to the high g-forces.

I still remained in the pitch black void.  This was real.  Sweat crept down my helmet, pooling into shoulders.

“Oh no,” I said, tugging on my air jacket.  I remembered something critical about Puerto Rico.  Specifically, it was something all sailors and pilots should know.  One of the most well-known sea legends of all time.

It was one of the three locations that marked the Bermuda Triangle.  Based on where I started, I was bound to have crossed it at some point.  Planes and ships sometimes had vanished while crossing it.  No.  This had to be a dream.

I dug my nails into my pants.  “Where the hell am I?!” I shouted in frustration, holding my hands back on the steering wheel.  If I made any other movements, I swore I would lash out in a rage and break anything in sight.

At that point, I had no choice but to keep straight.  If I lowered my altitude, who knows what I might have hit below?  That is, if there were a bottom to this void.

I checked the fuel gauge.  Thank heavens it was almost completely full.

\---

Time slowed down to a snail’s pace.  I gripped the wheel in irritation.  How the hell was I supposed to get out of this situation?  If I steered the aircraft elsewhere to find a possible exit, my trajectory could be incorrectly aligned and I might miss the landing strip.  

Or worse, crash.

The roar of Skyhawk’s afterburners kept me company.  I slowed my breath to conserve my oxygen.  I checked the fuel levels.  They were still high, to my delight.

*Ping. Ping. Ping.*  The radar spontaneously awakened, revealing dozens of flashing dots closing in on my position.  I bit my tongue, looking into the deep void.  Nothing was out there.  If there were any threats outside, Skyhawk was a prototype.  It didn’t have any weaponry.  In that unknown void, I was a sitting duck.

My hands grew clammy.  “Don’t you dare malfunction on me!” I bellowed at the control panel.

*Ping. Ping. Ping.* The dots drew in closer to Skyhawk.  From the radar, they were only one hundred feet away.

To my shock, the void filled up with activity.  Long curtains of what I assumed were clouds hung down from the infinite sky above and plummeted into the bottomless pit.  Each of the smoke-like plumes was punched with irregular, long black spots.

But the thing was, the shapes did not resemble clouds; they were way too thin in appearance.

In one of the columns, there were even a handful of speedboats wedged in the foggy gunk.  Assorted aircraft were stuck in another.

Where did all those aircraft and boats come from?  

Then it hit me.  All of the aircraft and boats were prototypes of some kind.  I had heard that there were previous test subjects before me.

But that didn’t make any sense.  I flew multiple prototype aircraft before without any problem, so why were all these aircraft and boats suddenly winding up here?  I knew the risks of flying these.  Heck, I even knew that people died testing these because this was a trial and error job and it was worth the pay.

But no one had ever told me of this.  Did my superiors know that this mission was suicide and decided to throw me in, forcing me to become another guinea pig?

At the moment, it didn’t matter.  No mass of mist could hold objects that heavy with such little effort.

I started to make out the dots that pockmarked the strange columns.  

I gasped when I finally saw what they truly were: faces contorted in unspeakable agony.  Ghosts.  That explained why the radar suddenly picked up signatures.

*Ping. Ping. Ping.*  The radar started to beep faster than a machine gun.  One of the spiritual columns passed by my wing.

“Shit!” I yelled, veering the plane before I could hit it.  With my mind refocused, I turned back to observe the column.

*KACHUNK!* My trajectory was halted by an unseen force.  It began to reel me back into the mass of spirits like a fly on a frog’s tongue.  Gritting my teeth, I set Skyhawk on full throttle.

She wouldn’t budge.

I wheeled my head around.  Pale white hands by the dozens gripped onto the edges of the window.  Their fingers passed right through the glass and the steel effortlessly.  The air became colder than a polar bear’s skin.  My breath turned into visible frost while the glass began to fog up.  I forced the lever forward, trying to free the Skyhawk from the ghastly muck but to no avail.

Soon, the mist surrounded the cockpit, entrapping the rest of the Skyhawk in a fluid prison of pearl white.

Each spirit wrenched themselves inside headfirst, pulling themselves in and getting a good look at me.  Whenever one of the spirits made any movement, they would release a cry resembling someone drowning.  Every last spirit was human in appearance with black hair.  In each of their heads, there was a gaping hole that replaced their faces.  All of their holes were filled with razor edged hands as thin as toothpicks.  Right in the palms of each of them were mouths damp with putrid, hot slobber.

I screamed in horror at their hideous appearances, chucking the speed lever into high gear.  The speedometer only reached a few miles per hour, the aircraft still rooted into the column and stuck like rubber cement.  I pounded at the control panel in frustration until two of the spirits pinned my back to the seat.  One of the specters tore off the hose leading to my oxygen mask.

“*OXYGEN LEVELS LOW!  OXYGEN LEVELS LOW!*” the intercom blared.  I tried to fasten it back on, but it wasn’t long before they pinned my arms to the cockpit.

One of the spirits tilted its head as if to mock me and shoved a taloned hand into my right leg, ripping out a messy chunk of muscle.  As I opened my mouth to scream, another slid one into my mouth, its cold fingers cracking and snapping as it bent to fit through my nasal cavity.  My sinuses crackled as the phantom tore apart my nose from the inside out.  I forced the lever even harder until I thought the handle would snap off from the force.

Finally, I started to get results.  I peered out into the distance, able to make out a shade of blue right at the far end of the void, just a few kilometers away.  More spirits started to converge onto me, feasting on whatever body part they could reach.  I winced with every bite they took.  While they were focused on devouring me, I was able to clamp back on the oxygen mask.

I forced the lever even farther.  The hands started to pull away from the force of the engines.  One of the spirits roared in my face as it tried to snap off a chunk of my arm.  With the mouths on its hands, it swallowed the piece of flesh whole.

Then, I forced the mechanism all the way until finally, the hands all came off like water on leaves.  The jet pulled back at full force and blazed past all the columns like a shooting star.  As soon as I passed by the opening in the void, it vanished behind me in a vortex of black.

The clouds and sky had returned and the ocean below was churning like fruit in a blender.  Below the aircraft, I could see the runway.  The blood loss had drained the life force out of me.  I snapped myself awake and aligned the wheels with the pavement, setting the jets in reverse to stop it.  

When the Skyhawk came to a halt, maintenance, medics, and my superior rushed over to the aircraft, yanking off my mask.  Instantly, they loaded me onto a stretcher while my bosses asked me what happened.

Despite me showing the wounds to my superiors, they all just brushed them off as self-inflicted.  They said that the g-forces must have screwed up my head, making me harm myself.  Furthermore, they said that I there must have been something wrong with the navigation as I was only gone for about fifteen minutes.  I just rolled my eyes at them incredulously.

It wasn’t until a few days later that they started believing my story when they sent out a pilot to do another aircraft test.  They said that they came back alive, but that their communication was broken spontaneously.  The aircraft took a nosedive right into the Atlantic and there were no signs that they had even ejected.  The only trace left behind was a human silhouette, similar to those in the aftermath of Hiroshima.  Checking the cameras for a lead, they saw a figure with hands inside a gaping hole on their head.  The following day after that incident, a scientist in a research boat disappeared into a black whirlwind, or so it’s said by eyewitnesses.

To those that are reading this, until my supervisors have an explanation, if you must travel to a new country, stick to land.
