For the first few months after Thom Mann and his family moved into our street, everyone thought they were just normal people.   
  
They looked normal. Acted normal. Said the normal sorts of things everyone says.   
  
Thom and I were in the same class, and because we were next-door neighbours we walked to school together and became friends. His mom worked at home and looked after his little sister, and his dad drove to an office in the industrial site out of town every day. I cannot remember, looking back, one unusual thing Thom said in those first few months that might have given away who they actually were.   
  
I guess I mean, what they actually were.   
  
I suppose, if I thought hard about it, it might have been the day we were kicking a ball around idly after school, with a few other kids. I think it was Kurt who kicked it harder than he should, and it went flying over, straight towards the Manns’ living room window. I could just see the fair head of his sister, bobbing around behind the window.  
  
I thought at the time the sun must have got into my eye. I saw Thom -not exactly jump or leap like a normal boy- but kind of flutter upwards, his shoulders twitching back and forth in a motion I’ve never seen in a human. He went high above the ground, stretched out his arms, and caught the ball.   
  
Then he landed lightly on his feet.   
  
There was silence.   
  
Kurt said “what are you- a ninja NBA player or something?”  
  
Thom shrugged “Whatcha talking about man, it wasn’t that high. Here!” and he drop-kicked the ball straight at Kurt. The game resumed, and no one said anything else.   
  
But I had seen his face shimmer in the afternoon sun as he fluttered upwards to get the ball. It wasn’t a normal human face.    
  
Kurt had seen it too. We looked at each other and shrugged.   
  
We started dropping off home one by one for our suppers. After Thom left, Kurt said “You know they drive out of town most nights?”  
  
“So?”  
  
“That’s not weird? My bedroom window faces their garage. They leave almost every evening around ten. I’ve been up at midnight and they haven’t been back.”  
I didn’t know what Kurt wanted to hear. Sophia said “He gives me creep vibes.”   
  
We rolled our eyes at her. Everyone gave her creep vibes.   
  
The strike at the industrial site must have happened a few weeks after that. I had been hearing about it, some boring adult thing. But then one morning Thom mentioned his dad was staying home these days “It’s so fucking hard”.  
  
I looked at him. He looked grey, fatigued. His skin and eyes looked off. I thought it was the dad being at home.   
  
Then he said “We can’t get to the site at nights. It’s not lit anymore because of the strike. We need the lights.”  
  
I remembered what Kurt had said. “Do you go- I mean- visit the site at nights?” I asked.   
  
He shrugged. “There’s no-one there. Bright lights”.   
  
“What?”  
  
I felt like I was stepping into another reality. His face was shimmering again, it looked like when he fluttered off the ground to get the ball. Not human. His eyes bulged, his mouth and nose elongating.   
  
I cried out.   
  
The sound seemed to bring Thom back to human-ness. He shook his head. “Forget it man. It’s cool.” He began walking faster than me.   
  
That night, I was awakened by a huge cry. I jerked out of bed, grabbing my phone. It was only half ten.   
  
I heard my parents going down the stairs. And without knowing why, I got out of bed to follow them out.  
  
All the block  was pouring into the street. We gathered round, staring at Thom Mann and his family, fluttering fifteen feet above the ground, their faces close to the burning bright lamps of the street light. The harsh light picked out their dark butterfly-shaped wings, stretched out behind them, and at first I didn’t even notice their faces, their mesmerized bulging eyes staring into the light.   
  
Then I did, almost the same time as everyone else. I heard Sophia’s scream “They’re monsters!”  
  
  
An angry ripple went through the crowd watching them. “Call the police!” “We’ll get ‘em when they come down” “Shoot ‘em now!”  
  
Kurt and the other boys who played ball together pushed forward, I joined them. We circled the lamp pole. I stared at the angry darkly-lit confused faces.   
  
“Leave them be!” shouted Kurt.   
  
The crowd jostled up. Angry twisted faces of our neighbours pushed into my face, I felt myself shoved, and I remembered every youtube video I’d seen about people being killed in and by crowds. A punch landed on my cheek, and my head snapped back. I didn’t feel anything, but I lashed out and blood splattered on my knuckles. I felt it then.   
  
A louder cry went up. The crowd pulled back. The Manns were fluttering down.  
  
They circled us, and then, their wings flapping madly, drifted into their house. Silence fell.   
  
Slowly, as if in a dream, the neighbours dispersed. I followed my mom and dad back home.   
  
In the morning, the Manns were gone. We never saw or heard of them again.
