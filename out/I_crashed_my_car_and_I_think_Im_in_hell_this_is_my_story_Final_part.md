Hey kid, I’m sorry to wake you up this way, but I can’t endure another loss. I’m sorry I’ve been so secluded, I’ve kept a lot of secrets from you, secrets that you had a right to know about.  
  
I’ll begin by telling you the story of how I lost my family and how we ended up here in the first place. Me, my wife Carla and our son Alex were going on a trip, we were heading south, just like you. We were supposed to visit Carla’s older sister since it was her 50th birthday. I never liked her sister, she was a bit of a bitch, if you’ll excuse my language. Since Carla was so afraid of flying, we had to drive all the way down to Wisconsin. We were on the same dirt road as you and the drive was going great, Carla was in high spirits as usual and Alex, well he was quiet as usual. Until I saw that damned pick-up, the same one you saw. Soon as I saw it, I knew something was up. And I was right. I won’t waste your time telling you details about the crash, this time I’m not hiding anything, I promise.  
  
Miraculously, we all survived, or that’s what I thought at the time. To be honest, I think it’d be better if we all just died on the spot. I was the first one to wake up, I looked to my right and saw my bleeding wife and thought I had lost her, but she woke up after a few seconds of panicked yelling and so did our son. We got up and out of the car and tried to dial 911, but none of us had service. I tried climbing a tree to get higher up, despite the injuries I had sustained but, it still didn’t work. We had just recently moved to Maine, which was my wife’s choice, by the way. And since Alex still hadn’t gotten himself a job, he moved here with us. So, I didn’t know where we were. My first thought was to follow the road back where we came from, but I was way too scared of that pick-up, there was just something sinister about it, I couldn’t admit that to them though.  
  
After checking up with each other and making sure we were all okay, we heard the snapping, we all heard it right behind us even though we stood in different places. I told them to run and I followed after them. After hours of trying to escape the snapping, we stumbled upon this cabin. I knocked and yelled for whoever was in there to please help us, but I didn’t get an answer. I broke in and it was empty. We stayed there for days, stealing the food that was in there and trying to get service to call 911.  
  
Needless to say, it never worked. Soon, our phones died and we didn’t have any chargers. We were all alone in this place. I had already suspected that something was wrong with this place but soon I’d get my confirmation. I walked out the front door one day, only to be met with thick snow falling from the sky, in the middle of August.  
  
I went out to look for help a few days later, I insisted my wife and son stay in the cabin but, it was impossible to convince my wife to stay. She was always so stubborn. Me and my wife were walking in the dark, staying as quiet as possible. We saw the old fisherman in the distance, as we got closer it seemed he got further away at the same pace, even though he was clearly standing still. A few moments later I heard the snapping, as I turned to look at my wife who seemingly hadn’t heard the snapping since she hadn’t said anything, all I saw when I turned was her hand, she was gone. All that was left was her hand, it was sliced off clean, like with a laser or something. I screamed out and called for her as I ran back towards the cabin. She never showed herself, I had lost my wife without even having a chance to save her. By the time I had gotten close enough to see the clearing the cabin stood on, my son heard my screams. He ran out and called out to me as he ran towards me, his last words were: “Dad, where’s mom?” I didn’t even have time to tell him to run back, as soon as he crossed the border of the clearing, I saw a white flash and then, his head was gone. Sliced off clean just like Carla’s hand.   
  
I buried him behind the cabin with a shovel I had found in the cabin. I felt completely empty, normally I think my first thought would’ve been to kill myself, but for some reason I didn’t.  
  
The days passed as I tried to find a reason to keep going, until one day when I found a purpose. To kill the old fisherman, everything went to shit just as I saw him. As I thought more and more about him I got more and more convinced it was his fault. I stayed here for years, looking for him, but the only other person I ever found was you. By the time you ended up here, I was starting to lose hope, my rage was starting to fade. I’m ashamed to say it kid, but you kept me going. You never admitted it but I could see it in your eyes, your undying urge to fight and get out of this place. At first it did rub off on me but, now that you’ve told me about your encounter with the fisherman, I can’t go on for longer. I can’t witness one more person get taken.  
  
Goodbye kid.  
  
PS: You can take the shotgun and the rifle if you want.  
  
RC  
  
I didn’t know how to react or what to feel, I was still empty. The only question I had was how I couldn’t hear Russell shoot himself, how could I have slept through a shotgun blast? And that was my second question, a shotgun? Russ had never mentioned a shotgun. I really didn’t wanna go back in there, especially not when I knew why he did it. But what choice did I have? I didn’t have anything to defend myself with.  
  
I went back into Russell’s room, grabbed the rifle and went out. I took a deep breath and prepared myself to walk back in and grab the rifle from Russell’s lap. It was easier than I expected. I swear it was like, every time I saw his body I got more empty, it felt like my soul was phasing out into nothingness.  
  
I didn’t get much sleep after this whole thing. It felt like I didn’t need any sleep. I spent… I don’t know how long, just staring at the wall in my room. As night came… maybe the night after Russ died? Or maybe the night after that? Anyway, as night came I decided to look out the window, to see if the old fisherman was there. And there he was, the bad omen himself. I just stared at him, I didn’t feel anything. I wasn’t scared and I wasn’t intrigued like before. All of a sudden he disappeared, I didn’t waste any time looking for him, I just closed the curtains and laid down. Eventually I fell asleep.  
  
I woke up to my pitch black room, the only thing I could see was a faint, cold blue light that somewhat revealed the figure of a man. Of course, it was the old fisherman. I tried to reach for the rifle that was leaning against my bed, but I couldn’t move a muscle. My breathing became shaky and violent, I thought the fisherman had come to finish me off himself.  
  
“I am sorry for using such… crude methods, young man.” - A voice called out from the darkness.  
  
“Although, I suspect you might have blown me to smithereens if I didn’t take these precautions.” - The old man jested.  
  
“...I know you can’t respond to me for the moment, but I assure you, there is a good reason for that.” - The man said as he slowly made his way to me, his heavy boots thumping on the old hardwood floor.  
  
As he stood over me by the side of my bed, he lightly tapped his stick or staff or whatever it was on the floor. And as he did, the faint blue light that emanated from the lantern that hung on his stick grew into a bright, blinding light, almost like those at the dentist. He stood silent, presumably to give me some time to adjust to the bright light. As I tried to open my eyes, he started speaking again.  
  
“I assume you are frightened, young man. I assure you, there is nothing to be afraid of. I am sure you don’t believe me when I tell you that, so I shall put your worries to rest, once again.”  
  
The man slowly reached for his fishing hat that covered half of his face, all I could really see was part of his mouth since his thick, overgrown, snow-white beard covered everything else there was to see. He slowly took it off to reveal an unexpected bald head.  
  
“I take it you didn’t recognize me the first time we met… How about it? Do you recognize me now?... Kid?  
  
Kid? This dude had never called me “kid” before, he seemed to quite enjoy calling me “young man”. I stared at him with lowered eyebrows for a few seconds, until I realized. It was Russell, even though it looked like he had aged about 30 years, I could clearly see it was him. He had the same mole over his left eyebrow.  
  
“Russell?” - I managed to squeeze out his name as tears started to well up in my eyes.  
  
The old fisherman raised his eyebrows in surprise, seemingly surprised that I managed to say anything while being in this sort of trance he had presumably put me in.  
  
“In a way, yes, I am Russell Cook, only through my perspective, I have been here for decades upon decades. You see, time doesn’t exist here, or rather it exists but not in the way you can comprehend. When something of your world comes in contact with this dimension, a sort of… ripple, spreads out, causing all kinds of strange things to happen, as you’ve witnessed.”  
  
I was still just staring at him with a confused look on my face.  
  
“The Russell you know is effectively, not real. He is an alternate version, one who took his own life and - somewhere out there - there is another one, who is still alive. Rest assured though, you are the real you, you are the real David.”  
  
How did he know my name? I hadn’t even told Russell my name.  
  
“And I am here to make sure you do not meet the same fate as me, to see versions of yourself lose everything over and over again, just as I did all those years ago.”  
  
“If you recall the first time we met, you will remember when I said that “he” does not want you dead, well, this “he” is looking for you, he is hunting you down. You are the last original in this place. I do not know what this man’s plan is, or why he wants all the originals dead, all I know is that he hunts you.”  
  
Just as the man said so, a loud, rumbling sound of an engine roared in the distance. I could swear I felt the sound vibrate the whole cabin. As the sound erupted, the old fisherman looked behind him, towards the door.  
  
“Young man, we are running out of time, you have to reach the place from where you came, go back, to where he trapped you here.”  
  
The man tapped his stick against the floor, this time much harder. Instantly, the blue light became so bright my ears started ringing and my head started pounding. It was over as soon as it started, I opened my eyes to see my room again. The old fisherman was gone and I was all alone, again.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
As I sat there in my uncomfortable bed, thinking about the old fisherman’s words, I didn’t feel scared and I wasn’t having any second thoughts. My best bet was to trust him and follow his advice, to go back to the place where I crashed.  
  
I got up and put all of my gear on, I even made a makeshift “shotgun holder” on the hiking backpack that I had borrowed from the hardware store. It was no doubt the best “DIY” thing I had done in my life but I had no time to be proud of myself. I grabbed the last thing, the rifle, and headed out. If I’d make it out alive or not wasn’t even something I was thinking about, it was like my mind and body were running on autopilot.  
  
My next obstacle was to find out in which direction I’d need to go to come back to the place where it all began. I remembered that I had headed south after the crash and after Russell rescued me, we kept going south. Maybe we had strayed from the path somewhat while in the forest on the way to the cabin, hell, I probably strayed from my path while I was running through the forest before I found the gas station. I didn’t have time to procrastinate though, all I could do was head north, and so I did.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
As I crossed the border of the clearing, I looked back at the clearing and muttered my goodbyes to Russell. Part of me doing this, fighting to escape, was for Russell, even though he wasn’t the “real” Russell, he was real to me, I’d escape because he never got the chance to. As I walked through the woods, making sure every few seconds that the red triangle in my compass was still facing north, I thought about what alternate versions might exist of me in this place. Had I even been here long enough for alternate versions of me to exist? Are they even real if they do exist? How can someone else exist, that is… me? How can they have the same life story and thoughts of their own? The whole concept was mind boggling, when it’s a real thing, it makes you think a whole lot more about it than when you see it in pop culture, I can tell you that much.  
  
I started thinking about Russell, about how he was so… real. How can a “clone” be so… real, to the point where he takes his own life? How didn’t I hear it when he did it? Could I have helped him? Were there any signs that I just didn't pick up on? My mind had become a mess at this point, I didn’t even know how long I’d been walking, I wasn’t out of the forest quite yet, so it couldn’t have been more than an hour.  
  
As my mind kept racing, the chattering of my thoughts was suddenly broken by a rustling sound to my right. I let down Russell’s rifle from my shoulder and aimed it towards the sound. Suddenly, I heard the same sound, this time from behind me. And again, to my left. Soon, the rustling sound was coming from everywhere. I didn’t have time to speculate on what or who made those sounds, I started running as I put the rifle back on my shoulder, took the compass out and pointed it south. I almost fell as I did so, but I had to keep going. I ran and ran, my breathing was frantic, but strangely, there weren’t any thoughts in my mind, I still wasn’t scared. Was this how Russell felt?  
  
I was out of the woods, as I crossed the border I started to slow down. I looked back to the woods, that’s when I saw them. A whole pack of scratchers, skittering around in the bushes, making aggravated growls in frustration, as if they couldn’t cross the border. I felt a sudden wave of anger, I hated those little shits, the terror they had put me through. I let down my rifle, aimed it towards them and fired two shots. The rifle’s recoil did hurt my shoulder, I was no macho man by any means. I heard one of them cry out in pain as the others ran away. I didn’t go back to finish it off, I wanted it to suffer - and besides - I didn’t have any time to waste. So I turned around and kept going north.  
  
As I walked at a fast pace through the grass field, I looked down at the low hanging mist making way for my legs, I started thinking again. What would I do once I got out of this place? Would I get teleported again? Would I be back at that dirt road? How did that man in the pick-up send me to this place? Was he capable of crossing into the real world? As I pondered, I noticed something in the distance, it was the gas station, only this time it was completely dilapidated. It felt like I hadn’t seen it in ages, when in reality, it was just a few days ago. I guess this place messes with your perception of time as well, or maybe it was just due to the fact that so much has happened these last few days. As I got closer and walked past it, I paused for a moment to look back at it, the image of it was haunting in a way, it felt like a sort of metaphor. Just like my sense of humanity and my understanding of reality, the building was completely broken down. I sat down on the slope that led up to the woods and took a break. I stared at the gas station for a few moments before letting my back rest against the grass, I looked up at the dull, gray sky as my mind started to wander again.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
After 15 minutes or so, I was ready to start walking again. I stood up, turned around and began my - hopefully - last walk in this place. As I entered the forest, I felt a… sinister feeling, I guess you could say. It was like everything just got a little darker and… less detailed. It’s hard to explain. Nonetheless, I ignored it and kept walking towards my goal. Despite the sinister atmosphere, this walk through the woods was pretty peaceful, no monster encounters, no fisherman encounters, no nothing. Just the sound of my footsteps.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Hours had passed and I had now reached my destination, honestly, I didn’t know what I expected, but it sure as hell wasn’t what I saw. My car looked like it had stood there for decades, maybe 70 years or so. It was completely rusted, mold was growing in the interior, the mirrors were completely useless and the whole thing just looked ancient. It looked like a car you’d see at a dump in a movie, in the middle of the desert in Arizona or something. It was surreal to say the least.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
As I walked around my car, inspecting it in awe, I started hearing a sort of humming sound coming from a little further down the dirt road, it came from the direction I had initially come from. As I walked closer to the sound, it grew louder. It was strange how fast the sound grew, maybe it was because it just got louder instead of me getting closer, but after walking only about 50 feet it had gotten deafeningly loud. I didn’t wanna put my rifle back on my shoulder so I just decided to deal with the sound. There was another sound though… and if I had noticed this other sound just a few seconds later, I’d have been dead. It was the pick-up, it came out of nowhere from behind me.   
  
As I narrowly evaded the truck, it drove right past me. I didn’t know how to react so I brought up my rifle and aimed it towards the truck and fired three shots. Unsurprisingly, it wasn’t very effective, a few bullet holes in the back side of the truck was all of the damage I inflicted. As soon as the bullets had hit the car, whoever was driving slammed the brakes and turned the truck around. It started driving towards me, I fired multiple shots through the windshield as it got closer but I somehow didn’t hit the driver. At the last second, I dove down into the ditch to my left. I rolled down a few feet before rolling right into a tree, it hurt like hell but I needed to get up again. As I walked back up towards the dirt road, I saw the brake lights of the truck, he was gonna turn around and try to hit me again. As I crouched and took aim towards the truck, a familiar voice called out from behind me.  
  
“Unless my eyes are deceiving me, it looks like you’re in quite big trouble, young man.” - The old fisherman said as the sound of tires grinding against the dirt road could be heard in the distance.  
  
I immediately turned my head around and saw the old man through my peripheral vision.  
  
“Yeah! And unless you wanna die I think it’s best to get out of here!” - I exclaimed.  
  
“The idea of death does not worry me, young man” - The fisherman said as he let out a chuckle.  
  
I turned back towards the truck, it was coming right at us at full speed. It seemed like whoever was driving this truck, wasn’t afraid of driving right down into the ditch if it meant killing me.  
  
“We have no time for this, keep searching for the light, young man! And when you find it, don’t hesitate, just jump into it!” - The man’s voice grew louder and louder as the truck got closer.  
  
Without responding I turned tail and ran. The humming sound was still getting louder and louder, it almost swallowed up the sound of the roaring engine of the truck. After running for a while, the sound had grown way too loud, I put the rifle on my shoulder and covered my ears. I started awkwardly jogging with both of my hands covering my ears, all I knew was that I was looking for a light. Suddenly, as I was hurrying along the side of the dirt road, the sound started coming from behind me instead of in front of me. I slowly walked back, observing my surroundings and that’s when I saw it. A faint, blue light coming from under the damp dirt that laid in the ditch. Without hesitation, I started digging towards the light with the stock of the rifle, I must’ve dug a foot in or so after only a minute.  
  
Just a few moments later, I had unearthed the strange light. It was a fleshy, blue-glowing bulb, almost like a cross between some sort of mushroom and meat. I couldn’t see the ends of it, but I could see it had a round, globe-like shape. I dug around the blue thing until I could fit through the hole. I thought this would take too long so I looked to where the fisherman had stood. I realized the truck wasn’t running, it stood there with the driver’s side door open. From behind the truck, the fisherman came out, he was backing away from something. The fisherman now stood on the edge of the dirt road, the steep ditch behind him. I heard him say something, I couldn’t quite pick up what exactly he said, but judging by the tone, he said something to the effect of “don’t come any closer”. And just as the words left his mouth, the man who had been driving the truck also came out from behind it. The old fisherman saw that his words had no effect, he looked towards me one last time before slamming the end of his long, straight stick into the ground. The light in the lantern on the other end grew, lighting up the surrounding area like a spotlight. The driver raised his forearm over his face, covering his eyes from the blinding light. As he let down his arm, I felt the coldest chill run down my spine.  
  
It was my dad, the man who drove the truck was my dad. He had the same, thick black beard and the exact same face. Before the old fisherman had time to react, the driver took a couple of strong, stomping steps towards him before thrusting a machete right through his chest. There is no way any man could thrust such a broad weapon through someone’s chest like it was no big deal. As the old fisherman slumped down to his knees, the driver put a foot on the fisherman’s shoulder and pulled the machete out. I was completely frozen, how could this be possible? Had my dad been in this place before? Had he been hiding this from all of us? After letting the fisherman drop dead at his feet, he turned his gaze towards me. His cold, uncanny stare that was so familiar yet so alien snapped me right out of my trance.  
  
I started digging again in panic, looking up towards the driver every few seconds. Eventually, his walk towards me turned into a jog, which turned into a sprint. He was getting closer quickly.  
  
“Come on!” - I exclaimed as I started digging faster.  
  
My arms and shoulders were starting to cramp up, I couldn’t keep digging. I threw the rifle away, took my backpack off, took a few steps back and dove into the hole headfirst.  
  
It was like a blink, it was instantaneous. I was back in the real world. The thing that hit me first was the heat, I had gotten so used to the cold that it almost shocked me. I took my jacket off and stared up into the sky, it was nighttime. The stars dotted across the sky was something I’d never take for granted again. I was standing on the dirt road again, I was a little scared that the man who drove the pick-up truck was gonna come back for me, but I figured there wasn’t much I could do if he did come back since I wasn’t armed anymore. So, I started walking back, towards the interstate where I had made the worst mistake of my life.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I hitched a ride from a nice, middle-aged couple that were heading back to Brunswick, which coincidentally was where I was going too. When I got home, I didn’t want to think about this whole thing for even a second, not about Russ, the fisherman… who was also Russell? And neither did I want to think about the driver. The worst thing about this whole thing wasn’t seeing a headless corpse of a new friend or getting attacked by monsters. The worst part about it is the fact that my last memory of my father will forever be of that man, that imposter.
