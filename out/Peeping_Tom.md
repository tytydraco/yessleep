Jail really sucks. I just got out, they released me, but I still have to stand trial, and that moment in court was just the arraignment. I didn’t know what that meant until I was standing there in court, hands cold, trying not to look at anyone. The prosecutor read out the charge: "Voyeurism in the First Degree".

It sounded worse than I’d imagined. Like I was some kind of predator. I wanted to explain, to say it wasn’t like that, but my lawyer told me to stay quiet.

The judge asked if I understood the charge. I said: "yes."

Then they talked about bail, and my lawyer argued for release on recognizance. Said I wasn’t a flight risk, that I’d lived in the same building for twelve years, that I had no priors. He didn’t mention that I was the landlord. I think he was trying to protect me.

The prosecutor did mention it. Said the victim lived in my building, that I had access. That I’d violated trust. I felt my stomach drop. I didn’t look at her. I didn’t look at anyone.

The judge agreed to release me, but with conditions. I’m not allowed within fifty feet of her unit. I had to hand over all keys. I’m barred from entering the east stairwell, the laundry room, and the basement or anywhere she might be. I wear an ankle monitor now. It buzzes if I cross the invisible lines they drew around her space.

I have to pay twenty dollars per day to wear this thing, and I'll have to wear it until the trial. My lawyer says that, considering the circumstances, I'll probably have a reduced sentence, if they even find me guilty of anything.

This is my chance to explain myself, to clear my good name.

I just read what I wrote below, and it sounds crazy, but I swear it is all true. That thing really exists, and it is still out there.

My first encounter with the hair clog was, well, as a clog, like, in the drain.

I snaked it out for Mrs. Peachtree, and there it was. I stared at it for a moment, somehow sensing it was staring back at me. I shuddered, feeling the wrongness of it.

The clog dangled from the end of the wire's hook, looking almost like a wig of long dark hair. It had all kinds of globules of slime and white fuzz and twisted tangles and it was dripping tea-colored liquid. The odor was appalling, and I gagged on it and it slipped from the hook. I retched into the toilet next to me while the matted thing plopped back into the tub.

There it slid, no slithered, yes it slithered, into the drain and easily went in and vanished. I was dumbfounded, and I poured more drain cleaner in. I tried to fish it out with the wire, feeling around for it, but it seemed it had gone down the drain.

"Everything okay in here. Mr. Thomas?" Mrs. Peachtree asked. I shivered, feeling the first moment of fear from that first encounter. I nodded, but I felt weird. I've never seen anything like that, and I don't believe in weird stuff.

Later on that day, Mrs. Peachtree's daughter, Ruth, came to visit her mother. I've met Ruth before; she used to come spend the summer with her mom. She's all grown up now - actually, I realize I shouldn't comment on her appearance, considering I now have this unfair reputation as some kind of pervert. I assure you, I am not like that, really, I'm not.

Ruth came running down the hallway, screaming in bloody terror. When I caught her, she hit me and then, wild eyed, shrieked, hysterical: "She's dead!"

There was this odd way she said the word 'dead', like she'd never said the word before in her life. Not like *that* she hadn't.

I went and looked, after handing Ruth over to Caroline (my same alleged voyeurism victim). She'd opened her door wearing a towel, and yes, I'd glanced at her and she'd frowned at me, but I didn't intentionally notice anything. She was wearing a too-small of a towel, and when I turned she was standing there. I didn't look at her on-purpose.

Never-the-less, I could tell by the look in her eyes that she was offended by my gaze, because I did look up and meet her eyes. After she had Ruth with her, sobbing and shaking, I went to go check on Mrs. Peachtree.

The retired elementary school teacher was dead and lying sprawled outside her shower, where she'd fallen face-first. I thought she'd died accidentally, so I covered her up before anyone else saw her like that, throwing some towels over her butt. I'd sorta averted my gaze until I got the towels over her and then I took a closer look, and reached down to check her pulse on her neck.

That is when I noticed the indented flesh of her throat, like someone had hanged her and then removed the rope, leaving only the marks. My fingers came away from her neck with a long string of slimy mucous, and it smelled of Drano and that horrible smell from that clog I'd pulled out.

For a moment, I just sat there in shock and horror. Then I felt it, the utter dread of some malevolent thing watching you. I turned and looked, my face and eyes darting around until I looked up, in the corner of the shower, behind me. It was there.

It looked like a foul, inky cobweb. It had tendrils of its hair spread out in all directions, holding its position through tension and stickiness. I felt terrified, because what was that thing? What was that? Then it dropped into the tub with a sick wet sound and it wriggled and moved to the drain.

I screamed in panic, trying to move myself away from it and landing atop Mrs. Peachtree. As I struggled to get off of her, all the towels fell away and my hands were slipping over her wet skin as I tried to climb to my feet to get away from whatever that thing was.

At that moment, Caroline had entered, and she only saw me all over Mrs. Peachtree, scrambling to get to my feet.

"Did you see that?" I asked, my face red and sweaty.

"Get off of her, you sick weirdo!" Caroline snarled at me.

"She's dead." I pled, as though death took priority over whatever she was freaking out about. She backed away from me, now wearing a bathrobe.

"You're gross." She spat.

Someone in the hallway had called for paramedics, but I am pretty sure she was all-the-way dead already. They wheeled her out, and Ruth was devastated. I felt awful for the poor girl, I'd seen her grow up, I knew her and her mother. Seeing her that way broke my heart.

The next day, Caroline called me because her drain was clogged. I went to her apartment, and she was glaring at me, but she said: "I didn't mean to yell at you. I was shocked."

"It's alright. I realized that you must have seen me tumbling over her. I took a fright when I realized she was dead." I'd kept saying 'realized' but for some reason I'd slurred it twice and said '*real eyes*' both times. Caroline blinked, and I guess that was a Freudian slip, because I really felt like the look in her eyes was sincere. At that moment, she was seeing me for who I am, and not the creepo she thinks I am now.

I started by plunging the drain in her tub, because it was completely blocked. I felt some trepidation, as I worried that thing was still moving through the pipes, searching for another victim to strangle.

For an agonizing amount of time, I worried and felt anxiety that it would burst out of the drain and wrap around my face. I kept working, but the fear was real.

I managed to get her drain unclogged, and she said it was good because she was going to be late if she didn't get a shower and go.

She didn't see me out, and because I was deathly afraid of what might happen to her, I didn't actually leave her apartment. I didn't really have a plan, I was so shaken and paranoid that it might get her, that I just slammed her door like I'd left. Then I crept back towards the bathroom.

When the water was running and I heard the sound of someone stepping into the tub, the grind of the shower curtain shutting, I cracked the door. I watched, just a little bit, just the thinnest, slightest crack in the door. From where I stood, I could almost see the drain hole, but she was hidden behind the rest of the door. I wasn't even tempted; I was there to make sure nothing got her.

Suddenly, she started screaming in total panic. I flung open the door, but there was no hair monster attacking her. Instead, she was completely exposed and pointing at me with a mixture of terror and rage in her screams.

I backed away, and the bathroom door shut and locked. She was screaming at me to get out of her apartment and I did. I went home to my place.

There I sat and waited. It wasn't long until the police arrived. Now I don't know what to do, I can't protect anyone with the monitoring. I've heard that in the adjacent buildings, there were two more deaths, deaths by strangulation or murder. The police have no leads.

Six more weeks and I will be free from the monitoring and the trial. I have stockpiled drain cleaners, plumber's snake, drain augur and motorized roto-rooter. I am going to hunt that thing down, clear my name, and avenge Mrs. Peachtree.

I'm still terrified of that thing, but I'm taking my terrror, and I am going to fight back, and earn my freedom.
