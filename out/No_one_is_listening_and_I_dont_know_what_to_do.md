I know how this sub works. I know you’re not going to believe me even while you pretend you do because that’s the theme. 

That’s exactly why I came here. I need you to lie to me so I can lie to myself. Pretend you’re going to do something about it and then move on with your life and forget what you saw. I need the plausible deniability this sub gives me and I think you’ll understand once you see what I need off my chest.

I work in a semi-classified position that liaises between the CDC and the military on a mostly as needed basis to help investigate the origins of pathogens when there’s a question of possible bioweapons in play. 

It sounds super interesting but I say “semi-classified” because, while I’m not allowed to talk about what I do on a daily basis, nothing about my job ever really stays classified for long aside from some of the more advanced tools of the trade. Usually the whole process is done before the media finds out anything weird happened at all. We’re in and out like we were never there. I fly out, do some interviews, take some samples, there’s some tech involved that I can’t describe but suffice it to say that it’s an easy process and we can have some pretty confident answers basically overnight. The paperwork is usually the longest part of the whole thing.

30 years I’ve been doing this and the only time I’ve ever had to deal with a complicated case myself was that Anthrax incident since it was actually being used as a bioweapon. Even COVID was smooth for me since our part was pretty cut and dry. Clearly no signs of foul play and vaccines could be quick to the scene? COVID was like a vacation compared to what's going on now.

August last year is when the streak changed. We knew before getting on the plane that it wasn’t a manmade outbreak but we were told this case needed a special touch anyway so twelve of us were called to a remote area in the mountains somewhere. I’m not going to tell you which country but I’ll tell you it’s probably not any of the top 5 you’d think of first. There were multiple reports of sudden acute blindness occurring to everyone in multiple families in homes within a few hundred meters of one another. No one had recovered yet so there was no word on prognosis but early word from the locals was “it doesn’t look good”.

By the time we got there the next day, a 9 year old boy in another home nearby had started showing signs of blindness oncoming. We took all the samples and got the lab running while we took interviews but aside from the location, no one could list any recent exposure to link them all together. One woman even had an incredibly restrictive diet due to another underlying illness so we were able to easily rule out a foodborne pathogen.

Symptoms seemed to start generally about 2 days prior to sight starting to get impacted and included difficulty sleeping, general fatigue, headache and a looming sense of dread. Sight loss was described to start as a dark black spot somewhere in their vision of one eye that quickly started pulsing outward in a branching pattern while the other eye would fade out very quickly all at once. This stage was accompanied by the aforementioned early symptoms in ever increasing intensity. The pain could generally be eased with drugs but the constant primal terror these patients were experiencing was nauseating to watch all on its own.

Over the course of the next 2 days we kept the boy under close observation to understand how his symptoms would progress. Once he indicated he’d lost sight in a spot of his left eye, it was clear the reason why; a small section of his retina had actually begun to flake off and was hanging like a piece of dead skin you should have stopped picking at. It only took a couple more hours worth of observation to see the pattern emerging. The reason they saw their sight vanishing in a branching pattern was because it was propagating along their optic nerve, likely starting from the point of initial infection and running along the nerve from there until making its way to the optical cortex which is when the sight in the other eye would go and then it would continue on from there.

Once the darkness took him, his fear really took off. Hallucinations swooped in immediately to replace the sight he lost and the things he described sounded like he was trying to write a cosmic horror story. I’m not going to go too deep into it because the hallucinations weren’t consistent across patients so you’re not going to find some assertion of hidden truths here. My best guess is that everyone just sees the things that give them that pure existential dread as the infection liquefies the brain one neuron at a time.

If I end up in my death bed the same way, I bet I’m going to be taken back to those last few hours of sitting with that boy taking excruciatingly detailed notes of his painless, quivering terror of the “galaxy spider” that was haunting him. My only comfort when I see this scene again in my nightmares is knowing that every patient reported immediate and total relief of pain with a pretty nominal dose of morphine. We haven’t figured out why such a small amount works so well but I’ll take the small mercy. I don’t even want to imagine what it would feel like if it was as painful as it looks.

While I was on bed duty with the boy, a colleague was on watch with the first infected family and had the immense displeasure of being the first to witness the advanced progression as the father’s left eye >!swelled shut and then continued to swell internally until it was ejected out of the socket entirely!<. My colleague’s notes on the night ended there so I’ll respect his wishes and not commit the story he told me from there to writing. Thankfully it seems about 60% expire prior to symptoms progressing to that state. And I really do mean “thankfully” here because ultimately there is a 100% mortality rate once symptoms are reported so the earlier you go out, the better.

At this point you might already have a guess of what we’re looking at here. It’s rabies. That’s why this is so huge. Rabies is unbelievably dangerous and we were lucky that for so long it wasn’t able to spread like this.

See, rabies is incredibly infections if it gets to where it needs to be but normally that only happens through direct contact with bodily fluids since it can’t survive outside of a host for very long at all. This strain, however, was able to survive for up to 25 seconds in even the smallest respiratory droplets under observation. I mean drops so small that you don’t even need to cough; just being present in the air someone else is breathing is enough. From there it managed to find an easy new infection route through the eye. Using the retina to feed at first, it has a primary incubation phase in the aqueous humor inside the eye. Eventually it makes its way into the tear duct and then invades the sinuses from there with easy access to the olfactory nerve. Once this happens, the patient begins a secondary incubation period during which they’re not only incredibly contagious but also almost entirely symptom free. You can probably see how big that makes the problem.

We know the primary incubation period takes around six months by tracking the timing of the second wave of incidences on 2 continents happening right now. Thankfully there generally wasn’t much travel in the remote village it originated in so this second wave has remained small enough for our coverups to continue to work for now but it’s getting to be a lot to manage.

The problem is that secondary incubation period where you’re a walking disease vector. We managed to trace the infection back to that initial family whose grandmother had passed suddenly six months prior. That grandmother moved in with the family after falling ill shortly after her pet cat ran away. The cat was never recovered so we couldn’t take any samples of the remains but the grandmother was able to be exhumed and she definitely had the infection. She was diabetic so no one was surprised when her vision declined quickly just before she passed.

Knowing the timeline means we can estimate the secondary incubation period was nearly 15 months for her. Several neighbors indicated having issues with the family during this time as well stemming from increasingly erratic and paranoid behavior in the months leading up to the outbreak. That was just one case though so we’re trying to get a better idea of timing early symptoms. Estimating the timing of infection for each case is painstakingly manual so the data has been hard to come by. The problem remains, though, that you’re quietly infecting everyone around you for a very long time.

By the time we even knew what we were dealing with and could start testing, we were already seeing an infection rate in the 30-40% range among the general public. We’ve been continuing random testing every day but now the last time we found someone with a negative test was 15 days ago. That means exactly what you think it does. There’s no avoiding the problem. You’re already infected and survival requires we hit the problem head on.

This second wave might still be small but the kind of people who travel to a remote place like we’re talking about tend to get around. In a few months the next wave will likely be huge if nothing’s done. I’m talking 8-12 million people across the globe suddenly losing their sight and quickly dying off in the span of around 2 weeks and then escalating to total annihilation of the human race within another 24-30 months after that.

But here’s the thing, I wasn’t really scared. The benefit of having such a long incubation is that we had time. Not only that, we were incredibly fortunate that the rabies vaccine we have was still effective with only minor tweaks. The main problem was manufacturing enough and even then we knew getting people to take it would be a nightmare after last time vaccines were a big deal. Thankfully an incredibly intelligent woman (who I really wish I could give credit to by name) had the genius idea to model dispersal after how the virus has been propagating, in other words, airborne. We really only needed another maybe 2 weeks of lead time before we could take the first steps.

The whole thing was a solved problem. A big problem, but a solved one. We hold a press conference to finally disclose the situation to the public once the solution was already prepared. Allow the people smart enough to listen to take a vaccine the normal way and then those people would actually immediately start shedding an inert version of the virus that gets absorbed in the lungs of others which causes them to shed as well. I know that sounds like a nightmare on its own and I thought so too at first but, from what I later found out, let’s just say it wouldn’t be your first rodeo and there’s never been one instance of an issue. The science is there but it’s classified for another 13 years. It’ll blow your mind if you’re still alive.

Anyway, I said it *was* a solved problem. You probably think you know where I’m going but it’s even worse than that. This is such a dramatically huge but ultimately fixable problem that it’s a tremendous political win for whoever is in charge. We were convinced that no matter who won, they’d relish the opportunity to save the whole world from absolutely certain doom.

But then in an instant, all my contacts at the pentagon went silent. I had a committee of leaders in each branch of the military that I communicated with to coordinate my daily job under normal circumstances. In the current situation, those military contacts had been a critical part of our response with the CDC but we were using the military for keeping people alive instead of making them dead so all my contacts were seen as waste in one fell swoop. So far my department has been pretty hidden since we’re not technically part of the military or the CDC but access to the data we were using was restricted and funds have been painful to get.

Literally anyone could just read one of the classified briefings we’ve sent every day and take it seriously and things could get moving again but we literally can’t get anyone to answer. We’re so close to the most unnecessary extinction I could dream up and no one is listening. I even switched to calling every single congressperson but you never even get past the interns they don’t even pay to answer the phones. Once things get going with this next wave, it’s going to tear through the globe faster than your worst nightmares could prepare you for but right now all I can do is watch the disaster unfold in slow motion.

I thought I’d have the nerve to make the other choice once I started testing positive for the secondary incubation phase. I thought I could end it. Today that day finally came and I couldn’t find the nerve to pull the trigger. Part of me wonders if it’s my own fear of death or if the virus makes you afraid to keep you breathing longer.

I keep emailing every day. I call but the lines are always busy or disconnected. I guess the only option I have left now is to just show up at the front doors of a few key billionaires and just… cough…
