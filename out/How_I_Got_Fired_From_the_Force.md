The Post Office. 



487 Delbert Cresc., N. Side.



*That’s* where this all started.



Nobody ever came forward who saw the fire get going. When I got there, you could hardly see the walls through the flames. Flames, not red, not orange, not yellow, not even blue- *white*, pure white, whiter-than-*snow* white. Ember swirled around us on the breeze like crystalline snowflakes; it looked more like a blizzard than an inferno.



The Firefighters came next, speeding along in their trucks, sirens blaring. They piled out of their vehicles one after another like clowns from a clown car, hooked up the hose, and started spraying. Now, I know full well those firehoses are a *force* to be reckoned with. They say the water has so much pressure it could rip off your skin and break your bones, and I don’t doubt it for a second. But I saw, with my own eyes, that torrent of *ultra-pressurised* water boil away into clouds of scalding steam before even *touching* a lick of those flames. Not even a single *droplet* had time to hit the pavement. Poof. Up in smoke. They kept spraying. They *assured* us that fire would go out *aaaany* moment. They said, “Trust us, buddy. That fire there? It’s giving up *heat* to evaporate that water. It’ll run out of gas *aaany* second now.”



Nope. By the time the truck ran bone dry, the blaze looked *worse* than it had before. We just stood there. Us officers stood there. Those firefighters stood there. We exchanged glances. No one said it, but we all thought it: “Well… Shit.”



Luckily, then, like flipping a lightswitch off, just like that, *click*, out went the flames. After a moment of gawking, one fireman nudged me on the elbow and had the gall to say, “Told you so.” I wanted to scowl, but I was too relieved. 



We searched that rubble from top to bottom. We looked under every scorched ceiling tile, every charred bit of scaffolding, every melted wad of what had once been a desk, or a cabinet, or a chair. We knew there weren’t going to be any survivors, but we were wholly unprepared for the lack of *bodies*.



“Trust me,” Those firefighters said, with the same cocky assurance as before, “We’ve gotta find some bones, that’s just how it works.”



Four hours later, those same firemen were frantically flipping over every stone they could wrap their gloved fingers around. No bodies. No bones. Worst of all, what *really* got them worked up: not even any ash. At least, no ash that could’ve once been a human. Like everyone just *vanished* in that pearly inferno.



Now, I regret to say this, but for a couple of months there, that was that. Strange as this may have been, you’ve gotta keep on keeping on. New cases come along. New bodies wash up along the river. New fires get going. The world keeps turning, and us public servants are expected to keep pace with it. But what they *don’t* tell you is that sometimes, when the world goes on turning, it turns all the way back around again, and you find yourself back where you were. 



Me? I found myself at church.



The town had a lot of churches. Everyone you met was either Roman Catholic or Protestant- I *was* protestant myself. Trust me, they didn’t always get along, but folks minded their own most of the time. 



As you might expect, I found myself, a protestant, at a Catholic church that fall evening on the clock. We’d received a call about a homeless encampment who’d settled in on their courtyard, and were politely asked to “Get rid of them”. So much for “love thy neighbour”.



When we arrived, we suited up in our bunny suits- you never know what kind of junk they’ve got lying around in these places- and got to clearing. Save for a few stragglers, the forest of raggedy tents was practically a ghost town. 



I saw one guy in the corner, leaned up against a wall in the shade of the church, rolling a greasy crackpipe around in his fingers, looking it over like he was the Thinker or something. I flashed him my badge. He flashed me the finger. Real class act.



For the next couple of hours it was all grunt work. Clear out a tent, toss the junk in the trash, take it down, dumpster it. One, by one, by one. ‘Till I came across a torn up green pop-up in the centre of the nylon jungle. 



The flap was open and swaying in the breeze. Yet another dirty crack pipe rolled around on the floor of the tent. I tossed it in the trash bag. But as I reluctantly crawled inside, I found myself elbowing a cardboard box in the entryway, spilling a heap of cassettes on the floor with a clattering crash.



De La Soul, Master of Puppets… This guy even had Thriller. I couldn’t bring myself to trash it, so I ripped out a fresh bag, and used the side of my arm to sweep the cassettes in, before heaping the bag into the back of my patrol car. Couldn’t let The Queen is Dead go to waste.



On my way home that evening, I decided to give them a roll. Pulling into the parking lot of a printing shop for a moment, I tore open the bag in my passenger seat, and pulled out the first cassette I saw: Tina Turner. Lucky me.



Before I even tied that bag back up, though, I couldn’t help but notice another tape, just barely peeking out from a strand of torn plastic. Curiously, I slid it out, and gave it a glance over. It was the oddest thing. No name, no writing, no nothing. On the outside, this thing was practically blank, save for what looked almost like a waxy thumbprint stamped on its outer edge. I didn’t wanna touch it, who *knows* what that might’ve been, but I couldn’t help myself from popping the thing in the tape deck, or *trying* at least, ‘cause I quickly realized this thing was too big to fit in my stereo. 



Giving the thing one more look over, this time with the lights on, I felt like a moron. This thing wasn’t an audio cassette- this thing was a *beta*, a *video* tape. I was curious before, but now I was *really* interested. I popped in the Tina Turner tape, and drove home with every intention to slide that beta in my VCR when I got back.



As if on cue with the ending of “Better Be Good to Me”, I pulled back into my driveway, turned off the car, and carried that bag of tapes inside. I plopped the bag down, grabbed a Busch, and somewhat-excitedly slid the beta into my VCR. This would be one of those moments where, when it’s done, you just *know* your life before, and your life after, will be two *completely* different things that have no chance of becoming one ever again. 



As the tape flickered on, I was greeted by a rather *obscene* sight. A flaccid, shrivelled, blistered penis. Needless to say, I was hooked. The camera panned back, revealing a dense tangle of curly black pubic hair, before pulling back so far as to reveal a disheveled looking man, completely in the nude, standing on a sidewalk. His hair was long and ratty, his beard was scruffy and unkempt, his skin was dirty and covered in sores and burn marks. His teeth were yellowed and rotten. His nails were brown.



He glanced past the camera, as if silently confirming with the person behind the camera that they were rolling. Then, slowly, like he’d rehearsed it- though maybe not enough- he raised his right arm to the sky, three fingers to the air, the other two down. His other arm hung loosely at his hip, and he just stood there, genitals exposed, body to the wind, standing on that sidewalk, same pose, second after second. Then… *Wham!*



The camera pans over. The Post Office. The burning post office. Engulfed in white fire.



My heart sank in my chest, lower than I thought there room to sink. 



Through the crackling audio, I heard a gleeful giggle. The camera operator seems to shake with excitement, fish around in- presumably- *his* pockets, fishes out a bag of glinting crystals- *meth*, if I had to guess- palms it to the nude man, and then makes a dash towards the building.



I swear to you, I am not making this up. The man *jogs into the white hot inferno* like a college student sauntering casually into a class they were three minutes late for. He walks through the building, slowly, deliberately, filming furniture begin to melt and dissolve from the heat, smoke filling the rooms, until he comes across a uniformed woman. He just stands there, filming, as she chokes on the smoke, as the white flames engulf her body, she screams, and burns away to nothing.



Then, the tape cuts.



For what felt like hours, I sat there, beer going flat in my hand, static hissing across the television. Fuck. Did I call the cops? I *was* a cop, and even *I* didn’t know what to do. I ran to the VCR and ejected the tape, but as I plucked the thing from the slot, I couldn’t help but scream.



The tape was *absurdly* hot, like an iron rod left in a furnace till it was *glowing*. I heard the sizzle of my own flesh being burned away, and, I don’t mean this in a derogatory way, I *swear* I could smell my burning skin and fat- it smelled like bacon. I dropped the tape to the ground, a purplish, glossy, rectangular scar forming on my palm, as the thing soon oozed away into a useless pile of molten plastic. Junk.



Don’t believe me? Fine. You wouldn’t be the only one. *None* of my coworkers did, and honestly? I probably wouldn’t have believed me either if I was in their shoes. But that doesn’t change the fact that it *happened*.



I fell down the rabbit hole. I was obsessed. I needed to know. I needed to know *why*, *how*, and, perhaps most importantly, *who*? And when all *logical* paths led me to dead ends, I found myself going down the most obvious route of the *illogical*: Satanism. Yes, Satanism. The very notion *every* God-fearing cop turns to when faced with circumstances beyond his understanding.



I won’t divulge my sources, but I will tell you some people were able to guide me to a man they called “Forsythe the Warlock”. Seems Satanism had been *all the rage* amongst the teens recently, rebellious little dicks raging against their Christian parents, and many of them had become disciples of Forsythe. 



When I first met Forsythe the Warlock, it had been at his midtown apartment. He had painted all of his walls crimson red, candles burned in practically every room, books lined his shelves with names I couldn’t even *begin* to pronounce, and the Warlock himself greeted me in black robes, lined with shimmering red. So *this* was a Satanist.



Now, I must tell you, I was… *pleasantly* surprised. Far as I could tell, Forsythe was an *exceptionally* courteous and personable man. He offered me tea- which I understandably refused- and invited me to sit across from him in his study, so I could explain why I had insisted on meeting him.



As I explained my circumstances, he was the first man to hear my story from start to finish without giving me a single scowl of disapproval or raising an eyebrow of skepticism. 



“Well? Any thoughts?”Forsythe thought about it for a moment. “Tell me,” He said, “Can you show me *precisely* the pose?”



I froze. Of course, I *could* demonstrate that pose from the video, *anyone* with functioning arms could, but… I realized at that moment, I didn’t *want* to. The notion of using my own body to strike that odd, devilish pose aroused in me such a feeling of strange anxiety… I felt like I was being asked to stick my face inches from the jaws of an unknown snake. Who knows if its venom might be fatal?



The Warlock seemed to pick up on my apprehension, and laughed a hearty laugh. “Don’t worry,” He said, “Nothing’s going to happen. It’s not real.”



I was taken aback. What did he mean it wasn’t *real*? I felt another odd sensation, this time as though I had attended a Sunday sermon and the priest had openly said to the congregation “Keep in mind, now, that God isn’t real”. This was… unexpected.



“See,” Forsythe leaned in, clasping his hands together as he rested his elbows on his knees, “People have it all wrong. We Satanists? We don’t *worship* Satan. We don’t even *believe* in Satan. For that matter, we don’t believe in God either. You might call us atheists.”



I couldn’t help but chuckle in disbelief. I had to confirm: Satanists don’t *even believe* in Satan?Turns out: No. Satanists- the “normal” kind- *don’t* believe in Satan. According to the Warlock, they merely *admire* Satan for his individualistic and self-serving qualities, as an *example* of a proper way to live.



“Make sense?” Forsythe smiled, leaning back in his chair, satisfied, “We Satanists are not to be confused with those… devil-worshippers.” The Warlock shrugged his shoulders, “Honestly, they’re not the brightest, the lot of them. They can have fun in Hell, for all I care. Trust me, *nothing will happen*. Please, if I am to be of *any* help to you: show me.”



I paused, sighed, and relented. Slowly, and with an admittable tremble to my hands, I raised my right arm to the ceiling, putting down my thumb and my pinky, and holding up my three fingers in the air, letting my left arm hang loosely by my side. 



The Warlock put a hand to his chin, looking me over. I felt my heart beginning to race faster and faster with each moment I held this form. “Well?” I asked, beginning to feel my arm tire, “Keep in mind, the man was naked too.”



Forsythe waved his hand. I sighed, putting my arms down. I felt a cold chill through my spine, an unusual fear, and a twinge of relief, like I’d just narrowly escaped being crushed by a falling tree, and even if my mind didn’t *know* it, my *soul* did. 



“Now,” Forsythe began, “I know it’s *not* the answer you want to hear, but I’m unaware of precisely the meaning of that pose. The *closest* I can figure would be…” He trailed off, rising from his chair as he turned to his voluminous bookshelves. After a few seconds of searching, he pulled a book from the row, and held it up for me to see. I can’t precisely remember what it was called, but I do remember that the thing was written in French.



Rifling through the text, he tapped his finger on a weathered page. “This.”



Forsythe held up the page for me to see, and I felt my blood turn cold. On the page was a drawing of a monstrous figure, body of a man, head of a goat, one hand to the sky, one hand pointing to the earth. 



“Baphomet.” He began, running his finger along the contours of the beast’s body, “One hand points up- as above- the other points down- so below. But you see… it’s not quite the same…” He tapped his finger on the hands of the fiend, “See? Two fingers. You raised *three*. Could you be misremembering?”No way. I assured him I could never forget it.



“Well… Still…” The Warlock shut the book, “That’s about the closest I can figure. Not to mention that you’d be hard-pressed to even find a *devil-worshipper* worshipping Baphomet. We’re pretty certain he was merely the product of a crusadic miscommunication surrounding the name of the Islamic prophet. Devil-worshippers may be *dumb*, but they’re not *stupid*.”



I guess that was it. I thanked the Warlock for his time, and left the complex, no closer to unravelling this mess than I had been before. But, I’ve gotta say… as I stepped out of the air-conditioned complex into the warm, autumn afternoon, I still felt that cold chill in my spine, that looming fear in my soul, and that uncertainty in my heart. I was teetering on the brink.



That’s when I saw him.



In the alleyway, beside the complex, beside a dumpster. Scraggly hair, ratty beard, same yellow, rotten teeth… 



I slapped his pipe out of his hands. I demanded answers, but his mind was fried. Amphetamines and cocaine flowed through his bloodstream, he was not listening to me, he was not even on my planet.   
  


I screamed at him. I shouted. I shook him. I slapped him. I was out of control. My hand seemed to impact his face before my mind gave the command to throw the punch. He was in a heap by the time I finally felt myself coming back to my senses. A bloody heap.



So, I ran. But it was done.



Next day, I was called into the Sergeant's office, and given the news. Someone had dropped off a beta cassette anonymously at the station, and on it, filmed from right across the street, was the whole ordeal from the day prior. I watched the screen as blow after blow landed. I watched as I kneed the homeless man in the ribs. I didn’t even remember doing that. I watched as he spit out blood on my shirt. I hadn’t even noticed.



My gun, and my badge. And that was that.



No longer a cop, no closer to answers, now I’m a mall security guard a couple of towns over. Why am I posting this now? Well, from what I’ve heard, at least from word of mouth: There’s been another fire.
