I moved to Kyoto last year for work teaching English at a private cram school. I love Japan, but I’ve always been a bit of an introvert, so I usually avoid crowded bars or touristy night spots. But last Friday, one of my co-workers convinced me to join him for drinks in Gion. One beer became two, and before I knew it, the streets were empty and I was sprinting to catch the last train home. I made it just in time. The carriage was mostly empty, except for an elderly man in a suit slumped near the door, and a teenage girl in a school uniform staring out the window. I chose a seat near the middle of the car and pulled out my phone, trying to ignore the low hum of the fluorescent lights. 

About ten minutes in, I noticed the girl. She hadn’t moved at all, hadn’t shifted her weight, hadn’t blinked. Her head was cocked slightly, as if listening. 

Then I heard it too. A faint scratching sound. It wasn’t coming from inside the train. It was coming from outside, just beyond the window, like long nails dragging across metal. I told myself it was probably a tree branch or debris. But as the train sped through the countryside, I caught a flicker of movement in the glass.

Something was keeping pace with us. 

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light some weird reflection. But no. There was something, someone? running alongside the train. Its form was distorted, too tall and too thin, with limbs that seemed to bend the wrong way. It moved in a jolting, erratic way, almost like it was hopping on all fours. The girl still didn’t react. Neither did the old man. I pressed my face closer to the window. That’s when it turned its head. 

I swear to god, it had no face. Just smooth, pale skin stretched where eyes, a nose, and a mouth should’ve been. Then it raised its claw and tapped on the glass.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

My breath fogged the window. I wanted to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. I looked to the girl for help, but she finally turned her head toward me. Her face. She didn’t have one either.

Just smooth, featureless skin. I jumped up, ready to bolt into the next car, when the old man spoke for the first time.

"Sit down." His voice was calm. Almost kind. "Don’t let it know you see it."

I froze. The scratching grew louder, metal screeching under claws, then suddenly it stopped. The carriage was silent again, except for my ragged breathing.

The train slowed as we approached my station. The doors slid open with a hiss. I didn’t wait. I ran sprinted off the platform and into the street, heart pounding so hard it hurt.

When I finally looked back, the train was still there, doors open. The girl was standing in the doorway now, staring straight at me with that smooth, blank face. The doors closed. The train pulled away. I haven’t taken the train since. I’ve been riding my bike to work, even in the rain. But last night, I woke up at 3 a.m. to the sound of fingernails scratching against my apartment window. I live on the 5th floor.
