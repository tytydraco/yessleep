# I think my podcast may have reversed reality.

I host a small podcast called *The Nerdiest Absurdist*. It’s niche — weird science, obscure philosophy, metaphysical thought experiments. Late‑night spirals for people who don’t sleep well.

I never expected it to go viral.

But one episode did.

**Episode 74: “The Court of Cosmic Inquiry — Docket 1: Universe vs Entangled Photon.”**

It was based on a surreal script I found buried on an old theoretical physics forum. A courtroom drama — cosmic, satirical, clever. A photon is on trial for violating relativity, accused of sending spin information faster than light. Schrödinger’s Cat presides as judge. The jury — the listener — must decide: guilty by free will, or innocent by determinism.

The original story was strange, but harmless.  
No hidden codes. No binary. No warnings.

That part matters.

I went all out on production.

I gave each witness a voice. Added reverb, ticking clocks, distant murmurs. To make the courtroom feel alive, I layered in a background chant — a cult of mathematicians muttering numbers under their breath.

That part was entirely my idea.

I didn’t copy it from the story.  
I didn’t encode anything intentionally.

I just generated a quick string of zeros and ones using a random number tool, converted it to speech, and dropped it low in the mix as a sound‑design gimmick. Nerd flavor. Texture.

It meant nothing.

At least, I thought it did.

The first glitch was small.

I dropped a mug and heard it *shatter* before it hit the floor.  
My cat jumped from the counter and froze midair for half a second, like a buffering video.  
I sneezed — then felt the pepper in my nose afterward.

I blamed stress.

Then the emails started.

# Email#1- "WTF"

Big fan of the pod. But something’s off. I queued up your new episode during my morning run.

 started playing before I hit play.

I thought it was a bug, but I already knew the verdict before you said it. Not remembered — knew.

That’s not normal, right?



# Email #2 - “Different every time”

I’ve listened to Episode 74 three times.

The judge says something different at the end each time.

Same file. Same timestamp.

Also… my reflection moved before I did. Just once. But it happened.

>

Then came the email that made my stomach drop.

# Email #3 - No sender / Timestamp: Jan 1, 1983

>

I recognized the binary instantly.

It was the EXACT sequence I had generated for the background chant.

I decoded it for the first time.

It reads:  
**CHOOSE FREE WILL**

I hadn’t known that when I added it.  
I swear I hadn’t.

I panicked and tried to delete the episode.

It came back.

I wiped my drive — it reappeared.  
I unlisted it — people still found it.  
I removed it from my feed — listeners said it auto‑downloaded anyway.

# Email #4 — “What language is this?”

>

One guy said it played through his car radio on a dead FM frequency.  
Another said it played from his smartwatch at 3:13 a.m. — no headphones connected.

A listener mailed me a burned CD.

The disc was blank.

But when I held it to my ear, I heard my own voice whisper:

“The verdict has already been entered."

Then I received a ZIP file from an untraceable address. It looked like a legit government document. Redactions and all.



No message. Just a filename:

**ARPANET\_BOOTSTRAP\_LOG\_0001**



Inside was a plain text document dated **January 1, 1983** — the day ARPANET switched to TCP/IP. The birth of the modern internet. 

It also contained a partially redacted name. The unreacted part was my name. Granted Elijah isn't terribly uncommon, it also contains on repeating binary sequence. 

The same one I used.

Decoded, it reads:

**CHOOSE FREE WILL**  
**CHOOSE FREE WILL**  
**CHOOSE FREE WILL**

Over and over.

# That’s when I realized something horrifying.

I hadn’t *created* the message.

I had **REINTRODUCED** it.

Like it was just waiting for a voice.  
Waiting for a carrier.  
Waiting for someone careless enough to say, *“It’s just random noise.”*

The original courtroom story wasn’t the danger.

*My interpretation was.*

At the end of the episode, I overruled the jury. I told my audience that determinism was true. That choice was an illusion. That the final condition was a pure product of the initial state. That the verdict was inevitable.

I spoke over the message.

And now reality feels… locked.

People report effects before causes.  
Conversations repeating themselves.  
Dreams that feel like memories of things that haven’t happened yet.

The binary shows up everywhere now.

On receipts.  
In condensation.  
In fogged mirrors.  
In places no one remembers writing.

The episode still changes.

Sometimes the ending isn’t my voice.  
Sometimes the judge laughs.  
Sometimes there’s no verdict — just silence and a gavel I never recorded.

People still find it.

On hard drives they never owned.  
On devices that don’t connect to the internet.  
One listener says they dreamed it **before it existed**.

PLEASE, If you ever see an episode titled  
**“The Court of Cosmic Inquiry — Docket 1: Universe vs Entangled Photon”**  
from a podcast called *The Nerdiest Absurdist*—

**Do not listen.**

Do not decode the binary.  
Do not finish the episode.  
Do not choose a side.

Because the moment you hear it—

**The verdict is no longer yours.**

And the madness that follows.

It was always going to find you.
