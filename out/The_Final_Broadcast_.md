The old radio tower on Maple Hill had been silent for decades. Once a bustling local station in the 1940s, it had long since fallen into disrepair. Locals said the place was haunted, but I never believed in such nonsense. Until last month.

My name is Sarah, and I’m a journalism student at the nearby college. For a class project, I decided to investigate the radio tower. The plan was to debunk the ghost stories and write a feature on urban legends. Armed with my camera, notebook, and recorder, I set off one foggy afternoon.

The climb up Maple Hill was steep and overgrown, and by the time I reached the top, I was exhausted. The tower stood before me, a rusting skeleton against the gray sky. I took a deep breath and pushed open the creaking door to the station.

Inside, the air was thick with dust. Old equipment lay scattered around, and the silence was oppressive. I began to explore, snapping pictures and taking notes. As I approached the main broadcasting room, I felt a chill run down my spine. The door was ajar, and inside, the old transmitter stood like a monolith.

Out of curiosity, I switched on my recorder and began to speak. "This is Sarah Thompson, reporting from the abandoned Maple Hill radio tower. Local legends say this place is haunted, but today, we’ll uncover the truth."

As I spoke, a soft hum filled the room. I glanced at the transmitter; it had come to life, glowing faintly. Static crackled through the ancient speakers. My heart pounded. This equipment should be dead.

Then I heard it: a voice, barely audible through the static. "Help... me..."

I froze, my mind racing. Was someone trapped here? I strained to listen, but the voice was gone. The static intensified, and then the transmitter began to broadcast. It was a chilling, distorted song, like something from a nightmare.

My hands trembled as I approached the microphone. "Who are you? What do you want?"

The static ceased abruptly, and the voice returned, clearer this time. "I am the last DJ... Trapped... Need help..."

I tried to rationalize it, but fear gnawed at my resolve. I turned to leave, but the door slammed shut, trapping me inside. Panic set in. I banged on the door, but it wouldn’t budge.

The voice spoke again, desperate and pleading. "You must broadcast... Finish my show... Set me free..."

With no other option, I sat down at the dusty console. My hands shook as I adjusted the knobs and switches. The transmitter glowed brighter, and the air felt electric. I took a deep breath and began to speak.

"This is Sarah Thompson, broadcasting live from Maple Hill. Tonight, I bring you the story of the haunted tower and its final broadcast..."

As I spoke, the voice guided me, feeding me words and stories of long-dead DJs and forgotten listeners. Hours passed, but I couldn’t stop. The voice compelled me, weaving a tale of despair and longing.

Finally, as dawn broke, the voice whispered, "Thank you... I am free..."

The transmitter dimmed, and the door swung open. I stumbled out, gasping for fresh air. My mind reeled from the experience. I had to get back and tell someone, anyone, what had happened.

When I returned to town, I rushed to my professor's office. I played the recording, expecting to hear the chilling voice. But there was nothing. Just my own terrified words echoing through the static.

No one believed me. They said it was stress, a hallucination. But I know what I heard. And sometimes, late at night, when I’m alone, I tune my radio to an empty frequency, and I hear it: the final broadcast of the lost DJ, forever echoing through the airwaves, searching for someone to set him free.
