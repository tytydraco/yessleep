This guy named Casper just came through my dealer’s room, talking about how he’d just come out of a coma. He’s here to shoot crystal meth into my dealer’s neck. Earlier, my dad texted me asking if I wanted to come up for Christmas. That message stirred something in me. I teared up—then shoved it back down.

I’m lying here on this motel bed in my dusty hobo ensemble and ask if I can take a shower.  
“Towels are dirty,” he groans, as methamphetamine dances through his bloodstream.  
I decide to use the dirty towel anyway. I don’t want to be around him while he watches porn.

I peel off three layers of musty clothes—stained with cum, blood, and lube—that haven’t been washed in two months. Dirt and leaves fall off and settle on the bathroom floor. It smells like stale urine mixed with WD-40. I avoid the mirror. It’s been so long since I’ve seen myself.

But I look.  
Frail. Gaunt.  
Facial hair patchy from trichotillomania.  
Gray hairs creeping into my lion’s mane of a bush.  
My eyes meet their reflection—sunken and lost.  
I fight back tears again and decide to dabble with some GHB and jerk off in the shower, why not !!

The water runs brown with dirt for five minutes. I prop my phone up to keep it dry, throw on a  zesty video, and let the GHB take me. Arousal hits. Suddenly, being homeless feels fine. If I can feel like this, I’m totally okay with it and you should be okay with it too. 

I exit the shower singing and whistling, catching my reflection again.  
I look like a million bucks.  
I’d fuck me. You probably wouldn't still. 

The contrast from thirty minutes ago still blows my mind. I look like a Calvin Klein model with meth abs. Cheekbones are sharp enough to cut lines of meth. Ow. Life is great.

A hedonistic vagabond, just trying to squeeze every drop of pleasure from this fucked-up life before my eventual return to my home planet. Yeehaw.

If only my brain produced enough dopamine to keep me feeling like a world traveler.

I start putting on my crusty clothes, layer by layer.  
It’s December 21st. One o’clock in the morning. Forty-nine degrees.

I exit the bathroom.  
Casper and my dealer are jerking off, staring at the TV.  
He motions toward the baggie by the screen with a tilt of his head.

My fool’s gold—meth—shines and glistens.  
I walk over and grab it, the sounds of fapping growing more distant as I step out into the cold, dark San Diegan twilight.

I walk two miles back to my tent by the river in the coastal forest.  
My breath freezes as I sing “Harvest Moon” by Neil Young.  
Past the circle of hotels, full of meth and gay prostitution.  
You hit the river leaf, and it’s three abandoned baseball fields—where I lived for a month.

Follow the trail that winds down.  
You’ll hear the river roar—so loud after a storm.  
A dozen homeless were killed in flash floods the year before.  
This year, I’m not so lucky. It’s a La Niña year.

Continue along the river until it settles.  
Below the trolley tracks, there are stones to hop, skip, and jump across.  
Beware—the water is hungry at this hour.

Your feet will hit sand like a beach,  
and suddenly, you’ll feel like you’re in a tropical dystopia.

Follow the trolley past the bright green fauna.  
To your left, you’ll see a nice spot by the river to pitch a tent.  
That’s where I lived in my first camp.

Follow the trail of used needles,  
and you’ll find the YMCA.
Your almost there friend. 
Walk through the parking lot
Into a grass field with soccer nets
Follow that all the way up till you reach a rusted gate
Untie the rope and push, follow the dirt trail and 
Don't be afraid of the spider webs they are just obstacles. You will see a low hanging branch from a big ominous looking tree.  Gather your courage and get under that branch. You have  arrived, friend. Now do as you please. Just don't stare in their eyes for too long .
