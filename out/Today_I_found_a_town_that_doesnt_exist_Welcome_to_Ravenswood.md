I can still remember when my life went to hell, the day my mother was murdered, the day that changed my life forever.

We were at home watching a stupid movie but I didn’t care. Anytime I could sit with my mom and watch TV I was grateful for the experience. My mom worked long hours Monday-Saturday so, Sunday was the only day we could sit down and see each other. My dad died when I was four so I don’t remember him much.

As the movie was nearing the final act someone knocked on our front door. The first time the person knocked my mom ignored it, she told me people could call first if they were coming over. We tried to go back to watching the movie afterward.

But the person knocked again, this time with so much force that it knocked a picture off the wall closest to the front door. We got up and I slowly moved to the TV to look out the window behind it. There were no cop lights, there wasn’t even a car outside. I went for my phone right away and dialed 911, but my mom told me not to call them yet.

“It’s possible that this person is just drunk, sweetheart. Don’t bother the police for this just yet.” My mom whispered to me as she turned the volume to the TV down. I could tell by her expression that she was nervous, or maybe she was scared.

There was another knock, this time I was sure the door would burst off of its hinges. This person wanted to get into the house but my mom kept telling me to wait a second, she was so sure whoever was outside was going to leave. We waited for five minutes before I finally felt like I could sit back down.

The moment my body hit the couch the window shattered behind the TV, in a flash a man was coming through our living room window. I was frozen, it felt like all of my joints were locked shut.

“Stella! Run!” My mom screamed at me. I looked up at her for just a second before finally getting off of the couch. My legs felt like jello, my heart was threatening to leave my chest. Despite being scared I managed to hold onto my phone.

I turned my head as the man finally made it through the window, holding down three buttons on my phone. I called 911.

“Someone is breaking into our house!” I screamed into the phone as I watched the man stand fully. The woman on the other end was speaking to me but I don’t remember what she said. The man standing in our living room was wearing a black suit with a matching black hat. His face was completely smooth. Where his nose and eyes should've been there was nothing. He didn't have a mouth either, but there was an indentation where his mouth should've been.

“Stella. Run.” My mom said as she turned to look at me. She looked so calm.

I screamed out our address to the woman on the phone and ran into the kitchen to grab a weapon. I was pleading with the woman to get the cops here faster, she tried to assure me everything would be okay. She told me to hide, but if I went to hide my mom would be left alone.

I grabbed a kitchen knife from the counter and ran back into the living room, I was ready to fight for our safety. I thought if I came out with a weapon the man would turn around and leave.

As I ran back into the living room, I paused right at the doorway. The man was holding my mom by her head, his thumbs stuck into her eyes. There was blood everywhere. He turned his head to look at me, despite having no eyes I knew he was looking right at me. He tightened his hands, and I watched as my mother's head cracked and popped before being crushed completely.

I could hear ringing in my ears.

“Mom?” I spit out before watching the man rise to his feet. He shook his hands, blood flew onto the couch.

I dropped my phone and took off running into the kitchen. I could hear the man's shoes hitting the floor behind me, he was following me. I grabbed the back door and tried to rip it open, but it was locked. I could hear him entering the kitchen behind me.

I let the doorknob go and ran for the counter. He wasn’t running after me, I guess I looked like a trapped mouse to him. With all of the strength in my body, I rammed my body into the window, it cracked and I fell out, slamming my face off of the pavement.

I didn’t wait for him to come after me, I ran around the house and onto the street. I was trying to run as fast as I could. I could hear our front door open and slam behind me, he was following me.

I took the opportunity to turn my head back as I ran. The man was chasing after me, his body hunched forward and his arms pumping madly.

“Help!” I screamed.

“Please! Somebody!” I called again. No one was coming outside, no one even bothered to turn on a light. Our neighbors have never been so selfish, if anything they were too friendly. Now when I needed them, they weren't answering me.

The man was catching up to me, and that’s when I saw the bus! We have one on our street but it normally didn't run this late. I didn’t care though, I ran right to the bus stop and when the doors opened I jumped inside.

“I’m sorry, I don’t have money on me right now. But if-” I was cut off when the bus driver waved his hand and told me to take a seat. I turned around to see if the man was still following me but he wasn’t. He waited a couple of feet from the bus stop. He stood there watching me sit down. As we drove I could see the cop cars coming down the street but I was so tired, it felt like someone had given me a sleeping aid. I couldn’t keep my eyes open, I must’ve fallen asleep.

\-

“Miss?” A man said to me as he shook me awake. I gasped loudly and forced myself to sit up, I couldn’t believe I had fallen asleep on the bus. My whole body ached, and for a second I thought I was going to throw up.“Sorry,” I mumbled to the guy before turning my head to look at him.

The bus driver looked down at me with a small smile, “It’s not trouble at all ma’am. We have reached the final destination so I’m afraid I have to ask you to leave the bus.”

I got up and walked to the doors, without asking any further questions I stepped off of the bus and that’s when it hit me, “Wait!” I turned to ask him how I was supposed to get home but the bus was gone.

I turned to the building behind me and felt a wave of relief wash over my shoulders. “The Hyacinth Motel and Spa,” I mumbled. Out of instinct, I reached into my pocket to try and find my wallet. Remembering I lost it, I sighed loudly and walked inside anyway. I was hoping they could at least give me some directions.

As I walked in I took a moment to examine the floor, the black carpet seemed to stretch out for miles. In reality, it ran the length of the floor to the stairs. For this place being labeled as a motel, the inside looked more like a hotel.

“Hello?” I called as I looked around the room before landing at the front desk.“Hi.” A woman said to me as she leaned over the counter.

I eyed the woman, she seemed nice and very approachable. I don’t know what I was expecting but this wasn't it. I watched as she ran her hand through her thick brown hair, “Honey, I think you’re lost.” The woman said to me as she watched me lean on the counter.

“I am lost. I was trying to get away from a man, and I got on a bus, and now I am here. Where are we exactly?” I asked the woman.

“You landed in Ravenswood.” The woman said with a small frown.“Where are your parents?” She asked me seriously.

“My mom was murdered. I was supposed to speak to the police.” I said as I put my hand to show my phone, but I didn’t have it. I think I dropped it when I jumped out of the window.

“Is there any way I can leave? I don’t have money but I could work for it maybe?” I asked the woman seriously. There had to be something I could do to get out of this town.

“You have to get a bus ticket, honey.” The woman said before turning to look at the keys behind her.

“You can get one from Betty over at the soda shop. If you can’t get home, come back here and I will have your room ready.” The woman said softly.“What’s your name?” I asked her.“Barbara.” She told me before turning to organize the keys.

I watched her for a second before turning and leaving. It felt weird like time was weighing on my shoulders. I wanted to rush through and get this ticket and leave as fast as possible, but something felt like it was beginning for me to stay and look around.

As I searched for whatever a soda shop was I took the time to get a glance at the buildings around me. The motel was gorgeous on the outside, it had a large glowing sign out front, I bet the colors were pretty but it was too light outside to see them.

The library was one of the biggest libraries I have ever seen, two stone birds sat on each side of the staircase. One of the birds was black and the other was white, they both had blue marble in their eyes.

I passed a couple of really pretty homes. Each one was painted white or blue, the laws looked flawless. I thought white picket fences were only a thing in the movies, at least when they looked like this. Ravenswood looked picture-perfect.

A few cars came up and down the road. I couldn’t recognize any of them but I’m not a car person. Walking down the sidewalk put me in a good mood. The sun felt nice as it hit my skin and for a moment everything was perfect until I noticed there weren't any other people walking around me.

I went from feeling relaxed to uneasy, I stopped to watch some cars go down the street, there was no one inside of them. I decided to focus on finding Betty, maybe she could tell me what was going on.

Eventually, I found the soda shop and it was the most beautiful building I have ever seen. Betty’s Soda Shop looked like it fell out of a movie. As I walked in I took the time to admire the checkered floor.“Betty?” I called out and waited for a response. It felt weird coming into this place for a bus ticket.

It only took a couple of minutes for a woman with long blonde hair to come out from behind the counter.“You must be the girl who needs to go home?” Betty asked me as she placed a soda on the counter. She slid it in my direction and I moved quickly to grab it. I didn’t hesitate to take a sip.“Yeah.” I gasped as I pulled the drink away from my face. I was so thirsty, that I thought I would finish the whole cup in one sip. Betty reached over and gave me two bus passes.“One is for when you want to come back. Now, go catch the bus.” Betty told me with a smile.

I sat there to finish my drink before thanking her. I was so grateful to her and I wanted to make that known, since I didn’t have any money I told her that if I came back I would bring her a tip. Though, I was sure I wasn’t going to want to come back for any reason.

I put the cup down and ran outside to find the nearest bus stop. It only took a couple of seconds for the next bus to arrive.“Leaving so soon?” The driver asked me as I got on and handed him one of my bus passes.“Yeah, I need to go home,” I told him honestly before taking a seat. I looked around to see if anyone else was coming but they weren't. The whole bus was empty.“What state are we in?” I asked the man as he continued driving.“What’s that?” The man called to me.

I could feel my eyes getting heavy. I pinched my nose and went to stand up but I couldn't. I put my head back and fell asleep, again.

When I woke up I was sitting on the bench of the bus stop that was down the street from my house. I don’t think I have ever been more confused in my life. My head was pounding, the events of yesterday washed over me like ice water.

My body was suddenly filled with fear, anger, and regret all at once. I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes. I got up as fast as I could and went running back to my house. I was trying to mentally prepare myself to find my mother's corpse on the floor or something. The more I thought about it, the more tears streamed down my face.

I forced the door open and tried to brace myself.

“Stella! You’re home!” My mother said as she came running out of the kitchen. She put her arms around me and pulled me into a tight hug. My blood was running cold. I wanted to throw up, I was so sure I saw her die.

“You’re alive?” I mumbled into her chest.

“Of course.” She said as she ran a hand through my hair.

“I was so worried about you.” She said before giving my back a couple of soft pats.

I pulled away from her and used my sleeve to clean my eyes.

“Why don’t you go get cleaned up and we can talk about it when you come back downstairs.” She offered. I could smell her making dinner, it smelled like garlic bread and pasta sauce.

“Okay,” I mumbled as I licked my lips and rubbed my face again. I turned and went upstairs to my bedroom.

I haven't been downstairs for dinner yet.
