When you walk into this office and the first thing you see is me smiling back at you with a big old smile I bet you wonder why I’m the receptionist at a plastic surgeon’s office. And that’s a fair question I sometimes wonder that myself. I’m Maggie and I’ve been working at Dr. Harrison’s clinic for about three years now. One thing to know about me is that I am no supermodel. I’m a little overweight (I like to use my mom’s phrase of tastefully plump!) but my whole life I’ve always been comfortable with who I am. I’ve never let anyone’s words get to me and as such when I applied to work here I fully expected to get rejected, but I needed a job and was willing to try for this spot. 



Meeting Dr. James Harrison was like coming face to face with a perfect work of art hung up in an art museum. His skin is flawless and smooth without a single mark or imperfection. While a little messy, his brown hair is soft and silky. And those beautiful eyes. He has eyes that are so bright green you could swear that they were glowing. I was so intimidated when I met him for an interview for the position and his gaze was so intense I almost felt like he would reject me on the spot. But instead, he gave me a happy smile and began to make conversation with me. And before I knew it? I was the receptionist here!



Dr. Harrison is booked full almost constantly, and the flood of people that come in once we open our doors is insane! I swear there’s a line at the door when I go to open it once we’re finally open. Plenty of women and men check-in and eagerly await their turn to be with Dr. Harrison. My job boils down to answering the phone, booking appointments, confirming appointments, dealing with payments, and the occasional coffee run! The waiting room sort of resembles a hotel lobby with how big it is, and to my knowledge besides Nurse Rachel, it’s only Dr. Harrison doing all the work. 



I don’t think Rachel likes me very much, unfortunately. When I started my first day of work the look she gave me was one I gave some food I discovered in the back of the fridge that I’d forgotten about. A mix of disgust and annoyance is the best guess I can give. Rachel also has flawless skin and hair and she looks like she lept out of the pages of a magazine. She only seems to tolerate me because I’m so close to Dr. Harrison. But when she arrives at work before him, she lets me know how much she hates me. Unlike her though, I don’t have time to hate her. Especially since the phones are usually ringing off the hook with people looking to book appointments with us. 



Speaking of phones, there’s also this old-fashioned rotary phone located in the back of my little receptionist area. Dr. Harrison has given me explicit orders that if it ever rings I am to ignore all other calls and focus completely on answering that phone. So far that phone hasn’t ever rung and it just sits there ominously on the wall. When I say old fashioned I mean old, that thing looks like it jumped right out of an old black-and-white movie. I even had to ask him how I was supposed to answer it. 



Dr. Harrison let me decorate my reception desk however I liked so I naturally brought all the knick-knacks I could to the office. I’m a simple girl with simple tastes. I decorate the desk according to the season and the upcoming holiday, from Halloween decorations like pumpkins and skeletons, to Christmas decorations like my little tree and various stockings. But normally I just like to have pictures of my dog Sonny and a few pictures of my family.  



Well I wouldn’t be here on this site if strange things didn’t happen at Dr. Harrison’s office now would I? Well, I have some stories to tell you, folks. The first major red flag about this place is just how…enthusiastic let's say, the patients are. Once when I was trying to tell someone that they didn’t have an appointment and that the next opening would be in six months she very nearly lept over the desk separating us and started strangling me right there. It took a couple of the other patients to restrain her and for the cops to take her away. But that wasn’t an isolated case, and things like that happen nearly every day here. 



Another thing about the patients is how…I don’t wanna say bad, but how worse they eventually start to become. While we have so many patients they all start to blur together, and I do sometimes keep tabs on some of them. And as they progress they become more plastic-looking almost. They start to resemble those botched plastic surgery stories you see online and I don’t understand how. When they come here at first they seem flawless just like Dr. Harrison and Rachel. But slowly they become more and more plastic. And eventually, some of them just, stop coming. When I asked Dr. Harrison about it he quickly shrugged it off, telling me he simply forwarded them to a specialist who treats conditions like that. I remain unconvinced though. 



Then there was the incident that made me want to tell someone about the strange things going on around here. I’m usually the first to arrive at the office. I have to unlock the door and turn the alarms off. Once that’s done I usually finish off any remaining paperwork from the previous day and start on the paperwork for that day. Normally right after I come in and turn on the lights and turn off the alarms, Dr. Harrison comes in right after me. 



But on this day he was running late, and that’s rare for him. He’s normally very punctual and when I saw Rachel had gotten here before him I started to get a little worried. Mostly about what the patients scheduled for today would do if we had to cancel their appointments. Already I could see the line of them starting outside our doors. When the first phone started ringing I nervously grabbed it and fully expected it to be another patient arguing with me about an appointment. 



“Thank you for calling Dr. Harrison’s office, this is Maggie, how can I help you?” I answered with the cookie-cutter opening I always made when someone called the office. To my surprise, it was Dr. Harrison calling me. 



“Maggie, something came up. Tell Rachel to prepare the first patient immediately after you guys open for me. We’re going to need to start it as soon as I arrive, understand?” he asked me, talking so fast I had to focus on what he was saying to understand any of it. 



“Of course sir, are you alright?” I asked him as I stood up from my chair and got ready to talk to Rachel. 



“I’m fine, just…make sure Rachel sets everything up properly. I’ll be there soon.” He hung up without even a goodbye which upset me a little. It was the first time since I started working there that he hadn’t said bye to me. But I chalked it up to his rushing and placed the receiver back onto the phone dock. I took a deep breath and stepped back through the reception area and towards the consultation offices where Rachel was probably getting everything ready. 



I entered the room she was prepping and met her judgmental gaze head-on. “Dr. Harrison just called me. He says to prepare the first patient immediately after I open. And that you guys are going to start as soon as he gets here.” The look she gave me quickly turned into one of urgency and a little bit of fear. 



“I told him we should’ve done that yesterday! This is just great.” She grunted tossing her pen at the floor and walking past me, bumping into my shoulder and stepping away down the hall towards the medical closet. Rubbing my shoulder and sticking my tongue out at her I walked back over to my desk and finished up my preparations to open. And at 9 o'clock on the dot I walked over and unlocked the front door for the patients, quickly jumping out of the way so I didn’t get trampled by all of them rushing in. 



Taking my place back at the desk I sat down and looked up at the first patient who had managed to get to my desk to check in first. “Name please?” I asked her as I checked my computer to see if she had an appointment, 



“Kara Smith, ” she told me. I could tell she was a regular since she acted like I should know her personally and immediately upon seeing her. Little did she know I saw at least a hundred people a day. I checked her name and scrolled around on the page before I found her. She was here for a rhinoplasty. I took another look at her and slightly raised my eyebrow. Her nose looked fine to me, but I wasn’t exactly allowed to say that to the patients. 



“Okay, you can go right ahead, Nurse Rachel will be there to meet with you. Dr. Harrison is running a little late today so I do apologize for that, but he should be here soon.” I told her with a smile. She returned my niceties by cussing me out and stomping over towards the door to the consultation rooms where Nurse Rachel was waiting for her. One of the better interactions I’ve had. 



I kept checking people in and turning away the people who didn’t have appointments. Usually, if they got too rowdy a little flash of my pepper spray was enough to at least get them to go away. After about an hour of being open and with patients starting to grumble, Dr. Harrison burst through the front doors and quickly ran past everyone including me. I normally only ever saw him in his doctor coat and scrubs so seeing him running in with a jacket and a scarf was certainly interesting. Especially since it was the middle of summer. He was so well covered up, that I almost didn’t know it was him. The only thing that told me that it was Dr. Harrison were those beautiful big green eyes. 



He quickly made his way towards the consultation rooms and slammed the door shut behind him. I had to stop a few of the patients from trying to follow after him and get them to sit back down in their seats. I took my seat and started answering calls while I occasionally looked out into the waiting room to make sure everyone was behaving themselves. Everything had settled down when a bloodcurdling screech came from one of the rooms. I quickly stood up and ran over to the room to make sure everything was okay.



“Dr. Harrison, is everything okay?” I asked as I knocked on the door. To my surprise, the door hadn’t properly locked. Dr. Harrison must’ve been in such a hurry he neglected to have the door close properly behind him. So when I knocked on it, it swung open slightly to reveal what was going on inside the room. Kara was strapped to a table as Nurse Rachel desperately tried to pin her down to the table while Dr. Harrison loomed over her with a scalpel. He twisted his head around to look at me and those shining green eyes almost burned holes into my retinas. 



“Close the door, Maggie!” He ordered me, his normally calm and joyful voice replaced with one of rage and annoyance. I quickly obeyed him and slammed the door shut, my legs trembling as I stood out in the hallway. Because what I also saw on the table was Dr. Harrison slicing a good half of Kara’s face off with that scalpel. A surgeon’s mask covered his face and his scrubs were completely drenched in blood 



I felt queasy as I walked back to my desk and took my seat. I was shaken up pretty badly, and I tried to convince myself what I’d seen wasn’t real. I’d probably just imagined it. It had only been a glance. And there was no way that Dr. Harrison would be doing something so horrible to a patient. 



After about an hour, Kara came out of the operating room wrapped up in bandages all over her face but with a bright smile and thanking Dr. Harrison a thousand times for his work. He brushed it all aside and handed her a few papers to take over to me. She walked over to me and I looked over the papers and nodded to her. 



“Everything okay?” I asked her, as I signed off on the papers I needed to sign for her and presented the ones she needed to sign. 



“Everything is fantastic! Thank you so much for asking. I just know that this nose job will be the one,” she said with a smile through the bandages that covered up her nose. I squinted at her to look at where I had sworn her skin had been sliced off, but there wasn’t anything there. Not even an acne scar. She didn’t seem to care about my staring at her, she was focused on signing her papers. 



With that, she walked away and the next few patients began to be admitted, while I had to deal with the steady flow of people who continued to enter the waiting room and beg and plead with me to get them an appointment. Around noon I was packing up and getting ready for lunch when I noticed that on the schedule I would have lunch at the same time as Dr. Harrison. Normally I’d ask him if he’d wanted something delivered to him, but I figured it was best to leave him be for the time being. 



As I stood up and got ready, I turned around and found him standing behind me. He scared the absolute hell out of me and made me drop my purse to the ground in shock. He seemed just as surprised and quickly bent over to help me get my purse back up off the floor. 



“I’m sorry about yelling at you, Maggie,” he told me as he handed my purse to me. His face was uncovered from his surgeon mask and his beautiful face was again exposed to me. I could tell in those big green eyes that he truly meant his apology. 



“Oh, that’s okay, Dr. Harrison. I understand that sometimes you just have a pretty bad day, and you can’t help but get grumpy. Can I get you anything for lunch while I’m out?” I asked him, happy that we could continue our routine just like normal. The genuine smile he gave me further enforced that we had both forgiven each other. 



“Just some coffee for now will be fine. Enjoy your lunch, Maggie.” He told me with a smile as he turned and returned to the rooms behind the reception area. I shouldered my purse and went to exit the waiting room and out into the parking lot. And as I did I was quickly shoved to the ground by an unseen force. 



“What the fuck did he do to me?!” Kara’s voice screamed at me as she grabbed me up from off of the floor and shook me violently back and forth. It took me a moment to figure out what she was even screaming about, and that was when I saw that her face was starting to peel off. It looked like she had tried to take the bandages off early and a large chunk of skin had followed after it. 



“I-I don’t know ma’am! I’m just the receptionist!” I tried to tell her but the look in her eyes told me she wasn’t going to accept that as an answer. She quickly wrapped her hands around my throat and started squeezing as hard as she could. I gagged and quickly began searching for my pepper spray, only to be horrified to see that my bag had remained on the floor when she had shoved me down to the floor. 



“Kara? Can I please ask you to let my receptionist go?” Dr. Harrison’s voice broke through our scuffle and we both turned to see that he had also just exited the clinic. Upon meeting his gaze, Kara carefully let me go and stood back from me as I quickly ran over to Dr. Harrison. 



“I’m so sorry doctor. It’s just that I ruined your hard work, and I couldn’t control myself.” She whimpered as she pointed to the chunk of her skin that was hanging off of her cheek. Dr. Harrison looked at me to make sure that I was okay. I nodded at him, and he walked over to Kara to examine her new injury. 



“Because you removed the bandages too quickly. I told you to wait at least five days.” He tsked as he grabbed the chunk of skin and ripped it right off of her cheek. She didn’t even flinch as she just stood there completely enraptured in him. “Go ahead and go back inside, Rachael will see what she can do to fix you.” He moved out of her way as she loyally walked towards the clinic. 



“Sir..?” I asked him, confused and honestly upset that this was happening again. “I don’t know if I can keep doing this.” I was starting to feel like it wasn’t safe to be here. He looked over at me with those big green puppy eyes and I immediately felt bad about wanting to quit. 



“Please don’t quit Maggie! You do so much to make the office better and I couldn’t stand to see you leave. Please, I’ll even give you a raise if you stay!” He begged, closing the distance between us and taking my hands into his own. It was the first time I’d ever held his hands without him having gloves over them. They were soft and inviting, but I still didn’t know if I could stay. Although the thought of a raise was very tempting. 



“Can we at least look into getting security? Please?” I asked him, looking into those shining green eyes. He smiled wide and quickly nodded at me. 



“Of course! I’ll look into it right away, and I’ll make sure that this never happens again. I swear to you.” He was so excited that I was thinking of staying that it melted my heart. He finally let me go and get my lunch and over some burgers, I figured that I might as well stay. If not for the money, at least to keep seeing him smile like that again. 



On my return, I dropped off his coffee as he was doing a consultation and he thanked me as I exited the room. As I walked past another room, I noticed that there was someone in there. Which was weird because I had just seen that Rachel had left for lunch as I had arrived. I poked my head into the room and quickly poked my head back out and shut the door behind me. 



I had just walked into a skinless corpse lying down on the table. Only a few sections of skin remained on it and it looked almost like a carcass you might find in a butcher shop. I walked back to my desk and immediately shook my head trying to think of anything else that I might have seen. Maybe it had been one of those anatomical skeletons? I reached over to our lost and found box to see if something in there could cheer me up. 



I picked up a stress ball and started squeezing it as hard as I could. Not to get off topic, but I’m sure that someone is stealing things from the lost and found box. Whenever I take some sort of inventory of things I notice a couple of things go missing each time. 



Anyway, my curiosity got the best of me and I stood up from my desk again and walked back to that room. I stared at the door for a moment and reached a shaky hand out to the knob and turned it to open. And I came face to face with Kara staring back at me. 



“Oh! Uh…can…can I get you anything?” I asked her, completely caught off guard by the fact that she was perfectly fine. 



“Some water would be nice!” she said in a chipper tone. I nodded and slowly closed the door and stood there in the hallway trying to make sense of what I had seen. I swore I had just seen her without a majority of her skin. Not to mention the fact that she had seemingly torn a large chunk of her skin off of her cheek when she had just come in for a rhinoplasty. 



I turned to go back toward my desk and was met with Dr. Harrison standing behind me. He caused me to yelp out in surprise and I stared at him with just a bit of anger. 



“I need to put a bell on you,” I told him, upset with how silent he was walking around the halls. He smiled at me and noticed which door we were standing by. 



“Everything alright?” He asked me. I nodded at him and walked past him to get back to my desk. 



Don’t get me wrong, I know all the weird shit happening here isn’t normal. And it does scare the crap out of me, but Dr. Harrison did give me a raise. A big one, and soon we are going to get security to help me out with the more outlandish patients. So I can probably just ignore the stranger things that happen here. Right?
