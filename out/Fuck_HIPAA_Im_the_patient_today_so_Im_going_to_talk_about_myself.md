**Interview Subject: The Narc**

**Interviewer: Christophe W.**

**Interview Date: 12/04/24**

  


When I was sixteen, I got so high that I thought I was growing scales.

I was living on Gut Street. Actually it was Gunn Street, but one afternoon this drunk driver blasted through the intersection and hit a pedestrian. It basically broke the guy in half. His legs stayed behind, but his top half got stuck under the car and his guts just kind of ribboned out across the road. 

That’s why I called it Gut Street.



I was living with my parents for the first time since grade school. I moved down to California to live with them. Not even the cool part. Like, the Turlock part. Not even Turlock itself, but—never mind.



I was so homesick. I’d dream of home — the forests, the fog, the way everything was absolutely redolent of pine — and wake up crying. 



We lived in a shitty apartment. Rats, spiders, black mold, leaky pipes, foundation issues, drug deals in the hall, the works.



The situation did have one thing going for it, though. Actually, three things. Their names were Asher, Amanda, and Jason.



They practically adopted me the day I moved in—absorbed me as if I’d always been part of them. That’s the first and only time someone did that for me.



Asher and Amanda worked off and on with my dad doing…whatever it was he did. Amanda was nineteen, and I idolized her. She was intimidatingly beautiful and just intimidating, period. Her brother Asher was eighteen and funny as hell. Looking back, he was probably the only actual friend I had.



Then there was Jason, my boyfriend. He didn’t work with my dad, but he knew Amanda really well and he lived across the hall from me. He was twenty-one, so too old to be hanging around me and definitely too old to be dating me. But I loved him.



I loved them all.



I was nothing like them, though. I knew it, which always made me feel less. Not like an outsider, but like if we ever had to cut and run, I’d be the one left in the dust.



Now, I hate anything that threatens my self-control. I spent my life suffering the consequences of people who couldn’t control themselves due to addiction. So I didn’t drink, didn’t smoke, didn’t take anything. Not even soda or candy, because some teacher convinced that sugar is addictive. I’ve eased up on the sugar, but not the rest.



Anyway, Jason, Amanda, and Asher were my polar opposites.



They smoked, they drank, they played around with harder drugs. Amanda was a dropout, Asher was about to be, and Jason was actually a small time dealer.



They all had matching tattoos that I coveted. These red, rune-looking circles on their palms. When I asked, Amanda said they were for fun. Asher said they were friendship bracelets for grownups. Jason just said they were a mistake. 



That didn’t stop me from wanting a matching mistake of my own.



They all thought my teetotaler-hood was hilarious. They made fun of me for being straight edge — that’s what they called it — and made a game of trying to trick me into taking something. Alcohol, drugs, didn’t matter. Just something. They tried to spike water, soda, coffee, tea, food. Sometimes they literally just tried to shove their fingers into my mouth. Whatever they could do, they did. I always managed to avoid it, though.



It was really fucked up, but I was too young to know better. I was just so glad to be included.



And I was definitely included. When I wasn’t at school or alone with Jason, the four of us were together. We wandered around town in the daytime and lurked in the apartment courtyard at night, kicking around and generally being assholes.



We were in the courtyard the night before school let out. The three of were trying harder than ever to get me high in order to celebrate the end of the school year. Asher had just tried — and almost succeeded — in slipping me an acid tab. I don’t even know where the hell he got it. He was even poorer than me. I was furious.



“Come on,” Asher said, “don’t be mad. I’ll make it up to you.” He looked at Amanda. “We can show her, right? Yes? *Yes*?”



“She’s going to think we’re crazy. Or she won’t see anything and then we’ll know we’re crazy.”



“We’re not crazy.” Asher held up his palm, showing the red tattoo. “If this is real, so’s the rest. Might make her a little crazy to see it, though. It did me.”



“Stop,” Jason cut in. “Right now.”



“Look at the pied piper, scolding his mice for following him in the first place,” said Asher.



“Ash, that was poetic.” I was working very hard to keep my voice calm. Excitement was bubbling up. This was it. They were talking about giving me my very own friendship bracelet. They wanted me to be one of them for real.



“The atomic bomb, the black hole, nothing at all,” Asher said. “What do you think she’ll be, Jason? You know her best, for now. Any guesses?”



“Probably a narc,” said Amanda. “The good kids are always narcs.”



“She’s not a good kid, she only pretends. I see through her.” Asher fixed me with a look I kind of hated. “You ready for your friendship bracelet?”



“I guess.”



“Don’t do it.” Jason’s voice sent a chill up my spine.



“What is ‘it’?” I asked. 



“Something nobody should do.”



“What? Is it like a trick…?”



“Yeah, but they’re not the ones playing it. *Don’t go*.”



I hesitated. 



I loved Jason. Most of the time he was the calmest, gentlest person I knew. With a couple of admittedly notable exceptions, he always did what he thought was best for me.



If he was saying to sit this out, I probably needed to listen.



But it was easy for him to say. He already had a friendship bracelet. And based on Asher’s pied piper comment, the tattoos were his idea in the first place. So why was it okay for Asher — and for Amanda — to have one, and not me?



“Why?” I asked.



Jason just shook his head and stomped off without a word.



He was always doing shit like that. It was the kind of thing my parents did. It always made me feel like I was in trouble. I hate feeling like I’m in trouble more than I hate anything, then and now. 



“Don’t worry,” Asher said. “He’s nothing.”



For some reason, this made Amanda laugh. Then she slid her arm through mine and pulled me to my feet. “Off we go, my little narc.”



Asher took my other arm and together we marched out of the courtyard and down the street.



I quickly realized we were following the very same path that poor pedestrian’s shimmering guts had painted across the asphalt. Worse, our destination was the exact culvert where the car had finally screeched to a stop, smashing what remained of the guy’s road-rashed head.



There were no signs of blood or road-rashed heads, though. Just several concentric rings of tiny purple wildflowers rippling out from the culvert.



Asher let go of my arm, dropped to his knees, and crawled inside.



Just like that, I felt embarrassed.



Worse than embarrassed. I felt that terrible, deep gut-drop that comes when you realize you’re not part of the joke, you’re just the butt of it. “Are you guys fucking with me?”



“You want your friendship bracelet or not?” Asher asked.



He vanished into the darkness. Amanda followed suit. I heard their laughter echoing down the tunnel. It was probably a trick of my teenage insecurity, but I thought their laughter sounded cruel.



So I went home.



Jason was waiting for me in the courtyard with an Arizona tea and an apology, but I waved him off. I didn’t want to deal with him. I already felt stupid. I didn’t need another lecture too.



I did take the tea, though.



I went straight to bed, but couldn’t sleep. When I don’t sleep, I think a million thoughts a minute. At that rate, some of your thoughts are necessarily stupid and dangerous.



One of the stupid, dangerous thoughts I had that night was this:



*I can go down to culvert and check for myself.* 

  


That way if Asher and Amanda were playing a trick, at least they wouldn’t see me falling for it.



I didn’t even have to sneak out. Mom was working a night shift and Dad was in his room, obsessively prepping whatever it was he did. I wasn’t scared of them anyway.



I *was* scared that Jason would somehow sense what I was doing and try to stop me, but that didn’t happen.



Outside, the street was quiet and empty. My eyes played tricks, though. I thought I saw ribbony intestines gleaming dimly under the flickering street lights. A thin, looping path marking the way to the culvert.



Without letting myself think, I got to my knees and started crawling.



The first thing that occurred to me was that it was very dark.



The second was that this was a very, very long culvert.



After crawling long enough that my hands were raw and my knees ached, I saw a pinprick of light at the other end.



It still looked impossibly far away. I thought the tunnel must have been the remnant of some prohibition era passageway. Something that led straight into a club or even a bar.



After what felt like forever, the light expanded into an exit.



But not into a bar or a club.



Right back onto Gut Street.



But everything was wrong.



Instead of dark, it was daytime. But the most beautiful daytime I’ve ever seen, more beautiful than Gut Street could ever hope to be. The full glory of autumn, all green and gold and copper. It was warm too, like a day straight out of the best dreams of your life. A cacophony of birdsong filled the air, mingling with music echoing some distance away.



Everything around me — the sidewalks, the road, the houses — looked new, clean, and somehow fresh. No dilapidation, no filth, no overflowing garbage. No garbage at all. Just a bright and shining ideal of what Gut Street might have been in another life.



Or another world.



A bird suddenly whipped overhead. I ducked — I’m afraid of birds — and whirled around. It was a bird I’ve never seen. Shimmering, pearlescent green, with this absolutely crazy beak.



I looked up into the trees.



All the birds were like that. Like tropical birds on steroids. Fairy tale birds. Some shone like gold, others like gemstones made into flesh, others like light itself with glittering black eyes.



And every last one of them sang.



“There you are!”



I jumped and saw Asher bounding down the street.



I don’t know what it was, but the sight of him triggered something primal. Not quite a fear, but an *aversion*. He was walking too fast. Each step seemed a little too light and a little too long.



But before I could think too hard, he was in front on me and then his arm was around me and then we were walking together down the shining, glimmering daydream version of our street.



“No Jason? He sure is heavy for being nothing.”



“Don’t talk about him like that.”



“Why? Afraid of what he’ll do to you?”



He sped up, pulling me along with him. But I didn’t want to speed up. I wanted, almost desperately, to look around. I actually did stop when we passed a gleaming, perfect replica of our apartment building.



Asher immediately dragged me away. “Nope. Do *not* go in there. Don’t go in any of the houses. That’s the first rule: We go only to the carnival.”



We reached the end of the street, which was dominated by a massive ticket stand that partly shielded a breathtaking midway beyond. 



Asher pulled me to the ticket window and rang the bell. “Hey!”



The ticket taker seemed to explode out of nowhere.



He was huge, built like a wrestler, with dark red hair, big bright eyes, and an unhappy mouth that turned into a smile when he saw Asher. With a twinge of unease, I saw he was twirling a large-bore needle between his fingers.



“Tickets, please, bomb boy,” he said.



“You know I got the season pass, you bastard,” Asher said mildly, holding out his palm.



The man turned that smile onto me. “Does she?”



“Not yet. Let her in.”



The ticket man looked me over, brows knitting suspiciously over those big, glittering eyes. “I’m not supposed to let dragons in. They can burn down carnivals, you know.”



“Don’t argue with me. Season passholders get free guest tickets, no limitations.”



“Says who?”



“Says me.”



“You’ve convinced me,” said the blue-eyed man, turning to me. “Give me your hand, darling.” 



I immediately decided to do no such thing, but I wasn’t given the courtesy of implementing that decision. The man reached across the counter, grabbed my hand, and stabbed it with the needle once, twice, three times.



He squeezed my palm so that blood welled, and then he lapped it up.



I couldn’t even move. You know the fight or flight response? I don’t fight *or* fly. I just freeze. I guess you know that better than anyone.



This guy sucked until it hurt, until I was ready to cry. Then he smacked his lips, licking a stray drop off the corner of his mouth. “Delicious. Dragon, definitely. Are you *sure* she’s safe?”



“Safer than you.”



“I can’t argue with that.” He waved us onward.



Asher grabbed me by my bleeding hand and dragged me through the gate.



The carnival looked amazing, just like the rest of Gut Street Behind the Culvert. But it was frightening as well, an unsettling superimposition of extreme beauty laid over the mundane familiar. I saw billowing tents in every color I could imagine and several I couldn’t, a hundred game booths with a hundred carnival barkers and hundred food stands that each smelled more delicious than the last.



Asher pulled me past every last one.



Toward the end of the midway, I saw Amanda.



Her skin glimmered with stars. Not lights — literal stars, like images from the Hubble telescope. Her eyes weren’t normal, either. Black and shot through with white, like frozen lightning.



That’s when I finally realized that I was fucking high.



It was Jason. Had to be. He’d given me the tea earlier, and like a moron I drank it. Even though I knew they were all trying to dope me up every day — even though I knew better — I took it anyway.



And you know what? Even though it pissed me off, it was like a weight fell off my shoulders, because at least I knew what the hell was going on.



“Where are you taking me?” I asked.



“You’re buying yourself a friendship bracelet.”



“I don’t have money.”



“They don’t care about money.”



He pulled me into the very last tent, a glowing monstrosity of billowing green silk. Inside smelled like evergreens. Pine trees in the rain, just like home. As far from the arid concrete heat of Gut Street — real Gut Street and fake Gut Street alike — as it is possible to be.



That, too, put me at ease.



I stood awkwardly while Asher negotiated with the tattooist, an impossibly slender lady with the darkest eyes I’ve ever seen. 



“What’s her blood type?”



“B negative, I think,” I said.



Asher waved me off. “The ticket man said dragon.”



Her eyebrows knit together. “And he let her in?”



“I wanted to bring her, and I’m very persuasive,” said Asher.



The woman inked the delicate rune-like pattern I’d coveted for so long onto my palm. She incorporated the bite mark into the design. Looking at it made my stomach turn.



When she was done, Asher said, “Time to go home. They get weird around here with people who have brand-new friendship bracelets.”



He tried to collect Amanda on our way out. We found her in a palatial tent swirling with colored smoke and more magic birds with their deafening song. Big cats lounged on a dais beside her, and doe-eyed admirers watched her from every corner.



She ignored us.



I wanted to go into the tent — not to bother her, just to see — but Asher wouldn’t let me.



“Not in there,” he said. “Ever.”



Feeling disappointed — I mean, what’s the point of being forced to go tripping if I couldn’t even enjoy myself? — we left the midway. The ticket man waved as we hurried back down the street



Birds swarmed overhead, singing and chattering. It would have been so beautiful if it wasn’t so *loud*.



As we rushed past the houses, one of the doors opened. Not just any door — the door to the nicest, prettiest house on the street, and Jason stepped out.



I stopped, but Asher pulled me along. “Remember the rule,” he said.



We reached the culvert and crawled back home.



It took a lot less time to get home, but that made sense. Whatever Jason had dosed me with was wearing off, so of course reality wasn’t so stretchy anymore. 



I didn’t sleep at all.



When Jason came down the next morning to walk me to my last day of school, I accused him of drugging me. We argued. He said he’d never do that, sometimes he pretended because it was funny, but only Asher and Amanda would actually do it, not him. Never him. He grabbed my hand.



And he froze.



“You went,” he said. “I told you not to.”



Questions bubbled up — *where is it, what is it, when did it start, why Amanda and not me* — but all I said was, “You don’t get to tell me to do anything. Especially when you won’t even tell me the truth.”



“What truth is there to tell? It’s a mass delusion. It’s probably carbon monoxide in the pipe, or oxygen deprivation, or—”



“Don’t tell me what you want it to be, just tell me what it actually is!”



When I talk that like, people answer. Even when they don’t want to. I guess you know that, too. 



Jason fought me, briefly. For a second I thought he was going to win and storm off like he always did.



But then he deflated. “I don’t know what it is. I’ve known about it for years. I wasn’t allowed into the carnival alone, so I took Amanda and Asher there when I met them last year. The ticket man bit us all. He said Asher tasted like an atomic bomb, Amanda tasted like a black hole, and I tasted like nothing at all. Just like here. As above, so below.” His tone was profoundly bitter. “Can’t even be worth shit in my own daydreams.”



I understood, then, why Jason hadn’t wanted me to go.



“What did he say you were?”



And I knew, the way I know things sometimes, that he was hoping I’d say *Nothing*.



“A dragon. He said I’d probably burn the place down.”



His face fell, hard. For a second he looked mean. Then he shrugged. “That wouldn’t be the worst thing.”



“Okay, but what is it?”



“I don’t know. I don’t even think it’s real.”



*That’s* when he spun around and stalked away.



He refused to talk about it again. So did Asher and Amanda. They played dumb when I pressed them, drawling “What are you *talking* about” and laughing.



It made me surer than ever that they were all fucking with me, and probably drugging me too just because they could.



Because I was just an outsider. A novelty. A game. Asher wouldn’t tell me because he was an asshole and Amanda wouldn’t tell me because even though I idolized her she detested me, and Jason wouldn’t tell me because he wanted to keep pretending that he just couldn’t ever bring himself to hurt my feelings.



After a couple days of this, I decided to check out the culvert myself for a second time. To see what was really, actually there without Jason drugging me or Asher influencing my perceptions.



When I came out on the other side of the culvert, everything was there, just as I remembered it. The beautiful version of Gut Street, the phantasmagoric birds, autumn in all its green and gold and red.



And the carnival, of course.



When I rang the bell, the ticket man’s unhappy mouth curled into a hungry smile. “My little dragon.”



“Why do you keep calling me that?”



“Because you can’t be killed. I tasted it.”



I didn’t even know what to say.



“Well…that isn’t true, not yet. You have to wait for your scales to come in because you’re a baby. And once they come in, you can’t let anyone pick them off. But when they come in, nothing will be able to kill you.” He leaned in. “That’s why they’re afraid of you. All of them. Except me.” His eyes widened and his mouth fell into a perfect *O*. “Look!”



He struck, faster than a snake, and touched my sternum, dragging his finger upward in a mockery of a caress that made my skin practically crawl off my body.



“I think you’ve already grown one! Don’t let nothing pull it off. Now — ticket, please, baby dragon.”



I held my hand out, palm up. He waved me through.



Behind him, the midway shimmered like an unimaginable dream.



But my skin kept crawling, and I couldn’t stop feeling his finger on my chest. So I turned and ran, back through that perfect version of Gut Street as carnival music echoed and birdsong roared.



When I got home, I pounded on Jason’s door until he answered. I pushed past him and slammed the door. “What did you give me the other night?”



“Nothing! I told you, it was just—”



“I went to that— that carnival just now, and—”



“With who?”



“No one! Just me, but that’s not—”



“You went there *alone*? How?”



“I *went*! What is so *hard* about—”



“It’s the second rule. You can’t go to the carnival alone. They won’t even let you in. That’s why I brought Amanda and Asher.”



I thought of the ticket man and wanted to cry. “Well, the ticket man let me in.”



Jason told me I was wrong, I was remembering everything wrong, I was just wrong, wrong, wrong, until he worked himself into a frenzy.



I couldn’t take it anymore so I went home.



Since I was sweaty and stressed and streaked with mud from crawling through the culvert. I decided to shower. As I stripped down, I felt something weird. Something hard and smooth on my skin. Almost like glass.



I looked down. In the center of my chest — right where the ticket man touched me — was a tiny, hard patch of copper. 



A scale.



A bright, shiny lizard scale.



Later that night, I saw Asher and Amanda through my window, lingering in the courtyard.



I hesitated, thinking of what Jason would say.



Then I went down anyway.



“Look who it is,” Amanda said. “And just in time.”



“For what?”



“For a carnival ride or three.”



I was tempted.



That was why I’d come down here in the first place, right? And the both looked so beautiful. Asher was radiant, and Amanda was so lovely she somehow made him look dim by comparison. Her skin was literally shining. No — things *in* her skin were shining. Lights. Miniature stars, or maybe tiny galaxies, glowing faintly as they shifted along her arms.



“What’s the matter?” Asher asked.



He looked wrong too. He wasn’t just radiant. He was golden. Like gloaming itself turned into skin. Like something about to explode.



“Look,” I said weakly. “Just…look at her. Look at yourself.”



He did as I said, distinctly unimpressed. “I don’t see anything. Are you coming or not?”



I didn’t go. 



I went to Jason’s. He answered the door before I even knocked and hugged me immediately, all enmity forgotten. He apologized profusely. Endlessly. Until I acknowledged it, until I told him it was okay, until I told him he hadn’t even really done anything wrong, until I was practically in tears.



Afterward, he made tea. I watched him closely. As far as I could tell, he didn’t put anything in it. I still didn’t want to drink it.



But I did anyway.



After he fell asleep, I went to the carnival by myself for the third time.



And when I crawled out into that perfect, bright autumn day, a weight I hadn’t even realized I’d been carrying fell off my shoulders. I sighed with relief. The birds seemed to echo it in their song, which made me smile.



When I approached the gate, the ticket man’s unhappy mouth flipped upside down. “The baby dragon isn’t here to burn down my carnival, is she?”



“Never.”



He struck again, too fast to see, too fast to even feel until it was done. His hands on my shoulders, not squeezing but bearing down.



“Who are you?” he asked.



“The dragon,” I said.



He leaned in, squinting. “Are you sure? You look like a Wendy to me.”



I wrenched free and marched past the gate, but not before throwing him the dirtiest look I could muster.



Asher was waiting for me on the midway, more radiant than ever. “I knew you were coming. I knew it!” He knotted his hand through mine and pulled me down the promenade.



We found Amanda. She was, and remains, the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. Outer space incarnate. Darker and brighter than the universe itself.



I could probably talk for days about the carnival, which is weird because I can’t even recall specific memories. Just a whirlwind of things that were beautiful and things that were pretending to be beautiful, all of them terrifying and all of them exhilarating.



When I got home the next morning, I noticed new scales on my shoulder. One on the left, two on the right.



That was our pattern for weeks.



Every night, I’d meet Asher and Amanda in the courtyard to sneak down to the carnival under Gut Street.



When I got back every morning, I had new scales. Hard and smooth and bright. Bright as the light in the carnival. Pure autumn glory.



Amanda and Asher both regarded my scales with awe. “You’re so lucky,” Amanda breathed. “Atomic bombs detonate. Black holes collapse. But nothing can kill a dragon.”



I was *sure* they were drugging me, and themselves too. I know that sounds paranoid, but I figured they’d finally figured out how to dose me in a way I couldn’t detect.



And you know what? I didn’t care.



I did care about the scales, though. I hid them from everyone else, myself included. Looking at them made me feel insane. Wearing long sleeves and sweatshirts in Stanislaus County in the summer is brutal, but it kept me from having to look at myself.



The hardest part was Jason. I couldn’t hide the scales from him, so I just sort of hid from him. 

But that didn’t last forever. How could it?



I finally showed him hoping against hope that he’d think they were beautiful.



Instead, he told me how much it hurt him to see them, to know I’d gone to the carnival, and how stupid I was, and all he wanted was the best for me. How maybe I thought Nothing At All wasn’t good enough for a Dragon. And I’d be right, because he wasn’t good enough for anything. He was just nothing.



By the end, I was crying.



Once we were done, I tiptoed into his bathroom and pulled my own scales off.



I stayed away from the carnival after that.



The confusing thing was, I knew that staying away was the right thing to do. But it felt like I was doing the right thing for the wrong reason.



And that just meant I was doing the wrong thing anyway. 



Asher didn’t understand why I stopped going. He thought I was scared. He offered to protect me, to punch the lights out of the ticket man, to explode at anyone who made me feel threatened.



One afternoon, in the middle of one of these wheedling sessions, he stopped dead.



“What?” I asked.



He struck so fast I couldn’t react and tugged my shirt down past my shoulder, exposing the bare mottled skin where scales had been.



“Where are they?” 



His voice was soft, even gentle. But it made me shudder.



I yanked it back up. “They fell off. Actually, they were never there because people don’t have scales.”



“Dragons do.” He frowned. “They’ll never grow if you hide them. They need the sun.”



“I don’t want them to grow.”



“Why?”



“Because they’re not real, and even if they are I wouldn’t have them if I hadn’t gone to the carnival.”



He was quiet for a while. 



Then —



“I can barely see anymore. It started the first time I went to the carnival. I’m almost blind now. But I can do and feel everything else a thousand times better. By comparison, seeing crippled me. Without your scales, you’re crippled.” 



“You’re not making any sense. And the scales aren’t even real.” I believed this, and still do. “We’re all seeing things. I don’t know how, exactly, but I know some kind of drug is—”



“There’s no drug,” he said. “Only us.”



I felt humiliated. Scared, too. Scared that we were losing our minds. Scared that this was a bad trip that would never end. Scared that Asher would see in my face that I had pulled my own scales off. 



So I went home.



Jason came by. The first thing he did was check me for new scales. Maybe because he saw me with Asher. Who knows? Who cares? I don’t. Not anymore.



Late that night, I went back to the courtyard. I just wanted to be alone. No Jason, no Asher, no Amanda who didn’t even want to talk to me anyway. I didn’t expect anyone to be there, especially not this late.



Except Asher was. 



“Did he take your scales?” he asked.



He was practically glowing. Golden. He looked like an angel. I noticed, though, that his eyes weren’t right. Stiff, somehow. Unmoving. Unseeing.



“No.”



“What happened? Scales don’t fall off unless they rot. Are you rotting?”



“No.”



He grabbed my hands and raised them to his face and breathed deeply. “Why do I smell them on your hands? Scales never grew on your hands.”



My heart thundered. I tried to distract him, tried to make him talk, to say anything, think about anything but—



“You pulled them off.” He sounded almost awestruck. “You took your own scales away.”



He pulled me to my feet, and I let him.



I let him lead me through the courtyard, down the road, and into the culvert.



I let him lead me down the shimmering tree-lined lane with its screaming chorus of unearthly birds, all the way to the carnival under Gut Street.



Asher rang the bell. The ticket man erupted into being, all big bright eyes and an unhappy mouth that did not turn into a smile this time.



Asher said, “My dragon has no scales.”



The ticket man struck, leaping over the counter and crushing me in a bear hug so tight I couldn’t breathe. Dark spots swarmed my vision, and I felt so warm. I wondered, dimly, what would happen to my body down here in the carnival. I decided that I didn’t want to know.



Then the ticket man let go.



Air rushed back. My hands flew to my chest, checking instinctively for injury. Where there should have been skin, I felt something hard and smooth.



Panicking, I pulled my shirt over my head. I knew, somehow, that there was no need for modesty now. And sure enough, when I looked down:



Scales, bright as the sun, red as autumn, shimmering everywhere the ticket man touched. Shoulder to hip, blinding in the afternoon light. Bright as a supernova.



But all I could see was Jason’s face.



I started to peel them away.



Asher lunged. I twisted to the side, but he hit me anyway. Only…the hit didn’t hurt. He tried to grab me, but his hands slid right off. He tried again, and I slipped away.



The ticket man struck. Too fast to see. Too fast to react. And he punched me, square in the chest.



I didn’t even feel it.



But his hand folded in on itself, a mass of blood and rubbery skin and splintered bone. Like a car accordioning in a wreck.



He looked down at his hand, then back at me.



His unhappy mouth turned into a very happy one indeed, and he laughed.



I ran.



His laughter chased me down the street, past the perfect houses and the gleaming sidewalks and the trees all green and gold and red, drowning out the deafening birdsong.



I hit the culvert on my knees and crawled away.



Jason found me cowering in my room, sobbing as I pulled off the scales. They wouldn’t come off easily anymore. They left bruises and blood.



I thought he’d be gentle when he saw that I was trying, when he saw the blood-stained pile shining in the afternoon sun.



But he only got angry.



It made me cry. That worked, somehow. When I was small and scared and telling him how sorry I was, how he was right, how he’d been right all along, he stopped being angry and was himself again. Kind and sweet and gentle.



That should have been the end, but it wasn’t.



Asher came to me that night. I lived on the third story of the apartment. So when I heard tapping on my window, I thought I was dreaming.



When I looked over and saw Asher, radiant and bright as the rising sun with eyes dull and milky, I still thought I was dreaming.



Until he said my name. “Come home. You’re there. I know you’re there. I smell you.”



I got out of bed very slowly, very carefully. I crept out of my room, and down the hall, and out of my apartment, and to Jason.



Long story short — or short story shorter — Jason moved, and took me with him.



My scales kept growing. I kept pulling them. I guess that means nothing changed.



I don’t know if Jason changed or not.



All I know is he couldn’t cope. He couldn’t hold down a job. His well-managed addiction spiraled out of control. He couldn’t even handle his own feelings. He blamed himself for having them, and blamed me for making them worse, and then apologized for blaming me and making me sad. Whenever he got upset or whenever I got upset, he always apologized. Always sobbed his heart out. Always said he was so sorry for being nothing. I didn’t like how he sounded when he apologized for being nothing, though.



Maybe it was just my teenage insecurity, but whenever he apologized for being nothing, he didn’t sound sorry.



He just sounded cruel.



Watching him fade made me feel so guilty.



I told him that once, expecting him to apologize yet again.



But what he said was, “You should be. You’re the one who grew scales.”



That was the day I decided to stop pulling them.



When I stopped pulling them, Jason went off the deep end.



There was one night where I couldn’t take it anymore. He was high as a kite, shivering and shuddering after taking God knew what. I wanted to call an ambulance. 



He said, “An ambulance is too much money to waste on nothing.”



Instead of calling an ambulance. I got into bed and waited for him to fall asleep. Then I searched the house for all his shit, flushing everything I found down the toilet.



After that, I went for a walk.



I wandered for a long time. At some point, I noticed a culvert.



And inside it, something radiant.



I wasn’t even surprised when Asher crawled out.



Twice as tall as he’d ever been, beautiful in ways that nothing should be beautiful. Except for his eyes. Where his eyes had been was a bony plate, glimmering the same color as his wide, white smile.



I turned around and went back home, where I crawled into bed next to Jason.



When I woke up, he was dead.



And as I sat there, numb and angry and guiltier than I have ever been, I felt something hard and light tumble down my stomach..



Then another, and another. Then a cascade



I took off my shirt and watched all my scales slide off.



They never grew back. 



I guess that means Nothing killed the dragon after all.

“So, can you believe I ever passed a psych eval, let alone three?” 



Christophe looked upset. “Do you really think that is a funny thing so say?”



Bypassing that, here’s the sequence of events that resulted in the above heart to heart with my least-favorite wolfman.



Long story short, the commander’s been coming down hard on me to explain what happened with Pierrot. I’ve told him everything I can, but he thinks I’m holding back. Worse, he thinks I might be a security risk. When staff in the Pantheon become security risks, they disappear.



So I’ve been stressing. I’m in trouble. I hate being in trouble, even as a whole-ass adult.



And I don’t think I’ve ever been in worse trouble in my life.



After my fifth post-Pierrot interrogation, I went out for a walk. The facility is deep in the woods, and I mean *deep.* I love being out there. The air is redolent of pine, which reminds me of all the good things about where I grew up while dredging up none of the bad things. It’s soothing.



So that’s what I was doing: Taking a long walk. I had my voice recorder to review yesterday’s interview and catch up on all the work I was missing thanks to the commander’s increasingly unhinged debriefs. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t focus. I finally gave up and tucked it into my pocket.



“You are not supposed to take that outside the facility”



I admit, I screamed.



“You act like you see me for the first time every time,” Christophe complained. 



“What are you doing out here?”



“Working.” He drew up beside me. The usual anxiety and adrenaline that accompanied his presence surged, but for once I was too scared of other things to particularly care. “Unlike you.”



“Then go work.”



“You are my work.”



I thought I was going to cry from frustration. “Are you taking me back for another round with the commander?”



“No. I want to talk to you.”



“About what?”



“Whatever you are holding back, stop. If you don’t talk — or if you do talk and they don’t believe you — they will send you down for evaluation.”



“Down where?”



“R&D.”



“Research and Development?”



“Yes, but we call it Research and Destruction.”



“Great. Have they evaluated you?”



“Many times. It is why I am so cooperative.” 



I hesitated. “I really don’t know what else to tell them.”



“You are lying.”



He was right.



“It has nothing to do with Pierrot or anything.”



“What does it have to do with?”



“Drugs. And a carnival.”



“I was in a carnival once. In the freak show.”



“You didn’t tell me about that.”



“I haven’t told anybody about that, and I don’t want to. Especially not you.”



For some reason, this gave me an idea. “You want to do me a favor?”



“Is there any answer I can give that will not upset you somehow?”



I pulled the voice recorder out of my pocket and held it out. “Here. It’ll be easier talking out here, even to you, than in there with the commander breathing down my neck. He trusts you, and you can tell when I’m lying anyway, right?”



“You tell on yourself. I only hear it.”



“Whatever. Just take it.”



He did. 



I started talking. 



And that’s how I told the scariest thing in the Pantheon the story of how nothing killed a dragon.



Then I made my stupid joke about psych evals, and he told me it wasn’t funny. Then he said, “You forgot all of this happened to you?”



“Definitely not. I just thought everyone was drugging me or something.”



He looked pained. “That is not what drugs do.” Then he looked down at the voice recorder. “I don’t think the commander should hear this.”



“Why?”



“I know the commander. I know he will want to try to make your scales grow back. It seems they grew when you were not feeling safe.”



“They didn’t grow. They weren’t real.”



“I think they were. He will think so too. He will make you feel unsafe to try and make them grow. He will probably use me to do it, and he will make sure I have all my teeth for it. I don’t want that any more than you.”



“What was the point of talking to you?”



“Because I know you are not lying.”



“How does that help me?”



“I will tell him we spoke and that you are confused and frightened, but hiding nothing.”



He held the recorder out.



Anyway, my impromptu interview wasn’t the most important thing that happened tonight.



The most important thing happened when we got back.



Charlie rushed out to meet us. “Where have you been?”



“Working together,” said Christophe.



Charlie looked at us with an expression I didn’t like, but also found amusing. “You’re going to have to work together some other time because you’ve got actual work to do.”



“Which is?”



“The Harlequin.”



I swear my heart stopped.



“They’re ready to take him, and we're leaving at midnight. Rafael’s already pissed.” He looked at me. “So you need to be really careful.”

He and Christophe exchanged another look I didn’t like. We got ready, and now we’re waiting to deploy or whatever the word is for what we’re about to do.



I wish I hadn't spent my last night on earth telling the big bad wolf about the carnival under Gut Street.
