I find most of the places I visit by talking to people on some forums, and subreddits, but lately the pickings have been kind of dry. I’ve started visiting old ones through internet archives and stuff. A lot of the times these places have been torn down or rebuilt at this point, but sometimes you can find some pretty cool places that haven’t been torn down yet. I found this weird post by someone with the username “DastardlyDan” from 2009 yesterday on an old urban exploration forum while messing around with the Wayback Machine earlier this week, though. People getting lost in these places isn’t super uncommon, and generally others can come to their rescue or suggest resources to help (the police aren’t always a great option considering in a lot of cases you are trespassing on private property). With this one though, there were no responses from others in the thread. Normally there’d be at least one or two responses, or a follow-up from the OP saying they got out. I tried to find this place myself and couldn’t find anything that matched his description. I even tried following the directions on Google Maps and couldn’t find it. I just can’t get over it. Something about it messed with me. I figured you all would enjoy this, and maybe you can figure out where this place is. The thread itself is pretty long, taking place over the course of three days, so I’ll be posting it in parts. I’d be interested to at least go see this factory. I don’t think I’d go exploring there though.   
  
First post in the thread: July 8th, 2009  
  
Hey everyone! Dan here. My buddies and I kind of got ourselves in a pickle here. I’m gonna try and give as much detail as I can; the signal’s kind of shit so I can’t upload any pictures. It’s a miracle I’m even able to post this. There’s three of us and we’re all from Florida. I typically am the one who finds the places, Jackson records our adventures on his camcorder, and Paul is just along for the ride most of the time. We went to go visit one of those old houses outside Fayetteville after someone on here suggested it and I made a post here about our trip the other day. Someone in the comments suggested an abandoned factory they had seen in the area. They said they hadn’t explored there yet, and were waiting for the summer to be over, but gave us pretty clear directions on how to get there. They said to take US 401 on the way home and take a dirt road next to a pine tree alone in a field. They said there was no way we could miss it, and sure enough, we took US 401 back and on one of those open stretches where there’s nothing but woods and the road, on the right there was a single pine tree in a field with a dirt road beside it.   
  
“Pull over, I think this it,” I said to Paul from the back seat.  
As he pressed on the brakes and steered off to the side of the road, he looked uneasy. His dark eyes stared down the road as he said, “Dan, what if this is just someone’s house or something? Why would a factory be down a road like this?”  
  
“Then we turn around and head home. No harm, no foul,” I said nonchalantly. I tied my long blonde hair back and started psyching myself up. I was really hoping this wasn’t going to be that and that we hadn’t been mislead or something. “Jackson, is the battery charged?”  
  
Jackson rolled his eyes from the passenger seat. “Yes, I charged it at the motel before coming here and haven’t turned it on since we left.”  
  
“That’s what you said before the mansions, but then it died twenty minutes in.”  
  
He turned around and shot me a look. “That was a one-time thing. You’re the one who told me not to waste the money on an extra battery.”  
  
“My point stands.”  
He flipped me the bird and turned back to the front. We sat in silence as Paul drove down the dirt road cut through the trees.  
The road was long. We’d probably been going down it for half an hour when Paul finally said, “Jesus, how long is this road?”  
  
“Maybe it’s a nuclear power plant or something. That could be why it’s so far away and in the middle of nowhere.”   
  
Jackson turned to me. “Wouldn’t there be security or some kind of sign telling us to stay away or something? Even if it’s abandoned.”  
  
I shrugged. “Maybe it’s really old and they hadn’t started doing that stuff yet.”  
  
Jackson scoffed. “I find that hard to believe.”  
  
Jackson is a nice guy, all around. He’s always thinks he’s right, though. We’ve gotten into a ton of arguments over the dumbest shit, mostly because I just like to do it. Sometimes though, his attitude gets on my nerves. It’s like he’s incapable of admitting his own mistakes. It’s always someone else’s fault with him.   
  
Finally, after another twenty minutes of driving, we saw a clearing up ahead. It looked like once the road entered the clearing it taped off. I could see some tire tracks in the grass as we got closer.   
  
Once we entered the clearing, we could finally see the factory.   
  
There was one main building with two smokestacks on the left, and a handful of buildings around it. Behind the main building, we could see a couple of short warehouses in the back. Paul drove up to the front of the main building and parked a few yards from the door. The windows were cracked and missing pieces of glass, and the bricks were overgrown with vines that sprouted from the dirt like massive hands dragging the building underground. Weirdly, there was no company branding or anything on the building. No sign out front or logo hinting at what was inside.   
  
I clapped and rubbed my hands together. “You guys ready for this?”  
  
Any uneasiness from before had faded from Paul’s eyes, replaced with a bubbling excitement. As you guys know, the best part of exploring abandoned places like this is the moment right before you enter, when your mind is racing with possibilities of what you might find inside. Jackson had the camcorder out and was doing last minute checks on the settings. I got all of our bags out and made sure we all had our walkie talkies, flashlights, pocket knives, and first aid kits. You never knew where these places would lead or the environment you’d end up in.    
  
We exited the car, and I turned to Jackson. He had his camcorder up, and the red light was blinking. I waved to the camera and started practically skipping towards the door. Jackson stood back, filming the surroundings and capturing the field behind us. You could barely see the entrance to the dirt road from our angle. Paul walked behind me. We stood at the door, waiting for Jackson to join us.   
  
“You comin’?” I called.   
  
“One sec…”  
  
Jackson’s camera was focused on an upstairs window.  
  
I walked over. “What is it?”  
  
“I thought I saw something in the window.”  
  
I punched his shoulder. “Dude, it’s probably just some crackhead or squatter. You know they hang out at these places all the time.”  
  
He glanced at me and returned his gaze to the window. He sighed. “You’re probably right. Let’s go.”  
  
Paul called out. “Dan, Jack, the door’s locked.”  
  
I grinned. “So, we get to make our own? This just keeps getting better and better!”  
  
I scanned the ground and found a fairly sizeable rock, about the size of a baseball. I picked it up, dusted it off, and aimed for a window.   
  
It went straight through with a loud shatter that echoed inside the factory.  
  
I walked up to the window and knocked away the remaining glass shards.   
  
Looking inside, the place looked mostly gutted. There were steel pillars supporting the ceiling, but aside from a few pieces of general industrial junk like pieces of concrete there was nothing else inside. I could see a doorway on the far wall but couldn’t really make out anything beyond that. I could smell rust in the stale air.   
  
I turned to the camera. “You guys ready?”  
  
Jackson nodded and smiled from behind the camera as I swung my leg over the ledge and stepped inside.    
  
Once inside, the smell intensified. The air itself smelled rotten and dead more so than other places we had explored. I looked around the room. Just as I thought, it was totally empty. I shined a light at the doorway and could see shapes in the darkness.   
Jackson and Paul followed behind. Paul retched. “What is that smell?”  
  
“No idea. I think I see the work floor up ahead through there though,” I said, pointing at the doorway.   
  
“Let’s go check it out,” Jackson said, plowing forward with his camcorder in one hand and flashlight in the other.   
  
Our voices echoed in the large space, creating an eerie feedback-loop that hung in the air.   
  
As Jackson approached the door, he paused, pointing the camera at a piece of concrete about the size of a basketball on the ground. “What the hell is that?”  
  
I walked up next to him and gasped.  
  
A bird lay underneath the concrete, smashed into a bloody smear of feathers and guts against the ground. One of its wings stuck out from beneath the rubble like an outstretched arm.   
  
This was fresh.  
  
I shined my flashlight into the dark doorway as Jackson remained frozen in place. Paul walked over and immediately gagged, turning away and grabbing onto a pillar as he held his stomach.  
  
“Guess we found out what the smell was. Poor guy’s probably only been dead a couple days,” I said, scanning the doorway for any sign of movement. There were no other entrances or exits to the room outside of this doorway and the locked door from before.  
  
And of course, our makeshift broken-window door.  
  
Paul walked over, clearly upset. “Are you kidding? That thing looks like it’s just been killed!”  
  
“That smell that’s making you wanna puke only starts after a day. Decomposition takes time,” I retorted.   
  
“What the hell could have done that? Not one of us could pick up that piece of concrete,” Jackson said, finally breaking his gaze from the deceased animal.   
  
“Let’s find out.” I rolled up my sleeves and walked over to the piece of concrete. I grimaced and tried my best to grab the sides of the rubble without touching the body and got a decent grip on it. I tensed my muscles and tried to lift it to no avail.  
I stood back and dusted my hands of on my jeans. “Probably just some junkie with crackhead strength. We should all be on our guard and keep it down though in case he’s still around here.”   
  
“Fuck this, I don’t want to screw around with some junkie,” Paul yelled. He was shaking. We hadn’t bumped into people before but knew it was always a risk. “Let’s just go.”  
  
I walked over to him and put my hand on his shoulder. “Paul, there are three of us, who all have knives. We’re safe, okay? This is no different than all the other times we’ve been exploring. Remember the rat?”  
  
About a year ago we were checking out an old treehouse in our town that had supposably been abandoned. We walked inside and there were beer cans and cigarette butts all over the place; it was clear it had become some kind of hangout spot for the teens around. In a corner of the room, there was a piece of twine with a rat’s body hanging from it. Paul had reacted similarly, freaking out thinking that some crazy person had done it, and I reminded him that it was probably just some kids doing a dumb prank.   
I didn’t think this was some kind of prank though. That was part of the reason I tried to lift the concrete. To be honest, I was kind of nervous about the whole thing myself. It didn’t make sense, even to me, for even a bum or something to do this, much less have the actual strength to lift something like that with enough force to be able to do the damage done to the bird.  
But I wanted to explore. I wanted to see more of this place, crackhead or not. So, I kept a calm demeanor and tried my best to calm Paul down.   
  
  
“Besides, addicts aren’t people to be afraid of. They’re people, just like you and me.”  
  
Thankfully, it worked. He seemed to relax a bit with this thought. I turned back to Jackson, who still had his camcorder out.   
  
“Y’all ready to see the work-floor? Let’s find out what kind of factory this was,” I said, flashing a smile.    
  
My friends reluctantly followed me, and God I wish they hadn’t.   
  
We traveled through the doorway and entered the massive work-floor. It was hard to tell with the darkness and cluttered surroundings, but I’d say the room was about the size of a basketball court. I shone my flashlight on the dark shapes I had seen before. They were textile machines. There were dozens of them, aligned in tight rows. It was darker in here than the first room; there was only one row of windows on the left side of the room. It looked like there was an office or something in the back left corner of the room, separated from the machines. The floor was covered in rotten cotton and paper.  
  
“What happened here?” Jackson said, walking over to one of the machines with a crank on the side. He gently pushed it, and it made a sickening creak that echoed throughout the room.   
  
“Isn’t that the question we always ask?” I joked.  
  
Jackson chuckled. “I guess that’s true.”  
  
We walked among the machines. They were worn down by time. Some of them, like the scutching machine (I had to look that one up; it’s what they use to purify the cotton) still had material in them, though it was rotted beyond belief. Some of it was growing mold that created a smell of decay in the air. There were doors at seemingly random points on the wall, but each was locked or stuck and wouldn’t budge.   
  
“Did anyone else notice how much colder it is in here?” Paul said, rubbing his arms.   
  
I looked down at mine and saw goosebumps. It was weirdly chilly here, especially for North Carolina in July. “Maybe it’s some kind of draft that blows through here or something.”  
  
Our steps echoed softly in the room as we silently all looked around and took it in. I began to make my way to the office I had seen in the back of the room.   
  
“You guys ready to check out the office? Doesn’t look like there’s much more in this building,” I asked.   
  
My friends nodded as they walked over to me. Jackson put his camcorder away, exchanging it for his pocket knife. The office had no windows, and the door was slightly ajar.  
  
With my friends behind me, I pulled out my knife and stood on the side of the hinges of the door. I pushed it open gently and waited a moment. I glanced back at my friends and stepped inside.  
  
It was pitch black in here. Without any windows, the only light came from the doorway. I shone my flashlight around the room. It was pretty simply furnished, with a wood desk and chair on the left side of the room, a bookshelf in the back left corner, and a filing cabinet on the right. The walls were beige and unadorned, aside from a clock beside the door. I walked over to the filing cabinet and pulled it open. It was full of manilla folders full of paperwork packets and what I would assume to be company memos. I pulled one out and set it on the desk. I took off the rubber bands that were tying the documents together and opened it. It was some kind of employee handbook or something. The company listed on the front was ‘Devorator Textiles’.  
  
“Weird ass name,” I muttered under my breath as I begin flipping through the document.   
  
“Hey, check this out. I think there’s something behind the bookshelf,” Jackson said.  
  
I turned my head up to him. “Look.”   
  
He pointed to a sliver of dark wood that peeked out from behind the bookshelf. It stood in stark contrast to the light beige of the walls.   
  
Paul walked over. “Let’s move the bookshelf.”  
  
I nodded in agreement and walked over. I stood on the edge closest to the wall while Paul and Jackson pulled on it from the other side. The bookshelf creaked as it began to tip over.  
  
“Shit, shit, shit, shit!” I yelled, running to the other side in a desperate attempt to keep it from falling.   
  
It tipped over on its face with a deafening crash.  
  
“So much for staying quiet,” I sneered, looking down at the bookshelf.  
  
“Holy shit,” Paul whispered softly.  
  
I turned my head up to see what the bookshelf had revealed.  
  
It was a door.   
  
“Dude, this is sick!” Jackson exclaimed, grabbing his camcorder out of his bag.   
  
A deep feeling of dread began to set in. It was like a primal part of my brain knew something was wrong about that door. We should have turned back.   
  
But that adventurous spirit in me reared its head and spat in the face of my doubts. I had to go forward. I was an explorer.   
  
“Let’s see where this goes,” I announced, reaching tentatively for the handle.   
  
It was like every instinct I had was telling me to not touch that doorknob, but I did it anyways. I grasped it gently and slowly turned it. The door opened with a creak and revealed a staircase descending down.  
  
Jackson laughed. “Dude, this is nuts! We gotta post this to YouTube or something when we get out of here.” He stepped into the doorway with his camcorder and flashlight in hand, descending the stairs rapidly.  
  
Paul followed behind him, and I brought up the rear. As I stepped in the doorway, something told me to make sure that door didn’t close. I stepped back into the office and pushed the bookshelf slightly into the doorway, propping the door open. I then raced down the steps to catch up with my friends in the growing darkness.  
  
It's funny, when you’re in a pitch black room, you can’t imagine that it could possibly be darker. As we descended the steps and got further and further away from the doorway though, it did just that. It was as if the darkness was growing in intensity. Maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me or something but I could have sworn that our flashlights were getting dimmer and the air was getting colder, almost icy, with every step we took.  
  
My mind wandered back to the bird corpse we had found maybe an hour prior to this. Maybe the killer was lurking down here in the shadows.   
  
After walking down these steps for a few moments, it was like the cold had reached a threshold of some kind. My teeth were chattering.  
  
“I can see the end up ahead. Almost there,” Jackson called out.   
  
I looked over his shoulder. I could see a small rectangle of light ahead of him.   
  
We pressed on, and found ourselves in some kind of cellar. There were crates lining the walls. The light came from an oil lantern hanging from the ceiling. I switched off my flashlight and walked over to the lantern.  
  
“Shouldn’t this be out?” I asked aloud.  
  
Jackson and Paul had begun inspecting the crates. In comparison to what we had seen above, these were all in good shape. They looked old and weathered, sure, but the structural integrity of the container was still intact. They were chattering to each other attempting to figure out how to open one of them when Paul looked up at me.  
  
“I don’t know about you but that all that darkness was getting to me. There’s light down here, and I’m not gonna argue about whether or not it should be. I’m just happy we can see our own hands without a flashlight.”  
I looked around the room. There was another door.  
  
Loud thumps behind me snatched my attention. I turned around to see Paul repeatedly kicking a crate trying to open it, while Jackson filmed it.   
  
“Hey, if you two knuckleheads are done screwing around, I’m pretty sure there’s more to this basement.”  
  
They stopped their assault of the crate to look at me, and then noticed the door.   
  
“Oh shit, the mystery deepens,” Jackson said, turning the camcorder to the door. “Shall we continue on our journey?”  
  
Paul came up beside him and nudged him. “I think we have to.”  
  
Paul stepped in front and opened the door. He stepped inside and we followed behind him.  
  
We found ourselves in a duplicate version of the office above, except this time there were two strange paintings on the wall behind the desk. I walked over to get a better look as Jackson began to inspect the bookshelf and Paul walked over the filing cabinet.   
The two paintings were in gold frames, displaying scenes that looked mundane until closer inspection. One showed peaceful countryside with a bridge over a creek. Beside the bridge there was an oak tree. It looked innocent enough until you noticed that the shadow of the oak tree depicted someone hanging.   
  
The other painting showed a scene from a party that looked like a scene straight out of The Great Gatsby. However, each guest’s face was contorted with pain or fear, rather than joy and merriment. The dancing looked more like panicked flailing.   
  
“What the fuck?” Jackson screamed from the other room.   
  
I ripped my gaze from the strange paintings and sprinted through the doorway, Paul following closely behind me. When I got to Jackson and looked around, my stomach dropped.  
  
This was not the same room we were just in.    
  
The entry hallway was gone. We were now back on the work floor, except everything was in perfect condition. The windows were no longer cracked, and the machines were neat and in order.   
   
I sprinted back into the office. It had changed too. The wallpaper was peeling and the smell of mold filled the air. The file cabinet was thrown open and the papers were scattered everywhere.  
  
“What the fuck happened?” I muttered.   
  
Jackson and Paul began to enter the office.   
  
Suddenly something clicked into place.  I screamed, “Stop!” and walked over to them, out of the office.   
  
I shut the door behind me and opened it. Sure, enough, it was now more decrepit, except the files were all back in the cabinet.  
  
“Each time we change rooms it’s taking us deeper. We shouldn’t have left the first room. We need to stay here,” I explained, closing the door again. I pulled out my cell phone. I still had a signal, thank God.   
  
I opened up the forum page and logged in. “I’m gonna make a SOS post on the forum. We need to wait for someone else to come get us.”  
  
“Who the fuck made you the leader? You’re the reason we’re stuck down here in the first place!” Paul suddenly screamed, lunging towards me.   
  
Jackson caught him. “Hey, chill the hell out. We don’t know what the fuck is going on, but it’s not gonna help if we’re fighting.”  
  
“He fucking got us in some trippy-ass Twin Peaks type shit. Fuck this. Why should we stay here? We can walk outside,” he exclaimed, at the end pointing at one of the shipment gates that was cracked open.  
  
I paused. “We don’t know what’s out there.”  
  
Jackson released Paul, and he seemed to shake off the rage. He still glared at me and stared at Jackson as he stepped in front of me. “Now, hold on. That isn’t a bad idea. It looks like it just goes outside.”  
  
I looked at him like he was stupid. “Okay, let’s be real for a second. We went who knows how many stories underground. We found one room, entered another one from that, and the first room is now gone, replaced with a duplicate copy of a room upstairs. How the hell could we possibly have gotten to ground level?”  
  
Jackson shrugged. “It makes sense to me.”  
  
“No, it doesn’t,” I spat. “Do whatever you guys want. I’m gonna get writing this post while I still have a battery.” I turned away and focused on my phone.  
  
I heard them pause and mutter something to each other for a moment, and their footsteps slowly grew softer on the concrete floor. I heard a metallic groan as they opened the door. I scoffed.  
  
A couple minutes later, I heard screaming. I was almost done with the post. I bolted outside to find Paul on the ground, some twenty feet away from Jackson, who was close to the door.   
  
Paul was convulsing on the ground, in agony. He was the one screaming.   
  
I began to step forward and Jackson shot his arm out, unable to tear his eyes from Paul as he writhed in agony.   
  
“Someone, please! Someone help me!”  
  
I pushed Jackson’s arm down. “What the fuck? Why aren’t you helping him?”  
  
Jackson pointed to small line of dirt around four feet from Paul. “It started when he crossed that line.”  
  
“What do you mean?”  
  
“He stepped over that line, made it about three steps and collapsed.”  
  
Blood was now coming out of Paul’s eyes and ears as he shook. He was no longer screaming.  
  
Suddenly, he stopped. He coughed, and a splurt of blood shot out of his mouth and turned to froth on his lips.  
  
And then his chest stopped moving.  
  
Paul’s fucking dead.
