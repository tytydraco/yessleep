*Ol Sonf Virot, Zodacare!* I can still hear these words, that have burned themselves into my brain. The memory of her and how I met her, was in a way stereotypical of what we were not. I will just spit it out. Do not judge me. Fine, of course, we met at a cemetery. Late at night on All Saints. 

Trees and graves were engulfed in the red light of the candles people put for those they miss dearly. The mourners were mostly gone, really I thought I was all alone, sitting on a bench. 

Sometimes, a thing's value is greater than the sum of its parts. This is true for anything where a particular combination of items or structure plays any kind of role. Think of a family. Think of a painting. Think language. Think about your body. 

The human body is a funny thing. Even if someone looks like they are light as a feather when they move, they become so heavy, once they stop. They become impossible to move. A limb body is very difficult to carry, even if two people are trying to handle it, while any man can carry their wife over the doorstep. It is another one of those instances. The body and the soul. Assuming there is such a thing.

One should tell some more about myself here, as all this happened, right after I started studying in the little German town of K. I was at a good point in my life. I had moved out from my parental home, which was plaguing me with difficulties I do not want to describe in any amount of detail. I had all the time in the world to pursue my occult interests. It was just perfect for me. 

Unlike most of my peers, I had a clear idea of where I wanted to go, and it was kind of unusual. Apart from general linguistics, I loved the interactions of the Semitic languages with Indo-European ones, I had a deep interest in Yiddish and Ladino, but also just the pure beauty of Quranic Arabic, Old Persian, and Sanskrit. What fascinated me even more than the beauty of the languages and their interplay, were the different philosophies that were associated with them. 

Some of my friends back home, if you can really call them that, could be described as following a gothic aesthetic. None of them had contacted me since I moved away. I am out of that scene now, but think the Cure, black clothing, white makeup, pentagrams, and all that. I was more interested in the occult itself and never really dressed the part except for maybe one earring that I had on my left ear. It started initially with an Ouija board, when I was 9, progressed with the usual “satanic literature” that my friends exchanged when I was 11 or so, and by the age of 13, I was fully engaged in trying to read and protrude to the secrets of Plato, Proclus, Plotinus and the likes of them. By the age of 18, graduating from my high school studies a year ahead of time, I was fully at home in the occult and esoteric.

I need to stress again that while I had friends from the scene and I listened to Bauhaus and Ministry, I was not your stereotypical goth in any way. The study of ancient Arabic texts, Yoga Sutras, and similar materials was very serious to me and I thought of myself as a true academic. 

I did not even hear her approach when she just walked by. Slightly younger than me, which at that age was an incredible age to be for an attractive woman. It felt like she came back to me almost from a previous life, that I thought I had buried behind me, from her youthful appearance to the gothic dress she was wearing. She was skinny, frail almost, and her pale skin reflected the moonlight. She would have fitted perfectly into my old friend group, and I was for the first moment even wondering if I knew her. There was a certain familiarity between us already. Sometimes the parts are more than their sum, even before their structure or their relation to each other is fully established I guess.

Necromancy is one of the aspects of occultism that I never took particularly seriously. The old masters, such as Artaxerxes or Origen were either in the mythographical retellings of their lives involved in it or even wrote about it, however, my standpoint has always been that there is a perennial cycle and that it needs to follow the direction that the one has intended for it. When something does, decays and thus brings forth new life, it is unnatural to reverse this process. 

I waited a few minutes and followed her at a distance. I was curious and in any case, my intention was to not stay longer at the cemetery now. My quietude and the atmosphere of serenity had been disturbed.

I stayed on the main path, walking now extremely slowly and only looking at her in the periphery of my vision as if she could feel my glances more if they were direct. She must be aware of my presence, or so I thought. She went into one of the lines of graves and walked swiftly between the red candles through the dark and cold November air. To not make her more uncomfortable than I probably already have, I only now had the idea that she might be here to visit one of the graves as a mourning person, I stood for a moment, looking at the stars. The white lights in the sky seemed to mirror the red ones on the ground for a moment and I felt the connection that the Ancients have metaphorically described. I could not say now for how long I stood there, looking upwards like a fool. When I looked around the next time, I could swear then that it had only been a few seconds, it felt like it had gotten darker and that the lights at the graves had gotten more intensely red. The bleeding wounds of those left behind glowed bloody red in the dark. She was nowhere to be seen. I must have stared longer than I thought, I was sure, and with an uncanny feeling made my way to the exit of the cemetery.

I was conscious of my heartbeat in my ears now, and the dry air seemed to cut into my nostrils. It felt like what I could see clearly earlier, was not anything but a black void in between the sea of red lights. A distant chanting, quiet but distinct, could be heard. At first, I could not make out the words. The words were not in the local language or Latin, as one would expect. It was another language, a much younger one.

*Ol Sonf Virot, Zodacare!*

*Ol Sonf Virot, Zodacare!*

*Ol Sonf Virot, Zodacare!*

It was the same Enochian phrase that has been chanted over and over, and while I was not certain about the precise meaning of the word *Virot* in this context, it could be spirit, but it could also be a dead person. I understood, precisely, what was going on here. 

I started walking again. It felt like the chants were piercing my eardrums, and my nostrils burned with the cold and now foul-smelling air. I could feel my heart pounding, my forehead felt feverish. I consciously tried to blink because my eyes felt itchy in the cold still air. This was the first time I had encountered anything like this. Apart from my Quija board, I never practiced for more than the fun of it. I walked past the WWII memorial to my left, which is encircled by large pine trees when between the red lights I would make out the ghastly sight. The young woman was clearly struggling to lift something in front of her. I hoped she was putting something down, such as a candle, but it was impossible to miss that she was pulling on an arm, jerking on it, as if she was trying to draw a demon up from hell. She grunted as she worked on whoever, or whatever, was lying in front of her. The chants were still audible, stronger now than before, but they clearly could not have been coming from her. They were growing in intensity when her struggling stopped and the monstrosity in front of her lifted itself by its own accord. I had stopped in shock at what I was seeing when she turned her head. I am still not entirely sure of this, either the multitude of candles reflected in her eyes or I saw the bloody red glow of hers stare back at me.

The deep red stare is the last thing that I remember from this night before I found myself in the hallway in front of my apartment.
