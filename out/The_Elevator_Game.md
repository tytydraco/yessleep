As I studied the rules on my phone, a vibrant glow enveloped my face, as if casting a magical enchantment upon me. The rules unraveled before my eyes, their words etched in bold and captivating letters. "Times New Roman?" I snickered. "Seriously? Couldn't they have chosen a more exciting font?" The message itself seemed to speak directly to me, starting with a simple greeting: "Hello Jane." It urged me to approach this journey cautiously, with unwavering determination.  I couldn't help but chuckle at the exaggerated theatrics, finding them rather amusing.  

Nevertheless, I continued reading, uncovering the steps necessary to successfully complete the ritual.  "To proceed, find a building with at least ten stories," the text stated . Fortunately, luck was on my side, as there behold a grand seventeen-floor structure just blocks away from my parents' place. This particular building emitted an air of dullness and weariness, filled with middle-aged men, their existence seemed devoid of purpose, drowned in a sea of sadness. Inside those walls, a printing company toiled away, its main purpose is to produce calendars adorned with beautiful pictures showcasing European landmarks. Until now, that building held no significance for me, lacking any real connection. 

As I read the next instruction, it unfolded before me: "Once you've found your desired building, enter the elevator alone. No exceptions. This rule is ABSOLUTE." And then came the third rule: "Take a journey through the floors, going up to the FOURTH, then down to the SECOND. Go up again to the SIXTH, back down to the SECOND. Finally, ascend to the TENTH, before descending again to the FIFTH floor." These words, woven with intrigue, captured my attention, pulling me further into the mysterious enigma that awaited me.

‚ÄúWhen you reach the fifth floor a girl will come in, do not speak to her SHE IS NOT HUMAN. If you do talk to her, she‚Äôll take you away.‚Äù ‚ÄúPress one and if the elevator instead starts going up to the tenth floor, then congratulations you have successfully entered another world, when there is no here except you. Have a safe journey.‚Äù  I reread the rules making sure I fully understood them. I read the instructions once more, truly comprehending their essence.

My affinity for horror games had always been strong; I had ventured into the realms of Bloody Mary, Ouija Board, Tsuji-Ura, and countless others. However, despite all the fun they provided, these experiences merely unfolded as mere games, failing to deliver on the promise of encounters with unearthly entities. So, I entered the elevator, my expectations aligned with this pattern. 

However it was pretty stupid for me to think that I could successfully play this game being that a person entered the elevator at each stop. With every stop, workers would enter and exit, causing my frustration to grow exponentially. "The only way to truly play this game is at night, when there are no more workers in the building," I silently mused. The act of trespassing under the cover of darkness turned out to be less difficult than initially presumed, especially considering the insignificance attached to any potential events within the confines of this old building.

I was finally alone, as I once again stepped into the elevator. The ambiance changing from loud office buzz to eerie silence. 

With each floor I rode on the elevator, my anticipation grew. The mechanical sounds echoed through the empty shaft, intensifying the night's stillness. When the doors opened on the second floor, a dimly lit hallway stretched before me, as if time had frozen in this desolate realm. I ascended to the sixth floor and descended again, heightening the surreal experience. 

As the tenth floor doors opened, an otherworldly silence greeted me, charged with an incomprehensible energy. Pressing the button for the fifth floor, my heart raced with anticipation.  The elevator began its descent, and as it reached the fifth floor, the doors slowly opened. A girl, seemingly no older than fifteen, stood before me. Her appearance was ethereal, her eyes piercing and her presence captivating. Remembering the warning from the rules, I resisted the urge to speak, though curiosity gnawed at me. Her gaze met mine, and a mischievous smile played on her lips. Without uttering a word, she stepped into the elevator, standing inches away from me. The air grew heavier as an eerie silence settled between us.  

As the elevator doors closed, a strange sensation washed over me.  Her voice pierced the air, sending chills down my spine. "Hi! What time is it?" she asked, her tone increasingly sinister. Ignoring her only fueled her determination. "What time is it?" she demanded again, her voice deepening as she inched closer. Fear gripped me, and I tightly shut my eyes. But her relentless repetition of those four words echoed relentlessly until an eerie silence took over. Slowly, I dared to open my eyes, and to my relief, she had vanished into thin air, leaving behind an unsettling emptiness. 

The space within the confines of the elevator seemed to shift, morphing into something unrecognizable. My heart pounded in my chest as I pressed on the first floor button. The elevator jerked into motion, but instead of descending to the first floor, it began ascending to the tenth.  A mixture of awe, fear, and excitement swirled within me. I had successfully entered another world. The realization dawned upon me that I had embarked on an adventure unlike any other, with unknown possibilities stretching out before me.  

(Hey guys!! This is my own version of the elevator game. I will be posting part two once I‚Äôve finished studying for my midterms üòµ)
