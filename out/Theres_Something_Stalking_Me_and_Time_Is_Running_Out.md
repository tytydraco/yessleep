Things have escalated now, to a point that I’m not sure I can reasonably handle.

When this all began, the entity specialized in remaining just out of my sight, subtly alerting me to its presence through interfering with my bodily warning systems. The tell-tale sign that it was watching me or lurking nearby was the quickening of my heartbeat, the shortness of my breath, the tingling of my skin. Furthermore, it would target me while I was alone, appear to me while I was completely isolated. That first encounter happened during the dark of midnight in my room, the second in my shower, the third when I was in the midst of a sleepy daze in bed.

Allowing me to bear witness to its physical form in my dorm room with my roommate around had felt like a break in pattern, and while I hadn’t necessarily guessed that this would be the case from now on, apparently that instance broke the floodgates wide open.

I see it everywhere now.

It still retains a bit of stealth; sometimes, it will take me a while to notice it, sometimes it’s ever so carefully tucked away in a pocket of space that my eyes might not see it upon first entering a location. But regardless of where it may be ‘hiding,’ it always allows me to find it eventually.

Before, I was capable of tucking it away in the recesses of my brain during normal life for the most part. I’d have lingering feelings of dread and paranoia, but I could function as I needed to around other people, accomplish the tasks I needed to get done. While It felt as though I was fighting demons when alone, it was more akin to leading a double life.

Now, this entity was actively ruining my existence.

When I woke up and got dressed this morning, I could see it lurking behind me in my mirror, its form no longer present once I hastily turned around. The lights of the room had been turned on, so it could’ve been my best look at it yet had I not been so hasty to move, but it seemed to flicker out of existence in an instant. Luckily, or unluckily, depending on how you look at it, I would be treated to a very clear view of it throughout the rest of the day. This first sighting set the tone for what would be the most grueling day of my life, the existential dread I keep talking about settling in strong only minutes after the day had begun.

 I noticed it again as I trudged through the snow on my way to the dining hall, standing by the entrance and steadily swiveling its head so that its empty eye sockets were always trained on me. Despite the miserably cold winter day that was currently plaguing campus life, the sun was shining brightly overhead, and for the first time the entity was displayed to me in utmost clarity.

It was indeed tall like I had estimated last night, not inhumanly so, but on par with the height of some of the NBA players I’ll see on television when my father watches basketball. It definitely had most of the bodily traits any human would have, and while I can’t totally explain it, the humanly traits were strangely perfect. Its arms, legs, chest, torso, neck, and even head and facial structure looked as though they had been chiseled flawlessly, not in a body-builder sort of sense, but just shaped to what most people would consider utter perfection for the human race. Despite appearing completely naked, it possessed no type of genitalia. There was no gender-defining qualities to be found, and the entirety of its body was made up of extremely smooth skin of a pale, gray-ish tone. It seemed to favor stiffly remaining in one spot rather than making movements, but even so, just looking at it in broad daylight made the scenery around it begin to distort into a blurry haze if I didn’t routinely rip my attention away from it.

Now that I had a better visual on it, I could see that its eyes weren’t necessarily empty sockets as they had seemed in the dark. Instead, they were simply divots in the shape and size of a typical human eyeball, permeated by the monotone skin as every other part of its body was. Its mouth appeared to be forever shut, and there were no holes to be found in its nose or ears.

Nothing about it felt real, and as I described after I had witnessed it moving last night, the world around me began to feel faker and faker the more I thought about this being’s existence.

I think my body must have went on autopilot while my brain malfunctioned trying to make sense of a world where beings like this could exist, as I eventually snapped out of my trance to discover I had taken an alternate route and arrived at a different entrance to the dining hall, avoiding the one where the entity was waiting for me.

As I ate breakfast, my eyes were darting wildly around the room, searching for where it might be watching me from now. It was worse not being able to see it, but knowing it was still out there, undoubtedly still watching my with its blank and unwavering gaze.

It was *always* staring, never letting me out of its sight.

I nearly vomited what little I had eaten when I realized it was sitting to the right of me in the booth I was in.

It definitely hadn’t been there when I first sat down with my bowl of cereal, which meant it had silently materialized while I was scouting the broader room. Everything in me froze as I involuntarily held my breath and stopped blinking, save for the steady pounding of my heart and slight quiver of my hands.

I tried everything in my power to ignore it, utilizing every mental trick I had gathered over the past few days to try and fortify my mind against it. None of it was working anymore. I couldn’t let my thoughts stray from it for too long, as if compelled by an immaterial and conceptual magnet my thoughts always returned to the entity, my eyes always gravitating towards its foreboding figure.

*“I’m sorry,”* its words filled my mind louder than ever before, the sounds of the dining hall falling silent. *“They require a balance. We love the both of you.”*

I’m a little embarrassed to admit that I took off running. I’m sure many confused eyes were on me as I dashed away from the booth, leaving behind my unfinished bowl of cereal and plowing out of the dining hall and into the snowy day outside. I mindlessly kept running, inhaling sharp breaths of freezing cold air as I went.

I soon came to a forced-stop as I slipped on a patch of ice in the middle of the sidewalk, roughly falling onto my rear and then collapsing onto my back. No one was around at that moment to witness my fall, and the aching pain that followed returned at least a little bit of my senses. I was able to peel myself off the frozen ground and walk it off, shivering as I shoved my hands inside my pockets.

It was certainly cold outside, but nowhere near enough to instill this bitter chill that enveloped my bones; I knew *that* had to be a side effect of the being’s presence.

I soon made it inside the education building that contained the room where I’d be taking my literary final; yesterday, I had built up a lot of optimistic courage about talking to Hazel, but now, that was getting drowned out by the chronic fear being stalked by this otherworldly being brought me. As I traversed the halls, ascending the staircase to the second floor, I could see its reflection in every windowpane, its empty eyes always trained directly on me. My breath was becoming labored, the chill inside of me becoming replaced by a spreading and overpowering warmth that prompted sweat to drip down my sides.

I felt like I had just traveled the nine circles of hell by the time I reached the classroom, several of the students already at their desks giving me odd looks as I hobbled to the seat I always took. I must have looked terrible, between the awful sleep I had been getting, the paranoid sensation that just wouldn’t quit, the fall a few minutes ago, and now the physical stress my body was enduring all adding up and taking its toll on my outward appearance.

“You alright, man?” Zachary asked from the desk next to me, light concern in his eyes.

“Yeah, just… nervous,” I said, unconvincingly.

“You got this,” Zachary replied encouragingly, giving me a wink.

I knew he was talking about my planned conversation with Hazel, but I needed a different type of help altogether. A part of my mind still managed to be self-conscious at the thought of Hazel, and I looked around the room to see if she had been there to witness my pathetic-looking entrance. Thankfully, she hadn’t arrived yet, and I used this extra time to fix up my hair the way I wanted it.

The literature professor entered the room a few seconds later, the short old man with white hair giving us his usual warm greeting as he set down a pile of books and papers onto his wooden desk at the head of the classroom. I glanced at the clock in the left corner to see how much time was left before the final and immediately wished I hadn’t; standing in the corner, its large frame blocking the clock, was the entity, just barely out of reach of my peripheral vision.

It was extremely unnerving to see it standing among a classroom full of students, yet no one else noticing it at all. Even when in a room full of other people, I was still hopelessly alone; suffering through the knowledge of the existence of this entity was my cross to bear and mine alone.

Footsteps diverted my attention from the entity, as I turned my head to see Hazel walking into the room.

She looked gorgeous, as always. Her skin tone was a smooth blend of light and dark, her hair auburn red, her figure slender and tall. She wore a modest yet alluring outfit that complemented her hair color, her confident smile completing her beauty.

Normally, when she entered a room, a fluttering in my chest overwhelmed me and fantasies of being someone she cared about dominated my headspace.

Today, it was a little more complicated.

The twitterpated feeling I had become addicted to over the course of the semester fought to be present, but the lingering dread from the entity fought for dominance over my emotions. This resulted in a strange, hollow feeling as I watched her walk across the room and take a seat, an empty sorrow settling in as I realized just how messed up my headspace truly was.

When the final exams were handed out, I could hardly concentrate. The words seemed to swim around the page, my head pounded with pain whenever I tried to formulate coherent sentences to write as answers to the essay questions. This was usually my specialty class, one of the few places I could show off my talents which were largely contained to reading and writing, but now, I couldn’t even gather myself enough to feel confident in anything I was putting down.

The time melted away, and I dejectedly handed the exam back to the professor, slowly walking back into the hallway and resisting the urge to clutch my head as it throbbed with pain. The plan had been to wait for Hazel to finish the exam too, catch her on the way out and strike up a conversation about how the semester had gone and what she planned to do over the month of winter vacation. Break the ice, then figure out how to ask for her number, ask her out directly, or do something that would result in igniting a relationship with her.

But as I took a look back at her while in the doorway between the hallway and the classroom, seeing her innocent beauty in contrast to the monstrous entity lurking in the corner behind her desk, I knew I couldn’t do any of that today. Ignoring the fact that I probably looked strung out, my communication abilities probably not sounding any better at the moment, she didn’t deserve to get wrapped up with me until I fixed myself. I needed to rid myself of this demon before I could dream of starting a relationship with Hazel, or any other amazing girl like her.

I gritted my teeth and stumbled into the wall, holding myself upright with my left arm as my right hand rose to grab my head in a vain attempt to numb the intense pain that had dawned over it.

*“The value of a life cannot be measured,”* the thoughts instilled into my brain rose to prominence over the ringing in my ears. *“But the consequences of a life can be.”*

“Stop…” I audibly responded, my movements weak and my voice weaker.

I hobbled over to the bathroom, almost collapsing into the sink as I turned some cold water on, splashed onto my face in order to snap myself out of this strange delirium. As I had expected, when I looked up into the mirror, the cool water dripping down my face and collecting in my small beard, the entity was looming over me.

*“Time is running out. We don’t know how or why, but we know when. We see outcomes. No decision is a decision in itself.”*

I grunted as I clenched my eyes shut once again, furiously slapping more water onto my face in a rage, trying to force myself from the sickening stupor by battering it out of me.

Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore, shutting off the water and blindly reaching for the paper towels, patting my face down against their rough brown surface.

I almost melted in gratitude when upon looking into the mirror, the entity was gone. I looked horrible; my face was red, my eyes were exhausted, but the *entity was gone*.

I couldn’t help but laugh a few manic, delirious chuckles at my victory. I threw open the bathroom door, thankful that no one had been in there to witness my latest mental breakdown, praying that the entity would leave me alone for a few precious hours.

My parents had asked me if I could pick up my sister on the way home today, as her high school was enroute and ending on a half day, and she had plans to spend the night at a friend’s house nearby.  I needed to have a clear head for driving, especially if my sister was going to be in the car. I’ve always been overly protective of her, and her safety would be my top priority in any scenario.

I did consider calling my parents and telling them I wasn’t feeling well, but after an hour had passed since the entity vanished and I hadn’t seen a trace of it again, I was feeling elated and confident. The lack of its presence almost felt like a ‘high’ sensation now, and I had a strong desire to be around my sister. She acted as my security blanket in public situations, and I was very confident that her company would be calming as I dealt with all of this as well.

I’m very happy to say the journey to pick her up and drop her off went seamlessly.

She was her bubbly self as she hopped in the passenger seat, her small frame and blonde hair bouncing with energy as she excitedly told me about the numerous different threads of drama unfolding at her school. Her attitude was a breath of fresh air, and I was able to shed the nearly unbearable weight of the past few days while talking with her. She put some of her favorite girly pop songs on the radio, and I chastised her for being a little bit too into singing along with them. It was such a simple series of interactions, but it felt incredibly liberating; most importantly, the entity was nowhere to be seen for the entirety of the time she was with me.

The ride ended a little too soon as I arrived at her friend’s house, where she and a couple of other girls would be sleeping over. We said our farewells, and I was left to sit alone in the car, girly pop still blasting on the radio.

My heart sunk in my chest and exhaustion weighed heavily over my being as my eyes were guided to the rearview mirror; sitting in the backseat, was the entity, as stoic and foreboding as ever, even amongst the triumphant-sounding lyrics that sang of breaking up with toxic men playing from my speakers.

We were locked in indirect eye contact for at least a couple of songs, staring at each other through the small rearview mirror for at least a couple songs as I fought against paralysis.

Pushing back against the buzzing in my mind by focusing on the music, I defiantly turned up the volume and took my eyes off of the mirror, beginning my journey home.

I sang along loudly with whatever songs I knew as I raced home, constantly over speed limit, doing everything in my power to ignore the entity and prevent its voice from creeping into my mind again.

I began writing this installment the second I got home; my parents are on a date night, so it's empty save for me. As I said last time, writing seems to be one of the best methods of coping with everything that’s happened recently. The fear doesn’t go away, but I can at least process it, put it into written words, something I’ve always been good at understanding. It took me longer to write this account than the others, as I really had to dig deep in order to properly convey everything that I inwardly experience upon interacting with this entity beyond the boundaries of my imagination.

I haven’t seen it since arriving home, but ever since the sun set, I’ve heard a tapping against my window. The blinds are closed, and each time I hear the sound, I’m reminded of that first night I experienced this uniquely raw terror for the first time. It’s gotten gradually more aggressive, and I can practically feel desperate urgency in the taps now.

I can’t ignore it any longer. I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality, more and more of my mind slipping away with every hour that passes. I haven’t been sleeping well, I haven’t been eating right. I probably failed the exam in one of the only classes I feel truly good at, and I couldn’t even retrieve the ability to say anything to Hazel. This has to stop, or my life will eventually fall apart entirely. To me, that’s practically as scary as dying.

To Anya, to my family, I wrote what I wished to be my last words to you all at the end of the first part of this series of accounts. I truly hope I make it to the other side of all this, but reality needs to be faced at some point, and the reality is I might not live long past opening my blinds and facing the horrors of the unknown.

There’s so much more I want to do in life; I want to become a published author, I want to fall in love.

If nothing else though, I’ll have faced my demons directly.

There are worse ways for a man’s story to end.
