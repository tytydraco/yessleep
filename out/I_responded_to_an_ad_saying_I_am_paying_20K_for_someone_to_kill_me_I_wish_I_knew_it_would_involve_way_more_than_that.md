Now, let me start: I'm 25 and a complete loser. I've no real career prospects, and I also got into drugs and gambling, so, yeah, I'm broke as shit. I've been doing a bunch of shady jobs to get through, but of course they got darker and darker.

The first time I killed someone, I was 22. It was more self-defense, but, hey, that's what they all say, even though the truth is, I was just sorta curious. I mean, everyone that pulls out the self-defense stuff is either a child or a liar. I just really wanted to see what the fuss was about.

I didn't necessarily like it, but it felt more like losing your virginity, but in killing. After that, I tried not to do it again, but fatality struck and I got involved with some shady guys and had to get rid of them. After that, someone offered me this huge sum of money to set a house on fire: 2K.

I had to add more and more to my kill list.

I was browsing the dark web once, and came across this.

***KILLER WANTED. PROFESSIONAL. I AM LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO KILL ME. 20K.***

Now, I know what you're all thinking. Shady. Let me tell you, it wasn't. This was tame compared to the other shit I see on there. Anyway, I figured, it was some poor guy or girl who wanted to end it but didn't have the guts, so they wanted to pay someone else to do it for them. I responded.

*Hi, uh, I can kill you. If you want.*

The reply came instantly. *You can? That's great.*

*Any preferred methods?*

*Anything that does the job.*

We exchanged some details and then the guy gave me an address, said to meet him there. I went with my buddy Matt, just to be sure.

Some shady ass field behind a school. I mean, if this is how the man wants to go.

I hadn't expected him to look like that. Middle aged and he had such a kind face. Looked like he had kids or something. Like a really great guy, in general. I was a bit sad to think he wanted to die. But hey, 20K is 20K.

I had a gun with me.

'So, uh, hi. The money...'

'The money is in the bag.'

'Great. Do you want me to do something with you, after I... um, kill you?'

'No. Just leave me there.'

The guy looked scared, but his eyes were unusually sparkly for someone about to die.

'Are you depressed, or?'

'Nah, just do it.'

'But why?'

'Are you gonna do it or what?'

I lifted the gun, locked and loaded.

'I'm just saying...'

'I don't give a shit about what you're saying.'

I aimed at his head.

'You know, that gun ain't gonna work.'

'The fuck you mean?'

'Go ahead.'

I pulled the trigger. My whole body shook, and my ears started ringing. The guy was down. I approached him and shot him again, just to be sure.

Then, I took the money and left. Easy peasy.

Only it wasn't.

I went home and did my routine: cleaner my gun, put some ramen in the microwave and put on Law&Order. Around midnight, my phone buzzed. I looked at the screen to see a notification from the guy I just murdered.

'Didn't work :///'

'Wym??'

'You gotta do it again. It didn't work'

Someone was definitely messing with me.

'You're not the same person, stop fucking around.'

'I am'

He then called me, and there he was, bullet wound and everything. My first rational thought was 'Ok, but I keep the money.'

'Fuck your money. I don't care, man.'

'What even happened to you?'

The guy sighed, and then spoke very fast, as if he wanted to confess everything.

'I made a deal with this witch once. One of those who deal with demons. Fucking witch, I thought she was joking, I just wanted to get laid, and drunk as I was, I agreed to *sell my soul* to her and her mother-demon. She was some pretty girl at a bar and we'd gotten to chatting. You know, you'd literally say anything to get some. I didn't give a fuck. She promised me she'd get me anything if I gave her full control over me, and I replied, like an idiot, that *I wanted to live forever*. And so I did. I've been alive for 100 years, and at this point I'm just sick of it. She has me going to places and literally running her errands and shit. Whatever she needs, I gotta do it. For eternity.'

That was the most batshit crazy stuff I'd heard, but I just didn't question it. 'All right, looks like it didn't work. Sorry, dude.'

I wanted to hang up, but he said something that changed my mind. 'I'll give you a million dollars to help me undo the ritual.'

'What do you mean?'

'To help me die.'

'But what if you go to hell?'

'Bro, I've been here for a century, I literally don't care. Just send me straight to Satan to play some pool.'

In that moment, those million dollars were smiling up at me, and my eyes were glistening with this new *project*. 'All right, deal.'

So I started reading. Like a damn paralegal. Did research like I never did in college. Went on all the sites, browsed all the books, met with several skeeeetchy people, all with my pal Gary by my side, who just wanted to die. At last, I found this site who required a picture of me and my blood type to enter. I typed in what I wanted and it gave me an answer so specific, that I honestly think I wasn't the only one searching this.

***Did you accidentally sell your soul to this woman?***

The picture shown was one of a young girl, with hollow eyes and a suave smile. 'Yeah, that's her.' said Gary,

I clicked yes.

***Here's how to undo it. Click here.***

I did. 

***Undoing HER rituals.*** 

*Find the victim. A third participant is required.*

'Wait, who's the second?'

'Are you stupid? The aiding demon.'

'There's such thing as an *aiding* demon?'

'Yeah, obviously. You summon it by chanting mayday and cutting your left leg, while reading the ritual. It's like a broker.'

'Allright then.'

*In the next four days, do not leave the house. Since the summoning of the demon, the victim and the third participant are required to always be in the same room. At all costs. After dark of the first day, light a match and stand next to your smallest mirror. That's where you'll see the WITCH. She will attempt to convince you to not break the contract, but you can't listen. On the eve of the fourth day, after you've endured the witch's long and horrific wails, you have to break the mirror and whisper 'Jasper I am, and my friend's freedom I demand'.*

'How did it know my name?'

'Keep reading.'

*The witch will then ask you to pay a price. Don't worry, it's not expensive. She's inexperienced.*

The fuck?

*Then, you should go to sleep. When you wake up, the victim and the demon will be gone. However, you should be careful, because the first thing you see in the morning will turn into your primal fear.*

***THE RITUAL WILL HAVE ENDED! Thanks for reading, pls subscribe.***

So we got to working. Everything went well until the second day, when I felt as if I wanted to rip my ears off. By the third day, it was shit, but the 1M in my bank account gave me power.

Finally came the moment of the price. I knew she'd be after me, but I never thought she'd actually come for me for ruining her business. Anyway, she basically told me that I couldn't be in a room alone for more than 10 minutes, or she'll find a way to take me. Now, I don't know if that's some kind of bullshit, but I never risked. And, by the way, when I woke up in the morning, I was so afraid to open my eyes and turn something into my fear, that I kept them shut.

And the sun shone through my eyelids and I saw the inside of them, red, as you see. Now, I am afraid of the color red.

Overall, 9/10 deal. I'm a millionaire, but at what cost?

Gary, if you're reading this and there's WiFi in hell, I hope you're doing well >:)
