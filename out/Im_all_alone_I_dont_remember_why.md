I don't know what to do. Please. Please. If anyone has any information, any advice, anything they can do at all, help me.

I woke up two weeks ago and something was wrong. I had moved recently, had needed to leave my old job. Something about it was destroying me- so maybe it was irresponsible, but I had to go. I couldn't do it anymore, the long hours, the sleepless nights. At some point... I don't know. I had to move or I would die

So I woke up, to the empty house. I closed the front door (I guess I'd left it open when I moved in?), opened my fridge, ate breakfast, and slowly but surely realized something was wrong. 

I'd gotten to the new house only a day or two ago- but everything was unpacked already. I don't remember having hired a moving truck, and I certainly didn't have time to move everything in myself. I don't remember unpacking anything either, don't remember dragging in this furniture. I don't even have the money to buy new furniture.

I don't even have the money to buy a house, now that I think about it.

I didn't go grocery shopping. I don't drive, so why is there a car outside? I must have driven here, maybe... I have a license, but I could have sworn I'd flown. I can't find any paperwork on it, but maybe it's a rental.

This house is too big for me. There are two- no, three bedrooms. I think one of them is an office? My head hurts really badly, but there's no bruising.

But everything is so... Clean. Not overly clean, not suspiciously, but it's a house people have lived in and maintained. But I try to think about cleaning, try to think about how I arranged the furniture, and....

There's nothing. It's only pain. The only real mess are these weird dark marks on the walls in two of the bedrooms, but I can't even LOOK at those without crying, I don't get it.

The furniture is meant to be... I think it's feng shei? Thinking about that hurts too, but I know it's unbalanced- some of it is unbalanced, and I know this because.

Because.

I don't know what those dark stains are.

A long time ago I think I read this story by Ray Bradbury. I think it was him. Maybe it was something else. And there was a house, and it kept... Existing. It couldn't stop existing. It would just go through motions, because there was something once upon a time it was filled with. It had purpose it had something to serve to exist for but it kept going because something happened to that THING and slowly and surely it burnt out and died and I feel like that's me???? I feel so scared, but what do I fucking say? Do I call the cops and tell them I don't know where I am? I don't know anyone, anymore.

People see me and they look confused. I try to talk to them, but they just... They don't like it. I make them uncomfortable, I think. They can't tell me who lived in that house before me.

I don't know what to do. There's no one for me to turn to. Why isn't there anyone for me to turn to? This isn't right. I came here because I was afraid. I came here because it was safe. Why did I think it was safe? What was here that wasn't there before?

I. Remember these stains. They were in my old apartment, in the room no one used. At the office, in those cubicles next to mine that just sat empty, so no one was around when my bosses would scream at me, tear me into pieces. Why did they hate me? I feel like they tried to push me away on purpose. I think I scared them, maybe. I don't know why, I try my best to be kind and loving, because the world needs it. The world needs it so badly.

... I'm all alone. Please help me. I don't want to be alone anymore. I've always been alone, ever since I was born. There was no one there, it was just pain and misery and my screams echoing silent.

There's never been anyone there for me. It's just always been me, and-

But *someone* taught me about feng shei. But someone did, because they cared about me, knew how scared I was, wanted me to be safe. I would remember if I'd leaned it on my own, I know I would.

But no one's ever cared about me. So I must be wrong. 

I can't sleep. Not anymore. I feel like I'll pass out and I'll wake up and feel even more insane, feel even more isolated. Already, it feels like less and less people walk by my house. I can't believe the neighborhood is this quiet. It feels like the silence grows every day.

Today I found a stain on the sidewalk. I think. I can't think about it. I try to look at it and it's wrong, it's a hole in perception, in the world, something was there something SHOULD have been there but it's not now?

But maybe I'm a hole. Maybe I'm the thing that is wrong, some weird, fucked up section of reality that lives in a home that isn't it's and has a life that isn't it's and shouldn't have even been BORN.

Please help me. I think there's something wrong with me. I really, really would appreciate anything anyone has to say, any words of comfort. Has anyone else noticed these holes? Can anyone talk to me about this? I don't want to be alone. It just feels like the world needs me to be, but I can't live like this for much longer. 

Please. I don't want to be alone anymore. Please. Please help me.

Please.

Update: A few people suggested I go to the hospital. They didn't let me in. I tried explaining to the lady at the desk, but she, like, I don't know, stared at me like I had three heads, or something. She wouldn't admit me. At a certain point she just started... Screaming at me? It was awful. She acted like I stole something, but I just moved here! I'd not been there. She couldn't even explain why she wanted me out when security came- just that I made her uneasy, that I felt off. After a certain point, she just LIED and made up a story about me threatening her!!!

I gave up. I could have told them to check the cameras, I guess. But when I was arguing with her, I swear that just under her chair I saw part of a stain.

I have an awful feeling. I don't want to call the cops. I'm too scared to- what if I call them and they come to the house and decide I did something? What if I did something?

I would never do anything. I know this. This isn't me trying to cover anything up, I swear to God, but I think... I.

A few people mentioned the Ray Bradbury story. There Will Come Soft Rains. That there are shadows of people burned onto a home, marking it forever with the signs of the people who lived in it, who loved it, and it persists eternally in a routine without them until it burns away.

There's something. The shape of people in my life, but there's never been anyone there for me. But nothing makes SENSE. Nobody is born alone! There had to be people there. So where were they! I don't remember them. Why do I remember their absence? I shouldn't be able to remember something that EARLY but for whatever reason I can't forget that I've always been alone.

Oh my god I don't think I had parents. That doesn't make any sense. I had to have had parents. It's not just like. I'm reaching back in my memory, trying to drag something out of it, and no one raised me. No biological, adoptive, foster parents. It's just pain. It's just loneliness.

I can't do this for much longer. Help me. Help me please.
