It wasn’t supposed to be this way.

It wasn’t supposed to end like this.

But my life will never be the same, I am doomed to live this endless cycle of torture because I didn’t listen to my gut.

“No, I swear it’s abandoned,” my friend Jon said across the table.

“There’s no way,” Justin laughed, “A place as big as that has no chance of being left alone.”

“Are you talking about the amusement park?”, I asked.

The local amusement park, Scream Machine, was shut down in the late 90’s. The city wasn’t sure if it was a loss of income, or what, but it was sure abandoned. 

And they left everything.

I passed it on the way home from the store, the tall Ferris wheel looming over our town like a bad omen.

To be honest, it normally creeped me out.

But that night.. my inhibitions were apparently out the window.

“Should we go?”, Jon asked.

“Why would we go?”, I countered, “Exploring that place is for teenagers, we are too old for it.”

“Oh, I guess Tyler is a chicken. He can go home, I’ll go with you Jon!”, Justin snorted, laughing into his beer.

That irked me, and maybe it was a pride thing.

But it was working.

“Okay, IF I agree, what would we even do?”, I ask, putting my empty bottle on the sticky wooden table.

Jon’s eyes sparkled mischievously.

“We have to do it right, we need to do all the games that the kids do. Bloody Mary in the house of mirrors, taking a selfie with the creepy clown on the big sign, and a loop on the Ferris wheel. Whatever else we can do.”, Jon explained, counting out the activities on his fingers.

“Why do you care about doing this?”, I asked, looking between the two of them.

“Because we are old now and never do anything fun, so let’s do something fun while we still can.”, Justin says, shrugging.

I realized that these guys needed this, much more than I did, so I might as well indulge them.

“Alright, let’s go.”, I say.

About twenty minutes later, the 3 of us are walking through the broken gate hanging on by a single bolt.

The theme park in its hay day was a magical place. Filled with rainbow lights, sugar as far as the eye can see, and rides that were just sketchy enough to make your parents second-guess letting you on.

Now, it was dark. A couple random rainbow bulbs still flickered in and out of abandoned attractions, the snack machines had cobwebs and spiders making new homes for themselves while rats scurried along the pavement, looking for anything to eat.

“This place looks like a horror movie..”, I said, narrowly avoiding a rat who scurried past me on a mission.

“I know, isn’t it great?”, Jon said.

We pass by the snack bar and head into the attractions.

“Oh they have a fun mirror, the kind that makes you look weird, let’s get a picture.”, Jon says, walking over.

Me and Justin follow, and we take a group photo in the mirror.

“Perfect, I’m going to post it.”, Jon says, tapping on his phone screen.

I look back at myself in the mirror, seeing my face become a distorted one, when I see the Ferris wheel in the reflection.

I turn over my shoulder and see its dark presence, much closer than I thought it would be.

Something about it, I can’t put my finger on it, it exudes a dark energy. Like an invisible black fog circles it.

“You wanna do the wheel?”, Justin asks.

I shake my head.

“No, and it doesn’t work anyways.”, I tell him.

“Yeah it does,” Justin says, “My aunt worked here when she was a teen and she taught me how to start it up, but she said it’s supposedly haunted. So only at your own risk.”

“How is it haunted?”, I ask.

Justin shrugs.

“I’m not sure, she didn’t know how either. She just said if people got on alone, they came off… different. I asked her what she meant, and she just said she shouldn’t talk about it.”, Justin said, heading towards the wheel.

Jon practically skips after him, and I trudge behind slowly.

The closer I get to the Ferris wheel, the more uneasy I feel.

Justin makes it to the control panel first, and after pressing some buttons and messing with some wires, it flares to life.

Red lights flicker poorly on the lines of the wheel, and the small cabins begin to move slowly.

“Booooom!”, Justin cheers.

“I can’t believe it works!”, Jon exclaims.

I’m staring at the lights, and I feel myself get lost in the flickering. The reds expand, filling my vision until it’s the only thing I can see. Then I feel myself start to panic and I blink my eyes rapidly, willing the red away.

Luckily, when I fully open my eyes again, my vision is back to normal.

“So who’s going on?”, Justin asks, wiggling his eyebrows, “I have to stay here to run it, but one of you two should go.”

I’m waiting for Jon to volunteer, he loves this kind of stuff, but he surprises me.

“Tyler should go.”, he says firmly.

“What?”, Justin and I say in unison.

“Yeah! Plus I’m afraid of heights, so it’s all you.”, he laughs, slapping my back.

“I don’t know…”, I said, glancing at the control panel.

“Hey man, look. We have an emergency shut off here..”, Justin says, showing me.

“Yeah if you get scared, wave your hand out the window and we will get you down asap.”, Jon says.

Justin brings the wheel to a stop, just as a cabin approaches the loading point.

Cabin 3.

“Alright, whatever.”, I say, stepping onto the platform.

Justin shuts the door from the outside, and through the grate window Jon reminds me to make friends with any ghosts I see.

Great.

Justin hits a few buttons, and the wheel starts to move again.

It’s slow, and has the normal creaking of any Ferris wheel I’ve been on before, but I shockingly feel very safe.

I lean back on the bench and cross my arms. I peer out the window onto the ground and see Justin and Jon looking up at me as I get higher and higher.

“I can’t believe I let them talk me into this.”, I mumble outloud.

I’m rising to the highest point of the wheel, when I look out onto the city. It’s not a bad view.

No ghosts, but sure is a pretty sight.

I’m just starting to feel appreciative for the push to get on, when the worst thing that could ever happen, happens.

The wheel stops.

It stops abruptly, so quick that the cabin swings back and forth a bit, making me steady myself on the bench.

“I swear if they are messing with me..”, I say outloud.

I look down through the window, and see Justin focused on the board with Jon looking over his shoulder with a concerned face.

“Hey guys!”, I yell, waving my hand.

“It stopped!”, Justin yells, “We will fix it! Just give me a sec!”

“We’ll get you down, buddy! Just relax!”, Jon yells too, and I see him pull out his phone.

With my luck, they are googling “How to fix haunted Ferris wheel”.

I sigh, and return to my crossed-arm position on the bench.

I lean my head back, and close my eyes.

I’m not panicking, for some reason.

I know I’ll get down.

It’s quiet for a few minutes, and I think I may have dozed off, because when I open my eyes, I’m not in the Ferris wheel.

I’m in my apartment.

I’m wearing the same clothes, but I’m standing in my hallway.

I take out my phone, and it’s dead, won’t turn on at all.

I slide it back into my pocket.

What happened?

I tell myself I need to call Jon and Justin, to ask what the hell happened, but I feel nauseous.

I start hearing a whistling sound. It’s like one of those old circus songs from kids movies, and someone in the hallway must be whistling to themselves.

I shake my head, how much did I drink?

The nausea comes back again in a big wave.

I rush to my bathroom, and turn on the sink to put cold water on my face.

When I’m done, I look at myself in the mirror.

And I gasp.

There is a man behind me.

He’s easily over 6 feet tall, maybe even 7 feet.

He’s wearing a black suit, with a black hat.

And his face.. is strange.

It’s plain in a way where he is easily recognizable, but I can’t place him.

He’s just standing over my shoulder in the mirror, and we both watch each other. I feel my breathing become shaky, but I don’t move.

After what feels like hours, he opens his mouth, and his guttural voice says 4 words.

“I’ll see you soon.”

He then places a cold hand on my shoulder, so cold that I can feel it through my T-shirt.

My heart starts beating so fast, it’s like it’s trying to break out of my chest. I squeeze my eyes closed and take a long breath in.

When I open my eyes, I’m moving slowly.

I’m back on the Ferris wheel.

I am breathing heavily, and looking around the cabin for the man in the hat.

But I am still alone.

I hear whoops and hollers from down below, as I slowly make my descent.

Once the carriage hits the ground, I’m practically banging on the door to be let out.

Justin quickly unclamps the door as I fall out of it, almost hyperventilating.

“Woah! Are you okay? Tyler?”, Jon gets down on the ground and puts his hand on my back.

“How long did you leave me up there? Were you pranking me? It wasn’t funny!”, I’m yelling now, and Justin and Jon’s faces turn white.

They look at each other and then back to me.

“Tyler, you were stuck for like.. 2 minutes..”, Jon says slowly.

“No!”, I yell, “You left me up there for at least half an hour!”

Justin shakes his head.

“No, Ty. We promise, it was quick. Did something happen?”, he asked.

I shake my head, and look back at the wheel.

It’s just standing there, mocking me.

“I.. I don’t know.. Maybe I fell asleep.. I had a horrible dream..”, I stammer.

I tell them what happened in the dream, about the man in the mirror. They were silent the whole time.

“I’m sorry I yelled at you guys.. I just.. Got freaked out.. I guess..”, I mumble.

“Tyler, I’m not trying to freak you out anymore,”, Justin says, “But my aunt told me about this look people got on their face when they got off the wheel, I always thought she was just messing with me, but your face looks like that.”

“Do you think the dream meant something?”, Jon asks.

I’m quiet for a moment, going through the dream again in my head.

“I don’t know.. What if that man wants to hurt me?”, I whisper.

“No, no I’m sure it’s not that!”, Jon exclaims.

“Maybe it is.”, Justin says, turning off the wheel.

“Why would you say that?”, Jon asks sharply.

“I don’t know.. My aunt said no one ever came back to ride the wheel solo again, like, she literally never saw them again. What if this is why?”, Justin asks, looking at both of us.

“I’m sure it’s just a coincidence that she never saw anyone again.. but let’s assume this is true.. where were you in your dream?”, Jon asks me.

“I was at home, looking in my bathroom mirror.” I tell them.

“Then.. Maybe don’t look in that mirror for a while?”, Jon asks.

“Yeah.. Maybe.. Look guys I’m kind of done with this, can we leave?”, I ask.

“Of course.”, Justin says.

“Yeah, I’ll drive you home.”, Jon tells me.

I shoot him a look.

“I mean, you can stay with me tonight.”, he corrects.

As we walk through the broken gate, I look back at the Ferris wheel, and a single red bulb flickers back at me.

*

I avoid the mirror not only the next day, but indefinitely.

I get to the point where I can hardly even enter the room, and I’ve covered the mirror with a towel.

Nightmares of the man in the hat haunt me every night, and I wake up gasping every time.

I list my apartment for sale, but no one is interested.

I start working in-person, instead of remotely. I can’t be at my place longer than I have to.

And for the first few days, it works.

I am barely home, avoid mirrors altogether, and I feel like I’m doing the right thing.

But one day, as I’m walking to work, I cross a busy street and I see something.

I have to squint, because he’s far away.

But the man in the hat is standing far down the street.

Not moving, not emoting, just.. staring.

At me.

I feel my blood pressure start to rise, and I rub my eyes, before looking back. Hoping it was my eyes playing tricks on me.

But he’s still there.

I put my head down, and quickly walk into my office building.

He’s gone when I leave work.

Over the next several weeks, I see the man everywhere.

He’s at the grocery store, at the far other end at the aisle. Not shopping, just facing me, and staring.

Slowly he’s getting closer and closer to me.

I walk to my local bodega, and he’s under a streetlight about half a block away.

He doesn’t say anything, but he starts to whistle. He whistles that familiar circus song I hear in my dreams.

“What do you want from me?”, I yell out.

He doesn’t respond, and he doesn’t move.

I’m angry now, and I storm up to him, but once I get within 10 feet, he vanishes.

He becomes the only consistent thing in my life, I’ve given up dating altogether because he was always over their shoulder in the restaurant.

He consumes my life.

Justin and Jon call to check in, but eventually I stop responding. Talking to them reminds me of that night, and I can’t help but blame them for encouraging me to ride the wheel.

I turn into a shell of myself, I let that night consume me.

Months go by, and the few times I am at home, I am on high alert for his face.

But he never comes closer than the sidewalk outside.

What is he waiting for?

After 8 months, I can’t take it anymore.

I need to end this.

I need to go back to where it started.

It’s midnight, when I cross the familiar broken gates of the Scream Machine, and I head straight for the Ferris wheel.

I watched about a dozen videos online about how to turn one of these on, because I couldn’t bring myself to ask Justin or Jon for help.

But this will work, this will fix me and then I can be my old self again.

The wheel flares to life, as if welcoming me back. 

The carriage stops, I step inside, and close the door. 

Cabin 3 is painted on the inside door.

I’ll have to hold it closed, but I just need one round. I set the wheel on a timed stop, so it should release me once I do a lap.

The carriage is so familiar, and I lean back on the bench, closing my eyes, with one arm on the door.

I wait, and nothing happens for a second.

Then I open my eyes quickly, and I’m back in my apartment. The same clothes, the same position.

I try to pull out my phone, and it’s still dead.

Okay, I’m back here.

I know what to do.

I start to walk towards the bathroom again, instinctively. But when my hand reaches towards the door, I stop myself.

I freeze outside the door, and after a moment or two, I go to my couch and sit down.

And I will stay here, until I wake up.

I won’t invite the man into my life.

The whistling begins in the hallway.

I hear footsteps in the bathroom, sounding like pacing.

But I sit still, and place my hands over my ears.

I hear a man whispering my name.

“Tyler… Tyler…”, it coos.

But I stay where I am, keeping my eyes closed.

The bathroom door then begins to creek open, and my stomach lurches.

I’m shaking violently, as it opens all the way, and I hear a single footstep.

I open one eye, and can see the toe of a shiny black shoe, crossing into the living room. I close my eyes again as I begin to whimper.

The footsteps stop.

It’s silent for a few moments.

When I open my eyes, I’m back at the drop off point of the Ferris wheel.
 
I’m breathing heavily, but I feel relieved.

I didn’t see his face.

I didn’t acknowledge him, I didn’t let him in.

I did it, I changed my fate.

That won’t be my ending.

I climb out of the Ferris wheel, and unplug the whole machine. I then take a piece of metal discarded next to it and smash the control panel with all my strength.

This will never hurt anyone else again.

I’m walking home with a newfound skip in my step, I feel lighter, I feel happy.

When I get home, I get an email from my real estate agent that my place has an offer. And she can get me out asap.

I breathe a sigh of relief.

I move across town, into my new place.

On my move-in day, I place the last box on the ground and smile at the new living room.

I have a fresh start, finally.

But I miss my friends.

I should text Jon and Justin, ask them to get a drink tomorrow.

I take out my phone, and notice it’s dead.

Hm. Must have forgotten to charge it.

I shrug, and slide it back into my pocket.

I pick up a box of toiletries, and bring them into the bathroom.

I open the medicine cabinet, and put my things away, humming to myself.

And when I close the mirror, I scream.

There is no man in a hat, but there’s a message written in dripping, black ink on the mirror.

“You can never stop the wheel.”

I feel my whole world come crashing down, as I drop the box I was holding and fall to the floor.

I’m shaking, with my hands covering my eyes, when I hear it.

A faint whistling from right outside my front door.
