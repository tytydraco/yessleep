The rattling sensation of turbulence jolted me from the uneasy slumber I had drifted into. I sighed and gazed out at the pitch blackness outside my window, barely visible droplets of rain splattering against the glass. The clock read 2 AM, only five hours left on the overnight flight from London to New York. 

“This is your captain speaking, I am terribly sorry but we are experiencing some mild turbulence due to the storm, please fasten your safety belts.”

The crystal-clear voice rang out through the cabin, followed by the response of the few dozen passengers shuffling to clip the seatbelt across their laps. I always hated traveling for work, but the bonus for doing overseas consulting was always tantalizing enough to keep me coming back for more, despite the horrendous flights the company selected. As much as I despised the overnight flights, it was nice how empty it was, more than half of the seats on the plane were empty, making the whole experience slightly less claustrophobic. 

I reached down and grabbed the now cold cup of coffee that had been served an hour prior, but before I could take a sip, the turbulence once again flung the plane into a sudden violent shake, splattering coffee all over my shirt and pants. 

“Oh, fuck me,” I reflexively exclaimed, immediately apologizing when all the passengers in the adjacent seat turned to glare.

I attempted to stand and run to the small restroom at the front but was physically reminded of the belt fastened tightly across my gut. I muttered more unmentionable words as I tried to mop up the spilled drink with the sleeve of my jacket when another announcement came over the intercom.

“This is your captain speaking, apologies for the severe turbulence, I was stabbing our copilot,” The voice said with the same calm, polite cheerfulness of all the other announcements, “Nothing to worry about, he is dead now.”

After the crackle of the speakers overhead died out, the whole cabin fell into a shocked silence. I felt almost compelled to laugh at the sheer absurdity of the statement, if it weren't for the dead silence permeating the rows of seats. The young man in front of me turned around in his seat, looking at me with confused eyes, mouthing the same question that I immediately asked. 

“What the hell?”

A few of the passengers began to laugh uncomfortably, trying to shake off the slow creep of dread that flooded our veins. I leaned out of my seat, looking at the metal door that separated our cabin from the cockpit. As I did so, an attendant briskly walked over to the cockpit door, knocking on it frantically. I was struggling to fight back the horror that was taking over my mind, as the attendant was now tugging on the door handle with no luck. 

“So, what is this some sort of joke?” The man in front of me asked, his voice trembling with apprehension.

“If it is, it’s not funny,” Someone responded from down the aisle.

Near the front of the cabin, I could hear the flight attendant getting into a heated argument with a passenger who was attempting to get out of her seat. Throughout the plane, passengers were conversing in a low murmur, which was immediately silenced when the PA system overhead crackled to life yet again. 

“This is your captain speaking, there are currently 43 people alive on this plane, let’s try and get that down to 40,” The voice paused for a second, sounding almost giddy as he continued, “40 is a nice even number, so you have 40 minutes to do this before I attempt to land in the Atlantic.”

Instantly, the plane erupted into panic. Passengers began shouting at one another, unbuckling their restraints to stand up. Some simply sat in silence, staring at the seat in front of them in shock. A swarm of people, including the young woman who had been arguing with the attendant rushed to the door of the cockpit, pounding on it and ripping at the latch. 

The cockpit door remained stubbornly shut, the passengers a frenzied mob pounding at it relentlessly. Reluctantly, a sense of responsibility washed over me. I was always quiet, I never liked getting involved if I didn’t need to. I felt paralyzed by fear at the possibility that these normal, average people may begin killing each other over this. I couldn't stand by and do nothing while we hurtled towards a watery grave. With a deep breath, I pushed through the crowd, my voice barely audible over the din. 

"Listen to me!" I shouted; my words were drowned out by the cacophony. 

"We need to work together, or we're all going to die,” I yelled, finding confidence despite the sinking dread that was rising up my throat, “We need to find some way to get into the cockpit, I don’t think that door is going to budge.”

It seemed that the chaos in the plane began to subside, most of the passengers began to wander aimlessly through the aisles looking around as if there was something that had been missed. The majority simply sat back down in their seats, seemingly resigned to their fate, or in absolute denial. Despite this, two figures stood by the cockpit door, looking at me expectantly. 

The first was a tall man, balding in a rather unflattering way, with the look of a middle-aged dad with his tucked polo shirt and jeans. Next to him was a similarly old woman, with wispy dark hair that seemed to be turning gray by the second. They both stared at me in silence, clearly hoping that by speaking up I was indicating that I had a more cohesive plan than banging on the same door for the last 40 minutes of our lives.

“Uh, my name is Ethan, nice to meet you,” the older man said hesitantly extending a hand to shake. “And this is my wife, Ava.”

It took me a few seconds to remember my own name as I shook his hand, still grappling with the fact that someone was looking to me for answers for once.

“I’m Luke, so do either of you have any idea what’s going on?” I said, averting my gaze from the subtle disappointment in their eyes.

“Can’t say I do, maybe it’s some sort of emergency drill, like a test?”

Ethan muttered this with a terrified expression, clearly some part of him still in denial over what was occurring around him. I looked around, realizing that the whole crowd of terrified faces was turned towards me. Nobody seemed particularly hopeful for our chances, but they seemed morbidly curious about what this idiot would say next.

“Did anyone see where the attendant went?” I asked, voice quivering with the sudden shock of performing for an audience of hapless people.

Quiet murmurs erupted through the cabin, and some men got up and renewed their pacing, now with a mission to search the confined space we were trapped in. I glanced over at the young woman who had been arguing with the flight attendant when the first announcements came overhead, but she was staring at the floor with a blank expression. 

Ava and Ethan stared at me trying to comprehend how this was relevant to our situation. 

“Why are we looking for her?” Ethan asked, the shock of the whole situation clouding his rational mind.

“I just think she may have a better idea of what’s going on, hopefully, she may even know the way into the cockpit so we can get in touch with help on the ground.” 

As I said this, I began to realize how pointless it all seemed. Even if we made our way to the pilot, then what? According to him, he had already stabbed one man to death, and clearly intended on taking us down with him. Even if we overpowered an armed man, would we even be able to safely land this thing? These fears and doubts swirled through my head like the turbulent winds outside, when a voice rang out.

“Hey, the bathroom door is locked!”

Instantly, all eyes turned to the athletic-looking guy who had begun pacing and was now standing in front of the bathroom door, furiously trying to pull it off the hinges. Ethan and I walked over purposefully, looking at the faint yellow glow that emanated from beneath the narrow, closet-like room.

“Anybody in there?” Ethan asked while knocking.

Through the crack in the door, I could faintly see a shadow move, as if someone standing in the small restroom was pressing up against the door, listening. Suddenly, the door rattled from the other side. All three of us sprang backward in surprise. The door shook repeatedly, as if someone was punching against it trying to get out. I shuddered at unimaginable pictures of what was going on just a few feet away from me. Then the screams began. 

“Please no, I’m sorry please just- “

The cries, desperate and filled with pain and fear, ended as quickly as they started. As I quietly began to approach the door, a slow trickle of blood began to seep out from underneath the frame. I felt dizzy with newfound horror and disgust as it touched the edge of my foot, dying my bright white sneakers a sickly pink. Then, with a brief glance at one another, Ethan and I began to ram our shoulders into the door, using our weight to break it down. 

Unlike the cockpit, this door gave way easily, I nearly slipped on the warm, sticky puddle of blood blossoming under my feet as we burst into the tiny room. Sitting on the toilet, posed in a very unceremonious fashion, was the body of the flight attendant. The blood was still trickling from the two deep gashes, one across each wrist. Her eyes stared blankly at the fluorescent lights, her mouth agape in the terror of her final moments.  I felt nauseous as I looked down at the crimson-stained floor of the compartment, and the blood-soaked set of keys in the middle of the pool. I gagged as I lifted the keys, trying to ignore the bits of skin and cloth that clung to the serrated edges of the brass. 

“Do you think one of those opens the cockpit door?” Ethan asked while trying not to look at the body of the young woman just feet away. 

I opened my mouth to respond when I was cut off by an all too familiar chime that preceded an announcement over the intercom.

“I would like to take a moment to remind the passengers that 35 minutes remain, and we still have 42 people aboard,” the voice seemed to pause, like an excited middle-schooler about to say the punchline to a dirty joke he just learned, “Since I understand this can be a big decision, I have decided that the passenger in seat C13 should be the next to die.”

The cabin erupted once more into chaos, as the mother of the small, frightened-looking boy in C13 began to scream wildly, standing defensively over her son. Fortunately for the moment, most of the passengers remained in their seats as they were before, but the atmosphere of the group changed subtly. It was one thing to think that we would all die together, or that we all had an equal chance of dying. But the idea that a specific, individual could die, and this whole nightmare would end, appealed to the darkest corner of everyone’s mind. Morality, ethics, and all the social norms that keep us sane can only withstand so much pressure before survival instinct takes over. Despite my terror, I tried to focus on the task at hand.

“We need to get in there, now,” I said with more resolve than I knew I had.

Ethan nodded grimly, and the two of us along with the young man who helped find the attendant, marched down the aisle towards the door. As we approached, Ava stood by the cockpit door, surveying the cabin with a puzzled look. 

“Ethan,” She whispered, keeping her eyes fixed on the rest of the uneasy group.

“There was only one person in the bathroom, right?” She muttered into his ear, just loud enough for me to hear. 

“Yeah, I think she killed herself to escape this.”

I was frantically looking through the keys as they spoke, trying desperately to find one that fits in the hole in the cockpit. I wasn’t sure what my plan was, but I knew the first step would be to confront the madman at the helm of this doomed plane. As the key slid into the lock and clicked in satisfying confirmation that I had found a match, I barely heard Ava’s trembling voice, and what she said turned my blood to ice.

“If she killed herself, why was she pounding on the door for help?”

As my shock turned to horror at what she just said, I threw the door to the cockpit open and was immediately met with a blast of cold air ripping past me. In the brief glimpse I got before the pressure change from the shattered windscreen sucked the door shut again, I saw a picture of absolute terror. A corpse wearing the airline’s uniform sat in the co-pilot’s chair, a sheen of frozen blood covering the once classy coat. The controls of the craft itself were in shambles, wires ripped apart, screens shattered and flickering, not one piece seemed untouched. And worst of all, was the windshield.

It was shattered outwards, dozens of hand-sized circular holes leading to one much larger one in the center. Every surface appeared to have been smashed to bits by some overwhelming force as if some rampaging monster tore its way out of the plane’s front. But worse than the horror scene that I did see, was the absence of what I was looking for. The pilot was nowhere to be seen. 

As the door slammed shut, and the oxygen masks dropped from the cabin’s ceiling, the unmistakable shrill tone rang out again, as the intercom system sprang to life with another announcement.
