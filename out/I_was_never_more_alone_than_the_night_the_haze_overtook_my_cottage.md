I let out a quiet sigh as I stared out across the water. It had been a beautiful sunny day, not a cloud in the sky, but a haze was hanging over the lake. Smoke from the wildfires a few provinces over had become a fact of life this summer, obscuring the opposing shoreline even on supposedly clear days like today.

As I took down the final sip of my beer, I tried not to let the existential dread of this new reality wash over me. The beautiful colours streaking out from behind the setting sun distracted me from the subtle smell of burning wood. I took a deep breath, rose from my chair on the shoreline, and turned to make my way across the road to my family’s cottage.

I had spent the last day and a half alone with my cat Felix, but I had ended up finding the solitude rather peaceful. It was an excellent way to truly disconnect from the world and de-stress from the hustle and bustle of my city life back home. I climbed the steps to my porch, recovered the spare key, and unlocked the door to my now fully-activated, and vocally hungry, cat.

Felix immediately began prowling, barely letting me return the spare key to its hiding spot before he was loudly meowing and rubbing himself against my legs to demand food. Before the little gremlin could trip me with his insistence, I poured him a bowl of kibble and set it down. The loud feline objections were quickly replaced with the sound of kibble being inhaled with little chewing. I gave him a little pet on his shoulder blades before turning my attention to my own meal.

I love to try new recipes, and tonight was no different. Sometimes it can be a challenge finding one that speaks to me, but this one had jumped off the page when I read it. Chicken, pasta, a few new spices, it was an easy sell. I turned on a Netflix documentary and got to work.

The meal was fairly simple to make, and ended up tasting great. I spent the rest of the evening sprawled out on the couch enjoying some post-meal cuddles from my now satiated cat, while slowly being scared off of ever going on a cruise ship by Netflix. As the credits rolled, I reached into my pajama pockets and felt my lighter. I grabbed the pack of joints off of the glass kitchen table that was adorned by my late Nana’s favourite flower vase, and walked over to the front door. Felix sprang up, loudly meowing to be let out onto the porch. “Not now little guy, it’s too late for that.” He grumbled angrily as I pushed him back with my foot before opening the door.

Stepping out onto the porch, my nostrils were immediately assaulted by the smell. I looked out and remarked at how the haze appeared to have thickened, with the cottages across the road barely visible. As the unlit joint hung between my lips, I checked the weather app on my phone. The air quality still read 2, as it had all day… and usually the nights offered relief. I shook my head, wondering how Environment Canada could be so wrong about it. There was no way this was a 2, it had to be nearing 8 or 9. Each inhale carried a palpable odor, far worse than it had been earlier in the day.

I looked out at the haze, which was being illuminated by the moon- now a prominent fixture in the night sky. There was something about the smell that was off. It was a thick stench of burning wood, but there was more to it tonight. The smell was a touch sulfurous, with faint hints of cooked meat. The hair on my neck stood on end, and I felt a chill run down my spine. I decided against smoking my joint, and retreated inside.

There wasn’t much I could do except wait out the smog, so with the hour getting so late I popped a melatonin and started to brush my teeth and get ready for bed. Felix, ever the loyal cat once properly fed, happily climbed into bed with me. With him snuggled into my side, I slowly drifted to sleep.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*“Wake up sleepyhead.”*

I snapped awake, jolting upright in my bed. An older woman’s voice had pierced the dead of the night and violently snapped me out of a very deep sleep. My heart pounded in my chest as I took a few deep breaths. I’d had times where I hallucinated sounds before, and some of those experiences had been positively terrifying, but it usually only happened when I was struggling to fall back asleep. Was it a part of my dream? Perhaps.

I reached for my phone on my bedside table. 3:06am, right in the middle of-

My thought about the time was interrupted by the top of my screen. No signal. No Wi-Fi. My phone wasn’t charging, despite being plugged in. I looked up at the ceiling fan in the main room, where it sat as still as the night itself. The power was off.

My eyes drifted down from the ceiling to the floor in my bedroom doorway, where Felix was sitting upright and still, staring out towards the living room.

“Come here Feels,” I patted my hand on my bed. His ears didn’t even turn back to me, they stayed perfectly forward, following his gaze. I tried coaxing him one more time by clicking my tongue on the roof my mouth, but again he remained still.

Between the auditory hallucination jolting me awake, the lack of cell service, and now my cat’s odd behaviour, I started to get a little freaked out. I swung my legs off the side of my bed, pulling on my pajamas. I walked up behind Felix, now able to follow his gaze to the living room window.

When I stepped past him, Felix nearly jumped out of his skin. He locked eyes with me, his pupils the size of saucers, then his attention snapped right back to the window. The curtain was closed, and with barely any light outside it was hard to make anything out about what he was looking at, but curiosity got the better of me.

I gulped and slowly walked across the room towards the window. The hairs on the back of my neck stood at attention once more. My stomach turned into knots as I stepped around the kitchen table. I reached out at the edge of the curtain, and took a deep breath. Before I could talk myself out of it, I yanked the curtain to the side.

A man was standing about a foot away from the window. I screamed, stumbling backward onto the couch before I registered who it was in the moonlight outside.

“Dad, what the fuck are you doing?” I hissed, angry about how scared I had been.

He looked at me, and I struggled to read what emotion was on his face. “I’m… out… walking… Baxter!” His voice sounded normal, but the delivery was almost William Shatner-esque. I couldn’t understand why, but there was something deeply unsettling about it.

I looked at his hands. There was no leash, and no signs of his dog anywhere. “Where is Baxter, Dad?”

My father’s head tilted. His expression still giving off no recognizable emotion one way or the other. “Can you help me… look… for him.”

The haze behind my father had grown so thick throughout the night that I noticed I now couldn’t see the road. I could see my car behind him, however. Just my car. “Dad, where’s your car? Where’s mom?”

His head rotated in a semi-circle to the other side, as if doing a neck stretch before baseball. “Your mother… dropped… me… off.”

I realized what was unsettling about his voice. It wasn’t just the delivery. It reminded me of those meme videos people make that take politicians out of context to sing or rap pop songs. That’s what was bothering me. It sounded spliced together, like the words didn’t belong to the sentence they were in.

My mind started racing. This isn’t my father. But… that’s crazy. It *is* my father. Am I hallucinating? I thought about how strange Felix was acting, but I didn’t dare turn around to check on him. I didn’t dare take my eyes off of my father.

Eventually he broke the silence. “Can you… let me in.”

I couldn’t be certain what was going on, but I did know one thing: there was no fucking way I was letting this man inside. I locked eyes with him. Before I could speak, his hazel eyes turned yellow. I felt a pain in my head. My thoughts turned to the window in front of me, as if guided there. It could simply be pulled open. Even from the outside. He reached for the edge of the window, and I lunged forward and held it closed as tight as I possibly could.

The strength I could feel as it slowly forced the latch open revealed the horrifying inevitability. I was not winning this. With one hand this… creature is overpowering me.

*“Honey, can you set the table?”*

I snapped left towards the kitchen where the older woman’s voice had just come from. I glanced at the kitchen table. A few dishes lay drying across it, as did a box of Winsor salt. I didn’t have time to think. I don’t know if it was seeing it done in a movie, or reading about it in a short story, but instinctively I reached for the box with my left hand as my right hand desperately tried to keep the window shut.

I grabbed the box, but toppled the table in the process, shattering its glass top on the floor. My hand was bloodied, but I managed to quickly recover. It took every bit of salt the box had to do it, but I poured it in a semicircle on the floor in the front of window, just as it started sliding open.

I crawled backwards away from the window, unsure if the salt would work or not. The creature leaned forward, almost breaking the threshold of the window, but looking down at the barrier I had made on the floor. The stench of outside wafted in, but the creature remained still.

It looked at me with its yellow eyes as it let out a slow exhale, the facade of my father’s face beginning to droop as if the glue holding it on had started to weaken. When it inhaled, its eyes closed briefly. It looked at my bloody hand, and its mouth hung open. It stared for a brief few moments, its jaw extending and mouth opening far further than anything natural. It turned slowly to its right, and started walking around the cottage to the porch.

I started to panic. The screen door isn’t latched. It’s going to walk right into the porch.

Its steps rounded the corner.

There’s no more salt. I used it all. What the fuck did I have to fight it with? A knife?

The sound of creaking wood. It was climbing the front steps.

I could run for it. Out the window. My eyes looked out at the unnatural haze blanketing the property.

It opened the screen door, and I watched in horror as its face appeared in the window pane of the front door. The door handle jiggled, but did not give in. I felt its eyes peering at me. My thoughts were brought to the door. It’s locked from the inside. As long as it doesn’t find the spare key- it turned around.

I got up to run.

*“Dinner time!”*

The older woman’s voice came from behind me once more. Dinner time? Was she mocking me? I don’t… the spices. I heard it find the key as I bolted over to the kitchen counter. I grabbed a plate from the drying rack, and the small Farm Boy baggie of powdered sage.

As the creature fumbled with the key in the lock, I poured the baggie onto the plate, and pulled my lighter out from my pocket. The lighter failed to spark. The key slid into the lock. The lighter sparked, and I held it to the sage, igniting it.

The door swung open as the smoke quickly filled the room. I’ll never forget the noise that the creature made when the smoke reached its face. It let out what I can only assume was a wail stitched together from a thousand different screams. Its agony expressed with the suffering of those who weren’t as lucky as I was. It stumbled back, shouldering its way out the screen door and falling down the stairs and onto the grass.

Another spliced together wail. It rose to its feet and hobbled off, disappearing into the haze.

I collapsed on the floor. I looked at the burnt plate in front of me, the open door, the shattered table, and the line of salt sitting in front of the open window. The haze outside was already lifting, and I could faintly see the road again.

I started to process the night. What it meant. I thought of the older woman’s voice that had guided me throughout it, and I felt a lump in my throat when the realization hit me.

“Thanks Nana.”
