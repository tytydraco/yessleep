Yeah, this is going to sound pretty damn crazy, I don’t expect you to believe me, just stick with it. BUT there is something else living in my house and it is NOT human. 

We moved into a new housing estate just outside a small city in the UK. The first few nights were fine, we unpacked, redecorated, got settled.

Then the weird stuff started.

 We would be watching TV in the living room and hear a crash from the kitchen. I would run in to find a plate smashed all over the floor. Every time I shrugged it off, it must have been on the edge of the table, it just fell off the drying rack. All of my conclusions were rational

The next night, it was a cup, then a fork. Sometimes we wouldn’t even hear it. It would just be laying on the floor when me or my girlfriend got home from work. 

She was getting freaked out by all of this and was going to stay with her parents for a couple of nights. I just said she was being silly, there must have been a rational explanation, right? 

Yeah, that didn’t really go too well for me…

 I stayed in the house and began to hear other things, like the doors upstairs opening and slamming shut. I had dismissed a lot of the things over the last week, but the other night? That had me locked in my bedroom, wide awake till morning. 

That night, I did my usual checks, doors locked, windows shut, everything switched off.  As I turned off the last light in the hallway, I had the fight or flight feeling. 
The same one I’ve had since I was a kid.
That urge to bolt up the stairs like something’s chasing me.

Halfway up the stairs I heard another set of fast paced footsteps from behind me. 
My skin went prickly.
 I repeated to myself, it’s all in your head, it’s all in your head. 
Then I did something I would never do.
I looked back.

Something was moving, all I could see were eyes reflecting off the upstairs light. 
They were wide and bloodshot. 
I couldn’t see anything else just a dark figure, and those cursed eyes. 

I shouted out. 

“What the hell?! Shit! Shit!’ 

I stumbled to the top step and then, silence. 

The whole house quiet. 

I rushed into the bedroom, turned the light on and put the TV up to full volume. 

That’s where I stayed, freaked out and on edge. 
Once it was light outside, it made the house feel a lot less threatening.

 I went downstairs. The cupboards were all open so was the fridge… and oven. 

This was too much, I wasn’t going to stay here alone again.

I called my brother Dan to see if he wanted to stay here for a few nights. I didn’t say my reasons because It would have sounded like I was scared. He said it would be a good idea and we could get some drinks in. 

Last night we had a good evening playing the PlayStation and drinking beers. Only hearing the odd bump or creak. We were getting pretty drunk by the time we decided to call it a night. I then told him what had happened the night before. 
He laughed at me, and called me a pussy. 
I laughed it off. 

He headed into the spare room I had made up earlier. I went up after, I had that same urge to run, but I didn’t. I walked, all the way to the top. Nothing happened. Was it in my head?

About 3 AM, I was woken up by a large bang downstairs. 

Someone then started to call my name, it was my girlfriend. 

What was she doing here?

 She hadn’t come upstairs, which was weird.
I text her: ‘Are you coming to bed? Be quiet, Dan’s asleep in the spare room x’

She texted back: ‘What are you talking about, I’m at my parents?’

She had to be messing with me, she knew how paranoid I’d been lately.

I sat up in bed, frozen, just listening. The voice, her voice, called out again. It was clearer this time.

“Babe?” She was almost laughing.

I got up, quietly. 
I didn’t want to wake Dan, or get him involved. I stepped into the hallway, the floor was ice cold under my feet, every creak of the boards echoed in the silence.

I peered down the staircase. The hallway light was still off. It was pitch black down there. 
But I thought I saw…movement.

I leaned my head out. Just enough. Squinting in concentration, holding my breath.

Then the darkness shifted. I didn’t hear anything move, but I knew it had.

A face, or something was now just barely visible. Right at the bottom of the stairs. 
Watching me. Still. Silent.

It tilted, just a fraction. Like it was curious, or amused.

I pointed my phone straight down the stairs and took a photo. The flash illuminated the staircase. I saw the two bloodshot eyes glisten from the bottom.
Then it launched up towards me. 

I sprinted into my bedroom and slammed the door shut, locking it tight. The banging started immediately, like fists slamming against the wood. The handle rattled violently.
Then…it stopped.
No footsteps. No noise. Just silence.

I sat exhausted on the bed, my heart pounding. 

Two knocks on the door then broke the silence. 

“Babe? Are you going to let me in?”

I shouted back “Leave me alone! You’re not her!”

The voice calmly answered back “What’s wrong babe? Just let me in the bedroom, please.”

“Just go away!” I yelled out.

I’d had enough, I grabbed my phone and called my girlfriend. 

She answered after the second time of trying.

“Hello, hello? Where are you?” I asked her.

She sounded half asleep in her response, “At my parents, you know this, I was asleep.”

“Shit.” I whispered through clenched teeth.

“What’s the matter with you? You sound out of breath?” She asked now with more alertness.

“Don’t worry, I will come over in the morning and explain, sorry for waking you up”.

I didn’t want to worry her, even I thought I was going crazy, didn’t want to drag her into it. 

She sighed. “Okay, can I go back to sleep now?”

I hung up the phone. 

I just couldn’t process any of this. 

Slow footsteps then walked away from my door, and down the stairs. 

I stayed in my bedroom, wide awake again, until the sun glared through my curtains. 

This morning, everything felt…strange. I hadn’t slept. I unlocked the door and went over to the spare room where Dan was staying. I knocked on the door.

“You up, mate?” I whispered.

No answer.

“Mate?” I said slightly louder while I pushed the door open.

The bed was neatly made. Untouched.

The room was exactly how I’d left it before he arrived.  

Duvet still tucked in. 
Pillow still smooth.
His night bag? Gone.

I stood there, frozen. Just thinking, what the hell’s going on?

I checked the bathroom, then every room in the house. Nothing. No jacket. No shoes. No sign he’d even been here.

Maybe he’d left in the night for some reason?Were the footsteps I heard his? 
But Dan would never just leave without saying something.

I kept checking the front door, hoping he had just popped out, I knew he liked to run in the mornings.

Around noon I gave up and called home.

“Hey,” I said, trying to sound casual, “is Dan back yet?”

My mum sounded confused.

“Back? From where?”

“From mine, he stayed here last night?”

There was a long pause.

“Erm… Dan’s been here all weekend. He’s in his room now.”

“No, he, What? I picked him up. We played PlayStation. We drank Budweiser!”

“Calm down, you must’ve dreamt it, love. He didn’t go anywhere, did you want to speak to him?”

I didn’t reply. I couldn’t.

I sat there, the phone still pressed to my ear, staring at the front door.

“Sorry mum, no, it’s okay, I must have just had a vivid dream or something, I’ll speak to you later, okay?”

“Okay love, love you, bye”

“Love you too, bye”.

I looked around my living room, the empty  beer bottles still on the coffee table.

I was just about to call my girlfriend when I heard a voice coming from upstairs.

“Mate, you downstairs?”

It was Dan. I jumped up and walked out the room. 

“Dan?” I called from the bottom of the stairs.

“Yeah, come up here mate!”

My stomach dropped.

“Okay mate, coming now!” I shouted back.

I grabbed my keys, ran out the front door.
As I reached my car, I looked back up to the upstairs window.

Through the blinds, two red eyes stared back at me. 

I couldn’t have got into my car any quicker. 

That was it. I was not going back to that house again. 

I am currently staying with my girlfriend’s parents. 

I have spoken to Dan, my mum was right. 
I never called him. 
He never came to mine. 
He never stayed over. 

I’ve been reading online… Something about a Jinn or skinwalker? Anyone know what these are?

One post said if you ever ‘acknowledge’ it, it can mimic people you know or loved ones, is that true?

We are now considering putting the house back up for sale. 

If you have any suggestions on what we can do to get rid of it or anything to help, please reach out.

This was supposed to be our forever home, but now it has turned into a living nightmare. 

This sounds stupid but, because I looked back that night, while I thought I was being chased up the stairs. 
Did I acknowledge it somehow? 
Did I expose it, and now it knows I can see and hear it. 

I haven’t slept more than an hour since.

You know that photo I took at the top of the stairs, yeah? I caught it. It isn’t much, but it’s on my screen right now.

I’d post it, but… I’m not sure if I can on here.
