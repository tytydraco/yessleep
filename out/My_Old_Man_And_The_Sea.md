This may be the tale of a fisherman but it is no fisherman’s tale, I swear it. 



Father was a white man from Whitby, Mother an Iqaluit Inuit, making me half-and-half. He was Henry Seaver, she was Aqakuktuk. Father promised mother their second child would bear an Inuqtitut name, but she passed on in the womb, making me Henry Seaver II, sole descendent of Henry Seaver I and the only one left to pass on our story.



Father was a fisherman, but don’t be mistaken; even back then we’d long since lay down our spears for rods, our harpoons for rifles, and our weirs for nets. For father, fishing was little more than puttering about adeck a trawler in his bone dry waders, yet the sea and that which lurked within ensnared his heart as nothing else.



In my very soul I *know* that I last saw my father aboard the vessel, hunched over the railing in his woolen cap, gaze lost on the horizon. As I waved, father didn’t even look back; his eyes only lingered on the sea. The motor roared to life, and with the thunderous crack of ice father vanished into the mist.



There were no storms. The sea was calm. Yet not a man aboard that vessel would return. 



Except, that is, for ‘father’.



‘Father’ came to our home years later, when father had become naught more than a bittersweet memory. Mother threw her arms around him, but ‘father’ did not for ‘father’ knew not who she was. ‘Father’ placed one arm at her back and over her shoulder his sullen eyes bore into mine as he claimed he was suffering from a most horrible bout of amnesia and, try as he might, he couldn’t remember a thing save for his name- stitched upon his slicker, though the portmaster had been so kind as to remind him of his home address.



Concerned as she was, mother was happy to welcome ‘father’ in and provide him a hot meal so as to fix his sallow complexion. Mother pranced to the kitchen as ‘father’ and I took our seats at the table. 



I did not say a word, nor did ‘father’ utter a word to me. I didn’t speak for I was so petrified I could not; ‘father’ didn’t speak perhaps because he simply would not. Silence fell over the room, and- I swear this- I began to hear a sound I first believed to be the din howl of the moaning winds. But no, I swear I had heard the crashing of waves in that very room, and ‘father’, as though transfixed, allowed his head to lull side to side as if tossed about amidst the foam. 



Mother prepared father’s favourite: dishes of cod, sculpin, and elk. Of the fish ‘father’ ate with a never before seen ferocity, as though he feared were he to stop eating for even a moment his meal may vanish into thin air. I was horrified by the vile manner in which ‘father’ shovelled the meat and stew into his craw, adorned with a glistening coat of slobber and saliva, but mother was overjoyed to see ‘father’ eat so readily, and when he had finished his fish she politely slid a wooden bowl of roast elk before him with a smile.



But ‘Father’ didn’t dare touch it. His prior vigor seemed to drain from his body as he gazed down at the meat before him, and after a moment’s quiet began to convulse with such force I had worried he may regurgitate all his insides. 



Mother and I watched in horror as ‘father’ swept his arm across the table sending the dishes clattering to the floor, his once-sullen eyes now bulging and bursting at the seams, slipping and popping from his sockets. Mother shrieked as ‘father’ clamped his hand over his mouth and tried again and again to squeeze his eyeballs back into place as a pale grey fluid began draining from his ears as though he were leaking seawater and his neck began to flex and slither and pulse as though a great eel slithered about within him.



Mother grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me from the house, not stopping until we’d reached the hut of an angakkuit. A matter of great urgency, the angakkuit ran alongside us as mother dragged me, now kicking and screaming, back to the house- back to ‘father’. 



But ‘father’ was no longer home, leaving behind only a shallow pool of foamy liquid where he once sat and a line of frantic footsteps heading towards the harbour. Some may call it folly but we followed, and by the sea we found ‘father’ kneeling in the snow. 



‘Father’ glared back at us, and before him I could see, as though a scene from a most horrid nightmare, that cast along the shore, in the frigid water, bumping against the ice, were hundreds, *thousands*, of father’s lifeless bodies as though they’d been spat up from the freezing depths and drifted ashore, all of them with their faces to the sky, mouth agape as though in the most horrible agony imaginable. 



Silence followed. ‘Father’ chokingly rasped out to my mother in Inuktitut but I understood naught but the words “I’m sorry” as mother always made me recite them when I’d misbehaved. Mother gasped. ‘Father’ then faced the angakkuit and once more spoke Inuktitut, who nodded solemnly, said something back, and waved him away, saying “Go now, go now, return.” 



‘Father’ rose to his feet, turned towards the sea, and waded into the icy waters until even his head had sunk into the darkness, and with him the shoal of terrified figures receded forever into the depths.



Never again did I see ‘father’, nor shall I ever see my father again. It has been years now since mother passed and yet I remain in our house, her very inuksuit in plain view of my window. Never shall I leave, either. If I stray, I begin hearing the nauseating crashing of waves, ‘father’s waves, growing and swelling ever more until I return to her, the sea, too frightened now to embrace her, too frightened now to abandon her. Thus between I remain, here I remain, and as the last of my line, I must here tell you my story.
