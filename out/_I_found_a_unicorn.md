Hello, Reddit. I know what you’re thinking, and no this is not a joke, this is real. I am a sheriff’s deputy in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, and I found a unicorn.

Yes. A unicorn. I’m not crazy. I found a FUCKING unicorn. And they’re not like in the fairytales…

Let’s start from the beginning. It was really late at night, and I was about to get off my shift, when a call came into the sheriff station. A woman was found stabbed in the forest near the local highway.

Me and two other deputies responded, meeting state troopers and paramedics on scene. The caller said the woman was killed by some sort of animal, so we brushed it off as a bad case of luck.

The following evening, a similar call came in, a man was found dead on a dirt road in the forest. We assumed he was also killed by an animal, maybe even the same one that killed the lady. We reached out to the conservation department, and they said they’d look into it, but never did.

On the third night, when another person was found dead, we decided to go search for this animal with members of the conservation department. I know it sounds strange, but there haven’t been animal attacks like this since the 70s, so we thought we should take care of it swiftly.

We searched the forest high and low, but we never found the animal. By two in the morning we called off the search. On the way back to the car though, I found a sparkling substance on the ground, like weird sparkly blood. 

A week passed, and no new murders occurred, until one morning, a little girl was found dead in the middle of her street, in the center of town. Her sister claims she was attacked by a unicorn while they were playing. I blew it off, but I would be proved wrong when I get a distress call on the radio. An officer was attacked by the animal.

Me and other officers raced into the woods where the officer was attacked, and we saw him lying next to sparkly bloody letters that spelled out, Leave Me Alone.

After that, we locked down the woods and set up a patrol around the area. We searched every cave, every borough, every inch of those woods and never found anything.

Then, when I was alone, I saw it. A Unicorn. It looked so beautiful and yet so horrifying in that moment. I drew my handgun and shot at it, but the bullets caused it no pain, despite causing it to bleed sparkly blood. 

I dove behind a rock as the unicorn failed to stab its horn through my chest. It kept chasing me as I sprawled through the brush. 

I eventually found myself at a conservation building where two rangers were on duty. I told them I was being chased, but they didn’t believe me until one was ambushed and impaled on the unicorn’s spike. The second ranger tried to flee, but was trampled by the magnificent beast.

I stood there in shock, unsure what to do. The Unicorn looked and me and snarled before galloping off back into the woods.

It’s been several days and no more murders have occurred. No one believed that they were committed by a god damn unicorn. I write this in hopes that someone has any information and knows to stay away from the Cedar Grove Reserve.
