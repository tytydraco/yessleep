This happened more than ten years ago.

We live in rural Oregon, and during mushroom season, we’d often go picking in the woods behind our house.

When I was in elementary school, I used to go with my grandpa, who would show me all the best spots, just the two of us.

By the time I was in middle school, I started going alone or with friends.

There wasn’t much else to do out in the countryside, you know?

That day was a Sunday, so I went with a friend.

At first, everything was going smoothly—we were finding all kinds of mushrooms.

We were just about to head home when my friend suddenly screamed and collapsed right where he was standing.

I figured he might’ve cut his foot on a branch or something—that kind of thing happens a lot out there.

But he was trembling, pointing up into the trees.

So I looked up too.

There were two hanging bodies.

When you're truly shocked, you can't even scream.

I stumbled backward, paralyzed with panic.

But the more I looked, the more I realized… they weren’t real corpses.

They were mannequins.

“What the hell?! What kind of sick joke is this?!” I muttered through clenched teeth.

We rushed down the hill, explained everything to my dad, and the three of us—me, my dad, and my friend—went back up there with a stepladder, a hatchet, and pruning shears to deal with them.

My dad climbed the ladder while my friend and I held it steady.

He quickly cut the ropes and dropped the mannequins to the ground.

“Let’s just get rid of these things,” he said, and we carried them back to our shed.

But just throwing them out as they were might cause more misunderstandings, so we decided to break them apart first—to make them less human-looking.

My dad started by stripping off the tattered clothes one of them was wearing.

That’s when we saw it.

Written in big red letters across its belly:

“A curse upon whoever takes this mannequin down—”

We all froze on the spot.

Then my dad stripped the other one—it had been dressed in an old woman’s dress.

Sure enough, across its belly it said:

“The one you love the most will die.”

Trying to keep us calm, Dad said,

“Why don’t you two go get something to drink, alright?”

And he sent us out of the shed.

In the meantime, my dad smashed both mannequins into pieces and disposed of them.

A few days later...

My mom died suddenly of heart failure.

She’d been perfectly healthy just the day before... it was so sudden.

Since then, we never talk about what happened.

But the fact remains—my dad, my friend, and I are all still alive...

Was her death just a coincidence? Or was it a curse from those mannequins?

Some kind of dark, unseen force?

I still don’t know the answer.

I hate even saying it out loud, so I’ll write it here instead...

What hurts the most... is that it said,
“The one you love the most will die.”
