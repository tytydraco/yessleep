I didn’t leave.

Maybe it was Mara’s power. Maybe it was something else. Or maybe it was just curiosity that kept pushing me forward.
But I stayed in the house.
Mara was still locked inside her room, and the Guard had vanished upstairs, somewhere on the second floor.

A lot of time passed. Mara didn’t come out, and I just kept waiting.
The Guard didn’t speak to me either. Sometimes he came downstairs, looked at me, then at the door of the white room—like he was checking to make sure it was still locked.

I tried to stay calm. I went grocery shopping. I kept the house in some kind of order. I slept. I ate. 
The days just slipped by. Until that morning.
When I woke up, the door to the strange white room was open. And Mara was gone.
I jumped up from the couch in a panic. But I didn’t have to search for her.

She was sitting by the window in her wheelchair, staring out into the garden, clutching her right hand.


“Mara… thank God, you came out,” I said, my voice almost breaking.


She didn’t answer right away. She just turned her head and looked at me.
Her eyes weren’t the same as the first time I’d seen them. There was something more in them now—more than words could explain.


“Is everything… everything okay?” I asked, my voice shaking.


“Yes, David,” Mara said.


Her voice was clear. Calm. There was no trace of her accent anymore. It sounded light, almost unreal—like it wasn’t the same woman speaking.
That’s when I finally noticed her hand.
Blood was dripping from it, slowly running down her arm and pooling into a dark stain on the seat of her chair.


“Mara—Jesus Christ, what did you do?” I grabbed her bleeding hand.


The first joint of her index finger was gone.
It was a single, clean cut. But the blood was still flowing freely.


“Mara?” I looked into her strange, distant eyes, like her mind was somewhere else entirely. “I need to take you to the hospital. Right now. Do you understand?”


Mara only nodded. As if that was exactly what she’d been about to say herself.


The hospital wasn’t far.

I helped Mara into the car. The Guard just watched as I wheeled her down the driveway and over to the vehicle. Then he closed the front door of the house.
I heard the key turn in the lock. I should have realized it right then—this wasn’t an accident.
This was part of Mara’s plan.

It didn’t take long to understand what she was really doing.

While the doctors treated Mara at the hospital, I was allowed to stay with her as her escort. I watched everything. As soon as we stepped out of the ER, she immediately snapped back into motion.


“David. Stop for a second,” she said, placing her hand on the wheel of her wheelchair. “There’s something I still need to take care of. And you’re going to help me.”


“Oh, come on. Again?” I groaned. “Mara, this is a hospital. We’re going to get into serious trouble if we start pulling the same kind of weird shit again.”


“David,” she said coldly, looking up at me. “Do you really think it matters where we are?”
Then she added, “Take me to Med-Surg. There’s someone I need to find.”


“Mara, this is a really bad idea,” I tried again.


“David. Shut up and do what I tell you,” she snapped, her tone leaving no room for argument.


Like a sulking kid, I let out a long sigh and pushed her in the direction she indicated.
All I could do was hope we wouldn’t end up dealing with the police. Wandering through the massive hospital corridors was deeply uncomfortable. Mara kept telling me where to go, but at every corner I expected a nurse or a doctor to stop us and ask who we were and what the hell we were doing there.
I wheeled her all the way to one of the rooms—and just as I feared, a nurse stepped out the moment we stopped.


“Excuse me?” she said, startled. “Who are you? What are you doing here?”


“I was looking for you, actually,” Mara said immediately. “Is Dan inside?”


The nurse frowned in confusion and looked at Mara. I wanted the floor to swallow me whole.


“Didn’t you hear me?” Mara said impatiently. “Is Dan in there? Let us in.”


The nurse opened the door as if she’d just received a direct order from the attending physician. She stepped inside—and let us in with her.
A man was lying in one of the beds. He looked surprised when he saw us and turned down the TV he’d been watching while eating dinner. He was wearing a hospital gown, and judging by the pile of personal items on his bedside table, he’d been there for a while.


“Uh… hello… nurse?” he asked hesitantly. “Can I help you?”


“Good afternoon, Dan,” Mara said, like they were old acquaintances.


“Good afternoon, ma’am… who are you?” he asked nervously, shifting in bed. “Can I help you with something?”


Mara shoved my hand off the wheelchair handles and, with one decisive push, rolled herself right up next to Dan’s bed. He scooted back instinctively, glancing at the nurse in fear.

The nurse didn’t move. She just stood there beside me, completely expressionless.

“What do you want from me?” Dan’s voice trembled. “Do I know you? How do you know my name?”


“No. I don’t know you, Dan,” Mara said calmly. “But I know what was waiting for you in your friend’s apartment.”


His face drained of color. He looked like he’d just seen a ghost. For a second I thought he might try to jump out of bed and run—but the bandages held him back. All he could do was curl in on himself.


“What do you want?” he whispered. “Do you work for that thing too? Are you here to take me to it?”


“Of course not, sweetheart,” Mara said gently. “But I do need to do something. You can’t be left without protection while I’m gone. I’m sorry… this won’t be pleasant.”


Dan didn’t even have time to react. Mara struck like a snake.
She grabbed his arm and yanked him toward her with impossible strength—like he weighed nothing at all. In one lightning-fast motion, she pulled something from her pocket and clamped her hand over his mouth.

Dan kicked and thrashed, fighting like a trapped animal. But even with her injured hand, the old woman held him with the strength of a bear.
Finally, Dan swallowed hard. Mara released him.

He collapsed back onto the bed, choking and coughing violently. I stood there frozen, panic flooding my chest, staring at the nurse—waiting for her to help him.
She didn’t move. She just stood beside me, like a mannequin.


“What the fuck?!” Dan rasped, clutching his throat. “You crazy old bitch! You’re trying to kill me!”


“Oh, don’t be such a baby, Dan,” Mara said flatly. “I did it for you. You’re safe now.”


“Mara, what the hell—” I stepped closer, shaking. “We need to get out of here. Now.”


“One more thing, David,” she said, cutting me off. “Dan… everything will be fine. For a good while, it won’t be able to hurt you. As for Matt—don’t mourn him. He knew what he was playing with from the start. This is how it ended.”


“Mara, let’s go!” I snapped when I saw Dan coughing and reaching for the call button.


Mara didn’t answer. She just gestured for me to move.
I grabbed the wheelchair handles and practically dragged her out of the room, heading straight for the EXIT sign.



I don’t know how we got out of the hospital.

But when we finally climbed into Mara’s car, I let out a breath I felt like I’d been holding the entire time.


“What the hell was that, Mara?!” I snapped, my voice shaking with anger.


She gave me a dismissive glance. Like I was just a whining child—not the person who had just watched her assault someone in a hospital room.


“Hm?” I pressed when she didn’t answer. “Who was that man, and what did you give him?”


“Oh, David…” she muttered. “Dan needed protection. Something… something very evil is hunting him. I gave him temporary protection. That’s all.”


“What did you give him?” I insisted.


Mara didn’t answer. She just stared out through the windshield, then slowly raised her bandaged hand without saying a word.


“Oh my God…” I whispered, rubbing my eyes in disbelief. “You made him swallow your finger. Jesus Christ…”


“It will protect him,” she said simply. “It had to be done. Now we’re leaving, David.”


“I don’t exactly want to stay here anyway,” I muttered tensely. “Are we going back to the Guard? To the house?”


“No, David,” she said, staring into the distance. “We’re going to another house. But first, I need to make a phone call.”


The drive was long.

Mara was on the phone almost the entire time. I was genuinely surprised when I realized she was talking to a real estate office. Of all the things I expected, calling a realtor wasn’t one of them.
By the time we arrived, I already knew—we were here to see a house for sale.
When I parked in front of a beautiful, newly built two-story family home, I just sat there for a moment, stunned. 
What are we doing now?

There was already a car in the driveway. Two people sat inside—a middle-aged couple, from the looks of them. The man was watching the house intently, barely reacting when we parked nearby.


“Hello. I’m Gordon,” he said as we all stepped out and met near the front walk. “And this is my wife, Lucy.”


“David,” I said, shaking both their hands. “You own the house?”


“Yes…” Gordon sighed deeply. “Well… we would.”

I studied their expressions carefully. They looked exhausted—but hopeful. Like they were hiding something.


“Alright, enough stalling,” Mara cut in. “How much are you asking?”


Gordon hesitated, clearly caught off guard. Lucy smiled awkwardly. That familiar, uncomfortable feeling crept over me again—something was very wrong here.


“Well?” Mara pressed. “Name the price.”


“Uh…” Gordon muttered. “The price listed in the ad. Below market value. Just like it says.”

“Fine,” Mara said instantly. “I’ll write the check.”


The couple looked at me in confusion, as if I were supposed to explain what was happening. I couldn’t. I just watched as Mara pulled out her checkbook and wrote a check for an amount that made my stomach drop.


“But ma’am,” Gordon started. “You haven’t even seen the house. There are… other things you should know—”


“I don’t care,” Mara said sharply. “I want this house. Do you want the money or not?”


Lucy and Gordon exchanged a look. Like all three of them understood something I didn’t.
Finally, Gordon took the check, shook Mara’s hand, and they got back into their car. Not a single word was spoken.
As we watched them drive away, I knew one thing for certain. This, too, was part of Mara’s plan.


Mara acted like she was in a hurry.
She’d been like that before—rushed, scattered, slipping into another language when she got stressed. But this was different. I couldn’t tell if something had happened to her in that room… or if I was sensing the early warning signs of something else entirely.

We stayed in the half-empty house she’d bought from Lucy and Gordon. Mara went straight into the massive kitchen and stayed there. She didn’t acknowledge me at all, just kept checking her small wristwatch over and over again.

I was so exhausted that the moment I sat down on the abandoned couch, I passed out.

I woke up in the middle of the night.

I didn’t jolt awake. I just knew I had to get up. Like sleeping any longer would be a mistake. My phone said it was 1:47 a.m.

What unsettled me most was realizing—through the dim half-light—that Mara was still sitting in the kitchen, staring out through the patio door.


“Mara… Jesus Christ. Why are you still sitting here?” I asked, hurrying over to her.


“Be quiet, David,” she said in that same cold tone. “Just watch.”


I didn’t argue. I followed her gaze—out into the backyard. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw it.
A shape standing in the yard.
It was nothing but a black silhouette—just dark enough to be visible.


“Mara… there’s someone in the yard,” I whispered.


“Thank God,” she sighed calmly. “The passage is still there.”


“The passage?” I asked, staring at her. “What are you talking about now?”


She didn’t look at me. She kept watching the figure outside. The silhouette didn’t move. It just stood there, as if it were watching us too. Studying us.


“You’ll understand soon enough, David,” she said quietly. “We’re almost at the end. But for now, go back to sleep. We leave in the morning.”


I didn’t know what to say.
From that moment on, Mara acted as if I wasn’t even there. She kept staring out the window, her expression analytical, heavy with meaning—like she was seeing far more than I ever could.
Like there was something out there beyond the darkness… beyond that strange human outline.
Something I wasn’t just unable to see, but something I would never be able to understand.


Mara woke me at dawn. She wanted to leave, and before I could fully pull myself together, she was already steering me toward the car.


“Where are we going, Mara?” I asked, still half asleep.


“I’ll tell you where to turn,” she said bluntly. “But we need to hurry. It starts tonight. Tomorrow, at dawn, we need to be there.”


I just nodded.
I could feel the tension radiating off her—the weight behind her words made it clear that we were heading toward something I couldn’t even begin to imagine. And that the moment I turned the key and pulled onto the road, I was driving straight toward something that would change my life forever.

I drove all day, almost without stopping. We only pulled over for gas, and once or twice so I could rest my eyes for a few minutes. Mara told me where to go the entire time, like she knew the route by heart. I had no idea where we were headed, but it felt like we were leaving everything behind.

Small towns passed by—tiny places I’d never even heard of.

But we kept going. Farther and farther away from the cities, back into rural land—but not the mountains. Wide open fields, empty stretches of land, and scattered farmhouses lined the road.


“David, turn left here,” Mara said suddenly after a long silence. “There’s a motel and a gas station up ahead. We’ll rest there. We’re making good time.”


I didn’t argue. By evening, I was completely exhausted from driving all day. I could barely stay on my feet, and collapsing onto the motel bed felt like mercy.


“David… before you fall asleep, we need to talk,” Mara said from the doorway, sitting in her wheelchair.


I sat up groggily and rubbed my eyes to show I was listening.


“We’re leaving early tomorrow morning,” she said. “But that’s secondary. We’re going to my sibling. I have to stop them. Dr. Gelon wasn’t honest with me. They loosened the reins on my sibling. And they’re… very different from me.”


“What is all of this, Mara?” I asked, confused.


“You already know this much, David,” she said, locking eyes with me. “I’m not just some hedge witch. I’m not really human at all. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you the whole truth from the beginning, but I had no choice. Things had to unfold this way for everything to fall into place.”


I swallowed hard.
Mara was deadly serious. And by now it was obvious she wasn’t just some benevolent witch from a mountain town. Everything that had happened had proven that.
Still… what was coming that had her this tense?


“Go to sleep, David,” she said at last, her voice unusually gentle. “Tomorrow is a big day. We’re going to save the world.”


I tossed and turned in the bed for a long time, Mara’s words echoing in my head over and over again. I couldn’t let any of it go—but who could have? With every passing minute, more questions pushed their way to the surface.

What was that cube I took from the trailer? Where was Kate’s child now? What happened to that thing pretending to be a little boy? Who was Dr. Gelon really—and what did Mara do in that bright white room? What did Dan need protection from in the hospital? And why did Mara buy a house with a yard that felt… wrong?

Everything churned together inside me, blending into a single, spiraling mess of thoughts, until sleep finally dragged me under. And even then, I think I dreamed about all of it at once.

Then the ground started to shake.

My eyes flew open. I didn’t even bother putting on shoes—I burst out of the motel room barefoot. The parking lot was empty, just like it had been the night before. Only Mara’s car was still there.
Mara sat beside it in her wheelchair, staring off into the distance—toward the edge of the dawn-lit sky, where something enormous was moving. Something almost mountain-shaped.
That’s when helicopters thundered overhead.

They were deafeningly loud, flying so low I could feel the air churn from their rotors. Military helicopters. All of them heading straight toward the darkening “mountain” on the horizon.

Mara looked at me then.


“Zepro is here,” she said quietly.


As I helped Mara into the car, two military jeeps turned into the motel parking lot.
A young soldier jumped out of one of them immediately, fully geared up, and hurried over to us.


“Sir, ma’am,” he said without any preamble. “I need you to leave the area immediately. We’re evacuating the surroundings.”


“All right,” Mara replied calmly. “We’re leaving. And no one is going to stop us.”


I saw the same emptiness in the soldier’s eyes that I’d seen before—in the nurse at the hospital. Like he had suddenly drifted somewhere far away. He nodded once, then hurried back to his vehicle, as if he’d just received a direct order.

That’s when tanks rolled past on the road beside the motel, their engines roaring like something alive. A moment later, a fighter jet screamed overhead, the sound so sharp it felt like it split the air open. Not long after that, dull explosions echoed from somewhere in the distance—close enough that I instinctively clapped my hands over my ears and crouched beside the car in the parking lot.

Mara didn’t flinch.

She was already seated in the passenger seat, looking at me with a gaze that was both stern and strangely reassuring.

The tanks opened fire.

The blasts from their cannons shook the air so violently I felt it rattle inside my chest. They were firing continuously at something out there—something I still couldn’t see clearly. The ground trembled. The car rocked. Even the motel building seemed to jump in place.

Then Mara reached out toward me through the open window. The bandage on her injured hand was no longer stained with blood.


“Come on, David,” she said evenly. “We need to go.”


As those words left her mouth, something washed over me. Maybe it was resolve. Maybe it was faith.
All I knew was this:
As long as I stayed with Mara—and followed her plan—everything would be all right.


The underside of the car sparked as I tore out of the motel parking lot, crashing over curbs and debris.

Tanks were lined up along the road, firing at what looked like a mountain in the distance. But as the sun climbed higher into the sky, it became horrifyingly clear—

It wasn’t a mountain.

A colossal mass of flesh loomed ahead of us. It heaved and swelled like a living hill, growing larger by the second. Massive, hand-shaped tendrils stretched upward toward the sky. Enormous eyes writhed across its surface, opening and closing, watching everything at once.

And the worst part—

It was absorbing everything.

I watched tank shells detonate against it, black clouds of smoke blooming on impact—only for the explosions to be swallowed whole. The fire, the force, the debris… all of it vanished into the thing, as if it consumed energy itself.


“David, watch the road,” Mara said calmly.


“What the fuck is that?!” I screamed, unable to tear my eyes away.


“This,” Mara said, pausing for just a moment, “is Zepro. My sister.” Then her voice hardened.
“Now floor it. We have to get there.”


“Oh, for fuck’s sake…” I muttered, slamming the accelerator to the floor.


The tanks fired almost nonstop. Two fighter jets streaked overhead, unloading missiles into Zepro’s bulk. The creature didn’t react. It just kept rolling forward, a mountain of red, living flesh.


“Here, David!” Mara shouted. “Stop! Stop here!”


We reached a narrow dirt road. I would have missed it if she hadn’t yelled. It led into what looked like an old farm property. Zepro’s massive body was so close now that I couldn’t even see where it ended through the windshield.
But that wasn’t the only thing there.
A flipped car lay smoking on the roadside. Next to it, a man was sprawled on the ground—badly injured.


“Help him,” Mara said, shoving my arm. “Get him into the car.”


I slammed on the brakes and jumped out. The man was bleeding from multiple wounds, but he was conscious.


“Help… please…” he groaned.


“I’ve got you,” I said, grabbing his arm. “I’ll get you to the car.”


I counted to three out loud, then pulled. He screamed and thrashed, and I kept telling him we were almost there. Those few yards felt endless—for both of us. But somehow, I managed to get him into the back seat, where he immediately soaked the upholstery with blood.


“All right. Calm down, Frank,” Mara said, reaching back and gently patting his shoulder. “You’re safe now. Rest. You did well last night.”


“What?” he rasped. “How do you know my name? Who are you people?”


I got back behind the wheel and slowly started down the dirt road.


“No—don’t go that way!” Frank panicked. “Don’t take me back!”


“It’s okay, Frank,” Mara said softly. “We’re not taking you back. I know last night was hard. But you survived. I knew you would. I couldn’t help you then… but I can now.”


“What the fuck?” Frank coughed. “Hey.. driver, what is she talking about? What is all this?”


“I don’t know either,” I muttered. “I don’t think I understand anything anymore.”


Mara smiled.
But when we turned back around, her face went serious again.
Zepro’s grotesque, mountain-like body loomed directly in front of us, pulsing and writhing. Explosions still flashed across its surface, doing nothing. Around its base, shapes moved—humanoid, but unmistakably not human.


“This is where I get out, David,” Mara said simply.


“What?!” I snapped. “You can’t be serious!”


She just smiled and placed a hand on my shoulder.


“Frank, hold on a little longer,” she said, turning back. “David will get you somewhere safe. You’ve done your part. Now it’s my turn.”


“Mara—” I started.


“Shh, David,” she interrupted. “I have to do what only I can do. But your job doesn’t end just because I won’t be here.”


I stared at her. I knew what she was about to do. And still, I hoped—stupidly—that there was another way.
She pressed a heavy ring of keys into my hand.


“These are for my old house,” she said, “and the one we bought from Gordon and Lucy. Listen carefully.”


“I’m listening.”


“You watch over things until I return,” she said, locking eyes with me. “Check the house every night. If the dark figure is in the yard, you don’t interfere—but you cannot stay there. If you see it, you leave. Understand?”


“Yes.”


“If the figure isn’t there, you go back to the Guard. To the white room. From then on, that’s the only place you go. Is that clear?”


“Yes… but what happens now?”


“That’s my responsibility,” Mara said. “I’m leaving. I’m taking Zepro with me. But I will return, David. That’s why I still need you. You have to help me come back.”


She hugged me.
Then she opened the door and stepped out of the car. Without the wheelchair.

I just stared as the elderly, supposedly disabled woman walked away effortlessly—as if she had never been broken at all.


“You see, David,” she said, smiling back at me. “I never needed as much help as you thought. But thank you. For everything. Stay strong.”


And then she walked toward Zepro’s vast, writhing mass of flesh.
I knew that whatever happened next was something no mortal human could ever understand.
I turned the car around. Drove back down the dirt road, past the soldiers. I didn’t stop. I kept going as far as the car would take me.
In the rearview mirror, there was nothing left. No flesh. No mountain.

Mara did what she had to do.



I stood inside Mara’s small house in Mirebrook and didn’t know what to do with myself.
I just existed.

It felt like the days—weeks—I’d spent with her belonged to another life entirely. I packed up the house and kept checking the news, hoping to find something about what happened on that farm.
There was nothing. It was like it had all been erased. Covered up.

I took Frank to the hospital that same day. I told them he’d been in an accident—that I’d found him like that. Which was partly true.
Helping him didn’t make me feel any better. I knew Mara’s plans had forced him through what he’d suffered. That his pain had been necessary.

And I couldn’t change that. Then I had an idea. Maybe I could help others.
People like Frank. And everyone else I met along the way. People who were touched by this—whether they knew it or not.

So here it is.
Everything I know about what happened. The events. The bigger picture.

Maybe it will help someone.
