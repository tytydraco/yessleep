 

I bet you’re questioning the title, and I know it sounds crazy but please just listen. On October 31st, 2022, I opened a can of spaghettios because I was hungry and I put them in the microwave. I took them out and I felt immense pain in my finger. I thought I had just burnt myself so I went on with my day. I thought my finger looked a little red, but of course, that’s what happens when you burn your finger. I went to sleep that same night and woke up around 12:07am to a blood-curtling scream right next to me. My girlfriend Jane had woken up and saw blood running down my torso. I woke up and saw the blood and was immediately terrified. I couldn’t move, all I could do was stare at the blood coming from the finger I had “burnt.” I snapped out of it and we tried to stop the bleeding but we noticed the once red mark on my finger was now a big gaping hole that was gradually getting bigger. It was like something was ripping it open from the inside.

We rushed to the hospital as quickly as we could and showed the receptionist my finger. She was puzzled. She had never seen anything like this. As soon as she snapped out of her daze, she called the doctor and told him we had an emergency. As soon as he got to us he put a towel around my finger in an attempt to stop the bleeding, which didn’t work. It just kept bleeding through the towel. By the time he sat us down, it had eaten away the front of my fingertip. Jane was crying hysterically at this point and all I could do was try to comfort her the best I could meanwhile I was just as scared. I glanced back at the towel that the doctor took off of my finger and noticed that there were chunks of spaghettio on it, accompanied by the orangeish-red sauce that's in it. Finally, the doctor thought of what to do and tried stitching me up. He said he wanted to monitor me to see if anything happens. I’m typing this as I lay in the hospital bed, it's 4am at this point and I’m so scared. I can feel things inside my finger moving around.

UPDATE:  
It’s 8am right now and something has eaten through the stitches and farther down my hand. I can see what is supposed to be my bone, but I don’t think it is. It’s not hard like a regular bone should be. The doctors told me there was nothing they could do, I think they know something I don’t.

  


UPDATE TWO:  
The doctors have sent me home. I am officially going to die, so I’m calling all of the family I am in contact with and telling them goodbye and that I love them. Jane doesn’t want to give up just yet but I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to die. I’m not ready.

  


UPDATE THREE:  
IT HAS EATEN THROUGH MY ENTIRE LEFT ARM. I REPEAT IT HAS EATEN THROUGH MY WHOLE LEFT ARM. I CAN’T MOVE. EVERY TIME I TRY TO MOVE MY ARM IT BREAKS APART BECAUSE OF THE SHEER WEIGHT OF MY NOODLE BONES.

UPDATE FIVE:  
This is Jane. My boyfriend Lucas has passed away. I think I’m just going to delete his old Reddit account as it’s really hard for me to still have access to it. Things are really hard right now and I’m developing a small red rash on my finger because of it.
