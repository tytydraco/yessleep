Netherlands 1608:

Hans Lippershey woke up early, writhing out of his warm bed and dressing for the day. Grabbing his things and walking out the front door, Hans set off toward his beloved lens crafting shop where he was known as an expert spectacle maker. 

As someone who worked with the magnification of close up and far away objects, Hans couldn’t help but observe his surroundings. The peeking of light above the buildings as the sun rose, the dirt lining the cobblestone in the streets, and his warm breath as it fogged and blew about his head as he walked on. Hans was also thinking this morning. Thinking about his apprentice’s comment the day before. The shop had been slow and as Hans sat crafting lenses, his apprentice exclaimed a mighty, “Hah!”

“What has you so excited?” Hans asked.

His apprentice ran over, holding two lenses together, explaining, “With these two lenses together, I can see even farther down the road than with any one lens!”

Not wanting to encourage the slacking off, Hans let out an inquisitive huff and told the apprentice to get back to work.

Now, as Hans turned the key in the front door of his spectacle shop, he could only think about the two lenses, set apart enough, being able to see even farther. As he stepped into the front door and shut it behind him, he could only think about experimenting. His mind hungered for invention, the undiscovered.

Weeks of being awoken by an unencumbered strive for discovery, Hans worked in the early mornings on his two-lensed glass. Eventually, he was able to place the two lenses one after the other, held a few inches apart by a wooden tube. This allowed him to see the individual feathers on a bird in a tree on the hill a mile away. This allowed him to spy on neighbors through their windows going about their chores. This allowed him to see ships at sea while standing on the pier. This was the earliest telescope. 


It is well known Galileo was the first person to use the telescope to look toward the heavens. Before then, it is documented, early telescopes were only used for Earth-bound looking. But this is not true.


Hans, after being the first to file a patent for his telescope, was quickly overshadowed by Galileo. Galileo, the Italian astronomer, was able to upgrade the telescope to magnify more and more, allowing him to make many significant discoveries in our skies. 

But Hans was close behind. 

Always playing catchup, Hans, too, improved upon his original model of the telescope until he was able to see stars in the heavens and planets colors in the night sky. Hans also became obsessed with the cosmos and the endless possibilities it possessed. Although none of it is documented, Hans continued to stargaze until his death in 1619. 

The great intrigue of Hans, though, comes from a recently uncovered journal of his from his last days. 

He speaks of his interest in the Wadden islands, the supposed best and most remote area for prime stargazing. His focus had shifted in 1619 to the Milky Way, the cluster of stars you can see paint the sky on a clear night like a brush stroke across the dark. Hans wanted to see it up close. He wanted to feel as if he was among them, the stars, and see their twinkling all around him.

Presumably, he took a small boat to one of the islands, waited until nightfall, and set up the newest model of his telescope. 

Hans mentions how this was the best model yet, how this was his first time testing it out on the stars.

He took a deep breath, placed his right eye up to the lens, and looked through.

What he saw was absolute horror. 

What he saw was the souls of millions, burning and writhing, gored and in excruciating pain.



There are old folktales speaking of the Milky Way as a sort of bridge for spirits. It was believed that the Milky Way was like a pathway to heaven, leading souls to the bright afterlife to live in eternal happiness.

What Hans saw was the end of salvation. 

Every star, when looked at closely enough, was a human soul, taking the shape of their once-alive body, being ripped apart by fire and the explosions known to star formation. And on that special night, on that island, Hans was able to see the Milky Way for what it really was—a painful road to Hell.

His journal describes his disgust with watching these spectacular bodies torn apart, guts strewn, blood gushing. 

Hans could not get this horror out of his head, reliving it every night until he couldn’t take it anymore, knowing what was out there—knowing what fate was waiting for him.



Now, it’s said light pollution in almost all the world keeps us from seeing the stars how the astronomers back in the 1600s did. But, I can’t help but wonder when I see a red hue flash in a twinkling star.
