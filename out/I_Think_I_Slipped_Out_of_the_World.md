My name is Brian.

I'm 29 years old.

And I'm a ghost.



Or at least, that's what I've started calling myself. It's the only thing that makes sense anymore. I'll try to explain what happened, as best as I can, with what little I understand.



The other day, I was heading to my buddy Kyle's place. It was a Sunday with nothing better to do. We both live downtown, and his apartment is about a fifteen minute walk from mine. To dodge the weekend crowds I cut through the alleyways, same as always. It felt like any other day.



Except something strange happened. In alleyway #3 a sudden shock tore through me, like an invisible force pushing and pulling at the same time. It lasted a second, just long enough to send me face first to the ground. I stood, shook it off, then froze. I wanted to move my feet, but I could not.



I caught my breath and stepped back to the same spot. Nothing. I ran to the alley entrance and retraced my steps. Still nothing. I waved my arms, kicked at the air, tried anything. Nothing at all. I started walking again toward Kyle's place when it hit me again, that same push and pull, sharp enough to make me gasp.



I tested the spot at different speeds and felt it again when I matched my usual walking pace. Then, without warning, a sudden pop hit me, like I was trapped inside a balloon that burst all at once. My eyes watered. My ears rang.



Then nothing. I retraced my steps, did the exact same thing again. Still nothing. Was I getting sick? Was I losing it? I was clueless and tried to push it to the back of my mind. I left the alley and kept walking to Kyle's place. Everything felt normal again. Car horns at the intersections, smells from food stands mixing in the air, sidewalks packed with people, residents and tourists alike.



Kyle's place was across the street by the park. I waited for the light to turn green when a pigeon shot down and slammed into my side, hard enough to knock me over, like it weighed several times more than it should. It kept flying like nothing happened, completely unfazed. I looked at the nearest person and yelled, did you see that, but no one reacted. The light changed. I crossed alone.



I crossed the street and headed into the park to collect myself. A group of preschool kids filled the path ahead, running straight toward me. I turned my body to move out of the way, but it was too late. They hit me, or maybe I hit them, and I was thrown into the park, sliding twenty feet before landing face first in the dirt. I looked back and the kids were fine like nothing happened. Just like the pigeon.



I felt nothing. No pain. My heart should have been racing, but it was still. I pressed a hand to my chest. No heartbeat. My head spun as I stumbled to a nearby bench where a woman sat with her grocery bags. I tried to move the bags so I could sit, but they would not budge. It was like trying to shove a wall. I dropped to my knees and looked up at her. She kept reading, unaware I was even there.



My confusion turned into anger. I swung at the woman, but my hand passed through her head and stuck there. I tried to pull back and only my arm came free, my hand stayed inside her skull, floating just beneath her skin as she kept reading with a faint smile. I stared in disbelief. This had to be some kind of nightmare, I thought.



I could still move the hand trapped inside her head, but not enough to pull it free. The tips of my fingers broke through her forehead before the rest stuck fast again. I grabbed the exposed fingers, braced a foot against her midsection, and pulled hard. The fingers tore loose and hit the ground. A jogger stepped on them, pressing them through the dirt and into somewhere else. I felt them vanish, but the rest of my hand was still there, buried inside her head.



I spent what felt like twenty minutes trying to pull my hand free, but it was useless. The woman finished her book, stood, and left with my stolen hand; I could somehow feel it brushing against the folds of her brain as she walked away. I searched the park for my missing fingers but found nothing. At one point I kicked a tree in frustration and the tip of my right foot got stuck in its trunk. I wiggled it loose and kept moving.



As dusk settled and the air grew cold, I still felt nothing. There was no breeze. No sound. I was numb, locked in my own head with only my thoughts. I could still hear my own voice when I spoke. I sat at the base of the tree that had caught my foot and leaned against it, half hoping it would pull me in and end whatever this was.



I tore off my shirt and held it up to the fading light. The orange glow shone through it as I wrapped it around my waist. Then I stopped. I was holding the shirt like normal. Touching it. Feeling the fabric. I unwrapped it and ran my thumbs over the cloth again, testing it. When I finally stood, night had fallen. I walked back to the same alley and waited. Nothing. I was stuck. At least I was not hungry or tired.



I took out my phone. I had left home with it at two percent battery, planning to charge it at Kyle's place. Hours later it was still at two percent. That made no sense. I tried to text Kyle. Nothing. I tried anyone else. Nothing. The map app would not load. When I opened the browser it showed the last site I used, Reddit, but it looked frozen, like I was stuck in offline mode. No updates. No scrolling. Just stillness.



I was still logged in. The only tab open was r/nosleep. I could start new threads, but I had no way to know if they were going anywhere. So I started writing this, hoping someone might see it. Maybe others are out there like me, trapped in their own strange corners. Maybe no one will believe me. If someone reads it at all, that is enough.



After a while I made it to Kyle's apartment. The sliding doors were locked, and no one was around. It was late, so I sat in the corner by the entrance and waited for morning. I kept thinking about my shirt and phone. If I could still touch them, maybe anything I had with me had crossed over too. That was the best guess I had.



It started to rain sometime in the night. I stared into it. The droplets hit my skin like tiny lead pellets. Then I saw a squirrel leave a nearby tree and step into the street. The rain tore it apart, breaking it into hundreds of twitching bits that scattered in the wind. Maybe they went wherever my fingers went. I watched in silence. I wasn't alone after all.



It will be hard getting used to this new life. Maybe I am the only person trapped like this. I hope I find someone else. Someone I can touch without being thrown across the ground. I type slow with one hand, but at least I can still write.



I sense my severed hand somehow. It's stuck between the woman's eyes, bouncing back and forth like a slow motion game of ping pong.



My name is Brian. I'm 29 years old. And I'm a ghost.
