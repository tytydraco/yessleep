As a young child, I had extreme night terrors.
At least that's what my parents would say.

But to be honest, it wasn't just night terrors.

I was a very sensible child, and my grandma always said I was special. Of course that's what all good grannies say about their grandchildren, but that's not what she meant. 

I sometimes had, not quite premonitions, but I'd know things I wasn't supposed to know. Things that frightened me. For example, I would strongly feel that a day wouldn't go well. That something bad would happen. But not generally, it's really hard to explain, but for example, if I planned to stay at home all day, I felt something would happen. If I then left, even if it was just bringing some old magazines to our elderly neighbour and immediately coming back, nothing would happen. 
Or if I planned wearing a shirt, and then instead wearing a hoody, again, nothing would happen.
It usually was small things, inconsequential things, and & never risked it.
And I was deadly afraid of sleeping alone or even walking upstairs into the finished attic where the children's rooms were, I felt deeply afraid.
And as long as I can remember, I wasn't able to fall asleep easily.
Of course, all of that sounds silly. And now, as an adult woman I usually sleep fine and rarely ever have that special feeling of terror anymore. And for the longest time, I thought as a child I was just high strung and of course you will say that nothing ever happened.

But something did eventually happen. Nothing too bad, and I thought I could leave it behind, but...

Well, lets start at the beginning.

We were three siblings, my oldest brother is 10 years older than me, my sister is 7 years older, and I'm the youngest.

My family was... difficult. Not abusive per se, but definitely a little dysfunctional. Better as some but definitely not as good as we could have been. 

I grew up in a house that my parents and grandparents built. My grandparents lived in the ground level, and my parents with my two siblings on the first level.

Before I was born, my farther and his dad, my grandfather, fixed the attic. 
The first room was a shared room, it had a sofa and a few cupboards, there was a tiny bathroom with a toilet and a sink. The second room was my sisters, and the third was my brothers. 
The first room also had an entry to the lower side of the room. The house had a pointed roof, and when those three rooms were made, my dad and grandpa just put some drywall up where the ceiling sloped down and behind that was a low, tight space where my parents would storage stuff like Christmas decorations and luggage or old stuff in general. Things people put in attics.

One entry was in a corner of the first room, the other was in the tiny bathroom.
When I was born, I lived at first on the same level as my parents, and my siblings lived upstairs.

I don't remember much about the time my brother still lived at home. He left early for an apprenticeship at the railway, then he left for his compulsory military service, and after that he moved out.
In between he moved up from the last room to the first, and I got the third room when I was about 5 or 6 years old.
And as long as I can remember, I had those feelings and terrors whenever I had to ho upstairs alone. 
It was just a little during the day, but I felt absolutely terrified if I had to go alone.

So my parents decided, maybe a pet would help. And they got me a bunny.

And it did help. As long as my bunny was with me, I wasn't afraid. But he lived in a cage in the  stairway, but he was very friendly and tame. If I had to go upstairs and fetch something, I would take him from his cage and carried him upstairs, and everything was fine.
But I couldn't have him with me at night, so I still couldn't sleep.
The reason was, I felt watched. There was nothing frightening there, no creepy shadows, no strange sounds, absolutely nothing to be afraid of. I just felt a presence there, and that something would happen if I vlosed my eyes and slept when no one else was there. The feeling would lessen when my sister went to bed but it never went completely away, and sometimes it wouldn't help if she was there, I just got the feeling of an intense hatred concentrated on me, and I just knew, if I'd stay, something would happen. 

So I snuck out.

When I was still very young, I'd crawl into bed with my parents or my sister, but they wouldn't allow it when I grew older. So I'd hide in wardrobes downstairs and sleep there, or I'd sleep on the sofa in the living room. Or I'd sleep in the flat of my grandparents, pretending I fell asleep while watching TV with them, and they'd just let me sleep.

When I grew onlder, some very few nights were okay. The presence was gone, and I'd sleep a reatless, nervous night in my bed. 

But as long as I slept at home, I was never able to fully rest when I was alone.

Eventually as a teen, my parents forced me to sleep upstairs after they caught me trying to sleep on the sofa again. 

I laid in my bed, wide awake, unable to move out of sheer terror. 
And that's when something happened. 

I felt something scratching my back.

It felt as if something huge, with a big paw, touched my back with it's fingernails, then opening the fingers, spreading the nails while still touching my back, pulling them together and spreading them again. Then the hand was gone.

And the worst thing is, I could see it in my mind, clear as day. Not in the way you see an image you remember or a dream, but as if I was seeing my back, with that hand on it.

And ot was so alien, so unspeakably *different*, I can't bear thinking of it even today. I feel of I tried, I could imagine every detail. But believe me, I don't want to. Everything about that image was wrong.

I stared unblinking into the darkness and I didn't dare to move. Because up till today I'm adamantly sure that if I'd tried to turn on the might or leave, or if I fell asleep, I'd finally seen it. All of it. And I wouldn't have survived.

After that my feelings became premonitions.

I would walk up the stairs, and suddenly in a flash I felt I had to go out. We had a little enclosure for the bunny so it could sit outside and eat grass. I saw the enclosure topp√∂ed ove and the bunny was gone.

I turned around and ran outside into the garden and it was exactly as I had seen. But the bunny was still sitting close. I called him and he came towards me, and bust as I picked him up a shadow fell on us. But there was nothing casting a shadow, and it reluctantly moved away from us, as if it couldn't get us as long as we were together.

Not long after that, my bunny died while he was alone.

Then my sister moved out, and either I would sit upright all night with the lights on and reading, pr watching TV all night on my sisters old TV which she left behind, or I'd stubbornly sleep on the sofa again.

So my father got me a cat, and he was allowed to sleep in my bed. And as long as he was there, everything was okay.
I had moved out of my room, into my sister's room, and the feeling was less intense there.

Then, one day, my mum and sister were laughing. And I asked what was wrong. And my sister told me that when my brother was younger, he'd have night terrors. And once while he was asleep, he was sleepwalking and he had made a hole in the drywall, inside of the wardrobe in my old room. The third room I was occupying. 

They had hidden the hole with old wallpaper which they taped over it, and my vrother had moved into the first room.

The hole was exactly where I always felt that intense gatred coming from. 

I asked my brother during a family gathering, why he'd made that hole. And he wouldn't say. Later in the evening he was drunk. And I asked him again. And he told me then he had seen a clear picture of the hole in the drywall in his mind, and felt the intense conviction that if he didn't make that hole, something horrible would happen.

But after that hole was there, he wasn't able to sleep in that room anymore. He constantly felt as if something was watching.

Eventually I moved out. I left my cat with my grandma, because my grandpa had just died and she loved that cat as much as me. Also he didn't like my new home. My husband and I live in a house not far away from a rather busy street, and my cat was an outdoor cat who would roam during the day.

He lived with her several more years, but would never again willingly enter the fixed attic. Then my father would one day hear something in the small storage space behind the drywall. He let my cat in, thinking it was a mouse. The cat didn't come out when he called, so he left the door open and went down again. Assuming the cat would come back down when he got the mouse. He was a good mouser.

We never saw that cat again. 

Years have gone by. I had moved in with my boyfriend, several hundred kilometres away. My fears just vanished. I feel safe. I sleep well. My strange feelings and premonitions stopped. And I almost forgot about my childhood.
My grandma died eventually, and so did my father. My mum moved downstairs and my sister moved back in with her family. They completely remodeled the attic into a full flat. And if I visited, I'd sleep on the couch in my mums flat downstairs. As far away from that corner as possible. But I felt safe. That corner doesn't exist anymore, it was torn down in the remodeling.

Then, a few years ago. My mum suddenly fell ill. One day we have a nice phone call and talk about what we will do on my next visit, the next night she broke down while alone and ends in the hospital. She died within a week. I went down to help my sister arranging the funeral. And I slept on the sofa in my mum's flat.
And suddenly there was that feeling of being watched again! It came from the same direction as before. Exactly from that corner of the house, where the hole in the drywall had been. Just now it had come downstairs!
I immediately left the room, closed the door and barricaded myself in my mum's bedroom. It was better there. But I heard the living room door rattle quietly, as if a draft was rattling it. 

I didn't sleep a minute. Not that night, not the next three nights. Eventually I told my sister the lower floor felt cold and she let me sleep on her couch.

My sister and I don't hate each other, but we're also not close. The age gap is just too big. So the contact fell asleep over the past two years except for occasional text messages. Especially since I live some distance away and don't like sleeping in the house I grew up in.
I heard she has cleaned out the lower floor and one of her sons was moving in. She had kept the house as was agreed upon when she moved in to care for our mum.

My nephew became a dad one year ago. His little daughter has the room that was once my mum's living room. 

She has night terrors and wants to sleep in her parent's bed. My sister said, this will pass.

I'm not so sure.
