Recently, after being presented with a new job, I was moving into an old building. It is the kind of building that really radiates charm in daylight, with the smell of old carpet faintly following you from the lobby to the unit along the peeling walls and creaking floors. Charmed I was in the beginning, caved in now due to the freedom to call my own place in the city provided, and the additional cherry atop the tour was how cheap my apartment was.

But by the next morning, I felt there was something off.

I heard faint, purposeful footsteps coming from next door, not the sounds of someone tossing and turning in bed or the drop of a shoe, but careful ones, slow, as if the person were intentionally pacing in a narrow room. I thought perhaps a resident had finally moved in, despite apartment 3B still being listed as vacant in the building directory. Midnight footfalls, paced with a slowness and intention at times accidentally quickening, echoed the very thin wall separating our two apartments.

Then scratching began.

At first it was faint perhaps the scurrying of a mouse or some lesser rodent trapped inside the walls. Then, eventually, a steady, rhythmic, repetitive sound that grew louder. Scattering, no. It sounded a lot more like someone was running their fingernails down the drywall outside my unit, again and again. For hours on end, sometimes.

I rang the doorbell of 3B.

Nothing.

I waited. Light knock. Swagger knock. Then I put my ear against the wood. All was silent.

It seemed purposeful. Maybe the tenant went to bed. Perhaps they had headphones on. All sorts of sensible options prompted me to file a noise complaint with the administration of my building.

In response, I received one message.

"Our records indicate that unit 3B is currently unoccupied. No tenant is listed as residing there."

I was taken aback. For days, in fact, there had been continuous sounds walking, scratching, shuffling of someone moving in there almost certainly just beyond the wall. I tried to dismiss it as the stress of moving, or the settling of the building, or just thin walls carrying noise from somewhere else.

I persuaded myself in that way until the screams came.

Truly terrifying, deathly, throat-scathing screams that ripped through the night, so high and desperate that the very sound just wanted to give me chills. The screams went for way too long for it to be any human. I was now petrified on my bed, with the nails of my hands digging into the sheets, hearing the alternating screams going down the vortex of death and brought back to sanity.

Next morning, I practically rushed down to the front desk and asked for investigations into it. Maybe a squatter. An intruder. Someone injured.

The response sent chills down my spine. 

"Maintenance checked unit 3B this morning and found no signs of entry or habitation. The apartment is empty."

Lucky for the building, I wasn't buying it. I went and looked myself. I went upstairs with the maintenance guy. He opened the door with his key and just let it swing open.

There was no one in the apartment.

Totally empty, with dust on the countertops, shiny floors, no footprints, no furniture, no signs of living. No place to hide. No open windows. Nothing.

But the moment we left and locked it, I heard an inside noise: something dragged across the floor, something corporeal.

I've examined this throughout and always land on the same sketch: empty apartment that is really quite loud and seems really busy just not when I am there.

I don't know what is there or what is going on. I don't even know if I'm going insane anymore. But the sounds are stretching. Last night, there was some deep, rasping breathing that sounded almost slow just behind the wall next to my bed.

I’m posting this because I don’t know what else to do.

Has anyone experienced something like this before? Does anyone know what could be in that apartment?
