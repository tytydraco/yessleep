My name’s Robert Paulson, and I reckon I’m almost outta time. Been writing these notes down in hopes somebody, anybody, might find ‘em after I’m gone. Something’s been happening here, and it’s bad, worse than I can rightly make sense of.

Let me back up. I ain’t nobody special, just a plain fella in a plain ol’ town. Born here, never left. We got maybe two streets that matter, a gas station, couple churches, and a whole lotta folks who know everyone’s business. Nothing much changes ‘round here. Or, well, it didn’t.

All of a sudden, about a week ago, a grocery store popped up right smack in the middle of town. Not like we ever needed one. Nearest city’s twenty miles west, and folks been makin’ that drive for groceries my whole life. But this thing just… appeared. No sign, no trucks, no ribbon cutting. One day it was a patch of grass, next day it was a peach-colored box, ugly as sin.

I hated it soon as I saw it, but figured maybe it’d help some of the old timers get their bread and milk without the drive. But then things got strange. First night, I swear it grew. Not a little bit, either. Whole side of it bulged out like a swollen tick. No construction, not a peep. Just bigger. Next night, it had a second set of doors, and the paint got darker, almost wet-looking. I seen shadows moving inside even before the sun came up.

By the third day, Mrs. Harlow’s boy, he used to work at the mill, was out front, stacking carts. I asked him when he started, and he just looked through me, like he couldn’t see me at all. Saw Mr. King, who owns the feed store, standing behind a register in an apron. Folks who used to have good jobs just quit and started working there, like they didn’t have a choice.

I heard stories about people going in and not coming out till morning, eyes all glassy, arms covered in dust or flour or something I didn’t wanna touch. Some of ‘em stopped coming home at all. The parking lot filled up with cars but nobody ever left. At night, you could see ‘em moving around in the aisles, not shopping, just… wandering.

One night, right before dawn, I spotted a dog walk up to the side of the building and disappear. Not into the door, straight through the wall, like it was water. Next morning, the whole east side had stretched another fifteen feet, swallowing up the playground where everyone’s kids would play. I drove by and my hands started shaking so bad I had to pull over. There was a smell too, like meat gone bad, but sweet underneath.

It’s worse inside. I tried to go in once, just to see for myself. The lights flicker, and the aisles go on longer than they should, like you could walk forever and never find the end. I heard voices whispering names I ain’t heard in years. I left before I could even get past the second set of doors, heart pounding so loud I couldn’t hear a damn thing. 

Last night, I saw it change with my own eyes. Didn’t mean to, just fell asleep at my desk and woke up to a scraping, slurping sound outside. The whole building was crawling closer, dragging itself over the ground like a wounded animal. The walls rippled and split, and for a second I think I saw faces, dozens, hundreds, pressed into the stucco, mouths wide like they was screaming, eyes rolling back. Limbs twisted out, grabbed at the dirt, trees, anything nearby. The ground buckled and got sucked under, gone in a heartbeat. The air stinked of sulfur, I couldn’t move, could barely breathe. My skin crawled and my head rang like a bell. Then, just as sudden, it stopped. Looked normal again, if you can call it that. Just sittin’ there, humming, like a monster pretending to be asleep.

Now it’s only a few yards from my porch. I know it’s coming for me. I don’t got family, not anymore. Never thought I’d miss people, but I do. I’d give anything to see a friend’s face right now, even just to argue about nothing. Funny how you convince yourself isolation is preferable to everyone’s flaws and annoying habits, god I’d kill to be ten years old, mother hollering at me for staying out too late. 

I’ll leave these notes somewhere safe—maybe they’ll help somebody make sense of all this. I’m sorry I couldn’t stop it. Sorry, Ma. Sorry, Pa. Sorry to everyone I ever let down.

I been thinking a lot about stories lately. The old kind. The ones we were told in Sunday school that scared us straight. One keeps coming back to me; the Tower. Tower of Babel. Never thought much of it before, but now… now it feels like a warning we ignored.

‘Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.

 As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.

They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”

But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”

So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.’

But now God is dead, The Tower of Babel grows.
