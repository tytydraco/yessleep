Hey everyone. I’m writing for some advice and honestly some reassurance. I bought the airplane wifi but it’s incredibly glitchy and this is the only site I’ve been able to access- what a waste of 10 bucks. Anyway, let me explain. My friend, Mindy, called me last week, asking me to fly to her small town on the west coast. I met Mindy when she and I were in school together in South Carolina- Go gamecocks! I’ve been meaning to plan a facetime or maybe even meet halfway with her at one point. But no way did I want to take such a long flight. Mindy knows I am terrified of flying. When she tearfully asked- practically begged- me to come help her put the pieces back together after her sudden broken engagement, my stomach dropped and my heart started beating fast. Reluctantly, and after many more indistinguishable heartfelt wails from Mindy, I agreed to fly out. Mindy had never had the best luck with guys but I really thought she had figured it out after meeting Jeff at a garage sale. They both went to buy the same lawn gnome at the same time. They ended up agreeing to split custody and the rest is history. As I booked my ticket, my palms already slick with apprehension, I wondered what went wrong. Did he cheat? He didn’t see the type. Cold feet? The guy is a city planner and no stranger to commitment, hence getting a girl’s number to maintain his lawn gnome.

Being the good friend I am, I locked in my flight- a straight shot at least- and started my typical response of anxiously ruminating on it. I’m not sure if anyone can relate, but I have a pretty intense fear of flying. I’m talking gripping the seat, praying to every god and devil you’ve ever heard of, and sweating more than you thought humanly possible. I’ve had to fly a handful of times- for a job interview, a wedding, and once for a dog’s birthday. I won’t lie- I had to borrow half of a buddy’s valium to get through that last one.

This morning- wow, was it really just this morning?- I checked in early and started my deep breathing exercises in the gate. I like to sit facing the plane. You know how they say never to turn your back on an enemy. I visualized a safe smooth flight as I sipped my overly expensive airport coffee. Decaff to compensate for the adrenaline. I sent Mindy a friendly text letting her know I would be there tonight, along with a hug emoji. She thumbs up the message. Surprisingly, she’s been radio silent about the whole thing. I guess she wants to wait and talk about it in person.

Just as I felt myself adjusting to being in the gate, an announcement blared over the speakers. “Attention travelers, Flight \*redacted\* is no longer boarding on schedule. Please see gate agent for more information”. At least, I think that’s what it said. I had my headphones in, listening to a meditation specifically for waiting for your flight.

Fast forward to this evening, my flight boarded just as the sun was setting. As I walked to my seat, I couldn’t help but think that was a bad sign. I anxiously looked for my seat number and found it- directly on top of the wings. After lots of anxious flights, I learned that you feel less turbulence if you sit there. I took my seat by the window and looked out at the wing, hoping no one would sit by me. Those hopes were dashed when a young guy with dark hair and over-the-ear headphones sat down in the aisle seat. He looked half asleep already and I wondered if he was also here early this morning. We exchanged polite nods as he set his carry-on bag on the floor in front of his seat. He put his laptop on the seat between us and told me he didn’t think we would have another passenger there. I sighed in relief. I’d love the extra elbow room and privacy.

I put my own headphones on and went back to my breathing. I couldn’t help but assess my surroundings, even though I don’t know shit about planes. My eyes were drawn to the duct tape on the wings and the fading paint, which (along with some well-placed bird poop) made the numbers 688 look more like 666. I rolled my eyes. Even I couldn’t go along with my own thoughts about how that must be a sign. I wiped my palms on my sweats- because for real, who is wearing jeans for a cross country flight?- and looked around at my fellow passengers. Lots of calm, disgruntled faces. An older couple sat a few rows up and a middle-aged couple with a baby behind them. I’m sure most folks wouldn’t like to see that, but I always feel a little safer with a baby on board. Like whatever cosmic force exists will let me survive this flight if there’s a little baby involved. I smiled when the baby looked at me and it gave me a gummy smile back. Cool- seems like the baby is on my plan for appeasing greater forces with its presence.

I noticed two flight attendants whispering to one another and grimaced. I read to practice looking at the flight crew for signs of distress and I already didn’t like this. The head flight attendant already gave me a smile that seemed to stretch way too far when she greeted me. I examined the two flight attendants’ posture- looking for signs of distress- before I realized I also don’t know shit about body language either. Wait a second, was that a bruise on her wrist? And a cut on the eye brow of the other Flight attendant? My thoughts raced with images of FAs being held hostage and forced to fly us somewhere or take us hostage. I glanced at my seatmate, he was scrolling reddit and chewing gum loudly. Across the aisle, an older man snored through the safety presentation. I swear, I ‘m envious of everyone who can sleep on a planet. No one seemed worried about the flight so far. I reminded myself that planes travel safely all the time and a lot of people bruise easily.

I took note of the inflatable vest near me and the exit row, while my seatmate pulled up his Netflix account on his laptop. I closed my eyes during take off and counted, trying desperately to not hyperfocus on the acceleration. Eventually, the seat belt light went off and I nervously undid mine. I could feel my face turning pale with anxiety and had some trouble controlling my breathing. I gestured to my seatmate to let me past and made my way to the bathroom. This is huge progress, by the way.  I splashed cold water on my face and used the naming things you can see as a grounding technique my therapist recommended. The mirror, the toilet, a little soap dispenser. I noticed a small scrap of paper tucked under the mirror. Curiosity and an intense desire for a distraction go the best of me and I worked it out from behind the mirror.

It was a faded newspaper article. The journal’s name sounded like gibberish and didn’t bring back any results when I looked it up and reverse image searched it. It had a picture of a plane, looking slightly ominous with a stormy background. Wait a second, the numbers on the wing were the same, 688. This was an article about this plane. It was really faded but I was able to make out a few lines. “Strange phenomenon” “rules must be followed” “grave consequences” “cannot be trusted”. My eyes grew wide. What the actual hell. I’ve been sweating in my seat and flinching at every bit of turbulence ever since. Google hasn’t helped at all. I’ve read over the paper repeatedly. I’m not sure what this means. Hell, I don’t even know if I count myself lucky or cursed to have found it.  Is this plane cursed? Is it haunted? What are the rules? I could really use some outside perspective. Are there any more seasoned travelers out there that can decipher this mess for me?
