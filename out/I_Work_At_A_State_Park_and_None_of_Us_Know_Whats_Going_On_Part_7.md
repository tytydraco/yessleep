Part 6: https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/s/Mih3KxKUHs 

Things are really ramping up here at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. The weather is getting warmer and that means people want to get outside more. That’s one of the great things about RLHSP, it’s outside. The park gets busier by the day. In the off season we run anywhere from seven to zero people a day entering the park. Once the weather warms up though we might get anywhere between fifty and a hundred people in the park in a single day. During the Summer months it's not uncommon to get even two hundred people here. 

I always get a little nervous this time of year. More people in the park means that there are more chances for something bad to happen. On top of your typical outdoor hazards, falling rocks, steep ravines, deep waters, snakes, bees, etc, we have a whole host of other, not so natural, hazards that our park visitors might face. 

Thankfully Ricky, the plesiosaur that lives in the lake, is a little bit shy, and he doesn’t make too many appearances. I myself have only seen the beast once. But of course there is the squirrel pile, which is unavoidable, but tends to get larger this time of year; more foot traffic seems to stir the squirrels up and they jump off of that cliff in greater numbers. That always seems to freak everyone out. Sometimes we have to clean up the pile everyday this time of year, normally that is only a once a week kind of job. 

Things like the Squirrel Pile aren’t really harmful though, unless someone just so happens to be standing right under the exact spot where the squirrels jump from, in which case there might be some problems. But generally speaking that doesn’t happen, at least not that I have heard of. Really it’s the unpredictable things, those strange anomalies that just kind of happen, without any warning, those are the things I worry about. The Pines area in the North with its expanding and contracting trails kind of worries me. People can be lost for days or weeks without even knowing it. Sometimes those weird time dilations happen outside of the Pines too. Then of course there’s this giant tentacled thing in the lake. It has already caused us some serious issues during the off season. Now that the park is getting busier I worry that we will see an influx of problems involving that slimy suction cupped creep. The worst part of it is that none of us that work here have ever really even seen the thing. I think the only good look at it that any of us has gotten was a few months back when it took out that fishing boat and Phil sent me to get the harpoon. I only saw a tentacle, Phil said he saw at least four tentacles. If anyone has seen more of it they have either kept their mouth shut about it or they didn’t live long enough to tell anyone. 

Since we’ve been getting more folks coming in and we expect the numbers to keep growing we don’t really get to move at our normal leisurely pace around the park anymore. We’re real busy here cleaning up picnic areas and campsites, cleaning debris off of trails, and getting all of the “ABSOLUTELY NO HIKING BEYOND THIS POINT” signs up in the appropriate places. Also, due to the last two encounters there Phil has, rather intelligently might I add, decided to close off the Rosemary Mine for the season. The Screams are just too frequent anymore and I’m not sure Jordan has really gotten over his encounter with…whatever it was down there. Not to mention that ghost boy that led me on that wild goose chase. 

A few days ago I took one of the park's boats out on the lake, to do a sort of rough inventory of the amount of fish we had in the lake. The boat was equipped with all of the typical boating equipment; extra paddles, gas for the motor, life jackets, fish finder, harpoon, dynamite. The fish finder comes in handy for more than just fish finding. Say for instance we’ve got a report of someone missing on the lake. That fish scanner is remarkably good at detecting bodies. Thankfully none of us park staff ever have to fish anyone up off of the bottom of the lake. These men in suits come out and take care of that. That’s only happened twice since I’ve been here though. Thank God.

That particular day though I was out scanning, looking at all the fish that we had on that little finder screen, when, while on the North side of the lake, I heard someone calling my name. I didn’t recognize the voice at first, but as I moved closer to the shore I saw that it was Ellen. She was standing beneath a Pine tree right at the shoreline waving to me. I pulled the boat up close and tried to talk to her. She had this big stupid smile on her face and I thought maybe the crows had said something funny to her and she wanted to let me in on the joke. 

“Hey James,” she said as I pulled up, still smiling ear to ear.

“Hey Ellen. Something funny?” I said, beginning to smile myself.

“Nope! Just happy to see you!” She replied.

“Well then, care to join me? I’m checking the fish population right now.”

“I’d love to!” She said nearly jumping up and down with excitement.

Sure I thought it was odd, Ellen is never this interested in me, but part of me thought that my unparalleled charm had finally started to get to her. She climbed in the boat and sat in the passenger seat. I took off again and began checking that scanner looking at all the little red blobs that are supposedly fish. 

Then the whole screen went red. I thought maybe it had broken or something. Ellen said something under her breath. I’m not sure what it was, she wasn’t even looking at the screen. It didn’t quite sound like English but I didn’t ask. The screen was red for quite a while. We had made it a little closer to the West shore of the lake before anything happened, the giant red spot had finally gone away, and then it happened.

A gigantic tentacle shot out of the water and towered, what I figured to be, about twenty feet above us. It lingered there, sticking out of the lake like a blasphemous tower, and then, and very suddenly, it came down. It narrowly missed the boat but the resulting tidal wave flipped us sideways and sent the boat down to Hornberry’s Locker. Ellen and I began to swim frantically for the shore. If that thing, that tentacled beast, really wanted to, it could have drug us under. I think it was playing with us, or maybe it just doesn’t like boats. I’m not terribly sure, and if my training at RLHSP has taught me anything at all, it’s that I shouldn’t think about it too long. 

Nevertheless, Ellen and I made it to shore safe and sound. When at last I had caught my breath I stood and watched the boat's propeller sink beneath the waves, buried in a dirge of bubbles.

“Hey, my cabin’s not too far from here, let’s get up there and get dry huh?” I said to Ellen, who herself was just standing there, staring out at the lake. Her smile had now settled into a blank emotionless expression. 

“Yes, sounds good.” She said dryly, even though I watched her face contort into an awkward smile once again. 

So we hiked up the short hill which led to an old service road that eventually winds its way down to my cabin. Ellen didn’t talk the whole way there, even though I tried to start a conversation. I tried a few times actually, but nothing got through. 

We got to my cabin and I pointed her towards the bathroom and told her that she could get dried off first. 

“Okay,” was her emotionless reply, though she still had that freaky smile on her face. 

When she finally stepped out of the bathroom she seemed normal again. Her smile felt more genuine and she stopped with the dry or overly enthusiastic answers. Feeling comfortable once again I thought I’d try to lay the charm down thick. 

“You like popcorn?” I said suavely. 

“Oh I love it!” She replied.

So I put a couple bags of corn in the microwave and waited for them to pop. While waiting I walked over to my tv and looked for a movie to put on. I settled on Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The one from the 50s. I love old sci fi horror movies. 

With corn popped and the invasion starting, Ellen and I sat down on my couch to enjoy the evening. I must say I was rather surprised at just how flirty she was being. She plopped down right next to me, and over the course of the movie slowly maneuvered her way under my right arm. I was so excited and nervous that I completely ignored the fact that this was a major warning sign. Ellen is never like this, and definitley not with me. 

The next thing I knew I was woken up by the sound of my cabin door slamming into the inside wall. I didn’t even realize I was asleep. Invasion of the Body Snatcher’s was nearly over and I could see by the window that it was dark outside. Ellen was asleep now too, head on my chest. All of this I took in in that brief flash of a second when I spun my head to see who had just barged into my cabin. To my utter horror, it was Ellen. 

I looked at her standing at the door, covered in rain drops. Of course it was raining again, seems to rain a lot here at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. She had a gun drawn and was breathing heavily. Then I looked down at her asleep on my chest.

I gave Ellen, the one standing at the door, a horrified look, but I still attempted some kind of communication. 

The woman standing at the door was undoubtedly Ellen. When I looked at her it was obvious. It was like the woman I'd been hanging out with all day just hadn't been quite right, and now, when I saw the real thing, it all clicked. The Ellen on my couch, her face, her mannerisms, they weren't right, they hadn't been right all day. The stupid smile, that emotionless stare. It all made sense. But now that the horror of my situation had been fully revealed to me, I didn't know what to do. If I moved, the thing on my couch, that looked like Ellen, might wake up. 

The real Ellen crept over to the back of the couch. She held a finger over her lips. Then, very quickly she grabbed the fake her by the hair, I moved my arm, she pulled the imposter across the couch. I shot up out of my seat and watched as the real Ellen put a pillow over the fake Ellen's face, cocked her gun, and then shot her.

The thing thrashed and flailed for a while. All the time letting out this inhuman, I dare say otherworldly scream, and then it was silent. The silence slowly engulfed the room and I could now hear the pitter patter of rain on the roof of my cabin. 

Now that it was at last safe to speak Ellen and I looked at each other. I'm normally pretty tongue tied around her, but this time I honestly could not think of what to say. 

“Uh….” I got out at last.

“Yeah, tell me about it.” Ellen said.

“What is going on?” I asked.

“That thing, that thing with my face, there's several of them, or well…there were several of them. Not all with my face of course. There was one for all of us. That was the last one though. I've been dispatching them all day.”

“But, but, how did you…uh…how did you figure that out?” I asked.

“Because you called me this afternoon.”

“What? I didn't call you. I don't even have your number!”

“Exactly!” 

“I'm not following though, how did that tip you off to all of this?” 

“Well I'm sitting at home right? Cause you know, everyone got a week off. I'm sitting there watching a movie, when I get a call, unknown number, and when I answer, it's you. You wanted me to come down to the park and help you with something. I just mentioned to you that it was my week off and I'd deal with it when I came back to work. Then I paused for a moment and asked how you got my number. You said that I had given it to you. But I never have given you my number. I knew something was off so I drove up here. I got here just in time to see you take off on the boat out into the lake. But like ten minutes later you came walking up to me in the parking lot by the lodge. But my God, it wasn't you. It wasn't right. You had such a stupid smile on your face, and you didn't stutter even once. I asked you a few other telling personal questions, you failed that test. So...I shot you.”

“What about all the other ones?” I asked her.

“Yes, okay, so there was a Richard, an Aaron, and a Jordan. They've all got the week off too so I knew it wasn't really them. I really don't know what they are, but I knew there had to be a clone of all of us. Didn't see a Phil though. Doesn't matter, I've been hunting myself all night. I had a suspicion, so I came up here.”

“Oh my God. That's just, I don't even know.” I stammered out.

“Yeah well, thanks to me, ‘I’ didn't kill you in your sleep.” 

“Yeah, thanks for that,” I stood scratching my head staring at the bloodless body on the floor. As I watched it it shriveled into an Ellen raisin, and then it just kind of evaporated. 

“They all did that.” Ellen said as though it was completely normal. 

I began to wonder how this little episode might affect my relationship with my coworker. Not to mention how Ellen might feel seeing everyone back at work in a few days. I mean, she had just shot all of them.

Ellen was gracious enough not to mention that I had just been on a quasi date with her doppelganger. 

“So,” I began. “Would you like some popcorn?”

“Hah! Yeah right. I would like some sleep.” Ellen proceeded to lay down on my couch and was asleep almost as soon as her head touched the arm rest. 

Needless to say I didn't sleep a wink that night. Trust me after a few years working at this place, it takes a lot to keep me from falling asleep. I spent most of the night sitting up in my bed, pistol in hand, staring at the back of my couch. Two doppelgangers of the same person would be ridiculous. But at RLHSP, nothing is impossible. We outta make that a slogan. 

It wasn't another doppelganger though. Ellen woke up around 7 in the morning.

“Oh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sleep here all night.” 

“It's no problem," I said, looking back at her with what I was sure were bloodshot and heavily bagged eyes.

She sleepily left my cabin and as soon as she closed the door behind her I collapsed into the warm embrace of sleep. 

I woke up the following day to Phil knocking at my door.

“Where on Earth have you been kid?” I could hear him yelling from the other side of the door. 

“Right here old timer!” I yelled back.

Right here, at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. Where nothing is impossible.

We hope you'll come and visit sometime

Until then,

James
