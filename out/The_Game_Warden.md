Jerry and his wife were going through a nasty divorce. She turned the kids against him and was gonna end up with the house. He’s been my best friend since elementary school and I’ve been letting him crash at my place. I suggested that we go trout fishing. 

Fishing really does something good for the soul. It’s amazing to be out in nature and tune out of everyday life. It also brings a lot of respect for wildlife when you understand where your food comes from and you’re the one cleaning out the insides. 

We woke up early and poured coffee in our styrofoam cups. I grabbed plenty of gear out of my shed and away we went. The drive up was quiet and peaceful.

We parked at a tiny parking area and made our way across the road to go through the woods. This Carolina weather was rather cold today. I didn’t think we’d catch anything really.

We crossed through until we found a stream I always considered our honey hole. We casted our lines and reeled them in slowly .

My salmon eggs were working better than usual. I pulled in a huge rainbow trout. Jerry took a picture because I put my stringer through it. As soon as I put on another egg, he came.

I looked up and across the bank was a park ranger standing there. I think it was a park ranger at least. But his eyes seemed about double the size of most and they were widened. He also had a big smile across his face.

“Stay right there, gentleman.”  He walked across the freezing knee deep water towards us without any acknowledgement of how cold it had to be. 

“See you already caught something.” 

“Yes sir.” 

“I’m sure you boys have a fishing license on you.” I swear I never seen him blink.

“I do.” I reached into my vest and handed him mine.”

“I see. It says it expires in six days.”

“I’ll make sure to get it renewed.”

“I’m sure you will. What about you bubba?”

Jerry became nervous. “I don’t have one, I’ll get one for next time.” 

“No need for that!” He picked up a rock and hit Jerry across the head. I freaked out and stood in shock as he dragged him to the water to push him under. 

I screamed “get off him!” He wouldn’t listen. I pulled out my grandpas fishing knife and stabbed him in the back. He back handed me and it knocked me down hard. 

He stood up and glanced at my fishing pole. “You can’t use that kind of bait this time of year!” He reached behind him and pulled out the knife and threw it down.

“Stay there! You’re next!”

He turned back to Jerry and began to push his head back under. I watched as Jerry’s arms squirmed and tried to fight back. He eventually quit moving.

“If you can respect the fish, then you’ll learn to be one.” Jerry’s body began to shrink and he swam away as a rainbow trout.

The man turned back to me. “Alright, it’s your turn. You’ll learn to love being a fish. Just don’t get caught.” His smile never went away.

I stood back up and grabbed the knife.

“Now you know that don’t work.” He let out a chuckle.
 
I had no idea what to do, I just ran towards the road as fast as I could. I ran through ticket and thorns and prayed I was faster than whatever he was.

I seen a truck on the road passing by slowly and I jumped in the back. I screamed for them to slam on the gas. I looked up and the thing was peaking through the woods. 

The driver of the truck pulled up by the visitors center. They would never believe me when I told them what happened. I just told a lie and said a rabbit fox was after me. 

It’s truly broke my heart that Jerry’s family hasn’t asked about him or sent out a search party. 

All I know is that I’m never fishing again. And I strongly encourage those in here that do to follow the regulations. I won’t be sleeping anytime soon.
