Hi, I'm Jack, and I don't know why I'm not dead yet.

I've contemplated this reality for too long now. Too long that sometimes I actually see myself in a grave, feel the pressure of dirt over my body, the absolute silence and darkness of nowhere and nothing beyond.

I've come to consider that lack of death as an actual curse after the events with Todd — you probably don't know who Todd is, and it's not quite relevant, or maybe it is? 
Let me introduce Todd to you anyway.

Todd turned out to be the neighbor in the next cell to mine, for the lack of better word to describe the place. For too long I'd thought that those scratchy noises coming off the wall separating the two cells, joined by a labored wet breathing, were those of a dog. But on the fifth day since I'd started hearing them — or maybe longer? I've lost track of time entirely — I heard a wet thing being pulled out of a gurgling mouth, then came the violent, frantic gasps for air. 

Someone had been gagged deeply. How stupid of me that I couldn't figure it out sooner. Maybe because up until then, no one bothered to gag me yet.

The gasps turned into whimpers of a man, who then screamed. For a while the screams just increased in volume and length that I thought they'd never stop, until they did. The abrupt silence that followed was just as bad.

I tried to breathe steadily, to calm my frantic mind. Okay, that man there seemed in way too much shit than me. At least I was just kept chained up at all times — yes it hurt like hell, being tightly wrapped and suspended by chains, but at least no fucking chocking over a gag and scratching hysterically then screaming my head off.

I think I differed off right after that, or just lost consciousness? Sure there were times when I was just asleep, and they could not have just kept me suspended like that without a break, right? It'd have killed me, so I thought maybe when I fainted that was when they'd come and free me, then suspend me again before I woke up?

How did they time it up? When was I being fed, or any other human physiological activity? I didn't know, and after a while, I didn't even care.
I just wanted to know which direction I faced at least. And sure as hell I wanted to know why they kept me thirsty all the goddamn time? Apparently I had water regularly, and there was no hunger, so what was with water? And why the total darkness?
But mine was a small space, that was for sure. The proximity of Todd's sounds told me that much.

It took me a long time until I mustered the courage to finally whisper, "Hello?"
It came out weak, strained from intense pain, and echoed strangely, bouncing off the thin walls too many times than necessary. I cringed at that. Up until now, and ever since it all had started, I didn't once try to speak. I didn't even know why.

"Hello?" The man in the next door cell mirrored me.
I kept silent after that, mostly because the surreal nature of my conditions didn't make me expect he'd really answer, and we'd really have a conversation.

"I'm Jack."
"And I'm Todd."
"How are you?"
Now I know you'd tell me that this wasn't the best question to ask under such circumstances, nor the most important one, but let me assure you that it was all that I had on my mind then. It soothed me, even.

"Your pain is evident." He replied in an eerily calm tone, though he seemed like he was slightly panting. I suppose from his recent ordeal.
"Is that.. good or bad?" Because, what else to say to that, huh?
"I think it's good and bad. Because they won't let you go until you're in pain, but then you'll just upgrade when you get to the perfect degree of pain."
What the hell was that supposed to mean?

When I kept silent, he went on, "I haven't heard you at all during my time here. I thought the room next to mine was empty."
"I.. I don't know why I didn't make a sound."
"It's fine. Most people get confused and turned around. I've seen worse."
"Who are you?" I was aware now of how really slow my mind was.
"No, It's not who I'm, but what. I've become something else."

I flinched, and my pain intensified gradually, and remarkably, right after that. I got the impression that there was something more to it than the aftereffect of moving suddenly, like I was being deliberately punished.
I couldn't scream, though. Not just didn't want to like I'd previously thought the case was. Now I was completely unable to scream. Now I know for sure I was being punished.

Why? How? I didn't know, didn't care for anything but for it to stop.
It stopped, mostly because I think I just fainted.
And when I woke up again, Todd was gone, and the gates of Hell bursted open.
