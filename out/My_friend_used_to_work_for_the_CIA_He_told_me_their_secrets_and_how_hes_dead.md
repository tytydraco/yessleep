**Update #1:** [The Wisteria Program](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zwquzy/what_the_cia_doesnt_want_you_to_know_the_wisteria)

I never thought the internet could be so dangerous. I always assumed it was just a tool for communication and entertainment, a way to connect with people from all over the world. But I was wrong.

It started with a message from an unknown sender. They called themselves "The Watcher," and claimed to have information about the CIA's secret operations. I was skeptical at first, but the more I read, the more I realized this was no joke.

The Watcher claimed to have hacked into the CIA's servers, and had access to classified documents, videos, and audio recordings. They offered to share this information with me, but only if I agreed to follow their instructions.

The Watcher's instructions were simple: follow the links and files they sent me, and share the information with as many people as possible. They wanted me to be their messenger, to spread the truth about the CIA's secret operations and expose the corruption within the organization.

At first, I was tempted to ignore the message and move on with my life. But the thought of uncovering the truth about the CIA's secrets was too tempting to resist. So I agreed to play along, and The Watcher began sending me files and links to follow.

As I delved deeper into the world of the CIA, I began to realize that everything I thought I knew was a lie. The Watcher showed me evidence of secret experiments, illegal surveillance, and even murder. It was like I was living in a real-life conspiracy theory.

But the more I learned, the more I realized that I was in over my head. The Watcher seemed to know everything about me, including when I got home and when I was on my computer, and I began to suspect that they were watching my every move. I started receiving strange packages in the mail, and my phone was constantly ringing with unknown numbers.

I knew I had to do something before it was too late. So I decided to go to the authorities and report everything I had learned. But when I tried to go to the police, I was stopped by a group of men in suits who claimed to be from the CIA. They told me that I was in danger and that they were there to protect me.

But I didn't trust them. I knew they were lying — they had done it before. So I ran. I ran as fast as I could, with the men in suits hot on my heels. I knew I had to get as far away from them as possible.

As I ran, I kept thinking about The Watcher. Who were they, and why were they doing this to me? I knew I had to find them and get some answers.

I spent the next few weeks on the run, hiding in cheap motels and trying to stay one step ahead of the CIA. They were smart, but I knew their secrets. I knew the strategies they used, where they would look first, and even *what* they would do to me if they caught me. It was a dangerous game, but I was determined to stay alive.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I stumbled upon a clue that led me to The Watcher's true identity. It was someone I never would have suspected – someone I thought I knew and trusted. My childhood best friend — a janitor at a nearby high school. Or so I thought.

I confronted them, demanding to know why they had dragged me into this mess. And that's when they revealed the truth.

He had actually been a former undercover CIA agent, tasked with investigating the recruitment efforts of international terrorist organizations. He had quit though, after discovering the agency's egregious offenses and joined The Watcher. The Watcher was actually a group of former CIA agents who had grown disillusioned with the agency's secret operations. They had hacked into the CIA's servers in an attempt to expose the truth and bring down the corrupt organization. And somehow, they had chosen me to be their messenger.

I was shocked and overwhelmed by this revelation. I didn't know what to do. On the one hand, I was relieved that The Watcher was not a malevolent force. On the other hand, I knew that by exposing the CIA's secrets, I would be putting my own life in danger.

In the end, I made the decision to go public with the information. I knew it was the right thing to do, even if it meant risking everything.

As I stood on the steps of the courthouse, ready to reveal the truth about the CIA to the press conference The Watcher had arranged, I knew I was taking a huge risk. I had no idea how the agency would react, or what they might do to retaliate (they had tried to kill me already).

But I was ready. I had spent weeks on the run, dodging the CIA and uncovering the truth about their secrets. And now, it was time for the world to know the truth.

I stepped up to the microphone, my hands shaking as I began to speak. I told the reporters about The Watcher, about the hacked files and documents, and about the illegal activities the CIA had been involved in. I saw faces of shock, jaws dropping, as reporters quickly scribbled down notes.

I had done it. Despite the cost and my now probably-impending death, I had brought justice and exposed the corruption of America's worst agency.

Yet, the next day, it was business as normal. No reports in the newspapers. No widespread protests. Not even a single tweet about what I had exposed just the day before.

Huh? What had happened?

I quickly scrambled into my car, and drove to the office of my local newspaper--one I was *certain* had been at the conference yesterday. And yet, it seemed no one had any recollection of what had happened. The reporting team who had apparently left on a job the day before was missing — no phone calls, no emails, not a trace. No leads or bodies, but I knew what had happened.

I went online, trying to get a hold of The Watcher. But they too, had mysteriously disappeared. Profile gone, erased from the internet, along with the files and messages I had been sent. Dead, I presumed.

Everyone involved had mysteriously disappeared, including my childhood friend, whose number now rang a dead tone. Everyone except for me.

Why did the CIA leave me alive? Maybe because they felt that I couldn't do anything by myself. No one would believe, without any evidence. I was just another off-the-rails anarchist, maybe a Russian spy bent on destroying the institutions of justice. I was harmless. Or so they think.

But I still have the knowledge of all the horrible crimes and files I was shown. I can still share them, with those that choose to believe me. And so, if you choose to believe my story, saddle along, because it's going to be a helluva a ride.
