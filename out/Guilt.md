I never understood how free and liberated one could feel till they would realize the comfort that exists in loneliness. You are free, you can do whatever the hell you want to. And I had been living in that liberty for so long.

 

Who was the last person that I truly gave a shit about? I think and I do not know. Their face, their memory…everything else other than present has become so faded.  
  
  
Fighting in the war back in ‘44 and then coming back home to see everyone having moved on from any hopes of seeing me was the last straw that led me to believe that nobody’s truly worth a shit and that you were born alone, naked and you die alone taking nothing with yourself and nobody, alone is the thing I have been saying to everyone.  
  
  
Now I am old and wrinkled and have been living alone till they picked me from the streets and threw me in this home. And not like other lonely geezers, I will not say I wish I had someone…at least a family. I still stand by the liberty that comes along with having nobody to care for at least that’s what I think till I remember something.  
  
  
  
  
And now as I am writing this, closer to death than ever. I think of what **he** had said to me **that night** more and more. It makes me confused, it makes me wonder what the true is and what is the false. But one thing it always makes sure making me feel is **guilt.**  
  
  
But the truth of it all is I live in a deep regret and that regret tells me that I do not deserve of anything. And it is why I have found peace amongst the liberty that comes with loneliness, it is just that I do not think I deserve of anything else other than death.  
  
  
  
I have had this longing for death since before the incident, before the war. I do not know why but I could not pull the trigger to the eternal void. That is fine. That is the way of how it is sometimes and I know there are many like me.

 

 In ’59 though, that was when I got closest to death with my suicidal tendencies. After feeling worthless for so long I had finally decided to end it all by drowning myself on an evening of autumn ’59.  
  
  
  


There were many beaches back in my day before the seas dried out and houses were planted everywhere. We used to sleep on those beaches and we called them the playground of this world. Coney Island was one of those beaches.  
  
  
  
  
I was drunk, out of my mind and angry as usual. Coney Island was where I had decided to end it all and I was firm about it.  
  
  
  
I entered the beach with a bottle of beer and high on some pot. They played a lot of Elvis in radio back then and I was bummed out because I had forgotten to bring a mini radio player to the beach. I loved Elvis Presley and wanted to listen Jailhouse Rock one last time before I would lose myself into the water.  
  
Air was salty and the winds were as strong as they could be in autumn. Moon glowed brighter than the sun at the moment and the water shined brighter than the streetlights. It was like a beautiful painting. I finished my beer and then threw away its bottle and sat down near the water.  
  
  
  


 

 

Just looking at the sea for a while, it was hard to not admire how beautiful the world looked sometimes. That image to me is still clear. Strong sea breeze flew back my hair, my shirt and nothing could have been a more perfect moment than now to light a cigarette. Fortunately enough for me I had taken my half-finished pack of Marlboro Red along.  
  
  
I lit up a cigarette and looked at the world ahead of me, how beautiful, how pristine it was. Those Marlboros were very strong and I could feel the smoke touching the walls of my lungs in each puff. I remember thinking about an old girlfriend of mine during that time, I wonder where she is at now? Is she even alive? We separated before the war and I hadn’t seen her ever since then. Well I still have not.  
  
  
After some time doing nothing but gazing the sea, I heard footsteps. They were coming from my right and they were slow, sound footsteps and whoever it was that was coming towards me was walking very close to the water.  
  
  
I closely heard the footsteps but I was unfazed by it… till a kid walked up to me.

 

That kid looked hardly above 7 or 8 and he wearing a very old looking t-shirt with black stains and shorts and boots. Think of the poor kids they used for awareness against chimney sweeper kids, this kid had that exact look. He looked hungry. With his dirty little hands, he wiped his nose. His face also had black stains but at the same time, he looked….oddly familiar. *Where have I seen him?*  I thought.  
  
“Are you hungry?” I asked.  
  
“Can I smoke one?” He replied.  
  
I was surprised at first, what kind of kid asks for cigarette an adult. In fact I felt bad for the kid. I wanted to buy some food for him.  
  
“Let’s go, you look hungry. I’ll get you a slice of pizza.”  
  
“No” He replied.  
  
“**He** asked me to stay here. He said this place is safe” He added. This tone he spoke with, this was also familiar. This wasn’t how most kids spoke here nor adults. But I could not tell where it was from. It was almost as if he dug out a small fabric of my memory.  
  
“Who will?” I asked with a slight confusion.    
  
He pointed at the right, from where he came.  
  
I looked there and at far right I saw a large building that looked at least a hundred years old. I had never noticed that building in Coney Island before. At its roof there stood a flag and it was waving against the wind. The building was strangely captivating and I wanted to keep looking at it… as if it was a reflection of myself. I do not understand why …. But that is exactly how I felt at the time. And the most captivating part of it all was the metal door that was beneath the building. It was where the boy pointed at. ‘Where did it lead to? And why was it there?’ I thought, completely puzzled.  
  
“Who is there boy?” I asked.  
   
“mm. It’s him, he takes c..are of.”  
  
The kid was already smoking a cigarette.  
  
“It’s bad manners to steal, did **he** not teach you?”  
  
“No… he is my friend. He is good to me, he says the Coney Island is all mine when it’s the night.”  
  
“And where are your parents?” I asked.  
  
“I don’t know, who?” He replied. *What does he mean by who?*  
  
  
“Your parents? Your dad? Your mom?” I added.  
  
  
“I don’t know.” He replied. After saying so, he stood up and destroyed the half lit cigarette with his boot. Then he went and faced towards the sea making the moon shine at his face. It looked as if I was in his shade. His blonde, dirty hair flew against the wind, towards the east but it did not matter. The boy looked ethereal and I was beneath him.  
  
*Where have I seen this face before?*  I thought.  
  
  
“Follow me.” The boy said.  
  
Then he gave his hand for me to hold. His hands were soft, warm but I could not feel his heartbeat. I could feel a strong sense of his presence but I still felt like he was not there. Holding my hand, he took us to the building and with each step the moonlight grew dimmer than before.  
  
  
We both were in silence, with our mouths shut till he broke it. “I have the key” he said.  
  
“Open it then.” I replied.  
  
My heart was starting to race quite a bit by now. *What was inside the door? Is it my death? Did I die already?*  These unanswered questions wandered across my mind in a fury till he opened the door and held by hand again.  
  
  
Room was dark.  
  
And inside it was not warm, neither was it cold. It was just very perfect, everything about it. The solitude inside resonated with me and I felt like if this truly was the end, the end of it all. It is what I exactly want. This is death.  
  
I was in a short, perfect peace till the stillness of room settled over me like a heavy fog. I could not see the boy however I could feel his presence…lingering, watching.  
  
  
Then suddenly I saw a small ray of light at the top-right corner of room. As if the ray looked at me, I tried to look at it back…talk with it. Before I could think of anything, there were multiple little pockets of light in the room… then the whole room lit up.  
  
  
Finally I could see something. *This is not death.*  I thought.  
  
Ahead of me there was a man who wore the same American Army uniform I wore into the war. He had same build as me, same hair and in fact even same tattoo that I have at my nape.

 

  
  
*That’s me, that has to be me.*    
  
But he did not turn towards me, as if he did not see me. I was not there in his world. I was just a bystander, watching. And the kid was watching me, probably.  
  
With a rifle on his hand, **he** kept running towards somewhere.  
  
And I followed him. Then we reached a village, with every step, my memory got clearer and clearer and my heart felt the heaviness that surrounded with coming back of this memory. This was the German hills, this was the Hürtgen, the last place where I thought I had a purpose but my soul touched the cruel, shitty mud.  
  
*But who is the kid?*  
  
Then the man I followed, my own self asked for everyone in the village to come out and make a circle. We were asked by our generals to kill everyone in the forests other than our own allies and the ***kids.***

 

*NO* I cried out internally.  
  
“You’ll WATCH.” The kid spoke.  
  
I was in terror, not of the kid but of myself. Then **myself** asked everyone in the village to make a circle but one family refused to come out of their house.  
  
“Come. OUT” **I** said.

Then the family from inside replied “NO, DON’T KILL US.”  
It was a woman who spoke, her voice was trembling with fear, perhaps knowing of what was coming for her.  
  
  
I was at tears, how could I have done that? I was thinking. I wanted to run from the place now.  
  
  
Afterwards a little boy wearing a dirty t-shirt and shorts goes running towards my past, the evil man who I was watching, myself.  
  
  
It was him. Now my memory was clear, of who this kid was.  
  
  
**NO, I DON’T WANT TO WATCH THIS ANYMORE.**  I screamed again but I could not refute myself from watching the sight unfolding next to me.  
  
Perhaps it was my own body working against my mind, or maybe it was all the souls that I wronged that were pushing me to look forward. But I could not look away.  
  
  
In the same thick accent from before, the boy says “Are you from America?”  
  
“Yes”  
  
“Tell me about it.”  
  
My other colleagues were laughing and so was my past, it was a pity laugh or whatever it was.  
  
  
“It’s beautiful kid. There’s Coney Island. We call it the playground of the world.” I had replied.  
  
  
  
The light went out inside the building again. It was not necessary for me to see the obvious after this.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
In the darkness **he, the kid** then sang  
  


“You won’t get to be here  
 in this place  
 the place we call the peace  
 where there is nothing but darkness  
 but for someone like you  
 lies what is outside  
 guilt, regret and suffering  
 and for all the atonement  
 It still won’t be enough.  
 and you won’t get to be here  
 in this place  
 the place we call the peace”  
  
  
  
This poem still has not left my mind, the voice, the incident is as clear as it was and this has been the life that I have lived.
