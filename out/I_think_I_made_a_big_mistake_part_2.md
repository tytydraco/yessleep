I think I made a big mistake.. update part 2

So I told yall about the haunted tour in New Orleans  in [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/71E1Q9XoZv)

Well we went to the police. We told them everything and even showed them the video. They said they would look into it. But I don't think they believed us. I heard one of them day something about me looking like i was on something. 

As we were getting ready to walk away, I was suddenly drawn to someone the police were bringing in. As soon as we locked eyes, I knew who he was immediately, and he knew I knew it was him. It was the guy that killed AJ, my friends brother. He had told told us who it was. It was like something gripped me, and I saw it happen. I saw him run up to AJ's car and drag him out. I tasted the gun powder and smelled the tires as peeled out of the parking lot, leaving AJ dying in the parking lot. I felt his pain. Then his rage. I wanted to take his life. I wanted him to feel what I felt. I wanted revenge. I could taste his blood, and it was so sweet, but I wanted his soul. I black out.

When I came to, I was in a holding cell. My hands hurt. There was blood on my clothes. My throat felt raw. What had happened? The officers said I fought and screamed like someone possessed. They tazed me three times, and it took 5 officers to pull me off the guy. But when they did, he confessed to the murder of AJ and several other unsolved cases that involved car jackings around the city.  They said I just kept staring towards the interagation room like I could see him sniffling the air until I finally passed out.  They said they believed our story and would let me go. But stay away from that area of the 9th ward. There's a reason it hasn't been rebuilt.

As we left the station,  an old lady stopped us. She told us there was some bad juju attached to us, and we needed help. She said she could see it on me. She said she knew someone down the bayou in Edgard  named Tee Nan we should go see. 

After a few tries, we finally were able to call the number she gave us.  I got so tired of ending up in that circle every time i tried to tell what was going on. Finally, Tee Nan said, "Hush child," and just gave me the directions, and we met up with this Tee Nan at midnight in the middle of a sugar cane field. When we were going, it was like a hurricane was outside. Driving down those little narrow streets with all those curves and nothing but fields around me, I wanted to turn around. My friends urged me to keep driving. We got to the house, and not a drop of rain was falling. When we got out of the car,  we could hear whispers and laughing coming from the suger cane, and we stopped and looked, but Before we could say anything, Tee Nan put her fingers on her lips shook her head no and had us step into a circular clearing with her.

Everyone seemed to just step in, but when I  crossed over into the clearing,  my skin burned like it was on fire and felt like it was being peeled off. I started having trouble breathing and started panicking. I felt like i was being held underwater. I wanted to step back,  i tried to, but the old lady and my friends pulled me through.  I was on the ground,  panting in a cold sweat. Everything hurt. I felt like soul had been ripped to pieces. I was screaming. I could feel myself shaking. I cried and prayed. I thought I was dying. 

Tee Nan and another lady that I didn't see hurried and wrapped me in a blanket they put some oils on me and helped me to a chair. I looked around in shock. I didn't see any of this before. She gave gave me some tea.

"She only let you see what you needed to see,"

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"You didn't wonder why she kept you in the circle? She pulled you across the veil. As long as you stayed in the circl,  you couldn't see through the veil. They were eating your soul.?"

"Why?"

"You're an empath. Nobody ever told you how to protect yourself child? It's always you young ones. You were lucky when they were done with you. You'd be just like these other girls walking around lost talking to ghosts. I know you heard them. Don't EVER talk back to a spirit child. You just inviting them in your head!"

She smeared some paste across my eyes. And it stung pretty bad. But when I looked up I saw that old lady and her boy and they didn't look so happy because this time they were trapped. That whole sugarcane field was a ghost trap. I saw AJ 6 he didn't look so angry he looked at peace, and he just smiled.

I asked Tee Nan what would happen to them. She said they could move on at any time. It's anger and range that keeps them here. The need for justice and revenge. The longer they stay, the harder it will be to go. Just then, there was a bright flash, and AJ disappeared. I smiled and told his sister.

Tee Nan told me salt works but that a little Mississippi mud and grave yard dirt is even better. She gave me a few bags on  pieces of leather and said to  wear one at all times. She said it was a gris gris bag. And if I need anything else, come find her. But only come on the first night of the full moon. Otherwise, if they pull me over, she couldn't bring me back. 

As I looked around,  I saw all the ghosts at the vei. There's no were so many.  How did she control them?  Would those two get out and come for me?  I couldn't leave Edgard fast enough. I started thinking about what she said about me being an empath. I didn't ask what that meant. 

Does anyone know?  I have some research to do, and I guess the next full moon I'll be driving back to Edgard.
