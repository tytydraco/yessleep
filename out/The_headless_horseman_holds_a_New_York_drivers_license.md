I’m a good driver, *most* of the time. Every morning, I adjust my rearview, keeping it square with the glass in the back. I get my brake pads changed weeks before they’re due. And I feel like a tool if I cut a turn to early and clip the center line, even a little bit.

I’d never had an accident and wore that fact on my sleeve. Accidents were awful—not just for the pain and cost involved, but for forcing strangers into your life at the worst possible moment. You never know what kind of lunatic a mere fender bender might shackle you to.

That night I found out.

I was in the parking lot of a hardware store. It was after work, and I was loading up the car with the goods from my little shopping spree. A stack of pine wood, pots of varnish, three types of nails. Everything I needed to start on the new Gazebo. I crammed the tailgate shut, missing the lack of a click, and rolled the trolley back.

As I started backing out, I realized I couldn’t see much past the planks in the back, but my reverse cam worked great, *usually,* and…

CLANG!

The rear sensors shrieked as I slammed the brake. I jumped out. Behind me there was a motorbike, black and vintage, knocked on its side.

*How the hell did that get there?*

A minute ago, the space behind me was empty, just vacant white lines. But it *was* there, although now I was really looking at it, I wasn’t exactly sure.

It was *black.* I’m not talking about some slick matte paintjob, I mean its entire surface was the darkest tone imaginable. Think the mouth of a cave. Everything, the pipes, the tires, the spokes in the wheels, just pure absence. My fingers found the little dent I’d put in its side before my eyes did, as I stroked its surface, testing its corporeality.

It was real alright, so I had to move it. I squatted down, pumping my legs a little as I expected a heavy lift. This almost had me fall on my ass. It was *light,* like it was, I dunno... *empty*. The touch of the handlebars sent goosebumps shooting up my arms.

I slid the bike out of the way, letting its non-existent weight rest on the kickstand. Then I wondered what to do.

Being such a great driver, I haven’t got my insurance details memorized, for the same reason I don’t remember how to do long division. And, it being the 21^(st) century and all, I don’t carry around a notepad and pen.

I looked around the lot, not seeing a soul. The shops had their rollers down, and there was nobody creeping about the yellow-lit aisles of the hardware store to give me dirty looks.

At that point I noticed the bike wasn’t entirely pitch-dark. Mounted above the rear wheel was a standard New York license plate. I punched the number into my phone notes. *1790.*

*Great*. Having my ways, I could at least find the owner. We’d sort it out on some sunny day, but for now I could leave. No harm, no foul.

So I didn’t feel *terrible* as I peeled onto the main road, hoping no one had seen me.

I live in a new development that lies a little far out from the highway, so the quickest way to get home is to take the back roads. But these roads are rough, flowing from tarmac to gravel to dirt. The going is lonely and bad for my tires.

The worst bit runs through a grove of trees, tall, gnarled beeches that grow into a twisted network above the road, filtering out the moonlight. The road runs along a stretch of tiny hills. As I drove along, my high beams bored into the yellow dirt on the dips and swept the treetops on the climbs.

I had the road to myself, but at the crest of every bump, I started to notice something in my side mirror. Behind me, there was a light.

Bright. Alone.

And with every bump, it was burning brighter in my mirror. My hands wound white-knuckle tight around the wheel. I knew it was the bike I knocked down, the angry owner following me home.

Trapped there in the dark, hemmed in by the gnarled trees, was the last place I wanted to have that confrontation, but there was no way around it. He’d be pissed off, might even be some violent lunatic, but I had to be a man, and own up to what I’d done. That was always my curse.

I started slowing down, looking for a gap in the tree trunks to pull over upon. But he wasn’t slowing at all. He zoomed towards me, his headlight carving up and down the slopes. 

The light was orange. A flaming amber like the mouth of a furnace. I saw the rider, barely a glimpse as he crested a bump, and he was dark, like a shadow. He was shrouded in a long, billowing sheet of leather, split into tattered fingers that fluttered behind him. 

And then I heard the sound. You’ve heard an old man wheeze before, it was like that, only magnified a hundred times. It tore through the night, tangling with the roar of the bike’s engine.

*Heeuuuuughhhhhh…*

*Screw* being a man, I thought. I put the car in gear and floored it. But even as I sped away, my mirrors were flooded with orange light. He was right beside me, the roar stinging my ears, rattling my skull.

I stole a glimpse. He was massive, clad in studded leather, sporting gloves that spanned his entire forearms, and I swear that the handlebars clutched in their grasp, were somehow also *reins*. The front of the bike was morphing, transforming into something else. A *beast.* Then he started reaching for something inside his leather mantle.

My driver’s side window shattered, spraying me with glass. I felt something long and metallic swoosh inches from my face. He had a blade, a *sword*. I could see the steel flash in amber as he wheeled it above himself, prepping another strike.

I stomped the accelerator down to the floormat, urging the car to go faster with sheer willpower. I was getting air as I rose over the bumps, the chassis shuddered as it met the ground again but I pushed the car as hard as it would go.

Still, the orange light blazed behind me. I watched him in the mirror for just a second. He was pointing something long and tubular in my direction. There was a momentary bloom of sparks, then a burst of smoke, and my mirror was gone. He was shooting at me.

Just as I realized how screwed I was, my own carelessness saved my life. After every bump, the stack of pinewood in the back had been slamming into the tailgate, working away at the catch. Now it sprang open. The planks, pots and boxes of nails, all launched out the back, collecting both bike and rider behind me. I heard the wheeze rise into a gurgling shriek, and the headlight cast its glow upwards into the trees, before fizzling out.

I kept flooring it, until I reached the little concrete bridge that marks the end of that awful road. I slowed just enough to squeeze through the narrow ford, then stopped as I reached the other bank. Sticking my head out the broken window, powdered glass spilling from my hair, I watched.

He was still coming, powering down the last hill, but he skidded to a halt at the foot of the bridge. Had he given up? I wasn't sure, but something compelled me to keep watching.

I got a good look at the “bike”.

Have you ever seen one of those magic eye pictures? at first glance, it's just patterns and colors, but squint and you see a sailboat or something? It was like that. From straight on, I saw the pipes and bodywork of a bike. But if I let my eyes lose focus, it wasn’t a bike at all. It was a horse - snorting, stamping, rippling with muscle.

In one last display of rage, he reared his metal steed on its back tire, howling. The front wheel eclipsed the moon, before flowing like mercury into a chiseled horsehead, nostrils flaring, eyes burning like hot coals. And now that he was silhouetted entirely in the moons light, I saw what should have been obvious from the start.

Between the rider’s broad shoulders, there was nothing. He had no head. Only a kind of mangled stump remained. The wheezing made sense now. He was trying to scream, to project his fury. But without a mouth, all that came out was the whistling of a severed throat. I drove away as fast as I could.

I parked at the very end of my driveway, almost touching the bricks. My car was a mess, and I didn’t want anyone asking questions. I just went inside and jumped on the computer.

Now I don’t think I need to explain why I didn’t go to the cops.

“Hey guys, l was just accosted by an angry, spectral equestrian who totaled my car. He was big and dark and, oh, he didn’t have a head!”.

I thought I’d save myself a stay in one of the state loony bins and did some investigating myself. There’s a site I know that deals in New York license plates. Enter any plate number in the state and you can retrieve all kinds of details. Vehicle history, registration status, and most importantly, owners’ details. You pay a fee for every search, and it’s crawling with pop-up ads, but it works. I punched in the bike’s number. *1790*. The cursor turned into a circle as it thought deep for about a minute. I was about to give up when results filled the page.

MAKE/MODEL: Indian/Chief.

PRIMARY COLOR: Black.

REGISTERED OWNER: Van Tassel.

*What a name*. I pasted Van Tassel into a search field for licenses, shelling out a little more this time, but waiting a little less. *Who is this guy?*

*VAN TASSEL*

ID: 172 344 781

DOB: 1749

SLEEPY HOLLOW

*That has to be a glitch,* some rational part of me thought. Unless that date of birth is a typo, this guy has been kicking around since the 18^(th) century. What’s he paying the renewal fee with, doubloons? And more importantly, how is he passing the eye test?

I let myself start to doubt what I'd seen with my own eyes that night. I prayed that if I traced that address, I’d find a normal guy, some angry, tattooed biker. Crazy, but flesh and blood at least.

But that could wait until daylight. I saved the address to my phone and shut down my PC. I was tired like I’d never been before, and not sure I could even sleep. I tried anyway.

It wasn't long before I was shaken awake. My skull was punctured by an assault of unbearable noise, the wheezing scream and the crunching of metal rattled through the window. The blinds sliced the sickly glow of the headlight into amber zebra stripes on my wall.

I froze under the sheet, feeling like a mouse, hoping I could shrink away until it was over. It went on and on. The light pulsed along the wall like some weird amoeba, and twisting, crushing metal screeched in a cacophony. Then it ended, I heard the bike skid away.

I eventually worked up the courage to crawl out of bed and slinked to the window. Peeling back one of the blinds, I looked outside.

Yep, my car was *wrecked*. But my eyes latched on to something else, orange, flying fast. I ducked. The window shattered, showering me with broken glass. Something slammed into the floorboards with a *thunk*, a sweet, rotten stench erupting from within it.

*It’s a… pumpkin?*

Outside, the bike finally peeled away, its headlight slicing down the street.

A few porch lights flicked on, and every dog on the block was howling. I brushed the glass off my clothes and stepped outside. In the driveway, what was left of my car sat in a blanket of shattered windshield glass, sparkling like snow. It was completely flattened, like a monster truck rolled over it, and the entire surface was pockmarked with deep, half-moon dents. I ran my hand over one and realized what they were. Hoofprints.

“You okay, Derrick? What the hell is going on over there?”

 My neighbor Saul leaned over the fence, hands between the pickets, eyes puffy but concerned.

“Yeah, I’m fine Saul, thanks. Just a… road-rage incident, nothing to worry about”.

“Nothing to worry about? Look at your car! look at *you!* Aren’t you calling the cops?”

“No, I… think I need to settle out of court on this one”.

 Saul gave me some side-eye, before pulling away.

“Well, if you won’t call them, I will. That lunatic isn’t coming back if I can help it”

As the sun rose, I brought the pumpkin, wrapped in layers of newspaper, out to the trash. It stank like nothing else and was crawling with tiny black bugs. As I tossed it with a clang into its final resting place, I noticed something was carved into its wilted side.

*Coward.*





The Uber driver took a few wrong turns before we got there. It was my fault, *mostly,* I kept second guessing google maps. “This can’t be it… it’s a…”

“It’s a cemetery dude. You want me to drop you off or not? It’s getting late”.

I thanked him and got out. An ancient stone church crowned the hill, which was swept with uncut grass. Crosses and headstones popped up in rows like crooked teeth. I started up the path, nervously fiddling with the envelope in my hands.

*Why do I have to be like this?* I thought. *So foolhardy and stubborn. I guess I get it from Dad, although he never had to make good with a ghost.*

I walked between the rows of graves and started searching for his name. They were old, belonging to ploughmen, waggoners and carpenters. The most recent dates I saw were the 1910s, and they counted down steadily as I stumbled up the hill. I worked methodically through the 1800s and by the time I reached the crumbling gravestones marked 1700s, the sun was sinking behind the church steeple.

Eventually I found a headstone that was *odd.* It was eroded to the point of being little more than a rock, and sunken halfway beneath the dirt. But I could just see the remains of its original shape. A horsehead. Stripping away a blanket of moss, I found the faintest inscription lingered on the stone.

*- Van Tassell*

*1749 - 1790.*

I placed down the envelope carefully on the grass. Inside, there was a wad of cash wrapped in plastic. I did some research, found the price point for repairing a dent in a vintage *Indian,* and stuffed in more than enough. There was also a printout of my insurance info, in case he was a real stickler.

*There, you son of a bitch. We’re even Stevens. Now leave me alone, please!*

At the bottom of the hill, I checked my phone. No service. I lumbered around for a bit, until a single blinking bar appeared. *Good enough*. I called an Uber. The map pinwheeled for a moment before confirming the ride. But no drivers name appeared, nor any vehicle.  
The wind picked up, rushing past my ears in steady gusts. But underneath the whooshing, I swear I could hear something else.

*Heeuuuuughhhhhh…*

My phone vibrated to life.

*Your driver, Van Tassel, will be there soon.*
