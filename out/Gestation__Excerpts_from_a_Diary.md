***August 28th***

I don’t know what to do anymore.

Today marks exactly two months since my mother died. In this time, I believe I could count on merely one hand how many times I have left our apartment. 

I’m aware that I should get outside more. I know the city is teeming with opportunity, and that I should be working. But I just can’t seem to bring myself to. I haven’t seen any of my massage clients in this time; not only that, but I’ve entirely ignored them.

And don’t even get me started on hobbies, or otherwise. I haven’t gone for a run or picked up a single book since it happened. In fact, I’ve barely left my bedroom. It’s a painful and strained feeling, day in and day out; I know I should do something, anything, and part of me strongly wants to. I want to be outside, to try and feel some semblance of life again. But a larger part of me can’t handle the idea of leaving my bedside and entering a world where she is no longer there. 

Just being in the other rooms in the apartment feels like too much; stepping outside and letting other people see this new version of myself with a vital piece missing – that idea is unbearable. My bed has become the path of least resistance, so that is where I stay.

***August 30th***

It’s currently 5:00 AM. I’d like to make a vow to myself to just go to the grocery store today. I can’t believe it, but I’m getting tired of takeout.

***September 1st***

Something exciting happened today.

Ellaine stopped by. Ellaine is one of the very few friends I have that still lives in Boston. Now that I write of it, she might be the only one. Most of everyone else I know has married and moved farther away. But Ellaine and her boyfriend claim to love it here, so they’ve stayed.

I hadn’t told her about my mom, but I suppose she found out through mutual acquaintances. She came straight over, we talked, and then she dragged me out for coffee to talk some more. At first I felt a great reluctance, but eventually the embrace of a friend seemed to soothe me. I didn’t feel the overwhelming urge to return home.

I told her everything that I felt able to. I told her about taking care of mom, and even about trying to contact my dad to give him the news (to no avail, obviously. Trying to reach him was a mistake). But most of all, I told her about the alienation – that I don’t feel at home in my own apartment, and that the city feels so foreign. 

I think I made it sound like I wanted to get away (which might be true), because after a period of silence she shared an idea with me. Her boyfriend’s parents, who seem quite well off, own a townhouse in Vermont that they tend to use in the Summer months as a getaway. If she talked to them, she said, I might be able to stay there for a while. It’s in a town called Londonville.

I’d never heard of Londonville before, but apparently it’s a very small town near the center of the state, and it’s surrounded by beautiful forest. Her words to describe it were “small and sleepy”.

When I mentioned that I’d like to think about it for a few days, she told me the offer is open anytime. I must admit, it feels good to have a friend on my side right now; and while the idea of taking off for a few weeks or months does bring me some measure of guilt, I can’t help but feel excited about the prospect.

***September 4th***

It’s been especially difficult to leave the bed again today.

I did talk to Ellaine a bit more about the idea yesterday. According to her boyfriend, the town has a high population of elderly, retired folk who like living near nature. As far as I’m concerned, that’s another point for Londonville. I could probably get massage clients up there with a little advertising.

***September 7th***

I called Ellaine and told her I’d like to do it. With the summer months nearing an end, she let me know that anytime next week should suffice.

***September 12th***

All my things are packed. The place is apparently furnished, so I went with mostly the essentials. The massage table will be a little difficult to fit in the car, but I think I can manage.

I debated on whether I should take anything of my mother’s with me. Most of her things are certainly safer at home until I decide what to do with them. However, I want a piece of her to be with me while I’m gone. I decided to pack her rosary.

I think it’s because I would always see her praying with it… she was so deeply religious, although she never tried to convert me. I always thought that was respectful of her, especially in comparison to the other people in her church. She kept it in an ornate box given to her by her pastor. Even if I never use it, I don’t think she’d mind me keeping it by my bedside.

Our apartment is paid in advance for a few months, so I should be alright to leave. But I’ve given them the landline number for the Londonville house in case they need me.

I’ll be by Ellaine’s place tomorrow to pick up the keys and verify the address.

***September 14th***

Londonville is absolutely gorgeous! This place feels like an outdoorsy introvert’s dreamland. The town is located far off the interstate but near a national forest, so it feels incredibly secluded here.

Despite the seclusion, the central part of the town is actually also quite beautiful. The buildings are mostly colonial style, and I even saw one or two triple deckers reminiscent of Boston! There’s a few shops and restaurants near the center of town, but it’s truly very small. I believe there was only a single mercantile and maybe two grocery stores. Once you escape the center, it’s just beautiful homes spread about, everything partially enclosed by trees.

And the trails! I got a map from the mercantile of the surrounding forest and there are countless trails everywhere. I’ll have no shortage of places to explore and be comfortably alone, or so I hope.

I don’t know how to explain it, but I feel a sense of rejuvenation here. The home that Ellaine is letting me stay at is a modestly sized townhome (one of the very few in Londonville, I’ve learned), and it’s quite close to the cutest library I’ve ever seen.

Getting unpacked didn’t take long, and I don’t want to waste my newfound energy. So as I get settled in, my writing may be a bit sparse.

I can only hope the people here are as nice as the scenery.

***September 20th***

There have definitely been some hard moments over the past few days; but overall, I’ve been feeling much lighter.

I’ve taken the time to visit the local paper’s advertising department and placed an ad about my massage practice, and it should show up this Sunday. Scotty's Goods (the sole mercantile store) also agreed to let me leave some business cards there, which was kind of him. He seemed excited to give me his recommendations for what spots he likes around the town and in the woods. 

Speaking of, I have taken some time to hike and even done a bit of trail running. It’s stunning out here. The trees feel abnormally diverse. I passed by oaks, maples, spruce, pines, firs and even Junipers all intermingled with each other. Furthermore, they often leer over the trails, as if they’re watching over me. Especially the oaks, which are towering. It all gives off a sense of quietude, as if I’m enclosed and protected.

***September 24th***

I have an interested client already!! She saw my cards in the shop and Scotty told her that I seemed nice. I guess word of mouth works better here, which makes sense.

I’ll be meeting her on Tuesday. She’s a widow named Margaret. The only reason I know that is because she told me that and much more just over our phone call. I have a feeling she’ll be very talkative, and it sounds nice to chat. I look forward to meeting her.

***September 26th***

I met Margaret today. She’s oddly comforting. She’s in her eighties, with a bad back from both age and working for years on her, now passed, husband’s farm. It puts a lot of strain on her muscles, so she seemed very appreciative.

We talked about her time on the farm, which is nearby, how she spends her days now, and her advice for making myself feel at home in the town, since there aren’t many social events.

She’s a joy to talk to. Honestly, she sort of reminds me of my mom. She’s even deeply religious, although not catholic. She practices something I didn’t quite understand; she referred to her practices and her church as “New Age Spirituality”, which I thought sounded damn cool for someone in their eighties. She must have an open mind.

She actually invited me to one of her church services tomorrow to meet people. The sermon would be short, she claimed, and there would likely be people around my age to socialize with. The place has an interesting name: “One Light Church”.

I don’t think I’ll be interested in whatever they preach at “One Light”, but meeting some more people in the town could be good for me.

***September 27th***

One Light Church was much further from town than I expected. Following the address took me a bit out of town, and down a couple back roads through the woods. It wasn’t right off the road, either. Instead there was a parking lot off the road, but a cobbled path deep through the woods led to the church itself. I don’t remember seeing it on the trail map.

It was magnificently beautiful. It followed a similar colonial style to the town, but far more grand. The building was three stories tall, and accented with intricate designs in both gold and dark, polished oak. And everything seemed to build up to a massive spire that loomed, seemingly, toward the heavens.

The next thing I noticed about it were the trees. The woods surrounding Londonville this time of year are changing to light yellows and deep oranges, save for the evergreens. But every tree near the church, even the oaks, still had rich green leaves. A few of them even seemed to grow from within the foundations of the church, like you see with neglected homes. But here, it seemed fitting. Almost intentional. If it wasn’t so far from the town, I imagine it would be a centerpiece.

As I approached, the church was warm. I don’t just mean the inside either. I mean once I got within a few feet of the church, the chill of the air was ripped away, and replaced with a deep and soothing warmth. Almost like a caress. 

The last significant thing I remember about the church was the music. Embarrassingly enough, I don’t actually recall what the pastor said during his sermon. Instead, all I could focus on while he spoke was the resounding sound of a piano. It was playing a song I’d never heard before, but it was astonishingly pretty, and it gave me a similar sense of comfort.

I sat next to Margaret, who introduced me to a few people and pointed out many more. There were maybe forty people at the event, but many were prominent members of the town. Both the sheriff and Scotty were there, for example. Apparently they, too, are devout members of the church.

I did eventually speak to the pastor, although not for long. This was fine with me, since I had hardly heard a word that he preached. He seemed perfectly pleasant, and very charismatic, but a little rushed to talk to Margaret about private matters.

I did mingle with some other people my age, and they invited me out for a drink next weekend.

When I left, I realized that I never actually *saw* a piano.

***September 28th***

I got curious today. I didn’t have much else to do, so I decided to stop by the little library and asked for books on the Old Light church. The librarian did know vaguely about the church, but we couldn’t find any books on them or on “New Age” spiritualism that looked relevant. I suppose it’s a local phenomenon.

***October 3rd***

I had another session with Margaret today. I’ve had two others call in about my services since I got here, but they’ve scheduled me weeks out. So for now, it’s just Margaret.

Since I had no one else to see today either, I let the session go a little long, and afterwards we just talked.

Margaret is clearly a very open person, and she let me know how lonely she gets. Not many people come to see her, so this is some of the little social interaction she gets outside of attending the sermons at One Light. Her husband passed away roughly a decade ago, and she doesn’t have any other living relatives.

But despite that, she’s quite cheery, and seems hopeful.

***October 4th***

I returned to One Light at Margaret’s request. Although, if I’m being entirely honest with myself, I think I *wanted* to go back. There’s something about the place that is so soothing, like a warm respite from my troubles outside.

It’s probably just the social aspect, everyone is very welcoming and I surely need it.

I learned more about the church today. The pastor has no pamphlets or books that he gives out, so I had to learn solely from sermons.

The piano played again while he spoke. While I could not see any speakers, I assume that must be where the sound was coming from. Once again, I’d scarcely heard anything so beautiful; it took constant effort to focus on the sermon.

But what I learned was interesting: they believe in reincarnation. Reincarnation! In a *church*, in a little town in Vermont. What are the odds?

So yes, they believe that everything we do in this life is a growing process, and that it all leads to our final few days and moments. In these last parts of life, our experiences culminate. And just as each thought now influences the next, our final thoughts in this life go on to influence the start of the next. This means they have a primary focus on what he constantly described as “loving growth”. I’ve certainly heard worse things.

And again, Margaret and the pastor seemed eager to talk to each other quickly after his speech.

***October 6th***

I had that drink with people from the church. They all drank very little – said they’d like to keep clear minds. But despite that, the bartender seemed so incredibly happy to see them. Everyone did, really – they radiated charisma.

When I tried to bring up the church (I mainly wanted to talk about the piano), they changed the subject rather quickly. One of them told me in private that they prefer to keep the religious talk at the church, and practice by living presently outside of it.

***October 9th***

Margaret asked me for a favor after our massage session.

It required a bit of an explanation. At One Light, there is a tradition among those that feel they are nearing the end of their lives. At eighty-three, she said, it certainly feels like she is near the end of hers.

It is a three day event where someone stays alone at the church. They eat, sleep, and meditate or pray there for the entirety of the three days. In her words, it’s meant to be a period of introspection, and a cleansing of the thoughts to prepare for death. You can face your troublesome thoughts and nurture your positive ones in preparation for the eventual rebirth. All in a familiar and sacred environment. She referred to it as a “period of gestation”. And it is a great honor in the church.

The name made me uncomfortable, but the tradition sounded quite nice. The only problem is that Margaret claimed to feel scared. Being alone, she said, was something she didn’t want here, near the end of her life. And despite her desire to undergo her “gestation”, she wanted occasional company.

Picturing her alone made me think of my mother once again. I thought of how deeply she seemed to appreciate when I was there to accompany her near the end, and the tranquil look she had in her eyes. I couldn’t bear to think of leaving her alone; and I couldn’t do it now, either.

The next sermon is tomorrow night. And Margaret will begin her stay the night after. There is a bedroom past the door behind the pulpit. The pastor had provided her with a key to the church to leave and lock it, in case of emergencies. Margaret has preemptively made me a copy.

***October 10th***

The deep warmth and comfort of the church was palpable this evening. The piano echoed subtle vibrations within my bones. At times, I struggled to even stay awake – social embarrassment was the only thing that kept me from laying on the pews and slipping away. Nobody else seemed as tired as I was.

I could not focus on the sermon. But I did notice that he spent much of his speech talking seemingly directly to Margaret.

I’m currently writing this before bed. For the first time since leaving for Vermont, I decided to take out my mother’s rosary – just to look at it. The centerpiece has a small crack down the center of the Virgin Mary. I feel terrible… I must not have packed it as well as I had thought.

***October 11th***

Once evening turned to night, I made my way to the church. I decided to wait until dark so Margaret could get settled into her practices before I showed up.

The parking lot was empty, as was the trail. I suppose It should be like this for three days. When I entered the church, however, I was surprised to find all of the lights still on, and the heat that radiated from and within the church was stronger than before. It was still pleasant, but bordered on feverish.

My steps echoed as I made my way to the back of the pulpit. There was a simple and rustic wooden door there. Even if Margaret had not told me where her room was, I feel that I would have made my way there anyway. The door had an allure to it.

When I opened the door, it was dark, but not entirely unlighted. I could make out the vague form of the room. It was quite large, maybe twenty feet back and a little less across. But it was very, very plain. The floor, walls, and ceiling were all made of a loose, gray cobble brick. It felt ancient and decrepit – far older than the decor in the rest of the church. Stranger still, there was no furniture. The room was entirely empty, except for a tall lamp kept just inside, by the door.

In the back of the room, where the light scarcely reached, I saw what seemed to be the dark, loose form of Margaret. Her eyes barely gleamed in the dark, but her silhouette seemed to drape across the ground and low part of the back wall. There was no greeting or movement, merely the dull gleam of eyes. All felt amiss.

I pulled the chain on the lamp, and the warmth of the church immediately left me. 

Margaret sat against the back wall of the room, her upper body hunched and leaning to the side. Her eyes and mouth hung agape, and she seemed to stare right through me. 

The scene surrounding her took time for my mind to process. There were great mounds of flesh and tissue protruding from parts of the wall and floor, and they wrapped themselves around her. And as I stared, I began to make out specific parts of the mass. Meaty arms with dozens of attached, jaundiced eyes grabbed Margaret’s side and neck. A hairy mass of skin with jutting teeth had latched itself onto her legs. A long, brawny rope of flesh snaked its way into her dress shirt, and I could see the bulbous lump ended at her abdomen. It was attached like some horrid mockery of an umbilical cord.

The whole scene looked like a dozen humans had been pulsed in a mixer, and the result had wrapped itself around Margaret. The longer I stared, the more I saw, and the faster my heart began to beat.

My body did not know what to do. My arms wanted to pull the chain once more, and hide the sight in the shadow. Maybe the balmy comfort of the church would return. My legs wanted to send me running, but somehow I stayed firmly planted. The mass rhythmically pulsed.

Just when it felt like I could take no more, the sight changed. In a mere moment my perception seemed to shift, and I saw it all differently.

There was no mass of flesh, no pulp or marrow. Instead, there were large tree roots that seemed to grow from the walls. They crawled along the room, and Margaret sat upright in the midst of them. Her legs were crossed, and she was in an almost meditative pose.

She then began to speak, and asked me to take a seat. My feelings of apprehension and trepidation had seemed to subside, and were replaced again with a calm serenity. So I sat.

The hour that proceeded was a conversation between Margaret and I, wherein she told me how lovely she felt there. While the room may be gloomy, she had never felt so present minded or connected with the world. I mostly listened, as I felt too entranced by her to speak. What I remember the most is that she told me that, beyond any doubt, she could feel her rebirth beginning.

When I left, I noticed some of the roots had grown up a bit and were caressing the edges of my shoes. I felt flattered.

I’ll be returning tomorrow night.

***October 12th***

Margaret has never looked happier. When I entered her room this evening, she looked absolutely beautiful. 

The roots were still there, and they coiled themselves around her even further. But Margaret was without most of her skin, and most of her muscle tissue had atrophied. Other parts of her were missing as well; she had no bottom jaw or teeth, and only one eye remained. Her sinewy husk seemed to stare at me through that eye, and when I looked into it, her elation seemed to spill into me.

We didn’t talk. Instead I watched and smiled, and she occasionally blinked.

***October 13th***

Margaret was not there on the third day. At first I had been disappointed, as I knew this meant I would not see Margaret again. But then I realized she had left this world in unmitigated peace, and I began to feel quite happy for her.

Instead of leaving, I decided to sit where she had previously occupied and reflect. I thought about a great many things – about the kind of life I had led so far, about the wondrous look I had seen in Margaret’s eye. But most of all, I thought about my mother. While encased by the gentle warmth of the church, I recollected memories both beautiful and sorrowful that I shared with her. No matter the memory, they were all sacred. And as I thought about the end of her own life, I remembered how she acted. Even in her last days, I couldn’t leave her side without letting me know how loved I was. She never became anything less than my loving mother, and I realized she left her life with far more grace than most could ever hope for.

I realized that under the gentle caress of death, she had slipped away without fear. And if she was rebirthed, it would be as another beautiful person. I could only feel happy for her and for having loved her as long as I did. All would be okay.

When I left, the wall seemed to lowly and rhythmically rumble, like a heartbeat deep within the bones of the church.

***October 20th***

I’ve been to two sermons now since seeing the back room of One Light Church. I no longer hear the piano or the pastor. Instead, I merely enjoy the church’s nurturing warmth. And while I sit, I hear the deep-seated heartbeat. I cannot tell where it comes from – if it is Margaret’s, my own, or something yet unfathomed. I don’t need to know yet. For now, I just listen.

I still have the key. Soon, when I am ready, I will spend my final days in the room behind the pulpit.
