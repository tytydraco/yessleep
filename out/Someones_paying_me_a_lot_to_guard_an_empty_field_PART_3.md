It was clear from the morning that this would be a different kind of shift.

The usual car was parked outside my apartment. The key had been dropped into my mailbox in an envelope. It felt strange not seeing the fat guy at the train station, but I figured that just confirmed this was a special shift. I just hoped it would be worth the extra pay.

The coordinates for the field were the same. I knew the route by now, and got there quickly.
But as soon as I drove out of the trees and into the clearing, I was surprised.

A brown Dodge Caravan — just like mine — was parked at the far end of the field.
A man stood next to it.
Tall, thin, much older than me, and wearing the exact same security guard uniform I had on.
He scratched his graying hair and waved when he saw me pulling out from the trees.


I was caught off guard. I never expected that two of us might be assigned to watch this place at the same time.

As soon as I turned off the engine and stepped out of the car, I started walking toward him — curious who he was and what he might know.
But suddenly, the old man began waving his arms frantically and shouting something, telling me to stop right where I was.

I had no idea what he wanted. He was far away, and the wind seemed to carry his voice in the wrong direction.
Or maybe… maybe I couldn't hear him at all?
That’s when I noticed he was holding a walkie-talkie, shaking it in the air and pointing from it to me, urging me to use mine.
I reacted quickly. In the usual cardboard box, I found my own device — I had a walkie-talkie too.


“Welcome, colleague,” came a voice immediately as I turned it on.


“Hey,” I replied.


“Is this your first shift like this? You haven’t checked today’s instructions yet, have you? Please read them carefully. Today, you need to pay very close attention to everything.
Name’s Ed, by the way. What should I call you?”


The old man’s voice was rough — exactly what you’d expect from someone who’s been alive for sixty years and smoking for at least that long.


“I’m Steve,” I answered, waving toward him. “I’ll check the briefing now to get started.”


This guide was different from the ones I’d seen before. Right on the opening page, it read:
“For Special Days”


The rules were the same — with a few new exceptions:

- The two guards may not speak to each other, except via the provided walkie-talkie. Unless we instruct otherwise.

- The two guards may not make physical contact under any circumstances. Unless a different order is given.

- We require heightened awareness for the full 24-hour duration of the shift. Should your focus falter — or worse, should you fall asleep — it could cost lives.

I swallowed hard after reading that. There was no doubt now — this shift was going to be different.
The walkie-talkie crackled again.


“Read the schedule too, Steven. We’re about to start. Everything needs to go smoothly today. I’d rather not end up pushing up daisies out here...”


I stared at the radio, nervous. What the hell have I gotten myself into this time?


The manual was pure chaos to me.
Dozens of time slots, tasks stacked on top of each other like a collapsing house of cards.
Ed buzzed in on the radio, saying if I had trouble, he could help — he’d been on a few of these "deployments" before. But I didn’t want to ask for his help just yet.

I sat in the car, reading through today’s tasks. Ed was just casually walking around the field.
Here are a few entries from today’s "schedule":


11:36 – Please shut off both vehicles. The guard who is farther from the entrance path must exit the vehicle and remain outside for the indicated time. The other guard must retrieve the shovel from their trunk and begin digging a 1x1 meter hole in the center of the field.

12:29 – If the hole was successfully dug, the other guard may re-enter their car. If not, please refill the hole and return to your vehicle. While the clocks are counting backwards, do not move.

14:51 – Please have both guards observe the sky. If the clouds are unusually fast, report to the emergency number. If they are slow or stationary, take no action. If you observe anything else unusual in the sky, leave the area immediately.

16:05 – You are granted permission to make contact. Work together to save the diver. If successful, report it immediately. If not, please bury them in the field.

18:58 – Ask the participants of the event to leave the area. If they react aggressively, leave immediately. Ensure all guests have exited the field. Extinguish the campfire.

20:31 – Please watch for foxes. If more than three foxes cross the field strictly from right to left, prepare for the squad's arrival. If fewer than three, take no action. If they move in any other direction, leave the area immediately.

21:14 – If the squad was required, wait until the cleanup is complete. If no squad was needed, ask anyone still on the field to leave.

21:55 – If the squad has left, please clean up any remains. If there was no squad, prepare for the night and take the enclosed pills found in the trunk.


A sudden burst of static from my walkie-talkie snapped me out of the reading — and I still had a lot of time stamps left to go through.


"Steve, how’s the manual coming along?" Ed asked.


"Almost done," I replied calmly.


"Alright, well, five minutes — then the first task begins."


I glanced nervously at the clock. Was it really that time already?


I had already been digging that damn hole for fifteen minutes.
Ed just sat there in his car, watching lazily. For some reason, the heat out on the field had become unbearable. Sure, late summer could still be hot, but this felt wrong — unnaturally hot. I took off my blue shirt and wrapped it around my head like a turban. The hole wasn’t that big, but in this heat, even that felt exhausting.
That’s when my phone buzzed.
And I knew that was never a good sign. I fished it out of my pocket, but before I could even check the screen, Ed was already screaming through the radio:


"RUN! GET OUT OF THERE, STEVE! BACK TO YOUR CAR, NOW!"


I didn’t check what the message said.
As I was — drenched in sweat and gasping — I bolted straight for the car, into the safety of the trees’ shade. I flung the shovel far behind me while running, and I could feel that horrible, searing heat clawing at my back more and more with every step.

I barely managed to leap inside the car. Panting like I’d just finished a marathon, my heart thumping like mad, and I was soaked as if I’d just climbed out of a pool. My back burned. My shoulders throbbed. They were glowing red — like I’d spent hours baking in the sun.


"Steve, are you okay? Did you make it back?" Ed’s voice crackled nervously through the walkie.


"Yeah… yeah," I hissed through clenched teeth.


My shoulders were on fire, pulsing with pain. That’s when I looked back out across the field.
It was like the sun itself had scorched it. The dry grass was singed at the tips, glowing like they might burst into flame any second. This shift really could kill me, I thought. If I wasn’t careful.
Strangely, the field’s edges were untouched. Where Ed and I had parked, the air was still that same pleasant late-summer breeze — as if nothing had changed.

My phone buzzed again. Thankfully, I hadn’t dropped it back out on the field like I thought — I pulled it from the console and finally read the earlier messages.


"WARNING! Immediately cease digging and return to the vehicle without delay."


I just clicked my tongue. Great timing, I thought. I could’ve fried out there, and I doubt the Company would’ve lost any sleep over it. Then I opened the second message:


"Contact with your partner is authorized. Please assist with treating the injured area."


That’s when I looked up — and saw Ed standing right in front of my car, smiling with that kind, wrinkled face of his.


At first, I was a little wary of Ed. I was afraid he might just be another one of those strange things that belonged to this place — and that I was about to get screwed again.
But it quickly became clear he was just a kind old man… even if he was nearly 6’6” tall.

As it turned out, there was a first aid kit in the back of the car. Using that, he managed to treat my shoulders and back as best he could. According to him, they were just mild burns.

We chatted a little while he worked. Ed had been with the Company for years — and in that time, he'd seen a lot. He’d had countless strange assignments. He said the field always stayed the same, but the tasks changed every shift.
He’s saving up for his grandkids.He told me he’s done pretty well for himself over the years, and he could quit… but something about this place kept pulling him back. He liked being out here, even if the job was dangerous.

After a few minutes of conversation, both our phones pinged at once. Ed didn’t say a word. He didn’t even check the message. He simply turned around and started walking back toward his car.
He was already a bit of a distance away when he called back:


"Just follow the instructions. Exactly as they’re written. You’ll be fine!"


Once Ed reached his car, he radioed me again:


"Steve, you should go ahead and fill that hole back in. You good with that?"


I stepped out of the car and gave him a quick wave — all good. Filling the hole was much easier than digging it. Took me maybe ten minutes. Ed sat in his car and watched, munching on a sandwich.
Once I was done, Ed's voice crackled through the radio again:


"Alright, kid — looks like we’ve got ourselves a bit of a break now."


I strolled back to my car calmly. My burns still stung, but at least that task was out of the way. I hoped we wouldn’t have much to do until around two o'clock.

When I got back, I cleaned myself up a bit and finally got to rest. Ed didn’t say much — just told me to enjoy the break while I could, because the day was going to be tough.
Neither of us got out of the car. Ed said that on days like this, you never know when you’ll need to leave in a hurry — better to stay inside.

For a while, I watched some shows on my phone. Ed, from what I could see, was reading a book — he seemed perfectly content on his own.

After a while, though, it started getting harder to keep myself entertained. I leaned out of the car window and just stared at the field and the landscape in boredom. I listened to the rustling of the trees, the whispering wind...


Until the clouds started acting suspicious.
They began moving at a speed that felt totally unnatural — like someone had hit fast-forward on a time-lapse video. I reached for the radio and immediately called Ed:


"Ed, do you see the sky?"


"Yeah, Steve. I’m messaging the Company now. Something’s up with the clouds. Stay sharp!"


Then came more waiting. I kept watching the clouds race across the sky in wild, shifting shapes… And then — just like that — they stopped. Everything went back to normal. The sky looked the way it always had again.

I tried striking up a conversation with Ed over the radio, but he didn’t seem very open this time. His voice was tense and uneasy. I asked him about the Company, but he only said:


"I don’t care what they do. I’m just here for the money."


Eventually, the time crawled by, and our next task came in.


"Steve, do you see that too?" Ed’s voice crackled through my radio.


I snapped to attention at his voice and scanned the field. And then I saw what he meant.
Someone was lying in the middle of the field, thrashing on the ground. His arms and legs flailed wildly, his whole body convulsing in erratic spasms. I figured he must be the diver mentioned in the guide — the one we were supposed to help.

Ed was already rushing over to him while I was still climbing out of my car. By the time I got there, he was already kneeling beside the man, trying to calm him down.

The man was a strange sight: he wore an old, heavy deep-sea diving suit. He looked to be middle-aged, and he screamed in pain, thrashing as if something inside the suit was tearing him apart. No matter how we tried to hold him down or calm him, he just kept shouting in some unknown, incomprehensible language and kept flailing wildly.
Then, all of a sudden, he vomited blood — thick, dark red, coating the inside of his helmet.
I can’t even say exactly where it poured from, but the little viewport in the helmet was completely drenched in blood.
Ed and I both jumped back in shock.

There was nothing we could do. Honestly, I’m not sure there was anything we could have done in the first place.


We buried the diver.

It took some time, but Ed helped me dig, so it went a bit faster. We laid him down just as he was, in the shallow pit we had managed to dig. It couldn’t even really be called a grave.
Ed said a few short words for the unknown man, then simply told me he needed to rest for a bit. Without another word, he headed back to his car.

I just stood there in the soft afternoon light. The place felt peaceful, yet there was something unsettling lingering in the air. All I could do was hope that Ed and I would both make it through the day in one piece.


I waited in the car again. As the sun slowly dipped lower in the sky, I felt my stomach tighten. Even the air itself seemed heavier somehow.

Nights were always the hardest in this place. And now—after everything that had happened—I was certain this one would be especially brutal.

Ed sat in his own car. He had already turned on the interior lights. He wasn’t reading or eating. As far as I could tell, he was just staring blankly out at the field. He probably felt the same heavy weight pressing down on us.

One moment, the field was completely empty—And in the next, a massive bonfire erupted in the middle.

A dozen figures stood around the flames in the dim light. All of them overdressed— The women wore elegant evening gowns, the kind you’d wear to a gala or the opera, and the men were in formal suits.

And every single one of them had that goddamn rabbit mask on.
I was terrified.


I stared, terrified, at the absurd banquet. The rabbit-masked figures just stood there, as if pretending to attend some masquerade ball. Some of them were speaking—or at least pretending to speak. Their hands were empty, but they moved as if they were holding glasses or plates. The whole thing sent a chill down my spine.

That’s when I heard Ed’s voice. He’d probably been calling me for a while, but now he was shouting. Only then did I snap out of it. He was standing next to my car.


“Steve, come on,” he said more quietly now that he saw I was finally aware of what was happening. “We need to send them away.”


“I really don’t want to go over there…” I said, my voice trembling.


Ed just looked at me, tense. I could see in his eyes—he was scared too. Nervous. He didn’t want to go near them either.


“Me neither, Steve,” he finally said. “But I have a feeling if we don’t get them to leave, we’re gonna be in even deeper shit.”


I swallowed hard and nodded. If Ed hadn’t been there, I’m sure I would’ve just walked away.
Screw the money, the field, everything. But alone? I never would’ve had the guts to go up to that cultish rabbit masquerade crowd.

We walked toward them together. None of them acknowledged us — Not until Ed spoke:


“Excuse me, everyone,” he said firmly, though I could hear the fear in his voice. “I’m going to have to ask you to leave. You’re not allowed to be here.”


All the rabbit masks turned to face us. I wanted to run. Back to the car. Home. Forever.
Ed took a deep breath.


“I repeat—please leave the premises.”


None of them moved; they just stared at us. Since it was nearly dark, we lit them up with our flashlights, but just like last time, they weren’t bothered in the slightest, even when we pointed the beams directly into their faces.


“This is your final warning!” Ed raised his voice. “Please leave immediately!”


And then—suddenly—the rabbit-masked figures began to move. As if they truly obeyed, they turned and started leaving the field, heading back toward the woods in their strange, grotesque stride. Some, however, remained behind, silently watching us.


“Steve, I think we need to speak to those ones directly,” Ed whispered. “You take the group on the right—I’ll go to the ones by the fire.”


I nodded.
Ed’s courage seemed to rub off on me. I knew he was afraid too—maybe he’d had his own bad run-in with them—but he still approached them.


I walked toward the small group still standing by the fire. Two men in suits and a woman in a large, frilly white dress with blonde hair. As I got closer, the horrifying realization hit me: They were the same ones who attacked me last time.
My stomach twisted into knots. I think I started sweating in places I didn’t even know could sweat.

The three of them stared at me, unmoving. Those stupid white rabbit masks just grinned lifelessly into my face. I gathered all my courage and, in a steady but firm voice, spoke to them:


“It’s time to leave. Please vacate the area.”


No reaction. They just kept staring at me. I took a deep breath and repeated:


“Please leave. I won’t say it again!”


It wasn’t the reaction I expected—but at least something happened. The woman in the black mask turned on her heel with an offended gesture and stormed off toward the forest.
The other man—someone I hadn’t seen before, also wearing a black mask—stumbled after her.

Only the one in the white mask remained. The one I’d first encountered. He didn’t move.
Just stood there, staring. That stupid grinning mask still frozen in my face. Panic started creeping in.


“It’s time for you to go too,” Ed said—now standing beside me.


I looked around. The field was almost completely cleared. The bonfire was still burning, and the rabbit-masked figures were shuffling away into the woods in their usual grotesque manner. Only three of us remained.
Then, suddenly, the rabbit-masked man spoke:


“Back?” he asked, unexpectedly. “Back… there?”


His voice was awful. Not human at all. It came from deep within—hoarse, barely forming words, like something was lodged in his throat.
Ed and I looked at each other. We were both visibly tense, shocked.


“I don’t know... but you can’t be here,” Ed finally said.


The rabbit-masked figure let out a low, animal-like growl, then turned and began walking toward the woods, following the others.

Ed’s hand was trembling. I had sweat completely through my shirt.


Ed was putting out the fire.
Turns out there was a fire extinguisher in the car. I probably should’ve checked all that on my first day.


“Ed, what are those weird people?” I asked, still staring at the forest where the rabbit-masked figures had disappeared.


Ed looked at me grimly.


“I don’t know, Steve. But they’re the only ones who always show up. I’ve never had the same task twice, but they… they’re almost always here.”


I stared tensely at the forest, but saw nothing. No movement. Not a sound.


“Now help me carry the firewood back,” Ed said once he finished putting out the flames.


We carried the charred logs back to the woods, being very careful not to go any deeper into the trees than absolutely necessary. As much as I feared the field and all the strange things that came with it, I realized I feared the forest more now—because that’s where they had returned to.

When we finished, Ed told me he was exhausted and needed to rest in the car for a bit. I agreed—it seemed like a good idea. The field was nearly pitch-black now, the sun long gone.


There wasn’t much left to do in the car, so I remembered I still hadn’t finished reading through the full list of today’s tasks.
So I started again.


00:45 – Please turn off all light sources and wait for fifteen minutes. If any lights turn back on before the time is up, contact the provided emergency number.

01:21 – Do not let the distorted children play in the field. Instruct them to leave immediately.

03:56 – If the car left in the middle of the field catches fire, let it burn—there’s nothing more to do. If the car remains intact, please move your vehicle away from it.
IMPORTANT: Be mindful of the glowing man. You do not need to send him away—let him remain there.

05:47 – If the sun does not rise, or rises from multiple directions, remain calm—help is on the way.
If the sun rises normally, no action is required.

06:14 – Let the goats graze. They will leave on their own.

11:00 – Great work! Time to go home—your reward awaits, Steve!


This last line threw me off. They had never written anything like that before. Was this something special? Like the nonexistent timestamps? I felt suspicious about the whole thing, but again, the crackling of my radio snapped me out of it.


“Steve, I see you've been busy – Ed spoke over the radio. – The foxes are done, I’ve informed them. An unit is on its way.”


I blinked, lost. Could I have really been reading for so long? I still had half an hour before the fox task – I had just looked at my watch a few moments ago.


“Yeah, I know, Steve – Ed spoke again. – The time’s been a bit strange for a while now. But don’t worry, we’ll handle this too.”


We received a message from the usual number. We needed to turn off all light sources for the unit to arrive. It was awful sitting in the dark. The sky was overcast, not a single star shining, the moon wasn’t visible. And the rain had started to fall.


“Ed? Ed, are you okay? – I spoke into the radio. I couldn’t handle the silence, the darkness anymore.”


“Yeah, I’m here, Steve – Ed replied instantly. – I’m really freaked out.”


“Me too... Is there any change with you...?”


Then, someone knocked on my window. I almost screamed, if they hadn’t immediately quieted me down.


“Please, while we're here, remain quiet” – the figure said from the side of my car.


That’s when I finally saw who they were.
Soldiers—or something like it. They had come from behind my car. Clad in black tactical gear, they practically vanished into the night. Green night vision goggles glowed eerily on their faces. They were heavily armed—they came ready for combat.

The rain kept coming down harder. The soldiers gathered in front of my car. It was hard to make out in the dark, but I was sure there were a lot of them. For a while, they just crouched there. One of them seemed to be signaling or giving silent orders. A rumble of distant thunder rolled across the sky.

Then they moved—marching in formation onto the field—but I couldn’t see what was happening. I waited, tense, crouched behind my steering wheel.


“Steve,” Ed’s voice suddenly came through the radio. “Do you know what the hell’s going on?”


I grabbed the walkie-talkie and quickly reported what I’d seen.


“Some kind of soldiers, Ed. Tons of them. They marched onto the field with a bunch of weapons. One of them told me to stay quiet... I have no idea what this is.”


But then—above the sound of the pounding rain—gunfire erupted. I had no idea what—or who—they were shooting at. In the darkness, I could only see the brief flashes of their weapons. The rain kept pouring, and the gunshots and thunderclaps competed to drown each other out.

Then something slammed into my windshield.
A soldier. Or rather—half of one.

Panic overwhelmed me. I dove beneath the dashboard, curling up as small as I could.
The gunfire continued outside, joined now by agonized screams that filled the night.


I stayed curled up on the floor of the car for as long as I could. Eventually, the gunfire and screaming died down. But the rain kept pouring, and the lightning struck closer and closer, illuminating the entire field in stark, terrifying flashes.

Then my phone pinged. Another message.
I crawled out from beneath the steering wheel, trying to reach it where I’d left it on the dashboard. But it wasn’t just one message.
The device was blaring—a constant beeping—as if the same alert was being pushed over and over again:


"ATTENTION!! PLEASE COLLECT THE PACKAGE LEFT BY THE UNIT AND IMMEDIATELY EVACUATE THE AREA. IMPORTANT! DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT THE PACKAGE! YOU HAVE ONLY THREE MINUTES!!"


I was sitting on the car seat, reading that message, when another bolt of lightning flashed across the sky—lighting up the entire field.

Just for a second. But it was enough to make my heart stop.
The field was a slaughterhouse. Bodies and remains were everywhere. Blood-soaked water pooled across the ground, and torn-apart pieces of soldiers lay scattered in the mud.

Not far from me, a beam of light suddenly flicked on. A flashlight—Ed’s flashlight. He was running toward me through the pouring rain.


“Steve! Come on!” Ed shouted.


That was all I needed to hear. I jumped out of the car and we both ran toward the field—into the mountains of corpses.


It was disgusting. We were slipping and sliding through mud, blood, and intestines.
I stepped into a torn-open chest, slipped, and wiped out hard—for a moment I thought I might not get back up.
Ed yanked me up from the ground.


“You okay?!” he shouted through the pouring rain.


“Yeah!” I screamed back. “Ed, what the hell are we even looking for?!”


“I don’t know, Steve! Anything! Anything that looks important!”


We had no choice. Three minutes. We started tearing through the bodies, inspecting everything that looked like it might be useful to the Company. All the while, we were soaked to the bone, throwing aside blood-drenched limbs, desperately searching for whatever the hell it was.


“HERE, STEVE! THIS IS IT! I THINK THIS IS IT!” Ed screamed, flailing his arms.


He was holding a silver briefcase. Ed waved frantically, gesturing for me to run with him to his car, to get the hell out.

As best I could in that nightmare of muck, I started making my way out of the field. But I stepped on a severed soldier’s head, which slipped out from under me—and I crashed face-first into the corpses and sludge.

By the time I gathered myself, Ed was already at his car, fumbling with the keys, trying to start the engine.

That’s when my car exploded.

The blast was deafening. A column of flame lit up the night sky, casting harsh light across the horrific battlefield the field had become.

I looked at Ed. He looked back—just for a moment.

Then the roar of the explosion swallowed everything.
I’d been too close. The shockwave threw me through the air. Then everything went black.
