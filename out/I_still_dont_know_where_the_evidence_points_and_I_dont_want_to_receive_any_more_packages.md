Hey, folks, it's L again, you can read  the [Part 1 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16y378k/i_dont_know_where_the_evidence_points/)

First of all, i want to thank everyone for the comments and messages of support I received in my inbox after my last post. You're all helping me keep my sanity as I continue to deal with this bizarre situation.

Now, let me tell you what has happened since that eerie message I received the night before. "I know he spoke to you." That phrase kept echoing in my mind; it was clearly a reference to the fact that Rafael had called me. But who could send a message to a powered-off cell phone? At that moment, panic set in. I plugged in my phone and turned it on. Nothing. There were no messages.

The next morning, I woke up with a sense of unease. My phone was by my side, seemingly normal. The first thought that crossed my mind was that the message might have been just an electronic nightmare, but something didn't feel right. There was a strange odor in the air, as if something had burned. When I picked up my phone, the screen was completely black, and the device was hot to the touch.

I called a tech-savvy friend, and he told me that my phone was "bricked," which meant the software had been irreparably damaged. This explained why the message had disappeared. I wondered who could have done this and why.

The next day, I decided to visit Rafael's house again. His family was growing increasingly concerned, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something very strange was happening in our town. I spoke to Rafael's mother, Dona Maria, and she shared information that left me even more intrigued. She mentioned that in the days leading up to his disappearance, Rafael had been acting paranoid, constantly looking over his shoulder and behaving as if he were being followed. Moreover, he spent hours locked in his room, whispering on the phone and leaving the house late at night. She had no idea who he was talking to or what he was doing.

These new details served as a guide for my investigation. It had been over a month since Rafael's disappearance, and time was running out.

That's when I overheard a conversation at the local market that caught my attention. Someone mentioned that an old resident of the town, known for his stories about urban legends and supernatural events, had recently returned to São Miguel das Águas. He used to tell chilling stories about the town's dark past, including rumors about the symbol that was now appearing everywhere. Some of you mentioned the possibility of a cult or sect, so I decided to seek out this strange man for more information. From what I heard, he was living in an isolated house on the banks of the river that ran through the town. In the late afternoon, I grabbed my bike and headed there. The house was surrounded by tall grass and ancient trees, and it appeared to have been neglected for years. The windows were dusty, and the door creaked loudly when I pushed it open (which made me take a slight step back).

Inside the house, the darkness was deep, almost palpable, and I could barely make out the outlines of furniture covered with sheets. I treaded carefully, calling out the man's name who lived there (we'll call him Pedro). After a few moments of silence, I heard a hoarse voice coming from one of the dark rooms.

"Who's there?" Pedro asked, his voice trembling with fatigue.

"Mr. Pedro, I'm L, I just wanted to know some things about what's been happening," I explained, and he finally appeared in the faint light coming through the window.

He was a man with gray hair, thin and hunched, with tired eyes that seemed to have seen things most of us couldn't even imagine. His skin was weathered, likely from years of working in the sun, and his mustache was yellowed from tobacco. He wore a long, worn-out coat that reached down to his feet. He agreed to share what he knew about the spiral symbol, the strange events in São Miguel das Águas, and the possible connection to Rafael's disappearance. When he agreed, I grabbed my phone (which was now an old one my dad had loaned me) and started recording. Here's the transcription:

Me: "So, what do you know about the spiraled symbol?"

Pedro: "More than I'd like to. They appeared here a while back, I think in 1970. I was around 17 or 18 at the time."

Me: "Did they do anything similar to what they're doing now?"

Pedro: "Sort of. It was a rural area back then, you know, a small town with a lot of farms. They invaded one, killed a calf, and drew the symbol with its blood on the barn wall. It was quite a welcoming card."

I was deeply disturbed by this.

Me: "That sounds awful."

Pedro: "It was. Especially when it's your parents' farm, and your bedroom has a window facing the barn. I've never screamed that much, not even when I broke both my legs jumping into the river."

He let out a faint, brief, and sadder-than-happy laugh.

Me: "Wow... I... I don't even know what to say. Were there any other incidents from this group?"

Pedro: "Oh, yes, definitely... It wasn't just calves; some other farms lost cattle, sheep, and even chickens. The breaking point was when they kidnapped a classmate. We were close to graduation at the time, and it was a field day for those vulture tabloids, exploiting 'the drama of the lost boy.' His name was (he goes silent for a few seconds) Ru-Rubens, I think, Rubens Bezerra, that's right."

Me: "And do you know what happened to him?"

Pedro: "Well, he never showed up again, so I believe he must have died."

Me: "I'd like to wrap up, so I just want to know, sir, do you believe there's any connection between..."

My voice was interrupted, and sounds of claws gripping wood ensued. A Murucututu landed on the man's window. I don't know the English equivalent for this species, but to describe it, it's a white and black-feathered owl with large yellow eyes. Like all good Brazilians from the countryside, we're very superstitious, especially the elderly. After it entered, Pedro began shouting at the animal and told me to leave, saying it was a bad omen and that I shouldn't have come after him (which makes me believe I won't have another chance to interview him). Here are some words I picked up amid his shouts:

Pedro (yelling): "GET OUT...(EXPLETIVE)....IT'S ALWAYS YOU....DEVILISH CREATURE....(ANOTHER EXPLETIVE)....IT'S YOUR FAULT!"

I genuinely felt sorry for Mr. Pedro, a mind affected by years of isolation, a traumatic scene in his head, and all of this in an environment that fueled his imagination. I hope to make further progress, and I really need to do it quickly. The police intercepted a package for me and asked me to see it, already warning that it would be a gruesome sight. Even though I had mentally prepared myself to find another part of my friend, this was much more sinister; I couldn't have imagined it in a million years. When we opened the box, what was inside was indeed my friend's finger, positioned vertically between the lips of a bovine head, in the typical hushing gesture we make, you know, a "shhh." The eyes had been replaced with glass spheres bearing that mysterious symbol. I really hope we find Rafa as soon as possible; I don't want to receive another package...
