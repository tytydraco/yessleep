Lilith was more than my best friend. She was more than a sister. She was my soulmate. She told me so after only having known her for less than a week almost twenty years ago. I didn’t say anything back when she said it.   
It was so fucking awkward.   
I’m so fucking awkward.  
I knew she was right though.  
\-  
We met when I started working as a therapist out of a rundown office in Louisville.  
I was sitting in a dive by myself, doing my best to clear their shelf of bourbon. I had received word that one of my patients who had been seeing me for over six months had taken his own life. He was only thirteen.  
There was a woman there who was scanning through the men in the bar like she was trying to pick out the freshest dish in a buffet filled with twice warmed over options.  
She stood out as much as I blended into the background.  
She was in this black thing that cut off just under her butt and squeezed her perfect boobs up to her chin. I was in sweatpants, no bra, and a ratty sweatshirt that I had been wearing for two days straight.  
We were night and day.  
Mutt and Jeff, she would say later. We couldn’t be more different.  
She kept looking over to me.  
After an hour or so of pretending to be entertained by the guys who were buying her drinks, she walked over and asked if she could sit with me.  
I don’t know why I started talking with her. Maybe it was because I was drunk. Maybe it was because she made me feel like nothing in the world meant anything to her at that moment except for me and what I was going through.  
Ethically and legally, I couldn’t be specific about any details of what happened to my former client, but I gave her generalities.  
I had never spilled my guts to anyone in my life about anything. By the end of the night, the right sleeve of my sweatshirt was damp from tears and snot.   
She helped me home that night.  
There’s barely been a day since then that I haven’t seen her.  
\-  
Lilith was the same age as me. She was originally born in Egypt, but she told me she came to New York when she was ten. Her accent was an uppercrust mishmash that was impossible to pin down.   
Her voice was as beautiful as the rest of her.  
She lived modestly, but she appreciated the finer things in life, with the exception of guys. For some reason she liked trash.  
The douchiest of douches.  
One time I asked her why she went after guys like that.   
“I was born this way. I can’t help it. They give me what I need.”  
In all the time I knew her, she never went out with a guy more than once. At first I suspected she was a terrible slut. I came to know that she was absolutely a terrible slut. What are you gonna do?  
Nobodies perfect, but she was perfect for me.  
Until she wasn’t.  
\-  
We ended up sharing an apartment for almost nine years. It was honestly the happiest I had ever been. We were inseparable. I tried not to bring my troubles and tragedies home from work, and she never brought any of her guys home.   
She didn’t work. She told me that she lived off of her parents. I never met her parents. I never met anyone from her past.  
The only friends she had were ones that I had made. The only family she spent holidays with was mine. She didn’t like to talk about her past. She told me that she didn’t want to lie to me and left it at that.   
She was open about everything else, but the past was something that was dead to her.  
\-  
I met Jim and it was over for me. The perfect guy. We dated for a year before he finally convinced me to move in with him.  
Lilith was never really ok with him. She never said anything, and she got along with him great, but I could tell.  
I wish she would have said something in the beginning. I probably would have listened to her.  
I never told her the one thing about Jim I didn’t like. I didn’t tell her because I knew what she would have said.  
He had a large mirror on the wall in front of the bed. I hated it, but it was his thing.  
Everything else about him was perfect.  
That’s what I thought anyway.  
\-  
Life went on. Lilith and I were still together everyday. Jim was good to me.  
Four years ago Jim and I married. The next year, we had Jessica.  
That’s when the cracks started to show.  
It’s funny how rot works sometimes.  
By the time you get any clue that something is wrong, the problem has already been spreading underneath a calm and healthy looking surface for quite a while.  
It’s what’s under that perfect surface that ruined my life.  
\-  
Jim looked at me differently after Jessica was born.   
I assumed it was because I was a mom. I know some men don’t exactly get their engines turned on by a tired young mother, I just never figured Jim for one of them.  
Turns out, it was because I was home more often. He didn’t have the freedom to pursue his other interests.  
\-  
Lilith was everything I could ever want in an Aunt for Jessica. It was like she looked at her like her own child. I loved her for that. Now I hate her for it.  
\-  
Three weeks ago, everything changed.  
I had gone out with my friends to see a concert. Lilith was sick, so she stayed home.  
Jim stayed home with Jessica.  
As far as I knew, everything was fine.  
I never got any panicked texts or calls, so I just assumed everything was fine.  
\-   
I got home late, and Jim was gone. Jessica was asleep in her bed.  
I looked through the house.  
His car was still in the driveway, but some of his clothes were taken out of the closet and one of his suitcases was gone.  
I called his phone, but it was off.  
After two days of nothing, I filed a police report.  
\-  
Lilith was there for me. She was there for Jessica.  
She never insinuated that Jim had left me. She was just there for me.  
Soulmates.  
\-  
I was a wreck.  
For two weeks, Lilith stayed with us.  
Every time Jessica started looking for her Daddy, Lilith would start playing with her to put her attention on something else.  
I finally told Lilith that Jim and I had been having problems. She just listened.  
\-  
Eventually she had to go home, and that’s when it happened.  
I was sitting on my bed, half drunk. I took turns staring at the floor and that awful mirror.  
It got to the point where I couldn’t look at myself anymore. I walked over to the mirror and tried to pull it off the wall, but it wouldn’t budge.  
I grabbed a hammer and a crowbar from the garage and tried to pry it off of the wall. I was surprised when I heard something break and then the mirror swung forward on hinges that were hidden on one side.  
It was a two way mirror. There was a small compartment behind it. There was a camera pointing forward. It was hooked up to a small laptop.  
There were a few thumb drives inside, along with some DVD’s and some old home video tapes and an old VCR.  
\-  
I had more to drink before I turned on one of the DVD’s. It was my husband, in our bed with a woman I didn’t know.  
There was a picture of us on the nightstand in the background.  
I kept drinking.  
Lots of videos. Lots of women. They didn’t know they were being taped.  
My husband was a predator.  
I finally got up the courage to look at the camera.  
The battery was dead. I plugged it in and started the last file that was recorded.  
It was from the night he disappeared.  
\-  
The camera started and I was looking through the mirror to the bedroom. I could see Jim hiding the remote that he used to start it. He started some music before he left.  
After a couple of minutes, he walked back in with Lilith.  
They were all over each other.  
She stopped kissing him when she heard the music.  
“This is Amy’s favorite song.”  
“Yes it is.” He smiled and then started kissing her neck.  
“That doesn’t bother you?”  
Jim chuckled in between kisses.  
“It actually gets me really hot.”  
“Sshhhh… We don’t want to wake up Jessica.”  
“I gave her Nyquil. She’s not waking up for a while.”  
“Wow… you’ve thought of everything haven’t you?”  
The son of a bitch was laughing and smiling.  
\-  
Lilith made him take off his clothes and lay down on his back with his head at the foot of the bed. He was looking into the mirror. She walked to the mirror and stared at herself.  
I wanted to reach through the screen and wrap my hands around her throat.  
She smiled.  
“I want you to watch. That’s your thing isn’t it?”  
“Yeah. What’s your thing?”  
Lilith looked at her eyes in the mirror.  
“An abnormality of evolution.”  
“What?”  
“Be quiet.”  
I watched my “soulmate” take off her clothes and climb on top of my husband and they started. They were both looking into the mirror.  
I was sobbing and my life was in pieces, while my husband and my soulmate were smiling at me from the screen.  
It was about to get worse.  
\-  
Lilith had clasped both of her hands around my husband’s, pinning them to the bed.  
“I wish I found out who you were a long time ago, Jim.”  
“Really? Why?”  
“I would’ve done this with you sooner.”  
Jim started laughing.  
“You wanna know what my “thing” is, Jim?”  
“Hell yes.”  
“Close your eyes.”  
My awful, cheating husband giggled like a fool and did what she asked.  
“You’ll know when to open them.”   
I don’t know why I kept watching. I wish I hadn’t.   
Lilith’s body started to jerk slightly. She kept telling my husband to keep his eyes closed.  
Her skin lightened and it kept getting lighter.  
I reversed the video and watched it again. I was sure the video was screwing up. Some kind of digital pixelated fuckery.  
It wasn’t.  
My husband started screaming in pain and cursing at her.  
Lilith put one of her hands over his mouth.  
Jim took his free hand and pushed it against Lilith’s chest, trying to push her off of him. I watched his hand push into her flesh. Her skin looked like it was absorbing his hand.  
Lilith’s body became almost translucent. Like some kind of milky jellyfish in the shape of Lilith. I could see what looked like veins running all throughout it. They were glowing a vibrant yellow and pulsating.   
I could see my husband’s hand and the other part of him that was inside of her, starting to dissolve into a red soupy mess inside of her flesh.  
Her head moved close to my husband’s face. Her face changed its shape. It looked like me.  
“You should have been better to her Jim. This is your fault.”  
His screams started to sound like gurgles and I could see that her hand was spreading down and beginning to envelope his face.  
Her body, for lack of a better word, melted and spread over my husband.  
I screamed while I watched my husband’s body twitch and spasm while it was being absorbed into the gelatinous thing that was covering every inch of him.  
I watched him turn into soup inside of it. I watched the bones go through the same process.  
\-  
When my husband was no longer there, I watched Lilith’s skin go back to normal.  
There wasn’t even a spot of blood on the bed. It was like Jim was never there.  
I watched her put on her clothes and pack my husband’s suitcase.  
\-  
The video continued until the power on the camera eventually went off.  
I passed out.  
\-  
I woke up the next morning to the phone ringing. It was Lilith. I was afraid if I didn’t pick up, she would come over.  
“How are you this morning?”  
“I’m fine.”  
“Are you? You sound weird.”  
“I’m… I’m fine. I just drank too much last night.”  
“You want me to come over and help with Jessica?”  
“No! Uh… give me a few minutes to wake up. Can I call you back?”  
“Sure.”  
\-  
My heart was pounding while I packed a bag as fast as I could and then I ran out of the house with Jessica. When I had driven over an hour away, I pulled over and called the police. I told them what I saw. I told them to go to my house and watch the video on the camera.   
When I got off of the phone with them, I kept driving.  
Lilith tried to call me. I turned my phone off.  
I didn’t stop driving for hours. I kept thinking that I saw her car behind me.  
The whole time I drove, I thought about all those guys she “dated”. I thought of how I never saw a single one of them twice.  
\-  
I checked into a motel in Texas just over the state line.  
After Jessica finally fell asleep, I turned my phone back on. There were a bunch of texts from Lilith.  
I didn’t read them.  
I called the police again.   
“You need to come in and give a statement.”  
“I’m not coming back to that town. Did you see it? Did you watch the video?”  
“We have yes.”  
“Am I crazy? Did I really see that?”  
“You’re not crazy, but you need to come in.”  
“Did you find her?”  
“No. Not yet.”  
“What?!”  
“We have no idea where she is. That’s why we need you to come in.”  
I hung up the phone. I started crying.  
Those text messages were just waiting to be opened.  
I finally decided that I couldn’t push it off any longer.   
  
*“I'm sorry. I’m so sorry. I drove to the house after I got off the phone with you. I knew something was wrong. I went inside and I found all the videos. I had no idea he was doing that, I only knew that he had been cheating. I know what you saw. I just wanted to make sure he didn’t hurt you anymore. You were just supposed to think he left. It wasn’t supposed to be like this.”*  
  
*“Please answer me”*  
  
*“You called the police on me. I get it. I’m not mad. Please answer me”*  


*“I can’t help what I need to do to stay alive.I’ve been around for a very long time, and I’m going to be around for a long time. I never realized how lonely I was. I don’t know why I started talking to you that first night. I’ve never met anyone like you. I can’t live without you or Jessica. You’re my soulmate. Please call me.”*  


Every noise I heard outside of the motel that night made me jump. Every time I heard a voice in the parking lot, I was convinced it was her. I worried that she would find me.  
I cried until I fell asleep.   
\-  
When I woke up yesterday morning, I had two more texts.   


*“I’m not letting you leave me. I’m not letting you take Jessica from me. You’re never going to be rid of me, I won’t allow it. I can look any way I want. I can sound any way I want. I don’t have to be Lilith. I can be anybody. You can’t go through life without someone there for you. I’ll be one of them. Maybe I’ll be all of them. After you’re gone, I’ll still be there for Jessica. Maybe I’ll be there for her children too. It’s the best of both worlds Amy. You never have to see me again, and I’ll still get to be with you and Jessica. See you soon. Soulmates.”*  
  
The second text was a picture of my car outside of the motel and some lyrics from my favorite song.   


*“If you never wanna see my face again, I’ll understand*  
*If forever gets lonely, Take my hand”*  
  
I can’t ever trust anyone in my life again. She… it… will never leave me or my daughter. What am I supposed to [do](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/)?
