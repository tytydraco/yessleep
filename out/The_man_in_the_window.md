I’ve never thought of myself as someone who scares easily. I’ve worked night shifts for years, walked home through sketchy areas, and lived in some weird neighborhoods. You get used to ignoring things that feel a little… off. Your mind plays tricks when you're tired. At least, that’s what I used to believe.

Last December changed that.

I’d just gotten off a long shift—I'm a nurse, and night shifts can either be completely dead or absolutely insane. That night was the latter. I was drained, both mentally and physically. When I finally got home around 3:30 a.m., all I wanted was tea and silence. My apartment is on the second floor of an old duplex, just outside the city. It’s quiet, with mostly older residents and not a lot of activity at night.

One of my habits is leaving the blinds open in my living room. The big window faces the street, and there’s an old-fashioned streetlamp right outside that gives off this dull orange glow. It makes the place feel warm, lived in—even when I’m alone.

That night, as I sat on my couch sipping tea, I glanced out the window.

That’s when I noticed it.

Across the street is this old Victorian house. Beautiful place, but it’s been vacant for months. The previous owners moved out after a pipe burst and ruined most of the ground floor. Ever since, it's just sat there—quiet, dark, lifeless.

But tonight, a light was on.

Not a bright one, more like a flickering glow. Candlelight. That’s the only way I can describe it. It looked dim and unstable, almost like firelight. I leaned closer to the glass, frowning. That’s when I saw him.

There was a man standing in the upstairs window of that house.

He wasn’t moving. Just standing there, still as stone, facing my direction. I couldn’t see his face clearly—just the outline of a tall, thin figure in dark clothing. At first, I thought it was a mannequin or a trick of the light. But then he moved.

He leaned forward.

Slowly. Deliberately. Like he was trying to get a better look at me.

I felt my stomach drop. Something about it felt wrong—not just eerie, but threatening. I’ve seen enough weird behavior to know when something’s off, and this was deeply off.

And then… he was gone.

One blink and the figure had vanished. No movement, no fading away. Just there one second, gone the next. The light went out too, like someone blew out a candle.

I stared at the empty window for a long time. Tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was a squatter. Maybe kids snuck in with a flashlight. Maybe I was so tired I imagined it.

I was almost convinced—until I turned to pick up my tea again.

That’s when I noticed movement in the reflection of my own window.

It was fast. A blur behind me.

I spun around immediately, heart pounding.

No one there.

I stood in the middle of my living room, lights on, silence thick around me. I checked the bathroom, the kitchen, the hallway. Doors locked. Nothing out of place.

But then I looked back at the window.

And that’s when I saw them.

Two handprints. Faint, greasy smudges. Pressed against the outside of the glass.

Second floor. No balcony. No fire escape. No trees near the window. Just two handprints, like someone had been leaning in… watching me.

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat on the couch, lights on, staring at the window until the sun came up.

The next morning, I called my landlord, told him I had a family emergency, and asked if I could break the lease. I didn’t even give a full explanation. I just needed out.

I moved out two weeks later. Haven’t been back to that street since. I still don’t know who or what I saw in that window—or how those handprints got there.

All I know is this: I never leave my blinds open at night anymore. And if you ever see something watching you from a window… don’t stare back.

Because sometimes, it stares back harder.
