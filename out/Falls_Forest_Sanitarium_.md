Welcome to The Fall's.
 Here we have a beautiful 50 acres of land surrounding us on every side. This location has been working to heal people since the early 1900's. It has been passed down through generations of the same family, and will continue to be operated by the same group of people for as long as it's possible. The director of The Fall's is Sheri Farmer, who's Great-great-great grandfather founded this location.  She's been running the show for twenty years now and loves visiting the residents and employees alike. 

Most of her days are spent doing paperwork and making sure the schedule is adhered to. She does, however, stop in at random times to play backgammon or blackjack, to watch tv with the residents or sit on the bench and have conversations. The next in line is her oldest daughter, Dr. Autumn Farmer. Autumn has had a passion for mental health her whole life and has grown up skipping through and talking to everyone here who would listen. She grew up with some of the residents that are life long residents. They love her dearly. She loves them right back. 


Nurse Audrey and Dr. Autumn work in tandem to give our residents the best available care. There are weekly resident get-togethers where family are welcome to join, but when you visit please don't bring anything dangerous with you as this is a sanitarium, we do have some residents that can't understand the concept of safety.
Per that: 
Visitors must check all weapons or possible weapons, paraphernalia, and lighters once you get here. More details on that later. 

That's what the brochure that was left under my wipers said. I live in a downtown loft. Smack dab in the middle of the city, hundreds of cars surrounding my parking spot. Mine was the only one with the brochure. It was strange to walk outside and see something flapping on my windshield. Originally I was cussing myself for parking in an area I wasn't supposed to, I thought it was a ticket. When I got closer I was able to clearly make out pictures of trees and other nature with a giant mansion, right in the middle. I picked it up, looked closer and there were birds flying in the sky. It looked like someone took a photo and painted it exactly. Just in case I haven't been clear, it was beautiful.

 I had no use for a brochure for a sanitarium, but I kept it just for the painting. I pinned it to my fridge with a magnet, so my friends and I could laugh at the one off promotion. It has been a few weeks now since I received this folded up brochure. I have been seeing things- dark figures in the middle of the night that could be dismissed as just a shadow or a pile of clothes. I hear people whispering my name and once I swear I heard someone walk in my bathroom while I was showering to turn the bathroom lights off. When I went to turn the lights back on, no one was there. I searched my entire loft and there was no sign of anything. All my doors and windows were shut and locked. I called my sister Meridith to come stay the night with me. I feel like I'm being watched. Hopefully she'll get here soon and she'll be able to talk me down. I hate this feeling. 

Update 1:
Meridith is here, she checked everything for a second time and now we're watching The princess and the Frog. Hopefully I'll be able to get some rest tonight, I'm dead exhausted.

Even though Meridith snores I was able to get some good rest for the first time in weeks. Nothing like a sister sleepover to help feeling lonely. She'll be here for the next couple of days to make sure I'm okay. 

Day 2 of Mer being here. I swear I heard her come in the house. My doorknob is loud. I heard her use her keys and stayed on the couch unassuming. My loft opens into the kitchen. Weird setup I know,  I hollered for her telling her where I was. The kitchen lights turned on and I heard footsteps. My cell rang and it was Mer. I answered. "Why are you calling me if you're in the kitchen?" She said " What are you talking about? I'm still 7 blocks from your place." When I say I sprinted for my front door, I mean I ran like I was in high school track again going for first place. I made it to the kitchen to see the lights in there were totally off and the door was locked . I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

Day 3 was the worst of it, there were shadows everywhere. I heard someone breathing in my ear while I was changing. I felt like I can't do anything without being watched. While cooking dinner with Mer, she saw the brochure that I had brought up a few times over the phone. We had a decent laugh about the idea of a bunch of crazies all in a mansion. She's understandably worried about me. Her friend has a really great therapist she wants me to get ahold of. 


I called the therapist, there's an appointment open next week, wish me luck. First therapy session ever. 
Therapy update:
 It was weird having someone ask about my medical and mental history. I know it's his job to remember things but the incessant typing while I'm telling what seems to be my entire life history was frustrating. I've never enjoyed being analyzed, I was hoping it would be more back and forth. Listen, write, then remember. The clack clack of the keyboard. Sometimes noises make me feel rage deep in the pit of my stomach. I'll go to one more appointment but at this rate it's doing more harm than good. 


Therapy is supposed to help you feel better right? I've had 4 appointments and I just feel angrier, everytime it's over. My therapist tells me absolutely nothing original, just repeats back to me what I'm saying in his own words. I know that's "active listening" but I don't want to keep talking about all of my problems and not being given real solutions. New things are happening, every day now. I've reached out to my friends and my sister but no one really understands what's going on anymore. They tell me it's all in my head. That I'm stressed about because of the newness of everything.  I'll be fine when I get adjusted and into a new routine. I am not fine. I can never tell what's real anymore. I hear people talking to me, that definitely aren't there. I see things happen right before they actually do. I'm convinced there's something truly wrong with me. It's like evil is following me everywhere. I hear them talking about me, whispering about me. They make plans with me but decide that they're busy that day or just don't come and send some sorry excuse for why they couldn't make it. I feel even more alone now than I've ever before. Even Mer has stopped taking my calls. I miss my sister. I know she's busy but I can't believe we grew apart so quickly. 
The last day she was here, she got a call from our Dad, well our biological father. He called to tell her he was sick and she needed to come home and take care of him. She only spent 3 days with me and was super sympathetic but of course George couldn't possibly fathom anyone else having more important problems. We fought about how she's not obligated to do anything for him now that's she's an adult. 

He feels no remorse taking anything from me. Especially not his eldest daughter who was always independent. Especially not the one who never asked for help. I learned at a very young age to take care of myself but Mer was the baby. So I raised her. Unfortunately with a dad like ours, she's been taught that she owes him for making sure his "little girl" was taken care of when she was young. 


No one checks on me.  No one cares how I am. I may as well just end it all at this point. At least I wouldn't be a burden on anyone else. I'm sorry Mer. I love you. 

I was not supposed to wake up. Where am I? Why is it so bright? Why can't I move my arms? I hear my mom. Mom? Mom, help. 

"Ms. Zaster? I have some questions for you. Are you feeling up to a little chat or do you want me to come back later?" The doctor, I think, said with a hesitant approach. 
Shit. That's not my mom. 
"Hey, no no you can stay it's fine. I'm up for a chat. What do you want to ask?" Okay me, you're making me seem eager. Stop that. 
"Well Ms.Zaster" 
"Ashley's fine" 
"Okay Ashley, what's the last thing you remember?" 
 I don't want to think about this again. " The last thing I remember is being in my loft and wishing I was dead. I've been seeing and hearing things that aren't there for weeks now. No one believes me. I'm so alone. All my friends, family and coworkers want nothing to do with me anymore, I feel like I'm just a burden." 
"Okay Ashley, I hear what you're saying and I'm so sorry you've been feeling that way. You said this has been going on for weeks now? Did you have something stressful happen that caused you to start feeling like that?" She sounds like my therapist. Ugh. 
" I just moved into my dream house. I'm away from most of my friends and family though. I started a new job as a doula with a private midwife company.  Fresh out a terrible relationship so I'm actually living the best life I could, aside from being isolated. " 
What are you doing Ashley? Stop being so honest. 
"Okay, Ashley. That's a lot of big changes all in one. Sounds like it's definitely been stressful for you to not be able to depend on anyone." 
I scoffed at this statement. Feeling almost attacked.
"I don't need to depend on anyone" 
"Well Ms. Ashley everyone needs a good village that they can look to for support, even if it's just a pick me up from a friend." She sounds almost apologetic here. 


My head hurts. Well, my whole body hurts but mostly my head. Every movement hurts. Even just the regular twitches like fire searing my nerves. She told me that I tried to jump, once I was done answering her questions. I only live on the 3rd floor so I basically just bounced off someone's car. I broke a couple ribs, have a concussion and my ego is bruised but they're saying that it looks good as far as physical healing and recovery goes. There's that word. Healing. Where did I see it recently? 


I'm getting released from the hospital today, so I'll be picked up by Mer seeing as I can't drive until I've recovered from my concussion. Partially , I feel relieved as I can't sit up without feeling like I'm breathing too much. My vision is blurry but with every heartbeat my eyes see it. I am both excited to see Meridith and not looking forward to having to baby anyone. Here's hoping she doesn't expect much from me. It's dark out but I have my release paperwork in hand.  Meridith just got here. She looks like she's been crying. This drive is going to be rough on both of us. 


I'm home now. My cat has been worried about me. He won't leave my lap. He's always been clingy but it's different now. He won't even let me up to go to the bathroom. Now that I think about it, this is the first time he hasn't seen me for longer than a few hours. Poor Sammy. He's being extra kitten like, kneading and suckling on my blanket. He doesn't normally sleep with me but at this rate he'll probably want to sleep in my arms. 


Meridith is staying with me for a few days, much to George's dismay. Neither of us feel like cooking tonight so we'll be ordering takeout. Maybe we'll watch a movie while we're eating. I don't know if my head can handle that right now. 

Well that conversation went about as swimmingly as I expected it to. Meridith asked me why. I didn't know how to answer without making her feel like she was being blamed. She is my little sister and she looks up to me. We've  always been close even with the age difference, so saying that I feel alone made her feel like chopped liver. She still doesn't understand and feels like it's her fault. I tried to show that I was understanding of the obligations she has to George. However, she knew what was going on and left me anyway. Abandonment trauma? Amirite? 


Well good morning to me. 
My therapist fired me today. Did you know they can do that? I had no clue until he called me and said "I'm sorry Ms. Zaster, you just need more help than I can offer you. I've got some great references for inpatient therapy if you're interested in that." Good. I didn't like him anyway. I've never been fired in my life so this a new sensation. Who would have thought I would enjoy it?  Remind me to tell Mer her friends referral sucked. 


While we were talking, I was sitting on my barstool and the brochure flickered in the wind. 
"Actually, no thank you. I have a place in mind." 
"Okay Ms. Zaster, I wish you well and hope your healing process is easy." 
Now I remember where I saw that word recently. The brochure. The brochure for the Sanitarium. Seriously though, who doesn't just call it a mental hospital?

 
I called them. The director seems nice. I have a visit planned for two days from now. I'm scared. I've never been where I am right now. Mer is here at least. She'll be driving me to Fall's Forest for my appointment.

Update Sammy is still clinging to me. Do you think he knows I might be leaving?
