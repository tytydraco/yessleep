Guys. I think this is it, my breakthrough as a content creator.
I know, I know. I've been doing YouTube for years now and barely even have 1,000 subscribers despite trying it all. Gaming, vlogs, reactions, reviews. All of them flopped and yes, I did say that I was ready to give up and just live a normal life with a normal job. 


But hear me out on this one.
I planned to try some urban exploring, y'know, abandoned buildings, the eerie vibes and the thrill of discovery in it. It has it's niche and seems a little popular to a certain demographic of people and as far as I'm aware, there aren't TOO many creators who do this or at least not to the extent of gaming or reaction content creators. Sure there's still a ton who are popular but I thought it could work. Here's where my plan changed though. 


Do any of my older followers remember the PPD? Pinecrest Police Department, the one that got left behind in 1997? Yeah, that place. I figured that it would be perfect to start out - I couldn't find any other videos of people going there, or even mentioning it online, weirdly. A creepy, derelict police station in a quiet and small town? It sounds perfect for this type of stuff right? 


So off I went. I packed my gear, drove out and got to exploring. At first it was everything that you'd expect to be honest. Shattered windows, peeling paintwork, papers scattered everywhere. 
During my exploration, I stumbled upon some VHS tapes scattered all over the floor in the sheriff's office. In total I picked up five, not sure if there are any missing or if they're even in order. 
"The Resonance Incident" seems to be the title, not sure what that is or was, I've never heard of it before.


I really think this could be my huge breakthrough. Is this something they've been hiding from us? I've tried researching online and I mean, I spent HOURS looking for any single headline or video dedicated to it. No records, no conspiracy theories, yet here are the tapes all sat on my desk in front of me.


Oh, and there was one more thing. I decided to make one last stop before heading back home, a little antique shop in the town. I figured that maybe the locals could at least know something? It was worth a shot, I figured. The owner was a guy in his late 60's or early 70's, and was super friendly at first. His entire vibe changed as soon as I mentioned the tapes and station, though. 

I'm talking in a sense that he went incredibly pale and looked at me as if I'd barged in there with a shotgun held up to him. 
He asked me how I knew about any of it, pointing out that I wasn't local and so I explained to him that I'd done some exploring and found these tapes and just wanted to know if I could pry some local insight that hadn't made in onto the internet. 

Weirdly he flat out refused. Not only that but he told me that I needed to leave immediately, that I was never allowed to return to the place.

 I don't know what I've found but I promise you all this much. I'm gonna watch these tapes now and I'll get straight to uploading them and my live reaction. 
Stay tuned.
