Back in 2015, my roommate and I were in our senior year of college. In those four years, we went from sharing the same dorm, to renting a two bedroom apartment off-campus. So, I’d say I knew him pretty well.

One Monday morning, we were working on our capstone projects when we received a flyer from two of our fellow classmates asking for volunteers to test out a gaming system they had developed. Hoping we would be interested in testing it for two weeks, they offered fifty bucks as payment.

Personally, I was all for it. But, having history with the two developers, my roommate had issues. Something about how “any idiot can become an engineer these days”. I didn’t understand it, but sometimes my roommate could be a grouch, so I just took it with a grain of salt.

My roommate and I were avid gamers. Most of our weekends were spent on the living room couch trying to one up each other in some way shape or form, so I knew he secretly wanted to try it out. It took some convincing, but eventually he agreed, and we, along with some other friends, attended the meeting to learn everything we could about a headset they called, Gallus.

To be honest, I thought it was a pretty cool device. Part VR, part smart glasses, the headset was able to analyze your surroundings and incorporate the game into that area. Whatever space was programmed became part of the game itself, and by using your hands, you could select items, shoot targets, and grab objects.

At a time when VR and smart glasses were fairly new to market this was some pretty amazing stuff. And, even though it was a solo thing and we couldn’t play together, my roommate and I were definitely interested in being testers.

Back home in our apartment, my roommate and I decided that we would use our separate bedrooms as a game space; leaving the living room and kitchen free, so we wouldn’t interfere with each other as we played. We then went to work on setting it up.

Turning on the Gallus, it began by asking how many rooms needed to be programmed, and, as per our agreement, I entered the number one. Then, step by step, it analyzed all four walls, the ceiling, and the floor from the center of my room, and, within a few minutes, it was ready to go.

Before I started, I looked through the pamphlets that came with each game. I had no idea what was downloaded. Earlier, when the developers asked what kind of games I would be interested in, I simply told them to surprise me. My only request was that they leave out anything that had to do with horror. I hated horror games; unlike my roommate, who was the first to jump at that opportunity.

My first week with the Gallus was amazing. It felt like I was in a completely new world. I could still see everything in my room, but, with the Gallus, it was all different. For example, one night, my whole room became sand dunes that overlooked the pyramids; another night, my bed was a raft that floated on the ocean. In a different game, I solved puzzles and riddles as I escaped my “locked” room, and, in another, I dodged and smashed large shapes as they flew towards me from every direction.

It was all so captivating, that, before I knew it, I had put hours into the device. In the past week, all I managed to do was eat, sleep, attend class, and game; I almost forgot I had a roommate. So, Sunday night, I decided to check in.

I strolled across the living room and playfully knocked on his door. No response. I knew he was home, his keys were on the kitchen counter, so I tried again. Still nothing. Turning the handle, the door opened slightly.

Instantly, I was hit with a smell that almost brought me to my knees. A musky, sour mixture of urine and body odor filled my nose and stuck to the back of my throat, triggering an immediate gag response. Luckily I hadn’t eaten anything, or the contents of my stomach would have been on the floor.

I tried to open the door further, but something heavy was in the way. With a hard push, the object scraped across the floor, giving me enough room to squeeze through. That’s when I saw him.

His headset was on and his clothes were tattered. Looking like a pale marble statue, he stood in the center of his room, surrounded by a puddle of his own urine. 

I yelled his name, no response. I grabbed something close by and threw it at his chest, still nothing. Not knowing what else to do, I ran over and yanked the headset off.

Immediately, a scream erupted from his mouth, and his arms flailed around as he fought the air in front of him. Dodging the incoming blows, I grabbed his arms and lowered him to the floor, where he curled up feebly into the fetal position.

Horrified, I stared at a deranged, haggard version of my roommate, who looked as if he hadn’t eaten in days. The bags under his eyes stretched well below his cheek bones as if sleep had been ignored for nights on end, and his eyes darted rapidly while he mumbled incoherently under his breath. 

Crouching to get closer, I lightly tapped his shoulder causing him to flinch, but focus on my face. Soon after, the mumbling stopped and he gained control of his breathing. I helped him slowly sit up straight, and, after a few episodes of paranoid fits, he hung his head between his knees and sighed.

I stayed there patiently while he gathered himself, and took in the full view of what had become of his room.

Everything was turned upside down and thrown around the room. His bedside table was wedged against the door, and anything that had been pinned to the walls was now ripped or broken and tossed across the floor.

In complete shock, I looked down at my roommate, who stared up at me with a wide, toothy grin. “I’ll find it,” was all he said.

After getting him to his feet and convincing him to shower, I brought in some cleaning supplies. Thankfully, he insisted on cleaning everything himself, so I made my way to the kitchen to make us some food. 

We sat down to eat, but he hardly touched a thing, claiming that he was too tired and needed to sleep; he had classes in the morning. I reluctantly agreed and watched as he shuffled into his room and closed the door behind him.

Deciding it was time I did the same, I retired to my room and went to bed.

Some time after midnight, I woke suddenly to the same horrified scream from earlier. Launching out of bed, I ran to the living room to find my roommate, with his headset on, standing outside his bedroom and pointing at something inside.

Rushing toward him, fully prepared to knock the Gallus off his head, I noticed that he wasn’t even wearing it over his eyes. Instead, it was pulled back, revealing his full face, which was twisted in complete terror.

Following the direction of his hand, I saw that he was pointing at his bedroom window. The cool breeze inside let me know that it was open, but I didn’t understand why that scared him so much. We lived on the first floor, maybe someone walked by or something. I stuck my head out to look, but all I saw was the plush green grass that surrounded the building. 

Confused, I turned back to my roommate, who was no longer in the doorway. Instead, he was wandering the living room, his headset back on.

Too freaked out to argue with him in this state, I went back to my room, locked the door, and attempted to sleep. We had a midway meeting with the developers later that day, maybe they would have some answers.

Treating that day as normal, I hurried to meet my roommate and grab a bite to eat before my first class. As I crossed the campus, I spotted him in the courtyard and raised my hand to get his attention, but stopped when I noticed him acting strange. 

He was walking with a purpose, his head darting back and forth, as if something invisible was following him. This erratic behavior continued, as he scrambled across the lawn and up the stairs into the engineering building.

Genuinely concerned, I hoped that he was getting help, or at least turning in his Gallus, but I didn’t have time to follow. Instead, I continued to the cafeteria, and I resolved to ask about it later.

When my last class ended, I went to meet the developers. Only one was there, so it was a pretty quick meeting on his end. He asked how everything was going and if I had any problems with the device. I told him that I personally loved the Gallus and thought it worked perfectly, but I was afraid my roommate was having some issues.

The developer confessed that my roommate had come in about that earlier, but he wasn't having issues with the device itself. He was more concerned about a game. Supposedly, he was having a hard time beating it, and had become a little obsessed.

This did sound a little like him, he could get obsessive about gaming, but never this bad. I pressed the developer about the issue, but he insisted that’s all it was. Instead, he offered a solution. He suggested that I play the game myself, maybe I could figure out how to help him.

At the time, it wasn’t a bad idea. There was only one problem, I hated horror games. 

To ease my nerves, the developer assured me that the game wasn’t bad. He even admitted that the objective was simple once you got into it.

Seeing no other option, I took him for his word, and agreed to let him download it.

I came home to a quiet apartment. Taking it as a good sign, I hoped that it meant my roommate was getting a break from the Gallus. Besides, he had nothing more to worry about because I was determined to get whatever he was trying to find.

Firing up the Gallus, I went to the new game, *The Shadow of Hanbi*, and tapped play.

Immediately, the room darkened around me, the only things visible were trace outlines of my furniture and walls. In my ears, an eerie song, much like a broken music box, began to play. The atmosphere alone was enough to make me want to stop, but I had to continue.

Looking around, I saw a dimly lit trail leading to a floating object in the corner of my room. Given my experience with games, I knew it was something I would need. So without hesitation, I walked toward the object, but suddenly stopped mid stride. 

Somewhere behind me, the sound of a high pitched, breathy cackle hit the backs of my ears causing the hairs on my neck to stand up. Unable to move, I listened closely as dragging footsteps slowly approached, getting closer and closer with every step.

I stood board straight, chills running down my spine. A lump formed in my throat, making it hard for me to breathe, and the sound of my heart pounded rapidly in my ears.

Quickly, I reached out and grabbed the object in front of me. The word FLASHLIGHT appeared across the screen, and my hand glowed like a lightbulb.

I twirled around to face whatever it was. Nothing. It was gone. I stood there panting, relieved, but it was only temporary.

Suddenly, the whole right side of my body went on alert as every touch receptor sparked across my arm and leg. Whatever it was, wasn’t gone. In fact, it was standing right beside me. 

Slowly, I turned my head to look right, and instantly lost my breath. Eye to eye with me was a pale, sunken face connected to a black, straggly body. Wiry black strands of hair dangled over massive eyes that bulge from their sockets, locking you in place with dark, empty irises. A thin, angular mouth connected one side of its face to the other, that slowly opened wide revealing bone snapping teeth. The only thing separating us were its two large slender hands that longingly reached out to cup my face.

I couldn’t move on my own, as I watched the creature slowly inch forward. Instead, my body responded automatically by folding up and crumbling beneath me. Once I hit the floor, the Gallus fell off my head, bringing everything back to normal.

Kicking the device to the far side of the room, I sat in silence while tears rolled down my cheeks, and I held in the need to vomit. Never, never again.

I don’t know how long I sat there, it could have been minutes or hours, but eventually I was able to get to my feet.

Starving, but not sure if I could eat, I walked out into the kitchen when again I was stopped mid stride. The apartment door was wide open. 

Running over to the door, I stretched my neck out into the hallway, and looked one way, then the next. I froze with fear. All the way at the end of the hall stood a tall black figure with a pale, sunken face. Lifting its hand, it waved.

Hoping that it was all in my head, I quickly closed my eyes then opened them back up. To my relief, it was gone.

I went back in the apartment, and found everything still in place. The only difference, my roommate’s keys now sat on the kitchen counter. 

Freaked out by the day I was having, the wide open door, and his complete lack of sense, I ran over and banged on his door. No answer. Harder this time, still no answer. I’d had enough. With a hard shove, I burst through, and there he was. 

He was laying across his bed, the headset on, with a twisted look of terror on a pale, lifeless face. The official report said he had a cardiac arrest, but I didn’t believe it.

Several days later, an arrest was made for the harassment and attempted murder of another classmate at our university. Rumors said my roommate's death was tied to that. But, again, I didn't believe it.

I knew it was The Shadow of Hanbi that killed him, and I’ll never believe otherwise. To this day, I still have regrets about how it all went down. I should have talked to him more, or tried harder to help him. Maybe then, he’d still be here.
