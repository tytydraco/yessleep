It started just hours earlier.

The family had just gotten home from a trip out to the beach. I had elected to stay in my room and play video games during that time for obvious reasons.

Dad and Jamie were fine but Mom had a wicked sunburn that spread from her left shoulder down to her lower back.

As Dad looked over her, he noticed a few things. Things that—while not concerning—would require maybe a second glance.

“Jesus, Susan. Looks like a third- or fourth-degree burn. I think we oughta take you to the doctors.”

My mother insisted she was fine, but that turned out to be a lie a few hours later.

She had gone to rest in her room and the rest of us could hear her moaning and crying out in pain. My dad wasn’t going to sit by and let it happen. He elected to take her to the ER.

“You guys go in your rooms; I’m taking her to the doctors whether she wants to go or not, those burns are *bad*.”

So, into our rooms we went. I had plenty to do in ways of entertainment. I wasn’t sure about Jamie, but his intentions were made clear when he knocked on my door.

“Hey, Sam? You got two controllers yeah? Think we could play something together?”

“Sure.”

And so, for the next few hours, we played whatever games we felt like.

It was a Friday, and also summer so we didn’t really care about having a “bedtime”.

The call came at 10:47. It was Dad.

My phone buzzed and I immediately answered.

“Dad? What’s going on? Is Mo—”

“Put ‘im on speakerphone, Sam!”

“Okay.”

Dad was now able to communicate with the both of us.

“Boys? Boys. Your mother, she, uh—she isn’t doing so well. What we thought was a fourth-degree burn is looking more like one that doesn’t exist. Not officially, anyways.”

Jamie spoke up first.

“T—then what is it?”

“It’s not really an official term, but the doctor said it looked more like it might be closer to the severity of what would be a *fifth-degree burn*.”

“Wha—what does that mean?” I asked. I could feel the nervousness through the shaking in my voice.

“Well, we did some tests,” he said, taking a break so he could continue talking without any issues, “it looks like the burn didn’t stop at just the bone.”

Jamie and I looked at each other.

I spoke first.

“The—the hell does that mean?”

“It means—” he said, cutting himself off before finally speaking again, “—it means that it somehow reached the marrow of her bones. The sunburn is affecting her bone marrow.”

We had to take a second. Whatever sun exposure Mom had experienced was so extreme that it not only burned her down to the bone, but it burned her on a level that isn’t medically classified.

I had to ask.

“How—how does it look?”

My dad only had two words to say.

“It’s bad.”

He didn’t end up telling me the details until later. I heard an agonized scream from the other end and it wasn’t hard to connect the dots.

“Hey, I think I’m gonna let you go, now. Jamie and I, we can take care of ourselves. Don’t worry about us.”

“Okay, you boys just stay inside. Especially you, Sam. I’ll check in with you guys in a few hours. God, I think I’m starting to develop a sunburn too, shit.”

And with that, he hung up.

Jamie turned to me.

“Dude, what the hell is happening to Mom?”

“I—I don’t know man. It’s not normal, though. Burned inside the bones? I don’t think—that’s not normal.”

“No, it isn’t. I think we just have to wait and see what happens with Mom and Dad.”

“Y—yeah.” He replied. I noticed a hint of nervousness in his voice.

“Something wrong?” I asked.

He exploded.

“YES! I was out there with them! I went out into the goddamn Sun, Sam! I was *exposed* to it! Now, I’ll say, I wasn’t exposed nearly as much as Mom was but STILL. I think we should check me for any signs of sunburns. Please?”

I didn’t think anything was seriously wrong with Jamie, but just to make sure he was okay, I obliged and checked him.

“Sam? What does it look like?”

“I think you’re fine, Jamie. Just how much time did you spend in the Sun in relation to Mom?”

“She—she was sunbathing while Dad and I went swimming, so you do the math there.”

“Gotcha. So, you weren’t too terribly exposed—not saying you weren’t exposed, just that it wasn’t as bad as Mom.”

“Yeah.”

“Okay, looks fine to me. Are you sure you actually spent any time in the Sun? I can’t see a sign of exposure anywhe—”

My voice caught in my throat.

“Sam? What’s going on?”

“I—uh, shit.”

“What?”

“Your back. Your back, Jamie, it’s on your back.”

There, on Jamie’s left lower back, was the splotchy, blistering red rash signaling the start of what would likely be a nasty sunburn.

“What? What, Sam?!”

“You’ve got a sunburn, man.”

I don’t know what the next few hours are going to be like, but I hope Jamie is okay.

•

Things haven’t gotten better. It’s 1:06 and Jamie has been completely hysterical for the last two hours.

He thinks that what happened to Mom is going to happen to him, and to be honest? I don’t blame him.

I can only imagine how it’d affect me.

As of now, nothing substantial has actually happened to him, but it hasn’t exactly been easy to tell him that.

Dad hasn’t called to update us on Mom’s condition either. Maybe they’re just sleeping, but I don’t know and that scares me.

Every time I try to call, it goes straight to voicemail, so I left him one.

\-Voicemail One-

“*Hey Dad, Jamie and I are doing okay. It looks like he’s got a bit of a sunburn like Mom, but it isn’t nearly as bad as hers. We’re managing, but I need to know; is Mom okay? Call back as soon as you can. Please.”*

I left that at 12:48.

Jamie is still freaking out but I told him it was going to be fine.

I have not told him that Dad hasn’t called or texted at all.

I keep hoping for the best for Mom, but something is making me feel like that isn’t going to happen.

I’m scared for her because Jamie’s sunburn is starting to get worse. He says that it hurts badly and he can feel it inching beneath the skin.

I’m not sure what to do, honestly. I’m not a doctor and I don’t know anyone who is. Also, something weird is happening.

It’s one in the morning, but the Sun is starting to rise. I’m getting really scared now and I don’t know what’s happening.

•

Well, a new development just occurred.

The Sun is rising, it is 1:15 in the morning.

Just a few minutes after the Sun set, I received a call from our next-door neighbor, Ryan.

I was too busy trying to figure everything out and try to get control of the situation with Jamie, who, by the way, isn’t doing good at all. I missed the call so he left me a voicemail. I think I regret listening to it. Regardless, here it is.

\-Ryan’s Voicemail-

“*Sam, are you there man? Some weird shit is happening and I’ve got no clue what to do. I—I think my grandma is dead, dude. Earlier in the day, she was in the Sun or something like that.*

*S—she stayed out there for so long man. Had a wicked sunburn when she came back in, complained about how badly it burned hours later. She said it felt like it was burning in her bones. In her bones, man! What the fuck?!*

*Last I saw of her, she was sat in her recliner in the living room. Her skin—God, her skin was terrible! It was splotchy in some spots, littered with blisters in others and* (Ryan struggled to tap here as he began to dry heave) *it even looked like some spots were peeled down to the bone.*

*But here’s the fuckin’ weird part dude. Her bones looked like they were full of tiny holes—and they looked burnt. There was a spot on her head peeled down to the skull, and a gaping hole exposed the innermost part of her head. She’s not breathing. I think she’s dead.*

*My parents haven’t come home from their date night yet, and I’m scared that something’s happened to them.*

*I’m hiding out in my room now, but fuck man, I’m scared as hell! If you can call, then please do so.*

*Oh—oh god—FUCK! FUCK FUCK FUCK! SHIT! Sam, I’m sorry. I’m starting to develop a sunburn on my hand. Must’ve happened while I was helping Grandma inside. I need to take care of myself now. Sorry.”*

And that was the end of the voicemail. Judging from what Ryan said, I think he as well as his parents and grandma are dead.

I can only assume that my parents suffered the same fate.

Jamie is asking about them now and I’m wondering whether I should lie to him just to make his last moments a little less unbearable.

I’m blocking out all of the windows in the house, I can’t let any sunlight in. I’ve made Jamie as comfortable as possible, but I don’t think he has long.

I’ll update when something substantial happens.

•

7:16.

Sun is fully up now. Dad isn’t answering my calls, neither is Ryan. I think they’re both dead.

Jamie—God, it’s horrible.

Last I checked on him, the entire left half of his face was so badly burnt that it had peeled down to the bone, marrow leaking out of the tiny holes in his skull.

I think he’s dead.

There are so many bodies in the street. People I once knew and greeted as friends in the neighborhood.

Some looked normal, others like they had been skinned.

There were some bodies with everything intact except for the skulls and vice versa.

The police aren’t answering my phone. Nobody is answering the phone.

I managed to blot out all of the sunlight in the one room I’m staying in; my bedroom. It’s fine for now, the house still has power and I can cover up enough to be safe to go and get food from the kitchen, but I’m starting to lose it.

My entire family is dead, and the neighborhood is likely in the same condition. I’m completely and utterly alone. I can’t go outside; there’s not a doubt in my mind that I’ll die painfully if I do.

So, I think I’m going to wait it out. I’ll wait until the Sun sets next. I’ll wait until the next time it gets dark out and I’ll leave. I’ll go somewhere safe.

There has to be someone out there alive. I can’t be the only one. There has to be *someone* alive.

I haven’t run out of food yet, but I need to start planning for when I do.

I’m not so sure about my escape plan after all, because as I look outside, I think I can almost see it getting brighter.

I don’t think the Sun is going to set any time soon, if at all.

So, I’m writing this in the vain hope that someone might see it, that someone might answer my call and try to find me.

The power just went out too. I’m having to use cell data just to post this, I’m losing hope.

I’m going to have to go out soon, the food in the house is going to go bad.

Please, if anyone is reading this, *help*.

The Sun is hurting people, and I don’t know how much longer I’ve got until it does the same to me.

•

The sun finally set, I think I’m going to leave. If I don’t make it, don’t expect an update.
