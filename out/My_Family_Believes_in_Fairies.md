I knew I shouldn't have come home for Thanksgiving.

As I looked at what remained of the bumper of my car in my aunt's driveway in the frosted moonlight of 4am, half-listening to the bleary explanations from my younger cousin on what happened to my car, I couldn't stop thinking about how I had almost stayed back in the city. My apartment would have been a little lonely, but my car would have been intact.

The decision to come back to my tiny rural hometown in Pennsylvania had seemed reasonable at the time, as I had spent an exhausting month navigating the waters of an unexpected, messy breakup with someone I was supposed to spend the holidays with. A few days after I got here, feeling slightly less heartbroken, I realized what an idiot I was for not just enjoying the time to myself.

I had been so scattered that I hadn't even remembered to pack socks, which my cold bare feet in the borrowed pair of my aunt's slippers reminded me of. To try to keep some semblance of warmth, I had my hands deep in the pockets of my frayed pajama pants, a pair I had left behind and forgotten about years ago that I had rediscovered in the back of a closet when I realized I hadn't packed any.

My cousin kept going on and on, walking a few steps towards me and then turning back to the mess. Even though it was obvious what had happened from the crumbled hole in the garage door and the corresponding crumbled hole in my bumper.

I guessed he was trying to find an outlet for his guilt and nervous energy, and also, there was a strong possibility he was trying to walk himself into sobering up.

"I just... I thought I could make it to the store and back before anyone noticed. I didn't realize the brakes were that sensitive, and the garage...fuck, it just came up so fast." He smelled like weed and some kind of sugary candy. He rambled on, his words a jumbled mix of apologies and excuses.

Tyler had come to the door of the spare bedroom I always stayed in about half an hour before, looking a mixture of sheepish and panicked, still dressed in his heavy parka. I had just fallen asleep after a restless few hours lying awake thinking about my ex, Casey, and whether or not it had been smart to end the relationship.

Part of me still felt like this was just a stress-induced bad dream trying to work out my emotions. But it also was very in-character for Tyler to fuck-up, and for me to try to clean up after him.

I took my hands out of my pockets to gesture to the mess, regretting it immediately as the cold bit my fingers.

"Tyler, just...you didn't hit anything, right? And how did you even get the keys?" I asked, my voice somehow sounding even more exhausted than I felt. "Did you go into my purse?"

He shrugged, avoiding my gaze and sounding defensive. "No, of fucking course not, and I found your keys where you left them on the kitchen table. I didn't think it'd be a big deal. We were supposed to go out anyway." His defensive answer made me snort with bitter laughter, given how big of a deal it had become, which set him off again with a spew of excuses and justifications for why he stole my car.

I had begrudgingly agreed that I might drive him to WaWa earlier, but I had felt too jet-lagged and mopey when the time came and told him I wasn't up for it. It seemed he found a way around that.

As he rambled, my attention drifted to my aunt and uncle's house behind us. Its faded white paint was faintly blue in the low light, and it stood as silently as me in the chilly morning air. The patio was spilling over with garden decorations, sculpture supplies, and pieces of half-finished home improvement projects, some of which I recognized from years ago and which were on a seemingly permanent hiatus.

The porch light flickered, casting long shadows on the overgrown lawn, ankle-deep with leaves, almost as high as the field that bordered the property. An elaborate wind chime- one of Aunt Marlie's art pieces- clanged against the window. I looked towards the bedroom on the second floor, wondering if my aunt would sleep through the increasingly heated pitch of my cousin freaking out.

I sighed, my breath white smoke in the too-early morning cold. This was precisely the kind of drama I had hoped to avoid by almost not coming, the kind that always seemed to cling to my hometown like gum under a table no one ever bothered to clean. My parents hadn't even stayed, retiring to Florida the same month I left for college. But here I was, freezing my butt off, staring at the wreckage that was once my reliable sedan.

I was about to say something else when the front door creaked open. Aunt Marlie stood there, wrapped in a thick pink bathrobe, her hair in a messy bun stuck through with a few chopsticks. "What the hell is going on out here?" Her voice was sharp, cutting through the quiet air. Her eyes found the mess, and her face went slack with shock before her jaw tightened in anger. "Are you fucking shitting me, Tyler?"

He seemed to shrink a foot in that instant, shriveling at his normally pathologically cheery mother's rebuke. I just looked at her and shrugged, shaking my head. She had known us both our whole lives, well enough to know who was the perpetrator and who was the victim.

Aunt Marlie sighed heavily, her gaze softening as she looked at the two of us, who must have looked obviously miserable, and me shivering in the cold. "We'll talk about this in the morning. Come inside, both of you. It's freezing out here."

Back in the warmth of the house, we didn't bother turning on the lights, all of us familiar enough with the low light of the nightlights dotted through the hallways. Still looking small and deflated from his mother's scolding, Tyler mumbled a half-hearted goodnight and quickly disappeared upstairs. Aunt Marlie and I exchanged a look, a mix of frustration and understanding, before we headed to our respective rooms, the need for a couple more hours of sleep outweighing the need for further discussion.

I slept fitfully, the image of my ruined car, lit by the flickering porch lamp like a strobe light in a haunted house, replaying in my mind like it had been branded there. In my dream, Tyler drove through the cornfield, laughing and churning up the dirt, coming closer and closer to where I stood, tied to a post and trapped in the middle of the field like a scarecrow.

I woke up with a headache, a sinking feeling in my stomach, and a desperate need for coffee. I went to text Casey, only to remember that we had broken up, and we had gone no contact on top of that. I really felt like venting to the world with a few woeful pictures, but last week, after the breakup, I had installed a 72-hour productivity blocker to stop me from doom-scrolling Casey's socials. I didn't want to burden my friends with more miserable bullshit after leaning on them through the breakup, so I opted just to try to get over it on my own.

Rubbing my temples, I shuffled out of the bedroom in my borrowed slippers and into the living room. It was cluttered with mismatched furniture but cozy, with paintings and photos crowding the walls. They mainly featured Aunt Marlie's favorite mediums of delicate pastel florals and fairies, the signature style that made her a favorite at local craft fairs and farmers' markets. I walked in front of one of my favorites that featured blue cornflowers and elves with toadstool hats, hoping it would lift my mood before I faced whatever gloominess was in store for the day after what happened last night.

Aunt Marlie's art was inspired by the old orchard that grew along the west side of their property. The fallow fields and ancient, gnarled apple trees were muses for her work. Knowing her and the house like I did, I could see them in the paintings, full of fluttering woodland spirits, apple blossoms, and sparkling cornflower-filled meadows.

My aunt loved creating her very own fairy lore. She gave them personalities, vocations, likes and dislikes, and overall did really in-depth world-building, like how the fairies would ride on the backs of dragonflies or how they'd use dandelion fluff to make their beds. She would write her own literal fairy tales about sprites having little adventures in the orchard, helping lost baby animals, or bringing rain to dry patches.

Her parenting style was an extension of her art. She always encouraged Tyler and me to use our imaginations to see the beauty in nature around us. We'd leave out "offerings" for the fairies, like bowls of milk, thimbles of honey, or tiny flower crowns Aunt Marlie taught us to make. It was her way of teaching us to appreciate the world and look for magic in the everyday.

The familiar scent of freshly brewed coffee hit me in a truly everyday magical fashion, and I beelined for the kitchen. Overhead, one of Uncle TJ's custom-made light fixtures, a spiky mesh of metal and colored glass, cast a floral light pattern across the room. He was an artist, too, a sculptor who specialized in welding found metals. Aunt Marlie and Tyler were both already in the kitchen, quiet but obviously stewing.

"Good morning, " I offered to the tensely silent room. I filled a chipped mug with coffee and went to the fridge. There was always a bag of edibles in the vegetable drawer, and I ripped a gummy in half and swallowed it whole, hoping it would relieve the throbbing headache in my temples.

"Hi," Aunt Marlie responded without turning around, immersed in Thanksgiving prep. The counter was a chaotic spread of ingredients, including what I recognized as Tofurky and a towering hodgepodge of other ingredients, cutlery, and bowls.

Tyler just grunted in acknowledgment, slouched over a bowl of cereal in front of him. He was slowly spooning it in, looking like he was still half-asleep, his hair tousled and his movements sluggish. The kitchen table was a large piece of reclaimed wood, surrounded by a quirky assortment of chairs, and I picked my favorite, a repurposed booth seat from an old diner. Tyler didn't make eye contact with me when I sat down, obviously embarrassed about what had happened the night before.

I sipped on my coffee and looked out of the window. The garden was unusually overgrown and wild, scattered with an assortment of objects – garden gnomes peeking out from the tall grass, a few faded decorative stones, and metal sculptures half visible from under the leaves. Everything was winged by the old apple trees and backlit by an overcast, gray sky. The bright colors struggling under layers of dying foliage and chaotic disarray of the normally well-kempt garden reminded me of an abandoned theme park- like you could still hear the echoes of laughter and music from when it was better loved.

Tyler and I grew up immersed in Aunt Marlie's fairy lore. As kids, we'd spend hours exploring the yard, which was brimming with her fantastical influence, hoping to catch a glimpse of them.

Aunt Marlie still took her beliefs seriously. She would leave out small offerings- trinkets, little clothes and bits of food, other bits and bobs as she saw fit- to keep the fairies happy. As I looked out the kitchen window to the garden, at the end of a row of colorful glass bottles, I could see a tiny stone bowl filled with milk on the windowsill, just as it always had been, and a half-eaten shortbread cookie that some lucky critter had munched on.

I felt like Tyler still half-lived in that fantasy world. He'd started smoking pot and dabbling in drugs young, which wasn't unusual at all for our nontraditional family, but now he was doing it in enough excess to worry my aunt and uncle.

And me.

It was like he was still chasing after those fairies, waiting for Peter Pan or his Hogwarts letter. Or maybe he was using our magical childhood memories to drift away from the pull of an adulthood he didn't want to face.

"Tyler, about last night..." Aunt Marlie started, her voice firm but weary.

He didn't look up from his cereal but immediately answered, "Yeah, I know. I screwed up."

"It's more than that," Aunt Marlie insisted, facing us and leaning against the kitchen counter. "You've been dodging chores ever since your dad left. For the work trip. That ends now." Her sentences were halting in a way that made me curious, and I filed it away to talk to her about later.

Tyler finally met her gaze, a mix of guilt and defiance in his eyes. "So, what's my sentence?"

"The yard's a mess. It needs mowing, and that garden's a weed fest," she said, pointing toward the unkempt garden outside with an oven-mitt-covered hand. "Your dad would be embarrassed to see it like this. I know I am."

He let out a long breath, pushing aside his bowl of cereal, which was now mostly mush. "Fine, I'll handle it. Anything else?"

"The garage," she said, her tone hardening a bit. "You need to clean up that disaster. It's a mess, and it's on you to fix it."

Tyler slumped his shoulders, but he nodded in agreement. "I'll clean it, " he said.

My aunt wasn't done. "And you're going to start helping around here more. Vacuuming, dusting, cooking — you're pitching in. No more dicking around."

He hesitated momentarily, then nodded and stood up, scraping the chair back with his foot and heading for the door.

Aunt Marlie watched Tyler for a moment, her expression a mix of frustration and concern like she felt like she hadn't made her point yet. I wondered how many times they had similar conversations in the years it had been since I last saw them.

"And one more thing," she added as Tyler stood to leave. "You're grounded. No going out with friends until all this is sorted out."

Tyler stopped in his tracks, turning to face her. "Grounded? Are you serious?" His face was bemused and furious. Aunt Marlie always had this sort of whimsical hippie way about her. For her to come down on him like this was unprecedented, at least as far as I could remember.

"You can't ground me. I'm eighteen." His whine didn’t have the effect he had been going for.

"Yes, I can. Because you are eighteen and still living in my house rent-free, still in high school, and I am definitely still your mom," she replied firmly.

He sighed heavily, a scowl crossing his face, but he didn't argue, either because he agreed or he was too angry to think of what to say. He grabbed his jacket off his chair and headed out the back door to start on the lawn.

Aunt Marlie suddenly jolted and ran after him, and I almost spilled my coffee, turning to watch her, wondering what would happen next.

"Be careful with the Tiny Town! Just raking, don't bring the mower near it!" My aunt sounded frantic, and it took me a second to figure out what she was talking about. When I did, I smiled behind my hand, relieved and nostalgic.

When we were kids, a near-perfect ring of tiny, white-capped mushrooms sprang up overnight one humid summer night. Encircling an old stump in the backyard covered in moss and wildflowers, it looked absolutely enchanting, like something out of a storybook, and my aunt was utterly convinced it was a fairy circle.

She had built these tiny, intricate houses and buildings from found objects on the spot, creating a miniature village at the base of the stump. It was her way of making the circle welcoming for the fairies, especially during the colder months, and the photographs and paintings she did of it were some of her most popular sales.

"Do you hear me, Tyler?" She yelled into the yard.

"Yes!" He shouted back venomously, his voice sounding far away. "I'm not even starting back there. I'm in the garage. Relax, Mom."

As the door swung shut with a bang, Aunt Marlie let out a weary sigh, sitting heavily next to me on the bench and letting her head rest against my shoulder.

"Want some help?" I offered, putting my arm around her and giving her a squeeze.

"All of the help please." She answered. She glanced out the window at Tyler, who was furiously gathering supplies from the shed and bringing them to the garage and shot me a weary look.

"How about with getting ready for Thanksgiving?" I asked.

"No, it's okay. You've had a long night, too. I'm so, so sorry, Alex. We'll pay to have it fixed." I had almost forgotten my car, and my stomach somersaulted when I thought about the work that would need to go into fixing it.

"I know, it's okay." I tried to smile reassuringly, and she returned it weakly.

She nodded, picking at a divot on the table. "Thank you. I just wish Tyler would... understand things better." Her usually serene facade seemed cracked more deeply than my ruined bumper would entail.

"What's he not getting, aside from, you know, how to be an adult?" I asked half-jokingly. Aunt Marlie was quiet for a long minute and avoided the question entirely. She sat up straight and played with her apron ties.

"He's a good kid, deep down," she said, more to herself than to me. "Just lost his way a bit." I nodded in agreement, although privately, I thought: A bit? He literally stole a car last night. It made me wonder how else he had gotten "lost" in the time that we drifted apart.

"My Goddess, the car, on top of the breakup. I'm sorry again. I know you're still healing from that, but that Casey wasn't right for you at all. Not the right alignment." It was anyone's guess whether she was talking about planets, stars, numbers, or some other kind of mystical-fated romanticism, as she loved it all. Still, I found it comforting that she was so confident that I had made the right decision. My parents had really liked Casey, which is part of the reason I had turned them down when they invited me to spend the holidays with them in the Keys.

We both sat there in silence, sipping our coffee and listening to Tyler trudge back and forth around the house, hissing curses and slamming doors.

When Aunt Marlie finished her coffee, she sighed, setting down her empty cup. "Well, I better get started on the Thanksgiving prep. And I change my mind. If you're feeling better, I wouldn't say no to an extra set of hands. I can never believe how hard it is to get everything together, even days in advance. I haven't even thought about the pies yet, and I wanted to get some drawing in today, too."

I smiled. My headache had eased, and I had the beginnings of a relaxing buzz from the edible. "Sure, I'll help. It'll be nice to keep busy."

As we worked into the afternoon, the tension and silence from earlier in the day dissipated, replaced by the comforting routine of meal prep and the warm buzz of being stoned. The rhythmic sound of the knife hitting the cutting board was soothing, and the kitchen filled with the warm, comforting scent of butter and spices.

Aunt Marlie shared little tips and tricks as we went along, and I found myself getting absorbed in the process, the earlier stress melting away. She was also an artist in the kitchen, knowing exactly what pieces went where until she reached for something in the fridge and came up empty. She hit her forehead with her palm, leaving a smear of white flour.

"I think I'll have to run to the store," she finally said, setting down her kitchen towel. "Blech. It's going to be a nightmare. But the veggie turkey will taste like a brick without rosemary, and mine didn't make it through that frost last week. It won't take long." She untied her apron and walked quickly to the door, grabbing her coat and a scarf. We were deep in rural Pennsylvania, and the nearest grocery store was almost a half hour away.

"Are you sure? I can go," I offered, but she was already halfway out the door. Then I realized I couldn't. Aunt Marlie saw my face and made a sympathetic wince, both of us remembering my car.

"No, you stay and keep things going here. I'll be quick," she insisted.

"Okay, but call me if you get tackled in the spice aisle, and I'll get an Uber. It's going to be crazy," I joked as she headed towards the door.

"I will. Love you!" Aunt Marlie called to me over her shoulder, blowing me a chain of air kisses as the door shut.

With Aunt Marlie gone, the house felt quieter, almost too big. I went back to chopping vegetables, but my attention kept drifting. My mind wandered to Casey and our last argument, and my stomach plummeted. I felt suddenly intensely lonely, and I had the munchies, too.

I debated for a minute, then decided I was more sad and in need of company than angry, so I picked up my phone and texted my cousin: *Come in for a sandwich?*

I thought that was a nice enough peace offering, but I waited ten minutes, and my cousin didn't respond. I started making lunch regardless but caught sight of him through the kitchen window, walking in the backyard, dragging the old lawn mower. I tapped the window with the knife handle, loud enough that he looked up at me- and then looked away, putting on his headphones. I texted him again, just sending a few question marks to my earlier message. Through the window, I saw him look at his phone and put it back in his pocket, deliberately leaving me on read.

A flash of irritation hit me, and I pounded at the window harder. He kept his head forward, avoiding looking at me.

*What a passive-aggressive little shit,* I thought.

I felt a sudden, urgent burst of white-hot anger. I banged on the window hard, feeling the glass shake under my hand. I knew it was stupid, and there was even a chance I might break it, but I was full of pent-up frustration that needed an outlet.

My movement caught his attention, and Tyler turned his head to me, looking puzzled and annoyed by my frantic gesturing.

As I watched him turn the mower around for another pass, something in the leaf pile he was heading towards caught my eye. It was a subtle movement, but enough to make me stop banging and try to point it out to him. He mistook the gesture for something more rude and flipped me off.

In just a few seconds, he stumbled sharply, almost falling in front of the lawn mower. My heart stopped as I watched him fumble and finally regain his balance just before falling in front of the blades. There was a chittering wet sound of something hitting the metal.

A sound that will always be permanently burned into my memory.

Tyler stopped and stared at the ground, jaw hanging open.

I bolted through the door, running to him.

"Are you okay?" I gasped, out of breath from the sprint. Tyler didn't look at me, so I followed his eyes instead.

I'm not exactly sure what happened next. I was stoned and distracted.

I am sure I saw this: Tyler had inadvertently driven the mower right through Aunt Marlie's beloved fairy circle, and half of the tiny village had been completely destroyed.

Most of the carefully built houses, which I knew had taken hundreds, if not thousands, of hours for her to make, were now just piles of scattered bark, broken twigs, and crumpled leaves. The furniture pieces she had placed inside the houses - miniature chairs made from bent twigs, windows of beach glass, tiny tables crafted from bottle caps and acorns, and small beds from layered dried petals - were scattered, damaged, and in some cases totally obliterated.

But there was something else, too, lying next to the mess.

Something living that looked like it had been mangled. The poor thing I had seen rustling in the leaves.

When Tyler and I talked about it later, I said I thought it was a squirrel or a young possum. It was about the right size.

But Tyler said he saw something else.

Something that had been twisted and mangled and gasped in pain, very much a living thing at the end of its life, but gushing blood that was a deep, blackened green.

Something delicate that looked like it was made out of bark and twigs like Aunt Marlie's houses. Something that had colorful gossamer wings that had been reduced to crumpled tissue paper.

Something that had taken one last gurgling gasp and crumbled into the dirt like the decaying leaves around it.

My attention, however, was entirely on Tyler. I still wasn't sure he hadn't caught himself in the mower and was checking for any visible injuries.

I had glanced down briefly and saw something squeaking horribly before I averted my eyes. But by the time I looked again, there was nothing there, and I assumed whatever it had been had enough adrenaline to escape into the bushes.

"Tyler, look at me. Are you okay?" I asked him, taking his shoulders and looking him in the eye.

"Did you see that, Alex? Did you-" He spun around and then dropped to his knees, patting the ground.

"Fuck, what did I do?" He asked, looking up at me and then back at the ruined town, grasping at the shattered pieces. He repeated the phrase over and over again until I rested a hand on his back and guided him back inside. His lips were bloodless, and his eyes were wide and wild. He just kept looking at his hands, like he had taken an ax and cut it down on purpose and was looking for the evidence in his palms.

I didn't know how to help him, aside from reassuring him everything would be okay and that I would talk to Aunt Marlie for him. I told him to just wait in his room until she got home, and I would explain it to her. I did just that, swallowing the wave of pity I had when she walked into the kitchen, cheeks pink from the cold and smiling.

When I told her about it, she just...fell apart.

She didn't say a word, kept her raincoat on, and immediately walked through the backyard to assess the damage, slowly, like she was going to a funeral she didn't want to attend. I couldn't watch her after she got to the ruined art fixture she had worked so hard on, and I averted my eyes- but something caught my attention in the peripheral.

The tiny stone bowl, which I could have sworn was filled with milk just that morning, was overflowing with something thick and red. It bubbled over the edges like a fountain. Maybe it was one of Uncle TJ's projects or a Halloween decoration that hadn't been put away yet.

I must not have noticed it, and the bowl I had seen was put away.

I opened the window, curious, putting a finger in the stream. It was warm in a way that surprised and disgusted me. I took a napkin from the table and wiped it off, the tacky feeling of it clinging to my skin.

"Some of it was salvageable." Aunt Marlie's voice surprised me, and I looked up. She had walked back towards me, her hands full of twigs and small pieces of cloth.

"That's great!" I exclaimed, injecting extra enthusiasm into my answer. But she didn't smile. Her wan face reminded me so much of Tyler's.

She carefully placed the clump of what remained of her work on the ground next to a stone garden gnome that sneered like a pirate, complete with missing teeth.

"Uncle TJ and I have been having some problems. He stayed an extra week on that work trip, even with the holiday," Aunt Marlie said offhandedly, dusting her hand on her jeans.

I winced. I had wondered about my uncle's absence, which was not normal this time of year. Aunt Marlie had said it was a commission he couldn't miss out on, but I couldn't help but wonder what kind of sculpture was so important that he would need to miss Thanksgiving.

"I don't think Tyler is taking it well." She continued, more out loud to herself than to me.

"Oh, Aunt Marlie, it was an accident. No way he did it on purpose." I quickly reassured her. She gave me an exasperated look.

"I told him to use the rake, Alex. He shouldn't have been anywhere near there with the mower." I nodded slowly. It was a fair point.

"I distracted him," I offered, partially to try to assuage my own guilty feelings. She rolled her eyes, obviously unwilling to budge on excusing her son's behavior.

We both looked at the horizon to the treeline. A few desiccated apples still littered the ground, and the wind carried over their sweet, spoiled smell.

"It'll be okay. You just gotta wait for that right alignment," I said, which made her smile thinly.

"True." She said, turning to come back inside.

The rest of the night was quiet. Tyler never came back out of his room, and my aunt and I finished the cooking prep, ate a lackluster dinner of canned soup as we were too exhausted to do anything else, and went to bed early. I fell asleep abruptly, my body both physically and emotionally exhausted.

My sleep was dreamless, and I probably would have slept straight through the night- but I woke up to Tyler again.

This time, there was no knock on my door.

He loomed over my bed, absolutely silent, his face pale and slack.

"Tyler?" For a second, I thought it was a dream. I sat up, almost knocking into him.

"They're screaming," Tyler said matter-of-factly, looking vacantly at a place over my shoulder.

"What? Who is screaming?" I pulled the covers further up my chest, feeling oddly defensive. Tyler didn't answer.

"Tyler?" I asked again after a long silence.

"We have to. They won't let me sleep." He muttered, still not looking at me.

I took a shaky breath and realized he must be sleepwalking. For what felt like the millionth time in my life, I felt like I had no idea how to help my cousin.

I pulled out my phone and did a search for sleepwalking. Anxiety and exhaustion made it hard to read through the articles. I thought Tyler might wake up, his breath heaving with some unknown tension that made him wheeze, but he was statue-still.

I took his hand and tried to "gently guide him back to bed" like the wiki recommended. He let me pull him down the hallway, mumbling, before stopping dead in his tracks outside of his bedroom.

"The singing is so sad." Tears welled in his eyes, and he let out a sob.

"I didn't mean to, Alex. I'm so sorry." His eyes were still fixed somewhere behind me. Something creaked against the wall, and I looked over my shoulder, my heart slamming against my ribs. It was probably the house settling against the cold weather, but the darkness and his odd behavior made everything so much easier.

"I know Tyler. It's okay." I tried to keep my voice calm. His eyes had gone unfocused and drifted to the spot behind me again. I held one hand on his arm and opened the door to his room. It was a typical teenager's mess, but it felt more chaotic than usual in the low light. Old soda cans, a couple of comic books and fantasy novels, and what looked like a week's worth of schoolwork were all jumbled together.

His laptop was open, its screensaver casting a faint, eerie glow in the semi-darkness. His bed was a tangle of sheets and a crumpled comforter, like he'd been tossing around in it. I helped him sit in it, trying to control his fall the best I could as he outweighed me by at least fifty pounds. He curled up in an almost fetal position, facing the wall.

"They say they'll never let me sleep again." He whispered. I stared at the back of his head for a minute before leaning over to check his face. His eyes were still wide open and looking blankly at the wall, but he seemed calm enough.

I deliberated on what to do next. I considered getting my aunt, but after the incredible stress of the last 24 hours coupled with my exhaustion, I eventually decided to just go back to my room and let him sleep off whatever was happening with him.

I wish I hadn't left him.

When I went back to bed, this time, I dreamed I was the one driving my car, and Tyler stood in the middle of the field, crying and begging me to stop. There was a high-pitched keening as if tinnitus could somehow be made of voices.

I tasted the metallic tang of blood and spoiled apples.

It was a relief to wake up.

For a few minutes, anyway.
