The day I disappeared, I wandered through Los Angeles in the haze of my own thoughts. It was a bleak, cloudy morning, the kind where the sun was merely a smudge on the horizon, the city muffled beneath a shroud of mist. My footsteps echoed on the pavement, a hollow rhythm that seemed to mock me. I found solace in the hum of the city, the discordant symphony of car horns, distant voices, and the occasional bark of a stray dog.

>*“I have arrived in Laland… and there is a monstrosity of a building next to the place I’m staying. When I say monstrosity mind you, I’m saying as in gaudy. But then again it was built in 1928 hence the art deco theme, so yes it IS classy, but then since it’s LA it went on crack. Fairly certain this is where Baz Luhrmann needs to film the Great Gatsby.”*

I arrived at the Cecil Hotel, its facade crumbling, a relic of another time. The walls seemed to hold secrets, whispers of lives long gone, the air heavy with a history I couldn’t see but could feel. I had chosen this place because it was cheap, but as I stood in the lobby, surrounded by faded grandeur, I realized there was something more to it, something that resonated deep within me.

I had always been drawn to places with stories, with layers of history and mystery. They felt like reflections of my own mind—complex and impossible to fully understand. The hotel was no different. It felt alive, as if it were watching me, waiting for something.

>*“I wish I could believe it gets better, but I can’t. I’m tired of existing. Existing is not enough. I want to live. I need to find something real, something that will make me feel alive. But what does that even mean? Every day, I feel myself drifting further away from the world, from people, from reality. Maybe I’m not meant to be here at all.”*

I took the elevator—a metal box that smelled of disinfectant and stale cigarettes—to the fifth floor, the one where my room was. The doors slid open, revealing a dimly lit corridor. I stepped out, but something held me back. The hallway stretched before me, empty, and yet filled with something I couldn’t see, something I couldn’t name. I felt a strange pull, an urge to explore, to stay here, to find… what?

The elevator doors stayed open behind me, a gaping mouth waiting to swallow me whole. I turned back to look at it, my mind flickering with thoughts that didn’t fully form, fragments of ideas I couldn’t grasp. The hallway was too quiet, the silence pressing in on me, making my heart pound louder in my chest.

>*“Depression sucks. The night is a refuge, a place where the broken pieces of me can fit together, just for a while. In the darkness, I can hide from the world, from myself. But the darkness is also where the monsters live, where the thoughts I try to bury rise up and consume me. I don’t know which is worse—facing the world, or facing what’s inside my own mind.”*

I pressed the elevator button again, watching as the doors slid shut, then opened once more. The numbers on the panel glowed faintly, a soft, cold light that felt distant and uninviting. I stepped inside, feeling the cool metal walls close around me. I pressed the buttons randomly, my fingers trembling, the familiar surge of anxiety tightening my chest. I wasn’t sure what I was trying to accomplish, but I kept pressing, as if hoping for a response, a sign, something.

The elevator shuddered, then began to move, but the doors didn’t close. They stayed open, revealing the same empty hallway, the same silent stretch of carpet. My reflection stared back at me from the mirrored surface of the doors, distorted, warped. I couldn’t recognize myself. I couldn’t see the girl I thought I was.

>*“I spent about two days in bed hating myself. I’m drifting through this city, through life, like a ghost. I can see the world, but I can’t touch it, can’t connect with it. Everything feels so far away, like I’m watching it all through a screen. Maybe that’s what I am—a ghost, a shadow, something that exists between the cracks of reality. Sometimes I think I’m not real at all.”*

I stepped out again, the cold air of the hallway brushing against my skin. I was trembling, a deep, visceral fear coursing through me, something primal and uncontrollable. My thoughts were spinning, a chaotic whirl that I couldn’t escape from. I began to pace, the rhythm of my footsteps the only sound in the oppressive silence. The elevator doors remained open, a silent invitation, a portal to… where?

The buttons on the elevator blinked at me, an erratic pattern that made no sense. I pressed them again, desperate for some kind of reaction, some kind of change. But nothing happened. The walls of the elevator seemed to close in on me, the air thickening, suffocating. I felt like I was being watched, like something unseen was just out of sight, just beyond the edges of my perception.

>*“I have this fear of being forgotten. It’s irrational, I know, but the thought of disappearing, of no one remembering who I am, terrifies me. What if I fade away, like I never existed at all? It’s hard to fight against that fear when every day feels like I’m one step closer to vanishing.*

>*Reality is fragile. It feels like it could break at any moment, like the seams are already coming apart. There are things in this world we can’t see, things that exist in the spaces between reality. I feel like I’m slipping into those spaces, like I’m becoming one of those things that people can’t see, can’t understand.”*

I ducked back into the elevator, pressing myself into the corner, trying to make myself small, invisible. But there was no escape from the thoughts that clawed at my mind, no escape from the fear that was tightening its grip on my chest. I pressed the buttons again, every one, over and over, as if the mechanical response could somehow anchor me, pull me back to the world I knew. But nothing happened. The doors stayed open, the hallway stretching out before me like a tunnel, leading to some unknown darkness.

I stepped out one last time, feeling the carpet beneath my feet, the air heavy with the scent of old dust and something else, something I couldn’t name. I stared down the hallway, my vision blurring, the world tilting. My heart pounded in my chest, a frantic rhythm that matched the chaos in my mind.

>*“I’m afraid of falling apart, of losing myself completely. There’s a part of me that’s always been scared, always been unsure. And now, I can feel it taking over, like I’m being consumed by my own fears. I don’t know how to fight it anymore.*

>*I am not the girl you see in the mirror. I am not the girl you think I am. I am something else, something lost, something that exists only in the spaces between. I don’t know where I belong, but it’s not here. It’s not anywhere.”*

I began to climb the stairs to the rooftop. The metal steps felt cold beneath my feet, each step echoing with a hollow resonance that seemed to reverberate through my very bones. I moved carefully, trying to push away the fear that clung to me like a shadow. The climb was slow, deliberate. I could feel every breath, every heartbeat, a steady reminder of my own existence.

When I reached the rooftop, the door creaked open, revealing the stark, open expanse of the roof. I stepped out, the wind cutting across my face, the city sprawling below me. My eyes were drawn to the water tanks in the distance. They were large, imposing, their presence both mundane and ominous. They stood there, silent watchmen of a place that felt so foreign and yet so intimately connected to the chaos within me.

I approached the tanks, each step deliberate, each breath a struggle against the suffocating silence. The tanks were old, their metal surfaces scratched and worn. They seemed almost alive, as if they held the weight of countless untold stories within them. I reached out a hand, touching the cold, weathered metal. The sensation was jarring, grounding.

I looked out over the edge of the rooftop, the city lights twinkling in the distance, the vast expanse of the sky stretching out above me. The world felt both infinitely large and unbearably small. The wind whipped around me, a reminder of how alone I was, how distant everything seemed.

>*“I just wish...someone around me could understand what it really means to be depressed.”*

The night wrapped around me, heavy and silent. I stood there, facing the water tanks, feeling the weight of my own thoughts pressing down on me. The silence was profound, an empty void that seemed to stretch endlessly. I could feel my own breath, my own heartbeat, a reminder of my existence in this vast, lonely world.

And then I stopped. I took one last look at the rooftop, the water tanks standing silent and watchful. I turned to leave, my footsteps echoing in the emptiness, the only sound in the stillness of the night. The city below continued its restless hum, oblivious to the girl who stood alone on the rooftop, searching for something she could never quite find.

In that final moment, the darkness around me felt both a sanctuary and a prison. The world below continued to spin, the lights twinkling like distant stars, and I was left standing on the edge, a fleeting shadow in a vast and indifferent world.

The last I saw was the darkened rooftop stretching out behind me, the water tanks looming like silent witnesses to my departure. And then, as I walked away, the silence closed in.

>*“I talked to anyone and everyone hoping for a person I can depend on. But no one wants to have someone else’s problems thrust upon them and be expected to hold them up. I get why; we’re selfish people, we have our own issues to deal with how could you possibly take on someone else’s. When you’ve left high school and you’re busy trying to become ‘accomplished’ what time do you have except for shallow infrequent bursts of conversation with an acquaintance.”*

The day I disappeared, I wandered through Los Angeles in the haze of my own thoughts. Sometimes we disappear like that, right in front of everybody, and we are not found until something tastes rotten. So many stories dissolve, leaving only a watered-down truth for future eyes and ears. I am not the girl on the elevator. I am more than the sum of my fears, more than the reflection in the metal doors. But I am also nothing—lost in a world that doesn’t understand me, that never will.

Yet I have hope that it is never too late to remember to tell a story. That this life is as brief and tainted as a cigarette drag, but also as dynamic and rejuvenating as the air that disperses the smoke. It isn’t rocket science. It isn’t that difficult. Get out of bed. Eat. See people. Talk to people. Exercise. Write. Read books.

And if someone around you suffers, just be around and make sure they eat and go outside. Remind them every day that it will get better. Tell them every day you love them and losing them would be unbearable. There is nothing else you can do.
