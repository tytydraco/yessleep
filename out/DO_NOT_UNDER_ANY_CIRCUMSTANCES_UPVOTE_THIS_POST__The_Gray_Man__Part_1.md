Alright, I know that’s a weird disclaimer, but there’s a very good reason.  You’re probably asking “if you don’t want any upvotes, why are you even posting this?”  And it’s a valid question.

Allow me to explain.  It will take several posts to get through this, and I think I know how to prevent this from happening to you.  For the love of god, and for my sake, DO NOT UPVOTE!

It started… maybe three months ago?  When I first noticed him, he was just a speck near the horizon.  Could have been anything, until I realized that gray speck kept reappearing nearly wherever I went.  And eventually it got close enough that I could make it out as a person.

Now this was a bit strange, mainly because of the consistency.  No matter where I went, the figure was somewhere, in the distance.  And it was moving closer.  Definitely the same figure every time, I was certain.

So what did I do?  I drove to the Walmart, and I bought binoculars, of course.  I got a slightly better view of him, but still wasn’t able to discern much, other than that he seemed to be wearing gray clothing.  But what I was able to verify was, to put it mildly, concerning:

It was *always* the same figure.

It might be in a field, off the side of a highway.  It might be way off in one of the neighborhoods beyond my seventh story apartment.  It might be anywhere.  But it was always there.  Always.  There.  Somewhere.

So I did what any sensible person would do.  *Telescope time*.  A bit expensive, but I nabbed a decent one online, and intended to set it up in my apartment window so I could track this… person.  So I could see their face.  So I could figure out what the hell this all was.

It arrived a few days later, and by then I’d noticed a disconcerting trend: that gray man was still getting closer.  Slowly, day by day, I would see what looked like a step taken, followed by long periods of stillness.  It was admittedly hard to discern, but I was near certain, and with my new and trusty best friend I’d splurged on, I’d finally get to see this stranger up close and personal.

So I set it up - it was a nice telescope, and I’d hoped so, as it had put me back a thousand bucks.  And when I finally had it ready, I scouted.

I knew he had to be out there somewhere.  Always was.

“Mike, grab milk if you go out later.”  I heard her pouring what was definitely expired curds down the drain.  “And butter, if you could.”

I looked through my fancy new scope.  “Alright.  I might go get gas in a bit, so I can knock it out.  Are you still going to Sarah’s after work?”

“Yeah, I should be back by nine.”

“No problem, have a nice day, love.  Don’t work too hard.”

Meghan proffered a quick kiss on the cheek.  I gave her a little smile.  She tucked a few tufts of brown hair behind an ear and gave me one more kiss for good measure.  “Love you.  Ham sandwich in the fridge.  Call if anything comes up.”

“Thanks darling.  You too.  See you later.”  I returned to watching.

*Where are you, motherfucker?*

I spotted him frequently.  He’d gotten way too close for comfort.  With the telescope, I could see him clearly on most days, and he - dare I call it a person at all - was far more disturbing than I’d anticipated.  Far, far more disturbing.

It wasn’t gray clothes.  It was gray *skin*.  It was… humanoid, I guess.  Two arms, two legs.  Way too thin.  Way, way too thin.  Its head, oversized, disproportionate.  It had two eyesockets, but they might as well have been two pits to infinity, dark and empty and almost cartoonishly large.  Cartoonish.  *Hah*.

I really, really, really wish this were funny.  *Just some cartoon shit.*  But they were deeply creepy.

I spotted him.  *There you are*.  I adjusted the scope.

He… *it*… was looking at me.  Almost always was.  Sometimes the Gray Man would look somewhere else, off into the distance, seemingly random, inexplicable, and just stand there for hours.  But usually, he was looking at me.  And his grin - imagine, if you will, if the Cheshire Cat and the Mouth of Sauron had a child together.  I could tell that absurdly wide smile had far too many teeth in it.  And most upsettingly, the grin was usually absent until I’d spot him.  Then he’d look right at me and smile.

Which meant he *knew* when I was watching him.

And as it was before, so it was today.  He looked right up at me.  And he smiled.

*You fucking piece of shit.*

At this point, he was maybe three blocks away, standing in someone’s backyard.  *Can nobody else see him?*  Yet that couldn’t be true, the videos I'd posted online were proof of that.  The bastard could at the very least be caught on camera.  I’d found my courage and tried approaching him before, but he’d just walk backwards in the most unnatural manner, or disappear if I was coming too fast; I figured that one out when I tried to run him over, having caught him in the middle of the road.

But I had a different plan for *this* day, while Meghan was busy.  I headed downstairs and got into my car.  I turned the ignition.



I drove to the gun store.



\-



“What’s the range again?”

“About 900 yards,” he replied.  “Maybe a thousand, if you’re a crack shot.”

“Alright.”  I checked it over again.  “Alright.”

“If you’re hunting, it’s a great choice.”

“Self defense,” I replied.

“Ah, so for home defense you definitely want a handgun, or possibly a shotgun.  That thing won’t do you much good, if I’m being honest with ya.  I can show you some good options-”

“No, this will do just fine.  I’ll need a scope as well.”

He eyed me curiously.  “Self defense?”

“Yes.”

“Customer’s always right.  Hope you know what you’re doing…”

When I left, purchase in hand, I didn’t head home.  I knew full well this thing followed me wherever I went, so I went to the most remote location I could, outside the city, in the desert.  I set up on a high area, loaded my newest friend, and gave it a try.  My shot rang, and I realized I should have bought ear protection.  *Whatever*.  Bigger fish to fry.

I practiced with the scope.  Then I looked around; I ought to be able to spot him with bare eyes in this open place.  And sure enough, there he was, just a few hills over.  Watching.



*Time to see if you bleed.*



But first, I pulled out my phone and streamed a video to my Facebook of it, just to make sure I had evidence that I wasn’t insane… and to test a theory.  I’d made videos of it before.  I’d even posted a few of them.  And I’d noticed a pattern: immediately after those posts, it started taking steps much more frequently.  I’d run a few trials, and I’d promptly taken the videos down just to be safe.

Today would be the final experiment.

I posted the video.  And I paid several hundred dollars to promote it.

Then I scrounged out a ham sandwich from my pack, sat down, and waited.

The steps came more frequently.  I’d pull out my binoculars from time to time and observe.  Then I’d check my phone.  The video was gaining traction, for sure.  Not a ton, but there was definitely, without a doubt, some inexplicable connection between the movements of the creature and people seeing the video.

But what connection?  *Maybe views?*

I started tracking the viewcounts and seeing if the steps the Gray Man took synced up.  *No cigar.*

*So what else?*

Someone liked my video.  And then I saw it.  Another step.

Another like.  Another step.  Another like.  Another step.

*What the hell?*

Another like.  Another step.

The post was beginning to blow up, and the Gray Man was full on walking my way.  Given it all, I wasn’t sure if that walk might become a sprint.  *Test complete, time to shut down the experiment*.  So I deleted the post.  An expensive trial, possibly dangerous, but worth it.

The Gray Man stilled within seconds.  That was all the confirmation I needed.

I loaded the .308 into the rifle.  I pulled back the bolt.  I aimed down the scope, made some adjustments, and then got the fucker right in my crosshairs.  And I paused.  We stared at each other for a drawn out moment.  I could feel the tickle of the breeze, the heat of the midday sun on my skin.  I could hear the eerie silence of the Arizona desert.  I could smell my own uncertainty.

*You’re not smiling this time.*  It just stared blankly with those pits for eyes.

That was somehow more terrifying than anything I’d seen yet.  What did it mean?

*Why aren’t you smiling?*

Whatever.



I pulled the trigger.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Uhh, I was out hiking today and I found a body.”

“You found a body, sir?”

“Yes ma’am.”

“Are you still there?”

“No ma’am, but I can give the exact coordinates.”

“Please give me your full name and address first.”

\[REDACTED\]

“Okay, and the location?”

\[REDACTED\]

“Thank you sir.  Are you certain the person was dead, or might they have been injured?  We have an ambulance available about twenty minutes from there.”

“I… I don’t know.  I think they were dead.  But you have to understand, this wasn’t a human body.”

“I’m sorry, it wasn’t a person?  So an animal then?”

“I don’t know.  I have no idea what it was.  Not an animal.”

“Okay sir, we’re going to dispatch a car and ambulance to go take a look.  The officers will follow up with you directly if needed.”

“Alright.  Thank you.”

“Have a nice day, sir.”

*Click*.

Hours passed.  I spent them staring from that telescope in my apartment, waiting to see if it would reappear.  So far, so good - it was a clean shot, shattering its face almost beyond recognition.  I actually had approached it, and it hadn’t disappeared!  Whatever that thing was, it was nightmarish seeing it up close.  I shuddered and tried not to think about it, but I couldn’t purge it.

Half of its head blown off, but it had found that horrible smile again.  Somehow.

My phone rang - unknown number.  I answered.



Heavy breathing.



“Hello?” I asked.



“Hellooooooooooooooooooooooo-”  It croaked, and dragged, intense, nauseating.  My head ached.



I hung up immediately.  *The hell was that?*

The phone rang again.  My hand trembled over it.

*The police!*  I answered.

“Is this Mr. \[REDACTED\]?”

“Speaking.”

“I understand you reported some kind of dead body that you thought might be problematic?”

“I did.  It looked kind of like a human, so I wanted to have someone else take a look.”

“My partner and I went to the spot and we didn’t find anything there.  Are you absolutely certain you had the right place?”  He sounded bored, and maybe a little irritated.

“Yes… the coordinates were correct.  I triple checked.  There was… nothing?”

“Didn’t find a thing.  I think we’re going to have to shelve this for now, but if you remember anything else you can call me on this line, or call the department directly and someone will take it for you.”

*Well, shit.*

“Alright.  Thanks.  Sorry for wasting your time.”

As soon as he hung up, I went straight to that telescope.

*Please be gone.  Please be gone.*



\-



“Hey hon, did you manage to go to the store?”  The front door closed with a slam.

*Damn it all*.

“Sorry Meg,” I shouted back, one eye still glued to that telescope.  “I guess I forgot.  I’ll go in a few.”

“It’s fine,” she replied from the kitchen.  I heard the fridge open.  “I knew you would so I took care of it.”

It was dark now, the late summer sun having set just half an hour ago.  *Goddamnit*.  Every shadow I spotted through that telescope was beginning to look gray to me, and I didn’t-

“Um… hon?  Is that a rifle?”  She stood in the doorframe of the bedroom, arms crossed.

I looked over at the gun propped up next to me.

“What… what are you doing?” she asked.

“Stargazing.”

I dared a chancy glance at her.  I could read her worry.

“Ok, look,” I started.  “I don’t want to lie to you about anything.  You know that.  So I’m going to tell you what’s actually going on.  But it’s going to sound really strange, and I just need you to trust me.”

“I mean, of course I trust you.  But… you forgot to buy milk and came home with a gun?”  She approached.  “And you were never into stargazing before.  What’s going on?”

I took a deep breath, still scanning the scene below the apartment.

“Alright.  So there’s this man stalking me.  That’s why I bought the gun.”

She was by my side in an instant.

“Someone is stalking you?  Did you call the police?”

“Yes.  They-”  I decided that omission wasn’t necessarily lying, and I’d spare her certain details for now.  “They looked into it.  Haven’t found anything yet.  I’m just keeping an eye out in case he reappears.”

“Honey, this is serious!  Do you know who he is?”

“No.”

"You don't have any idea?"  She squeezed my shoulder.  "Just some random-"

"I'm not having another breakdown, I swear to god.  I'm trying to figure this out."  I kept scanning.

“Jesus.  Mike.  Maybe we should just go stay with my mom for a bit while we figure it out, and you can fill me in on the drive.  It’s a long drive but I can still make the commute to the office.”

“No, you need to understand, it doesn’t matter where we go.  He always knows and follows.  I’m just trying to make sure he’s actually gone.”

There was a bleak silence, then Meghan spoke:

“I’m not comfortable with this, and I need answers.  You really don’t know who this person is?”

I sighed.  “I’ve nicknamed him the Gray Man, because he’s… gray.  There’s something very unnatural about him-”  Meghan took her hand off my shoulder and pulled out her phone.  “Look, I know it sounds crazy but-”

“I’m calling mom.  We’re going to stay with her until I understand what’s happening.”

I looked back out over the crippling darkness of the streets below.

“Alright.  That’s fair.”



\-



She drove.  I kept my binoculars out, just on the off chance I spotted something.

“Are you… are you ok?” Meghan asked.  “I just have to ask, after last time.”

“It’s not a psychotic episode.  I swear.  That was just work stress, this is different.”

“Okay, but you’re really worrying me.  I believe you, but you must have some idea who this person is and what they want from you?  Like, are we in danger?  Why did you feel the need to buy a gun?”  


Something gray lurked just off the road.  We passed it at nearly sixty.  


“*Shh*… hold on, I think I see something.  One moment.”  I rolled down the car window.  “Slow down and pull over.  I need to make sure.”

“Hon-”

“Do you trust me?”

She grimaced, then obediently pulled over.  “What do you see?”

We had passed it just a few seconds ago, I was near certain.  I could definitely spot it under the moonlight, if I could just…  So I leaned out the window and searched for any sign of a human figure.

*Nothing*.  *Must have imagined it.*

“False alarm, we can go.”

But she refused.  “We’re not going anywhere until we talk.”

*Not this again…*



And then, there it was.  Standing right across the street, barely visible in a field of alfalfa, practically within spitting distance.  Just a silhouette in the quiet black, but I knew it was *him*.



I knew.



It took a single step.



“Oh *shit*, he’s here.  Drive drive drive!”

“Honey!”

“Drive!  Now now now!”

Meghan complied, but said nothing after that, aside from casting me the occasional worried or possibly angry glare.  I knew I needed to explain more, but my mind was spinning circles:

*How did it take a step?*  I didn’t have any videos up.  *What even was it?  Why did it react to social media upboops?*  And that phone call I had gotten…

  


*Hellooooooooooooooooooooooo-*

  


Oh god, fuck this.  Fuck this so hard.  There had to be a pattern to it.  Something.  *Anything*.

I pulled out my phone.

“What are you doing?” Meghan asked.

“Calling the police again.”

Her expression changed, calmer now.  “Okay.  I mean.”  She let it go.  “Do it.”

So I did.



\-



“This is officer \[REDACTED\].”

“Yes.  Hi.  We spoke earlier, about a dead person or animal in \[REDACTED\].”

“Oh, you caught me right as I was leaving.  How can I help you?”

“I found it.  We’re on highway \[REDACTED\] at… one moment.  Looks like we just passed mile marker \[REDACTED\] and it was standing in a farm field.  It definitely didn’t die.  That's why it wasn't there when you all showed up.  Has to be.”

Silence.

“I know you must think I’m pranking you, but I’m not.”

“Sir, just calm down.”

“I’m not crazy.”

“I never said you were.  Look, I can send out a patrol car to take a look, but if we don’t find anything there’s nothing we can really do.  I can send you the numbers for some mental health hotlines-”

“I’m not crazy!  I swear to god there is something chasing me.  And.  And… and it’s somehow connected to social media.  I don’t know!”

“Chasing you?  Sir, I have to go.  If you want, I can transfer you to someone else, but I suggest you get some sleep.  You sound like you need it.  God knows I do.”

My breaths, heavy.  “I understand.  Sorry again for wasting your time.”

I hung up.

“Well that sounded like it went well?” Meghan snapped.  “I know exactly what’s happening.  Just like last time.  Mike, take your fucking meds!  You have to take them every day!”

“I have been!”

"On schedule!"

"I know!"

She stopped the car, then turned it around.  “Trust but verify.  Let’s go check right now.”  


And that was when she saw it.



\-



I had never heard her scream like that before.  Hands over her mouth, she gasped and choked as that… that creature… that *thing…* stood mere feet from us, blocking the road.  In the headlights, I could see it clear as day, half its head still blown out from that .308 round.  But that terrible smile remained.

  


“*Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo-*”

Oh, that groan.

  
"-oooooooooooo o o o o o o o. o. o.  o.   o.     o"

  


“Run it over!”  I shrieked.  “Meg, run it over!”

"What?"

"Meg, fucking run it over!"

And I could see in her eyes, in the creases of her face, in her unblinking expression, something I hadn't expected.  *Recognition*.  Like child walking into a room only to find themselves face to face with someone who had once abused them, or dog freezing at the sight of stick used to beat them.

She wasn't moving.  Meg wasn't moving.  She just stared at that monster, lip trembling, and it stared back.

  
"Hellooooooooooooooooo o o o  o. o.  o.   o.    o."

It grined so wide.  I could see two tiny little eyes, almost lost in those huge black sockets.



"Meghan, fucking *do something!*"



So she did.  Foot to the gas, pedal to the metal.  I was proud of her, proud as possible as I nearly pissed myself.  *It’s just going to disappear again.*

Yet this time, the car made contact, and a sickening thud was only made worse by the sound of something dragging beneath us.  Window still down, I leaned out to see if I could see evidence of it behind us, but there was nothing.

“Jesus Christ, it's grabbed onto the car!”  I tried to think.  "You can't be serious."  *What do we do?*  “Drive through a field!”  Maybe the uneven terrain would dislodge it.

Meghan was in tears.  “No, this isn't happening.  This isn't real.  That never actually happened.”

“I’ve been trying to tell you!”

"That was so long ago.  It wasn't real.  It was just night terrors."  She sobbed.  Trembled.  "Just dreams.  Just dreams.  Just dreams."

"Just-"

“What the fuck, Mike!  What the fuck!  How did he find me?  How did he find me!”

“Just drive!  Over there!”

She made a flawless turn into yet another plot of farmland, and I listened for the sound of it dragging beneath us.  *Thump.  Thump.*  “It’s still beneath us.  We have to get it off the car somehow.”

But how?

*The rifle!*  It was in the back.  So I crawled into the rear of the car, and pulled down one of the seats to access the trunk, and pulled out the case.  Opening it in a cramped space was a challenge.

“Mike, what are you doing?”

“Killing that thing.  Again.”

“Mike-”

“Do you trust me?”

She hesitated.  “Yes.  Yes yes, kill Tim!  He deserves to die.  Fucking kill him!”

“Keep driving.  Try to dislodge it.”

She’d seen it.  And she even had a name for it.  *Tim*.  Which meant it was real.  It was *real*.

As I loaded the gun, I wondered: *I have no videos up.  How is it moving?*  I clearly didn’t understand the rules.  *Maybe I’d forgotten one?*  Not impossible.  Worth double checking.  But for now, there was only one priority.  I pulled back the bolt.

I aimed through the floor of the car, at the spot where the sound was loudest.



“Love, cover your ears.”



\-



*I built a house made of flesh.*

I often heard these words in my darkest moments.

It hadn’t been easy, spending all that time working in the hospital.  They said that being a surgeon wasn’t for everyone.  Some people have the stomach, some don’t.  I’d thought I did.  I really did.

I was wrong.

But I was fortunate, at least.  Meghan always stood by my side, even after the accident, and my subsequent breakdown, and the realization that I had spent half my life and acquired so much debt pursuing a career I was unfit for.  I’d always been squeamish.  If my father hadn’t been a successful surgeon himself, always pushing me in that direction, I probably wouldn’t have.  And-

“Mike?”



I snapped out of my fugue.

“I think you got him.  I don’t hear him down there anymore.”  Her voice tremored.

I listened.  Nothing.

“Thank fucking god,” I said, slumping back for a moment, before crawling over and into the frontside passenger seat.  *Oh right, Facebook!*  Time to make sure I’d actually taken down all the shit I’d been using to test this insanity.  “Head back to the road but don’t stop driving, I need to check something.”

“Okay.  Just don’t leave me in the dark.  I know who that is, Mike.”

"And I want to hear all about it, believe me.  Just give me a sec."

"Okay," she whispered.

When I tried to log in, it failed.  Must have fat-thumbed the password.  *Goddamn!*  I tried again.  Same problem.  *Alright, account recovery.*  Sent a reset to my email.  Tried there.

“Fuck.  Fuck me.”  I tried again.  I tried every password I knew.  “Oh, god no.”

My email had been compromised.  I should have set up a backup email.  I still had two-factor auth enabled though, so how would someone compromise my account?  I checked my texts to see if I had gotten any codes sent by SMS, but saw none.  So I just stared at my screen for a while.

“Mike?”

“Yes?”

“What’s happening?  I’m really, really scared.”

“I…”  I tried to breathe, but struggled.  “I…”  If someone had gotten into my accounts and was reposting those videos, what would I do?  “I think…”

“Mike?”



“I think…”

“Please talk to me.”  She was in tears.  “Mike please.  Are you ok?  Are we ok?”



I didn’t know what to say.

So I spoke the truth:



“I think we’re fucked.”



And from the still open trunk behind me, I heard a dry, terrifying, otherworldly croak:

  


“*Helloooooooooooooooooooooo o o  o. o.   o.    o.*”
