I was only twelve when Adam passed away. 

I remember his death with crystal clarity. It’s my punishment for failing to save him. 

We were playing in the woods behind our house, venturing much further than our parents allowed, when it happened. The incident that changed both of our lives forever. 

“Hey Max, do you think gorillas could talk? You know, like if they really tried one hundred percent?” 

That question still sticks out in my mind. Such an odd thing to ask, but he was only ten years old, so I can’t fault him for it. 

“No,” I said, staring into the canopy overhead. “They would’ve done it already.” 

“Well what if… whoa, look at that!” Adam shouted, pointing his finger. I looked in its direction, and I could immediately make out what appeared to be a ravine. A deep cut entrenched into the earth. To a couple of preteen boys, that was like discovering a new continent. Adam raced over to it without a second’s hesitation. I followed suit, albeit a bit more hesitantly. 

Adam and I stood at the edge of the crevice, peering into the darkness within. It seemed deep. Probably thirty or forty feet, if I had to guess. Even in the evening light peppering the ground through the trees, we couldn’t see the bottom. 

“Max, go get a rock! I want to see how-” 

What happened next has haunted me for the last thirteen years of my life. 

I watched helplessly as the ground Adam was standing on crumbled away. His eyes grew wide and frantic, and all the color drained from his face in the split second that the realization hit him. He desperately flailed his arms, searching for something, *anything,* to grab onto, but ultimately, he found nothing. 

I was such a coward. I was in so much shock that I couldn’t move. I could only look on as Adam fell. If only I’d reacted quicker. If I had just snatched his hand in time, I could have saved him. Instead, I’m left with the constant reminder of my inaction. 

Time seemed to slow as Adam fell further and further into the depths. His scream barely registered in my ears before I heard it. That nauseating *thump* that still lives in my nightmares. 

Words can’t express how horrified I was. Adam had been standing beside me one moment, then the next, he was just… gone. Panic surged through me as the severity of the situation finally sank in. 

“A- Adam, are you okay?” I shouted, my voice shaky. I waited for a reply that I knew wasn’t going to come. Only silence emanated from the crevice… until it didn’t. 

I was about to run for help when I heard something. A faint, wet ripping noise like flesh being stripped from bone drifted up from the trench.

I stood, rooted to the spot. A dizzying cocktail of curiosity and dread settled into my stomach as I strained my ears to listen. 

And then, just as quickly as they had started, the noises stopped. My heart nearly leapt out of my chest when a new sound broke the silence. 

“M-a-x.” 

Adam’s voice called my name. I should have been relieved to hear that - but I wasn’t. It felt wrong. The inflection wasn’t quite right, and the letters were spoken too far apart. It sounded like something was mimicking Adam. Something that was just learning how to use his voice. 

I found myself unable to speak. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t look away. All I could do was keep my eyes glued to the darkness as a low scuffling met my ears. It didn't take long for me to realize what that noise was coming from. 

It sounded as if something was scaling the side of the trench. Something big. And after what felt like an eternity, I was proven right. 

A hand grasped the soil beside my feet, finding purchase on the edge of the dropoff. Another hand followed, and soon, a head poked up from the abyss. I watched as Adam hoisted himself up, brushed the dirt off of his pants, and grinned at me. 

I can’t explain how, in that moment, but I knew with one hundred percent certainty that the boy standing beside me was not my brother. He didn’t look any different. No noticeable changes aside from a bit of smeared blood at the side of his mouth. But his eyes. There was a manic darkness in them that wasn’t there before. Like something sinister lurked just below the surface. 

“What’s wrong, Max? Why didn’t you answer? I thought you left,” Adam said, gazing at me expectantly. 

“I… How?” 

“How what?” Adam asked, cocking his head to the side like a curious dog. 

The longer Adam stared at me, the more uneasy I became. It felt as if we were playing a game of cat and mouse, and he’d back me into a corner. 

“H-How did you climb back up? How are you standing here right now? I watched you fall.” My blood turned to ice as Adam smirked at me again. 

“It wasn’t that deep. I didn’t get hurt, see?” he said, spinning around. 

I didn’t have time to react before his body stiffened, and he turned in the direction of our house. “It’s getting dark. We should go home.” 

And with that, he took off into a dead sprint, leaving me standing there to process what I’d just seen. 

\*\*\*

Mom and Dad either didn’t notice, or they chalked it up to Adam getting older. But I knew. There were too many subtle imperfections to miss. The way he ate all of his peas when he used to hate them. How he didn’t put up a fuss when brushing his teeth. Wearing his glasses when he used to abhor the thought. 

But the worst, most significant change happened at night. 

I was terrified to sleep in the same room as Adam. I had begged our parents to let me spend the night on the couch or on the floor in their bedroom, but they wouldn’t allow it. Just the thought of being stuck alone with him nearly brought me to tears. 

I tried to avoid looking at him. To hide under the covers and pretend that everything was okay. I prayed that I would make it through the night without incident. But that didn’t happen. 

I was trembling under the covers, trying to calm my nerves, when I heard it. Something skittered across the floor. Then, I felt a presence looming over me. 

I can’t explain how I knew that he was there. I could just… *feel* him hovering, watching me. I held my breath, too scared to utter so much as a peep. And then he spoke. 

Warm, musty breath seeped through the covers and into my ear. It reeked of rot and decay. The smell of death. I wanted to gag, but I was frozen in fear as the words registered. 

“I know that you know. Keep your mouth shut, and I won’t have to hurt you.” Then, he scampered away, back to his side of the room. 

I didn’t get a wink of sleep that night. I was too on edge to let my guard down for even a second. Mom and Dad commented on how tired I looked, but I brushed them off. Adam was lurking in the background, eyeing me. Waiting for me to slip up. 

But I was careful. And for the next month, it turned my life into a living nightmare. 

I was constantly exhausted. My grades took a nosedive. My relationships suffered. People noticed. 

Mom and Dad took me to a doctor, but he recommended more sleep and melatonin. That did the trick for a while. Until the night that would haunt me for the rest of my life. 

I was fast asleep thanks to the medication, when something woke me up. I immediately knew what it was. I was paralyzed with dread the moment my eyes opened. 

Adam was standing directly over me. He wasn’t whispering, just… standing there, still as a statue. His expression was blank, and those eyes. They looked dead. Like the eyes of a fish. 

We stayed there for what felt like an eternity. Adam looming over me, while I lay in bed, too afraid to even blink. Then, without saying a word, Adam dropped to the floor. I could hear him crawling, shuffling on the hardwood, but I couldn’t see him. That terrified me more than anything. Not knowing where he was. 

I wouldn’t have to worry about that for long, because a moment later, his face popped up at the foot of my bed. 

Those cold, lifeless eyes held me in their gaze. I couldn’t look away, even for a second.And  just when I thought that my heart might explode out of my chest, Adam’s face disappeared from view again. 

I could hear him. He was crawling beneath my bed. His nails scratched the floor as he dragged his body forward. 

I kept expecting his arm to shoot up from the darkness. For broken fingernails to rake across my flesh and choke the life from my veins. 

But that didn’t happen. Instead, Adam stayed there, lying still. An eerie silence blanketed the room once again, and the only audible noise in the entire house was Adam’s ragged breathing, directly below my head. 

Then, a wet gurgle seeped up through the bed frame. “*I’m going to come back for you someday. You’ll end up just like him.”*

I stayed awake for hours, those words rattling in my head, waiting for the moment that he would choose to end my life. But although my heart hammered harder than it ever had before and the adrenaline running through my system was enough to put down a horse, I must have drifted off to sleep eventually. Because the next thing I remember, I opened my eyes to find Mom frantically shaking me awake. 

“Max. Max, wake up! Where is your brother??” 

I groggily sat up, rubbing my eyes, until the events from the previous night came crashing down on me like a freight train. I trembled as I met my mother’s worried gaze, and summoning all of my strength, I pointed down below the bed. 

Mom didn’t respond. She knelt, leaving me holding my breath, shaking uncontrollably, expecting a clawed, gnarled hand to grab her at any moment. But it didn’t. Instead, Mom’s face began to turn red as she re-emerged. 

“Max, this isn’t funny. Your brother is missing, and now is *not* the time for practical jokes.” 

Those words… They were like music to my ears. I know how messed up that is. I know that I should have been concerned. This was my little brother, for fuck’s sake, I should have felt *some* kind of worry or panic or fear. But I didn’t. 

Instead, I felt a sense of overwhelming relief. 

\*\*\*

They found Adam’s body the next day. His corpse was lying in the trench, where he’d fallen over a month prior. The coroner was perplexed. According to him, Adam’s body showed signs that it had been deteriorating for weeks. The level of decay was too advanced for him to have died mere hours earlier. 

To this day, I still can’t explain what that thing was or what happened to my brother. Sometimes it feels like a twisted fever dream. But I know that what I experienced all those years ago was real. And I’m convinced that whatever took over my Adam’s body that day is still out there. 

Last night, while staying at my parents’ house for the first time in months, I visited the crevice. I don’t know why I did it. I think part of me still needed closure. But that’s not what I found. 

Because as I stared into the darkness, I swear that I heard Adam’s voice calling my name from the abyss.

Even now, it’s inside my head, beckoning me. I know that whatever controlled Adam then has made good on its promise. I don’t know how much time I have left, but I know it won’t be long before I join it in the dark and let it [take me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
