The cafeteria was once again filled with students bumping into each other, their collected sweats infiltrating the air

I walked towards the schools crowded cafeteria and looked around to maybe find a classmate that might give me a free treat, as i turned to my side there was again a long line of students, i walked towards the commotion, curious about what the long line is for. I approached the food stand and looked up to read what they were fussing about. "NEW mutton burger"  the sign above read.

'I haven't had a mutton burger in a very long time," i muttered to myself.

I got excited and speed walked behind the chain of hungry students. While in line i noticed one of my classmates also waiting in line. I walked up to them and asked if they could also get me the "mutton" burger.

They simply nodded in response, And after some time my classmate finally gave me the "MUTTON" burger.

As i took the paper-like wrapper to reveal the "MUTTON" burger i was greeted by an unfamiliar scent, i brushed it off thinking it was just my sense of smell renewing since i hadn't had a "MUTTON" burger in a while.

I took a bite of the so called "MUTTON" burger and once again was greeted by a foreign taste 'i dont recall mutton tasting like sweet beef.' i wondered to myself and stared at the meal, an eerie feeling slowly taking over me.

I snapped out of my thoughts when my classmate approached me and asked if i was ok.

I told him what i was thinking and he assured me that maybe it was just the lamb meat that's making the burger taste strange, since we often didn't have lamb meat in our school.

The bell rang indicating the break time was over. All of the students were rushing to go back to their classrooms.

The cafeteria was left empty , no one was left but me and the cafeteria personnels

I stood up with a disgusted expression my appetite no longer existing.

I stepped towards the trash can to discard the "MUTTON" burger; as i was preparing to leave i took a glance at the cafeteria and noticed the old lady in the back of the stall window prepping the meat looking at me with an odd smile on her face.

The thing is, as she was prepping the meat she is so unsanitary about it , the meat is all over the place and her apron is filled with splatters of brown stain for some reason. I just ignored it thinking it was just the oxidized lamb blood.

Her murderous  like gaze felt so suffocating  that i felt as if i was a prey in a predators hunting grounds.

Another thing is , I have never seen this lady before in my life , But i assured myself that it was just a new cafeteria staff that's filling in for the old cafeteria workers.

I got to my next class minutes late because of the uncanny encounter. But as the minutes passed by my mind had completely been loaded with assumptions about the burgers.

Eventually  one of my friend noticed how distressed i am. I told my friend about the encounter that i had with the old lady and with the "MUTTON' burger theories . To my shock , She thinks the same . She told me how  the burgers tasted  off and that the burgers doesn't taste like lamb meat but a strange sweet beef taste.

I know that this is just a small matter

however, I am the type of person who wont stop overthinking things unless  i know what's happening  behind it. Added to the fact where this creepy cafeteria lady is also involved with it.

As the day passed by this so called "MUTTON" burgers becomes super popular at our school. But me and my friend (lets call her karla) me and karla were obviously not a fan of the famous burger. And we often experience the uncanny gaze of the old lady in the cafeteria.

Me and karla were totally convinced that there is something going on within this infamous burger. Eversince the new cafeteria staff joined the school everything changed. Karla noticed it too , so im not really that mentally deranged cause of the burgers.

Hey guys would you like me to continue this? would you guys like another part?
