Monday:

I was at my house in the afternoon, watching YouTube videos, there was no one there, it was night, and since I was watching horror stories, I closed the door, the window, the curtain and turned on my lamp to have at least one light on, since turning on the light in my room would illuminate too much, and they also taught me not to use electricity even if I was afraid.  
  
Everything was fine, my parents had gone on a trip with my brothers, I stayed at home because I don't like to go out, and I prefer to have all the comforts 24/7, of course, sometimes my older brother comes to check on me. everything is fine and in order.  
  
The other night, I tried to go to the basement to look for some dumbbells to train a little, but something strange happened, everything was normal until the light in the small storage room began to flicker, followed by a very serious sound, similar to that of a whale. , but much more serious, and very strong, I felt my body vibrate, happily my brother was up there, and I asked him if he had felt that, and he responded with -I think you're already going crazy- in a joking way, but without However, I kept thinking about what that was, my brother, noticing that I was strange, told me that it was most likely a car that was passing by, and the vibrations were a consequence of the weight of the car or something like that, and that answer calmed me down a little. further.  
  
That same night we watched a movie, "The Thing", an old movie, which was very boring, I was looking at my cell phone throughout the movie. MY brother, annoyed, with a mocking voice told me that he didn't know good terror, to which I responded with "Chucky beats him."  
  
This morning my brother left, they called him urgently from work and he had to fly, I was left alone, which wouldn't be a problem, if it weren't for the fact that I was having hallucinations, they weren't very strong, they were small, mild, like that you see shadows out of the corner of your eyes, happily, my mother taught me that if I ever felt vulnerable because of these things, just repeat "the blood of Christ has power", until I calmed down, since in some way I am a believer, not exactly Catholic or Christian, I am not very informed about that, but I do believe that there is something bigger than us or at least something that unites us and unites the universe.

Little by little these "hallucinations" began to invade more senses of my body, it started with the shadows that were hidden, but a while ago I began to hear a constant sound, and at first it was as if covered, but it has become clearer with the time, and it sounds like a hallway, empty, like it's an abandoned warehouse, I don't know how I know this, it's like I just know. I hope my brother arrives soon, I called him and he doesn't answer, it's already getting late and he's not coming back.
