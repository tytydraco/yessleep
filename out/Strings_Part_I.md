Ever since I was little, my mom and dad told me ghosts aren’t real. They’ve never experienced anything paranormal in their lives and neither have I. It’s strange that my parents decided to move to Ample then. A town that is pretty much known for paranormal activity.

When I asked them why they decided to move here my dad told me they wanted to get out of the city while my mom said they wanted a better atmosphere for me. Why they chose this place over the city makes no sense to me. I think they chose the most boring place in the entire state. I’ve lived in the same place since I was five.

Our house faces the ocean. Which is nice during the summer but that’s only three months out of the entire freaking year when there’s any sun. The rest of the time, it’s raining, cold, and covered in fog. You can hardly see houses across the inlet most days. There’s an absurd amount of seagull poop on the sidewalk. It gets worse when the tourists leave corndogs or ice cream out and all the birds start to frenzy. I dare anyone to convince me there isn’t a sight as vicious as a whole colony of seagulls swarming in on leftovers. Screeching and hollering at each other as if it’s life or death. I think only piranhas come close.

Needless to say, I don’t like living in Ample. I am ready to go away. To get out. Spread my wings. Leave the nest. Fly the coop. Sorry for all the bird sayings. My dad’s a birdwatcher. He makes way too many bird puns and it’s rubbed off.

Anyway, I need to get this out. Nothing ever happens in Ample. It’s a tourist town. People don’t really stay here. They take photos, buy some merch, post about it, and move on. So, it’s weird when someone new moves in.

Next door is the Walker House. It isn’t the only supernatural thing in town but it certainly has a reputation. It’s a Victorian house. Two-stories. The lower half of the house is yellow and the top half is green. There are so many windows and I haven’t managed to count all of them. There’s three facing my bedroom window from the first floor alone.

No one’s lived in it for decades. There’s a local legend that Ralph Walker, the last and only owner of the home, cursed the place after his youngest son lost his arm in the sawmill he was in charge of. It’s been reported that some visitors have seen shadows moving inside, an armless man in the basement, or even Ralph Walker himself walking up the stairs.

I’ve never experienced any of them. To me, it’s always been the big house next door. When I was a kid, I used to pretend it was a castle. Like the stone ones in Wales or Ireland. Ivy spreading upward and growing on the walls. A relic that would be fit for a museum instead of by the seaside in this tourist trap.

That’s how the Walker House used to be. Until two days ago. That’s when the Kinsey family moved in.

I saw the moving truck parked at the back of the house. I took a picture of it and sent it to my friend, Logan. He replied with exclamation points. He wanted photos of the new neighbors. I took some photos from the kitchen window as the moving crews carried old couches, bed frames, and all the other furniture through the white fence’s entryway. There were two people that I saw. Both looked to be my grandparents’ age. One was a guy. Hunched back and a gray beard. The other must’ve been his wife. She was pretty short and always touching the back of her neck. I sent them to Logan.

“Boomers! Total Boomers! Yikes!” He replied.

I laughed at the reply. As I was watching the movers I noticed a third person. A kid. He was following the elders when they came in and out of the house. I figured he must be their grandkid. Short redhead. Marching around like he was in charge. I was about to take another photo of the child for Logan but my mom came in. She was putting on her nametag and brushing her hair. I looked at her and stepped away from the window to let her look.

“New neighbors, huh? Colleen told me we were getting new ones.”

She watched for a bit. I didn’t say anything.

“Must be retirees,” she said.

“Boomers,” I replied.

My mom gave me a tilt of her head. Her brown hair flipped to one side. Her glasses nearly falling off her nose as she squinted at me like the librarian she is.

“Is that an insult, Miles?”

“No, Mom. Just an observation.”

My mom seemed to think that it was an insult. She told me that it would be good for both of us to go greet our new neighbors. I didn’t want to. Mom insisted. I know better than to argue with her.

I went along with her. The wharf was having one of those sunny days when the light catches on the water. The smell of seaweed made a foul fermented smell in the heat. Seagulls and crows were fighting over a piece of crab that washed ashore. There was a couple taking pictures on the dock. Probably of the plaque talking about one of the older townsfolk whose spirit was said to haunt the spot. Just another day in Ample.

I followed my mom. Hands in my pockets. Shoulders up.

She approached the neighbors.

“Afternoon, neighbors,” my mom said.

I rolled my eyes. Thinking it was so cliché.

The old couple were on the other side of the picket fence. The movers still coming in and out of the house.  

“Well, hello there.” The old man said in a droll voice. His face in a wide smile that matched his wife’s.

“Pleasure to meet you,” Mom said. “I’m Amy and this’s my son, Miles.”

I waved. My mom gave me another look. Guess I wasn’t enthusiastic enough.

“Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I’m Esther Kinsey and my husband—”

“Landon. Landon Kinsey.”

I saw Mrs. Kinsey’s face for the first time. I probably stared a bit longer than I should have but her eyes freaked me out. Her right one was brown and the other was blue. Whether I was making it weird with how long I stared, I don’t know. It was my mom that got me out of my head when she asked another question.

“And who is this?”

The kid was standing behind the Kinsey’s. He was watching us. No smile. No frown. Just looking. I figured the different color eyes must be genetic as he had a brown and a blue eye like Esther only in reverse.

“Rowan. Our child.”

Call me uneducated but the first thought that went through my head was that they’re too old to have kids. I was really confused. I wanted to ask how this five- or six-year-old could be their kid. But I kept my manners and decided not to ask. Could be an ugly family situation or something. Logan’s parents are divorced. He’s told me how messy the whole thing is. For all I know our new neighbors might’ve taken their grandchild from a bad situation.

While all that was going through my head, my mom greeted the kid. Rowan said nothing. He kept staring. I don’t think he’ll stop the rumors that ginger people don’t have souls. Even my mom cleared her throat after getting no response for at least a minute. The Kinsey’s were still smiling widely as they looked at Rowan. I saw real love in their eyes when they looked at him. Their child didn’t seem to notice. He kept quiet while my mom kept talking.

“Anyway, my husband’s not here right now but I know he won’t mind if I invite you both over for dinner some time. Since we’re going to be neighbors, we might as well get to know each other.”

The Kinsey’s turned around and nodded. Still grinning. Still looking happier than a rooster in a hen house.

Damn it. Curse you, Dad.

“That would be lovely. Simply lovely,” Mrs. Kinsey said.

“You want us to bring anything with us?” Mr. Kinsey asked.

“Just yourselves,” Mom said. “Hope you like spaghetti.”

I braced for what was coming next as my mom put her thumb to her fingers. Bobbing her hand up and down as she exclaimed in an exaggerated Italian accent that she made a mean meatball spaghetti.

I sighed. I really need to get out of here.

Both the Kinsey’s laughed as one of the movers started to curse. I turned my head and saw that the refrigerator was standing on his foot. He was giving a sailor a run for his money with how many curses he got out. My mom ran over to help as another mover shoved the dolly under.

I did the asshole thing and recorded it on my phone. The child had moved closer to the action. He was laughing while the man breathed and swore as the fridge was lifted off his foot. I thought it was pretty sadistic for a child to laugh at someone’s pain. Then again, I recorded it. Doesn’t make me much better. My mom and the Kinseys talked with the injured mover. I stayed back. Rowan clapping his hands and giggling. I sent the video to Logan figuring he’d probably get a kick out of it, too.

I got a medical kit from the kitchen that my mom told me to get. The mover bandaged up his foot which didn’t look too bad. I only saw a bleeding toe nail. The refrigerator was the last thing the movers had to put in. My mom told me to help since I’m such a strong man.

I hate when she says things like that. I wanted to refuse but I felt I would look like an ass if I didn’t do anything since the one mover was hurt and the only other person who could help was an old man. I did help the other mover carry in the fridge. Mr. Kinsey followed us inside while Mom, Mrs. Kinsey, and the kid stayed by the fence. I pushed from the bottom while the mover pulled the dolly. We got it up the back steps and into the kitchen. That was my first glimpse inside the Walker House.

The place didn’t feel haunted just hollow. There was no sense of the place being lived in. Even with the furniture inside, the place felt like a large dollhouse rather instead of an actual home where people should be living. What was left of the wall paint was bright yellow and it was peeling. I noticed an old wood door that I guessed lead to the basement.

“Right there’s fine,” Mr. Kinsey said.

We set the fridge up against the wall. The mover started to plug it in. I noticed there was no dishwasher in the kitchen as I started to make my way to the backdoor.

“Thanks for the help, Miles,” Mr. Kinsey said.

I didn’t know how to take how familiar he sounded when he said my name. He was saying it like we’d known each other for a long time and not just that morning. I think it’s just what old people do. When you help them out then you’ve cemented yourself in their social circle. Or bingo club. Or whatever it is they call their friend groups.    

“No problem,” I replied.

 I returned to the other side of the fence my mom was on. Mr. Kinsey put his arm around his wife as the movers closed the back of their truck. We said our goodbyes to the Kinseys and my mom told me that they seemed nice. Odd. But nice.

I think odd was an understatement. They’re probably some of the strangest people I’ve ever met and I wasn’t sure why.

People have started referring to the Walker House as the Kinsey House. I think I preferred the house with no one in it. It always used to feel separate from the town. An artifact that people could look at but never own. Now it feels like it’s morphed into the neighborhood. Possessed for the first time in almost a century.

The next night, my dad set up the table while my mom checked the pot holding her, saying it with me now, “mean meatball spaghetti” sauce.

God, so cringe.

She had me taste test the sauce. I can’t deny that my mom knows how to make good spaghetti. I put down the plates and silverware. My dad had put down a red table cloth that we only put out when guests were coming over. I wasn’t sure whether my dad was looking forward to this dinner with the neighbors or not.

He worked late most nights. He was a forester with a timber company and he mostly wanted to sit on the living room couch, drink a beer, and watch YouTube videos after work. My mom was more the social butterfly. Sometimes I wonder how my parents ended up together. My dad isn’t one to go out of his way to know new people. I think he’d rather be out hiking trails and recording bird calls than having people over.

I think I shared that in common with my dad. At least, this time I did. I didn’t want to have the Kinsey’s over. The more I thought about how they smiled, how Mr. Kinsey said my name so formally, and the way the kid laughed at the mover’s injury; the more I felt there was something off about them.

Honestly, I just wanted to go into my room and play video games. That was also what made me annoyed. I had to be at dinner with the neighbors because my parents expected me to be there with them. They couldn’t suffer through it alone. They had to make sure I suffered with them.

When the Kinsey’s came, Rowan wasn’t with them. My mom asked where the little one was and they told her that he was already in bed. Still tuckered out from the move. Whether my mom disapproved of leaving the child in a new house by himself, she didn’t say anything. Not then anyway. I know, from my own experience, that she never would’ve let me stay on my own when I was that age. No matter how far away she was.

My dad greeted Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey. Making a joke that Mr. Kinsey had quiet a grip for a man his age. Mr. Kinsey laughed. He said he hoped so as he had plenty of experience using an axe and chainsaw. That definitely caught my dad’s interest as Mr. Kinsey started to go into his history as a logger. They took seats at the table while my mom showed Mrs. Kinsey around the house.

“Such a lovely kitchen,” Mrs. Kinsey said. “Lovely smell, too. Is that the spaghetti?”

“You bet.”

Thankfully my mom didn’t drop her Italian accent again this time. I sat at a chair in the living room while my parents were playing host. I texted Logan. Telling him that the neighbors were here and I was already tired.

“Ditch and come hang,” he replied.

I texted back that I wanted to. I knew that it would get both my parents mad at me if I went to Logans. As much as my parents annoy me, like a lot of the time, I do love them.

If they read this, I deny everything.

I also had some feeling that I needed to be here to watch the Kinseys. That they were going to do something that was going to show that they weren’t the kindly eccentric neighbors my mom seemed to think they were based on her first impression.

“And what are you doing in here, Miles?” Mrs. Kinsey asked.

She was looking at me from the kitchen. The same warm smile on her face as she had from the picket fence. I wasn’t expecting anyone to talk to me while I was minding my own business. I looked at her eyes then got uncomfortable at the discoloration and focused on her mouth instead.

“Texting a friend,” I said.

Mrs. Kinsey nodded. I could hear my dad and Mr. Kinsey laughing in the kitchen.

“Are there a lot of kids in town?” she asked.

I didn’t care for being lumped in with “kids.” I’m sure to all people her age anyone twenty and under would be considered a kid.

“Not too many,” I said. “Most live out of town.”

The lucky ones anyway, I thought.

“That’s fine. That’s real fine to hear.”

I wasn’t sure what she meant by that. I didn’t get a chance to ask either as my dad started making duck calls from the kitchen. Mr. Kinsey clapped. I’m sure my mom was giving him a look. Mrs. Kinsey turned around to peak at the commotion.

As she did, I noticed a bandage on the back of her neck. I don’t mean a Band-Aid. It was a large bandage. Something you’d put over a large wound and not a small scratch.

Mrs. Kinsey turned back around to look at me. Still smiling. I was caught off guard by the sight of the bandage. Maybe she’d had a bad fall recently.

My mom called us in for dinner. Mrs. Kinsey turned away from me. The bandage coming into focus again. I waited a moment. Absorbing what I’d seen. In hindsight, it’s not a big deal. People injure themselves all the time. I brought bandages to the mover just the day before.

It was just the placement of it that was odd. What could this old woman have done to the back of her neck to need a bandage?

“Miles,” Mom called. “Get off your phone and come eat.”

I made my way to the kitchen. I stopped thinking about the bandage and scooted into a seat next to my dad. My mom was at the head of the table while the Kinseys were on the other side. An extra plate and silverware out where we thought the child would be sitting.

The spaghetti was already dished out. My mom had set out parmesan cheese for us to put on our dinner. My stomach was growling when I saw the meal. I picked up my fork but my mom gave me a look.

“How does it look?” she asked.

The Kinseys glanced at the noodles, sauce and meatballs. They weren’t smiling now. It was the first time I saw them looking really intense as they stared at their plates. Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey were quiet. My mom cleared her throat while my dad was drinking from a beer he’d gotten from the fridge.

“Looks real fine. Real fine. Doesn’t it, Esther?”

Mrs. Kinsey nodded. “I think so, Landon. I don’t remember the last time we had a meal as nice as this.”

“I can give you the recipe,” Mom said.

“That’d be fine,” Mr. Kinsey said. “Real fine.”

My mom picked up the parmesan. She passed it to my dad. Then to me. I tried giving it to Mrs. Kinsey but she was still staring at the dish. The spaghetti seeming to be the most interesting thing in the world to her.

“You want the cheese, Mrs. Kinsey?” I asked.

Mrs. Kinsey looked at me. Her blue eye glowing a little underneath the kitchen lights. “No thank you, dear.”

She looked at the spaghetti again. I wondered if they were going to look at it all night like it was some art piece.

“Would you happen to have any plastic utensils?” Mr. Kinsey asked.  

Dad and Mom shared a look.

“No. Sorry,” Mom said. “Is there something wrong with those ones?”

“No. Nothing wrong,” Mr. Kinsey said. “Nothing wrong at all. We’re used to plastic. Rowan gets his hands into things and we switched everything to plastic.”

“Oh, I see,” Mom said.

The Kinseys started to eat their spaghetti without further comment. My dad and Mr. Kinsey talked a little about the logging business. My mom gave Mrs. Kinsey her spaghetti recipe. I was getting ready to make a retreat to my room where I could boot up my Switch and play some Mario Kart. Before I did though, Mrs. Kinsey asked if it would be alright if she used the bathroom.

“Would you show her where it is?” My mom asked me.

I led Mrs. Kinsey to the bathroom across from my room. Mrs. Kinsey thanked me and went inside. I opened the door to my room and heard the sink turn on. I knew it was probably odd of me to look back but I did. The door to the bathroom was open slightly. I peeked in to see Mrs. Kinsey washing her hands.

I don’t mean she was washing her hands leisurely like you do after going to the bathroom. She was violently washing them. I watched her pick in-between her fingers, rub the palms of her hands hard against each other, and cover the front and back of her hands in soap. I thought that once she rinsed the soap off there would be nothing but bone left behind.

As she dried her hands with a towel, I noticed how red her hands were. I backed into my room before she came out. Closing the door quietly behind me. I stood on the other side of my door as Mrs. Kinsey walked through the hallway and back to the kitchen. I was about to send what I saw to Logan when I heard stomping coming through the halls. I heard the bathroom door close and the sink turn on again.

I thought it was Mrs. Kinsey again but when I cracked open my bedroom door, I saw Mr. Kinsey leaving. His own hands bright red from thorough scrubbing. After he left, I heard my parents say goodbye to them along before the front door shut.

I went to my window and watched the Kinseys walk up the wood steps of their house. The wind had picked up. The waves were choppier. Some seawater sprinkling on my window. I saw the light come on in their living room. I watched as they sat down in perfect sync with each other. I kept watching for maybe a minute or two.

Kinda stalker-y, I know. But I feel like what I saw justifies it.  

While I was texting Logan about what happened, I noticed movement on the wharf. I could tell from the red hair and short stature that it was their child.  Where he’d come from, I have no idea. He might’ve stepped out wondering where the Kinseys were or he could’ve been outside the entire time while we were eating dinner.

I took a video of Rowan with my phone as he headed to the house. He knocked on the door and Mr. Kinsey got off the couch to open the door for him. When they were inside, Mr. Kinsey went back to his spot. I couldn’t see where the child went.

I sent the video to Logan. Telling him about the kid outside and how the people just left him out there. I was going to show this to my parents. I thought this was child neglect or something. I was ready to go out my room and show them the video. That was until I got the reply from Logan.

“What child?”

“what do u mean?”  I replied.

“I dont see any child,” Logan replied.

I replayed the video for myself. Rowan didn’t appear in it at all. The only thing I could can see is Mr. Kinsey opening the door. I thought at first it was too dark for the camera to catch him. I remembered the video I had taken of the mover stubbing his toe with the fridge.

I watched that one. I was sure I had gotten the kid laughing while the man swore. But, again, there was no child. You can’t even hear any laughing in the video. Just the mover cussing.  

I’ve been processing all of this for a few days now. Logan thinks I’m making it up. I decided to post here just to see if there’s anyone who’s had a similar experience. I haven’t seen our neighbors since they’ve had dinner with us a couple days ago. I’ve never believed in ghosts but now I’m starting to wonder if there’s something to those stories.

I’ll post more when something happens.
