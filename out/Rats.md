"Great, another rat!"

I'd mutter this line to myself almost every day, You see, I just recently inherited a house from my late grandparents, it's a fairly large house and it didn't look to be in a rough condition, so my cat Bob and I decided to immediately move in, even if find out later on that the house has some hidden flaws, at the time I thought anything is better than paying rent for a tiny apartment, soon enough I found out how wrong I was.

The house itself is fine, actually it's great, it has tons of rooms and looked like it won't be much of a money drain, the only thing that requires a decent investment is getting the walls painted.

The problem, however is that it's almost impossible to push through a day without seeing at least a couple of large rats, What I'm dealing with isn't your typical rat infestation, it's so bad that I dread going to the bathroom because I fully expect another furry little bastard to greet me once again while excitedly chewing on my toothbrush. 

Bob isn't really a rat hitman, but considering he's an old chubby cat that can barely remember where the litter box is, I'd say he's doing his best, he manages to defeat a rat from time to time in a rough one on one battle, but unfortunately goes to sleep right after the fight.

I tried using some rat traps, but they seem to be useless in the long run, they simply multiply faster than I can get rid of them, but I also must admit I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, so I forgot where I put the traps and then I step on them every once in awhile, It's not my fault that my memory is probably worse than Bob's.

The worst place in the house is the attic or as I like to call it "The Lair".

The attic must be their favorite spot in the whole house, late at night I can hear the fuzzy beasts skittering in the attic, It sounds like there's hundreds if not thousands of them, soft fast steps, loud heavy thumps, screeches, not only that, but sometimes it sounds like they're opening the attic door just so they can sneakily steal some cheese from my fridge...

I don't have the needed courage to check the attic out for myself, I'd probably get a heart attack after opening the attic door and seeing a rat avalanche falling on top of me.

I've already contacted a rat exterminator, he told me he'll pay me a visit next week, so as far as I'm concerned he can deal with the attic.

Earlier, I made a joke about the rats stealing food from my fridge, but I was only half kidding. If I leave any food on the kitchen table before I go to bed, it will get nibbled on or straight up devoured overnight, I once left a  nice meatball sub wrapped in foil on the kitchen table, In the morning I was surprised to see most of it was eaten, based on the bite marks it looks like they chewed through the foil and even enjoyed the taste of it.

Sometimes random items from my fridge go missing, but to be fair that probably isn't their fault, more likely I just forgot when I ate that food.
Now that you know the most important points here's where things get weird...

One night I was watching a movie while Bob was being a good boy, snuggled up next to me like usual, all of a sudden he jumped off the couch, I was surprised to see my usually sluggish cat move that hastily. It looked like he found something next to the couch, but before I can even react to what he did, he jumped back on top of the couch, as soon as I looked at Bob's jaw I was frozen by a strange mix of confusion and fear, in his mouth he was carrying a small rat, that isn't what scared me, what scared me is the fact that this rat's head was missing, ripped bloody flesh was all that was remaining.

Only a couple of seconds passed and then it hit me, Bob didn't do this, he only found it, there's no way he could've ripped it's head clean off and swallowed it in seconds, even if Bob was a lightning fast rat murderer, the rat would've at least let out some sort of screech of pain before it's demise.

I put on my rubber gloves and threw the headless rat in the garbage while almost vomiting out of disgust, unfortunately it didn't end there.

Three days later I found another headless rat corpse under the carpet and two decaying rat heads behind the couch. 

I read some articles online that say cannibalism among rats isn't uncommon, so at the time that was my only explanation.

A day passed after that discovery.

In the middle of the night I was shifting in my bed while Bob was sleeping in his his usual spot right next to my feet, once again I could hear the sound of rats screeching and running around in the attic, with each passing second I was getting more and more annoyed. 

Finally, one more time I hear what sounds like the attic door opening and closing.

I brush that off, I thought I was mishearing things or just hallucinating because of the lack of sleep.

Suddenly, I realize that I have left half of my cheeseburger on the living room table.

I get out of bed slowly, trying not to wake up Bob, while groggily walking towards the living room.

Before entering the living room, I took a moment to mentally prepare for what I might see in the living room, I expected to see a couple of dirty rats munching on my juicy cheeseburger, what I saw was incomparably worse.

I immediately regretted turning the light on, instead of a couple of rats feasting on my food, I saw a sickly old man covered in warts and pimples sitting on the living room couch, he was so pale that I wondered if he ever saw the sun, he was wearing a dusty ragged black robe, he wasn't wearing any footwear, his feet were covered in warts just like the rest of his body, both his nails and toenails were long and charcoal black.

I was scanning him slowly with my eyes, completely stunned, even though I turned on the lights he paid no attention to me, he started opening his mouth, under the dry lips I could see a set of dark yellow teeth, then I noticed a rat squirming and screeching desperately in his hand, the sickly man brought the rat close to his mouth and without even a moment of hesitation he bit down on the poor creature's head, with a loud crunch he bit off the rat's head and swallowed it whole, an audible gulp instantly followed.

As he finished, his gaze turned towards me, his soulless gray pupils couldn't stop staring at me, his neutral expression slowly morphed into an expression of pure anger, I could see the veins on his bald head start bulging.

I was frozen solid in fear, I couldn't even take a step while the disturbing man jumped off the couch and unnervingly got on all fours like some wild animal, in what felt like a second or two he started sprinting on all fours, he pounced towards the window, he headbutted the window with surprising power causing it to shatter as he jumped out of the house and squealed like some sort of wounded pig.

He ran away into the darkness, while I was staring at the destroyed window in disbelief.

A couple of weeks passed after this incident, the house is finally rat-free. 

After the police did their investigation, they were able to tell me a couple of things that were both informative and frightening.

They told me that the intruder was living in the attic for at least a month, they did a full sweep of the attic and found multiple rat corpses scattered around the attic, they also found bags and bags of rancid trash, their theory was that the intruder was gathering trash and bringing it to the the attic in hope of luring as many rats as possible to his location. 

Surprisingly, the most disturbing discovery wasn't anything that was found in the attic.

Under my bed, they found multiple headless rat corpses...
