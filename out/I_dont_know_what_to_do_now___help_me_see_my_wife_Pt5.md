[Here's part 1 if you need context.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j87yhb/i_need_help_seeing_my_wife_again/) Sorry I didn’t post for a bit. I was bedridden while nearly coughing my lungs out, but at least I’m able to do stuff now.

I’ve seen that thing a couple of times since I last posted. Once when I was in the kitchen, it was just watching me. The other was downstairs standing in the bathroom, but I can only see it through mirrors. I don’t know why, but it only shows up in mirrors. I don’t know what it’ll do, but its hand is always stretched out. Sometimes it drifts towards me, sometimes it just stands there. It may be waiting for something for all I know, but I've only seen it in the mirrors. It looks shorter than I am, but taller than my wife. I don’t think it’s her. I don’t have proof of that yet, but it doesn’t feel like something she would do. I started carrying around a mirror too. I look through it as I walk around the house now, but I haven’t seen that thing yet. I still sleep in my bed because where else am I going to go? To a bed that my wife was never in, one that doesn’t remind me of her? 

Besides, I’m still not sure if it’s her or not. I have no clue what that thing is or what it wants. If it kills me, does that mean it’s my time to go? If it’s her, then why run away? If it isn’t her, doesn’t that mean I’ll be able to see her too?

I think I might try sleeping on her grave. Maybe then I’ll see her in my mirrors instead. Speaking of that beautiful woman, I sat in her art room for a while and found a note I wrote her years ago. It was a promise that I would give her an amazing anniversary. My walls used to be decorated with her art. Now her drawings sit in a pile in her art room. My home looks like some sort of asylum - some crazy person’s ramblings. 

I don’t know how much longer I can go without seeing her. I need her back in my life. I started looking for more… dangerous rituals. I’ve heard some ideas I might start trying, but I’m going to sleep on her grave tonight. It’s been getting warm outside lately, warm enough that I’ll probably be fine if I sleep outside. 

I wonder how people look when they’re ghosts… Do they look normal? Do they look like a mix of everyone’s idea of them? Do we keep the figure of how we looked when we died? When I see her, will her head still be split open? Will she look how I remember, or will she be different? Will she glow when I see her? Will she still remember me?

This house has begun to creak and groan in the wind. The wind has also been howling lately. I still feel terrible. My heart has felt weak, my throat is sore, and I can’t sleep. I’ve been eating cough drops like candy, and putting those pain patches on me like I’m trying to fix a quilt. I’ve had to drink so much caffeine just to get going. My teeth seem to tremble. Not my jaw, but my teeth. I don’t know what’s doing this. Maybe one of the things I’ve done? Maybe one of the rituals is killing me.

I’ve mounted a mirror on my set up. That way I can see the glow from the mirror if that thing comes into my little work area. That’s how I’ve been noticing it. When it’s in the mirror, the mirror seems to glow a little bit despite the room being dark. I caught a glimpse of the thing’s lower half, and it almost looks like it’s wearing robes in it’s shape. That or a long skirt, but this thing isn't very feminine. Then again, it isn’t masculine either. I’ve started wearing my gun on my hip lately. Maybe I’ll try shooting that thing.

No, that’s a stupid thought. It’s definitely ghostly. Maybe the mask can be broken, but if that is my wife, then I don’t think I’d want to hurt her. 

I’ve started to find myself in her art room more and more. I woke up in there one day, just laying in the middle of the room under her half finished painting. It looked more finished than I remembered, like I remember it missing a whole corner, but I guess not. 

I’ve been considering one of the rituals where you’re supposed to summon someone by killing someone they know. I’m considering it more than I should, but I don’t know if it’ll work. I told her I’d do anything for her, but I just don’t know if it would give me what I’m looking for. 

Sorry if this seems a little scattered, I'm not able to concentrate lately.
