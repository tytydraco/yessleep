If I was going to [throw Daniel under the bus](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13876eu/how_to_survive_college_for_once_nepotism_is_a/), then I should at least warn him that he needed to cooperate with whatever the flickering man demanded.  It doesn’t matter what Daniel does or doesn’t deserve - I don’t want to be the kind of person that hands someone to the inhumans with no preparation or even a warning.  I can’t make choices for people and I can’t live their lives for them, but I can do this much.  I can warn him and then the rest is up to him.

But first,  I was going to take the devil’s advice.

(if you’re new, start [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))

I rehearsed.  I stood in front of the mirror on the back of our dorm door and practiced what I would say to him.  I had an agenda.  First: inform Daniel that he wasn’t free of this just because the worm wasn’t after him anymore.  Get his attention.  Second: tell him that an inhuman was going to contact him and he had to be polite and work with him.  Tell him that his life would be in danger if he didn’t and this time, there wouldn’t be an easy escape.  Third: demand an apology for how he’d treated me.

And maybe if that all went well, dig for more information about that note he received.

Cassie didn’t comment on my practicing, but I did get the vibe that she thought I was being kind of weird.  Whatever.  Talking to other people doesn’t come naturally for everyone, you know.  Some of us feel like giant awkward balls of awkward whenever we’re interacting with others.  You’d think I wouldn’t be like this, coming from a big family and all, but I dunno, maybe it’s genetic or something.

It kind of pisses me off though that I put all that work into what I was going to say and then it all turned out to be for nothing.

Because Daniel slammed the door in my face before I could get a word out.

I got into his dorm easily enough.  For as much as the university talks about dorm security and not letting people glide in after you without using a keycard, you’d think people would pay attention to it at some point.  Nope.  I got in, I got up to his floor, and I found his room with the door hanging open.  He was at his desk with his back to the hallway.  I took a breath, composed myself, and said his name.  I said I needed to talk to him.

He jumped from his seat like he’d been burned.  I was about to launch into my first point - that he wasn’t out of danger yet - but then he lunged across the room and grabbed hold of the door.  He flung it shut.

If I had been standing any closer, I think it would have broken my nose.

Then I heard the heavy click of the deadbolt.

Fine.  If he wasn’t going to talk to me, then I wasn’t going to keep trying.  I could stand here outside the door and give my speech but I didn’t want to anymore.  Screw it.  That’s one thing I’ve learned from this whole ordeal with Daniel at least - you gotta give up at some point.  You can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped.  And I think I know why he doesn’t want to talk to me.  Why he doesn’t want to even *look* at me.

I caught a glimpse of his face right before the door closed between us.  He looked guilty.

He didn’t want to be reminded of what he’d done.  He knew he’d screwed up and instead of scratching his skin off, the guilt was now eating him up on the inside.

Considering what I went through to fix my mistakes, it’s hard to feel sorry for him.

But anyway the next place I went was the vaguely phallic rock outside of the administration building.

“His name is Daniel,” I said as soon as the flickering man appeared.

“That didn’t take long for you to confirm.”  His eyes narrowed.  “Did you have prior knowledge?”

He said it like an accusation.  He already suspected I did.  Whatever.  It wouldn’t make the situation any worse to admit it.

“He wanted our help with the worm and then didn’t listen to us and screwed it all up and let it loose instead.”

“I *knew* you were lying to me,” he muttered.  “What made you change your mind?”

“He’s an ungrateful little shit who doesn’t deserve my help.”

“Oh that’s music to my ears,” he sighed.  “Every inhuman thing loves those kinds of people.  They’re delicious.”

“You weren’t going to kill him!”

“There’s plenty of fleshy bits that you humans can survive without.  Since you said he didn’t listen to you, I’ll introduce myself by taking off one of his ears.  Seems fair.  It’ll be one of those *teaching moments* that you humans all love so much.”

I closed my eyes for a moment.  At least Daniel would be alive and the worm would be gone.

“Great,” I said stiffly.  “Whatever gets this situation dealt with.  Good luck with that.”

The flickering man was still watching me thoughtfully, a finger poised on his chin.

“I promised you a favor,” he said thoughtfully.  “What do you want?  Has to be reasonable.”

Was ‘don’t kill Daniel?’ reasonable?  Could I stop the flickering man from taking an ear off?  Did I even care at this point?  Besides, I’d tried and tried so much for Daniel and so had Maria and there was someone in my life that was far more deserving of help right now.

“You seem to know everything that’s going on around here,” I said quietly.  “Do you know all the students that die?”

“I miss a few, but otherwise the odds are very good that I’m aware of a death on campus.”

His tone was soft.  He was so still he might have been carved from stone.  I had an uncanny feeling that I had the whole of his interest and he was intent on what I was going to ask for next.  That this favor he’d promised me hadn’t been a lure to get me to give him a name, but that he merely wanted to see what I would do with it.

“Even the ones that happened a while ago?” I asked.  “Do you keep track of them?”

“I *do* keep track.  Lucky for you.”  He smiled, showing his teeth.  “Who do you want to know about?”

I told him about Cassie’s roommate.  I asked him what had happened to her.

“That’s it?”  He sounded disappointed.  “That’s what you want to know?”

“It’s important to me,” I said defensively.

“No, it’s important to someone you’re not going to have contact with in another three years, but sure, whatever, you tell yourself that.”

I wanted to argue, but also this was *an inhuman* and arguing with inhumans rarely ended well, so I kept silent.  He smiled maliciously and paused, his gaze sliding sideways to stare off somewhere in the distance.  Reminiscing.

“I know what happened to her,” he murmured thoughtfully.  “The thing in the hallway took her.  Crunched her bones up nice and fine.  It wasn’t especially hungry, so it chewed slowly.  Really savored all the meaty bits before getting to the organs.  Is that what you wanted to know?”

No.  It wasn’t what I wanted to know.  Not anymore.  I felt sick.  I wanted him to be lying, I wanted this to be just another of his taunts designed to make me hate him, but he was inhuman and most inhumans don’t lie.  I have a feeling he’s one of the ones that don’t lie.

“That’s all there is to it,” he concluded.  “I’m not sure what you were hoping to learn - or accomplish - with this, but I have nothing more to give you.”

It was just another stupid, pointless death.  Just another person consumed by the never-ending hunger of the inhuman world.  There was no reason for it, no purpose, nothing but pure misfortune.

Just like how my father died.

How did I tell Cassie?  Could I trust myself to lie to her?  Look her in the eye and tell her that her roommate was dead but that at least she died quickly?  That she didn’t suffer?

I’d wasted a favor.  Perhaps that was why the flickering man was staring at me with such amusement in his eyes.

“You could have just said she’s dead,” I said quietly.  “I didn’t need the details.”

“You asked and I gave you the *full* answer,” he retorted.  “Anyway, I suppose our cooperation is concluded then.  I’ll just pop over and deal with the worm and then I’ll get back to finding a way to kill you slowly and horribly.”

“You said no threats!”

He grinned.

“That’s not a threat,” he said sweetly.  “That’s a promise.”

And he vanished.

Neither Maria nor I have contact with Daniel anymore, so I don’t know if anything has happened yet.  But life goes on.  There’s still classes to go to and homework to finish.  And in the time since I last posted, there’s also been an interesting development in the geology department.

I think we all know that when I say ‘interesting’ what I really mean is ‘awful’ because that’s just how my life is I guess.

Quick refresher on the professors in the geology department.  Professor Monotone is who I had last semester and he somehow managed to make dinosaurs boring.  Bad news: I have him again this semester.  The geology department isn’t that big so I think it's going to be unavoidable that I get him as my professor a few more times before I graduate.

Professor L. is the other professor I’ve had and I like him a bit better, if only because he actually has a personality.  He asks how I’m doing when he sees me in the hallway between classes and if there’s no one around, he asks if I’m still going to counseling.

I am and we’re talking a lot about how past events are not an indication of the future and how to avoid thinking that way.  Basically she’s trying to help reconfigure my brain so that it doesn’t assume everyone around me is going to die like my dad and my ex-boyfriend did.

It’s kind of hard to make progress when you know there really are monsters out there and that your friends are on the menu, tbh.

But anyway, Professor L. is just trying to help so I’m polite to him.  I hope that I can get in his classes next year instead of Professor Monotone.  Or maybe even someone new, I saw another name on the schedule for some of the 300-level classes I’ll be taking soon.  In the meantime, I’m stuck struggling to stay awake in class.  At least it’s not in the lecture hall, so that’s helped.  And since pretty much every classroom with windows borders the graveyard, I’d had pure stress to keep me alert ever since the encounter with the groundskeeper.

I keep feeling like he’s out there, staring at me from inside the graveyard, but I think that’s just my nerves because every time I look I only see trees.

No, the trees are not changing locations, before anyone can ask in the comments.  They are only trees.  I’m just paranoid.

At least being mostly cognizant during class meant I didn’t scream and fall out of my seat when Professor L. burst in through the door.  Some people near me did, though.  I don’t blame them.  It is rather startling to be sitting there half asleep and then have a door slam into the wall like a gunshot.  But Professor L. didn’t notice that he’d just taken a couple years of life off half the students in the classroom.  He turned and slammed the door shut behind him, crumpling against it and sliding down underneath the window.  He craned his head back, peering up through the window.  He was staring at the hallway ceiling.

“Is… everything okay?” Professor Monotone ventured.

“I saw something,” Professor L. whispered.  “On the ceiling.”

Oh no.  Noooooo.  I quietly slumped further in my seat in the hopes that no one would notice the look of horror on my face.  I needn’t have worried.  Everyone was staring at Professor L as he cowered by the door, straining to see if he was still being followed by whatever was out there.

“Oh, did you finally see the resident ghost?” Professor Monotone asked.

“It was covered in… *stabbed* with… pieces of glass.”

Were they seriously having this conversation?  In front of the entire class?

A couple students giggled.  I glanced around covertly, taking note of the students that didn’t look amused.  About a third of them had grim or fearful expressions.  Honestly, more than I expected.

“Well, you’re welcome to stay here for a bit,” Professor Monotone said cheerfully.  “I’ve found that it’ll go away if you wait a little bit.”

Professor L. nodded mutely and staggered to his feet.  He went to the back of the room and sat down at an empty desk.  And Professor Monotone just… kept lecturing like nothing had happened.  Professors are wild, y’all.

Professor L. stayed until the end of class.  I’d resolved to go talk to him in his office immediately after and find out what had changed.  The obvious concern is that the piece of petrified wood is gone, because my whole theory hinges on it being what’s protecting him.  I needed to know, because if something had gone wrong with it, then I needed to warn Cassie.  Unfortunately, Professor L. ducked out of the classroom as soon as Professor Monotone started wrapping up.  I had to anxiously wait to find out what the assigned reading was, then I had to fight my way past all my classmates.  They were all talking about the ghost - sounded like I’m not the only one to have seen it at some point - and I desperately wanted to participate, but I didn’t want to lose Professor L. either.  I turned down the hallway towards the offices, hoping that I could catch Professor L. before he shut himself up inside.

I found his office door shut.  I knocked and after a moment I called out that it was me, Ashley, and I wanted to ask about the ghost.  I reminded him that I’d seen it before and that I might know something that could help him.  Then I waited in nervous silence.  I even put my ear against the door to see if I could hear him shuffling around in there.

Nothing.

He must have fled the building instead.  I regretted not staying behind to talk to the other students about the ghost.

Something touched my cheek.  I flinched and saw in the corner of my eye a hand, languidly stretching out its fingers.  Blood stained them in a thick, tacky layer, not dripping, but not quite dried either.

I didn’t move.  I stood there, staring straight at the locked door in front of me.  The hand hovered just at the edge of my field of vision and I slowly became aware of a noise behind me.  Breathing.  Soft, rasping breathing.  The hair on the back of my neck prickled.  The seconds stretched by, each beat of my heart feeling like an eternity of waiting.  Did I try to run?  Did I wait until it moved on?  Professor Monotone had said it would go away if you waited.

I closed my eyes and counted to twenty in my head.  When I opened my eyes again, I could no longer see its hand hovering by my cheek.  I began to shake, trembling violently like I was freezing in the snow.  I clenched my jaw to keep my teeth from chattering together.  It was gone.  It had to be gone.  I’d just turn around and walk out of here.  Stiffly, I unlocked my muscles, and turned around.

It was not gone.

It had just been waiting.

And now I was facing it, staring directly into the two big shards of glass that were thrust into its eye sockets.

I jerked backwards and came up hard against the office door.  It was standing directly in front of me now, its shoulders hunched high enough that they were even with the tips of its ears and its glass-covered face was thrust forwards towards mine.  The smell of blood was thick in the air and I swallowed hard, dizzy with fear and nausea.  I could make out the hollow spot where its nose had once been and the corner of a lip, but the rest was a ruin of tattered flesh and shining pieces of glass.

What did it want with me?  Why was it following me?  And why was it just standing here, inches away, doing nothing at all?

I edged my foot sideways, thinking to slip away from it.  Maybe it couldn’t see me.  But its head bobbed sideways too, following the movement.  I froze again.

Then, slowly, it raised a hand.  I pressed hard against the door behind me, as if I could force my body through the wood and escape that way.  But that was impossible and there was nowhere to go as its blood-stained fingers came closer and closer.  I could see tiny slivers of glass embedded in the knuckles, the fingertips, protruding from underneath the fingernails.

It touched my cheek again.  Right near the bridge of the nose, underneath the eye.  I felt the rasp of glass as it traced the contour of my cheek sideways.

I squeezed my eyes shut tight, because there was nowhere to go but inside myself, where I could drift away, far far away from what was happening to me.

“James,” a voice said sharply.

The touch vanished in an instant.  My eyes shot open.

Professor Monotone stood in the hallway, right behind the stabbed student.  He looked angry, his brow furrowed and his hands balled into fists.  It was the first time I’ve seen any kind of emotion on him.

“That’s enough, James,” the professor said.

And the ghost leapt for the ceiling.  It went straight up, landing on all fours and clinging to the ceiling panels like some kind of insect.  I stared at Professor Monotone, speechless, as he watched the ghost scuttle away and around the corner.  He sighed deeply once it was out of sight.

“Here,” he said gruffly.

He fished in a pocket and produced a handkerchief.  I didn’t even realize I was crying.  I mopped frantically at my face.  I had to calm down.  I had to stop breathing so fast.

“Y-you know who that is?” I gasped.

“Was,” Professor Monotone corrected with a sigh.  “He was a student here about ten years ago.  I was thinking of recommending him for the graduate program but he died shortly before graduation.”

“How did he die?” I whispered.

“I don’t know.  They never found the body and officially he’s just ‘missing’.  But then that ghost started showing up and the timing… the location… made me think it was James.”

It had reacted to the name.  I felt somewhat elated, or perhaps that was the adrenaline.  I had a name.  This was the first ghost on campus that I could confirm was definitely the ghost of a dead student and I had a name for them.

“I should go talk to Professor L.,” he mumbled.  “I wonder what changed.”

“T-there’s a stone he has,” I said.  “A piece of petrified wood.  Ask him if he still has it.”

Professor Monotone didn’t reply.  He looked at me for a moment with those tired eyes and then he walked away, leaving me clutching his handkerchief and trying to regain my composure before anyone else came down the corridor.

I hadn’t realized I’d been crying in the moment, but I think… when James reached for my face… he wasn’t trying to scare me.

He was wiping away a tear.

(also if anyone has ideas for getting Professor Monotone’s handkerchief back to him without it being super awkward and weird I would really appreciate it kthanks)[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
