I’m not home very often these days. I go to uni in the city and only really come back for weekends and the occasional work shift. Train’s cheap at least.



My brother and his girlfriend live with me and my parents. Thankfully the girlfriend was a friend of mine before she even met my brother, then they met on their own time and got together. It was around 1am when I was talking to them in the kitchen. My brother’s girlfriend bakes a lot and usually in the dead of night when my parents are long since in bed and I’m up late drawing.



It was during this conversation where I was licking a spoon she was finished with that I noticed one of the neighbour’s kitchen light was still on. I couldn’t see any other light on in the house and no one was in there. I would have been able to see them.



I asked my brother, who for the sake of the internet and his dismay I’ll call Clancy, if he had noticed that. He shrugged.



“Yeah, she’s had the light on since Wednesday. I think she has family around?”



“There was a car parked in the street entrance, and someone went around to her house.” Clancy’s girlfriend added and we moved back into whatever we were talking about at the time.



That would kind of explain it, leaving a light on for a person staying over. But when I got home the next week and the car was gone but the light was still on… I started getting worried. The lady who lives there is pretty pedantic. Not in a bad way, she’s just particular about a lot of things, like the park nearby and her own yard and home. I’ve never seen her leave lights on if it's just her staying there.



I just didn’t get a good feeling from it, especially since I hadn’t seen her recently, maybe once in three months. She’s out and about with that jack russell a lot, on walks or when she volunteers to clean up the parks in town which she brings her tabby cat to. She also comes into my work pretty frequently. 



I asked mum if she had seen the lady recently. They used to work at the same call center when my mum was getting her masters and they’re in a book club together. She hadn’t been to the last meeting without saying why.



It was until this week I saw her again. I’m home from uni for the weekend and I was going to work. I usually leave early to go past the super market and get a snack before work so I’m not hungry and distracted. 



The sun was setting, painting the gum trees and asphalt in deep oranges. I took a second to look up at the tall tree across the street before continuing to my car. When I looked down I saw her standing at the base of the trees, staring at the golden glow as it was beginning to dip behind the houses and trees. It hurt even trying to look at her.



She was a mess. A rats nest of hair was matted to her scalp, the pink work out top I was so used to seeing her in was stained in god knows what and her sweat pants had mud splashed up on them. Her clothing hung off her nearly skeletal form. Any muscle she had from all that walking and working out was gone, and the small fat percentage she had with it.



Worst of all was the smell. I thought it was the abattoir somehow, that the storm coming in had managed to drag it all the way to us, but it's all the way on the other side of town. I shouldn’t be able to smell it. But I refuse to believe it was somehow her, the putrid scent of death carried to me from 20 meters away in the wind.



I had dimly noticed a car pulling up into the free space by the gum trees. A woman got out, dressed nicely but not formally. The sound of her car door slamming shook me out of whatever state I was in. The woman rushed to my neighbour’s side and started gently pushing her towards her house. She went along with it without much fuss.



“Is everything alright?” I called, worried about a random person handling her.



“I’m her cousin,” The woman called back, “She’s not been well. I’m taking care of it, don't worry.”



With that she pushed my neighbour faster. Once they were out of sight I looked back to where she had been standing and saw a hole. Curiosity beckoned me forward and like a cat with a death wish I followed. 



The smell was coming from the hole. It got stronger as I got closer, nearly enough to make me throw up. Death and shit. Inside sat two small bodies, ones that I had seen out and about around town for a long time now.



Her jack russell and tabby cat curled in on each other, motionless. Decay had already taken its hold, which would explain the smell just not how strong it was. Even my shirt pulled up over my nose couldn’t protect me from it. They must have died like that, or one died first and the other clung to it where it perished as well. They had begun to decompose into each other. I grabbed a long stick from nearby and poked, they moved together. I stuck it under the dog and tried to lift it and they went up together.



I dropped the stick and scrambled back to my yard, after catching my breath for a second I went inside and told Clancy what I saw, he pulled on a set of runners and came out. By that point I had about 5 minutes to get to work so I had to run off, leaving him alone to somehow deal with the two dead bodies now decomposing in the yard of one of my other neighbours.



Jesus christ I mean kids live in that house. I couldn’t shake the horrifying image of the youngest leaving to go on a bike ride and seeing that in the morning, if the smell somehow didn’t bring out the whole area to see what it was. Which it might not have. Inside my house smelt normal.



I drove to work and barely got there in time. I took one sniff of my uniform to make sure I didn’t smell like whatever that was and didn’t. Thank god. Now I’m sitting behind the bar tapping this out as the show’s on in the theater. Clancy messaged me saying he buried it and the smell had disappeared. It was a shallow hole. He covered it up with bark and leaf litter before heading inside. He wants to do something more permanent about it in the morning. 



I suppose that’s it for now. I’ll post this when I get home probably. If anything else happens I’ll make an update post, but I’m not sure much will. Hope she’s getting the help she needs, because she seems not great.
