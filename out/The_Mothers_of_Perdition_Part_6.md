Part 5

I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building we found a secret room! And guess what was in it? More books! I even found a journal from Sean. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.


I still lived in New Brunswick. It was 2016.

I had lost my job at the call center I liked and went from job to job not really finding anything fulfilling. I was at the end of my ropes and didn't know what to do. I Still lived with my parents, but at least I had a car.

One night while I was sleeping I suddenly realized that I was. I was lucid dreaming. 

I drove along in a jeep along a dirt road and then, just turned it into a rocket ship and blasted off. 

I was flying around having a grand old time when all of a sudden a serpentine red dragon flew towards me across the horizon.

I turned and tried to fly away but he was gaining on me. I veered sideways and former a laser gun in my hands. 

We circled each other, I fired at him and breathed tendrils of fire at me. I dodged them at  first but took a hit eventually. The rocket was buzzing and whirring and I feared it might explode.

Then I saw the female angel from before flying in towards us.

'You can fly too' I heard in my head.

And then I just could and took off like she did.

We worked together blasting Saren and flanked him like a proper team.

We got him on the run and he flew away with his tale dangling.

The rest of the dream was really fun and I won't note it down.

When I woke up I heard her voice in my head 'Remember Kyle? He moved in just down the street right. That is a sign that you should see where he is at, and not that you need to be his friend. But there is something you need to understand. He is not your friend. But you need to pretend to be for a while. So please go spend time with him and do what I tell you.'


Kyle had moved into and apartment just down the street from my parents, and I did what she said, pretended to be his friend.

He lived with his girlfriend Kate and worked 2 jobs while he smoked meth instead of sleeping. At least that's what he said.

When I was over there I noted that he was playing on playstion 2 and only had 1 game GTA Sanandreas.

He complained constantly about how bad it was and how he wished he had more games and I thought little of it. 

Then I heard that woman's voice again 'Let him borrow all 20 of your PS2 games so he has something to do.'

I didn't really like that idea but none of them were worth anything and I didn't want to play them. So I let Kyle borrow my PS2 games and he played a lot of them.

He often asked me about tips and stuff since they were my games. I tried to stay away from there because he kept bad company but one day I heard the woman's voice tell me to go there and I did.

Kyle was there playing soul caliber 3 with Robbie, a druggy I avoided, and a man I had never seen before. He was huge, maybe like 6'10, and built like a tank.

"Who is this now?" the giant said with malice in his voice.

"Oh that's Sean" Kyle said, not looking away from the screen.

The giant took a hit of meth from the pipe. and looked at me.

"You look like the kind of person who knows his place, I'm not going to threaten you." He leaned back and smiled.

"Who's this?" I asked.

"This is Donald" Kyle stated. "He is a strong goyum. The bear goyum."

Donald looked at me "You know one time I found a panther in a bear trap. He was sitting there snarling at me and I just took a baseball bat and clubbed him to death. It was satisfying." He said with a grin.

He then pushed Robbie aside and took his turn at the game.

Robbie got too his feet and swept himself off. "I feel safer car shopping then I do here."

I knew what he meant, car shopping was when you looked for unlocked cars to steal from.

Then I heard the woman's voice again. 'Look at Donald with your third eye'

I listened and sat there trying to do it. I had heard about it online. After a while I saw him in the spirit world. He had a crown on his head.

Then I heard the woman again 'They are planning to kill you, look out the window right now or else.'

Donald screamed. He had beaten Kyle 21 times in a row and he was looking for fresh meat.

I went to the window and looked outside. To my astonishment I saw a ninja across the street.

"Hey there is a ninja there!" I pointed out.

Everyone went to look and the ninja started arguing. 

"It's a bush!" 

"No it's a ninja!"

They carried on and I heard the woman's voice. 'Take your games and get out of here right now'

I grabbed my games as they were still arguing and went for the door.

The last thing I heard as I left was Donald saying "Oh they're your games."

I went to my car and went home. When I looked through the box I saw that Kyle's direct deposit pay stub was also in  the box.

'Donald was planning to kill all three of you and take the games and Kyle's paycheck, but Kyle was also planning to kill you and only you, since they were both trying to screw you, and Donald was planning to screw Kyle, who was trying to help Donald. And you instant karma'd them. Look with your third eye. There is something extra.' The woman chimed with delight.

I looked with my third eye and I couldn't believe it. There was Donald's crown sitting on top of the box. I put it on and asked the woman's whose crown it was. She said it was Jesus's.

The voice would talk to me occasionally and told me to do things. She didn't seem very intent on telling me who she was at first but she eventually responded by saying that she was my wife, and that I needed to find her a body.

She gave me some elaborate explanation about souls and spirits, about how humans lack spirits and that since it's not her soul that its not weird.

After that she told me drive out to a boat landing one day and I saw the prettiest woman I had ever seen fighting with her boyfriend beside their yatch.

'She's certainly pretty enough, but does she have the right intentions. We must see.' my alleged wife said.

"How dare you cheat on me with my best friend! you awful whore how dare you!" the man slapped the woman.

She looked at him and yelled "I'd rather sleep with him than you!"

He looked at me in a rage "I've keelhauled tougher men than him on my yatch while you sat there laughing! You think that punk is good enough for you?"

She acted like a wounded dove and said "He's heard too much we need to deal with him."

The man pulled out a pistol and said "Hands up"

I put my hands up and they lead me to their yatch. We got on and drove out into the lake. Once we stopped the woman spoke up.

"I'm so glad we just found someone too take our aggression out on." She said laughing.

They both looked at me with the most heinous looks on their faces.

"Do you want to be keelhauled or something special?" The man said laughing uncontrollably.

He put the gun down and picked up a knife.

"We like to roleplay joker and Harley Quinn, while we do this. It's so in these days." He said and quoted the dark night many times.

He started skinning me and I felt absolutely nothing. He was expecting me to scream but I just didn't feel the need too.

After a while I just started laughing uncontrollably and didn't stop. After a while he started loosing his cool. He looked to his wife in shame.

"It's supposed to be real bad luck when this happens, I'm telling you hun. They say god did this to Jesus on the cross when he was crucified. Nullified all his pain." The man said concern.

They through my body in the lake and I thought I would drown. But instead my wounds were healed and I popped out of the water like a cork. I stood on the calm surface of the water and looked at the mostly set sun.

I then heard a male voice that spoke with power and authority.

'Just this once because you got the crown. Next time you'll have to earn it.' it said to me. 'Take this as a sign of faith that I can and will get you through everything. I can make you walk on water, see in the dark, and phase through walls and that's only the beginning.'

I walked along the surface to the shore and saw what looked like a Satanic cult gathering around a large fire. They had numerous people tied to stakes with bags over their heads.

'When you see things like this, they always point the finger at Satan like he's the problem. But I assure you, these are red dragon worshipers and I want you to see what they do to people for fun' the voice said.

It was starting to get dark and I watched from the surface of the water.

The people were splayed out and tied down. They took wand knives and stabbed them over and over again.

'What are they doing? Why are you making me watch this? Why are you doing this to me?' I cried in my head.

'I want you to know why we are not redeeming this world right up front. It is not a priority. These people do not seek to kill, but to take the gift of reincarnation from one another. They wish to act out my role in a way that is not only malicious, but devoid of even revenge. These people do this because they like it, or they wouldn't still be down here. I want you to know that even if you get wand knifed, I am in control, and I decide who goes to out darkness. Not these people.' The voice monologued.

Just then once of the people noticed me and a bunch tried to run out to me. When they got above their heads they started swimming towards me.

I walked over to them and started playing whack a mole with their heads.

Some of them got into a speed boat after they realized what was happening and came driving at me.

I ran from the shore into the woods and was lost in the dark before long.

The voice said 'See, these people don't want a savior, they want a martyr. Do not let them get you like they did to Jesus'

Just then a cartoon version or reality appeared to me. There was a purple tint but I could see perfectly.

I saw multiple cultists running through the woods looking for me. They seemed blind as bats as I slipped by them.

I feared being surrounded because of how many of them there were and they just seemed to keep coming.

Before long I was surrounded and they grabbed me and took me back to their altar. They tied me down and took a wand knife out. 

I screamed and pleaded for my life but they just laughed, they thought it was funny that I was even trying to beg for my life.

"Yeah 3 days of darkness, but how do we know your the last savior? I bet when the sun comes up the sky will still be blue, it won't be red!" One of them screamed.

He was about to stab me in the root chakura when I appeared back at my car. I was in utter disbelief at what happened. I was back to seeing with my regular eyes too. My car keys were on the windshield.


'Take this as a sign of faith' I heard the voice say.


'Who are you?' I said.


'I am Yahweh' It responded.



I am a monk who lives at a monastery in rural tennessee. I wrote the preceding story when  Julius Caesar's wife told me that if I did not, that I would be sent to the lake of fire. I have written this here so please God have mercy on my soul!
