*December 12, 2023*

Have you ever touched a doorknob after walking across a carpeted room in your socks?  You know that static shock you get, that makes you wince as you quickly withdraw your hand?  How it makes you hesitate to reach back out for the doorknob, in fear that you will get shocked again?


Imagine that — but instead of a superficial shock that makes your hand tingle, it instead makes your soul tingle.  That’s the only way I can describe what it was like when I picked up the journal I found in my attic.


What’s it feel like to have your soul tingle?  Honestly, unless you’ve experienced it for yourself, there aren’t words that can describe it.  The only advice I can offer on the matter is that you’d better hope you never have to feel it.
I suppose there is one more piece of advice I can offer.  Sometimes, things are better left undisturbed.  As tempting as it may be, some things aren’t meant to be revisited.  I found out the hard way.


It started last week.  Well, it will be one week ago tomorrow, if I manage to survive that long.  While cleaning out the attic of my grandmother’s home that for some godforsaken reason she left to me, I found an old journal.  It was nestled in between mounds of junk — old pieces of mail, dirty rags, and moldy boxes — the stuff that for some reason old people keep because one day they may need it again.  Fun fact: they never do.
At first, I nearly tossed it in the industrial sized garbage bag along with the rest of the papers that were covered in mildew.  I just wanted to be done and out of the attic, where the cobwebs were thick enough to snag a bear, and the air was redolent with the smell of long deceased mice and mold.  Jesus — I really should have worn a mask.  Not that it matters anymore.  I imagine I’ll be long dead before I have to worry about the asbestos or the mold spores or diseased mice getting me.  Sorry, I know I ramble sometimes — especially when I’m stressed.  You could say I’m quite stressed right now.


Anyway, after pulling several damp cloths off the pile of never-ending junk, I saw what I first thought was an old book.  I guess I was right, in a way.  Remember the static shock I started this entry with?  I hope so, it wasn’t all that long ago.  Sorry, I don’t mean to be sarcastic.  Back to the story.


So, as I grabbed the grungy, leather cover, I felt that shock.  Though it was different.  Deep, even.  Not deep like “it travelled through my body and hit my heart” deep, deeper.  All I can say is it felt as though my soul was shocked.  For a second, I wasn’t sure I had experienced it at all.  It was an ethereal feeling more than a physical one.


Needless to say, I jerked my hand away quicker than I thought possible, smacking it into a rough, splintering support beam just to my right.  As I cursed at myself and shook the pain out of my hand, I peered through the dim light, looking closer at the journal.  


At first, it didn’t appear special in the slightest.  A simple, maroon leather cover with no writing.  The leather was cracked and stained from God-knows-how-long of mistreatment.  As I looked from the side of it, checking how thick the journal was, I could see the yellowed pages, wavy with moisture and speckled with mold.  I was tempted to toss it, as it was obviously in sore condition, but something stopped me.  I guess it was the worry that maybe it was my grandmother’s, who I loved dearly, and maybe I’d get some introspection into her life long before I knew her.  God, how I wish I just tossed the thing.


I cleaned up the rest of the trash pile and heaved the now heavy (and quite sodden) garbage bag back out of the hatchway to the attic, listening to it hit the floor below with a solid *Thunk!*  I winced slightly, worrying I dented the gorgeous mahogany floors.
Did I mention I get distracted easily?  In my haste to get out of the nasty attic, I began descending the ladder, carefully placing my weight to the edges of the wooden rungs, afraid that I’d go right through them if I stepped too heavily in the middle.  As I reached up to pull the drawstring on the singular, low-wattage bulb, I remembered the journal, and quickly scrambled back to get it.


Gingerly, I touched the cover again.  This time, no shock.  It seemed like a very ordinary albeit quite gross, journal.


Tucking it under my arm, I once again carefully made my way down the ladder, before gently folding it up, and raising the hatch to seal off the disaster that was the attic.
I remember standing under the hatch on the third story landing, staring at the garbage bag.  I picked it up and was about to haul it down the stairs and take it outside when I heard the rain pelting the large picture window that looked out over the front yard.  Not tonight I told myself.  


I considered going back to my apartment, but honestly, the place was a dump, so instead, I plopped myself down on my grandma’s red-velvet love seat.  It may have been from the sixties, and left a lot to be desired aesthetically speaking, but I’ll be damned if it wasn’t incredibly soft.


Spinning the knob on the small lamp beside the loveseat, it flickered to life, bathing the room in a comfortable, warm yellow light.  I kicked my feet up on the coffee table (something she would have killed me for, if she saw what I was doing), and plopped the damn journal down in my lap.  I stared at it for several minutes.  I don’t know if it was some sixth sense.  Maybe the journal was giving me a message.  Maybe my grandma was.  Who knows?  For whatever reason, it seemed like a Herculean task for me to flip open that cover.


Finally I did.  Of course, the second I was about to read the first line, the lamp crackled, and the bulb burnt out.  Dammit, I thought to myself. This whole house is going to be one project after another. Of course, I put it up to the fact that about everything in the house was fifty years past it’s prime.  I had no idea how wrong I was.


I felt a cold chill run down my neck, and then quickly berated myself for still being afraid of the dark.  I knew there were no such things as ghosts and ghouls — at least, I thought I did.
Being the lazy person I am, I decided getting up to turn on the main set of lights in the living room was a bit too much effort.  After chucking both of my shoes at the light switch on the far wall and missing, I decided I’d just use the light on my phone to check out the book.


The handwriting was a style that I did not recognize.  It was elegant and flowing, but not like my grandmother’s.  It was old, too.  The ink had begun to fade in spots, but was legible regardless.  Though I had to admit, the elegant writing was hard to decipher at times.  I just chalked that up to me being too Gen Z to understand “old fogey” writing.  I started on the first page, as one does.


*December 09, 1927.*
*My name is Eugene.  Please know that I am not insane.  I had wished it would never come to this, however now I feel my only course of action is to tell of my experience.  To warn the future generations.  I am unsure if writing this down is a good idea.  I am even less sure that you should continue reading this.  Once you know about them — they stop hiding.  They will come for you as they have come for me.  Please, God, forgive me for I have sinned.  I pray that thee will still accept me to thy golden paradise.  They come ever closer.  The whispers, they are becoming unbearable.  They started slowly, quietly, to the point that I wasn’t sure I had heard anything.  Now they are loud. So loud.*


The cold chill hit me once again.  I may be a fan of the horror genre, but sitting alone in the massive house, with just the light from my phone casting strange shadows on the outdated wallpaper and mustard-yellow shag rug, the heavy wind whistling against the rugged siding, I can honestly say that I was a bit freaked.


I reread the name again.  Eugene.  I couldn’t place it immediately — however it rang a bell somewhere deep in my mind.  Suddenly I could remember.  My dad told me stories when I was young.  He said that his great-uncle, Gene (which I’m guessing is short for Eugene), had gone missing long before he was born.  He knew very little about him.  My grandmother talked about him even less.  It was only when at a family reunion when he was in his thirties did he talk with a distant cousin who told him that there were rumors that my grandmother’s uncle had ended up in the looney bin down in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  He said he had tried finding records of a man by that name in any of the asylums there, but nothing ever came of it.  He stopped searching when there was no more leads.


As much as I wanted to just close the book and maybe wait until daylight, I decided to steady on.


*December 11, 1927.*
*The voices are all consuming now.  They tell me it’s okay to let go.  It is okay to listen to them.  I don’t have to fight them anymore and I don’t have to be scared.  I don’t think I’m scared of them.  I think they want to help me.  I am scared of the figure who watches me sleep at night.  He scares me.  Not because I don’t know who he is.  He scares me because he has no face.  It’s just an endlessly dark void.  It feels as though he wants to drain my very being.  The voices tell me not to be afraid of him, either.  But I am not sure they are correct.  I don’t think I will listen to them.*


Okay - if the first one was creepy, this entry really got me.  It didn’t help that the fleeting flashes of lightning from the storm outside continued lighting up the room, causing irregular shadows to dance on the wall.  I decided I wasn’t all that lazy, and maybe I could stand, walking the six steps it would take to reach the light switch.


With a reassuring *clack!* The lights popped on, immediately relieving the heavy sense of despair that the dark gloom was setting on me.  Now that the lights were on, my bravery returned, I felt I could breathe.  My heart rate slowed, and I soldiered on.


*December 14, 1927.*
*The shadow man comes each night now.  He used to show himself every other day, and only once or twice when I woke at night.  Now he spends the entire night, disappearing only as the light filters in through the curtains as dawn breaks.  He doesn’t speak.  The whispers have stopped as well.  They were comforting.  They told me I was okay.  Now, he just stares at me.  The empty void, pulling at the strings of my soul.  I wish I could see his eyes.  They say you can tell a lot from a man’s eyes.  I can’t tell anything from the void.*


I couldn’t tell whether I should be feeling scared, or sad for Eugene.  It was clear he was having a mental break.  It really does seem as if our distant cousin was right about him.  Now, they have medications for this kind of thing.  What is it? Schizophrenia or something?  Who knows.  But back then, they’d toss you into an asylum and basically torture you.  There’s a reason they shut them all down.


As spooked as I was, I felt a strange compulsion to continue reading.  Just as I was about to flip the page, a larger than usual bolt of lightning hit somewhere close by, shaking the house with the thunder that followed it near instantaneously.  I nearly jumped out of my skin, only to laugh at myself.  Wow, I couldn’t believe how the writings of a mentally ill man were affecting me so badly.


*December 16, 1927.*
*They call me names.  Crazy. Looney.  Unstable.  Even Shelly, the one who has been by my side, who fought tooth and nail for me, wants me to see a doctor.  I haven’t slept the last two nights, and I think it’s getting to me.  The whispers have come back, but they’re not as friendly as they were.  They tell me awful things.  They tell me to do even worse things.  They say it will make him happy.  Him.  I’m not so sure that shadow man is a him.  It’s too different from people.  People have a face.  He just has a void.  Darker than the darkest night.  I fear that even if I were to shine a beam at him, the light would be swallowed.  Swallowed by that awful void.*


Shelly, I knew, was my grandmother.  I did some quick math in my head and realized that in December of 1927 she would have been around fourteen.  I don’t know how old Eugene was, it’s odd that he would have to be defended by a fourteen year old.  And even she was starting to think he had issues.  Poor guy.  I flipped to the next page.


*December 21, 1927.*
*It’s been several days.  I’m starting to fall asleep even while standing.  The incessant whispering is driving me to the edge.  I don’t want to do what they’re telling me to do.  I could never hurt them.  I want the shadow man to leave me alone.  He comes at night now, even as I stay awake.  He doesn’t come too close, but he’s always there.  Always watching.  He doesn’t speak.  But the whispers do.  They say I’m cursed.  They say that the family is cursed.  They say that they will only get stronger unless I do it.  But I can’t hurt my family.  No.  I won’t.  How do I know this isn’t all in my head?  It’s not.  The voices say it isn’t.  God, forgive me.  God, please, allow me to come home.  I’m afraid.*


All I could think about was the Amityville massacre.  What were the voices in his head telling him to do?  I wasn’t sure I wanted to know.  He said that he couldn’t hurt his family.  I know for a fact he hadn’t, as I wouldn’t be here if he massacred everyone.  He just… disappeared, the only one to fall victim to the voices in his head, thank God.  There’s something horribly uncomfortable about reading someone’s mental decline, in their own writing.  It’s like you are in their head.  As much as I didn’t want to, I felt the urge to see this through.  I read the next entry.


*December 22, 1927.*
*Christmas is coming shortly.  How I love this time of year.  The family gathers, we sing carols, give praise to the baby Jesus, his mother Mary, and those who brought him gifts in the manger where he was born.  It’s a glorious time of year, filled with warmth, love and peace.  I heard Genie is coming to dinner this year.  I am so glad, we have not seen her since she left for the city.  I hope the shadow man let’s me stay so I can see her.  He says the time is coming to make my move.  If I don’t — well, he says it won’t work out well for me.  Not that he actually speaks.  It’s more of a feeling he sheds. The only sound that comes from him is this cosmic, earth-shattering roar.  It seems I’m the only one who can hear it.  Oh well, he hasn’t hurt me yet, I doubt he will.  I don’t know why he comes to visit me.  Maybe he is the ghost of Christmas to come, as Mr. Dickens once wrote.  He sure does talk about the future a lot.  He talks about the youngins.  He says that should I fail, they will suffer.  I’ve not heard some of the names he mentions, he may have the wrong man after all.  Who is Caleb?  I don’t think I’ve made his acquaintance.*


I dropped the book as I read the final few lines.  My name is Caleb.  I was born in 1997, seventy years after this entry.  He couldn’t be talking about me.  The beginning of the entry was so good.  He seemed normal.  Then he spiraled again.  But my eyes flicked back to my name.  I was aware I was shivering.  The house was drafty, sure, but the fire I had going in the fireplace should have been more than enough to thaw me out.  I knew I was trying to put on a brave face, to tell myself that I was shivering from the cold.  I wasn’t.  I was scared.  I told myself how ridiculous it all was, but a worm of doubt in the back of my mind wouldn’t let me let it all go.  


*December 22, 1927.*
*Or maybe it’s the 23rd of December, now?  Who am I to say?  It’s late night.  I’m so very tired.  I don’t want to sleep.  If I do, I’m not sure I’ll wake up.  I don’t want to die.  How I wish I could warn them.*


Two entries in one day.  That was a first.  That one was eerie, but it just seemed like the man was losing his battle with his mental health.  He didn’t speak of supernatural forces, of faceless monsters.  


*December 23, 1927.*
*I did it.  I survived the night. I even got some sleep, though I knew it was there.  He spoke to me in that way he speaks that isn’t really speaking at all.  He told me that once I knew about them, there was nothing I could do to stop them.  He told me that as time passes, he becomes stronger.  Without anyone to stop him, he will be everlasting.  What does he mean?  Maybe he is God.  Maybe he is Satan.  Who am I to say?  I am just a crazy codger according to everyone else.  Maybe I am crazy.  That would be an acceptable scenario.  If I’m not, the world is a far more terrifying place than I could have imagined.  Maybe there is no God.  God wouldn’t allow one of his faithful to bare such a horrible fate.  God wouldn’t allow my flesh and blood to face this same fate.  I question it all.  Merry Christmas.*


He’s insane, I told myself.  That’s the only option.  There’s no way I could have gone my entire twenty-five years without hearing about this.  Not if he had done something nuts.  But I had to see more.  I hated myself for continuing.  It was like a bad car accident.  You don’t want to watch it, but you can’t look away.


*Dbre 2444.*
*Holp li torrea.  Mv ca sw. m.*


That was it.  The last entry.  I flicked through the rest of the pages, tearing a few as I went.  But nothing else was in the book.  The journal ended on that last entry, totally illegible.  The man finally lost it.  I felt a deep sense of sadness, as if a part of me had left with that final entry.  A tortured mind — that’s all.  God, how awful.  In the back of my mind, however, I couldn’t just pass this off as a mental episode.  If it was, I’m sure I would have heard about this.  
I gently placed the journal on the coffee table.  It made my skin prickle to look at, but I felt a sense of sorrow for the man, Eugene, whoever he may be.  I suppose he’s my great-great uncle.  I hope he found peace.


With a need to get my mind off the journal, I opened up my phone and scrolled social media for an hour or so, eventually drifting off to sleep.  The thunder had quieted, and the gentle crackling of the fire had me serenaded to a peaceful sleep.


You know how when you fall asleep super fast, and you have those dreams that you’re climbing a stair or a ladder and misstep, causing you to start awake as if you just were about to fall to your death?  That’s how I woke, but it wasn’t from a falling dream.  I swore I heard someone call my name.  Barely audible, as if someone had just gently breathed it into my ear.


I rubbed my eyes and squinted at my phone.  The screen was still awake, so I must have dozed for just a few seconds.  I had no idea what time I fell asleep, but since the time only showed 9:47, it surely hadn’t been long at all.  After all, I finished with the attic at around 8:30, read the journal, and then doom-scrolled for a while.  I shrugged off the disconcerting feeling that slowly wriggled beneath my skin.  Get ahold of yourself, idiot!  It was just the ramblings of an old, sick man. To be fair, I didn’t know if Eugene was old.  I just kind of assumed everyone was old in the black and white days.
Despite telling myself I wasn’t scared, I found it hard to convince myself not to run out to my car and head back to my grungy apartment.  The house, my house now, technically, was far nicer, even if the decor needed modernizing.  I decided I’d keep the loveseat, though.  This thing was like floating on a cloud.


Eventually I drifted back off to sleep, waking only when the sun broke its way above the horizon, sending shafts of orange light directly into my closed eyes.  


As I rubbed the sleep from them and sat up, thinking about covering my head with a pillow and going back to sleep, I heard it.  


*Caleb!* 


Okay.  This time I definitely heard it.  I was awake, I knew that much for sure.  Surely I was just hallucinating because I still had the journal weighing heavily on my mind.


 *Don’t ignore us.*


“What the hell?!”.  Yes, I actually screamed that aloud.  The whisper was more audible now.  I could make out the words clearly.  The even more terrifying thing was that it wasn’t a single voice.  It hissed, sounding as though it echoed off hundreds of walls all simultaneously.


*You know. Now you hear.  Then you see.*


My first instinct was to get outside.  There wasn’t a hair on my body that wasn’t standing on end.  I’ve been scared before.  A lot, actually.  But this — this was not fear like I had ever felt.  I wanted to scream, throw up, cry, and possibly even urinate, all at the same time.  I realized in that moment it was not possible for a person to die of fear, because if it was, I wouldn’t be writing this now.


I bolted through the living room, out through the kitchen into the entryway, leaving my shoes and phone behind.  I had my keys, and that was all that mattered.  As I went to rip the door open and make my escape, they spoke again.


*Don’t you want to help Eugene?*


The voice or voices or whatever the hell it/they were, was now clear as day.  While it still held that terrifying tone, it sounded sad.  Don’t get me wrong, I was terrified.  I think I actually did piss a little bit.  But I felt a wave a sadness wash over me.  Eugene did need my help.


*Good.*


What the hell was I thinking?  I couldn’t help Eugene.  He’s probably been dead forty years!  If not since 1927!


*Stay.  You couldn’t leave, not even if you wanted to.  But you don’t, do you?*


I abso-fucking-lutely did want to leave.  But… I didn’t?  The whispers - as creepy sounding as they may have been, they weren’t threatening.  I suddenly wasn’t sure whether it was all in my head or not.  They sure sounded real.  They almost had a weight to them.


*Thank you, Caleb.  You’re making a good decision.*


I might have been hearing voices.  After all, I heard Schizophrenia can run in families.  Maybe just reading his mental journey kicked it off in me?  I also heard it can start in your twenties.  The thought of it terrified me, but some part of me also shrugged it off.  If it is, it is — that part of me said.


Instead of leaving like my primal instinct originally had me attempt, confidence surged in me.  I found a new energy to clean.  I spent the day clearing out the garage, the pantry, and ripped up the old linoleum in the guest bathroom.  By the end of the day, I was whipped.


The voices came and went.  They never said anything too concerning, more so just narrated what I was doing.  By the end of the day, I found them kind of cool.  They were my own personal sports narrator.  My thoughts drifted back to the journal — how Eugene had become comfortable with the voices as well.   Was this all in my head?  Was it all in Eugene’s?


My grandmother had no TV.  So I curled back up on the loveseat, much more relaxed than I had been the night previously.  I woke my phone screen to see several texts from my mom, wondering if everything was going alright at the house.  I texted her back that, yes, all was good, and progress was being made faster than I thought.  I could probably move in full-time within a few weeks.  She didn’t reply, but seeing as it was 10 o’clock, I wasn’t shocked.  She was always in bed early.


Once again, I scrolled the socials before drifting off to sleep.  I woke at some point in the night, feeling a chill.  I had never lit the fireplace, I realized vaguely.  I reached over the back of the couch to the wicker basket where my grandmother had kept some blankets, and pulled one over me, tucking it all the way up to my chin.  As I got comfy, I turned my head to the side.  I was about to let my eyes slip back shut when instead I was gripped by that unbelievable fear once more.  I saw a dark pair of legs, standing not six feet from me.  I didn’t want to look up.  I didn’t want to confirm what I had thought deep in my mind.  My eyes didn’t listen.


As I scanned slowly up the figure, there wasn’t much to see other than a vague outline.  No more than a shadow.  Until I reached his face.  What should have been his face, that is.
There is no way I can truly explain what I saw.  Eugene possibly said it best.  It was a void — not black. Not dark.  It was the absence of light.  It’s something that you just have to see to understand.


I couldn’t scream, though I know I sure wanted to.  There was something so utterly unnatural about it.  It inspired a primal fear so deep, I once again am without words to describe it.  I just pray you never feel such an emotion.  I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.  I was undoubtedly awake.  I know that because I dug my nails into my palm, trying to wake myself from the nightmare.   I clenched my fists so hard, blood welled from the small, half-moon shaped slices. 


Eventually, the intensity of the fear wore down my reserves of energy, and I passed out into a fitful, dreamless sleep.  Waking up every so often, terrified the figure would be there.  He wasn’t.  Not that night.  But he came again.  The one thing that was there, were the gouges in my palm.  I know now I was not sleeping.  


The next few days went much the same.  Whispers during the day.  Never angry, never violent.  They never egged me on to do anything horrible.  They just spoke to me.  They became a constant presence, one I was okay with.


The shadow man came back, too.  He still terrified me.  Each night, he seemed to stay longer and longer.  It was the night before last that I remembered something I had seen on TikTok — Schizophrenics would take photos on their phone, making sure the person talking to them showed up in the photos.  Deep down I knew I wasn’t schizophrenic.  But I had to try.  The figure stood there, stock still, as I snapped a photo.  Even in the dim light, not willing to risk using my flash, there was no doubt he was there. Now it was real.  I sent a mental apology to Eugene, saying I believed he wasn’t crazy.  I’m sure he didn’t receive it, wherever he was, but it felt like the right thing to do.  


It was last night, night number six, that he finally spoke.  I now know what Eugene meant, when he said it wasn’t really speaking.  I don’t know how the sound didn’t deafen me.  How it didn’t blow the windows out or collapse the house.  Something tells me it wasn’t an audible sound.  It was spiritual.  It was only between me and… *It*.


He told me to go back to the journal — so I did.  I found myself drawn to the passages where Eugene spoke about how the future would be worse.  I think he was truly talking about me.  It’s as if reading about it, as if knowing about this… thing… allowed it to be released.


As I relate my own experiences to Eugene’s, it seems I’m progressing (if you can call it that) faster than he did.  My process seems to be quicker.  His lasted fifteen days.  For me, it’s been six.  I can’t imagine how much longer before I disappear too.


The shadow stays with me most of the day now.  He leaves only for short times.  I guess he doesn’t need the dark to exist — maybe he is the dark.  Who knows for sure?


I do know that he still talks.  That horrible, soul-rending “voice”.  He tells me to do things.  I won’t do them, I couldn’t.  I am following one of his orders, though.  I’m finishing the journal that Eugene started.


I broke my phone the night before last — I got mad. It all felt so unfair.  I spiked it against the gorgeous mahogany floors that I used to worry so much about keeping in good shape.  I guess I should thank Grandma for having an old scanner hooked up to a mid 2000’s PC that still runs Windows XP.   At least I can get my story out.  


I’m sorry if you’re reading this.  I really didn’t want to pass him on.  Unfortunately, it’s too late now.  The seal was broken, and they’ll come for you too.  I’ll have seven, maybe eight days.  If this happens for you the way it did me.  If this whole damned process speeds up every iteration, I’m sorry to say it won’t take long.  Take that as comfort, though.  The sleep deprivation sucks.  The constant terror is not fun either.  The voices are comforting, though.  They’ll keep you company.  Just don’t let them goad you into doing anything you’d regret.


I should get on with my tasks for today.  I’ll be gone tomorrow, I’m sure, but I can make progress on the house before then.


He’s watching me again.  He’s in the corner, just off to my left.  He hasn’t spoken in the last few minutes.  That’s good, right?

God, I know I don’t talk to you often enough, or really ever for that matter.  But if you’re out there, bring me home.  I want to go home.
