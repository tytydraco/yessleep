i used to work for the NSA. in recent years it has been well established thanks to whistleblowers that they are quite unethical and run surveillance programs. virtually no device we use today is safe from them. anything can be accessed by them, even linux devices (we were able to add backdoors to linux too, so even if it is a huawei or chinese device, we can access it. ill not get into how we did it, maybe some other day)

one of the biggest problems NSA faces are whisteblowers. edward snowden, and the likes. this is why the entire organisation is heavily compartmentalised. you aren't even allowed to talk or associate with employees from other departments. people are moved to entirely secret facilities/offices all the time. they have been able to protect a lot of information from being leaked but it remains a risk.

what if there was a way to detect whistleblowers before they leaked information? they already have the tools to monitor anyone, after all. thus, project ELI (Espionage Liability Initiative) was born. I was assigned to the ELI team as one of its chief architects. It sounded extremely morbid to work on this project, but someone had to do it, and I didn't mind working on such a fun, bleeding edge project.

soon, we were able to create a working Proof of context. the simulations were so promising that it was allowed to be adopted in batches and was eventually rolled out to the entire organisation within a few years. it would likely take more years but the snowden incident made it very important to be released as soon as possible.

ELI analyses you by every attribute imaginable, the time you turn up to office, your behaviour, body language, even dietary habits.

if ELI flags that you are currently going to leak information, but has low confidence, it will simply alert NSA ahead of time. this is category A.

if it detects possibility with medium level of confidence with low time remaining, it will step in - modify your/receiver call voice, give wrong instructions from maps, essentially to gaslight you/"buy time" before you can be dettered by field agents. this is category B.

however, for situations where there is no time left with extremely high confidence, it WILL do everything to stop you - fail your breaks, explode your phone, do anything to harm you/eliminate/disable you when the former routes fail. this is kept as a fail safe and never likely to happen. this is category 0. no operator approval is needed.

if ELI existed during edward snowden's time, he would be marked category A or at most B. Category 0 is for extreme situations, suppose you are leaking top NSA secrets to North Korea, for example. even if you leak some of the lower level information to N Korea, most likely it would enforce a stronger version of B.

Eventually, after my work on ELI, I grew increasingly sad to the point of being depressed. at the time i was very excited to work for my country, with bleeding edge spy tech. i guess it always chipped me slowly but my enthusiasm simply hid it. It was enough and I decided it is best if I retire from that line of work.

Now years later, it is trying to kill me.

It started from very minor things. Maps giving me wrong directions - making me end up in a totally different destination than the one I had set. phone battery dying too fast/charging too slow. By now I had forgotten about ELI entirely, it was at the back of my mind. I just chalked it up to my phone being old, yet the same thing happend with it. I guess this is how they make them nowadays. 

Then it turned for the worse. I get a call from a friend from high school whom I haven't been in touch with for years. We agree to meet up. On the road, I narrowly miss a car accident with a semi-truck. Its brakes had failed. 

I reached my friend to let them know that I will have to postpone it, and they tell that we never decided to meet at all.

the last one was a trigger that made me realise what grave situation i am in. ELI flagged me. but since i no longer work for the NSA, and don't possess any confidential documents, no agent will apprehend me. it has been more than half a decade since I worked at NSA, and I never really had many friends. the ones i did had no clue about ELI. I still reached them out, detailing the events and told them ELI may have flagged me falsely. Like typical bureaucracy, they dismissed that something like ELI even existed. 

Now I am lost and have to turn to online forums. please help me out of this.
