It was a few months after I graduated college and I still couldn’t find work. I tried everything. I signed up for all the job finding apps and spent days perfecting my resume. I even cold called anywhere I could think of— offices, factories, McDonald’s, you name it. That’s why I was so thrilled when I got a call from a little startup company saying they’d love to interview me. 

The woman on the phone asked me when I was available, and in a state of euphoria, I told her I could come anytime, even right then. She seemed to really like my “ambition”, although I wouldn’t call it that, it was desperation. At that time, I lived in Jamaica, Queens (with my parents, of course), and the office she told me to meet her at was in Manhattan. 
 
I immediately shoved my suit on and grabbed my resume. I rushed to the nearest LIRR station to meet a lady whose name I didn’t even know yet. I sat through the train ride rehearsing what I’d say as my worn shoes stuck to the gummed up floor. I ignored the hissing of the engine and listened intently until I heard, “next station is Penn Station, as you leave the train please step over the gap between the train and the platform,”.
 
The office made me feel like I was walking into a hospital lobby; it was very sterile with its pale walls. There were six other people there hammering away at their computers, it smelled of cleaning products, and the fluorescent lights hummed and flickered. 
 
A tall, clean-cut man with his head held high led me to a backroom. He told me she’d be here soon, I assumed she was in a meeting or something. I plopped myself down in a spinny chair with wheels and fought the urge to swivel in it. 
 
When she finally arrived I began to feel ill. The office walls seemed to whirl and my gut dropped. I wanted to run as a deep sense of animalistic fear consumed my body. I shrugged it off. It was just nerves, it had to be, right?
 
She did something I now find kinda odd, she took the chair from the other side of the desk and placed it right next to mine. Besides that, the interview went decently.  She asked me all the formulaic questions, “Tell me about yourself” (I’m a hard worker), “Why should we hire you?” (I’d take a bullet to get a sale), and the grand finale, “What’s your greatest weakness?” (I’m a perfectionist). 
 
“I really need to know something,” She discreetly eyed the top of my resume. “... Jude,”
 
“Yes?” I tried my best to make eye contact, they always tell you that’s important in interviews.
 
“What’s most important to you?” She leaned towards me, it was almost 5PM and her lipstick was mostly weathered away.
 
“Hard work, ambition, dedication, team-” My spiel was cut off.
 
“Okay,” she sighed. “So that’s all just bullshit you’re saying, right?” 
 
I kinda just hesitantly nodded as she took a moment to push the brown hair out of her face. She was no older than 30, decked out in a black cardigan, dangly earrings, and boots that looked like high heels.
 
“Why are you here, and don’t tell me it’s because you respect the company or wanna be a team player,” She scooted her chair closer to mine, our wheels were *touching*. 
 
“I want money,” I confessed. I felt guilty for some reason, as if it were some big secret employers didn't know.
 
“For what?” she began to shiver a little bit.
 
“You know, the usual,” I tried my best to wipe the sweat off my forehead in a not-so-obvious way. She noticed. “Rent, food, gas,”
 
She leaned in more as if to say, ‘Hmm, what else?’
 
“Nice shoes, trips to fancy restaurants, maybe a new laptop,” I was under a spell of my own excited delirium. “Designer clothes, a car that doesn’t break down every week, an apartment that overlooks the skyline, expensive champagne (I didn’t know any brands),”
 
“Would you invest? Maybe save a little for the future.” Then she squinted her eyes. “Donate to charity?”
 
“Fuck no,” the words dropped out of my mouth in some form of automation. 
 
“Come back on Friday,” she said, wearing a shit eating grin. “6 in the morning,”
 
So there I was, three days later, marching through the midtown crowds with my bleach-stained suit and a briefcase (I didn’t need one, but I bought one). I passed by one of those little food trucks and bought a couple of water bottles. It was going to be a long day.
 
I felt a foreign sense of importance even though my job title was only ‘Bargain Specialist’, which I guessed was professional speak for ‘Pencil Pusher’. 
 
I stomped into the sterile world of menial office work, adjusting my stiff sleeves as an old woman screamed at someone on the phone and some guy gulped down chips at his desk.
 
“This is Luke, he’s going to be training you,” It was the same clean-cut man I barely met on the day of my interview. I think he was a manager.
 
“Hey, I’m Jude,” I said, offering a handshake. He pretended not to see.
 
“Alright, so there’s a lot to learn here,” he sped walked past the cubicles, his body language signaling me to follow.
 
“Great, I’m excited to learn,” I was still in that stage of trying to act like I was really ready to be a great worker. It’d last for a month. Tops.
 
“Heh,” he sputtered out a closed-mouthed laugh. “You’re gonna be calling people, that’s it, you know how to talk to people, right?”
 
I nodded.
 
“Yeah, no, you don’t,” he sighed. “You’re way too meek,”
 
My nostrils flared a bit. You know that type of rage that brews in you because something is too true? 
 
"No, I’m fucking not,” 
 
“Good, sit down," he said as he pointed to an empty desk, fixing his blond hair a bit. I sat. Meekly. “You’re just gonna be selling things, it’s easy,”
 
“Wait,” I said, feeling stupid. “What am I selling?” 
 
“Sam didn’t tell you?” He sighed once again, his signature move. “We sell a whole array of stuff. There should be a list at your desk with names, numbers, and what you gotta sell them, okay?”
 
My eyes began pecking at the list. It was just your average stuff: iPhones, computers, cruises, and concert tickets. 
 
I forced one of my many water bottles to my lips and crushed the whole thing down. Nerves slithered through me. I hated the fact that I had to cold-call these people. Who the fuck wants their phone ringing just to get a random guy on the other end trying to pressure sell you something? But I wanted the commission, I wanted to show my worth, and weirdly, most of all, I really wanted to prove to Luke I could do it. 
 
“Hi! Mr. Vargas!” I began the call like you would greet an old, familiar friend, one you didn’t know.
 
“Who’s this?” He breathed into the phone in a middle-aged man sorta way.
 
I guess if you answer an unknown number you gotta be a dumb fuck anyway, so I decided to toy with him.
 
“It’s me… Chris,” I tried to think of a common name. “Have you ever been to Alaska?”
 
“Alaska?” His voice groaned into the microphone.
 
“I found this insane deal,” I pretended to be Billy Mays.
 
“What are you even saying?” 
 
“You’ve heard of…” I looked at the list to double check. “Alaska cruise lines? They changed their price from 5 grand to only 2 grand for a week’s trip,”
 
“You know Kelsey’s in the hospital, I can’t be spending that type of money, man,” I was about to tell him how sorry I was, but then the fancy champagne (whose brand I didn’t know) sprung into my mind.
 
“I think it would be nice for you and the…” Fuck. I hope he has kids. “Kids to get away. It’s a mental detox, you know? It’s not easy with what they’re going through,”
 
“I’ll think about it,” he huffed.
 
“I’m not trying to pressure you,” I absolutely was. “But, this deal is ending tonight. Plus, I wanna meet up with you... I’m taking my family too,”
 
“I thought you and Christine split?”
 
“Oh uh, we’re back together,” Each breath I took felt as though I was swallowing little pebbles. “Listen. You need to get your mind off Kelsey, you need to do something for yourself for once. It’s been so long where you’ve had any bit of joy. I’m sorry, but I’m so tired of seeing you suffer,”
 
“Maybe you’re right,”
 
“I am,” I played with the pen on my desk, chewing and clicking it. “There’s so many cool little towns that they stop off at. Plus the food and liquor is already covered. There’s even a chance of seeing the northern lights,”
 
“She’s always wanted to see them,” 
 
“Who?” I asked, pen wedged between my lips.
 
“Kelsey…?”
 
“You can take photos for her! I think that would really help her, man. Want me to send you the link?”
 
“Yes,” 
 
I got my first sale in less than a half hour.
 
It went that way for a month. From 6AM to 2PM I gobbled people up, selling them shit they didn’t need. And with each hour, my empathy was dissolved with a need to replace my bleach stained suit with something designer. 
 
The woman, Sam, liked me a lot. She told me if I kept this work ethic up I’d be promoted in no time. They were already paying me well, but the thought of a promotion made me get all ravenous.
 
My girlfriend at the time didn’t like the way I was handling this all. I would take her out twice a week to the nicest places I could think of. She told me I was spending my money too “frivolously” or whatever the fuck that implied. Here I was being kind to her (to impress her) and she had the nerve to dictate my money?
 
Our 6 month relationship came to an end soon after that. But maybe it was for the best as I’d never want her roped into what I’m dealing with right now. I already was starting to feel that something was off with this place. Just thinking of it now, almost a year later, makes my skin gather goosebumps.
 
After the breakup they asked me if I could begin working overtime. The hours flew by like seconds there, I’d get extra money, and it’s not like I had anything else to do so I agreed. 
 
About a month later I was there at 5:00 clacking away at my keyboard. The entire office was cleaned out, the lights droned, and the only noise I could hear was a printer puking out pages. 
 
“We need to talk,” Sam somehow appeared behind me.
 
“Yeah, sure,” I pretended to be enthusiastic as apprehension trickled into my throat. That phrase is never good. That’s the phrase my girlfriend started our breakup with.
 
“You’ve been here a while,” She seated herself down in the chair next to mine which was Luke’s.
 
“I’d say so,” I halfway gulped.
 
“I need to tell you something,” She swiveled in the chair a bit too wildly.
 
“Yes,” I forced a smile. “What is it?”
 
“This place is not what you think it is,” She brushed the back of my neck with her hand. “And you’re not what I thought you were,”
 
“In what way?”
 
“You’re the perfect 7th,” She held back a squirming smile.
 
“I have no idea what you’re saying,” Vomit started to splash up in my throat. Everything was so quiet yet so loud. You know when dread pools through your whole stomach and all you can do is sit with it? 
 
“Don’t lie to me,” She laughed, patting my shoulders in the way you would a kid who just graduated Kindergarten. “You’re the 7th one,”
 
I knew nothing else but to squint my eyes. I mean, how do you reply to that?
 
“Say something,” Now she was annoyed.
 
“I’m confused,” 
 
“No you’re not, deep inside you know exactly what I mean,” 
 
“Know what?” The room was sweltering and dizzy, my head was lurching as though I was on a fast paced carnival ride.
 
“You know how disgustingly greedy you are, Jude,” She stated, almost like an old timey reporter. 
 
“I’m just here to pay my bills,” My lips began to twitch, the adrenaline of rage was within me.
 
“Just keep at this, you’re great,” She said in a way that might’ve been sarcastic. “Oh, and I need you to- actually never mind ,”
 
“What?”
 
“Eh,” She shrugged. “Nothin’,”
 
“No, tell me,” I crinkled up my face, the great magnet of ego had lugged out my words.
 
“I need you to sign this,” she slowly dragged a paper packet across the desk with her pointer finger.
 
“For?” I reached for my chewed up Bic.
 
“Nevermind,”
 
I wish I actually read the thing. I wish I never signed it. I wish I asked questions. I wish I just quit right then, but most of all I wish I didn’t actually know what she was talking about. 
 
I know I sound fucking insane, but as each day grows I feel that my soul might actually be gone. 
 
I’ll write another post to explain why I think so. I just need to get my bearings straight, even typing this up makes my stomach boil with sickness. I’ve tried everything there is to do: sage, holy water, religion, and even therapy. I just really hope to god someone reading this can help me.
 
I’m gonna order DoorDash, drink some champagne, and chill out. I’ll update you all soon.
