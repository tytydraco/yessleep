My wrestling name is “Machine” Gunner Garrison; my real name will remain anonymous, and I have always had a great time being the heel. I’d love playing up my ‘evilness’ to the crowd. Making fun of their hometown, cussing at folks, or taking people’s food/drinks. I worked for a small promotion that you’ve probably never heard of. They’re called Savage Championship Wrestling, or SCW for short.

The company prided itself on being ‘The Most Savage Wrestling Promotion ever made!’ Our promoter, Eli, prided himself on trying to emulate the greats in extreme wrestling. ECW, CZW, AEW, and even the Attitude & Ruthless Aggression eras of WWE. We prided ourselves on bloodshed, and Eli was always coming up with the wildest match stipulations imaginable.

There were barbed wire ropes, barbed wire cages, barbed wire chairs…if he was bored and didn’t know how to spice up a match, he’d add barbed wire. The worst of his ideas involved glass tables, which were just glass panes on wooden horses. I was picking the shards out of my back all night; it fucking sucked. But why did I put up with it? Well, at some point, you just hope that you’re going to be picked up or noticed by one of the big promotions.

I actually had friends get picked up by the big promotions; they were jobbers, sure, but the pay was good. Yet, whenever I look in the mirror, I keep seeing myself age. I looked like my Dad, in fact, I could even imagine my father’s condescending words speaking to me,

“Go on, then! Go become a wrestler!” He says, “Just don’t come crawling back when you’re a cripple!”

That was twenty years ago. And the idea of joining the big leagues gets more distant with each year. It seems like with each passing year, the mold for what a wrestler should be just keeps shrinking. I’m big, strong, tall, but I’m also not pretty, I’m fat, & my forehead looks all fucked up. My promo skills have been shaky, but I’ve heard much worse.

One day, we were somewhere in New Mexico, a small town, and we were in a local gym. The crowd filled the stands and the fold-out chairs on the floor. Eli pulls me aside before I get ready for a street rules match,

“You got a minute?” He said,

“It’s your time we’re wasting, you booked it.”

“We got someone in the crowd who’s looking at you. A thin Mexican man is wearing a red suit with a golden cross around his neck. He’s with a promotion South of the border.”

My mind raced. I’d always admired Lucha Libre, but before I could ask more, my music hit. I thanked Eli and made my way down to the ring. The match was standard stuff, a few good spots, and then we get nasty with the blood and really start selling our injuries like we're killing each other. I was dishing out some chair shots to Tim's back (the guy I was losing to) when I saw the guy Eli was talking about. Amongst the crowd of locals and wrestling fans in the gymnasium that night, he stood out as oddly sophisticated. The red suit was pressed, and upon his head sat a red cowboy hat. He sat with his legs crossed, wore shades, and smoked a cigarette that occasionally illuminated his thin face. While I was looking at him, I fucked up big time.

The spot was supposed to be that I hit him in the back a few times, then he jolts up, and snatched the chair from me and gave me a DDT on it. But while I was looking at the guy, I brought the chair down the same time that Tim stood up. I clocked him in the head with it, hard. The crowd let out an audible groan. The ref stared at me with fierce eyes, ran to check up on Tim, and then threw up the 'X' sign with his arms. Paramedics rushed out, and I tried to play it up to the crowd, but deep down, I had a feeling that they knew I was scared. When I looked back, the man in red was gone.

I went backstage after the match was called, and Eli was waiting for me, and he was pissed.

"The fuck were you thinking?"

"I'm sorry, I slipped up."

"You fucked up!"

I wiped the blood from my face with a white towel, staining it pink. I asked,

"Tim gonna be okay?"

"He's concussed, Gunner. It could've been a helluva lot worse. I heard that chair shot from back here."

I sat down and undid my boots. I kept my head down. I couldn't face him because I knew what he was saying was true. 

However, that's when the door opened from behind us, and the man in red walked in. His spurs jingled from his boots with each step. He never removed his shades. In the pale, white-tiled locker room, he stood out with his bright red attire. He removed his hat and held it to his heart. He spoke with a thick accent; his voice was surprisingly deep, and his words rang out clearly. 

"You wrestled good," he said

"I appreciate it, but it wasn't my best day," I responded,

"Far from it." Eli chimed in,

"No, no, it's perfect. The violence, the carnage, and you showed real strength out there, gringo."

"You're flattering me, but thank you."

He walked up to the bench across from me and sat down. He removed his glasses and saw his two black eyes staring at me with rabid fascination.

"I have a reverence for wrestling. So does my employer. Whether it be Japanese, Lucha Libre, or American, such as yourself, it's an art form that dates back to the days of the traveling circus. In a way, we're all payasos, eh?"

I smiled at him. I'd never thought of myself as a carnie, but that's exactly how wrestling started. I extended my hand, and he shook it almost immediately. He grinned, revealing a perfect set of teeth.

"I'd like to offer you a chance to work in our promotion. It's a work in progress, but it's shaping up to be something truly special."

"Well, do you have a start date yet?"

"You could start this week. We'll make accommodations."

Eli stood up and shook his head,

"I'm sorry, but he's under contract to work at least five more shows here in the States. If you need him that badly, you're gonna have to buy out his contract."

"Name your price."

Eli's eyes widened, and then he looked at me with a startled, confused look on his face. The man rose to his feet and withdrew a fat wallet that was practically bulging with dollars. He opened it and forked over 1,000$ like it was nothing. Eli stared at the money in his hand with disbelief.

"Need more?"

"Uh, yeah?"

He forked over another 1,000$. Eli grinned and spoke with a snarky tone.

"Ten thousand."

"Eli, my-" And before I could say how much my contract was actually worth, the man gave him what he wanted without a moment's hesitation. 

Eli just stared at the money, slack-jawed, and then stuffed it hastily into his pocket. He jutted his hand out to seal the deal, and the man shook it. The man smiled and said,

“Good doing business with your company.”

“Likewise.”

“May I talk with him for a second, in private?”

“Sure.”

Eli walked away, and I heard him talking among the other wrestlers, chatting about upcoming shows. The man in red went to the corner of the room, grabbed a flour chair, and brought it in front of me.

“My employer’s company thrives on violence. Extreme violence. There will be bloodshed, stitches, broken bones, but everything will be covered.”

“You mean I’ll be insured?”

“In a way. Just not in the traditional sense.”

“Okay. It’s risky, I get it, but wrestling in general is like that.”

He nodded in agreement,

“I’m glad you understand.”

“Where is this promotion of yours?”

“It’s in Mexico, but the exact whereabouts aren’t disclosed to the public. It’s more of a show for a privileged few, rich few.”

“So these aren’t the usual fans?”

“Quite the contrary, these are super fans. They LIVE for this entertainment. And our business offers the highest quality extreme wrestling experience they could buy. But are you willing to go through it?”

“You’ve already paid my boss, why keep asking? Seems like we’re all in agreement, ain’t we?”

“I just wanted to be sure it's all. My business isn’t for the faint of heart; we’ve had many quit or no-show entirely. We’re trying to avoid these little incidents.”

“Hell, I’ve had to deal with colleagues who showed up drunk in the ring. As long as there’s a steady paycheck, I’m down for whatever.”

He stood up and donned his hat & sunglasses. He turned to me before he left and said, 

“When you’re ready, we’ll get you transportation.”

He handed me a card. It was solid black with gold numbers on it.

“Call this number when you’re ready. We’ll have a room ready for you, and we’ll discuss your first match. Your starting pay will be 35,000$. Cash.”

I felt like the wind was knocked out of me as soon as he left the room. Did I just fucking hear that $35,000? I returned to my room, and for a second I thought about calling my wife. We have a child back home, and she’s not exactly fond of my line of work. She’d see me come home with cuts and bruises. On top of this, I’m not the best father. I’m not home as much as I want to, and when I get home, I always give her a half assed gift, spend time with her, and then I’m off to my next gig. I’m not gonna sugarcoat it. I’m a deadbeat, but maybe I could work something out with this new company. With the pay I’m getting, maybe I can finally be there. Maybe I can even put her into college. Get my wife a new house. And hell, I’m not getting any older, maybe I’ll retire early.

That night, I was sitting in front of a fully packed bag of clothes and personal items when I called the number on the card. The phone rang only once, and then a voice answered,

“Buenas noches, señor, are you ready?”

“I’m ready.”

“Bien! Bien! Bien! We’ll be there shortly.”

“Okay, I’m at-“

“We know where you are.”

And then he hung up.

It made me feel uneasy, but I rationalized it by thinking that maybe Eli told them where I was. I took my things and headed downstairs to the lobby, and I turned in my keycard to the staff. When I exited the hotel into the humid New Mexico night, a limousine was waiting for me, back door hanging wide open. I had to duck my head to get in, and in the back seat was the man in red. Same suit, and he had a bottle of wine on ice.

"Welcome to Lucha Libre del Infierno."

He tapped on the glass behind the driver, and the window cracked down just a hair. 

"Si?"

"Vamos a casa."

"Ah. Sí, Señor Rivas."

The window rolled up, and then we were off. I noticed that I couldn't see exactly where we were going because all of the windows were blacked out. The only thing illuminated was the cabin of the limousine. I asked him,

"So, your name is Rivas?"

He paused and palmed his face,

"Mi dio, I can't believe I forgot to introduce myself. I was so wrapped up in business that I forgot to say my name. It's Antonio Rivas. My friends simply call me Tony Rivas."

"Well, it's nice to know you properly, I guess."

"Come, let's drink. Need anything before we head out to Mexico? Some food? Girls? Boys?"

"I'll eat when I get there, and no thanks, I'm married."

His face drooped slightly; he seemed almost sad. 

"I see."

"I plan on getting my little girl into college."

He nodded, and he started pouring the wine into the glass.

"To family then, wherever they may be."

I took the glass and raised it.

"To family."

The drive to Mexico was long, but thankfully, I drank myself silly and passed out sometime halfway. I was awoken by Tony shaking me with a firm hand,

"We're here. I'll show you to your room."

I stumbled from the Limo and gazed at my surroundings. A vast stretch of desert, but within it was a large, featureless building that only had doors and air conditioning units sticking out of it. To the left of it was a large adobe hotel that was two levels tall, very wide, and had a pool in the center with palm trees sticking out around it. It was luxurious, albeit foreign, in the bare, rocky desert. It was still early morning, so the sun wasn't out, but its glow could still be seen on the horizon.

"Follow me, I'll show you to your room."

I went with Antonio to my room, which was simple but very luxurious for someone who used to stay in sketchy hotels for gigs. There was a television, a big bed, hot walk-in showers, and even a menu on the bed for me to order from.

Antonio and I walked to the balcony of the place, looking at the red morning sky. I was desperate for sleep, and Antonio told me,

"Best rest up, tomorrow is a big day for you."

I didn't hesitate; I fell asleep almost immediately, and I was awoken by a knock at the door. The room was bright, and my head felt like it was full of scorpions. I stunk, and I was sweaty, but I answered the door regardless. It was Antonio; this time, he was wearing a bright blue suit with a matching hat.

"Come, let's get you dressed. Best to take a shower first. I'll be waiting for you at the pool. I did as he said, and when I went down there, he was relaxing with a dozen other luchadores by the pool, none of them removed their masks. Their backs were bruised and scarred. I waved, and they waved back, but they wore apprehension on their faces.

"¿Dónde está su máscara?" one of them said,

Antonio responded,

"Pronto recibirá su merecido."

He got up and walked me over to the big building opposite the motels that the wrestlers stayed in. We walked in, and it was cold, refreshingly cold compared to the humidity. I was walked to their locker room/dressing area. There was an elderly gentleman, his face coated in thick wrinkles, and his forehead was littered with scars. He was a wrestler, too; he looked to have bladed himself one too many times. 

"You must be the new luchadore I've heard so much about," he hoarsely said,

"Yes, I'm-"

"No names. From here on out, you live and die by the mask."

"But I don't have one."

"You will. I am the mask maker here. You must first decide on a name and who you are, and I will do the rest."

It was a lot of pressure to decide a luchador name. I'd always liked my 'Machine Gun' persona, and I felt like it's been with me for so long that I couldn't just abandon it. So I asked, Antonio,

"What is Spanish for The Machine Gun?"

"La Ametralladora."

"Then that's my name."

The old mask maker smiled, 

"I'll see what I can do."

He measured my head, made notes of my eye color, my features, and then I had to wait. It took no less than three hours. I got a knock at the door. I opened it to find a small box. I took off the lid and found a beautiful, dull silver mask with yellow & red highlights. The symbol in the center of my forehead is that of three 50. Caliber bullets. I donned it and looked in the mirror. In that moment, I felt transformed. From then on out, I was a luchador.

That night, I received a call from Antonio saying, 

"You're debuting tonight."

"I've not rehearsed, I don't even know who I'm against."

"Don't worry about it, I'll tell you when you head over to backstage."

I went over, and joining us were dozens of the other guys. They complimented me on my mask in broken English, but the sentiment was there. In the short time I was there, these men were like friends already. 

I walked in to see that the lights for the mini-arena were on and it displayed a lush ring with decorative ringposts decked out in marigolds, red ropes, and a stark white ring mat. I was lacing up my boots when Antonio walked in and told the others to leave for a few minutes.

"Your Mask looks wonderful, Ametralladora."

"Thanks."

"Just a heads up, there isn't a physical audience per se, but rather a digital one."

"So we're streaming then?"

"Yes."

"I see. And what's my match on the card?

"First match. Your debut. You're facing Murte Roja. It's his retirement match, and it's going to be a splatter match. The goal is to coat the mat in his blood, or he'll cover it in yours."

I was suspicious for a second and asked,

"That's a lot of blood to cover one ring with."

"I'm aware, your employer is aware, but Murte Roja is not. You're booked to win, but he doesn't know. End the match as best as you see fit."

"What? You want me to kill him or something?"

His face didn't change; he stared at me with a serious glare that chilled me. Goosebumps broke out over my skin,

"No."

"You signed up for this, amigo, hold up your end of the bargain. You'll do fine out there, just pick a weapon, and don't hold back."

Before I could say anything, he was gone. And the others walked in, including Muerte Roja. He was lanky, tall, and noticeably older than the others. His mask looked like a red skull,

"What'd he say, Ametralladora?"

I looked at him, losing all words in my mouth, and all I could get out was,

"He said to make sure it was extreme."

He chuckled,

"Amigo, every match is extreme, you'll do fine."

In gorilla position, I waited for my music to be called. From the other room, a deafening voice announced my arrival in a thunderingly loud voice. My music hit, and I walked through that curtain, and pyro went off; it sounded like a machine gun. I looked around, trying to play up for a crowd, but there wasn't any. There was a lone man in the front of the ring; he was older, coated in tattoos, and he puffed a cigar. Next to him was Antonio, legs crossed, observing the match. In the corners of the tiny arena were armed guards, dressed in plain clothes, all carrying pistols in holsters. Surrounding the ring were cameramen, all of them wearing solid black masks to conceal their identities.

Muerte Roja comes out, and the announcer gives him a grand entrance, listing title wins and accolades. But he noticeably stiffened up when he announced that this was a retirement match. Roja's demeanor changed entirely, and his body language, even with the mask, told me everything. He entered the ring and stared down at me, his eyes tired,

"So, you're the one who's gonna do it?"

"I didn't know, Roja, I-"

"Shut the fuck up and wrestle."

He decked me with a stiff headbutt and exited the ring to grab a weapon. I was still seeing stars when I heard the bell go off. The match had officially started. He returned with a barbed-wire baseball bat and started laying into my back. Blood rushed down onto the mat as I rolled out, clutching at my back. Roja was taunting me and hitting poses to an audience that wasn't there. I reached under the ring and found a staple gun. I rose to the ring and was almost hit by another swing from the bat. I ducked and speared him to the ground. I heard him wheezing; I'd knocked the breath from out of him. I took the staple gun, and I shot several staples into his chest and neck, and I finally put one in his wrist so he'd drop the bat. I gripped the bat and raked the barbed wire across his chest. He screamed in pain, and from the torn flesh, blood spilled out onto the mat.

His chest glistened with dark red, the mat getting soaked up with blood. It was beginning to drench it. While he bled, I ducked out of the ring and withdrew a table along with a bag of thumbtacks. I heard clapping behind me and found that the older man, the man who I assumed was my employer, was grinning and clapping his hands. Antonio was smiling ear to ear as he blew smoke from his teeth. I returned to the ring and propped the table on the corner, and I felt Roja drop kick me. I was already trying my best to stay coordinated after the headbutt, but the dropkick sent me into the table face-first. I felt wood splinter and crack, and my head smacked the bottom turnbuckle. None of which had paddling. I felt something warm pool at the top of my mask, and when I looked down at the mat, I saw that blood was flowing from my eye and mouth holes. 

I heard Roja pouring the thumbtacks onto the ring, and when I got to my feet, I walked right into a scoop slam and landed a back fist into the tacks. It was sudden, sharp, and nauseating. I looked up spotting Roja with the barbed-wire bat again, and I had no choice but to roll out. More thumbtacks jammed themselves into my arms, torso, and back as I did so. Roja climbed down from the rope and swung wildly at me. The bat caught me in my arm, and I felt a muffled crunch. I didn't feel it, though. Adrenaline has a way of making someone feel invincible. When he ripped the bat out of my arm, I kicked him in his balls. I didn't care if I fought dirty; it was survival. 

While he was reeling from the blow, I reached under the ring and grabbed a chair. I paused, thinking about how a fucked up chair shot got me into this mess, but I brought it down anyway. The smack of the steel chair against the skull was thunderous, and my employer even let out a little cheer. Roja slumped to the ground, his chest still oozing blood. I tossed him into the ring, and he was limp. I got another table and flung it into the ring. I got back in and noticed that Roja was losing lots of blood. And per the match stipulation, I had to coat the ring in it. So, I grabbed his arms and dragged him around, staining the mat like I was using a human brush against a blank canvas. 

By the time I was done with him, the bell rang, and then I set the table in the corner and gave him my finisher. It was essentially a modified buckle bomb, but it did the trick. I flung Muerte Roja's bloodied body into the table, and it practically exploded. I was heaving for breath, the adrenaline was beginning to wear off, and the pain was excruciating. My employer stood and clapped, and so did Antonio. My employer gestured to the tech crew below him to give him a mic. He tapped it to check if it was working, and then he spoke.

"Remove his mask."

I had no choice, so I went to Roja and yanked the mask off. His face was swollen, bruised, and bloody. His eyes were like little gems in a sea of swollen skin. His expression was that of utter exhaustion.

"Retire him."

I looked at the man with confusion. Antonio looked on with fascination. I remembered our talk, 'End the match as best you see fit,' he said. I got out of the ring and picked up the barbed-wire bat; there were still bits of skin and meat stuck in the barbs. It was slick with blood. I gripped the handle and grabbed it with my one good arm. I rolled into the ring, and when I stood over Roja, he just stared at me with tired eyes. He spoke in a whisper,

"Turn me over, I don't want to see it coming."

There wasn't much I could do, but I did grant him this one kindness. I flipped him over, and with a hard swing, I brought the bat down on his skull. I did it over and over again until the hair clumped up in the wire and until his skull was mashed on the mat. There were cheers from the two men and clapping from the guards stationed around the building. They bowed, and in turn, I bowed right back. I felt sick, but I couldn't show it; I was a performer. 

When I returned backstage, I was met with applause and celebration by the luchadores in the back. They didn't care about what I'd done, but they said that my match was spectacular to watch. I was given stitches, and the doctor, if he really was one to begin with, sewed up my arm. I would be out for a little while, but everyone said they were looking forward to my return to the ring. 

I've been wrestling for Lucha Libre del Infierno for a decade now. I've been wiring money back home for as long as I can remember. I've had hundreds of matches, and I've 'retired' many luchadores. I have battle scars, I've broken many bones, and I've lost my fair share of blood. All of it for a rabid fan base that I'll never see or meet, but I'm told I'm a fan favorite. Yet, I write this now as my final confession, because a new wrestler has joined our little troupe, and I believe this might just be my retirement match. 

So to all my fans out there, thank you for your support and admiration. I hope that when I post this, I am still the last man standing in the ring.
