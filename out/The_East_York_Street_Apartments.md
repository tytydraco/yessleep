I'm not the one who doesn't believe in the paranormal and what happened at the East York Street Apartments, well let's say it was a tragedy forgotten by time itself and wholeheartedly thought the whole thing was a massive cover-up, that is why when finding myself standing before the crumbling facade of the old building, and couldn't help but feel a shiver run down my spine but returning to an old apartment with the worst mistake of my life and now I'm regretting everything.

This wasn't your average, run-down apartment block, oh no, not even the most dilapidated of structures could compare to the ominous aura that clung to it like a shroud, the vibrant walls from its past were now a canvas for graffiti, a silent testament to the years of neglect, the windows, shattered, stared back at me like the hollow sockets of a skull, and the smell, oh, the smell, was a thick cocktail of mold and despair, a scent so potent it could choke the life out of any hope that had the misfortune of lingering nearby.

I had called this place home from 2006 to 2012, and even though a decade had passed, the memories remained as vivid as the day and having fled, screaming into the night, my heart hammering in my chest like a drummer gone mad, they said it was a fire that had driven out the tenants before us, but the way the stories were circulated around town, the way the very air felt thick with secrets, you'd think it was something more as there were no records, no newspaper articles, no charred remains to speak of. 

Just whispers of a night that had swallowed the building whole, it was like it had never happened, but the scars on the walls told a different story, a tale of agony and fear that was etched into every brick and beam, as I approached the main entrance, the boards that had been nailed over the door seemed to groan in protest at my return. 

The once yellow paint was now peeling away, revealing the rotting wood beneath, a sad metaphor for the lives that had once been lived within, the urge to turn back washed over me, and couldn't neither need to face whatever was waiting for me, to finally lay to rest the ghosts of my past, with a deep breath, I stepped into the abyss of the darkened hallway. 

Then after entering the dusty lobby that was so thick it danced in the beams of the setting sun that dared to pierce through the broken windows, each step I took echoed through the emptiness, a rhythmic taunt that grew louder with every footfall, the whispers grew stronger, a chorus of unearthly voices that seemed to beckon me closer, "You shouldn't have come back!" they seemed to say, their words a symphony of despair that grew louder, more insistent and also with a malevolence of pure hatred and disgust that I even set foot back into its domain as this invisible force was claiming the right to be there.

My heart racing, I made my way up the stairs, each creaking a silent scream in the stillness, the second-floor landing was a ghost town, littered with the remnants of lives that had once been full of promise when reaching out and touching the wall, the plaster crumbling under my fingertips, leaving a trail of dust that danced in the air like ash and there I saw it, "Apartment 2B" the very place where it all began, the door hung open, like a gaping mouth waiting to devour me whole when stepping over the threshold, and the air grew colder, heavier with the weight of the years, but it was larger than I've remembered it being with multiple rooms and reddish walls that pulsated with the heartbeat of a creature that didn't belong in our world and to make it worse nails were hanging on the ceiling that looked like teeth and when touching one of the walls it was warm with a trail of slime like saliva dripping down as the breathing got heavier and aggressive.

The bedroom door was ajar, just as I had left it all those years ago, the darkness within seemed to beckon me with a sinister grin when stepping closer, the whispers grew louder, a cacophony of voices that seemed to whisper my name, the laughter, that deep, soul-wrenching cackle, filled the air, sending chills down my spine, the same laughter that had haunted my dreams, the same laughter that had driven me from my bed in the dead of night and the closet door, a rectangle of shadow, taunted me, it was like staring into the mouth of hell itself and knowing that you're about to be swallowed whole, with trembling hands and after reaching for the door handle. 

My heart thudded against my ribcage like it was trying to escape, and with a deep breath, and pulled it open to reveal a horrifying scene of corpses that were half-digested or already skeletons the air was the most putrid smell imaginable but numerous of them down a hallway resembling a stomach with a bubbling liquid reeking of acid and flesh and bones, but there was something else in there, something alive, something that looked at me with eyes filled with pain and malice and after looking into the abyss, it looked back at me with a grin that sent a shiver down my spine as it dived into the substance shrieking in pain and pleasure. 

While standing there, frozen with fear, the whispers grew louder, more insistent, and the laughter grew more intense until it was all I could hear, my sanity teetering on the edge of the abyss, upon realizing that the fire was not the end, was just the beginning, and that the real horror had been lying in wait, hidden from the world, biding its time, and now it had me right where it wanted me, and after turning and bolted, the hallway stretched on forever, the stairs seemingly a mile away, the whispers turned into screams, the laughter into a cacophony of rage and I could feel it, the thing that had been waiting, the thing that had been watching, the thing that had been born in the fire, it was coming for me, and it was closer than ever, my chest tight, my legs burning, causing me to stumble down the stairs.

The doors of the other apartments slammed shut, as if in a silent bid to keep the horror within, bursting through the front door and didn't stop running until my lungs felt like they were on fire and my legs could no longer carry me and realized this was a dead end, I've now been in the clutches of this "living building" and its interior while navigating the terrifying environment and dealing with the deformed inhabitants for days and it seems like there is no escape from the grip of the East York Street Apartments.

Right as I'm writing this warning please do not go finding this place because I've uncovered something that showed me to the bone that happened before these events and it shouldn't have been this way, a secret that had been buried for years, a truth that was too dark, too terrifying to face, and now, and it is all one can think about, a truth that has turned this place into a prison for the damned, and me, back in the 1930s and the details are very grim as usual as terrible.

The former landlord James Matteaux was a cruel and wealthy person who wanted to exploit the tenants during the Great Depression era, and when they could not pay, he would throw them into the basement and let them starve to death, but they didn't just die, they transformed into something else, something that feeds on fear and despair, something that is now a part of the very fabric of the building, it's like a living organism that feeds on the souls of the inhabitants, a prison that had been born from the ashes of greed and suffering, and allegedly he murdered his wife Norma for just making him angry by throwing her down a flight of stairs. 

I realized something terrifying and a chilling thought came to my mind, tenants before me who had witnessed this cold and calculated murder, were intimidated to keep quiet and their fear grew into something palpable, something tangible, it had fed the building, had made it what it is today, a monstrous abomination that craves the pain and sorrow of those who dare to enter its walls would bleed this greenish liquid with a foul and odorous stench that was reminiscent of decaying flesh and it grew stronger, more potent as the years went by and the more tenants fell prey to Matteaux's evil deeds and schemes as he continued his reign of terror, the more the building became a prison for the damned.

Now, as I sit here in the dark, the whispers have turned to screams, the laughter to a chorus of anguish, and can feel the walls closing in, the floor beneath me pulsing with the hunger of the creature that dwells within, the same creature that had watched me all those years ago, that had fed on my fear and despair, the creature that had been born from the ashes of the East York Street Apartments and the souls of those who had suffered within its walls, knowing nobody would never leave this place, or escape the clutches of James Matteaux or whatever the hell he has become, a creature that had been born of fire and greed and had grown into something so much worse and I'm next in its line of food.

As I started to lose hope suddenly there was this room with a light flickering and a typewriter as if it had been waiting for me to tell this story, to warn others of the horrors that dwell here, but fearing it is too late for me, for the whispers have turned into a deafening roar, the floor is shaking beneath me, and the creature is coming, it's so close, and can almost taste the fear in the air, the greenish liquid oozing under the door, and the only way to keep it at bay is to keep typing, to keep my mind focused, to not let the darkness consume me.

This isn't just an abandoned apartment building it is a predator of the highest and most terrifying order, and it will never let me go, never let anyone who enters, escape, the East York Street Apartments isn't just a place, it is a living nightmare, a tomb for the forgotten and the damned if a person crosses through the threshold they now one of them, trapped in this hellish labyrinth of despair.

my every breath a silent scream, my every heartbeat a mournful lament, my every step bringing me closer to nearest the light flickers and the creature's breath grows hot on the back of my neck, upon realizing that this is where my story ends, and the building's never-ending cycle of horror continues, forevermore, never to be forgotten by the souls it has claimed and the darkness it has spawned.

Then I read about tenants who disappeared between 1945 in 1965 some of them were found to have left everything in their apartments behind, their keys still in the locks, their shoes outside their doors, but their bodies were never found, it was as if they had simply vanished into thin air, leaving behind only the whispers of their final moments of terror and despair, the police had investigated but the building was so vast and the corridors so twisted, that they had found nothing, no sign of struggle, no evidence of foul play, and the whispers grew louder, more intense, the walls seemed to close in around me, the creature that had been born of the building's despair and anger had found me, and now it was going to make sure that I never left, that I would become just another story, another whisper in its eternal symphony of horror.

The basement was where the real nightmare began, a labyrinth of darkness and pain, a place where the other countless souls who had been trapped here had suffered, and now it was my turn to experience the same fate, the walls were lined with the decayed remains of those who had come before me, their eyes wide open in silent screams of agony, the air thick with the stench of decay, and somewhere in the distance, I could hear the echo of laughter, the same laughter that had haunted my dreams, and the same laughter that had driven me to the edge of madness, and now it was coming closer, the creature that had been born from the fires of hell was coming for me, and there was no escape.

However, the ironic part was when I was here none of these events were occurring except for the paranormal and unexplained things, but now that I'm telling the story it is like the building knows and is responding, the creature's breath is hot on my neck and the whispers are deafening, the greenish liquid is rising around my ankles and the floor is shaking with the creature's rage and I've realized that the building itself was the real monster, a living, breathing entity that feeds on the fear and pain of its inhabitants, a creature that had been born from the ashes of greed and despair, a creature that had grown stronger with each passing year, and now it had me in its grasp, never to let go.

But my fight is not over yet and it is about to begin when I'm planning to get to the bottom of the East York Street Apartments and its most terrifying, repulsive, and disturbing history of unsolved murders, mysterious disappearances, strange sightings, deformed animals, unusual people, and other paranormal activity as well as distortions in time.
