It was supposed to be a celebration. The end of an exhausting journey through medical school, a coming-of-age ritual that I, Damiano, and my friends always had. Camping in the mountains, a sacred tradition for us nature lovers. But Renata, my girlfriend, didn't see it that way. "We could do something different this time," she said, rolling her eyes. She was already a doctor, and for her, our tradition was nonsense. I met Renata at a party through Yara, her best friend and my classmate. With her curly brown hair and bright eyes, she was the most beautiful girl there, and I fell in love at first sight. I already had everything planned: a marriage proposal after my graduation, a year from now. She hates nature; it's our only point of contention, but I can't complain, she always goes out of her way for me.

As we drove to the campsite, I tried to calm her down. "Honey, we'll do something different next time, I promise." I knew she was afraid of camping, but she was getting better. "Whatever you want," she murmured, laughing. "Damiano, you say that every time! Do you think they've arrived yet?"

I decided to call Richard. The phone rang, but no one answered. "Strange, they're not picking up."

"Try Yara," Renata suggested.

I tried, and she didn't answer either. I took Renata's phone to try again and saw a strange message from Yara:Â "don't come". What? 

"Renata, what is this?" I showed her the phone. She quickly averted her gaze from the road to read it. "Don't come? They must be trying to be funny." Richard and Yara sometimes liked to play pranks on us.

"Honey, I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't go," I said, feeling a chill.

"They're just being funny, Damiano, relax." She was strangely calm about the situation, which scared me a little, as she was usually so easily spooked.

We arrived at the campsite. Richard and Yara's car was there, but there was no sign of them. "Richard? Yara?" I called out, my voice sounding small in the vastness of the forest.

Suddenly, they emerged from the woods, smiling. But there was something... wrong. Richard's smile seemed forced, almost fixed, and Yara's eyes had an empty glint I'd never seen before.

"You took your time," Richard said, his voice a little more monotone than usual.

"We got your message," Renata said, handing the phone back to me. "You two are such jokers."

Yara laughed, a shrill, joyless sound. "Message? What message?"

My heart froze. Renata looked at me, her expression finally a mix of confusion and dread. "The 'don't come' message," she explained, her voice uncertain.

Richard and Yara exchanged glances, then turned their gazes back to us with a disturbing silence. "We don't know what you're talking about," Richard said, his smile still oddly fixed.

Renata frowned. "No, you do. I saw it. From your phone, Yara."

"This is my phone," Yara said, pulling out a cell phone from her pocket. It wasn't the same number that sent the message to Renata. "Where did you get that message?"

A shiver ran down my spine. Renata's calm demeanor shattered. Her eyes widened. "I don't understand... it was from your number, Yara. I'm sure of it."

Richard and Yara just watched us, their smiles unmoving, their eyes empty. It was as if they were scanning us, evaluating every reaction. The air grew heavy, cold, even with the campfire Richard had already lit (when did he do that?).

"Damiano, I have a strange feeling," Renata whispered, grabbing my arm. Her skin was cold.

"How about a toast to our graduation?" Richard said, raising a water bottle. "To our new life."

"Life?" Yara echoed, her voice strangely high-pitched. "Yes, a new life."

I looked at Renata. She was pale, her eyes fixed on Richard and Yara. It wasn't them. It couldn't be them. The way they moved, the way they spoke... it was as if they were slightly distorted versions, imperfect copies.

As night fell, the atmosphere became unbearable. Richard and Yara talked about trivialities, but their eyes never left us. They seemed to be studying our every move, every breath. Every time I picked up my phone to try and call someone, they'd interrupt me with some random question or a suggestion to go explore the forest.

"How about a walk, Damiano?" Yara suggested, her smile widening on her pale face. "Just a little bit before bed."

Renata squeezed my hand. "No." Her voice was firm. "We're tired. Let's sleep."

Richard stood up, his movements fluid, almost unnatural. "As you wish." He and Yara set up their tents in silence, a greater distance than usual.

Inside the tent, Renata was trembling. "It's not them, Damiano," she whispered, her voice choked. "It's not really them. What happened to them?"

"I don't know, honey. But we're getting out of here at dawn," I said, trying to sound brave.

When I fell asleep, I had nightmares. I dreamt of Richard and Yara's empty eyes, and the "don't come" message flashing in my mind.

I was woken by a sound. A low whisper, like dry leaves rustling on the ground, coming from outside the tent. I looked to my side: Renata wasn't there.

My heart pounded. I unzipped the tent and crawled out, the night air embracing me with a biting cold. Richard and Yara's tents were empty. The campfire had turned to embers, its weak warmth fading into the darkness.

"Renata?" I called out, my voice trembling.

There was no answer.

Then, I heard it. A sound coming from the dense forest. A strange murmur, almost a chant, but without words. It was Renata's voice.

I ran towards the sound, entering the darkness of the woods. The trees closed in around me, their branches like skeletal fingers pointing at something sinister. Renata's voice grew clearer, but it wasn't a cry for help. It was a soft, repetitive lament, as if she were reciting something.

I burst through a clearing and froze.

Renata was there. Her back to me, standing in front of a dark, jagged rock formation I hadn't noticed before. She was swaying gently from side to side. And then I saw them.

Richard and Yara were kneeling in front of her, in a strange reverence, their bodies motionless, their faces turned upward, as if worshipping her.

They weren't the same. Their eyes glowed with a faint greenish light, almost bioluminescent, and the skin on their faces seemed stretched, translucent, revealing dark veins pulsing beneath.

Renata slowly raised her arms, and a sound that was not human escaped her throat. It was the melody I had been hearing, now louder, more filling, an ancient and terrifying language.

The air around them vibrated. And then, I noticed Renata's eyes. They weren't the bright brown I loved. They were just like Richard and Yara's. Green, empty, and filled with a darkness that could never be filled.

She turned, slowly and deliberately. Her smile was that of a predator, her lips thin and stretched, showing teeth that seemed longer, sharper.

"Don't come, Damiano," she said, her voice no longer the one I knew, but a distorted echo of the melody that filled the air. "We're home now."

My feet were rooted to the ground, unable to move. What was my girlfriend, was now something terrifyingly different, something that looked at me with an ancient hunger.

Renata's green eyes glowed intensely in the darkness, and the murmuring of the forest became a chorus of voices, all repeating the same phrase: "Don't come. Don't come. Don't come."

And I knew, with a terrifying certainty, that I was next.
