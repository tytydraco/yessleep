**Shift 1**

 

The factory has formalized a new rule: every worker must make an entry into this journal before the end of each shift. Records of productivity observations must be made. All deviations from normal emotions must be listed. If any abnormalities in thought occur, they must be reported to the shift manager at the start of the next shift. Failure to do so will result in punishment. Documentation ensures systems run smoothly and prevents incidents. This upholds social stability in our community.

 

My first observation is that the Officer of Order who delivered these journals wore two different coloured socks. For someone whose role is to maintain order, he performs poorly in his own attire. The journal was also delivered late, and with curfew approaching, I must sleep to prepare for the next shift. Therefore, I cannot record more observations today.

 

**Shift 2**

 

Today, I attached object A-13 to B4-17. I repeated this process 543 times to maintain efficiency and avoid slowing down my peers. However, I noticed several errors that compromised the integrity of the task. Some A-13 units were misshapen; a few had a long circular cone narrowing into a perfect cylinder, but others had ridges or imperfections along the cylindrical section. These flaws required me to adjust each placement differently, which made me approximately 0.35x slower in completing my obligation.

 

I was stationed beside the heating device that softens the objects. Many pieces emerged too hot to hold, forcing me to leave additional time between assembly steps. This further reduced my rate of production. Aside from these inefficiencies, my peers worked at a highly efficient pace, one hand grasping the yellow cone fresh from the heater, the other pressing it into the rigid structure of B4-17, all in complete synchronization. They represent the pinnacle of efficiency, as I must also aim to do.

 

Object B4-17 appears to contain a type of powder, presumably intended for the north wing of the factory. I have visited that wing only once, during something management referred to as a “leadership role.” I did not understand the meaning of this phrase, but I was instructed to deliver papers and later received a reward at the end of the quarter for fulfilling this leader assignment.

 

My emotions today may have been more unusual than normal, but I do not believe this warrants raising an alarm. Reporting something minor could compromise the system’s efficiency by drawing attention away from matters of actual importance.

 

**Shift 3**

 

Today I took my observations from yesterday and obtained a pair of gloves so my hands would not burn when handling the freshly heated objects. I returned to my station, production belts whizzing past me, the rhythmic pressure of the hydraulic presses echoing from every direction. From my peripheral vision, I noticed my peers’ hands moving faster than mine. Is this normal?

 

“Worker 118!” The voice behind me shrieked. I turned and saw my manager’s face.

 

“Sir. What seems to be the problem?”

 

Something stirred in me. I’ve been wrong before, very wrong, and punished for it. But this time, the feeling was different.

 

“Your rate of production has been slowing since yesterday. Continue like this, and you’ll be moved to a new position.”

 

“I’m sorry, sir,” I replied. A shiver crawled up my spine. Am I angry at my manager?

 

“Don’t be sorry. Do better. And what is that on your hands? That’s not factory policy. Take those off. I never want to see them again. Now, continue your obligations.”

 

I turned back to my station, palms slick with sweat. I couldn’t tell if it came from the gloves or the confrontation. The next yellow cone drifted past; I grabbed it and recoiled from the heat, but forced myself not to compromise the system’s efficiency. The system must continue, no matter my thoughts.

 

I picked up speed. One done. Two done. Three done. Four done.

 

Then, from the far end of the wing, I heard it, the violent bellow of a fan. A stack of papers lifted into the air like a flock of white birds. All conveyor belts shuddered to a halt.

 

And then I looked up.

 

High above the production lines, perched on the metal framework near the factory roof, somewhere I had never bothered to look, I saw it. A small bluebird. Its wings tucked neatly into its feathers, its head sharp and alert, its legs gripping the steel beam with delicate precision.

 

I felt something calm, almost gentle. I shouldn’t feel that. Not here. Not in the factory. I lowered my gaze slowly, wondering if any of my peers had noticed this moment of beauty, but their faces were glued to the production line, the one that had ceased moving 5 minutes ago. Their faces seemed as though they were weighed down by the mass of an elephant, their skin having a grey tint to it, almost as if it was mirroring the walls they worked in. I heard a screech, and the belt rumbled to life. I continued with my job, now slower than my peers, but I wonder if this even matters.

 

**Shift 4**

 

It’s the beginning of a new day, and I take my post at the station. My hands hover over the yellow cones, but I can’t bring myself to start working, not yet. That would be too easy, too mechanical. Yesterday’s encounter with the bird keeps replaying in my mind. If a single bird could make me stop and notice, what else do I fail to see every day?

 

I look around the wing, slowly. On the far side is the centre of the factory, where all our living quarters are clustered. I’ve walked past it countless times without noticing anything beyond its walls. On the side closest to me, at the far end of the wing terminal, there is… nothing. At first. Then my eyes wander upward, along the steel framework, past the belts and pipes, until I see a faint light on the fourth story.

 

It flickers, steady, purposeful. No one is meant to be up there; all workers are meant to be at their stations. My chest tightens. The light seems wrong, dangerous even. Curiosity claws at me, but so does fear. If someone notices my attention wandering… I could be relocated. Punished. And yet, I cannot look away.

 

I take a slow breath. My mind begins to imagine the room behind that light: a balcony, perhaps, shelves or desks, papers stacked neatly. Who could be up there? High management? Or someone else, hidden from view? The possibilities swirl, each one heavier than the last. My heart beats faster. My hands tighten around the cones.

 

A shadow crosses my peripheral vision. The manager from yesterday is approaching, his steps heavy and deliberate. Panic flares. I bend instinctively, pretending to work, but my eyes keep darting toward the fourth story. My thoughts jumble: obey, don’t question, stay silent. And yet… what is really up there?

 

“Sir?” My voice trembles. I did not intend to speak, but it slipped out anyway.

 

“What is your question, Worker 118?” The tone is sharp, impatient.

 

“I… I was wondering,” I falter, pointing upward toward the light, “what that light is up there?”

 

“That,” he snaps, eyes narrowing, “is high management. And you will be heading up there if you don’t start production now!”

 

I nod quickly, bending to pick up the cone. My fingers are sweaty. The hum of the machines presses in around me. My mind, though, keeps returning to the fourth story, to the room and its light. High management… they assign our jobs, control our routines. Maybe, just maybe, they could make gloves part of protocol. Perhaps they could improve life here, even slightly.

 

I start placing the cones again, slower this time. Every motion is measured. My eyes flick toward the light once more. My heart still races. Fear, curiosity, hope, they all swirl together. I realize I am thinking in ways I was never meant to. And yet… I cannot stop.

 

**Shift 5**

 

Instead of going directly to my post in the morning, I made a diversion, a deliberate detour to the office of high management. I walked past my unmanned post, leaving it bare, and stepped into the metal-covered hallways of the factory. Each footstep echoed off the walls, and my chest tightened as I approached a sector I had never dared to enter. My pulse quickened. My hand itched with both curiosity and fear.

 

Ahead stood a large green door. In the centre, a gold label declared: “Head Office of Defence Production Sector.” Defence? I thought, trying to steady my breath. Defence from what? My palm felt slick, my heart hammering as I raised it to knock, but before I could make a sound, the door swung open.

 

“Worker! What are you doing in the restricted area?!” a guard I had never seen yelled. His uniform was the same deep green as the door, crisp and stiff, topped with an officer’s hat. My stomach twisted.

 

“I… I’m here to consult high management about an important observation I made,” I said, my voice shaking. I gestured to my journal, hoping it lent weight to my words.

 

The guard muttered under his breath, a reflective tone hanging over him like a gathering storm. “I told him this would be bad,” he said quietly.

 

“Well, come on in then,” he added, almost sarcastically, stepping aside. My chest still raced, but I forced myself to move forward, one hesitant step at a time.

 

I stepped into the forbidden sector, and my world was overwhelmed by luxury, gold lights on the walls, a velvet red carpet lined the floor, and green wallpaper added a feeling of unbelonging and distrust to the wide corridor. I fell in line behind the guard, clenching my journal close to my chest, walking past open rooms. I ducked my gaze, hoping the figures would not notice me.

 

At the end of the hallway, a massive brass door loomed. The guard raised his fist and knocked sharply.

 

“Sir! You have a visitor!” he called, his voice tight with a mixture of duty and something I couldn’t name.

 

The door swung open slowly, as if powered by invisible motors. My stomach knotted tighter. A man appeared — large, imposing, his presence filling the room. A cigar rested between his fingers, smoke curling lazily into the air. Before him stood a gold-plated table, gleaming under the lights, reflecting the room’s opulence.

 

“What… what is this dirt…” he began, stopping mid-thought. His eyes narrowed on me.

 

“What is this valued worker doing in my office?” His long face stretched into an uncomfortable, calculated smile. My chest tightened, my grip on the journal faltering slightly, but I forced myself to stand tall.

 

“I have a delegation to make, sir!” he then proceeded to look at my little red journal and then back to me.

 

“Well, in that case, why did you not speak to your manager about it?” he said, a sense of judgment and annoyance echoed off the green walls.

 

“I think it's too important… It's something I think can really improve our efficacy.” Instead of being met with understanding or curiosity, the man’s face grew more irritated.

 

“Efficiency! And what do you know about efficiency, standing there hours on end doing the same thing you do every single day?” he snapped out of what seemed to be pure anger. I felt a strange feeling, not of disappointment in myself but…

 

Before I could even complete my thought, a command blared into my sights, “Take this filth to the loading port. He can mop the floors for the next week! Understand you piece of worthless trash?”

 

“Yes, sir,” I reply, slightly shaken at this adverse response.

 

As I get escorted out, my head begins to throb. How can he do this? I think to myself, my idea did not even get out, and I was rejected, and now I’m stuck cleaning the most isolated place in this joint! I didn't even realize it, but I was clenching my fists so tightly that I left a mark on my palms until I had to clasp the handrail going down the stairs, my head heavy with thoughts. Why would someone who built an empire on efficacy seem reluctant, even opposed, to implementing purposeful change for the benefit of the whole? Is it arrogance, or something deeper? We are encouraged to write what we feel in journals and document it, yet when we try to speak our own, we get shut down, well, not everyone so far, I think it’s just me, but why me?

 

I froze and had a slight moment of distress.

 

I must have been deeper in thought than I realized. I’d wandered far beyond my usual sector.

 

The hallway around me had changed entirely: tall metal walls stretched upward until they vanished into the shadows, held together by hundreds of thousands of bolts. Thick steel beams criss-crossed overhead like the ribs of a mechanical giant. The silence pressed against my ears.

 

No workers. No footsteps. No machinery.

 

Nothing.

 

I walked cautiously. These corridors were wider, colder, built for something other than human movement. Then something in the distance caught my eye, a huge circular shape draped in a white sheet.

 

I hesitated. I shouldn’t touch anything here. If someone saw me… But there was no one. Not here. Not in these forgotten hallways.

 

I stepped forward, grabbed the edge of the sheet, and pulled. Dust exploded upward, settling around my boots. Beneath the cloth stood a massive, round structure with symbols I hadn’t seen since my schooling years.

 

A clock.

 

The word surfaced slowly, like something dredged from deep water. I squinted, trying to remember how to read it. After a moment of fumbling, memory returned.

 

I flipped urgently to the back of my journal. The page marked “Daily Order” was always assumed to mean tasks. But the numbers… the sequence…

 

“Oh,” I whispered. “It’s a timetable.”

 

Wake up.

 

Go to the mess hall.

 

Report to the station.

 

Each step had a number beside it.

 

I looked back at the giant clock: 1:00.

 

Then at the entry in my book: 1:20, Go to Mess Hall (Lunch).

 

I hadn’t missed lunch at all.

 

With the timetable revelation pounding in my skull, I pushed deeper into the factory’s skeleton. The air grew colder, the metal darker. Pipes and beams twisted overhead like the veins of some industrial creature. I kept walking, faster, as if distance alone could explain what I’d just learned.

 

 

 

Eventually, a shape emerged from the dimness, a massive steel door. The paint on it had blistered and peeled until it resembled old, flaking skin. I could barely read the faded letters, but the word formed slowly as my eyes adjusted:

 

MESS HALL.

 

The paint must’ve been older than I was. Maybe older than the entire current workforce.

 

I tried the handle.

 

Nothing.

 

I pushed.

 

Nothing.

 

I pulled harder, metal grinding against metal. Years of rust had welded the door into its frame. The strain in my arms turned sharp, then dull, then sharp again. I was seconds from giving up from admitting defeat at the door when something finally gave.

 

A loud, wet pop broke the silence. The door tore loose from the rust’s grip, groaning as it swung open. I stepped inside.

 

The room that unfolded before me was instantly recognizable and completely wrong. This was the same mess hall I walked to every day, but it usually took half an hour to reach. Thirty minutes of winding corridors, crowds, blocked intersections, managers monitoring movement, workers lining up like cattle.

 

But through the skeleton corridors, it had taken me… what? Minutes?

 

The place was empty now, stripped of noise and bodies. Rows of steel tables stretched into the distance like an abandoned cafeteria for ghosts. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, flickering weakly. Without the usual sea of workers, the room felt enormous. Too enormous.

 

It hit me in a single, clean thought:

 

The factory isn’t built to be efficient.

 

It’s built to control movement.

 

The long paths, the packed traffic lines, the waiting, the supervision, none of it was necessary. There were shortcuts everywhere, whole arteries of the building that no one used. And they weren’t locked. They were simply forgotten.

 

Or deliberately hidden.

 

A breath caught in my throat.

 

For the first time, I wasn’t sure if I was discovering the truth…or trespassing into something the system needed me not to see.

 

But, I couldn’t, couldn’t leave my peers and deviate from what has been in place since the day I got the job, no, that will be far too ambiguous, people will see, notice the change taking hold in me, I will become useless to my own peers and then what good am I…inside these walls?
