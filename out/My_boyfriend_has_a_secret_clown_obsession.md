I don't know what to do and he's going be here any minute now.

I'll start with a little bit of background about me, I'm a gay man, 25 years old, and I've been living with my boyfriend for the past year or so. We've been together for over two years now and I moved into his house after 9 months that we've been together.

My boyfriend (I'm giving him a fake name) Dave is 33 years old and he came from a fairly rich family who he is no longer in contact with since he came out so I never got the chance to meet them, but he still has a lot of their money. One of his biggest hobbies is wine collecting which I assume he can only afford due to his family wealth, so our house has a fairly big wine cellar down in the basement.

Today, my boyfriend, who works in some behind the scenes stuff in the entertainment industry (I never really understood what it is that he does) went for work just like he usually does. I'm a bit sick so I took a sick day today and didn't go to my work. I stayed at home alone. Dave asked me to clean his wine cellar to which I happily volunteered because I love helping him with stuff.

So around 3pm I went down to the wine cellar to help clean it and holy hell, it is dirtier than I've ever seen it! It's very dusty, super smelly, and since the lights no longer work I had to use my phone's flashlight while cleaning. So I started mopping when I realised something was off about the wall facing away from the staircase. 

I didn't go down to the wine cellar that often because honestly, I couldn't care less about wine outside of drinking it here and there. Still, I've been down here a few times in the past and I have never noticed that before. I went closer to see what was off but I still couldn't tell. I placed my hand on the wall and immediately I was startled. A part of the wall pushed forward.

I don't know what I found more disturbing, the fact that our house has a hidden door in the wine cellar or the music I heard the second the door opened. It was this loud cheerful music you'd expect to hear at a circus, along with this muffled grunting noise that sounded distressingly close. The music faded down after 10 seconds and I opened the door further to see what was on the other side of the wine cellar.

The room was round and looked like a circus tent built out of wood. The floor and ceiling had this spiraling pattern of red and yellow, while the walls had vertical lines that used the same color pattern. There were a few doors around the room and each door was painted a different color: one door was painted light blue, another was painted green, there was a dark red door,  an orange one, and a door painted with all of those colors combined. The door I came in from was painted white. It slammed behind me as I entered the room in a sound that made me jump in  place.

On the other side of the room from where I now stood there was a wooden make-up table which was badly painted pink. I have never seen Dave wear make-up before. Hell, I've never heard him talk about this place at all!

On the make up table were a few make up products, but they weren't beauty products. It was clown make-up. There was also a blue wig and a blue-ish red-ish clown suit thrown on the floor near the table.

On a different part of this rounded wall was a photo hanging on the wall of a weird fat clown wearing a white & red costume and a scary expression on his face. text smeared in white face paint under the photo read: ALL HAIL POGO THE CLOWN. 

I found this to be the most disturbing thing here because Pogo was Dave's nickname for me. He often called me his sweet Pogo. Was Pogo the name of this clown?

I wanted to open a door. I wanted to see what was behind each door. Do their colors mean anything? Where do they lead? And why is one of the doors colored rainbow? I didn't even know if I can bring myself to open one of these doors, if I even wanted to find out what's behind them. Panicked, I was contemplating what to do for a few minutes when my cellphone rang. Dave.

"Hey babe, I'm just now on my way home from work. Did you finish with the wine cellar?"

I panicked and answered yes as I headed towards the white door from where I came. I can't stay here much longer, my boyfriend's workplace is only a thirty minute drive from home.

With my phone still up to my ear, I put my hand on the door handle. As I turned to open it, a sense of horror washed all the way through me. The music. 
It must've just been my anxiety, but the circus music felt even louder than before. I knew there was no way he didn't hear it just now. He asked me what it was.

"Oh, just something on TV", I lied, trying to mask my fear under a calm, sensible voice.

He didn't respond. The silence stood between us for way too long. Even though I have never been a religious man, I prayed to God for it to stop. 'Please Dave, say something already' I thought.

"By the way, did you do dinner? I am starving" Dave said

Shit. I forgot dinner. Even though I didn't have a reason to, I lied again,

"Oh, I figured we'd just order something"

How could I forget dinner? Usually I'd say the truth but I already lied to him just now, and the idea of giving him something to be angry about didn't seem like a good idea now.

"Alright, love you Pogo" Dave said before he hung up. Hear that name made me want to throw up.

Right now I'm sitting on the couch in the living room, my heartbeat still hasn't gone back to normal. I searched 'Pogo the clown' on Google to try and find at least some answers. I thought maybe it's a sex thing but me and Dave's sex life has always been pretty tame, nothing weird like that. Nothing clown-related... 

Apparently there was a gay man in the 70s who called himself Pogo the clown who killed and raped  dozens of boys. His real name was John Wayne Gacy, like the actor John Wayne.

As I was writing this I remembered a time about two months ago we talked about adopting a kid and Dave said that if he were ever to have a boy, he'd want to name him John. 

Fuck, I can hear the keys twisting in the front door. I have to go. If you have a way to help me, please do. I don't know what to do.
