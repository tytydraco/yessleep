[Part one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/minp0r/i_work_at_a_supernatural_lab_our_vaccines_are/)  
As I made my way down the steps, I heard snuffling and grunting all around me; none of the rabbit-looking demons attacked, which had me more worried than facing down a horde of them. They wanted me and/or Annya to finish the sick ritual needed to open the gateway to whatever world we had pulled the first devil from. For them to be keeping to the shadows meant they were waiting for something, or they were afraid of me, and I found that highly unlikely.

&#x200B;

The way back to Annya was filled with broken eggs and smelled like death. There had to be enough eggshells lying around for hundreds of demon bunnies. I was crazy going back for her; even though we had only really started talking last night before this all started, I knew she was my soulmate. And there was no way I was letting those damn dirty rabbits get a hand on her.

&#x200B;

I heard gunshots on the floor below me, and I couldn’t believe my ears; how had anyone else survived this mini apocalypse?

&#x200B;

“Hello?” I yelled, hoping it was an ally and not a rabbit.

&#x200B;

An explosion blew the stairwell door across the small space, had I not been above the landing I’d have died right there. Even with that bit of luck, my ears were ringing, and I couldn’t catch a breath from the concussion wave that hit me. I wheezed and coughed up dust sucked in from the surrounding air. Peering through the dirty air swirling around me, I saw movement in the smoke and fog of the explosion. In the pale light, I saw what looked like a human shape stagger toward me.

&#x200B;

“Hey, are you ok?” I yelled again, this time because of the ringing in my ears.

&#x200B;

I walked down a couple of steps thinking the person needed help. As it got closer, the debris in the air settled, and I fell backward as the shadow cleared to show a demon rabbit coated in matted bloody fur lunging at me. Before it could land on my prone body, it froze like someone had pulled on its leash like a dog owner would do to an over-eager pup. Next, I saw a new blood spot appear on the creature at what should have been its heart. It grew and grew until I saw the blade of a samurai sword appear.

&#x200B;

Covered in runes of an ancient and as far as I knew dead language, it sliced the rabbit in two. The blade had moved up from the bloody spot, and the rabbit fell to the side of me, both parts melting like chocolate in the sun. Through the smoke, a hand covered in the leather of a glove reached down and helped me up. That hand was connected to a massive hulk of a man, ebony like the sword he carried.

&#x200B;

“Hey, sorry about that sir, we let one get past us.” the soldier smiled at me, and that smile made me feel like I finally had a chance to end this mess and rescue Annya. “By the way, my name is Sergeant Johnson, Z to my friends.”

&#x200B;

His smile was infectious, and I smiled back at him.

&#x200B;

“I’m John Smith, I work here.” I walked behind him through the blasted doorway. “Just John to people who save my life.

&#x200B;

“Sergeant, looks like you found a friend?” A serious-looking fellow as tall as Zion and almost as well-built was in front of us.

&#x200B;

He was wearing a Major’s gold leaf and carrying a pistol nearly as big as my head.

&#x200B;

“Nearly let one of the demons get him, Major Halsinge.” Zion saluted and sheathed his rune sword on his back.

&#x200B;

“Major Halsinge,” I shook his outstretched hand. “John Smith, as I told your Sergeant I work here,” I stopped for a second considering what I was seeing. “Are you part of the rescue team? You got here far too fast to be them.”

&#x200B;

“You can call me Roger” He smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes, he had seen too much to feel that smile as a real emotion. “No, sir, we are a special unit that gets sent into situations that the normal military can’t handle.”

&#x200B;

“How did you get in here?” I asked, finally seeing the rest of the team assembled around me. “The base is on lockdown, if you got in, the demons could get out.”

&#x200B;

As if on cue, one of the damned rabbits jumped out of the dark. No one saw him but me, so I did something I had never done before in front of strangers or even close friends.

&#x200B;

“Infernus propello” A stream of fire raced out from my outstretched hand and blasted the rabbit backward as it also, reducing it to ash.

&#x200B;

“What the hell.” Instead of being grateful, the team all started pointing weapons at me.

&#x200B;

“Woah…, Woah guys…, ease… up.” I held my hands up. I was gasping for air and the words coming out of my mouth sounded horse, like I had taken a shot of strong whiskey. “I… just… saved… your life.”

&#x200B;

I pointed at the roasted rabbit behind the Major.

&#x200B;

“What are you, an Ancient demon?” Major Roger asked me. He had the giant pistol pointed straight at my head.

&#x200B;

An ancient demon is rare, and most that have been seen can take the shape of a normal human but have powers, kind of like what I had just done.

&#x200B;

“No Major, … … I am… still… human” I put my hands down slowly as my breathing started returning to normal. The group lowered their weapons cautiously. “I am… one of… the last…, as far… as … I know, …practicing wizards. My family… traces back… to Merlin.”

&#x200B;

“Merlin, The wizard from King Arthur?” Johnson looked at me skeptically.

&#x200B;

“Every myth has a… kernel of truth.” I shrugged, still struggling to get my lungs to behave.

&#x200B;

“So if you are a wizard, why are you loaded up with all the guns?” the Major asked.

&#x200B;

“Casting magic is like running… a marathon.” I start explaining, man, I need to start working out more… “The more you do it, … the more tired you become.”

&#x200B;

“You look half dead. Is it that hard to do it? “ A female whose name tag read Mayfield eyed me like I would fall down.

&#x200B;

I was embarrassed now. Here I just pulled off what should have been an awe-inspiring feat, and the team was questioning my stamina.

&#x200B;

OK, I believe you mostly, but we don’t have time for any more questions.” Roger spreads a map out on a desk. “We must stop these demons from opening a gate and letting something worse in.”

&#x200B;

“Are any of you virgins?” I blurted out.

&#x200B;

They all turned to look at me like I had a second head.

&#x200B;

“Why would you ask that?” A man who had been watching the periphery asked.

&#x200B;

I squinted at the man’s name patch, it said Warner.

&#x200B;

“I asked, mister Warner” He interrupted me.

&#x200B;

“Sergeant Major Warner.” He said.

&#x200B;

“Sergeant Major Warner.” I corrected. “Because the Rabbits need a virgin to open the gate, which they’ve already built in the basement level.”

&#x200B;

“Shit.” Warner and the Major exclaimed at the same time.

&#x200B;

I wasn’t certain if it was because they were just learning about the gate being prepared or if they both were virgins. Major Roger started gathering the building diagram and other stuff lying on the table.

&#x200B;

“Alright, people, we have to move it” He looked at me for a second. “Mister wizard here is now our guide. Dr. Smith, please show us to the basement.”

&#x200B;

I laughed, but not because of the joke he’d made.

&#x200B;

“Are you all idiots?” I looked at each member of the team. “I just told you they are looking for a virgin to open the gate, and you still want to rush down there? Besides, I am going nowhere until I get my g…, um my colleague to safety.”

&#x200B;

I thought I had narrowly missed letting them know that Annya was more than just a fellow worker, but one of the ladies in the team snickered, and I knew I was caught.

&#x200B;

“You are putting the lives of the entire world in danger over one person?” Halsinge’s look could have melted steel. “Do you think that is the right thing to do, John?”

&#x200B;

“Yes, I do because of two reasons; one, Annya is a virgin, and if the demons get her, they will have that gate open long before we can stop them,” I paused to let that sink in. “Two, I love her, and I made a promise that I would rescue her and protect her from them, even if I have to give them what they want by letting them take me.”

&#x200B;

They didn’t at first understand that last part of my explanation, but then I saw the light go on Roger’s eyes.

&#x200B;

“Ah, I see now,” He looked at me with a real smile in his eyes. “Alright, people, if we can’t help someone who made a promise to his soul mate, then we need to quit trying to save the world.” Turning to face his team fully, he said, “Everyone make one last equipment check, and we will head out.

&#x200B;

“Also, we only have…” I looked at my watch again, “30 minutes to get to Annya and get out of here before the Firm nukes the place.”

&#x200B;

“You could have led with that tidbit of news,” He barked his orders to the team. “Ok people, double time; let's get that virgin girlfriend and get out of here before we all glow in the dark.”

&#x200B;

Snickers escaped the soldiers’ lips as they readied to blitz the stairwell. Ten minutes later, we were heading back down the stairs toward u-20, the level I left Annya at. Since the cat was out of the bag, I pulled out my old tome of magic. Yes, wizards really do have books of magic spells. Do you really think we memorize them all?

&#x200B;

I found the spell for a barrier, and as we passed each door, I chalked the rune and laid just enough eldritch energy into it to keep the doors closed long after we passed. The energy I was expending wasn’t a lot, but it was still causing me a headache the size of Maine. That is why I didn’t see the demon in the shadow of the door I had just opened.

&#x200B;

“Dr. Smith, look out.” Someone pushed me down and away from the evil spawn of the Easter bunny, and I heard a scream before I could right myself. One of the team, I think her name was Asoka, had put herself between me and the demon. It tore her to shreds before any of the other team could react.

&#x200B;

Cursing my slowness, I cast a spell of power, a power I had not used before. “Astra Levis Plodere!” I saw the matted monster rise from its victim and compress into a squishy, gooey ball before I passed out from releasing that much energy.

&#x200B;

Standing in a funnel of light, I heard distant sounds that might have been people and growls from around me in the dark.

&#x200B;

“Wizard, you are messing with powers you cannot possibly win against” another cone of light illuminated a Nightmare.

&#x200B;

I vaguely knew who or what I was seeing. It was one of the gatekeepers between the dimensions, a malivaldan, and this one seemed familiar.

&#x200B;

“Joey?” Every one of the Malivaldan liked to pick names from TV shows on earth. I can think of worse things they could do, I guess.

&#x200B;

“Hello Wizard, once again you darken my part of the multidimensional plane,” He bowed slightly, “I did not think I would see you again after your near-death experience in the Grey last time.”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, this trip is not my idea either, Joey,” I grimaced; even in my astral form, my head was pounding.

&#x200B;

“Judging by the boom you made when you popped in, I would say you expended some tremendous eldritch energy to rip a portal open that violently.” If Malivaldans could smirk, I would think Joey would have the biggest one his race had ever seen right now.

&#x200B;

“I was trying to save a young lady, but I just made a mess of things, as you can see.” Strangely, I wasn’t exhausted this time.

&#x200B;

Maybe the transfer to the Grey kept me from the physical exhaustion I normally felt after doing that kind of magic. Joey glitched, fading in and out, or perhaps it was me; never can tell in the Grey.

&#x200B;

“It seems your time here is soon ended, Wizard.” The Malivaldan looked around like he was making sure we were alone. “Wizard, take this wisdom with you before you fade back to your dimension. Those demons, who bear the shape of the gentle rabbit, are trying to open a gate that can never be so. It leads to a dimension housing a being trapped there for eternity; if it escapes, the infection the evil carries will destroy all other dimensions; you must not let this happen.”

&#x200B;

We are trying, Joey, we are trying.” Darkness drew across my eyes, and a loud boom sounded.

&#x200B;

I sat up to see a new nightmare, and this one wasn’t named Joey. All around me was chaos, explosions, and gunfire. Beside me was the warrior who had laid their life down for me. I closed her eyes and stood, taking in all that was transpiring.

&#x200B;

“Infernus ORA!” I released fireball after fireball at the creatures surrounding the fire team. Once again, I noticed that I wasn’t tiring as much as I usually do.

&#x200B;

It was strange, but I didn’t have time now to figure out why. Fading flames were eventually all that remained of the demons that attacked while I was in the Grey. A soldier whose name was Reynolds kneeled down beside the brave person who saved me.

&#x200B;

“Ah Alisa, what did you do, my love?” He bowed his head as tears rolled from his eyes and made the sign of the cross as he laid her rifle across her chest. “We will return to take you home, I promise.”

&#x200B;

“He and she were getting along, I think they were even dating behind my back.” Looking over, I see Roger’s eyes glistening with unshed tears, the loss of a teammate, and I believe a friend, too much to keep his iron wall of command in place.

&#x200B;

“I am sorry, I am not worthy of her sacrifice. I should have been the one to face the demon's claws.” I could not meet his gaze, my eyes lowered to the ground. “Maybe it would have stopped when it realized I was the prize they sought?”

&#x200B;

He put a hand on my shoulder and stared at me until I felt the power of it and looked back up. “She knew the risks every time we come out on a mission. Doubt never has an answer, and it cheapens what she did. So, stop with the self-recrimination and remember to thank her when we join her in whatever passes as a warrior’s paradise.”

&#x200B;

I shook my head in understanding and kneeled down beside her still form. “Thank you, Alisa; I promise not to waste the chance you have given me.”

&#x200B;

Reynolds raised his head, “You better not Doc, she will haunt you, and I will kill you myself if you do.”

&#x200B;

“I understand. Now step back so I can protect her body for our return.” He stepped away, and I drew a circle around her with chalk I used for emergency spell work. “Custodia de omnis”

&#x200B;

With that, I poured some of my eldritch energy into the circle, and ozone filled the air.

&#x200B;

“What was that Mister Wizard?” Reynolds looked ready to shoot me and leave beside his dead girlfriend.

&#x200B;

“I placed a guardian spell to protect her from the rabbit demons.” That mollified him for now.

&#x200B;

“Ok people let’s go. The sooner we get to our other scientist, the faster we can get this wrapped up.” Major Halsinge gathered his team, and we started down into the basement levels of the complex.

&#x200B;

More of those damned Easter-colored eggs lined the stairwell and landings; instead of shooting them, we started clubbing them with anything we found that would work. Z’s ebony sword worked well, slice them up like a hibachi chief at a fancy Japanese restaurant. I had found a piece of pipe and worked out some frustration any time an egg was near me. The rest used a variety of knives, and short swords with runes and other magic worked into them.

&#x200B;

“I have to ask where did you get all these magical artifacts?” I looked over at the Major. “I thought standing orders are to turn all artifacts over to our lab?”

&#x200B;

“Things that the eggheads…” He paused for a second “Sorry doc no offense”

&#x200B;

“None taken,” I said.

&#x200B;

“Anyhow, they will send us stuff that has been cleared and is deemed useful in our duties.” He brandished a golden short sword that seemed to glow from within.

&#x200B;

All the bladed weapons looked deadly beautiful and made my lowly pipe mundane. Not to be outdone, I scratched some runes of protection and fire on my pipe and filled it with energy. It glowed purple, and blue flames licked the upper part of it.

&#x200B;

“Impressive Wizard, impressive.” The Major shook his head with a brief smile, and we kept going down the stairs.

&#x200B;

Even with all the scrambled eggs, we left in our wake, we did not slow our pace. We soon came to the floor where Annya was trapped. Slowly, Z opened the door, and we filed into the hallway in a tight tactical formation. Down the hall from where we came in, we could see a large video panel with the words “Please Hurry” flashing red on its screen.

&#x200B;

“That’s my Annya; she’s probably been watching this door the whole time I was gone,” I beamed.

&#x200B;

“That’s cute and all, but let's hope that doesn’t turn into a big ‘Hey Dinners this way’ sign.” Perin Akar, the team hacker, grimaced.

&#x200B;

“Sorry,” flashed on the screen and the display went dark.

&#x200B;

“Well, she is definitely a smart one; she was listening to us as well as watching,” Warner smiled as he slowly opened an unlocked door to check for demons hiding.

&#x200B;

“Stay sharp, people; those damn demonic bunnies could be anywhere.” Major Halsinge warned.

&#x200B;

Silently we moved down the hall, everyone tense and sweating in the heat of the hall since the AC had stopped on this level for some reason.

&#x200B;

“Well, they should feel at home; it is hot as hell in here,” Mayfield whispered.

&#x200B;

“Silence people.” The major chastised.

&#x200B;

Soon we reached the turn in the hall, having checked all the unlocked doors along the way. As we rounded the turn and spied the door to Annya’s hiding spot, a bad feeling crept up my neck. Behind us, all the locked doors including the one to Annya’s security station swung open, and rabbit demons poured out.

&#x200B;

“Ambush!” yelled Z, as we were overwhelmed by fur and claws.

&#x200B;

Something hit me, and blackness came calling once again.

&#x200B;

Light edged out the dark eventually, and I open my eyes to a new location. I looked and realized the pipes, and the dripping water meant we were in the lab basement, the same basement with the… Gate.

&#x200B;

“Oh Shit,” I struggled to get up and found I was bound by my wrists to a pipe, which actually helped me get up to a sitting position. Once I was vertical again, I looked around to see all the Major’s team were also bound to pipes and were coming to.

&#x200B;

“Hey, John, is this where I think it is?” Roger loud whispered to me.

&#x200B;

“Yes, unfortunately.” I looked around, “Does anyone see the gate or Annya?”

&#x200B;

Zion looked at me and pointed with his head to a bend only he could see around. “Next room Doc she is strapped down, unclothed, to the floor, and from this angle, I can see the markings of something under her body.”

&#x200B;

“Damn those rabbits.” I prayed that they had only removed her outer clothing like before and nothing more had happened to her. “Is she moving?”

&#x200B;

“Yes, Doc, she is struggling mightily to get loose from the ropes they used to bind her.” He said.

&#x200B;

I banged my head on the pipe behind me, as I said out loud. “Come on, John, you can get out of this; those stupid rabbits can’t beat us.

&#x200B;

Racking my brain, I finally thought of a spell that wouldn’t kill me and would get me loose from these bindings.

&#x200B;

“Serpens fibrosus qui me tenet putrescere!” I felt the rope flake away to dust, and my hands were free. I grabbed the Major’s knife and cut him loose, “I am going for Annya; you get the rest of your team free.”

&#x200B;

“No wait” He hissed at me, but I wasn’t listening; all I could see in my mind was those rabbits hurting my Annya. In hindsight, I wish I had obeyed, things would have been easier.

&#x200B;

Crouching, I rushed around the corner, picking up a pistol and knife from the pile of weapons the rabbits had helpfully dumped on a low shelf across from me. I continued to Annya on the floor. Sliding down beside her, I started cutting the bonds that held her limbs to the gate sigil.

&#x200B;

“Sorry, Annya, that I wasn’t faster getting to you” I smiled a little, trying to calm her.

&#x200B;

“Hell of a date night, John; what do we do for an encore?” Surprised at her calmness, I saw a small smile form on her tense face. “I knew you would save me.”

&#x200B;

“We aren’t out of this yet, my love.” I grabbed her hand and helped her up from the sigil.

&#x200B;

At this point, the demons decided to come out and start their ritual. I fired on them until the gun ran dry. I scratched a rune into the barrel with the knife and used the bottom edge of the handle to do the same to the knife. Handing the knife to Annya, I started firing on the rabbits again, but this time it wasn’t bullets but eldritch constructs of flame and energy. Every demon that I hit burst into flames and turned to ash immediately.

&#x200B;

To our side, more rabbit demons poured from a door, and Annya started slashing and stabbing them like the knife was another extension of her arm. Every rabbit she cut or stabbed burst into flame from the eldritch energy I infused into the runes I scratched in the blade. For a moment, we held our own, but soon we were pressed on all sides. Just as we were about to say our last words to each other, bullets, and explosions ripped through the throng of demonic Lepus.

&#x200B;

“Hey, Doc, stay down. We’ll make us some rabbit stew, huh?” Zion was laughing as he blasted layer after layer of demons packed tight around us.

&#x200B;

“No problem Z,” I yelled over the gunfire as we ducked down.

&#x200B;

All the monsters turned to attack the major’s team and hem us in at the same time. As my new friends decimated the demons, one bastard turned around and stared at us like a creeper.

&#x200B;

“What are you looking at, you fuck?” I raised my rune-coated pistol, but I was so tired I was uncertain if I could actually pour the energy into the runes to generate the “ammunition”.

&#x200B;

I had to hope the beast would think I could fire it. As the other demons were cut to ribbons, the rabbit seem to decide something. With a speed, I could not counter, it lashed out with its claws and scratched both of us before we could back away from the savage swing. I looked down, realizing the bastard had done what we had tried so hard to prevent, as my blood and Annya’s splashed down on the gate sigil.

&#x200B;

“Son of a Bitch” I screamed as my gun lit up and a single fireball driven by my emotions lashed out and blasted the demon and about three more behind it to ash.

&#x200B;

Blood magic doesn’t mean that you need all the blood of the virgin; all that is really needed is a catalyst of life force to start the process that the sigil was designed to create. As drops of our blood hit the sigil, it surged with power from the stored potency of life in every drop.

&#x200B;

“Annya run. We got to run before we… It was too late; the gate opened with an explosion of concussive force, propelling us and the tightly packed demons away from the newly open dimensional gate.

&#x200B;

Just as the force dissipated, a new problem appeared. The wind picked up, pulling everything near the gate into it.

&#x200B;

“Major, get your team away from here.” I looked at him as they struggled to regain their footing. “The gate must have opened on a world that has less air, or gods’ forbid a black hole.”

&#x200B;

“How do we close it?” He yelled over the roaring of the maelstrom.

&#x200B;

Just as I started to tell him I have no idea, something appeared at the gate. Z and the Major saw the new guests to the party as soon as I did. They raised their rifles and started to pull the trigger.

&#x200B;

“Stop!” I yelled “Joey?”

&#x200B;

The gate guardian I knew as a sort of friend was standing in the middle of the hurricane-speed winds like it was a cool breeze.

&#x200B;

“Wizard, what have you done?” He asked without any condemnation.

&#x200B;

“Wasn’t me, Joey, these damn rabbits started this.” I pointed at the few demons that had not been dragged into the portal on the initial opening.

&#x200B;

“No matter, wizard, we need to close this now.” He sounded irritated at me. Dammit, I wasn’t the one to blame here.

&#x200B;

I wanted to protest, but now was not the time.

&#x200B;

“What do we do, Joey?” I asked without snarking at him.

&#x200B;

“I do not know, this portal is resisting my urging for its closure.” He looked at the scorched cement below his feet. “This sigil, what powered it?”

&#x200B;

“Blood, the blood of virgins,” I said embarrassed.

&#x200B;

“Are the virgins here still?” He looked around for, I suspected, was something that looked like a virgin. “Also, what is a virgin?”

&#x200B;

Mayfield snickered, and I could see others in the team holding back laughter.

&#x200B;

“Can it soldier.” Roger had a twinkle in his eyes, and I knew he also was only seconds from laughing himself.

&#x200B;

Tense, stressful moments like these sometimes bring opposite emotions to what you would expect at the world's end. I even heard Annya laugh a little embarrassed laugh.

&#x200B;

Standing beside me, she whispered in my ear. “Had you asked me out sooner, this wouldn’t have been an issue.” She said, a wickedly lovely smile on her face, partly seriously and partly seductively.

&#x200B;

“Ugh hum…” I was so red in the face, I am sure I was glowing. “We are the virgins, Annya and I. One of the demons cut us, and our drops of blood opened the gate.

&#x200B;

“Only drops?” The Maldivian looked like it was happy about this. “The sigil will burn out soon then. The dimension it is connected to cannot be equalized without large amounts of blood.

&#x200B;

“So how long until it closes?” Z asked.

&#x200B;

“I would say…” Joey screeched or yelled, but I couldn’t make it out. Whatever he said must have been in his tongue.

&#x200B;

“Joey, we don’t speak Maldivian!” I yelled, holding my still-ringing ears.

&#x200B;

“Sorry, um, how about the rotation of your earth from the start to finish of that lovely show about six people who live together in one of your domiciles?” Maldivians find our dimension interesting, particularly our TV shows, and now I had to remember some comedy I didn’t watch to know how long before we die.

&#x200B;

“You mean Friends?” Akar asked.

&#x200B;

“Yes, yes, they were friends,” Joey said, sounding pleased with himself.

&#x200B;

“So, we have an hour until it closes,” I said. Annya and I moved closer to the team while we were talking.

&#x200B;

“Yes, but Grackricoyneis will be here sooner.” Maldivians were always party poopers.

&#x200B;

“What is a Grackriceoy…whatever?” Warner asked.

&#x200B;

“It is the pestilence that destroys; where it goes, life stops.” Joey intoned like reading from a book.

&#x200B;

“Oh, that isn’t ominous or anything” Zion gripped his sword tighter as he half-heartedly joked.

&#x200B;

“Great, Joey. Do you know how to stop it?” I asked, hoping the answer didn’t get me or Annya killed.

&#x200B;

“Unless you want to give me all your blood, there is only one way I can think to do this, You must go through and stop it from getting to the gate.” Because of the tentacles that make up most of Joey’s face, it is impossible to get a read on their emotions, but his voice sounded stressed and serious at the same time. “Please, wizard, do not let Grackricoyneis get close to you. If he gets within a hundred yards, I think that is the correct measurement, you will be infected and want to help him destroy this dimension and any others he may breach for eternity.”

&#x200B;

“Assuming we can somehow hold off an infectious godlike creature,” The major asked, “How do we know when to retreat?”

&#x200B;

“The gate will change shape and flicker,” Joey said. “At that point, you will have about the time of a commercial to get back through the gate.”

&#x200B;

“Ok, people, load up; the demon rabbits have regrouped while we were gabbing.” Roger said.

&#x200B;

Sure enough, the beasts that had not died in the opening of the gate were gathering around the edges of the room and looked ready to charge us.

&#x200B;

Grabbing some guns and ammo from Zion, I held Annya’s hand as we walked up to Joey.

&#x200B;

“So what about you? If we are in there, who will keep them off you while you try to close the gate faster?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“They are inconsequential, they cannot harm me.” As if to prove his point, he took a hand ofthe portal and aimed it like a gun. One of the creatures just vanished. “They can’t harm one of the Grey. Now go.”

&#x200B;

We entered the opening in space and time. The few times I have gone into the Grey, the space between dimensions, it was unwillingly and usually unconscious, and at least once almost cost me my life. This time, I was skipping across the Grey to a dimension that was possibly a version of hell for some being. Fuck my life.

&#x200B;

“John, you have done this before?” Annya held on to my hand as she checked the magazines for her M16.

&#x200B;

“Sort of. I have had accidents with my powers, and sometimes they push me out of our dimension into the Grey. But I haven't ever been to another actual dimension before.”

&#x200B;

“So your first trip is to a Hell prison dimension?” Warner looks at me. “Damn doc, you do have some bad luck.”

&#x200B;

Unlike my instant trips to the Grey, this was a hike in the mountains, it seemed like hours of us trudging through some substance like mud. There was constant pushback the way we came as well. After what seemed like forever, we finally made it to the other side of the gateway. Immediately, heat and ash assaulted us. Everywhere we looked, the landscape was on fire, or molten lava flowed.

&#x200B;

“It really is hell.” Zion made the sign of the cross and unsheathed his ebony sword.

&#x200B;

“More likely we are on a planet in this dimension going through a geological upheaval, maybe from an asteroid collision or solar flares.” Akar mused.

&#x200B;

“There in the distance” Reynolds and Warner both pointed directly away from us; about five miles out a figure can be seen, a blackness like a hole in space.

&#x200B;

“Is that a black hole?” I wondered aloud. Annya punched me in the arm.

&#x200B;

“No, silly, if it were a black hole we would all be sucked into it.” She said this matter-of-factly, as if it would just be another event in our lives.

&#x200B;

“It is moving,” Halsinge said.

&#x200B;

We all looked back toward the impossible blackness. Sure enough, it was coming toward us.

&#x200B;

“Ok, I believe we know what our target is,” Reynolds said. “Glad I finally can kill the bastard that caused my Alisa’s death.” His grin was almost demonic as he lined up a shot from his high-powered rifle. The shot was much softer here than it would have been on earth. This seemed to confirm the lighter atmosphere of this planet. We couldn't see the bullet hit, but about the time it should have impacted there were strikes of lightning hitting the black spot moving toward us. A wave of force blasted back from the moving figure and raced toward us, the five miles affording us little time to brace.

&#x200B;

Everyone down.” I yelled. We all hit the deck as the shockwave plowed over us.

&#x200B;

The intervening miles were laid to waste, and we were picked up and tossed like dolls from the hands of a mean little girl. We ended up in a pile, my ribs felt broken, and Annya’s left wrist wasn’t fairing well either. The military members fared somewhat better, as their body armor took most of the hit. We all got up excruciatingly slow, suffering aches and pains from the unceremonious trip through the air.

&#x200B;

“What the fuck was that,” Reynolds asked as he got up from the pile of humanity we had become.

&#x200B;

“Looks like It didn’t like being shot.” I gasped, the pain in my ribs was excruciating.

&#x200B;

“If it can feel pain, then we can kill it,” Warner stated as he checked his sniper rifle and sighted in on the moving blackness.

&#x200B;

A report sounded, and again lightning flashed around the hole in the light of this world. This time it flickered, and there was no return shockwave. The blackness seemed to shrink for a moment and then returned to a slightly smaller size. Now it was moving faster. At the speed it was now moving, it would soon be on us.

&#x200B;

“Hit it with all we have, people.” Everyone with a rifle opened up on the speeding lack of color approaching us.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, a whoosh sounded beside me, and a trail of a shoulder-launched missile tracked into the pool of dark. I looked over to see Mayfield loading another tube into the launcher.

&#x200B;

“Where did you get that?” I asked dumbfounded.

&#x200B;

“Mayfield carries one of those everywhere,” Roger replied. I could see admiration, maybe even adoration on his face, when he looked at her.

&#x200B;

“Ok, I bet she does some great fireworks at the Fourth of July party.” I joked.

&#x200B;

“You damn right I do Wizard,” She laughed as she sent another missile downrange into the thing approaching.

&#x200B;

Every missile and bullet impacted the blackness and caused lightning to arc around and into it. Each hit seemed to dim and slow the darkness approaching. This continued for what seemed like an hour.

&#x200B;

“Keep pouring it on People” The major yelled above the din. “We can’t let that monster get near us.”

&#x200B;

“Major, I’m almost out of rockets” Mayfield yelled as she loaded the last batch of missiles she had carried across the portal.

&#x200B;

Slowly, our ammo dwindled, and the creature of blackness moved faster as less and less lightning hit it.

&#x200B;

“This does not look good,” Reynolds said as his gun ran dry, and he pulled his pistol.

&#x200B;

“Time for something new.” Akar put his empty gun down and opened his backpack.

&#x200B;

He grabbed a remote and unfolded a drone and attached something that looked like a bomb to the bottom of it. We watched as the diminutive aircraft streaked toward the being that would end all existence. A voice came from the blackness before the drone hit its mark.

&#x200B;

“Fools, no weapon can destroy me.” the disembodied voice raged.

&#x200B;

“Maybe so, but we don’t need to.” I heard Annya whisper through clenched teeth as she fired the last shot from her rifle. “Just slow you.”

&#x200B;

A bright explosion followed by concussive waves and lightning exploded around Grackricoyneis. The blackness disappeared, and the lightning stopped.

&#x200B;

“Anyone see anything?” Roger asked.

&#x200B;

We all replied the same.

&#x200B;

“No Sir”

&#x200B;

A low hum that became a rumble was heard and felt all around us. Black tendrils reached for the sky of this blasted and ruined planet. An inhuman scream assaulted our ears, and a new shockwave knocked us down like pins in a bowling alley. I heard screaming and realized it was mine. Others joined in the unholy chorus as we were crushed by an indescribable force. I strained to look toward the direction the scream had come from.

&#x200B;

There, just yards from us, was the creature; inky vapors rolling off its body. The monster’s skin was cracked and energy flowed just under those open wounds.

&#x200B;

“Insignificant grubblings, you will soon be my pets and your dimension will become my staging ground.” It walked closer. I struggled trying to stay conscious and judge how close he was. “I will consume all that the Grey binds, and then I shall have my revenge on my Brothers.”

&#x200B;

Brothers? Was this a Maldivian? Was that why Joey was involved and told us to be careful? Normally, Maldivians never involved themselves in dimensional issues, only things that involve the Grey. As the darkness of unconsciousness closed around my vision, a ring of Maldivians appeared and started blasting Grackricoyneis. The pressure stopped as they assaulted the evil one, and we all sat up, trying to get to our feet. Joey appeared out of nowhere and reached a hand down to help me up.

&#x200B;

“Joey, what the hell?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Yes, he is one of us, but he went… I think the word is wrong. He looked at his people locked in mortal combat with one of their own. “We must go. My brothers can’t hold him for long.”

&#x200B;

He practically threw each of us through the portal. Unlike the trip to this hell planet, the way back was instantaneous. We were once again in the basement of the virus lab. Dead or destroyed demons lay all around us.

&#x200B;

“GO, STAND BACK FROM THE GATE” Joey’s voice boomed from the opening. We all hurried away from the tear in space. A loud crash sounded as the portal collapsed into itself.

&#x200B;

“What the hell, Doc? That creature was one of your weird friends kind?” Z asked.

&#x200B;

“I think so, but Joey and his friends are on the other side of a closed gateway, so we may never know,” I said.

&#x200B;

“I really hope your friend and his “family?” make it,” Mayfield said as she dug into the rest of the weapons in the basement.

&#x200B;

I looked at my surprisingly still functioning watch. It had been a lot more than thirty minutes since I had talked to Charles at HQ.

&#x200B;

“We need to go, we missed the call to the Command Center, and a nuke should be headed this way right now,” I said frantically.

&#x200B;

We ran up the stairwell, back the way we had battled down from. Finally, we reached a level with power and grabbed a much faster elevator to the top floor.

&#x200B;

I ran to the comms room with Annya right behind me along with the team.

&#x200B;

“Charles, are you there?” I practically screamed into the mic. “HQ, are you there?”

&#x200B;

We waited tense moments for an answer.

&#x200B;

“John, John, is that you?” I heard over the radio. “Man, you can’t be there. The nuke has been launched.”

&#x200B;

Major Halsinge grabbed the mic from my hands.

&#x200B;

This is Major Roger Halsinge, Code Hell Dog, Vampire Killer Alpha, have the missile destroyed immediately.”

&#x200B;

More tense silence from the speakers. A loud rumble was heard and even through the shutters covering the windows a bright light could be seen. I sat down hard in the chair behind me. “Damn, that was close.” Warner said.

&#x200B;

“Ok, team, let’s head out.” Halsinge barked. “Smith, we will be in touch. A wizard could be useful in the future. I would work out more with your magic, we will need you at full strength.” With that, they melted into the darkness of the facility.

&#x200B;

“Come on, John, let's get out of here and go home,” Annya said, holding my hand.

&#x200B;

“Yours or mine?” I asked hesitantly.

&#x200B;

“Ours.” She said smiling. With that, we headed outside and got in my old beetle, and headed away from the silence of the lab.
