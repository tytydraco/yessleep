Autumn was arriving and I have always wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail when the leaves were showing their full colors. Work was gnashing at my spirit and in lieu of committing crimes against management, I would let out my frustration in nature where I knew I was at peace. The out of doors have always been a part of my life. My father, like his father before him, took me hiking and hunting and fishing my whole life. I’ve gained a level of respect for nature not many have had the opportunity to experience. 

1970 was approaching and the leaves began to turn. I put my vacation in to management for a whole month off, accruing extra time because I’ve slowly turned into a workaholic since dad died and my time in nature took a hit since. Now was my chance to relive the life I once knew and return to nature, so I left work and headed home to prepare. 

I unlocked my shed and saw the dust had collected on my gear. The evening was slow to arrive, and a few cold Hamms later, I had cleaned up my tent and sleeping bag. My tiny cooking pot and the micro stove took time to get clean and I still needed to clean and oil my .223 in case I needed to shoot a rabbit or a beaver because I can’t carry a few weeks of food without it rotting on my back. The night arrived, and liver willing, I had finally collected the gear I needed. Tomorrow, the trail. 

I woke up earlier than usual.  Four o’ clock in the morning, buttered some toast, gave the neighbors my perishables and a note, and hit the road. Work afforded me the choice of any Ford on the lot and I grew very attached to the new Mustang, the 1970 model, and I was in love. Three hundred and fifty one cubic inches of American muscle, five point eight liters of displacement paired to a four speed manual transmission. I soared down the road, carburetor burning all four barrels. My old man would’ve loved this car. Power steering was a luxury and the new air conditioning system was downright spoiling me, but the weather didn’t go above sixty degrees so I didn’t need it. But I sure did love it. 

The trail had an entrance about half a day’s drive away. There was no way I was going to hike the whole trail this time, I only had three weeks and I wanted to take it very slowly and I had to reserve the last few days of my vacation on a plane to visit friends and family out west. If I could hike at least half of the length and grab a bus back to my car, I would be happy. I pulled into the small gravel lot before ten in the morning and unloaded my gear. Finally, I was free. I threw my pack on and slung my rifle around my shoulder, and I was on the trail. I nabbed a small pole to fish with, too. A collapsible micro pole, for light test fish. Figured I’d rather need it and have it than want it and don’t. 

Hours passed on, and hunger became me. Far too long did I hike last, and my metabolism took a hit for sure. Can of tuna and a cache of crackers later, I was back on the trail. I hadn’t passed a single soul since I left my car, the trail was empty. The sun began to dim and I had only an hour of light left, so it was time to set up camp for the night. Of course no hike is complete without forgetting something and I forgot duct tape. I always carry a small role, but time took its toll on me and I was rusty. The small tear in my tent was a mosquito doggie door the whole night, but I slept, tapeless and helpless to seal the hole. The weather was changing so they weren’t as bad. 

Hours turned to days and steps became miles. I was on the trail for close to a week and food was now gone, the last can of SPAM and my remaining ounce of trail mix was depleted and I could definitely tell I had lost well over ten pounds already. Neat, back on track to my healthy weight. Mosquitos may have played a role, but I digress. Miles flew by and my stomach rumbled. Creeks were few and far apart, I knew my next meal had to have four legs and poor luck, and that’s exactly what it had. Down my sights was a mighty fat grouse. I lied about the four legs… .223 was a pretty large caliber for grouse, but as long as I didn’t his center mass, I could save the meat and behead it in one shot, easy peasy. The shot echoed through the valley and the grouse was no more. Unfortunately, I missed his head but it was a kill shot and the meat was spared. 

I found a trickle from a spring and half an hour later I had a whole grouse, gutted, defeathered, and now beheaded. Solid couple days of meat, and I had the luck to find some chanterelle shrooms back about four miles. I was going to eat like a king. I made a fire, right off the trail, and roasted the bird on a stick and cooked the mushrooms in my pot with fat dripped from the bird. Needless to say, every edible ounce was consumed with violent fervor and immense enjoyment.

I awoke to a strange sound. Light was only a sliver on the mountains and echoing throughout the valley was this shriek I’ve never heard before. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t soil myself a little, but I chocked it up to a dying fox. They tend to make weird noises when they’re being hunted, so I decided sleep was now impossible and I continued on my way. A whole week has now gone by and I was burning my eighth day. Fishing was a bust at every stream and while I saw plenty of squirrels, I wanted something slightly larger. Another hiker finally went by me that afternoon and after a quick conversation, he too heard the noise and decided to carry on. He said a critter got to his pack that night and took his waist pack that had his fire starter in it and told me to hold my stuff close. He handed me a protein bar, said good luck, and went along his way. 

Nightfall came, beautifully. I decided to nab a squirrel earlier and I skinned it. Unfortunately, exhaustion took me, so the squirrel had to wait. Hung from a tree about thirty yards away for predators, I tied the rodent up and went to bed. No fire tonight, too tired. Sleep comes easy to the sounds of nature. Crickets and the bugs, some water in the distance, and the coo of an owl. 

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING wakes you up faster than when they all fall silent. 

My eyes shot open to the sound of…nothing. Absolute quiet. My watch said three, and my sweat began to flow. A bear is near, I knew it. Coyotes make noise and wolves weren’t present says the forest service. What I really feared was cougar, those things actively hunt hikers and I haven’t been scared by them before but that was when my dad was with me. One lonely cricket chirped, and the forest returned to noise again. I fell back asleep slowly, until my watch hit nine and my eyes opened. Shit. I wanted to start earlier, six at the latest and here it was nine. Breakfast had to wait and the campsite needed tearing down. Tent was packed, and I was hungry, but food had to wait until lunch. I walked to the line that I hung the squirrel and the line hung empty. 

God. Damn. It. 

I knew a damned cougar was here and that little bastard took my squirrel. What else could’ve made the leap to get it? I untied the knot around the tree and rolled up the cord. I expected its head to still be attached to the line, but it wasn’t. In fact, nothing. No knot, even. Cut completely clean. 

Cut. 

Son of a bitch. A hiker came through and took my squirrel, that two bit piece of shit. Asshole had the gall to throw the line and retie it to the tree. Who does that? Game was hard to find on the trail now, so losing that little rodent snack really set me off. If I run into the fucker that took my squirrel, he’s eating fist. Angry, I took the map out and saw I could go off-trail for about ten-ish miles and maybe I could nab a beaver up in a valley, so I did. 

Exit stage right and I was off the trail. If I simply go up and above the next ridge, down the valley, through the next two hills and valleys, I can reach a larger stream where something of respectable size could be my next meal. Birds were everywhere, and what seemed like untold quadrillions of chipmunks, but a .223 would simply turn them into red mist, so they weren’t viable options. Didn’t stop me from turning one into said mist, though. Had to make sure my rifle was still scoped in, and it wasn’t. For the price of one chipmunk, I recentered my scope. 

I came to the bottom of a tributary to the stream of endless bounty. Daylight was waning and my stomach was speaking angry German. I pushed on, the stream was around the cut and down the way about an hour and I had to get there before nightfall if I was going to get a chance to eat in the morning. Finally, I made it to the water. Pissed in it, drank from it, and went to bed. No fire, again, and this time it was cold. 

I awoke to sounds aplenty. Birds, squirrels, bugs. SLAP. I knew it. SLAP. Yup. SLAAP. 

Food. 

A beaver got angry at my presence and began to slap the water. Little did he know, he was ringing his own dinner bell of death. I didn’t even get out of bed when I righted my rifle, sighted his chest, and with one squeeze of my finger the beaver was sent to the great big dam in the sky. The best part was that the stream floated him right to me. Thank god, I was too tired to fetch him at the moment. I skinned him, packed the hide in a trash bag for home, and began the roast. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, but slightly charred beaver tail is actually really good. The hide needed to dry, I’m a dolt, so I removed it from the sack and hung it on a tree. 

I reeked. Over a week without a shower, hiking the trail and with critter bits on me, I needed to bathe. Off came the clothes, boots, and beanie and dipped into the stream. It opened into a pond, where I did most of my hygienic ritual. Arms, legs, body, and ass. Especially ass. Trust me, crapping in the woods with mere ferns for rear end receipts tends to ripen the human experience. Water was cold and the air felt icy after plunging, but it was time to keep going. I had a decent day’s hike to continue off-trail until it runs back into the trail. 

Out of the water, and my clothes were gone. Shirt, pants, socks, and a pair of questionable underwear. Gone. I knew I wasn’t alone anymore, and it wasn’t a hiker or a cougar. My pack was still there, and so was my second and only change of clothes. My bathing slippers were gone, too. I was livid, but now I’m scared. I wasn’t alone and I’m being watched. I saw nobody, but they’re there, somewhere. I quickly got clothed and packed up camp when I saw the bastards took my hide and my beaver meat. 

I hurried past the pond and made my way over the larger hill. Something didn’t feel right. I may not be watched, but I definitely wasn’t alone anymore. Down the hill became a valley, I slowly walked the whole time out of fear, but soon fear became me. I came to a narrow path, whose path? Fuck me, I don’t know. But it was, indeed, a path. No animals made this path. With fresh sweat and fear, I decided. Right. Not left. Right was the direction of the main trail, and I needed that, yesterday. 

Lunch time came and all I had was the right haunch of beaver I cooked last night. The rest was taken. I had to stop and eat, but I was locked in fear of being seen. This person or people steal without any problem, and I was far from trusting they wouldn’t do more. I found myself in small divot not fifteen feet from this path, empty and just big enough to crouch in. I popped open my bag and began ripping strips of beaver until I had eaten nearly all of it. I had to save the rest for tomorrow because I didn’t know when my next opportunity for food was coming. I zipped my bag up, took a step out of the depression in the soil, and caught up on a root and tripped. Pot clanked, bag jostled, and below me was my foot, lodged inside a root. I kneeled down to free my foot and lost my breath. 

It was a rib cage. My foot was lodged inside a rib cage. Horrified, I snapped the ribs and looked behind me in the hole I once used as a snack spot. Subtle, but ever present, was the mass of many bones. A hand, a foot…another rib cage. How did I miss them before? At the end of the hole was one socket, a skull half sunken into the dirt, one dark and empty eye staring at me. It spoke to me. “Leave. Now. Stay. Join.” My mind made it up, but the words were there. I returned to the path, now full of beaver but hunger won’t be an issue anymore. Soon, another hole. More bones. Another hole. Then another. And another. More and more and more, dozens of holes, shallow graves upended by rain and critters. Hundreds of dead. As I followed the path, as quickly as possible, the holes began to become fewer and fewer, but the bones became redder and redder. 

Fresh graves? Who are these people? Who killed them? Was it my clothes thieves? My beaver burglars? Fuck! My squirrel?! How long have they been following me? Are they following me? Am I…being hunted? The graves came to an end at the base of the next hill, this time fresh bits of meat still present. Obvious gnaw marks, human. No skulls. Clothing sat by their bones. 

I had a whole day left before I could get to the main trail, and the sunlight only had an hour, maybe less. I was fucked. I knew I was fucked. Fucked, I was. Night was coming, and they knew I was around. Shit, they probably knew exactly where I was, I was probably being watched. I knew I had to power through the night, so I hit the path even harder. This was a mistake, I had eaten only bits of a beaver and my pace was much faster than I was used to and I really should have just went to Yosemite. The light was a mere hum above the hills when I heard talking. English? Yes…no? Yeah. Definitely English. FUCK. I had to hide. I looked around and the only place I saw was a collection of boulders against the bluff. I hurried over and, in my haste, I dropped my aid pack. 

God. Damn. It.
Leave it.

I snuck above and around the stones, and wedged myself in between a slot where I fell in. Fucking rocks are hard to land on, but at least I was hidden. I could see the path from my stealthy stonework, where the words got louder and louder and the sound of footsteps became apparent. “Bag back walk cloth” one said, pulling at his clothes. My clothes. “Stepstep ah-hooo” said the other, pointing at his feet where my slippers were. “No ah ah” he said, sliding them off his bare, filthy feet. He picked them up and flung them at the rocks. They fell through into my hole I was in. Anger erupted from the other, and he swung at his ‘friend’, slugging him in the head. A curdling “guhhhhhuhuh” blew from his mouth, cries as if his mom had taken his toys away. The other, still angry, approached the rocks. 

Fuck. 

I leaned back in my hole, the only light coming in from the twilight dusk in the crack I was watching from. He came closer. Crunch. Crunch. Snap, pop, crunch. The leaves and twigs broke under his bare feet, getting louder and louder with each advancing step. Quiet, I thought. He’s coming. “Umghfff” came from him as he lurched his body on top of my rocks. Dead. I was dead. No fucking way was I to survive this. He leaned down on his stomach, eyes and arm reaching down into my hiding hole. The slippers! He was after the fucking flip flops that his black-eyed compatriot was wearing. My fucking flip flops. 

They were out of reach, he’ll need to slip in here with me to get them and that… Was. Not. Happening. I slowly grabbed one, careful to avoid the light beam glowing from the crack in the rocks. I silently rose the flip to the fingertips of the man, where he just gripped it. “Gahyooo wahahahaha” he screamed, throwing it at his friend, hitting him in the eye. Screams flew from the other, followed by tears and wailing. Yeah, flip flops fucking hurt when thrown. Especially when your eye is already black and swollen. He was without the flop. He had the one, but not the other. He got on his belly once more, peaked into my hiding hole, and saw the other sitting in the beam of light. I had retreated mere inches behind in the pitch black, but if he had to climb in here, I was dead. My rifle was useless in here, and the fact that I fit at all was a miracle let alone with my pack behind me. His hand was only a foot from my head, reaching for the last slipper. He didn’t know it was well out of reach, but so was it to I. I needed to ‘help’ him, and he needed to not come down here. His hand was in the way of my grabbing it, so I waited until he pulled his hand out, peaked again, and dug his hand further. I had only a second to grab it, and I did. He recoiled his arm, peaked again, and saw it was gone. 

Shit. He knows I’m down here and the slipper is gone…in my hand. He groaned, and I fell even more silent, even more so. He peaked his whole head down, turned his neck, but couldn’t see the slipper. The back of his head faced me, enable to spot me. Sweat dripped from my nose. He yanked his head out and reinserted his arm, this time with more gusto and power, fingertips scraping at the bottom looking blindly for that last slipper. My chance was here, so I calmly slipped it into his range of grasp and he yanked it from the rocks, hollering at his crying friend, already cowering from fear of it being thrown at him. 

The commotion scared a raccoon from the rocks. All this time, he too was terrified and silent with me in the boulder pile, unbeknownst to each other. The raccoon squeezed through the peeping crack and in one ‘whump’, the man kept from the boulder above me and stomped on the critter. Puh-plopf. The critter erupted, guts and shit sprayed through the crack and painted me. It was warm, and it smelled horrific. I gagged, silently. Make any noise and I was dead, and that thought kept repeating in my mind. “Be quiet or die. Be quiet. Or die. Silence. Death.” He bent down, grabbed the tail, and ran to his ‘friend’. He slipped the flip flops on for himself, took three steps, made a growl of discomfort and slipped the footwear off and threw them into a shallow grave. 

This didn’t bode well for the bruised fellow, as he too threw them out only to get a black eye for doing so. He screamed, grabbed a stone, and dented the other’s skull in. He fell, motionless. Sloppy laughter commenced, blood flowing from the skull and then SPUNCH. CRACK. SPLEEGE. The man continued to stomp the other’s skull in, the sound of brain matter squeemed through his toes. He then bent down, grabbed the raccoon, spit on his dead brethren, and ran down the path laughing and crying all the same. 

I inhaled deeply, for once I was yet alone to make a small noise. The oxygen revived my horror-stricken body and I sat motionless. The thought kept repeating in my mind, you must run. Run. RUN. 

So I stepped up, grabbed the ledge of the boulder above me, where the now dead man reached for my flip flops, when I slipped. My foot hit a small rock, and it broke. Loud. Like a walnut shell in an empty auditorium. Pain didn’t register, so I peaked down to realize my foot didn’t break, but the rock beneath me crumbled. I felt relieved, but the whole damned forest had to hear the rock exploding and I needed to get out, NOW. My body, my legs, and my left foot slipped from the opening. My pack and my rifle went first, no way everything fit on the way back up, and if my luck couldn’t have been any worse, my right foot was stuck in the damned rock I broke and the fucking thing wouldn’t fit through the crack. I looked down again, and saw the heel of my boot was being chewed on by teeth. It wasn’t a rock, but a skull, now clamped onto my boot. Freaked, I yanked my leg and the skull dislodged. Thank god. 

In fact, don’t thank god. 

The other man was returning. He must I’ve heard the skull crack open. The steps grew louder, and louder. Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. I slid down the boulder. Darkness took the forest. I hid behind the boulder, when the man began to run. Fear once took over yet again, yet I stood still. He kept from the ground and scurried up the boulder where I whence came, layed down, and put his whole upper body down the hole. The man stood back up, broken skull in hand, raccoon in the other. He chuckled and looked at the body of his victim, yelled “you’s pa pa broke too” and hurled the skull at his dead compatriot, striking his lifeless puddle of head slush. He climbed off of the stone and walked to the body, kicked it at least a dozen times, hooting and hollering and championing his kill. He gave the man one last, bigger kick, this time I could hear the ribs snap. He stepped over him, pulled out his pecker, and pissed on his corpse, laughing as the piss mixed with the brain matter like a hose hitting mud. 

A zipper zipped and he walked away. Five steps away, CRUNCH. “Huh?” He shouted. The feral man looked down to see what he had broken, and saw a small, red pack. My aid pack. He broke the weak plastic and broken it. This wasn’t here before, he must’ve thought because his attention went directly to the skull, and then the hole in the rocks. Oh my fuck, I thought. He knows I’m here. I have to run, NOW. 

So I did. 

Darkness as my ally, I hauled ass. Behind me was screams and the sound of running. I was being followed. I ran even harder, much harder than I ever thought I could, which wasn’t much. The screaming behind me got quieter and the running footsteps soon lay silent. I couldn’t go further, my lungs physically couldn’t handle the pressure. I leaned against a tree, and without any warning, a feeling crept up my back and I proceeded to throw up. Beaver bits, bile, and blood. I pushed myself too far, but I had to. Survival was now obligatory, no, mandatory. 

Exhaustion swept across me. I felt the rush of adrenaline leave me, and the result was a massive crash. I leaned against another tree and fell unconscious.

I awoke to flies and stench. Gross, I thought. I had puked on my shoes. I stood up, and instantly felt something was wrong. My damned foot. Ankle, actually.  A fucking tooth had dislodged from the skull last night into my ankle, and I was too fucked to notice. Flies surely did, though. I stumbled to the trickle stream nearby, and dislodged it. Washed it, I continued down the trail. At this point, I reloaded my rifle. It would’ve come in handy had I now completely shit my pants running away last night. I ate the last nibble of beaver I had and retook my bearings. In the mad dash for my life, I had completely lost the path and, thus, my follower. The map lined up with the surrounding hills and I finally knew where I was. About a mile from the path and another six or seven to the trail, over the hill to my right. I set forth. 

Unfuckingbelievable. 

As I began the climb, I smelled smoke. Fear took me once again. I continued to climb until I reached the head of this hill, where I hunkered down. Beneath me was now shacks. Two of them, smoke from one, and a large lean-to built into the trees. I could hear the sound of chickens and goats. Hung on the lean to were shoes, no, boots. Hiking boots. Hundreds of them. Each one held the soil for a plant…beans, maybe? Chimes hung from the corners and the trees. Skulls and bones and sticks and stones. Clacking, clattering. From the bushes came a man, last nights’ man, raccoon in hand. He seemed tired, and now injured. His foot was bleeding and bad. The plastic from the first aid had punctured his foot, and the bleeding never stopped from last night. That’s how I survived, he couldn’t catch up. The irony of his situation, to have injured himself with the very tools he could be using to fix it, if only he knew what they were. 

The man entered the shack that had smoke rising from the top. Screaming commenced, followed by crying and the wailing, “No! No! Peese brabra, me step step!” Then a deafening shot rang out, pieces of the shack blown off. Silence. Shotgun. No other sound could do that, and I could definitely say that that man was now dead. 

The door busted open, and three men ran out. One had the aid pack in his hand, the other the raccoon, and the last was flip flops. He went back for the flip flops? They ran to the other shack, came out, this time wearing pelts and each now holding a gun. I had to go, and NOW. 

I dipped behind the hill and made my way towards the path. Haste was an understatement. In quick time, I found the path and took the route towards the trail. There was no time for rest, and if I did the math right, I could be at the trail by dusk. Hunger no longer bothered me yet my thirst was rabid. I stopped at trickles and drank, looking back at every turn. 

Minutes became hours and hours were miles. The map did not lie, I was only a valley away from the trail. In fifteen, maybe twenty minutes I was back inside known territory, safer than before but not out of the woods. But I had to hurry, light was dimming and I wanted to be on the trail NOW. I shimmied down the hillside, ankle sore and body exhausted. Reaching the valley, I had to solve my ankle problem. It was showing signs of early infection, and all I had was hand sanitizer. It had to do. 

I rested upon a log, the trail now within sight not two hundred yards away. I removed by blood soaked boot and my reddened sock. No active bleeding, but the ankle was swollen and sore. I knew it was going to hurt, but I didn’t it anyway, and with one embarrassing fart from the sanitizer bottle, alcohol and lavender seeped into the tooth hole in my ankle. Fuck me if it didn’t burn like the dickens, and I wanted to scream, I really, really did. But I knew if I did, they’d hear it and I was good as dead. 

I guess it didn’t really matter. 

An echo in the distance as a shot rang out. I looked around, dipped behind the log, and with haste I put my sock and boot back on. Another shot rang, striking the log. Fuck. They found me. Another, then another. They got closer and closer. I knew that if I didn’t get up and run, I was simply waiting to get shot behind this fucking log. The next shot rang and I saw my opportunity. I bolted upright and fucking ran. 150 yards. 100. 75. 50. 40. 20. 10. 5. Finally, the trail. They were still behind me, catching up quick. I turned around, where I saw in the distance a man with a gun sprinting towards me. Maybe 100 yards. Two others were behind him another 100 yards.

Make a stand, you fucking fool. 

So I did. 

I turned and faced him, little did he know I, too, had a rifle. I raised it and he stopped in his tracks. He now knew I wasn’t a mere rabbit in the game of prey. He began to run again. I couldn’t stay still, and when his chest was in my sights, I let loose a round. My eyes peaked above the scope, his body still sprinting towards me. Hundred feet left. I missed? MISSED?! I racked another round, this time my eye below the scope followed the rail and the sight line. He was close, and I could now see the buttons on his filthy, plaid shirt. I squeezed the trigger and his body, still moving forward, came to an instant dive into the ground. I hit his chest, and blew his heart and a lung out behind him. The other two, still a hundred yards behind, saw it and fell to their knees. They cried and wailed, and then stood back up and charged. I didn’t hesitate to turn around and book it. 

The trail climbed, and light was now gone. I was far from exhausted, promoted to near-dead. I could see the valley below where I killed the man. I could see his body from where I was, a mere tiny dot in the distance, being drug away by his…sons? Brothers? Who cares. The next intersection on the trail was miles ahead, another day’s hike, and this ankle of mine was not getting better. The fiery alcohol had stemmed the infection, but only for now, and had to be reapplied. My watch was broken, and the stars were out. The moon was high, so it must’ve been past midnight, maybe closer to one or two. I stripped my foot, doused the wound in liquid pain yet again, and then tied a remnant of shirt around it, also soaked in lavender alcohol. The pain was unbearable now. The swelling became larger, but I had to sleep. Fuck the tent, the mosquitos, the bedding. Being this tired meant nothing to comfort, in fact, they were slowing me down. I passed out against a tree as I watched the two dots of fire slowly drag their dead away down in the valley. 

I woke up hot and cold. The infection was slowly turning for the worse and now, I’m out of sanitizer. Painfully, I stood up. Sore and stiff and tired still, I began my jaunt to the next exit of the trail. The map said ten or so miles, and so it was. I kept up a decent pace, given my situation. By noon I was halfway there, glad to know they weren’t behind me. As far as I knew, that is. I kept up until I heard the crunch of soil ahead of me. Fuck. Nowhere to hide and definitely not able to run. I racked another round and pointed it down the trail. Crunch. Crunch.  Crunch. In sight, I saw a man. He, too, wearing a hiking pack and supplies. Another hiker! Fuck yes!

I lowered my gun approached him. He said, “Wow, that bad, huh? I just started a few miles back, trail must be very difficult.” I didn’t laugh. I sat down. 

“Sir, ahead is murder and fear and death. Do not go further. Turn around and run. Do you have painkillers?” Weird way of saying it all, but that’s what I said. He said he had some dope, and that he’d share some with me. I politely accepted, anything to dull the pain. We smoked together for a few minutes as I recalled the last day and a half. He didn’t believe it, but given my state he seemed to have believed at least some of it. He then said he could radio the town where he worked and have an ambulance meet me at the trail’s next exit, of which I very much agreed. Any help whatsoever was kindly taken. 

As I got up and began to hike, he said that he was going to keep going. I told him everything I said was true and that he was not going to survive…them. Nothing changed his mind, and my own life was still in the balance if this ankle doesn’t get worked on, so I headed forth and he kept on. His body was found amongst the shallow graves months later, eaten and mutilated, and his bones were found as tools in the shacks. His skull became a mug on their table. 

I kept on. I was only an hour from the end of this nightmare when I heard the echo from behind me, a shot rang out. I feared for my fellow hiker’s life, but alas his was now over. They were still after me, and his death delayed them. His life given was my life saved. I was at the ‘Y’ intersection. Left? Trail to Maine. Right? Exit, half mile. What seemed like years, I trudged forward until I saw the lights of the ambulance in the distance. I could hear traffic, and I could smell society. Come on, I told myself. Do it. Just another hundred yards. Push. PUSH. Nothing. 

Collapsed. 

I awoke in a hospital bed. Two nurses and a doctor were there, speaking to my roommate. The tv on the wall set to local news. “Breaking News: Mass Graves Found Near Appalachian Trail.” I spoke. “Ma’am. Ma’am?” The nurse turned around, surprised to see me. I struggled to breathe. Inside my mouth and throat was a breathing device. “Ma’am” I said again, gurgling on the tubes. She ran over, and slid it out from me. What a relief. 

“Where am I?” I said, still blinded by the room’s clean white walls and bedding.

“Mercy Virginia Hospital,” she said. “You were found by paramedics on the trail, not one minute from the exit. You went septic, your kidneys began to shut down, and your blood was toxic.” 

“Fuuuuck. Okay. What’s going on?” I asked, pointing to the television. 

“Some US Marshal went hiking and never came back. His office sent a search team into the trail where they found, not too far off either, mass graves. I guess they found one body of a man that had his head bashed and another that was shot in the chest. Lucky you weren’t there to see it, huh?” She said, oblivious to the fact I saw it all. “They found a settlement up yonder where another body was found, head just gone. Shotgun. Boy, those hills sure can be spooky!” 

Understatement. Grave understatement.

“Did they find anyone?” I asked. 

“Well, they found the poor fella Marshal. He was eaten by the wildlife, they say. Murder suicide they think by a serial killer. Killed his brother, his pa, and then blew his head off in a cabin up in them hills.” She attested. “They’re still digging up bones.” 

“What day is it?” I asked, seeing decorations on the windows and walls. 

“It’s Halloween!” She yells, happily. “I’m happy you’re awake to see it! You’ve been out for over a month and some change, darling. I’ve changed your bedding and pot since you’ve got here. You nearly died half a dozen times, and did die twice. But we got ya, darling. We gotchya.” She was pleasant. 

Two weeks passed. I relearned to walk and to swallow. Doesn’t take long for the body to weaken and lose those abilities. I called my boss. Fired. Ends up, nobody knew who I was and didn’t care to find me. That’s fine, I’ve no family left so that adds up. My job is mine with a signed affidavit from the doc about what happened, though, but I doubt I’ll return. But it was time to leave, and no car. Shit! My car! 

I called the tow yards and the sheriff. No known tow of a mustang since, so it was still there. A few hundred dollars and a pack of booze got me a taxi to the parking lot where my car was still sitting. Dust evenly distributed over it. I thanked the driver, opened my trunk, and threw my gear and hospital clothes in. Of course, it started right up and I couldn’t have peeled out of there faster. 

I arrived home, and thank god. I sat in the car for hours, just happy to be alive. I got out, and went to open my trunk. Inside was my bag and my clothes. I grabbed it, and under them it fell out. A crushed skull, the one I crushed. My face went pale. I rushed back into my car and saw my registration was missing. They knew where I lived. I looked in my mirror to see movement inside my house. I didn’t hesitate. I started my engine and tore off. 


I heard my home burned down. I was missing, so they believed me dead. And that’s what I’ll remain to be.
