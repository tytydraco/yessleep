I live on an old farm out of a town that will not be named. If you are reading this, don’t talk to the greyhound, no matter how much it sounds like someone you know.
It was around 5 when I got home from the store with groceries.

My farm was gifted to my by my cousin after my parents passed in a accident a couple years ago. They always kept the farmhouse in shape for visitors because of my parents popularity in town working for the local community program that helped in anyway they could. One day, they adopted a greyhound who they let me take care of when I turned 16. I don’t remember its name but I think it was more of a indoorsy dog.

When my dog passed, we had laid him to rest in our front yard close to his dog house. A year later, I found scratch marks on the door that looked like my dogs.

I was putting away the food when one of the bags tipped over and dropped an apple on the floor. 

When I looked back, it appeared as if the bag was pointing outside my window to the wheat field that had been gifted to me. When I picked up the apple, there were bite marks in it, resembling a dog bite.

I just brushed it off as me seeming things. My sleep schedule was pretty bad so insomnia was just a matter of time. I went to turn on my tv and watch the news, but something caught my eye as I passed the bag that tipped over.

I noticed something in the wheat, staring back at me from far past the fence. Perched atop an old scarecrow, was a tall greyhound standing on its hind legs.
I could almost feel it's cold gaze meeting mine. The wind picked up and the dog jumped into the wheat. I quickly ran out to my truck and started to patrol my field in search of the greyhound that might make a B line for my animals, shotgun in hand.

But when I turned my rearview mirror, the greyhound was sitting upright in my back seat. He spoke in what sounded like my fathers voice. “You forgot me, didn’t you?” I felt my heart beating in my chest. “I remember what you did. You knew it wasn’t going to happen. You forgot about me in the yard.” I finally got the courage to respond. I shouldn’t have. “W-what are you talking about? I didn’t-” As I turned back, the dog vanished from sight.

I tried to start my car but it didn’t work. I turned and ran to my house but was struck in the leg by a piercing feeling. It was the bone that I used to play fetch with the greyhound I adopted all those years ago. I did remember. I mustered the strength to reach my fence but stopped when I heard my fathers voice. “Where are you going? I thought you wanted a friend.” The greyhound was standing over me. I finally saw my fathers name on his collar.
