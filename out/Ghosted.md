The television is on when I step into my Briarwood apartment. My roommate Cyrus is sprawled on the couch. He’s watching some crazy reality dating show about a bunch of hot, flirtatious weirdoes trapped on a cruise ship.

I wish I had time for junk TV. Cyrus works as a server at a downtown steak house and pulls in so much cash that it makes me question my career ambitions sometimes. Still wearing his black restaurant uniform, he is depressurizing from his shift. He looks over as I go to the fridge and grab a beer.

“Not spending the day with your lady today?”

“Ton of homework. Figured I'd be more productive back at my place.”

“I hear ya. The ladies can be distracting.”

Cyrus should know. The man doesn’t have a girlfriend, he has *girlfriends.* Every time I talk to him he is either chasing or bedding some new girl. He’s tall, built, and has a face that women swoon for, not to mention some serious game.

“So did you get to slice and dice some bodies the other day?”

“Sure did.”

I crack open my Miller Lite and take a deep swig. Cyrus is waiting for me to say more, but I don’t want to go into the gruesome details. Instead, I shift the conversation away from me. “How was work?”

“Got stiffed by a couple of tourists.”

The bane of any server’s existence. I‘ve heard this one before.

Cyrus observes me in contemplative silence. He senses something is up without me having to say a word. He can be a bit callous, but he’s also a people person — probably one of the reasons he cleans up in his chosen profession.

“What's on your mind right now, bro?”

“Lynn asked me to move in with her.” The answer slips out easily, and I realize I was hoping we could talk about this.

“And you said yes?”

“I didn’t say no.”

“I guess it’s time for me to look for a new roommate.” Cyrus pauses, having picked up on my hesitation. “Unless you’re having second thoughts?”

“I love Lynn. So what’s my problem?”

“Face it. You’re a guy... that’s your problem.”

I think Cyrus is right.

“Lynn is an amazing girl, but...”

“There are a lot of fish in the sea!”

Cyrus has hit the nail on the head, though I’m ashamed to admit it. Unlike my ladykiller roomie, I’ve had exactly three girlfriends in my life.

“Long story short, I love Lynn but I'm just not sure I'm ready to settle down.”

“That sexy Starbucks barista wouldn't have anything to do with this, would she?”

My voice becomes defensive as I answer and it gives me away. “Maria and I are just friends.”

“Right. Of course you are.”

Cyrus gets up and grabs himself a beer too. As he toasts my already half-empty can, he says, ”These are the facts of life. This city is full of great girls, you're young and you're going to be a physical therapist or even a doctor one day. You could get laid by a different chick every night of the week.”

I smile despite myself. “Sounds like you don't think I should do it.”

“On the contrary, go for it. I hate to lose you as a roomie, dude, but Lynn is a keeper. If you let her go, you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.”

I’m not used to hearing Cyrus talk like that. There’s heartfelt emotion in his voice. For a second he almost sounds like a mature grownup.

“Truth is, you’re a nice guy and ill-equipped to deal with all the freaks out there.”

“But you are?”

A big smile lights up Cyrus’ face as he says, “Hey, I’m one of them.”

It’s my turn to grin. This is why I love my roommate.

\* \* \*

Falling snow sheets past the window. I’m in my bedroom surrounded by a wall of books and cramming for an upcoming quiz. I try to concentrate, but I’m distracted. My eyes wander toward the Iphone charging on my night stand.

I don’t feel like myself as I reach for my cell and download Tinder on my phone.

*What are you up to, buddy?*

If feels like someone else is in control as I create my first Tinder profile. This is nuts. I’m playing with fire here — no pun intended. If Lynn finds out that I just signed up for Tinder…

*You’re doing this for Josh*, I remind myself.

This thought calms me slightly.

Armed with my own dating profile, I dive into the digital meat market. The barrage of smiling women becomes numbing as I keep swiping through profiles, hoping to find Akasha.

How did the saying go? A picture is worth a thousand words. When it came to the mating game, that was certainly true. I instantly grasp the addictive allure of the app. This is pure animal attraction filtered through a SUPER RETINA XDR display.

As I go through the profiles, I realize I can’t search for a specific person on Tinder. There is no way to look up Akasha. Damn, I should have known that.

This was a dumb idea to begin with.

I’m about to give up and delete the app when another thought occurs to me. Maybe there is another way to find Akasha.

I ask Google if there is another way to find someone’s profile on Tinder. I learn that by adjusting age, gender and location to the person you are trying to look for, it’s only a matter of time before they show up in your feed.

I text Peter and ask him for a screenshot of Akasha’s profile.

A moment later my cell pings.

I study the profile. Take in Akasha’s likes, dislikes, and various other details. Use those details to narrow possible matches in my area.

Once done, I need to keep swiping and hope I eventually get lucky. Google informs me that I could perform a Tinder name search with another site called Social Catfish, but such a reverse search requires another account.

I will give the first method a try first.

I forget how long it takes, the smiling female faces on my phone are starting to become a blur when my efforts are finally rewarded.

Akasha’s enigmatic presence is now staring back at me from my phone.

*Found you!*

My fingers hover over the app. I study the two symbols below the profile. A heart if you like them, a cross if you don’t. Or you can swipe to the right if you like them, or to the left if you don’t.

Akasha's profile seems to be staring back at me. Those enigmatic are boring into me, almost as if her picture is aware of what I'm about to do. For a crazy moment, it feels like her lips curl up in a mocking smile, almost as if she is daring me to go through with it.

Who is this woman? How is she connected to Josh's death?

My stomach knots with a mixture of anxiety and existential dread. A little voice inside my head is warning me not to contact this woman. Akasha is trouble.

But then my eyes come to rest on the framed picture of Josh and me that I scavenged from his apartment. Grief wells up and threatens to overwhelm me.

*I'm doing this for you, bro.* Someone needs to find out what really happened to Josh.

My fear turns to righteous anger. Mind made up, I swipe right.

And wait.

This is a bad idea. No guarantee that Akasha will like my profile and swipe right on her end, so that we can chat. And even if she does, what am I getting myself into here? If Akasha is truly connected to what happened to Josh, she might conceivably come after me next. It’s hard to believe that this girl just showed up and torched my brother without him even putting up a fight, or her leaving behind any trace of foul play. She isn’t superhuman. She has a fucking Tinder profile, for God’s sake.

Something just doesn’t add up yet there is no turning back at this point.

I try to concentrate on my studies again but keep stealing glances at my phone. After about thirty minutes of this, I drift off and fall into a dreamless sleep.

When I finally wake up, sunlight is streaming into my apartment.

My stomach rumbles. The idea of eggs and coffee makes me almost forget about Akasha and Tinder and all the other crazy shit that has been taking up bandwidth in my head. Nevertheless, I eye my cell phone.

To my amazement, a Tinder notification informs me that there is a MATCH.

A chill travels up my spine, and I’m suddenly wide awake.

Akasha has liked me back. I can now message her directly.

It feels like I’m still dreaming as I open the message box.

What to write? How to start the conversation?

My fingers tap the keyboard almost as if they have a will of their own.

I type: “*Hi there. Not sure what to say here but wanted to get to know you better.”*

Not the most clever opening line, but it’s the best I can come up with. A final beat of hesitation before I press SEND.

I made the first move. The ball was now in Akasha’s court.

What am I getting myself into here?

\*\*\*\*

This is all about Josh. I want to get to the bottom of a mystery that is making it difficult for me to concentrate on anything else and move on with my life. I listlessly chew my breakfast while I clutch my phone, waiting for a response from Akasha.

I almost drop the cell when it finally vibrates in my hand.

I stare at the incoming message from Akasha.

“*Hey Mark... How are you?”*

I respond slowly.

Me: *“I'm okay. Thanks for getting back.”*

Akasha: *“I like your pictures... You have a warm smile...”*

And so our chat begins.

We quickly develop a nice back-and-forth.  This is the first real flirting I’ve done with a woman besides Lynn in quite some time. I hate to admit it but the exchange is… fun. Hard to imagine that the lovely lady on the other end of this conversation might have played a role in my brother’s death.

Sobering really crashes down on my when Akasha suggests we should meet in person. This is getting real.

Akasha: “*Let’s grab some coffee?”*

I hesitate, then type.

*“Where would you like to meet?”*

Akasha suggest a nearby Starbucks.

I agree.

A voice behind makes me almost spit up my eggs.

It’s Cyrus.

“Hey bro, I can't find my laundry key. Could I borrow yours?”

He stops, having spotted Akasha's Tinder profile and our digital exchange.

*You’re so busted, buddy.*

“What the fuck. How long have you been on Tinder?”

*Here we go. This is what I was afraid of.*

“I'm not.”

A sly smile stretches over Cyrus' face. “Lynn asks you to move in with her and your first reaction is set up a Tinder account?”

I ignore the comment and hand Cyrus my set of laundry keys.

“Gotta run. Make sure not to lose it unless you want us to start using the laundromat down the street.”

I’m out the door before Cyrus can respond.

\*\*\*

I pull into the Starbucks parking lot. I own a beaten-up Honda Civic built in the last century. You don’t need a car in New York, and it’s pretty much madness to drive into Manhattan. Nowadays I only use the car if I’m going somewhere in Queens. The heavy snowfall makes it a bit risky to take the Honda out for a spin, but I don’t feel like braving the public transportation system this evening.

I park my car but don't turn off the engine. I peer through the windshield at the people milling around outside the coffee shop, chattering away. Happy, smiling folks whose lives must be untouched by any recent tragedy.

I stare at the key still resting in the ignition. I’m tempted to blow the meeting off.

I give myself a push and head into Starbucks. I scan the crowd of bundled-up caffeine junkies and quickly determine that Akasha isn’t among them. I order a coffee and wait with my red holiday-themed cup.

And wait.

After thirty minutes, I conclude that I’ve been blown off. I head back into the icy parking lot and walk to my car. In a weird way, I’m relieved.

I get into the Honda, start the engine and that is when my cell chirps. Incoming direct message from Akasha: “*Sorry for being late.”*

A moment. I scan the parking lot for any signs of Akasha rushing toward Starbucks. There is no sign of her.

My confusion deepens, eyes scanning the parking area. I send a reply: “*Where are you?”*

I receive my answer in the form of another buzzing text. “*Behind you.”*

I check the rearview mirror again and...

Akasha is staring back at me.

She lurks right behind the car, black mane of hair cascading to frame her alabaster skin. Beautiful in an almost translucent, darkly heroin-chic way. An ethereal beauty.

I frown. I could’ve sworn she wasn't there an instant ago.

Akasha enigmatic gaze haunts me from the rear-view mirror. Her long red nails drum the keypad of her cellphone.

Her next message lights up my phone. “*I’m freezing.”*

I'm still staring at this message, when my new Internet friend appears at the passenger door and flashes me a tentative smile.

She wants me to let her into the car.

*What are you doing, bro?*

After a beat, I open the door and let Akasha into my car and into my life.

\* \* \*

Heavy snowfall tattoos the windshield of my parked car, erasing the other vehicles in the parking lot from view. Starbucks feels like a blurry silhouette in the far distance.

For a moment, we sit in uneasy silence inside my parked vehicle. Thankfully my Spotify playlist is playing tunes at a muted volume. The music gives the situation a sheen of normalcy.

I'm acutely aware of Akasha's beauty and closeness. My stomach churns with anxiety.

I hate to admit it, but I'm both drawn to Akasha and scared of her boldness. How many beautiful women would climb into some stranger's car in 2023?

This girl is reckless.

*Or dangerous.*

Deep down, I know this is wrong on so many levels. I weirdly feel like I'm betraying Lynn.

This was a big mistake.

This woman could be connected to two deaths, and I’m letting her into my life. But Akasha’s fragile demeanor is disarming. Somehow she doesn’t strike me as someone who could douse a man on fire. Even if she had the psychotic will to commit such terrible crimes, surely she lacks the sheer physicality to pull them off.

Is her beauty blinding me to her true nature?

"Sorry to ambush you like this, but Starbucks is super-crowded. And loud.  Hard to get to know someone when you can barely hear yourself think."

I nod as if Akasha's explanation makes this whole thing less weird.

She leans closer, and I grip my steering wheel a little harder. My stomach is coiled tight. I can smell her sweet perfume, every fiber of me aware of her physical closeness.

"You seem nervous, Mark. This the first time you met someone off the internet?"

*Shit, is it that obvious.*

“I normally don’t let strangers into my car,” I say.

“I'm glad you made an exception in my case.”

Akasha holds my gaze for a beat.

“Be honest now. How many girls have you met on Tinder?”

She flashes me a playful, seductive smile.

I shrug sheepishly.

“You’re the first.”

Man, after two years of being in a relationship, I have zero game. But Akasha seems weirdly charmed.

“Now that is a refreshing response.” Akasha smiles as she nods.

Akasha shifts her legs, and I can feel a bead of sweat pearl down my neck.

“Listen, I haven’t been quite honest with you.”

“Uh-oh, not sure if I like the sound of this.”

A popular pop song suddenly fills my car.

Akasha lights up. “I love this band.”

She begins to sensually move her body to the rhythm of the music.

I watch her, unable to take his eyes off this beautiful woman. This meeting has completely slipped out of my control.

Akasha suddenly grabs my right hand. Her touch is electric. Her hand feels warm and inviting in mine. As if holding hands with this enigmatic creature was the most natural thing in the world.

I manage to  pull back. Akasha eyes me curiously, surprised by my prudish resistance.

“What’s wrong? Don’t you like me?”

Akasha leans in and gives me a quick kiss on the cheek. It catches me by surprise.  Despite all the weirdness, a part of me is excited by her bold move.

Once again, I pull away but my efforts are becoming more half-hearted.

“Listen, I can’t do this…” The words are meant to discourage her, but she interprets them as an invitation. She comes in for another kiss, ready to take things further.

*Akasha…*

I hear Josh’s words in my mind, and Lynn’s smiling face invades my thoughts. I stiffen and pull away.

“What's wrong?” Akasha asks in a suddenly vulnerable voice.

“I’m sorry, I can't do this...”

I lower my gaze, unable to hold Akasha's unflinching stare. I wipe the sweat off my brow.

*My God, why is it so hot in here all of a sudden?*

I unzip my jacket, reacting to the rising heat in the vehicle. “It's getting kinda hot. Let me turn down the heater...”

I do as promised and roll down my steamed-up window.

It barely helps with the rising heat.

I turn toward Akasha who is staring at me expectantly. Her features now locked in an expressionless mask.

My words lack any real force as speak. “You're beautiful, Akasha, but I’m involved.”

“How involved?”

“I have a girlfriend.”

The truth is out. Time to bring up Josh and explain the real reason for this meeting. But Akasha doesn’t give me a chance. Her stern expression softens.

“Shit, I thought you were going to say you’re married.”

“Listen, I haven’t been completely honest with you. I wanted to talk about my brother Josh—”

Akasha cuts me off with another kiss, almost as if Josh is a taboo subject. And to my own shock, this time I return the affection.

As our make-out session intensifies, Akasha keeps kissing my face and necks. Her lips feel hot to the touch. There is a hunger here, almost a mad desperation.

And that’s when my nostrils fill with an acrid, burning stench. Akasha’s kisses grow ashen, as if she finished smoking a pack of cigarettes before showing up for this date.

Alarmed by an overpowering sensation, I pull back from Akasha.

She eyes me with blank eyes. The woman staring back at me bears little resemblance to the playful gal who first let herself into my car.

There is anger in that gaze. Rage.

Akasha shoots me a final withering glare, and opens the door.

Before I can say anything else, Akasha darts out of my Honda and dashes off into the snowy night.

Despite my growing fear, I decide to go after her. As soon as I get out of my vehicle, blowing ice particles slap my face. Talk about a shock to the system after baking in my toasty car. My eyes try to penetrate the flurry, but there’s no sign of Akasha.

“Akasha?”

I don’t receive an answer. I’m alone on the edge of the icy road. Cars tear past me on a sporadic basis, rubber splashing along the slippery asphalt.

My gaze scans the white surroundings, but Akasha is gone, and I’m left to wonder about what just transpired.

I can't shake the growing fear in the pit of my stomach.

Things don't get any better once I'm back inside my car. As my glance fall on the rear-view mirror, something gives me pause.

I noticed the three small marks on my neck. The spots where Akasha kissed me, where her hot lips touched my skin.

Not hickeys as I first feared but... burn marks. It’s as if my skin made contact with a hot metal surface and donated some skin in the process. How did I sustain these injuries without noticing them sooner?

And then I'm reminded of the cryptic message on Akasha’s Tinder profile, and I can't help shaking with existential dread.

*Love burns you when it’s hot.*
