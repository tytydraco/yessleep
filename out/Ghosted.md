I was hoping Jennifer would tell me more after that cryptic statement, but she clammed up. Damn, my whole visit turned out to be a bust. She did provide me with one insight – I’m not the only who might in danger.

Akasha could come after Lynn.

The thought terrifies me.

I couldn’t live with myself if anything happened to her. I conclude that I’m done with this amateur investigator shit and go straight to the cops. An hour later I find myself in a bustling squad room. But now that I’m sitting across from Detective Peterson and feel his scrutinizing gaze on me, I feel like I’ve made a mistake. In his mid-forties and clearly the world-weary kind of cop, he doesn’t suffer fools easily. At the moment he is trying to decide if I belong in the drunk tank.

“Okay, to sum it up,” he says, checking his notes. “Your brother and his best friend hooked up with the same lady on Tinder, and you think she burned them alive?”

*Dammit, I know how it sounds.*

“And this cyber-sex version of a black widow killer is now after you?”

“She’s been stalking me and my girlfriend! Who knows what this crazy bitch is going to do next?”

My raised voice doesn’t earn me any respect from Peterson. “You might want to turn it down a tad.”

Detective Peterson peruses some police department records on his laptop. The first file contains pictures of Josh and his burned-up bedroom.

“According to the fire department, there was nothing suspicious about the fire that killed your brother. It was an unfortunate accident. Case closed.”

“They didn't have all the facts.” Detective Peterson’s patience might be running low, but he’s not the only one.

I want to shout at the man, tell him about David who was found near the Starbucks parking lot burned to a crisp and all the others. But I lack concrete evidence for any of these assumptions. Keeping the story focused on Josh, Steve and my own experience sounds crazy enough.

“So if this girl kills her cyber dates, why did she spare you?”

It’s a good question, one that I’ve been asking myself for the last few hours. Why am I still alive? What separates me from all her other victims?

“I don’t know,” I say, and that’s actually when the answer hits me. I was spared because I didn’t give Akasha what she wants. Josh and Steve (and all the others, I presume) slept with her. I didn’t. My loyalty to Lynn triggered Akasha’s obsessive, stalker-like behavior, but it also could explain why she hasn’t burned me.

Yet.

I’m smart enough to keep my mouth shut about this epiphany. Peterson must already think I’m doing drugs. I can imagine what his response would be: “*So this psycho chick is stalking guys who don’t put out?”*

Sounds crazy. But so does everything else about this case, as Peterson keeps reminding me. How does a nineteen year old woman torch dozens of men over a period of months without ever leaving a trace of forensic evidence? How does she manage to set up elaborate accidents or trigger fires that don’t spread? What am I really dealing with here?

Peterson stops his stare-down contest. I guess he’s convinced I’m not high, which makes me either delusional or a skilled prankster. Either way, he wants me out of here so he can move on with his day and work real cases.

“You’re free to file a complaint if you like,” he explains, “but without any forensic evidence, witnesses or motive, there's not much I can do.”

That’s it. Case closed. Time for a donut. I can’t even blame the guy.

“You have to help me…” My voice shakes with helpless frustration.

“Why don’t you show me this lady’s Tinder profile so I can include it in the report.”

I hesitate for a moment before I open up Tinder and find Akasha’s profile. For a split second, I fear that she might have deleted her profile, almost as if she knew I might go to the cops. My fear proves unfounded. Akasha is still on Tinder ,and I share her profile with the grumpy Detective. Not that I think it will do much good.

The detective’s eyes turn into slits as he studies the profile.

Something in Peterson’s expression is different now. Where earlier I could only pick up his impatience, I now recognize a new emotion — suspicion. His next question catches me off guard.

“You sure this is the girl you met up with?”

“Yeah.”

Peterson nods pensively and says, “Let me show you something.” He indicates for me to follow him, and I oblige. You don’t want to argue with the NYPD.

We step outside the bustling office and arrive in an adjacent hallway. Peterson moves to a wall filled with the headshots of missing teens, mostly females. Each passport-style photograph is accompanied by pertinent details. Peterson points at one of the pictures and my breath hitches.

It’s Akasha. She’s got her own missing poster. My mind reels as I try to process this new piece of information.

“Akasha Samona,” Peterson says. “Missing for ten months now. No one in her family has seen or heard from her.”

“I’ve met up with her twice in the last week alone.”

The words earn me another skeptical glance from the detective, and his frustration boils to the surface. He’s wondering what kind of game I’m playing. For a moment, he indulges me, probably hoping I trip myself up and reveal Akasha’s whereabouts. I’ve gone from potential victim to nuisance to suspect in the space of a few minutes.

“You sure about this?” he asks.

“Why would I be lying to you about something like this?”

I can see that he’s itching to speak his mind, but he keeps it together. He’s a professional.

“Normally when someone goes missing for this long, they either don't want to be found or something really bad happened to them.“

The chilling implication sinks in.

He takes a step closer, and I have to repress the urge to back away. “Any idea where Akasha might be at the moment?”

“I only talked to her online before she started showing up places. I don't even have her number.”

I can tell he doesn’t quite believe me.

I can't take my eyes off the poster, mind consumed with one burning question.

*What happened to Akasha?*

\*\*\*

I’m shaken by what I learned at the police precinct. In a trancelike state, I make my way to the nearest subway station and head back into Manhattan. I’m supposed to meet Lynn at the library, and she expects an explanation for why I skipped out on today’s crucial quiz, especially when my grade-point average is borderline. I’m not sure yet what I’m going to tell her.

My thoughts cycle back to Akasha. I replay our recent encounters in my mind and all throughout, Peterson’s words haunt me.

*“Normally when someone goes missing for this long, they either don't want to be found or something really bad happened to them.“*

A theory is forming in the back of my mind. My rational view of the world is fighting the idea, though. It can’t be...

By the time I reach downtown Manhattan, a new message waits for me. The text isn’t from Lynn but from Akasha.

The message sends a shiver down my back.

“*Met your girlfriend. You could do so much better.”*

Horrified, I call Lynn right away. No response.

I ring again and leave voicemail. I send two texts.

Still nothing.

The eerie, uncharacteristic radio silence continues.

*What have you done, Akasha?*

I know Lynn won’t be waiting for me at the library. My best bet is to head to her apartment in Astoria and hope that’s where I’ll find her.

For a terrible moment I worry that Akasha has harmed Lynn. Jennifer’s destroyed features surface in my mind.

As I hit the road, I try to push my fears aside but fail miserably.

I arrive at Lynn’s place. After letting myself in, I suddenly breathe easily when I realize she’s home. Alive and unharmed.

My relief is short-lived.

She’s been crying and her mascara runs down her cheeks in black streaks. Her open laptop rests in front of her. Before I can utter a word, Lynn cuts me off. “Your new friend looked me up today. She couldn't stop talking about you.”

I step closer. She holds up her cell phone. An unknown number has texted her screen grabs from my Tinder chat with Akasha including a damning shot of my own Tinder profile.  Lynn’s eyes narrow behind the curtain of tears.

“If you don't want to be with me anymore, then break up with me. But don't play games.”

“I swear to you, I can explain…”

“Are you saying you didn't meet up with her the other day?”

It’s a loaded question and I reply slowly. “I did, but here’s why...”

This is all Lynn needs to hear. I realize she’s already made up her mind about this, and who can blame her?

“I know it looks bad, but it's a long story. I needed to talk to her about Josh...“

“Stop lying to me-”

“Lynn, please...”

“Just tell me one thing, and don't lie. Did anything happen between the two of you?”

My little make-out session with Akasha flashes through my mind, and I hesitate. I’m a terrible liar. My wavering gaze confirms my guilt. Fighting back tears, Lynn says, “I think you should leave.”

“Lynn, let me explain... This girl is dangerous. Josh is dead because of her...”

Instead of helping my cause, this comment only makes things worse. Lynn glares at me, her tears making way for a growing rage. “Stop it. This is pathetic. I thought you loved me, Mark. But I guess I was wrong. Just get out. Please!”

I’m about to plead with her when Lynn’s hostile stare stops me cold. Her pain is too fresh and raw for her to listen to my crazy tale of spontaneous combustion. This round goes to you, Akasha.

As I step out of Lynn’s place and head back to the street, I try to console myself by saying things could be worse. Akasha could’ve tried to harm Lynn physically. In a way, Lynn backing away from our relationship might keep her safe — at least in the short term.

I debate my next move.

Part of me is tempted to walk straight into the nearest bar and get loaded. But nothing will be gained from numbing my mind. Forty men died because of this girl, and I need to find out why.

For the moment, I roll with the punches. Something crazy is going on here, and I’d better get to the bottom of this mystery before it’s too late.

\*\*\*

My car snakes its way down a winding road. The temperature has dropped and it’s snowing again.

I pull up to a middle class, one-family house. A massive snowdrift weighs down the structure. Ominous icicles sprout from the edge of the roof like razor-sharp teeth.

I park my beaten-up Honda and approach the property, which is enclosed by a wooden fence. The only sound comes from my shoes as they crunch the hard-packed snow.

I reach the door and ring the doorbell. Waiting in silence, I watch my breath mist in the cold.

Approaching footsteps grow audible. The door opens, revealing Akasha's mother. Mrs. Samona. I located her Flushing Queens address on the Internet while reading up on her missing daughter.

I’m a little surprised that I’d never heard about Akasha’s case, as her disappearance made all the local news channels. Of course, this is New York City where people disappear on a daily basis. Media coverage of shootings, robberies and assaults present a ticker tape parade of life in the Big Apple. After a while, the stories blur together and one can’t keep track of the steady stream of human tragedy.

Akasha lived with her parents until she disappeared ten months ago. As I take in the mother, I understand where Akasha got her striking looks. Mrs. Samona is middle-aged but well kept. Thanks to diet, exercise and genetics, she has launched a full-out assault against her advancing years. Akasha’s mom wears stylish athletic wear and despite the season she sports a dark complexion, courtesy of a tanning salon.

“Mrs. Samona?”

Mrs. Samona studies me for a beat. There’s heat in her gaze, an air of sexuality.

“You must be Mark Valentine. Please come in.”

I called ahead, so she knows why I’m here. Or she thinks she does, at any rate.

A few minutes later, I’m sitting on the couch. The sexual tension in the room cannot be denied. The way she eyes me, smiles, keeps squeezing my hand... For a moment I have a vision of Mr. Samona popping into the living room and suspecting the worst.

Akasha’s mother pours herself a glass of wine. Must be time for an early happy hour. She offers me a glass, and I quickly decline, but she insists. I promise myself I will only nurse the drink.

“You wouldn't believe the health benefits of red wine,” she says.

I take my obligatory sip and say, “Thank you, Mrs. Samona.”

“Call me Jane.” She smiles. “So how can I help you?”

“As I told you on the phone, I'm a journalism major and I’m doing a piece on missing teens.”

The best cover story I could come up with on short notice, it sounded plausible to me at the time but now I’m not so sure. Fortunately, Mrs. Samona doesn’t seem to question my reasons for being here, and I internally sigh in relief.

“So you want to write about my daughter?”

“I'm trying to give the story a human face.”

*Am I laying it on too thick?*

“Akasha would love this. She has a tendency toward the dramatic. A trait she inherited from her father.”

“What do you think happened to her?”

This is a tricky question and I’m venturing into dangerous emotional territory. Fortunately, Mrs. Samona clearly doesn’t believe anything bad befell her daughter, or at least the armor of her denial doesn’t allow her to go there right now. “She ran away. To spite me. But she'll be back.”

Mrs. Samona drains her glass and pours herself another one. I begin to see the cracks in the chipper façade she’s constructed for herself. “This is just her way of telling me that I was a bad mother. I know my daughter.”

*Do you really?*

“You tried tracking her down?”

“Her dad hired a private detective to search for her. He hit pretty much every strip club on the Eastern Seaboard. I hope they threw in a few free lap-dances for his efforts.”

I’m beginning to realize that her callous attitude masks a frightened woman who isn’t quite sure that her daughter is all right, after all.

“I'm sorry, Mrs. Samona. I mean, Jane... I was wondering if I could look around? To get a sense of who Akasha was...” I break off, cursing inwardly. Fortunately Mrs. Samona – Jane – is too buzzed to register my slip-up or take offense. Instead she says, “Her room is upstairs at the end of the hallway, to your right.”

I wait for Mrs. Samona to escort me to Akasha’s room, but she just keeps gulping down her wine.

*Awkward.*

I guess she is giving me free rein to explore the house.

I get up and head for the nearby staircase. A minute later I’m standing in front of Akasha’s bedroom. Pushing the door open, I feel like an intruder.

*Like I shouldn’t be here.*

I soak in my new surroundings. The bedroom is exactly what you’d expect from a rebellious young woman. Dark art and posters of edgy rock stars abound. I comb the bookshelves and spot various tracts on Eastern religion, anarchist politics, bios of cutting-edge musicians.

I zero in on the computer sitting on a small desk. I touch the keyboard, half expecting Tinder to pop up on her desktop. But the screen remains blank.

I continue searching the room and notice a framed photograph on Akasha’s nightstand.

It shows Akasha with a girlfriend who’s wearing a Starbucks uniform.

Shit, I recognize this Starbucks. This is where I first met Akasha. Someone scrawled a message over the picture with a black Sharpie: *Friends forever, Liza.*

I make a mental note to ask Jane about her daughter’s friend Liza.

Beside the bed I find a journal filled with dark drawings and weird writing. I don’t expect to discover any earth-shattering secrets within, but hopefully it’ll give me a better sense of Akasha’s character.

It doesn’t.

After a few pages, the drawings and cryptic writing end. I realize that it’s more of a creative book of poetry or lyrics than a diary.

This all changes once I turn to the journal’s last page.

An eerie message stares back at me: *Why don’t you love me, Mark?*

I drop the journal, gripped by a wave of terror.

How is this possible?

For a split second I can’t shake the sensation that Akasha is here in the room with me. My mind is reeling. How could this message exist? Did Mrs. Samona lie to me? Did Akasha come back?

I must get out of this room. Out of this house. Away from the madness that has invaded my life. I want things to go back to the way they were before I met Akasha.

As I storm back down the stairs, Mrs. Samona says, “That was quick. Find everything you needed for your story?”

I nod and quickly leave the house. Outside, it’s finally stopped snowing. The looming snowdrifts and frosted trees glitter with ice. Somehow their shapes are now imbued with a sinister quality.

As I stomp across the white expanse, the long winter shadows are heavy and the Samona home slowly recedes behind me. Suddenly I pause, beads of sweat bursting on my forehead.

*As if the temperature has shot up thirty degrees.*

I unbutton my jacket and remove my hat. A splashing sound draws my attention. With each step I take, the snow beneath my feet grows more watery. It’s melting at incredible speed...

I stop dead in my tracks as I pick up another noise.

*CRACK-CRACK-CRACK.* Slowly, I turn...

My eyes lock on the icicles hanging from the Samona house. The ice cracks and flexes...

Right before my eyes, the snow on the roof evaporates and sheets of water cascade down the side of the house. The small waterfall is a surreal sight.

I stare open-mouthed as it dawns on me that I’m now standing in a giant puddle. Part of me wants to start screaming.

LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!

Instead, I jump into my car and take off.

I know exactly who I need to talk to next.

I must return to the place where this madness started.
