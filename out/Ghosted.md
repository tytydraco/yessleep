**3**

Once again I’m facing the operating table and gearing up to make my first incision into the cadaver. It’s the same body from the day before, the young man who was struck down in his prime.

“Today we’ll be focusing on head and neck anatomy...” Dr. Wallace says, but I’m not paying attention.

Lynn reaches for the mask that covers the corpse’s features and begins to remove it. I’m about to see the face of the dead man we’ve carved up in the name of higher education. To my horror, the visage staring back at me is all too familiar.

*I’m looking at Josh.*

His skin is a darkened mass of burnt tissue but those haunted eyes belong to my brother. It gets worse as the charred death mask turns toward me. I cry out and recoil, dropping the surgical blade. It clatters to floor of the classroom, echoing.

Panic explodes in my chest and I’m unable to catch my breath. A hand touches my shoulder. It’s Wallace, our professor. A concerned frown furrows his brows. “Are you okay, son?”

Good question. If the experiences of the last few days are any indicator, the answer is a resounding no. My eyes drift back to the corpse. The lifeless features are those of a stranger. The stares of Lynn and the other students are mortifying. Their expressions range from pity to surprise to dark amusement.

I trade a quick glance with Lynn. I spot the love and concern in her gaze, and I feel like a shit for my behavior last night. I inhale sharply and eye Dr. Wallace.

“Take the afternoon off,” he says. “It happens to the best of us.”

I nod and leave the anatomy classroom. Lynn’s worried gaze follows me all the way. She wants to come after me, but I wave her off.

*Everything’s okay, babe.*

I’m lying.

I head to the cafeteria and order a coffee while I wait for the class to let out. I sip the bitter brew, which goes down like a cup of ashes.

*Or like a kiss from Akasha.*

Forty minutes later, Lynn joins me.

“What happened?” she asks.

Good question. *What did happen?*

“I think I need to get some rest. Too many nights of burning the midnight oil. It’s starting to catch up to me.”

Lynn studies me with a doubtful expression, not quite convinced.

“You sure you’re okay?”

“I’m fine.”

“Let’s do something fun tonight,” she says. “How about we plan a real date?”

“Sounds like a great idea.”

It’s been way too long since we’ve gone out.

“I’ll come up with something,“ Lynn says. “Be ready by eight.”

I relax. Despite a crazy study schedule that doesn’t leave much room for romantic outings, Lynn is going to carve out a window of time. Because she knows we need it.

God, I love this girl.

The plan for the rest of the day is simple. I’m going to study my ass off. If I’m going to have fun tonight, I must maintain my focus and clear some work off my plate. I head to the library and find a quiet corner where the world can forget I exist. A place where knowledge and science dominate and the twisted soap opera of my life will seem small and insignificant.

For the first two hours I make excellent progress. A quiz is coming up in my biology class, and I want to be prepared. My grade-point average is solid, if not spectacular. I flunk one test and it could jeopardize my academic future. I can’t slack off or use tragedy as an excuse for failure.

My cell phone chimes. One glance at it and the events of the last day catch up with me. Akasha is direct messaging me again.

Shit, I totally forgot to delete the Tinder app on my phone.

“*What are you up to?”*

I eye the message, phrased innocently enough. I thought that after what happened last night, we’d be done. I guess I was wrong.

I break down and respond to this latest communication.

Me: “*Doing homework.”*

Akasha: “*Need any help?”*

Cute response, and I almost smile. Akasha waits for a beat before sending the next message.

“*When can I see you again?”*

I can no longer sugarcoat this. Better to be honest and direct.

I type: “*I don't think that would be a good idea. I told you, I have a girlfriend.”*

*“Where was your girlfriend when* *you made out with me last night?”*

Akasha logs off, and I stare at my cell in silence.

Outside it’s snowing again. White clumps of melting ice drift down the glass pane, and I’m glad that I’m indoors. I turn off my phone and plan to get some work done.

Around five I call it quits and brave the weather. I leave the library and catch the F-train back into Queens. It takes another forty minutes to arrive in Briarwood, but I get lucky and manage to snag a seat. I continue to study my flash cards while the train rattles its way through the city.

I switch on my phone again and am relieved to not find any messages from Akasha. I check in with Lynn and she tells me to meet her at one of her favorite hole-in-wall Thai places in Queens. We’re going to dodge the Manhattan commute and keep things local tonight. I can only stomach one trip into the city per day, especially during the winter months. Rain is coming down in raw, cold sheets as I emerge from the subway station. I make a mad dash for my apartment building which is only a block away from the station. It’s impossible to not get wet, even though I’m moving pretty fast.

When I reach the entrance, I go stock-still.

Someone is waiting for me below the front awning.

*Akasha.*

Her dress is soaked and pasted to her beautiful figure, leaving little to the imagination. There’s a trace of anger in my voice as I address her. “What the hell are you doing here?”

A sob escapes from Akasha's throat, and I realize tears are mixing with the melted snow on her face. She is hugging herself and shaking in the icy downpour. A pitiful sight.

Seeing her vulnerable like that dampens my anger, and I feel like a shit for going off on her. I pop the door open and say, “You better come in before you catch pneumonia.”

She faces me from behind a curtain of cold tears and nods. I hold the door open for her, and she brushes past, her wet skin grazing mine.

The contact is electric. Alarm bells go off inside my head, but I choose to ignore them.

Ten minutes later, Akasha sits in my kitchen, a towel wrapped around her soaked shoulders. A teakettle heats on the stove, and I’m about to make some tea for us.

I eye Akasha with trepidation as I notice the curves outlined under the wet material of her clothes. For a second, Akasha’s eyes fix on me, catching me in the act. But from the way she smiles, it seems she doesn’t mind me checking her out.

“I like your place,” she says.

“Thanks.”

“You live with a roommate?”

I nod, perhaps a little too quickly. “Yeah.

“Where is he?”

“Cyrus is still at work.”

“I guess there's no one here to interrupt us.”

“There's nothing to interrupt.”

Akasha rises and the towel drops to the floor. I can see the outline of her breasts under her wet T-shirt and this confirms what I’ve suspected since I first saw her outside my building – she’s not wearing a bra.

“I wonder what Lynn would think if she found me here?”

There’s an edge in my voice as I respond. “How do you know my girlfriend's name?”

“Relax. She doesn't know about us.”

“What are you talking about? There’s no ‘us’ to know about.”

“You could've fooled me the other night. I loved the way you kissed me.”

She takes another step toward me. The water makes her clothes cling to her shapely figure in a primal way. This is getting out of hand.

“What are you doing?”

“What do you want me to do?”

Mere inches separate us. It would be so easy to reach out, tear those clothes off and take her right here and now. I know she wants me to, but I can’t do this to Lynn.

Akasha presses her body into mine. “I know you feel the same way,” she says. “I can see it in your eyes. Why fight it?”

Why? Because there’s an amazing gal out there who cares about me. And I don’t want to break her heart. I can’t risk my relationship for the sake of a fleeting experience with a hot but emotionally unbalanced girl.

Cyrus’ voice echoes in my head. *Don’t stick your dick in crazy.*

I grow resolute. I’m not going to succumb to temptation.

“Listen, you better leave. If you need me to call you a cab, I will.”

I see the stunned look on Akasha’s face and I’m worried. Is this what happened with Josh? Did he push her away after he realized she was bad news? Did he pay the ultimate price for his rejection?

“Who do you think I am?” There’s an undertone of menace in her voice. “Someone you can just kick out once you're done with me?“

Her gaze is distant and it feels like she is reliving some other past, talking about another guy, another relationship. How often has this been her story? One-night stands that started hot and heavy but ended with her being shown the door and ghosted?

That does it. I snap. My anger is fueled by fear. Something is wrong with this girl, and I can’t stop thinking about Josh’s dying gasp and the terror in his eyes as he mouthed his final message – her name.

The reason I contacted Akasha has gotten lost in the course of this seductive game, but I won’t lose sight of it again. “I tried to be a nice guy, but you don't seem to get it. I have a girlfriend. I don't know what your problem is, but I want you out of here. Now.”

Her eyes narrow into slits and become intense, blazing with emotion. Beads of perspiration bloom on my face. The heat in the apartment appears to be rising.

Then the moment passes and the same vulnerability I saw earlier, in the rain, creeps back into her face.

“Don't you like me, Mark? Just a little?”

Before I can come up with the proper response, the fire alarm goes off. The sound is sharp and shrill. I search the kitchen for a sign of smoke or anything else that could have set off the alarm. I don’t detect any visible cause.

I rush over to the alarm. Seeing no other choice, I pop out the battery. The noise dies down.

I whirl back to Akasha...

But she is gone. It’s a small apartment so it doesn’t take long to be sure she isn’t hiding somewhere.

I open the front door and poke my head out to peer down the now empty hallway. There is no sign of Akasha.

\*\*\*

The Thai restaurant Lynn picked is a hole-in-the-wall in the true sense of the word. The décor is forgettable and the place is cramped and crowded. Small individual tables are so close together we might as well be dining at a communal table. I like meeting new folks, but not while I’m on a date with my girl. But the food makes up for the inconvenience. The joint is a fave among hipsters, artists, musicians and students – in other words, poor people like ourselves who appreciate delectable chow at bargain prices.

Lynn is enjoying her dinner and babbling away about her day. She suddenly pauses.

“You haven't heard a word I said.”

I offer her a guilty-as-charged smile.

“I'm sorry, babe. I'm not myself today.”

“Don't worry about it. I can't imagine how hard this must be. I was hoping a night out might get your mind off what happened...”

“And it did,” I say perhaps a little too quickly. “Thanks again, honey.”

I take Lynn’s hand and am leaning forward to kiss her when the candle on our table lights by itself. There’s a flare of light from the other tables as their candles flicker to life in unison.

My perplexed gaze roves around the restaurant, and that’s when I spot Akasha standing at the entrance. Her face is a blank slate, but the jealousy in her unblinking eyes is all too clear.

I jump to my feet. Lynn stares at me, startled.

“What's wrong?”

I don’t offer an answer but instead turn away from the table. This must end now. With quick strides I cross the restaurant and close in on Akasha.

She spins and rushes toward a nearby doorway.

I pick up the pace.

So does Akasha.

Moments later, she vanishes through the door.

I’m right behind her.

I burst through the door and find myself in a dank hallway. At the far end, Akasha disappears through another door into the ladies’ room.

“Akasha... Wait!”

I reach the door, hesitate for a second and overcome my social conditioning to enter.

“Akasha...”

A young woman, hair dyed blue, leans over the wash-basin. Working on her makeup, she peers up at me with visible irritation and drops her black lipstick. It rolls on the floor.

“Dude, what are you doing here?”

I attempt a weak apology.

The disconcerted punk chick doesn't stick around for an explanation and rushes out of the bathroom. She doesn't even bother to scoop up her lipstick.

I take a deep breath and scan the room. No windows or other exits. *Akasha must still be in here.*

My attention shifts to the two stalls and I listen intently. The only sound is my breathing.

“Akasha?”

No response.

*Surprise, surprise.*

I approach the first stall. It turns out to be empty.

I pause. My face is coated in perspiration. It’s not just from my little sprint. Did someone crank up the heater in here? I wipe the sweat from my face and turn to the second stall.

*Is Akasha waiting* *behind the door?*

“Akasha, I know you're in there...”

Still no answer. *Okay, keep playing this game if you must.*

I push the door and it swings open, revealing… another empty stall.

I catch my dumbfounded reflection in the bathroom mirror. *Where did Akasha go?*

I comb the room but there’s no explanation. Now I’m spooked.

Defeated, I’m about to retreat before some other female enters the washroom when my eyes fall on the exit. A message has been scrawled on the door with the same lipstick the punk-lady dropped a minute earlier.

It reads: “*WHY WERE YOU MAKING OUT WITH THAT WHORE?”*

I swallow hard, mouth dry with fear.

Is Akasha threatening to go after Lynn?

I embarked on this adventure with Akasha for the right reasons.

I wanted to solve my brother’s untimely passing.

But I’m way in over my head at this point.

\*\*\*

I pull up to Lynn's apartment building and kill the engine. Sleet pelts the windshield and streams down the glass. For a moment we just sit there in silence.

“What happened back there at the restaurant? Who were you running after?”

“I thought I saw someone I know.”

Lynn’s brows furrow into a puzzled expression. She’s not buying my story.

“I've never seen you act like that before.”

An awkward beat. The new distance between us is palpable.

I can tell Lynn wants to probe further but backs down. She knows me well enough not to push me into a corner.

“You sure you don't want to stay over?” Lynn asks, changing the subject.

“Got to get up early tomorrow and cram for that anatomy quiz.”

Lynn seems to understand this but is unable to hide her disappointment. She verbalizes what has been eating away at her for the last few days. “Everything is cool between us, right?”

“Of course,“ I say automatically.

Lynn doesn’t seem convinced.

“Mark, I'm here for you if you need me.”

“I know.”

Another beat. We hug.

“You sure you don't want to spend the night? I want to be with you.”

“I’m with you. Just trying to avoid all distractions before the quiz tomorrow.”

*Maybe you should try avoiding Akasha?*

“You better get an A, Dr. Valentine.”

She plants a quick peck on my cheek, gets out of my car and walks up to her apartment building. I stay until I’m convinced she’s safely inside.

\*\*\*\*

It’s past eleven when I park the Honda near my Briarwood pad. I get lucky and find a spot a few feet from the main entrance. My life is a bit of an emotional rollercoaster at the moment, but it seems my parking karma remains solid.

I approach my place and almost expect to find Akasha waiting for me again but the front lobby is deserted.

As soon as I’m in my apartment, I slam a Red Bull and attack the books. Unfortunately, the energy drink only buys me thirty minutes before my concentration wavers and my eyes grow heavy. I decide to catch a power nap. I allow myself only thirty minutes. Setting an alarm on my phone, I  close my eyes.

When I open them again, a quick glimpse at the clock reveals it’s 4 a.m. I’ve been out for four hours. So much for the alarm!

I suddenly sense shadowy movement in the darkness and conclude I’m not alone. I lie on my bed, senses alert, heart thrumming in my chest, uncertain what to do next. A sound from the corner of the room draws my attention.

I bolt upright, adrenaline surging. Wide-awake now. My eyes bore into the dark, and I make out Akasha looming at the foot of the bed, gazing down at me.

“*Why don't you like me?”*

She is crying now. Tears slide down her cheeks and hit the floor in what seems like slow motion. They ignite like napalm upon contact. In a sudden flash, I find myself surrounded by a ring of fire. The flames flicker hungrily.

I’m shocked to discover that my body is paralyzed as the roaring inferno tightens around me. I want to scream for help, but solely manage a croak. This is what must have happened to Josh.

And it’s about to happen to me.

My prediction comes true a beat later as the fire engulfs the bedspread. Within seconds the pillows, comforters and sheets are engulfed in roaring flames.

As the blaze devours my flesh, I let out a piercing scream...

\* \* \*

My eyes snap open and the scream becomes a gasp for air as I jerk awake. I’m covered in sweat, my T-shirt sticking to me like a second skin. My eyes tick back and forth, scanning the room.

There’s no fire.

*No sign of Akasha.*

I shake off the last vestiges of sleep, and it all sinks in. It was just a nightmare.

I take a deep breath, wishing I was at Lynn’s place where I could roll over and cling to the reassuring physicality of another human being. But the bed, like the room, is empty.

It’s barely five o’clock. Great. I have a quiz in a few hours. Might as well just stay up and hit the books.

I climb out of bed and stagger toward my bathroom. I flick on the light and squint under the harsh glare. I lean over the sink to splash water on my face. My body is trembling, still affected by the horror of the dream.

I peer up at my reflection and freeze.

The mirror reveals a disturbing sight. The blackened outline of a hand’s imprint has burned itself into the doorjamb behind me.

I turn and inspect the handprint. The charred wood is still hot to the touch and leaves black ashen marks on my fingertips. A wave of dread washes over me and this time I know it’s not a dream.

\*\*\*

Daylight streams into my bedroom, a sharp reminder that I overslept. My ambitious plan to get some studying done in the early hours of the morning never materialized. Despite my experience in the bathroom, I managed to fall asleep again. A soon as my head hit the pillow, I was out cold. Maybe the world has become too much to handle. Sleep offers a much-needed refuge from the horror.

Now that I’m awake, reality comes crashing down on me with a vengeance. Besides this whole Akasha weirdness, quizzes are coming up and papers are due. I’m going to have to catch up somehow.

I get up and stagger to my desk. I try to resist looking at my phone but fail miserably. I let out a sigh of relief when I find no new direct messages from Akasha. A part of me prays I never hear from her again.

My attention shifts to the latest new stories, hoping the world’s problems will distract me from my own.

Bad move.

I almost immediately come across a local news story that chills me to the bone. A young black man was found burnt to a crisp in his car right outside the Starbucks where I met Akasha. I grip my desk as my heart hammers against my rip cage. Weird coincidence or did Akasha find a new victim?

And this leads to another terrifying thought.

Perhaps John and Steve weren’t the first victims. Perhaps there are others.

I tentatively open my Google search window.

I type "FIRE ACCIDENTS" into the search field.

"*120O ARTICLES FOUND."* All kinds of accidents all across the country.

This won’t work. I decide to modify my search. I add two words into the search box. *"YOUNG MEN.”* This still produces too many results. Then I further narrow it down by specifying the geographic area. I input Astoria Queens and this brings the number down to twenty-two. Still shockingly high but somewhat more manageable.

I spend the next few hours reading through one story after another. Freak accident after another. Some of the young men perished in home fires, some in fiery car accidents. All of them died within a ten mile radius. I don’t want to accept it but the grisly news stories speak for themselves.

After a few hours of this, I’m ready to call it quits. Each story is nearly identical to the last. The only differences are the changing pictures of the dead and slight variations in the facts of the case. Twenty-four men have died in unexplainable fires over the course of the last ten months.

*She got you all*, I think.

And I know who might be next in line.

To save myself, I need to find out more about Akasha.

My eyes turn to one of the news stories open on my screen. The victim in question is Robert May, a junior CPA fresh out of college. Young kid, his whole life ahead of him. Just like the rest of the dead men. But something is different about Robert’s tragedy. Something about his story stands out. His girlfriend was with him when the fire broke out. Jennifer Heitz sustained third degree burns all over her body, but she's still alive.

There's a survivor.

\*\*\*

White sneakers pad down a sterile corridor. A nurse escorts me down the institutional hallway of the NORELL BURN TRAUMA CENTER. The heat in the building forces me to unzip my jacket.

“We keep the temperature inside the facility at eighty-five degrees,” the nurse explains. “Once the skin is compromised, burn victims are incapable of maintaining the necessary body temperature for internal organs to function properly.”

“What are the survival rates?”

“Thirty percent succumb to infection. If they can make it through the first sets of skin grafts, odds improve. Jennifer is one of our success stories. After six surgeries, she should be able to leave the center within a month or so.”

We round a corridor and reach Jennifer’s hospital room. The nurse nods, giving me the go-ahead to enter. I told them I was a college friend of Jennifer’s who heard about her tragedy. They agreed that seeing a friendly face would be good for her, but told me to be prepared. Jennifer’s terrible third-degree burns have drastically altered her appearance.

I wonder once again what I am doing here. How will Jennifer react to my visit? I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next few minutes a bunch of security officers descend on her room and drag me out of here. I hope Jennifer gives me enough time to plead my case before she sets the dogs on me.

I push the grim vision aside and concentrate on the figure sitting in the corner. Facing the window, Jennifer wears an athletic hoodie with the hood up. From this angle, she makes me think of an urban monk.

“Jennifer, you have a visitor. An old friend from college…”

“I have no friends. Not anymore,” the woman in the chair says, without turning around. Outside, snowflakes flutter steadily. The nurse shoots me a “good luck, kid” look and leaves us alone.

I’m unsure how to proceed. How do I bring up Akasha? I’m not a trained interrogator and me being here feels like a bad idea. Before I can say anything, Jennifer speaks. “It's funny. Everyone’s so excited that I'm about to leave this place, but I doubt the world is ready for me. Six surgeries later and my face is a cheap Halloween mask.”

“I'm sorry.”

Still without turning, she says, ”I don’t recognize your voice. Who are you?”

I come clean – the truth shall set me free.

“My name’s Mark. I need your help, Jennifer.”

She tilts her head toward me. Even though I steeled myself for this sight, I still have to stifle a gasp. The face inside the hoodie is an ugly tangle of knotted scars. I perused pictures of her from before the accident, and it’s heartbreaking to see her now. The fire leveled her nose and retracted her eyelids. Her former beauty slashed and burned away, she reminds me of a well-preserved mummy.

“How could I possibly help you?” she asks, her lidless eyes staring out at me from the cratered face.

“My brother died in a fire a few days ago. I don’t think it was an accident.”

Her stare never wavers, her full attention fixed on me. This is my chance and I grab it.

“I think someone murdered my brother. The same person who set the fire that killed your fiancé and nearly killed you.”

“Akasha...” Jennifer says, and I realize I’ve come to the right place.

“Who is she?” I ask.

The question hangs there. Jennifer is withdrawing from me. She shifts her attention back to the window. On some level I’m grateful not to be looking at her face any longer, but our connection is crumbling. I make a final attempt to reach her.

“Please, is there anything you can tell me about her?”

After a long moment, Jennifer responds. “Do you have a girlfriend?”

My heavy silence answers her question.

“Leave her before Akasha destroys you both.”

“Who is she?”

No answer is forthcoming. Jennifer doesn’t stir.

“Jennifer, please talk to me...”

She finally responds. Raspy words slip ominously from her destroyed lips with a chilling air of finality.

“Love is like a flame. It burns you when it’s hot.”
