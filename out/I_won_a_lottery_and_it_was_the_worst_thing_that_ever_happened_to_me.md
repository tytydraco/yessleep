 I've never won anything before. That is until I got a strange letter in the mail one day. It was a black and silver envelope with no return address. I opened it and this is what followed:

 "Congratulations! You have been chosen from the entire world population to participate in a life changing experience. Included is a one-way plane ticket to London. An email has also been sent, please confirm. We look forward to seeing you. - Global Ranking Systems Inc." 

Uhh, okay. This can't be real, I thought. Surely, it's some kinda scam. I opened up my email, and sure enough, I had a new message from the same company. I didn't reply. Instead, I decided to do some research on the company. A quick google search brought up nothing. Strange. I dug a little deeper and couldn't find a single shred of information about the company. Definitely a scam. 

One week passed, and I continued to get the same emails every day. Finally, after 10 days, I received a different email. It read as follows: "We still have not received a confirmation from you. As a further incentive, we are willing to pay you for your time. $10,000 when you arrive in London, and an additional $40,000 upon completion. We hope this will be sufficient for your time. Though, we think the experience will be far more valuable. Your flight is scheduled for this Friday. Please confirm."

 I really needed that money. I don't think I'd forgive myself if I turned it down. If nothing else, it was a free trip to London. I confirmed, and the next thing I knew I landed at Heathrow Airport.

 When I exited the plane, a man was waiting for me. He was holding a sign with my name on it. I approached him and he simply handed me an envelope which contained another plane ticket and $10,000 in cash. He walked away before I could ask him anything. The ticket's destination was Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Mongolia. It was departing in 25 minutes. I made my way to the terminal. When I reached the terminal, the plane was already boarding. I paced back and forth. Did I really wanna do this? What the hell could be in Mongolia? I should've just taken the ten grand and went home... I really wish I did. 

But something compelled me to get on that plane. I handed my ticket to the woman at the counter. She inspected it then gave me a strange look. "Just a moment." She said. She picked up a phone and whispered something I couldn't quite here. She nodded her head a few times then hung up the phone. "Right this way." I was told.  

As I walked down the boarding tunnel, I heard a man arguing with the woman I just spoke with. I was pleased to discover that I was sitting first class, but I was the only one. The flight was a bit strange. It was eerily quiet. But then again, everything that was happening was kind of strange. It was a 9 hour flight and I ended up sleeping for most of it.

 When I landed in Mongolia, another man was waiting for me. I confirmed my identity with my passport and was told to follow him. A black SUV was waiting for us. Before I got in the car, I felt a very subtle tremble in my feet. We drove for hours through the Mongolian wilderness. My driver didn't speak a single word to me. I ended up sleeping for much of the drive but the time I spent awake was actually quite pleasant. I had no idea how beautiful Mongolia was.

 About an hour outside our destination, we passed through a small village. It looked like a ghost town. The few locals who were outside quickly retreated indoors as they saw our SUV approaching. Suddenly there was a great rumble, which I could only assume was an earthquake. It only lasted a second or two. I didn't think too much of it at the time but looking back, that brief drive through that small town, the scared locals, the earthquake... it all made sense. 

In the distance, I saw it. It looked like a football stadium, except much larger. It loomed over the flat desert landscape like a black fortress of stone, concrete and steel. There was a long tunnel leading from it to my ultimate destination however: The Cube. The Cube looked more like a modern art installation than any functioning place of business. It stood about 5-6 stories tall and it appeared to be windowless, I couldn't tell if the building was clear or silver with the sun hitting it. Ten flags circled the front: USA, UK, Russia, China Switzerland, France, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa and one I had never seen before. It was all red with a thick black circle and a small diamond in the center. 

We pulled in and drove up to the entrance. A woman in about her 40's was waiting. I got out and the SUV took off. The woman extended her hand for a shake. "Hello there, I'm Dr. Anna." She had an accent I couldn't quite place, but she seemed friendly enough. "You're last to arrive. Let's go inside, the others are waiting." She said. I followed her inside, but I couldn't help but wonder, what others?

 The inside of The Cube was quite stunning. It was a literal oasis in the desert. There was large cliff waterfall and stream, and countless wild plants and flowers. There were even birds flying around and it seemed as though they could fly in and out through the glass walls surrounding the place. Oddly enough though, there were no people. 

I followed Dr. Anna around to the other side of the cliff. There was an elevator waiting. We got in and began our descent. We fell for at least two whole minutes, at great speed too as I needed to brace myself. How deep was this place, I wondered. 

The elevator finally came to a stop and when the doors opened, I was greeted to a sight straight out of a movie. Bright, white fluorescent lights illuminated a very modern looking office space. Cubicles, glass-walled offices and people walking around, some wearing formal dress and others in lab coats. It looked too clean, too prepared. It all just seemed a bit off. Every 50 feet or so there were immense charcoal colored stone columns, at least 20 feet in diameter, that seemed to be bearing the weight of the earth above.

 I continued to follow Dr. Anna down corridors and through offices. Everywhere we went, people would shoot glares my way, never making eye contact though, just like the people in the village. Then it happened, another "earthquake." I asked Dr. Anna what it was, but she didn't even acknowledge me. 

We finally came to a large blast door. Dr. Anna scanned her ID card, entered a code and finally used a hand scanner. The door opened slowly and we entered. This area looked a bit different. It was a large square room, or rather a small warehouse, probably ten thousand square feet with a large circular glass room in the middle. The glass room was divided into four separate rooms, each containing machines and equipment and some stuff I'd never seen before. There was a second floor above the circled the perimeter. There were less people here, and all of them wore lab coats. There was some sort of observation deck on the second floor that looked like a skybox you'd see at a sporting arena. The windows were blacked out. 

Three other individuals were waiting. These people clearly didn't work here. I quickly learned they were other "winners." I hadn't even considered there would be others. I thought I was the only one. There was The Frenchman, the woman from Japan, and the man from South Africa.

 Dr. Anna spoke: "Thank you all for your patience, and on behalf of everyone here and abroad, I would like to congratulate each one of you on being selected for this once in a lifetime opportunity. We are The Horizon Group, the world's leader in advanced research and development. Each of you have been chosen to participate and bare witness to the cutting edge work being performed here. What you are about to witness is unlike anything you've seen before. Simply put, we make the impossible a reality." 

Each of the three members were taken away into back rooms separately after having a brief word with Dr. Anna. She then told me to follow a gentleman to the blacked out observation area on the second floor. There was a man dressed in what looked like a very expensive suit waiting in the room. There were some documents on a table, a NDA or non-disclosure agreement. I was told to sign. I asked what I was even supposed to be doing. The man never looked at me, he only responded, "You watch." I signed it. 

Now, I'm fully aware the events which I'm about to recount from this point forward are going to be difficult, if not impossible, to accept as truth. I wouldn't believe a word of it either. And to be entirely honest, most of what I saw I can hardly even describe. I was given no explanation for anything I witnessed, and for what I saw last... Well, I don't think an explanation exists. But bare with me please, I need to share this with someone... anyone. My sanity is slipping rapidly.

 EXPERIMENT #1 - THE FRENCHMAN 

His clothing was changed. He went from wearing a nice looking business suit to a grey, two-piece jumpsuit. He was being assisted by a man and a woman. He looked a bit "out of it" and couldn't walk straight. Did they drug him? They brought him under a large, black-metallic archway. It seemed to be made of a single solid piece and was integrated directly into the floor. It started out thin, about 8 or so inches thick and gradually grew to about 3 feet thick at the top and stood about 9 or 10 feet tall. Above it were a series of white and silver wires and tubes. They all ran up the ceiling then down one of the corners of the room into the ground. 

The man and woman left the room, then a voice came over the speaker and told the man to remain very still for a moment. The voice then said something in French which I didn't understand. After a few moments, the voice told the Frenchman to walk forward. He took two steps before breaking the threshold of the archway. The entire opening of the arch filled with a very strange looking substance. It looked like a mix between a gas and a liquid and it was the same color as the archway itself. He disappeared for a single instant before reappearing directly behind the archway. He put his hand on his chest, but his entire abdomen looked caved in. I have no clue what exactly happened or where the man "went".

 As I was trying to piece it together, the Frenchman coughed up a mouthful of black blood and fainted into the greyish substance of the archway. His body disappeared before it hit the floor. This time he didn't return.

 I turned to the man in the room with me but he was gone. I went to the door but found it locked. I shouted at the CCTV camera in the room, demanding an answer to what just happened. A voice came over the speaker again, this time it sounded like Dr. Anna. "Experiment 1: Failure. Proceed with experiment 2." 

EXPERIMENT #2 - THE JAPANESE WOMAN 

Another man and woman brought her out into one of the rooms. There was a bed and a bunch of medical equipment and life support machines and what I can only assume was a medical doctor. The doctor was preparing a series of syringes. The man and woman helped the Japanese girl onto the bed and proceeded to strap her down much like you'd see for violent patients or criminals. She didn't seem to mind. In fact, she looked to be in the same state of mind as the Frenchman was. 

The man and woman stood near the door with their backs to her. Another doctor entered the room and spoke briefly with the other doctor before leaving. The doctor hooked the Japanese woman up to some of the machines to read her vitals including her pulse and blood pressure. He then took one of the syringes and injected it into the woman's arm. He took a step back and crossed his arms. 

 After a few moments the machines started to beep and I could see that her pulse and blood pressure were dropping quickly. About 20 seconds later, she flatlined. The doctor waited another minute or so before unhooking the equipment. He then got the other syringe. He injected her straight in the side of the neck, and took three steps back. He looked nervous this time. 

Her eyes opened briefly then closed. A few seconds later, they opened again. She turned to look at the man and woman that brought her in. They still had their backs to her. She slowly turned her head to look at the doctor, but he too turned his back to her before she could make eye contact. She began to move her head from side to side in a very slow and deliberate motion, closing her eyes tight and reopening them a bit wider each time. 

I moved right up against the glass to try for a closer look. Her head cocked back to an impossible position, and she locked eyes with me and let out a terrifying screech. Could she see me through the glass? The windows were blacked out. She was changing rapidly. She no longer looked human. The veins in her neck were bulging and black, her eyes were blood red and dripping with a grey liquid. And her neck... I'll never forget it. Her neck extended to allow her forehead to touch her shoulder blades.

 After a minute or so, her entire body began to change shape. It looked like her bones were growing larger with her skin tightening around them until eventually her bones ripped through revealing a greyish black skeleton. She stopped moving and screaming. She never broke eye contact with me.

 I stood there alone in that room, horrified and confused. What the hell was this place? What had I gotten myself into? And was it just a matter of time before I met a similar fate? I just wanted to go home. 

The familiar sound of Dr. Anna's voice came back over the loudspeaker: "Experiment 2: Success. Proceed with experiment 3." 

EXPERIMENT #3 - THE SOUTH AFRICAN MAN 

The man from South Africa entered the final room. He was wearing the same jumpsuit, but he also had on an odd looking skull cap that had some wires running from the top of his head into his back. Nobody was in the room he entered, and he wasn't being escorted by anyone.

 There was only a large cylindrical capsule with a thick blast door that was already open. There was a large digital clock on the front of the door. The clock ran to 4 decimal places past "seconds". And much like the strange archway from the other room, there were a series of tubes and wires running from the capsule into the ground. The man walked in to the capsule and closed his eyes.

 Just then, there was another "earthquake." This time it was far more intense and lasted for the longest minute of my life. I could hear some sirens going off but the door to the room was still locked. When the ground shaking ceased, I looked out into the room but the man was gone. I have no idea what happened to him. 

Once again, Dr. Anna's voice rang loud over the speaker. "Experiment #3: Failure. Proceed with "Source" observation." 

The door to the room opened and two people came in to get me. I tried to ask what was happening, but they didn't seem to speak English. They showed me to the elevator. Dr. Anna was waiting for me. We began the ascent back to the surface. We stood for a moment in silence before Dr. Anna spoke up. "I know you have many questions for me, but I assure you they will all be answered in due time. Your task is nearly complete." 

We reached the atrium area and made our way to a small shuttle. The shuttle took us through that long tunnel I saw on my way in. We were going to that monstrous looking black dome. The size of the dome was immense. I would guess at least a mile or more across with the walls of the structure rising hundreds of feet tall. But inside there was only a steel ground cover that filled the entire area inside the dome. 

There was another elevator. I was told to enter, descend to bottom and observe. "Deep below, you will discover the source which makes everything we do here possible, everything you've witnessed here today. There is still much to be learned from this place if we ever hope to truly control this extraordinary source of energy." With that, Dr. Anna got back on the shuttle and left me. 

I'm not entirely sure why I decided to get in that elevator and descend down into the unknown. I guess I had already come so far that I figured, why not. Not to mention at this point I didn't think I'd be seeing my home again. 

 To be honest, I wish I had never made it out of that place. Having to live now with what I know is nothing short of torture. 

THE SOURCE 

The elevator was much less sophisticated than the one in the Cube facility. It felt more like a mining lift. It took quite a long time to reach the bottom. When I walked out I was first met with a strong gust of hot air. I couldn't see a thing. I slowly took a few steps and a motion activated light turned on behind me. I seemed to be in some sort of cave. I had always assumed it would be cold in a cave, but the heat was stifling. As my eyes adjusted, I could see some beams of white light shining through the "ceiling" way off in the distance. I turned back around and noticed a large circuit breaker box next to the light hanging over the elevator. I threw a large switch and about a dozen large flood lights illuminated the area.

 It was then that I began to realize the colossal scale of this place. It wasn't just a mere cave, but a cavern of truly epic proportions. It must've stretched on for miles as there was no end in sight. Some of the walls of the place were lined with that strange greyish-black metallic stone. 

But what was most troubling was the depth. About 20 feet from the elevator, the ground dropped off completely. I picked up a large stone and hurled it into the endless darkness. I waited to hear it hit the bottom, but it never did. 

I stood in awe of this place, but I couldn't help but wonder what I was supposed to do here. Just then, the elevator closed and began to make its way back to the surface. I began to panic. There was no button to bring the elevator back. I checked the circuit box but there was nothing. I shouted for help but my voice just echoed into the vast nothingness. What was I going to do now?

 I was pacing back and forth when I was struck with a reflective glare noticed some carvings along the wall behind the elevator. It looked like some sort of hieroglyphics, the glare coming from a polished gemstone integrated into the writings. I had no idea what any of it meant. They stretched across the whole wall though until they came to a small door built directly into the stone. The door was made of wood and that strange greyish substance.

 Just as I pulled the door open, I heard it. And the very foundation of the earth trembled.  But it wasn't an earthquake, it was a scream, or a cry, or a howl. I have no idea how to describe it because it sounded nothing like anything I'd ever heard. But it came from below. Deep down in that infinite abyss. Loud enough and with so much monumental power to shake the very world. It brought me to my knees and I hunched over, covering my ears as best I could.  I wretched in pain for what felt like an eternity.

It finally stopped, but I felt paralyzed. I have never felt a stronger, more overwhelming sense of dread and pure hopeless terror in my life. Something was down there, something beyond comprehension, beyond measure. Was that the true "source." Is that what Dr. Anna and these people hope to control? I finally got back to my feet but I was still too afraid to move. My sense of hearing seemed stolen from me and the heat... god the heat was too much to bare.

 I clutched the small door and made my way out as quickly as possible. I had no idea where I was going or where this would lead but it seemed to take me away from that horrible cavern and that's all that mattered to me. It felt like hours before I reached the surface. When I finally emerged, it was dark out. I noticed a few small orbs of light in the distance. It was that small town I passed on my way in. It took me about a week before I finally made it back home. 

I have no idea what I'm supposed to do now. That non-disclosure agreement means nothing to me now. Even so, who do I go to with this information? It's too unbelievable. And there's no trace of the so called "Horizon Group." The families of the other "winners" will never have peace unless I say something.

 My mind is fractured. I can't get the sound of that otherworldly, ground shaking scream out of my head. My hearing has not recovered, I hear it during every waking moment. It haunts my dreams. And I just can't help but wonder what such a thing capable of that sound would look like. Do they really think that dome can contain it? Something like that can't be contained... or controlled, or understood. What happens when they dig too deep, or take too much? I don't wanna be around to find out...
