We didn’t think the rumors were actually true. Even if they weren’t, Old Ms. Nettlebottom sure as hell acted like a witch. 

You see Teddy, Hank, and I are your friendly neighborhood hooligans. Ms. Nettlebottom of course, is our natural born nemesis, forever determined to ruin our fun. 

Luckily, or should I say unluckily, for us Teddy lives right across the street from her. This is no bueno for us since Teddy’s place is our main hangout spot because there’s a tv and couch in his garage and his parent are always working. So, for the past few years as me and the guys have grown into adolescents we’ve been having a sort of feud with the bitch, I mean witch. 

It all started back when she sent her dog, Grim, to chew the cords to Teddy’s PlayStation and tv setup in his garage- he kept the garage door slightly open to ventilate the room when he was out there gaming. He came back from getting a snack to busted tv and broken console. 

Of course there wasn’t much evidence that Ms. Nettlebottom was the mastermind behind the whole thing so the cops couldn’t do anything, but deep down we all knew it was her doing. She’d been complaining about the COD gunshot noises ringing out through the surround sound for weeks.

Sure Teddy got a new PlayStation and an even better tv for us to play on, but she had waged war, and we didn’t come to play. In retaliation we snuck up into her front yard in the middle of the night and stomped on her well planted petunia garden. Then to add insult to injury we sprinkled a whole bunch of powdered herbicide over the already crushed flowers. 

From then on every few months one party would do something to the other and in retaliation someone would be humiliated, epically pranked, or shit would get destroyed. Tonight though… tonight would be the final epic battle, and spoiler alert, we didn’t win.

It was Hank who suggested it. We were smoking pot and watching a movie in Teddy’s garage- as we do every Tuesday night. On the queue was Billy Madison- a classic. We’d only just started watching it and the scene where Adam Sandler and his friends put a flaming bag of dog shit on Old Man Clemens’s porch. It was like a lightbulb went off above Hank’s head. With how high he was I wouldn’t be surprised if he actually saw one.

“Hey, guys you know what we haven’t done in a while?” Hank started after he finished chuckling from when Adam Sandler said,”He called the shit, poop!”

“What?” Teddy answered.

“Messed with the hag in a while.”

“Yeah,” I said taking a hit from a blunt we were passing around,” we haven’t. You’re point?”

“Gavin, my point is I’m bored, we haven’t fucked with Ms. Nettlebottom, and I want to light some dog shit on fire.”

“That would be pretty hilarious.” Teddy said, sitting up from the couch and tousling with his medium length blonde hair. 

“Where would we even get the shit from?” I asked, intrigued with the idea.

“Here’s what we’ll do,” Hank explained, as if we were in a bank heist movie and he was telling us how we’d pull it off. “First, we go to Taco Bell because I have a serious case of the munchies.”

Teddy and I nodded our heads in agreement.

“Then, we’ll go into the Higgins’s yard and take a pile of Buster’s crap- since they never pick up after that dog anyway and put it in the Taco Bell bag. We set it on fire on the witches porch and have a good laugh.” 

“Sounds like a good plan.” Teddy said as he put a jacket on over his wife-beater tank-top while putting a jacket on. It really made him look like a stoner kid from a 90s movie. He had ripped jeans on, a spiked belt, and a red beanie on over his hair. Hank and I were wearing jeans and hoodies. 

“What could possibly go wrong?” I added. Famous last words.

We giggled to ourselves after pausing the movie and waiting for Teddy’s garage door to open. We pulled out our skateboards and skated in the direction of Taco Bell.

Riding off from the fast food chain’s parking lot with three baked bean burritos,three Baja blasts, and an empty brown Taco Bell paper bag in hand, we headed right for our targets house, but first we had to make a pit stop.

The Higgins were notorious for letting their English bulldog, Buster, shit wherever he pleased and not pick it up. They occasionally came out to pick up the old piles of poop littering their lawn, but other than that their yard was filled of turdy land mines. Teddy drew the short straw and had to pick up the shit, causing Buster to bark at him from inside the house. We quickly ran away before the Higgins could sense something was wrong.

We quietly giggled snickered to ourselves as we snuck up to Nettlebottom’s porch and debated for a minute who would get to ring the doorbell and light the bag on fire, but ultimately decided that since Hank came up with the idea, he should get to do the honors.

Teddy and I waited across the street in his garage to watch the chaos, thumbs ready to press the close button.

Hank strolled up the stairs to her porch while looking both ways, acting as if nothing was wrong. Then he rang the doorbell three times and hurriedly scurried down the steps. He then quickly grabbed a red lighter out of his pocket, lit the bag, then threw the flaming bag on her porch, where it landed on her welcome mat. He started cackling halfway across the street as Teddy and I motioned for him run.

As the garage door began to close we saw Ms. Nettlebottom open her front door in a long white cardigan and fuzzy blue slippers. She quickly found the flaming bag on her porch and yelled out a shout before furiously stomping on it. Buster had started barking from inside the Higgins home after hearing the commotion. This caused a few more dogs in the neighborhood to go off. The sweet symphony of dog barks just added to the whole experience. The guys and I burst out into tears and laughter as she realized she had just danced on dog poop. She brought a brown slipper up to her face and sniffed it. Boy howdy the look on her face!

“Hey, maybe it’s Grim’s!”  Hank suddenly shouted under the garage door as it was about to close. For context Grim, aka Nettlebottom’s hell spawn of a dog, aka the mutt that chewed through Teddy’s PlayStation cables, had escaped a week ago. I guess Nettlebottom was such a mean old person her dog didn’t even want to live with her either.

We all started laughing even more as Old Ms. Nettlebottom turned her gaze to us and scowled. It seemed our tantalizing laughs did their job as she figured out it was us who threw the poop on her porch. But yet again, she had no proof otherwise and couldn’t do squat!

“We’ll see how you like it!” Was the only thing she yelled as she raised her fist in the air and shook it at us. We kept right on laughing until she marched her sorry behind inside. 

Our giggles died down as the adrenaline rush faded. We finished the last of our Baja Blasts and continued on with the Billy Madison movie. 

About twenty minutes later a sudden, sharp, pressure built up in my lower abdomen. I chalked it up to the Taco Bell I’d eaten earlier. That stuff really does go right through you.

“Are any of you guys hot?” Hank asked as he pulled his hoodie up and down to try and cool his chest.

“No, but I gotta take a shit.” I said nonchalantly as I stood up to go inside to use the little boys room. 

“I’m good looking, but warm? No.” Teddy teased cockily. 

I rolled my eyes as I let myself into Teddy’s house. After entering the downstairs guest bathroom I unbuttoned my jeans, dropped my boxers, and waited for my colon to let loose. Some loud grumbles and gurgles escaped from my tummy but my bowel didn’t release any waste. Some sharp pains shocked my intestines and butthole. After a few hard pushes, a nice, slightly hard, turd finally slipped out and fell into the toilet bowl. Feeling better, I wiped both my ass and the sweet from my forehead, washed my hands, and went back to the garage.

I found Hank had taken his hoodie off and was now wearing jeans and a long sleeve tee. Teddy was watching the movie and scratching at his forearm.

I sat next to Teddy and continued to watch the movie. Billy had just started his first day of Kindergarten. 

“You guys seriously aren’t hot?” Hank asked again. I took a good look at him and his cheeks were a little red and a few beads of sweat littered his forehead as he continued to fan himself but with his shirt this time. 

“Nope. Maybe you’re running a fever?” I said.

“Nah,” Teddy answered,” but now you’ve got me feeling itchy.” Teddy scratched at his chest and his forearms again. 

Hank breathed in heavily and panted,“I feel like I’m in Hell.”

“Don’t we all, brother.” I said, feeling a bit of pressure build up in my stomach again. Damn Taco Bell giving me diarrhea. I brushed it off and walked up to Hank, putting my hand to his sweaty forehead.

“Damn Hank, you’re burning up.”

“I feel like it.” He chuckled nervously.

“Quit scratching or you’ll give yourself a rash.” I said to Teddy as I went to grab a water bottle for Hank in the white fridge in his garage. 

He just sucked his tongue at me and continued to scratch. I rolled my eyes at him,” you’re funeral.” 

Hank took his shirt off revealing his sweat drenched semi-toned body and gulped the water down in seconds. 

My stomach protested some more, but again I ignored it. “You don’t look so good, Hank. Maybe it was the Taco Bell?”

Suddenly Teddy started violently sniffing the air. “Do- do you guys smell that?” 

“Smell what?” I asked confused, not smelling anything.

“It smells like… burning meat.”

Suddenly Hank started holding his side and his face went beat red. He started grunting and panting as he clutched himself tightly. I took a step back and Teddy rose from the couch. 

“It burns!!” Hank screamed. “Help me, it burns!”

“What does?!?” I asked frantically, racing for the fridge to fetch another water bottle. Maybe his appendix was bursting I remember thinking to myself. 

“E-everything!” He screamed, the loudest, most guttural and gut wrenching scream I’d ever heard. I thought I’d lost my mind for a second, but it looked like smoke or steam was coming out of Hank’s mouth.

Teddy and I learned quickly we weren’t imagining anything when fire suddenly erupted out of Hank’s mouth, nose, ears, and eyes. The fire quickly spread across his skin as he screamed in agony as his flesh began to melt off. The fire burned so quick and intensely Teddy and I couldn’t do anything but watch as our friend spontaneously combusted. 

Out of shock or something, I dumped the water from the bottle I had grabbed over Hank’s charred skeletal remains like it would do something. After that I just stood there, barely comprehending that I was looking at the corpse of one of my best friends and the events that led to it. 

The stunned silence that filled the room didn’t last long as Teddy suddenly yelped and grabbed his lower back.

“Teddy?” I questioned out of concern. He looked at me wide eyed. He grunted out of pain again and rubbed his backside. “Teddy what’s wrong?” 

All he did was open his eyes even wider, so wide I thought they were about to burst out of their sockets. “Gavin… Gavin I think I’m hallucinating.” He said breathlessly.

“What do you mean Teddy, what’s happening?!”

He then turned around where I could see something poking out a little from underneath his jacket. Then something long, golden, and furry fell out. I couldn’t believe my eyes. 

Teddy turned back around, threw off his jacket, and started scratching furiously at his red irritated skin. “Is that what I think it is?” 

“A tail. I think that’s a fucking tail.” I said in disbelief. 

Teddy then sucked in a sharp breath. I looked to his forearm and gasped when I saw a trickle of blood sliding down his skin. He brought his bloody hand up to his eyes and took a step back. His nails had elongated into sharp claws.

“W-what the hell is happening to me?!” He shouted and then looked up and down his arms. Small blonde hairs had started to sprout from under his skin. I then winced as I started hearing bones breaking. Teddy kept groaning in pain as fur started sprouting everywhere. I backed away from him and that his shoes had ripped open and instead of finding a human foot I saw a dog paw.

“Dude. I think you’re turning into a dog.” I said, again, not believing the words coming out of my mouth. Teddy didn’t say anything as his painful transformation continued.

My gut grumbled once more and I clenched my cheeks and clutched my dear stomach. I found it was slightly bloated and another painful shock wreaked havoc on my intestines. I really had to shit, but by god I’d turtle head that shit before going to the bathroom to poop. My one friend was dead and my other was in the middle of turning into a canine! I couldn’t leave to go shit now, what kind of friend would I be. 

Teddys body started jolting as his skeleton began to rearrange itself. I crossed my legs and clenched. Even if I wanted to, if I moved wrong in anyway, my butthole was about to explode. My stomach growled ferociously and my asshole quivered, trying to hold back the floodgates. 

Teddy let out a sudden loud and painful grown which scared me a little bit. The shock and jump was it for me. My heart sunk as the floodgates opened and a flurry of turd filled my boxer briefs. I felt liquid run down my leg and I instinctively brought my hands to my bum where warm and wet shit sat.

Suddenly, mid transformation, Teddy brought his now muzzle shaped snout my way and took in a big fat whiff.

In a strained voice he goes,” Dude… did you just soil yourself?”

“You’re turning into a mother fucking dog and you care about me shitting myself?” I questioned back, a little embarrassed, and uncomfortable. I could feel some liquid permeating between my underwear and jeans seeping into the skin of my hands.

Another pained groan caused Teddy to fall on all fours to the ground. I couldn’t take it anymore after feeling another rumble in my stomach and I waddled to the bathroom as fast as a person with poop in their pants could. 

A torrent of shit exited my butthole and into the toilet before my skin could even touch the toilet seat. I kicked the shit filled underwear and jeans away from me as I crossed my legs and held my aching tummy. I looked down to see it had bloated up a little bit more. A squirt of hot liquid diarrhea left my bumhole and fell into the toilet. I found it in my shaking self wipe. Another grumble of the stomach a very hard and solid log came out.

I gave up wiping after the fifth time I pooped. My rectum was sore and bloody from all the poop coming out of my anus. The toilet clogged after the third flush and I was too scared to try and run to another toilet. Turd after tiring turd came after another. One time it would be soft and squishy, the next huge, hard, and Boulder like. Then after that it would be spicy diarrhea. 

It felt like hours had gone by when I felt the mountain of poop reach my hole. The liquid shit over spilling out of the bowl and down the sides of the porcelain throne is what caused me to try and stand up to move. I shakily fell to the bathtub and looked in horror at all the poop my bum had expelled. I looked down at my bloated tummy and couldn’t believe there was still more in there. Another rumble caused me to instinctively push my brown buns of the edge of the bathtub. A second later more poop left my behind. I clutched my stomach as it was cramping horribly. 

Embarrassment, shame, and self pity washed over me as the now never ending river of shit left my colon. Then, my ears tuned into an interesting sound. It sounded like scratches and whining were coming from behind the door. Then the handle to the door turned and the bathroom door was open. A dog, more specifically a golden retriever, opened the door came in and sat down, staring at me.

“T-Teddy?” I asked weakly, taking notice of the torn wife-beater that was stuck on the dogs chest. The animal looked down and whimpered. 

“Oh my god, Teddy.” I cried as more poop slid out of my butt and into his bathtub. 

Teddy then began to smell the air and it looked like his eyes glazed over. He then got up and started shoving his sniffer near my poo filled pants from earlier. I gulped as he brought his nose closer and closer.

It took the little I had left in me not to gag when Teddy began to slowly chip away at the mountain of shit in my trousers.

“Oh Teddy, no!” I cried as I kicked my leg in his direction. He stopped, stared at me, then went back to eating my poop. “Bad, Teddy, bad!”

Teddys ears then perked up and he stopped eating. He then licked his snout and casually trotted out of the bathroom. Seconds later an old woman wearing a white cardigan and one brown and one blue fuzzy slipper came in. It was Ms. Nettlebottom.

“Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.” She went as she surveyed the damage my rectum had caused to the bathroom. She then brought her thumb and forefinger to her nose. “You really are a stinky little shit head.”

“Please…” I begged with what little strengths I had remaining. I’d figured out long ago that evil Old Ms. Nettlebottom was behind this. “Make it stop.”

My stomach grumbled and gurgled some more and I clutched my stomach as a particularly painful cramp rang through my intestines.

“Oh you mean stop this?” She said in a condescending tone. She then snapped her fingers. 

The flow of brown lava spilling out of my guts suddenly ceased. The toilet the. Magically flushed the mountain of poop and the porcelain returned to a pristine white. The bath tub that was once almost filled to the brim with poop was suddenly clean and empty. My legs found themselves clean of dried poop stains as if they’d never been there. My underwear and jeans were back on my bottom half clean and brown stain free.

“T-thank you!” I said joyfully as I stood up feeling clean and so much better. I could feel I’d lost a couple dozen pounds and my face was sunken in from behind dehydrated, but I felt oh so better.

“Ah, ah, ah.” She taunted before snapping her fingers once again. My stomach dropped and my booty cheeks clenched as the thought of soiling myself again flooded my mind. My tummy gurgled alright but I didn’t poop myself.

I looked down as I once more felt pressure build up in my lower abdomen. My stomach once again bloated up, but this time it kept getting bigger and better.

“W-what?” I questioned as my stomach distended.

“You asked me to make it stop. So I made yourself stop pooping yourself.”

My stomach quickly grew in size as it gurgled with great intensity. My jeans grew tight around my waist as my stomach expanded.

The sudden weight in my tummy caused me to lean back and fall back into the edge of the bath tub.

I frantically looked from my growing belly to the witch that stood before me. It looked like I had a baby bump.

“I stoped you from pooping, which is what you asked for. But what I didn’t do was stop the poop from building up. So that little bump of yours is all poop.”

I squirmed uncomfortably as my jeans dug into my skin deeply. The skin pressing against the fabric caused the zipper to unzip down. The button was holding on, but it was a matter of time before it gave in.

“Stop it. Stop all the poop! Stop it all! Please!” I begged.

“Fine, I’ll stop, but only if you apologize.” She said sternly, crossing her arms into her chest.

“Okay, alright! I’m sorry.” I blurted out. The button then gave way and my jeans fell a little as my poop filled gut kept growing.

“Like you mean it! You apologize to what you implied about my little Grim, hooligan!”

Are you freaking serious right now?!? This old hag could handle her precious award winning garden behind trampled and destroyed, eggs and toilet paper constantly being thrown at her house, but she couldn’t handle a joke about her missing dog? 

My stomach gurgled some more and it now looked like I was three months away pregnant.

“Oh, ok! I’m really sorry Ms. Nettlebottom, really! Hank, Teddy, and I, we all are very sorry about burning the dog poop on your porch. We’re very sorry about Grim getting out too! Please, just please stop this madness!” 

She snapped her fingers and relief filled me as my abdomen stopped expanding. I raised an eyebrow when my stomach didn’t return back to its flat state.

“Apology accepted my dear. I have stopped your little torment. Unfortunately for you I can’t undo what I did to your friends out there. The boy who burned is dead and I can’t bring him back. The mutt I’ll be taking as a replacement for Grim. I was growing tired of that old familiar anyway. As for you, I’ve stopped the build up, but it all has to be pooped out. Oh and I made sure it’s the constipation type of poops too, so you’ll be waddling around with that belly for a little while.”

I looked down at my swollen stomach and poked it as I dreaded what her words meant. 

“Make sure you don’t do anything like this again or I’ll personally see to it that you end up in a shitty grave. Literally.”

I gulped and nodded my head furiously.

She then brought her hands to her hips and looked me up and down as I stared at my pregnant looking belly.

“Hey kid, at least you didn’t die.” She said before leaving the bathroom. She whistled and I heard Teddy pitter-patter after her.

“At least I didn’t eat shit.” I said to myself as I forced myself to stand. I waddled my way over to the bathroom mirror. My face was gaunt and my cheeks and eyes sunken in. I hated the way my stomach protruded out in front of me. A deep rumble from inside my stomach caused me to sit on the toilet. At the very least my stomach would shrink down in size after I was done my business. 

So now I’m here, in Teddy’s guests bathroom trying to take a shit before his parents get home. If they found me looking pregnant on the toilet after finding Hank’s and Teddy’s clothes remains they’d have some serious questions. Questions I very much don’t want to answer.

Moral of the story: don’t throw flaming bags of dog poop on a witch’s porch. Or you’ll end up burnt to a crisp, a dog, or pregnant with a turd baby.
