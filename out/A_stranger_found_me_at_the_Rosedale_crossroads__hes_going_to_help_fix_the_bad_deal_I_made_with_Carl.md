After the first two signs, I knew that nothing good could come from opening this envelope; but what could happen if I didn’t was much worse.


Let’s pick straight back up where I left off, the second envelope. 
 

Similarly to the Polaroid, I could tell from how the weight settled that the envelope was much bigger than its contents; my heartbeat pulsed quickly in my thumbs and my tongue felt suddenly huge.


*My body had realised before my brain.*


The mental symptoms of panic that were rapidly manifesting and multiplying became physical when I noticed my hand had begun shaking pretty violently.


I took a breath and used my finger to pry the envelope open and watched as a single piece of paper drifted down onto the table — for a moment, I didn’t understand what I was looking at. 


It was a sketch. Sloppy. Anatomically incorrect. 


*A charcoal abomination.*


I’d seen it before, but *when?* Had I drawn this? 


The colour drained from the world before me and what was left was a sepia-toned hellscape. 


It was the contract.


Still shaking, I flipped the page over and all I could see now was red. I’d written the contract in black pen all of those years ago, but there was nothing familiar about the red scrawl that had been added since the last I’d seen it. 


I couldn’t look away from Carl’s downhill script, I recognised it immediately. ‘October 18th, 2024’. I blinked. It didn’t change.


I blinked again, forcing my eyes to zoom out in order to comprehend what I was seeing, ‘Date of DEATH: October 18th, 2024.’ That was tomorrow.


I needed to call Carl, whatever spurred this derranged joke was obviously not funny, but was it a cry for help? *Did he need me?*

Although Carl and I have walked different paths for the last decade and a half, I made sure to text him each year on his birthday and again at Christmas — this way I knew that he’d at minimum know that I was thinking about him.


It’s harder to convince yourself that you’re alone in the world if someone reminds you that you’re not, you know?


He hasn’t responded since 2018, but they still go through. I found his contact in my phone, the last birthday message just four months ago and he’d left me on read.
I called him. It didn’t ring, instead, a woman much too soft spoken to be in Carl’s presence let me know *“the number you are trying to reach is no longer in service.”*


I guess it was lucky that it didn’t warrant a response from me, my mouth was bone dry and I don’t think words would have come out even if they had to. I called again, it happened again just the same. 


I wasn’t sure what to do, but a drive always clears my mind. I reasoned that Carl obviously knew where I was living, and he’d visited me at least once this week; I needed to leave, *now*.


I grabbed my keys, my phone, the contract and my weapon. I was *gone.*


I called my ex-girlfriend as soon as I got in my truck, part of me needed to make sure she was okay. She knew Carl back in the day and he always blamed her for me straightening out and changing circles. 


“Natalie, are you okay? You and Sarah?” I barked, 


Her snarky tone put me at ease right away, anything more heartfelt would have raised the alarm, “No, Jimmy. *The zombies have risen, the floods have started and the sky is on fire.”*


I smiled as she kept going, “We are fine, Jimmy. Better than ever. What are you talking about? Are you off the wagon?” 


I paused until she’d stopped talking, experience taught me this to be the best way to communicate with Natalie. 


“Fifteen years I’ve been sober, Natalie. No, I’m not off the wagon,” I had to rush my words to make sure she couldn’t find a way in, “I’ve got to go out of town for a few days, a week tops. For work, could you tell Sarah?”


A theatrical sigh sputtered out of my car’s hand free speaker, “Good to hear. I’ll let her know, I’ll have her text you. Is that all? You sound odd.” *Classic Natalie.*


“Well, Nat. *You look odd.* Thanks. I’m okay, you’ve not heard from Carl have you?” I tried to maintain my speech so she didn’t freak out upon the mention of Carl— as mentioned, she was never his biggest fan. 


“Methy Carl? No, Jimmy. Why? You are off the wagon, aren’t you?” I tried to consider the sincerity in her tone, but this accusation just annoyed me, “No, Natalie. I wish you’d stop that. I tried to call him recently to check in and see how he was doing, but the call didn’t go through. I was just wondering.”


She seemed to hear the truth in what I was saying, “Okay, Jimmy, my bad. I haven’t heard from him in years.” She gave a smaller, softer sigh that I knew to be a placeholder for an apology, “I’ve got to go, anyway. Now, you drive safe, Jimmy, I can hear you’re in the truck.” 


“Thanks Natalie, yeah, I’ve just taken Route 8 near Cleveland. Signal’ll be patchy, soon anyway. Remember to tell Sarah, and tell her I love her.” She’d hung up by the time I’d finished speaking— but that was part of her charm. 


I always did my best thinking in the car. Mississippi highways provide a perfect, blank canvas, too. Every few minutes, I’d pass a streetlight or a field lit up by it’s farmer, but I hadn’t seen another set of headlights in just over an hour by the time I’d decided to take a breather. 


One of the silly little rules that I set myself during my earliest sober days was that I was never to smoke a cigarette indoors again, that includes truck doors. 


Nicotine was the one substance I allowed myself to consume these days, but it was important to me that I always felt in control of my use enough to abide by this simple rule, so it stuck. It helped me keep myself accountable. 


So I waited until a place that felt natural, I still didn’t really have a destination in mind so around the stretch where Highways 1 and 8 split near Rosedale, when I found someplace that looked comfortable enough for a break, I pulled up to smoke my cigarette.


The contract burned a bigger hole in my pocket than any cigarette or lighter could, so when I’d lit up, I took the contract from my back pocket and thought I’d give it a look over.


As I read each section, I saw images flash in front of my eyes like in a movie. 


‘A sign that it’s coming’ — *the stash box*,

‘Make me smile — *the defaced Polaroid,*

‘the contract; completed’ — *I was looking at it.*


The world started to bruise red as I stared at the date marked for my death, *tomorrow.*


*Tomorrow.*


I was so focused on what was in my hand that I felt the inferno touch my lips when I’d smoked through my filter, my lungs immediately rejected the toxins and my head swelled for a moment as again, my body had realised before my brain. I needed to start trusting my body. 


Lighting up another cigarette, I felt a tap on my shoulder. The dread hit my body and worked through it like a shotgun shell. There couldn’t be a hand on my shoulder. I was alone, there was nobody there, I hadn’t seen another soul in over an hour. 


Everything inside me told me to ignore what was happening, it couldn’t be real anyway, but it was pointless trying to listen to that voice inside, right now it was screaming unintelligible babble. I turned my head toward where the tap should’ve come from, and clear as day, there he was. 


Carl?  


No. Not Carl. 

I hadn’t ever seen this man before, but I felt like I *knew* him — and from the way he looked at me, *it sure felt like he knew me.*


He smiled at me the sort of cold smile you might see from any old helpful stranger, but the cold hit me like a shot of vodka and I felt this warm calm radiating in my stomach, I couldn’t help the words from escaping my mouth, “I’m sorry sir, I’m not usually so easily startled. It’s nothing personal, I swear.” 


I wasn’t sure why I was apologising to this man, as my eyes dropped with my confidence; I noticed the beautiful, snakeskin boots he was wearing and my eyes tracked upward over each piece of his immaculate suit.


*This was the best dressed man I’d ever seen.*


I thought maybe he’d heard my coughing— thought I was choking, came to lend a hand. 


“No trouble at all son. We’ve been fixing to cross paths a while now, you and I.” 

I should’ve been repulsed, I should have known right then. I cast my gaze up to meet the man’s own. I’m six foot two and I had to look up some.


I couldn’t find any words, he could see that. 


He paused for a moment to allow me to speak before I surrendered my turn with my eyes, “Jimmy, I think you’ve got a little something I can help you with.” 


He raised one eyebrow and nodded his head toward my hand, I felt the contract warm up with his acknowledgement like it was radioactive. I looked at the contract before looking back at him. I nodded. 


“Okay, Jimmy. Let me take a look at this little deal you’ve made.” His cold smile exploded to a grin that bore teeth.


“Might be time for a last-minute amendment, *wouldn’t you say?”*


There is so much to this story that I’m going to have to give it one more night, the last part is… *a lot.*
