The last time I saw my father, my priorities in life were figuring out which houses on my street would be giving out the full-size candy bars, or how to score an invitation to Samantha’s birthday party at the zoo. So when I received news that he had died, I didn’t feel sad. I didn’t feel much of anything.  

My brother, he had moved to London to be closer to his wife’s family and mom passed away a few years ago. Breast cancer. I don’t often think about my father but in those last months I’d thought about him a lot. I had to stay an extra year to finish up my degree and by the time I had graduated only my brother brought flowers to the ceremony. 

So it came as a complete surprise when I found out that my father was not only a well-respected psychologist, with books and everything to his name, but also a well-respected psychologist who had left his entire estate to me. An actual mansion (albeit in Maine) with the eight bedrooms and those lawn hedges that needed frequent trimmings. I guess he never remarried either.

I’ve been living at the mansion for about a week now, going through his old things, tidying up where I can. It feels invasive in a way, and nosy, because I’m really just his daughter in namesake only. The mansion itself is like something out of a Disney movie; there are these white marble, twin staircases that wrap around the entrance when you first walk in and I’m still finding new corridors and doors that lead to rooms I haven’t seen. The main living room (there are a total of three) *echos* when you talk just above a whisper and a single bedroom in this place is about the size of my apartment back in LA. 

Despite all that, I decided pretty quickly that I wanted to sell this place, not just because this is way too much space for one person, but because there’s something about it that gives me the creeps. It’s not run down or anything; no cobwebs in the corners or rotting wood beams, and if there are stairs that lead to a basement torture chamber, I haven’t found them yet.

No, it’s because there are these giant velvet wall hangings with some sort of crest or symbol on them that I don’t recognize. There’s a circle and in the middle there’s an assortment of rectangles and a line running through them, looking almost like a circuit board– I’ll be the first to admit I’m not the best at describing these things. One wall hanging, I could understand. But why are they in every single room, draped over chairs and blocking out windows? 

And then there are the framed portraits. I found one that must’ve been my father; he vaguely resembled the man I remembered and I could see my eyes in his. But the other photos, men and women of all races ranging from early twenties to what looked like eighty. Who were they? There must’ve been about a hundred or so of these photos, placed all over the mansion and even a week later I’m still discovering new ones in the oddest places. Just yesterday night, I was reading on my phone when a noise outside startled me. When I went to pick up my phone, I found another portrait under the bed. 

On top of that I’m a city girl through and through, and here, you get blank stares just mentioning the word “traffic”. It’s also about a twenty minute drive to the nearest grocery store, and all of the houses around me might as well have their own zip codes.

But it was what I found tonight that was by far the most unnerving. I’d just finished dinner - Mac and Cheese with cut up hotdogs - a dish that felt almost insulting to the kitchen it was made in, when I decided I’d spend some time tonight organizing more of my father's things. I had KEEP, DONATE, SELL, and TRASH piles with the KEEP pile looking the most lonely by far. 

There was one room I hadn’t spent much time in, that I had only peeked in for a brief moment when I first arrived. Judging by the handsome mahogany desk, the floor-to-wall bookshelves and the velvet green chaise lounge and leather chair, it was unmistakably my father’s office. There was something about this room that I wanted to save for last and there was no real reason for it, nothing I could express in words, anyways.  

The room had been arranged with obvious care. I felt a sense of familiarity when I walked in, traced my fingers across these books I’d never heard of, wondered if my father had actually read of all them or if they were for display only. But it was what was tucked under his desk that caught my attention, a cardboard box with a single word scribbled on it. 

**CATHERINE**

*My* name. My father wanted me to find this - but why? 

I wasted no time in peeling off the packing tape, bracing myself for disappointment but hoping for something more. Well, it was a good thing I had prepared because I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t a little let down by what was in the box. 

Cassette tapes. Twenty or so cassette tapes, stacked neatly in rows and on top of each other. I pulled a few from the top and they were all labeled with names and a number - patients of my father, perhaps? 

Now, I may be showing my age here but I’ve never actually used a cassette player. It was by method of deduction that I spotted one sitting on my father’s desk, and after consulting trusty old Google, I was able to play the first tape.

To protect the identity of his patients, I’m going to use initials here. But I wanted to transcribe this session because while I’ve never been to therapy myself, something about this feels off to me. This is the tape that’s been labeled “RT 1”.  

**BEGIN TRANSCRIPT**

**Dr. Ashton:** Good afternoon. I’m Dr. Ashton, you must be R.

**RT**: (*Ahem)* Yes. Yes I am.

**Dr. Ashton**: Well R, the floor is all yours. Would you like to talk about what’s been on your mind?

**RT**: I’m a bit nervous right now, if you couldn’t tell. (*Laughs)* Too much caffeine this morning, that’s why my hands are shaky. See? 

**Dr. Ashton**: Can’t blame you, coffee is what gets me through most days. I hope I’m not the one making you nervous, I promise my friends down at county jail all say I’m really nice. 

**RT**: (*Laughs)* No! No it’s not you. It’s just uh, this is my first time doing this, y’know? My boyfriend he uh, he’s been kinda nagging me to do this, therapy. 

**Dr. Ashton**: Mhm. 

**RT**: It’s just. He wants us to come out to our families. It’s been a whole year, so I get where he’s coming from, I do. But my parents, my family. I don’t think they would…

**Dr. Ashton**: Support you. You don’t think they would understand.

**RT**: It’s not just that. My family, they uh. Think the term here is “religious fanatics”? (*Laughs)* Like straight up drank the Kool-Aid, think all sinners are going to Hell, burn in eternal damnation and all that. 

**Dr. Ashton**: But you don’t believe in any of that.

**RT**: Of course not! I mean, c’mon. It’s 2019. You’d think that by now people can think for themselves. 

**Dr. Ashton**: So it sounds like your family, they have some views you don’t agree with. And it’s causing issues in your relationship. Have you thought about putting some distance? Between you and them. 

**RT**: Yeah. We talked about moving outta this place, to New York or maybe Seattle. That would be nice, I think. Different. But my mom, she uh. Well she has Alzheimer's. And I know in a few years she’s not going to… going to all be there. I know, right? If she knew I were gay she’d tell me I’m going to burn in Hell without even blinking. But she’s still my mom. Woman who raised me. Must be all that Catholic guilt in me. (*Laughs)* 

**Dr. Ashton**: Tell me about your partner. How’d you two meet?

**RT**: Grindr. Romantic right? *(Laughs)* Neither of us were really looking for anything serious, but when you’re one of like 100 gay men within a 50 mile radius and you meet someone you actually click with? It was just supposed to be drinks, our first date. Then one bar turned to two, then three, and before you know it, it’s 4 in the morning and we’re getting burgers and milkshakes at Denny’s. I think the both of us knew what we had found. 

**Dr. Ashton**: And how’s the relationship been? Any issues besides…

**RT**: Besides the one thing that’d destroy my relationship with my family? Ha! Things are nice, they’ve been good. I work nights and he works a 9 to 5 so our schedules don’t always line up but… we make it work. 

**Dr. Ashton**: Am I sensing some hesitation there?

**RT**: Nothing gets past you doctor. 

**Dr. Ashton**: Please, call me Gabriel. 

**RT**: Oh uh, sure. But yeah it’s just that… okay so, I like my job. I work security at the hospital and I know it’s not the most prestigious thing in the world and I’m not making the big bucks. But I like it. I’ve always been more of uh, more of a night owl. And I really like my coworkers, y’know? It just feels familiar to me. 

**Dr. Ashton**: Mhm.

**RT**: But M. He… he wants me to quit. To find something with more “normal hours”. 

**Dr. Ashton**: Why does he want that? 

**RT**: I guess it’s because he wants us to spend more time together? I don’t know. I think it’s sweet that he wants to see me more. We don’t live together right now and uh, it’s really only the weekends when we can see each other. 

**Dr. Ashton**: And you’re okay with that? Only seeing him on the weekends?

**RT**: I mean, no. I want to see him more too. But it’s my job, you know? I’m not just gonna quit my job. And well, to be honest I’ve always had the feeling that… that he… 

**Dr. Ashton**: That he? 

**RT**: … that he looks down on it? I’m not sure. I don’t know if it’s in my head or… He’s never said anything to me, just wanna be clear. But when we’re out with his friends, he makes these little… little comments. Am I making any sense? 

**Dr. Ashton**: Can you give an example? Of these comments. 

**RT**: Yeah like uh, he’ll say stuff about how he’s the sugar daddy in the relationship. Jokingly, of course. He does make a lot more than me. What with his fancy remote job. We’re not living together right now but it’s something we've talked about. And I know you have to discuss finances before moving in with someone, I get that. But he’s always bringing up how he wants a partner to contribute equally to bills, that he doesn’t want to be supporting anyone. I get all of that! But it’s just something about the way he says it…  

**Dr. Ashton**: Do you feel like these comments are digs at your character? At you? 

**RT**: Honestly? Yeah I do. Like if he has a problem with how much I’m making, just tell me. We’re both adults right? Gotta communicate and all that?

**Dr. Ashton**: It almost sounds like he’s ashamed of you. 

**RT**: You know what? I think that’s exactly it. I think he might be ashamed of me. 

**Dr. Ashton**: So M, he wants you to tell your family about your relationship, even though that’s not what you want to do. 

**RT**: …yeah….

**Dr. Ashton**: And he looks down on your job, makes these comments in front of his friends. Do you ever wonder what he says to them when you’re not there?

**RT**: Well… 

**Dr. Ashton**: R, it sounds like people have always been telling you what to do, your family telling you what to believe in, M telling you that you need to go to therapy, you need to find a different job. Doesn’t that get exhausting?   

**RT**: …

**Dr. Ashton**: It sounds exhausting to me. Can I tell you something that I learned way too late in life? 

**RT**: What’s that?

**Dr. Ashton**: “No” is a complete sentence. It’s okay to set boundaries, especially with those closest to you. 

**RT**: I… I guess you’re right. 

**Dr. Ashton**: And R? I don’t know if anyone’s ever told you this, or even if you think this about yourself. But I’m going to tell you right now, that you are enough. 

**RT**: No one’s ever said that to me.

**Dr. Ashton**: Can you say it to yourself right now?

**RT**: Ha. Yeah uh, I… I am enough? 

**Dr. Ashton**: There are always going to be outside influences R, like a close-minded family or a partner that doesn’t see your potential. But what’s important is that you see it in yourself. Because I see it in you. I see a man who has passion for what he does, who values the bonds of family, who desires to love and to be loved. A man who’s deserving. 

**RT**: I… I’ve never really thought of myself in that way Dr. Ash– Gabriel. 

**Dr. Ashton**: Well, that’s what I’m here for, R. To offer a new perspective. To help you see these things that you might not even have known. 

**RT**: Wow, yeah. I mean. I just… You’ve given me a lot to think about. Really. 

**Dr. Ashton**: And right on schedule, it looks like our time is up. I’ll be seeing you again next week? Same time? 

**RT**: Yeah. Yeah I think I’ll be seeing you again.  

**END TRANSCRIPT**

I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t nice to hear my father’s voice again. A longing I didn’t even know I had. It had been so many years, yet hearing him brought me back to chasing ice cream trucks in the summer, flying kites on those especially windy days. 

The therapy session itself, I’m no expert but it was a little weird, right? A little too personal? If anyone has more experience with this I’d love to know your thoughts because I plan on going through all of these tapes.
