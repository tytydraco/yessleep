Morning

I wake to the sound of paws on the floorboards.

“Max, bitte…” I mumble into the pillow. It’s too bright already; the thin curtains can’t hold back the Berlin sun. My head is pounding. I shouldn’t have had that last beer.

Max’s nails click closer. Then a wet nose presses against my cheek, a low whine that means breakfast or walk, choose one.

“Alright, alright, you tyrant.”

I swing my legs over the bed, feel the cold wood, and instantly regret existing. The apartment smells faintly of coffee grounds and dog fur, the two constants of my life. Posters peel from the walls, Freiheit für Tiere!, Science ≠ Suffering! my idealism laminated in cheap ink. A half-finished protest sign leans in the corner beside an old cactus.

I shuffle toward the bathroom. The handle sticks, as always.

“Verdammte… push, come on” using my strength i lean in and with enough effort It gives with a sharp creak.

Then I’m on my knees, retching for the toilet but then i gag up foam and acid. I miss. It splashes on the tile. “Scheiße.”

Max watches from the doorway, ears tilted, confused sympathy in his eyes. “Don’t look at me like that.” I grab paper towels, mop up, dump everything in the bin, rinse my mouth, and smile at the ridiculousness of it all.

Coffee first. Then redemption.

The Message

By the time the caffeine hits, I feel almost human again. I scroll through my phone.
There it is the encrypted chat Green Vein.
Anja: Tonight. 22:00. Tiergarten station. Bring gloves.

Beneath it: a link Novaprax Biotechnik leaked documents.

I open the file. Scans of research memos, grant proposals, photos of white corridors. One phrase repeats: “Behavioural Control via Selective Aggression & Passivity Modulation in Mammalia.”

I mutter, “Selective aggression, my ass.”

They call it pest control, population management. We call it cruelty.

Max noses my knee, demanding attention. “You’d hate them too, huh?”

He yawns. I laugh. I scroll further rumors about trials on stray dogs in Brandenburg. That hits harder than it should.

Outside, trams rattle by. Berlin hums, indifferent. I sip cold coffee and think about Anja’s last voice message: “We just need proof. People listen when they see cages.”

Tonight, we’ll break in. Photograph everything. Leave. No damage. Just truth.

At least, that’s the plan.

Afternoon

The sun burns pale gold through clouds. I clip Max’s leash, pocket my earbuds, and step outside.

It’s one of those perfect days... warm, breezy, alive. Kids chase pigeons near the canal; an old man sells strawberries by the bridge. For a moment, the world feels exactly right.

We cut through Tiergarten. The air smells of rain and grass. Max bounds ahead, tail flagging. I throw a stick; he sprints after it, tongue lolling, pure joy.

A woman with a dachshund smiles at me. “Er ist sehr brav.”

“He tries.”

She laughs, moves on. I watch Max wrestle the stick out of a puddle, proud of his triumph. It hits me how much I love this stupid dog. He’s my family, my roommate, my sanity, the only kumpel that truly understands me.

As we walk home, he shakes off water all over my jeans. I groan. “Unbelievable.” He looks smug. I scratch his head anyway.

For a heartbeat I think: maybe skip tonight. Maybe stay home. But then I remember those lab photos, the tags on animal ears. Someone has to care.

Night

Rain starts as I leave. It patters soft against my hood, misting the empty streets.

The Tiergarten station glows dimly, reflected in puddles. Six of us wait beneath the bridge with Anja and Felix standing together, two students I don’t know, a wiry man named Leo who brought the tools.

No one talks much. Only the rain and the low hiss of car tires on wet asphalt.

We drive east, past the city lights, into the dark countryside. Brandenburg’s flat fields stretch forever. Windmills turn like ghosts.

The facility rises from the fog, cold, concrete, sterile, ringed with fences. No guards visible. Just floodlights and cameras.

Leo cuts the wire with a hiss. We crawl through, hearts hammering. Inside: warehouses, shipping crates, ventilation ducts breathing steam.

A keypad door yields to Felix’s stolen code. Cold fluorescent light washes over us.

At first, we didn’t even know what we were looking at. The room was lined with cages, floor to ceiling, but not the kind you’d expect from an abuse exposé. Everything gleamed under white fluorescent lights. Stainless steel, spotless floors, filtered air humming quietly from vents above.

Inside the cages were monkeys, capuchins, a few macaques just watching us with steady, unblinking eyes. Their fur was clean. They had food. Water. Even toys.

It was unnerving, how calm they were.

I stepped closer to one of them, crouched until we were eye level. He didn’t shrink back, didn’t show a single flinch of fear. Just blinked at me, slow, deliberate, like he understood that I shouldn’t be here.

“No trauma response,” I muttered, frowning. “That doesn’t make sense.”

Felix’s voice pulled us away. He’d found a terminal still glowing green in the corner, stacks of printed notes scattered beside it. The paper rustled as he flipped through. His expression changed, first confusion, then a flash of alarm.

“These apes aren’t the test subjects,” he said, his voice suddenly low, tense. “They’re controls. Baseline samples to make sure there’s no risk of primate infection symptoms.”

“What?” Elke asked.

He swallowed. “They’re testing something they already know doesn’t affect us. Humans. Primates. That’s why these ones look so... fine.”

A chill crept down my spine.

At the far end of the room, a set of clear PVC strip curtains swayed gently in the recycled air. A rhythmic mechanical hum pulsed beyond them, steady, rhythmic, like a heartbeat amplified through metal.

I didn’t wait for anyone else. I just ran.

The plastic strips slapped against my shoulders as I burst through and then froze.

Rows. Endless rows of cages, each lit by cold surgical lamps. Rabbits. Raccoons. Dogs. All sedated, motionless, their chests rising shallowly. Tubes threaded into veins, monitors flashing tiny green heartbeats. Charts hung from clipboards, each stamped with a single block code: RFX.

Anja’s whisper trembled. “Take pictures. Fast.”

My hands shook as I pulled out my phone. Through the camera lens, the world looked even more wrong. The sterile white light, the gleam of steel, the limp bodies breathing because machines told them to.

A red-taped door stood at the back, the paint chipped where someone had scraped at it. RFX: Mammal Behaviour Control Trials.

Otto adjusted his glasses, eyes darting over the cages. “There’s only mammals here... why?”

Elke pressed her hand to her mouth, her voice breaking. “What the hell is this?”

The machines just kept humming.

And for the first time I realized we weren’t here to uncover abuse. We were standing in the middle of something that wasn’t supposed to exist.

Before anyone answers, Leo smashes the lock. The door swings open.

Inside, glass cylinders filled with pale fluid hum like beehives. The air smells metallic, sharp. Screens blink with genetic code.

Anja lifts her camera. Flash.

Something bursts, a pipe as the nozzle came loose a mist of red vapor sprays across us. My eyes sting; I cough violently.

“Scheiße! Back out! Back out! This it the real thing!”

Alarms blare. Red lights strobe.

We scatter, crashing into corridors, slipping on wet tiles. I grab the railing, slick with the same reddish residue. My glove tears.

Outside, rain slaps my face. We run through mud, headlights flashing in the distance, most definitely security or even police.

By the time I reach the car, my lungs burn. My jacket sticks to my skin.

We split up at the city limits. I take the U-Bahn home alone, still trembling, the smell of iron in my nose.

Home

The apartment feels unreal, too small, too quiet for my racing mind.

But then Max barks once, joyous. He jumps up, paws on my chest. I hug him, half-crying, half-laughing. “You won’t believe the day I had.”

I toss my soaked jacket and gloves in a heap by the door. I’ll wash them tomorrow.

Shower first. The water runs pink as the rain. I tell myself it’s dye, nothing more.

When I step out, the mirror fogs over. My skin tingles faintly, but I chalk it up to nerves.

Max is sniffing the jacket pile, whining softly. “Hey, don’t chew that,” I warn, nudging him away. He obeys, tail wagging uncertainly.

I pour cereal, eat standing up. My eyes sting from exhaustion.

“Good night, Max,” I murmur, patting his head. He licks my fingers, then pads to his blanket by the door.

I collapse onto the bed and drift.

The Sound

Scratching.

At first it folds into the dream, leaves on a window, wind through branches.

Then louder. Rhythmic. Wood against metal.

I open my eyes. The room is black except for the faint LED glow of the alarm clock. 3:42 a.m.

“Max?”

No answer.

The scratching comes again, from the hallway. Then a low growl, wet, guttural, unfamiliar...

I sit up, heart thudding. “Max, was ist los?”

Something bumps the bedroom door. A soft whine. Then silence.

I get up slowly, bare feet on cold floor, and reach for the handle.


---

The Dog

“Max, are you—”

The door cracks open.

He’s crouched there, shoulders twitching, chest heaving. His fur clings damp to his body, eyes red and swollen, pupils tiny pinpoints. Drool hangs in ropes from his mouth.

For a second I freeze, thinking he’s sick, poisoned maybe. “Oh, Gott, Max, what happened—”

He lunges.

The door slams into my arm; teeth close on skin. Pain flares, hot and bright. I scream and shove, catching the edge of the frame. Blood sprays.

He thrashes, snarling, forcing his way through the gap. I slam the door again, but his strength is unreal.

“Stop! Max, stop!”

He doesn’t hear. He doesn’t even blink.

I break free, stumble backward through the kitchen. My arm is dripping. The tiles blur.

He charges, claws skittering, jaws snapping. I grab a chair and swing it. Wood splinters against his flank. He yelps, then growls deeper, madder.

“Please, Max…” My voice cracks.

He circles, panting, eyes locked on me like prey.


---

The Bathroom!

The only door that locks, the bathroom...

I dash for it, lungs burning. My blood leaves streaks on the wall.

Behind me, the crash of claws, the hiss of breath, rabid barking i had only seen on gore site videos or rabies documentaries.

I barley shut the rotten passage way door as Max smashed against it with predatory fury.

I reach the handle. It sticks.

“No, no, not now.”

I press down, but my fingers tremble. The metal feels slick. The lever barely moves.

I shove harder with all my might, shoulder against the frame. Nothing.

He hits the door; it jolts. The wood cracks.

I try again, but my arm gives out, the bitten one. Numb now. Weak.

I sob, pushing with all I have. The handle still won’t budge as i collapse, my legs giving way.

The door groans once more, then splinters inward.

Something heavy slams into me.


---

The Mauling

I instantly feel excruciating pain as my once best friend bites into me like a crocodilian during a death roll an agonizing buring sensation all throughout my body, spreading fast. The world shrinks to noise: claws, snarls, my own heartbeat drumming out as i gradually lose the strength... freedom to move as if the venom of a komodo dragon is coursing through my veins.

The hall light flickers. The rusted handle of the bathroom gleams dully, my hand twitching as Max feasts upon me as his last supper.

I think of Tiergarten, of sunlight and grass, of Max rolling on his back while children laughed.

Then there’s only dark.
