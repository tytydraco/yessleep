I settled into my seat, adjusting my backpack and trying to get comfortable for the long ride ahead. I'd been looking forward to this trip for weeks, eager to get out of the city and spend some time in the countryside. The train rumbled to life beneath me, and we began to move, slowly at first, but gaining speed as we left the station behind.

As we picked up pace, I felt a thrill of excitement. There's something about train travel that's always appealed to me – the rhythm of the tracks, the scenery rolling by outside the windows, the sense of being in motion without having to do anything myself.

But as the hours ticked by, I began to feel a growing sense of unease. We'd been moving for what felt like an eternity, and yet, we didn't seem to be getting anywhere. The scenery outside the windows was always the same – rolling hills, fields, and forests, with the occasional town or village flashing by in a blur.

I checked my watch for what felt like the hundredth time, wondering when we'd finally arrive at our destination. But according to the schedule, we still had hours to go. I sighed, feeling a pang of frustration. Why were we moving so slowly?

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the landscape, I decided to get up and stretch my legs. I walked down the aisle, nodding to the other passengers as I passed. Some of them looked up from their books or phones, while others barely acknowledged my presence.

I made my way to the café car, hoping to find some answers. Maybe someone there could tell me what was going on, why we were taking so long to reach our destination. But when I arrived, I found the car empty, except for a lone attendant who was busy cleaning the counters.

"Excuse me," I said, trying to sound friendly. "Can you tell me what's going on? Why are we taking so long to get to our destination?"

The attendant looked up, a bland expression on his face. "I'm afraid there's been a... delay," he said, his voice dripping with vagueness. "We'll get there when we get there."

I felt a surge of frustration. "That's not good enough," I said, trying to keep my cool. "I need to know what's going on. Is there something wrong with the train?"

The attendant shrugged. "I don't know anything about that. You'll just have to be patient."

I scowled, feeling a growing sense of unease. Something wasn't right. I could feel it in my bones.

As I made my way back to my seat, I noticed something strange. The other passengers seemed... off. They were all staring out the windows, their faces blank and expressionless. It was as if they were in some kind of trance.

I felt a shiver run down my spine. What was going on? Was everyone else in on some kind of secret that I wasn't privy to?

I approached one of the passengers, a middle-aged woman who was sitting across from me. "Excuse me," I said, trying to sound friendly. "Do you know how long we've been on the train?"

She looked up at me, a confused expression on her face. "I... I don't know," she said. "I don't even remember getting on the train."

I felt a chill run down my spine. "You don't remember getting on the train?" I repeated.

She shook her head. "No. I just... I just woke up, and I was here."

I looked around the train car, feeling a growing sense of unease. Were we all in some kind of collective amnesia? Did none of us know how long we'd been on the train?

As the hours ticked by, I became more and more agitated. We were still moving, the train rumbling along the tracks, but we didn't seem to be getting anywhere. The scenery outside the windows was always the same, and the other passengers seemed to be in some kind of trance.

I tried to stay calm, telling myself that there had to be a logical explanation for what was happening. But as the darkness deepened outside, and the train continued to move without stopping, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was very, very wrong.

And then, just as I was starting to drift off to sleep, I heard a voice. It was low and raspy, and it seemed to be coming from all around me.

"We're not going anywhere," it said. "We're just going to keep moving, forever and ever and ever."

I sat up with a start, my heart racing. Who was speaking? And what did they mean?

As I looked around the train car, I saw that the other passengers were still staring out the windows, their faces blank and expressionless. But I knew that I wasn't alone. There was something else on this train, something that didn't want us to ever reach our destination.

The voice spoke again, its words echoing in my mind. "We're not going anywhere. We're just going to keep moving, forever and ever and ever."

I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead as I realized the true horror of our situation. We were trapped on this train, doomed to ride the rails forever, never reaching our destination, never escaping.

I tried to scream, but my voice was hoarse and barely audible. I tried to move, but my body felt heavy and unresponsive. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to do anything but sit there and listen to the voice.

As the hours ticked by, the voice continued to speak, its words dripping with malice and sadistic pleasure. It told us about the others who had ridden the train before us, the ones who had never escaped. It told us about the endless landscape that stretched out before us, the same scenery repeating itself over and over again.

And it told us that we would never be free.

I don't know how much longer I can hold on. The voice is still speaking, its words echoing in my mind, driving me slowly mad. I'm trapped on this train, doomed to ride the rails forever, never escaping.

And I know that I'm not alone. There are others out there, others who are trapped just like me. We're all just pawns in some twisted game, forced to ride the train forever, never reaching our destination.

I'm not sure how much longer I can take this. The voice is getting louder, its words more insistent. I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality, like I'm slipping into some kind of madness.

And I know that I'll never be free.

The train is still moving, the scenery outside the windows still rolling by. But I know that we're not going anywhere. We're just trapped on this train, forever doomed to ride the rails.

I have to escape this shit hole.
