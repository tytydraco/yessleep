The shit below is 100% real, rn I'm 17yo guy living in a city called Tumkur, Karnataka, India 

Back in April 2024, right after my 10th board exams, my parents and I went on a family trip to Goa with their friends. The drive from Tumkur is long, so we stayed a night in Shivamogga, saw Jog Falls, and eventually reached Karwar by 4 in the afternoon.

We could’ve pushed on to Goa, but my dad said Karwar beach was just as good and finding a hotel at night in Goa would be messy. So we checked into a 4-star place about 500–600 meters from Rabindranath Tagore beach. It was part of a shopping complex—basement parking, supermarket and tech stores on the ground floor, shops on the first, offices on the second, a dental clinic on the third, then the hotel lobby on the fifth.

That evening we hit the beach, came back, freshened up, and then walked to a restaurant called Shweta Lunch Home for dinner. After stuffing myself, I wanted to head back quickly, but my parents lingered for dessert. So I went ahead alone.

Here’s where things get strange.

When we checked in earlier, I’d noticed a security guard on the ground floor. But this time—nothing. The whole complex was dark and empty, shutters pulled down. I remembered I’d left my earbuds in the car, so I went down into the basement to grab them. The lighting was dim, and the silence pressed in heavy. I snatched the earbuds and ran up to the ground floor for the lift.

This was no ordinary lift—it was a glass elevator right in the center of the complex. I stepped in and pressed for the fifth floor.

The first thing I noticed was movement. Something—like a shadow—darted across the stairwell with impossible speed, straight up to the first floor. My chest tightened.

The doors opened at the first floor. Nobody was there, but the lift had been called. I swear I heard the button click. I stayed still. That shadow flickered again.

Second floor. Again, the lift stopped. This time I saw something more than a shadow—two glowing eyes, staring from inside a darkened office. They didn’t move. They didn’t blink.

By the third floor, I was trembling. The doors slid open and I saw a figure through the glass—a body, tall, easily six feet, standing in one of the office spaces. It didn’t step forward, just stared, its eyes locked on me.

I wasn’t ready for the fourth floor. My mind screamed don’t look, so I squeezed my eyes shut. When the doors opened, I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe properly. My throat caught like I was trying to scream but no sound came. My knees gave way and I collapsed inside the elevator.

When the lift finally reached the fifth floor, the hotel lobby staff saw me on the floor and rushed over. I must’ve looked pathetic, but in that moment I was grateful—grateful to see actual people.

I stumbled into my room, locked the door, and sat frozen in the bathroom. Even as I tried to calm myself, I kept the bathroom door wide open, because closing it felt worse.

I don’t know what I saw in that elevator, but I’ll never forget those eyes watching me...
