 

It was a bit of a shock when my grandfather died and didn’t leave my dad any of my great-grandfather’s things. Most likely, he didn’t want to help play into his unhealthy fascination, a decision I and the rest of my extended family greatly appreciated. 

Anybody to meet my father was quick to encounter his bubbling enthusiasm for the “old West.” When I was seven, he took me to the Grand Lake to see Unforgiven, the newest of Clint Eastwood’s films. He picked me up from school – grinning like a maniac – in full cowboy gear, complete with an appropriately gaudy pork pie hat. He smacked the side of the car, pretending to spur a horse into action, and looked at me with pointed eyebrows. I always knew what was coming with that look, and he knew that I knew. We inhaled sharply, and both let out a booming “Hyaah! Let’s ride!”

Often my father would draw ire from his cocky manufactured drawl and chronic habit of intimidation. When confronted, he would attribute his Western frontier obsession to his “ancestry”, a connection to my great-grandfather. “A true frontiersman,” he would explain. “I’m just doing right by him.”

Obviously, that’s a flimsy reason. The truth is, I don’t even think he knew why he was so enamored with the idea. No one but my grandfather knew much of anything about the “brave settler” that was my great-grandfather, not even about the town that he supposedly founded and defended against the “last dregs of wickedness plaguing the pre-modernized West,” as the story goes. 

My father was unfazed by my grandfather’s refusal to validate his infatuation. He continued to play up his connection to the old West, even going as far as joining a cowboy reenactment troupe in San Bernardino and amassing a surely world-record winning Old West memorabilia collection. He would often tell progressively dramatized stories about my great-grandfather's supposed adventures on the frontier, even though those who stayed around long enough to hear them were just humoring him. 

Despite my attempts to regularly spend time with my father, an activity I’ve learned is impossible to do while also remaining unembarrassed, I’ve felt a rift grow between us, as he slips further into delusion while I become grounded. Slowly, I’ve started to gain the things that are becoming of a man: a fiancé, a dog, a stable, well-paying job, friends (but not too many) and a too-expensive house. Lately he’s struck me as just one of those eccentrics you encounter out in the world, which I observed is probably a similar feeling as those who meet him for the first time. In times of vulnerability I hate myself for thinking that thought – he’s my father, not a gimmick. But no matter how much I regretted my disdain for his way of life now, the fact remained that my dad lived a lie and I didn’t. 

At least, that’s what I thought until today.

Appearing on my doorstep was a small, worn cardboard box. The corners were stained and the stench of mold and decay was overpowering; it was obvious that it’d been neglected in some damp corner for years. Since it was addressed to “Nephew Wyatt” and flaunting a PO box return address in Maine, it was probably from my uncle Howard, who I hadn’t seen since his retreat into hermithood after a messy divorce.  

With suspense, I brought the box inside. No one had heard from uncle Howard in almost a decade, and suddenly a box from him shows up on my doorstep? I sat down on my couch and gingerly ran scissors through the hasty layers of clear duct tape holding the box closed. 

Inside was a single journal, beaten and blemished, with a note sitting on top spelling out something that made my heart skip a beat. 

“DO NOT SHOW HIM”, scrawled in large, harsh font, stared back at me from the inside of the box. I reached inside and turned the note over to reveal a longer, even more cryptic message in neat cursive. 

“Dear Wyatt,” the note read. “I am afraid I can no longer keep this. When your grandfather entrusted it to me in his will, it was my full intention to keep it safe until my own death. I can no longer bear having it in my possession. It’s too much. Please, for his own sake, don’t show this to your father. I am afraid he will try to go there. To Whispering Pines. Don’t let him go.”

The note ended there. As I set it down and picked up the tattered journal, I hesitated. There was no doubt in my mind that it would contain something revealing, but that isn’t what made me stop. Something I noticed that immediately put a chill through my spine as I looked up.

The lights were off. All of them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t turn them off. And even though it was the middle of the day and the windows were open, the light coming through was dim and muted. The room was shrouded in unnatural swirling shadows, bent by the noir sunbeams. The silence in the room suddenly sounded loud, as if the entire space was waiting to hear something. I wasn’t alone.

I was becoming good and paranoid now, my heart beating so fast it could have been trying to tear its way out of my chest and run away. My throat closed, and my eyes subconsciously darted to the darkest corners of the room, expecting something to come racing towards me out of the abyss. My ears filled with the sound of my own heavy, labored breaths; time started to slow down and I felt every agonizing second as my mind raced to fight the creeping dread seeping into my every pore. I let out an involuntary whimper. This paranoia seemed manufactured, imposed – but I was falling prey to it and its unseen creator. I couldn’t move, not even a tilt of the head. All the anxious thoughts racing through my brain were slowly replaced by a chanting mantra in a voice that didn’t match my own. It whispered loudly with a shrill, building urgency –

*Come to Whispering Pines. Come to Whispering Pines. Come to Whispering Pines. Come to Whispering Pines. Come to Whispering Pines. Come to Whispering Pines. Come to Whispering Pines. COME TO WHISPERING PINES. COME TO WHISPERING PINES.*

My head was almost filled to the brim with pure panic. The white noise in my ears became louder and louder until even my previously deafening gulps of air were drowned out. A terrifyingly strong pressure pushed on my brain like a migraine. The primal part of me had already accepted death; in this fight or flight moment, my instincts had chosen neither. In what could be my final seconds, my overloaded and overwhelmed brain managed to eke out only a single comprehensible thought–

*What the fuck is happening?*

Almost to answer my thought, it stopped. The ceiling lights flickered and returned, and the sunlight coming through the window went back to its normal hue. I fell to the floor like a marionette doll. I spent a few moments shocked, terrified to move or look around. I wasn’t sure that it was over. Attempting to shake off my clamminess, I stared at the journal I had picked up what seemed like forever ago. Far from providing a distraction, the front cover renewed the fading feeling of foreboding. 

“Bennett Wardock, California 1898”. *Bennett.* My great-grandfather. The hair on my arm holding the book stood on end. But I was in the shit now, as far as I was concerned; I needed to commit. I opened the front cover to reveal a faded tintype photo printed on a thin sheet of metal tucked in front of the first page.

It pictured a large group of people, the men wearing loose cotton overshirts and chaps and the women long, patchy dresses with the odd bonnet. They looked beaten up. Dirt muddied their faces and hands; they carried a palpable weariness, but were smiling broadly. In the center kneeled a beaming man that was the spitting image of my grandfather. He wore his age well - his silver hair provided a curious contrast to his lack of wrinkles. The kind brown eyes I recognized were similar to my father’s. He was obviously tall, and even while kneeling in front of the group he was higher than their torsos. He held his faded hat to his chest.

The backdrop to this old photo was an impossibly dense grove of trees, each trunk practically pressing up against the other. The branches seemed to intermingle and overlap, forming a strong barricade. It almost looked intentional. I flipped the picture. *Whispering Pines, 1898. Day of arrival.* There it was again, that name. I shuddered.

I turned the photo back over and began to place it to the side, preparing to read, but I stopped cold. My great-grandfather was the only one remaining in the picture. Every other member of the group was missing. He no longer sported his wide, genuine grin – he was scowling, with squinting, hardened eyes and looking a decade older. The lack of color didn’t put into question that he was covered in blood. Practically drenched. Without warning, my great-grandfather’s mouth started to move. 

“Come here, Wyatt,” he beckoned. “Come to Whispering Pines.”

As I watched in horror, the picture started to come alive, the gray drops of blood dripping and pooling at his feet as he stood up and started walking towards the edge of the frame. He grinned again, but it was an impossibly wide smile, a sinister one that reached the edge of his face. I cried out and dropped the picture. This time, though, nothing stopped – he continued his march towards the camera lens, a slow, lurching walk that seemed inhuman. I couldn’t tear the photo, I realized. It was made of metal. 

I sprinted to my kitchen, panting with fear. *I need to burn it.* I tore through the shelves and cupboards, looking for matches, a lighter, anything. “Wyatt,” the voice boomed from the living room. It sounded louder now, more real. 

I finally came across a dusty butane torch in a cupboard and barreled back to the living room. My shaky hands could barely keep a strong grip on the torch, but I squeezed the button and successfully ignited it. My great-grandfather, or rather some creature that had assumed his image, hadn’t reached the front yet, but it was close. Close enough for me to see that its eyes weren’t quite right; in each familiar brown eye were two pupils. Kneeling, I pointed the blue flame towards the picture, watching it blacken as the print was erased. It was over. I spent a long time kneeling on that floor in disbelief. The reality of my experience hit me then, and I cried. Some part of me knew that I had left a big piece of myself behind. I stayed on the floor, alternating between stunned silence and regretful tears, for hours, until I slept. When I awoke, calm, I decided against reading the journal, and stowed it back in the box and put it in the garage. 

For the following week, part of me thought that the worst was behind me. Regardless, the intensity, the *vividness* of the experience was so raw and horrifying that I’ve been avoiding looking at pictures for a while. My fiancé is now the designated mail retriever.

At night I still dream disconcerting dreams. One recurring nightmare I struggle with places me in a wide meadow in a small valley surrounded by trees. I look around and notice that the treeline grows closer when I’m not looking. I try to stop it, spinning around in circles to stop its advancement, but to no avail. The treeline comes nearer and nearer, until a ring of evergreens surrounds my body like a cage. I lose my ability to move; my vision goes blurry and dark. I feel a coldness spread throughout my body. I want to grow, to live. I want to reach towards the sun and feed off of its rays. My thoughts become slow and meandering, and my focus wanes. I realize: I have become a tree. 

Recently, I’ve been feeling strangely compelled to head to the garage, take out the journal and start reading. This morning, I woke up from the same nightmare sprawled in front of the garage door. I got up and realized that my fingers were bleeding; the door to the garage was locked and painted with bloody scratch marks. 

A week ago I was in control of my own life – and now I’m being sucked into a mystery of a waking nightmare. I’ve cursed Uncle Howard and his selfishness, considered passing it on to my father to attempt to stop the insanity, but a part of me I didn’t know was there has steeled itself for what’s to come.

I don’t think it’s going to stop until I read the journal.
