Hey yall. I've never been much of an '*internet poster*' guy, but I'm out here for the next week or two and I had to share my find. Just a little info ahead of this, my in-laws recently purchased some land with a relatively old, but nice, house. it's in southern Indiana outside Bedford and used to be for farming corn. I've been coming out here every few months, and I spend a couple weeks when i do, renovating it. This week I was focusing on one of the upstairs rooms. I was removing plaster that was over one of the walls and I found a little slide closet. it was about 3 foot by 3 foot, but it had a little keyhole on it. I went to open it expecting it to be locked, but I guess the lock was weak or wasn't set because it opened without issue. Thank goodness, because the only keys I have are for the front and back. behind it was a little leather trunk, with little mementos inside. odd knickknacks, kid's shoes with a pocket watch, and a picture of a young man with a much older gentleman. On the back of the photo was written "Tom 'N' Arnold".  I don't know much about the prior owners, but getting this to their relatives could be cool. 



Now the main reason I'm posting here is because in the trunk was a little notebook which had little stories about a hero named Tommy having heroic adventures. most are benign little kid stories, or have him swearing at his 'sidekick' Arnold. some are even funny.

The last story kept me up last night, and I'm laughing at myself right now, but hopefully you all can too and put my mind at ease! haha!

The last story is clearly written by someone older. Although thinking about it, it wasn't that they were 'older' or rather, that it had no childlike wonder in it. 

In fact I think it best if I just transcribe it verbatim.



**"There is a body on the back porch swing.** 

**a man been bothering papaw, an kept watching us from the crop.**

**papaw went outside an pointed the gun at them. I dont know what he was yellin.**

**was dark. I saw the man walk wierd fast at papaw. he look wierd. his arms touch the ground.** 

**he grabbed papaw an papaw shot him.** 

**the man fell backwards onto the swing an papaw came back inside.** 

**papaws on the kitchen floor an isn breathing. he dont look hurt.**

**the man looks like hes sleeping an hes only wearing white nighties.** 

**there's a hole in his chest, but its not red. theres nothing."**



followed after, there's a much finer written sentence. as if written much later.



**"Theres no body on the back porch swing."**



Now I don't have service out here, and only have what most would consider dialup. (Yay! 87 kb download speed) but I went out to the back porch and there IS a porch swing, although old and rotting. the paint is all flaked away or sun bleached, except... there's a hint of an outline where someone could have sat. Now that could just as easily be because someone DID sit there regularly... but out a few yards, the land is owned by another family or something and there's corn- as far as the eye can see. So i got the weirdest feeling in the pit of my stomach and took a break. I'm at a McDonalds about a 40 minute drive out, and using their wifi to post this, because I couldn't get it to post back there. 

Just wanted to get some other peoples perspective on how silly a kids story made me feel. I looked online, and through the seller history, and There's nothing on this. In fact, the house has been moved between banks the past few decades.

ANYWAY, I'll be out here for like 10 more days, make me feel silly!
