Chateau de Veuil is not much of a castle--more a ruin. A single tower and white facade, overgrown grounds, a musty cavernous cellar. The cellar is the point of this story. Just thinking about it causes my heart to race. But we'll get to that. Let me explain the nature of my presence at Chateau de Veuil first.

I was there on an internship after a year studying in nearby Tours through a student exchange program my second year of college. I spoke French, and used this to avail myself of French culture which I loved. My time there was ending with the end of classes, so naturally I jumped at the opportunity to stay longer when I saw the internship posted to my university's online student portal:

&#x200B;

>"*Intern wanted -- June, July 2008. Work at a French castle! Give tours of the castle in French and English, assist with on-site events, promotion activities, and grounds upkeep. 1 hour outside Tours. Room and board provided!*"

Before writing this I searched for the castle on Google. It's cleaner now. When I was there, there were no prim paths to walk, no pert grass to frame the impressive stone structure. It was mostly high grass and weeds crowding the property.

Back in '08 there weren't many pictures of this place online. Now there are tons. The pictures of events--dining tables, caterers, wine aplenty. These remind me of moments I can pick out and analyze in a bubble as something I enjoyed. I was barman, caterer, dishwasher. Lots of jobs. Anything Claude needed.

Claude owned the place, and handled everything. A full personality, extroverted, gregarious. One time we went to another castle nearby, a big colonial estate, for Bastille Day. We handed out Chateau de Veuil event brochures to locals who'd gone to watch fireworks and mingle among Louis XIV period-dressed attendants and guests along lantern-lit gravel paths. By night's end he was more popular than the spectacle itself. 

Just to show what kind of guy Claude was. Outgoing, life of the party, talkative and boisterous.

The opposite of me. Weird then that I would lead tours.

I was at Chateau de Veuil for two months. It's well off the beaten path so only the French pentioners found their way into the tours I gave. Back then there was no room to rent in the tower, it was roofless and the stone was mossed over. I see in Google images that Claude finished it, and it's part of wedding packages he offers now. We did smaller events. And the tours.

I feel silly writing this. Maybe I dreamt the whole thing. Why are there no pictures of the cellar? It has been 15 years. You can find all sort of images. But none of the cellar. My spine tingles, my jaw aches from this subdermal fear resonating right now--I'm on the brink of diving into the story that has stayed with me all these years, and the physiological response in my body is terrifying me! I'm pressing on. I can't keep it to myself.

It began with the very first tour.

Here is how a tour would go. I'd greet the group at the entrance to the grounds. I'd introduce myself. French pensioners are surprised by a young American telling them about a piece of their heritage, and are therefore demanding in their penetrating questions. I loved the French penchant for skipping small talk, but I could never tell if they were trying to trip me up on purpose or were genuinely curious. I decided it was the former.

"What month was the castle completed?" "What is the family history of title ownership behind this castle?" "What is the architectural style?" "Why is it a ruin?" "Were the occupants royalists during the revolution?" "Where is the quarry that furbished the stone?" "Who lived here in 1640?"

Claude equipped me with vast knowledge about his castle, so I could answer quite a lot. I don't remember any of it now.

From the gates of the grounds I'd walk them through the outbuildings first, where we hosted events (a bit of marketing-in-action), then straddle up alongside the facade, regailing the group with the facts I memorized. We'd enter through the facade's gatehouse, wrap around along paths that I'd hacked into the bush until we entered the still-standing tower. Here was a wrapping stone staircase into the cellar.

Down we'd wrap, crossing a threshold noticeable by all the senses--it became hard to see, the frigid and humid air summoned your goosebumps, a dank smell like earth rot, the hard stone walls created hollow echos of your shuffling feet. My voice carried that echo as well while I explained the uses of this space over the years: storage mostly, but also people slept here at times, wine was matured in barrels when the estate had a vineyard, there were things about its construction that were interesting but I can't recall them now.

The groups were never more than six to seven people. The cellar was vast compared to what was left of its castle. It was comprised of three domed caverns, sheathed in heavy foundation stones. These connected to each other with arched tunnels of the same stone. In French a cellar is "*cave*", which is more apt for the way this subterranean space made you feel, a cave. Something old, dark, and natural.

The group would emerge, and the tour always ended with an apertif I'd serve in the yard under a cypress.

That was a tour.

Something that I noticed on that first tour was a dimple in the dirt floor of the furthest cavern. I hadn't seen it during the other times I'd come down here alone, lamp in hand, practicing my French elocution. It was a small crater, right in the center of the room, directly beneath the apex of the vaulted dome where the wall stones met perfectly around a capstone. Nothing special, but had it not been flat there before? It was shallow enough, so I filled it with loose dirt.

For whatever reason it gave me an idea. The pensioners' questions were so demanding that I decided I'd make up a story to spite them. Some ruse to pique their interest and muddle their retelling of their experience at Veuil. A white lie, to make a boring cellar something mentionable.

I would tell them that in the 16th century, a prince had been imprisoned in the last cavern of the cellar. A prince or cousin-prince, someone in the house of Bourbon who would remain nameless. He had been imprisoned there, under false pretenses, but fell ill and died. To hide the crime, he was buried deep under the very dirt floor in the cavern that served as his cell, never to be revealed, no grave marker to speak of.

I even told Claude of my deception during lunch one day. My guilt needing his approval or I'd stop the silliness. Claude was normally frenetic, and had teeth so large they might be mistaken as dentures--he was only 55. His skin was always cherry red, perhaps to match the excitement he always displayed at socializing. But when I mentioned this to him, I swear his skin went from red to white, and he just smiled shyly and went back to spreading foie gras on a bit of toast, crunching it with those big teeth.

The first time I told the story, the sceptical bunch threw questions at me, which I absorbed into the ruse. I told it again, and it felt more natural now. I embellshed the story with ever greater details that had come from previous questions. The dimple in the cavern floor was there again, probably from the shuffling feet. I would fill it with dirt, pour water in and pack it down with the sole of shoe.

June progressed and I'd perfected the story of the buried prince. I had tips to prove it.

Then one day I brought a group down into the cellar. In the final cavern, which is where I'd begin to tell my story, my heart felt heavy at the sight of the dimple grown into a larger hole, a foot in diameter, half again as deep. 

"Qu'est-ce que c'est que Ã§a?" *What's that?*

Looking back I should have stopped there. It was obvious. But how was I to know? Instead I had the group surround the hole as I recounted the story of the buried prince. Almost as a reflex, I incorporated the hole into the end of the story, saying:

"It looks like he's trying to escape."

I got some tips, but I lost a few of the pensioners with that silly sign off.

I remember I went to Claude to ask if he'd been down in the cellar. He hadn't. I couldn't remember when he *had* gone down there. I had gone by myself with the one lamp when he first gave me a tour of the grounds.

After the tour was over and the apertifc consumed and the pensioners back in their van, I returned to the cellar. I hadn't been down there alone for all of June. The thumping heart in my chest made me realize this. I'd been accompanied by a tour group each time. Alone, with tinnitus singing in my ear, and otherwise that cold damp echo of my movements giving me away to the darkness, I felt afraid. I peered into the darkness in the direction of the last cavern, where the hole was and my story had echoed a dozen times now. My feet felt planted, and an unnatural sensation filled me, caused me to turn and run back up the stairs.

I found that when the next tour came a day later, I was able to walk back down, and make my way to the last cavern in the presence of the group. My happy-go-lucky attitude at this comfort quickly dissipated when I saw a hole now two feet deep and as wide all around. I stood speechless as the group shuffled past and crowded into the cavern, surrounding the central hole. One man said to me I ought to fill in the hole because someone could trip and fall.

I nodded, staring at the hole.

Someone made a joke and they laughed, but I hadn't caught the meaning. I remember that I didn't tell the story of the prince and instead mentioned wine storage before ending the tour.

"Claude," I recall saying to him later. It was dinner. We had most of our meals together. Otherwise I would use torn bits of baguette to scoop from a large dish of foie gras Claude has cooked for me. Tonight we were eating something rich and delicious, I don't remember what, but Claude was jovial.

"There's a hole in the last cave of the cellar, and it has gotten bigger."

"Hmm?" he murmured through chewing.

"The cellar, when I take a tour there, there was a hole in the last chamber, in the ground. It grew once, and then again."

"I don't believe you, you dug it," he said. I remember he said it in a way that was pleasant and playful. He had no clue.

"I... can show you," I said, feeling the effort to overcome my own hesitation.

"Sure," he said, "if you want. Tomorrow." He smiled toothily, mischevious eyes delighting in the meal. Somehow his disposition calmed me, and we went back to eating and discussing other things.

This is the night I remember most vividly. I was asleep in my room, which was in one of the outbuildings, second story. It was summer so I slept with the small woodframed window open just a little. A pleasant breeze made noises in the trees.

But a scream jolted me awake. A man's scream. It was only Claude and I here, so I immediately thought Claude had done something, maybe he had fallen or cut himself. I threw off the covers, shivering more out of the psychology of the action than it being at all chilly. Threw on my pants and shirt and hustled down the stairs. Another scream. It was from outside.

There was no light at Chateau de Veuil apart from the moon. The castle looked pretty in moonbeam. A scream again, but a word was howled. Two words maybe. It echoed off the castle facade, which I found myself running toward. Traversed the gatehouse, round the paths to the tower.

"*On feece*!" I made out, unsure what I heard cold and sharp off the walls of the winding staircase down into the cellar. I hesistated. What was he *doing* down there? On feeeeece! The echo warped Claude's scream.

I descended, but having sprinted across the grounds to get here, now I took each deliberate step as if the stone might give way and I'd plummet unguarded into the dark below. Careful. Make it. Don't fall. "*Mon fils!!*" came the terrible cry. Crisp and clear now: "*my son*," he shrieked.

I didn't have the lamp. Neither had Claude. It was pitch black, but he kept screaming at intervals "my son", and though I knew he was in the last chamber of the cellar, it sounded like he was right beside me, and all around. My heart pumped, the blood in my ears brought my tinnitus to a roaring tune. My heart raced with the proximity to the screaming man. But he screamed so loudly and sharply that whatever poise I'd mustered broke completely and I scrambled back up the stairs, ran at full speed across the grass, huffing and vocalizing fearful bursts like being trapped in a nightmare. I tripped and as I preserve my balance through a stumble I found myself standing with a view through Claude's living room window. My heart stopped. There he was, blue in moonlight, sitting in a chair, asleep.

The screaming had stopped. It was dead quiet except for my rapid breathing and the pleasant canopy breeze. I was terrified even to turn around to look back at the castle, fearful the scene like a black hole would engulf me and suck me into itself. I didn't turn, and just ran straight back to my outbuilding, into my bed fully dressed, and with primordial fear covered myself in my blanket. This is what I did.

Somehow I slept, but I only say this because I remember waking up. Claude was already up and outside in the yard, busily wrapping zip-tying a tablecloth to table legs. He saw me peering out.

"Hey!" he called. "We are hosting a theater tonight, come help unfold chairs!"

I don't know how we function after trauma. I don't know what I experienced that previous night. What I do know is that I put on new clothes, and spend the morning eating bread and unfolding chairs. Other people began arriving. Caterers, the actors in the troupe. Claude joyfully interacted with them all.

For me, it was the last time I went into the cellar. Not because I couldn't return with a group if I had wanted. But because I couldn't bring myself to go in there. I was permanently marked by that very real night. 

I've re-read this a few times now, to make sure I've captured what I experienced. I have to say I'm not convinced myself. It seems empty. What really happened that night, in that cellar? Why has this stayed with me all this time and why do I think writing this out is any help to free me of the persistent dread, the recurring nightmares? 

You know, as I re-read this, there's something obvious I missed. I spent two more weeks at the castle, after that night. But Claude never mentioned the hole in the cellar that I'd complained about. We were going to go back down. I must have been so traumatized that I completely forgot. But why didn't *he* mention it to *me*? He rents out that tower room now. There are no photos of the cellar. All the Google reviews are glowing. I have to know.

I'm ending this with these last paragraphs, which I wrote exactly one week after the one above. I called the castle. Claude picked up. His voice is older, more subdued. I forgot a lot of my French but I managed to explain who I was and he remembered me. I began talking about the cellar and my experience, that I just want to put my mind at rest and put this all out there. There was a significant pause after I finished talking. Then he said one thing before hanging up on me without any additions:

"There is no cellar at Chateau de Veuil."

Dial tone.

I started writing this because I wanted to just get it off my chest. But it haunts me again--writing wasn't enough. Instead, I consider this post to be documentation. For posterity, if I can be macabre about it. My heart is racing right now, the same feelings I had under the onslaught of the screams in that cellar. But this time it's because I've just purchased a ticket to Paris. I have to go back. I'll post again in a few days.
