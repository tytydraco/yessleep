This post might seem like I'm being dramatic at first, but you'll get it once I finish. (FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES THIS IS FICTONAL AND NOT MY STORY...) 

This afternoon, my friend who we'll call Jamie, got off of the bus. We decided to hang out. A little background on Jamie and my friendship; we've known eachother for five years. She's like a sister. Anyway, JAmie and I decide to hang out. She walks over to my house. Sitting in my house, my new laptop comes in the mail. I squeal and open it up. After setting it up we decide to burn some cds, because that's what I bought the laptop for. I burn a few cds, one for myself, a few for friends, and one for Jamie. After playing the cds, we make some food. It was pretty good. I guess this incident is my fault, thinking about it now. I tell Jamie that we should gon on a walk. She declines and says that its way too hot outside but we decidde to go on a walk anyway. 

  
when Jamie and I go on walks we always go through the woods near our neighborhood. Walking twoards the woods, I shoot my mom a text, telling her that I'll be home before dark and not to text me because my phone is about to die. With my mom worridly texting mne about staying safe and a phone at 10%, we go into the woods. 

The start of the walk is pretty usual. We find a few epmty vapes and beer bottles. An dead animal or two. We both trip down a few hills, nothing were not used to. Maybe it was annoying, but it was all for the thrill.

Jamie and I make it twoards out destination, the abanondoned barn. Before we get too close to the barn we see a man whos what I can only discribe is whacking rocks with a stick. He's holding a stick and picing at rocks in the water in the creek. Immedeatliy, I start talking loudly to Jamie about all the ways I could hurt someome, how people would look for us, and how I was happy I had gotten my black belt in Karate. I know I seem paranoid but it's better to be safe than sorry. The man starts to walk away so we walk twoards the barn. We reach a bridge, one side having a road and a few houses, the other side having a barn. 

We walk across trhe bridge, going to the barn first. We get to the barn, and as usual it's grown up with leaves and branches. We walk up this big hill to see whats up there, (We never went this far). At the top of the hill was a weird looking house. It looked kinda like the Wheeler Family Home from the show Stranger things. But brick. It sounds odd but that's what it loked like. Later, Jamie walks up further to see past the house and inside of a fence is another barn with eletrical cables running out of it. It was too perfect. Jamie started telling me about how she got yelled at with one of her other friends for 'tresspassing' even though there were no signs. 

We hear a car and already on edge, spring across the bridge. We see a fence and some more trees. There's another road on a hill that we walk twoards. It says no tresspassing, camreas in use. We decide not to go up it but stand outside the gate to catch out breath. We hear the same car noise. We sprint as far as we can...

exiting the bridge and all the hills, we make it back to the creek and the woods.Guess whos there? That man. And honestly, I didn't pay it much mind. 

We are a bit freaked out and need to start heading home anyway. We see the man speed iup and start following us. We run all the way out of the woods. Once we are into the view of people and the subdivision, our nerves calm. Not for long. 

I had the idea to run to one of my friends' aunt's houses if he keeps following. We get to that street and see the man across the field. We wonder how he got there without us seeing him... (we looked back every five seconds lol). 

Here we have no clue what to do. My phone is at 1% and we don't want to use the battery in case we really need it. Standing in the middle of a field, with the man across still playing with sticks, we try to squeeze in between someomes fence and their neighbors fence. The fence looks prettyy wide from a far so we start top run twoards it. Coming closer, it's not wide enough to get thrhough, we keep running along the back of these fences. 

A little backrground, this neighborhood is part of this big subdivisin with 4 other subdiviusons connecting to it. Everyone and everything is connected. Seems nice right? Not when you have a man practically telporting everywhere you run. 

Finally finding a fence to run through, we sprint through the yard, making it onto a road, I know where we are. 

Right when we start walking and see trhe road, we hear the same car noise. What's driving past. The same man on a dirt bike. The man winks at me. He winks... We starting to walk, acting like were not scared. 

So many qiuestions are running though our minds, how did this man cross the two lakes in this field and enter this subdivison within fifteen minutes? If he didn't want us to see him, he would have had to go all the way backwardsd through the woods, which takes at kast an hour... And how did he get a dirt bike? 

One main issue was relevant. 2 miles from my house, dead phone, man on coldesack. If you don't know what a coldesack is, its a roundabout, if you dont know what a roundabout is, its a circle. It's a dead end. A dead end not far from us. This man can outrun us. Jamie and I are starting to question if this is a Truman Show situatiuon or a paranormal one, or if it's just this mans luck. 

We keep seeing people resembeling this man, same shirt, same hair, same this, same that. Not the same man. And honestly? Nothing else happened besides a run home and our wonderings of how that man got two miles on a one way path without us seeing him...
