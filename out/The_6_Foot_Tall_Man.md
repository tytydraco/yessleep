This whole thing that when I think about, still haunts me. If I remember correctly it was the End of December in 2020, Just a few days after Christmas. December 29th, 2019. 2:43 AM. On that night, I went to bed in the Living Room due to me wanting to just sleep by the Christmas tree. I woke up, really expecting to see it be morning and presents under the tree.

But no, just the turned off TV and the Christmas Tree lighting up most the living room and part of the Kitchen. I felt this was different. I felt something. Something dreading like. . It's because I could faintly hear the breathing of someone. I thought it was my Great Grandma (Rest in Peace to her 1947 - July 2023) taking a late night drink of water. But after a few minutes, There were no footsteps leading back to her room. Just breathing and I started to silently panic. Was this a nightmare? Am I dreaming? "God please just let me wake up from this terrible nightmare" It was Reality. And someone or something was only just 10 feet away in the Kitchen. I tried forcing myself to sleep but it never helped, I just panicked more. I just lied there on the couch, not moving a muscle, sinking myself into the couch with the 3 blankets covering me, hoping whatever that thing just leaves and doesn't notice me at all.

5:07 AM, I did something, Something to escape. I left the covers and ran to the kitchen. And I saw a dude. It was a male for sure. His arms on his side and with a white doll mask with black makeup around the eyes and two tall cones on top of his head. Just standing there. I immediately chucked the TV remote and somehow had a good throw and hit the man in the head and booked it to my room and I yelled my great grandma's name "\[ \_ \] there's some person in the house!" and ran into my room, slammed the door shut and that woke my older sister up. I heard something I never wanted to hear.

That man followed me when I wasn't looking and the dude was just knocking on the door, and It was inhumane speed as the knocks went from slow to insanely fast and loud bangs as I figured that the dude was slamming his head on the door. My great grandma was indeed woken up from the pounding and my sisters screaming and she opened her door and it all stopped. She said nothing was there and I came out when I thought it was safe and she woke up her daughter that was downstairs and they both searched the house and outdoors for this dude. We stayed in my room and my grandma eventually after checking the property let me and my sister sleep in her room for the night. I think about this almost every few months.

"What the actual F\*ck was that thing on that night in December of 2019?"
