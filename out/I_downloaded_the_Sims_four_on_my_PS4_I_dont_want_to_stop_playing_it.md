You might look at the title of the story and say just stop playing it but there’s a lot more than that .

Here’s some background I got a PS4 for Christmas and I’ve been browsing some of the games that you can get on it for a while. I found the Sims and I figured out that it was free. I was excited. 

I’ve never played the Sims or anything similar to it before, but when I download it, it asked me if I wanted to watch a tutorial.

I clicked yes because I honestly had no idea what I was doing. It brought me to create a Sim. This creepy demonic sounding voice was talking to me. 

It said the first thing you need to know when you create a SIM is that they die . Well, I already knew that but that was a little bit morbid.

Select what age you want your Sim to die said the creepy robot voice again . I was having a mini panic attack because why would you choose what age you want them to die?

 I chose elder because that seemed the most normal. The daemonic robot voice started speaking again. What caused would you like your Sim to die off.

That was even more weird, but I decided to just take a minute to myself, and then look back at it. The only option was murder. 

That was so weird I said out loud the game was giving me the creeps so I tried to leave it, but then the demonic robot voice spoke again don’t you dare try to leave Evelyn

I scream so loud why did this robot care if I left the game and how did it know my name? I decided to leave the game alone for a while. I came back about two hours later I finally gotten the courage to come back at it.

I design my character, and it was time to choose where I wanted her to live. I just picked some random house in a random neighborhood. 

I disabled the robot voice, so it wouldn’t talk to me anymore The first thing I wanted to learn in the Sims was how to cook so I had her made a make a garden salad, and somehow it caught on fire, even though it was not in the oven at all.

Weirdly the fire department didn’t come and it wouldn’t let me extinguish the fire, her whole house burnt down so I had to get her a new one .

Now, all of this stuff had been pretty weird but that was just a game play not why I didn’t wanna stop playing .
And now a lot of glitches and weird glitches that happened during the game, but this is the one that made me want to turn the whole thing off.

It was about 3:15 AM and she was sleeping when she suddenly woke up. I’ve been playing for a couple days now so I knew that she probably had to go to the bathroom or was hungry so I checked but she wasn’t which also wasn’t that weird because sometimes your symptoms just wake up in the middle of the night until there was someone at her door

I had her open the door, and it was the Grim Reaper, which I had also learned from watching a YouTube video that he came when your Sim was dead.

I found this pretty weird because I only had one Sim and she was obviously alive since she just answered the door

But the Grim Reaper was trying to drag her away, which wasn’t supposed to happen, and then I saw the Grim Reaper kill my SIM. She was only an adult. She wasn’t an elder like it said she would be.

I got really freaked out because I didn’t know what I had done wrong to make her die or what was happening

I hit the main button in the middle of the controller so I could try to play something else but it wouldn’t let me the the daemonic robot. Voice spoke again. Oh I see you’re trying to leave now that’s too bad. The people are already on the way to your house get ready Evelyn Skies walkie

This weird robot no knew my first name and my last name then it quickly said my address I got so freaked out that I turned off the entire consul. I grabbed my keys through my slip flip-flops on and ran out to my car so I can go to my mom’s house.

Things stopped happening after that but when I got home, I saw somebody in a Grim Reaper costume outside my door

I have no idea why this happened to me but if you want any advice, I’d say just don’t do the tutorial at the beginning that’s what did this event gone up from my house for a month now and I have a ring doorbell whoever that person is, hasn’t gone for food hasn’t switched shifts has just stood there for a whole month.

I have to go back to my house now. I’ve stayed in multiple hotel stayed with my mom so if you never hear from me again, you’ll know why.
