  

I was offered a role to work as a scientist by a man who calls himself Sokolov. I know that isn't his real name, he has gone by multiple names before. Mr.Rabbit, Vulcan, and Dennis to name a few. He isn't even the man who runs the experiments, he is just the face of it. Could be anybody funding these things, but that doesn't matter here. What matters here is that Sokolov is the body of an experiment that went horribly wrong. At least, that's what he wants us to think. 

   
 

You see these experiments lasted from to 7/16/22. They ran perfectly fine for a time. They started off with a dozen rabbits that had all they could ever want, food, water, shelter, other healthy mates. But that only lasted for about a week before someone that was instructed by Sokolov or whatever entity that had called upon to act, added another dozen rabbits. This repetition went on for a month. But then they stopped when the rabbits turned on each other. 

   
 

At first they would just show a hint of a aggression to another to express dominance I guess. But slowly it escalated. Scratches turned to bites, and injuries turned to murders. From the moment a dozen Xenos were added, they started to hate. And their hate was fueled. They had everything, yet they fought like they had nothing. But when word spread that the rabbits were quickly dying of themselves, and Sokolov told someone else to do something rather odd at first. 

   
 

He instructed them to purge all but a couple dozen rabbits with flame. To ration the food and water for the rabbits so that only the amount needed was given. To rid the rabbits of all their shelter. To sterilize the dozen rabbits that were left. To add a couple pregnant cockroaches into the habitat of the rabbits. And so, the purge was delivered. This was acted on the afternoon of 7/11/22. And so, I was there to watch, as the rabbits screamed from the hellfire that was administered slowly from a blowtorch that was handled by a complete stranger to me. 

   
 

The burned corpses were carried away to a unknown land, to never be viewed again in the state they were once seen as. The smell of burnt fur still lingered as we worked on 7/12/22. They added a few of the vermin inside of the enclosure. The pillagers proceeded to steal the limited resources of the rabbits, making them anxious as ever. Though, something was rather odd. Sokolov ordered a eradication of the vermin on the 7/14/22. 

   
 

For the longest time I thought they were just torturing the mammals, why help them? But soon the lives of the cockroaches were dismembered, saving the rabbits from anymore plague or famish. For the last 2 days of the experiment the last dozen rabbits were at peace. They were given resources a plenty, and the rain never stopped them from mating. For once and last, they were happy. 

   
 

The late afternoon of 7/16/22, they came into view of the lab. The lab surrounded the enclosure of the rabbits, with glass encasing them. The top of their habitat was fully open, leading to the air being somewhat moist from the harsh rain. The ones who came from the hallway of the lab were wearing swat team uniforms and faces so malicious that I could see them from behind their masks. The malice from when I saw Sokolov order the flame couldn't even hold a light to them. Their yells were a mixture of words that I hoped were " DOWN TO THE GROUND, NOW! ". 

   
 

Any disorder on the conduct they had commanded just now would surely end my entire view of reality. And so, I dropped under a table, hoping whatever team had sent them was on our side. Though sides don't really exist here. Only people who help you, and people who don't. In my mind I prayed that they would be gone. Everything was pretty much a spur. But from what I could recall, was them running out of the lab and into the location of Sokolov's office. Gunshots emerged, making every muscle in me flinch. 

   
 

And as quickly as they entered my life, they exited. Peacefully, they went out the exit and to somewhere I shouldn't ever have knowledge of. All of us in the lab got up, hoping that they had no intentions of returning. We were lucky they never did. When the others ran away from this location of damnation, I turned. Turned to the office of Sokolov. For some reason I don't understand, I stumbled into the hallway leading there. Soon enough I was there, the office of the body. Blood soaked the walls and some of the floor. I wished I didn't see the body. I wished I wasn't so idiotic as to infest a room of what was danger moments before. As I looked in horror, gunshots riddled the corpse of sokolov. 

   
 

His image can't be removed from my brain. The detail of which I cannot describe but the broad strokes honor the fear in me. Trying not to regurgitate the food in me, I approached. I now know why I went there. To find answers. This experiment seemed so simple, yet it was hidden from everybody else and caused the death of whom had a part in it. I didn't pick and choose what papers fell into my hands, I just picked at random. In almost the blink of oneâ€™s eye, I was home. The night raided my household, yet the darkness couldn't stop me from reading everything I had pillaged. 

   
 

I wasn't chosen because I was special or a good scientist. I was chosen because I was nobody. Look at me, a debt filled 20 something man with no family or friends uploading to a reddit horror sub, would anybody believe or.... I fear, even care? Sokolov wasn't anybody either, he was just a puppet for the network of our government to use, but he made a mistake for which I have also committed. He dismayed orders, he had given the rabbits peace. Though in doing so, he had severely helped the network. These documents have told me something. Something of which I cannot deal anything about. This experiment was for the idea of making a utopia within our world. This isn't a government or a subspace of them. Not anymore. Nothing I could say would put into words what this entails. Just know that soon. The purge of the Vulcan god will commence.
