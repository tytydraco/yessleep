Hello Reddit,

It’s been a couple weeks since my last post, I apologize for not keeping you guys updated. I will give the reason for my inactivity at the end of this post.

To those of you who’ve messaged me here and on Facebook, I’m sorry for not responding; this post should give all the answers you need.

I know I said in my last post that there were no more entries to transcribe, but I actually have one more to post here.

This entry is very questionable for me, and you’ll see why in a moment, so please just bear with me as I explain my thought process in making this post.

This whole ordeal with my son has taken me out of the flow for the most part. It’s been difficult for me to focus at work and maintain my daily habits/routines. One of those habits that I’ve been neglecting is checking my email.

Last week, I decided to sit down and go through some unread emails for work. After I finished going through all of them, I noticed I still had three more notifications, and they were coming from my personal email. I don’t have any subscriptions or social media accounts linked to my personal email, so it doesn’t get much action at all. I would only use it for communicating with close friends and family, but that was more before texting became the primary form of communication. The emails were all from an unknown sender and had no subject. All three were sent on December 21st between 4AM and 7AM, which is the morning following the night my son fell into a coma.

The first two emails were short and very confusing, but the third one was really long. When I opened the third email, it quickly became clear to me what it was. It was a pre-transcribed dream journal entry, entry #46 to be exact.

After reading the entry, it was clearly “staged” to be written by my son. I use the word “staged” because there’s no way he could have written it.

According to the doctors, my son was already in a coma approximately 8 hours before I got him into the hospital around 11AM, which would mean his coma began around 3AM. Additionally, I came home and found him unresponsive in bed at around 8:30AM, so the emails being sent in the early morning hours would make no sense at all. My son was definitely in bed at that time. I told myself all this just so I could write this email off as some kind of prank or scam.

Also, I think you’ll realize when you read the entry why I didn’t want to believe my son had written it.

However, too many things just didn’t add up.

The most glaring issue being that these emails were sent before I did any posts on reddit or Facebook. In fact, they were sent before anybody, the doctors and I included, knew about my son’s condition, so how could anyone know how to forge them and send them to me?

Second, the only people who know my personal email are my close friends and family. I haven’t clicked on any suspicious links when logged into my personal email that could’ve gotten me hacked, and the email didn't contain any links or requests for my information, so it isn’t likely to be a scam.

And third, the content of the emails is continuous with my son's previous journal entries, and the way it’s written actually sounds like him.

The only other explanation would be that the doctors were wrong, and his coma actually began way later, and that my son, for whatever reason, got out of bed to write me these emails, then went back to bed to then fall into a coma. Obviously, that would be ridiculous, if my son wanted to tell me something, he would've waited for me to get home so he could tell me in person.

Despite all of this, I was able to ignore the email for a couple of days until something happened that I will mention at the end of this post. Since said incident, the email has been driving me insane, and I decided I just needed to post it here to see if any of you have any explanations.

I did my own research and found that emails CAN have fake dates, but that is usually in relation to scam emails, which I already said isn’t likely to be the case. I thought maybe one of you guys who’ve read my previous posts forged it and sent it with a fake date, but then again, that’s not very easy to do, and also, how would any of you guys know my personal email?

Anyways, here are the emails, if any of you can explain this, please come forward.

\*\*\*

**12/21/24 Wake Me Up (sent at 4:04AM)**

Dad, if you’re reading this I need to be woken up. I am so far away from my body now, that I don’t think shaking me will work. I know that probably doesn’t make any sense to you, but you can read my dream journal later and you’ll understand everything, you can find it under my pillow. I’m gonna try to wake myself up, but if I can’t, I need you to find a way to do it for me. I am not safe; I am in danger. PLEASE HURRY!!!

**12/21/24 Re:Wake Me Up (sent at 4:49AM)**

Dad, if you’ve tried waking me up and it didn’t work, here’s some important information.

I was in a lucid dream but now I’m stuck, and I can’t wake up.

I don’t fully know what’s going on, I think I might’ve accidentally entered some kind of dimension or alternate reality. I can’t really explain how I know that; I just need you to believe me.

I have no idea if you’re even receiving these emails, I’m just trying out everything I can. In this dream, I’m currently stuck inside the old house. I’m thinking of sending another email after this one explaining how I got here, but idk if I’ll have time for that. I found my old laptop inside my old room, and that’s how I’m sending these. I doubt it will do anything, but if you’re reading this right now, it’s proof that this world I’m in has SOME connection to reality.

Read my dream journal and go to the most recent entry. I went behind the brown door again, but now I can’t get back to my body. Go on reddit and quora and search up “sleep paralysis door with golden doorknob” or “sleep paralysis brown door,” and you should find some threads about the same door I talk about in my most recent journal entry. They’re old threads so you’ll have to scroll for a while, but that’s the only place I could find any info on everything that’s been happening to me. It’s your best bet on finding a way to wake me up.

I am still not safe, and I don’t know how much longer I have. I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me, all that I ask is that you please find a way to wake me up.

**12/21/24 Re:Wake Me Up - Entry #46 (Sent at 7:10AM)**

I’ve been thinking of ways to try and get back to my body, and I have a few ideas but they’re all very risky. At some point I’m gonna have to leave this room, but I just keep hesitating because I’m scared.

Like I said before, I have no idea whether or not you’re getting these emails, so I can’t count on waiting until you get back to read these and know what’s happened to me.

I’m thinking I will try to leave this room and get to my body around the time you said you’d be home, so if you shake me, maybe it'll wake me up since I’ll be closer to my body. It seemed to work the last time I entered the cave, so I think it’s my best bet. It’s the best plan I could come up with, so it’s probably what I’m gonna do.

However, it’s still 5AM so you won’t be home for another few hours.

I decided while I’m waiting, I would write out how I got stuck here and send it to you. I have already been in this room for over an hour, and nothing has happened. I have a lot of time till you get home, and since this will be my last email, I’m gonna write it out in as much detail as possible. I want you to understand my entire thought process up to this point, and I honestly just want to do anything but leave this room.

My entry starts here…

I did FILD, and it worked again, I got sleep paralysis. I did SPILD with no problem and stepped away from my body.

I was preparing myself all day for this moment; I was nervous, but I was ready. I didn’t wanna hesitate like I did yesterday, so I immediately thought of mom, and the brown door appeared.

Still there was no swing set noise.

I inhaled to see if I could pick up any smell of gasoline, but there was none, I was in the clear.

My adrenaline started pumping as I reached for the handle. I was thinking,

“From the moment I open this door, the danger begins, so be prepared for anything”.

I took a deep breath, twisted the handle and swung the door open hard. I stared into the blackness once again and tried my hardest not to psych myself out.

I then (very stupidly) told myself not to think too much and to just step forward.

The second I did that I realized I made a huge mistake.

I was so focused on not chickening out that I didn’t even think to give myself a flashlight before entering the cave. I forgot that once I enter the door, I don’t have any power to alter the dream anymore.

I quickly turned back around to try and step back into my bedroom, but it wouldn’t let me. It was exactly what I was afraid of, every time I tried to move toward the doorway, it would move away from me. No matter how fast I would try to step through the frame, it would move backward and dodge me at the same speed. It even seemed like the more I tried, the further the door would get from me.

I was forced to give up, I was trapped inside the cave again.

I stood there in my pajamas in complete darkness, cursing at myself for being so stupid.

I could’ve given myself more than just a flashlight, I could’ve had a weapon or some kind of armor to protect myself, but now I had nothing.

Already I wanted to bail on this dream, to me it was already a failed attempt.

There was nothing I could do though because the doorway was keeping me from getting back to my body and waking myself up. If I wanted to be woken up, I’d have to wait till dad got home in the morning.

“No no I’ll be fine”

I told myself.

“If something goes horribly wrong, and I die, the dream will end and I’ll wake up”.

I shuddered at the thought of being killed in a dream that already felt so realistic, but I told myself I’d be okay and that it’s just a dream.

However, some small part of me deep down didn’t believe that.

From the moment I let that thought enter my mind, a wave of other horrible thoughts flooded in. Thoughts of being chased by the demon again, thoughts of it catching me, thoughts of what it might do to hurt me, thoughts of me not ever waking up.

I sat down on the ground and seriously considered sitting there until morning when dad would wake me up. But then I got a hold of myself, and I told myself I was being ridiculous.

I decided to think about the next morning, the sun rising, the blue sky, my room being lit with sunlight, dad coming home, and us having breakfast together in the kitchen. I told myself that everything was gonna be okay, and that this was just a nightmare. I told myself I was just being negative because I forgot a flashlight, but there was still a good chance I could find mom.

I stood back up on my feet and focused on my breathing. I put my back to the wall and began shuffling forward slowly. With every step I whispered out loud,

“it’s just a dream, you’ll be fine”.

The further I got from my bedroom doorway the darker it became. It got to the point where I couldn’t even see my hand waving in front of my face.

I was so scared I actually had to keep reminding myself to inhale. There was nowhere else for me to go though, there was nothing else for me to do then to look for mom.

My eyes were wide open like they were trying their hardest to adjust to the darkness, but it was impossible. There was no way I could see anything in this cave.

However, with my vision taken out, my other senses were heightened.

I was especially paying attention to my sense of smell. If I picked up even a hint of gasoline in the air, I was gonna turn around and run. All I could smell was the smell of dirt and rocks. I kept picking up this other nasty smell too, but it was very faint.

I probably wouldn’t have noticed it if I had a flashlight. It smelled kinda like grandma's fridge when I had to throw out all her expired food, but also kinda fishy, and also a little bit like an outhouse. The smell was very faint, and it would come and go, but it was gross.

Eventually I went nose blind to it, and I couldn’t really smell anything anymore.

After a few minutes of shuffling forward, I saw something encouraging. Way down the cave, I could see a faint light. The light was dim enough that I definitely wouldn’t have noticed it if I had a flashlight.

I wanted to get out of the darkness so bad that I started to move very quickly. Paying very close attention to my sense of smell, I broke out into a slow run toward the light.

The closer I got, the more uneasy I felt. I was getting further and further away from my body, and I didn’t like that.

When I reached the light and saw where it was coming from, my jaw dropped.

The cave opened up into a cavern, and just barely crammed into the middle of it was my old house. The lights on the inside were on and were shining through the windows. I was very confused, but I figured there was no point in questioning it.

I felt a very odd sense of familiarity when looking at it, and I felt safe to approach it for some reason.

The front door was unlocked, so I walked inside.

I could smell that nasty smell from earlier, but it was stronger this time. It was a little off putting, but I tried to ignore it.

I looked around the house, and once again, I was impressed by the level of detail I was seeing. It was perfect, and I mean perfect, it looked exactly like my old house before we moved.

Nostalgia started to take over, and I let my guard down.

Normally, when I have a dream about the old house, it doesn’t really look right. Like, usually some counters are the wrong height or the couches are in the wrong places, but this was like a replica. I even noticed some details about the house that I’d completely forgotten about. I mean it’s been years, so it makes sense that I’d forget some things. But if I forgot them, how could they appear here in my dream?

I was very confused, but also very impressed.

I walked over to the junk drawer and opened it, and sure enough, the flashlight was in there. I pulled it out but my hands were still shaking, and it slipped out of my hand. I tried catching it rlly fast, but my hand hit it and sent it flying across the room where it hit a picture frame which fell and shattered on the floor.

Adrenaline shot through my system. My body went hot then cold again. The sound was so loud that all the nostalgia left my system and was replaced with horror.

If the demon was anywhere nearby, it knew where I was now.

I heard something move upstairs. On instinct, I went to hide in the pantry. I listened carefully, but I didn’t hear any sounds of doors opening or anybody coming down the stairs.

I left the pantry, picked up the flashlight, and very slowly approached the stairs. I heard the same sound upstairs again, like somebody moving around, it was coming from behind mom’s bedroom door. I wasn’t being chased; I thought maybe it was her.

I called out to her hoping to hear her voice in return.

It was silent for a second,

but then I heard her voice calling my name very weakly from behind her bedroom door.

I ran up the stairs and down the hall to her door, and I swung it open.

Immediately I was hit with the worst smell I had ever smelled in my life. I backed away from the door coughing and gagging. It was the same smell from earlier, but it was much stronger now.

The lights in the room were off. I pulled my shirt over my nose and shined the flashlight through the doorway.

I could see that the light switch wasn’t on the wall where it was supposed to be, it was just gone.

With my nose covered, the smell was just bearable, so I entered the room.

I kept calling out for mom asking where she was, but she wasn’t responding. I heard the sound of shuffling coming from the other side of the bed. I jerked around and shined my flashlight on the bed and called out to her again.

It was silent.

I dont know what was making those noises, but I quickly backed away and accidentally bumped into something soft.

I screamed and fell to the floor. When I looked up to see what I bumped into, I screamed again but more horribly.

The sound of the swing set echoed around the room as I attempted to get a hold of myself.

What I saw was the head and torso of a human body hanging from two hooks attached at the armpits. The hooks were on a chain that was attached to the ceiling, and they were moving back and forth making that same metal creaking sound that I used to hear from behind the brown door. The body I was looking at was barely recognizable as a human body, let alone man or woman. The arms were severed at the forearm and the legs at the knee. There was a huge brownish red stain on the carpet underneath the person, which was where the smell was the strongest. Around the entire body, including the face, all the skin had been removed. The torso was ripped open exposing the ribcage and all the internal organs. Everything looked leathery, but not very decayed, It looked like they had died somewhat recently. There was bloody cloth stuffed into the mouth, and in each of the different exposed organs were shiny pins poking out like some kind of insect display. With the skin removed, the eyes were bulging out of their sockets, but I couldn’t look for too long.

In the background, I saw other more decayed bodies hanging in a similar fashion, but I got very lightheaded, and my vision clouded. I hunched over and vomited all over the floor. The way my sides squeezed, and my nose burned felt all too real to be a dream.

Just when I thought I was gonna faint, I heard mom call out my name from across the room.

All of my senses returned to me, and I shined my flashlight at where I heard her. There she was, lying on the ground looking battered and weak.

Tears welled up in my eyes, and I rushed to her side. I told her about how I’d been searching for her and about how glad I was to finally see her.

She gave no response except putting her arm around my shoulder.

I helped her to her feet, her body felt limp and broken. There was blood around her eyes and mouth, and her face looked sunken in. She also seemed to be missing skin in random areas like on her wrists and neck.

I asked her if she was okay and about what happened to her face; but again, she gave no response. She seemed to be in too much pain to speak. I didn’t wanna force her to answer my questions, so I told her we could talk about it after I get her out of the cave and that everything would be alright.

I helped walk her out of the room, and I shut the door behind me. Once I left the room, the smell of decay was gone, but now I could smell something else.

It was the smell of gasoline, and it was strong. The demon was nearby.

I tried to lower mom to the floor so I could be prepared to fight, but she wouldn’t let me go. I tried explaining to her that something bad was coming but she grabbed me even tighter.

I had to pry her fingers off of me, and when I tried to set her down, I realized I didn’t need to. She was able to stand perfectly fine on her own. She didn’t look hunched over or in pain at all, she was standing tall and straight.

I had my back to the room we just came out of, and she was standing in front of me blocking the hallway. I tried to step past her so she could stand behind me, but she didn’t move out of the way.

I asked her if she had seen a demon with a white face.

She nodded.

I asked her how long ago she saw it and where.

She raised her arm and pointed behind me at the room we just left.

I turned around and looked at the door.

“In the room we just came out of?”

I asked.

She responded with one word.

“Yes”.

Hearing her up this close I noticed something that sent a chill up my spine. It didn’t sound like mom at all. What I heard sounded more like some grown man trying to impersonate mom’s voice.

I couldn’t hide my suspicion, and I turned to look at her face.

I understood now why it looked so sunken in, why there was blood coming from around her mouth and eyes, and why she was missing skin in certain places. I felt the blood leave my face, and I was breathless. I mouthed at words trying to say something, but all that came out was

“Mom?” 

It gave no response, and it moved weirdly toward me. I took a step back, but my back hit the closed door. I was cornered.

On instinct, I ran forward to shove it to the ground; but when I pushed it, my hands felt almost no resistance. It folded and collapsed to the floor completely limp, it was just a pile of skin and clothes now. I choked on my breath trying to comprehend what I just saw. I didn’t have much time to think though, the pile of skin was bulging and squirming. Out of the mouth, eyes, neck, and wrists, long black hair was pushing its way out from under the skin. The demon was coming out, and I was still cornered. I turned around, opened the door, and ran back into the room. I shut the door behind me and hid under the bed.

I heard the door open back up. I couldn’t see anything, I just had to wait. I tried to listen, but the chains were still creaking loudly. The smell was awful, I had to keep my nose covered.

I shut my eyes and tried my hardest to wake myself up. I imagined myself in my bed in my room, and I told myself when I opened my eyes, I’d be awake. It didn’t work. I tried flexing my body as hard as I could, but that didn’t work either. I was stuck, there was no waking up.

I waited for minutes until the chains stopped moving. When it finally did, I waited an extra minute to try and hear anything. It was silent.

I crawled out from under the bed trying to be as quiet as possible. I had to come up with what to do now.

I knew if I tried to run back through the cave back to my doorway, it would just move away from me, and I’d get caught before I’d ever reach it.

I decided to lock myself in the room and think of a solution. I walked over and put my hand on the lock, but something told me to check the room first. I looked over my shoulder and quickly shined the flashlight around the whole room.

As my flashlight passed over the dresser though, I got a quick glimpse of a white face duck out of view behind it.

I felt the air leave my lungs, I thought it was gonna jump out and attack me, but it didn’t.

"Did it think it was hidden? Was it waiting for me to go over there?"

I opened the door, turned the lock, then ran out and shut it.

I ran into my own old bedroom and locked myself inside.

I didn’t know what else to do, if I tried to run, I’d get caught. I went around the room trying to find something I could use as a weapon. I found my old wooden sword and decided that it was the best I had.

I stood in front of the locked door, waiting for the attack. My entire body was shaking, and my muscles felt weak.

I heard it approach the door. The doorknob turned slowly, then stopped. It knew the door was locked; it knew I was in there. I adjusted myself, preparing for it to break the door down, but it was quiet.

Seconds turned into minutes, and nothing happened. I wasn’t gonna let my guard down though, I knew it was waiting for me to relax.

After about an hour passed of nothing happening, I crouched to check if I could see its shadow under the door. There was nothing there, it wasn’t outside my door anymore.

I finally took my attention off the locked door and started looking for things that could possibly help me.

I was able to find my old laptop under the bed. I opened it and was surprised when it turned on. The first thing I did was send you those 2 previous emails. When I first got on the laptop it had full battery, but now it only has 8 minutes of battery life left so I need to wrap this up.

I’ve been in this room for about 4 hours total now, and nothing has happened. Typing this out took so long that it’s almost 7AM now.

I thought writing this out would help me relax and feel better, but I feel much worse. It's almost time for you to come home, which means it's almost time for me to leave this room. There's nothing left to distract myself now.

I’m so far from my body that even if you shake me, I don’t think It’ll wake me up. I need to be closer to my body. I’m gonna try and get back closer to it, so I will have to leave this room soon.

I have a weird feeling about this world I’m stuck in, it’s definitely more than just a dream. I mentioned in my previous email that I’m stuck in a dimension or something, I can explain now why I say that.

This dimension, or domain, or whatever I’m in seems to have some kind of basis in reality. Everything is more detailed than a normal dream; everything feels too real. I have no power to control reality like I normally do in a lucid dream. Also this world seems to exist in real time as well. I think my elbow hurt all day today because I banged it in the cave last night. I have no idea how it works, but I know that this is real somehow.

I convinced myself that it was just a dream, but deep down I knew it wasn’t true, I just wanted to believe I could help mom.

I’m gonna send this as my last reply to my previous 2 emails, and I can only hope it reaches you. If I’m right about this world having some strange connection to reality, then you should receive it; at least, that’s my theory.

I’m gonna try and get back to my body soon, but if you’re reading this, that means I didn’t make it. In that case, I need you to find a way to wake me up as soon as possible.

Read my dream journal if you haven’t already, go to the threads I mentioned and search for any kind of info that can help.

Just thinking about leaving this room terrifies me. I’m scared, and I need you to please believe everything I’ve written. You’re the only one who can help me, so please dad, please do everything you can to wake me up.

\*\*\*

 

That’s the entire entry, there was nothing else written after that. If any of you guys forged that, I need to know right now. If none of you guys forged it, I need you all to know what I’m dealing with.

About the incident I mentioned before, if you remember, I said I’d tell you the thing that happened that was the reason for my inactivity.

The truth is my son died 5 days after my last post. Since then, I haven’t been sleeping well. And I wanna believe it’s because of the sleep deprivation, but I got sleep paralysis for the first time in my life the other day. Thanks to my son’s entries, I knew not to panic; that is, until I got a good look around my room. While I was paralyzed, I saw a brown door with a golden doorknob, and I heard my son’s voice calling out to me from behind it.
