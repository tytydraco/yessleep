It’s ironic— even knowing everything that’s going to happen, I still don’t know how to fix this. And in fact, there’s a reason I’m writing here: I want to recruit all hunters of the supernatural, because I need advice on how I can get out of this. I remember having been an ally to multiple hunters of supernatural things, but honestly, my contacts are fewer and fewer. Those who try to help me have had to face the consequences—some have died, others are trapped fighting in their own loops. The few contacts I have left know my situation well, and therefore have kept their distance from me. They’ve walked away, and truthfully, I don’t blame them. I would too.

Surely you’ve heard of stories where there was some kind of time travel. The most famous is the case of a tourist plane that took off in the 1950s and vanished without a trace. For months, the FBI and every U.S. organization available carried out exhaustive searches, only to leave the families and the Bureau itself with the mystery: What really happened? Was it a Soviet attack during the Cold War? A crash into the ocean? Alien abduction? And then, shockingly, 30 years later, in 1985, it reappeared completely intact, landing at an airport as if nothing had happened—its passengers showing no signs of aging whatsoever.

But in reality, it’s not that hard to understand—at least if explained simply, which is what I’m going to do. Because I don’t think it helps to reveal the full details of what really happens when this occurs. That was the first recorded case where government organizations took the situation seriously. It was a case that terrified the entire world, but in fact, there are thousands more that never came to light—either because they were less known, or because the FBI made sure to keep them hidden.

This type of supernatural phenomenon came to be called “TTP” for short: Temporal Teleportation Phenomenon.

Why does this happen? It turns out that, unlike what great masterminds like Einstein and other physicists theorized, time travel is actually relatively simple. The hard part is finding where. That’s because there are “potholes” in reality—places where reality itself is altered. Later it was discovered that these places don’t remain open forever, nor do they appear on their own. There are different ways to create a temporal pothole: a space where reality begins to fail, a place where at the very least you can move from one place to another in seconds, and at most you can achieve astonishing things, such as traveling through time or even across the multiverse—though the latter is far more difficult.

Now then, creating a TTP is no simple task. In fact, it has always been easier to find one already formed at the perfect moment to use it, rather than trying to make one. To begin with, there’s an entire historical context behind this situation that’s worth telling.

Just like the atomic bomb, everything is a chain reaction. After having won the war with the help of the nuclear bomb, WWII had ended, but the Cold War was just beginning. Moreover, entire countries around the world were devastated. Meanwhile, the United States prepared every day for a possible Soviet invasion, but they knew the Russians would also have weapons as powerful as the atomic bomb. They knew they had to surpass them by far with a master plan—an experiment more successful than all the failed projects before, like super soldiers and brainwashing.

Thus, with the help of several physicists who had actually been the same ones who helped create the atomic bomb, they set themselves a new challenge: to create an artificial sun, small but powerful enough to kill almost instantly, and form a pocket-sized black hole. All of this was contained in a magnetic chamber, which needless to say cost over 8 billion dollars, and achieving it was no simple task, taking several years and numerous failed attempts.

The thing is, they didn’t need just one, but two black holes, very close to each other. With the help of “exotic matter,” one could be turned into a white hole. According to physics, exotic matter can be found in places with extremely high temperatures, something that also cost hundreds of millions of dollars to achieve. It was truly an extremely complex process that took decades of sleepless work and billions of dollars invested.

In short: they created two black holes, converted one into a white hole, both contained in a magnetic chamber worth hundreds of millions of dollars, made them collide—and there it was, they created the wormhole. During this period, the allied superpowers and the United States itself planned to travel to the past to prevent all the consequences of WWII, while at the same time seeking to travel to the future to see who would have the upper hand in the Cold War.

However, they began this entire time travel project in 1950, but in 1954 a catastrophic reaction occurred. The laboratory in which they had invested so much was largely destroyed, and the black hole was released. Since the magnetic chamber, despite being broken, continued transmitting containment energy, it managed to stabilize the black hole and shut it down—not without causing one of the worst mistakes: its energy expanded across the entire world, like a meteor colliding and spreading an explosion across the globe. Yes, that’s how it happened—this is how the famous TTPs were born: phenomena where people, ships, or planes disappear from one point to reappear years, or even decades, later.

By the time I became a government agent with a good reputation, around the age of 37, they decided it was time for me to handle confidential material. I imagined it would be everyday office matters, secrets about the Twin Towers, or spies in Taliban facilities. I never imagined what a superpower was capable of achieving.

To avoid explaining too much, they detailed everything about the TTPs and their history. I was amazed. I had to rely on my professionalism to avoid asking too many questions and focus on what they asked of me.

It turns out that after half a century, the government had found a geographic area where the expansion of artificial black holes had filled hundreds of probable locations for possible TTPs. By these days, they already had radars capable of detecting such gaps in reality. Depending on the area closest to where the black hole exploded, that’s where TTPs last the longest. That is, if someone is hundreds of kilometers away from the site of the black hole’s expansion, these time gaps don’t last more than about 27 years (yes, unfortunately that’s the minimum), and then they disappear so people can pass through safely without vanishing.

However, if a person is relatively close to the site of the black hole’s explosion, there’s a higher chance they could experience a TTP and disappear for years or even decades.

The issue was that my supervisors were very concerned for the following reason:

It had been a long time since any TTP had been detected, but at the beginning of this month, multiple disappearances were reported in a forest near a county in the United States. The possibility of bears was ruled out, since the bodies would have appeared torn apart. Suicide didn’t seem feasible either, and the idea of a serial killer prowling the area was also speculated and dismissed, as there was nothing—no clues indicating the disappearance of 11 people in a single day.

Yes, that was the case: 11 people had disappeared over the span of 7 hours. What was disturbing was that these people had no connection, and weren’t even together. Each was within a radius of 3 to 11 kilometers from the others, so the idea that they were family had already been rejected. Their relatives were crying over their missing loved ones, but now we were under a lot of pressure from someone else.

The daughter of an important state politician, a 9-year-old girl, had gone missing in that forest. According to the report, the girl started climbing a very tall and thick tree while her father was distracted, grilling meat with the family. When he turned his head, the girl was already high up in the tree. The father immediately dropped the grill spatula and ordered his daughter to come down, but the girl, surprised by her physical ability, kept climbing. The father got agitated and ran to the tree, starting to climb it as well, with more difficulty. He says he carefully checked where he placed his hands to avoid being bitten by ants or cut by a sharp branch. When he took the next step and looked up, the girl was gone. He screamed as loud as he could but received no response.

He called his eldest son, around 23 years old, to climb the tree in search of the girl. His son obeyed, but when he reached the top, the little girl wasn’t there. They searched for 40 minutes around the forest near the tree, and even further away, thinking the girl might have fallen and walked in search of her family—but still, they didn’t find her.

Soon, firefighters arrived and searched for the girl for 17 hours, but never found anything. The police also assisted along with the county sheriff, but they too never found the little girl.

Being part of the 11 disappearances that took place throughout the day, and given that the girl’s case was extremely strange, my superiors suspected it could be a TTP. What was unusual, however, was that it occurred at a reasonably long distance from where TTPs usually appear. Still, my supervisors requested my help. Having absorbed everything that could be real, and knowing that this was no longer science fiction, I decided to accept.
