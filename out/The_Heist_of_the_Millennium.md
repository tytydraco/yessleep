

You ever fuckin walked into a place and felt your soul twitch?

Not from guilt. From… recognition. Like some part of you knows what’s coming—and it’s gonna hurt like hell.

That’s how this one started.

“Okay, look in my eyes, this is important, babe.” I put my hands on her cheeks and gently grazed her soft skin. “I need you to do me a favor.” I continued, “Let me do the talking, and you do the stabby stabby…. Deal?” She huffed, “Blah, blah, blah, you never let me do the cool hero speech.” I laughed and kissed her forehead. I also reminded myself to ask how in the fuckin hell she gets her skin so soft. She’s a fuckin demon…

Anyways…

They called it ‘The Gilded Rot,’ a place too pristine to be anything but cursed. A gilded ballroom carved into the ribs of a dead god, chandeliers made of screaming teeth, and blood-red velvet draped over bones like sin trying to dress up as something elegant.

An Invitation-only event. A soul auction.

Not metaphorical. Literal. Bottled. Branded. Broken. Sold to the highest bidder in the language of screams and infernal coin.

Me and Vespyr? We walked in dressed to kill and high on menace.

She looked like the end of the world in black lace and a million fucking years of fury. I couldn’t hardly keep my eyes off of her. Me? Leather and runes, one boot already soaked in the blood of the last asshole who tried to frisk me.

We didn’t come to buy.

We came to burn it down.

The crowd was full of the worst Hell had to offer—warlocks who traded blood for influence, demons so old they creaked when they smiled, even a fallen archangel whose halo now burned black. The archangel, he was a piece of shit, worst kind of angel trash. If I had my way, I’d torture him for centuries. He ain’t the focus. We had our eyes on something else. 

The centerpiece…

Lot 666.

A child’s soul. Still glowing. Still warm.

Vespyr flinched when they wheeled it out—tied in ethereal chains, whispering for its mother in a voice only the damned could hear. I pulled her close, “It’s okay, you’re gonna fuckin liberate these poor souls my, ‘Demonic Death Machine.’

The room started bidding. One offered a thousand years of torment. Another raised with a collapsed star in a jar.

I raised a finger. The room went still.

“I bid, Five whole minutes of me,” I said.

The auctioneer laughed, until my smirk dropped.

“Final God damned bid, my sweet girl is gonna rip your throats out,” I added, walking up to the podium. “Because, when she's done, no one here’s gonna want what’s left.”

Speaking of the auctioneer… 

She called herself Madame Sorrow, like naming yourself after the thing you sell makes you somehow untouchable. Silk gloves. Hollow eyes. Voice like stained glass cracking.

“Fucking smug bitch, always hated her kind…” Vespyr mumbled to no one. I patted her ass as I walked by.

As soon as I stepped up to the podium, she tried to play diplomat.

“I assure you, sir, we have policies—”

I grabbed her throat mid-sentence. That voice? Didn’t sound so elegant when I crushed it into a gargled croak.

“Policy this,” I growled, and slammed her head into the soul pedestal.

It cracked—both her skull and the pedestal.

The bottled soul slipped loose. It hovered in the air like a moth just waking up from a nightmare. I gave it a nod. “Go on, kid. You’re free.”

It vanished in a shimmer of light.

Madame Sorrow tried to stand. I stepped on her ankle and snapped it sideways.

“No refunds,” I whispered, and walked through the smoke as she screamed.

That’s when the panic started.

Someone recognized me. Probably the bastard I shoved down a well a century back. Listen, in my defense, he was a fuckin prick… he deserved it. He’s lucky I didn’t end him that night. 

Mr. Asshole Angel was next…

He called himself, ‘Thrael,’ Pretty name. Ugly purpose.

He’d been a prince once—back when Heaven still wore crowns. Now his wings were blackened bones, and he sold salvation like a weapon.

“You’re interfering with divine reclamation,” he said, sword drawn, eyes blazing.

I looked at the blade.

Then I laughed.

“Cute toy. Let me show you mine.”

I pulled out my dual daggers and they glowed green, just like my baby girl’s eyes. She had these things forged with her own blood. That taste is forever on my tongue. Those daggers… my most prized weapons.

I flexed my hand and let the runes flare across my skin—glowing sigils cut in rage and sealed in blood. The sword met my forearm and shattered like glass.

“Divine, huh?” I said, stepping close enough he could smell the brimstone on my breath. “That why you buy souls like a junkie with a God complex?”

He lunged. I headbutted him so hard his wings twisted backward like broken coat hangers.

He stumbled. I grabbed the remnants of his own sword, jammed it through his knee, and pinned him to the floor.

“Tell Heaven I said *fuck off*,” I spat.

Then Vespyr dropped from the rafters behind him, and with one graceful arc of her blade, turned the rest of him into celestial mulch.

Weapons were drawn. Spells were screamed. The whole room turned into a massacre symphony.

They were warlocks, necromancers, demonic heiresses and a few things I couldn’t even pronounce.

One tried to bribe me mid-massacre.

“I can double your offer!” he shrieked, throwing a handful of flayed gold.

I caught it, sniffed it, and tossed it back. “You think I kill for coin, asshole?”

Another one tried to teleport away.

Vespyr threw her blade and caught his jaw mid-spell. The portal fizzled out—his body hit the floor twitching, eyes wide and jawbone missing.

The last was a demon noble, seven feet of teeth and fur, hiding behind a wall of summoned flame.

I walked through the fire.

“Nice try,” I said, brushing off the cinders. “You forgot who you’re dealing with.”

Vespyr threw her hidden blade and caught the snooty fucker’s right in the jugular.

Then I punched through his ribcage and pulled out his second heart—the cursed one. The one he kept hidden. The one that begged for mercy in a voice only I could hear.

“Soft,” I said, and crushed it in my fist.

You swear. You should’ve seen what happened next…

Vespyr leapt from the balcony like vengeance in heels, blades singing, green eyes glowing pure wrath. Each slash looked like fuckin Bob Ross makin, ‘Happy little god damn mistakes.’ 

I pulled my coat back and let the runes light up. I whispered my protection curse, and pulled my doubled-edged daggers. Vespyr got ‘em for me, gotta say, that lethal precious nightmare has good taste. Anyway, point is, no soul for sale was gonna stay caged on my watch.

And the room filled with that ever-so familiar sweet symphony of screams, my best girl Vespyr was mocking their pain, as she cuts and stabs her way across the room. God damn she’s poetic destruction, controlled chaos, watching her work always makes me want to fuck her senseless on the pile of her victims. 

And as the walls bled and the chandeliers screamed and demons died choking on their own tongues— we ran for the exit, behind the stage. 

By the time we reached the back of the auction hall, the place was already burning.

Soul bottles shattered like glass rain, and the air was thick with ash and redemption.

Vespyr stood beside me, her arms streaked in blood, face unreadable.

“You think they’ll come back?” she asked.

I lit a smoke with the tip of my rune-scorched finger. “They always do.”

Then we walked into the flames.

Let them rebuild. Let them hide. Let them think they’re safe.

Because we’ll be back.

And next time, we won’t knock.

I smiled.

Because some places need to burn.

Vespyr is the gasoline, explosive… Just looking for a spark.

And… I’m the goddamn match that ignites her raging inferno.
