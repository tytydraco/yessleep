Who am I? Bill! Actually, it isn’t my real name; I forgot it long ago; but that doesn’t matter; no one calls; no one knows me; no one is even around me here.

Where am I? I don’t know; I’m trapped here since when I died; it isn’t heaven nor hell; it’s an entirely different world; no one knows about its existent and no one do even now but me; I personally calls it *No Feels Land!* Wind never touches your face here, water drizzle but avoids your skin, there is no scent of freshness after rain, or scent of freshly baked bread, or anything; nothing at all; there is none one can feel in this world.

How did I get here? I deserved it; for my *ignorance* and *love.*

What do I do in this world? I kill the people in living world!

\*\*\*

Cavitish’s daughter was very sick and had been for many months now.

‘She has been poisoned!’ concluded the doctors, months ago; ‘considering the dose, it’s a miracle she even survived; now pray for one more to wake her from coma’

Even after months of medication and specialized care; the poison wasn’t drained completely; and even after all the efforts, Lilit remained in an overextended comma and can’t be discharged; she would have died long ago if it weren’t for the excellent skillset of doctors and nursing staff at the town hospital.

‘It must have been an unfortunate accident’ some people would suggest; ‘No! it was a murder attempt; out of grudge that Cavitish hold!’; were other’s view on the incident; ‘and now he *pretends* to care for her by staying all day at the hospital; poor his wife, all cold and alone in the house’

Cavitish is a caring and affectionate father and (as some would suggest otherwise) doesn’t hold any grudge. His love for girl goes so deep that so far, he had stripped himself of everything; just to keep her live albeit in comma. His house has been auctioned (where he himself was born); many of his dear possessions are gone (including a heirloom ring from his father). All that he has done and there is still no surety if Lilit will recover. Skillset cost money and exceptional skills cost exceptionally; Cavitish has been draining fortune with no certain hope.

Cavitish had his seat next to Helli’s bed; pale moon was high, left to the right above them in a twinkling cold sky. Volume of moon light was entering the hospital hall through many windows; each window had a bed on either side in shadow; the continues alternation between light and dark was like grand piano. In the silent hall their rose a soft and gentle voice in singing manner.

*The king was kind and just with his regime,*

*The wisest person kingdom had ever seen.*

*Nobility earned him followers & foe alike,*

*And lightning fell the castle was alight.*

*The witch casted spell that none could see,*

*‘Old king is gone!’ cried revolutionaries.*

*The land did stave and people did die,*

*Sorry was the state of kingdom once high.*

*But one day prince discovered the fate,*

*He rebelled with the people before too late.*

*Ferrous battle broke out and swards were swung,*

*The darkness did pass out and songs were sung,*

*The songs were sung.*

&#x200B;

The poem ended; it was a routinely thing to sing his daughter a poem to her sleep, especially when she cries; but now there are no cries or tears and she is always asleep; Cavitish still follows this through as their shared tradition.

‘May you dream many and merry!’ he whispered in her little ear; kissed her forehead; upend the blanket; and left for his supper.

He opened the thick wooden door of the hall he was in, into dark corridor; the hospital was lifeless during night; no doctor stay there after dusk; only a few unfortunate patients, beyond save; locked up and forgotten. The corridor, from where Cavitish was, had many doors and passages, before the exit gate; it was pitch-black with no windows, not a single one to let dare a single light ray in.

Even after passing these corridors for months now, Cavitish haven’t got used to; he found the quietness creepy; and even creepier when it is broken. Every single footstep would echo over and over before being consumed by the darkness; his exhales would echo back like breathing of many unseen creatures lurking in dark corners.

At the end of corridor was the iron gate; letting the much-needed light in; moon-rays were flowing in like a silent waterfall of glow; pale white beams spilling in many shapes and sizes; chiseled in the fancy design of gate.

He opened the gate with a screeching cry and scurried out before echoes could follow him; breathing heavily and freely.

‘I have been waiting for you! Come fast now!’ He was greeted by Krin Bubble; Krein is a muscles man, night-guard at the hospital as well as a *dinner-buddy* to Cavitish.

They both got in the watch-room, Krin had already settled the meal-boxes on a wooden table but opened the lid; plenty for both. They both got at it.

‘It’s exceptionally tasty today!’ said Cavitish; ‘many compliments to Mrs. Bubble on my behalf’

‘Am sure she would appreciate every single one’ replied Mr. Bubble; ‘How’s Lilit now? Any progress?’

‘Not much change from yesterday, or from the day before, or from last week or month. But their no decline either, so it’s a good thing I guess’ he said the last part so faintly that only lips moved with no words. There was pause; no sound except some chewing. Cavitish was lost in thought. The zest of discomfort in his language gave a clear indication that Cavitish was repressing something troubling within his heart and so Krin probed him about it

‘You know you can share anything anytime with me without any second thought. Ever’ Krin said.

‘Doctor said she would die soon’ Cavitish replied at last with much pain; Krin’s chewing came to a halt; ‘She have half a week at best’ he cried. ‘Or at worst: I would find her dead right now’

Nothing one could say can ease the pain of such father; but sharing does helps. Cavitish found his heart immediately to be lighter after sharing it with someone (who was willing to listen).

‘Have you talked to Mrs. Cavitish about it?’

‘Amber! Call her Amber. Don’t associate that woman with my name’ snapped Cavitish ‘or you can call her Mrs. DeGrace; she is more of a wife to Bill DeGrace than she ever was to me’

‘Yes! she knows’ Cavitish anwered the question. ‘She received the official letter from the hospital, stating wide and clear that: The daughter of Bill DeGrace and Amber Cavitish will dies very soon’

‘It didn’t even bothered them enough to at least pay Lilith once; thought I am grateful they didn’t come’.

‘Can I ask you something, hope it wouldn’t trouble you’ asked Krin considerately.

‘Yes. Go on.’ said Cavitish; his mouth was back at motion as he continued with the dinner.

‘Why did you decided to let Lilit in? and still care so much about her? knowing full well she wasn’t *yours*(at least biologically)’ he said; ‘you don’t have to answer it if you don’t want to’ he followed immedicably after.

Without much thought; the answer was ready.

‘Because I loved her! And still do!’ he said with a smile, as if remembering all the good times with his daughter ‘I still remember seeing her eyes for the first time, they were just like Bill’s; but unlike him, so innocent’

‘Also, must I tell you: if it weren’t for me; her *blood parents* would have taken care of her’

‘She somehow gives me hope; even if she isn’t mine by blood; she is still mine by all other means; I still raised her as my own child.’

‘I was content with her; Amber and Bill couldn’t tolerate me being happy; that the only reason they poisons Lilith; she should have died long-ago if it weren’t for the immediate medical response; but that doesn’t matter now; I have lost everything already and soon my child will also be died’

‘What are you planning on doing … after it’s all done?’ Krein asked thoughtfully.

There was a pause ‘I don’t know!’ followed by another long pause. ‘I never knew life would turnup like this; I was never prepared for this; why would one be? I just wanted a normal life’ They were both done with dinner.

‘So much thank you for the food and your service’ said Cavitish and he meant it ‘Mrs. Bubble sure is a great cook; she knows how to handle meat.’

‘She indeed knows! In more than one way.’ they laughed; cleared the table and packed back the dinner-box.

The shadows were lengthening and wind was gaining pace. Krin placed the lantern in the middle of the room; and back to his duty as a watchman.

‘Sleep sound! None can trespass and harm you when I’m on watch’ assured Mr. Bubble

Cavitish thanked him again and left the watch-room. Walked back through the same corridor with same anxiety, even knowing that no one would dare come here at all; let alone if Krein is on guard.

He was back into the hall where his daughter laid; she was still breathing, which set little relief in father’s heart. He sat on his chair, with his back against the shimmering moon; covered himself toe to head in a blanket; passed one hand in Lilit’s blanket; and hold her hand. He was set to sleep now.

Trees were waving like an upside-down pendulum out the window; in the shivering winds leaves were falling endlessly, casting a thousand swarming shadows everywhere; knocking and cracking of the leaving on glass window was making conscience of the uncanny silence; a very dreadful and sinister silence that never liked to be broken; and no one should dare to.

Cavitish was having trouble sleeping tonight; a cloud of unexplained fear had engulfed him; like a predator was gazing. He stayed laid on his chair not daring to move, not even a single muscle; trying his best to fall asleep. Wind was knocking on the window in silence.

***Knock! Knock! Knock!***

The silence broke three dreadful times when there came three heavy knocking on the door. Cavitish startled and almost fell of off his chair.

The man was instantly high on guard and he was righteous to do so; no one should be in hospital.

No new knock came for a while; he stood there, question if it was real or if his own fear was playing tricks on him. When their didn’t came another knock for a while he crawled back into his blanket. ***KNOCK!*** Came the loudest yet. This time Cavitish did fell off the chair.

He anxiously walked up to the door.

‘Who are you?’ he asked from inside, without opening the gate.

‘Hama!’ answered a grim and rattling voice from outside.

‘Hama who?’

‘A traveler! who goes where ever the road takes him; be it over a frosty hill or underground caves; be it a forest, desert or glaciers. Hama loves meeting new people; there aren’t much places Hama haven’t seen or many people Hama haven’t talked to; and tonight, Hama came to meet the fortunate you’ he introduced himself.

‘And what exactly is your business here, Hama?’ asked Cavitish, as if the Hama was a sells man.

‘Business? I’m no businessman’ replied Hama ‘Rather Hama would like to be stated as your *well-wisher!* Yes, *well-wisher.* When Hama heard about your daughter and your sob story, He can’t help but avail you.’

‘What are you talking about?’ said Cavtish.

‘Hama can’t deal with your other troubles; that’s beyond Him. The most Hama can do is save your daughter!’

‘You don’t know what you are talking about, Hama! Even the finest doctors have given up on her.’

‘Yes, yes, the doctors. Those money hungry beings; doing nothing beyond selling hope. They are the ones running business with you not Hama; like he said; Hama is here to help and He knows something which even the wisest of the doctors wouldn’t have heard of in their entire career.’

‘A far long journey towards east; and beyond the desolated mountains; their exits a town, atop the *last-mountain*, in the depths of *Forever-Night-Forest*. Wood-folks dwell there and they are no ordinary people! They go by the name *Kazroo* which mean *‘one connected to forest’* which is a fitting name for them; they breath eat and live as *One* with the forest; they know about the ways of nature, better than anyone who ever had walked this good earth.’

‘Kazroo are excellent at their craft and excel chiefly at remedies; their knowledge inherent and vast; enough to make Apollo shy; They are masters of botany and marvelous herbologist and can fight off a plague nothing but roots and fruits; They are even said to be capable of curing a dead into life.’

‘Hama had stayed, slept, walked and hunt as one of them; and can do much against any illness, though he can’t revive a dead (yet).’

‘The only business Hama is here for is a generous one; He is here to help you.’

Cavitish listened to everything Hama have to say.

‘No! thanks! thank you!’ replied Cavitish as soon as Hama was done talking; ‘we don’t need any resurrecting drug of queer wood folks; especially not delivered by a generous stranger this late into night; for all I know you may be leaning against your murder axe on the other side of door right now; waiting for me to open the door. Just thinking it is making me uncomfortable’

‘Hama possess no intentions of harm nor any weapon let alone a *murder axe*’ replied the Hama ‘and *if* He is a killer; He would have ambushed you from behind; glass window breaks easily; you would have been dead before even reacting a muscle; is that comforting?’

No! that wasn’t comforting at all. In fact, it was exactly the opposite; Cavitish was uneased. He hastily and thoroughly scanned all the windows, searching if the man had any partner, from left to right and again. He found no one or any anomaly. Krerin was still on the guard at the entrance, sitting in his watch-room, lantern from his watch-room was twinkling like an orange dot from the widow.

Krerin is known for his commitment for work; Cavitish knew that there is no other way to get in the hospital except to get pass the main entrance where Krerin was (the walls are high and fenced all around the premise); and if Mr. Bubble had let Hama in then there mustn’t be any trouble associated with Him, and this thought was comforting.

‘You should let Hama in now!’ said the voice.

Cavitish opened the door. Before him stood a man, not above five feet from the ground, wrapped in a dark cloak all around his body but front of his face, which remained unseen in the dark; Cavitish wondered for a moment if the man has any head at all; lips in the dark flapped.

‘Your well-wisher Hama’ the man bowed. Cavitish reciprocate in discomfort. There was a shift in air as the Hama entered the Hall.

They two sat by the bed of young girl. Now in moonlight, Cavitish could finally see the Hama’s face; more than anything, he was glad the man at least had a face.

Hama had a boney face; skin was wrinkleless; like a skinless skeleton. Aged and shrunken; like the man had grown so much yet haven’t aged a day; stuck in time like an unturned stone; like victim of a very terrible curse. His skin was pale white, illuminating even paler in cold moon. Cavitish got a chilled spin just from the presence of this man. The mort uncanny part for Cavitish was that: the man didn’t bear a single strand of hair.

Cavitish wasn’t sure if the man had any hair on his head and he was much freaked out to ask; but as far the facial hair go; the man, uncannily, had none of it; not a single strand of eyebrow, eyelash, beard or moustache; Cavitish found it disturbing; questioning himself for letting this abomination in (even though it haven’t committed anything except for walking a few steps in and setting on an empty chair). Hama didn’t minded much the, somewhat rude, curtesy of Cavitish and got to his work.

Hama was very professional. He summoned mortar and pestle our from one of the many pockets and folds of his swaddled cloak. He drew out leaves and twigs of various shape, size, color and age. some fresh-green some decayed-brown; and triturated them into one. Next were the turns of pre-brewed portions and tonics; red, green, purple, lime, milky and transparent. He carefully poured them into the mortar; amount and effect varied for each tonic; one portion turned the mixture in mortar into crystal; a strike of pestle and powder again; while one set the mixture on fire; one, with just a little amount, unnaturally increase the net volume of product; while one shrunken it. The precision with which Hama was orchestrating all this was satisfying to witness.

At last Hama, very-very delicately, took out a flower from his innermost fold. It was a flower in glass jar. It wasn’t any normal flower. it was different, very different. The flower didn’t have fragile or colorful petals; it was a bloom of crystal, clear like night sky, glittering like a diamond; flower itself was illumining a genital and comforting glow. A mist of moonlight and whispers of lullaby seems to have filled the room; like the flower was humming as it swayed in the still glass container.

It was the most tempting and astatic thing Cavtish had ever seen; no combinations of characters and describe, neither the beuty of the flower nor the expression on Cabitish’s face. He found himself to be mesmerized by the White-Beauty; a feeling like a great weight has been lifted off of him flooded his heart; like he was free.

‘This is the Crystal-Heart,’ said Hama; carful depositing the Cristal-Heart into the mortar; the lullabies and comfort left the room as flowers was grinded away.

After all the grinding; a peanut sized portion of white paste was left at the bottom of mortar; which wasn’t tempting and was resembling an insulting low amount of toothpaste. Hama scooped it up into a spoon and passed the spoon to Cavitish.

‘Do you really think this will work’ said Cavitish with distrust and skepticism, with undertone meaning of: ‘you are not a psychopath; doing all this just to poison her, and getting a weird kink out of it, do you?’

Without a word Hama dipped his little finger in the spoon, and sucked it.

‘Don’t worry it’s not poisonous!’ he said afterwards.

‘Why are you going to such extreme lengths just to help a poor man out’ asked cavitish; ‘I am sure, (if what you claim is real), then if you were to give even half this chuck from this spoon to a king, He would pay you with over the half the land in his kingdom. So why me? I doesn’t even have anything to pay’

‘When did a well-meant well-wisher ever demanded to be paid?’ replied Hama ‘and as far it goes for why I am helping you? Like I said earlier; I heard your story and struggles you have been through. heard about how your wife cheated on you with your best friend Bill (they probably would be goofing around at *your* house right now); and after that I discovered this child isn’t even yours; you are a good man; I want to play my part to ease your struggle; May you all be served justice soon.’

There was a brief pause.

‘But how can I ever get your debt back?’ Cavitish said at last.

‘There is no price for a gift’ replied Hama; ‘But if you like feeling paying,’ he added; his left hand entered a fold of his cloak and bring back a peculiar *call-bell* ‘if you feel like paying than accept this! I want you to safe keep this bell in your possession’

‘Is this bell a stolen possession?’ was the first thought that came to Cavitish mind and he inquired.

‘I would know far better places to hid it if that were to be the case’ Hama replied; ‘Right now, just say ‘*I accept this bell, thank you*!’ can you do that for me?’

Cavitish gave it an extensive thought; the offer didn’t made much sense to him but since anything the man has said or done so far had hardly made any sense at all; Cavitish complied with the offer and accepted the bell; fed the spoon to his sleeping daughter (not before dipping a finger and testing it himself).

‘Hama must go now!’ said the man in a hurry with a change in his speech; ‘one more thing Hama must ask: ring the bell in exactly after 4 hours from now.’

Nothing Cavitish said could convince him of staying any longer, he left immediately with many ‘thank you’ at his back; out of the moonlit hall he went into the dark corridor and out of the hospital from the main gate; past the Krerin; and out of sight. Never to be seen by anyone ever after.

Cavitish questioned himself many times over of what the purpose of all this was; and if *it* was actually real or he was just dreaming and imagining it all; every time the bell reminded him of factuality.

When the time came; Cavitish pressed the golden button on the bell; *Ding!* It rang harmoniously. The wind was not flowing, the leaves were not falling; in the silence Cavitish finally fell asleep.

That night many strange incidents were happened all around the town. People heard a baffling laugh of a maniac, which sounded like cry of a witch and her crow; some reported to have captured glimpse of the said man from afar; some even claimed to have encounter the culprit head-on ‘*I think he cursed me with his appearance*’ many claimed. None of the people dared leave their houses after dark for many upcoming days.

The thing that unsettled Cavitish the most was: Krerin was found dead in his watch-room. Someone stabbed the guard and settled the body in such a position as to give off the impression that he was alive and on-watch; medical reports declared that he was dead for the entirety of last night.
