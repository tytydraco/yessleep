Everything’s falling apart around me. Friends, family, and strangers alike have all succumbed to whatever this is. My world is crumbling before me, and you know the worst part?

I can’t do a thing about it.

Not that I’m sure I’d be able to anyways, though. It started just yesterday evening, though it seems like such a long time ago now.

I get sick easily, which makes me wonder why I was able to go so long without it affecting me. What did affect me was a nasty case of the Flu.

Caught it four days before all of this happened and it knocked me right out. One second, I was getting home from work and preparing to do some homework. The next, I was bedridden and trying to expel the sickness any way I could.

That really is the worst part, not being able to do a thing about this. I can’t help anyone, I can’t help myself, I can’t do anything.

I had no clue what was going on until mom got home from the store last night with all the essentials she’d get when one of us boys were sick.

She looked shaken, like she’d seen a ghost. I couldn’t see her—my bedroom door was closed—but I could hear her. It sounded like she was circling around the same spot over and over again. Pacing from stress, maybe, I wasn’t sure. After a while, the pacing stopped and I could hear the footsteps approaching my room.

She knocked and I did my best to let her know she could come in. She entered my room with some ginger-ale and other items you’d normally have when sick.

 As she dropped some of them off, I got curious and tried to find out what had happened. I almost regret finding out, and I’m sure mom regretted telling me. But something like this can’t stay a secret.

I’m going to tell you what happened.

Mom seemed a little frantic as she dropped my essentials off, so I decided to bite and try and ask her what had happened.

“M—mom. What—happened? You—okay?” I rasped the words, my sore throat quickly having to adapt to me talking. It hurt.

“Uh—” She said. “Something—something at the store.”

“What?” I asked.

“I—I really don’t think you need to know.” She replied. “It’s messed up.”

I may not have needed to know, but I certainly wanted to. I figured I’d keep pestering her until I got an answer.

“I—I’d like to.” I said, trying to shrug my shoulders. I was unable to, but she got the point from looking at me attempting it. “Just—curious.”

“Are you really sure you want to know what happened?” She asked. “It’s like I already told you, it was messed up.”

“Y—yes.” I rasped.

“Mm, okay.” She said, pulling out my desk chair and taking a seat while facing me. “I did warn you, though.”

Apparently something had happened to someone just outside of the store.

“It was horrible.” Mom said. “Do you—do you know Rob from the antique store?”

“Seen him—around.” I said. “Why?”

“Well… something happened to him today… something bad.” She replied. “It was just before I went in. I was a little bit behind him, so he would’ve made it in before me. He would have made it if he didn’t suddenly collapse near the entrance.”

I remained silent. Better that I didn’t put any strain on my throat.

“There were others, but they just stood around and didn’t do anything. I took it upon myself to go and help him, but—oh god, it was horrible.”

I didn’t reply. Just nodded my head.

“There was blood, I mean, coming out of his mouth. But there was this other stuff too. It was yellow, kind of chunky. Like vomit, almost.” At this point, she had to take a second and cover her mouth. Taking measures not to throw up, I assumed.

“Okay.” She resumed. “It was like vomit, but not so solid. It was similar in texture to gelatin. It was leaking out of Rob’s mouth in addition to the blood. As I looked closer, I could see the same yellow gunk on different parts of his face. It looked darker and more concentrated around his eyes, ears and nose. Maybe where it’d started? Or, maybe he inhaled something?”

My heart began to thump a little quicker. It couldn’t be assumed that this was just a bad allergic reaction to something like pollen. I mean, it was possible for this kind of thing to happen, but, what were the odds that he had suffered from an allergic reaction this badly? To puke up blood? It didn’t make sense, not a whole lot.

“It’s not pollen season.” Mom said. “Well, there are some that persist this late into the year, but none like this. I tapped him on the shoulder and he just shuddered. Didn’t really move, didn’t really do anything. Just shook and went right back to how he was. That was only for a few seconds, though.”

I shook my head and raised my eyebrows. Well, I did as much as I could to do both. She put both hands on her head before resuming.

“He started shaking again. Harder and harder. I would have mistaken it for a seizure if what happened next didn’t happen. Abruptly, he stopped shaking and shot right up. One second, he was laying on the ground in a pool of his own blood and that disgusting yellow stuff. The next, he was—”

Mom was suddenly and violently cut off by a nasty coughing fit. Sounded like it hurt. After a few seconds, she was able to clear her throat and stop coughing. “Jeez.” She said. “Sorry, that was gross.”

I shook my head again, silently asking her to continue the story.

“Okay.” She said. “Right, Rob stood up from the position that he was in, which surprised me. Considering his previous circumstances, it was a little strange. I finally got a more proper look at him. Well, his face, mostly. The yellow gunk wasn’t just crusted on his face anymore, it was actively leaking from his ears, eyes and nose. He started to move towards me. I said his name but it was like he didn’t know who I was. He started to run, so I dove out of the way and went crashing to the pavement. Instead of doing whatever he wanted to do to me, Rob—” She broke a little and covered her mouth, to stifle a sob, I assumed. I was wrong.

“It was horrifying, Michael.” That caught me. Normally, she’d use my nickname, Mikey. She’d only use my full name in serious situations. “Rob just ran. He sprinted. Full speed. Just ran way past me and the store into the forest behind it. It was so horrible. And—and—he left behind more of that stuff—that yellow gunk. It mostly just flew out of his mouth, but some dripped from the other holes in his face. I mean, it’s only been like, what, an hour? But nothing’s been reported. Nothing has been reported regarding Rob.”

“I—I’m sorry.” I rasped.

“It’s okay.” She said. “You didn’t do anythin—” She was once again cut off by a violent coughing fit. After she recovered, it looked like there was still more of the story to tell.

“When I went inside the store, the situation was better, but not by much. Some people we’re coughing, but it wasn’t nearly as bad as what I saw with Rob. It was just the same thing throughout the whole store. Just people intermittently coughing. I never saw if they coughed anything up like how Rob did, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if that was the case.”

“Mm.” I said weakly.

“I got the groceries and got out as quickly as I could. Things moved fast when I was in the store. By the time I got out, a lot more people were coughing. I did my best to hold my breath as I made my way to the car. I got in and I was able to breathe. Didn’t speed, but I made my way home relatively quick. Closed all the windows and doors and shut everything out—tried to.”

“You—you don’t think—you got it—did you?” I muttered.

“Oh, God. I hope not.” She said. “It’s just so horrible—I think we should stop talking about it. I—it’s late.”

“Is it?” I asked.

“Yes. I need to go to bed for work tomorrow. I’ll stop back here periodically to check on you. Stay in the house, okay?”

I nodded.

“Good.” She said, getting up. “I’m not sure what’s happening, but we should try and stay s—”

One last time, she was violently interrupted by another coughing fit. This one went on for longer and sounded more vicious. She finished coughing and quickly turned around.

“Good night, Michael.” She said, grabbing the door handle with her right hand. “I love you.”

“Y—you too.” I managed. She closed the door.

Her rapid movements hadn’t been for nothing. I was sure that she’d turned around as quickly as she did to hide something that terrified her. Something that terrified me. Something she didn’t know I’d seen.

She did indeed turn around quickly, but not quickly enough for me to see the yellow mucous-like slime she’d coughed out.

Mom got whatever it was.

Mom is gone. I woke up earlier today to nothing. No sounds in the house. It felt cold, though. A door must’ve been opened. Whether it was by mom or someone else, I don’t know. What I know is that she’s gone and a door is open somewhere in the house.

The fact that I can feel the cold in my room only tells me that I’ve probably been breathing the outside air. I can’t get up, still too tired to move from my bed. I did wake up with a little more strength. Not much, though, just enough to do something like using my phone.

That’s how I’m getting this out. It’s been completely silent since this morning, but I’m not so sure that it’s going to stay that way. I’m hearing footsteps in the grass outside the part of the house where my room is located. No words, just grunts and small noises. They’re outside my house.

I’m writing this as a warning. Something’s wrong with the air. I don’t know what it is or why it’s happening, but it’s making people sick—making them lose control of their bodies. It’s made me sick. Just a few minutes ago, I was plagued by a sudden and savage coughing fit.

My throat hurt so badly I had to strain and close my eyes just to mitigate some of the pain. When I opened my eyes, I saw some of the yellow gunk on my blanket.

I wish I could do something—anything to help, but I’m sick. In more ways than one. I can’t get out of bed, I have whatever this is, and you know the worst part of it all?

I wouldn’t even be able to do anything if I didn’t have this. Still knocked out with the Flu.

What I can do—however—is send out a warning.

This infection, whatever it may be, is turning people into—God, I don’t even know what to call them. Mindless, feral, almost zombie-like.

It’s something in the air, I know that much for sure. If you haven’t already caught it, get inside and hunker down. Get as much food as you can and make sure your home is well sealed.

And most importantly, when you’re outside, don’t breathe it in.
