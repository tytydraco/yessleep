Cleaning apartments was my least favorite part of my job. Usually I’m up at the lake houses doing weekly touch ups on homes that are barely used by their wealthy owners, which are easy. 

But some days I have to deep clean empty apartments. Although, for sixteen an hour it’s worth it most of the time. 

Usually we are only allowed to work on a home or apartment for up to five hours. I assume that the residents of the houses don’t want us spending the whole day in their homes, but for apartments I guess the company didn’t want to pay for more than five hours. 

This is the first time I’m cleaning at the Birch Grove apartments. It sits in a poorer side of town but it looks alright from the outside. Just a basic complex. There was a slight breeze, carrying the smell of freshly cut grass and warmth. It was nice out, a perfect day to spend in a stuffy apartment, scrubbing away.

I climb up the stairs with a stepstool, my bag of cleaning supplies, and a vacuum. 

I enter the apartment, 112-6, and am hit with the scent of mothballs and sweet garbage. The screened windows have been opened to air out the rooms but it didn’t help. 

I get to work, starting in the kitchen since it will take the longest. 

Scrubbing the oven, picking out dried meat and gristle from under the burners, vacuuming up cat hair and bugs in the drawers, then cleaning the microwave above. There was a thick layer of dust on top of the cabinets and fridge that I had to use my rag instead of my duster. 

I then got down onto the floor and opened the fridge, It was cleaner than expected. I took out every shelf and drawer and began a detailed clean. Mysterious orange and yellow stains disappeared with a wipe, I dumped old shredded cheese from the drawers onto the ground, and cleaned out the slightly molded pink corners deep in the fridge. 

With that done I wiped down the counters and washed the sink out. After three hours of work and black crust under my nails the kitchen is finished. 

The two bedrooms are easy; dust the ceiling fans, baseboards, and closet. I found a few granddaddy longlegs but I swiped them down onto the floor, giving them some chance to escape. I hate cleaning up dead bugs. 

Then there’s the bathroom. The smell was luckily masked by the overall stuffy stench of the apartment, however, the sight was enough to make me queasy. 

When cleaning places like this, one has to turn off the gross-meter in their brains, disconnecting from my body and just focus on whatever podcast or video essay I’m listening to, and that’s exactly what I had to do. I scrubbed the toilet, all sides, inside and out were stained with dried excrement and caked on dust. Inside the bowl I had to rub a pumice stone to get the remnants that were stubborn. Then somehow the sink was worse, strange black stains covered the porcelain that didn't want to come out. By the time I finished in the bathroom my nose burned with bleach and my hands were dry and wrinkly. I should have worn gloves but I was running out of time for this apartment. 

I went back downstairs to my car to grab my mop and— shit, I forgot to wipe down the freezer. 

Re-entering the apartment, mop in hand, I set it down and make my way back to the fridge. 

I open the freezer for the first time in my time cleaning and the smell hits me like a train. The sight was just as horrid: Black mold. I looked up photos to confirm and it was in fact black mold, slimy and dark and putrid. I spray it with all purpose cleaner and it wipes away easily, thank god. With the freezer open the only scent is stale coldness mixed with rotting cheese or maybe what death would smell like. I pull up the neck of my shirt and tuck it under my glasses, trying to put something between me and the smell. 

My rag was soaking with the disturbed mold, cleaner, and the gathering condensation. It was gross, to say the least. I've always been scared of mold, or anything that can be perceived as infectious or rotten. If something is even a day past expiration date I toss it, scared that I'll become sick or worse. And being even close to the stuff had my stomach turning, making me want to leave as quickly as possible. 

The vacuuming took too long and the mopping was easy. Finally I can clock out and go home, take a damn shower. 

I toss the mold covered rag in with the rest of my apartment trash and drive home in a dazed rush. I’m usually tired around this time of day, that apartment definitely didn’t help. 

During my drive I can still smell the apartment. Its stench clung to my clothes and my skin. When I pulled into my driveway I threw away the trash I collected from the apartment, the first step in forgetting that place. 

I take my well deserved shower, staying in until the water turns cold. I scrub hard against my hands and face to get rid of the phantom feeling of the mold. I never made direct contact with it, but it still felt as if it were clinging to my skin. Once I finished I dumped my work clothes into the washer by themselves. It made me feel safer, cleaner. 

I spend the rest of my afternoon in my bedroom, playing video games, watching videos, texting my friends to complain about the apartment. 

A friend said the best way to get rid of black mold is baking soda. Wish I knew that before I had to waste a rag. 


And the next morning comes quickly, a Tuesday morning. I get up early for class then get to my car at 7-ish. As I sit down, pull up my music, and buckle up, a sharp, gross smell hits my senses. 

The wet mold is in the car with me, somewhere. I had no time to search for the source and decided to wait until after school to clean out my car. 

But that afternoon I just couldn't find it. I threw away the trash, the rag, and I cleaned my clothes. Yet the smell lingers. 

I put an air freshener in my car, hoping that it goes away in a day or so. 

And it finally did. The scent of my car is now ocean breeze and pinesol. 

The next few days are uneventful, however I am definitely quitting my cleaning job soon. I can’t get the apartment out of my head. 

I had a nightmare about it, a day or so after the initial clean. I was back in there, cleaning it, and I saw the mold in the freezer. This time the mold was covering the entire bottom of it, like a black, slimy shag carpet. But I cleaned it anyway, my rag swiping it away in rows and it felt a little satisfying. My rag was covered in the spores and it smelled just as awful as I remember— like rot. 

I woke up and I swear I still smelled it. The smell stayed all day, and I hoped it would disappear but it just persisted. I couldn’t eat without the sight of the mold creeping up on my tongue or on my food. 

I called out of work the day I was scheduled to return to the same complex. My boss said I received a complaint for the lack-luster job I did in that apartment. But I didn’t care, because I still smelled it. The staleness, the decay, the wetness of that freezer. 

It’s been a week, and I’ve grown used to the smell. It bothers me sometimes but at least I can eat again. I keep looking up why I’m still smelling it and I saw phantom smells and phantosmia come up, but after reading it says that it only affects people 40 or older. I’m nineteen. 

Even if I did have it, it looks like it isn’t dangerous. Just makes me lose my appetite really. 

The smell gradually got stronger, and I didn’t really notice until I went into my kitchen while my mom was cooking. I smelled nothing but the mold. The biscuits, the crock pot chicken, the potatoes, the jack daniels she had on the counter— everything smelled of mold. 

Then I had to sneeze. It's gross, but snot landed on my arm. 

And it was gray, mixed with yellowish mucus. I couldn't believe what I was seeing— I felt disgust welling in my stomach, I can't look at it. 

I grabbed a tissue from the box on the counter and wiped it away before vigorously washing my hands and arm. 

The mold. That couldn't be the mold, right? I never made physical contact with it and even if I did it wouldn't be in me. 

It must have been dust. I clean all the time, so some dust must have gotten into my nose. 

I'm overcome with the smell of wet mold again and I have to leave the kitchen, fingers pinching my nostrils. This didn’t dull the scent at all, of course. 

I skipped dinner, choosing to lay in my bed and try my best to sleep despite the sliminess I felt in my stomach. 

My mind is playing tricks on me, I know this, it always latches on to the worst possibilities, amplifies them. 

I would hear a strange noise in my house and assume someone broke in to murder my family. My drink was left out of sight for a moment and I think my parents put poison in it. Food made at my friends house definitely was made poorly and I would die from a food borne illness. I'm paranoid of anyone too nice or think the person speaking to me is some strange non-human creature trying to trick me. 

Mental illness, illogical thoughts, that's all it is. And right now I think there is something growing inside of me. 

I clock in for work, this time it is a three story house that needs touch ups. Or, at least I was told it only needed minimum work, three hours at most. 

I go to the bottom floor to begin and I notice spiders and their webs strewn about in every corner, hall, and doorway. I brought a mask with me this time around, wanting to avoid any more contamination. 

I put it on and begin sweeping and vacuuming the spiders. None got on me, but of course I feel them crawl on my skin and their webs touch my eyes. 

I'm easily overwhelmed by it all. Ironically this was the first house I cleaned when I started six months ago, and I decided it would be my last. 

The sheer amount of discomfort I've experienced lately because of this job is not worth the pay. So, I call my boss and tell her I'm going home. I quit, and it feels cathartic. I feel relief for the first time in a while, I take a deep breath and smell scentless air, dust. 

Not mold. 

I grab my supplies and head up the stairs, lock the door, then drive home. 

And the smell is completely gone the next morning, and the next day, and the next. 

My thought process was that one of my biggest stressors, my job, is finally gone, so maybe that phantosmia was caused by stress. 

But yesterday morning I felt sick to my stomach. I shot out of bed, feeling bile rising up through my throat. I barely make it to the bathroom before I’m expelling into the toilet. I shut my eyes and ride it out— throwing up is scary to me but I rather that then feel awful all day. 

I cough and finally look into the bowl. Yellow, red, and black floated and moved in the water below my face. Chunks of black things bob up and down as I breathe heavily. 

Then more comes up, it feels like its getting caught in my throat as I choke and cough, managing to hack some of it up and out. What looks like a large blood clot slaps onto the water. 

And the scent hits me once again, after being free from it for a week. Black mold.

The taste of it on my tongue reminds me of spoiled milk chunks you would accidently drink, or what rotten meat smells like. But also a similar feeling to ingesting hand sanitizer after licking your fingers. 

I threw up again due to the sensory overload, mostly yellow bile, thankfully. 

After what I assume was an hour it finally stopped. 

It was on and off for the whole day, and this morning I’m finally going to the doctor. 

Wish me luck guys.
