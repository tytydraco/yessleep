My work always seemed unusual in a way, but I wasn't expecting the truth that was revealed. I wasn't expecting it to be so bad.

I worked from 9-5 every day and had no work on the weekends. I never ever had overtime. I always got told I would get laid off if I wasn't out of the office by 5:10pm. 
Even when we were short staffed.

My job was as a delivery driver. But not your usual delivery guy. It wasn't pizza, or amazon, or anything like that. I never actually found out what I delivered at the time. The pay was incredible, so I just brushed it off.

The way I actually got the job was me seeing a flyer of it on an abandoned house. It said on there I needed to collect the flyer and take it to the place. I didn't even need a resume!

I had 2 bosses. They were both shady guys, and I never found out their real names. They called themselves Chop and Sam. But that was nowhere near their real names. 

Chop was the main guy and would boss around Sam, even though they were the same level. Chop packed everything. EVERYTHING. Sam took the orders and alerted Chop.

We didn't get many orders a day. And I barely had to do anything, really. I just sat in the office and waited till I got the smelly boxes.

The boxes stunk. It was rancid. But I thought to myself, the pay is so worth it. When I actually got these boxes, I didn't deliver to houses. Ever. It was always sketchy abandoned places. No one was ever there to collect them, I had to leave them on the floor normally behind the shutters.

One time, I actually saw a man waiting in the alley. He had hair slicked back and dark sunglasses. He had a lightly shaven beard and black clothes. When I got into my car to drive away, I saw him collect the package. 

After about 3 months of working there, I saw another sketchy man in an alley. This time, I decided to follow him. I took off my delivery hat and jacket so I wasn't recognizable to the guy. He went back down the sketchy alley and waited there for 5 minutes, looking around. Then, he left the alley and went down a wide spread area with no people whatsoever. 

After living 5 years in this town, I'd never seen this area. Ever.

After that, he took a long route to a weird looking house painted all black and boarded up windows apart from one. He walked in, and I wondered how to get in there myself. Then I got a call from my boss. I walked down a few houses to stay far away. 

I answered the call.

"Where are you??" Chop said.
"There are police around, so I can't drop the package yet." I replied 
He hung up. 

I'm not allowed to drop the package when cops are around, so that was my excuse. 

The man left the house, so I went brave and climbed in through the unboared window.

The house stunk, flies and rotting "food" were everywhere. The floor was covered in rubbish and you couldn't see the floor. 

I searched the house and eventually found the box. It was unopened, so I opened it.
What was revealed when I opened it gives me nightmares to this day. 

It was a cold, no blooded arm.

A full-on arm. 

And I discovered that it wasn't rotting food around the house. 

I covered my mouth and stood there, frozen in shock. Our company boxes were everywhere around the room. I ran as fast as I could out of that house. I didn't look back. I got into my car and called the police right away. 

The police told me that for evidence, I had to deliver a box that the police would collect. 2 police officers would catch the man who collects the boxes, and 2 would get the box. I agreed to this plan.

I got the box as usual, feeling disgusted. On the way there, I slightly opened the box. In there, was another cold arm with maggots covering it. I had backup tape that Chop gave me, so I covered the box up. 

I left the box at the same abandoned shop, and the police ran for it. They took me back to the station and opened the box. The arm was revealed, and they asked me to drive to the office with them behind me. 

I drove there sweating and scared. Chop and Sam were rough men. When I got there, the police told everyone to freeze. Chop and Sam looked me dead in the eye.

"Looks like we have a snake on the team," Sam shouted. 
"Could've told us we were delivering ARMS!" I shouted back. I wasn't taking his crap.
 Every single employee gasped. They ran and stood next to the police. There were about 5 of us. 

"We meet again, Chop and Sam. Or should I say, Daniel and Gary." An officer said. 

"You employees can go, we will let you know court dates."

It turns out Daniel (Chop) and Gary (Sam), got arrested.

It's only been 5 months since the incident. I still look over my shoulder to this day. 

I'm a builder now. Much better job. It actually comes up online, and no sketchy flyers or people. Ads online, resumes, honest workers and bosses. It feels better not having to stay secret and hide from police.
