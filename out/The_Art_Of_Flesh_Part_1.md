I didn’t think much of it when I found the papers.

It was my first day at St. Vincent’s, and I was already running late. The hospital’s labyrinthine halls had swallowed me whole, and by the time I found my office—a cramped little room tucked away on the third floor—I was too exhausted to care about anything except catching my breath.

The desk was old, its surface scratched and scuffed from years of use. A single drawer sat slightly ajar, and curiosity got the better of me. I tugged it open, expecting to find nothing more than a few stray pens or maybe an outdated manual on hospital protocols.

Instead, I found a stack of papers, yellowed at the edges and bound together with a single piece of surgical thread.

At first glance, they seemed like ordinary notes—scribbled diagrams of sutures, anatomical sketches, lists of procedures—but as I flipped through them, something caught my eye: a name scrawled across the top of one page in shaky black ink.

Dr. Evelyn Harper.

I’d heard that name before.

During my orientation, one of the older nurses had mentioned her in passing—a brilliant trauma surgeon who had worked here years ago. “She was one of the best,” they’d said with a wistful smile. “But she left suddenly. No one knows why.”

I hadn’t thought much of it at the time—surgeons came and went all the time in this field—but now, holding these papers in my hands, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to her story than anyone had let on.

The first page wasn’t dated, but the handwriting was rushed and uneven, as though she’d written it in a hurry—or under duress.

The Pages:

If you’re reading this, then you’ve taken my place.

Those were the first words on the page, scrawled in bold letters that seemed to leap off the paper. My stomach tightened as I read on.

I don’t know how much time you have before it finds you—but if you’re smart, you’ll leave now. Walk out that door and never come back. Burn these papers if you can. Forget my name.

I glanced over my shoulder instinctively, half-expecting someone to be standing there watching me. The hallway outside my office was empty, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.

Taking a deep breath, I turned back to the papers and kept reading.

I’ve always believed that precision is what separates life from death. A single misplaced suture, a fraction of a second’s hesitation, and the patient on your table becomes just another statistic. That’s the reality of my work—cold, clinical, and unforgiving.  

People like to romanticize surgeons as miracle workers, as if we’re touched by some divine hand. But there’s nothing miraculous about what I do. It’s blood and tissue, clamps and scalpels, bone saws and suction tubes. The human body is a machine—a messy, fragile one—and I’m just a mechanic with a medical degree.

I’ve spent years perfecting my craft. My hands are steady even when my mind isn’t. I can work for hours without flinching at the sight of exposed organs or shattered bones. I know how to cut and sew flesh so cleanly that you’d barely notice the scars once it heals. People call me gifted. They don’t see the toll it takes—the nightmares, the exhaustion, the constant weight of knowing that one mistake could cost someone everything.

But lately… something feels off.  

It started with little things—tools going missing from my kit, surgical thread I swore I hadn’t used running out faster than usual. At first, I blamed it on fatigue or forgetfulness. Long shifts at the hospital can blur days together into an endless cycle of blood and fluorescent lights. But then there were the letters.

The first one arrived three weeks ago, tucked neatly into my mailbox between bills and junk flyers. The envelope was plain white, unmarked except for my name scrawled across it in shaky black ink: *Dr. Evelyn Harper.* Inside was a single sheet of paper with just two words written on it: *Beautiful work.*

I didn’t think much of it at first—maybe a former patient trying to thank me in some cryptic way or a weird prank from one of the interns at the hospital. I tossed it in the trash and forgot about it until the next letter came two days later.

This one was longer.

*“I’ve been watching you for some time now, Dr. Harper. Your hands are extraordinary—so precise, so careful. You don’t just save lives; you create art.”*

Art? That word stuck with me in a way I couldn’t shake. Surgery wasn’t art—it was science, pure and simple. There was no beauty in stitching someone back together after a car crash or removing a tumor from their brainstem. It was survival, nothing more.

Still, I couldn’t stop thinking about that letter. Something about it felt… wrong. The handwriting was jagged and uneven, like whoever wrote it had been trembling—or maybe laughing—as they pressed pen to paper.

By the time the third letter arrived, I couldn’t ignore it anymore.

*“Your talent deserves recognition,”* it read. *“Soon, you’ll understand what you’re truly capable of.”*

I didn’t tell anyone about the letters—not my colleagues at the hospital, not my sister who called every Sunday to check on me, not even Marcus, my ex-boyfriend who still sent me texts asking if we could “talk.” What would I say? That some anonymous admirer was sending me vaguely threatening love notes? It sounded ridiculous even to me.

But then came the package.

It was waiting for me on my doorstep when I got home from work one night—a plain cardboard box sealed with duct tape. No address, no postage stamp, just my name scrawled across the top in that same shaky handwriting.

I hesitated before opening it. Something about the weight of it felt… off—too heavy for its size but not solid enough to be anything ordinary.

When I finally peeled back the tape and lifted the lid, the smell hit me first: coppery and sour, like old blood left to rot in stagnant water.

Inside was a severed hand.

At least… most of it was a hand. The fingers were too long—stitched together from different hands by thick black thread that crisscrossed over pale skin like spiderwebs. The palm had been split open and sewn back together with surgical precision so perfect that for one horrifying moment I thought *I* might have done it.

There was a note tucked beneath the hand:

*“Your masterpiece awaits.”*


I didn’t sleep that night.  

The hand sat in its box on my kitchen counter, its grotesque form illuminated by the cold light of the overhead bulb. I couldn’t bring myself to touch it again, but I couldn’t throw it away either. My mind raced with questions I didn’t want to answer. Who had sent it? How had they gotten my address? And why did it feel so… familiar?  

I spent hours staring at it, trying to convince myself that this was some elaborate prank—maybe one of the interns at the hospital had gone too far. But deep down, I knew better. The stitches were too precise, the thread too cleanly knotted. Whoever had done this wasn’t just skilled; they were a master.  

And they wanted me to know it.

By morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. I wrapped the box in a garbage bag and drove to a dumpster on the other side of town, tossing it in without looking back. But even as I drove away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d made a mistake—that I’d just thrown away evidence of something far worse than a prank.


The next few days passed in a haze of exhaustion and unease. At work, I found myself double-checking every suture, every incision, as if expecting something to go wrong. My colleagues noticed my distraction but didn’t press me about it—surgeons are used to stress, after all.  

But then things started disappearing.

It began with small items—scalpels, clamps, rolls of surgical thread—things that could easily be misplaced during a long shift. At first, I assumed someone else had taken them by mistake or that I’d simply forgotten where I’d put them. But then I noticed other things missing: my favorite coffee mug from the break room, a pair of shoes from my locker, even my ID badge.

And then there were the whispers.

They started late one night as I was finishing up paperwork in my office. At first, I thought it was just the hum of the air conditioning or the distant murmur of voices from the ER downstairs. But as the minutes passed, the sound grew louder—low and guttural, like someone speaking just out of earshot.

I froze, my pen hovering over the page as I strained to make out the words. They were faint and fragmented, like pieces of a puzzle that didn’t quite fit together: *“Beautiful… craft… waiting… chosen…”*

I stood up so quickly that my chair toppled over behind me. The whispers stopped immediately, leaving only silence in their wake.


That night, I locked every door and window in my apartment before crawling into bed with a kitchen knife tucked under my pillow. It felt ridiculous—like something out of a bad horror movie—but I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me.

I woke up at 3:17 a.m., gasping for air as if someone had been holding me underwater. The room was pitch black except for a faint sliver of moonlight filtering through the curtains. For a moment, everything seemed normal—until I noticed the shadow at the foot of my bed.

It wasn’t moving.

My breath caught in my throat as my eyes adjusted to the darkness. It was tall and hunched over, its body cloaked in something that rippled like smoke caught in a breeze. Its face—or what should have been its face—was hidden beneath a mask stitched together from multiple faces: pale skin stretched taut over hollow eye sockets and mouths frozen mid-scream.

I couldn’t move. My body refused to obey me as it stepped closer, its movements slow and deliberate like a predator stalking prey.

“You’ve been chosen,” it said without speaking—the words echoing directly in my mind like shards of glass scraping against bone.

I wanted to scream, but no sound came out. All I could do was watch as it reached out toward me with long fingers made of shadow and thread.

“Your masterpiece awaits,” it whispered again before everything went black.


When I woke up, sunlight was streaming through the curtains, and everything seemed normal again—except for one thing.

There was a stitch on my arm.

It was small and neat, running along the inside of my forearm like an old scar that hadn’t been there before. My hands trembled as I touched it, half-expecting it to unravel beneath my fingers—but it didn’t budge.

I spent hours examining myself in the mirror that day, searching for more stitches or signs of injury but finding none. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed—that something inside me had shifted in a way I couldn’t explain.


Two nights later, it happened again.

This time when I woke up, I wasn’t in my apartment anymore.

I was standing in what looked like an abandoned hospital corridor lit by flickering fluorescent lights overhead. The walls were lined with rusted metal panels streaked with blood and something darker—something alive that pulsed faintly beneath the surface like veins running through flesh.

The air smelled metallic and sour like old blood left to rot under fluorescent lights—a smell too familiar for comfort after years spent working in operating rooms filled with death’s aftermaths.

At first glance, the hallway seemed endless, stretching into darkness on both sides. The flickering lights overhead buzzed faintly, casting long, shifting shadows that danced across the walls. My breath came in shallow gasps as I tried to make sense of where I was—or *how* I had gotten there.  

I was barefoot, still wearing the tank top and sweatpants I’d gone to bed in. The cold linoleum floor sent shivers up my spine with every step I took. My first instinct was to call out for help, but something deep inside me—a primal, animal instinct—warned me to stay silent.  

I turned slowly, scanning my surroundings for any sign of an exit. That’s when I saw it: the operating table at the end of the corridor.

It was illuminated by a single spotlight hanging from the ceiling, its sterile metal surface gleaming faintly in the dim light. But it wasn’t empty.  

A figure lay on the table, motionless and covered by a bloodstained sheet. My stomach churned as I stepped closer, each footfall echoing unnaturally loud in the oppressive silence.  

“Don’t look,” I whispered to myself, my voice trembling. “Just turn around and find a way out.”  

But I couldn’t stop myself. Some invisible force pulled me forward until I was standing beside the table, staring down at what lay beneath the sheet.

With trembling hands, I reached out and pulled it back.

What I saw will haunt me for the rest of my life.

It was a body—or rather, several bodies stitched together into one grotesque form. The head belonged to a man in his forties, his eyes wide open and staring blankly at nothing. His torso was mismatched with arms of different sizes and skin tones attached at jagged seams that oozed dark fluid. The legs were similarly mismatched—one pale and thin, the other muscular and dark-skinned—but both were twisted at unnatural angles.

The stitching was precise—too precise. Whoever had done this wasn’t just skilled; they were obsessed.

My stomach lurched as bile rose in my throat. I stumbled back from the table, my mind racing with questions I didn’t want answered.

That’s when I heard it: a low, wet sound like fabric tearing apart.

I froze, my eyes darting back to the body on the table.

It moved.

The body’s head turned slowly toward me, its glassy eyes locking onto mine. Its mouth opened and closed soundlessly as if trying to speak, but all that came out was a guttural moan that sent chills down my spine.

Before I could react, the lights flickered violently, plunging the corridor into darkness for several agonizing seconds.

When they came back on, it was standing there.

The Flesh Stitcher.

It loomed over me like a nightmare made flesh—tall and impossibly thin, its body cloaked in surgical scrubs made of human skin stitched together with black thread. Its mask was even worse up close: a patchwork of faces sewn together into a grotesque parody of humanity. Some of the faces were fresh and pale; others were decayed and rotting, their empty eye sockets weeping dark fluid.

“You’ve come far,” it said without moving its mouth—a chorus of voices echoing directly in my mind.

I stumbled back against the wall, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst from my chest.

“Who… what are you?” I managed to choke out.

It tilted its head slightly as if amused by my question. “I am what you’ve always been searching for,” it said. “Perfection.”

Before I could respond, the walls around me began to shift and pulse like living tissue. Veins snaked across the surface, pumping thick black fluid that dripped onto the floor in slow rivulets. The air grew heavy with the stench of decay and blood as doors appeared along the corridor—doors made of flesh that twitched and quivered as if alive.

“This is your sanctuary,” The Flesh Stitcher said, gesturing to the grotesque landscape around us with one long-fingered hand. “A place where art is born.”

I shook my head violently, trying to deny what was happening. “This isn’t real,” I whispered to myself. “This can’t be real.”

But it *felt* real—the cold floor beneath my feet, the metallic taste of fear in my mouth, the weight of its gaze pressing down on me like a physical force.

“You’ve spent your life perfecting your craft,” it continued, stepping closer with slow, deliberate movements. “But you’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible.”

It gestured toward one of the doors nearby—a fleshy portal that pulsed faintly like a beating heart.

“Come,” it said. “See what lies beyond.”

Against every instinct screaming at me to run, my feet moved on their own as if guided by some unseen force. The door opened with a wet squelch as I approached, revealing another operating room bathed in sickly green light.

This one was worse than the last.

The walls were lined with shelves filled with jars containing severed limbs and organs suspended in murky fluid. In the center of the room stood another operating table—but this one wasn’t empty either.

A woman lay on it—alive but barely conscious—her body covered in stitches that crisscrossed her skin like a grotesque quilt. Her eyes fluttered open briefly as she saw me approach, and she let out a weak moan that sent shivers down my spine.

“Help… me…” she whispered before her head lolled to one side.

I turned back toward The Flesh Stitcher, rage bubbling up inside me despite my fear.

“You did this,” I spat through gritted teeth.

It nodded slowly as if proud of its work. “She is incomplete,” it said simply. “You will finish her.”

My blood ran cold as its words sank in.

“What?” I whispered hoarsely.

“You have been chosen,” it said again—a statement rather than an explanation. “Your hands are extraordinary—capable of creating beauty from chaos.”

It stepped closer until it was towering over me once more.

“Prove yourself,” it said softly but firmly. “Finish her… or become part of my next masterpiece.”
