 Female screams were heard in the middle of the night. The cops were called and sent to Mystic Maple Avenue. only to be met with an awful sight. Anna Evergreen, a 27-year-old woman, was found dead. Her house looked to be broken into yet nothing was missing. Anna was found with almost animal-like bite marks, burn marks, her scalp removed, her teeth in her stomach, and most shockingly, her jaw removed. Note: Wild animals like bears have not been seen in this town since the 1950s. Plus, DNA evidence shows that a bear was not responsible for the murder. but, oddly, it also shows up as not being human DNA.





When told about Anna's death, her family and even some friends said she was the sweetest girl in the world. But some of her friends state that two weeks before she died, she drugged a man, thinking it would be "fun." Some say she was too young and should have lived a long life. Others say she had it coming.

A 17-year-old boy called the police after finding a body; it was a 31-year-old man named Chad Woods. His body was found in the Silverwood Valley lake. He was found without a tongue, fingers removed, burn marks, missing lungs, feet removed, and no rib cage. His body was fresh, and the police noticed similarities between Chad's death and Anna's death. such as the bodies being found days apart, the horrific way the bodies were found, and the burn marks. The 17-year-old boy had an alibi and proof of not being the one at hand for these awful deaths, so he was ruled out as the murderer. 





When asked, friends of Chad stated that he was always a troublemaker. From stealing from stores to selling drugs, A week before his death, he set fire to a man's house when he was highly drunk. His bail was $100,000, but his mother got him out.

Many people have reported a 19-year-old girl running through the streets of Silverwood Vally, saying she was yelling for help and saying, "It's coming for me." Just days later, she was found dead. Oddly, this one seemed to be more simple. Her head was cut off, and she was yet again covered in burn marks. Her name was Amy West. At first, the police didn't think this was part of the pattern. until they saw the burn mark.





Friends of Amy state that she was a "bimbo," and she would go out, get drunk, and cheat on her boyfriend. One of the men with whom she slept was Chad West.

After the police asked around, they were pointed in the direction of a man named Alex Freeman. He was an ex-cop who dealt with cases like this. Saddly, when they got to his house, he was already gone. He was found in the bathtub. his arms and legs cut off, his face missing, his stomach floating in the tub with him, and again burn marks. He was 54 years old and had two daughters named Kelly and Lily.





Old friends of his state that he was an awful cope. saying he would turn a blind eye to real crime and arrest people for just looking at him weird. He was even one of the people who got drugs from Chad.

The murder cases have been going on for a few years now. Many officers thought it would be a good idea to drop it since there have not been any murders in a while. all but officer Jeffrey Greesham. He was working day and night to look for any leads. then he found it, or should I say HIM?





may/4/2001

Jeffrey went to a house in a small town named Gray Molly. where he questioned a man named Axel Myers. At first, Axel thought it was odd; he had never done anything wrong in his life. Well, that's what people thought.





"so axel."            

"yeah?"





"so, from my research you knew some of the people who were murdered a few years ago."



"some of? i knew ALL of them."





"what was your relationship with them?"





 "amy was a two-timing bitch, alex was a no good pig, who did nothing for his town, anna was a wanna be party girl who thought it was fun to hurt others, and chad...chad was a murder."



"wait. chad was a murderer?"





"yes...he was."



"care to explain?"



"no...."





"come on axel, we need this for the case. maybe someone chad knew could be the one who killed him and the others and we don't kno-"



"CHAD KILLED MY BESTFRIEND ALRIGHT?!"



"i see. can you continue?"





"It was 1991. My best was Franky Endwood. He was the greatest guy ever man. But at the time he was dating Amy, Officer Alex didn't like Amy since he thought she was a bad friend to his kid. So he would always find ways to get Franky and Amy into trouble. One night, when Franky went to a bar, he ended up getting drugged by Anna. Later, when he went home, he basically went into a coma from the drugs. That's when Chad came. He was drunk and set fire to Franky's house by mistake, but Franky didn't wake up. He died; he was gone."





"i am so sorry to hear that axel."



"as for the murders, i have a theory."



"go on."



"so after frankys death, i did anything to cope. and it got to the point where i did something old god loving people would say i'm going to hell for."





"okey?"



"i was getting into dark magic and witchy bullshit at the time, and well. i was reading books on how to bring back the dead. so one day i tried a spell an-"





"hold on son. you are telling me you, a guy who was probably 19years old when this happened, looked up magic stuff to bring your friend back, and you think that's what caused these murders?"



"no. i think the spell worked and franky is back as a demon or a ghost and he is killing the people who wronged him."



"son, if i wasn't an officer of the law and a nice guy, you would be smacked."





  "but it all makes sence. the burn marks? franky died in a fire. the victims? franky knew them all AND they wronged him in one way or another. the times of death? they were all after i tried that spell. IT ALL MAKES SENCE!"





"kid. i am sorry you lost your friend. but you are saying thing only a mad man or a creak head would say."





"you have to listen though! what if i'm right!? what if he is back?!"





  "it can't be true. because magic and witch craft, it's not real."





This was all the things said in the recording Jeff got while at Axel's house. Jeffrey had to leave the house because Axel was starting to throw a fit. He kept saying his theory could be right. But the question was, could it have been the answer all along?





may/30/2001

A woman named Lily came in with a horrific tale. On May 19, she got a look at the murderer, but it was not what they thought. She states that she walked in on her sister being murdered. Her sister was Kelly Freeman. She states in her repost, "I heard a sound from the kitchen one night, and when I went to see what it was, I saw my sister, dead on the ground. Thats when I spotted a tall, black, smokey being. It had white eyes, and it smelled like a campfire. I was so scared. when it saw me tilting its head, and it made an almost cheesy sound. I still don't know how I am alive after seeing that thing." They went back and forth about whether she was lying or not. but after a few tests, it showed that she was indeed telling the truth. saddly, just days later, she saddly passed away. not from murder, but from a heart attack in her sleep. 





june/3/2001

The story is everywhere. On the news and in the papers, people were going to every church just to ask for help, and every chatroom on the web was full of theories and questions. Axel's story was the most popular theory. It was everywhere; no one knew what to do or what was going on. Officer Jeffrey went back to talk to Axel since he was the one person who may have been right about all this. but when he got there, Axel was dead. But there was no sign of a struggle—no blood, no guts—and, oddly, no sign of a heart attack. As soon as his death was out, everyone made a theory, saying that since the being may have known Axel, he wanted to give Axel a peaceful death. But this brings up more questions: if the being was only killing those who wronged it, why would he kill Kelly and Axel? If the being is franky, it would make no sense. Kelly was the daughter of Alex Freeman. Yes, but she only knew Franky. and Axel was his best friend.

present day.  The murders have never stopped. but all the victims are related to the victims in the past. To this day, no one knows who is causing these murders. Many believe it was Franky and that he was the shadowy, smokey being that Lily reported. but we may never know. As of right now, my research on this case is not done. I have tried to talk to the officer, Jeffrey, but unfortunately, he has not answered any of my emails. I will keep looking for more clues. and I won't stop until I find the murderer. or even better, I find Franky and put him to rest. but as of late, I have been smelling smoke. and I have been seeing a shadowy figure. If I didn't know any better, I would say it's franky, but I don't believe in ghosts. But in the back of my head, I keep wondering, What if it is true? What if Franky was the murderer? What if he was the dark figure? What if the axel was right? Most of all, what if I'm next on Franky's list? if my research stops and I am heard from. Well, Franky will have another name off his list.
