So I want to start off this post by saying I am not making any of this up or dramatizing it in any way to make it more interesting, this is literally what happened and has been happening with 2 of my 3 dogs for a while now.

So I understand that many people believe their dog understands what they’re saying, and I understand that dogs can learn certain words and what they mean and interpret your tone, but this takes it to another level. i’ve been a dog owner my entire life, have had several dogs, and I’ve never experienced something so bizarre. 

I currently own 3 Shiba Inus, all age 2. We always joked that one of our female dogs was a Skinwalker because when you talk to her, it seems like she responds based on what you say, but it’s been getting weirder and weirder. Obviously, my dogs understand my cute dog voice, and when I’m speaking in a playful tone, but I am convinced my dogs are able to understand full sentences now.

The first example I will give you is not so weird, but it was odd. This was the dog me and my wife joke is a Skinwalker and she is extremely attached to me, there’s something about the way she looks at me and reacts to what I say that just seems very human. One day she got in a fight with her brother, and my wife separated the fight while I wasn’t there and ended up getting bit by her, redirected aggression, and it was a very gnarly injury. 

This dog is never aggressive towards us, and adores me. She has never growled at me, has never bitten me or showed any inch of aggression or discontent towards me. The day after this incident, I had this dog sitting next to me looking at me while I talked to it, I have a habit of talking to the dogs like they’re people, maybe I’m crazy. I was looking her in the eyes and petting her ears, and I told her in a playful, doggy voice, which she normally smiles when I talk to her like that, but I told her:

 -“I love you, but if you ever bite my wife again, I will kill you”. I obviously didn’t mean it, and I was saying it in a cute doggy voice, but immediately when I said that, the dog stopped smiling, closed her mouth, turned her face, looked at me and puffed. She then proceeded to step away from me, walking backwards like she was afraid of what I said. I have never seen this dog have this reaction with me, she has never been scared of me, I have never seen this dog have this reaction over any situation or anything I say. She is very obedient, and extremely loving. The reaction was instant, and I will never forget the way she turned her face and looked me dead in the eye and puffed after what I said. she’s always smiling with her mouth open, and usually seems completely oblivious about everything around her, she’s just a very happy dog, to see her immediately react to my words in that way was the most bizarre thing.

One of my other dogs, is a large male. This is a very aggressive dog, I’ve worked with him since he was a puppy to try to fix the aggression and train him. I would never give him away, because I know he will bite the new owner And will end up in a shelter and eventually getting killed. So I have accepted that while he is also very loving, he has his boundaries and I respect them. This dog is extremely intelligent since he was a puppy. he is able to open locked crates with his mouth, open doors, he learned commands like sit stay lay down fetch when he was only 3-4 months old, I have videos of him on TikTok performing tricks, and practicing these commands flawlessly when he was only three months old.

 I Had labradors in the past, they were also very obedient and smart, but they did not learn commands like these until later in life. This dog has always had very human expressions and reactions. He is a very quiet dog, doesn’t bark or make any noise, doesn’t really sit with you or want to ever snuggle, but he’s always around staring at you. This is a common thing for this breed, they are very catlike, in the sense that they are always around you even if they’re not necessarily with you. There has been more than one instance where I have woken up at night, and the dog was staring at me while I slept, I would get up to go say hi to him and he would walk away.

 This dog, however, although large and strong and quite aggressive, is also quite timid and scared of everything, especially bugs. Shiba Inu are famous for being dogs that don’t bark, they are famous for screaming, if you have never heard this breed scream, you can look it up on YouTube, they scream like a human. There has been more than one instance where I have woken up at night, afraid because it sounds like someone is screaming in my kitchen, it sounds like a human, but it’s only him screaming because he’s afraid of some bug, and after I kill it, he chills out. 

This dog did something today that really freaked me out. He was laying outside and when he saw me, he rolled his belly up like he wanted to be pat. I am always careful when I pet this dog because he will randomly snap sometimes, he’s not very well adjusted. He’s the type of dog that you will be petting, and all of a sudden he freaks out and seems like he’s about to bite you. Usually, when this happens, the dog will avoid me or my wife for days, and just be scared. He seems to regret snapping at us, you can tell he feels remorse, but he will be shy for several days and not want to come near us for seemingly no reason. One thing is for sure, if your energy is not right, he will try to bite you. 

There have been periods of my life where me and this dog didn’t have a good relationship because I was afraid of him, so I would start petting him, and slowly expect him to bite me and be afraid, and the dog would clearly pick up on that nervousness and would do exactly that. I have learned that if I pet him and I trust him and have no fear he will not do that and will be at ease and smile. (I wish I could attach a picture of him smiling here, its freaky). This is a very sensitive dog that picks up on your energy and feelings, if you are even slightly scared of him, he will pick up on that and be aggressive. If you’re not, he is quite sweet.

As I was saying, today, I went to pet the dog while it was outside and I was playing with him. I playfully brushed my hands against his ears and slightly tickled them, this caused the dog to violently snap, he didn’t bite me or anything, but snapped and backed away. After this when I would try to pet the dog again, he would growl at me and avoid me. I tried grabbing his toy and throwing it for him, which he normally is extremely excited about, he ignored it. I tried giving him his favorite treat, he ignored it, and showed his fangs to me. Every time I would talk to him or make a cute doggy voice, he would look away, avoiding eye contact at all costs. 

He just sat in a corner of the kitchen and didn’t want to go outside anymore, so I opened his crate and allowed him some privacy, he immediately ran into the crate. This is a dog that is very smart, but is also very disobedient. The dog is capable of doing just about any trick or command you ask of him if there is some sort of treat involved, or some sort of reward. But he will often pretend like he doesn’t understand you or ignores you when you want him to do things that he doesn’t feel like doing, he will often puff and complain back at you if you want him to do something he doesn’t want, such as coming inside, or going into his crate. If you command him to go into his crate, and he doesn’t feel like it, he will scream at you similar to what a husky does and it almost sounds like he’s saying no, but if you say that if he goes in, you will give him a treat, even if youre not holding one, he will immediately do what you’re saying, so he obviously understands everything you’re saying, but chooses not to do it. 

If this dog is in his crate, you open it and invite him outside, he will always come out, especially if you open the backyard door, he will always want to go outside. After the incident today, he ran into his crate and curled into a ball facing away from me and went to sleep. I gave it somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes, and opened his crate, the dog didn’t move or look at me. I started speaking with him in a playful, doggy voice tone, and told him to come out, and I would give him a treat, he completely ignored me still with his head down facing away from me in a way I couldn’t even see his head, curled in a ball. I tried addressing him in a stern voice and commanded him to come out of the crate, he ignored me. I started speaking with him, as if he was a human, with the same tone I would use to address a person. I specifically said:

 -“ buddy, Im sorry if I hurt you, I didn’t know your ear was hurting. I wonder if you have an ear infection or something, I didn’t mean to hurt you, Let’s see if I can take you to the vet this week and we can do something about it. I love you and I’m sorry”. The moment I got done saying this, the dog slowly lifted his head and turned it towards me in a very strange manner, the closest thing I can compare this to would be how an owl turns its head without moving its body. The way he did it was honestly creepy and got me instantly spooked. He looked me deep in the eyes for a second and then got up. He gets out of his crate slowly without ever breaking eye contact and walks towards me. The dog then gently touches his nose against mine and begins licking my face, then my arms, and then finally becomes playful, out of nowhere. Keep in mind when something like this happens the dog will normally be afraid and avoid you for a month, but I was suddenly forgiven just like that. 

I let him out to go play after this, and noticed my female was looking at me. So I told her: -“I love you too baby, very much”. Dog then proceeds to blink 3 times in a row rapidly looking at me… they do this thing where if you blow them a kiss they blink looking at you to acknowledge the affection, so it was interesting she did that. We often as a joke ask her if she is a skin walker and she will often bark at us in response, its quite funny. Another interesting fact is me and my wife are Brazilian, so we only speak portuguese in the house, how ever, the dogs only have these weird reactions if we talk to them in english, portuguese they dont seem to understand at all.

The 3rd dog who was not mentioned doesn’t have any of these odd behaviors, shes just a normal pup.

These are recent examples, but stuff like this happens all the time, I sometimes wonder if theres a person stuck in those dogs. Sorry if this is not the most interesting or creepy story, its because its real and im not dramatizing it in any way. I am not able to attach a photo of my dogs creepy smile here, but if you go on my profile I made this post on a different group that allows pictures and you can see him.
