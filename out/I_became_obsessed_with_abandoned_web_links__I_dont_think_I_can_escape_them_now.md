I’ve always had a sort of weird sentimentality towards undiscovered media and artists.  Sometimes someone really, really puts their all into a story- a painting- a song- whatever- but it just never really gets seen or heard.  They bleed their mind onto pages or recordings; but just picked the wrong week or the wrong hour or the wrong venue and no one really notices it.  Hell, even some of those we consider to be among the greatest creators of all time (Poe, Van Gogh) died in poverty and were discovered posthumously.

I guess that’s what started my hobby of hunting for obscure websites and other niche digital collections.  My ex girlfriend used to try to find handmade books that people had stapled together at thrift stores or library repositories; saying she wanted to peer into the “cooky” minds of the people who made them.  I suppose I tried the same thing with the internet.

You have to get off the beaten path to find some really bizarre and eccentric stuff, though, and I don’t mean the deep web.  You have to find fan recreations of dead online games or long abandoned forums/image boards with like, maybe two dozen active users.  The video game avenue is probably the most promising, but it can’t be a popular video game- it has to be something that maybe had a small cult following in its prime, and that some dedicated IT guy has recreated on a server in his basement in Poland.  Bonus points if it has a forum with an off topic board.

Recreations of old playstation 1 and early ps2 games are generally a goldmine; the same can be said for the gamecube and early wii titles.  The PC games can be very hit or miss, and the early xbox titles generally lack any real… soul, to get that sort of following (other than that one Kenobi game).  Handheld consoles aren’t really worth trying to delve too far into, rom hacks for those are exceptionally easy and most searches will lead you to those- but a few older gameboy games may yield a thread or two.

Sorry.  That was a long winded rant.  I just wanted to leave a roadmap of how I started this journey, and how I’ve now arrived at its unfortunate end.

The first really interesting and promising link I found was on a page discussing Billy Blaze’s Rescue Adventure for the Gameboy Advance- or the off topic forum for it.  Some guy had found a really odd website and felt a need to share it- the name was something to the effect of “happy glass unraveling” with a long series of numbers and random letters after, dot com.

The site looked like a time capsule to the 90s internet.  It had a garish rust orange background and tons of rainbow or hyper saturated clip art titles for blog posts, and generally looked like someone had vomited paint onto the page.  The structuring of the blog was minimalist- simple, strict chronological order.  Most of the posts contained only one or two images and a few lines of text.

The blog portrayed over a decade’s worth of a man named Scott shattering glass against a cinderblock building and the shards amassing into a larger and larger pile.  It was always clear, non reflective glass (he seemed to prefer mason jars), and the captions would usually be something to the effect of “another good pattern today!”, or, “disappointing fragments this evening, but still keeping to the good work.”

Sometimes he would have photos with presumed friends or family and himself in the frame, usually when he was gifted with a “large haul” to shatter.  He was a lanky and pale skinned man with curly blonde hair and wire frame glasses, and always seemed to be exceptionally well dressed for someone who spent a lot of time outdoors throwing glass at a wall.  He had pearly white teeth and a charismatic and genuine smile in the photos that did include him, and his friends seemed happy for him (albeit confused) as they posed with stacks of mason jars and window panes.

Ultimately, he seemed like a nice enough guy with an odd hobby but the passion he put into it was hard to look away from.  Sometimes he would post long winded rants that were entirely esoteric and bordered on being religious sermons- usually about the profanity of stained glass and the necessary recreation of the “shattered” by fracturing purity until the pattern was once again entirely pure.  There would be a random bible verse here or there, or a quote ripped from Plato or other mainstream philosophers- even mathematical axioms- but they never really connected or went anywhere.  It was one man’s mental gymnastics, but damn if they weren’t fascinating to read.

There was no way to contact him, no tip jar, and no ads on the website.  He funded this domain solely because he wanted to, and he posted at least once every two or three weeks.  Me and maybe the fifteen other people who checked into it were enraptured.

He was the first, but not the last.  I dug deeper.  Crawled through forums, the wayback machine, long, long “necro’d” topics.  I’d hit f12 to comb through metadata as if I were playing an ARG.  Most of the time I found long dead links and domains that went nowhere.  After that, a lot of poorly made porn, and a lot of spam.

Sometimes I’d find a gem like happy glass unraveling, though.  Anti-communities of people obsessing over the proper way to cook tree bacon.  A vlogger who was trekking the eastern Siberian wilderness in relative obscurity seeking a forgotten god’s temple.  A decorative, and competitive, wheelbarrow community (on a nintendogs fan site, of all things).

Then there were the actual cults or criminals.  I happened upon one just in the periphery of a site and I immediately started being more cautious- VPN, proxies, virtual machines- but I couldn’t stop.  I couldn’t look away, now.  It was as though I was discovering long lost continents in the sea of the internet.

You didn’t post about the cults or drug syndicates if you were smart.  No need to spoil the ball for everyone else, or make yourself a target, but we all appreciated whatever village idiot would do so on an off topic Yugioh - the Forbidden Memories thread, and suddenly several random people from Wyoming and Vietnam and Argentina are now casually reading a Bohemian manifesto about human sacrifice or plans to move kilograms of fentanyl across a border.  It evoked that same childlike excitement one had when you eavesdropped on an adult conversation or snuck a look at the teacher’s planner- you were suddenly privy to an entire world of secrets you were never meant to be.

As I said, I was cautious.  I was careful.  I suppose this post is going against that but… I have to tell someone.  I’m sorry.

It was on a play station one “lucky luke” (a cowboy game) forum off topic where I found one users novella length post detailing every obscure website they’d been to, and general reviews.  Between each site was word salad and incomprehensible raving, and long series of digits that I assumed could only be metadata.  The user was clearly severely mentally ill, but the post was credible- some of the websites were ones I knew of.  At the very, very end of it though, was a single sentence without any url or information.  It simply read: “The bald man and the sea.  Caution advised.  I’m sorry.”

It read as a bad pun, and I chuckled a little at it, but given the deranged nature of the post, I was intrigued.  Cursory searches turned up what you would expect- instagram selfies of bald men at the beach.  But the various numbers he’d included in the post were… useful.  Hexadecimal.  They led to a long abandoned image board where another user had described finding an extremely disturbing livestream that he called “The Seaside Caledonian Cannibal.”  

It took a few more weeks- work got in the way and I had little to go off of- but I found the page.  It was a page with a light yellow background and livestream footage in a small square box from- what I’ve since surmised- was being filmed on an eastern coast of New Caledonia.

The footage was grainy, to say the least.  It looked as though the livestream was coming from a 2007 flip phone, or as if it were from a PS2 game.  It still portrayed more than enough to be viscerally unsettling.

The scene showed a tropical beach with gently lapping waves beside a sand pit.  In the pit sat at impossibly tall human- I can’t say for certain, but based on the surroundings and other humans I’d see in the video, he had to be somewhere between 13 and 15 feet tall.  He was usually sat cross legged, and wearing what seemed to be a leather skirt and nothing else.  He was a dark skinned man with broad shoulders and a pot belly and he was completely bald, but had bright blue eyes.

And he wore a necklace of severed fingers, toes, genitalia, and eyeballs that reached to his navel.  Yeah.  Seeing that is when I realized his kilt was tanned human flesh.

The worst part, though, was that he had a person in his lap.  A korean man with torn clothing and shattered glasses and short black hair was laid across his legs.  His body was riddled with holes to the point of looking like a wasp’s nest. 

I was nauseous seeing this, but couldn’t look away- and soon learned the source of the punctures.  The large man had a sharpened, hollowed out reed that he used like a straw.  He would periodically dip the man’s body into the incoming waves, letting salt water flood it, and then would stab the reed into him and slurp loudly.  

That was it.  That was the entire livestream.  Horrifyingly, his victim was somehow still alive and would shudder and try to cry from long destroyed eyes from the pain, only for the large man to tenderly stroke his hair and to rub his back as though he were soothing a frightened child.  Bones and rotting organs lay around the duo, so it was obvious this wasn’t his first victim by any means.  Periodically, he would take a deep sip of the oceanwater and then toss the man aside, stand, disrobe and pleasure himself on camera, then resume normally as if nothing odd had occurred.

I want to say I never went back to the page, but I couldn’t look away.  I wanted to believe it was a hoax- and at first, I did!  How could his phone battery last indefinitely?  How could a man this size even exist?

In my gut, though, I knew it was horrifyingly real.  Over time I noticed that, in the sand near the camera, a phrase was scribbled in French.  It read “prions are power”.  I don’t like to think about the implication of that.

On one livestream a crab crawled up to the duo, and the man crushed it with his fist and began eating it raw, occasionally “baby birding” pieces of chewed meat to the poor victim in his lap.

After far, far too many days- weeks, even- the man died.  

I tried to tell authorities but was dismissed as a prank caller.  I tried to find the specific beach on google maps, but, even when I found similar beaches, they were usually shown as lovely tourist or environmental areas, and there were no reports whatsoever of violence or missing people in the vicinity.

After the man died the large man spent several days weeping and wailing and throwing himself belly first into the sea and rolling in the tide and the sand, beating on his chest in absolute agony as he screamed at the sky.  Any waterfowl or crab that drew near he violently maimed, and returned to sobbing.

And then he saw me.

I don’t know how, but I know he did.  He looked directly into the camera- into my eyes- and pointed at me, and made a beckoning motion with his hand.  And then he smiled.  It wasn’t an evil grin or smirk- it was genuine happiness, as though someone had returned a long lost pet to him, and he at once seemed good spirited again.

I haven’t been back to the website, and I refuse to, but I now know why the poster said he was sorry, and why it was his last post.  The compulsion to tell others what you saw is the first symptom.

And then fate bends to ship you off to your doom.  I see him in my dreams.  I see his silhouette in the mirror.  My computer keeps redirecting me to his page and I see him sitting, smiling, patiently waiting.  

I work as a flight attendant.  I’ve been asked to go to New Caledonia.  I haven’t responded.  I went to the grocery store and bought enough food to last for weeks and boarded up my apartment door; but I know somehow, someway, I’ll end up on that livestream.  And for telling all of you about this- I’m sorry.
