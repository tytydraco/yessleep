I thought I was living alone today I found out I was wrong

About a month ago, I left my parents' house to live on my own. I am a 23-year-old male who just finished my last year of university. I studied education and became a teacher with the help of some friends. During my time at university, I was fortunate enough to have my parents living on the same side of the city, which made it easier for me to find a place to stay. I saved up enough money during this time to rent a house for myself until I could afford to buy one.

When I was searching for a house, I contacted a young man who was renting out a small 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom house. This was perfect for me as I was going to be living alone. I called him to express my interest, and he informed me that I could move in that same week, which I was very happy about.

When I arrived at the house on a moving day
the owner was there to greet me and show me around. As we got into the house we made our way to the room I would be in. I noticed the walls had holes and other damage in them this did not affect me as I am not paying much to stay at the house anyway. 

When we got to the basement door I was asked to not enter the basement as there were some personal belongings down there that he did not want in the hands of a stranger. I was fine with this as I had no reason to go down anyways as all my stuff would be on the upper part of the house. With this, the owner left so I could make it my own.

That night I got to bed early as I had work in the morning. Throughout the night I was woken up at around 1:33 AM this was odd to me as I didn't know shag had waken me up. The room was silent as I tried closing my eyes again. Right as I did this I heard a faint screeching sound. This made me open my eyes again going to the window to see if someone down the street had been screaming. As I looked outside I saw nothing and went quiet to see if I could hear it again. Again I heard the sound which now seemed to be underneath me. This was both confusing and scary to me as I was the only one in that house and there should be no one else here. I waited for a bit more and heard nothing. With this, I locked the bedroom door and went back to bed. In the morning as I was getting ready I felt as if I was being watched by someone. I just chalked it up to my mind playing tricks on me from the night before.

As I was leaving the house I glanced towards the basement door and saw it was cracked open. Odd I remember it being closed the night before. I didn't think about it and left the house worried about being late. After a long day and a few extra hours at the school marking assignment, I got home at around 8. When I came inside I saw the basement door was now shut. This instantly set off alarms in my head as I hadn't shut it before work. I decided to go look and see if anything was down there.

I reached the top of the stairs and went to turn off the lights. To my surprise, all I heard was the sound of a click and no light. I got my phone out and turned the flashlight on. Slowly I walked down the stairs and saw all the owner's stuff he had told me about. What caught my eye wasn't any furniture it was a pile of pictures in what looked like a star with a circle around it. As I approached I saw myself in the photos. My face turned white instantly as I realized these were all me. There had to be at least 100 photos of me sleeping and moving my stuff into the house and the owner left. As I was looking I heard a little click sound as I was blinded by a bright light from the corner of the room.

I turned around and quickly as possible ran up the stairs and threw a chair in front of the stairs. I flew back as I heard someone sprint up the stairs and then start scratching at the door screaming like some sort of demon. I ran up to my room calling the owner on the way to find out what was happening. No answer I looked at my phone and tried again. This time I was sent right to voicemail. This made me more worried than before as now, I believe that thing was the owner. About a minute later I got a message that read you were supposed to stay out of the basement. Right as I read the message another flash lit up my bedroom, I was horrified as I saw it come from a hole in the wall. 

This made me scream and call 911. The operator told me to hide in the bathroom in case the owner got out of the basement. I did as they said and went to hide in the tub. Sometimes though sitting there the lights went out and did the call as I can only assume the power was cut off by the owner. While the lights were off I could hear him crawling around the walls dreading the sound of the camera going off through another hole again. Thankfully this didn't happen before the police arrived and searched the house. No one was ever found in that house but there was blood around what I believe was a sacrifice which the police took in for testing. All I can think about is what happened to the owner where he is now and what would have happened if he caught me before the police arrived. I have still been hard with nothing about the blood samples but I am currently off work and living with my parents again until I am ready to leave.
