Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other

October 21st, 1993

The hum of the Rust Bucket's engine is a constant, grating buzz against the drumming in my ears. This isn't the usual low thrum of road trip anticipation; it's the high-pitched whine of anxiety, a sound that's become far too familiar these past few days. The meds help, or are supposed to, but lately it's like trying to quell a forest fire with a garden hose.

I initiated the ruse this morning. The Bulletin Board System, bless its digital heart, allowed me to reach Soror XI with some carefully crafted prose. I framed my message as a desperate plea, a confession of impending mental collapse. \[Three-week sabbatical,\] I typed, my fingers clicking against the keyboard in a nervous rhythm. \[Need to…regroup. Reassess. My mind… it feels like a broken radio, tuning into too many frequencies at once.\] I threw in a few dramatic ellipses for good measure.

The truth, of course, is only partially there. Yes, I feel it, the familiar clawing at the edges of my sanity. But it's not the breakdown she imagines, at least not yet. It's the sheer weight of what I've been uncovering, the unnerving puzzle pieces that have been falling into place – or not falling into place – these past days. What I'm feeling is a pressing need to address the situation at hand.

Soror XI, bless her rigid, bureaucratic soul, bought it hook, line, and sinker. She responded immediately, her message a flurry of concern wrapped in her typical clipped tone. \[Jim,\] she wrote. \[Your request is approved. We will air re-runs of your broadcast to maintain the schedule. Focus on your well-being. Really. This time off will do you a world of good.\] That last part was almost gentle, which, coming from her, is practically a hug. A hug that made me feel like a scoundrel for lying- for using my mental illness to manipulate. But I needed this, needed the freedom to move without scrutiny. She's probably relieved, I think, that I seem to have finally dropped the line of questioning pertaining to the previous Saturday's broadcast.

Leaving Scrimbus was like shedding a skin. I packed my faithful Datsun with the usual gear – camera, recording equipment, my expensive laptop with satellite link – and threw in a couple of weeks' worth of supplies. I drove east first, heading towards Anson. I needed to see Manny, needed to have a closer look at those photos that sparked the initial alarm when he called me at four in the damned morning.

The meeting with Manny at the gas station where we first met was brief and tense. He handed me the envelope containing the photos without a word, his eyes darting around like he expected someone to emerge from the shadows. The images were more disturbing up close, particularly the ones on I-35 right outside Waxahachie. The blurred, indistinct symbols, the unnatural distortion of light; all of it reinforced my belief that this was tied into the anomalies that wormed their way into my show. He also had another photo, one of the figure I had seen on my live broadcast, but this one was much clearer, with the distinctive red robes and pointy capriote as plain as could be.

The drive towards Waxahachie felt wrong somehow, a feeling that seemed to gather like static electricity around me. I kept glancing in the rearview mirror, the red-tinted lenses of my spectacles distorting the road and the sky into something vaguely sinister. I stopped at a truck stop in Thurber about halfway, the kind with greasy burgers and stale coffee. I needed to eat and get gas (Hah! Fart joke. Don't judge. I need to find amusement where I can.). The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, a discordant harmony to the anxiety gnawing at my insides. I was just digging into my meal, having applied a generous amount of A1 sauce to my burger when a payphone on the wall next to the john began to ring.

It's for me again. I know it. I hesitated, a strange sense of dread prickling my skin. But the ringing persisted, insistent, and I found myself reaching for the receiver.

"Hello?" My voice sounded tight, even to my own ears.

A frantic voice crackled on the other end, a voice I recognized immediately. "Jim, it's Suzie! They're everywhere! NAORC, they're all over Santa Fe! They're like... like cockroaches, crawling all over the place! And... and... " Her voice broke, a choked sob cutting through the static. "This has never happened previously; they're everywhere!" And then the line went dead. Previously, she said... like the unfolding events were a movie she'd seen many times before. Was she watching the director's cut this time?

I stood there, the phone receiver still pressed to my ear, the grease in my fries instantly congealed. New Mexico. NAORC. This wasn't some isolated incident; this was a coordinated movement, a deliberate breach, and Suzie had just confirmed what I feared all along: that this wasn't just about the 'Other' presence. It was something far bigger, something far more insidious. The NAORC were never this bold in the past, usually sticking to their cloak-and-dagger routine. They are tenuous allies to the EOTO, but their goals are, to say the least, sinister.

My heart hammered against my ribs, each beat a frantic drum against the rising tide of panic. I couldn't go to Waxahachie. Not now. I needed to see what was happening in Santa Fe. I needed to meet this mysterious Suzie. I slammed the receiver back into its cradle, my mind racing, calculating. I grabbed my things, my appetite suddenly gone. The greasy burger remained half-eaten on the table, a monument to my abruptly derailed plans.

I was back in the Rust Bucket within minutes, the engine roaring as I tore out of the parking lot, heading west. The road was a blur, the landscape flashing by in a dizzying rush. The anxiety was still there, but it was now laced with a cold, focused rage. My hand tightened around the steering wheel, the ouroboros ring on my right hand feeling like a burning brand. The EOTO had taken me in, given me purpose, and I'll be damned if all they've done for me has gone to waste, even if they secretly knew something was going down.

It was well past sunset when I crossed the state line. The sign read: "Welcome to New Mexico, Land of Enchantment." But there was no enchantment here, only a chilling sense of foreboding. As I drove onwards into the vast expanse of the New Mexico dark, I glanced in the rearview mirror. There, for just a fleeting second, was a glimpse of something that made my blood run cold; a red figure, robed and indistinct, standing at the edge of the darkness behind me, its very presence an echo of the chilling image from my broadcast. I could feel its gaze on me, and it sent a shiver down my spine. It could just be a trick of the dim lighting, or the exhaustion of the long drive. But I knew one thing, without a shadow of a doubt; I wasn't alone.

And whatever this 'thing' was, whatever its purpose, had followed me to New Mexico.
