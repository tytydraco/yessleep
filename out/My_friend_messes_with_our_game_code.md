I (21 M) Collage student had started a personal project with my collage roommate. We had decide to make a Oblivion clone since all he brought with him was his Xbox 360 with him and we sent nights upon nights playing the fantasy games he had.

Karter (I know who the fuck names their kid Karter with a K) had gone for 3d modeling and I went for Javascript programming. For my final project I made a game engine and my professor liked it. I had nothing to do with it and showed Karter. He told me "Hey I've been making some models based on the weird rpg shit. Maybe they'll export nice" I thought about it and agreed then holy shit it worked. Then me and Karter had the same idea.

We started devlopment at the start of summer. He did things like models, writing, and animation. While I was our code monkey and co-writer. Our devlopment was great but he's been fucking with our code.

First it was things like naming events (a signal from one script to another) edgy things like "Bloody Stabbing" (It was to trigger an event between a guard and thief having a duel) and "Child Hanging" (I don't know where the hell this came from. The event was to trigger a cutscene where the player hangs up some trinkets to ward off demons for town members)

But I didn't mind. Hell sometimes it was funny. I chalked this up to him getting board and messing with me playfully. But then I read a devlog from him... I was surprised and read "Fixed - Clipping through stairs on castle. Fixed - Duplication Glitch with gnome trader. Added - 3 misc Villager NPC models" I instantly called him because he never knew how to code or really do something like that.

*Me: Dude... when did you learn to code*

*Karter: I... had more time I guess*

*Me: Karter I talked to you last night... You never showed any interest in doing the programming work. I thought I'd be our code monkey*

*Karter: \*Pill bottle rattling\* Well... had... enegry I guess... \*End call\**

I herd the pill rattling but just ignored it. I knew Karter took Anti Depressants. He's been on them for as long as I knew the dude. But I pressed on. My summer was simple. Vacation to Florida and then back to Missouri, met those family you never herd of, and made myself look like paper with sunscreen. But during this Karter kept doing things like adding locations (a dungeon, jail, tavern, and boss area), adding models, and textures. Things he knew.

But when it was time for collage I went to an apartment that Karter said we'd room in for the year and... he wasn't there. I wander till I reach the basement steps. I see him infront of a computer with 2 perscriptions off to the side, and programming. I tap him and he removes his headphones

*Me: Karter?.. what the hell are you doing in our basement?*

*Karter: What... Can't a man have peace?*

*Me: No no no... I mean... this is odd...*

*Karter: Don't worry fit as a fiddle. Once classes start I'll be back to it*

*\*Karter goes back to programming and such. I leave\**

Now if you're confused as to why I ask you to help is this. Karter hasn't left the basement for 12 weeks. Never came up. He won't talk to me unless it's devlogs. His updates become weirder. You know how he is the writer for our game. He started obsessing over this lore about a relgion about a god who slashes himself in two to make day and good so that the evil stuck world will have balance. Also every devlog includes "Removed: Unsplit" or "Removed: D.Portal"

Now I am scared but he's started to buy things... He asks me to bring them down to him. They're all heavy and metal sounding. I set them at the bottom of the steps and normally leave. The basement too dark to see him or his pc.

My friend has finally left his room in the middle of the night with a note "Dear James, Left for classes from Sir Eric" I got confused and he left a photo... it's him... in a knight costume sword and all. But his body looked broken... his bones too thin for the really heavy metals... but the thing is he left with a sword...

What do I do reddit? I'll give an update later.
