It’s been almost a year since we moved into this house, and our lease is finally up in August. It’s July now, and we’re already counting down the days like inmates etching marks into concrete. One more month. Just one more month.

We’re not well off. One vehicle. Three daughters. Both of us work full-time in retirement communities... steady work, decent pay, no fancy degrees required, just certifications and annual trainings. It’s honest work. Hard work. You see things in those places... things that make you question how alone we ever really are.

I wouldn’t say I believe in ghosts. Not like the ones on TV. But I believe some things linger. Energy. Grief. Regret. Call it what you want.

Whatever this house has? It’s not just energy. And it’s not just lingering.

This is the first time I’ve felt the kind of dread that makes me pull all three of my kids into bed with me, turn the lights on, and stay up listening. Not for burglars. Not for storms.

But for the quiet.

Let me back up.

Last summer, we had a shot to leave the trailer park. We were paying too much for too little... duct-taped windows, bob wire fencing to keep the dog in, tarps nailed over the roof to stop leaks during monsoon... Then we saw this place... actual drywall, fenced-in yard, walking distance from a good school, and only a couple hundred more than what we were already struggling to make work.

A house with a garage. A mounted microwave. Central AC (the switch from a swamp cooler to central AC in the southern Arizona summer was bliss.) Every detail felt like winning the lottery.

I cried the first night we moved in. The kids were so excited. Running around, picking rooms, amazed by little things like closet doors that actually closed. I told them this was a fresh start. Something better. A step up.

That first week was a blur of moving boxes and adjusting. Then, one night, my youngest, she was eight then, came into our room pale as a sheet.

She didn’t cry. Didn’t scream. Just stood by the bed and said, “The Red Man was watching me.”

Now, I’m a mom. I’ve got three kids. I know nightmares. I know growing pains and too-scary cartoons. I chalked it up to the new house making weird shadows.

“The house is just settling,” I told her. “Old pipes, new creaks. You’ll get used to it.”

She curled up next to me and didn’t argue.

I didn’t think about it again until three nights later when our middle daughter came out of her room crying. She’d wet the bed. Said she was too scared to move.

“What scared you?” I asked.

She shook her head. “I don’t want to say it. It hears when we talk about it.”

At this point, I still thought it was just kid stuff. Transition stress. Maybe the younger one said something and the middle one latched onto it. Still, I made a note to keep their bedroom door open at night.

But that same week, I heard it.

It was nearly midnight. My partner and I were watching a movie on the couch. We paused it, no idea why. Just that shared look between people who both sense something’s off. That’s when we heard it. Footsteps.

Slow. Heavy. Walking above us.

There is no second story in this house. Just the attic.

We looked at each other, both waiting for the other to say it first.

“Maybe it’s an animal?” I whispered.

But we both knew it wasn’t. It was steps. Deliberate. Human.

She checked on the girls. All asleep. Nothing disturbed.

We tried to sleep after that, but it didn’t feel like the house was ours anymore. Not really.

In the months that followed, it was little things. Lights flickering. Garage door slamming even when latched. The hallway mirror cracked from the inside somehow. Our dog, a sweet, gentle mutt, stopped going near the laundry room completely. That’s where the attic access is.

She trembles when we open that door. Once, I tried coaxing her in with a treat. She pissed herself and bolted.

And always- always - it starts with the silence. You don’t notice how loud the world is until it stops. The fridge hum. The fan. The wind. Even the cars from the main road. Gone. Like someone pressed mute on reality.

And then the smell.

Metallic. Burnt. Like pennies roasted in the sun. It hits you all at once and settles in the back of your throat. The smell always follows the silence.

Two weeks ago, I caught something in the hallway vent above the girls’ door. Just movement. A flicker. We keep the lights on at night now, but those old vents are like slatted plastic windows between rooms. They shouldn’t show anything, not upward. But I saw something cross over it. Like something was on the ceiling. On the wrong side.

Last night was the worst.

The girls had all come into our room on their own, without being asked. No screaming. Just quietly standing there like they’d decided something was safer with us. I let them pile into bed, pulled the blankets over, turned the fan on low.

I stayed up, listening.

Then the silence hit.

The fan stopped.

The streetlight outside flickered and went black.

And the smell rolled in.

All three girls were breathing fast. Pretending to sleep. I knew it. I could feel it. Then my youngest whispered, so soft I almost didn’t hear it:

“He’s in the vent again.”

I didn’t sleep after that. None of us did.

There’s only a few weeks left on this lease. We can’t afford to break it early. And even if we could, I don’t know that it would matter. I don’t know if this thing is tied to the house… or if it’s noticed us.

I’m not sure how to protect my kids from something I can’t see. Can’t fight. Can barely explain.

But every night now, I sit in bed with them. Lights on. Fan running.

And I wait for the silence.

Because that’s when I know he’s listening.






**Edit Note**

The original version mentioned four kids. To clarify: I have three daughters who live with me full-time. My stepdaughter is sixteen and lives with her mom in another city. We used to have her every other weekend, but she’s only visited this house twice since last August. I’ve edited to reflect who’s physically here day-to-day, not to erase anyone.

Before anyone climbs on their high horse about the word “stepdaughter” or whether I “treat her like my own”... cool. Happy for you. Enjoy the altitude. The reality is complicated, and her relationship with this house - whatever she may or may not have experienced - has never been something she shared with me. But I know something happened. I can feel it in my bones.

Also yes, I say “bob wire.” It’s what we call barbed wire around here in the Southwest. Regional dialect is real, y’all.
