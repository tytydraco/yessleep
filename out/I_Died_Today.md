I died today. It wasn’t a death I had been anticipating. It wasn’t due to old age or frailty. Not even a common ailment.

My heart just stopped. 

There was no warning, nor an explanation once I awoke. They theorised a typical heart attack, blood clots, a genetic defect providing me with a faulty product; but nothing. They don’t understand how my life source could stop pumping without cause, and I doubt they ever will. 

It was ticking, then my clock came to a stop. It was as though some entity somewhere decided it was my time to die, and so they snapped their fingers to bring me closer to their grasp. 

It is hard to describe death. I suppose I am no longer qualified to speak on the topic. I’m sure you have all surmised from how I have been speaking - I am alive. At least, I am in the technical sense. Whatever pulled me to death’s door may not have brought me to the other side, but now I find myself knocking on it. Its dark corridor enticing me to discover what it hides away.

One moment I was sitting with my friends, beer in hand and laughing at Elliot's drunk texts he had sent to his ex. The next moment, everything was gone.

I could’ve sworn I only blinked for a second. I could’ve sworn I was still on Jackson’s couch. I could’ve sworn I was alive. 

Everyone has their beliefs about an after life. I’ve always found comfort in the idea of this supposed good place people go, where they’ll be happy for all eternity. Forever sheltered from the mistakes and regrets mortality brings.

It’s hard to imagine though. Not just eternity, but what ‘good’ is. What would make me happy for so long? Does someone like me even deserve such a thing?

This fragile life I have lived, it brings me many doubts and fears. So, it is hard to say if I have enjoyed it. It just always was. I wanted it to always be. Just different. With no more vices and sorrows, maybe instead some more beer and company. I did not want to be alone, but the cost of those who surround you is judgement. 

Could a place truly exist where I was free?

If my life flashed before my eyes I would’ve suspected I had died. Instead, the crippling sense of loneliness is what alerted me. Everything felt empty, hollow, without purpose. It was just me, myself and I. Perhaps the unbearable silence would be the price I paid for freedom.

I can’t describe visuals, I could not see. For when you don’t have eyes, it’s not possible. There were no smells. No sounds. Nothing to touch. I just was. And I could feel everything, and nothing. 

There were trees surrounding me by a small pond. Well, they weren’t real trees. The physical world no longer existed, so neither did they. Only the vague conception of trees filled my consciousness. I pieced together what a tree could be, what it may have looked like, which made them unconnected and disjointed. 

Though they were still trees. At least to me. Their abstract nature did not deter my mind from agreeing to that.

The water was much the same, its inability to cast a reflection made it transparent. I could see the dirt underneath, along with small undescript creatures moving amongst the dust and rubble. The pond did not move like water. I could not touch it or hear its ripples. But I knew what it was. I understood. 

It captured no light, a solid sheet of blue. In spite of that, the translucent substance captured one image as I ventured closer. Myself. My true self. My soul.

Too much of a coward, I did not want to see. So I stepped back to remain out of its view. 

The scene would’ve been beautiful in our world. The sun was setting in a vibrant pink, I could not feel the grass between my toes but I knew it was soft. I felt a breeze that was neither cold nor warm. It did not catch my clothes as I had none, so I could not tell how strong it was. I could not hear the birds' songs but I could feel myself relax. 

It reminded me of the park near my home. When I'd hear their passionate tunes spill out from the trees the knots in my shoulders would always unravel. I could focus on what mother nature had provided, instead of the cards I had allotted to myself in life. 

The park, am I in the park now?

It was as though everything morphed to fit my memory, yet nothing changed at all. The trees were more familiar somehow, no longer just ‘a tree’ but instead ‘that tree’. I found myself wondering if I’d bump into the old gardener; Mr. Adams.

He’d always give my flowers he accidentally uprooted. He’d tend to them as if the plants were created especially for him, eager to share them with those who’d listen. His wife, Evelyn, would also be often found at his side, attached by the hip. Keen with her hands she often baked with the fruits Mr. Adams would nurture. I wonder if she’s about too.

Wait… I am in the park! I’m not wearing anything, someone will see me!

Not only was I incapable of looking down, but there was nothing to see. There were not only no clothes, but my body was but a memory. A foggy, distant, memory.

Try to reach out in front of you. See how your hand comes into view. Now imagine if you reached forward but there was nothing there. As if you are giving commands to your body, and it obeys, but you never see the outcome. There’s no way to confirm you are doing anything you desire, but you somehow know.

That is how any action I took played out. Not even an illusion of a physical body would form in front of me. It was as if I was moving a marionette, but it consisted of only strings and no wooden character.  

Unsure what else to do, I found myself wandering. I could not move, as there was nowhere to move to. I could understand what it was like to walk and that seemed to be enough. The scenery would vaguely change around me to adapt my memories into new locations. 

Is that all experience will be now? My memories? Will I never have a unique experience again or only an amalgamation of loosely connected ideas? 

The more questions I had, the more comfortable I felt with the lack of answers. I could feel something call to me, telling me to trust this new existence. It will be alright. That’s what it repeated, and I was more than willing to accept its words.

You don't realise how much sound you make until you can hear nothing at all. The beating of your heart. The crunching of autumn leaves underfoot. The crinkling fabric you wear each day to stay warm. 

It seems so silly now. I was just having a dilemma over what to wear for an interview tomorrow. It was just yesterday, but I realise just how trivial it was. The cloth on my back meant nothing in the grand scale of time. 

Time. What is time? Has any time passed?  I have been walking a while. Have I? What was yesterday? Is there a tomorrow? Oh yes, it's not just the clothes. I won't get that job, because there will be no interview tomorrow. Because there is no tomorrow.

The landscape around me seemed to roll out infinitely. By that I mean there was no horizon. No end. It wasn't just that I couldn't see the stretching land before me, but it continued out forever. There was no world, just the all consuming everything.

There was one thing I could see. A golden gate. It was surrounded by bushes, which branches have long since overgrown, engulfing it in a sea of green. A golden glimmer still shone through the cracks. It would be blinding if there was anything to blind.

I could not tell if it was another figment of my imagination. Another strange sight my mind concocted. That did not stop the pull it had on me, its warm light inviting me closer. 

The less distance between us, the more vines untangled themselves from its bars. Some kind of optical illusion also became comprehensible, as the stone pathway before it became stairs ascending to the sky. As they raised up high, so too did the gate.

As more of its metallic details were revealed, I could see something looking back at me. There were eyes. Many eyes. Many, many eyes. Inviting eyes. Excited eyes. Anticipating eyes. But also judgemental eyes. 

I could hear faint, distant screams. Not from the gates, but from my memories. I know those eyes could hear them too, they could see their origins. If they knew the screams they must also know the screeching tires, the sobs of a mother and the heavy breaths of a man on the brink of lucidity. 

Please, oh please do not make me remember. I can not bear to look you in the eyes knowing why you judge my soul. You can not know, why must you know? Do I know? Why can’t I remember? I can not remember the details, the memory escapes me, but I know whatever it knew of me I did not want it to.

I was overcome with shame. Shame I could not understand. I did not know what I was being judged for, but I was too intimidated to face it. 

I knew the eyes wanted me to join them. I could see their promises, the treaties of peace and villas for relaxation. A place awaited that I always desired, I just had to enter. The only caveat is that they knew everything. They knew me. They knew it all. Their judgement may have been righteous, but it felt wrong all the same. 

That is when I heard something for the first time. A crow. 

In the trees surrounding me, a murder of crows had stopped to perch. Their eyes bore no judgement, I felt no guilt. There was something behind those orbs. There was curiosity. There was a scheme. There was an invitation.

One jumped from its branch and flew by me. I could hear its wings flap, see its body, smell its last meal. The familiar pull was much stronger than the gate's light. So I followed. 

The bird flew. It flew and flew and flew. Time was not at a stand still, but it did not march. It simply was. So the crow did not really make progress forward. The horizon did not change. My surroundings remained the same park. 

I felt I'd made a mistake. The gate was the right choice, whatever laid on the over side was worth the judgement. 

But the crow. That beautiful crow. It did not judge. The gate may have wanted me, but I knew the crow needed me. The joy I felt from the infinite journey made up for whatever luxuries were beyond those stairs. 

Something new grew larger in the distance. It stood out compared to my infinite surroundings. 

It was empty. It was dark. It was cold. As though it was a black hole stuck in a failing battle to consume the infinite thread of time. 

Time may have stood strong in the face of it, but I could not. I needed to turn away. I did not know what laid ahead of me but I knew it was wrong. Really wrong. Not shame or guilt. Just something wrong.

But that beautiful bird. It circled me above, waiting for me to continue with it. Perhaps I was a fool to follow, but I was laid naked for the gate before, but this crow made me realise I need cloth. I need to hide. 

With a destination in sight, my steps became more obvious. Each one brought the void closer and closer. The park began to fade around me, instead there was a bright, all consuming, light. 

I could feel death's grip on me, cold and uncaring. It pulled me forward, but with each yank towards my destiny, I could feel a warm hand reach out behind. Begging me to come back. Warning me. 

I knew the eyes with that hand. I could not bare to face them. 

The hands dragging me forward were now visible. A mixture of blackened skin and feathers. Their tight grip choked my soul as if to squeeze it out of me. A little bit of me was lost each time, instead being replaced by voices. A man, a woman, a child. A mother, a father, a son. A preacher, a heretic, a witch. 

I was no longer alone. 

There was a figure in the darkness. Cloaked in feathers and bones. Its face was not visible, a sense of dread told me I did not want to see it. 

It held out its hand. The darkness swallowed the light, winning its battle against infinity. The voices grew in number and volume. My thoughts were messy. Hazy. Shrinking.

I could not laugh. I could not cry. I could not scream. But how I wished I could.

The many hands now wrapped around me, marking where my body would've been. The figure now clearer had a staff and bloodied callouses. Its outreached hand brushed where my cheek would be. Stroking my face. Stroking my ego.

I should've been scared. I should've regretted saying no to the gate. But now I was not alone. Now I could see all I needed to. Now the eyes could not see me. 

I will not be judged. I was with everyone. This infinite hive mind, this infinite darkness, this infinite touch was to be my new living space. 

I was home. 

The figure held me in a warm embrace. It said nothing but I knew I was being welcomed. It wanted me there. I knew it did. 

Because it would not let go. 

Its cloak ripped and tore as its shoulders grew out. The feathers adorning its skin turned to scales, its hand to talons. Its body convulsed and cracked with each new limb clawing out from within it. 

Its beaked face stretched into a jaw. It was like that of a serpent, yet something more. More raw. More powerful. More deadly. 

It towered above me, still holding me in place as the hands wrapping my new body began to clap. Their voices drowned out my own. They were everywhere, yet nowhere. Each scream and laugh became my own, eating away my consciousness, destroying my memories. 

How am I? Where am I? Who are you? Who am I? Who are we? We? We. We. Who are we? 

Questions that we could never answer. The serpent hovered over us, reaching its talons down towards our face. If there were light its shadow would've loomed over us, but shadows were all that was in this place.

With two claws it pried open where our jaw would be, now just a series of melting wax hands and bloody finger nails. The many hands’ feathers now lodged in our throat choking us. 

The figure reached its head inside our peeled open mouth. It turned and adjusted to fit itself inside, crawling down our trachea. It tried to get comfortable, making sure our insides were suitable for its jagged shape. The more it fit inside the more limbs it attempted to enter at once. 

Though one hand always remained outside, stroking our head, wiping our tears. 

We could feel it consuming all we were. Making us better. Making us pure. Stretching us for infinity. 

We could feel it. No interviews again. No nakedness again. No loneliness again. No judgement again. This is our good place. A place with everyone and no judgment. Infinite. We are infinite, we will be infinite. We are infinite. 

Infinite.

WE ARE INFINITE. 

WE ARE INFINITE. WE ARE INFINITE. WE ARE INFINITE. WE ARE INFINITE. WE ARE INFINITE. WE ARE INFINITE. WE ARE INFINITE. WE ARE INFINITE. WE ARE INFINITE. W<A>E INFI%ITE. WE *RE IN&I/I÷E. W# ARE I×FINITE.

Wait, but I wasn't always alone was I? 

I awoke. 

My eyes peeled open, bringing a hospital room into vision. I could hear beeping, some relieved sighs. Nurses chatting to the side of the room. The hums of the air vents. I could feel the firmness of my mattress. The aches in my chest. 

I was alive. 

There was a doctor on top of me, wiping off sweat. Some of the other staff patted his back as he gave tired orders on what to do next. 

I later discovered they'd been trying to keep me alive for 18 hours. Sometimes they'd manage to start my heart, just for it to give up again. 

The weary doctor I saw wiping a waterfall from his brow had been doing CPR on and off from the moment I entered the hospital. While the others scrambled for defibrillators and a reason for my sudden heart attack. 

Most of their methods apparently did very little, the only thing that kept me alive were the hands to my chest. But this time I woke up. Now my body was back to business as usual.

When I described what I had experienced on the other side, I was told it was pretty common to have those kinds of visions. I apparently experienced something called the ‘death wave’, some weird neuron dying crap that makes people feel like they are experiencing infinity before they die. Some see their lives play out before their eyes, others describe cosmic events and so on. 

Their explanations bring me no comfort. The attempt to explain everything away. I do not know how or why my mind would concoct such a specific horror. It could've been my imagination preparing me for death, but it did not feel that way. Not at all. 

More importantly, I had been promised infinity. I felt betrayed. 

They fought for my life for 18 hours. A mere 18 hours. It felt much longer, yet much shorter at the same time. Hours to experience infinity. I can not accept it. I will not.

My parents never visited me in my coffin that the staff called a hospital room. Alcohol has caused me a number of problems over the years, including jail time. The last time I spoke to them I was going 180mph in a school zone. I was so intoxicated I didn't see the kids get off the school bus.

Makes it hard to get a job. Makes it hard to do anything really. That makes my folks unhappy more than anything else. The fact I've done nothing since. 

They likely presumed I did this to myself and didn't ask any further questions. I guess I can't blame them.

It's so much easier when people don't know you. Like that gardener. Mr. Adams was always so kind. It's hard to judge someone you don't know. I always enjoyed seeing him and taking his wife’s sweet treats. I do miss them.

While my parents avoided their failure of a son, my friends were there as soon as visiting hours began. They brought me roses to make me laugh, Jackson even got down on one knee and started a fake proposal. It was good to laugh again, but it feels so different now. I was happy to see them either way.

Before they left they promised to sneak me in some of the good stuff when the nurses weren't looking. It brought me comfort, knowing even though they did know me they did not judge me. 

Now I sit in my room, the beeps and hums still filling my ears. 

The roses are on the bed side table. Some petals are already beginning to wither and fall. The window was left open, the breeze must be killing them. 

It is strange. I never heard that figures’ voice, but I can hear it now. In the dark corners of the room I hear it calling my name. Tempting me. I know infinity awaits. 

I don't know if this will help people understand my state of mind at this moment. I don't know if it explains my actions. But I needed my story out there. So people know the choice that awaits them. So people will understand what I'm about to do next. 

To the guys I am sorry. But there is a crow outside my window, and it wants me to follow.
