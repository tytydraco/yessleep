I awoke to find myself writing - my Body had started to move on its own and my Brain waking up before my Eyes opened - by the Time that I realised that I was awake, I had written four Lines of some sort of Poem - which was strange for many Reasons, the Content of the Poem aside - I don't think I've ever written a Poem before this Moment - yet even as the Realisation of my own Conciousness made me aware of the Light slanting through the trees -

I continued to write - I was not writing on Paper - or on my Hand - or on a Wall even -  
I was writing my Poem in Dirt - earthy Soil dampened by what I assumed at first was Rain - but when I lifted - my Hands from the ground, they were dripping a deep - sickening Crimson -  
and when my Eyes rose - I saw the horrors of what had occurred during my Dawnsleep -

Piles of Birds - deceased - their Legs twisted and stiff - their Feathers soaked to the Bone -  
laying close to the Pond -   
which seemed more dirty with Grime and Pondscum than I remembered -  
and my late Mother's beloved Gnomes -   
turned to Dust and Variations of bluegreenredyellow glass in -the flowerbeds - uprooted -   
mangled and utterly destroyed as if by some Nightcreature -  
a Dog loose from its backyard -

or a Fox stirring up Trouble -  but what sort of Animal has the Ability - the Desire -the Thought to drown another - for sport -

I must make Something clear - so that Others will understand my Plight -  
this first occurred three Days ago - after which I of course hosed down the Garden -   
destroying the odd words in - the Dirt - disposing of what was disposable -

I have woken to the same - three Mornings now - the old words I had written - written once more -and continued with more - then more - waking to Rot - and Decay -  
and the flowing of animalistic Blood -  
the twilight Ritual of Birthdeath -

I did visit the Library to look for a Poem or Song - or Book that contains these Words - but the only Thing I could find - that was even somewhat similar is a Poem by Robert Frost -   
titled 'Mending Wall' - and the first line of the poem -

**SOMETHING THERE IS THAT DOESN'T LOVE A WALL -**

I fear alerting anyone else to this - surely I would be blamed -   
and I lie awake in Wonder and Horror - am I truly to blame -   
because I've been doing this killing - uprooting - drowning - myself -

or because of what I did in the Forest amidst that -  
odd circular Rockmound -   
a Mass of greyblack Mushrooms and little Sprigs of Grass -

I am falling to Sleep as I write this Post - please share your Thoughts -   
Warnings - Guidance - and Below - the Poem -

**Something there is that doesn't love a Garden -**  
**that uproots flowering Tulips, and blows them apart like tiny Heads - bloody -**  
**that tears open Worms as if to gaze upon their writhing Guts -**   
**brutally cracks the Shells of Snails over their Bodies like -**   
**shattered Shards of Earth - Ceramic - tossing Garden Gnomes from their Stoops -**   
**battered and dustmade against Walls - drowning Sparrows - and Crows -**   
**and filling their Beaks with scummy Pond Water - their feathered Forms bloated -**  
**and tossed like Balloondeath upon the Ground -**

**Something stirs in the Dark hours of very early Morning - when the Dew -lays its icechill Fingertips upon the Heads, the Ears - the very Surface of the World -this Something lays claim to my Garden - every Nightmorning - dismantling It as if -to destroy every part of It is to destroy me - the Desire to rip out pulsating Organs and -splinter Bones - wet with Life -**

**To glare with Disdain into Eyes so Dead to the World that -**  
**Something wants to tear brighter - shatter harsher - feast lovlier -**  
**and when my Garden squelches - and Curls its destroyed Corpse in on itself -**  
**Something will return to the Mound - to Rocks - and bulbous Mushrooms -**  
**to a forbidden Home -**   
**where Something there is that doesn't like to be - disturbed -**
