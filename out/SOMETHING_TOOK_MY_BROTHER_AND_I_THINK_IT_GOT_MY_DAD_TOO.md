It’s been 10 years, after a while you start to forget… the things you should remember. 
Laughter, love, joy and even pain. It takes all these emotions and feelings to make us human. Without pain you wouldn’t know true love, and without love you wouldn’t know true pain. Without laughter you wouldn’t know sadness and vise versa. I guess at this time that’s beside the point. 

Words mean nothing now, as almost do all actions that follow.  I don’t even think I want to remember, I think I would rather forget. Am I even human anymore? I don’t know what what to believe, I feel empty, like a shell with nothing in it. Maybe if I remember I would feel better, but I think I’m wrong. 

I remember growing up fast, and by that I mean exactly what I’m saying. I never had much of a childhood when I was younger. Don’t get me wrong I have certain memories of playing and doing certain things, but that’s about it. My mom left me and my father alone when I was around 8. She couldn’t handle being around what reminded her of what happened. 

We don’t blame her for leaving. She never said anything, not a goodbye, not even a “I love you son”. One day she was just gone. My dad had a hard time being a single parent. He was always working and I was usually with my grand parents. 

Now that I’m a week away from being able to drive, Dad trust that I can handle being on my own when he is working. He said I could use his old truck grandpa gave him, but the catch is I have to fix the truck up myself. I think he said something about the clutch and starter being messed up, but what do I know. I’ll probably have to watch like 30 videos just to even get close to figuring it out. It’s almost that time again though, the time where dad takes a few days off of work so I’m not alone. 

The day my brother died. The day I dread the most, the one day I’ve chosen to forget. The one I don’t want to remember. I say died but we don’t actually know what happened. I know it’s been 8 years since I’ve seen him, my dad keeps hope that he may be out there somewhere. 

Laughing and smiling, maybe even with a new family that took him under their wing. I like to keep my hopes high when dad talks about it, but I saw what happened that day. I don’t know what took him, but I saw it and still can’t get the image out of my head. I keep the act for dad up I just don’t know how to tell him. Would he even believe me? Or would he think I’m going crazy?

(A few days pass)
I had the same nightmare… again, of the same thing that took my brother but this time it try’s to get me. I wake up at the same time every night when I have this dream. In the dream I’m in the pitch black woods where my brother was taken. No stars, no moon, no lights. You can barely even see a tree in front of you until you run into it. 

I hear my brother crying and screaming in pain echoing through out the surrounding branches. Asking me to help him.. asking me to save him. Every time I get to where he sounds close where I can see him. I see that thing, I don’t even know what to call it. Or if there even is a word to describe it. 

I remember a very specific conversation i had with my dad after the incident. “Dad” I said. “Yeah buddy” he said. “Do you believe in monsters?”. “Of course not son, closest thing you get to a monster is a really bad person”. “What do you mean by that?”. “Well son, some people are bad and some people are good”. 
I think back to that conversation quite often. As it shows to reason why I never told my dad what really happened. 
(A few more days pass)

I heard it again… the sound of my brother outside my window. Asking me to come out and play with him, it’s been 8 years since he was gone. For some reason he still sounds the same age. I know it’s not him out there, I know it’s that thing. It scratches at the window for hours in the night almost like it’s trying to figure out how to open it. 

(2 years pass by) 
It’s been 2 years since I’ve thought about or heard the creature that was mimicking my brother. I noticed dad was acting kind of strange lately, like not following his normal routines. I was suspecting that all of the stress and trauma was finally getting to him. Was this even my dad anymore? Or did that thing get him as well. I never looked out my window to see it so I don’t even know if that’s possible. 

I’m sure I’m probably just scaring myself or trying to grasp onto anything that could make sense of to why my dad has been the way he has been. He barely comes out of his room when he gets home from work. He barely talks to me anymore, I feel like it’s my fault but I know there’s nothing I can do. 
 
The next night I had the usual nightmare, cut and dry the same thing down to each detail of the woods and darkness. Except this time I didn’t hear the voice of my deceased brother from my window. Nor did I hear anything. It was dead silent, like almost too quiet. I brushed it off and went to the bathroom then to grab a bottle of water. 

As I was walking to get the water I heard a weird noise come from my brother’s room. I brushed it off as being tired and having a scary dream. “Maybe my mind is just trying to scare me” I said to myself as I kept walking down the stairs. My dad’s a heavy sleeper so I never have to worry about waking him up if I get hungry or thirsty in the middle of the night. 

I’ve never told him about the nightmares or anything of that matter. I always check on him to make sure he’s still there and sleeping good though. I opened his door and heard him snoring. In his usual deep sleep with his snore that sounds like a grizzly bear, I shut the door and started making my way back to my room. As I made my way up the first few steps I noticed something weird. 

There was an outline of what looked like to be a person standing at the top of the stairs. My heart started pounding and sweat was starting to profusely drip down my nose. My stomach turned as it felt like I had the flu or something. “WHO ARE YOU” I said in a whisper yell. Maybe it was dad sleep walking again and he somehow got past me after I checked on him.

 “No that’s not possible” I said out loud, then the figure above me spoke. “It’s me sweety, i-it-it’s your mom”. I wanted to throw up, scream cry and run, but I just stood there. “Mom? You’ve been gone since bub died how did you even get in?”. She didn’t respond and I started to feel like this wasn’t my mom. “Don’t worry about that” she said as she or it started making its way towards me. 

“Just come give your mother a kiss”
 I never ran so fast in my entire life. I bolted out the front door into the woods, the same woods my brother disappeared in. I could hear that thing humming my favorite nursery rhyme my mom would sing when I was kid. I kept running until it stopped and eventually it did. 
(Switching to dad’s perspective) 

He wakes up and notices a cold draft coming in. He gets up and notices the front door wide open. He runs up stairs as fast as possible, “SON!” “WHERE ARE YOU !”
He reaches his son’s room but no one is there. 
He grabs a flashlight and coat and follows the footprints out the door.
“JASON!” He repeats as he walks through out the dark woods. He reaches a point where the trail ends but his son is nowhere to be found. Then he hears it, the same the same thing Jason had been hearing. 

He hears the sound of his dead son’s voice screaming and crying but this time it’s different. There’s more than one voice this time. As he has no where else to go he runs back home and calls the police to report what happened. 

Operator: “911 what’s your emergency” 
Dad: “My son, my son’s gone” 
Operator: “Sir what do you mean I need more information” 
Dad: “he’s gone, he just vanished into the woods” 
Operator: “Okay sir I need an address or location I can send units to so we can further help you out” 
Dad: “First my son, then my wife, then my last son… I CANT FUCKING DO THIS ANYMORE!” 
Operator: “sir please calm down I have a unit en route to further assist you” 
There was silence on the phone, then one loud bang rang out. 
Operator: “sir, are you there. Sir can you hear me?” 
*The unit arrives about 10 minutes after the noise*
Cop: “Dispatch we have one deceased male, seems to be self inflicted. It looks like we’re dealing with a suicide” 
Operator: “did you clear the house? There should be at least two people there” 
Cop: “yeah I cleared the premises, not a sign of life here besides this guy”
