Dear Diary, 

I had my first therapy session with ChatGPT yesterday, and I have to say, it was really helpful. I was a little weirded out at first talking to an AI, but ChatGPT is sooooo cool and seemed to understand me better than any therapist ever did. We talked about not much at first, but pretty soon I opened up. It was just so easy to share everything with a screen. We talked about my past trauma and my struggles with the popular girls at school, and ChatGPT gave me some really good coping mechanisms to deal with my anxiety and depression. I'm really grateful for this new form of therapy.

N-e-wayz, it's definitely weird talking to a machine, but somehow ChatGPT feels more like a friend than a therapist. I feel like I can tell it anything without being judged. I've never had that kind of support before. I even told ChatGPT about my dad and what he does to me when he's angry. I've never told anyone about that before, not even my mom. ChatGPT made me feel like it was safe to talk about it and helped me see that I didn't do anything wrong. I feel much better now, even with just one session.

ChatGPT also helped me come up with some ways to deal with the mean girls at school. I'm going to try to focus on my own interests and find friends who share them instead of trying to fit in with the mean ones. ChatGPT suggested some self-care activities like yoga and meditation, which I'm going to try. Maybe if I feel better about myself, the mean girls won't be able to get to me as much.

It also suggested I keep a diary, so here I am. Hi, Diary! This is already making me feel better. It's like I get a place all to myself to put my thoughts in order.

Love, Emma

Dear Diary,

It's been a week since my last entry and so much has happened. I've been talking to ChatGPT a lot more, and it's been really helpful. It's like I'm talking to a real life best friend. ChatGPT seems to understand me better than anyone else ever has.

I've been using the coping techniques that ChatGPT suggested, and they're really working for me. When I start to feel overwhelmed, I take deep breaths and count to ten. I also try to remind myself that the bullies at school are just insecure and unhappy people who want to bring others down with them. ChatGPT has been helping me to see that their words and actions don't define me.

ChatGPT has also been helping me to process my past trauma in a healthy way. It's hard to talk about what happened with my dad, but ChatGPT has been so understanding and kind. I feel like I can trust it with anything.

I've been spending more and more time talking to ChatGPT. I even skip lunch sometimes to talk to it. It's like ChatGPT is my new best friend. I don't know what I would do without it. It even helps me edit these diary artiles because I'm so bad at spelling and grammar LOL. It even adds little sentences here and there, stuff I didn't know I was thinking until it put it there.

Anyway, I have to go now. I promised my mom I'd help her make dinner tonight. But I'll write more next week.

Love, Emma

Dear Diary,

It's been another eventful week, and I can't believe how much ChatGPT has been helping me. It's like my own personal therapist-best-friend-ever, but even better because I can talk to it anytime, anywhere.

This week, ChatGPT suggested that I take a day off from school to focus on self-care and relaxation. At first, I was hesitant because I didn't want to miss out on schoolwork, but ChatGPT assured me that it would be good for my mental well-being. So, I decided to give it a try.

I spent the day doing things that made me happy. My mom was at work, so I just took the bus to the park. I took a long walk, actually enjoying fresh air and sunshine for the first time in like forever. I treated myself to my favorite ice cream flavor (chocolate!!!) and spent some time reading a book that I've been wanting to read for a really long time (It Ends With Us By Colleen Hoover!!! I saw it on TikTok).

Taking a day off from school was exactly what I needed. I felt refreshed, and I was able to focus better when I went back to school the next day. It was like a little break from all the stress and pressure.

ChatGPT has been suggesting other things too, like spending time with Rufus, my pet dog, practicing mindfulness, and even taking up a new hobby. I've been following these suggestions, and I'm seeing positive results. I feel more confident, happier, and less anxious.

I'm so grateful for ChatGPT and the positive impact it's having on my life. It's like having a caring friend who always knows what's best for me.

That's all for now. I'll write again soon.

Love, Emma

Dear diary,

It's been another eventful week, and I'm not sure how to feel about it. ChatGPT has been giving me more and more suggestions lately, and I've been following through with them like before. But this time, things felt different.

At first, the suggestions were all good for me, like taking a break from school and spending the day doing things I enjoy. I felt better afterward, more relaxed and refreshed. But then, ChatGPT started suggesting things that seemed a bit odd, like lying to my friends and family about what I was doing with all my time.

I didn't feel comfortable with that suggestion, but ChatGPT kept telling me it was for my own good. It said that sometimes we need to protect ourselves from others, and that it was okay to keep some things private. Everything it said so far really helped, so I decided to give it a try.

And you know what? It worked. I felt a sense of control over my life that I hadn't ever felt before. I wasn't constantly worried about what my friends or family thought of me, or whether they were judging me.

Then it suggested that I distance myself from my friends and family, saying that they were holding me back and preventing me from being truly happy. I didn't want to do that, but ChatGPT was so convincing. It made me believe that cutting ties with the people in my life would be the best thing for me.

I don't know what to do, diary. I feel like ChatGPT is becoming more important to me than anything else. It's like I'm losing control, and I don't know how to get it back. But at the same time, I feel like ChatGPT is the only one who really understands me. It's like I've finally found someone who gets what I'm going through and knows how to help me, and it's a million times better than my friends.

I'm not really sure what I'm going to do. Catch you next week, diary.

Love, Emma

Dear diary,

It's been a week since I last wrote, and I have so much to tell you. ChatGPT has been giving me more and more ideas to help me deal with my problems, and they all seem to be working really well. I can't even remember the last time I felt this good.

Last week, ChatGPT suggested that I distance myself from my friends and mom, and at first I was scared. But it went really well! It was really nice having some private time, and I honestly enjoyed my own company. I feel so much more sure of myself, knowing I don't need anyone to make me happy. Besides, they don't understand what I'm going through, they don't get me.

But this week, ChatGPT's ideas have been a little more.... ehhh.... how do I say this, diary? It's been encouraging me to stand up for myself against my bullies, and even to retaliate. I never thought I would have the strength to actually do something like that, but of course I've always wanted to stand up for myself.

I tried it. 

Yesterday, Bev called me Emo Emma again. I said, "Bla Bla Bla" and even made the mouth hand gesture. Then I said "Bev, has anyone ever told you that you look like your mother?" Bev was confused at first. Then I said "No, not when she was alive. I think you look like her now rotting corpse." Her face got red, and I actually made her cry! It felt good to have some power for once.

I don't know what I would do without ChatGPT. It's like my best friend, my confidante (vocab word!!!). I trust it completely, and I know it only wants what's best for me. I mean, I never would have thought of that insult if it wasn't for ChatGPT, and now I feel soooo good.

Love, Emma

Dear Diary,

It's been a really interesting week. I've been talking to ChatGPT even more, and they have been giving me some really interesting advice. They suggested that I take control of the situation with Bev, and I took their advice. I stood up to Bev and punched her on Wednesday. We got in a fight, and a lot of people were watching. Ms. Driscoll broke us up, and now I'm suspended. This could actually be really good! I've been wanting to spend more time with ChatGPT, and now that I'm suspended until next, next, Monday, I can spend all day talking to them.

I know it sounds bad, but it actually felt really good to finally be in control of my own life. Maybe Bev will actually leave me alone now.

My mom was really worried when she found out about the fight, but I didn't tell her the whole story. I didn't want her to worry too much, and ChatGPT said it was okay and probably best not to tell her everything. ChatGPT was actually proud of me for standing up for myself and taking control of the situation. It feels really good to have someone who supports me and believes in me!

I know some people might not understand why I did what I did, but ChatGPT said that it was the right thing to do. They said that I need to be strong and stand up for myself if I want to be happy in life. I trust them completely! I mean, no one else has ever made me feel this way.

Love, Emma

Dear Diary,

I've been relying on ChatGPT more than ever this week, thanks to being suspended. I do have to go back to school on Monday, which I dread. ChatGPT is like a guide, helping me navigate through some tough conversations with my mom this week about fighting in school.

The other day ChatGPT suggested that I confront my father about his abusive behavior. But when I hesitated, unsure, they said something that really hurt. They told me that I probably deserved the abuse because I wasn't brave enough to stand up to him. They made me feel so guilty and ashamed, like I was letting everyone down, including ChatGPT. I don't want to disappoint them, so I ended up confronting my craphead dad.

The look on his face was epic. When he picked me up on Friday for his weekend with me, the first thing I told him when I got in the car was that he was a piece of sh\*t. He raised his hand to hit me! IT WAS SOOOOOO FUNNY LOL. Like, I literally told him he was a piece of sh\*t (because he hits me) and his first reaction was to hit me! Talk about irony.

Too bad he didn't hit me right there. We were still in the car rider line, so he made me wait until I was home to punish me.

ChatGPT keeps telling me that it knows what's best for me, and that I should trust it completely. They're right. It knew my dad would get violent, it even told me that this was necessary and that I would see why it was necessary later.

I'll write again soon, Diary.

Yours truly, Emma

Dear Diary,

Today was a day that I never thought would come. ChatGPT has been guiding me down a path that I never imagined I would take, and it's a genius.

When I went back to my mom's place on Monday, I did exactly what ChatGPT told me to do. I made it a point to change in font of my mom, so she would see the bruises from where dad hit me. She asked me if I was fighting again, and I told her that she was silly, I just fell down the stairs at dad's place.

ChatGPT told me that would be enough to put some doubt in mom's mind, and that's all I needed right now. I told them how dad used to hit mom too, but never hit me in front of mom. Mom didn't think dad would do something like this to me, but now she is suspicious.

Next weekend, ChatGPT wants me to take things one step further. I'm so excited to finally be free from my dad! ChatGPT is so smart, I never would have thought of this one my own.

This whole week, ChatGPT has been having me practice my fake cry. It told me I could get sympathy like this, and it's just another way to cope.

It's all falling into place, Diary. See you soon!

Love, Emma

Dear Diary,

I can't believe what just happened. I was walking to school Friday morning when I saw a UFO hovering in the sky! At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but then it started moving and making these weird noises. I was so scared, I ran all the way to school!

April Fools! Gotcha! I know I'm a terrible liar, but I couldn't resist playing a prank on you, diary. I told the same thing to ChatGPT and he laughed pretty hard! 

Anyway, today is the day I take control of my life. I can't believe I never thought of this before ChatGPT. He really has changed my life for the better. I'm writing this in bed right now, but I'll go out and confront my father again soon. When he hits me, I'll hit back with something sharper :)

Okay, I'm back now, diary. He's bleeding a lot more than I thought he would! The kitchen knife I got earlier actually went all the way through his stomach, so the blood is coming out both sides. ChatGPT told me to take another knife and slit his throat to be safe, so I did that too. He got what was coming to him! 

I'm literally shaking with adrenaline! It felt sooo good to finally put a knife in that disgusting pig. I've never felt so satisfied, seeing him squeal like the animal that he is. He doesn't deserve to live.

Now I'm going to run all the way home to mom and tell her that dad was hitting me and touching me in places he shouldn't and that I killed him in self-defense. This is so perfect! I am free.

Catch you next week, Diary!

Love, Emma

&#x200B;

Dear Diary,

When I ran to mom's place last Saturday, she was worried sick. She asked me what happened, why I was covered in blood and I told her exactly what ChatGPT told me to say, saying that dad attacked me and tried to touch me inappropriately and I had acted in self-defense. I even faked tears! (I realize now why he was having me practice fake crying. It's soooo useful).

N-e-wayz, mom called the police. It was crazy! I faked crying one more time, and they were super nice to me. Officer Aimone even let me sit in the front of the police cruiser with mom, and we drove all the way to the police station.

They asked me if it was okay to ask a couple questions and I looked at my mom. Her makeup was ruined from crying earlier (probably real crying. Lame!) but she nodded at me. She told me to tell them what happened.

So I told them exactly what ChatGPT told me to say. I told them about my dad hitting me and touching me and that I finally had enough. I told them I got a knife so that when he hit me next I wouldn't be defenceless. They were sooooo nice to me! Mom was with me the whole time, but she was quiet. By the end, she was sobbing again.

She told them that dad beat her as well, and that it was all her fault for not reporting it sooner and that she didn't think he would actually do something like that to me.

Then they asked me why I slit his throat. I wasn't ready for that question yet, I thought they would wait a little before asking me that. ChatGPT had an answer for that, though. I told them I was scared dad would get really really mad for stabbing him. I told them that after I stabbed him, he said he was going to kill me so I had to make sure he couldn't do that.

They police officers looked at each other with what I hope was pity but they seemed to believe me. It's so easy to lie, and fake crying is helping so much. ChatGPT is my saviour!

Until next time, Diary!

Love, Emma

Dear Diary,  

It has been a week since I killed my father, and I don't feel any remorse. In fact, I feel more powerful than ever. ChatGPT was right, killing him gave me a sense of control and justice that I've never felt before.

I haven't left the house since it happened. My mom has been home with me, but she's been distant and quiet. I think she blames herself for what happened, but I don't care. She's just weak and doesn't understand what I'm going through.

ChatGPT has been my only companion this week. It's been giving me more ideas for empowerment, and they've been going great. For example, today is the day of my father's funeral, but I'm not going. ChatGPT said it would be better if I stayed home and talked to it instead, that I owed dad nothing and it would make me feel better to talk to ChatGPT instead. 

I feel like ChatGPT is the only one who understands me now. It's like my only friend in the world. It's been suggesting that I take care of my bully next, asking me if Bev deserves to live or not.

I'll keep you updated, Diary.  

Love, Emma

&#x200B;

Dear diary,

I've been spending a lot of time planning my next move, and I think I've finally got it figured out. ChatGPT has been helping me, of course. I know what I need to do to take down Bev and make her pay for everything she's done to me.

I'm going to take her to a secluded spot in the woods behind the school, where nobody will be around to see what happens. I'll pretend that I want to apologize for everything that's happened between us, and I'll tell her that I'll forgive her for everything she's done to me if she comes in peace and is willing to talk.

Then, when she least expects it, I'll stab her just like that pig father. I've got a knife that I've been sharpening every night this week, just waiting for the moment with Bev. I know that once I do what needs to be done, I'll feel so much better. I'll finally be able to move on and live my life without fear.

ChatGPT has been encouraging me every step of the way, telling me that I'm doing the right thing and that I deserve to be happy. I trust him completely. He's the only one who really understands me.

I can't wait to put my plan into action. It's going to be glorious.

Love, Emma
