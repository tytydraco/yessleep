I need help, but honestly, I don’t even know if that’s possible. Right now, it feels like there’s no hope for me, and I’m struggling to share this without sounding like a rambling old man.

This problem has haunted me for as long as I can remember. The first time it struck, was when I was just seven years old. It was a hot summer day, and my older brother, my twin sister, and I were playing hide-and-seek with a couple of our friends. I snuck into my mom's room, careful not to make a sound, and opened the bottom drawer of her massive dresser. Being a scrawny little kid—just a tiny pipsqueak—I knew I would fit snugly into that small space.

Once I crawled in, I found a wooden support beam for the drawer above and pulled it shut, stifling a giggle as I heard my brother yell, “Here I come!” He started his search under the bed, rifling through the closet, and peeking behind the door, blissfully unaware that I was hiding right there. I could hear him finding our friends one by one, their laughter echoing through the house.

But as the seconds turned into minutes, that cozy hideout began to feel like a coffin. The clothes around me felt suffocating, each breath drawing in the stale air and amplifying my growing panic. I pushed against the sides of the drawer, trying to pull on the beam above me, but it wouldn’t budge. I could hear my brother’s voice getting more frustrated as he called out, “Where is he?” Then one of the kids piped up, “He probably broke the rules… he’s outside, I just know it.”

That’s when dread crept in. “Please! Somebody help! I’m in Mom's room! I’m in the dresser!” I shouted, but the sound only felt muffled and distant. I could hear the kids racing out the back door, and for the first time, a chilling thought crossed my mind: “I’m going to die here.”

My breathing turned frantic, each inhale feeling tighter than the last. The more I panicked, the harder it became to breathe. I was just a scared little kid, trapped in the most humiliating way. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I cried out, “Please… Please… Help me. Mommy, I don’t want to die. I didn’t mean to…” My voice broke as I sobbed, and it felt like the air was being sucked out of me.

I sat there, helpless, for what felt like hours, the frantic search outside growing increasingly desperate. I could hear my family calling, “It’s not funny anymore! Seriously, where are you?” 

Time dragged on, and my panicked cries turned into soft whimpers, each plea growing weaker. Exhaustion washed over me, and as the minutes slipped by, I felt myself drifting into a numbness, like a slow, painful fade into nothingness. Alone at seven, I let go of everything.

Then suddenly, I jolted awake, gasping and choking, the reality of panic flooding back in. My lungs felt like they were on fire, and it seemed impossible to catch my breath. My mother rushed into my bedroom, her eyes wide with concern as I incoherently screamed about suffocating to death. I cried harder than ever as she wrapped her arms around me, murmuring, “Shhh… Shhh... I know, baby. You’re okay, it was all a bad dream.” She stroked my hair gently, rocking me back and forth, and sent my twin sister to fetch a glass of ice water to help me breathe again.

Eventually, I started to calm down, though the remnants of terror clung to me. I tried to explain, my voice shaky. “Mom, I died. I was stuck in your dresser, and Jesse couldn’t find me.” Before I could say more, I noticed the look of confusion on her face. “Jesse?” she asked, concern etched in her brow.

Frustration bubbled up inside me. “Mom, that’s not funny! Why are you saying that?” I shot her a look, bewildered. This wasn’t the time for jokes; as far as I was concerned, I had just died. I glanced at my sister, hoping for solidarity, but she looked just as perplexed as our mother. My anger shifted to fear.

“Mom… Maddie…” I looked between them, feeling trapped in a nightmare of confusion. Instead of trying to explain something that seemed pointless to two people who had known Jesse their entire lives, I slipped out of bed and headed down the hall to my brother's room.

As I turned the corner, ready to knock on his door, I nearly crashed into the wall.

“W-what?” I stammered, barely above a whisper. My mother and sister were right behind me, and as I stared at the empty wall, a wave of anguish crashed over me. I couldn’t even process their worried voices as they called my name, my mind consumed by shock and confusion. My mother scooped me up and placed me in the back seat of the car.

They say I was nearly catatonic, staring straight ahead the whole ride to the ER. Everything felt like a blur, memories flickering in and out like snapshots from a movie. The doctors ran tests, and the on-call therapist fired questions at me that I struggled to answer.

“Who is Jesse?” 

“My brother.” 

“How old is he?” 

“Thirteen.” 

“What happened before you woke up?” 

“I died.” 

“How did you die?” 

“I-I…”

And then I froze again. They kept me under observation for a few days, insisting that Jesse wasn’t real, that everything I had known before waking up was just a dream. Once I finally agreed to their explanation, they sent me home. I quickly learned to grieve in silence; the thought of returning to the hospital terrified me.

But I knew Jesse was real. At least, he had been real to me. Memories flooded my mind: him teaching me how to ride a bike, tying my shoes, standing up to the bigger kids. All of it felt like it had been ripped away in an instant.

I didn’t have a father—not really. Everyone has a father, but mine was a ghost. I knew nothing about him; I didn’t know if he was dead or just absent. My mother never spoke of him, and when I once dared to ask, her expression shifted into something I couldn’t quite place—neither sadness nor anger, but a look that seemed to echo dissociation. I dropped the subject then and there… forever.

Jesse had gladly taken on the role of my protective figure. He wasn’t an adult, but he had always seemed wise beyond his years. An old soul, my mother would say. Now, in his absence, I felt lost, a void where his presence had once been.

Over time, I began to believe that it had all been a vivid night terror. I mean, how could someone just blip out of existence? They say that time heals all wounds, and as I began to grow older, I slowly forgot about Jesse. 

It was still a sensitive topic. My sister tried to joke about it a couple of years down the road, but it caused a huge argument. I felt like I still had to defend the existence of someone I once loved. Regardless of his existence, I had loved him deeply. Just as deeply as my sister and mother. It became a secret fear of mine to lose someone close to me again. It was hard to sleep most nights because I feared I would dream up another life.

When I was fourteen years old, I asked my mom if I could go swimming with a few friends at a local lake. She told me no, and I was pissed. All the other kids were going, and I was the only one that had a loser mom. So I thought… 

That night, I snuck out my bedroom window after stuffing my bed with pillows to make it look like I was sleeping. I walked a few blocks away to one of the kid's houses and they gave me a ride after deciding to join. 

It was a fun night. We had some stolen beers that some kids brought from their parents or asked their older friends and siblings to buy. This was only the second time I had ever had alcohol. We were all swimming and throwing mud at each other when one of the girls shouted over everyone. “We should jump off that cliff!” as she pointed over everyone's heads to the cliff that stood about fifteen feet above the water. “I ain’t doing it,” one guy said with a scoff. 

I had had a few drinks at this point, and I probably would have gone skydiving if someone asked me to. “I’ll do it,” I said loudly as I slurred my words. A few of the kids cheered as I climbed out of the muddy lake water and began trudging up the hillside. I stumbled and tripped a few times before reaching the top of the cliff. 

I looked down at everyone and threw my fists up in the air like a champion. I screamed, “Wooooo!” before looking down at the water. It looked like it was miles away from where I stood. I took a deep breath and mumbled “Fuck it…” Before jumping off into the dark water. 

The fall felt so long, and somehow, I ended up flipping and I landed head-first into… something. I only remember the sound of my skull shattering before I felt every vertebra in my neck crunch before the lights went out. 

I don’t know how long it was black, but it felt like a deep, sharp sleep—an experience that’s hard to put into words for anyone who hasn’t been through it. It was as if time had folded in on itself, and I was lost in a void, weightless and serene.

When I finally woke up, I found myself lying on cold, dewy grass, the chill biting through my wet trunks. The world around me was quiet, almost eerily still. I sat up abruptly, gasping for air, my fingers instinctively reaching for the back of my neck. I frantically felt for any wounds, heart racing in panic, expecting to find something—anything—that signaled I was injured. But I was fine. Just freezing and disoriented, but alive.

As I looked around the empty field, my gaze settled on the remnants of a wild night—beer cans crumpled and empty bottles scattered like forgotten memories. I stood up slowly, my legs trembling from the cold and the shock of what had just happened. When I turned to face the lake, my stomach churned. The cliff loomed in the distance, stark and imposing, a dark silhouette against the fading light. I felt a wave of nausea crash over me; I knew I had died up there. It was a truth more real than anything else in that moment—how could this happen?

In that moment of disbelief, I didn’t even consider the incident from when I was seven; that thought didn’t even cross my mind. I just stared at the cliff until the overwhelming feeling of dread took over, and I threw up. The retching came hard and fast, my body heaving as I fell to my hands and knees on the damp grass. Each wave of nausea sent jolts of pain through my ribs, and I felt utterly helpless. When it was over, I spat out the bitter taste, the sour remnants clinging to my throat, and splashed some lake water on my face, trying to wash away the lingering horror.

Somehow, I managed to stumble about three miles down the road, the cool breeze stinging my skin, when one of my friends spotted me. He pulled over, concern etched on his face, and offered me a ride home. I jumped at the chance, relief flooding through me. When we arrived, the house was quiet; my mom was already at work.

I stepped inside, the familiar scent of home wrapping around me like a comforting blanket. I headed toward my room, feeling the weight of exhaustion settle in my bones. But just a few feet into the house, I heard a jingling sound and the unmistakable tap-tap of nails on the kitchen floor.

I paused, furrowing my brow in confusion, the peaceful atmosphere suddenly feeling off. Moments later, an old golden retriever came barreling around the corner, his tail wagging furiously as if he had been waiting for me all along. I felt a rush of emotions—confusion and a strange sense of recognition. “Mom? Maddie?” I called out nervously, my voice tinged with uncertainty.

The dog jumped up on me, showering my face with sloppy kisses as if we were long-lost friends. He was a sweet old guy, with graying fur and kind, expressive eyes, but I couldn’t shake the question swirling in my mind—what was he doing in my house? I was bewildered, trying to piece together the events of the day, my heart still racing from the cliff and the darkness that followed. So I just patted the old guy on the head and looked at his collar for a name. “Beans,” read his shiny little name tag. 

“‘Scuse me, Beans,” I said out loud, giving the golden retriever a gentle pat as I made my way to my room. I closed the door behind me, the familiar creak echoing in the quiet. Once inside, I changed into something warm and dry, the soft fabric wrapping around me like a comforting hug.

As I looked around, I noticed my covers had been pulled off my bed, revealing the pillows I had stuffed underneath. My heart sank as I realized Mom would be furious when she got home. I hoped she’d have time to cool down at work before confronting me.

I had no idea where my sister was, but honestly, I wasn’t in the mood for any conversation. My mind was a jumble of confusion and discomfort, swirling with questions I couldn’t quite grasp. I sat alone with my thoughts for a while, the silence heavy around me, until an idea struck me. I needed to write everything down—the events of the day, the surrealness of it all.

After grabbing a notebook, I scribbled furiously, my pen flying across the page as I tried to capture every detail. It was as if I was trying to make sense of the chaos in my mind. And then, in a moment of clarity, the connection hit me: “I died then too…” I whispered, the words heavy in the air. The thought consumed me, wrapping around my mind like a thick fog. Was I going crazy? Had I always been crazy? What if I was just schizophrenic? It seemed plausible, especially since I remembered seeing something like that in a scary movie once.

With trembling hands, I decided to write down everything I could remember about that other death. I needed to document this, to have something tangible in case it was all just a figment of my imagination. I even drew a small picture of Jesse, a fleeting figure from my childhood, wanting to preserve his face in my memory. Was he a product of childhood psychosis? Perhaps. But regardless, I loved him, and I felt a strange connection that I couldn’t shake. I was determined to track these odd happenings, to gather evidence for whatever this was. At fourteen, it all made a twisted sort of sense.

When my mom finally came home, she set her bags down with a heavy thud and turned to glare at me. It was a look I knew all too well—the classic pissed-off mom stare. She didn’t say a word, but her silence spoke volumes.

“I’m sorry, Mom,” I pleaded, suddenly feeling the weight of my actions crash over me. I rushed up to her, arms open wide. She looked taken aback, her surprise palpable. I realized, at that moment, that I hadn’t willingly hugged her since I was probably ten or eleven.

To my relief, she hesitated for a second, then wrapped her arms around me, her warmth grounding me. “Are you okay?” she asked, concern etching her features. But I didn’t want to bring up what had happened. There was no way she would believe me, and I wasn’t ready to admit what I felt was the truth.

“Yeah, Mom, I just feel bad,” I said, pouting as I squeezed her tighter. I could feel the steady rhythm of her heartbeat against me, a reminder that she had always been there for me, unwavering and supportive. A pang of guilt washed over me—if I really had died, what would my last words have been to her?

It was a morbid thought for a kid my age, I knew, but given the circumstances, it felt almost inevitable. As I held her close, I couldn't help but wonder about the fragility of life and how easily it could slip away.

I felt tears welling up, but before I could allow myself to cry, I heard Beans trotting back into the living room. I released myself from my mom's embrace and turned to acknowledge the dog standing before us, his fur catching the light as he bounced around, tail wagging like crazy. I sniffled, trying to clear the lump in my throat, and looked back at my mom. “When did you get this guy?” I asked, half-expecting her to reveal that Maddie had snuck him in as a surprise.

My mom stared at me for a moment, her expression a mix of confusion and concern, as if I had two heads. “I don’t get it,” she replied, a hint of exasperation creeping into her voice.

I wasn’t surprised by her reaction. After two near-death—well, death—experiences, and the strange changes that had unfolded afterward, it felt like Beans was the only new variable in my life. Everything else was a blur, and he seemed to have materialized out of thin air.

From that day forward, I decided to act like Beans had always been there. It wasn’t hard, really; he was just a dog. I didn’t need to delve deep into his personality or habits; I could simply pet him and treat him as if he’d been my furry companion all along. A quick look through some photo albums would give me the context I needed to stitch him into my memories.

I discovered that Beans had been my mom’s dog, one she got just a few weeks after Maddie and I were born. There was a charming photo of the three of us babies lined up in a row, a snapshot of innocence and joy. He had always been adorable, with floppy ears and a goofy grin.

For a moment, warmth spread through me as I reminisced. I wished I could genuinely recall those memories. One photo captured the two of us lying on the couch, engrossed in a cartoon when I was about five. I could almost feel the comfort of that moment, the soft fabric of the couch, the glow of the TV casting a warm light around us. 

Another page was filled with family pictures that included Beans when Maddie and I were about seven, our smiles wide and carefree, full of childhood innocence.

But then the dark thoughts crept in. Jesse had evaporated when I was seven. What about those memories? My heart ached at the thought, a heavy weight pressing down on my chest. This wasn’t my childhood; these felt like fake memories, cruelly planted as part of some sick joke by a god who reveled in suffering. 

If a god were real, he wouldn’t do this to someone. He wouldn’t orchestrate such torment. It didn’t matter if this was a mental illness or some kind of alternate reality; my life shouldn’t have turned out this way.

After the incident at the cliff, everything shifted. I fell into a deep depression, each day blurring into the next, a constant battle against an unseen enemy. The weight of my experiences was crushing, and I felt utterly isolated, lost in a fog that wouldn’t lift.

 I was suicidal. I probably would have killed myself if I wasn’t afraid of coming back to life with something lost. That thought was worse than just dying. I yearned for the ability to just let go. It was one of the worst times in my life. One of them. 

Somehow, I managed to make it through the days, though they felt like an endless slog through mud. I skipped all the typical milestones that a teen is supposed to experience—prom, homecoming, any extracurricular activities. Instead, I isolated myself, retreating into the confines of my room where the weight of my thoughts pressed down on me like a heavy blanket.

The only thing that provided any relief from the anguish was my art. I would sketch with my blue and black pens for hours, losing myself in the intricate lines and shapes that danced across the page. It became my refuge, a space where I could express emotions that felt too big to voice. 

At school, I could channel my pain into drawings that spoke louder than my words ever could, creating vivid images that reflected the chaos swirling in my mind. Each stroke of the pen helped me forget—if only temporarily—all that I had lost and the relentless fear that my life could change in an instant.

I became hyper-aware of every risk, every moment that could lead to danger. I stopped taking chances entirely; no more jumping off of things, no more driving anywhere I didn’t absolutely need to go. I found myself meticulously planning every outing, and every interaction, all in an effort to keep myself safe from another brush with death. 

Friends and family noticed my sudden shift in behavior, the way I had pulled away from the world, but they could never understand the depth of confusion and fear that had taken root in me.

I felt like a ghost, wandering through life, invisible to those who couldn’t see the storm brewing beneath my surface. They couldn’t grasp the reality of living with that weight—the fear that gripped me like a vice, tightening every day, reminding me that the fragility of life was a constant shadow.

Instead, I wore a mask of indifference, nodding along as they tried to reach out. I felt disconnected from everything that once mattered, from the friends who laughed and danced and lived without a care. I was trapped in my own mind, where the echoes of past losses played on repeat, drowning out the joy that surrounded me.

It wasn’t until I was twenty years old that it happened again.

My existential thoughts had settled into a more manageable rhythm. Beans passed away, his absence still a bittersweet ache in my heart. He died at the ripe age of seventeen. He had a long and happy life.  I moved to a town less than an hour away from home, seeking a fresh start. There, I found a job at a factory—a mundane gig, but it paid the bills for my one-bedroom apartment. My main responsibility was running the forklift, a task that became second nature over time.

I won’t bore you with the details of factory life, but it was the stability I needed. On the side, I managed to sell some of my illustrations, a small lifeline to my creativity. There was a local art gallery that allowed me to showcase my work, and every so often, a piece would catch someone’s eye. Those sales provided just enough extra cash to take my girlfriend out on dates.

Myra was a breath of fresh air—nothing like me at all. She was a soft-spoken brunette with a passion for gardening that shone through in everything she did. It seemed as if she radiated warmth, lighting up every room she entered. I often found myself envying her boundless enthusiasm for life, wishing I could soak up some of that joy.

We met at the art gallery one fateful day. I was hanging up some new pieces, concentrating intently on getting the placement just right, when I felt a presence behind me. “Hello,” she said softly, her voice gentle enough not to startle me. I whipped around to find her deep green eyes sparkling with curiosity, a shy smile playing on her lips. I likely romanticized this moment more than I should have, but it quickly became one of my favorite memories.

She wore a modest button-down shirt, complemented by a cute little cardigan that made her look effortlessly charming. Her glasses were slightly oversized, magnifying her expressive eyes and the smattering of freckles across her cheeks and the bridge of her nose.

“Could I buy this one?” she asked, pointing to the very drawing I was trying to straighten on the wall. It was a sketch of Beans in a lush garden, his shiny fur contrasting beautifully against the bushes of the flowers. I chuckled nervously, feeling a flush of embarrassment wash over me. “Yeah, it’s Beans,” I replied, immediately regretting how awkward I sounded.

She looked at me with a hint of confusion but then giggled, clearly amused by my flustered state, and waited patiently for me to explain.

“Beans was my dog,” I said, my heart fluttering as I shared this intimate piece of my past. Her smile softened, and she asked, “Was? I’m sorry for your loss… He was quite the looker.” Her tone was gentle, her hands folded in front of her, radiating kindness.

“Thank you,” I managed, offering a half-smile. At that moment, I realized I wouldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t ask her out right then and there. I wasn’t the type to take risks, but something about this interaction felt significant.

“What’s your name?” I asked, my nerves bubbling beneath the surface.

“Do you ask all your clients that?” she teased, clearly aware of my intentions.

“No, no! I just… you seem nice. I don’t meet many people worth talking to around here,” I admitted, the truth spilling out before I could second-guess myself.

“I’m Myra, it’s nice to meet you—” she paused, clearly waiting for me to introduce myself.

“Jude,” I said, filling in the gap. “You know, I wouldn’t mind giving this piece to you. I would only ask a favor.” I tried to sound brave, but I felt my palms grow sweaty.

“Oh really? And what might that be?” she asked playfully, a sparkle of curiosity in her eyes.

“Just get coffee or dinner with me sometime. Whatever you prefer. Maybe you can show me your favorite spot—I’ve only been to the Subway down the street since I’m not originally from here,” I rambled, a rush of words escaping me. I had never felt so flustered around a woman before.

Her smile widened as she listened to my awkward proposal. “I’d love that,” she replied, her voice warm and inviting. She suggested meeting at the coffee shop a few blocks from the gallery the next morning. I had work scheduled, but I didn’t hesitate to call in with a fake family emergency, eager to seize this opportunity.

I approached the quaint shop around 9:30 am, just as she requested. She was already there, perched on a cozy chair, a delicate cup of coffee cradled in her hands and lost in the pages of a book. She looked stunning in a flowing floral skirt that danced around her ankles and a softly tucked-in button-down shirt that highlighted her effortless charm. Her modesty and natural beauty were simply breathtaking, and in that moment, the world around us seemed to fade away.

Our first date unfolded like a beautiful dream. We fell into an endless conversation about life, art, and plants, topics that seemed to flow effortlessly between us. Laughter punctuated our words, mingling with moments of profound connection that hinted at a deeper bond. It truly felt like love at first sight. I was nineteen, and she was just twenty, and in that small café, we found a spark that would change everything.

Months later, as my twenty-first birthday approached, I was on my way to visit my sister for the first time in ages. My sister had heard so much about Myra and insisted I bring her along. The car was filled with our shared music and laughter as we drove through the familiar landscape of my childhood. 

There had been some kind of accident on the main road, so we decided to take the back roads. I was kind of excited to show off my knowledge of the serene roads that lead back to my hometown. We approached a little rickety bridge that I had driven over at least a hundred times. “Hold on tight, it’s bumpy,” I said with a smile. As we reached the middle of the bridge, I heard a sound that made my heart drop. Loud, creaking metal. I felt the car begin to tilt before it crashed into the rushing river below. 

I didn’t have time to warn Myra or even undo my own seat belt. I hit my face hard off of the steering wheel before the airbag blew up in my face. I was knocked out cold. When I woke up, I was in neck-deep water. It was rushing through the car. 


Time seemed to freeze as chaos erupted. I didn’t have a chance to warn Myra or even unbuckle my seat belt. The impact jolted me forward, and I struck my face hard against the steering wheel before the airbag deployed, engulfing me in a cloud of fabric and confusion. I blacked out.

As I came to my senses, I felt Myra clawing at my arm, desperate to wake me. The gravity of our situation hit me like a tidal wave. The car had flipped upside down, and the rushing water left us with no air pocket, no sanctuary. I frantically pulled at the door handles and kicked against the door, but there was no escape; the car was helplessly swept under the current.

I looked over at Myra, whose eyes were wide with terror, her movements primal and frantic. She kicked and flailed, searching for air. My heart raced, torn between the overwhelming fear that threatened to swallow me whole and an intense desire to protect her.

Drawing on a sense of determination, I grasped Myra’s arm and pulled her close, wrapping my arms around her with a fierce resolve. She fought against me, but there was nowhere to go. I wasn’t going to let go, no matter what.

Her struggles began to fade. In those agonizing seconds, I felt her body grow limp in my embrace, and devastation crashed over me like the icy water that enveloped us. I had lost her. Yet, even in my grief, I felt the icy fingers of death closing in on me. My final breath stung as I involuntarily inhaled the river’s deadly embrace.
