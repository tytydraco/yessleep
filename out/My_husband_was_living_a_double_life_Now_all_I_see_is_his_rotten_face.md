Who is Terrence Mckee? 

That is a complicated question, one I wish I could fully answer. But, as time’s gone on, it’s become one I don’t think I’ll ever understand. 

You hear stories all the time about people living multiple lives: the devoted husband and the closeted pedophile, the loving family man and the abuser, the gentle butterfly and the weekend killer. 

The sibling, the mother, the significant other—they’re always just as shocked as the general public once the truth is finally revealed. I always wondered, how could they *not* know. This was supposed to be their person. Surely they had to have known *something*, surely there must have been some sort of writing on the wall.

But now I understand.

Terrence used to be my doting husband. He was the type of man who would nurse me like a child whenever I was sick and came home wielding flowers on special occasions. He was a quiet man, good with his hands, and most importantly, simple. I’ve relied on him since my carpal tunnel worsened, and the unforgivable job market tightened. He worked like a dog, pulling in night shifts and working doubles so he could put food on the table for us. While it wasn’t always pretty, we made it work, and we remained hopeful that things would turn around.

We lived simple lives. No drama. Inseparable for nearly a decade. 

He was a handsome devil, too: a cool, trimmed head of umber hair, baby-smooth skin, and a strong jawline. I was a lucky woman in that department, and my friends always made a point to let me know it.  

One day I received a phone call from his superintendent, Earl. “It’s bad,” he warned me. “Real bad.” 

The scene at the hospital knocked the wind out of my lungs. His face was full of bandages; I couldn’t even tell it was him. But I held his injured body close, my tears soaking the baby-blue gown wrapped around his purpled, welt-riddled skin. 

I had never seen Earl cry, but his brawny, hunched-over body struggled that morning. His breathing was sparse as he fought through the disbelief and the sobs. “I should have been there, Kyla. I should have.”

We held each other in the darkness, amongst the blinking lights of the machines. There was a faint glow from the hallway and muffled chatter trickled in from underneath the closed door. 

“What happened, Earl?” I managed to ask through a subsiding wave of snivels. 

“I don’t know all the details, Kyla. I just came in this morning and found him like this at the job site.”

“Well, is he okay?”

His body trembled, his face collapsing into his hands. 

“*Earl*? Will he be okay?”

He placed a gentle hand upon my shoulder. “It’s really not my place to say. I think you should have a word with the doctors.”

Maxillofacial trauma is what they called it. A fractured skull, caved-in cheekbone, broken jaw–all accompanied by heavy contusions. The bandages were there to protect the open wounds from infection, of which there were many. 

“You need to prepare yourself,” the doctor informed me. “It is not uncommon for patients with acute brain trauma to suffer long-lasting complications.”

“But...but…he’ll be fine, right?” I sputtered, desperate for reassurance. “He’ll make a full recovery?”

The doctor's lips were pursed. “Physically, yes. He will require some extensive facial reconstruction surgery. He may never look the same again.” She glanced up from her clipboard. “But the real problem will be cognitive. And only time will tell for that.” 

It’s impossible to describe what it was like hearing those words. Nearly a decade together, and in one moment, one infinitesimally, fleeting moment, and everything threatened to come crashing down. 

You don’t just move past certain catastrophes. They happen to you, and you’re never the same.

I retreated into myself for the next few days, trying to be there for my husband and process everything. It was Terrence who got in the accident, but I was suffering in my own way too, through the helplessness and the fear of the unknown. The days and nights all felt the same under the fluorescent lights of the hospital. I remained in the chair by his bedside, waiting for some sort of response.

It came first from the County Sheriff's office. The officer wouldn’t tell me everything, but he told me they suspected Terrence had been copper stripping from multiple construction sites around the city.  They found coils of copper wire at the scene as well as crudely cut copper pipes that were consistent with other locations. They figured that was the weapon used in the attack, but nothing was discovered. The sheriff informed me that they were currently combing through the surveillance footage, but had hoped to speak to Terrence once he was of sound mind and health to hopefully provide an alibi.

I kept my mouth shut and expressed my belief that my husband was innocent, but I would be in touch once he was ready.

I shook my head in disbelief:

my doting husband, the thief. 

Earl called later in the week to my chagrin.

“Kyla, ” he sighed, “you know if you two needed the money, all you had to do is ask.” 

As if I knew what he did with the money. We were in the same run-down house that we’d always lived in. We hadn’t taken a vacation in years. But I apologized to the poor man as my mummified husband lay stiff in his bed with tubes stuck in his throat. 

Days flowed into weeks, weeks turned into months. Eventually, the bandages were removed. What I saw behind them was not Terrence. The sight of his bashed-in face made me recoil with anguish, and I’m ashamed to admit, fear. His face was yellowing, but there was a crater on one side where his cheek and jaw should have been to support his face. I Imagined the strength of the impact and the number of blows that would be required to collapse a face inward like that. It left my stomach in knots, and I held him tighter.   

Slowly he battled his way through recovery, and every day he spoke a little more.

He was most active in the evenings, cycling through soft whispers and whimpers that I couldn’t understand. I only understood the hurt; so I held his hand until sleep washed over him. I didn’t know how much of him was really there, but I wanted to be the first person he would see.

His memory, sadly, was in shambles, just as the doctor had warned. He couldn't control his emotions—either he broke down into inconsolable tears or grumbled in frustration whenever I brought up that fateful evening. He denied any wrongdoing whatsoever and had no recollection as to who could have harmed him. Hell, in some moments he still forgot my name. I didn’t expect him to have all of the answers, but he still offered what he could to the police.

When we finally got to go home, we stayed isolated. He was understandably embarrassed by his appearance and wanted to wait until the surgery was completed before he saw his family and friends. So we remained hidden, and I cared for him like he would have cared for me. I did. I really tried.

But his sleep talking had gotten worse. The low whispers began to morph into incoherent rambling. Every night he would plead and bicker with the shadows. And for what? I couldn't understand. I laid stiff as a board beside him, waiting for the flurry of agitation to simmer. 

*Why like this? Why?*

*Why have you forsaken me?*

*I did what was asked!*

*Let it go. Let me go.*

*How much more?*

He would claw at the pillow and thrash under the covers. One night he clattered the table lamp against the wall, the ceramic shattering into tiny pieces as he remained in the grips of slumber. I pretended to sleep, not knowing how to help or what to do. 

When I brought up the night terrors, he shrugged them off like they were nothing. Just another bad dream, he supposed. 

He now had an explosive temper. Tiny inconveniences could easily set him ablaze: things like a dirty dish left unwashed or his keys being misplaced. And other nights, we were back to the way it was before. Being with him was easy. We laid sprawled out on the sofa, laughing, watching a movie. That's what made everything so difficult to process; I was constantly tiptoeing through a maze of land mines. 

I barely recognized this man anymore. And I think he could sense it.

Another evening, I was vacuuming and found a sea of dusty money underneath a loose floorboard. It wasn’t like I was particularly looking, but maybe subconsciously I was. When confronted, he played dumbfounded. When I pushed further, he lashed out. He had saved his overtime money to surprise me with a honeymoon cruise, he barked back. I had to let it go, but I grew wary. I didn't know what to believe anymore. 

After a particularly challenging week of strife, we enjoyed a calm night by the fireplace. Surgery was confirmed for the upcoming weekend. 

“If I don’t look like I used to…” he said, pouring me a generous glass of shiraz, “don’t feel like you’re obligated or anything, Kyla.” He walked into the living room from the kitchen and handed me a glass. 

I snapped at him. “Are you kidding?”

“I’m just saying,” he said softly, looking down at his glass. “This whole thing hasn’t just been my nightmare. It hasn’t been fair to you, either.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” I stated. “New face or not.” We clinked glasses. I grabbed his arm and switched on the television, snuggling up with him under the blankets.

It was the last movie we shared together.

\*\*\*

I wouldn’t say I was fully there the evening everything went down. What I remember is in fragments. There was a blackness that consumed the area I was confined in. My body slid across the tiny space. What I believed to be rope was tied so tight I lost feeling in my hands. There was movement; I could feel the vibrations from the walls.  A heavy drowsiness clung to me, tugging me back into a blank state, but the rigorous pounding from my head and the occasional streak of light that would trail in and disappear as quickly as it arrived wrestled me back into my bleak reality.

There were banjos playing in a quick tempo. Terrence always preferred the upbeat fluidity of Bluegrass.

Suddenly, everything jerked to a stop. I could hear a door open and some frantic voices shouting back at each other outside. They seemed to be traveling further and further away. Another sound, a loud ticking, seemed to intensify.

“There. Are you happy?” the familiar voice growled. “Here is the final deed!” The muffled sounds waned off in the distance. “Release me!”

A chorus of rapid dings cut through the night. 

There was rumbling. *Tick-tick-ticking*. 

A large beam of light sliced through a tiny crack before me. It was blinding. And I finally realized where I was, locked inside the trunk of our car.

The steady clacking, the *tick-tick-ticking* of the train tracks, became clear.

In the final moments, there was the loudest sound I’d ever heard: a blast of a horn.

And I no longer heard his voice. 

\*\*\*

So, who is Terrence Mckee, you ask? 

To that, I ask back, which one?

The doctor, Terrence, tells me I’m close to making a full recovery. But *his* face is dripping tiny waterfalls of blood that splatter on the linoleum floor. The rotted hole that used to be his face has gotten *so* much worse. Some ripples of melted flesh jiggle slightly from what I guess to be his mouth hole as he informs me that there are many complications before me—side effects from being in a coma for so long. But he is elated I am back. 

I want to scream. In fact, I do, but Doctor Terrence just runs his hands through his thick, feathery hair and proceeds to wave for some assistance. 

There was massive head trauma, this I know from the pounding in my forehead. But it’s a miracle, he says, that I made it out alive.

Two nurse Terrences rush into the room, with their ashy stubble and smooth hairdos. They tell me that I’ve made real progress, but their caved-in faces are just as bad as the doctors. The smell of the rot and the puss leaking from the wounds makes me want to vomit. 

The blonde one tells me I look good, given the circumstances. The red-haired one’s subtle grimace from the “good” side of her face seems to suggest otherwise. 

A peculiar form of Pareidolia is what they called it. Doctor Terrence is hopeful that it will fade away as my brain injury recovers. But he wants to keep me and run more tests. And I don’t mind because the drugs help me relax (and keep me a little loopy).  

The nursing assistants, Terrence and Terrence, they both tell me I can go home soon. But to which Terrence, I’m not sure. I’m not entirely sure I even want to go home.

The one that left me for dead terrifies me. I figure he should have his new face by now, so maybe that has changed him and helped him heal. But there are still so many questions.

I’ve spoken with Earl a couple of times since I’ve awoken. He called and told me that they are actively searching for the person who attacked Terrence. The police have studied the surveillance footage that night and it shows Terrence’s limp body being dumped past the metal gate, but the video is so grainy and the feed strangely cuts out. It's so dark that they’ve pushed it to the public in the hopes of finding witnesses. He apologized for ever thinking my husband could have stolen from him.

There have been a lot of stories in the news lately; watching TV has become all I do. 

A mysterious amount of bodies have been recovered at multiple construction sites. Mass graves of missing people, most of the sites eerie and abandoned. 

I’ve heard from Earl, but I haven't heard from the real Terrence. I don’t know what to think about that. 

I pray for the old Terrence, the one I knew. I fear he’s gone forever. But I hold on to the delusion that he’ll be back, his smooth skin and chiseled chin. I imagine he’ll have a warm home-cooked meal for me, waiting. 

And everything can finally go back to [normal](https://www.reddit.com/r/aproyal/comments/kpu2co/please_read_if_you_enjoyed_any_of_my_stories/).
