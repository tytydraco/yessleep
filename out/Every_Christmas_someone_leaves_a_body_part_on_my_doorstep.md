The package arrived, just like it did sometime every December, in a white box with a red ribbon. It was waiting on my porch when I opened the door. There was a card attached. That was different. The boxes were always blank; no address, nothing to trace. I hesitated before reaching for the card. We would need to call the police like we always did, and they’d want to check the package for fingerprints or other clues. But they hadn’t found anything in ten years of trying, so I decided there wasn’t much point in my waiting for them.

I opened the card and dropped it when it started making noise.

*Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh*

*Ah-ah*

*… Last Christmas, I gave you my heart*

*But the very next day, you gave it away*

*This year, to save me from-*

The music stopped when I snatched up the card and closed it. It was one of those stupid, novelty-singing cards, apparently. That was pretty morbid considering what I knew was in the box. I pulled my bathrobe tight and looked around even though I was sure there would be no sign of the mysterious gift giver. It did look like snow, though.

“James,” I called back into the house. “It’s here.”

My husband walked out onto the porch.

“It’s a little early this year,” he said, looking down at the box.

I handed him the card. “This showed up, too. Careful when you open it. There’s a song.”

James opened the card and the melody came crashing out like a runaway dog. He studied the card for a few seconds and then closed it.

“Did you read the card?” he asked.

I shook my head. “*Last Christmas* manifesting out of thin air freaked me out and I dropped it.”

James pulled me close and kissed my head. “I bet. There’s a message written inside. It says, ‘*This is the year*.’”

I shivered. “The year for what?”

James shook his head and shrugged. “Come on back inside. I’ll make breakfast and we can call Detective Hill.”

I was going for my third cup of coffee when there was a knock on the door. James got up from the table to answer. A few moments later, he came back into the kitchen followed by a young man in a gray suit.

“Would you like some coffee, Detective?” I asked the man.

Hill shook his head. “No time. I’ve got to be across town in…” he checked his watch, “fifteen minutes ago.”

“Sorry for imposing on your time,” James said, the sarcasm so soft you could knit it into a sweater.

I’m not even sure the detective noticed.

“A couple of guys will take the package to the lab,” he said. “Though, if it’s anything like last year, I’m not expecting much.”

“What was in there, this time?” I asked.

“Emma…” James said, putting a comforting hand on my arm.

“I’d like to know,” I replied, forcing a limp smile.

Hill hesitated, then cleared his throat. “A hand. We’ll need to wait for the official, ya know, but from my first look I’d say female, caucasian, probably twenties or thirties judging by the skin. Oh, and there was a wedding ring.”

“So everything basically identical to me?” I asked.

Hill nodded. “Anything on the Ring camera?”

James pulled up the app on his phone and handed it to the detective. We all huddled together to watch, even though James and I had already reviewed the clip at least a dozen times that morning. Our Ring picked up activity around 3 am. A figure was approaching on the sidewalk and was just coming into frame when the video went completely white.

“The prick shined a flashlight directly into the camera,” Hill said. “Hell of a flashlight, too; blinded the Ring.”

James put his phone away. “Can you put a patrol car in the neighborhood?”

“What good would that do?” Hill asked. “The package is already here. We won’t be seeing our friend until next December.”

“We don’t know that for sure,” my husband replied. “The guy could always come back to watch the scene of the crime.”

Hill shook his head. “We tried that last year and the only result was I had to justify a ton of overtime for the patrol guys. Sorry. I really do need to run but I’ll keep you both in the loop.” He shook hands with me, then James. “I know this is only my second year with the case and you all were close with my predecessor, but I want you to understand I take this seriously. We’re going to catch this creep, Emma.”

*I’m not holding my breath*, I thought.

“I know you will,” I lied. “Detective Barton said he was getting close before he retired.”

“He, uh, yeah. He left me with some leads,” Hill said, heading for the door. “Happy Holidays.”

“You, too,” James replied, walking him out.

I had a nightmare that night. It was a familiar dream like an old friend that visited, unannounced and unwanted, once a year. Boxes–an endless mountain of white boxes bound in red ribbon–lay in front of me. They began falling, one after another, opening as they fell. Body parts tumbled out: arms and hands and teeth and eyes and everything. While the flesh was still in the air, the pieces became bodies; the corpses were all women who looked like me. Then they *were me*. I ran but something was chasing me, binding me, shaking me-

“Emma. **Emma**.”

I gasped and scratched at the man holding me. They yelped and jerked back. A lamp clicked on and I saw I was in my bedroom.

“Oh, James, oh God, I’m sorry,” I said.

Four bright red scratch marks stood out on my husband’s cheek.

He smiled. “I’m okay. I think you were having a nightmare. The usual one?”

I nodded. James wrapped me up in a hug and held me until I fell back into a wonderfully dreamless sleep.

The next morning was cold and clear with a promise of snow building by the minute. I took the day off work to try to process everything I was feeling from the day before. After breakfast, I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood. I would have invited James but he was still sleeping; I felt guilty about scratching him even though he tried to play it off. The walk started fine. The first snowflakes were falling when I saw him. He noticed me at about the same time.

Nate. My ex-boyfriend. Tall and lean like I remembered him, though his long black hair and beard now had a touch of gray.

I hadn’t seen him in eleven years; not since our senior year of high school. Nate the Ex. Stalker Nate.

He was standing in the yard of a house less than a mile from my own. He looked surprised to see me. I was standing in the middle of the road openly staring. Nate waved. My lungs weren’t working. It was like they were zip-tied to my spine. I didn’t wave back. I turned and ran.

James was making me a cup of hot chocolate when the phone rang. I was sitting at the kitchen table, hands still shaking. Nate living in my neighborhood…my mind couldn’t get a hold of the idea. Couldn’t accept and understand and file that information away.

James picked up the phone. “Hello? Yeah…yeah, one second, I’ll put you on speakerphone.”

*It’s Hill*, he mouthed to me, putting the phone on the table. Hill’s voice came out.

“So your high school stalker moved in down the street?” the detective asked.

“Yeah, we’re going to need that cruiser outside,” James said, sitting next to me.

Hill took a minute to answer. “Crazy timing. Have you two kept in touch, Emma?”

“God no. He slashed my tires after our breakup. Stalked me for weeks. Calls where he wouldn’t speak but I knew it was him. Nate tormented me for weeks.”

“We checked him out when the packages started showing up, right?” Hill asked. “I mean…”

I debated for a second then went to the fridge for a beer.

“Yeah, he seems like the obvious candidate given our history. But the police couldn’t find anything. No physical evidence, nothing linking him. And I hadn’t heard from Nate for over a year when the, uh, gifts started showing up.”

“What caused Nate to leave you alone?”

I glanced at James. “The new guy I started dating had a talk with him.”

Hill snorted. “As a cop, I’m not supposed to condone that but I get it. Okay. *Okay*. The stalker ex showing up right around the tenth anniversary of the packages when you get some menacing cards saying, ‘This will be our year,’ I will admit that is suspect. I’ll have a unit keep an eye on him for a few days to see if he does anything unusual. That’s the most I can do right now without any evidence.”

“We appreciate it,” James said. “In the meantime, is it legal for me to go sink a claymore in the flowerbed outside in case someone tries to leave another box on the porch?”

Hill just grunted and hung up.

“I think he likes me,” James said.

The second gift of the month arrived that night. I woke up to the sound of James cursing from downstairs. He wasn’t the kind of guy who yelled a lot, especially in the middle of the night, so I was moving as soon as I grabbed the baseball bat from under the bed. I found James standing in our kitchen with the back door open. He turned when he heard me run down the stairs. The look on his face stopped me as sure as an electrified fence.

“He left another box,” James said.

I gripped the bat tighter. [“Please shut the door.”](https://www.travisbrownwriting.com/)
