Part I: The Plant

January 13th, 4:12 AM

We were working. A large nuclear plant. Many workers. Working on one thing. A potential meltdown. The reactor was smoking. We ran tests and worked as hard as we could. We worked for hours on this. The alarms ringing the entire time. The manager barking orders at us like a ferocious dog. We listened to each and every order given. A harsh environment with a potential chance of disaster. We worked and worked. Ran around each problem attempting to fix it. A serious problem had occurred. Myself, 24 years old, young and wanting to succeed in life. Many others, much older and more experienced than me. All of a sudden, the alarms conclude. Had we fixed the issue? It was hard to tell. The smoke still emerged from the reactor. The sound of ringing occurs in my ears. We had fixed the problem.



Part II: The Sunrise

With the sunrise, I emerged from the intensity of the night. Into the freezing cold of the outside world. The night felt so long and constant. But we had done it. Some people are nearly always working in this place. I don’t get how they can do that. I find it to be genuinely impressive. I always want to be out of that place and with my family. A small 3 person family. We had a 4th but unfortunately he passed away early on in his life. I got in my car and drove home. I couldn’t wait to see my wife. Many people understand what life is meant to be. A life you enjoy. A life where you truly know what it means to live. A life where you hang out with your family and you go out to dinner and go on dates and do all the things that makes you happy. Many don’t understand their lives. They’re always working. They never see their families. They’re drinking and crying themselves to sleep each and every night wondering if they’ll ever live a good life. It truly makes you wonder.



Part III: The Home

I get home and within seconds of stepping in the door my son is running down the steps to greet me. He runs up and wraps his little arms around my leg.

“Hey buddy!” I say lethargically but with a happy tone in my voice. “How’d you sleep?”

“I slept well daddy!”

“That’s great!”

My son, 5 years old, a little bundle of joy. My wife walks down the stairs and stands on the second step from the floor.

“Hey honey!” I say with my son still wrapping his arms around my leg.

“Hey Jake!”

“How’d you sleep?”

“I slept well!”

“How was work?”

“It was crazy!”

“How so?”

"I’ll tell you later.” I say looking at her.

My wife, 23, a beautiful, bright-eyed, happy as can be, stay-at-home mom. The love of my life. We go to the kitchen table and sit down in the seats.

“Do you have school today?”

“I do!”

“Are you excited for it?”

“So excited! I can’t wait to see my friends.”

“I bet!”

“Do you have friends, daddy?”

“Well ,of course, I do!”

“What are their names?”

“Well, one of them is named Gabe.” “Hey, that’s my name!” “Yeah! He's this small, little, wonderful little kid. And he sure looks a lot like you!”

Gabe giggles at the comment.

“My other friend is named Sarah.”

My wife looks at me with a smile on her face. She grabs my hand and holds it tight.

“You better get going, Gabe! You don’t have much time!”

“You’re right!” He grabs his backpack and sprints out the door. The bus comes soon after that.

“I love you, Sarah!”

“I love you too, Jake!”

I lift her hand and kiss it.

“I’m glad I don’t have to work tonight!”

“I am too!”

“What do you say tonight we go to the drive-in and see Dirty Dancing and Ghost? A Swayze”

“I would love that! But what about Gabe.”

“We can just cover his eyes when inappropriate scenes.”

“They’ll still be a bit hard for him to grasp at his age.”

“Well, why don’t we give it a try anyway.”

“I would love to.”

“I’m gonna try to get a few hours of sleep before we go tonight.”

“I should probably get some sleep as well.”

“Didn’t you sleep okay?”

“I barely slept at all. I get so worried with you working at that plant.”

“We had a bit of an incident last night.”

“What happened?” she says with a concerned tone in her voice.

“An alarm started going off last night and we had to fix the reactor. But don’t worry we got it all figured out and we’re safe now. I’m here and I am so glad!”

“Thank God you’re okay.”

“I’ll be okay.”

I’ve been working there for a few years now and I’m planning on getting out of there whenever I can.

“You know, I have that screenplay for Hollywood. Maybe once I’ve gotten out of there, we can drive up to California and you guys can see the gorgeous sights of Beverly Hills, San Diego, Sacramento, Hollywood, and my personal favorite part of it, South Pasadena!”

“I would love it!” she says as a smile comes to her face.

I lean in and give her a kiss on the cheek. I then stand up.

“I’m gonna go to bed.”

“I’ll see you up there in a little bit.”

I walk upstairs and go to lie down in my bed. I look at the clock and it says “9:47 AM”.  I lie my head down and close my eyes. I love my family and my life at home.



Part IV: The Dream

I begin to dream. The dream is of 3 buddies and I going out to a restaurant called Wednesdays: Bar and Grill. A small restaurant that we always enjoyed going to for drinks and the best burgers in the world. We had inaudible conversations but we all laughed at the jokes we made even though we couldn’t hear it. I stand up and go to the bathroom. I open the bathroom door and 2 men in hazmat suits walk out of the bathroom past me. One of the men grabs one of my friends, forcefully dragging him out of the restaurant. The other grabs another one of my friends and does the same thing. I yell but it’s inaudible. I watch as they drag them out of the restaurant. Their skin melts slowly off of them while they are dragged out. Once they are near the door of the restaurant they are nearly fully melted into a skeleton when one of my friend’s arms detaches from his body. The man in the suit continues dragging him though. One more man in a hazmat suit comes out of the bathroom. He runs up to my friend and the process happens again starting with him being dragged out of the restaurant then melting while he is dragged out. My friends are disappearing like erasers against paper. Their skin being left on the floor of the restaurant. The door to the restroom opens once more and I turn around as a man in a hazmat suit grabs my shoulders and lifts me into the air. The window on his mask breaks and he drops me. He starts looking like he may be suffocating on something. He then starts coughing. With each cough a bit of black smoke emerges from his mouth. He starts charging at me while still coughing. I start screaming. My screams are inaudible.

I wake up in a deep sweat, my heart racing. The cold sweat leaking down my face like rain. My wife lies completely still next to me, unconscious. I try to keep a steady hold on my breath. It is difficult to manage my breath. After 5 minutes, I eventually pace my breath at a normal rate. I look at the clock. “2:38 PM” My son would be getting home soon. I stand up, get some clothes on, and go downstairs. I get a glass of water and proceed to sit down on the couch in my living room. I drink the water slowly trying to process the dream. “Did it mean something?”



Part V: The Television

I sit on the couch for an 15 watching television I scroll through the channels looking for something that might interest me in any way. I was scrolling quickly through the channels just looking for a show when something caught my eye. It was my house. My house was on the tv. I initially clicked past it by accident and immediately clicked back to it. There's the sound of transition music like you might see in Full House or something like that. It's mildly distorted and I decide to turn off the tv. I hear the sound of the front door opening behind me.

“Hello?”

It's my son.

“Hey son!”

“Where are you?”

“In the living room!”

“Ok.” The sound of his backpack echos through the quiet house and he runs into the living room the sounds of his shoes thudding against the ground. He jumps onto the couch next to me and snuggles up to me.

“Hey!” I say laughing a little.

“What’s funny?”

“You surprised me and it’s good to see you! How was your day?”

“It was good. It felt a little bit longer than I thought it would be but I saw James and Kory today!”

“Well that’s good!”

“There was one bad part though.”

“Oh no, what happened?”

“There was a big fight and 2 students start hitting each other really hard in the middle of class. We all had to leave the room while they did. It happened for a little while. It was kinda scary.”

“Fighting can be scary sometimes, but it happens and we just have to wait while it happens.”

“Have you ever been in a fight, daddy?”

“Yes I have. When I was in middle school, I was bullied a lot because of the clothes I wore and because my hair was always a little bit greasy looking. One day, one of the bullies came up to me and he made fun of me and then my mom and dad in a really mean way. He then smacked me across the face. That was when I decided to stand up for myself. I ran to him as fast as I could and tackled him to the ground. I punched and kicked him as hard as I could. I was so mad I didn’t even think about the consequences of my actions. I got taken out of school for 3 days. I don’t want you to fight anyone. I promise you that you won’t like yourself when you do.”

“I’m sorry that happened to you, daddy.”

“It’s okay, son.”

“What did he say?”

“I would prefer not to say it. It hurt me.”

“Okay.”

“The message of that story is not to fight people! Please don’t fight anyone. Fighting is a bad things. Just talk to someone at your school about it. Tell an adult that they are bullying you and they will handle it.”

“I will.”

“Do you want to watch something on the TV?”

“Yes.”

“What do you want to watch?”

“Gumball.”

“You want to watch Gumball?”

“Yes!” He says gleefully.

I grab the remote and turn on the tv. Once the tv is on it immediately shows the inside of our house. There’s someone in the entry way of our home. He’s walking around with a camera. He turns to the right and starts walking to the living room. The camera then focuses on me. Then jerks to the left to reveal someone who’s melting standing behind me. I turn around fearfully and look all around me. There’s nothing there. I look past the entryway to the living room and there’s nobody there. I turn to look around at the TV. Dateline is on the television. I breathe heavily. I grab the remote and rapidly scroll through the channels eventually switching to Cartoon Network. The Amazing World Of Gumball is on.

“Are you okay, dad?”

“Yes, just got scared that you were seeing that show.”

“Okay.” 

What is going on?



Part VI: The Drive-In

“Jake, are you almost ready?”

“Yes honey!”

“Do you have the tickets?”

“I sure do!”

I run down the stairs so fast I nearly fall down.

“Are you excited, Gabe?”

“I don’t know. What are we doing?”

“We’re going to the drive-in!”

“What’s that?”

“It’s a place where you sit in your cars and watch movies!”

“That sounds cool!”

“We’re going to see two of your mom’s favorite movies!”

“Ooh! What are they?”

“Dirty Dancing and Ghost!”

“Those sound so cool!”

“Are you just saying that to make us happy?”

“No! I’m excited!”

“Well I’m glad!”

I open the door and we walk out to the car. Gabe runs out to the car and starts pulling on the door handle. I laugh at his excitement.

“Are you excited?”

"Yes! Yes! Yes!” he replies giddily.

I unlock the door and he gets in the car. We both get in the car after him.

“Everyone buckled up?”

“Yeah!!!” he replies excitedly.

I put the car in reverse and look in all the blind spots and hidden spots to make sure nobody is coming. We get going on the road. I tune into the radio station 106.4.

“Jake.” the radio whispers!

I gasp. Then change the station to 97.1.

“Welcome to Nevada's Classic Rock Radio! Today is a bright and sunny day. It’s breaking into the hundreds today!”

“What’s wrong, hon?”

“Just thought I saw a cat about to run onto the road.”

“I didn’t see it?”

“It was on my side of the road.”

“Okay.”

I continue driving. After 45 minutes, we make it to the drive-in. The person at the ticket booth scans our tickets and we drive into a spot and park the car.

“Would anyone like snacks or drinks?”

“Yes, please!”

“Yes, thank you hon.”

“What would you guys like?”

“I’ll take a big popcorn” says Gabe excitedly.

“How about a small popcorn?” I reply.

“Okay.” He says clearly mildly disappointed

“What else?”

“a middle sized sprite.”

“You mean medium?”

“Yes.”

“I can do that for you. What would you like, honey?”

“Just a burger and a large coke, please.”

“You’ve got it.”

I grab her hand and squeeze it tightly. I get out of the car and head to the snack bar. There’s a bit of a line. “Jake?” a voice says from behind me.

I turn and see that it’s my friend Ryan.

“Oh my God! Hey Ryan! I thought you were working tonight.”

“Why would I be working tonight?”

“Well I thought you were scheduled for tonight.”

“I couldn’t go to work anyway.”

“Why?"

"Because the light won’t stop shining from above me. I think it may be about my time.”

“What?”

“Well, don’t you know? They are watching us right now. They’re picking us up and putting us in urns" “What are you talking about?”

“You wouldn’t understand. You haven’t figured it out yet.”

I look to see if the line has moved at all and look back to see that Ryan has disappeared. The line has moved a little so I move forward into my spot in line. I am concerned.

“I don’t know what’s happening to me.” I whisper.

“Excuse me. Sir?”

I am at the front of the line now.

“Can I take your order?”

“Oh, yes! May I get one medium sprite, one large sprite, one large coke, 2 burgers, and a small popcorn?”

“Will that be all for you today?”

“It will.”

“Your total is $23.78 and will you be paying with cash or credit?”

“Cash.”

“Okay.”

I open my wallet and find no cash in the pocket of my wallet.

“I guess I’ll be paying with credit.”

I look for my credit card and find it in one of the wallet sleeves. I pull it out and give it to the cashier. He swipes my card and hands it back. I try to grab it from him. He won’t let it go though.

“Hey? Can I get my card back?”

The cashier starts shaking and it increasingly grows more violent.

“Hey, are you okay?”

The cashier lets go of the card and collapses to the floor of the snack bar.

“Hey!”

I run around the side of the snack bar and open the door. I don't know what to do so I start performing CPR on the cashier but he won’t stop shaking. I press 20 times on his chest and give him 3 breaths. I start pressing again and my hands puncture through his chest. I scoot backwards to the open door of the snack bar. The cashier then stands up and covers his face. He starts exhaling black smoke through the space between each of his fingers. He wheezes black smoke every time he breathes. He then takes his hands off his face to reveal the glass mask of the hazmat suit. It has replaced his face. He’s coughing black smoke in my direction as I watch in horror.

“HELP!”

I then blink and I’m back in the snack bar giving the cashier CPR. Another employee runs in and tells me to back off. He calls for medics who are on sight. They get him on a gurney and get him out of the

“What just happened?” I ask fearfully.

"This employee has seizures. They could be deadly. Thank God you were here to help him.”

“What about the guy in the hazmat suit?”

“What guy in a hazmat suit?”

I point in the direction where the man was. The guy looks at the screen behind him.

“We’ve been doing a showing of Chernobyl for those who wanted to see it on a larger screen. It’s truly haunting.”

“Oh, okay.”

“What did you order?”

“On the receipt.”

“Okay! We’ll get that started for you.”

“Thank you.”

The movie screen lights up. I take deep breaths to calm down.

“Order up!”

“Thank you!”

“Will you need a cup holder for the drinks?”

“I think I’ll be okay. Thank you for the offer.”

I walk back to the car and get in the driver’s seat. I tune the radio to the correct station and the audio for the movie starts. *Be My Baby* by *The Ronettes* plays as the movie begins. What is happening to me?



Part VII: The Staircase

We arrive home that night. I lift the sleeping Gabe into my arms and carry him into the house. I open the door and put him in his bed. I cover him up and turn on his night light. I kiss him on the forehead and walk out closing the door behind me.

“Hey Honey? Can I tell you something?”

“Of course you can, Jake.”

“Something’s bothering me.”

“I can tell.”

“You can?”

“I can. What is it?”

“I’m having hallucinations.”

“Is it possibly stress?”

“I don’t know.”

“What are you hallucinating?”

“I’m seeing people.”

“Like who?”

“In a dream I had when I went to sleep earlier I saw 3 of my friends’ skin melt off of their bodies. On the tv earlier, I saw someone watching me with a camera and there was someone melting standing behind me. At the drive-in I saw Ryan. I know you hate Ryan but he told me things. He said something like they are putting us in caskets and that they are cremating us. And then right after that I watched the cashier have a seizure and during the seizure he turned into a monster. A person in a hazmat suit breathing black smoke. I know all of this sounds strange. I think it’s strange too. I’m terrified!”

“Jake calm down! Calm down! It’s not real.”

“Then how am I supposed to explain this? I can’t possibly have schizophrenia. I would’ve had it all my life if that were the case. I don’t think I could have PTSD. I don’t know what’s happening.”

I start to break down crying.

“I need help.”

My wife hugs me and holds me tight.

“Just take deep breaths. Calm down. Heaven is gonna help you.”

I breathe heavily and calm down after 6 minutes.

“I love you, honey.”

“I love you too, Jake”

We kiss and hold each other. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I stand up and walk to the stairs. I go upstairs to Gabe’s room and kiss him on the forehead again. I walk back to the stairs and the stairs go higher now. A light shining at the top of the stairs. I finally understand it. I walk up the stairs and at the top I see a white light. Almost blinding. In the light I see a pale horse and directly next to me stands my son that I hadn't seen in years. I understand
