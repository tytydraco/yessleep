What an absolutely perverse reimagining of the last ten years.

But I mean, that’s Bryan to a tee, right? The man just *loves* to tell his stories. A God’s honest raconteur, through and through. Such a vivid imagination, Emma and Harper notwithstanding.

That’s all they are, though: stories. Tall tales. Malicious fabrications, if you’re feeling particularly vindictive. For a so-called *“pathological introvert”*, he sure does spin one a hell of a yarn. A New York Times bestselling author who supposedly spent the first half of his life entirely isolated, with no background in writing. His prose must have just fallen from the sky and landed in his lap one day. Or maybe, just maybe, he’s not the innocent recluse he’d have you believe.

Funny, right? The man can be lying right to your face, and you may not know. Bryan’s dazzling enough to sell most people a complete contradiction without objection. Sleight of hand at its finest.

You see, I know Bryan better than he knows himself. So, take it from me, if there’s something to understand about the man, it’s this: he covets one thing above all else.

Control.

Makes total sense to me. After all, the storyteller controls the plot, no? Decides what information to include and omit. Paints the character’s intentions and implies their morality. Embroiders theme and meaning within the subtext. That’s why they say history is written by the victors. What is history but a very long, very bloated story, wildly overdue for its final chapter?

So, once the dust settled, I shouldn’t have felt surprised when I found his duplicitous, so-called “*public record*” open on his laptop in that hotel room, posted to this forum. And yet, I was. I found myself genuinely shocked that he, of all people, would go behind my back and try to control the story in such a brazen, ham-fisted way. Waving a gun in my face, making insane accusations. All these years later, that serpent is still inventing new ways to surprise me. A snake slithering its tongue, selling a doctored narrative to whoever will listen.

Need an example? Here’s one:

Yes, poor Dave didn’t have a tattoo on the sole of left foot. But you know who does?

Bryan.

Interesting that he never bothered to mention *that* in his best seller.

Am I saying he was/is The Angel Eye Killer? I wouldn’t go that far. Unlike Bryan, I don’t make accusations without certainty. What I am saying, though, is he left that critical detail out of the *public record* to manipulate you all, his beloved, captive audience.

Just weaving another compelling story.

Now, back to his favorite pair of mirages, Emma and Harper.

There were two unidentified individuals present in that hotel room when I arrived: a teen, and a middle-aged woman. Bryan *said* they were Emma and Harper. Believed it without a shadow of a doubt in his mind. Endorsed they manifested on his doorstep that morning, hands crusted with blood, reeking of fresh, saccharine death. Both were afflicted with some sort of brain-liquefying sickness, though, which rendered them mute, daft and rabid - so it’s not like they could corroborate his claims about their identity.

Even if they could have smiled and said Bryan was correct, agreed that they were figments of his imagination newly adorned with flesh, would that have been enough? Emma and Harper have only existed within his skull. No one knows them but him, so how would we ever be so sure?

I didn’t recognize those two individuals. Never saw them before in my life. I can only regurgitate what Bryan told me. But we all are now aware of his disingenuous predilections, yes?

Therefore, can anyone say for certain *who* exactly died in that hotel room after I arrived?

But hey, the man wants to tell stories?

Fine by me. I know a good one. May not land me a book deal, but I’ll give it an honest swing all the same.

The irony of typing it using his laptop, the same one that he used to write his memoir on The Angel Eye Killer - it just feels so right, too.

I’m aware you’ll read this, Bryan.

Consider it a warning shot.

Forty-eight hours.

I know you’re afraid, but it’s time to come home.

*Because of her worsening psychotic behavior, poor Annie was abandoned on the streets of Chicago at the tender age of thirteen.*

*When her father pushed her out of a moving sedan onto the crime-ridden streets of Englewood, she harbored an undiagnosed, semi-invisible genetic condition. Four years later, she received a diagnosis, and her psychiatric disturbances largely abated with proper treatment.*

*Every odd or violent behavior she exhibited was downstream of something out of poor Annie’s control. The girl’s ravings and outbursts weren’t her fault.*

*That said, if she had nothing physically wrong with her, wouldn’t her behaviors still have been out of her control? I would argue yes, but I don’t know that society would agree. After all, is there anything more American than making a martyr out of an ailing young woman?*

*Food for thought.*

\- - - - -

*Anyway, Annie’s surviving being teenage and homeless the best she can. Begging during the day, pickpocketing in the evening, living in an encampment under a bridge at night.*

*All the while, her disease is quietly ravaging her body. Primarily her liver and her brain, but other parts of her too, like her bones and her blood. Her health is failing, which is causing her behavior to become more erratic and her hallucinations to become more frequent.*

*When she rests her head on the cold dirt after a long day, there are only two thoughts floating through her mind. Every night, she dwells on those two thoughts for hours before she finds sleep; they infiltrate her very being like a cancer, expanding and erasing everything that came before it.*

*In addition, her nervous system is a bit addled because of the disease. Her brain experiences difficultly dissecting fact from fiction and reality from imagination, in a way a perfectly healthy brain would not.*

*So, when Annie lets those two thoughts swim through her consciousness, part of her truly believes they already have, or are going to, come true.*

1. *Annie imagines she has a friend, someone by her side through thick and thin, someone to pat her back and keep her company on lonely, moonless nights. The poor girl has had little luck with humans, so she doesn’t use them as inspiration. Instead, she imagines her companion rising from dilapidation within the encampment, born from the mud and the trash in the shape of something large and powerful like a bear, but with the face of a fox and a single human eye.*
2. *Annie also imagines her parents meeting a violent and bitter end.*

\- - - - -

*Early one rainy morning within her makeshift tent, she wakes up to find a strange man bent over her, watching as she sleeps. He’s nearly seven feet tall and is wearing a peculiar black robe. It’s matte and billowing, almost clergy-like in appearance. At the same time, the vestment looks tightly stitched to his skin. Inseparable, like a diving suit or a body-wide tattoo.*

*She isn’t sure he’s real, given her recurrent hallucinations. Nor does she feel scared when he leans closer to her, even though her rational mind realizes she should be.*

*The man gently lifts her hand up and traces a symbol on her left palm using a ballpoint pen. Annie believes it to be a pen, at least, but then the strange man uses the same small, cylindrical instrument to draw another symbol on the ground, which doesn’t make a whole lot of sense given how gracefully it glides over the hard dirt.*

*She watches the image appear as he diligently drags it along, mesmerized.*

*When’s he done, there’s an eye containing a series of corkscrews within the iris. It’s about the size of a manhole cover, and it’s next to where she sleeps, aside where she usually rests her head.*

*Annie then looks up from the ritualistic graffiti, into the man’s gaze. She finally experiences a lump of fear swelling at the bottom of her throat.*

*He’s staring at her again, but his eyes are different now. They’re identical to the symbol, but the corkscrews are moving, twirling and writhing like a legion of trapped worms. Not only that, but his eyes are much larger than before, taking up more than half his face. The proportions make him look more insect than man, and his eyes only balloon further the more he glares at her. Eventually, they meld together into a single, cyclopeon eye that swallows his entire head in the transformation, and he’s nearly on top of her.*

*She gasps, blinks, and he’s gone.*

*Annie wants to believe the strange man was a nightmare.*

*Unfortunately, though, the symbols he drew remain.*

\- - - - -

*The following night, Annie dreams of her ideal companion and her parents’ death, for what was likely the thousandth time.*

*She awakes to the mashing of flesh and the crunching of bone.*

*Annie turns her head and sees a hulking mass of churning earth next to her, its body rippling with familiar refuse - popsicle sticks, hypodermic needles, shards of glass - in the shape of bear. It looks to be sitting and facing away from her, exactly where the strange man drew the symbol.*

*There’s a tiny half-circle at the beast’s precipice, white and glistening, lines of fiery red capillaries pulsing under its surface. It is partially sunk within the dirt, but it’s different from the other debris drifting around its frame. It doesn’t rotate around the creature as its body churns, instead remaining static and in position at its apex.*

*The single human eye does spin, though.*

*Annie learns this because her companion doesn’t turn what appears to be its head to greet her.*

*The eye just twists, spinning until she can see the half-crescent of an iris peeking out from the wet soil, pointing directly at her, corkscrew worms writhing within it.*

*- - - - -*

*Without thinking, she ran. Annie sprinted in a single direction for miles, until her lungs burned like they’d been filled with hot coals, eventually passing out yards from a cop who promptly called her an ambulance.*

*Annie was seventeen when she was admitted to the hospital. The poor girl had been living on the street for four years, navigating the mood swings and the hallucinations without a shred of help, before she received her diagnosis of Wilson’s disease.*

*You see, since the moment Annie was born, her liver could not excrete copper. It may sound strange, but we all require small amounts of the metal for normal function and development. But if it can’t be removed from the body, it builds up. Not only in the liver, but in the blood, bones, eyes, and brain.*

*After doctors filtered the copper from Annie’s system, she began recovering.*

*As her brain improved, cleared of the dense metal that had been impeding her path to normalcy, she assumed the strange man was one of many, many hallucinations. Same as the eye with the corkscrews. Same as the beast birthed from the mire decorated with a single human eye. Until she learned of her parent’s demise, of course.*

*That forced her to accept that the beast was real.*

*Thankfully, most of their evisceration occurred halfway across the city from Annie’s encampment.*

*Even though the police found bits of bone and flecks of tissue near where she rested her head, there was nothing to link her to the site of the actual murder. Suspicious, sure, but nothing was damning. Therefore, the police cleared Annie of any involvement.*

*But her ordeal wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.*

*You see, it was only a matter of time before the beast tracked her down. It did not take its abandonment lightly, same as Annie hadn’t years before.*

*I would know, because I met Annie in the hospital.*

*And I led the beast right to her.*

So, I ask you.

Who killed Annie’s parents?

Who was truly responsible for their murder, Bryan?

I’m excited to hear your answer.

Like I said, forty-eight hours.
