I don’t know if I should even be posting this.

I shouldn’t be alive. He let me live, but I don’t think it was mercy. It was something worse. He wanted me to remember.

I don’t sleep anymore. Not because I don’t want to. Because I can’t.

And if you keep reading, neither will you.

The Night It Started

It was late. Too late.

I should’ve gone straight home after work, but I stopped for drinks with some coworkers. Just two beers. I was clear-headed, just tired. You know that kind of tired where your body feels heavier with every step? Like your brain is already shutting down before you even get in bed?

I was walking alone, cutting through the old district to get to my apartment faster. The air was cold, the streets dead quiet. Just me and the distant hum of streetlights buzzing.

And then—

Footsteps.

Not behind me. Not ahead. Not anywhere I could see. But I felt them.

Like an itch between my shoulder blades.

I turned. Nothing. Just empty pavement and flickering streetlights.

I kept walking.

A minute passed. Then another.

And then I heard it again.

Footsteps. Not steady, not normal. Unstable. Erratic.

Like someone stopping. Then sprinting. Then stopping again.

I whipped around so fast I nearly fell over. My breath caught in my throat.

At the edge of the nearest streetlight, just barely in the glow, stood a man.

No. Not a man. Something pretending to be one.

His clothes were worn out, torn in places—a jacket with a raccoon printed on the front. Dark jeans, combat boots that looked like they had seen miles of road. His hands hung loosely at his sides, twitching like he was trying to hold them still but failing.

But it was his eyes that froze me in place.

They were red. Bloodshot. Swollen like he hadn’t blinked in years.

And then—

He grinned.

"Why do you waste your dreams?"

His voice wasn’t normal. It wasn’t deep or raspy. It was dry, cracked, like someone whose throat had been ruined by years of screaming.

I didn’t answer. My feet had already started moving.

Fast. Faster.

I didn’t think. I just ran.

The wind roared in my ears, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. I didn’t look back. Didn’t want to. But I heard him.

Not running. Not chasing. Just moving.

Every time I blinked, he was closer.

I reached my apartment complex, fumbling my keys, hands shaking. When I slammed the door shut, my ears were ringing. My entire body was trembling.

I locked every bolt. Every chain. Checked the windows twice.

Finally, I dared to breathe.

I was safe.

At least, that’s what I told myself.

The Knock at My Window

I don’t know what time it was when I woke up. The apartment was dark. My phone battery had died.

And then I heard it.

A soft knock.

It came from my bedroom window.

I live on the fourth floor.

My body locked up. I told myself it was my imagination. Sleep paralysis. A bad dream.

Then the knocking came again.

Slow. Rhythmic.

And then—

The whisper.

"Why do you waste your dreams?"

I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. I just lay there, frozen, as the whispers continued.

"Sleeping so soundly. It must be nice."

My lungs burned. I wanted to scream. Wanted to run.

But the moment I blinked—

He was inside.

He Let Me Go. But Not Really.

I don’t know how I survived.

One moment, he was standing beside my bed, his knife hovering over my chest. The next, he was shaking. Twitching. Like something was wrong. Like he was glitching.

His hand clenched the knife. He started mumbling.

"Not yet. Not tonight."

He turned. Walked to the door. Vanished.

I don’t remember the next few hours. I think I blacked out.

When I woke up, my door was still locked. My window? Sealed shut.

But my closet was open.

And inside, on the floor, was a single piece of my bedsheet—cut clean off.

Like he had taken a piece of me with him.

Now, I Never Sleep.

I tried to go back to normal. Told myself it was just a nightmare. Just my brain playing tricks on me.

But then, the whispers started again.

In my phone calls. My radio. My own damn thoughts.

"Why do you waste your dreams?"

Every night, I see him. Not in my room. Not in my window.

But standing at the edge of the streetlights.

Waiting.

I haven’t slept in four days.

I know if I do—if I let my guard down—he’ll be there.

Not to kill me. Not yet.

Just to remind me.

That he’s still watching.

That he’s still waiting.

And that I will never sleep again
