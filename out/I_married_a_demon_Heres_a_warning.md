My father is a pastor of a small town. One of those forgotten towns nestled a few yards off the major highway by redwoods. Being the pastor’s daughter, my mother and I had to be as holy as him. My father will always say my first words were “Amen,” which made sense since the first school I went to was Sunday School and the first book I read was “Bible stories for God’s Children.”



This did not make me a good child. I proselytized all of my classmates away, due to their sinful 10 year old ways. The only time people talked to me outside of Church was when I was called upon for morning prayers. I ended up alone for most of my grade school years.



High school was worse. Adults always said that I was a “pretty young woman” but I could always tell that they were lying. While being socially isolated was bad, it was torture seeing all the other girls getting boyfriends, hickeys, and large friend groups. I didn’t try hard to be liked. I didn’t even try hard in any Bible activities. I was always just the Pastor’s daughter, quietly in the corner while with her frumpy Church dress, smiling with her thin lips with her blue Bible in hand.



I went to community college right after I graduated high school. I moved to a more urbanized town; double the size of my hometown, with double the junkies, and ended up in a pretty dingy studio apartment. I did subpar in college, I dropped out. I would like to say I tried but in reality I put in the same effort I did in high school, which is not a lot. 



I never told them I dropped out, I used the money my parents sent me to pay rent, and I made due working in a bar as a waitress. I tried to rationalize it in my mind, “Jesus drank wine with prostitutes, so it’s kinda the same,” but I don’t think Jesus vomited on your shoes and cried on your breasts.



I hated my life. I had a year left before my parents expected a degree and all that I’ve done was work for minimum wage. It was either live a life of dingy deceit or go back home a deceitful liar who wasted her parents’ money. I had nowhere to go.



And then a man walked through the door. He was sharper than any of the regulars of the bar. He had nice wavy hair, a great jawline, and was dressed in a casual suit with his shirt buttoned down to show his smooth chest. I know that this is a dunk on all the men I’ve ever seen, but he was the first man in all of my life to make my heart flutter.



He sat down in a booth and asked for a light beer. I served him and we just stared into each other's eyes. I had never seen eyes so black yet so alluring. He asked me to sit across from him and I did. Other men had asked me to sit next to them or on their lap but he was the first one to ask me to sit across. I felt respected. We introduced ourselves, or more accurately I introduced myself. I told him everything about me and answered every question, while I was so flustered I forgot to ask him anything. He finished his beer, just one beer, and then he left. It was true love. I was completely entrapped.



He continued to come back regularly, every night just a single light beer. We talked endlessly, we laughed and shared our sorrows. He said he was also a pastor’s kid and that he actually finished seminary but never got to be part of or start a Church. He was also lonely, he also felt ugly, it was as if he was an exact copy of me. We became close, it came to the point where my boss got angry that I was spending too much of my work hours on one customer so we decided to go to another bar after my shift.



At one point I shared his beer. I was nervous since I had never drank before, even when I was 22 at this point. But his presence and the cold liquid helped me swallow my nerves. 1 beer became 2, 2 became 5, next thing I knew I had to be driven home by him. The thing was he never pushed boundaries, we only kissed 6 months into our relationship. It was perfect, it was nice.



By the time my parents called we were a year into our relationship. They started asking if I had finished my degree yet. I told them the truth and they berated me. When my parents’ money stopped coming in, my boyfriend proposed. He said he will protect me and that he will support me forever. I said yes and we moved to Los Angeles.



When I first asked him what his job was he said he was in communications for a large company. I never questioned how he could afford a nice house, or why random people came in at night, or why he hid drugs in the wine cellar. “Clients give me stuff,” he said. A simple bullshit explanation to everything and I believed him. 



He shared them with me: alcohol, drugs, jewelry, clubs, restaurants. I accepted it all. He always said he would protect me and make sure I wouldn’t take too much. And then I started blacking out.



The night before would always be blurry. I would be partying; he would “drive me home;” I would be lying down in a dingy room, the desert, sometimes even a mansion; my bones and flesh would burn and something deep inside me would contort and grow cold like a muscle contusion; and I would wake up somewhere else with him next to me.

I would wake up with a throbbing headache, my entire body sore, in random places. 



The first time was in the living room of our house, my head on his lap, his hand combing my hair. Next was a hotel room, then an alleyway, a Waffle house, in the middle of the woods, even an entirely different state. But he was always there, with a calming smile on his face telling me that I had a bad night and that everything was okay. That he is here.



This would happen once every 2 weeks. Then it became 4 times a month, once a week, twice a week, then it almost felt like everyday.



Almost. The time between high and hungover became longer. From a full night it became a few days, it became a week, it became a month. And then he would bring me to a friend’s party, a business trip, an anniversary, and I would blackout again.



My whole life became a daze of constant drugs and booze and fun. I never knew where I was, when I was, what was in my mouth, in my glass. I sometimes forget my husband’s name, my name. When I worried about the scars, the open wounds, the bruises, the carvings, he would say that I fell. And I believed him.



I woke up in a hotel room. In a hungover state I wandered down the halls, at some point I went on a bus, and then I was lost. I sobered a little. The last thing I faintly remembered was that I was in a New York penthouse celebrating the new year 2000. I stood in fear of the Christmas decorations at the mall I stumbled upon, a banner saying “Christmas of 2001.” I wandered around frantically, I didn’t know where I was, where I was going. I was only stopped forcefully by a sudden stabbing pain. A stab thoroughly through my entire body. I curled over in hot boiling pain. My nerves were screaming, my flesh was burning, no deep frying with the blood flowing through them. I was screaming in response, a loud guttural scream, my teeth vibrating with the sound of my scream. I fell to the ground, my head up to the sky. A cross, a bright burning cross haloed by the sun was burning my eyes. Not burning, they were melting, boiling. I heard a person to my right asking something but I can’t understand. I rolled with my eyes closed, my hand’s hitting my head, the pavement. A public meltdown to ask for someone to make the pain stop. A sharp pain entered my abdomen causing my body to shake uncontrollably and I passed out.



The rest was a burning haze. I was in a jail cell, then a dirtier jail cell, a priest was in front of my bars, I was in a car, I was in a room, and they burned me. There was no fire but I kept getting burned over and over again. They were speaking words while my body was writhing in burning agony. Water burned and seeped into my flesh. The rest of the year was a sequence of waking, piercing burns, blackouts, words, burning, and sleeping in a wooden room, to wake up and start again. The pain started to lessen, from burns to contusions, from contusions to sores. At some point I regained my mental footing, and soon I was praying with the nuns rather than fighting them. 



There had been demons in me for years. Too many to count. The priest was crying tears of joy when he told me this.



“Thank God almighty,” he said. “We were able to save you and save the baby before it was too late.”



I had a child. I forgot that day on the streets I was pregnant. I forgot who the father is, there were too many. I forgot so many things.



That was the day I first held my child. And that was the first day I cried in grief rather than pain.



I’m 40 now. I could never recognize my own face and I could never remember what I looked like, just as I could never remember my “husband’s” name. I am now a devout Catholic, I do everything to keep me and my son safe from the demons in the world. My son is 10 now and everyday I worry of the day where something would come to get him. But I know that all I could do is teach him well.



The devil does not want to hurt you, he wants to control you, he wants to get you to question God and step backwards towards him. He may not appear as a man in a suit with black eyes, I don’t know which evil forms are his or our own creations. But be careful. Even if you don’t believe me, I pray you will be careful.
