Hello everyone. this is a message to you from.. somewhere. My name is ######## and I have just recently arrived in this place, and these are my final words before I go. this is my story.

It's been a few decades, but I finally got a house!  
When I arrived there, I was so happy since I was on the streets for years.  
When I was unpacking things, I needed to use the bathroom to relieve myself. when I went inside, I saw a piece of paper listing  
"Hello there! this is the original owner of this house! you must be wondering, "why is there a piece of paper in the bathroom"? well new owner because there are rules to this specific bathroom.  
Rule 1 - Do not use this bathroom at all times, use the other bathroom, I still don't know why the other bathroom isn't as cursed and possessed as this bathroom.  
Rule 2 - If you can't use the other bathroom because someone is using it and you're starting to get desperate, then you can use this bathroom.  
Rule 3 - The toilets and everything else is fine, you can go No.1 and No.2 in the bathroom. The real problem starts when you take a shower. Refer to the Sub rules  
Do NOT lock the door when you are in the shower, leave it open at ALL times (if you are using the shower, anything else like number 1 or 2, you can lock the door). but if you lock the door during your shower. you will be sent billions of years into the future. into a world long gone. long after the sun explodes. you will be sent into what the sun is now. a black hole.  
Do not shit in the showers, if you do, you will slowly and painfully turn into shit. trust me, I had to clean the remains of my son.  
DO NOT dance in the shower, from a little jig to break dancing, you will slip and you will be dragged into the drainage. I will say, the drainage is not even the size of your head. you will be crushed.  
Do not lean on the walls of the shower area, you will feel a slimy material, then it will burn and kill you from sheer acidity. putting your hand on the wall is fine.  
If you buy washing products (Ex - shampoo, conditioner, soap) remember the color of the product you bought. if you use something that is not the same like the color or size is wrong, you will be met with (soap - millions of extremely painful sandpaper. Shampoo - extremely strong acid. Conditioner - something will drag you in, crushing and pushing your body through the opening of the conditioner.)  
Do not bring sharp objects into the shower. If you do, you will misteriously slip at an unlucky angle, then the sharp object will fall toward where important parts of your body are. This rule can be negated, refer to the next sub rule of rule 3.  
Do not get a shower curtain that isn't transparent, if you do, you will not see what is lurking to get you. if you get a non transparent shower curtain, it will attack. if you get a un transparent shower curtain, the 6th sub rule will be negated and you will be allowed to bring sharp objects for protection, though the thing out to get you is far worse.  
Do not stare directly into the shower head, you will see something coming out of the shower head before it stabs you with its millions of arms for spikes, but then you will not die, it will then wrap around you, stab through you a couple more times, then it will compress so hard and so fast, that you will explode. You will only be alive 5 minutes after you explode.  
Dry yourself before getting out of the shower,. if you don't completely dry yourself, a water demon will drag you to the deepest darkest depths of the ocean. inside of the earth in no way connected to the outside world. you will get crushed due to the sheer amount of water pressure.  
Do not use any electronics while inside the shower, you will get shocked and not only will you get shocked, a ball of electricity will come out of the electronic you has, and it will electricule you till you expire.  
Do not jump in the showers, if you jump the floor will break and you will fall directly to the Underworld. The floor will then reconstruct when you reach the bottom for its next prey.  
Do not EVER punch the walls of the shower, you will unleash the slime monster. refer to the 4th sub rule of rule 3  
Do not wear socks into the shower, you will be beaten up by all the monsters in the bathroom, all countermeasures will not work anymore, even the slime monster from behind the wall will join in, after that, they will pulverize you and leave you alive if your lucky, but your legs will be removed. (this rule will be negated you are under 7)

Rule 4 - these rules are for getting out of the shower, Read the Sub rules if you want to get out of the shower without harm   
If you see anyone enter into the bathroom while you are about to exit, it is not who you think, you can exit when it exits. But do not worry, if you get out before it does, it will only claw all your organs out with surgical precision, then the owner of this house will sell them.  
Do not stay for more than 10 hours, if you somehow surpass that limit like sleeping while you are still in the shower, you will age till you 1000 in 1 minute.  
Rule 5 - do not follow any rules that have a stupid ending like “it is a fate worse then death” or “ well, you dont wanna know”. If a rule does have that, then the corisponding monster or consequence is not that strong or bad.  
>!the rest of the note seems ripped up witha seperate note attached to it.!<  
other than that, good luck! it may seem that this note is ripped, but you can find the rest of the note throughout the house! the creature that ripped it was lazy.  
when I looked away, I already pissed my pants while reading it.  
“Well shit”

A few years has gone by and I have gotten a wife and son who's name I will not say. 

I have found other pieces of the note like "Do NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES close the light while you are in the shower. if you do, you will be dragged to a omni verse long forgotten and gone and you will be trapped there for eternity with no death at the end." I have only used the second bathroom since that was not possessed by what ever demon or demons has infected it. I don't even know if it is possessed or if #########, the previous owner is trying to play a prank. 

when I woke up one day, I saw on my watch that I was about to be late for work and I went to the bathroom. I was scared to see that my wife was I there and she said she won't be out for another 15 minutes. I was scared shitless when I realized that I had to go to the first bathroom. I was desperate and needed to go to work. so I hopped into the shower and stopped the door from closing with some slippers that was inside.

When I was inside of the shower I felt a feeling of things watching me, but then I remember to not stare into the shower head and I started to wash myself. I follow to keep watch of my things in the shower and dont slip. but alas, I slipped up. I saw my soap fall to the ground but when I went to grab it, I stepped on the soap slipping and I landed on the floor with a thud. the 10th sub rule of the 3rd rule came into play. 

>!"Do not jump in the showers, if you jump, the floor will break and you will fall directly to the Underworld. The floor will then reconstruct when you reach the bottom for its next prey."!<

When i landed, I was met with a  oppresizely silent pool room filled with water and pool tiles. I also saw many many showers that were on and valves pouring water. it was there i found the other half of the ripped note, and from there, i didnt know what to do! I was scared, sad, freaking the fuck out, and i even pissed my pants in fear. I didnt know what to DO!? so i just kept still and started to read the rest of the rules.
