This is a separate perspective and not to be mistaken as Part 7 of Travis's posts. 

&#x200B;

I watched as me and Travis went our separate ways, I wanted him to come with me instead of risking himself for a bunch of....What did he call them again? Solder's? No, Soldiers. He wanted to warn the others to retreat despite how cruel they had treated us. I was amazed at how forgiving my best friend was, but sometimes, kindness will get you hurt...or worse.

I was able to find Bryson's Scent while traveling, heading near a river, I quickly hydrated myself and closed my eyes, focusing on my sense of smell, I went toward the direction of where Bryson was...

And fell right into the river, Drifting off in an uncontrolled motion. I winced as I rammed into many rocks and had bruises lined across my arms and legs. I used my claws and latched onto a branch, Freeing myself from the river's grasp.

Disoriented, I quickly realized that I was in a totally new area of Yellowstone National Park and I immediately tried finding Bryson's scent. No luck.

I continued walking, going on all four's for more speed, searching for my friend without my sense of smell, hoping that I could run into him if I covered distance quicker.

The woods slowly blocked off more and more of the sunlight above. This was no problem for me but it would be hard for anyone else without night vision to navigate this place. I found a small clearing surrounded by twisting trees when I heard a ruffling noise from behind and quickly dashed around to see a small black cryptid. It had large bat-like ears and sharp teeth with small stubby wings.

It flew close and landed on a branch, almost losing balance and falling.

"Who are you". I asked, trying to sound as menacing as possible.

It looked at me confused and then spoke.

"I haven't seen anything like you around here before, are you visiting"? It asked.

"No, I am looking for my friend". I stated.

"Well, that's too bad, My family is really....Hungry". He said and then laughed as he darted back into the darkness.

Suddenly, dozens of large and smaller Cryptids of the same attire rushed out the darkness, swarming me. I was barraged with many bites and disoriented quickly. I was able to grab a branch and swing it, sending a couple of them flying back into the trees nearby, indenting them into the wood, permanently.

They continued to bite and swarm me as blood was trickling from my wounds. I maneuvered myself to the ground and smashed my claws into the ground, then thrusting it upward, temporarily subduing the flying creatures. 

I used this advantage to quickly grab the tree trunk and hoist it out of the ground with tremendous struggle. I used the tree trunk as a bat and whacked most of the swarm of cryptids into the ground and crushed them with the tree. I was able to deal with the remaining few easily as there were only about half a dozen left.

I looked at my wounds and thought I was ok, many scratches and bruises but I felt ok. I continued into the forest and reached a clearing. 

Picking up a familiar scent, I looked at the 3 decimated soldiers. Travis was here. I immediately looked around but he was not nearby. I ate the 3 soldiers and decided to take a rest. 

I grabbed a phone that was on the ground, half buried in dirt and remembered about what Travis had told me earlier. I decided to not mess with the phone as I heard something in the bushes to my left.

I turned to see a dark figure dragging a body that resembled Kyle. I didn't make a sound as the figure left the vicinity. I waited several minutes before breathing again.

Suddenly I felt the pain kick in, the bruises and bites did a number on me and I was feeling the results.

I was barely able to move the phone out of the way as I crashed into the ground, immediately feeling sleep overcome me...

&#x200B;

I woke up to see that most of my wounds were healed but I was still sore from yesterday. I gathered myself and left the area, not wanting to attract attention to myself even more with the puddle of blood that I had created beneath where I rested.

As I walked through the woods I thought of the previous events that had unfolded.

Travis seemed pretty upset about Bryson and I did owe him my thanks for saving me in that...wretched place, but now it seemed he was done with helping and wanted out. I thought of Travis and hoped he was ok.

Walking for what seemed like hours, I followed Bryson's Scent To a large watchtower in the distance. It was pretty run down looking as I carefully made my way up the large staircase. 

I found myself in a small room that had a bunch of things a Forest Ranger would probably use. I saw a closet in the corner of the room, revealing yours truly, Bryson.

He looked wide eyed and anxious as if he had just seen a ghost. He stared at me and his fear turned into somewhat annoyance.

"Why did you come here, Darius". Bryson asked.

"I was told to look for you, Travis needs your help and-" He cut me off.

"No. I said NO. I already saw that... freak of nature dragging Kyle through the woods. I wanted to leave but those soldiers blocked the area and I'm stuck here with IT". He stated.

"Bryson, those soldiers won't let us leave. They will imprison us or kill us once the mission is done. Why don't you calm down so we can think of a way to deal with the pilgrim and escape with Travis"? I asked.

"I'm not risking my neck anymore Darius! I'm sick of being the guy who pulls out a gun and acts like everything is fine, Because it ISN'T. That THING won't be stopped by the 3 of us and i'd rather stay here  until the chaos is over so I can slip away unnoticed"! He ranted.

"**CAN YOU LISTEN TO ME!! TRAVIS NEEDS OUR HELP AND YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED BECAUSE YOUR SCARED? HE'S NOT EVEN AN ADULT YET AND YOU THINK HE IS JUST GONNA DEAL WITH THE PILGRIM ON HIS OWN?! PUT ASIDE YOUR OWN PROBLEMS, BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER TO STOP THAT THING, IT WILL PICK US OFF, ONE. BY. ONE**.". I roared, seething with rage.

"Darius I...". He went to say something but trailed off.

"Now...let's go save our friend". I said, outstretching my paw for him to pick himself up.

He accepted my hand and I hugged him.

"I won't let that thing kill you, or Travis. I PROMISE. Ok"? I asked.

&#x200B;

He silently agreed as we walked down the stairs to get out of the Watch Tower.

I had completed my mission, and now it was time to find Travis.

We quickly prepared ourselves at the bottom of the Watch Tower and I decided to post this as a status update as well as some sort of communication to everyone. 

This is my first post. I will probably do a couple more before this phone runs out of battery.

P.S. Can anyone tell me how Travis is doing?
