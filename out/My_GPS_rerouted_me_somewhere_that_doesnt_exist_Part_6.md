Walking through that door didn’t make sense. One moment we stepped forward, and the next we were somewhere that wasn’t anywhere — just a sea of black, thick and endless. There was no sound, no up or down, just the faint sense of moving without moving. It felt like we had been walking for years, maybe longer, but at the same time… it couldn’t have been more than a second before we found ourselves in a room.

Immediately we were on edge, I mean could you blame us? The things we have seen… We need to get the hell out of here.
But as I looked around the room I couldn’t help but feel… safe? Well maybe safer is the correct term here

We were in a room. Just… a normal room. Beige walls. Drop ceiling. Fluorescent lights that didn’t flicker for once. There was a table with half drank coffees and strewn about bagels that seemed to be genuine, real food for once. The smell hit me and I almost cried. Veronica touched the table too, like she needed to make sure it wouldn’t disappear if she blinked.
“Hey Matteo, take a look at this.” Veronica called me over, and as I turned in her direction I saw it.

The wall she was looking at had a bunch of framed pictures on it, with the words “EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH” in big bold lettering above it.

Looking at the frames what took me by surprise was the perfectly legible text beneath every picture:

“Humans served: 500.” Underneath the first picture I looked with my eyes widening as I saw the more recent pictures, their misspelled months above their frames.

“Humans served: 1,000.”

“Humans served: “2,300.”

“Humans served: “5,000.”

All of these paled to the most recent picture, containing something I can’t even describe… just an absolute abomination. That sickly shiny skin, the twisted angles, those eyes… It was all too much. 

“Humans served: 10,000.” Next to the plaque there was a sticker of a golden star with “You’re a star!” In the middle. 

I laughed, not because it was funny but because of how absurd this place is. Some bizarre thing out there saw how humans transacted business and recreated it into this twisted monstrosity.

“Hey, I think I found our way out.” Veronica said before walking over and handing me a pamphlet. I could've sworn she was right next to me looking at this wall just a second ago, where did she get this?

“Where did this come from?” I ask immediately, looking over the pamphlet which says “Welcome Valued Employee!” On its covers.

“On the table over there.” Veronica replied plainly, but there was something about how she spoke that I couldn't place. Her demeanor and voice seemed different than it was just moments ago.

“Are you gonna read it?” She quipped, annoyed at me just holding it.

"Hello Valued Employee! 

Welcome to the one and only Abaddon Emporium, the one stop shop for customer supplies! Do you need a new skin suit? Or maybe you’d rather one of our beautiful faced boxes, full of transfigured life within them!

No matter what a customer might need it is YOUR responsibility to make sure that they get it, lest you want to become a part of the supplies we sell here! Now lets go through the basics before we release you:

1. YOU are our direct line to the customer, so remember to SMILE and SERVE! Your face will be what customers remember most of this experience, so make sure it’s good!

2. ALWAYS wear your uniforms! Yes the skin may be tight around you but what matters is that your uniform is on! Don’t want any of that fuzz escaping and leaving you deflated now would we?

3. Ignore any signs that are not written in plain English, as those are not there to guide you.

4. Absolutely NO humans are allowed to be roaming the facilities! We are a brand built on product quality, and letting humans get damaged DOES NOT MEAN QUALITY.

5. Any coworkers acting weird? Touch them! If you feel a heart beating then DING DING DING you found a human ready to be added to our inventory! Take great care in transporting them, they can put up quite the fight if they’re awake!

6. A lot of silly humans end up at the gas station, having taken a wrong turn somewhere along their path that puts them right into ours! They’ll come scooting along in their vehicles ready to be caught! It is your responsibility to NEVER let them reverse their vehicle; always keep it moving forwards. 

Here at the Abaddon Emporium we pride ourselves in our work, and we want to do the same! The better you perform the more perks you will get. Want a more powerful form? Or maybe you want to get some of our products for free? Well serve humans and you sure will be able to have that and more!

Questions? Head on over to our HR Department on floor 1324!

What. The. Fuck.
With my hands shaking I let the pamphlet fall onto the floor in front of me. I hadn’t even fully registered what I said before Veronica spoke up again.

“Why are you acting so scared? This is our way out!!” She exclaimed way more excitedly than she should, as if the implication of that pamphlet wasn’t horrifying.

Sensing my judgement and meeting my gaze she adjusted, “I’m just saying that this is the first time I’ve seen ANY mention on how this place operates. We can use the uniforms to blend in and get out of here!”

I could not help but frown at the idea of wearing skin over my own, which made me feel sick. 

“Okay so we blend in and get out of here. Then what?” I asked, hoping she was seeing something that I didn’t.

“No idea.” She said flatly. “But knowing that there is a chance we can get out of here is enough for me to try.”

She was right. As things stood now we would eventually be caught and reimprisoned, if not worse. While I was still trying to process what we’d just read, Veronica wandered off toward a small closet door by the vending machine, “Uniforms” written across it in plain white text. 

As Veronica pulled the door open a wave of cold air poured out. Inside, hung neatly like any other work uniforms, were rows of pale fleshy things. They had zippers running down their backs, and some of the faces stitched into them twitched when the light hit. Veronica just stared for a long time, then turned back to me with this expression I couldn’t read. “Guess we found our uniforms,” she said.

As she reached for one of the uniforms I swore the rest leaned toward her. I wanted to stop her, to tell her this was a crazy idea and we could come up with something else — something less risky, but the look in her eyes wasn’t fear anymore, it was acceptance.

And that terrified me more than anything else in this place.
