Staring at Howard I said: "Okay, I think I'll have that drink, anyway."

He handed me the drink he had made for me, and twelve years of sobriety were gone as I gestured for another drink. I shook my head after that.

"I don't believe in this sort of thing, Howard. The ghosts of an entire Reggae band you ripped off two years ago; they're coming for you because you stole their song? I wrote the music, Howard. You only wrote the lyrics."

"It's the same song, and they say I stole it."

"You mean that funky Carla song? We heard that one at Tykini Sundays, while we were in Kingston. You saying their whole band is dead and they blame you for stealing their song, for *The Little Mermaid*?" I could hear the alcohol talking already and I vowed to stop the conversation before I got to saying things faster than I could think.

"You made the music. You knew it was the same song, you did know. We just changed it a little bit." Howard said grimly. "They said they want it back."

"I don't believe in this Dickens mousecrap. No Rastafarian ghosts are after you. You just need some sleep. The stuff the doctors told you is making you lose it, Howard. Go home, get some rest."

When I heard the news, it was while I was talking to the director of *Aladdin*, the news was that Howard was dead. I thought about that last conversation, and it felt like we'd just spoke recently. I shuddered, worried that somehow, the ghosts of Snowglobe Voodoo would be coming for me next.

I thought back to that Calypso styled song we'd listened to live at Tykini Sundays, while we were on vacation. I missed him a lot, but I was sure it was his private life that had killed him, not his professional one. It just wasn't fair, to be haunted by the ghosts of the musicians we'd heard. They'd gone to the peak of their career when they played at Tykini Sundays, and we had merely immortalized them. Why should they be angry?

Charles Dickens made his ghosts seem wholesome and friendly. I assure anyone who thinks ghosts are harmless or that they are not real that you are living in blissful ignorance. Ghosts are horrible things, and they find their way in, they sit behind you in the dark, they stand over your bed while you sleep and they surprise you with illusions, making your friends seem terrible and your bad habits seem safe.

You could try to chase away a ghost with a bottle of alcohol, and find it goes down like water. So have another, and another. Go ahead, drown yourself. The ghosts are waiting for you, and when you become like them, they will tear you apart and eat you - like they are eating you alive - forever.

I ended up in an emergency room, just from trying to forget they were there. I had alcohol poisoning, somehow I'd lost my tolerance and I'd gotten very sick. On the threshold of their world, the one that rests in the silent bowers and the cold shadows of our own, I knew they were real.

And they were very pissed.

*The Little Mermaid* was a masterpiece of theft. None of it was original, not the artwork, not the music and certainly not the story. We endured all sorts of sabotage from disgruntled animators and spiteful restrictions from studio executives. When I created the music to go with Howard's revision of the song Carla, I made it almost exactly like what we'd heard. Alan took all the credit for the whole thing, looking up at me and saying it was the composition of a true master, not the work of an amateur like me. Howard didn't stick up for me, he was their golden boy and he needed it, he couldn't throw all that away just for me.

So, I watched *The Little Mermaid* late one night, when the theaters were closing the show, and I noticed my name wasn't even in the credits. It just listed the music by Howard and Alan, and I got no credit at all.

I was pretty angry about that, and when Disney fired me I really went on to torch some stuff. Not my finest moment. I remember how mad I was, and it wasn't even my music, not really.

No, for the real creators weren't given anything at all, not even the satisfaction of slashing the tires on Alan's Camaro. No, they got to Howard, killed him slowly. The doctors thought it was AIDs, that fashionable Californian disease that a man like Howard died of with pride back in the Nineties. To me, I knew Howard better, knew that he was a good man. It was my idea, my sin, and I was the one who stole the music. He'd written a whole new poem for it, his lyrics.

I was the one to blame, and they took him from me, made me suffer by watching him suffer. Then they somehow made it Alan's song, the rotten little creep was a two-bit hack of a composer, but he got all the credit and all the praise.

All I got was three years in jail and a life sentence to living in a trailer park outside Encino. I've lived there for what, twenty-something years now? I thought the ghosts were done with me, but I was wrong, they hadn't even started with me yet.

I wake up in a cold sweat, seeing their rotten faces, their staring sunken eyes. I smell their weedy breath and I hear their demonic laughter. They've done something to me, made me a prisoner in my own home. I've got noone, nobody believes me, nobody cares about me.

I live alone, in an empty world, and days go by without seeing another person, and nobody ever looks at me or speaks to me. I am already dead in a way, as though I don't matter, as if I don't exist.

They are coming for me, they sing to me now. They haunt me, they feed on me. I belong to them. I look out my window and it is always night time. They are out there, waiting for me to come outside.

Then it is the horror of their presence. I can feel them all around me. I can feel them watching me. They touch me, and it is cold. The worms of my grave are already eating me - eating me alive.

I was in the shower, and the water was cold, and there was a mist. I felt the maggots gnawing under my skin, I smelled the rot coming from my pores. When I looked into the mirror, I looked dead. I am numb, but the pain I feel is the torment of knowing they have me.

My doom is coming for me, blistering out of the pockets that ooze. I pull worms out of the dirt, and see it is my food, I am eating the dirt of my grave. I don't dare drink again, for they would use it to poison me.

I have no escape from them, the band is playing. They are singing Carla, I am singing Carla. I cannot get away, they are inside my home, all around me. They are in me.

I am so afraid, I am frightened of how this will end. This is just them arriving, checking on me, seeing how much longer I have, and it cannot be much longer. I know all the words to their song, maybe I can set things right, but it does no good.

If only I could apologize to them, to take it back. I appropriated their souls, took their special song away. I thought it was a stupid song, but I am stupid. I am sorry, but it does no good, I know they will not go away, they will stay now, and they will take me down, and eat me forever.

*"Carla, life isn't free,*

*And the good life isn't best,*

*Under my sheets is better than what they got over there,*

*The grass is always greener,*

*In someone else's bed,*

*You dream of my lovin',*

*But you think it would be a sin,*

*Just look at the street I live on,*

*And then look at where you're from,*

*You think you'd be slummin',*

*But I am what you want,*

*Under my sheets,*

*Under ja sheets,*

*Under my sheets,*

*Darling it's better,*

*When you feel wetter,*

*Take it from me,*

*Up in the house they play all-day,*

*While out here we slave away,*

*You're so devoted,*

*To a man who doesn't know you,*

*Under the sheets,*

*Under ja sheets,*

*At the bar we are all dancing,*

*And the ganja gets us high,*

*While the rich folk are unhappy,*

*With their pie in the sky,*

*But the worm on the hook,*

*Is a lucky trick,*

*When she can get away,*

*Under my sheets,*

*Under ja sheets,*

*She will play all-day,*

*Nobody wants you more,*

*My team lined up out the door,*

*Nobody can beat us to it,*

*Little bird won't sit,*

*She fly you to us,*

*And we make a ruckus,*

*Under the sheets,*

*Under ja sheets,*

*Under the sheets,*

*We got no worry,*

*Sister come and hurry,*

*Keep you warm,*

*Under my sheets,*

*Under the sheets,*

*Under ja sheets."*
