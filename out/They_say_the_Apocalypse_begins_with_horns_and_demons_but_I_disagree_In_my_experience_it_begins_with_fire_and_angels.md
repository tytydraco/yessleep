Currently, I'm writing this in an abandoned store, with my search group somewhere outside. I'm not sure if they've left me behind, or are still looking, but I'm not really sure they'll find me in time.

I'm currently bleeding. Got a metal rod stuck in my gut, and now I'm keeping the wound covered to avoid death by blood loss, but I'm still hoping to get this out for anybody to find.

Anyway, let me tell you the basic layout of what happened to me and the rest of the world.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

On February 14th, 2023, the world ended.

Now, it wasn't from war, or even America randomly deciding to nuke somebody. It was bigger, it was cosmic.

It started with Horns, not the horns of the apocalypse; they were different. They sounded royal, like the horns you'd hear to signify the arrival of royalty, and they echoed for miles.

It was so loud that even people in *space stations* could hear it.

And when the horns played, everything airborne was taken out of the sky in an instant. Planes, helicopters, even *animals*.

They'd stop working, planes and helicopters would suddenly lose power, and drop from the sky. They wouldn't even explode on impact; they'd just hit the ground.

Birds got the worst of it, though. They'd just freeze in the air, and drop to the ground; some would die in the process, while others would end up mangled.

With that first step, the world would be chosen for some kind of hellish iteration of the Judeo-Christian Apocalypse, but so much worse, because we got something worse than Demons.

The second stage, was the eight horsemen that raced across the land. We expected four, but there were eight of them. I recognized Death, Pestilence, War, and Famine. But the other four were new.

The other four identified themselves as: Destruction, Calamity, Extermination, and Delirium. And together, they rode across the land, spreading an unknowable plague of chaos and desolation everywhere they passed.

Despite our best attempts, the horsemen would not stop, and they continued this trek across the land. Even missiles and concentrated nuclear warheads in less populated areas weren't enough, so we were forced to admit defeat and just avoid these monsters.

We were soon met with a nightmare greater than the horsemen, that being the final stage.

We expected the ground to burst open, and for Lucifer to emerge with his army of demons. But we didn't get that; instead, we got something so much worse.

*Angels*.

The moment they parted the clouds and emerged, we knew it was over. We all did, even the blind, deaf, and dying knew it.

The angels were not beautiful, but they were obvious.

At first, we thought we'd been saved, until we actually *saw* the things that we'd once called Angels.

They were titanic, dwarfing any belief, and they were horrendous. They looked like the skinned bodies of the dead, with leathery wings and wide mouths, like staring into the famous painting by Edvard Munch, the Scream.

They descended upon the cities, torching everything, and chaos reigned over whatever remained. Every living thing either fled or died; nobody could battle these things. No matter what, we tried everything, and it did less than nothing.

The Angels weren't phased, even after a full nuclear bombardment, something so strong it would've wiped New York City off the map several times.

So, after the Angels finished annihilating society, they seemed to retreat, returning to the clouds and closing the Heavens up from us forever.

All that survival was scraps of humanity, of the animal kingdom, of the earth itself. The planet suffered, the skies were permanently tinted red, the oceans were flooded with blood, and the rain burned, like being hit by scalding water or diluted acid.

That wasn't it, after the Angels left, the Demons came. They weren't as dangerous or powerful, but were *vastly* more numerous. Millions of them, emerged from the flaming cracks that the Angels had opened in the ground, unleashing them from the flames of what must've been the Netherworld.

Demons aren't hellish imps, demonic souls, or even clouds of black smoke like you'd see in media. They're human, but they're faster, and act more like animals than people, and they have claws that can slice through flesh.

In fact, a Demon is the reason I'm currently bleeding out; fortunately, they're relatively easy to put down. A shot to the head or a few shots to the gut, and they drop, but they're almost impossible to hit, simply from how damn fast they are.

Shortly after the Demons came, the remaining humans began rebuilding civilizations. Many would fall in the beginning, but I was able to find one. Genesis. It was built in an old science museum, and the technology there was enough to help start building better defenses, so we'd have had a better chance.

Now, I'm starting to get a little tired, and getting pretty cold. I'm no doctor, but I'm fairly sure that means the end is getting pretty close.  
If anybody finds this, before I'm saved by my search party. Then I have one thing to say, the end of the world wasn't caused by humans, it was caused by the Angels.  
The Christians had it wrong. God isn't our savior, he's our destroyer.
