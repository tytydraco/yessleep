So let me start by saying that this is all as I remember it, the events of this happened when I was 12, and I am currently 28 so some details might lack coherency I’ll try to maintain some semblance of a timeline but I am just jotting events as I remember them. I’ll try to keep it as short as possible, this is only one event out of dozens but I felt like this is a good starting point, and if people are interested in more I can share some more.  
  
My family is weird, boarding school is a generational thing. My parents, grandparents, and older siblings all attended the same boarding school. But when I was coming up to the point where I too could attend the same boarding school, they declared that they would have their final intake a year before I could attend. The boarding school in question was 14-18 whereas most boarding schools in my country are 11-18 so when they made the decision I was 12 and to make sure I didn’t miss out on the same  joyful experience as my family members my parents decided to send me to another boarding school.  
  
The boarding school my family all intended was about 8 hours from my family home, but the new one was only an hour so if I wanted to I could go home on weekends and public holidays which was extremely appealing to me so I agreed to check out this new school. The hope was, given I am the 9th child of 11 that I would be the first to test this new school and my siblings would follow.  
  
This new boarding school was a lot older, with a lot of old buildings that predated the 20th century, and was predominantly for farmers kids. I am the son of a Fisherman and am of a mixed heritage so surprisingly enough I was discriminated against not only for my family's occupation but also for the fact I was not white. But besides the bullying, this wasn’t even the closest thing that truly sucked about this boarding school.  
  
Given the age of the school, it started as more of a place to send troubled boys. There are old photos of the students dressed in clothes similar to the stereotypical olden-day prison fatigues and there were horror stories of mistreatment and escape attempts that coincide with the “campfire” stories that teenage boys would use to scare each other.  
  
The craziest fact was that there was very real proof of some of these stories.  
  
My first year in the school we heard a lot about the tunnel system that went underneath all the dorms, back before alarm systems, the school invested heavily in making sure that the boys stayed in by barred windows and stuff like that. So the boys would open up the floor boards and dig tunnels to be able to sneak out. Whether to go visit girls, go to parties whatever it was they wanted to do after curfew. These were more popular with the older boys, but what the older boys did the younger boys would copy.  
  
So for decades, it was almost tradition for the first years to dig tunnels for no other reason than to dig tunnels. They were rumored to span the entirety of the dorm complex which was easily half a mile in length with several living quarters, common rooms and houses for staff.  
  
By the time I attended in the late 2000s the school had invested a lot into discovering the entry points to the tunnels and sealing them off. My first exposure to the reality of the tunnels was when they brought in an excavator to do some work on an old tennis court and the weight of it caused tunnels underneath the tennis court to give way and it fell through. If that doesn’t explain the pure multitude of tunnels I’m not sure what will.  
  
During one of the public holidays, I decided to stay behind since my older Sister was about to give birth to her first son home was a bit chaotic so a quiet time in the dorms didn’t sound that bad. During public holidays the dorms virtually shrunk down to only those who lived to far to bother with the journey or were international students. I can’t remember exactly but I’m pretty sure there were only 3 of us who stayed in a dorm that usually housed 50+ boys. This was the first time we were free to just explore the dorm as a whole, and it would be my first time I ever went into the tunnels myself.  
  
The dorms were kind of military in their presentation with a few more luxuries then what the movies showed. Each cubicle was divided by partitions and in each cubicle there were four beds on either side of the hallway. There was no partition between you and the cubicle across from you so essentially it was like half an 8 man bedroom. Each bunk was given two lockers at the foot of them and 4 draws under the bottom bunk. I had been told by an older boy that the most common entrances to the tunnels were underneath draws, if I pulled out the draw and there was no carpet all I needed to do was use a fork or knife to pry up a corner and it should lead into an entrance.  
  
Me and my two friends decided to take this opportunity to take out every set of draws in the entire dorm until we found an entrance. The clue about there being no carpet seemed to be a red herring, a lot of them did not have carpet underneath but after a lot of false alarms we finally found one that had a small break in the wood. We pried it open and found the entrance to a tunnel.   
  
I’m a big boy, at 12 I was 5 ft 5, 140 pounds, the entrance to the tunnel was more suitable for normal sized 12 year old which I was disappointed by. So one of my friends who was more likely to fit took the lead and dived into the tunnel. We communicated through the opening for a while as he climbed in, he eventually called back and said after about a meter it opened up and he felt like I could fit. We made a plan to steal some spoons the next day and open it up a bit more, but for the time being we encouraged him to go further.   
  
After about 15 minutes he came back up, with a gallon bottle of what we assumed to be cider. He found it in a small pantry like dug out about 30 metres in. I checked the bottom of the bottle acting like I knew what sediment was because I heard my Dad mention it about wine once and found 1979 on the bottom of it. Not sure why I’m fixating on this bottle, was a cool find as 12 year olds but apart from the date of the bottle there was nothing significant about it.   
  
Next day we returned to the tunnel with our spoons and got to digging up the opening a bit more, took about 4 hours for us to open it up enough to where I was happy that I wouldn’t get stuck and down we went. The tunnels themselves were not the best, they definitely were there and they were definitely long. Armed with nothing but 4 candle sticks we bought with our pocket money we ventured deeper into the tunnels. They were about half a meter in diameter so we weren’t really capable of standing, but they were comfortable enough to crawl in.   
  
We got to the pantry dug out where he found the cider in, there were old glass jugs and other things showing the remnants of some cider making operation with old sugar bags and some glassware which was probably stolen from a school science lab. But that was the most prominent point for the next few dozen meters. After a few minutes of crawling and half of one of our cheap candles we cam to a point where it forked. One point kept heading further in the direction of the other dorms, while one veered back in the direction of our dorm, we thought it might be a clue to another entrance so we followed it for a minute before we hit a point that was filled with concrete. We instantly assumed that this was an entrance they found and filled in so we went back the way we came and decided to head further into the tunnel.   
  
The first open room was probably a ten minute crawl, and from memory was about 4 meters wide and had some old wooden school chairs with the legs snapped off placed around a small plywood table. The table had an ashtray with cigarette butts in it and the room stunk of cigarette smoke. We would find out later that the boys a year a head of us would use this to smoke at night and it was deemed “the Smokers Hut” we sat there for a moment enjoying the discovery, Was actually the first time I ever smoked a cigarette and is quite a fond memory for me.   
  
But this was the first point where things started getting weird, we heard as clear as day the words “Quick, they’re coming” I’m not sure where the voice came from, but it definitely sounded like a boy my own age who was calling out to warn us of the teachers coming. So we scurried back through the tunnel as fast as we could, expecting to come face to face with another student. My friend kept asking “Who’s coming” in a yelled whisper. We would end up at the end of the tunnel to find the dorm still empty and the owner of the voice still not present.  
  
Perhaps it was one of the older boys who smelt the smoke or heard our 12 year old lungs coughing in the hole. Who knows, but the fact remained we were confused as heck. We closed off the tunnel and decided to call it a day.  
  
That night while I was asleep, I woke up feeling like I was sleeping in a fridge. Where I was could get pretty cold in the winter, but I distinctly remember being able to see my own breath in the darkness. That's how cold it was. So I got up, took my sleeping bag out of my locker and looked directly down the hall where I saw a shadow. I thought nothing of it, I knew it was a shadow because on the wall behind it I could still see the fire emergency sign. My tired brain was just like “Oh someone must be standing on the other side of the hall.” given the toilets were just down from where I saw the shadow they must have been needing to go to the toilet. So I went back to bed with my sleeping bag and went back to sleep.  
  
The next day out of curiosity I was talking to one of the dorm managers about the tunnels. He had attended the school in the 70s which was their glory days so he knew a lot about them. He warned us to never go in the tunnels because when he was our age, a few boys were digging underneath our dorm and one of them unknowingly dug into a powerline and died. He said that was when the school decided to take the initiative and begin filling in all the entrances, and they even encased any livewires in pipes before filling in entrances with concrete to avoid any curious boys meeting the same fate. Whether that boy was the one who had warned us or had been the shadow I had seen that night I’ll never truly know, but there was one thing that was for certain, the tunnel blocked off by concrete was most definitely the place he met his end.
