Hey mortals. Guess what, it's me again. Yep, I'm still alive. I know that probably nobody here remembers me. I've been gone for two entire years after all. And if some of you do still remember me, please let me know! I’d love to get back in touch! 

I also want to apologize that I disappeared from here without a trace. I know that I may have worried some of you. It's just that things were getting crazier by the day and I didn't have the energy to write down everything that was going down. 

Anyway, I'm here to continue sharing my story with you mortals, and not to bramble about me disappearing so without further ado.

In school I told Claire about that woman, 'Bella', if you can believe it. I've never seen Claire look so serious before. It almost felt like she was taking this more serious than I did. We didn't make plans for any counter measurements though. For now, we just wanted to keep a low profile and see what Bella's next moves would be. I mean, the one thing we had to avoid at all costs was to let her know that we were onto her. So, playing dumb and nice was the only option. 

During lunch break we decided to let Colin in on it all, and he was equally as shocked as Claire when I told her earlier and he agreed that playing dumb would be the best move at the moment. Though he also suggested something else. 

"You know, Phoebe… Why don't you try to give this Bella a false sense of security?" I was intrigued, I admit. And Claire seemed to be too. I asked him to elaborate. 

"Well… what if you do… more vampire things in front of Bella?" I really couldn't tell if he was serious or not. I asked him what exactly he meant, of course. 

"I mean, when you do vampire things in front of her… she might think that you're oblivious to her schemes, right?" He did have a point I thought.

"And the most vampire-like thing you could do in front of her would be… well, drinking blood." I let out a sigh. He was right. I hated that he was right. It probably would've been the most vampire-like thing to do in front of her. But I wasn't happy with that idea. Drinking blood always gave me an uneasy feeling. During my time in the orphanage they forced me to drink from their cows, against my will. They were so scared of me going into a frenzy that they didn't believe that I don't need to drink blood to stay healthy. I don't remember drinking without crying even a single time. The cows never seemed to care that much after they got used to it, but I always did. And after the caretakers were gone, I'd spend hours with the cows, apologizing. I knew they couldn't understand me, but I felt like if I didn't apologize to them my guilt would eventually consume me. 

Don't get me wrong, blood is super tasty and all but it just feels weird. I can't possibly enjoy drinking it knowing someone or something had to have been hurt for it. Even if it's willingly donated by people. Call me a coward or whatever, I don't mind. 

The mayor of my new home town personally assisted Jenny and Aaron with the adoption procedures and all, and before I officially moved in, during a meeting with him, he insisted upon regularly providing me with donated blood. I mean, I appreciated the gesture and all, but I made it clear that I didn't want or need it. I haven't touched any of those donated blood bags, and they were already starting to pile up in the fridge. It's a crappy feeling, I can tell you that much. 

Claire and Collin obviously didn't know about any of this, and I wasn't in the mood to tell them either. 
After a few moments I just told them that drinking blood in front of Bella would work, and then we finally changed the topic. 

That day it was unusually quiet in school. Kyle was nowhere to be seen, and my biology teacher, Ms. Quinn, who had a more than obvious dislike towards me because of my, well, herritage, didn't give me any bad comments or nasty looks today. Looking back at it, that day was probably a bit too quiet. I'm glad I didn't think the same back then, otherwise I might've jinxed something bad to happen, knowing my own luck. I made plans for the upcoming day with Claire and Collin and then I went home, careful to avoid any alleys on the way. At home, I was already being awaited by Jenny and…

"Bella".

Without thinking I went straight upstairs into my room and messaged Claire about it. We went through our plan regarding Bella again, and after mentally preparing myself I left my room, went downstairs and stepped into the kitchen. I went straight for the fridge, grabbed a blood bag and, well… used one of the tubes like a straw. The moment I tasted it I felt this uncomfortable feeling that I knew all too well wash over me. It was Jenny's surprised sounding voice I heard first. 

"So you do like blood after all, huh? I was getting a little worried." Gotta say, I didn't expect such a positive and relaxed reaction at all. 

"Oh you know, moving in and adjusting to my new life was pretty stressy, so I didn't have the appetite. Mhm, this is really good!" I tried my hardest to brush it off and keep up the act, and it seemed to work. Jenny chuckled nervously, but Bella? Her face didn't show any kind of emotion, but her eyes betrayed her. I could see in her eyes how bad she wanted to do whatever to me. I was sure the only thing that protected me in that moment was Jenny being there, too. I then quickly went back upstairs and returned to my room. I couldn't keep up with the act much longer. 

I wanted to get rid of the blood in the toilet at first, but I repeatedly told myself that someone willingly donated this blood and it would be a waste if I just poured it all into the toilet. So I basically forced myself to drink it all. It was tough at first, but it became easier by the end. It’d been a while since I last had human blood and I almost forgot its delicious taste, as much as I didn't like to admit it. Plus, Claire begged me to send her a selfie with a blood smeared mouth earlier, so I did just that. No need to mention that it didn't even take half a minute until I got spammed with messages about how cool I apparently was. I didn't do much for the rest of the day but I wouldn't catch a break the next day. 

At the end of politics class Ms. Jones asked me if I could have a talk with her. I still had time before meeting Claire and Collin so there wasn't a problem. Ms. Jones told me to grab a chair so I could sit down. 

"How are you doing, Phoebe?"

"I'm pretty okay, I think! Is something wrong?" She looked deep into my eyes, and I could see she was worried. Something was definitely bothering her. 

"Oh, just wondering…" She sighed. "I need to tell you something." I didn't like the sound of that at all. Ms. Jones took a deep breath and finally continued. 

"Kyle has gone missing."

"Missing?" I wasn't sure what she meant with that at first. A loud, obnoxious attention seeker like him couldn't just disappear like that, right? Apparently he hasn't been to school the last three days, and when his parents called the principal, it was clear something wasn't right. The police have already been alerted and the search for him would start later that day. If he has already been missing for three days then it was more than just unlikely that he ran away to gain attention. So, it most likely was a serious matter. "Why are you telling me that?"

"You know how hard it was to get them to agree to let you go to this school, right? To persuade them I said I would take full responsibility for everything you do on our campus. That's why, even though I really don't like to, I have to ask you if you have something to do with Kyle's disappearance…"

Ouch. That cut real deep. But I guess it only made sense. Only natural to suspect the only vampire in town of being the cause of a sudden disappearance. And this shortly after I moved in. What a coincidence, am I right? Just my luck. 

"What? No, of course not! Sure, he's a total jerk but I wouldn't kidnap him or anything!" I was getting nervous, a little panicky even. Even though I technically didn't give any evidence to prove my innocence, just hearing me denying it already seemed to relieve Ms. Jones. 

"Good… good. I didn't think you'd be responsible anyway… I just don't want anyone to attack you based on biased suspicions." I knew she only wanted the best for me but deep down I could feel a fear within her. She was scared I might actually do something like this. Scared that she might have been mistaken about me or fallen for a facade. After all, there was no definitive guarantee that I wouldn't. It wasn't physically impossible for me to have attacked him so the possibility was there. And in the eyes of some afraid of my kind, that slight possibility was enough to sow suspicion. I didn't blame Ms. Jones. It hurt, but I understood why she may have felt like that. Especially when you think about how many people have not so peaceful encounters with my kind. Even today. 

"Please, can I help somehow regarding Kyle?" I don't know why, I just felt the urge to help, even if Kyle was a total douche. Looking back on it, maybe it was a desperate attempt to prove that there is more to us vampires than what the stories tell. I don't fully remember, it's been a while already. 

"I don't know if that's such a good idea. Just… keep your eyes and ears open and tell me if you happen to see anything suspicious.

"Okay, will do, Ms. Jones."

I could see a tear forming in her eye. When you're a passionate teacher and one of your students goes missing… that must be almost as horrible as when your own child goes missing. I could tell that she was genuinely worried about Kyle, even if he was a jerk. He was still a person. And it's not like he had committed any crimes. His behavior was probably the result of some issues he had kept to himself or something. That's just my theory today though. 

"Thank you, Phoebe. You're a blessing, really… Ah, you can go now! I'll see you tomorrow." She brushed away her tears, and I said my goodbye. Despite not being acquainted for that long I really hated seeing her like that. She's shown me nothing but kindness and without her support I wouldn't even have the chance to be here as a part of human society. 

My mind drifted towards Claire and Collin, and what kinds of things we were gonna do that day. I was so lost in thought already, I didn't even notice the sound of something small falling to the ground. 

"Oh, Phoebe, you dropped somethi-... Phoebe…? Why do you have that?" 

Ms. Jones' voice brought me back, and I turned to see what I'd apparently dropped. Shit. It was the pin with the sun sigil. "Why do I even have it on me? I'm such an idiot!" is what I thought at that moment. What if I lost it somewhere without noticing? That’d be my only clue about my stalker. Gonna have to find a safe place to keep it, I thought. 

"Phoebe, why do you have that?!" She was so serious all of a sudden, it made a chill go down my spine. At first I wasn't sure whether I should tell her about Bella but to be honest, I whole-heartedly trusted her. So I decided to tell her about Bella. How she broke into my room and dropped the sun sigil pin on her way out. How she stalked me. How she tried to blend in to be near me. To observe me. To wait for the perfect opportunity to strike. 

"Phoebe, don't you know what danger you're in?!" Danger? So she knew something about all this. But I really did not like the sound of it. 

"This woman who's after you, she's probably a Descendant of Sol!"

"Descendant of Sol?"

"The Descendants of Sol were a group of ruthless vampire hunters, Phoebe! This pin you have depicts the symbol of their organization. Do you know what that means?!" Honestly, I should've seen it coming. Bella was a huntress. And the alley guy probably too. Maybe the two were even allies, or colleagues. It all made sense.

"Eight years ago, a group of vampires settled here in town, and unfortunately they weren't like you, meaning they just went around biting people when they felt like it. It didn't take long until the Descendants of Sol caught wind of this of course, and they started their own little war against the vampires. Normally you'd think protecting the human citizens would be their motivation, their noble cause. Well, that's how they portrayed themselves, and we all believed it. We thought they were our heroes. But no, they didn't do it to protect us, they did it to satisfy their need to kill vampires. Like some kind of sick obsession. They went too far with many of their attacks. At the end of it, they managed to kill all the vampires, however through their actions a total number of 37 citizens lost their lives. Most people weren't happy of course, and the police tried to apprehend them but they managed to escape somehow. I always thought that they simply continued their hunt someplace else. But they seem to be back… or perhaps they've never been away in the first place. And now they're after you."

I was speechless. These people, who'd even go as far as to lead innocent citizens to their death if it means they manage to kill some vampires… were after me? What was I even gonna do about that? Realistically speaking, I mean. 

"Phoebe, this is serious! You need to be careful! And please, I know Claire, Collin and you probably want to investigate but this isn't a game! Don't do anything to provoke this Bella even more, you hear me? It could be over in a flash."

I had to agree with her there. Sure, I may be immortal and have a few supernatural tricks up my sleeves but I didn't have any self-defense training or experience at all. So what could I possibly achieve in the case I confronted them? 

"Alright, I'll be careful, Ms. Jones…"

"I'll inform Mr. Giddings and see what I can do to keep you safe! Can't believe they're back…"

After learning about all this I wasn't in the mood to hang out in town with Claire and Collin at all. I wrote Claire a short message and then I went home. Surprisingly there was a lot going that day, the streets were kinda crowded. I was still in some kind of shock, so I tried to get my mind off of those Descendants of Sol. Just like in my first week, I tried watching the people doing their daily jobs, and to my surprise it actually helped a little. I decided to sit down at a nearby café, ignoring the looks, and maybe get a milkshake or something. Vanilla's my favourite flavor. If you want, tell me yours in the comments.

I was just kinda sitting there in front of the café, drifting off into deep thoughts again. Admittedly, knowing I was likely being hunted by those cruel people did scare me, deep down. And then it hit me. Why, in Nosferatu's name, was I sitting here in public for everyone to see? I was being targeted by trained vampire hunters. Hunters that didn't care at all about the costs of killing me. They’d blow the entire plaza up, taking all those innocent people down, just as long it would kill me too. 

As soon as I realized that I felt really stupid for just sitting right out in the open, I dropped my milkshake and headed home. I tried to walk as fast as possible while avoiding looking suspicious. I knew any of the random people I walked by could've potentially been one of them, looking for an opportunity to murder me. 

As I arrived at home, I practically ripped the door open and hurried into the kitchen. "Jenny! Jenny, I have to tell you some-...thing."

My eyes met Bella's eyes. She was here again, "visiting". From the way her expression changed from a relaxed smile to an intense frown as her eyes almost drilled into me, I could tell that she started to suspecting I was onto her at that very moment. For just a moment Bella and I were staring each other down. And when Jenny finally spoke up, my fight or flight instincts kicked in and I ran upstairs, locking my door behind me. So much about the plan to play dumb, right? Way to go me. 

I waited for half an hour, an entire hour, one and a half hours until she seemed to finally be gone for now. Though I didn't dare to leave my room yet, just to be sure. I tried distracting myself by watching some anime, and it kind of worked. The next time I looked outside my window it was already getting dark. I decided to do something I haven't done in a while. Take a relaxed stroll through the town but, y'know, as a bat. I noticed there were lots of wild bats in the area, so as long as I acted just like them I was able to blend in perfectly. Turns out, my decision was exactly right. The air was cool, and due to the sun disappearing I didn't need to worry about my sunscreen wearing off. It was just what I needed to relax and calm down. I decided to hang from a branch of one of the trees in the local park and enjoy a moment of peace and quiet in between those stressy situations. 

It didn't last long however, as I woke up from my half slumber when I heard two voices beneath me. I wouldn't have payed any attention to them but I recognized one of them. It was Bella. Of course, who else? I cursed my own luck. She was meeting with another woman. 

"Owl, you're late." Her voice was as cold as ever. 

"S-sorry, Artilina… there was a roadblock and-"

"How many times do I have to tell you that you're not supposed to call me that?"

"Ah! Sorry…Artimana."

"This is a serious matter! All of us are serious about this, especially Enigma."

"Yes, I know… sorry. So, uh… what did you need me for?"

"The target has likely noticed we're after her."

"Wh-what?! Did you screw up?!"

"You could call it *that*... or you could say that the target is smarter than we initially thought."

"Oh no…! But she's still such a young one! If what I found out is true, then she's only 124…"

I won't lie, this made me shiver. This person, who I've never seen or heard before in my life, knew my exact age. What else did they already know about me? How did they find out? And what if they find out even more?

"I did play it safe, like always. So either she knows something that we don't-"

The ringing phone of that other woman interrupted her. She spoke some words with whoever was on the other side of the line and then both of them left. I needed a few minutes to even understand what I had just heard. So apparently my stalker's name wasn't Bella, but Artimana? Or maybe she has multiple names? I've never heard of this name before, so maybe it has some kind of meaning? It must have, because the other two names "Owl" and "Enigma" aren't exactly common either. They sound more like code names or something. 

As soon as their voices disappeared in the distance I flew back home, deciding it was time to tell an old friend about my situation. 

I'll wrap it up here for now. A lot has happened in the past two years (wow, it's been that long?), and it took me a lot to work through it all. I just want you to know that I'm still here, still "alive" and kicking and I do intend on telling you, and the world about what I experienced. Even though it's all over now at the point of writing this, it's still haunting me like it happened yesterday. That's why I need to get it off my chest. 

I want to thank those who still remember me from back then and I also want to thank you for your support. I will try to update more regularly, now that I have the time. 

Have a good day and, as always, stay safe, mortals!
