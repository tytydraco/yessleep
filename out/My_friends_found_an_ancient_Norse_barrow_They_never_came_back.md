The jet-black, time-worn edifice jutted from the waters of the sea, dripping with seawater rolling off the eaves and pillars. The evening sun shimmered on the water, imbuing it with a warm hue of red and yellow that sharply contrasted the structure, an ancient, long-forgotten mound of rough, barnacle-encrusted and seaweed-littered tumulus made of stone.

"Look at it! How amazing!" Astrid, my friend exclaimed, pointing at the mound which had just recently and suddenly emerged out of the water as the sun fell below the horizon. Her blonde hair, braided to a single braid at the back of her neck, flew with the seaside breeze. She slightly turned around to look at us, offering a glance of her bright blue eyes.

"Do you know what this is?" Solveig asked me, rubbing her head. She pointed to that thing from the sea again.

"It's a barrow," I explained. I framed my fingers towards that structure, mimicking a camera. "It looks very old and has been submerged for a long time."

"This so crazy," Liv exclaimed. "One minute, we're chilling on this beach, enjoying the scenery at eventide. The next, some kind of ancient magically rises out of the sea like some big whale."

It happened all of a sudden.

We found a pristine, secluded beach in Norway. It wasn't anything spooky or unusual or cursed, like those cheesy horror flicks. It was just a scenic spot Astrid was familiar with and situated near her hometown.

It was a perfect place to bask and relax after those intense exams we did at our university. We were so burned out after having to study all-nighters in the days leading to our final examination. The quietness and natural surroundings of the place - the blue seas, the white sands, and the clear yet cool skies was a break with the stuffy, urban locales of the city.

All of us put on our swimsuits as we swam in the water, sunbathed under the cold sun, and even took a stroll across this place. We thought it could be the perfect time, an uneventful yet enjoyable time.

But then suddenly, the ground quaked with such force alongside a great frigid gale and the seas turning rough. It was so intense that we thought we're going to die and hugged each other fearing the worst to come. Thank the Lord an actual tsunami didn't happen. Instead, over the horizon, an ancient barrow emerged from the sea almost immediately, in front of very our eyes.

"Come on gals!" Astrid eagerly exclaimed, waving her hand as she trotted towards the water. "Let's explore it!"

"Are you out of your mind?" I chided. "That's an actual, honest-to-God future archeological site. We shouldn't delve until we can bring proof to the university or some organization. Then it'll be excavated and investigated properly."

"Ingrid," our foreign friend said. "Think of it as an opportunity to spice up our last day of vacation."

"I agree with her," Astrid said.

"You agree with her? Are you crazy?" I was outraged. I pointed at our friend with a condescending glance. "Last time, we got into trouble for drinking a lot and having to do community service for our university. You're seriously considering entering this place?"

"Why not?" Astrid said with a confident and proud smile. "I'm of an adventurous kind. A little thrill wouldn't hurt a bit. After all, we're sisters, though not in the blood related kind way. Let's go with our bikinis and all!"

Despite my reservations against her decision, considering the age and undiscovered nature of this barrow, I decided to follow her, if only to stop her and her friends from causing more damage or getting into trouble.

We waded through the sea on a raised causeway leading towards the barrow, shoulder-deep in it. Astrid and the others were chatting and giggling so fully, but I was really apprehensive and trepid about it. The oddly-smoothed black gravel and the matching black sand that composed this inexplicable causeway felt both weirdly silky and harsh on my soles. Not helping was the coldness of the water that splashed against my face and glasses.

As we got closer to the barrow, I suddenly felt cold and a foreboding presence pierced into the back of my head. Astrid paced up, climbing up the well-worn grey steps, stained black from muck, algae and damp. She helped pulled out Solveig, her long black hair stringy and dripping, complimenting her black bikini.

"Hurry up, sisters!" Astrid beckoned as Liv and I waded towards their direction.

"The water's getting cold," I said. "I think we should turn back."

Liv turned around and glanced at me. She briefly stopped to talk as she started adjusting her loose bun. "It's fine. That's the fun of swimming in this country," she replied. "Trust me, Astrid has swum in waters colder than this. She can last eleven minutes at the bottom of the coldest lake with only a bikini on."

I managed to reach the steps of the barrow. Emerging out of the water, my body quivered which I staggered trying to gain a foothold. I nearly slipped on a loose, small piece of masonry, but Astrid grabbed me luckily and pulled me up. Yet, my glasses, an old piece I've been using since I was a kid, slipped off my ears. In haste, I grabbed it instinctively and placed it back, hurriedly adjusting it.

"Haven't you got another pair lately?" Solveig teased.

"Yeah," Astrid replied. "This thing could've broken in any time if it fell off again. Maybe you should buy new pairs when we return to the city."

There was a loud gasp coming from behind. I turned around to see an exhausted Liv climb up the steps after emerging out of the water. She was smiling as if she was exhilarated, yet exhausted from wading cold water. She lightly adjusted the top of her light blue bikini with floral patterns as she looked around.

"Allow me to help," I said, approaching her with my hands ready to pick her up. I grabbed one of Liv's arms, extended with her hand outstretched, and pulled her out of the water. She briefly stood before stumbling and staggering, nearly landing on the rocky ground if it weren't for her timely pat on the ground with her hands.

The shoreline seemed very far away, almost two miles from shore, with the sands fading into the misty horizon. The waves just undulated as usual, shimmering with golden light in the evening. The seabirds' cries calmed down, softly segueing into the coastal ambiance.

"Is everyone here?" Astrid asked, boldly posing with her hand over her brow. Looking at her, I can't help but gaze at her beautiful yet athletic physique with fair skin that was accentuated by her red bikini with golden trims.

"Why you're looking at me like that?" she suddenly snapped at me. Immediately, I stopped doing that adoring look and adjusted my glasses to see Astrid, looking upset.

"Sorry," I said. "I just thought of the fjords I wanted to visit. It's been in my mind for a while."

"Ingrid, you really do want to go to the fjords," Liv giggled with a teasing face. "I think you and Astrid should go together."

"Hey, at least I'm not pining for it," I said back.

"Well, you're pretty even with the glasses on," Solveig said, mimicking someone adjusting her glasses as she leaned forwards to me.

"Thanks, I heard folks say that I would never get married like this," I felt worried though. It wasn't about my looks. Rather, it's Astrid's insistence that we venture into the barrow that's the problem. That place was seemingly ancient, imposing, and somehow totally bizarre the way it appears.

I have never known of a barrow that was undiscovered for a long time. There's no way this could remained like that for a long time. Surely it would have been recorded in the annals of Norse history or at least discovered by geographic surveys these days. But I still wonder how the hell this can emerge from the sea without any explanation. It wasn't a shared dream, it wasn't a trick of the eyes, and it wasn't some elaborate, undisclosed film production.

It was an actual ancient Norse barrow.

"Is everyone all set?" Astrid called.

"All set!" Solveig and Liv answered eagerly. They were really excited on the idea of going down into the barrow. I was genuinely concerned. Putting aside how monumentally stupid yet bold of Astrid to persuade her friends to do that endeavor, it was getting dark and from the sky a storm was imminent.

The dark clouds hovered over us, slowly rolling to cover the last gleams of sunset rays as the warm gold skies faded into the gloom of twilight. Shuddering heavily from the coldness of the air and emerging from the water, I huddled myself together and tried to keep warm. My one-piece swimsuit, though more modest than my friends' bikinis, didn't help.

Astrid walked up to the doors of the barrow, which we followed. Its exterior was made out of metal, heavily corroded to an unrecognizable shape with algae and barnacles encrusting the lumpy, mottled surface. I was only able to recognize some remnants of what the door originally looked like in its prime, which were the intricate, interwoven patterns that were recognizably Norse, present on the rims and certain parts of the door.

Astrid slammed her palms on the iron doors, bracing herself as she adjusted her posture in order to push the doors open. "Stand back, sisters, I'm going to open the doors."

"Ugh, you're going to get tetanus or something doing that," Liv squealed in disgust as she slightly winced with her arms raised.

"Don't worry, Liv, I've been moving things with my bare hands and my own strength ever since I was little," Astrid boasted playfully. She then immediately pushed the doors. I felt worried seeing this since I didn't want her to get hurt or infected from trying to budge these open.

It was a less-than-astounding sight than I expected. Astrid tried pushing the doors to which it did not budge an inch. Solveig and Liv clapped, cheering for her to rouse her enthusiasm and passion despite their reluctance. Maybe it was the exciting notion, to an blindingly oblivious extent, of entering an actual Norse tomb that got the better of their own judgment and instincts.

I looked up arch of the frame of these doors. Likewise, it was badly eroded and encrusted with a sickly green of algae and sponges alternating with the stone of barnacles and mussels. One thing that I found legible was an inscription, written in Elder Futhark and hence Old Norse language. Although it was rendered nigh-unreadable with missing or partially-obscured runes, I could still manage to deduce the text of the inscription though with some gaps in it.

Then suddenly, the iron doors swung open with an immerse crash when Astrid did the final push. The strong blast of musty, briny air from the dark mouth of the cave blew against us. I was briefly stunned, forgetting about my concerns as I gazed into the whistling yawn of the barrows.

Hearing that, my nerves frazzled and I felt my body jump like a leaping lizard, frightened by it. Cold sweat started dripping from my body with an overwhelming shudder and a nervous gaze at the barrow's interior. I felt I had no courage to venture deep into whatever's within this place.

My friends noticed my frightened, worried expression. Solveig looked at me with a sympathetic gaze. "What's wrong? Why you're scared?"

"Nothing," I covered up my current mood. "It's just that I feel really nervous going an adventure down here with you."

"Don't worry. We're with you, Ingrid," Astrid consoled. "Swallow those fears, Ingrid. Think of it as an adventure park, like Skyrim. I'm sure you'll have a sky-high of a holiday."

"Yep," I agreed, though I subtly objected to the whole thing.

Astrid pumped her arms up into the air with a big smile and closed eyes as she turned around to face the entrance of the barrow. "Let's have an adventure we'll never forget!"

Entering the depths of the barrow, we were greeted by a stairway within the borders of the passageway. It was small and cramped, barely enough to fit us while we walked in a line with ample room to move. The large wyrm heads with its distinctly and obvious Norse style that were also present on the floors and the curved walls with arches supporting it.

Since it was really dark in here with the last vestiges of light dimming away from the open door, Astrid brought a lot of waterproof, rechargeable flashlights just in case, which surprised me. She gave each of us a big torchlight and a spare flashlight small in size. In a brief moment of levity, I joked that she was always prepared for in every possible contingency, whether it could happen or not.

Still, I was extremely afraid and worried. The deeper we delved into the barrow, the more that hunch grew like some black weed ensnaring me whole around my neck and heart. I felt a choking sensation in my throat, slowly tightening its grip the further down.

The air became colder accompanying the growing dark surroundings as we arrived at the bottom of the stairway passage. Soon, it was pitch-black with the only source of light coming from our torchlights. 

The chamber below the stairs was simply a straight and spacious corridor. It was curved like the stairs beforehand and felt like we're in a modestly-sized service tunnel. The water flooding the floor was knee-deep and made an unpleasant sloshing sound.

It was here that the air became extremely foul and bitter in stench. It was the stench of rot and decay by the sea and time. Vanished were the detailed Norse ornamentation, replaced by simple, megalithic designs with similarly simplified geometry. It was more reminiscent of genuine Visigothic and Ostrogothic styles found in Spain and Italy with a substantial Norse influence.

The wyrm heads were sparse and spaced out with larger gaps between them, but in exchange these were more elaborate to the point it looked like it was going to pounce due to the shadows from the limited sources of light. One thing that was different was the bas-reliefs along the wall between the wyrm heads.

"So spooky," Solveig said. "I can barely see even with this light."

"You have a very luminous torchlight. I'm sure you can clearly see what's in here," Liv replied, fear slightly tinging her voice.

"No, no," Solveig replied. "I mean it's really dark. My eyesight's poor in such conditions."

"Heh, heh," Astrid giggled as she stopped and turned around. "I think you should spend some time training your eyes to adapt in the dark. Look, I did that exercise in the woods."

"Wouldn't eating carrots be better alternative?" Liv asked.

"That's a wartime propaganda myth propagated by the Allies," I corrected. "It was used as a distraction to cover the fact that the British utilized night vision technology for their air force."

"Dammit," Liv grunted in defeat.

"It's fun," I said. "But you really think it's a good idea to go down the bottom of this barrow. I feel very cold and I'm really, really frightened by the surroundings."

"Are you serious?" Astrid replied. "Ingrid, we're not turning back after walking all the way down here. It's an adventure of a lifetime."

"Sisters, are you?" I replied.

"Although it's cold as you say," Solveig said. "You're just ruining the mood here."

"It's ancient and undocumented," I chided. "What more do you expect? This thing suddenly rose out of the sea without any explanation. We should turn back and inform the authorities and archeologists about this barrow. Plus, we're wearing completely inappropriate attire for exploration."

"You've said that before," Liv said. She brushed her red hair as she looked at Astrid. "We're going to make the best of what we can explore."

"Sisters," Astrid pointed at the bas-reliefs. "Is it just me, or are those bas-reliefs look kind of creepy? Take a look."

I turned around at the direction she was pointing at and shone a light towards it. Along the walls, I could clearly see more of what it looked like. The sculptures were broken and eroded with missing parts and other parts, and runic inscriptions worn down to an unreadable form. But nonetheless, I was able to observe and interpret these reliefs.

"What is it?" Liv inquired as she approached over my shoulder.

"Hey, don't get so close to me. It isn't funny when it's very dark and it's intruding into my personal space," I chided, nearly frightened to death by her sudden, unannounced arrival.

I took another glance again at the bas-reliefs. Along the walls, it relayed some sort of narrative despite some gaps due to its age and damage. The thing was, though, it didn't correspond to any established and pre-existing accounts from actual history or myths of the Norse. It felt strange, out-of-place even, if outright mystical and demonic, if there was a word for it.

My body suddenly had an urge to quiver greatly once I pieced together the narrative of the bas-reliefs and its accompanying runic inscriptions. I explained it thusly to my friends, who stood there eagerly with morbid curiosity. I was reluctant to explain, but I mustered the courage despite my reservations and fears.

"A jarl feared death as he approached old age. Knowing the inevitability of it, he sought the cleverness and skill of a crone. She instructed the jarl to find a black jewel from the depths. So he brought a band of men and journeyed to an island near to the far north and slain a warrior in black, for which they took his heart before his body vanished, and retrieved the jewel."

"What happens next?" Solveig asked.

"Well then, it gets bizarre and frightening, but I'll try," I swallowed in fear. "The crone drew a ritual circle and instructed the jarl and his men to enter it. Using the black jewel and the heart, she transformed them into deathless forms. However, this left them insane and they were imprisoned in a barrow built by his brother."

"That's very scary," Astrid noted. "But this seems nonsensical and piddling. Where's the full story?"

"That's all I can ever reconstruct based on available material," I admonished. "We're lucky that a substantial portion of this bas-relief is preserved. There's a lot of gaps between the narrative due to pieces fallen into disrepair since the last time this place was probably open."

"That seems to be worth being called the mystery of the ages," Liv said. "Isn't that right, Solveig?"

"Yeah, as insipid and dull as it sounds, this barrow sure holds a fascinating tale. Surely there must be a full story behind this," Solveig said.

"Can't we just turn back already?" I pleaded. It was getting stressful by the minute. I was already shivering from how cold the room was and scared from how dark it was. "I think it's a great delve and all, but I think it's time we stop and go home. It's getting late out there."

"And why we would even do that?" Astrid stood her position. "We came all this way down after all we went through, Ingrid. There's another room up ahead and I want to see it."

"But Astrid," I said, my voice trailing off into the dripping, gloomy ambiance. I pointed at the door at the end of the corridor.

"We don't know what's truly up ahead. I have a bad feeling about it. I sense a dangerous thing up ahead," I pointed at the door at the end of the corridor. I was scared to the core. I couldn't understand what was going on, but I felt there was something within that barrow which disturbs me greatly.

When I turned around, Astrid was gone. She had just slid off quietly, leaving only a trail of footsteps followed by ripples in the water. Her friends also followed suit. Startled, I saw the door at the end of the corridor opened ajar, offering no ambiguity of what was going on.

I ran towards the end of the corridor, entering to whatever is beyond that door. Entering the room, I was greeted to a majestic, but decrepit room. It was circular in layout and surprisingly spacious for something that was built underground. 

The stonemasonry-built walls and ceiling, designed in a plain, unremarkable fashion with perfectly-slotted slabs and bricks coupled with carvings and pillars akin to the Neolithic tombs with some elements of actual Gothic architecture.

A sickly, yet light blue bathed the room. It was the bioluminescence of the phosphorescent algae that grew on the surrounding walls. At the middle of the room was a raised plinth, on it was pedestal.

I saw Astrid standing in front of the pedestal, gazing on that pedestal. Liv and Solveig flanked her with them staying behind to watch. I ran closer to them, my foot splashing on the cold water and ancient, timeworn stone floor of the room.

"Ingrid!" Astrid called my name. She gestured by waving her hands forward as she pointed at the pedestal with her other arm. "Look what I found," she clamored.

I focused my eyes at the thing she was pointing at. It was a piece of jewelry, shimmering under the faint light of the room and our flashlights. I adjusted my glasses to check whether it was a trick of my eyes, and to get a clearer look at it. I approached the plinth, slowly walking up the terraced steps.

It was a golden necklace shaped like a dragon. The ornate and intricate design, bearing the hallmarks of an authentic artifact of the Norse era, was inlaid with an assortment of gemstones - diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, rubies, and amethysts. It was engraved with motifs and runes of the culture it was crafted.

Holding together the necklace was a disc-shaped pendant with concentric circles. It was inserted with four engraved gemstones, each of a different color and accompanying rune, with one at the center of the pendant. From clockwise at the twelve o'clock position, a red ansuz, a blue sowilo, a green isaz, and a yellow laguz. The center gem was a purple othala rune.

Then, I saw a runic inscription at the bottom of the pedestal. Although it was covered in gunk and mold, and the writings faded, I was able to glean the contents of the text.

Then suddenly, Astrid ran up the plinth. Startled even before I could interpret and translate the text, I stopped her by grabbing her shoulder. "Hold up, Astrid."

"Hey, why you're stopping me?"

"Astrid," I told her. "There's an inscription at the plinth," I pointed my flashlight at that. The light made the runes clearer for me to read with its blood-read strokes.

"Ingrid, that necklace is so pretty!" she cooed. "I want to take it,"

"That one is a legitimate historical artifact, not just something you'd buy from the local retailer. It has marks of authentic craftmanship and age."

"What does it say?" Solveig asked, pointing at the inscription.

I was a student in Old Norse language and culture. I was familiar with every word listed in the books and the grammar along with the capacity to read its written form. It was a short inscription, so I quickly memorized the writing and transcribed and translated it.

My voice quivered. "The Drowned Ones beneath the dark depths of the sea, waiting for the day he emerges above the tides. Whosoever wears this necklace, if she be worthy, shall be the herald of their host as the Bride of the Tides."

Solveig and Liv gazed at me with a startled, yet enthralled gaze. It was as though they were deeply both captivated and frightened by what I said. But Astrid, she was really nonplussed and unimpressed. Her face remained in that bright-eyed, adventurous smile which continued to persist despite the darkness and rather foreboding atmosphere of this room.

"Drowned Ones," she exclaimed. "Sounds metal!"

"This isn't a metal music video," I admonished loudly. "I don't know whether this inscription is true or not, but I think we shouldn't do it! Astrid, get back to your senses and let's leave as soon as possible." I pleaded with never such intensity and desperation. Actual fear tinged my voice, shaking and quivering rhythmically with the cold and dark.

"Hah!" Astrid scoffed, snorting loudly and then haughtily laughing. "What does it even mean? A soggy legend won't stop me in any way."

She quickly ran up, approaching the pedestal. She plucked off the necklace from it, and then immediately putting it on her neck, fastening the clasp as it locked with a tight and secure click. Contrary to my expectations, nothing happened.

"How do I look? Doesn't this necklace make me prettier and hotter?" Astrid playfully remarked as she posed in all sorts of poses that made her attractive and emphasized her womanly parts.

"You go girl!" Solveig said.

"That red bikini of yours looks fantastic in the lack of light!" Liv said.

I laughed awkwardly, though still very uneasy with the air around me and the warning that lingered in my mind. I felt a sudden jolt from my back like lightning struck me. I shuddered again, which I turned around to see the doors closed behind me. The air suddenly became cooler. My breath slightly fogged when I exhaled.

Meanwhile, Solveig and Liv were just endlessly complimenting and secretly admiring at Astrid's beautiful and well-toned body as she posed with that necklace around her neck. I thought they were being silly and amicable with her, which was always be for time immemorial.

Then suddenly, I heard a sound.

A loud, deep and raspy moan echoed in the chamber. Astrid froze instinctively at the sound, just as she posed doing that domineering position. Liv hugged Solveig for comfort as she was frightened, frantically looking around for the source of that awful noise.

I stood there without moving an inch. That noise continued to echo and reverberate long after it was bellowed. I exhaled softly and carefully, my body shuddering from the fright. My exhalation was very foggy and my teeth started to chatter.

"Solveig! I'm scared!" Liv cried out, tightening her grip on Solveig.

"It's alright. It's probably just the age of this place," Solveig consoled her despite it being increasingly apparent that whatever was going on wasn't clearly and straightly natural.

I heard a cry. I saw Astrid falling to her knees on the plinth, her legs spread out on the floor as she struggled to pull out the necklace which had fastened shut and wouldn't come off.

I saw glimpses, as she thrashed, of her face desperate and terrified as she tried to pry off that thing. She repeatedly gasp for air, seeing that necklace was tightening, constricting like a snake around her throat and leaving welts that burned on her skin.

"Somebody help me!" Solveig yelped with a howl of fear and deathly worry.

The walls around started to weep with the foul and bitter stench of salt and rotting seaweed as water seeped from the cracks and gaps. The room began quaking heavily, dust and pebbles falling from the ceiling as I lost my balance. My bare feet, submerged knee-deep, felt it from the reverberating ripples. Soon, there were torrential rivulets of seawater while the horrid stench grew stronger and more pungent.

"INNNGGGGRRRRIIIIIIDDDD!!!" a voice screamed on top of her lungs in utter agony and terror, then gasping and gargling. My head whipped in the direction of that scream. I saw Astrid. She had fallen to the floor with that necklace fully strangling her throat as it glowed with an unearthly red. Her face was already blue from the lack of oxygen and blood flow, and expressing a cocktail of emotions that I couldn't fully process, but it was mostly fear and despair.

"Astrid...?" I whimpered, stretching my arm towards her. "I'm coming!"

I slowly approached her in an attempt to console her. The room was flooding and it had reached up to my thighs. Frigid seawater was sloshed and splashed against my one-piece swimsuit, feeling the deathly cold and brine on my skin and having to briefly taste it when it landed on my lips like a thousand tiny whips.

To my terror, I froze upon seeing Astrid close-up, for what I saw deeply and relentlessly scarred me for life. Gasping loudly to my terror, I slowly backed away, moving by centimeter by centimeter. More water splashed against my body, climbing up to my waist and imminent towards my chest. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't muster even an iota of the fear I was feeling at the moment and what I saw of my dear friend.

Her eyes, her blue eyes were still... blue like she always had. But it was much brighter to the point I saw her entire orb glow with eldritch blue color that glowed in the dark. Her eye sockets hollowed and darkened with such a pace that I only saw a bluish glow in those. I was unable to stare into those eyes, yet I came to realize the soulless, deep-black sclera like obsidian staring into my heart and soul.

Her smooth, fair and unblemished skin slowly shriveled and decayed, her pigmentation turning from a hale white skin into a greyish hue, but I'd say pale blue. Some of her skin sloughed off with a sickly plop into the water, accompanied by a reek of putrefaction. Her jaws were shriveled and wrinkled so thoroughly that I could see her teeth when she tried to speak, but only a horrid groan that slid between the teeth with shrunken gumline.

"My time has come," she gurgled with a voice that wasn't hers. "I have risen from the depths of the abyss, for my soul has transcended death and beyond Hel."

The temperature plummeted like a titanic collision. Icicles and frost started condensing on the walls with such a speed that I thought I was in fast motion. Seawater rushed in faster and voluminous, to the point it had promptly reached up to my shoulders.

I turned around, away from the horrid sight of what Astrid had become. She wasn't Astrid, but some ancient spirit from a long-dead civilization. I waded through the water, hoping to flee from that awful creature. My heart hammered as my feet touched the cold, slimy floor and even colder water that immersed me.

"Liv! Solveig!" I screamed, trying to warn my other friends. "Get out of there! We're going to drown!"

And I saw them. With my own eyes, I saw them that broke my heart and mortified me. I couldn't see due to the water drowning out the light, but I could see, I could clearly see something, something has seized my friends. 

A myriad of writhing, wiggling tendrils rose from the torrential floodwaters in this chamber like worms after a summer drizzle. The flexed as they writhed, swinging their appendages in unison, in a movement that was both livid and vivid.

From where I stood, frozen, I saw my friends' bodies being hoisted upright into the air by their arms and legs, spread-eagled. They were soaked and limp, frostbite eating up their bodies. Their attire was tattered, rendered filthy by muck, slime, and seawater. I could not see their faces, but briefly, even in a moment, they were dead-frozen with Liv screaming and Solveig despairing.

I ran.

I ran as fast as I could.

I dodged the whipping of the kelp-tentacles, crashing into the water like a wrecking ball that deafened my ears. I plowed through the rising water as it rushed up to my chin. I walked up the steps leading to the door and tried to open.

I wouldn't budge.

I rammed against the door with all my strength, over and over again as I was fully submerged. I thought I was going to die, with the extreme cold piercing my body and the mere thought of drowning and being killed by the tentacles, but those thoughts I channeled to provide my strength.

I broke down the door with one final, brutal push. I toppled on the floor as seawater rushed out. I smelled mould and tasted the rancid, acrid seawater from the chamber. I staggered, struggled to stand up and run after nearly drowning and knocked over in the process. My feet struggled to maintain a foothold while my body tried to maintain its balance on the slippery, cold stone floor.

I heard a hoarse, deep growl from behind. It spoke in an archaic, unrecognizable language. It was soon clear it was catching up and approaching me. I didn't even dare think about what happened to Solveig and Liv, only that they hopefully died before things got worse. I shuddered, not bothering to even mentally transcribe and translate the words that were said.

As I stood up and ran, I slipped again. The stumbled down the damp, flooded floor, my glasses falling out of my eyes. I shrieked as I scrambled to grab it. Everything was a blur and pitch-black in even colder air and water. I heard a loud shatter as it plopped into the water, followed by a big rush.

Regardless, my heart pounded as adrenalin rushed in my body. I ran directly towards the way we entered here. My legs strained and burned as I stood up, paradoxically against the coldness and darkness of the surroundings. I ran and ran as fast as I could like lightning. I dared not to turn back as I felt the foreboding, fearsome presence come closer behind me.

I ran up the steps. My feet struggled to maintain its grip on the worn, slippery stone, which I staggered and stumbled in a frantic, furious rush to escape this vile place. A breeze of cold, yet fresh sea air blew against me, which was somehow kinder and comforting than the air of the depths of the barrow. A blurry glimpse of moonlight and the stars, like painted dreams in a Nordic summer night.

Feeling the fury and fear deep within me, I screamed loudly and fiercely as I climbed up the stairs and lunged out of the maws of the barrow. Though it was blurry, I saw a faint glimpse of the short in front of me. I stepped on the stone patio and immediately darted into the water.

A great, raw and thunderous sound echoed through the hollows of the barrow and out of the maws. A shockwave hurled me into the sea like thunder. I was immediately stunned, unable to coherently think as I struggled to adjust my position underwater, struggling to find some air in the depths. I saw the glimmer of moonlight above the water, I swam up as an indicator of my orientation.

My arms and legs ached as I swam up with what remains of my energy as my lungs started screaming for air. Surfacing up the water with a loud, pained gasp, immediately I swam towards the faraway shoreline in the frame of my sight. I closed my eyes and just swam and swam and swam and swam and swam.

My mind was deeply terrified and numb. I was hypervigilant with all my senses flared up with vivid detail, knowing all the sensations that enveloped my body. Blankly, I swam and swam and swam and swam and swam with my eyes closed. The voice was still there. Not Astrid's, but the spirit who used her body as a medium, echoing across the vast, uncaring sea, dwarfing the rolling waves, the stormy squall, and the pounding of raindrops.

I felt something soft touching my soles. I kicked, swimming harder trying to flee from what dwells in that barrow. Splashing and sloshing, I felt the small, faint breeze against my face. The water was shallower and less fierce. I opened my eyes and saw a reflection of myself - a lithe young woman with a brown bobcut and tanned skin, devoid of her glasses that made her nerdy - despite how much of a blur my vision was.

In an instant, I stepped on a patch of soft sand. I quickly stumbled and staggered as I emerged from the water. I was exhausted, my limbs sore and wet and cold from swimming away from the water. I opened my eyes, falling face-forward on a rocky outcropping. I adjusted the straps of my one-piece swimsuit, now filthy and frayed from fleeing from the barrow.

"Seier!" I screamed, repeating this chant over and over in desperation. I was an atheist, not believing in gods, but I prayed for the salvation of the souls of my friends - Astrid, Solveig, and Liv. I prayed their souls would enter heaven instead of being beneath the dark and insidious depths of the barrow.

And then suddenly, I heard her voice.

"Ingrid,"

Fearfully, I turned around. My head quivered and shuddered, trying to to twitch backwards out of instinct, away from what was calling my name. My blood ran cold as though it was immediately frozen. I lifted my arms, my fingers posed like claws. When I fully turned my head, after struggling for a few moments trying to forcefully overcome my instinctual urge and fear, I screamed.

It was Astrid. She was ethereal like moonlight, the background seen through her translucent body, and phosphorescent and shimmering with silver hue. She was floating above water, her feet a few inches above the sea. 

Her hair floated and whipped as if she was submerged underwater. She wasn't like the foul draugr she transformed and looked almost normal. Almost normal. Her skin was pale as snow and her hair was platinum blonde like our other friend Katja.

Just behind her in the background was that accursed, mephitic barrow. The black spires surrounding its water-eroded, dark mound slowly submerged into the sea with a great, sickening growl and gargle accompanied with sloshing and rumbling. It was as if this structure had served its purpose and now returning to the dark, dead depths of the sea, never to be seen again under the moonlight of the beach.

"YOU'RE NOT HER!" I screamed at the phantom taking the likeness of Astrid's.

Almost immediately, without a second thought or any moment of hesitation, I sprinted with my hairs stood up. I dashed blindly into the woods that were just up ahead of me. I was scared, really terrified. All my friends are dead, and whatever was freed from that barrow now wanted to pursue me.

I just ran, hoping the voices would dissipate into the dead of night. I dared not look back, for I knew that spirit, or demon, or whatever supernatural being that came from the barrow, was pursuing me, telling me to return and embrace. 

My feet scraped, crunched and pierced with the leaf litter, twigs, pebbles, and other things lying on the forest floor and underbrush. Branches and shrubs of the thicket and the trees birched against my face and body, leaving cuts and bad gashes on my skin, but it didn't matter.

It was painful and I was cold and wet, but I kept moving on because the alternative was dying by the hands of the thing. I saw the lights ahead. It was Astrid's hometown. I screamed loudly as I entered the limits of the town. I saw the closest house in my distance, lit by the inside, and dashed blindly towards it, hoping to find shelter and refuge from the thing.

Days later, a missing persons report was filed. In and out of count hospital where I was recovering, I was brought for questioning by the police. I lied, not because I wanted to deceive or cover up some horrible crime, but I knew the truth and it was too horrible for me to speak, too fantastic to even explain. Lied, I maintained that me and my friends were swimming and we were caught in some rough surf and hidden current, and they drowned.

Drowned like the spirit within the depths barrow.

By them.

And the voices of the dead speak.

Astrid, Solveig, and Liv.

I'm sorry. I pray you are in a better place than the cold, dark tomb.

I cannot escape agony. They are still out there in the above, already freed from their prison for centuries. Every time I sleep, close my eyes, shut off the dark in silence, I hear whispers. Chanting in Old Norse, deep, hoarse, and raspy, declaring the return of the Drowned Ones; invoking the sacred name of Nerthus and Loki amidst a plethora of obscene, forgotten names of yore. They beckon me to come and join in their ranks, in the depths of the North Sea where they reside.

And one day, they will rise. This barrow will rise from the dark, dead depths of the sea, looking for more souls to be sacrificed in its maw and depths. And they will grow powerful with each passing day, each soul sacrificed.

For a year and a day, I have left.
