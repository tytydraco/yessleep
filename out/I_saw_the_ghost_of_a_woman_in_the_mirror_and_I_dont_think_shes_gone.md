I’ve been trying to ignore the weird things that have been happening in my house, but last night something happened that I can’t explain. I’m scared to even talk about it, but I need to write it down. Maybe someone can tell me what the hell is going on, because I don’t know how much longer I can take it.

I moved into this house a little over a year ago. It’s a small, two-story place, built in the late 1800s. Nothing special—nothing to indicate that anything weird would be going on. But then, right after I moved in, I started noticing odd things.

It started with the sound of footsteps at night. I thought it was just creaky floors or maybe the wind, but it always happened at the same time—around 2:00 AM. Soft, shuffling footsteps, like someone dragging their feet across the floor. It would wake me up every time. I’d get up, check the house, and nothing. Empty. It was always empty.

But last night, I saw her.

I was in my bathroom around 11 PM, brushing my teeth before bed. The bathroom has this old, full-length mirror on the wall, kind of weird, but it came with the place so I left it there. I had just finished brushing when I caught a glimpse of something in the mirror.

At first, I thought it was just the reflection of the light behind me, but then I saw a figure standing behind me in the mirror. A woman. I froze, not daring to turn around. She was tall, wearing an old-fashioned dress, like something from the 1800s. Her hair was dark and tangled, and she was staring at me. Her eyes were wide, unblinking, and empty.

I tried to turn around, but my body wouldn’t move. I was completely paralyzed, staring at this woman in the mirror who wasn’t in the room with me. The air felt thick, heavy, almost like I couldn’t breathe. I just stood there, too scared to even blink.

Then, she did something that sent chills down my spine. She started to smile. It wasn’t a warm smile, not even close. It was a twisted, jagged grin, and she tilted her head like she was studying me.

I finally snapped out of it. I turned around, but the room was empty. The mirror showed nothing but my reflection. I felt sick, my heart racing, and I ran out of the bathroom without even finishing brushing my teeth. I didn’t go back in until this morning.

But here’s the thing: after I saw her last night, I’ve been hearing things again. More footsteps, more whispers, like someone’s standing just behind me. The worst part? Every time I pass that mirror now, I see her face in the reflection, just for a split second. I don’t know if it’s my mind playing tricks on me, or if she’s really there.

I’ve tried covering the mirror with a blanket, but it doesn’t help. It’s like she’s still there, watching. Waiting.

I don’t know how much longer I can stay here. If you’ve ever had an experience like this, please, tell me what I should do. Because I’m pretty sure this isn’t just a haunted house anymore. This... this feels personal.
