For centuries, dealing with mental illnesses was done in a very inhumane way. You can't blame the doctors back then completely, they didn't know. In a way it was even comical that they thought that they could measure someone's head and say “yup, this person is an arsonist” or something. Heck, they used to think that staring at the moon would make people insane (Luna is another name for Moon and now you know where the word “lunatic” comes from).

  
What isn't funny about this, is that they thought the cure for schizophrenia was ice baths, mothers who were grieving from the death of their babies had to have electric shocks and people who had depression should be confined to a room and do nothing but stare at a blank wall (they literally thought that the nervous system was overtaxed and doing nothing was a cure, now we know that isn't the case). 

  
And I didnt even mention the horrors Geraldo Rivera uncovered at Willowbrook or the frontal lobotomies that were all too common.

  
The reason I bring all this up is because I think I came across something much worse while doing some urban exploring in Goose Creek Sanitarium, a hospital in my hometown that had been abandoned long before I was born. 

  
In one of the filing cabinets was the medical journal of Doctor Hogg that had worked in the hospital during the nineteen twenties. The name meant nothing to me at the time, but that didn't stop me from reading through it. 

  
The paper had suffered from water damage over the years and was half eaten by silverfish by the time I stumbled across it. However, from those pages I was able to piece together a very menacing story.  
Doctor Hogg was convinced that he could cure every mental ailment by performing questionable experiments on his patients. Most of the language he used was a bit over my head, but I understood that everything from mental afflictions, memory, personality to perhaps even the soul was not physically in the brain, but instead only existed electrically. 

  
Because of this Hogg thought that if he extracted these electrical impulses and shared them with others who were connected to the machine of his own device, he could “cancel out” some qualities. He was sure that as long as he could find “polar mental opposites” his theory would work.

  
The way it was described it was as though all these patients didnt know where they ended and the others began, and personally, I couldnt imagine a worse kind of torture. 

  
This went on for a full ten days. He noted every twisted detail for prosperity. 

  
In my opinion I think the man was a sadist. 

  
On the tenth day the patients stopped showing signs of their conditions and started to act like completely different people. More than that, they started acting like the same person. Not only would the patients finish each other's sentences but they would also talk in unison.

  
At first the doctor thought this was residual effects and that over time they would all readjust to the “cure”. However, it wasn't long before the patients started to show signs of precognition and in a few cases, “pyromancy” (the doctor's word, not mine). Seeing this in his patients, the doctor was convinced that the people he subjected to the machine he built were possessed by legion, even going as far as quoting scripture and blaming himself for “opening the door to damnation.”

  
Over the months, the doctor grew more terrified of his patients and in order to cover up any wrong doings, he brought a gun to work with the intention of killing those who he thought were possessed.  
That was the last entry in the doctor's journal, but I had to know what happened next. 

  
I searched the rest of the abandoned sanitarium for anything I could find, but there was nothing there. At least nothing I could read. 

  
Down in the basement I found a monstrosity of brass and iron and copper, covered in rust. After cleaning it of rust and cobwebs, I tried posting it on Reddit (Whatsthatthing) but the best answer I got was movie props for a horror movie featuring a mad scientist. Though the user admitted that this was just a guess.

  
During my quest to discover the truth behind this bizarre tale, I traveled to the library in town and went through the microfiche in the back.

  
I was about to call it quits when I came across a headline from 1927. “Inmates Make Daring Escape.”  
The rest of the article highlighted the fact that even though the patients lived in different cells and floors, and had no way of communicating to each other, they worked in unison to escape. Then, most puzzling of all, they leapt from a fifth story window and ran out into the woods where they were never seen again.

  
It sounds crazy, I know. However as I read that headline, a flood of memories came over me and for the first time in years I remembered a story that my grandmother used to tell me before bed. The one about the neighboring woods and how she would hear noises at night when she was a little girl.

  
Coupling this with the fact that the town already thought that the woods were haunted by ghosts and monsters of all kinds, convinced me that there was something to my grandmother's story.

  
The more research I did about doctor Hogg, the more disturbed I became. Years after he was about to kill the patients, he became incarcerated at the very hospital he worked at. There, he tried convincing everyone that he had opened a door and summoned demons.

  
The jury is still out on whether Hogg was insane or not. But that doesnt matter to me as much as getting the machine in working order. I am sure as long as I can get it to work that there would be someone willing to purchase it. Who knows? Maybe what he said is true and it really opens a door and allows demons into our world?

  
I hope it works. I had enough of this world and I want it to end.

  
Perhaps I should test it on my landlord? No one would complain if he went [missing](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/).
