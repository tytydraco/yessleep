Start off by saying my names max I’m 23 currently, I have some issues that i barely let anyone know, I’m bipolar and a bit of a narcissistic person. I don’t mean to be that way it’s just how I turned out, trust me if I could change it I would, I just have major trust issues so going to a therapist is kinda out of the question even if I need to go to one, I know it’s not healthy but I’m trying I guess, just not hard enough as some people say. The way they think they can talk about stuff that I can’t control like that makes me mad, I also have anger issues which is another thing I don’t tell a lot of people..I don’t mean to harm people it just comes naturally I’m a very open person, example: if you tell me if you need me to rate your outfit honestly, I’ll be pretty honest which most times makes people a bit angry at me that call it dog shit or something like that but they asked me to be honest, so it’s not my fault. Anyway I only have a few actual friends that I trust, about four people, I’m just going to get on with the story to save you boredom. 


I moved in with one of my friends a few weeks ago, actually she’s my best friend her names Macy, also before anyone thinks that we’re dating she’s lesbian and I have my options open, though I never really liked people that much I always found myself different from others. Through my whole my whole life people either disliked me or full on hated me, I try not to be effected by them which was kinda hard until I got to 8th grade when I stoped caring what people thought of me. I was alone for most of my life and I still am sometimes, my father passed away when I was younger and my mom went into a very depressive state, she still distances herself from talking about him which I understand. I love my mom a lot when I was young she was my favorite person and she still is I just can’t get over the affection when I was younger, people used to call me a mommas boy all the time which I would get mad at but I was, and I still am. 


When me and Macy moved in together we did it to save money and split bills, her girlfriend broke up with her before we moved in together, she talked about splitting the bills and I eventually agreed, she’s my best friend so living with her wouldn’t be that bad I thought…I was wrong so, so wrong. 


The moment we got there the neighbors were way to friendly and I don’t mean “welcome!” Friendly, they would talk to us each chance they got and they were so touchy, I’m not an ugly guy I’ll admit I’m pretty good looking, I’ve got called cute/hot by 
A lot of people, I normally either nod or say yeah. But their daughter (I’m guessing who’s a lot younger then me 15-16 since she looks young) keeps trying to touch me or make suggestive gestures to me. And I’ve told her parents “get your daughter I am not catching a case for that thing.” Safe to say they didn’t do anything..they were just pissed. 


Also their mom Kisha keeps going into our yard every night almost and looks up at our rooms and she looks there for a good 30-a minute, until her husband Shawn comes out and scolds her, I always keep my window opened at night, I know it’s stupid but it helps me sleep, they both look in their mid 30’s. I know I shouldn’t be talking about them like their animals but honestly I don’t really give a damn if their dog keeps shitting in MY yard. Which is disgusting since they don’t pick it up even though I’ve asked them “pick up your dogs shit when you walk him.” I also occasionally go on either nightly around 8pm-9pm or early walks 5am-6:30 I have a strict schedule for working out, it makes me less stressed and anxious when I have work in the evening I work 9/5 I work as a mechanic, it’s a good job I like it, I also drive a motorcycle which makes girls fold (don’t know why I find it annoying) I also have a STEM degree, I’m not a stupid guy I’m actually pretty smart.

Macy thinks their just being nice but I don’t know if I’m just being over exaggerating but I don’t trust them. I don’t know if it’s my gut feeling or the fact I’m not a people person but god there daughter scares the hell out of me…
