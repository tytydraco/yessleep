Start off by saying my names max I’m 17, black, I have dreads that fade black to blonde, I also have grills, green eyes, I’m pretty strong. Currently, I have some issues that i barely let anyone know, I’m bipolar and a bit of a narcissistic person. I don’t mean to be that way it’s just how I turned out, trust me if I could change it I would, I just have major trust issues so going to a therapist is kinda out of the question even if I need to go to one, I know it’s not healthy but I’m trying I guess, just not hard enough as some people say. The way they think they can talk about stuff that I can’t control like that makes me mad, I also have anger issues which is another thing I don’t tell a lot of people..I don’t mean to harm people it just comes naturally I’m a very open person, example: if you tell me if you need me to rate your outfit honestly, I’ll be pretty honest which most times makes people a bit angry at me that call it dog shit or something like that but they asked me to be honest, so it’s not my fault. Anyway I only have a few actual friends that I trust, about four people, I’m just going to get on with the story to save you boredom. 


I moved in with one of my friends a few weeks ago, actually she’s my best friend her names Macy, also before anyone thinks that we’re dating she’s lesbian and I have my options open, though I never really liked people that much I always found myself different from others. Through my whole my whole life people either disliked me or full on hated me, I try not to be effected by them which was kinda hard until I got to 8th grade when I stoped caring what people thought of me. I was alone for most of my life and I still am sometimes, my father passed away when I was younger and my mom went into a very depressive state, she still distances herself from talking about him which I understand. I love my mom a lot when I was young she was my favorite person and she still is I just can’t get over the affection when I was younger, people used to call me a mommas boy all the time which I would get mad at but I was, and I still am. 


When me and Macy moved in together we did it to save money and split bills, her girlfriend broke up with her before we moved in together, she talked about splitting the bills and I eventually agreed, she’s my best friend so living with her wouldn’t be that bad I thought…I was wrong so, so wrong. 


The moment we got there the neighbors were way to friendly and I don’t mean “welcome!” Friendly, they would talk to us each chance they got and they were so touchy, I’m not an ugly guy I’ll admit I’m pretty good looking, I’ve got called cute/hot by 
A lot of people, I normally either nod or say yeah. But their daughter (I’m guessing who’s a lot younger then me 15-16 since she looks young) keeps trying to touch me or make suggestive gestures to me. And I’ve told her parents “get your daughter I am not catching a case for that thing.” Safe to say they didn’t do anything..they were just pissed. 


Also their mom Kisha keeps going into our yard every night almost and looks up at our rooms and she looks there for a good 30-a minute, until her husband Shawn comes out and scolds her, I always keep my window opened at night, I know it’s stupid but it helps me sleep, they both look in their mid 30’s. I know I shouldn’t be talking about them like their animals but honestly I don’t really give a damn if their dog keeps shitting in MY yard. Which is disgusting since they don’t pick it up even though I’ve asked them “pick up your dogs shit when you walk him.” I also occasionally go on either nightly around 8pm-9pm or early walks 5am-6:30 I have a strict schedule for working out, it makes me less stressed and anxious when I have work in the evening I work 9/5 I work as a mechanic, it’s a good job I like it, I also drive a motorcycle which makes girls fold (don’t know why I find it annoying) I also have a STEM degree, I’m not a stupid guy I’m actually pretty smart.

Macy thinks their just being nice but I don’t know if I’m just being over exaggerating but I don’t trust them. I don’t know if it’s my gut feeling or the fact I’m not a people person but god there daughter scares the hell out of me…


“Macy.” I said in my regular tone of voice. 

“Yeah what’s up max!” She replied sitting on the couch with her German shepherd Kai. 

“Im going walking for a bit.” I was going walking a bit earlier that day because I’ve been so exhausted and walking in the dark not alert would make me too vulnerable. 

“Already? It’s only 6, you normally walk later? Is everything okay..?” She responded a bit confused as to why I was walking earlier. 

“I’m fine, I just don’t want Kisha to try and talk to me while walking their dog…it’s like they copied my walking pattern, it’s freaky.” I said back, I don’t get uncomfortable that much actually, let alone I barely get gut feelings but today I just felt like 6-7 was smarter then going at my normal time 8-9. 

“Stay safe, text me if you need anything!” She replied. 


After that I went to walk, I had my headphones on listening to music until someone was following me I noticed fairly quickly and stopped and pretended to text someone, to let them pass me so I make sure their not actually following me. I had the music turned down so if they wanted to speak to me I could hear them, they didn’t yell out they just came up to me..guts, that’s for sure. 

“Don’t, don’t trust those people..DONT!” They said to me in almost a whispering tone. 

“Who? Don’t trust who..?” I responded fairly quickly the boy was a little younger than me, 18-19..

“My names Aiden..please..don’t trust the people next door..” he said in a shaken voice almost to scared to speak

“My names max, are you okay..?” I asked him I never cared about people at all, someone needed help, oh well but he was different..I couldn’t help but feel bad. 

“Run..please..run..don’t worry about me.” he replied

When he said that my body went into a deep freeze..run..? Run? What did he mean, run away from what? The way his blue eyes met with mine, pathetic. 

“I’m not leaving you, I can’t stand to see the weak so pathetic, it’s sickening.” I replied, I hate the weak with a passion, if you’re not strong enough to stand up for yourself, then who will..no one. 

“Excuse you!?” Aiden replied, he was offended very offended actually “I’m not weak! Just because I told you too run away!?” He’s so annoying, I thought as I took his wrist and ran away with him back to my house before he could object “hey!? HEY! Are you all muscles and no brains or something!?” He said, I didn’t take offense to it just took him inside and threw him on the couch. 


“Max!? What the hell!” Macy said she was shocked, who was that..she thought, Aiden was bruised up bloody nose black eye he had cute on his body, he looked bad. 

“Are you okay..? What’s your name! How old are you!?” Macy was asking all kinds of questions and didn’t let him talk. 

“Macy, shut up.” I said coldly not caring if it offended her “let him speak.” I followed up.

“My names Aiden, I don’t think I’m okay..please help me..I’m 14.” Aiden responded to Macy, I was wrong he was 14…pretty short for a 14 year old. 

“Jeez your short.” I didn’t mean to say that but before I could think it just exited my mouth. 

Macy gave me a nudge, Aiden looked to be 5,5 blond hair, blue eyes, baby face, and he was skinny. “Don’t listen to him Aiden! Your fine!” Macy was trying to comfort him but it failed..and Aiden started crying. I went to go get the first aid kit to bandage him up. 

“I-uhhh..sorry! Sorry! I didn’t mean to offend you! Just for reassurance! Uhh…Just don’t cry!” Macy replied trying to reassure him again this time hugging him too and treating him like a toddler. 

“I’m almost 15..!” Aiden replied proudly, he seemed innocent..very innocent. 

“I don’t think I told you who I am yet! My names Macy, I’m 18!” Macy introduced herself while I came back from the kitchen with bandages and peroxide. I started bandaging Aiden up while he let little whines out. 

“Not so hard..” Aiden responded in pain.

“I have to or else they won’t stay idiot.” I was annoyed I had to bandage this kid up. “So what happened out there?” I ask. 

“The Andrew’s daughter tried to kill me..” Aiden said cowardly, kill him..? The neighbors daughter tried to kill him? 

“What?” I replied not believing him.

“I got kicks out by my parents, and i was sitting on the curb by there house and she came out and started screaming and chasing me with a knife, her dad just watched her..so I was trying to run away from her and she managed to pin me to the ground until you came out, and then she immediately got up and ran when she seen you..” Aiden was shaking he was almost met with death, if I didn’t walk when I did, he would have died, I didn’t show it, but I’m glad I went out earlier, for Aiden’s sake. 

“Kill you..?” I replied. 

“Why’d your parents kick you out..?” Macy replied, I was wondering the same thing, his parents kicked him out? For how long? Days? Weeks? Months? Years? Forever?

“Until I get a job..” Aiden said, basically he’s homeless right now. 

“You can stay here!” Macy replied, is she insane!? Does she not know how much trouble we can get in!? 

“Absolutely not!? That’s kidnapping!” I replied, I’m NOT keeping a random kid I found on the street!

“But he could get killed!?” Macy looked up at me with puppy eyes. 

“..fine we can keep him, for a few days.” I replied, obviously I’m not happy but if it gets her to shut up then fine.
