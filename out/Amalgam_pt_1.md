This all started with a box labeled “Amalgam” in my grandfathers attic. I’ve only peaked into its contents but enough to leave me up at night asking questions. So I decided to post here to hopefully make some sense of this or at the very least, feel less alone. I’ll post here in parts as not to overwhelm you guys, thanks for taking time to read my post.


As I said, the box, our grandfather recently moved from his home to a nursing home in our state. So over winter break, me, my mom, and my dad helped him with the move. Among many of the things in his attic was the box labeled “Amalgam” but not written on it like it contained long lost childhood memories or antiques. But instead a bold, painted on font that invoked an uneasy feeling out of me. I thought about it the whole road trip back home and when we got back, I specifically made sure to bring that box to my room and into my closet. And there it sat for many weeks until relatively recently, I’ve decided to investigate it. 


I’ll attach a picture of the first thing I pulled out of the box to my profile. It was a heavily redacted medical folder, including medical forms, x-ray images, but most notably, an abnormal amount of personal doctor’s notes. Most of the forms are redacted but almost all of the doctor’s notes are kept free of censorship, only censoring specific names. The doctor notes seem to get more and more sporadic as they jump dates, with diagnosis’ crossed out and hasty writing and slang. That’s what it seems like to me anyway, and instead of having you guys zoom in and try to read this doctor’s writing, I’ve taken the liberty to type it out here. I’ll include what I think are the most important and interesting notes as there is a lot of them, below is the first one:


Patient Name: REDACTED
Date: 4/13/82

I honestly do not know where to start, Mr. [REDACTED] is an anomaly. Nothing in my career as a medical professional have I seen something like this. Allow me to go down the list of discrepancies, a healed femur that shows no evidence of EVER being broken, 3 different blood types in this patients veins, 2 appendixes despite having an appendectomy 4 years prior, I could go on with all of the odd quirks that Mr. [REDACTED] has throughout his body. But the most striking thing is his behavior, he is calm, collected, and friendly unless faced with any medical test or treatment, where he then becomes extremely violent and took an unnatural amount of medication to subdue the patient. To be honest, I do not have a diagnosis for the patient at this time and would request to hold him longer with a possible psychiatric evaluation. 

Dr. [REDACTED]


Patient Name: REDACTED
Date: 4/15/82

For the past 2 days, it has been a constant cycle. The patient no longer acts calm and collected when awake but instead resorts to screams and sounds I have never heard before. Trying to escape the room at any opportunity and we have since resorted to restraints to hold Mr. [REDACTED]. The patient had also attempted to harm staff and mutilate (itself) himself (itself is crossed out to write himself) to escape restraints. To have my personal opinion, I do not see anybody behind those eyes. I cannot formally tell you this but, i think a form for DNR is in order. The patient has been in a constant cycle of medicated comas, violence, comas, violence. And we have had to resuscitate the patient multiple times. To be honest, I think whatever is happening is killing the patient and making it suffer. And due to the biological discrepancies mentioned, I think a visit to a visit to a coroner is in order after. Unless of course you wish for the patient to remain in this state. Dearest regards,

Dr. [REDACTED]

I feel disgusted walking into that room. Get it out of that room, sign the damn form, I don’t care if I get fired anymore. It’s a stench of death. Do you think it’s normal for a person with this behavior, multiple appendixes, bones where there shouldn’t be bones, who has ONLY been eating raw meat and nothing else we try to feed them. Do you think this is normal? Better yet treatable?? You are mad. This thing is evil and god forbid, if you don’t let it die, I’ll kill it myself and find out what it really is.


After that note there is not another from this doctor. But, there are drawing, I’ll attach them too, but to describe them and the writing on them, he killed that man, and dissected him. The doctor seemed to have been driven mad. He describes an unnatural amount of rib cage bones, an altered brain, stacks of eyes in the skull and melding of bones together. But the most disturbing is the teeth. There were teeth everywhere. In its throat, in its stomach, in its arms, all seemingly human teeth. Honestly writing this right now it’s making me sick, I don’t know what to do right now, I’ll probably post more soon but I don’t think I can right now. Thank you for helping me feel less alone in this.
