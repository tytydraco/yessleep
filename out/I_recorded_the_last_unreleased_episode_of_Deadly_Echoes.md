I finished setting up the camera after spending enough time looking for the best spot to make the rest of the crew frustrated with me to the point they were loudly huffing and puffing right by my ear. I didn't care though, this story'd fascinated me ever since I first heard it some months back and I was fixated on creating the best documentary about it, and these people who I can't even call close to friends could moan about it all they wanted. That wasn't going to deter me.

"Okay, I'm done, quit complaining. Ready?" I looked up to see Megan holding the microphone up to her mouth, brushing a strand of dark, curly hair away from her forehead while nodding. "Three, two, one..."

"Good evening, we're glad to have you join the crew of Deadly Echoes again to tag along the mysteries left behind by those before us. Today we're looking at a case just as terrifying as it is infamous, we are of course talking about the ritualistic killings of the so-called "Hellbringer" Abraham. For those who might not be familiar with this gruesome tale, as always with me I have your favorite macabre storyteller Daniel to bring you up to speed on the horrors we will be facing today."

Megan passed the microphone to Daniel who was exaggeratedly puffing his chest and whose face had a massive grin plastered over it.

"Thank you Megan, and thank you once again our dear viewers for tuning in. You have no doubt at least heard of this twisted man's crimes. Abraham's sadistic rampage took place right here over two centuries ago. The story goes that after all his immediate family including his two daughters died in a tragic accident on their way to see a fare, the heartbroken man turned to the Devil for help and was convinced that he would be able to bring his children back to life. He went about appeasing him by luring countless young men and women in need of financial aid with job offers as keepers of his home during his work hours, only to burn them alive in the basement for his rituals. It is as much of a sad and tragic tale as it is a sickening and disastrous murder spree."

Out of the blue, Michael jumped into the shot, appearing from under the camera in a cheap attempt to jumpscare the audience. I found it in poor taste, as I did most of his actions - his role as the comic relief of the show forever pulled it back from what it really could have been. But, in the end, who am I to give my opinion when I am just the guy behind the camera whose face would never be seen anyway.

"Sorry for making you spill your popcorn, dear fans!" He spoke while walking backwards to Megan and Daniel, putting an arm over their shoulders as he butted in between them. "But keep yourselves sharp and on the lookout, the mansion we are about to enter holds many secrets, and maybe even the souls of those who inhabited it..."

I finished the shot and looked at Michael disapprovingly while packing the equipment back up, ready to move onto the next one. As soon as that button clicked, Megan's professional attitude dropped and she dug out a cigarette, lighting it and turning to face the towering building in the distance.

"How the hell is this place still standing, anyway. You'd think all these years ago people had better infrastructure than we do now. And I don't get the obsession with it, just your typical dead children ghost story. You couldn't get more cliche than that.”

I scoffed. If only the audience could see their supposedly lovely host's attitude towards all these tragedies.

“Make an effort to be more respectful, Megan. Even if none of these claims are true that's still people who died.”

“You're always such a damn downer.” Michael interrupted me to, as always, speak against me and remind everyone that he was the center of attention in our 'clique'. It's like running his mouth every time I had something to say was a fetish for this guy. “This family's nothing but dust or bones now anyway, what, you think the Devil's gonna show up and burn you alive or something if you talk bad about the girls whose daddy went on a mindless rampage?”

Daniel let out a forced, hacking cough and turned Michael away from me by grabbing his shoulder and spinning him around.

“Just shut up and let's go. We know we're not gonna find anything supernatural anyway, but this is still a piece of history... burned down as it might be. We might get some cool souvenirs out of it.”

“That's what you're excited about?” I sighed, expecting that at least he would be more mindful of the tragedies that occurred here.

The walk up the steep path to the Hellbringer's mansion took us a few minutes, most of the journey being filled with Megan and Michael's totally out of place jokes about the whole situation. Daniel could see my disapproval every time he glanced at me, but I kept telling myself to stay silent lest we lose more time in senseless bickering. I knew they weren't going to change.

I finished setting up the camera a few steps away from the gate leading into the yard connecting the outside entrance and the front door of the three-story mansion. This was our next shot, revealing what went down the night of Abraham's death. I gave Megan a nod and she steadied herself. Seconds later I pressed the button.

“We're standing at the gate leading into what remains of the charred estate. What you see behind me is how the building has stayed untouched by time for over two hundred years since the fire caused by Abraham's last sacrificial ritual. Daniel, tell us what happened to this once beautiful home.”

“Thank you, Megan. Dear friends, you are looking at a piece of history right now. The estate caught fire in the middle of a Wednesday night when Abraham attempted to sacrifice the only person to have survived their encounter with him, a young man named Samuel, twenty-three years old at the time. Like the rest of his victims, the Hellbringer had Samuel tied to a pyre in his basement, the area around which he'd specifically secured for this purpose. Moments after the fire had been lit the victim managed to free himself from his restraints and a confrontation between him and his captor ensued, during which he overpowered him and made his escape. As an act of revenge, Samuel started a fire on his way out of the mansion, leaving Abraham to burn and hearing the distant ghostly screams of the killer's wife and daughters during his escape. No body was ever recovered, and the mansion has remained untouched by the thread of time. Legend has it that the spirits of Abraham and the rest of his family now haunt the corridors of their once beautiful estate – them dressed the way they were on the day of their deaths, and Abraham as a fiery demon still trying to bring his loved ones back to life all these years later.”

“Thank you, Daniel. Dear viewers, together we are about to relive the end of this terrible tragedy and maybe spot the last echoes of the family members themselves. Grab your popcorn, drinks and blanket, and prepare to walk through history.”

The moment I turned the camera off, Michael immediately jumped in front of it again to deliver another obnoxious jumpscare. I smirked when I saw realization set across his face that I'd cut the footage by the time he lunged up.

“Asshole, the hell's your problem? I gave you all the parts I wanted to do a jumpscare at and Megan approved them all!” He closed the distance between us and pushed me with his right arm, almost making me topple the camera over as I struggled to keep my footing.

“Back up, kid.” I retorted and pushed him back. He seemed surprised and took a few moments to find the words to bark back at me.

“Oh, I get it. Just another one of your tantrums that you're the guy behind the camera and you ain't getting shit for doing what you do. No glory, no recognition, huh, so you gotta mess it up for the rest of us, that it?”

“Tired of you running that big mouth of yours, Michael. Sometimes I just wanna stuff something down your throat to make you shut up.”

“You wanna know what my big mouth's gotta say to you, huh, you--”

Daniel shimmied between us, using one of his arms to push me away and the other to cover Michael's spitter. Lecture incoming.

“I swear to God, I'm not in the mood for another one of your fights. Shut the hell up and don't ruin it for everyone, will you Michael?” Then he turned to me with a more relaxed expression, visibly sympathizing with me but not wanting to make the situation worse. “Please just stick to the plan. It'll be easier for all of us.”

“You all done yet?” Megan sighed, cross-armed like a disappointed mother. “Michael, you know that no matter how hard you try, I'm the star that burns the brightest, you know that? All eyes on me.”

Though on much better terms with him, Megan also found herself irritated at Michael's childish behavior and sometimes took the chance to dig into him for it, to remind him who owns the show. He seemed like he wanted to say something in response but just lowered his head and muttered incomprehensively, then went up the stairs.

It took some forcing for the door to open, surprisingly. If we're to listen to the stories, the Hellbringer's mansion burned for days on end after the last victim escaped, but this piece of charred wood was stronger than any of us expected.

Entering the mansion was a big shift of the atmosphere. While on the outside it was no more notable than any other decrepit remains of a house, big as it might be, parts of the welcoming corridor were almost untouched, and a piece of the bright red carpet looked brand new in contrast to the broken, coal-black walls and beams – some standing, some broken...

Hanging and fallen chandeliers were all around us as we continued into the foyer, at the end of which was a comically wide, decrepit staircase leading towards the second floor, a much smaller and narrow stone one beside it leading down into the basement where the rituals took place, and on opposite sides of the walls to our left and right were branching corridors leading deeper into this maze. The air still smelled of ash.

We set up for the first shoot inside the mansion itself, its focus being on getting the viewers familiar with its layout. I'll skip over boring you with it and tell you the two important things that happened here – first, the only rooms you need to know about are the basement, the two daughters' shared bedroom, and the master bedroom of Abraham and his wife. Aside from them, Megan went through literally every corridor and dead end space of the estate. This scene was such a drag.

The second thing is the first instance of disappointment from Megan that I'd have to endure in this long night. She practically couldn't wait before pretending to feel a cold chill in the middle of her recitation, something I'd told her was incredibly disrespectful and out of place for the story we're here to cover. That only earned me an eye roll and made me the butt of Michael's jokes, so... nothing new. Who listens to the operator anyway.

While I was putting away the equipment after we finished shooting, Daniel came by and crouched by me while Megan and Michael were smoking on the staircase leading upstairs, another gesture I found to be a total lack of taste and respect. He put a hand on my shoulder and spoke in a hushed tone.

“I know you don't agree with them on a lot of things, but just try and hold your tongue. You know they're not going to listen anyway, don't cause yourself any needless headaches.”

“Yeah, man, I know... just Michael's getting on my nerves even worse with each passing day. He knows I want to play a bigger part than just being the faceless guy behind the camera all the time and he uses it against me. He's no better than some teenage rebel.”

Daniel laughed and patted my shoulder then got himself back up. “I'm sure someone's gonna shut him up one way or another.”

“The sooner the better...”

We had to be extremely careful moving about the burned husk of a mansion, especially when it came to stairs, big or small. With the first floor being mainly closets, the kitchen, living room and so on, and us wanting to leave the basement for last, the four of us ascended slowly with Michael and Daniel carrying some of the equipment on their way up.

Thankfully Megan wasn't a total skeptic like Michael and still wanted to at least try and find something peculiar that was worth noting, so we decided to check the most obvious potentially haunted places – the bedrooms, duh. She and I took to the kids' room while the other two went to look around the master bedroom of Abraham and his wife.

Leaving most of the heavy equipment at the stairway, I only took a camcorder that I kept running as the two of us ventured deeper into the husk of a mansion, avoiding weak spots in the floor, seared wooden beams and the occasional oddly preserved piece of carpet, drape and the like. It really made me wonder how cloths like that survived the fire. For the first few seconds we walked in awkward silence before she spoke up.

“I'm sorry Michael's being such a dick,” Megan whispered in a tone more sincere than I'd ever heard from her, “and I'm sorry I don't do more about it. I just don't want to make the situation even worse. You work really hard, don't think I haven't taken notice.” She shined a smile that made my frustration ease slightly. Maybe she wasn't as superficial as I'd so long thought she was.

“I can manage, if he doesn't overstep. People like him get what's coming to them eventually anyway.”

“He talks before he thinks, really, don't take it too personally. He'll probably have forgotten all about it by tomorrow and won't remember what happened if you bring it up.”

“Even more proof of how underdeveloped that boy's brain is.”

“Keep it civil... but I can't say I don't agree up to a point.” She tried to keep her tone stern but I could feel the amusement hidden within.

We entered the bedroom some moments later and were greeted by less than we expected, honestly. There was little remaining inside, the stench of rotten wood and ash was overwhelming and pieces of charred furniture littered the floor and space across the walls. Nonetheless Megan began a scene, talking into the camcorder but suddenly fell silent.

“What's wrong?”

“The hell is that?” She pointed back to the doorway into the corridor and I turned around.

For a split second I saw something move in the shadows passing the room, like a leg being dragged over the floorboards, but I didn't hear it make any noise, probably because I was focused on recording. I stood there watching after it disappeared a little while longer and turned back to Megan, who was shaking her head and already walking over to the doorway.

“Cut the bullshit, Michael, we're trying to record. I told you to go look at the other bedroom.”

But Michael didn't respond. Megan was always skeptical of anything that happened, like I may have already mentioned, and Michael had been mischievous in previous times trying to scare us, but I must admit I felt a bit uneasy this time around. The silence was making me uncomfortable and I almost wanted to grab Megan by her arm and drag her back in before she left the room, but she stayed looking around the darkness outside, lost at what to do next, so she just looked back at me, her expression puzzled and unsure.

We decided to cut the scene short since there wasn't much to talk about here and went to regroup with the other two. When we arrived they were both looking up at a large framed portrait on one of the decrepit walls to the left of the large, half-destroyed bed. Before I could open my mouth Megan went off at Michael for his supposed prank, steadily approaching him. I half expected her to give him a well-deserved smack across the face.

“Stop acting like an infant Michael, I'm serious. You're wasting our time with your antics.”

“Woah, woah, what are you talking about boss?”

“Drop it already. We saw you walk past our room. We were recording, you know. That's one less scene for the episode and we're already running short on material from this bunch of nothingness.”

“Michael was with me the whole time,” Daniel joined in, “we went straight to this room and haven't moved since.”

“Oh, don't tell me you're in on it too. I expected it from him, but you're better than this, Daniel.”

Megan was just as stern and unconvinced as ever, but the looks of confusion on their faces made my stomach drop. I looked back towards the hallway, half-expecting to see someone or something just standing there menacingly, but it was just darkness beyond the doorway.

I wanted to join in with my two cents, but Megan drew everyone's attention back to what Michael and Daniel were just looking at. She let out a 'woah', and so did I when my eyes found their way to the portrait.

It was large, very large, visibly expensive, but it was also burned... most of it, anyway. The edges of the framing were blackened and four figures stood in view – a woman sitting in a red cushioned chair with what I think was a white wedding dress holding a bouquet of flowers in her lap. Her right shoulder and everything above it was burned away, so I couldn't see a face. On either side of her were two young girls, which I could only deduct from whatever remained of their figures – they were barely taller than the armrests of the chair, and I couldn't make out any part of their clothing, only that both of them wore a pair of white, fluffy sandals. The fourth figure stood out much more notably.

Behind the armchair with one hand reaching towards the girl on the right and the other pressed to his chest stood a tall man with greyish hair slicked back neatly wearing a white shirt and a dark blue buttoned vest over it. The man was clean shaven and his mouth formed a slight, welcoming smile, eyes looking right back at us.

This portrait was of the killer's family, and only Abraham hadn't been burned away. No, he was completely intact, while the rest of the painting was completely destroyed.

“How the hell does that happen? Why does it look like the fire never even touched him?” I asked, putting into words the question lingering in everyone's minds.

“Maybe it was coated in something that made it more resilient to the flames?” Daniel chimed in, looking at the three of us for approval.

“That's fucking stupid, Daniel.” Michael butted in with his invaluable input.

We stood there trying to make excuses for how the painting had survived when out of nowhere a loud, continuous crash interrupted our conversation and caused Megan to gasp. We all jumped and turned to face the corridor and realized where the sound was coming from – my equipment had fallen somehow, and judging by the sound, it made its way down all the way to the first floor.

“What the hell just happened?” Michael shrieked, I was sure he was one more noise away from curling up into a ball.

“Relax,” Megan readjusted herself and cleared her throat. “sounds like the equipment fell. It's nothing unusual, this place has been falling apart for over two hundred years now. Come on, let's get back to it and hope nothing's broken.”

Michael followed her like a dog does its owner out of the room as soon as she finished her sentence, but I stayed back for a few moments again, that feeling of dread and unease creeping back up after the sudden scare had started letting me go. Daniel and I exchanged a concerned look, and without a word between us I could feel he was just as unsure about this as I was, but we had no choice and we definitely didn't want to get separated from the other two.

We quickly caught up with Megan and Michael who were already going down the stairs after confirming basically all the equipment – bags, camera and everything else, took a sleigh ride to the floor below. For a very short time I was relieved to find out there was a reasonable explanation for what had happened, but I looked over the area where I'd left them and saw that no floorboard or beam had fallen that could have knocked them over.

Two or three minutes later, after we made sure nothing was broken or damaged beyond repair, I was ready to call it quits and get out of this creepy place, excited to never return, but Megan's next words felt like a bullet through the chest.

“Okay, the stairs to the second floor are too damaged to get there safely and the third floor is basically nonexistent anyway, just wood and rubble from what I saw outside, so we'll go check the basement out and then we wrap it up.”

“What did you just say?” My jaw was left hanging and the question came out more intense than I intended it to. She looked at me, eyebrows raised, and crossed her arms. Michael's shit-eating grin made the situation even worse.

“I said, we're going down to the basement. We barely have anything to get this episode out and we have a deadline, remember? And I'd try and be more civil if I were you.”

“I-- I'm sorry Megan, but with all this weird things that have happened? I don't like this one bit. Not one bit.”

“And I have a show to run,” she was quick to shut me down, “what's up with you three, we've been recording creepy places for how many years now, but a house over two centuries old falling apart is what gets you?”

“Yeah, grow a backbone.” Michael laughed and threw his hands towards me in a mocking manner. “You're just making everything worse than it really is 'cause you're scared. Nothing to be afraid of here... right boss?”

Daniel, like usual, was the only one to speak to me like I wasn't below him. He once again placed a hand on my shoulder and patted me on my back afterwards.

“Come on, let it go. We're in and out of that place in no more than ten minutes anyway, then we're going. Sounds good?”

No, it didn't sound good. But I was exhausted, defeated, and I needed to keep this job, so I had no choice but to follow Megan and Michael down the spiral stairway into the basement, Daniel following close behind me.

The shift in the atmosphere was immediate as we walked deeper and deeper down the stone stairs. The air was stuffy and cold, a shiver rattling my entire body as I took the final step down and turned on one of the two flashlights we'd grabbed from the bag. Megan had the other one and she'd already started looking around by the time I got down. The basement was decently spacious, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the wall at the other end where she was already shining the light at. A metal rod I assume served as the pyre for Abraham's sacrifices was elevated by a platform surrounded by bricks, and around it was a giant pentagram with various symbols I could not recognize carved into the floor all over it. No part of the basement was made of wood as I assume you already realized alone, otherwise the place would have burned down way before it did. There were old tables with dusty, torn tomes around them, instruments that looked terrifying and like their only purpose was to inflict pain, drawings on the walls and crude drawings of what I assumed to be religious scenes, or however you'd call ones about the Devil.

The three of them stood in awe at the sight, and though I was also intrigued I was too unnerved still to provide anything worthwhile to the conversation. Michael went to look at the tools while Daniel flipped through old pages of who-knows-what and Megan circled the pyre and looked at different parts of the pentagram.

“Okay, set up the camera quickly. We have to get as much out of this as we can, look for anything that might cause the viewers to ask questions.” Megan ordered swiftly, running over to Daniel and eyeing all the books. Michael's fascination with the tools he found disgusted me and I wanted to get out as fast as possible, so I obliged.

I set up everything in the middle of the basement, making sure to capture a part of the pentagram on the floor and the metal pyre in the back, with Megan standing slightly off-center to the right of the shot. She took a breath and began.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are standing right where the horrific sacrifices happened more than two hundred years ago. You can see the pyre behind me - the same one that claimed so many lives, the same one the last victim before he set the fire that burned down this mansion and put an end to the killing spree of Abraham the Hellbringer.”

A short history lesson later, Megan moved over to Daniel and his assortment of old books at one of the tables. I turned the camera to follow her, pulling at my shirt's collar in the meantime. Maybe it was the air here in the basement, but it was getting oddly hot.

“Daniel here has found a collection of old books likely belonging to Abraham, the contents of which he is about to...” She wiped a drop of sweat away from her forehead and ruined her hair while doing so, letting out an annoyed exhale. “Ugh, cut. We're starting over.”

“Why the hell is it so hot in here? You guys feel that?” Michael's voice cut through the disappointed silence and approached the three of us, and only then did we put more thought into that question. The chills we'd get through our bodies from time to time had suddenly been replaced by big enough heat to make all four of us sweat.

We stood silent, our eyes wandering from each other to the corners and walls of the basement, waiting, listening. We heard it.

Rustling. Crackling.

Smoke, coming down the stairway.

We couldn't believe it. An unspoken agreement fell between the four of us and we left all the equipment as it was, sprinting towards the stairs, but we were stopped in our tracks. From just around the corner we could hear something dragging itself across the steps, across the wall. A sound so terrible it made me physically sick hearing it.

We froze in our tracks, too terrified to speak or move. Moments later it appeared - a sinewy, charred arm with some fingers melted together slammed its palm into the wall, moving itself closer to us. Then a leg, the lower two bones visible and blackened towards the fleshy, rotten foot that stomped onto the platform with anger. Our yells of horror synchronized as the towering figure, at least two meters in height, emerged from the corner of the stairway. God, I shudder picturing it even now. A ghoul that by all means and laws of nature must not be moving, let alone stand as if it is alive.  
The face was the first thing that burned itself into my memory. That damned face. The eyes that lacked lashes, brows or eyelids, dead but filled with so much rage staring at us. The completely hairless head, the flesh charred and rotten and black, with the left side exposing a darkened skull. Its torso, like the rest of it, looked like it had just come out of an incinerator. The sternum was exposed, the right side of its ribcage along with it, some of its ribs black as coal and some missing altogether, guarding a void of nothing under it. The stomach and everything around it was covered in blisters and hanging flesh. Somehow this creature still produced sound - a screech so inhuman and primal I almost vomited at the mixture of that and the sight before me.

It continued its advance towards us, taking the next step down into the basement with only two more left.

My memory blanks out here for the next few seconds, and I wish that it was all just a horrible nightmare, but it wasn't, and I found myself bumping into the camera and knocking it down on the floor with me following it on the way down, my elbow taking the entire impact. The pain was so sharp I barely managed to keep myself from shutting my eyes, but my adrenaline was through the roof.

Megan and Michael were moving back slowly, of course the latter hiding behind her. On the other side Daniel broke free from his trance of horror and threw a book at the creature. It did nothing but make it produce another ungodly screech while it dragged its somehow functioning legs closer to us.

The heat had become unbearable at this point and the smoke was pouring in so fast it started getting difficult to breathe, a cough being produced by each of us without fail every time someone else did it first. The ghoul's eyes would fixate themselves on someone else constantly – nobody was sure who it was going after, and it was blocking our only way out. The fact we were on a timer before we choked to our death was another added terror to this horror.

I pushed through the pain and lifted myself up, grabbing the camera and hurling it with all my strength at the demon. In a way that should not have been possible given the state of it, its arms shot up with inhuman speed, catching it just as it was about to hit it, and the parts where it got hold of it **melted** at the touch.

My attempt to stagger it was no cause of concern for the ghoul and it finally made its advance towards one of us – Megan. It forced a raspy screech through its vocal cords, or whatever was left of them, and basically threw itself towards her. She was fast enough to duck to the side and avoid collision, but Michael behind her didn't.

As he attempted to move away, it crashed into his shoulder and sent both of them on the floor. He screamed and tried to get up as fast as he could but it reached out and grabbed his forearm. I'll never forget the sound of pure agony that escaped Michael's mouth as I watched him struggle to free himself.

Daniel in the meantime had ran and grabbed one of the tools – some kind of sharpened pliers, I think they were – and dug them into the arm of this thing. It let out another horrible sound and released its grip on Michael. The flesh on his forearm had been scorched so terribly I could see what looked like a sickening third degree burn. His wails were a mixture of pain and crying and Daniel helped him run towards the stairs.

I was again unable to move out of pure terror, watching the pliers melt inside the arm of that ghoul as its gaze fixated on me. That snapped me back to reality and I ran with the others, helping Megan up on the way. All of us could not stop ourselves from coughing the entire time by now and we struggled climbing the stairs.

I was the third to make it out of the basement, followed by Megan a few steps behind me with an honorable mention to that thing constantly vocalizing to remind us it was still coming. As we got back to the ground floor we were greeted by an inferno – a recreation of the fire that was thought to have ended everything – but now we know that it didn't.

The smoke and ashes were making it difficult not only to breathe, but to see as well. The only way out was forward through the main door, which was far enough to be completely obscured by everything around us. Wooden beams were falling left and right, fires were reaching out all around us as if desperately trying to make contact with somebody. Parts of the upper floor began bringing themselves down around us.

We shouted at each other to go, everyone holding a hand up to their mouth and nose in a desperate attempt to give ourselves more time as every second was invaluable. As Michael, Daniel and I ran together we heard Megan release a sound between a gasp and a cry, and we turned to see her on all fours trying to crawl forwards.

“I-- I can't breathe--” She struggled, trying to lift herself up again only to fall harder than last time, and behind her emerged the towering abomination again, looking at her like prey.

“Michael, get to the-- *cough* the door, you're wounded!” I shouted, and Daniel and I gave it our best to reach Megan before it did.

We were too slow.

Having gotten barely half way there, the creature stood over Megan and let its entire weight fall on her, crushing her under it as if she was a pillow. She screamed so loud, so pained – a sound I never thought could come out of a human being. Its torso was in full contact with her back and its forehead rested over her right shoulder, and that's where her skin began **sizzling** and her suffering became even louder. Tissue melted, flames sparked, and Megan reached out her left arm towards us weakly. I couldn't force myself to look her in the eyes.

Daniel continued his charge, but I knew it was too late to do anything to help. I dug my legs as hard as I could into the floor and grabbed him with both my arms, trying to pull him away despite his protests to continue forward. He kept telling me to let him go, to help her, to do anything, but I could only watch and try to save him and myself.

The creature lifted its head and turned to look at her, its left arm lifting and pressing down on her head. Her hair immediately began burning away until nothing was left and her skin started melting under the touch. That was not Megan anymore, that was a corpse whose attempts at getting out became weaker and weaker. By the end her arm had fallen to the floor, the parts of her skin that hadn't melted away were engulfed by flames and her soulless eyes stared at us even after she stopped moving.

It was a devastating scene, and after a final cry of despair Daniel gave up and turned to run with me, both of us supporting each other through our coughs and stumbles.

We reached Michael at the door, the walls falling around us, forcing us to dodge the flaming debris around us, and the three of us rammed it. It wouldn't open.

Through desperate bangs and kicks, we tried again and again to bust through it to no avail. I was barely keeping myself going by now, and so were the other two. Michael was reduced to tears and gave up, falling to the floor in a fit of coughing, clutching his forearm, but Daniel and I persevered.

In a moment that I could only describe as a miracle, a combined thrash of both our bodies against it made it fly open and we rolled down the stairs leading out, unable to recover our footing for a few seconds.

Once I got up, I looked back to find the ghoul looming over Michael and watching him. It reached down and spun him around by his side, no doubt leaving another excruciating burn on the poor boy. He screamed, or at least tried to, his voice so weak and hoarse by now he couldn't produce much of any kind of sound.

I watched him raise an arm at the creature in a last attempt to protect himself before another wooden beam fell from the ceiling straight towards him, impaling him through the mouth. His body spasmed and twitched, his arm dropping and he became completely motionless. I wanted to scream, to cry, but I couldn't.

Then just as Michael's life left him, that thing looked back up at us and opened its mouth so wide, releasing another disgusting shriek. I thought that this was the end, that we were not going to make it out of this place after getting so close.

But the fire raged on, consuming all that remained of this cursed estate. The walls gave in, the entire first floor collapsing on itself, and just as it took a step forward the smoke and falling debris made it take a step back and everything crashed down all at once.

Daniel and I were so weak by this point, but first by crawling and then by failed attempts at getting up and walking we made our way out the yard little by little, using the last of our strength to put as much distance between us and this demon and its cursed abode.

We managed to basically crawl our way back to the van, and when we got to it we leaned against its side, out of words as much as breath. I turned to face Daniel who was already looking at me, his gaze hollow and lost.

Yes, we got out. But I don't know how to continue living.
