Most of us have no way to comprehend the depths of physical pain that a person can endure. I’ve struggled and failed to understand the evolutionary or theological reasoning behind it. If you’ve never felt your body suffering at its absolute maximum, [I have no way of articulating what it was like to shove an ice pick through my own eye](https://redd.it/105n5zr). 

Through the shaking, the hurt, the *desecration* of my body, I remember one clear thought filtering through:

I would have sacrificed my mother, my children, anyone I’d ever loved, to end the white-hot horror burning through my face. If a gun were pointed at my head, I would have pulled the trigger without a second thought. 

If you believe that you wouldn’t offer the same concessions to Satan, you don’t understand yourself. 

I have no idea how long I screamed. After a certain point, I couldn’t remember anything from my life other than burning and agony. Eventually, I exhausted myself so thoroughly that I could only slump in the chair. The ice pick, wedged deeply in my eye socket, finally had the opportunity to slough through my head gristle. With a sound uncannily akin to strawberry jam squishing through infected toes, the tool dripped from my face with molasses-like slowness. I was too exhausted to react as it finally broke free from my sticky, coagulating blood and fell to the floor with all the grace and glory of an elephant’s bowel movement.

I didn’t have the strength to resist Dirty Santa as he stuffed gauze into my open wound before liberally applying medical tape. “Good thing you missed your blood vessels!” he croaked. “It’s only eye goop spilling down your face.” He pressed against my side as he worked. His erection was prominent.

Santa clapped his hands. “Oh *boy*, that was a FUN present. But now it’s time to play with the… GAS-O-LEEN!” he yelled while dancing.

“I’d like to switch,” Jerry gurgled.

Santa tapped his grimy beard with a fat finger. “HMMM. You picked it, so you can’t trade unless someone *else* wants your toy. I can allow that, but only if one of your little friendsies is willing to swap their choice!”

My lone remaining eye was too exhausted to close. I watched him look pleadingly at the blonde woman and college girl.

“Come on… yours might be worse,” he squeaked. 

“I’ll take my chances,” the blonde woman deadpanned. “I’m so sorry, but you’re stuck with the gasoline.”

Jerry wept. His sobs grew louder as Dirty Santa lifted the gasoline can and poured it over his flabby body. He took great care to rub it into Jerry’s ears, hair, and neck, using an almost loving touch as he made sure that every part of him would burn.

Prior to the ice pick, I would have been telling myself that this couldn’t happen. That the universe simply didn’t have the capacity to cause such great damage to one gentle soul.

Of course, that was before I’d been forced to pluck out my own eye. Now I understood that the world was composed of the kind of hopelessness that diminishes the specter of death. 

Jerry was crying openly as Santa shook the last of the gas can over his crotch. “Why are you doing this?” he wailed. 

Dirty Santa leaned close to his ear and smiled.

“Because.”

Then he scooped the lighter from the floor and flashed a bright smile. “Any last thoughts you’d like to share while you still have lips?”

“You could stop this now,” Jerry sobbed, “and it would be the best thing in my whole damn life.”

Dirty Santa turned his head to the side. “But I won’t.”

He flicked the lighter and dropped the flame.

The heat was so powerful that it was the only physical sensation I could feel through the eye pain. A few seconds later, though, Jerry’s screams hurt my ears badly enough that physical agony was attacking me in three different places.

It could have been nineteen minutes or thirteen seconds. Time lost all meaning as I listened to my friend scream until his cheeks and throat had dissolved too thoroughly to be loud. 

I knew that it was over when I heard the *thunk* of Jerry hitting the floor. I realized, in a distant sort of way, that it mean the fire had finally burned through his bonds. 

For a moment, everything was still.

Then a heavy, wet sack hit my thighs. I struggled to make sense of what my eye was seeing.

Have you ever observed a man without skin? The sight will creep into your head and take up residence, gluing to your memory as so much fried chicken-like gristle sticking to the inside of your greasy skull. 

“Please kill me,” the bone-and-sinew creature begged as he placed the ice pick in my hand.

What would you have done for a friend?

We all have our “limits.” Those are the boundaries we tell ourselves we can’t cross, because it gives the illusion of control. The reality is that every one of us is just a few steps away from racing across a line that we foolishly believed is out of reach.

I couldn’t reach very far with my bound wrists, so it was a messy affair. But once I got between his ribs, it was like putting a toothpick through cold Jell-O.

He died in my lap. His body stayed there. 

I didn’t have the energy to slide him to the floor. 

The body twitched a lot. 

“O-Kay-Doh-Kay!” Dirty Santa called. He danced a little jig. “Two presents left, and two people to share them!” He looked at the college girl. “You’re next! I’m not gonna lie, my favorite present hasn’t even been picked yet!”

That’s enough for now. I think my therapist is full of shit: the more I talk about it, the worse I feel. I don’t know if I’ll be able to exorcise this particular demon. 

I’ve taken four Valium, but it’s not enough. To be perfectly honest, the thought of an overdose just doesn’t scare me. 

I’ll finish the story if I wake up.
