For secrecy I am going to be giving our nicknames. I am Ace (m26) and my friends Jack (m29), Dubby (m27), Alex (m30), Rusto (m30), and Jolly (m29)   we all went out to the ocean near our city to do some fishing. I know  I said six of us went instead of five but it is because, I don't know who we all were. I will explain soon. Now, onto what happened.

We had been planning this trip for a while. We were going to head out to the ocean near our city that we all lived in or around. It was going to be fun especially since we all enjoyed each others company. We took a large rental with onboard roons out onto the water. The sky was cloudy but that gave use some shade. We planned to actually stay out on the water for a few days and so we brought a lot of supplies for a lot of fishing and eating. After catching some big catches, jack managed to catch a marlin, or we think it was. None of us are fish experts and his had a long nose but it did not seem to be a swordfish.

Anyways, we went to sleep and woke up all around the same time close to 9 am. Dubby felt like something was off but could not figure out what it was. Things seemed fine. Jack was checking on his catch in the cooler up on the deck while were all below, Alex and Rusto were getting more lines ready, and Jolly was sharing his jolliness with the fishes. 
Then, Dubby yelled out loud, "Who the fuck is not supposed to be here." We questioned him on what he meant and he told us, "I noticed something was wrong and I checked my daily log and everything and noticed that we only go things for five of us, we paid for this rental for five of us, and what's more is that we have only five rods."

 He spouted off more things that just made not much sense to me other than him trying to say there was only five of us and I actually started to believe him. The boat we rented put was made to house at max five people but I dont recall putting too many people in a on of the rooms. But if there were supposed to be five of us, then why are there six of us and how can he suspect one of our friends is not who they are. I mean I knew them. Wait, no. I know them a lot. 

Dubby kept spouting off nonsense but he started to seem in pain the more he went on. As he began to start foaming at the mouth, Jack ran towards him and held him up but still, Dubby kept ranting. Eventually he stopped but by then his eyes glossed over and we knew he was gone. Dubby was dead, and I did not believe he died naturally. He was still in his 20s and I knew him and his family history well enough that he should not have any sort of disorder. At least I dont believe he did. 

As Jack set down our deceased friend, he began to spout out loud that the person here who did not belong come forward and admit it but none of us stepped forward. We all seemed to be wary now. Alex said we should call the coastguard or head back to shore. That we could worry later and began approaching Jack. But instead, Jack pulled out a fillet knife and got ready to stab alex if he got closer. I could not believe this was happening. Sure someone extra may be here but this was not something we needed to do. I suggested we heed Alex's advice and head back since if we stayed out here too long, things may seem suspicious to authorities. Reluctantly, jack agreed and we turned the boat around to head back.

Jack mannes the steering wheel so he can be alone and keep calm. Meanwhile I stayed in one of the rooms with Alex and Rusto stayed with Jolly. This keeps us from fighting and possibly harming one another. Dubby's body was put in the on deck cooler instead of Jack's marlin which was gone. He must have moved it when he checked on it this morning. Alex asked me, "Do you think one of us is fake or should not be here?"

"Well, I seem to know everyone here but for one of us to sneak on and not say anything seems weird to me. Jack is not one for jokes but Dubby i- was known to do jokes. You tend to try and make things fun like Rusto, and Jolly is not so jolly a lot of the time."

"Hmm, well what if one of us is fake and is some sort of shapeshifter or can manipulate memories? Would that be why there is another person?"

I pondered on this a bit. Both me and Alex had a fascination with the supernatural and I always thought shapeshifters may exist but mind manipulators of whatever they may be sounded too farfetched for me. After more talking I noticed the boat was still and told Alex  we need to check on Jack.

As me and Alex went onto the deck, we found Jack, dead at the wheel foaming from the mouth. We saw Rusto and Jolly standing nearby and we asked what happened. Both said they wanted to get some fresh air and came to find Jack foaming from the mouth ranting thst we should not go home, that we must find the liar, that the liar must die.

As Rocko and Jolly move the body, I walk up to the steering console. The GPS shown that we were several miles farther out than before and it would take us another day to get back. I let everyone know of this but I said that should first figure out what happened to them both since they both died, ranting and foaming from the mouth. Jolly guessed that they may have been poisoned. It made sense since they did not seem to be I'll or feverish beforehand and died foaming from the mouth. However, that raised doubt and suspicion amongst us all since that would mean one of us poisoned them both and was as keeping it hidden. We decided to instead anchor down and sleep for the night. Each of us locked in separate areas.

 In the morning Dubby, Alex, Jolly and I inspected the bodies of Jack and Rusto. We had to figu- wait. Dubby should be dead and Rusto alive? Why is. Wait. Before my thoughts could clear Dubby stabs Alex in the gut and charges me and Rusto. He manages to slash Rusto in the throat and runs after me. I manage to head into the cabin and hide. I hear Dubby, or what I assume is some sort of mimic of Dubby, walk past the room I was in since I left the door open, he may have thought I went into a closed room. I hear movement above which may be Alex getting up. I  quietly look around and find Jolly's harpoon. I load it and prepare to fire. I see a figure enter the frame of the doorway and I ask who it is. The figure steps closer and I see that it is Alex. I relax a bit until I ask him, how are you not bleeding. If on queue, blood starts coming out of his gut and I fire believing he is the mimic. The harpoon fire with enough force to break through his head and pin both him and the mimic behind him into the wall. Both dead on hit. I head onto the deck and look to see that Jolly has succumbed to his bleeding. I begin to drive the boar back. Hopefully I can figure out what to do.


A day passes and me and Sam have made it back safely. I was afraid she would be harmed by the mimic that had claimed all of my friends but she managed to hide and stay safe. We would put our wedding on hold until the funerals can be settled. She suggested we hide the bodies until we get to shore and go from there. We did not want to cause issues for ourselves. I played the rent for the boat and a bit more for the damaged that were caused.

Still, to this day, 1 week after the trip, even after me and my now wife got married, I can not figure out who the mimic truly was. My wife says we may have all gotten to hot and gone a bit crazy, but to this day, I may never know.
