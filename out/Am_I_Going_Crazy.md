I thought I was being paranoid at first. Maybe it was the stress from work, or the late nights beginning to blur into one another. But it won't stop happening.

It started about 3 nights ago. I was at work, typing away on the computer, doing my usual routine while working the night shift when I noticed a shadow walk past the window. I turned towards the front doors, expecting to see a customer or co-worker, nothing. Just the closed doors and sounds of a monotonous jingle my boss is adamant will "make people feel cozy and stay longer". A few other creepy things happened throughout the night but nothing that seriously alarmed me, like the quick knock on the door, which I assumed was a group of teens, or the sounds of a car driving up and parking but no one came in. I checked the security cameras multiple times and there was nothing out of the ordinary. 

Yesterday I came in a bit later than my usual 9 pm clock-in, but I was hoping to chat with my coworker Sam about the supposed pranks. If anyone would hear me out, it was her. Sam was one of those people who would listen to anyone talk for hours and somehow always had the right thing to say. I already knew her answer for the most part, she'd say "It was probably just the old building settling" or tell me about how the forecast called for some serious wind. 

When I went to the front desk she wasn't there. I called out to her, thinking maybe she was in the back office and walked behind the counter. After she didnâ€™t call back I checked the office and bathroom for her, empty. I chalked it up to her having a sick day or leaving early. A little disappointed about not getting a chance to talk but relieved at the same time due to either Sam or the boss man turning off the jingle for today, so I started my routine. 

While sorting a pile of papers and humming, completely forgetting the previous night by now, I heard a creaking. Like someone wearing shoes too big for them trying to sneak through the halls. I peered down the hall but only saw the rows of old hotel doors, all vacant. As I was turning to go back to my seat the sound started again, quicker. Like the person was now running. I turned around and only caught a glimpse from my peripheral of a man turning down the end of the hall. I stood there, contemplating on if I should just go back to work or call the police. I don't know if it was my curiosity or the fact I didn't want to be held accountable for the damage this dude could make, but I started jogging down the hall and following after where I saw him run. After the first turn, I was essentially guessing where the man went, stopping every hall I turned down to listen for the creaking. This went on for around five minutes before I gave up and returned to my seat at the check-in desk, laughing at myself for thinking l could have stopped that guy even if I did find him.

Deciding to skip the paperwork for now, I started doing the cleaning part of my shift, just to get it out of the way. When I saw from the corner of my eye, the shadow was there again, like it was waiting for me to notice it. I decided against looking that way and kept doing my work, trying to shake off the unease creeping under my skin. A little bit later the shadow disappeared; my nerves, however, did not. The air hung still and dread started kicking in. I'm completely alone. No guests, no coworkers, no boss. Just me and whoever is wandering about. The realization of how vulnerable I am making my stomach drop. 

Quickly, I ran behind the counter, grabbed a pair of old scissors, and rushed into the back office, locking the door behind me. Gripping the scissors tightly against my chest, I slid down the door and sat on the ground. The security monitor's beeping, indicating movement, caught my attention. In the left corner of the monitor, I could see what looked like a man, standing in the lobby. The footage of the man was distorted and glitchy but from what I could make out, he was wearing a suit, some type of hat, and I think a cane. He turned his head and looked straight at the camera. His face now perfectly clear on the screen, showing a mangled mess with a large gash. 

Even though he was standing in the lobby, the office door started shaking. Banging is more like it, like someone was pounding on the door desperate to get in. To get to me.

With the fear coursing through my body, I yelled out, "GO AWAY!", over and over again until the banging stopped. The silence causing me to cry in relief. I realized my grip on the scissors was so tight, my knuckles turned white.

I had been so caught up in the moment that when the stupid song turned on, I screamed. The anxiety in my body deciding to make a permanent residence. I slowly got myself up off the floor and examined the screen one more time, just in case. When all was clear, I felt a bit better and walked out of the office back to my seat. No matter what, I had to finish that paperwork, or Mr. James would rip me a new one. He tends to overlook reasons and only see them as excuses, even in the event of a robbery one time; so I didn't feel entirely confident that he would understand this situation. 

Roughly an hour later, around 3 AM, there was a knock at the door. A pale man, in his mid-30s, with a slight limp, wearing a three-piece suit and fedora walked in. The smell of aftershave filling the air. 

He stopped in the middle of the lobby, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. As he exhaled he said, "I truly love this song."

He looked over at me, sitting behind the desk, and smiled. I could feel a vibration in my chest growing to my legs, like a warning to get out. I nervously smiled back and asked him, "How can I help you sir?", trying my best to mask the trembling in my voice. I didn't know for sure if he was the man from earlier but I'd rather be safe than sorry. He started walking over to me, the creaking of the floor adding to the creepiness. Now at the counter, he begins to tell me how he and his wife would listen to this song all the time as teenagers.

After he was done talking, he patted his hands on the polished wood and began looking around. When his eyes caught a cane leaning against the wall by the same hall I ran down earlier that night. 

"Ah!" He exclaimed, limping over to the beautifully carved piece of wood. "I thought I had left this here", He started walking towards the door, paused, looked back at me while halfway out, tipped his hat with a smile then left. 

I have no idea what to make of it all, but now I am terrified to come in for my shift tonight. Maybe I should go in and talk to Sam about it.
