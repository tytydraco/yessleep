I still see him. Everywhere I go.
That sick fucking smile.

We’d been searching for a missing kid for a couple of days. Last place anyone saw him was near the river, on the south side of town. A couple of hikers phoned dispatch and said they saw a small boy on the other side of the river, clothes tattered and torn.

I was on nights, so I got lumped into the search party.
Nothing crazy ever happens here. A couple of domestics, some home invasions, bar fights — that’s usually my night.
A search party didn’t seem too bad.

I took my squad car down the dirt roads behind the Jackson farm — the only man-made paths leading into the woods.
I was alone that night.
Or so I thought.

I set out on foot and made it pretty far out along the riverbank, sweeping the area with my flashlight.
Empty beer cans. Solo cups. Crumpled cigarette packs.
Nothing interesting.

I was making my way back to the truck when it hit me.

Something was wrong.
I could smell it in the air.
In the way the trees were swaying.

I damn near jumped out of my skin when I heard the snap of twigs, the rustle of leaves —
directly to my left.

That’s when I saw him.

A man.
Crouched over in the bushes.
Staring at me through long, knotted, greasy hair.

That sick fuck was smiling.

I wish I could tell you I did something different.
I really do.

But I froze.
No words in my throat.
That damn smile still pinned on his face.

My hands snapped down to my pistol, fumbling with the clasp on the holster.

He watched me fuck with it.
Just stood there.

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get my pistol out.

He didn’t move.
He didn’t flinch.
He just kept smiling.

Like he was inviting me to finally get it right.

He lifted one hand — slow, deliberate — and pointed at my holster.

His voice was low, almost patient, like he had all the time in the world.

“It’s not hard,” he said. “Both buttons. Together.”

I did what he said.

Hands shaking so bad I could barely feel the buttons.
I pressed them both.
Heard the click.

The gun finally came free.

But I never pointed it at him.
I didn’t even say anything.

I just stood there like an idiot, watching as he climbed out of the bush and came right up to me —
inches from my face.

That smile never gave up.

Then he leaned in.
Close enough that I could feel his breath against my cheek.

“You’ll never find him,” he whispered.

Calm.
Certain.
Like it wasn’t even a question.

He didn’t touch me.
Didn’t even look at me again.

He just turned — slow as anything — and started walking back into the trees.

I didn’t call for backup.
I didn’t chase after him.
I stood there, frozen in fear like a little boy.

I stumbled back to my truck.
Started it.
Drove away.

I didn’t stop.
Not until the trees were gone and the sun was bleeding over the fields.
Not until the woods — and everything inside them — were somewhere I could pretend didn’t exist.

It’s been months now.

I moved two towns over.
Switched precincts.
Bought a house with my fiancée.

Some days, my life almost feels normal.
I’ll go out fishing with the boys.
Help Mara in the garden.

But in those moments —
I’ll see him.

Submerged in the lake, smiling at me.
Crouched behind the rose bushes, hair slick with rain.
Always with that same fucking smile.

He disappears when I blink.

And I’ll never find him
