Before I begin the story ,I would like to say that this is a scary story but not entirely horror. And it has gore and violence so it's not meant to be fire everybody,it might be a little extreme but it's meant to be ,TREAT IT ONLY AS A STORY




Memoir of the Eternal Monarch

I was a nobody once. Just another nameless face in a rotting world. Nations schemed in shadows, alliances fractured Earth into power blocs, corruption siphoned trillions, drugs and addictions enslaved billions, false gods shackled minds, and weakness was glorified while strength was punished. Humanity was dying not with a bang, but with decay.

Then came the first choice, a whisper in my soul: Would you remain nothing, or would you become fire itself?

I chose fire. And in that moment, I was no longer man. I was Monarch — the Eternal Monarch.

My Power

My gift was absolute. I could summon fire without limit — not torches or sparks, but infinite fire. Blue flames hotter than the sun, purple fire that shimmered like divinity. Fire that could cut like lasers, incinerate armies, or gently flicker to light a candle. My will alone commanded it.

There was no “too much” for me — no limit. I could set Earth ablaze in a second, or ignite the heart of a single man. I could even feel the heat of every movement in the world, making me omnipotent in awareness.

And I was untouchable. My Reflex Law ensured anyone who even thought of killing me died instantly. If they spoke their intent, they died before the words left their lips. If they carried weapons against me, the weapons crumbled before reaching me. I was immortal, invincible, eternal.

The First Decrees

I began by cutting off the head of power. Nuclear plants, warheads, weapons of mass destruction — I destroyed them all. The mighty were humbled in an instant.

Kings were abolished. No crowns remained except mine. Presidents and Prime Ministers lived on only as administrators, not rulers. They served under me, their pride crushed, their power dissolved.

All alliances — NATO, BRICS, EU, OPEC, every last one — I dissolved within five hours. My decree was not a threat but a statement: All alliances are broken. Starland has only one banner: mine.

The armies of the world I cut to thirty percent of their size. No borders, no wars. Soldiers were turned into builders, doctors, engineers, and welfare workers. Tanks, jets, guns — destroyed. Armies existed not to kill, but to serve.

The Purges

Then came the purges.

First, religion. I destroyed every mosque and Mecca itself, for if there was another god, he would have stopped me. None did. Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism — I let their temples remain as empty monuments of history, but stripped them of worship. Humanity worshiped only truth: me.

Second, terrorists. I killed every radical, every extremist, every man who thought violence gave him divine purpose. They all died, erased in an instant.

Third, corruption. I declared: Corruption is worse than rape, worse than murder. Every corrupt official, every thief in government, every parasite who stole from the people — exploded at the very thought of betrayal. Overnight, trillions once stolen flowed back into humanity.

Fourth, drugs. Every dealer, every smuggler, every peddler of poison — I killed them all. Then I erased the products themselves: cocaine, heroin, meth, weed, tobacco, alcohol, every drug for recreation. Not a gram remained.

Addicts were given one chance: go to help centers, show the will to change, and live. Those who refused died in withdrawal. Weakness had no place in my world. Only those who fought to rise survived.

Finally, NSFW and filth. Every porn site, every OnlyFans, every corrupt corner of the internet was erased. Half of all games were destroyed, leaving only those of creativity, intelligence, and strategy. Entertainment was not forbidden, but purified. Humanity would not rot in dopamine slavery.

Africa’s Trial

But mercy alone breeds weakness. So I tested the world.

I evaporated every drop of fresh water in Africa. In days, thirst choked the continent. I had not punished them — I had tested them. Survive, adapt, innovate, or die.

Some cursed me. Some gave up. But others built technology, dug deeper, created systems, and endured. Those who survived earned my respect. They proved worthiness in fire.

The world understood then: I was not a ruler of comfort. I was a Monarch of trials.

The Order of Starland

I abolished nations. The world became one nation: Starland.

I built the Eye of Doom Room, a court of incorruptible judges loyal only to my values. Those who manipulated markets, hoarded wealth, or sought to exploit humanity were dragged before the Eye. Justice was swift and absolute.

I created my Eternal Channel, a news network only I could speak through. From my phone, at will, my voice reached every TV, every phone, every billboard. No subscription, no cost. The world listened whenever I spoke.

I decreed: From today, all corruption is treason against humanity. All weakness dies. Innovation and progress are the new gods.

And crime diminished. Rape, murder, theft — all became rare. But corruption? Corruption became unthinkable. Worse than any crime in human history.

Reforms

I rewired business.

A $1 medicine could no longer be sold for $100. That was an example — the rule applied to all industries. If a company made a product cheap and exploited people by inflating its price, I crushed them. But if they reinvested profits into research, they were rewarded. They could charge fifty percent more.

This created competition not in greed, but in innovation. Businesses raced to discover cures, to invent faster, to improve technology. Elites still became rich, but never at the expense of the sick or the poor.

I set the Trillion Dollar Rule: no one, no family, no corporation could hold more than one trillion in wealth. Any excess flowed back into Starland. Innovation thrived. Exploitation died.

Humanity Reborn

I turned to the root: birth itself.

I decreed: Sperms destined to create children with less than 110 IQ shall be destroyed before conception. Mediocrity would never again be born. Every child was guaranteed intelligence, strength, potential.

I capped families at three children after humanity recovered to five billion. No overcrowding. No collapse. Every birth was precious, every child a gift to humanity, not a burden.

Families rejoiced, for they no longer feared raising dull or broken children. They were proud. Smart people gave birth to smart people. Humanity itself was reborn.


---

The Final Age

With armies turned to builders, defense budgets turned to research, corruption dead, addiction gone, and weakness erased — the world flourished.

Cities glowed with innovation. Families thrived in strength. Companies respected people, for exploitation was suicide. Children grew with fire in their eyes, destined to invent and lead.

Starland had no rivals, no chaos, no enemies. It was perfect, eternal, divine.

The End

And then came my end.

I had built the Final Order. Humanity no longer rotted. They ascended, slowly but surely, toward the stars. I had nothing left to purge.

So I chose my own death.

I rose into the sky above the world, laughing. Laughing at kings, priests, tyrants, and rebels — none had survived me. None had killed me. Only I could end me.

And so I burned. My body erupted into blue and purple fire, a beauty the world had never seen. I consumed myself, leaving nothing behind. No corpse. No ashes. Only light.

Below me, the people wept. Not from fear, but grief. At last, they understood. Every purge, every law, every harsh decree had not been cruelty — it had been love. I had carried the burden of being hated, so that humanity could be perfected.

They promised: We will never corrupt. We will never weaken. We will carry his flame forever.

And as my soul drifted beyond the stars, I was at peace.

I had done what no god, no king, no man had ever done.
I had built the Final Order.
I was, and always will be, the Eternal Monarch.
