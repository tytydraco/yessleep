Encounter with skinwalker PART-2 

Part-1 ----> https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/2tYwFTZR5t


As we entered the base, I swear I heard my name—distorted, but still unmistakably Ben’s voice. I brushed it off, thinking it was just my mind playing tricks on me. PTSD and anxiety, I told myself. I had dinner at the base, but my thoughts kept circling back to him.

“Robin… Robin.”
I woke up with a start. Sofiya was patting my back.
“Wake up,” she said. “What’s going on? You look so stressed.”

“I don’t know,” I replied, rubbing my eyes.

“Is it Ben? Did you have a nightmare about him?” she asked, her voice soft but probing.

“No, no, not Ben. Just... my past life,” I said, trying to sound casual.

“Alright, well, shake it off. It’s our turn to patrol,” she said, checking her watch.

“What time is it?” I asked, still groggy.

“2:30 a.m. Get ready in 30 minutes,” she replied.

Dragging myself out of bed, I got dressed and tried to clear my head. The whispers, the voice… it’s just in my head, I told myself. There’s no such thing as ghouls or Skinwalkers. They’re just myths.

“I’m ready,” I said as I grabbed my gear. “Let’s hit the locker room and gear up.”
“Alright, let’s go,” Sofiya said, adjusting her suit as we headed out.

The cold air hit us as we walked to the patrolling station. The distant growl of wolves echoed in the night, adding to the eerie silence. The stars and moon were bright, but they did little to chase away the unease in my chest.

“So,” I said, trying to distract myself, “why don’t you tell me about your life? Where’d you grow up?”
“Well,” she began, glancing through her binoculars, “I’m from Austin, Texas. Spent most of my childhood there, but then moved to Wyoming. I took this job because, well, I’ve always loved nature.”

“What about you?” she asked, turning the question back on me. “Why’d you take this job?”
“I was a fire lookout here,” I said. “Then, about five years ago, I saw an opening and thought, why not?”

Sofiya scanned the area through her thermal camera and suddenly froze.
“What’s that?” she asked, her tone uneasy.
I grabbed my rifle and followed her gaze. “Where?”

“There,” she said, handing me the thermal camera. I looked through it and saw... something.
“Looks like a deer,” I said, though I wasn’t convinced.
“Fire a warning shot. If it’s an animal, it’ll run,” Sofiya said, keeping her calm.

I took aim and fired a few rounds. The figure darted off into the trees.
“Guess it was just a deer,” I said, lowering my rifle.

**Two days later, 3:45am**

“Hey, Sofiya, what’s that?” I asked, my voice shaking.

She looked through the thermal camera, her face going pale.

“I... I don’t know,” she said. “It’s showing up cold, but... it’s human-shaped.”

My blood ran cold. “No way.”

“What? Do you know what this is?” she asked.

I hesitated. “It... it looks like Ben.”

She turned to me sharply. “Robin, that’s not Ben. It can’t be. Whatever this is, we follow protocol and take it out.”

I couldn’t move. My hands were frozen on the rifle. “What if he found his way back? What if it’s really him?” I whispered.

“Shoot it, Robin!” Sofiya yelled.

I shook my head. “No, I... I can’t. What if—”

The crack of a rifle shot interrupted me. My head snapped toward Sofiya. She was steady, her rifle still aimed at the figure.

“I’m sorry, Robin,” she said quietly, lowering her gun. “But whatever that thing was... it wasn’t Ben.”

 I stared at the screen, the thermal camera showing nothing but a cold, empty shape where Ben's figure once was. My mind was racing. I had seen humans on this camera before. The heat of their bodies always stood out, warm and alive, unmistakable against the background. But this... this was different.

It was like nothing I had ever seen. The figure was cold, darker than anything alive. My gut twisted, and a chill ran down my spine. How could it be him? Was it even really him?

I wiped my forehead with my sleeve, feeling the sweat drip from the tension. My hands were shaking, but I still couldn't pull the trigger. How could I?

"I'm sorry, Sofiya," I muttered, my voice shaky. "I know... I know you were right. But it just feels wrong."

She stood there, arms crossed, her face unreadable.

"Yeah," she said quietly, almost like she felt the weight of the situation too. "I get it. But you saw what it was. That wasn’t Ben."

I looked down, unable to make eye contact. The whole night felt off now. It was like we weren’t alone anymore, like something was watching us, waiting...

The hours dragged on, and the unease settled in like a heavy fog. The clock clicked past 4:00AM
We hadn’t spoken much since the shot. The forest felt still, too still. There was a strange, lingering heaviness in the air, and it wasn’t just the chill.

I scanned the thermal camera again, my finger trembling over the controls. The screen flickered for a second, and then—

"What the hell...?" I whispered.

More figures. At least three or four of them, moving around like shadows in the woods. And they weren’t animals—those weren’t heat signatures of deer or elk. These were humans.
But how?

Sofiya leaned over and took the camera from my hands, her eyes narrowing.

"More of them," she muttered. "This is getting worse, Robin."

I couldn’t believe it. More of them? How were they moving around without making a sound? And why were they so cold on the thermal camera?

"Are they... are they human?" I asked, my throat tight with disbelief.

"I don’t know, but they sure as hell aren’t animals," Sofiya replied, her voice low and tense. "And whatever they are, they’re getting closer."

I adjusted the camera, trying to get a better angle, but every time I focused on one of them, it was like they were vanishing into the night.

Then came a sound—soft at first, like whispers, then louder, almost a chorus, calling out. I froze.
"Robin...?" Sofiya’s voice broke through the tension, but I barely heard her. My eyes were glued to the screen now. 

More shapes. More shadows. They were closing in.

Just as I was trying to process what was happening, the silence was shattered by a loud bang from the inside of the base. It sounded like a door slamming.

Both of us whipped around, startled, but no one was there. Our colleague, Mark, was supposed to be asleep inside. He had been napping in the bunk room earlier—his absence now was impossible to ignore.

I took a step toward the entrance, heart pounding. Something was wrong. The door was ajar, but Mark... Mark was nowhere to be found. There was no sign of him. The bunk was empty, but the blankets were still warm.

"Sofiya," I whispered, voice trembling. "Mark's gone."

Her face went pale as she slowly walked toward the door, looking inside the room. There was no trace of him—no sign that he had left on his own.
"This doesn’t make sense," Sofiya said, her voice low, almost a whisper. "He couldn’t have just disappeared."

I couldn’t explain it. Mark had been inside the whole time. We hadn’t heard him leave. But now, he was gone, like he had never been there at all.
Another hour passed, and now the cold was almost unbearable.

I could feel it deep in my bones—the pressure of being watched. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of twigs made my heart race. It wasn’t the normal wildlife, it wasn’t the forest. It was something else... something waiting for the right moment.
Sofiya’s voice cut through the silence again.
"Robin... we need to move. Now.”

I nodded, feeling a lump in my throat. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Something was moving around us, slipping between the trees, following us. Every instinct told me to run, but I couldn't leave without knowing what the hell was happening.

**5:30AM**

By the time we reached the jeep, the shapes had all but disappeared, melting back into the dark woods. But we both knew... we weren't out of the woods yet

I grabbed my rifle, the cold metal heavy in my hands. There was no more hesitation. Whatever these things were, they weren’t just going to stand there and watch us walk away.

“I’m going to kill any of those things that get too close,” I said, my voice cold and determined. “I’ll clear the way. You focus on driving, Sofiya. Don’t stop for anything.”

She didn’t even look at me, her hands tight on the steering wheel, eyes locked ahead as she revved the engine.

“Got it,” Sofiya said, her voice steady. “Just don’t do anything reckless.”

I nodded and adjusted my grip on the gun, heart pounding. The truck roared to life as Sofiya sped off, tires kicking up gravel. The world outside was a blur of shadows, but I could see them now—shapes darting through the trees, moving so fast I almost thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. But no, they were real. Real and closing in.
I peered out the side window, scanning the darkened forest. There they were. More of them. The cold figures, just like before. They were everywhere.

“There!” I shouted, pointing toward the woods. “They’re coming out of the trees! Get ready!”
Sofiya didn’t flinch, didn’t even slow down. She kept her eyes focused on the road, her hands gripping the wheel tighter as she pushed the pedal to the metal.

I fired the first shot. A clean hit. One of them dropped, the sound of the bullet piercing its body echoing in the night. But more kept coming. There was no end to them.

My gunshots rang out like thunder in the silence of the forest. One after another, I picked off the creatures as they tried to rush us. But there were too many, and they kept appearing from all sides, like they were materializing from the shadows themselves.

“I’m running low on ammo!” I shouted over the sound of gunfire.

“Keep going, just keep firing!” Sofiya shouted back, her eyes focused on the road. “We’re almost there!”

But it felt like an eternity. The road ahead seemed endless, the headlights cutting through the darkness but revealing nothing but more trees and more of those creatures lurking in the shadows.

I shot again, another one down. But for every one I took out, two more appeared. It was like a damn nightmare I couldn’t escape from. Each shot felt like it was taking forever to hit its mark.

I glanced at Sofiya. She hadn’t said a word, hadn’t even flinched. She was fully in control, her attention entirely on the road. It was as if she was trying to outrun the terror behind us. But even she couldn’t make the exit come any faster.

The truck roared as it tore through the dark woods, but with every passing second, it felt like the creatures were getting closer. There was no escape. No way out. And no matter how many of them I took down, it didn’t seem to make a dent.
I fired again, my heart racing, but still... still, they came.

The last creature fell, my rifle smoking from the relentless shots. My hands trembled as I lowered the gun, eyes scanning the dark forest for any signs of movement. For the first time in what felt like hours, there was nothing. Just silence.

Sofiya’s voice broke through the quiet.
“Are… are they gone?”

“I think so,” I said, my voice hoarse from shouting. I kept the rifle in my lap, unwilling to let it go just yet. My eyes lingered on the treeline, waiting for any hint of those cold, lifeless figures to emerge again.

We drove forward, the forest thinning as the moonlight revealed the faint outline of buildings in the distance.

Finally, they had escaped the forest’s grip.

The small town felt like a sanctuary, its quiet streets bathed in the pale light of dawn. Sofiya let out a shaky breath and slumped in the passenger seat.

“I can’t believe we made it,” she whispered.

I nodded, taking the driver’s seat as she slid over. The adrenaline that had kept us alive was fading, replaced by exhaustion. As I drove into town, Sofiya leaned her head against my shoulder, her breathing softening as sleep took over.

I didn’t wake her. She’d earned this rest. We both had.

The sun was high in the sky by the time we found a thrift shop. The smell of dust and old fabric filled the air as we stepped inside. Our uniforms, covered in dirt and blood, practically screamed for attention, so we traded them for some casual clothes—a pair of jeans and flannel shirts. Anything to blend in and avoid standing out.

“This will do,” Sofiya said, running her fingers through her hair to smooth it out.

“Yeah,” I replied, tugging at the sleeves of my shirt. But no matter how much we cleaned up, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were still being watched.

The motel was small and unassuming, its neon vacancy sign flickering faintly. We paid cash and got a room with two beds. It wasn’t much, but it was shelter.

Sofiya threw herself onto the bed closest to the window, her eyes already heavy.
“Wake me if anything happens,” she murmured before sleep claimed her again.

I sat on the edge of my bed, staring at the ceiling. The events of the past few days played over and over in my mind. But as night fell, the strange silence of the motel began to gnaw at me.

I glanced out the window. Not a soul in sight. The streets were empty. Too empty.

Then, I heard it.

Footsteps.

They came from upstairs, slow and deliberate, echoing down through the ceiling.

I froze, every muscle in my body tensing. There wasn’t supposed to be anyone else here. We were the only guests.

“Sofiya,” I whispered, shaking her awake.

“Huh? What is it?” she asked groggily, rubbing her eyes.

“Do you hear that?”

She sat up, listening. The footsteps continued, now moving closer to the stairs.

“What the hell?” she muttered, her voice laced with unease.

I gripped the rifle I’d brought from the truck, my eyes darting to the door. The footsteps stopped. The silence was deafening.

That night, sleep didn’t come easily. When it finally did, it came with nightmares.

Ben was there, his face pale and cold, his voice distorted. He stood in the forest, calling my name. Over and over again.

“Robin… Robin…”

I woke with a start, my chest heaving, sweat soaking my shirt. Sofiya was sitting by the window, her rifle in her lap, her eyes scanning the empty streets.

“You okay?” she asked without turning around.

“No,” I admitted, my voice barely a whisper. The image of Ben’s lifeless face was still burned into my mind.
Sofiya groaned but sat up, giving him a weak, tired smile. “Yeah… let’s go.”

They packed their things in silence and stepped into the dim motel hallway. The air felt colder, unnaturally so, and a flickering bulb cast eerie shadows along the cracked walls. Reaching the front desk, they found it empty, coated in a thin layer of dust, as though it hadn’t been used in weeks.

“Where is everyone?” Sofiya murmured, uneasy.

“No idea,” Robin replied, scanning the room. “But I want to report those footsteps from last night.”

Just as Robin was about to give up, a man emerged from a back room. He was tall and gaunt, his pale skin stretched too tightly over his face. His movements were stiff, almost robotic.

“Can I… help you?” the man asked in a voice that sounded oddly layered, as though two people were speaking at once.

Robin and Sofiya exchanged uneasy glances. Something about him felt… wrong.

“Yes,” Robin began cautiously. “We heard footsteps above us last night, but it seemed like no one was there.”

The man tilted his head unnaturally, the bones in his neck cracking audibly. “I see. I’ll… look into it,” he said, his lips curling into an unsettling smile.

Robin shifted nervously. “Right. We’ll just pay and leave.”

Sofiya handed over some cash, but when the man’s cold, clammy hand brushed hers, she flinched. His head jerked to the side as his smile widened grotesquely. Robin’s instincts screamed danger.

“Sofiya, step back,” he whispered, reaching for his gun.

Before they could react, the man’s body began twisting unnaturally. His face contorted, his mouth stretching into a gaping maw lined with jagged teeth. His eyes turned black as tar.

Robin fired, the gunshot echoing through the empty lobby. The creature shrieked and lunged, moving impossibly fast. Robin grabbed Sofiya and shoved her behind him, firing repeatedly, but the creature kept coming.

From the corners of the room, more figures appeared—pale, distorted, and utterly inhuman. Skinwalkers.

“Robin, we have to get out of here!” Sofiya screamed.

“I’ll cover you! Go to the car!” he shouted, his voice tight with panic.

Sofiya hesitated for a split second before bolting for the door. Robin followed, firing at the creatures as they closed in. They barely made it to the car, slamming the doors just as one lunged at them.

Sofiya fumbled with the keys, shaking, but managed to start the engine. The car screeched down the empty road as the creatures gave chase, their pale forms illuminated by the headlights.

After what felt like hours, the creatures finally stopped. Robin lowered his gun and leaned back in his seat, trembling. Sofiya gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white, tears streaming silently down her cheeks.

They drove to a small, quiet town. When they finally stopped, Sofiya slumped against Robin’s shoulder, her exhaustion overtaking her. He let her rest, staring out the window, lost in thought.

Later that night, they checked into a new motel and bought plain clothes to replace their uniforms, hoping to avoid being noticed. The motel was eerily quiet, and as they lay in bed, Robin heard it again—faint footsteps from above.

He sat up, his heart pounding. Sofiya was already awake, staring at him with wide, terrified eyes.

“Did you hear that?” she whispered.

Robin nodded, his throat dry. The footsteps grew louder, closer.

“Sofiya… stay here,” he muttered, gripping his gun.

But before he could move, the sound stopped. Robin stared into the darkness, his breath shallow. That night, as sleep overtook him, he dreamed of Ben again—his voice echoing, calling his name from the shadows.

And somewhere in the motel, something was waiting.
