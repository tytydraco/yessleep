I was nine years old when it happened. It's very clear in my mind that I was coming back from the kitchen, having gotten myself a glass of milk. I was supposed to have been in bed for a while already, but then, there was no one around to make me. Dad was on the graveyard shift as a security guard, and mom was long enough gone that I couldn't really remember her any more. With no money for a babysitter, things were as they were.

On the way back to the living room, I passed the door to the basement. It was open, with a cold draft creeping up. I paused, looking at it. There was only a naked concrete cell down there, used for storage, and the door should have been shut. Had been, when I went to the kitchen. I would have noticed immediately if it wasn't.

Like I noticed now.

Strange. But then, the door could have slipped open somehow. I reached out to close it.

“Get down here, Jake.”

It was my fathers voice, floating up to me. He must be down there clearing out some junk, or maybe looking for something. He wanted me to help him. I'd actually put my foot on the first step of the stairs before I realised how none of this made any sense. Dad wouldn't be home for several hours and I'd have heard it if he came in early. Hell, he'd have clobbered me for being up so late. Besides, why hadn't he turned on the lights?

It was so dark down there, with the light from the hallway barely edging past the foot of the stairs. All I could make out were the dim shapes of cardboard boxes, jumbled and stacked in precarious towers. And...in a corner, there was maybe something else. A shape darker than the gloom surrounding it.

“Dad?” I was reaching for the light-switch even as I spoke, and a second later the halogen glow of the ceiling lights dispelled the murk for an instant, before, with a crack, the bulb burned out. Darkness rushed back in, all the more impenetrable, but leaving me with a series of contradictory imaged burned across my retinas.

The shape in the corner was only my fathers old coat hung up on a nail, part of me insisted. Meanwhile, some other part couldn't believe that. That terrified piece of my mind told me the shape had moved slightly, just before the lights went on, and again, just as they went out. It told me I'd caught a glimpse of something else too, something like a pale and grinning face staring up at me.

I crashed the door shut, and, retreating on instinct with no real thought or plan, barricaded myself in the bathroom. There I crouched on the cold tiles, nauseous with anticipation of what must surely be coming for me.

Yet, nothing happened. It began to dawn on me that if it had been my father in the basement, I might be in bigger trouble for slamming the door on him than if it really was something else down there. The thought made me grin despite myself, though looking back now I guess it wasn't all that funny.

Little by little, I began to calm down all the same. I don't know why I'd picked the bathroom to be my bunker, but I could have done a lot worse. With my adrenaline fading, I was starting to feel just how the fear had twisted my stomach in loops and knots. As it turned out, it was a very good thing I had a toilet to hand. I even felt a lot better, afterwards.

Once I had mostly settled myself, it didn't take me long to begin doubting what had happened. Maybe I'd imagined it? Shadows and a glint of reflected light, with my imagination filling in the rest?

As for the voice, the TV had been on. I just thought it came from the basement because the door had been open. Maybe.

Still, I stayed in the bathroom for a good while that night. I couldn't shake the idea that there was something out there, something that had padded softly up the stairs in the wake of my flight, and now stood silently on the other side of the door.

Waiting.

When I finally mustered the courage to venture out, there was nothing there. The basement door was still closed, and though nervous, I even managed to settle down on the couch and finish whatever movie I'd been watching.

I ended up falling asleep on the couch that night. Even though the living room was nearer to the basement, it somehow felt safer than my bedroom. Perhaps because the couch was so low to the ground, nothing could have hidden beneath it.

Just like in the bathroom when I'd had the idea that there was something on the other side of the door, there was a thought in my head now that the same something was waiting for me under my bed. Try as I might, I just couldn't put the notion away, even though at this point I had mostly convinced myself that there really was nothing to be scared of.

So on the couch I was, and on the couch I stayed. I was not woken when my dad finally got home. It meant he must have had a few beers on the way, and stumbled off to his bed without noticing that I was not in mine. It was a small mercy at least, not to get in trouble. In any case, he snored his way long into the next afternoon.

For a while after, things kept on as normal. A week went by, then two, then three, but there was no repetition of that night. I was very jumpy, glancing towards the basement door whenever I heard the creak of timber settling or any other of those little noises which, ours being such an old house, there were always plenty of. But you can't stay keyed up forever. Eventually you calm down.

So it was just when I had come to believe it was over, that it happened again.

My dads favourite team was playing an important match, and so, he camped out in front of the TV. He got drunker and drunker and louder and louder, watching with frustration turning to rage as his heroes stubbornly kept on losing. I was in charge of bringing him more beer whenever he called out for me. Once he had enough under his belt that he stopped paying attention to whether they were cold or not, I just brought in a final six-pack, plopped it on the table, and crept off to my room for the night.

I suppose I must have been worn out, because I fell asleep almost the instant my head hit the pillow. Then, with what seemed like equal rapidity, I woke up again.

It was a strange sensation. I had been dreaming something pleasant and far away, then all of a sudden I was back in my bedroom, sitting bolt upright, my hearth as wild as a bird panicking in its cage.

It was some premotion of danger that had penetrated into my sleep and jolted me awake. I sat very still, listening. The room was dark, curtains drawn. Only a thin stream of light was showing from where the door was slightly ajar. The house was quiet.

I strained with every sense for something being amiss. Still there was nothing. Except...

A floorboard creaked outside my door. “Dad?”, I asked. There was no response. Slowly, hesitantly, I repeated myself. After a moment, there was a soft noise like the exhalation of long held breath.

“It's fine,” my fathers voice said. “Don't worry.”

There was another creak, and this time it was hinges, not floorboard. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, my door was being pushed open. I was frozen, unable to move. Through the crack I could see a dark shape like that of a man, hunched over but still so much larger than myself.

The door swung wide.

The thing that came shuffling in wore a face like that of my father, but corpse pale and rigid. The mouth curved in a frozen grin, the eyes stared at nothing. It crept forwards almost timidly, moving as if unfamiliar with the operation of its own limbs.

“No,” I whispered, pathetic, pleading. The word seemed to shatter something. As if a dam had burst, the thing rushed forward. It was on me, slobbering, grabbing, swelling up with some excess of sudden force. I kicked, I punched, tried to crawl from the bed, got tangled in the sheets, ended up under them. Screamed.

There was an almighty clatter from downstairs. Plausibly, man waking from slumber in armchair. Shin banged on coffee table. Tower of beer cans knocked over.

I tore the sheets off me, looked wildly around. There was nothing in my room. The door stood open.

I did not go back to sleep that night. In the following days, I lived as if under siege, barricading myself in my room as soon as it began to get dark, my dresser pushed in front of the door, pissing in an empty soda bottle to avoid having to leave. All the while just waiting for the inevitable.

I entertained fantasies of running away, though with no clear idea of where I'd go or what I'd do. Maybe I still would have gone despite that, but before I could lay any real plans, dad got a promotion.

It was the big break he'd been waiting for. Supervisor, or something. Whatever it entailed, he could afford an apartment in town to do away with the endless commute.

It didn't take us long to pack up what was needed. Most of the bigger stuff, the furniture, all belonged to the house. And then we were gone.

Looking back, the new apartment was no great shakes. There was a damp patch on the wall beneath my window, and the pipes would clog once a month. But it had one thing going for it.

You see, our old house had been a long way off from our neighbours. I knew from experience you could scream your head off without anyone taking the slightest notice. Here, there where people everywhere. We were surrounded by them, above, below, either side, and oh, how the walls were paper thin. Anyone could hear anything anyone did.

It felt safe.

Of course I still worried that something had somehow come with with us, folded away in some suitcase just waiting to spring out a like a jack-in-the-box. But I couldn't really believe it. This felt like such a clean break. Whatever had happened in the house, belonged to the house. It was gone, in the past, done with. In this new place, with its new rules, there was simply no room for it.

Time passed. Days became weeks, and months and years. We never lived like kings, but everything, the good and the bad, was of the normal kind. I grew up. On my 18^(th) birthday I moved out, working retail to pay for a bedroom in an apartment I shared with five other people, with one bathroom to go around.

Dad had officially become a drunk. He could still hold down his job, but it only took a few years for that to cease being the case. I guess with me out of the way, he didn't see any reason in trying to restrain himself any more. It came as a shock to me, the notion that he had actually been trying.

Life went on. I learned a trade, got a decent job and a small place of my own. Things got good.

Dad got worse. He went to rehab, relapsed, repeated the process. Finally, there was no more candle left for him to burn. I was thirty-two the last time I saw him.

I am thirty-two now.

We buried him yesterday.

And I remembered. I'd really managed to forget about it by now, you see, the things that happened back in the old house. Or not forget, exactly. It was more that I'd papered over the memories with a story I'd made up, of how things had been instead. I could hide it all away like that, and keep from ever having to really think about it.

It was the viewing that brought it all back. The corpse was displayed in an open casket, and as I stood there looking at it, feeling very little of anything at all, I saw it. The face. Cold and pale. Perhaps the muscles had stiffened or the skin begun to dry, or something else entirely, but whatever it was, some part of the process had tugged up the corners of the mouth.

It was the same inhuman mask I had seen in the basement that night before the bulb burned out. I had seen it again in my bedroom.

Just like that, my careful illusions cracked like a sheet of ice to plunge me into the freezing water beneath. Hideously, the knowing was somehow worse now that I was grown up. What my childish mind had been able to cave into pieces and put away was too big, too real for my adult mind to handle.

I fled, knowing flight was fruitless but going anyway, blindly, back to my suburb house in which I lived, all alone. I sat in my living room, whiskey bottle on the coffee table. I drank. Outside, it had gotten dark.

Floorboards creaked in the hallway.

“Go away,” I whispered. “It's not real. You didn't happen.”

A wet chuckle like pipes gurgling.

“Shouldn't have left. Could have been all...over with."

I reached for the bottle, found it was empty. Felt tears in my eyes. “Leave me alone.”

“*Years* now of what you've got coming to you. Saved up. Worse than you think.”

Silence stretched out. Became unbearable. I had to look.

I turned. There was nothing there.

But I know there will be. I need to have this written down before then. Structure it, make sense of it. Lay it out and make all the pieces fit together. This seems like as good a place as any to put it.

Of course it won't make any difference. Just the illusion of control. Soon, in the dark, in the night, there will be a noise, and I will wake to see that face grinning down at me.
