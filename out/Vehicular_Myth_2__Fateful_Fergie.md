Here are some modern accounts of sightings of fateful fergie

&#x200B;

'I was driving my tractor across the field after a night of farming, it was dark and somewhat foggy, when suddenly an old looking red tractor appeared in front of mine and we collided, there was no one driving the red tractor, it just looked like it had been misplaced, thinking it was stolen i ran off to get someone, but as i walked down the field something else took my attention, the cows had broken out and littered the field ahead of me, when i walked back to my tractor, the little red one had gone, i think this was a visitation of fateful fergie to save my cows from a horrific accident'

&#x200B;

'I don't know if anyone will believe me, but i think i saw the mythical fateful fergie tractor, i'm just an apprentice and i made a big mistake, i hopped out of the tractor with the parking brake off, it was facing downhill and i had my back to the front of it, i heard a loud clank behind me and i looked round to see my tractor had rolled and hit a mysterious red ferguson, i got back into my tractor to reverse and survey the damage, when i realized i had left the brake off, when i looked down to engage it before getting out again, i looked up and the red fergie was gone, to this day i like to believe fateful fergie saved my life, but no one else on the farm believes me'

&#x200B;

'I was operating a forklift to move bales of hay from one barn to another, working quickly because a weather front was moving in that threatened thunderstorms, as i drove the first bale to it's new barn i noticed a little old red tractor, like a fergie, was blocking the barn door, i got down from the forklift and asked around if anyone had a red ferguson, none of them did, and when i went back to show them, it was gone, by the time i could continue work, a light rain was falling and thunder made itself known, i decided to do the work the day after, was this the fateful fergie and if so, was i going to have a forklift accident that day?'

&#x200B;

'One night i was harrassed by what i believe to be fateful fergie, an old fashioned red tractor harrased me as i did my work, driving in front of me and even blocking gates, i decided to leave it for the night, but what would have happened if ignored fateful fergie?'

Unlike the previously mentioned jagshee, the fateful fergie is known only for divine intervention and not as a bad omen, it is believed to be bad luck among farmers to ignore a fateful fergie visitation, but in some cases the tractor has been known to do all it can to prevent the farmer from continuing their work.

&#x200B;

Some reports of the fateful fergie claim to be watched from a distance by the tractor, often when they were learning the trade, one such report from a farmer with initials K.C claimed they were continously watched by a fateful fergie for years and that 'only when my apprentice J.C turned up, do i see the fateful fergie again, watching over J.C instead on our english farm' the bigger mystery with this report is not the fergie, but who are J.C and K.C and why have they stayed anonymous? 

&#x200B;

One historic report is as follows

&#x200B;

'September 1965, i was out on the field when in plain daylight i saw a ferguson with no one driving it, the sight of it scared me and i decided against farming that day, for many years i have wondered if it was a runaway or a visit from fateful fergie himself, i only learned of the story years later and it seemed to click'

The legend of fateful fergie grew among farmers in the 1970s and 1980s, with the proliferation of the internet in the 1990s it grew to widespread attention over both paranormal and farming usegroups, despite modern technology, no videos of fateful fergie are said to exist, it is said that fateful fergie does not show up in photographs or video clips, it is also wondered if fateful fergie sightings are getting rarer with increasing farm safety standards, none the less sightings are still occasionally reported, often by younger farmers.
