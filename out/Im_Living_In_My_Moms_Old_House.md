I had just finished unloading my moving truck as I wiped the sweat from my brow. I glanced around the room full of boxes and wondered where I should get started. I had just moved from a small studio apartment into my mothers 2 story farmhouse, so my belongings didn't exactly fill up the place. I decided to take a break. I stepped out onto the porch and lit a cigarette. This place was practically in the middle of nowhere, aside from the single gas station and a blindingly white church. I don't know how my mom did it. I had always knew I'd inherit this place, I just never expected the cancer to take her so soon.

I heard church bells, and looked across the street. A crowd of people poured out of the church. 2 elderly women looked over at me and whispered to eachother. Another woman, around her mid-forties, stopped and stared at me. She smiled warmly at me and started approaching. I put out what was left of my cigarette and smiled at her. "Good morning," she said cheerfully. "Pamela here. I just wanted to get a closer look at the person brave enough to move back into this place." Puzzled, I introduced myself as Mary and asked her what she meant by brave. Such an odd way to start a conversation. "Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I just meant that there's nothing around here for miles, I didn't mean anything by it." I laughed a bit, "oh I know, this is my mother's old place. She passed away 2 months ago." "Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss," she leaned to see behind me into the window.  Her face showed an almost unnoticeable glimmer of fear, "well, I best get going. I'll leave you to your unpacking, goodbye!" I watched as she walked away and wondered what the hell she meant. Brave enough.

I sat on my floor and ate my gas station hot dogs for dinner. It was still light out, and I was sick of unpacking. I finished the last of my dinner, stood up, and started exploring. As I walked around the first floor, I noticed a door I somehow hadn't noticed before. How the hell didn't I notice an entire door before? I tried the handle. Locked. I scrambled around trying to find a key with no luck. I tried pushing it open, prying it open, jamming a card into the latch. Nothing worked. I sat on the floor defeated. How could I not notice a whole room? Why can't I get this for open? What did she mean by brave. I stood up and walked to the back porch. I lit a cigarette, and stared at the scenery. This really was a gorgeous area, the long yellow grass, towering pine trees in the distance.  I stared at my new land when I saw something in the distance. I look like ruins of a building- no, it was just a door. A free standing door. In the middle of my backyard.

 I threw on my shoes and approached. It was a beautiful door, mahogany wood. The door frame was intricately carved with a floral pattern. It was in pristine condition, like it had just been put here. Every hair on my body stood up. I wanted to run, to get away from this. Everything screamed unnatural. But I was compelled to reach for it, to open it. It was as if I was watching myself in third person. I reached for the beautiful doorknob. I felt it turn, and click, and- nothing. There was nothing on this other side of this door. I stood in awe for a minute. Then I started laughing. How could I be so afraid of a door? I really let a complete stranger startle me with two words. I was too preoccupied with the door I hadn't even noticed it had gotten dark. I trudged back to the house and got myself ready for bed. 

The rest of the week was completely uneventful. Everyday I had tried open the locked door, with no success. I sat on my bed and read the classifieds. I needed a job, I needed to get out of the house, I was starting to feel cooped up and lonely. Suddenly I heard the phone ring. At 9pm this made me jump. Who would even call me? I ran down the stairs and picked up the phone. I was met with the dial tone. Whatever, I thought, probably got there too late. I headed back upstairs and slipped into bed. I started hearing very very faint knocking. I flew upright in bed. The knocking grew louder by the minute. It was deafening. I stood up and tried to find the source. But I knew. I didn't even have to look. It was the mahogany door. I don't know how I knew, I just felt it was right. It was drawing me towards it. Again, it was as if I were in a trance. I started barefoot across the backyard, and the knocking seemed to quiet down. I grabbed the doorknob, complete silence. I turned the handle a pushed. I stood there in shock, frozen in place. Behind the door stood an empty jazz club, with the exception of a single man. This man was the most beautiful man I had ever seen, so devastatingly beautiful...

He was dressed in an all black suit. He had neat red hair and piercing blue eyes. He held a bloody mary in his hand. As he looked at me, my blood ran cold. He told me to come have a seat next to him. I slowly walked across the floor, the cold wood felt nice again my muddy feet. "Mary, would you like a drink?" he asked. Even his voice was beautiful. I sat in silence, I didn't know how to answer him. The club was suddenly filled with music, and a bartender stood behind the bad. "She'll have what I'm having," he said to the bartender who silently nodded. "What is this?" I asked, still in a daze. "Mary, I need you. I have waited so long for you to get here. Your mother promised you." I felt woozy. "The only way for me to get you here was to get rid of her." I was so confused. "She died of cancer," I replied, "what do you mean?" He chuckled, although it was cold and lacked emotion. "Her cancer was my doing. I took whatever life she had left. She made a deal with me." I stood up and stumbled backwards. "You're crazy, I really need to leave." But my feet were stuck. I was completely paralyzed. He calmly stood up, walking towards me. He caressed my face with his cold, lifeless hands. "You're not going anywhere. You were promised to me, now your mother must hold up her end of the deal." I looked across the club, searching for anything that would help me. And that's when I saw her. My mother.

"I'm so sorry baby. I'm so sorry." She got up from the sofa she was sitting on, and approached me. She looked beautiful. Healthy. I forgot what she had looked like before the cancer. "I didn't have a choice. You were going to die." And suddenly it clicked. When I was six years old, I had been in a nearly fatal car crash. I spent a month in the ICU on the brink of death. But I had made the quickest recovery any of the medical staff had ever seen. My mother had always told me it just wasn't my time. "Mom, what did you do?" She looked sad, her eyes puffy from crying. "I made a deal to save your life. You're only here now because you were promised to Him." I turned to look at the man. "Who the hell are you?" He just grinned. I already knew. "Mary, honey, I have to go now. Just do what he says and you'll be fine. I love you so much baby" My mom said, as she began to look worse, like she did when she died. "Mom, please, stay! I don't know what's happening!" But it was too late. I watched the cancer take her again as she collapsed on the floor, lifeless. The man turned to me. I was still paralyzed. I was still stuck. I tried to scream, but I didn't have a voice. I have never felt pure terror until this moment. He grabbed my throat, slamming me to the ground. He lifted my nightgown and everything went black 

I woke up in my bed, the sun gleaming through my sheer curtains. I was sweating profusely, relieved that I was only dreaming. I laid in bed, just glad to be safe. As I swung my feet out of bed, my blood ran cold. My feet were covered in mud. I didn't know what to do. I panicked as my mind went back to last night. I ran outside to the door, flinging it open, only to find nothing behind it. I shook my head and walked back. What about the mud? I blamed it on sleepwalking, because there was no other explanation I would allow myself to accept. I got in the shower abd watched the mud spiral down the drain. I stepped out onto the front porch, just in time for church to let out. Pamela smiled and waved at me. I returned the gesture. Brave enough. She approached the porch, this time I invited her in. She sat her belongings on the end table, and I offered her a glass of ice water. We chatted for a bit, talking about where I was from, about my mother. She told me a little bit about herself, her husband owns a farm, and they have a vacation house on a lake somewhere. Pamela was the type that I just felt it could talk to. I asked her if she knew anything about the door. She went pale. "No, I don't think I do. But I really must be going. I've gotta get home to my old man." She quickly grabbed her things and shuffled to the door. As she went down the porch stairs, she yelled "you take care now, you and the baby!" What the fuck. I tried to ask her what she meant, but she didn't answer as she fled my property. 

Me and the baby? Pamela had to be a certain type of crazy. I lit a cigarette and laughed to myself about this conversation. And then I was hit by a wave of nausea. I ran to the bathroom and vomited. The toilet was filled with a pitch black substance. What the fuck was happening to me? I sat and thought about last night. Was I really dreaming? I had to have been. I had to have been, there's no other explanation. I walked back out to the living room, and on the table where Pamela had set her things was a pamphlet. I picked it up and inspected it. The cover only had a picture of the church across the street with the words "Come join us every Sunday." I opened it, when I saw what was written inside my heart skipped a beat. "Church of Satan: come worship Him." Is that really what was across the street from me? I felt dizzy, so I steadied myself on the back of the chair. What the fuck. What the fuck. I really needed to get out of this house. 

There was no luck with finding a job, but it wasnt an issue for now. My mother had left me enough money to live comfortably for a while. Two weeks had passed since my interaction with Pamela, I had started avoiding my front porch while church was letting out. I continued to try the locked room, even trying to knock down the door. Nothing would open that damn door. I felt nauseous here and there, but I hadn't thrown up any black substances again. But something was itching at the back of my mind: my period was definitely late. I didn't know what to think, I didn't want to think about what this meant. Every bone in my body wanted Pamela to be wrong. But I couldn't ignore it any longer. I went to the gas station and bought a pregnancy test. The gas station attendant gave me an odd look. I sat in my bathroom and pissed on it. I waited for what felt like a year. I couldn't bring myself to look at it. I didn't want to know. But I had to, I had to know if I was dreaming, what Pamela meant. I flipped it over and my heart sank. Positive. I felt like I was going to pass out. This couldn't be possible. Ever since my husband took his life 7 months ago, I had kept to myself. There was no way on Earth that I was pregnant. I ran back to the gas station and bought 4 more tests, just to be safe. Positive. Every. Single. Time.

I looked in the phone book for some doctor, and doctor who could take me for an appointment. Everyone was booked until nine months out. Ironic. I felt another wave of nausea and ran to the bathroom. Black again. What was happening to me? I was desperate, terrified. I went to my closet abd grabbed a wire hanger. i straightened it out and sat on the floor. I used the wire hanger to scrape and poke and rip apart my insides. I couldn't have a baby, I wouldn't have His baby. Blood gished from inside me, and I passed out on the floor. I woke up in my bed, freshly showered. The wire hanger and my blood still on the floor. I don't remember getting off the floor, or in the shower. I must have been out of it from blood loss. I went downstairs but I didn't make it down the stairs before I noticed something. On my table sat a basket full of meats, fruits, candies, and prenatal vitamins. In front of the basket sat an envelope. A bright red envelope with the same floral pattern that was carved into the door frame. "To the mother of my child" the envelope read. I ripped it open and read the letter. "Mary, I need you to take care of yourself. This baby will come no matter what you do. You cannot stop it, you have to stop trying. He will be born, and you will raise him. Now please, rest up and deliver me my lovely baby boy."  This can't be happening. I've gotta be dreaming. I've gotta be in a coma abd this is just an intricate dream. I was actively going insane. I heard a knock, and spun around. To my horror, the room had been opened. I approached the door, and inside was a nursery. Decorated for a boy. I vomited right there. 

I felt a cramp and looked down. I had a bump, one that you would expect on a mother 4 months along. I didnt look like this in the morning. Whatever was inside me was growing, and fast. I had a sudden craving. I turned around and eyed the meat on the table. I ripped open the packaging and ate it, not even bothering to cook it. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror above rhe fireplace. I was crazed, meat juice dripping down my chin, eyes wild. I immediately stopped. I sat on the floor and just sobbed. I felt the thing squirming inside me, and I gagged. If I can't kill this baby, I was going to kill myself. I ran to my drawer and grabbed the sharpest knife I could find. I held it up to my wrist and paused. I was really going crazy. I slid the knife into my skin, up my arm. It stung, but it wasn't worse than carrying Satan's child. But to my surprise, no blood came out. Not even a drop. The wound had healed itself in seconds. I dropped the knife and stared. It's better for the baby that way. I wouldn't want to hurt my child. "I'm so sorry," I said to my belly, "I don't know whats gotten into me." I pulled some meat from the basket and cooked myself a nice steak and potato dinner. I watched my stomach grow.

"What will we name you, little guy." I asked my belly. Despite only being almost two months along, my belly was massive. I found myself sitting on the porch again when church was letting out. I had a whole crowd approach me, I was handed casseroles, baked goods, lasagna, you name it, I was gifted it. After all I was carrying their Lord's child. Pamela stood in the back, smiling at me. I waved, she turned and walked away. Everyone was so kind to me, I felt the love radiating off of them. I let a couple touch my belly. "You've only got a week left" someone said, and I snapped back to reality. I stood up quickly and ran inside, ignoring the crowd on my porch. What was I doing, what was compelling me to go along with this? I needed this baby out of me. But how. I grabbed a knife again and held it to my belly. Suddenly the crowd burst into my house and everything went black. 

I woke up in my bed, a common occurrence for me I guess. Only this time I was tied to the bed. Suddenly He walked in. "I'm very disappointed in you, Mary," he said, "I need you healthy for my son." I chose to remain silent this time. "I just need you to deliver my son. Then you're free." I watched as he paced across the room, hands behind his back. "I don't believe you," I said, "You said I would have to raise him." "Ah, yes. But as you've noticed, he'll grow up fast," he winked, "I need to to raise him. Protect him, keep him safe. Deliver him to me." I glared at him. "I will remain with you until you can prove you're capable of keeping him safe, do you understand?" I just stared at him. What if he was being honest? I would be done with him and I could move away. "Fine," I said, "I'll deliver him." He just stared at me and smiled. He left the room, I remained tied to the bed. All I could do to pass the time was sleep. I awoke to a terrible pain in my abdomen and a soaked bed. He ran in the room, a look of pure joy on his face. "It's time, Mary," He said. I screamed. It was incredibly painful. I passed in and out of consciousness. "Here's your baby boy," He said, handing me my son. I held him in my arms, and looked down at this thing. He is so beautiful. He has my eyes. 

As I sit here holding my son, I feel nothing but love for him. Satan approaches me in my armchair, kissing me on the forehead. "I think its safe for me to leave now. I'll be expecting him when the time comes, my dear." I smile at him as I rock our baby. We still dont have a name for him, Satan tells me that it will come later.  He leaves, and I sit here with my baby. The fireplace is warm and comforting. Reminds me of a time before all of this. When I had just moved in, and it was hot. Before I had to bear Satan's Child. A better time. I look at my son, he stares up at me with loving eyes. I get up and walk around with him. I miss myself. This isn't me. I stood, staring at myself in the mirror. This isn't me, no. This isn't me. I look at this child in my arms, brush his forehead. "I'm so sorry," I say. I throw him into the fire. He is screaming in agony. I watch as his skin bubbles and peels. I smiled. I think about the smell of burning baby flesh as I drive down the highway. I got away.
