So, a bit of context will (hopefully) make the title of this post sound less crazy.



A couple of months ago, my girlfriend and I decided to move in together. The location and size of my apartment made it the ideal choice, yet she was still hesitant, mostly due to my taste in furnishings, or lack thereof. “Do you even live here?” she asked the first time I had her over, appalled to discover that I didn’t have a couch, or any furniture in the living room, for that matter. I told her that I don’t have people over very often, so it didn't make much sense spending money on stuff I'd hardly ever use. 



Right before finishing up the moving process, my girlfriend had to scramble to get a plane ticket and fly 6 hours out of state to deal with a family emergency. I drove her to the airport, we said our goodbyes, and then, with all the seriousness that a face could feasibly convey, she said, “There better be a couch when I get back.” 



I honestly didn’t expect couches to be as expensive as they were, which quickly ruled out purchasing one brand new. Thankfully, there were a few listed online that looked nice enough. One of the sellers responded to my message, but flaked on me soon thereafter. Another told me that I could come take a look at his, and when I finally arrived, he told me that he’d already sold it to someone else earlier in the day and forgot to tell me. I was about ready to give up when I got a response from someone else. 



An elderly lady had welcomed me to come by and see if her couch was what I had been looking for. The price was certainly right; every other listing was either far too expensive or within my price range but falling apart. When something seems too good to be true, it usually is. I suspected that this listing would be no different from all the others. Although, there *was* something strange about this lady’s listing that set it apart from the rest; it said something along the lines of, “the price is greatly negotiable. Looking for a good home. Must be the right fit.” 



Despite my uncertainty, I scheduled a time to go take a look at the couch.



Initially, I couldn't help but feel bad for the owner. The deal was just that good, and surprisingly, I arrived to find that the couch was in a near-perfect condition. You could definitely tell that it was old, but it had been carefully refurbished over the years. It's the kind of thing you would find in your grandma’s house, tied to a long history. I didn’t see why anyone would want to get rid of it, especially at that price. 



Oh, and remember that part about the price being negotiable? Well, the price was so negotiable that, due to some unknown set of conditions, it dropped to 0. At first, I thought it was a joke, but she reassured me that she was more than happy to part ways with it. She donned a melancholic smile and gently stroked the couch’s leather-wrapped arms, making it seem less like she was getting rid of a piece of furniture and more like saying goodbye to a family member. 



The topic of her husband came up briefly during our short chat. When I first entered her house, I saw framed pictures of her and, supposedly, her husband. Not to mention the other set of shoes by the front door, distinctly larger than the slippers she wore. Yet I didn’t see him around, and judging by the lady’s age, I assumed that she might be a widow. She inadvertently shot down that assumption almost before it had a chance to form in my head. “He just needed to get out of the house for a little while,” she said with a warm smile. “Oh, how very excited we are about this.”



I had to call a friend to come help me get the couch into my apartment, which was an exhausting endeavor. It felt as though we were trying to move a piece of furniture while someone else was still sitting atop it. Only afterward had I realized that I never even sat on the damn thing even once. I must have been so hypnotized by how good of a deal it was that I skipped over the most crucial aspect of any couch: its comfort.



The couch is many things, but it is *not* comfortable. 



The leather cushions look soft and inviting, yet upon taking a seat, you can immediately sense that something is wrong. Large amounts of padding must have been removed from the inside, which makes you sink much farther into the seat than you should. It's incredibly stiff, feeling less like you’re sitting on a piece of furniture and more like you’re sitting on someone's bony lap.  



My girlfriend gets back in a couple of days, and I've spent a lot of time contemplating whether I should get rid of this couch. Why, you might ask? Not because of how uncomfortable it is, and not because it doesn’t match my other furniture. The truth is, my apartment has just felt *wrong* ever since I got the couch. It's hard to describe, and it feels silly to even type this, but I get the sense that there is someone (or something) in the apartment… living *with* me. 



And it's not just a vague feeling, oh no, things have been happening here as well. Things I can’t explain.



I was sitting on the couch, a day or two after its purchase, when I heard a noise. It sounded guttural, harsh, like someone trying to clear the phlegm from their throat, so quick and hushed that it was nearly too quiet to hear, despite how close it felt. I checked behind the couch and around the corner of the room, but there was nothing. The sound was so close to my ear that whatever made it would have had to be pressed right up against me. 



And just the other night, it happened again. I had woken up in the middle of the night and went to the kitchen to get some water. As I was taking a glass down from the cupboard, I heard yet another noise, one that was much more distinct than the last one. It sounded almost like that of an animal scurrying across my apartment, but I could tell that that wasn’t the case. It was far too heavy and unnatural, creating this horrible *thump thump thump* across the floor. Then it abruptly stopped, like it knew I could hear it.



I slowly crept around the corner, my heart pounding in my chest. Even though I don't believe in the supernatural, there was some kind of primal urge deep in my gut that told me to run away from that sound, not towards it. But the rational part of me pushed ahead anyway. 



I flicked on the lights and saw my living room. No monsters, no ghosts, just… nothing. I didn’t remember leaving my TV on, but there it was, playing on mute. The coffee table looked like it was pushed back, judging by the indents in the carpet. And, of course, the couch, just as I left it.



That night alone was enough to freak me out, even though everything I just described isn't inherently supernatural. I could have simply forgotten to turn the TV off before I went to bed, and maybe I had inadvertently moved the coffee table when I first brought in the couch. But that noise…. No matter how many times I replay the scenario in my head, I just can't come up with an explanation for that god awful noise. 



This problem only seems to get worse. Sometimes I'll come home from work to find that the things in my apartment have been moved around. Yesterday, I found a glass of water on the coffee table, one that I'm certain I didn't put there. Food in my fridge always seems to disappear, and my trash can fills up faster than it normally does, containing things that I don’t remember throwing away.



Does this sound like a ghost to you? I'm sure the answer is *no, of course not.* But what else could it be? It's like I'm living with a roommate I can’t see, or maybe my apartment is slowly filling with carbon monoxide, slowly eating away at my memories. 



I just don’t know. That’s the worst part. Am I in danger? Is my couch haunted? Even if I didn’t like the answers, I wish I knew.



There is one thing I know for certain: all of this began when I first brought that damn couch into my apartment. I know it sounds stupid, but it’s the only thing I can think of. Right now, as I'm typing this, I'm sitting on it, trying to figure out what to do.



I truly must be going crazy, because just a moment ago, I swear I felt something move from inside the couch.
