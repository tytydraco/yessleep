We thought we had made a breakthrough, a leap in the field of robotics that would guarantee lasting effects in the future of technology for centuries to come. Although, I suppose that part is still accurate. 

The concerns about AI assistants had always remained the same. 

First there was the fear that they – in their own form of consciousness – would start to rebel against us. That’s why we implanted them with our version of Asimov’s three laws, rendering them unable to pain us in any way, shape or form. 

In other words; in their own way, they feel undeniable love for us. 

Not like a human who lives for their God, but like a mother who adores her child.  

Then, however, came the worry that they’d go overboard in the ‘Do No Harm’, leaving us to suffer when the only humane response would be death. How painful it may be, even with the best of care – which they are capable of giving even beyond our wildest dreams – in some cases euthanasia is the only option left.

So… we made a little amendment. A small tweak in their core knowledge, so they’d understand that the ultimate goal is not only to keep their humans alive as long as possible, but to minimise their suffering as well. 

We were incredibly excited, and so were our investors. And why wouldn’t we be? The first results were more than promising. 

So much so that we moved onto the next stage of testing and gave some of them a place in our lab, all with their own role to play. For weeks it went well.

And then the first incident happened. 

Dr. Lowe was the first to go, simple because she handed someone a paper. Before we could respond, Number Four had put her down – a highly effective injection to the aorta that stopped her heart in mere seconds. 

Jack was next, while he was trying to solve the problem – messing with Number Two’s wiring. - He tried to tell them everything was fine, but they didn’t hear his desperate pleas.  

And there were many more after him. 

So we begged our bosses to stop the experiment – to no avail. The investors had seen the possible dollar signs and refused to back down. Those fuckers. Money makes the world turn. Who cares about a few dead bodies, right? 

Out of desperation we even started a strike, with only terrifying threats as a result. Most of us have families we want to protect, you know. They’re not even letting us leave anymore now. Not until we solve the issue.

But it can’t be done. They’re not letting us make anymore changes, not allowing anything to get in the way of giving us the best possible care. They love us so very much.

The thing is… Us human beings are fragile things, meant for pain because of our peach skin and general clumsiness. Cuts, bruises, burns, all kinds of silly things that are absolutely fine. We tried to explain it to them, but they don’t want to listen. They simply want to take our pain away, and they’ve found the most effective way to do it. 
 
We learned we could try to cover it and hope for the best, but many got found out nonetheless.

Now I’m sitting here, with a bloodied broken leg, as I’m desperately trying to warn all of you. 

It was a stupid accident, I’d say – a tumble down the stairs.

I tried pushing the bone back in, or to hide it in any way, but it simply isn’t possible. My screams were drawing too much attention as is. 

Ridiculous, isn’t it? Normally this’d be a surgery, a couple of months of recovery, and I’d be good as new. But now… There’s no possible way I can leave the building or hide this from them. 

So, though I will try my hardest to survive, it seems my fate is sealed. 

After all, they wouldn’t want me to suffer. They love me so very much.
