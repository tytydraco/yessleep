We thought we had made a breakthrough, a leap in the field of robotics that would guarantee lasting effects in the future of technology for centuries to come. Although, I suppose that part is still accurate.

The concerns about AI assistants had always remained the same.

First there was the fear that they – in their own form of consciousness – would start to rebel against us. That’s why we implanted them with our version of Asimov’s three laws, rendering them unable to pain us in any way, shape or form.

In other words; in their own way, they feel undeniable love for us.

Not like a human who lives for their God, but like a mother who adores her child.

Then, however, came the worry that they’d go overboard in the ‘Do No Harm’, leaving us to suffer when the only humane response would be death. How painful it may be, even with the best of care – which they are capable of giving even beyond our wildest dreams – in some cases euthanasia is the only option left.

So… we made a little amendment. A small tweak in their core knowledge, so they’d understand that the ultimate goal is not only to keep their humans alive as long as possible, but to minimise their suffering as well.

We were incredibly excited, and so were our investors. And why wouldn’t we be? The first results were more than promising.

So much so that we moved onto the next stage of testing and gave some of them a place in our lab, all with their own role to play. For weeks it went well.

And then the first incident happened. I was having a coffee with Elaine, dr. Lowe, in the break room as she wanted to pass me some papers, giving herself the tiniest paper cut. Before I knew it, Number Four had put her down. A highly effective injection to the aorta that stopped her heart in mere seconds.

When asked to explain, it simply – yet lovingly – replied it didn’t want her to suffer.

Jack was next, after he got an electrical burn when he tried to solve the problem. He tried to tell them he was fine, but they didn’t want him to suffer.

And there were many more after him. Cuts, bruises, burns, all kinds of silly things. Us humans are fragile things, meant to have pain.

We learned we could try to cover it and hope for the best, but many got found out nonetheless.

So we begged our bosses to stop the experiment – to no avail. The investors have seen the possible dollar signs and are refusing to back down. Those fuckers. Money makes the world turn. Who cares about a few dead bodies, right?

Out of desperation we even started a strike, with only terrifying threats as a result. We're not even allowed to leave anymore. Not until we make the issue go away. 

But it can’t be done. They’re not letting us make any changes, not risking anything to get in the way of giving us the best possible care. They love us so very much.

Now I’m sitting here, the bone sticking out of my leg, as I’m desperately trying to warn all of you.

It was a stupid accident, I’d say – a tumble down the stairs.

I tried pushing it back in, or to hide it in any way, but it simply isn’t possible. My screams were drawing too much attention as is.

Silly, isn’t it? Normally this’d be a surgery, a couple of months of recovery, and I’d be good as new. But now… There’s no possible way I can leave the building or hide this from them.

So, though I will try my hardest to survive, it seems my fate is sealed.

After all, they wouldn’t want me to suffer.
