[John's Stories 1 (Pt. 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1aky46b/pt_j1_i_am_a_private_military_contractor_from_the/)

Hello again people of the past, if the nerds overseeing this are right, 2024 or so, a bit later than we thought, but things haven’t gotten too bad yet for you!

Me and Dima actually have a lot of digital footage (which we obviously can’t show) we got from the previously mentioned Chernobyl excursion, unlike the previous story about some Wendigo Illness on base, we were prepared for a fight, but all of it is archived out West at \\\[The Parent Organization\\\]. Kind of pointless writing that down now that I know there are indeed some guy whose job it is to censor stuff like that, but I’ll let him do his job so I can Write a sensible story, point is we got airlifted, given a nice hefty Leave Bonus and a loose Quota to cook up something spectacular, because it was quite an event, so I’ll go into a bit more detail than my previous entry, where I basically was just in my bunk with loose leaf paper and given a day to write something, now for now we at least can use a Computer in The Department HQ.

Anomalies are a touchy subject these days, obviously I’m no expert, and I don’t have access to many files on them that aren’t related to the events I’m about to share, but for the sake of what I’m familiar with, imagine them usually being like Bubbles of various impossible forces, like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R (Fitting, I know), while I know there’s more, Ghosts, Gods, Diseases, all kinds of Good and Evil that we just can’t explain, what’s important here is they have the potential to cause spontaneous teleportation, and apparently transmit something through time as I write this for an internet that doesn’t really exist in the same capacity anymore. For the most part, Europe was left alone aside from Russian Remnants making peace, and from what Dima has told me as an Emissary is that there is trade and survivors in Eastern Rural Russia, like Kamchatka and maybe Alaska, and of course, the less-than savory lands around the Pripyat River.

Initially, it was a Scouting Operation around North Carolina, some guys in a hard-to-reach area were up to no good, a client wanted them gone, and an Air Assault team entering by Helicopter and walking in was the best option, so we were loaded heavier with Food and shelter gear, and only about half a usually Combat Load of Ammo. I’m assuming they were dealt with, but after the event, I never bothered to check. We didn’t get paid for that contract, but got a hefty sum of Credits from The Department for our Data on Chernobyl. Needless to say, we never reached the Infil, it was weird, even with the ‘Black Box’ of an On-Board Camera on our Little Bird Helicopter, I can’t see a single Frame between us flying along a Valley deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains, and nearly crashing into the decrepit remains of one of the Duga Radar’s Towers, I didn’t realize in person how close we were due to how dark it was, but the camera picked it up fine with it’s InfraRed channel, along with many wispy silhouettes and figures seemingly watching us in some of the Frames.

Dima instinctively pulled up as he made another pass while yelling, “TY SUKA, Kak-” \\\[You bitch, wha-’ roughly in English\\\].

We idled for a moment, daring to flip a Spotlight mounted to the Nose of our Bird to break the darkness and get a sense for our surroundings I of course, recognized the remains underneath us, I was in the elusive place I always wanted to go as a kid, scouring every image on google maps, the Stout Office buildings and monolith steel structure was nothing new, Dima caught on a moment later.

“DUGA?!?” he yelled in confusion, blasting my ears again as I turned down my Headset’s volume, the microphone of his own headset was pushed too close to his face and he readjusted it, “Second time in my life that I almost hit that damned thing, what the hell is happening?”

“Where the hell are we?” Charlie yelled through his Radio, Him and Zach sat on one side of the seating outside of the Helicopter, with Heinz taking up the space and Weight limitation of the other side alone.

“Ain’t in Kansas, brother, we scannin’ for radio signals? Where are we?” Zach responded with a therapeutic calmness that he only uses in the worst of situations.

“We’re in goddamn Ukraine, Chernobyl.” I answered, toying with the radio as  Dima found good clearing in the Overgrown Concrete below us.

“Hope you packed right, Johnnyboy, kill those lights, if we’re landing we oughtta throw on NODS” Charlie teased, I did have a tendency to forget bits of gear when Packing, but the paycheck for this contract was good and the time in the field was supposed to be long, so I bright everything I could to feel right at home.

I had my Helmet on standby of course, a sturdy Carbon Fiber shell with nice cushy, ventilated padding (I’m sure any Active Duty or Contractors know how luxurious good padding can feel) equipped with my very own set PVS-14s, not crazy by my current standards, but back then I absolutely earned the second one to go with the Single Tube I had joined with. I flipped the downwards over my eyes as they adjusted to the sudden Green hue of the Tubes, I looked over to Dima, he had a much nicer Post-War set that would have L3 Harris’s R&D frantically taking notes, but for the most part, they were similar, with one using a Magnifier so his old Eyes could see Ground Targets better, like a head mounted Telescope. We give each other a  thumbs up as the Rotor’s speed slows, I was smart enough to use the Scouting cameras we brought to take Pictures and video, popping an SD card into an Action Camera, the Action Camera into a Mount, and clipping the Mount to my Plate Carrier, I didn’t tell anyone to do the same, I was still sort of treated as the ‘Young and Dumb’ new guy, but Charlie took notes with a nod when we left the Cockpit and used a slot on his plate Carrier’s Left Shoulder to mount a Picatinny-Mounted Camera he keeps in a pouch for his ’Teaspoon’: A cute name for an l119a5, a beastly and Precise Bolt Action Rifle in his hands that he brought with him defiantly after deserting his SAS detachment in the Middle East Somewhere.

“Alright, we weren’t shot outta the sky, that’s a good start.” Zach stated, checking his M4’s chamber and clicking his light on and off before slinging it around to his Side.

"Ein Zyklus.” Heinz finally growled out, looking at the beautiful night sky, littered with the lights of the Cosmos with the lack of Light pollution, shining a magnificent see of Bright Green under my Night Vision.

“Zyklus, Zyklus…” Dima muttered in inconvenience as he caressed the rows of a German-Russian Translation handbook he kept close, just for Heinz, “Cycle? One Cycle?”

Heinz nodded, crouched down a bit so the still slowing movement of the helicopter blades didn’t hit him, or moreso, his head didn’t break the helicopter blades, staring off into the shadows of the forest; It should be noted that he had no gear that he couldn’t fit in a satchel he kept over his shoulder, little food, water, and rarely gear like Night Vision, but he seemed to see perfectly fine, originally I just thought the Meth gave him actual superpowers, but maybe it’s just another absurd thing that whatever that he is, is capable of.

Charlie was pulling Security on the other side of the Helicopter, crouched behind a wall and staring out to where the Duga array was with his rifle resting in its direction, He’s been know to see things that aren’t there due to his Alcoholism, so I can’t image 100s of Pipes and beams and other things that something could be hiding around made him comfortable to leave unattended.

“We got dogs, I don’t think they’re after us, but they look curious and damn hungry.” Charlie whispered through our Radios, “If they get rowdy I’m droppin’ em.”

“‘Don’t Fuck with the Wildlife’ Charles, they don’t teach you that across the pond?” Zach jokes, shining an InfraRed light on his rifle into the windows of the nearly-collapsed Office buildings to get a good look inside under his Night Vision.

“Zhon, East.” Dima whispered loudly to me, not raising his AK105, but fingering the Safety Lever on the right side to Semi-Auto, and getting a bit of space between his body and the Stock still folded compactly to the Left side of the receiver, “Contact.”

Dima says now that he saw something like glowing eyes from the woods, a prismatic glow radiating off of them, but with my gear, I just saw something a bit darker than the surroundings.

“No shooting.” Heinz grunted carefully, ‘carefully’ not being used lightly with someone who carelessly will take bullets to the head regularly.

“Dogs are spooked, you got anything?” Charlie whispers, crept up behind me like a parrot on a pirate’s shoulder, looking out where Heinz, Dima and I are staring, “What the hell-”

It was gone, despite maybe being the height of Heinz but much thinner, he made little noise aside from hearing some rapid, loud, but soft clicks or taps over the radio, not like a Gieger counter, but like-

“Not possible, that sounded like Duga Radio Transmission, My father wrote about hearing those radio clicks as far as Afghanistan in his Service” Dima exclaimed, turning sharply back for a double-take to the steel superstructure that lay barren and collapsing behind us.

“We are WAY out of our element h- is that the Radio?” Zach starts, he is still the closest to the Helicopter, everything turned off by Killswitch except the Radio, which apparently picked up an active Channel, “Damn, it’s Russkis or somethin’ Dima, you guys good?”

Dima slung his rifle over his back as he crawled in to grab his Headset, “Ukrop Urodi” \[or something like ‘Ukrainian Freaks’, not very nice to say, but hey, the Camera caught it, so it’s going in the report\] he muttered as I hopped into the CoPilot seat to listen in on my headset, I did know a little Ukrainian and Russian, but can’t really distinguish them too well, the transliteration would get annoying, so I’ll write down Dima’s Translation’s instead.

“This is the Survivors of The Zone, Identify.” came a harsh Masculine voice repeatedly, roughly every 5 seconds.

“This is Dmriti Fedorenko, Pilot of Quirank Security, Subsidiary of \[The Parent Organization\], We are From America, do you know why we are here?” Dima said, sort of modulating his voice to have a different accent entirely.

There was silence for 5 seconds… 10 seconds… 15 seconds… We were starting to think we had lost our only chance at help or had set ourselves up to be hunted and executed, but finally, another voice of a softer, but tenured female.

“Dear Dmitri, Are you still there? Where are you located?” The voice spoke, while it might’ve been due to the light interference, she sort of had the intonation of a mother after explicitly saying ‘she wouldn’t be angry’ and beating your ass when you admit to doing something wrong, which I’m sure is fitting to the situation we were in.

Dima looked at me, I knew what he was thinking, this was a big choice to make alone,

“We don’t have a lot of options here.” I said, admittedly, with a bit of desperation, steadily becoming more and more freaked out since this all started.

Dima sat for another moment, the soft sound of Tapping on the radio making the decision for us.

“Dmitri, would you happen to be around a Large Steel structure?” she immediately responded as the soft taps subsided again.

“Yes, yes, we are located at the Duga-2 Array, where are you?”

“Do you have a vehicle, or are your men stuck on foot?”

“Helicopter, we can be off the ground in…” Dima throws the hidden kill switch lever, as the Little Bird’s instruments start buzzing with life, “...20 minutes.”

“Very Well Dmitri, go about 9 miles North, go fast, the way in the sky is clear; I’m amazed you have lived thus far.”

“Thank you, what may we Call you, madam?”

“Martha, Stalker. See you soon, Fedorenko.” she finally says, an audible analog ‘Click’ as she ends her transmission.

Charlie was standing at my door to the Cockpit at this point trying to listen in on what he might as well considered gibberish as the RPM of the Rotors steadily climbed, “Where to now, lads? We got friends out here?”

“Close enough, It would seem.” Dima utters with annoyance.

“Hold. Goddamn mutts are back, no, not-,” Charlie listlessly muttered to himself, I didn’t see anything, but I didn’t write him off immediately as he violently shook his head with a dissatisfied grunt, and patted down his plate carrier, a small titanium Flask with the Union jack and ‘Cheers!‘ in an elaborate font was dragged from a pouch of sustainment gear. He took a small swig and washed it between his teeth before swallowing, “I’m with ya, no hounds, no hounds.” he said with more confidence, meant more for Zach then me, who looked concerned as he nodded to have him sit down while Me and Dima finished the basic Pre-Flight checks as quickly as possible.

I could hear dogs howling as the increasingly whirring blades steadily lifted, forcing themselves against the Crisp Night’s air, Heinz still stood out into the darkness of the woods, as the Blades reached takeoff speed, he tore page from one of his notebooks, scribbling something on it, and keeping it to the earth with a few rocks further away from the helicopter as it tried to blow the paper into unseen shadows.

“Is Heinz on yet? What’re we waiting for, go!” Charlie yelled irritably into his microphone, barely audible over the air smashing down onto him and Zach, “Alright, that had’t’ve been him, clear?”

Indeed, i felt the weight of the entire craft shift under the recognizable weight of Heinz taking a seat, he pounded ‘softly’ on the chassis, the reverberation striking a soft fear something just broke before we finally are able to take off for the short ride North; still easily half a tank of fuel in the fuselage and some reserves in storage, it was the least of our concern, what did raise concern was seeing a dark figure crawl out of the woods, the light of the Helicopter’s Camera seemingly absorbed by the skinny figure as it went to around where we had just took off from.

In the distance, even up in the air, I could see Lights and disturbances under both the On-Board Camera to the ground below, and my Night Vision to the sky around us; Back home I’d dare call them Ghost-Lights, some folklore about Native Women or Colonialists mourning the dead, but here (as far as I’m concerned, and considering the context,) they were more fittingly just called ‘Anomalies’, I don’t remember many of the kinds by name, but the Eastern European games of my youth featured them plentifully, especially little balls of electricity tantalizingly moving reaching out for any conductive surface, they were a similarly beautiful sight in real life, even from the greater distance.

Breaking the soft bluish electric hues of these Anomalies, and the flat-brightening of our IR-Illuminators under Night Vision, a set of twirling Road Flares broke the darkness on the ground ahead, they were expecting us any moment, “You guys see that? That better be our guys or we are dead in the air.” Charlie yelled out again over the Radio.

Dima grumbled inaudibly as we waited for a response on the Radio, finally receiving confirmation from the Man who first made contact, “Americans? See us? Follow the Light.” as gruff as before, we gave a confirmation and made a descent.

Below us now was a clearing, there were soft lights and buildings, some originals of the Exclusion Zone, but many looked newer, or cleaner, at the least; the steady wave of a light around a roughly marked ‘H’ and Circle marked off with Chemlights grabbed my attention, there were other Helicopter pads nearby, with what Dima’s eccentric knowledge identified as a set of Russian Mi-26 Transport Helicopters.

“Weapons ready,” Dima ordered squeamishly as he made a second pass around the area, dropping altitude and speed steadily as we lined up on the makeshift landing area, “for worst case.”

‘Aye!’ ‘’Rah, sir!” Charlie and Zach responded respectively.

We once again came to a halt on the ground as the rest of the squad dismounted, face to face to a full rag-tag fireteam, 2 in Powered Armour gear and PKPs, but the rest in loose fitting jackets, battered AKs of various generations with flashlights trained on Zach and Charlie, Heinz still sat even as I was ushered out very diplomatically by one of these men, Dima only Locking the Fuel Lines and throwing his secret killswitch before stepping out, his hands raised despite the rest of use with our fingers hovering just outside the trigger guards.

“Fedorenko? Dmitri Fedorenko?” a man with a Red Shemagh thrown around his head and shoulders yelled out vaguely to us

Dima stepped forward at his demand with a crisp salute and Nod putting on his odd accent, “Serzheant Fedorenko, Quirank Security Pilot U664, United States.” almost a default formal greeting, aside from the altered name.

They stared at each other for a moment, sizing up or maybe just thinking over a response, “I assume your men don’t speak any Regional tongues?” \[Be noted that most of this is again, just translated by Dima\], “Definitely shouldn’t be all the way out here.”

“My Copilot, Johnson, knows a little; enough for drinking and shooting, yes?” he throws a thumb over his shoulder to me with a hearty chuckle, I Raised my hand in response as a few lights and their accompanying barrels pointed my way.

“Are you all American?” the ‘Interrogator’ yelled in decent English in my Direction.

“No, just me and him are American.” I said back while pointing to Zach, who stood deathly still in silence off to my left somewhere.

“Your friend here claims you’re all from America, yet less than half are American?” he said with even more irritation, getting a bit touchy with something deep in the pocket of his Gorka jacket.

“Hey, hey, we’re a Security and Humanitarian group, Sie, we just work over in America.” Charlie interrupted, looking a bit restless with the kinds of questions getting asked.

The English accent drew the man forward by a few steps, soft gusts of air pushing his Red shemagh off of his head to sit around his shoulders. “Then where the hell is your Aid, O’ saviors?”

Charlie’s camera caught the first good look at the man aside from the vague red of his scarf: pale, lean, tired, probably military personnel at some point, but that didn’t matter anymore.

“Stop, Alexei, they didn’t come here of their own accord,” An old woman responded in Ukrainian, hidden by the beams of light from the firing squad ahead of her, “let them breathe, they can help us, and I can help them get home.” As she spoke, the men quickly dropped their weapons, the flashlights finally being turned off to leave the area lit by Flares and dimmed spotlights.

The woman was old and looked frail, wheelchair bound and pushed by a Casually-dressed man, who nodded towards us.

“Martha?” Dima partially asked and stated.

“Hm, ‘Fedorenko.’ ” She responded with much more certainty, “Please, we can eat and talk together inside, come.” continuing in a beautiful, uncannily familiar English, her Nurse whispering angrily to some of the armed men as he turned her around to go into a 2-story concrete building with a warm glow from its clean and decorated windows.

Normally, due to his absurd stature, Heinz wouldn’t be able to even get through the front door of normal Eurasian buildings, but the high ceilings and double doors gave even him a homely welcoming to this weird encampment, he freaked many of the people inside, even causing mostly unheard argument over letting ‘a post-war freak’ into the softly decorated Cafeteria area.

We mostly sat at a steel folding table, gathered around it to me and Dima on the long side, Zach and Charlie at the ends, and the Old woman, Martha, rolled opposite from us as her Nurse stood guard behind her.

“You boys have come a long way, certainly not alone?” she quizzed softly in her pleasant English, soft and sharp despite looking like she could barely lift a hand with her thin body.

“No, we just, uh, ended up here, I guess.” I said after Noone else immediately filled the silence of the question.

“Such is life these days, I’m sure even in America you’re feeling the effects of- everything, if militias are running about in Helicopters,” she said warily, tapping her fingers on the table, “But we will be grateful if you can help us, and I can help you in return, yes?”

“What’n- How?” Zach asked abruptly, matching her low tone.

“First, I’m sure you saw…” her eyes got a bit wide and frantic, looking beyond us for a moment off to Heinz,  staring out the window to the Forest silhouetting against the night sky, “... Something, out where you were?”

“Yes, ma’am,” Zach responded with a fearful excitement, “I dunno if we can kill it.”

“Don’t worry, you don’t have to, hopefully, just give us peace of mind on what it is, exactly, it is very elusive, killing our men around the old Duga installation, everyone’s too scared to go after it now.

“You want my men to go after a Creature you know nothing about?” Dima said with his common Fatherly defensiveness, “What if we decline?”

“We know nothing- Petrov,” making Dima go wide eyed, he had removed his name patches and none of us called him by his actual last name, “But you must have something that kept you alive this long. Additionally, of course, food, medicine, anything you can spare would make more of a difference than you think, but it’s the easy way out. There is a third option, but I think that will be self-fulfilling- if you get home at all of course-.”

“Alright, yes, I see, how soon can you get us home, it’s a long and dangerous flight…” Dima stated, past this our Camera’s Storage had run out, but I believe she said something about the same way we got here, which I can say will make more sense in due time.

We sat around for some R&R, mostly keeping to ourselves, Dima socialized the most   with the locals, but Zach easily made them the most comfortable, despite only being able to really speak with the few people who knew some English; he traded out 2 days’ worth of MRE’s and some spare gear and medicine from his Trauma Bag to simply hear some stories about life here, Me and Charlie followed suit, handing over half a Tin of Cigarettes and a box of my 7.62x39 to get Cold double shots of cloudy, unmarked Vodka to go with our stew, graciously waived by Martha, and Zach eventually came back around to join us.

“These guys are hard, heard Warrant Officers and SEALs with less interesting Lives in the Corps, even made up ones, they’re either damn good storytellers or it’s worth getting ourselves a guide out there.” Zach declared enthusiastically, almost falling out of his chair as he sat down.

“You’d have to convince someone to go out there first, you di’n’t hear any stories about the thing we’re hunting? Probably means they’re all dead.” Charlie murmured, staring down his old friend while shoveling a chunk of Mystery Meat and boiled leaves into his mouth.

“All I got was that it sticks around that ‘Duga’ thing and makes weird noises.”

“No shit, mate, we were there.”

“You know, maybe the guy asking all those questions is like a head-honcho, if Martha wanted someone to keep an eye on us, it’d be him right?”  I asked.

“The Alex guy or whatever? Yeah, I guess we’d end up with him, huh?”

“Someone told me he was some RusFor commander or State security back when that mattered, only speculation it’d seem, but he definitely seems crafty ‘nuff,” Zach interjected, cracking open a prepackaged bottle of water and sipping, looking off in thought to the Disgruntled and sickly-looking man, but it was clear he wasn’t the only one in that kind of condition, “Jesus Christ, o’course!” he sputtered in epiphany, fumbling through the bag loaded with neatly organized medical supplies, pulling out a yellow and white box and a sheet of its pills.

“Yeah, I was wondering about that.” I said. We hadn’t brought dosimeters or anything with us as fallout wasn’t a big issue in America at the time, especially not on our mission. Potassium-Iodide pills to help purge our body of any radioactivity seemed like a good safe-than-sorry, the terrible taste and dryness definitely beat whatever happens with the presumably lingering radiation.

“All these poor bastards are stuck in Chernobyl without enough Medicine to go around, I’ll be back.” Zach stated, grabbing 2 boxes of the Pills and walking dutifully to Alexei. Zach didn’t have a camera or anything to catalog what happened, but it was clear Alexei was thankful as he stared at the packaging, that was in English, for a moment before figuring out what it was with the help of the radioactive warning symbol on it, and looked up to give Zach a Handshake reinforced with respect, they exchanged some words with the help of Dima for a few minutes while me and Charlie ate our ‘Scav Stew’, as I decided to call it, which was actually pretty well seasoned with Peppers and Dill in my opinion, despite my dear British companion complaining about exactly that.

“He’s checkin’ in with Martha, but Alexei is glad to ‘help us not die’ on our Op.” Zach said smugly with a pat on our shoulders as he and Dima sat back down on their corner of the table.

“Did he divulge anything about our skinny bastard of a beast?” Charlie whispered loudly, leaning hard into the table.

“Our best chance is at night, but you guys saw him and I didn’t, so I can’t say for sure how easy that’ll be.”

“Well, I saw SOMETHIN’ out there all-right, if that's a damn bear or somethin’ though, I don’t think it could be alive that thin.

‘No shooting.’ The few coherent words Heinz has made in the past few hours, replayed in my mind repeatedly.

“It’s as ‘of this world’ as Heinz. It has to be.” I groaned, knowing we stood no chance if it really wanted us dead, the utterance of his name summoning the 7-foot something goliath, “Heinz, you gotta tell us, what the hell was that thing.”

Heinz shook his head slowly at me, making eye contact just out of reach of his nose as he towered above me, “-Wirst es wessin.” he spat, before walking away again to stare into the Forest.

“Hm, know, know, Wirst, Wirst- know. ‘You’ll know’ I believe.” Dima translated, thumbing through the ‘w’ pages of his translator.

“We’re fucking dying out here.” I mumble with hands cupped over my face, rubbing at it as I slump over the table.

“Look, APPARENTLY we can leave any time we want according to little-miss Martha, this is up to Honor.” Zach assures.

“...No. She knows we’ll do this already- she knows things she shouldn’t already, we are dealing with the Duga Creature. Tonight.” Dima commanded. Remember that despite it being into the Morning hours, we had come here instantaneously from only being awake for a few hours before this, so we were all too energized with absolutely no jetlag, if we wanted it done tonight, we could do it just fine.

“For honor then.” I raised a second round of Vodka I had bartered for.

“‘L’right’n, for honor.” Charlie raises his glass as well to mine.

“Za Chest.” \[‘For Honor’, of course\] Dima announces as he pops open his tin of cigarettes and flips one between his teeth.

“For Honor, then boys.” Zach responds, touching his water bottle to our glasses.

For the most part, we were ready from the moment we had landed the first time, so me and Dima sat and smoked while the helicopter got up to an Idling speed, we chatted a bit about personal stuff, and considering the only people here to write out this report is us, we’ve decided to not include that. Alexei eventually came out in wisely light gear, a Harness with some unfamiliar equipment and a Green NBC suit, a Russian Military-Issued Gas Mask clenched off of his face and instead into his forehead while doing a final gear check to greet us.

“Me-y English, ah, bad, I will…” He taps on a heavily worn AK74-M plied close to his body, it’s Foregrip mounted with an old style of the GP-30 Grenade launcher, like before the war, “... try to help, uh, yes?” I think he had winked at Zach, but it was hard to tell with his eyes nearly buried by his mask.

“Not terrible, Alexei, keep workin’ on it.” Zach said with pride, Alexei looked confused though, looking to me and Dima for help, Dima translated.

“Spasiba, Petrov.” \\\[‘Thanks, Petrov’, notably, in Russian.\\\] he responded with a smirk, apparently that secret fell apart pretty fast.

The flight back to the station was again generally clear, but it seemed the Anomalies were trying to close in on our path at an extremely slow pace, something like I’d have imagine the red sea to come crashing down on the Pharaoh's army as a kid, just very, very slowly, and with fragments of raw energy instead of an entire Sea. We landed without incident though, but as we went through the usual process after landing, the way we had come from was indiscernible from the rest of the sky, the anomalies flickering along with Visual Opera of the stars high in the air.

“See, Anomalyi?” Alexei asked as I continued to stare off into the sky. I knew enough about Russian to know that he meant ‘Anomalies', I didn't want to bring it up.

“Yes, deadly? Da, Smertelno?” I repeated in Russian to get my point across, he just nodded for a moment and looked away from them, off into the woods.

“John, y’hear it?” Zach yelled to me, we had the Radio on again and set up a perimeter around it, Heinz standing uncomfortably close to the edge of the wall of darkness into the undead forest speckled with Red leaves, but under night vision, looked much less intimidating.

“Nope, nothin’”

“He better show up, goddamnit, what if he doesn’t- there? There.” Charlie yelled out erratically, turning on the heel of his boot towards something he must’ve spotted in the woods.

“Yes, that’s it? Alexei?” Dima confirms.

Alexei, who didn’t have Night Vision, simply beamed the location Dima pointed to with a Powerful blacklight, pounding my PVS-14s lenses for a moment before the auto-gating filtered it out, and there it was: Tall, dark, putridly human, but simply not, animalistically hunched over, it wasn’t as tall as Heinz, he could’ve been twice as tall- 10? 14 feet? It wrapped itself in its branchlike arms, trying to hide away, but we saw, all of us finally saw.

“Don’t engage, it’s Clickin’ away.” Zach demanded, our Radios were definitely receiving the odd noise again, we didn’t (and still to this day) don’t know what the attempt to communicate really means, but the ticking of the frequency started to become drastically more frequent, almost a Buzz instead of a steady pecking, and then it stood. Silence.

“Run?” Charlie mused

I flunked High School, but I didn’t need much to know that we weren’t surviving if we did that, “Hide?” I called back.

Thankfully, probably the first time in my stories so far, we were ready with our Active hearing Protection on when the dramatic ‘POP-CRACK-BOOM’ of Alexei putting an immaculately aimed Grenade on the Creature, which hardly reacted, it stepped out towards Heinz, it’s face once more unobscured by the Trees, and stared at him, head cocked in curiosity, before darting for Alexei, who still stood uncomfortably close to me; Now was the time to try running.

It was horribly silent, aside from once again the now war-drum-like pounding of the radio signal in my ears, it pounced for Alexei, who in his health, didn’t have much running in him, it went straight for a leg i think, I don’t want to imagine what it looks like gnawing on him, but even under my EarPro and panicked panting, i could hear the Crunch and Alexei crying out, or maybe it somehow put that on the Radio, too.

“I’m next. I’m next. I’m next.” the only though in my mind, manically on repeat as I ran for the other side of the wall where Charlie had posted up from our first landing. I was ready to Dome myself if it meant avoiding whatever that thing would do to us; we never got a clear answer on that.

It loomed over me, it got closer, closer, it reeked of blood and some kind of animalistic Body Odor, but it didn’t yet attack, the clicking on the radio started to ‘calm’ again. I almost thought about daring to move, but it blindsided me with a massive palm, as I crumpled in some filthy overgrown concrete corner, despite no physical damage that i could tell, i felt like i was dying, maybe concussed, I made peace that death wouldn’t be too bad after everything I’ve been through, and drifted off a bit.

“...new guy dead already? Not on my watch, come on Charl’. John, Johnson, can you hear me? Do you understand me?” I awoke to Zach asking me, my nose burned as he continued to wave a towelette of Ammonia under my nose, as he very tenderly checked my spine and head.

“What- yeah- no- yeah, I understand. The creature?”

Charlie’s camera caught it way better than Zach had explained it: After it struck me, it effortlessly stepped over the wall I had hid behind and made pursuit for Dima who had run after me, Heinz finally caught up and intervened, while compared to one of us, this thing was impossibly strong, Heinz was much more his level, he dragged him down to his knees, then to his side, the radio clicking was no longer steady, but unstable and without logic, Heinz held him at head level, and said something- impossible, i guess, it’s like i can’t hear it, i definitely could transcribe it, but he calmed down a bit, the Creature seemingly spat up a crumpled paper it still looked dead and devoid of emotion, Heinz took the soggy paper, shoved it into his bag, and pulled out a small baggie of what must’ve been more Methamphetamines, hand feeding it to the freak of nature, the radio signal changed to a beep, not steady, but in a set of rhythms, like a heart monitor, he screeched something in that inconceivable language to Heinz, and with understanding, let him go. It looked hungrily at Alexei again, who Zach had wrapped in a self-heating shock blanket, but shook violently before bounding off deep, deep into the woods.

“Oh, dear, Alexei, is he alright?” She asked with a grand amount of concern, inexplicably showing up with her Nurse.

“He’ll make it, I’ll leave some extra antibiotics and bandages by your truck if you can take him.” Zach responded.

“Truck? No, Sergei can take them, for when we return.” The nurse looked up, and swung around and unzipped a mostly empty Assault Pack that he had on his back, and walked off with a confused Zach to grab some supplies from his bag and Helicopter storage.

“Your end’a the deal, madam.” Charlie breathed with exhaustion, looking back to the Duga array, the speckling gradient of Red breaking the night.

Her Smile is the last thing Charlie’s camera caught. Our helicopter, our gear, and ourselves were in a field, I now laid alone on the left bench of the Little Bird, Fighting off sleep at Zach’s order, but jolted a bit as the scenery changed from a serene dawn to the deep hues of Violet, the croaks of Frogs and screeches of Cicadas, the sound of a firefight off somewhere, home.

While he wasn’t much help, Charlie took the Co-Pilot seat while Zach had me strapped down to the bench with my head in my lap to keep an eye on me. We immediately got Radio contact from our HQ, but the Colonel was unusually on the line instead of our normal Operator team.

“Where have you boys been? Martha treat you well?” is all he queried with a playful tone before he put our dispatcher on the line, who was unsurprisingly frantic and confused.

Even all these years later, we only have a rough idea of what’s happening on the Eastern Front, our footage is highly prized and \\\[The Parent Organization\\\] has a team... {DATA TRUNCATED}... I’m frustrated with all this writing, Dima can get his Stories polished and sent out.
