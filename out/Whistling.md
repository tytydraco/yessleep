Whistling at 2:30 AM

I live in a house where I can’t find much history of, all I know is that when my parents moved in the found a pelvic bone and  dirty magazines in the wall of the bathroom. 

Growing up I have always seen a female spirt with long black hair, pale body and around 5’6. I see her walking around the hall way sitting in my old room and all that sort of stuff. My mum has seen this too, she said she always thought it was me and me and this spirt are pretty similar looking. My mum would always tell me she would walk past my room at night and see her sitting on the edge of my bed or would see her in the corner of her eye. This has been going on for 15 years since we first moved in. I’ve gotten used to the spirt and don’t see her as much lately but this is what freaks me out…

 for the last two weeks I’ve been hearing whistling, the whistling starts between 2:30 am - 3:00 am. The first time this happened I was laying in bed on my phone, suddenly the whistling started. It sounded like a grown man was whistling outside my house. 

My house has only one neighbour next to us and the other side of the house is land, it’s full of dirt and bush for a bit. My room is at the front of the house, the window shows a view of out the front of my house where there is a field. 

After a minute I built up the courage to look outside the window, nothing was there but it got extremely quite the whistling stopped. I got back into bed and it started again sounding closer. after a few minutes the whistling stopped. The same thing happened every night at the same time but I don’t look out the window any more I have a feeling not to, like something is telling me it’s not okay to look.
Last night was different, as I was preparing for that whistling to start again suddenly I heard a bang on the roof, followed by footsteps. This lasted a minute as soon as I thought it was over I heard footsteps outside my window. I laid still and psyicaly could not move I felt a negative energy and something wasn’t right. 

That’s when my dog walked in and looked at the window. She normally is a loud dog and will bark when she hears noises and try and investigate however the look on her face made me even more scared, she jumped onto my bed and cuddled me. My dog has been very quite today and will not go near my window. 

I have no idea what this is and what it want if anyone has any ideas or anything please let me know. I am a person who picks up on energy very easily and can feel presents so maybe this is why I am the only one who is experiencing this in my house, but whatever this is I want it gone and want to know what it is.
