As I stood behind the counter at the gas station watching the literal seconds tick by on the clock, I heard the familiar “ding” I hear when the front door is opened or closed. I looked up and saw no one. “Weird.” I said out loud to absolutely no one, but I wasn’t particularly concerned.


 I took a second to take notice of  the lighting in the station. It seemed darker and danker than usual; like the lighting in the cheesy horror movie. There was tension in the air that was so thick I was suddenly choking on it, and a feeling of deep anxiety seemed to be sitting on my chest.



The phone rang. I picked it up on the first ring without hesitation as I always did. My favorite part about this job was answering the phone; it made the day go by faster and made it look like I was actually working if the boss happened to be in.


“Hello, how can I help you?” I asked.


Clear as day, as if he was standing right next to me and whispering in my ear himself “Are you closing alone tonight?” the voice said. 


I was.


I paused. My heart fluttered. While the voice itself didn’t sound threatening, I was 100% sure this was a threat. Unsure of exactly what to say I just stayed firm and professional “How can I help you?” I repeated. I felt as though I was on autopilot.I had no other choice but to say those words.


“Are you closing alone tonight?’ The voice repeated. The voice sounded familiar, like my own voice inversed, if that makes sense. 


Suddenly I found my free will. “Fuck off!” I yelled into the phone. The voice on the other end started laughing. I hung up with tears in my eyes. Fuck that guy. I thought, while not thinking much else. But then the fear shot through me. Very similar to the anxiety I had been feeling before the call, but turned way up/



That guy wasn’t just messing with me. He wanted to hurt me. I could literally feel it. I cannot stress that enough. I knew it to be so. I cannot explain how or why. 


“What’s wrong, hunny?”I looked up to see one of my regulars standing there. I hadn’t even heard her come in. Sharol was a big lady, around 5’11 with muscular arms. She drove truck. “I have been coming here for years and I have never seen you this upset” 


“Does it look weirdly dark in here to you?” I asked, practically pleading for some reassurance that I was not absolutely losing my mind.


“Umm…. maybe?” she said as he looked up and around confusedly. I could tell the answer was really no but that she could sense my desperation.


“Do you need anything, honey?” she sounded even more concerned now.


“Yeah, walk me to my car.” I said.


“You closing early?” she said. 


It was like I heard the question but couldn’t quite process it. I was like it floated right over me. I couldn’t respond. 


“Do you need anything before I go?” was all I said.


I rang her up for her usual pack of marlboro reds and can of diet mountain dew.


My car wasn’t parked in an actual spot, but off to the side near the air/ vacuum that people could access with a few dirty quarters. Across the grass, parked parallel to my car on the street, was a small red sedan. Or maybe it was a hatchback. It was small. And it was running and the lights were on. I sprinted ahead of Sharol and ran into my car and locked the doors. I didn’t think of her safety or even to thank her. I just took off. The car followed me. It started speeding up and getting as close to the bumper as it possibly could. He was trying to ram me, but he wanted to scare me first. I knew it. 


I felt a crash and I heard the sound, in that order. My processing was all out of whack. He kept ramming me and I just kept driving as fast as I could. It occurred to me that I had no idea where I was going, only that I needed to get away from him.


I began disassociating. I could see the chase from a bird's eye view, like someone watching it on TV. And suddenly, I was. “Did they ever find her killer?” the man sitting next to me pointed to my car on the television. “No, so sad.” I said.


Then, I woke up. FUCK. My heart was pounding in my chest as I struggled to catch my breath. Quitting weed was great for my lungs but terrible for my nightmares. They seemed so… real. I don’t know where I came up with this stuff. I hadn’t had this active of an imagination since I was 5. I have NEVER EVEN WORKED AT A GAS STATION IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Had I fallen asleep to “let’s not meet” stories again? I’ve heard plenty of those that started with working at a  gas station alone for a night shift.


I looked at the bed and saw my wife sleeping peacefully next to me. I usually woke her up after a bad dream, but there had been so many these past few weeks I felt bad doing so.


Suddenly, my phone rang. Extremely unlikely to be spam at this hour. Worrying for my mom and 1000 worst case scenarios running marathons through my head, I quickly picked up.


“Hello? How can I help you?


“Are you home alone tonight?” A voice said.


I hung up. I'm shaking. I'm typing this out because I can't figure out of I'm stuck in a dream or if the dream wasn't a dream or what is going on exactly. I made sure all the doors and windows are locked,  luckily we live on the second floor of a duplex so we have a bit of an advantage there. Anyone have any idea what is happening to me? I keep trying to wake myself up but as far as I can tell I'm already awake... but I was sure i was before. Everything felt so real.
