  I was relieved when I heard the sound of the school bell ringing. It was finally time to go home. Also, I had taken a test that day and I didn't study for it. So, I just put random answers.

  The only thing I was looking forward to was meeting up with my best friend, Sara. We always biked home together and talked for hours.

  Today we talked for way too long and once we realized how long we'd been talking for it was to late. It had became dark already. I started to panic and I told Sara "If we don't start going faster my parents are gonna ground me for a year!" Sara then told me "Don't worry, I know a short cut. It's just up ahead threw that alleyway."

  I was actually really scared to take that shortcut because it was really dark outside. I didn't say anything because I knew I was already in alot of trouble and couldn't be any later than I already was.

  Once we were walking through the alleyway, I told Sara " You know Sara, I'm actually really scared to go through this alleyway." Sara didn't say anything. All she did was just laugh.

  We had been walking through this alleyway for a second when all of a sudden we heard something that almost sounded that something crawling really fast behind us. We turned around and there was of course nothing there. I whispered to Sara " Do you think we just imagined that?" Sara whispered back" I hope so."

  When I had just thought it was just my imagination, we heard the same sound again. We quickly turned around but, this time there was something behind these boxes. We could see that there was something moving behind the box and we went closer to the box. When we were about 10 feet away from it this women slowly emerged from behind the box.

  The women for some reason was wearing a wedding dress but, that wasn't the weird thing about her. The weird thing about her was that her skin it looked burnt. Her skin almost looked black. Her eyes were replaced by black empty holes.

  I didn't even need to say anything, Sara just started running when I started running. While I was running I saw Sara get pulled back. I turned around to see the women's hair around Sara's ankle and her head had hit the floor and it was bleeding.

  I ran towards Sara and tried my best to free her. While I was trying to free Sara, another piece of the womens hair wrapped around my neck and lushed me against the wall. The woman choked me until I blacked out.

  When I woke up it was around 7 AM.I started panicking because I couldn't see Sara anywhere. I looked for her for while until I just quickly ran out the alleyway and ran home. When I got home, my parents immediately started asking me where I was. I told them the truth about what had happened but of course, they didn't believe me.

  They launched a police investigation to find Sara but, even after five years they have never been able to find her. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I was pulled by the woman's hair instead of Sara.
