**What will they think of me?** I asked myself, thinking of my sister and my friends, as I navigated the foggy roads of Polomolok. The air was thick, and I could barely see the surroundings. All I had was the dim glow of my car's weak fog lights, a sketchy map, and the remnants of a risky deal. **A leap of faith,** I thought. But isn't that what life had always been?

My lower eyelid had been twitching for weeks. According to an article I'd read online, it was either stress or caffeine. Since I wasn't big on caffeine, it was probably the former. I couldn't even blame myself for my situation. The past few months had been a blur of sleepless nights, kitchen fights, screaming, and endless blaming. All of it had snowballed into lawyers, paperwork, and, eventually, the inevitable—divorce.

**We're going to be okay. You can do this, Elisa.** I took a deep breath, exhaling shakily. **This is the fresh start we need.** A blank slate, away from the tragedy of my failed marriage, away from the shadow of my sister's success. **No,** I corrected myself, **I’ll make a name for myself.** With my small business—my human hair wig venture—I vowed to succeed.

"Where are we going, Mother?" Melissa’s voice broke my thoughts, her tone heavy with boredom from the long drive.

"Our new home, sweetheart," I replied, trying to sound cheerful, even though I wasn't entirely convinced myself.

As the house came into view, it loomed gray and lifeless against the backdrop of smaller, shabbier homes. Even through the fog, the building's size was imposing. Its dingy, gray picket fence added to its unsettling presence. **It needs some work, sure. But it's big enough for us—and impressive enough for my friends,** I thought as I pulled up to the curb.

I parked the car and turned to Melissa, who had dozed off during the drive. "Mel, we're here," I said softly. She groaned in protest, clearly exhausted. "Fine," I sighed, rolling my eyes. "I'll handle everything for now."

The ground squelched beneath my feet as I approached a small, disheveled old woman standing in a mud puddle. "Are you Ms. Maluk?" I asked, fighting the unease building in my chest.

"Why, yes, I am!" she replied, revealing a grin that showed rotting teeth. "You're the new owner, then?"

"That’s right," I confirmed, offering a strained smile.

"Well, not anymore!" she cackled, slapping her thigh. Her body odor hit me like a wave.

I forced a laugh. "I believe we're here because of our agreement," I said, reminding her.

"Oh, yes. Since the paperwork is done, I'll be moving out shortly." She gestured to two large, worn boxes near the front door. "There’s a store nearby if you need to grab something. Don’t want to let your daughter go hungry, do you?"

Then, her tone shifted. "Can I have some of your hair?"

My stomach flipped. "What?"

"I guess I'll just wait for your daughter," she said cryptically, her thin lips curving into an unsettling smile before she shuffled off toward her boxes.

A chill ran down my spine. **What an odd woman,** I thought, watching her leave at a speed that seemed too fast for her frail appearance. Doubts about her ownership of the house swirled in my mind, but the paperwork had been verified. **Everything’s legal. There’s no reason to worry.**

After barely five minutes, she messaged me to say she had already left. No chance to grab anything from the store.

The house felt strange. As we stepped into the yard, the sparse, dying vegetation and mud puddles made it look more like a wasteland. The front door creaked open, revealing a vast, cold, and dimly lit corridor. I flicked on the light switch, only to see two grotesque skeletons hanging from the ceiling, locked in an eternal embrace. Their hands had been fitted with light bulbs, casting an eerie glow.

"Mom, are those mud prints?" Melissa crouched, pointing to the floor.

I followed the trail of muddy footprints leading to the bathroom. **That woman must have used the bathroom before leaving,** I thought irritably as I grabbed a rag to wipe the floor.

"Mel, go unpack our things from the car and get your room ready," I called out. She groaned but obliged.

Exhaustion hit me like a freight train when I finally lay down on the bed. I barely had time to close my eyes before I slipped into a deep, dreamless sleep.

I woke suddenly to the sound of metal crashing on the floor. My heart raced as I strained to listen. **Footsteps? Whispers?**

"Melissa?" I whispered, my body rigid with fear. My phone was useless—no signal. Then I heard it again: muffled footsteps, this time faster, heading toward Melissa’s room. Panic surged through me as I grabbed the nearest object—a lamp—and bolted for her door.

"Melissa!" I threw open the door, and in the darkness, I saw a figure standing beside her bed. But as I moved closer, it vanished into thin air. The air grew thick and putrid. **Rotting flesh?** My stomach lurched, bile rising in my throat.

"Melissa, are you okay?" I flipped the light switch.

She pointed at her belly. I rushed over and lifted her shirt, revealing a massive, throbbing pimple-like swelling. My heart stopped as it wriggled beneath her skin. **What is that?** I thought, horrified, when suddenly, a cockroach erupted from the swollen lump, followed by hundreds more. They poured out of her belly, leaving a gaping, bleeding hole. Her organs pulsed inside the wound as blood pooled around her.

"Help me," she whimpered, before collapsing in a heap.

A scream tore from my throat.

Then I woke—cold, sweaty, and shaking. **Just a nightmare,** I told myself, trying to calm my racing heart. **Just a nightmare.**

For a moment, I lay in bed, heart hammering in my chest, the memory of the nightmare still fresh. But there was no time to linger. I had orders to fulfill—two wigs to complete this week. My new wig-making business, my fresh start, couldn't wait.

After watching a video online about a man who made millions selling human hair wigs, I'd thrown myself into the industry, using part of my alimony to get started. This one would work—I could feel it. I'd already received two orders this week. The future was promising.

I sat down at my workstation, but just as I started weaving the strands together, I realized something. **I’m out of human hair.**

"Melissa?" I called out, hoping she was nearby. "Can you help Mommy, please? Check the boxes for any spare hair."

"There's nothing in here," she replied after rummaging through the supplies.

Hours passed as I searched through the house, desperate for any solution. Finally, I slumped in defeat. **I can’t fill these orders without hair. What am I going to do?** My gaze drifted toward the dresser mirror. I stood, staring at my reflection—my long hair cascading down my shoulders. **It’s not enough, but it’s something,** I thought, a strange energy surging within me.

Without hesitating, I grabbed a pair of scissors and began cutting away my own hair, the sharp sound of the blades snipping through the strands filling the quiet house. It wasn’t much, but it was something. **This will have to do.** Hours passed as I worked on the wigs, pushing through the exhaustion that tugged at my body.

Just as I finished one of the wigs, a sharp, stabbing pain ripped through my stomach. The agony was so intense that I fell to the floor, gasping for air, clutching my belly. The pain subsided as quickly as it had come, but I remained on the cold floor, trembling, disoriented.

I forced myself into a chair, still clutching my stomach. **What was that?**

A faint, manic laugh echoed through the house. My breath hitched. **Who's there?**

I scanned the room, my mind racing. **I must be sick.** My thoughts were muddled, but I had no time to dwell. I picked up the phone and scheduled a doctor's appointment for later that day.

After explaining the situation to Melissa, I drove to the clinic, the pain still nagging at me. The doctor ran several tests—blood work, ultrasounds, stool samples. But when it was over, she shook her head.

"Your tests are normal," she said, as she wiped the ultrasound gel from my stomach. "There’s nothing abnormal in your results."

"Are you sure?" I asked, my voice trembling with frustration. "Earlier I felt like I was dying."

"I can’t give you a diagnosis unless something comes back in the tests," she said, a frown pulling at her lips. "I'll prescribe mild painkillers for now."

I left the clinic feeling defeated, the sense of unease gnawing at the edges of my mind. **Something’s wrong. I know it.**

That night, over a quiet dinner, Melissa brought up the subject again. "My friend says our house is cursed."

I rolled my eyes. "Not this again."

"The last person who owned this house went insane," she continued, her voice low. "They say the old owner is a mambabarang."

"Nonsense," I snapped. "People around here believe in all kinds of superstitions. This house was a bargain because it’s old. That’s all."

Melissa stared at her plate, clearly unconvinced. The air between us felt thick with tension, but I didn’t press the issue. I had enough to worry about without indulging these ridiculous local myths.

The next afternoon, our visitors arrived—my friends. As they stepped into the living room, I could feel the weight of their judgment in the air, their eyes darting over the house, the mismatched furniture, the faint smell of mildew.

Britney, with her perfect hair and designer clothes, was the first to speak. "What about you, Elisa? Any exciting news?"

I straightened my back, plastering on a confident smile. "Well, I’ve started a new business. I’m making human hair wigs."

"Oh..." Britney's voice trailed off, and the polite smile on her lips barely concealed her disinterest.

"It’s a lucrative small business," I added, forcing enthusiasm into my voice. "I already have a few orders."

There was an awkward pause. Taylor, always the blunt one, leaned forward and tapped her manicured nails on the table. "Elisa, darling, is it just me, or is there noise coming from your walls?"

The room went still. My heart sank as I saw Taylor glance around with barely disguised amusement, knocking on the walls, producing a hollow sound. "Cheap construction, I’m sure. Varmints probably live between these walls."

My nerves prickled beneath my skin. I could feel their judgment like a thousand tiny cuts, sharp and insidious. "The house is vintage," I said, trying to hold onto my composure. "A little wear and tear is expected."

Suddenly, the front door flew open with a loud bang, and everyone jumped. Melissa stood in the doorway, pale and frantic, with a tall, lanky man behind her—a stranger.

"Mom, you need to listen!" she cried. "We need help!"

"Who is this?" I demanded, my voice trembling.

"This is Mr. Aguila. He’s an albularyo. He can help us!" Melissa’s voice was high-pitched, pleading.

The man stepped forward, spreading his arms wide. "The old woman who owned this house is a mambabarang. You must leave immediately, or she will complete her ritual and take your lives."

He threw a handful of something—salt?—in our direction. My friends recoiled, disgusted.

"What’s that smell?" Taylor gasped, covering her nose.

Brittney scratched her arms, her face twisted in discomfort. "We’re leaving," she announced, her voice icy. "I can’t stand this place anymore."

Taylor shot me a cold look. "We’ve been honest with you, Elisa. We don’t want to associate with someone… well, someone like you. Not anymore." Her words hit like a slap. "Now that you’re not with Derrick, you don’t fit in our circle."

They grabbed their bags and left without another word, their heels clicking against the floor as they walked out the door and into their expensive cars.

I stood there, shaking, tears stinging my eyes. **What just happened?**

I stood frozen at the door, watching my so-called friends drive away, their expensive cars disappearing into the night. The reality of my situation hit me hard. **I’m alone.** The tears welled up, but my body was too numb to let them fall. Then I felt a gentle hand on my shoulder.

“Mom, I’m so sorry,” Melissa whispered, her voice shaking with regret. She tried to comfort me, but something inside me snapped.

Rage surged through me like a tidal wave, drowning any sense of reason. **This is all her fault.** My vision tunneled as I spun around, gripping Melissa by the wrist. “Get out!” I screamed at her and the albularyo, my voice cracking. “You humiliated me in front of everyone! You’ve crossed the line!”

The old man raised his hands, trying to speak, but I wouldn’t let him. “I don’t want to hear any more of this nonsense about curses and witches. Get out of my house!” I roared.

Melissa’s eyes brimmed with tears as she flinched from my words, her small frame trembling. “Go to your room!” I shouted, dragging her toward her door. “I don’t want to see you until you’re ready to apologize for everything!”

I slammed the door behind her and collapsed onto the couch, the weight of my emotions pressing down on me. My heart pounded in my chest, my breaths coming in ragged gasps. I buried my face in my hands, too exhausted to cry, too angry to think clearly. Slowly, the house fell silent around me, the events of the day swirling in my mind like a storm I couldn’t escape.

At some point, I drifted into a dreamless sleep, the exhaustion finally overtaking me.

I woke to a freezing breeze. The door was wide open, and the cold wind howled through the house. I bolted upright, confused and disoriented. **How long had I been asleep?**

Moonlight streamed through the windows, casting long, eerie shadows across the dimly lit hallway. The house felt colder, more oppressive, as I wandered through it, my footsteps echoing in the emptiness.

Suddenly, a bone-chilling cackle filled the air, followed by the sound of anguished screams. **Melissa.** Adrenaline surged through me as I sprinted down the hall toward her room. My mind raced, but nothing could have prepared me for the sight that awaited me on the other side of her door.

Melissa lay in bed, her body contorted in a grotesque position, her eyes wild with terror. Her hands clawed at her stomach, where her skin rippled and moved unnaturally. Blood oozed from deep scratches, pooling beneath her. "Mom!" she shrieked, her voice barely human, more animal than girl. "It’s inside me! Help!"

I rushed to her side, but as I reached for her, she convulsed violently. Her nails tore at her own flesh, ripping through her skin until her belly split open with a sickening squelch. My stomach lurched as hundreds of cockroaches spilled out, pouring from her insides, their tiny bodies writhing over the bed, the floor, and finally, my hands.

I screamed, backing away in horror as Melissa’s body went limp, her face frozen in a twisted mask of pain and anguish. Her skin turned pale, her body stiffening in death, but the cockroaches kept coming—an endless wave of filth and decay.

**This isn’t real. It can’t be real.** My mind refused to accept the nightmare unfolding before me. I stumbled backward, nearly slipping on the slick floor. My body shook with uncontrollable sobs as I collapsed against the wall.

Then I heard it—the sound of movement from beneath the floorboards. Slow, deliberate footsteps. Something was coming.

The vent cover in the bathroom clattered to the floor, the metallic sound echoing through the house. The footsteps quickened, growing louder, heading straight for me.

**Run. Run!**

I scrambled to my feet, but before I could take a step, an invisible force slammed into me. I was flung across the room, my body crashing against the wall with a sickening thud. My vision blurred as blood dripped from my head, and I struggled to stay conscious.

Through the haze, I saw her. Mrs. Maluk, the old woman who had sold me the house, stood at the foot of the stairs, her small, hunched frame illuminated by the moonlight. Her disheveled appearance was even more grotesque now—her skin sagging in loose folds, her eyes glowing with malice.

She cackled, her rotten teeth clattering in her mouth as she approached me. “Did you think you could escape?” she hissed, her voice like nails on a chalkboard. “This house is mine. You… you belong to me now.”

I tried to move, but my body was too weak, my muscles limp from shock and blood loss. Mrs. Maluk leaned down, her face inches from mine, her breath hot and foul against my skin. With one gnarled hand, she gripped my jaw, forcing my mouth open.

Then, from the pocket of her ragged dress, she pulled out a handful of squirming cockroaches, her crooked fingers pushing them toward my face. “Open wide,” she crooned, her voice dripping with malice. “They’re hungry…”

I screamed, but no sound escaped as she forced the cockroaches into my mouth. Their legs scratched against the inside of my cheeks, their bodies writhing down my throat as I gagged, choking on the taste of rot and decay. My vision dimmed, the world fading to black as Mrs. Maluk’s laughter echoed in my ears.
