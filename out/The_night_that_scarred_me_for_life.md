The night that scarred me, and haunts me forever.

The night started 4 years ago. I was working the night shift for a random laundry place, from 12 AM to 6 AM. It was a particularly large space, around 4,000 square feet. There's a cafe above the place, usually empty (since nobody's ever heard of it). There are 3 to 4 cameras placed in the place. Usually, there's nobody washing their clothes at night, because who washes their clothes at night? 

&#x200B;

Anyways, it was March 19th. It was a rainy night, the rain wasn't too hard, and wasn't too light. I was watching the cameras, nobody was inside the place. And I decided to lie down for a little. The power then went out for a little. Of course, it startled me, so I checked the cameras. And I saw a damn person standing, staring at an empty washing machine. Of course, I walked over there, to discover that there was not a single person there. Not even a damn insect.

So I was scared to fucking shit because it was just *there*. I walked wearily back to the camera room, and there it was. The thing that scared me. Someone else crying. Wasn't the same person, no. It was a different person in different clothes. And they were crying, not terrified crying, *mourning crying*. Like they were crying because someone **died**. They looked back at me like they knew I was watching. 

I came to figure out that it was a woman, and when she stared me down, looking at the camera, she stopped crying. Not where she was calming down, no. Just a blank expression. And then she disappeared. Ceased to be visible. After that, it was just a fuckfest of power outages, crying heard, and even screams from the upstairs cafeteria (which was CLOSED mind you). It was at this point considering calling the fucking police when I decided it was just my imagination. I hadn't smoked any weed since, I dunno, since June? I'll keep you guys updated/posted.

\[UPDATE\] Hey, lookie here, someone RATIONAL and NOT FUCKING CRYING came in to load a couple of clothes.

"Hey, did you hear the screams and the crying?", I asked the man.

"What screams? You must be hallucinating, given your drug-using appearance", the dickhead replied.

He then left after 10 minutes or so. I'll update you later.

\[UPDATE\] After that, I tried to keep it off my mind, but that face, that FUCKING FACE. How it went from fucking grieving to blank in a matter of a few seconds. 15 minutes later, it's 2:22 AM. The same girl is back. Crying. Fucking. Crying. She turned back. The same transition. Grieving to blank. And then the same fucking guy. Comes in to wash his clothes.

"I thought you already washed your clothes?", I asked the man.

"What screams? You must be hallucinating, given your drug-using appearance", the dickhead replied.

He then left after 10 minutes or so.

\[UPDATE\] After that, I tried to keep it off my mind, but that face, that FUCKING FACE. How it went from fucking grieving to blank in a matter of a few seconds. 15 minutes later, it's 2:38 AM. The same girl is back. Crying. Fucking. Crying. She turned back. The same transition. Grieving to blank. And then the same fucking guy. Comes in to wash his clothes.

\[UPDATE\] After that, I tried to keep it off my mind, but that face, that FUCKING FACE. How it went from fucking grieving to blank in a matter of a few seconds. 15 minutes later, it's 2:53 AM. The same girl is back. Crying. Fucking. Crying. She turned back. The same transition. Grieving to blank. And then the same fucking guy. Comes in to wash his clothes.

\[UPDATE\] HOLY SHIT, holy shit fuck fuck shit fuck shit, I did NOT realize that. I must have blacked out. Ok, here's what I remember. (sorry if it's pretty bad spelling, I'm on the phone). I fucking updated once, that's what I recall. I checked the time, it was 3:08 AM, and a guy just walked in to wash a load, I'll ask him something, gonna update later in a few minutes.

\[UPDATE\] It's 3:23 AM, and the girl came back later, and it was the same fucking expression on her face. Grieving to blank. Anyways, I think I'll go home now, so I'll drive back, I'll update you in a few minutes.

\[UPDATE\] I just got home guys, and I think I'll have some trouble falling asleep after the FUCKFEST of a night I just had. I have a hell of a night shift tomorrow though, so I doubt I'll not get enough sleep.

Anyways, I'll most likely not be back, because I have a night shift tomorrow, March 19th. The worst day to work because I had plans to go on vacation. I'll work this out, maybe. I dunno, I'll just maybe post another time.
