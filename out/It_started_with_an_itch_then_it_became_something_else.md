It started with an itch, the kind you dismiss as a stray irritant or the side effect of a poorly washed shirt. Nothing serious, just a vague discomfort on my forearm that I could scratch away without a second thought. By the next day, though, that itch had spread, snaking its way up my arm in patches that seemed to appear and vanish like ghostly bruises. When I looked closer, I saw faint outlines, almost like impressions beneath my skin, lines that seemed too precise to be random.

As the hours passed, I became acutely aware of that crawling, tingling sensation, as if something was squirming right under the surface, trailing like whispered secrets I couldn’t ignore. I forced myself to laugh about it, though the unease was already beginning to curl in my stomach. My friends joked that it was probably a new allergy or the side effect of too much late-night junk food. But this wasn’t an allergy—I knew that. It was something else entirely, something I couldn’t easily explain away.

By the end of the day, I found myself instinctively covering the patches with my sleeves, hoping no one would notice how much I was scratching. There was no rash, nothing visible that should have made the itching so unbearable, but the irritation was constant, almost hypnotic in its persistence. And then, as I stood in front of my bathroom mirror that evening, rolling up my sleeve to inspect the strange marks, I noticed something far worse.

The skin on my forearm seemed… uneven. Beneath it, as I pressed gently with my fingers, I could feel tiny bumps, like grains of sand shifting beneath the surface. My mind instantly jumped to all the horror stories I’d ever heard about parasites, though I dismissed it as soon as the thought arrived. But I couldn’t deny the physical reality, couldn’t brush away the sensation that something was undeniably, horrifyingly wrong.

That night, as I lay in bed, trying not to scratch, I felt that subtle shifting again, like a ripple running through the skin of my arm. It was slight, barely more than a whisper against my senses, but it was there, undeniable. I lay motionless, eyes wide open, feeling the unwelcome activity beneath my skin, a silent protest against sleep.

In a fit of desperation, I’d slathered on every ointment I could find, hoping it might soothe whatever was festering beneath. But as I closed my eyes, willing myself to ignore the sensation, a single thought began to gnaw at the edges of my mind: *What if it’s not just in my arm? What if it’s spreading?*

The itch, I realized, wasn’t just an annoyance anymore. It was a warning—a signal that something within me had started, and I had no idea how to make it stop.

The itch had spread by morning. What began as a single patch on my forearm had now crept up to my shoulder and down to my wrist. Each area tingled with an unnerving sensation, like ants crawling just beneath the skin, tracing invisible pathways along my nerves. I spent breakfast awkwardly holding my coffee mug, trying not to let my family see how much I was scratching. I could still hear my sister’s voice from the night before, mocking me for “imagining things” and “being paranoid.” But this was beyond imagination. The bumps under my skin were real.

I tried my best to avoid mirrors that morning, but the bathroom one caught me off guard as I reached for my toothbrush. My reflection stared back with dark, hollow eyes, evidence of a sleepless night spent tossing and turning. The skin on my forearm had taken on a strange, dull tone, slightly bruised and sunken where the itch was strongest. I pressed down on the spot again, feeling the telltale grit of tiny lumps shifting beneath the surface. They felt more distinct today, as if they had grown overnight, settling into my skin with a sickening permanence.

During my lunch break, I finally gave in to the impulse to Google my symptoms. Each result was worse than the last—nerve disorders, rare skin diseases, parasitic infections. My stomach churned with dread, but I couldn’t stop reading, hypnotized by the horrifying possibilities. In the back of my mind, I tried to rationalize it away. Maybe it was stress? My job had been piling on the pressure lately, and I’d barely had a decent night’s sleep in weeks. But even as I thought this, I knew it was a weak excuse. Nothing about stress explained the feeling of something moving, something *alive*, beneath my skin.

By afternoon, the sensation had evolved. It was no longer just an itch; it was an almost rhythmic pulse, as though whatever was under my skin was slowly waking up, becoming aware. I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was probing, seeking something within me. When I wasn’t scratching, I was pressing my fingers against the bumps, trying to understand what they were. But each time, they slipped and shifted away from my touch, evading me like shadows under the skin.

As the day dragged on, the anxiety began to bleed into every part of me. I found myself barely focusing at work, my mind consumed with the alien presence in my own body. Colleagues cast worried glances my way, but I ignored them, unwilling to explain. Who would believe me? That I felt things crawling under my skin? I barely believed it myself.

I left work early, ignoring the concerned expressions of my manager and the odd questions from friends. As soon as I got home, I headed straight to the bathroom, rolling up my sleeve with a trembling hand. The patches of uneven skin had spread even further, branching like the veins in a leaf. It was now unmistakably clear that they were following a pattern, some kind of system that only they understood.

Unable to resist, I took a needle and carefully pressed it to the skin of my forearm, hoping that a small puncture might release whatever was trapped inside. The prick stung, and a bead of blood welled up, but nothing more. Frustrated, I pressed harder, trying to dig deeper, feeling the pressure build as I forced the needle further. But instead of relief, I felt a sharp, searing pain rip through my arm, and the skin buckled under my touch, pulsing in angry protest. I pulled the needle away, horrified, realizing I was only making it worse.

I sank onto the bathroom floor, clutching my arm, my mind racing. Whatever was beneath my skin, it didn’t want to be disturbed.

I couldn’t go to work the next day. The moment I tried to put on a shirt, the rough fabric brushed against my arm, igniting the sensation into a maddening fury. Every nerve seemed on edge, every inch of skin prickling with the unnatural movement underneath. It was as if my own body was rebelling, each patch of skin tightening over the hidden lumps as they shifted and pulsed.

I spent the morning in bed, sleeves rolled up, staring in morbid fascination as the trails of tiny lumps spread across my arm, weaving along my veins. The sight was dizzying. The tiny, gritty bumps beneath my skin were following a path, creating a map only they understood. I felt helpless, staring at my own body as it transformed into something unrecognizable. I was no longer just “me”—I was becoming their host, my skin their shelter, my body their prison.

Around noon, I heard my phone buzz on the bedside table. It was a message from my sister, checking in after our conversation the previous night. I couldn’t bring myself to answer. How could I explain that what I’d tried to brush off as a skin irritation had become a full-blown infestation? I couldn’t even say the words to myself. Instead, I turned off the phone, cutting myself off from anyone who might try to reach out. This was mine to face, alone.

The hours dragged on, and the daylight began to dim outside. I lay still, paralyzed by fear and a morbid fascination, unable to tear my gaze from the gradual spread of the patches across my skin. I was half-caught in a trance, a waking nightmare that felt both surreal and inescapable. With every pulse, the bumps moved, shifting in sync with the beat of my own heart. They seemed to understand me in a way that was unnerving, as though each beat was their cue, each pause their signal.

The itching had dulled, replaced by something else—a raw, aching feeling as though my skin was being stretched from the inside. I ran my fingers along my arm, feeling the uneven texture beneath my touch, the lines and patches that had become almost a network. With a grim determination, I resolved to find out what they were, to confront whatever I had allowed to take root inside me.

Grabbing a small utility knife from my bedside drawer, I took a deep breath. My hand trembled, but I steadied it, pressing the blade just above one of the larger bumps on my forearm. A quick, shallow slice. Blood welled immediately, a thin line of red, but beyond the pain, I felt nothing else—no release, no dislodging of whatever was beneath. I wiped the blood away with a tissue, squinting as I tried to catch a glimpse of anything unusual within the shallow cut.

And then, as if in response, the bump under the skin moved. Slowly, it shifted just out of reach, retreating deeper, avoiding the light and the blade, evading me. My stomach turned, a nauseating wave washing over me. It was alive. A living thing, crawling just beneath my skin, aware of my attempts to remove it.

I stumbled back, clutching my arm, horror clawing up my throat as I realized the full extent of what was happening. Whatever was inside me, it wasn’t some random irritation, some easily excised intruder. It was something intelligent, something that knew how to evade, how to survive. I looked down, breathing shallow, watching the faint pulse beneath the surface, the outline of its path, winding its way along my arm and toward my shoulder.

The creeping sensation resumed, stronger now, winding through my skin like roots sinking into soil, spreading with a mind of its own.

I barely slept that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt the thing inside me moving, pulsing in time with my heart, twisting beneath the skin as though it was carving out its territory, claiming its host. My dreams were fevered flashes, glimpses of crawling shadows, of roots and tendrils winding their way through dark soil. And each time I jolted awake, that crawling, pressing sensation was there, more pronounced, as if the thing had grown while I slept, as if it had waited for my moments of weakness to sink deeper.

By morning, the transformation was undeniable. My skin had taken on a translucent pallor, faint veins crisscrossing in unnatural patterns. The bumps had spread down my forearm and up my shoulder, each one connected in a network of winding lines, an intricate web that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. I could no longer pretend this was something that could be explained or ignored. Whatever this was, it was taking me over, using my own body as a canvas to display its growth.

Desperation drove me to reach out, to find someone, anyone, who might know what was happening. I thumbed through my contacts until I found an old professor from university, Dr. Talbot, who had once taught a course on rare skin conditions and parasites. I hadn’t spoken to him in years, but the memory of his meticulous knowledge, his almost obsessive fascination with the peculiarities of human biology, pushed me to call. My voice was ragged, edged with panic as I explained my symptoms.

When I finished, there was a long pause, then a low, measured reply. “This…sounds unlike anything I’ve encountered, but it resembles certain parasitic infections. A rare few are known to mimic the patterns of the host’s nervous or circulatory system. If it’s following a path, it might be attempting to synchronize with you—perhaps even taking on your body’s blueprint.”

His words only intensified my dread. Synchronizing? Taking on my body’s blueprint? My grip tightened on the phone as I fought back the urge to scream. “How…how do I stop it?”

“I can’t say,” he replied, his tone eerily calm. “But I know one thing: most organisms that invade a host need something from them. Nutrients, control, even full integration. If this thing is synchronizing with you, it may be trying to merge in a way that cannot be undone. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove it.”

After hanging up, I found myself staring blankly at my arm, which felt less and less like it belonged to me. His words echoed in my mind—*integration, merge, host.* The implications rattled me to my core, an awareness that I was losing control not just of my arm, but of my very identity. I was becoming something else.

I grabbed my keys and stumbled out of my apartment, searching for answers or help or anything that might stop this. The sunlight felt harsh on my skin, each step sending waves of heat through my body, an unwelcome reminder that whatever was inside me seemed to thrive on my discomfort, feeding off the fear and pain that coiled inside. I headed to the nearest clinic, hoping a doctor might offer some concrete, medical explanation, something rational and fixable.

In the sterile brightness of the examination room, I showed the physician my arm, rolling up my sleeve with a resigned dread. Her face paled, eyes widening as she took in the web of bumps and lines, the undeniable network of trails tracing across my skin. She tried to hide her reaction, but I saw the flash of unease as she hesitated, as though unsure where to even begin.

“We might need to run some tests,” she murmured, but her voice sounded distant, as if I were underwater, hearing her through layers of fog. I watched as she examined my skin with gloved hands, her expression carefully blank. She pressed lightly along the bumps, and I felt that sickening shift beneath my skin, the creature—or creatures—moving away from her touch as though defiant, aware of the intrusion.

“Are you experiencing any…mental effects?” she asked, her words unnervingly cautious.

I hesitated, considering what to say. How could I explain the whispers that lingered in my mind, the strange, unsettling connection I was beginning to feel with the thing beneath my skin? It was no longer just a parasite or a disease. I could feel it now, pressing not only against my nerves but against my very thoughts, settling into the edges of my consciousness. I realized, with a shiver of horror, that it wasn’t just feeding on my body; it was feeding on my mind, integrating itself in ways I hadn’t thought possible.

I met the doctor’s gaze, but before I could answer, the creature moved again, this time with a distinct purpose, stretching along my arm and creeping toward my chest. The sensation was stronger, more insistent, as if it knew I was seeking help, as if it were tightening its hold. I gasped, the air seizing in my lungs as the realization crashed over me: it didn’t want to leave. It was fighting back, cementing its hold, rooting itself deeper.

In a final, desperate surge, I tried to push the creature back, pressing hard against my skin, willing it to recede, to give me some control. But the effort only seemed to strengthen it, each pulse intensifying, until the creature’s movements settled into a steady, relentless rhythm—matching the beat of my own heart, synchronizing.

I stumbled out of the clinic, numb and exhausted, feeling my body slipping from my grasp, one inch at a time. The world blurred around me, sounds fading into a thick, buzzing murmur. Somewhere behind me, the doctor’s voice drifted out, muffled and distant, like it was sinking beneath water: *“Wait, we need to… it could be dangerous…”* But her words dissolved into the haze, swallowed by the relentless, pulsing rhythm crawling through my veins, drowning out everything else.

As I walked home, I could sense it fully now, its presence growing stronger, not just in my arm, but in my mind. It was learning me, molding me, transforming me from the inside out.

By the time I reached my door, I knew, deep down, that I was no longer alone in my own skin. Whatever it was, it was there to stay.

That night, as I lay in bed, the final thread of hope unraveled. The creature had embedded itself so deeply that my body no longer felt like mine. Every movement, every heartbeat, every breath felt heavy and foreign, as if I were merely a shell that it inhabited. The skin on my arm and shoulder was now discolored and swollen, an angry, bruised landscape where the thing had claimed its domain. It looked sickly, bloated and taut, veins stretched to their limit and crisscrossing in unnatural directions.

The itching sensation had vanished entirely, replaced by a thick, pulsing ache. My skin felt too tight, like something was building pressure beneath the surface, straining to break free. I couldn’t resist anymore. I needed to see the full extent of its invasion. Moving slowly, I peeled my shirt away, exposing my shoulder and upper chest, where the network of bumps and lines had spread. The creature’s presence pulsed in time with my heart, a foreign rhythm that matched my own, yet somehow felt independent, like an echo that shouldn’t exist.

With trembling hands, I touched the swollen patch on my chest, feeling the unnatural warmth radiate from beneath. The skin was stretched to a grotesque degree, almost translucent, as if it were thinning out, dissolving into something weaker, more penetrable. I leaned in closer to the mirror, watching the faint, rippling movements under the surface. And then, to my horror, I saw it—a slick, sickly glint of something dark and oily, shifting just beneath the skin, oozing and coiling like thick, viscous sludge.

Unable to stop myself, I dug my nails into the taut skin, pulling until it broke. The pain was sharp and immediate, but my horror and curiosity overpowered the agony. I tore at the opening, and as the skin gave way, something thick and mucous-like began to seep out. It was dark, almost black, with a sickly green hue under the bathroom light, and it carried a smell so foul it felt like a punch to the senses—a mix of rotting meat and decay, something ancient and foul that had no business being inside a living human.

The substance pooled on the surface of my skin, thick and syrupy, like tar. It clung to my fingers, trailing in viscous strings as I tried to wipe it away, only for more to seep out, spilling from the wound like an infection brought to life. I stumbled back, gasping, as the creature within me seemed to react, shifting and writhing with a newfound aggression, as though angered by my attempt to purge it.

Then, from the open wound, something far worse emerged. Tiny, translucent tendrils began to poke through, curling outward like roots seeking soil. Each tendril was thin and wormlike, with a sickening wet sheen that glistened under the light. They wriggled, twisting and curling, exploring the air as if tasting their surroundings, seeking something beyond the confines of my body.

In a fit of panic, I slapped my hand over the wound, pressing hard to stop the flow, to force those writhing things back inside. But they continued to push against my hand, stretching and straining, their thin, squirming lengths winding between my fingers, slithering over my knuckles, searching. I could feel them coiling around my hand, cold and damp, with a texture that felt somewhere between slime and rot. My vision blurred with horror, but I couldn’t stop looking, couldn’t tear myself away from the monstrous sight unfolding on my own body.

With a growing sense of dread, I noticed something new—small, tooth-like structures forming at the ends of each tendril. Tiny, needle-thin spines, sharp and white, poked out from the ends, flexing as though testing their strength. And then, before I could pull my hand away, one of the tendrils latched onto my skin, its spines sinking in with a sickening prick. I gasped, feeling the sting as it burrowed into my flesh, anchoring itself to me. It began to pulse, pulling itself deeper, its body stretching and elongating as it forced its way under my skin.

I could feel each movement, each invasive push as it dug deeper, the sensation raw and visceral, a throbbing agony that burned through me. More tendrils followed, each one latching on, digging in with their needle-like teeth, burrowing beneath my hand, winding up my arm, creating a lattice of pain that seemed to spread in all directions. I tried to pull them off, but they were rooted firmly, part of me now, merging with my skin, my muscles, fusing in a grotesque symbiosis.

The creature was no longer content to hide beneath the surface. It was emerging, claiming me from the inside out, leaving no part of me untouched. I could feel it seeping through every cell, binding to my bones, spreading through my veins like a dark, invasive rot. And with each tendril that burrowed deeper, I could feel a change in my mind as well—a dull, creeping sense of surrender, as though the thing inside me was whispering, coaxing, merging its thoughts with mine.

I could no longer remember what it felt like to be just *me*.
