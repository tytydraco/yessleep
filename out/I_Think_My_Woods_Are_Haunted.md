2, almost 3 years ago, I moved into a quaint little farm house that sits on about 15 acres of land. The house was build in the early '80s, and is quite active for spirits, leading me to believe it is some form of portal between the mortal realm, and the dead. Most of this property is wooded, and it is quite beautiful. However, in the woods, a little bit off the trail used for hunting, there's a building that is a shed or cottage of sorts. This building looks old, older than the house, built maybe a decade prior?  
  
There is nothing particularly odd or unsettling about it at first glance, but if I walked between 5 - 10 feet of it, I got dizzy spells, and started feeling very faint, even passing out a couple times. For that reason I would never go in the wooded area alone, out of fear I might pass out and nobody find me. One night about 8 months ago, I was in the wooded area with a friend, and I saw somebody circling the building. I looked to my friend and pointed to the person, asking them who it was. My friend looked at me puzzled, and told me that there was nobody there.  
  
This chilled me to the core, because I know I can see otherworldly beings, such as ghosts and demonic entities, but they don't usually look just as solid as you and me. Normally they have a slight glow and transparency to them, but this one didn't. I grabbed my friend and ran out of the woods, panicked. We didn't go in the woods the rest of the time they were at my home.  
  
A couple days later however, I decided to venture into the woods to investigate the being. It was around Midnight, so it was quite dark outside. I went to where the building was, and there she was. I'm not quite sure who she is, but she stands between the height of 5'10 and 6'. She had silky black hair that stopped around her hips. She was unnaturally pale, and wore a dress or nightgown, that went down to her ankles.  
  
She seemed to be calling out for a child, I got a little unsettled, be cause the name she was calling out was the nickname I've had since my toddler years. At first I thought it may have been a coincidence, but then I saw what she was holding. It was a plushie that I'd had since birth, and still have to this day, it's my comfort item, so that really unsettled me. I mustered up courage to say "Hello?" to her, and she just stared at me. Blankly.  
  
I then made the very stupid mistake of stepping too close to the building, being about 7 or 8 feet away from it. It was as if she had gained a conscious, and she lunged for me. I had never been so scared in my life. I bolted out of the woods, in a panic, gaining multiple scars on my arms and face from tearing through the area blindly. as I reached the clearing and got out of the wooded area, I turned around heavy breathing, and bleeding from cuts and scrapes. She stood there at the tree line, and then just vanished. It was as if she'd not been there at all.  
  
I moved out of the house about 2 months ago, but even the mere thought of seeing that thing again sends a wave of chills and dizzy spells throughout me.
