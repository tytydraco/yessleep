I am occasionally on here to look for leads, for my second under the table job but right now I am at my wits end.  Halloween is always the worst for my line of work and it is just a prelude to the most depressing part of my year, the holiday season. For the love of all that is normal and not FUBAR’ed take note.   
  
I see all the popular tales here like lists and rules. So I have a list for you, hopefully it will at least keep a few of you or your family members from showing up in my work queue.  
  
I get it! its Halloween and we like creepy things to decorate with and have our parties,  those of you who haven’t already killed your family and friends accidently by being a moron that is. Get your decorations for these parties from Dollar tree, Dollar General, Walmart,  the cheaper the better.  No one curses items in a plastic mold injection plant, no demonic entity (or someones soul ridden by one) would get past its ego enough to go into anything under a Target.   
If you must be the original one on your block, the queen of the street. Sure go to those antique junk malls and consignment stores.  It’s your ass.  If you do shop at these places.... The Rule lists.

  
Books to liven up your living room..  
1.	If you cant even tell what language or what the letter are for the book,  put it the hell down.  
2.	If you cant read the book, put it the hell down.  
3.	If you cant read all the stuff written in the margins put it the hell down.  
4.	If the grammar or spelling is off but you cant put your finger on how or why, put it the hell down.  
5.	If you cant read it at first but then it gets better and you can start to read parts, put it the hell down,  
6.	If you cant tell what artisanal material the cover or pages are made of, put it the hell down. Heres a hint, probably someone just like you.  
7.	If the ink is an odd dark brown color…. Put it the hell down  
  
Creepy ass dolls… Do we really need a list here??  Just get a plastic one and have your purse Chihuahua, or your closest friends, to chew on it for a while to get it that “distressed” look you so crave.  
1.	Avoid anything old and porcelain.  I mean  these aren’t the big problem, like ever, in fact I haven’t run into any “Annabelle’s” or “Chuckys”  Ive only met one other tech who thinks it was a doll. The big thing is you want to avoid anything with human hair.  Porcelain , plastic,  they are all too fragile for enchantment  even for base annoying cursed  bullshit much less major , so just  stay away from anything with nonplastic hair.  Its when you add human parts to ANYTHING that things can get messed up.

  
House Décor	.  
1.	Wood should be okay as long as it isn’t all inlaid with metal  or bound in iron.   Woods another of those materials that channels great,  but really doesn’t hold a charge that well.   
2.	Ok anything that might be bone, horn, skin, or hair fiber I would stay away from.  
3.	Anything with “authentic” old native looking beadwork, stay away from it.  
4.	Anything that rattles,  especially if it is a rattle or maraca.  You don’t want to know the reason why, just trust me.  
5.	Candles,  just get them from the grocery store,   DON’T get them from a secondhand place, please.  
  
The more I write this I just realize it is all common sense.  So many people don’t even think about what goes bump in the night, or about how other people who aren’t very nice make really crappy things and then die and those things get sold at estate sales and storage auctions down the line.  I mean this list above just covers my last 2 weeks. and I have months of work to do to trace provenace on these items to see if there are other landmines out there in other dirtmalls.  So just don't look for the creepy stuff in consignment stores or antique malls.  It looks creepy for a reason,  its like a growling pit bull, or a hissing cat or a Karen asking for your manager.  That instinct you have of "danger, dont touch!!"  Please listen to it. The stuff in the stores is fake scary  the stuff in the antiques stores, well its hard to tell if its fake scary  or evil scary out of context.  
  
One last thing have a cat and a dog.  Show them your finds at the store

1. If they are both cool with it  you are OK
2. If the dog freaks out and the cat freaks out throw it away.  
3. If your dog freaks out and the cat seems interested go on amazon and look for holy cross wrapping paper,  wrap it up in that and get rid of it in the trash.
4.  If the dog and cat wont go into the room with it and they just stare at the door or entry of what room you have it in,  try to throw it away. 

If circumstance and odd reasons keep you from being able to get rid of it , get a priest.  If you cant even get it out of the room you put it in,  pray its bound to the house, and move . If that works then some sad sack like me will end up having to deal with it down the line ,  but at least this way I don’t have to clean your bloated dead asses up at the same time(My Day Job BTW).  If you move and it comes with you,  well best advice I have it to get a tent and get as far into nature with it as you can.

At least that way when it ends you in the middle of nowhere hopefully the animals with have dealt with all the tissue before someone manages to find you. Hell, get far enough out and maybe, just maybe whatever has gotten a hold of you might not make it back to civilization or get lost hard enough to not bother anyone ever again.
