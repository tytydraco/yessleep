\*\*

I don't know what I was thinking, leaving my car at the house. I wasn't thinking, I guess is the answer. Coming up out of that basement, seeing that lunch meat on the counter again, now at least a dozen flies swarming around it, I did a double take when I realized the "Carl" in Carl Buddig was circled in red, five sloppy lines crisscrossing it in a weird lunchtime approximation of a pentagram. This is gas station-grade meat, but it's the stuff Sami and I grew up on: crappy white bread, yellow mustard and this translucent, thinly shaved flesh. My friend Jamrod (don't ask) was over for lunch one day in fifth grade, and when he saw this stuff, he coined the regrettable nickname that haunted me until High School - "Buddig," as in, "Did anyone call Buddig for practice?" or "That chick digs you, Buddig. Show her your meat!"

Yeah, I never found it funny, either. Seeing the juxtaposition between my name and this industrial offal again in our kitchen, my previous idea of some makeshift suburban ritual came back to me.

Were my parents trying to sacrifice me through cold cuts?

My head filled with tiny Dads in Hell and roast beef pentagrams, maybe you can see why I walked out of the house and down the street in a daze. All these eerie, ridiculous ideas flooded my brain, and I guess I slipped into some kind of fugue, walked to the gas station and called Sami. I even went inside and bought a pack of cigarettes - that's how fucked up I felt, 'cuz I hadn't smoked in almost two years.

Cole's Honda appeared a few minutes later, and it wasn't until we pulled into Cole's driveway that I started to come back to myself.

"What happened?" Sami asked. "Did you talk to them? Did you talk to Mom?"

"Yeah, I… I think maybe Dad's in Hell."

"Dad's dead?"

"No. Well, I don't know. He didn't seem dead. He seemed… in over his head. There's some kind of portal in the cave now. It looked like a window into Hell."

"Wait, what? Are you being serious right now?"

"Unfortunately, yes," I said, stepping from the car and lighting a cigarette. I quit two years ago, but this shit? My nerves begged me for a nicotine lifeline.

"So you saw into Hell?"

"Yeah. I mean, I think so."

"What did you see?"

"Dad."

In over his head was apparently a recurring theme in our father's life; he'd gotten away from the cult once, rebuilt his life, and then fallen for the same shit all over again. I wasn't sure there was anything we could do for him, and what's more, I wasn't entirely sure I wanted to put my ass on the line. The thought of just packing up and never coming back sounded pretty fucking good right about then. Only, if I am being completely honest, it might have felt easy to turn my back on Dad, but other *associated* concerns… not so much. 

The big one was the house, but there was also the question of whether we might be owed any money through inheritance. I mean, if he was dead or whatever. I know, I know. That's pretty shitty, but it's true. I wasn't exactly burning up the Dean's list at school; I'd waffled on declaring a major and honestly feared the price tag of even two more years of 'higher education.' I wasn't really good at *anything*, and I didn't have much ambition past playing the guitar, a pretty shitty dream when half the bands I listen to still hold down day jobs. I mean, last I heard, Matt Pike still tended bar when not on tour with Sleep or High on Fire; that alone scared the living shit out of me. 

"Hopefully this doesn't make you hate me, Sami, but do you ever think about, like, when Dad goes, will we get anything?"

Sami looked at me with something akin to pity.

"Carl, that's awful."

"It is, no doubt. But, ya know, our lives have been so… slipshod. I mean, how am I *not* supposed to hope for a pot of gold after they're gone? Well, after Dad's gone. I doubt Mom has any money if she's back with the cult."

"I don't know about that," Cole cut in. "You did notice the car she parked in your driveway was a Tesla, right?"

I had not noticed this, probably because the only Tesla I'd ever seen in person was that stupid cyber truck that looked like a dumpster on wheels.

"Wait, a Tesla? Are you sure?"

"Yeah. It's a Model X. So she's got more money than most people in this town."

\*\*

Mom driving a Tesla. I couldn't get over it. Truth to tell, I couldn't get over the idea that maybe there was something here for me, ya know, further down the line. 

The word 'Windfall" came to mind.

Forced to face the fact that I'm the kind of guy who hopes to become rich when his parents kick it, my worldview began to change. A self-identified pessimist, I still managed to justify my shitty attitude. Everyone has to fight to find their place in the world, but Sami and I had it a little tougher than a lot of our peers. I knew kids who'd grown up with divorced parents, drug-addicted parents, one kid in my graduating class's Dad had killed three people in an attempted burglary… the list of fucked up shit went on. Our parents, though, were "seated at his right hand, extinguishing flies."

What the fuck did that mean, and *was there any money in it?* Who had paid for that Tesla? The proverbial "Him?" Was that the cult leader or Satan himself?

Does Satan have pronouns? His? Its? Their?

I tried reading the grimoire I'd snagged from the Satan Cave, but nothing in its pages made sense. A lot of gnarly drawings of what I took to be demons, some text in Latin or some other dead language. Diagrams of shapes that made me feel funny when I looked at them for too long.

One page in particular really struck an invisible chord with me. I didn't know the words, but staring at them made me flash on something Uncle Leo had said about the Church of the First Process. I made a note to head back to his place for another pow-wow. People in cults often referred to them as churches, right?

Speaking of which, it was now December 24th, and another cult leader's birthday was upon us. I knew Leo would be out driving. No way he would pass up triple-time holiday pay. 

We told Cole's parents that our folks were going through a rough patch and they were cool with me crashing their festivities. In fact, once Cole's Dad heard about our connection to Leo, he made it his mission to be my new best friend.

"Enough of that Mr. O'Brien shit, Carl. Call me Graham."

Graham had Ozzy's face tattooed on one forearm and Ronnie James' on the other, and he owned a Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin shirt for every day of the week. It was a little much, even for me, but he insisted I could stay in the basement as long as I needed, so I shut my mouth and played along. Sami stayed upstairs with Cole, but the more we talked about the situation, the more I sensed she was trying to put her head down and keep the senior-year blinders on. Four months and some change and she was out of High School and heading overseas. I felt utterly alone; I still had some friends in the area, but the thing with having been a dealer is it's not always a good idea to associate with people from your past. I hung out with Graham in the basement, listening to records and getting high. In this way, Christmas came and went. Fa La La La La.

I did a little poking around online and found some interesting things about a similarly named Process Church of the Final Judgment, but nothing to connect it to what Leo had told us about. Reading up on this, though, my hackles came up; everything online about the latter organization regarded its ties to the Son of Sam killings in late 70s New York. I started having nightmares about a black Doberman coming at me with a butterfly knife. The dog wore high heels and a leather jacket with a large, newsprint-looking patch on the back that said "Cult of the Final Process," with an airbrushed rendering of what looked like Jon Lovitz in his famous devil costume from 80s SNL.

After two nights of the same dream, I asked Graham if he would drive me over to Leo's to check if he was off the road yet. Turned out he'd never left.

\*\*

By the time Graham's '93 Mustang parked in front of Leo's, I'd figured out my "uncle" had left out the Satanic Cult anecdotes when relating his life story to his friends. The two had apparently worked on the docks for one of the shipping companies Leo drove for in the early oughts. They punched out at the same time every night for five years, drank at the same bar after work and liked the same music. Immediate best buds.

When I knocked, no one answered, so I checked and found the door open. I called out as I turned the knob, the memory of Graham's revolver etched in the forefront of my mind.

Inside, all the lights were on, and there was the steady drone of a broken electrical device. A really unnerving sound; it took me a minute to figure out it was the garbage disposal. Leo's left arm was jutting from it, jerking back and forth as the machine slowly turned it into ground chuck. I recognized the "Light My Fire" tattoo right away. No sign of Leo, though. 

I thought I'd have a hard time talking Graham out of calling the cops, but to my surprise, he reacted precisely as I did.

"Let's get the fuck outta here and not look back."

As I wiped my prints off the doorknob, that urge to run returned tenfold, so I asked Graham to swing by the house so I could grab my car.

Just in case.

"No prob, man. Happy to help. We gotta stick together, ya know?"

I wasn't prepared to share a trauma bond with this man, but for now, it helped to have him on my side. I mean, my mind was *spinning*. Uncle Leo: dead. Dad: missing, maybe in Hell. Mom: back from obscurity and once again ruling the roost.

None of this boded well for Sami or me unless I found a way to meet them on their terms.

When we arrived, several unfamiliar cars were in the driveway, and the front door stood wide open behind the torn-up screen door. I asked Graham to hold back while I walked around the back of the house. As I rounded the corner and caught sight of the kitchen through the window, I saw four guys I didn't know sitting at the table. One was tall and clean-cut; the others all had long-hair, unkempt stoner beards and enough bad ink on their bodies to immediately make me think of the way old newsprint comes off on your skin. I didn't see Mom, but as I returned to the front, I saw Graham talking to my Dad on the stoop. For the first time in forever, Dad looked happy.

"Jesus, Dad, aren't you cold?"

My brain flashed on that mustachioed skin suit I'd seen in the cave, then the image of tiny Dad in Hell. Was this a replicant?

I came in with a big hug, a thinly veiled attempt to check if his skin felt loose or if he had any noticeable differences from the man I'd known all my life. Seemed like Dad to me.

"Where you been?" Dad asked, relief and concern pulling his inflection in different directions. Despite being barely thirty degrees outside, he wore 80s Jam shorts with a hideous faux-tropical design and his favorite Mercyful Fate "Don't Break the Oath" shirt. No shoes or socks for this guy.

Also, he actually felt hot to the touch, and I disengaged quickly. 

"Just hanging out over at Graham's. Last time I was here, I kinda got the sense Mom maybe didn't want me around."

"Carl, why would you say that?" Mom asked, stepping out the front door, a large plastic mixing bowl resting in the crook of her arm while she worked its bright red contents with an egg whisk. 

"I don't know, for someone who just showed up out of the blue after abandoning us a decade ago, you seem a bit… confrontational?"

"I just don't like seeing you waste your life, Carl."

"Waste my life?"

"How's school?"

She had me. Damn.

"Well, no offense to Dad, but I never really had any…  I don't know… guidance?"

"Doesn't seem to have kept Sami from succeeding."

"Look, yeah, school's a fucking waste. You don't think I know that? But it's how everything's set up… I don't know. What else was I supposed to do after High School? Get a job at a factory or something."

"Your folks tell me you play guitar," said the clean-cut guy I'd spotted through the window. He'd come around from the back. Up close, he looked vaguely familiar.

"Yeah, so? Not a lot going for me there, either."

"The guys inside - they're in a band called Jimson Weed. You heard of 'em?"

My head all but exploded. Jimson Weed was the only local musical success story Woodland's Hills could claim. That said, in 2025, musical success didn't amount to life-changing riches or fame. Still, they'd made a name for themselves in the international Doom Metal community. Their most recent album, *Apocalypse Hoboken*, had even been picked up for distribution on Mars Red Sky's label out of France. They probably had fifty thousand IG followers and sold out all the vinyl they released through their Bandcamp. They accomplished all this without ever doing an interview or releasing a single band photo. No distinguishing video footage, either. Jimson Weed wore hooded cloaks on stage and in all their videos. Ever seen that flick where Loki plays a vampire musician in Detroit with a cult following? That was Jimson Weed, except for real. Rumors about the location of their studio turned up online, but none ever panned out. There were Reddit threads dedicated to people's theories about who and where they played and recorded; people attempted pilgrimages as if searching for buried treasure.

In case you can't tell, I'm a fan.

"Ah, yeah. Of course I know their music."

"They're looking to double down on the heavy for their next record by recruiting a second guitar player. Any interest in trying out?"

I can't adequately explain the sensation that rippled through my spine at that moment. Orgasmic might come close, pun intended.

"Sure?"

Mr. Cleancut stepped forward and offered his hand; I experienced a momentary jolt at that exact moment, a klaxon of alarm ushered in by an inner voice that told me no matter what, I should not shake this man's hand.

I did anyway. The voice instantly disappeared like a hollow wind through bare trees.

"Chuck. Chuck Terrible. Nice to meet you, Carl."

"What the Hell are you doing here? With them?"

"Your Mom and I go way back. Tour just ended and I followed the guys home to help them prepare for the next record. I looked her up, and, well, here we are."

Chuck Terrible was not unknown to me. Maybe an even bigger enigma than Jimson Weed; he'd repped some HUGE metal bands back in the 2010s, then disappeared. 

"Yeah, ah, great to meet you, too, ah, Mr… Terrible?"

"Hahaha. I love that, but fuck man, call me Chuck. C'mon in and have a beer; meet the guys."

As I walked up the steps, Graham gave me an excited elbow to the ribs and I thought of Bob Uecker's character on Mr. Belvedere with his trademark, "Way to go, champ."

"You're welcome inside, too, Graham. Leo told me all about you the last time I saw him."

When she said this, Mom made determined eye contact with me. I knew in that moment she had killed Leo. I also knew that, presented with the opportunity of a lifetime, I no longer cared.
