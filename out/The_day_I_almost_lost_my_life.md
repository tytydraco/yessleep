I live in a small island village on the Mundeshwari river. There is a bamboo bridge connecting the bazaar (market) to our village. During the rainy season every year the bridge gets destroyed. It's rebuilt only after the river calms down. During that time we cross the river on small boats.

One night I was coming home from a wedding ceremony. I had a tin torch and a bag of food. It was already past midnight. When I reached the dock, there was no boatman, only a small boat tied to a stake. I climbed the boat and took the ropes off. There was only one paddle on the boat. I lit a cigarette and began paddling. It was a quiet night, when I was in the middle of the river something touched my paddle. I looked down but couldn't see anything in the muddy water. After a few seconds I hit something again. I stopped paddling and looked around to see if something was stuck to the boat.

Suddenly my eyes fell on a shadowy figure in the water. It was circling around me. I was scared. I started paddling as fast as I could. That thing was still following me, I unintentionally hit it a few more times while paddling. After which it sank into the water. I felt relieved, but before I could think of anything my boat started shaking violently. That thing was trying to tilt the boat. I tightly held onto the boat and started praying to God. At that moment I heard a blood curling low bellow from behind me. I looked back to see that thing trying to climb on my boat. It had a humanoid figure, but it's skin was pale and there was no hair on its body. It had frilled hands and it's eyes were pich black. At that moment I mustered up all my strength and hit it on the head with my paddle. It let out a loud scream before going back in the water. My paddle broke from that hit.

I was only about 15 meters away from the river bank at that time. I tried to paddle with the broken piece when my boat was hit really hard from below instantly tilting it. I lost my balance and fell in the water. As soon as I fell in I started swimming with everything I had. Those 10 meters felt like forever to cross. I didn't look back once yet I could feel the monster closing in. Right before I reached land something scratched my leg. I wail out in pain as I come out of the water. I look back to see that monster standing in shallow water stare at me. I felt a chill down my spine. After a second it went back into the water and disappeared.

My heart was beating really fast. I puked from the stress. My left leg was hurting. My ankle definitely broke.

I limped my way up the dam, the road leading up splits into two different paths right before reaching the top. When I reached near the top I looked up. At that time I wished I hadn't gone to the wedding that day. At the end of both roads there were two creatures waiting for me. They looked like dogs, but their height was like a young calf. Their faces were flat, almost like a human and they had glowing red eyes. Those hellhounds were looking at me, waiting for me to choose a path. My whole body was shaking non-stop.

At that time I held onto my consciousness and climbed the dam from between the two paths. Once I reached the top I looked at both sides. Thankfully the creatures were gone. I couldn't see them anywhere. I only heard a howl from afar. But that was enough to scare me. I forgot about my broken ankle and started running as fast as I could. Once I reached my village I entered the village mosque and screamed for help. The last thing I saw before losing my consciousness was the imam running towards me asking if I was ok.

I woke up the next day in my house. I had a terrible fever. My ankle was broken and a small chunk of meat was ripped off of my leg. I still have that scar to this day. What I saw that day was not normal. Those were not ordinary creatures. I never had such a deadly encounter with them again, but I feel like I have seen them in the corner of my eyes, maybe it was my paranoia but whenever I crossed the river I felt like something was looking at me. From deep inside the water. Waiting for a chance to grab me and drag me to the river depths...
