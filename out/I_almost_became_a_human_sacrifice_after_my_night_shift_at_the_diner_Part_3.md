Have I already mentioned how much I hate this town?

If not, let me do it right now:

I hate this town. A lot. 

And it’s not arbitrary. Not at all.

Look, I can excuse crazy vampires. I can excuse monsters living in the walls. But I draw the line at ritual human sacrifice. Especially when it involves me. 

I mean, come on!

But let’s not get too ahead of ourselves yet. 

It all started with a human corpse at the motel. In the room right next to mine, in fact. I really do need to find somewhere else to live.

I was woken up in the middle of the day, after a long and very tiring night shift, by loud banging on the door. 

I reluctantly approached the door to open it, unsure of what I would find on the other side. Maybe the troll I’d pissed off the previous night wanted to set some records straight. Or the siren. Or the werewolf. 

Because apparently, none of these ~~things~~ people can get it into their thick skulls that I can’t just hand out free food to whoever threatens me the hardest. That’s not how diners work!

I guess being human makes me an easy target. Being the ‘town hero’ seems to mean nothing to some people. Or at least not to monster Karens. Karenters? Monrens? Whatever you wanna call it is fine with me. I don’t care. 

\*sigh\*

Luckily for me, it was just the sheriff. 

That’s a great way to wake up (that’s sarcasm, in case it wasn’t obvious enough). 

And he came with a warrant for my arrest. 

Do you guys remember the missing iron rod? 

Well, it’s not missing anymore. I found it. Well, they did. 

In the dead man’s chest. 

And, since the man died with an iron rod stuck in his chest, I was the prime suspect. 

“I didn’t do it!” I yelled as the sheriff dragged me to the room next to mine. 

There, on the floor, lay a boy no older that twenty years old with the iron rod jutting out of his chest. 

I gasped and turned away, my stomach twisting.

“Spare me the theatrics,” the sheriff snapped. “I knew you’d be trouble the minute you came into town. Just take the rod out so we can deal with the body.”

I wanted to fight back, I really did. To scream that I wasn’t the one who did this. But the sight of the poor boy laying dead in a pool of his own blood shut me up. I felt sorry for him, and because of that I decided to help out. Someone had to. 

By the time it was done, my only remaining good clothes were soaked in blood, and I was being marched out to the police car. 

I don’t know what they do with murderers in this town, but I doubt it follows the penal code. 

Thankfully, I didn’t have to find out, because ten minutes later I saw the forensic and the sheriff speaking and then the sheriff’s eyes shot up to meet mine. 

There was anger in them, but I could tell that it wasn’t directed at the fact that he ‘caught’ me, since before he had seemed ecstatic at the possibility. 

He walked rapidly to the car door, and whipped it open. 

“You’re lucky,” he muttered. “The boy was killed last night while you were working. Now get out of here.”

I didn’t need to be told twice. I bolted to my room and locked it, unsure how to proceed. 

By then, I only had three clear things in my mind:

1. Only humans can touch iron.
2. The iron rod had to have been stolen by a human
3. A human had to have killed the boy in the other room.  

What I didn’t know was who exactly did it, since according to at least four people, I was the only human in town. 

I didn’t sleep that day, as I was too preoccupied trying to find anything online that could help me. But, as usual, the internet is ever as useless as it typically is. 

I mean, sure, there is a lot of information, but how am I supposed to tell what’s real and what’s just some idiot on Reddit pretending to be a monster expert?

Later, the night shift was no better. Word travels fast, apparently. 

“Look who we have here! Murder anyone lately?” A customer teased. It was obvious he was joking, though, as if he found the notion of me killing someone hilarious. 

“No. Have you?” I shot back without thinking. Damn it, one of these days my mouth will be the death of me, I swear. But at least he and his friends laughed. 

When I stepped into the kitchen, Roger was already there waiting for me, a cup of hot cocoa in hand.

“Thanks,” I mumbled, taking it. “Does everyone know?” I groaned, and he grimaced.

“Kind of. They know a human was murdered and that the sheriff thought it was you. But the bit about the iron hasn’t spread yet.”

“Well, that’s a relief,” I said, giving him a bitter smile. “What’s up with the sheriff, though? Does he hate all humans, or am I just that special?”

“He doesn’t hate all humans,” Roger chuckled, though there wasn’t much amusement in it. “He knows we’re friends. And he tends to… strongly dislike anyone who likes me.” 

“What? Why?” I asked, sipping on the cocoa. 

“He’s my dad,” Roger responded, fidgeting. “But I don’t really want to talk about it right now,” he included fast. 

I nodded, understanding that sometimes family history should stay hidden. I wanted to ask more, but I changed the topic instead. 

“Do you know if there are any leads?” I asked, and he looked at Linda through the window. 

“I’ll tell you later,” he whispered. 

Now that’s something I wasn’t expecting. Many of you in the comments let me know that you didn’t fully trust Linda, and I had to agree with that, even though I was hesitant to admit it at first. 

But what I didn’t expect was for Roger to distrust her too. However, instead of making me relieved, it made me more anxious. 

Either way, I accepted his answer and went on with the night. 

Once Linda left and the diner quieted down after the dinner rush, Roger and I reconvened in the kitchen.

There, he took out a laptop out of his bag and placed it on the counter. 

“You need to see this,” he said, opening it up. Then he also took out a piece of paper with a string of letters and numbers scribbled on. “Do you mind turning around for a second? It’s one thing to break into the police database from my father’s computer, but it’s another thing to let other people know the password. 

“Are you crazy? You stole your dad’s laptop?”

“Just… shut up and turn around?”

I did as he said, while having the sinking feeling that maybe this wasn’t such a great idea. Or maybe it’s not a great idea to post about it. 

Eh, we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. If there is any law enforcement personnel reading this, this is a joke as far as you’re concerned.   

 Everybody else carry on. 

“And why couldn’t you show it to me before when Linda was here?” Yep, that’s right. I just went ahead and asked. I figured that there was no reason not to. 

He grimaced, rubbing the back of his neck. “Because of this,” he said, taking a USB drive out of his pocket. 

“The night the rod went missing, all tapes from the motel were wiped. But our tapes are impossible to tamper with,” he continued, plugging the USB into the computer. “Now, this is exclusive footage. Not even the sheriff has access to it because the diner has its own rules.”

He played the video. The footage looked grainy, and it was black and white, but I could still make out a figure walking straight to the motel from the furthest right corner. His movements were calculated and mechanic, nothing like a normal person’s, and I was sure that whoever that was in the video must have been inhuman. 

Then, for just a moment, his eyes locked on the camera, and I felt as if he were really looking right  at me through the picture. 

I felt a chill running through my spine. And I still couldn’t help but notice that when he had looked at the camera there was an odd gleam in his eyes. A sparkle. 

“Wait,” I said, rewinding the footage until his face reappeared. I froze the frame. “Do you see that?” I pointed at the eyes. “Is it because of what he is? What is he, anyway?”

Roger furrowed his brows and leaned in. A wave of shock washed over his face. 

“Not at all,” he gasped. “Don’t you recognize him?” 

He switched tabs to the police database, and my stomach dropped. The man in the photo was the same one as in the video. 

And it was the very much **human** dead person from the room next to mine. 

“Of course! How could I have been so stupid?” Roger exclaimed, clearly talking to himself. 

“What—”

“Just go back to work,” he interrupted. “After our shift, meet me back in the alley. I need to arrange some help.”

I couldn’t concentrate for the rest of the night. I was too busy staring at the clock, waiting for four a.m. to come. I probably looked like Linda by the end of it. 

And, since word had already spread wide that I’d been almost arrested for murder, there was never a dull moment. Some customers were convinced I’d done it, others thought accusing me was offensive because of what I did last week, and a select few found the whole thing hilarious.

Either way, it was a very long shift.

But I wasn’t threatened with violence or death, so yay!

Then the time finally came to meet Roger in the alley.

“Okay. You need to tell me what’s going on right now because I’m freaking out. And I’m tired of freaking out!” I crossed my arms, mostly to keep them from shaking.

Roger glanced around the alley before lowering his voice. “When I first broke into my father’s police database, I found it really odd that someone would walk over seventy miles just to get to this town for no reason, and end up dead.” He paused, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “We’ve had wanderers before, but all of them stumbled upon this town by bus. Like you. But now I know why. He didn’t do it out of his own volition. He was compelled into it.”

“Compelled?” I echoed.

“Yes, compelled,” he repeated, a little impatiently. “And there’s only one creature I know that can do that.” He stopped for a moment. 

“What?” I snapped. 

“Vampires.”

Awesome. Vampires again. I groaned. 

“So, what are you saying? A vampire made him take the rod out and killed him?”

Roger hesitated, his jaw tightening. “No. Well… yes. I don’t know. I think, most likely, the vampire made him kill himself.”

I blinked at him. “That’s horrifying!”

“Yeah. That’s not all. The bad news is that last week, all the vampires in town went to a meeting with their high council or superiors or whatever you want to call it.” He waved a hand. “They came back two days before the rod was taken out. So it could’ve literally been anyone.”

I groaned. “So what do we do now? What can be done?”

He gave me a half-grin that didn’t reach his eyes. “Well, the good news is that the leader of the vampire clan decided to help us figure it out.”

I stared at him. “Great! Where is he?”

“I didn’t know you were so eager to see me again, bloody. I would’ve come earlier if I’d known.”

A chill left me paralyzed and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. 

Oh no. I knew that voice. 

That voice had been haunting my nightmares for two weeks. 

The rude vampire was back.

I tensed up and moved behind Roger so that I could keep my eyes on him, but I refused to look at his face. I refused to see those fangs that had torn through my flesh. 

“Wolfie,” he nodded at Roger. He clapped his hand in impatience. “So, are we doing this or not?” Then he stared intensely at me. 

I looked at Roger, confused. “Doing what?”

“So… most vampires can only use their powers of coercion once every two weeks,” Roger said, hesitating. “It takes them a long time to recharge. Unless… you’re really powerful. And the only really powerful vampire here is… Lucien,” he said, pointing at the rude vampire with his chin. 

Lucien. The name felt bitter on my tongue. 

“Doing what?” I repeated, more altered this time, already sensing where this was going. 

Roger stared at the vampire looking for aid, but he seemed to be enjoying this too much to step in. 

“So…,” he cleared his throat. ”We kind of need a human for the vampires to try to compel. Just to see if they can.” The werewolf said, hesitant. 

“Yep. My suspicions have officially been confirmed. That’s it. You’re out of your mind. I already knew you were reckless, but this is beyond insane. No. Absolutely not.” I yelled. 

Lucien tilted his head as the amusement in his eyes grew. “I seem to remember that you owe me. Isn’t that right?”

I froze. 

“This wouldn’t settle a life debt, of course. But it’s a start,” he grinned. 

Roger smiled innocently at me, but there was guilt flickering behind his eyes.

“Don’t worry. I’ll be with you the whole time,” he reassured me. 

But his words were met with extreme laughter from Lucien. 

“Do you really think that I would take a *wolf* into the clan?”

“Well, either I go or she doesn’t.” He faced the vampire. The air turned turbulent for a second, and I wasn’t sure if I really wanted to be caught in the middle of a battle between vampires and werewolves. 

“She doesn’t really have a choice, now does she?” Lucien responded. “She’ll be fine. You have my word.”

I still hesitated. But, finally, after some more back and forth between the two, and after Lucien proved that he could compel me by having me stick my finger in my ear, Roger finally conceded in letting me go with the leader of the vampires. 

And I couldn’t do anything to avoid it. 

I walked the streets of the town in silence, following the vampire through unfamiliar streets that I hadn’t dared visit before. It’s ironic, really. I was wandering the town with the very creature I was scared of encountering. 

I adjusted the collar of the dress trying to cover as much of my neck as possible, which earned me a chuckle from him. Does he not have anything better to do than to observe me?

“Don’t you trust me?” He mocked. 

*Hell no,* I wanted to respond, but for the first time ever I held my tongue. 

“Not even a little bit,” I said instead. 

“Don’t worry, bloody,” he sighed. “We won’t have to spend too much time in each other’s presence. I only know one vampire ruthless enough to do this.”

“Great,” I muttered, voice tight. 

We kept walking in silence for a bit while I was trying to put as much distance between each other as possible while also trying to keep up with him. 

“You know…” he said after a few minutes. “I’m starting to feel a bit peckish.”

I tensed up and wanted to bolt in the other direction, but I knew that he was only trying to rile me up. After all, he’s given his word to Roger, and inhumans tend to take their promises very seriously. 

“The diner is that way,” I responded, but I still tightened the way I was crossing my arms. My heart raced, and I forced myself not to glance at him.

I’ve been debating for a while whether or not to tell you where the vampire clan is located, and this time I opted for self-preservation and decided not to go around spilling vampire secrets. I’m also not sure if the layout should also be hidden, so I decided to err on the side of caution this time.

Either way, we found ourselves in front of a wooden door. 

I waited for him to knock or to just open it but he just stared at me. I’m getting really tired of all of this staring.  

“What?” I barked. 

“Pondering the possibilities.” He replied, and I raised one eyebrow. “Are you a fast runner?”

I started walking backward before realizing it. “Why?”

“You know what?” he sighed. “It would be much too fun for you to go in blind. I won’t ruin the surprise by telling you,” he smirked. “Go ahead and open the door.”

I hesitated as my hand hovered over the handle. After taking a deep breath, I finally pushed the door open. 

I didn’t know what I was expecting. Maybe a dark dungeon, or a bat cave. Or even a few coffins scattered around. 

Instead, I was face to face with what looked like a completely normal living room. 

It took me a few seconds to realize why Lucien had asked me if I was a fast runner, though.

There, sprawling on the couch watching TV was non-other than Silas himself. 

If there is one thing that I consider to be a fatal flaw of mine, it’s that my first reaction to fear is to freeze. 

Fortunately, my second instinct is to run. (And no, I’m not a fast runner). 

I bolted out of the door and I aimed for the exit, hoping to be able to leave the clan before either of the vampires caught up to me. Of course, that was a futile task, and if the part of my brain capable of critical thinking had been on, I would’ve known that before I wasted my time running. 

Someone crashed into me from behind, stopping me mid-trot and lifting me off the ground. I kicked, pleaded, and struggled, but Lucien didn’t so much as flinch. 

“Please, please, please,” I begged. “Please, let me go. Please!”

“Shhh,” he hushed. However, instead of the calming effect he probably meant to have, it just sent me into a deeper panic as I remembered the way his lips had mouthed that word against my neck before he shoved his fangs in that night. 

Eventually, I got tired of fighting and I just went limp in his arms. 

“Are you done?” He hissed, but I didn’t say anything back. “This wasn’t as much fun as I thought it would be.” 

“What are you going to do to me?” I asked, several theories already coursing through my head. 

Was he going to hand me in to Silas so that he could finish what he’d started that night? Was he trying to save me again from him so that I could owe him twice instead of once?

“I’m going to have Silas try to compel you, and when he can’t, I’ll deliver you *safely* back to the diner.” I looked at him surprised. 

“What? I gave Roger my word.” He shrugged. 

I tentatively followed him back to Silas’ house, and even though I was shaking like a leaf, I looked at him in the eyes as he tried to compel me. 

I felt Lucien’s hands on my shoulders, holding me in place just in case I decided to run again, but I held my ground. 

A dark smile spread through Silas’ face, but he didn’t manage to say whatever he wanted to say next because a warning growl from Lucien stopped him. 

“Just try to compel her before I dismember you again,” Lucien snapped. 

“Put your finger in your ear,” Silas grunted through his teeth. 

For a moment, nothing happened, and I felt relieved at the thought that Lucien had been right and Silas was the one who had coerced the dead boy. 

But then, without my permission, my right pointer finger travelled to my ear.

Finally, after a few seconds I gasped out of the compulsion. 

“Happy, sire?” Silas spat, head bowed. 

Lucien’s jaw tightened. “No. But I’m going to have to spare you today.”

Lucien grabbed me by my arm and pulled me away from the house. 

While we were leaving, a malicious smile spread over the Silas’ face and he flashed me his fangs. 

I just turned around, tearing my arm free from Lucien’s grasp, and wrapping both of them around myself. 

“It was’t him,” my voice came out as barely over a whisper. 

“No,” he snarled. 

“Didn’t—didn’t you kill him?” I dared to ask. 

“No. We can recover from dismemberment. And beheading. There’s only one way to actually kill us.”

“What is it?” I asked. 

He roared in laughter. 

“One doesn’t become clan leader by being stupid enough to share that particular secret.”

I just kept quiet after that. 

I’ll spare you the details of how the rest of the ‘witch hunt’ (vampire hunt?) went.

We didn’t finish before dawn, and by the end of it my ear was sore and every single vampire we met had managed to compel me. Only one house remained. 

We walked into the house uninvited, as we had been doing all night. 

But before I could step in, Lucien threw his arm out to stop me. 

“Stay here,” he whispered, then vanished upstairs in a blur of speed.

He was back a heartbeat later. “We need to get you back to the diner now.”

But when he tried to step outside to meet me, he slammed into an invisible barrier.  

“What—” I started, but I was interrupted by him cursing. 

“Did you put that there?” He growled with an accusatory glare while pointing at the doorframe. There, hung a delicate silver chain. 

“NO!” I denied. 

“It doesn’t matter right now.” He fumed. “Just take it off so I can get out.”

I nodded, and went on my tippy toes to try to reach the chain. 

But I never even touched it because, suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in the back of my head and everything went black. 

The first thing I noticed was that I could not open my eyes. Not because there was something blocking them, but because I was physically incapable of doing so. 

I could hear waves crashing into rock far below, and I felt something poking me on my side. Panic shot through me as I realized that alongside my eyelids,  I also couldn’t move the rest of my body. 

After a few more seconds of wrestling with my eyelids, I was finally able to pry them open. But I instantly wished I hadn’t. 

I was laying on my back, staring at the setting sun. *When did it get so late?* Through the corners of my eyes, I could see five women clad in nothing else but flowing grey capes and long, white nightgowns. Each held a torch as they danced around me. 

“She’s awake!” One of them exclaimed. 

“Finally!” Another responded. 

“Yes!”

“Hush girls. We can start now.” An older woman said. 

They all went silent, spacing themselves evenly around me, forming a perfect circle.

My mind screamed, move! run! do something! But my body remained frozen. I was paralyzed. I was *literally* paralyzed.

The women resumed their dancing in around me, but this time the older woman began chanting. 

I attempted to jerk my body, desperately trying to get any movement out. But no matter how hard I tried, I was stuck in place. 

“Oh, father. God of the Sea, take this burden away from me.”

“You who live beneath the waves, accept this sacrifice within your caves.” 

“Here’s the cause, lift the curse.”

“As she falls off the cliff…”

“…Into the dark abyss.”

The older woman stepped beck, gesturing for the rest to come close to me. 

The four of them closed in, and each of them grabbed me by one of my limbs. I wanted to scream, to thrash, anything, really. But my body still refused to follow any of my commands. All I managed to do was to move a toe. What was I supposed to do with a toe?

They lifted me into the air like I weighed nothing, carrying me toward the cliff’s edge. 

Tears slid down y face as the icy wind hit my body. *Why can’t I move,* I thought. 

“Hey, Celine!” A voice cut through the roaring wind. A voice I knew. “You missing something?” The sheriff asked. I never thought I’d feel relieved at the sound of his voice. 

The older woman spoke. “Leave that alone,” she screamed. 

“Leave her alone first and then I’ll give you our sealskin back,” the sheriff countered. “I believe it’s a fair deal.”

My hoped deflated when Celine spat out “Never! I’m willing to sacrifice myself before I let this human keep incurring *his* wrath. Don’t you see everything that’s been happening around town? It all started when she got here.”

“Look, Celine. I don’t like the girl either, but—” he was cut off by another voice. 

“You may be willing to sacrifice yourself. But are you willing to sacrifice your girls as well?”

The women froze, and for a moment I feared that the woman was going to say yes to Roger, but she commanded the girls to put me down. 

“This isn’t over,” she growled at me before turning around and leaving. 

I was once again laying on the floor when Roger and the sheriff came to my side. 

I began crying again, but this time in relief. (I swear I never cried this much before I came to this town). 

“Ok, give me a second,” Roger muttered as he pried my mouth open and took out something I hadn’t realized was there before. I could only see it for a moment before he threw it off the cliff, but it looked similar to seaweed. 

(I later found out that it was selkie skin wrapped in kelp from the deepest underwater city. It’s supposed to have a calming effect on supernatural creatures, but it causes complete paralysis on humans.)

The moment the bundle left my mouth, I instantly regained the ability to move. 

I shot up and threw my arms around Roger’s neck. 

“Easy,” the sheriff said in a surprisingly kid tone, placing a hand on my back as support. 

“You’re ok now,” Roger said, returning my hug. 

I wasn’t sure how true that was, but we eventually had to leave the cliff. Roger and I went our own way while the Sheriff went after the selkies, hoping to get them off my back. 

And if you were wondering, no. 

We were not still in Iowa. 

It was a completely different realm. 

But I really don’t have the energy to get into that right now. I’ll let you know about the seven realms soon. 

For now, you only need to know that that realm and the town are connected.

All I wanted to do was go back to the motel and sleep the night away. But, instead, Roger and I found ourselves standing in front of the entrance to the vampire clan. 

“What are we doing here?” I asked. 

“When you never showed back up at the diner, I knew something had gone wrong,” he said. “So I came to the clan with my father, and we found Lucien trapped inside that house” He rubbed his neck. “It was quite clever, really. Vampires can enter through a door that has a silver chain hung above it, but they can’t get back out, or have another vampire remove it from outside while the trap is working.”

“That’s one thing vampires and werewolves have in common,” he continued. “It’s actually where the whole myth about werewolves being vulnerable to silver came from.”

“And you want me to get him out?”

He nodded. “Yeah… my dad promised that we’d bring help after we rescued you.”

So, I went back into the clan alone. Because, apparently, the feud between vampires and werewolves wasn’t a myth, and Roger couldn’t come in now that he wasn’t accompanied by the sheriff. 

When I reached the house, Lucien was already waiting for me with his arms crossed. 

He sighed. “Finally!  Come on, Bloody. Take that chain off,” he ordered. 

I went to do what he said, stretching on my toes to reach the doorframe, but then I stopped as an idea struck me. 

Have I already mentioned that I believe my mouth will be the death of me someday?

“Stop stalling and just take it off,” he growled, but I just retreated a few steps and crossed my arms to keep my body from shaking. 

I was about to do something either incredibly stupid, or completely genius. 

“I will,” I said with fake confidence. “But first, answer this: what happens if I walk away and leave you stuck in here?”

“Stop playing games,” he growled. 

“I will as soon as you answer,” I smiled sweetly as my heart tried to come out of my chest. 

“I’ll find another way out. I will. And then, I’ll come find you and rip your throat out. So take. It. Off.” he tried to intimidate me, but despite the fact that it had worked, I still held my ground. 

“You want out. I want out. We both want out, ” I started. “So how about I take off the chain, and we’re even?”

“That’s not how that works, bloody.”

“Fine. You can stay in there for all I care,” I turned around and started walking towards the exit, hoping that he wouldn’t call my bluff. 

“Fine!” He finally conceded. “You let me out and we’re even.”

I reached up and took off the chain. 

The moment I did, Lucien stepped out of the house and faced me. 

Truth be told, I didn’t feel as confident then as I’d felt while he was still behind the barrier. 

He moved closer, and I instinctively flinched when he raised his hand, thinking that he wanted revenge. 

Instead, his finger brushed against my cheek, tracing a scratch that I got back on the cliff. 

“What happened to you?” He asked. 

“It’s a long story…” I said, stepping back. “Anyway, see you around.”

“No.” He said, and I stared at him in confusion. 

“No?”

“I have to walk you back to the diner. It’s part of the deal, bloody.”

And I wish that was how the night ended: him dropping me off at the diner, and me going home to sleep. 

But no. 

BECAUSE I STILL HAD TO WORK MY SHIFT

I hate this town so much. 

Either way, at least the sheriff was able to talk some sense into the selkies and now they know that I wasn’t the cause of all the problems in town. 

The bad news is that now everybody knows about the iron rod and that it went missing for a while. 

The good news is that now that everybody else knows about it, they probably won’t try to sacrifice me to their gods again. 

Maybe. 

Oh, and the sheriff kicked Roger out of his house. 

He already disliked Roger for some reason, and finding out that he stole his laptop and police credentials was the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

So now I have a werewolf sleeping on the floor of my room. 

One last thing, now that I know what it stands for and I believe that it may be important for my survival, I feel like I can finally tell you the name of the diner:

The seven realms diner. 

Because I have a feeling that this has just begun.
