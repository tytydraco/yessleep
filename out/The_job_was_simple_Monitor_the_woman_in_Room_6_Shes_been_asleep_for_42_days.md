I took the job because I needed quiet.

I had just moved back into the city after a really bad year - breakup, job loss, a fire that took half of what I owned. I was couch surfing when I saw the listing. Overnight shift. Private sleep study. No experience necessary, just basic data entry and the ability to stay awake. I figured I’d get some peace, maybe save up enough to afford rent somewhere that didn’t smell like damp carpet and stale weed.

The company was called SomnoTech. I Googled them. Not much came up. One old article in a university medical journal talking about “experimental treatments in chronic sleep disorder recovery,” and a barebones website with a contact form. The building I was sent to looked more like an office for defunct insurance than a lab. Beige, windowless, buzzed me in through two locked doors. Everything inside was silent and clean. No logos. Just halls that didn’t echo.

They gave me a laminated badge and walked me to Observation Room 6. It had one long window, a chair, three monitors, and a clipboard. That was it. Beyond the glass: a white-walled room, padded corners, one hospital-style bed with a woman laying perfectly still on it. Wires across her scalp. Pulse oximeter. Blood pressure cuff. Breathing tubes. The usual. The kind of image you’d see in a medical drama.

Her name was Marla. That’s all they told me.

“She’s not in a coma,” the lead technician - Dr. Ellis - said. “She’s asleep.”

I asked how long.

He said, “Forty-two days.”

That was when I almost walked out. But the pay was too good, and I told myself it was harmless. Just keep a log. Note her REM cycles. Don’t go in the room.

They emphasized that. Over and over.

**Never enter the room.**

I asked what would happen if she woke up.

Dr. Ellis paused for too long before he answered,

“That’s… not expected.”

That first night, nothing happened.

She lay still, vitals normal. Every couple hours her eyes flickered beneath the lids. Standard REM activity. Once, around 2:30 a.m., her hand twitched. I logged everything. I didn’t sleep, didn’t even look away much. Just sat and stared, drank vending machine coffee, and listened to the soft beep of monitors that never changed.

It wasn’t until the third shift that she moved.

Not much. Just shifted in bed. Rolled slightly. Her breathing deepened. That’s when I noticed something strange - the audio feed picked up sound from her room, but it was... too clean. No background noise. No rustle of sheets. Just her breathing.

Then she said something. A whisper.

I hit replay.

She’d said a name.

My name.

My full name.

No one else at SomnoTech knew it. I’d used an alias on the application, something I did out of habit after a few years of gig jobs. But what she said - what she mouthed - was my real name.

The one I haven’t used since I left home.

I showed the recording to Dr. Ellis.

He watched it, twice, without expression.

“It’s likely a coincidence,” he said. “The dreaming brain replays fragments of memory. She may have seen you on the way in.”

“She’s been asleep for six weeks.”

“She’s responding. That’s good. Keep documenting.”

He walked out before I could ask anything else.

The next few nights, I tried to convince myself it was nothing. I told myself it was a coincidence. That it didn’t mean anything. But she kept saying it.

Night after night. Just my name. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow. No sound - just the shape of it, over and over. Her mouth moving in that same rhythm. I stopped drinking the coffee. Started staying stone-cold sober for every shift.

On the 23rd day, everything changed.

At exactly 3:07 a.m., Marla sat up in bed. Her eyes were still closed. She turned her head, slowly, toward the camera in the top corner of the ceiling. And then, without hesitation, she pointed at it. At me.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. Just stared as she pointed, waited five long seconds, then laid back down. 

I radioed it in.

“She’s dreaming about you,” the tech on call said. “That means it’s working.”

“What’s working?”

No response.

When I arrived the next night, I was given a new form to sign. It was labeled ‘**Phase Two Observation Protocol**.’

Most of it was boilerplate NDA language, but two lines stuck out:

*Observer must not leave the premises until Phase Two is complete.*

*Observer must report all subjective experiences, including dreams, during or between shifts.*

They were asking me to log my own sleep. When I pointed out that I wasn’t supposed to be sleeping on shift, the night tech said,

“You’ll understand soon.”

Marla began crying on Day 31. At first, it was soft. Then sobs - raw, broken, painful. Her vitals didn’t spike. Brain activity remained stable. But the sound of her grief came through the speaker like it was close. Not recorded. Not filtered. Like she was in the room with me.

I started sleeping in two-hour blocks. I couldn’t stay awake anymore. My body was shutting down. 

And then the dreams came.

First night: I’m standing in the hallway of the lab. Only it’s longer. The walls are too narrow, the ceiling too low. At the end of the hallway, there’s a door. Behind it, whispering.

Second night: Marla is sitting in the chair I use. Writing something. Every time I try to speak, she looks up and smiles. Her eyes are still closed.

Third night: I’m in the observation room, but the monitors show me, sleeping. Marla’s bed is empty.

I started documenting the dreams. Every detail. I showed them to Dr. Ellis. He didn’t even blink.

“You’re syncing,” he said.

“Syncing with what?”

He just said, “The bridge needs a guide.”

I stopped asking questions. I stopped pushing. I didn’t have much choice.

I started working double shifts. Eighteen hours on, six off. I slept at the facility. They put me in a bunkroom in a hallway I’d never seen. I thought it was just exhaustion, but when I tried to leave the building after that shift, my badge was deactivated. The front doors stayed locked. I went back to the observation room.

Marla was sitting up in bed, hands on her face, still crying. She’d been crying for nine days straight.

I didn’t eat. Didn’t sleep. I started taking the pills they left by the coffee machine. They didn’t help. My vision blurred. My hands shook. Every time I looked in the mirror, I saw bags under my eyes, my face pale and gaunt.

I wasn’t there anymore. I was just in the room. Staring. Always staring.

And then Marla opened her eyes. Just for a moment, just a fraction of an inch, but they were open. Not white, not rolled back. She was looking at me. Her pupils were there. Focused. She held my gaze for a breath, then closed them.

I tried to call Dr. Ellis. My radio didn’t work anymore. The lights went out. The only thing left was the audio feed. Her soft crying. And then, she said my name again.

That’s when I noticed.

My clipboard was empty. Every log, every note, every dream I’d written down - gone. I grabbed for the stack of old forms from the drawer under the monitor. They weren’t there. Not even the signature pages. Just hundreds of blank sheets.

I looked up at the monitors. The leftmost screen was blank. I hadn’t noticed it. Was it always like that? It was dark. No vitals. No video. Just a black screen with a single white label - my name.

Marla pointed at it. The crying stopped.

She stood up and walked to the window. I felt cold. My blood slowed. My heart pounded in my ears. Then she reached out and touched the glass. And for the first time, the audio picked up more than her breath. It picked up mine.

I backed away. But there was nowhere to go. The door was locked. Marla stared at me through the window, and her expression changed. Her brow furrowed. Her mouth opened. I watched the shape of a question form on her lips.

Suddenly, I was in the room. Not the observation room. Her room.

My hand touched the bed. Cold sheets. The air smelled sterile. There was one window. No monitors. I was on the other side of the glass. I was in the bed.

I looked over the edge of the mattress and saw myself. I was sitting in the observation chair. Writing on a clipboard. My eyes were open but blank. The rightmost monitor showed vitals, but they weren’t Marla’s. They were mine. My breathing, my heart rate.

And on the leftmost monitor, just darkness. 

Marla stood in front of the window in the observation room and pointed at me. She mouthed something over and over again. Not my name. Not this time. I couldn’t understand it. I tried to get up. To reach for her. But I couldn’t move.

She took one step back and turned toward the door. I heard it open. Someone walked in, someone I couldn’t see. Marla said something else and then walked out. The audio feed stayed active. I heard footsteps. A new set of footsteps, heavier, slower, dragging. And then a new voice. It wasn’t Marla’s. It was mine. 

I tried to scream. The audio feed went dead.

The next time I woke up, the observation room was dark. The silence was too deep. It felt like the building had been abandoned for years.

I pulled the blanket off me. My legs were weak. My mouth tasted of copper. I stood up, slowly. The air was freezing. My breath came out in clouds. The window was dark. All the lights were off.

But when I looked at the ground, I saw I wasn’t standing on the floor. I was standing on glass. 

And on the other side - a new girl in the chair. 

Only, she wasn’t looking up at me.

She was looking *at* me - straight on - as if her world tilted at a different angle. As if she were seated upright in a room that existed sideways beneath mine. Her gaze didn’t drift. Her neck didn’t crane. She met my eyes like we were sitting across from each other, not separated by gravity and glass. 

I dropped to my knees, pressing my hands to the pane. 

She watched me. Pale, shaking, eyes wide with fear. She looked like she’d been crying. Like she’d seen something she didn’t understand.

I recognized myself in her face, but it wasn’t me. It couldn’t be.

Because behind her, on the far side of the darkened room, there was a figure standing in the corner.

It was me. The other me. The one that sat in the chair. Its eyes were open, and it was smiling. And on its lap: an empty clipboard, waiting to be filled. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It’s been four months since I arrived at SomnoTech. I haven’t slept in three. I’ve written all of this down. I’m not sure how many times. I don’t know how much is real.

The girl in the chair doesn’t look at me anymore. She stopped crying. She stopped moving. She’s becoming like the other one. The smiling one. The one in the dark. The one who’s waiting for its turn.

I don’t want to know what comes next. I don’t think anyone does. But it doesn’t matter what we want. All that matters is what it wants. And it’s getting closer. I can hear it in the walls. I can feel it in my skin. I can see it in the reflection.

And once that happens, there’s only one thing left. One final step. One last phase.

This isn’t a dream. It’s not even a nightmare.

It’s the thing waiting *after.*

And we’re already in it.

We’re all already asleep.

And we don’t even know it yet.
