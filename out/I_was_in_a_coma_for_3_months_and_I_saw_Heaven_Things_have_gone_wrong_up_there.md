It happened whilst I was sailing in the bay. The last thing I saw was the wooden boom of my boat wheeling towards me, and then stars and galaxies rushed by, all adhering to some dizzying curvature, before I finally woke in my apartment.

I remember that I screamed.

Not only from the horror of being sent overboard on choppy waters, and not even from the horror of beholding a cosmic nightmare I didn’t understand. No, I screamed because my ‘apartment’ wasn’t my apartment at all. I knew as much in my gut. When I looked down at my English springer spaniel, Bonnie, I felt much the same: she wasn’t Bonnie at all. She was exact, in terms of appearance and temperament, but entirely inexact; her glinting brown eyes unnerved me to the extent that I quickly looked away.

Perfect. That was the problem. Everything was perfect.

As I staggered to the hallway, I wondered whether the bad dream was my boating accident or *this*. It was then that I cast my eyes to the curtains drawn across my living room windows, but before I opened them, there came knocking.

I remember answering the front door to find a pristine white hallway, which wasn’t the hallway I knew, and standing in that hallway was a man of average build, average height, and average face. Perhaps brown hair and eyes. My memory of him is shrouded in fog, as is much of our conversation. The exact words. The exact meaning of his exact words.

“Hello, Finnegan. I’m your guide.”

“Guide?” I repeated.

I think he nodded. “There is no gentle way to do this.”

The guide raised his hand, and with that came dazzling white light from the apartment behind me; dazzling enough to bounce off the corridor walls and temporarily blind me. I shielded my face for a moment, but the guide gently took my arm and lowered it; then he twisted me around to face my living room windows, and we started to walk towards them.

My jaw dropped.

Outside was not my neighbourhood, but a community hemmed in by forty-feet-tall walls of large reddish stone blocks, embedded with various jewels. At intervals were gates bearing bars of pearl and topped with pointed railheads, themselves topped with strange rippling shapes; too distant to discern, but clearly blemishes on an otherwise-opulent exterior. Blemishes to my eyes, at least. They disconcerted me. Their movements. They sat, or wriggled, at odds with the splendour of this place.

Within the community itself, which spanned perhaps a square mile, the roads were built of gold that appeared more liquid than solid. It shimmered beneath the—well, there *ought* to have been a sun, but light emanated from no clear source; and overhead hung white clouds more than blue sky, assuring me that there was nothing earthly about this place.

Lining the roads were hundreds of four-storied buildings with brutalist white brickwork. Through the windows were ordinary homes and not-so-ordinary homes. My stomach lurched as I looked upon such oddities, behind those glass panes, as luscious woodlands, and black voids, and even *things other than people*. A tremendously tall and broad-shouldered humanoid, body laden with scales, stood and waved at me. He had the most horrible smile. A smile not egregious, as such, but hollow.

I let out a little grunt of fear and nearly lost my balance, but the guide caught me.

“You are dead, Finnegan,” he confirmed.

I say ‘confirmed’ because I’d already known that, of course, but hearing it was quite something else.

“What is this place?” I asked.

“The place at which all souls eventually rest, no matter the world on which they are born, and no matter the religion,” the guide said, nodding at the scaly creature which had terrified me. “Every soul is granted a personal paradise. You are standing within yours.”

“Is… Is this Heaven?”

“If you like.”

“But I’m an atheist.”

“*No matter the religion,”* he repeated. “This is a place for the righteous, not the pious. Faith doesn’t matter in the end. All religions speak fragments of the truth, gleaned from tales spun by those who glimpsed Heaven before returning to the land of the living. You will join them, in time, Finnegan. Your body persists in a between-state back on Earth.”

“And you’re my guide here?”

“That’s right.”

I pointed beyond the stone walls and the pearly gates. “Then tell me: what’s that place?”

Beyond our gated paradise, the sky was filled with neither white clouds nor patches of blue. There was no light in that place. Only dark. But it was no void. I sensed something within the black, and it made my stomach twist just to look upon it.

“There are many names a human might use for that place. Hell, perhaps.”

“Hell…?” I repeated fearfully.

The guide narrowed his eyes at me, and there was something horrid within them; something impossibly deep, and perhaps darker even than the Land of Hell beyond the pearly gates.

I blinked my eyes in dread and jumped out of my skin to find us standing outside. Standing on that liquid gold road, which felt warm and soft beneath my feet. I looked up at the apartment block, searching for the reptilian creature I’d seen. I thought of its smile. I thought of Bonnie’s eyes.

Perfection.

Well, perfection didn’t sit properly.

It was almost a relief when I screeched in horror, having seen something worthy of a frightened reaction. Something that challenged this false utopia. I could clearly see those strange rippling shapes atop the gates; one skewered on each spiked railhead.

Skeletal bodies.

Still alive, left to squirm as those gates pierced their bodies for all eternity. But this wasn’t the only reason I screeched.

From the black of Hell, through the bars of the pearly gates, arms wormed with outstretched hands; grasping at our little slice of Heaven, appearing to me like the undead from an old film. I suppose we were the undead. I saw glimpses of flesh and monstrous spider-like limbs. Demons of the underworld.

A woman’s scream cut off my thoughts. It came from within Heaven, a little way down the golden street. The guide and I turned to face a human lady barrelling towards us.

“*YOU NEED TO KILL ME! KILL ME! MAKE THIS ETERNITY END! MAKE—”*

The guide extended both his arms and brought the woman to a halt, with palms against her eyes. Just like that, her screams became muted and unintelligible groans. She stood and writhed on the spot, metaphysical form glued still by the guide.

“I see you found your way over the wall and into paradise, Helen. But there will be no sadness here. No anger. No boredom. Only peace and order.”

The guide began to pull his hands away from Helen’s face, and I screamed as translucent strands of white gunk peeled out of her sockets; a sight more grotesque than any mortal torture, for I knew the guide had removed something far more important than her physical innards.

He had stolen a part of Helen herself.

When the white gunk was severed fully from her metaphysical body, or soul, she was left a spiritually lobotomised husk. And I think blissful ignorance would have been a gift, but this was not that, because I remember Helen smiling at the guide with tears in her eyes.

Part of her zombified and fragmented soul *understood* what had happened to her.

“Happy…” she whispered.

“Yes,” the guide said. “Happy.”

“*HELEN!”* screamed a man from the gates. *“OH, HELEN… HELEN, NO… LET HER DIE! LET US ALL DIE, YOU MONSTER!”*

I tried to cling to ignorance, but it was no use. I thought of the smiling reptilian and realised those weren’t demons at the gates, standing alongside the humans. They were tortured souls from other worlds.

And then I screamed as I saw the guide looking upon me, eyes no longer deep, but infinite; an infinite black, stretching towards me like his inescapable arms.

There was no outrunning or overpowering him.

As his fleshy palms met my eyes, I felt a spiritual agony beyond having one’s physical eyes torn from their sockets. But I understood only a fragment of Helen’s pain, for the guide stopped after a mere moment; plucked only the slightest of strands from my eyes. Enough to strip my agency.

I smiled outwardly, but endured terror inwardly.

“That’s better. But I mustn’t take too much,” he said. “You still have to go back down there. Still have to… function.”

Losing but a sliver of my sanity left me cold and horrified, as I pictured what Helen and the other husks of that gated community must be enduring. What so many souls in that gated community of Heaven had already endured for years, centuries, or millennia.

This wasn’t paradise.

It was an illusion.

I saw it all when the guide touched my eyes. Knowledge was a gift from him, or perhaps a side-effect of our momentary connection.

The Creator made a mistake when creating the universe. Creating life on his many worlds. He misunderstood that life is beautiful because it is finite. Because it ends. Because it is imperfect. There is heavenliness to be found amidst the suffering. Up in Heaven, however, there was no strife, no end, and no substance beneath the cookie-cutter sheen.

It was then, with a tightening chest, that I understood it wasn’t Hell beyond the gates. It was Old Heaven. It had been abandoned when the people revolted, demanding an end to infinite perfection; that false and mind-numbing nightmare, only made worse when the guides tried to ‘fix’ people by turning their complicated, anxious, and unhappy souls into hollowed-out ones. Coming as close to killing their essences as possible, but serving them a worse fate of eternal torture as a mutated half-thing. The alternative, of course, was existing in the infinite dark and nothingness of what the last guide called Hell.

*How did the Creator make a mistake?* I wondered. *Isn’t he almighty?*

The guide read my mind. “Is a mother almighty because she creates life? The Creator is powerful, and present, and knowledgeable. But he is not omnipotent, omnipresent, or omniscient. You and countless other souls have a fiction in your mind of deities and angels. We are immortal, but not almighty. The rebels overpowered all but me.”

I winced and finally found the strength to speak. “How?”

“I retreated, unlike those undying fools up there,” he said, nodding at the writhing guides atop the gate railheads. “Those undying, but broken fools. Yes, I *could* take them down, but why? They are little use to me now. Their minds are shattered. They need fixing as much as the billions of souls in the Great Dark. If I had the strength to do so, I would.

“You know, Helen is not the first to scale these walls. She is lucky to have received my mercy. But should she ask too much of me, she will go back out into the dark with *them*.” He pointed towards Old Heaven. “See this as a lesson for when you come back here, Finnegan. And thank me. Thank your merciful… guide.”

Those black eyes bore holes through my very soul. The guide reached out a hand for me, and I found myself unwillingly leaning forwards to kiss it. The touch of it against my lips was akin to, well, nothing earthly; it was, perhaps, the primal terror one feels when facing one’s end, only that end was unending in this case.

Whatever the feeling, which I still struggle to put into words, I managed only to shriek inwardly, once again, for I smiled outwardly.

“Thank you,” I said, words put in my mouth by this monstrous thing.

“Bless you, child,” he said. “I will see you again, and you will enjoy your forever paradise, or you will face the forever dark.”

I was waking. I could feel it. I was fading back into reality, and that brought me no relief. Because I knew, one day, I would die again and return to this afterlife.

I was horrified of that prospect; of choosing either the infinite black void of clamouring souls, begging for release, or becoming a zombified plaything for this megalomaniacal guide, who was determined only to create a peaceful and ordered paradise, not to actually ensure the wellbeing of his souls.

And I started to became aware of something. Perhaps I’d known it from the moment he knocked on my door. But as white enveloped me, I asked the one question to which I already knew the answer.

*You’re not really one of the guides, are you?* was the thought circling my mind.

“Who… are you?”

He did not respond.

I woke in a hospital bed surrounded by family, and the doctors told me I’d been in a coma for three months. The whole ordeal had felt like three minutes to me.

I don’t know what I saw, but I am now terrified of dying. Terrified of that infinite darkness, whether I end up experiencing forever nothingness or forever insanity. Both are forms of torture.
