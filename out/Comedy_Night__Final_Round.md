&#x200B;

*“What the hell, Harry? That was my joke?”*

*Harry had just shrugged when I said that.*

*“And? You haven’t used it in like a year?”*

*“Yeah cuz it wasn’t funny. That doesn’t mean you can just use it!”*

*“I’m borrowing it! People borrow all the time, will you just relax?” Harry took a sip of his drink and smoothed down his hair.*

*“Besides, the crowd loved it!”*

*“It’s a dick move is what it is,” I said. “How’d you feel if I stole one of your jokes?”*

*“Borrowed,” He corrected. “Like I said, people do it all the time. You’re overreacting, Kimmie.”*

&#x200B;

*I folded my arms. I was pissed, but I did wonder if maybe he was right. It was just a joke and I had cut it out of my act… if it worked for him, why shouldn’t he use it?*

*“Just don’t make a habit of it,” I said.*

*“Now that I can promise. You’re usually not that funny.”*

*I gave him a light shove on the shoulder and he laughed it off. I was still mad but… well, what could I really do?*

&#x200B;

*“Hey, hey, hey…” Harry said as he got up from his seat, “Okay let me make it up to you, alright? You want me to buy you a drink? Consider it a licencing payment, yeah?”*

*“I’m considering you to be full of shit,” I said. “But fine. Get me a vodka cranberry and I’ll think about letting it slide.”*

*“Attagirl. Forgive and forget!” He said, before taking off.*

*I was still mad but… well, he’d apologized so I guessed that was probably fine.*

*It was all probably fine.*

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

***“Ladies and gentlemen, here we are in ROUND FOUR! It’s Kimmie Wilde verses Harry King! The final showdown begins right now folks! So put your hands together and give a warm welcome back to KIMMIE WILDE!”***

&#x200B;

The crowd cheered as I came out onstage for the final time. I stared into the lights as I took the microphone, before looking down at the audience. Smiling strangers with human meat on their plates stared back at me. Far behind them, I could see the buffet table, where Janine’s bare skull sat stripped of its flesh, and pieces of Johnny were set out for the audience to sample.

&#x200B;

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath before putting on a smile. This was it. It was do or die.

&#x200B;

“I talk a lot about dating,” I said as I surveyed the audience. “So let me just apologize in advance for that. I know, I know. *‘She’s doing another dating joke? ‘* But bear with me here! Dating is a *fascinating* topic. I mean, the sheer number of different people out there is just nuts! You ever make a profile on a dating app as the opposite gender just to see what the competition looks like, or is that just me?”

&#x200B;

From the corner of my eye, I noticed Harry watching me offstage.

&#x200B;

Good.

&#x200B;

“Some of the girls out there… I mean, shit. They’re *scary! ‘Amber. 22. Toronto. About me: Got any meth?’* And you wanna know the really fucked up part? Her phone is probably blowing up with all sorts of guys like: ‘*What happens if I give you meth? Ha ha. Winky face.’*”

&#x200B;

The crowd laughed but more importantly, I saw Harry’s brow furrow. My eyes briefly locked with his.

&#x200B;

He knew what I was doing.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

*“Some of the girls out there, they’re insane!  ‘Amber. 22. Toronto. About me: Got any meth?’” Harry said, earning a laugh from the crowd.*

&#x200B;

*I’d sat in the crowd and watched him after my set that night. I’d heard him do that joke countless times before. It always thought it was trashy, but it was his usual closer. I used to tease him about how he never changed his act up. He’d always said that he liked having a structure.*

*‘I do better with that than with improv,’ He’d said.*

&#x200B;

*To his credit, the crowd was laughing.*

*“But you wanna know what? I’ll bet her phone is probably blowing up with all sorts of guys,” Harry said as he stood up on the stage. “Cuz guys, we’ve got enough blood to power either our brain or our dick but not both and when the dick is in charge… anything goes.”*

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

“I’ve heard a couple of people say this before… and maybe the guys in the kitchen can correct me if I’m wrong here. But men only have enough blood to power either their brain or their dick. Not both. And when the dick is in charge, well… anything goes. They see Amber the Meth Head and are like: *‘Yeah I’ll fuck that.’*”

&#x200B;

The crowd was laughing, and Harry was watching me in quiet disbelief.

“I mean… you see shit like that and it kinda makes you look at your own dating profile like: *‘I’m not that trashy, am I?’”*

&#x200B;

I mimed looking at my phone.

“And then you realize you are. Like… ‘*Kimmie, 29, Toronto. About me: Take me to McDicks, baby. Lemme get that secret sauce. Cum in my mouth, I want a kids meal.’*”

The crowd was laughing as I feigned disgust.

“And then you just quietly delete every app off your phone for like, three days until you get horny again.” I said. “It’s a vicious cycle.”

&#x200B;

Harry was still watching me, his expression impossible to read. I might not have copied his joke verbatim… I put my own spin on it. But it *was* still his and he knew that. I could see flashes of rage and panic in his eyes. I knew he wanted to charge the stage and hurt me, although he wasn’t quite stupid enough to do so just yet.

&#x200B;

“I’ve got a theory,” I said. “That some people are just their worst selves on dating apps. Because you can NOT tell me that the guy who’s bio has a quote from the fucking Matrix is putting his best self out there. Absolutely not. Because can you imagine one of these motherfuckers going to a job interview?

&#x200B;

‘*So Mr. Jones, what are your strengths?’*

&#x200B;

*‘My strengths? Well Mr. Abernathy… you take the blue pill and you wake up… you take the blue pill… and I fist your asshole tonight.’”*

&#x200B;

The crowd laughed and I gave them a minute before continuing.

“And yes! Somebody *actually* wrote that on their profile. Unfortunately, you *can’t* make this shit up… Jesus…”

&#x200B;

I put everything I had into the next few minutes. The audience laughed. Harry watched me. And when at last I was done, I stood in front of the crowd… the people who could kill me at any moment, and I hoped it’d been enough.

&#x200B;

***“Talk about a last hurrah, folks! Give one last round of applause for Kimmie Wilde! And while you’re at it, let us know if you’d prefer her baked or fried!”***

&#x200B;

The audience gave one last laugh and from the corner of my eye, I saw Harry coming on stage.

&#x200B;

***“And finally last but hopefully not least we’ve got HARRY KING! Time to see if he lives up to that name, folks! Give him a hand!”***

&#x200B;

I stepped off the stage, feeling Harry’s eyes on me the entire time. There was a cold hatred in them, a hatred that I was all too happy to reciprocate. He stared out at the crowd… and for a moment everything was silent.

“Bitch stole my joke…” He finally said. “She… she cheated, she stole my joke…”

&#x200B;

The audience remained silent. Harry watched them, looking for some sort of reaction, but there was nothing. The MC played a clock ticking noise over the speaker and I saw the color draining from Harry’s face.

&#x200B;

***“Looks like you’d better think up something fast, King or you might just lose your crown!”*** He teased.

&#x200B;

Harry looked over at me, and I could see the panic in his eyes. I could almost hear him pleading with me to help him, but I didn’t say a word. I just watched.

&#x200B;

“I…” He stammered, before swallowing and finally thinking of something to say. “Okay so this small sweet nuclear family walks into a talent agents office, and they say to him: *‘Boy do we have an act for you!’* And the talent agent says: *‘Look, I’ve got family acts out the whazoo. What could you possibly have that’s so original?’* And the Dad says: *‘Well just give us a chance and we’ll show you! It’s gonna blow your fucking socks off!’”*

&#x200B;

***“Oh no! They stole his socks!”*** The MC said, and the audience laughed for the first time since I’d gotten off the stage.

Harry trailed off, before taking a moment to compose himself again and continuing.

&#x200B;

“So… the Dad starts playing this upbeat, janky piano gig and the two cherub cheeked little kids, a boy and a girl start doing this upbeat happy jig while the Mom starts tap dancing. And after about thirty seconds of this, the talent agent is already bored-”

&#x200B;

***“That makes two of us!”*** The MC said, and Harry tried to ignore him. I could see several members of the audience already reaching for the voting buttons on their tables.

&#x200B;

“The talent agent is already bored and is about to tell them to stop when the Mom does this high kick and knocks her little boy to the ground. Now at this point she jumps on him and starts-”

&#x200B;

The pop of the harpoon gun echoed through the room. Harry let out a cry of pain as it struck him in the shoulder. He collapsed to the ground, hyperventilating as he desperately tried to pull it out. The crowd roared with laughter. I could already see the kitchen staff coming for him, and I knew that Harry saw them too.

“Wait…” He panted, “WAIT, WAIT, WAIT LET ME FINISH! WAIT, WAIT!”

&#x200B;

The kitchen staff didn’t say a word to him. They just dragged Harry over to the kitchen, kicking and screaming all the way.

*“NONONONONO! WAIT! I… I CAN FINISH! JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE TO FINISH!”*

&#x200B;

They didn’t listen.

&#x200B;

I slowly walked back onto the stage as Harry was brought to the metal table and slammed down onto it.

*“NO!”* He cried, watching as one of the kitchen staff reached for a knife. They grabbed him by the hair to yank his neck back, but he fought them. He managed to punch one of them, hitting the man with the knife square in the face and breaking his nose with a crunch that I could hear from the stage.

&#x200B;

Harry tried to sit up, only to be forced back down by several other members of the kitchen staff.

*“NO! NO, PLEASE! NO!”*

The man who’s nose he just broke glared down at him, before quietly putting the knife down. One of his associates came to check on him but was brushed off. He just gestured for Harry to be put up and walked away without cutting his throat.

&#x200B;

I saw Harry watching him go, and his pleas went silent for a moment, before they pinned him down hard on the table. The harpoon in his arm was violently ripped out, earning a scream of pain from him before they began to cut away his clothes. They tore apart his suit jacket, and shredded the bloodstained shirt underneath, exposing his bare abdomen. And when they had done that, they sank the hooks into him, burying them in the flesh under his ribs. Harry’s cries for mercy were replaced with horrified screams as he was hoisted up and they began to take him apart, just like they’d done to everyone else. I watched them drive a knife into his belly and make a vertical slit up.

&#x200B;

*“NO…”* Harry wheezed, and I could see the tears in his eyes. I could see the horror on his face as his entrails spilled out of him, landing with a wet splat on the ground. His eyes widened as his skin turned a shade paler, his body trembled as he watched them work. They’d cut the others in half after gutting them… but with Harry, they did things differently - out of spite, I suspect, not that I had any problem with that.

&#x200B;

With Harry, they took his limbs. First his arms, and then his legs.

&#x200B;

He barely fought them. He only watched with glassy eyes as they took him apart. For the first little while he sobbed, but by the time they were done with his arms he’d gone completely quiet. His body had turned sheet white as his dark blood pooled on the ground beneath him. At some point he’d simply stopped and gone quiet, his face still frozen in a look of wide eyed horror.

&#x200B;

I’d felt horrible for the others.

&#x200B;

But with Harry, I didn’t feel a goddamn thing.

&#x200B;

When Harry’s limbs had been removed, and he hung lifeless from a meathook, they brought him back to the metal table to finish butchering him. As his head was separated from his body and brought to be prepared for the oven, I heard the MC yell:

***“Ladies and Gentlemen… THE ARISTOCRATS!”***

And finally, the crowd laughed.

&#x200B;

***“Well folks, it seems like we have our winner for tonight! Why don’t you give one hearty round of applause to KIMMIE WILDE!”***

&#x200B;

The crowd obeyed. They clapped. They cheered. And I stood there, a blank smile on my face as I waved to them, and waited for the harpoon to come and end it all. The final punchline to this sick fucking joke.

&#x200B;

Honestly… I would’ve been okay with it.

&#x200B;

It wasn’t what I wanted. God no. I didn’t want to die!

&#x200B;

But if they were going to kill me… I’d made my peace with that.

&#x200B;

I’d won.

&#x200B;

After everything, I’d won.

&#x200B;

I noticed a few stagehands taking the stage around me and for a moment, I thought they were there to kill me. But no.

***“Thanks for coming out tonight, folks! Your patronage is what keeps us going! Enjoy the rest of your evening serenaded by the dulcet tones of our in house band! This is Jake your Marvellous Host, signing off! Goodnight everybody!”***

&#x200B;

The stagehands set up for the band, and I saw the MC… Jake, I guess his name was… stepping out of a booth on the far side of the theatre. He paused to mingle with some guests before going to the buffet table. I quietly shuffled off to the side of the stage, before noticing the crewmember from before waiting by the backstage door. Their eyes met mine and they beckoned me to follow.

&#x200B;

I walked toward them, letting them lead me through the door one last time.

“Congratulations on your victory, Miss Wilde,” He said. “We will arrange for an additional $20,000 to be deposited in your account with our thanks.”

“And thats it, huh?” I asked tonelessly. I noticed that the plate with Katrina’s meat on it had been taken away. “Look, if you’re going to kill me, just get it over with already. You can cut the bullshit.”

&#x200B;

“On the contrary, ma’am. The Aristocracy honors its word,” He said. “We will be returning to port within the next hour. At which point you are free to disembark and our business will be concluded. Up until then, you are welcome to mingle with the guests as much as you’d like, sample some of the dishes and perhaps make some connections. Our membership are quite elite… and I’m sure they would love to have you at some other event, although really the choice is yours.”

“And I’m under surveillance for the rest of my life now, right? If I breathe a word of this to anyone you’ll kill me?”

&#x200B;

The Crewmember smiled.

“What makes you think you will be believed?” He asked, “Plenty have spoken out publicly about our activities before. All have been discredited… I understand that tonight has been overwhelming for you, Miss Wilde. But do think carefully. Do you really want us as your enemies? Or would you rather make friends?”

&#x200B;

A member of the kitchen staff came in with another covered plate. He set it down on a table nearby before leaving.

“I did greatly enjoy your show, Miss Wilde,” The Crewmember said, “Have a good evening.”

With that he turned and left me, and my attention was drawn toward the covered plate that had been brought to me.

&#x200B;

By this point I already knew that whatever was going to be under it was going to be horrifying so I figured I might as well just get it over with. I took the cover off, and looked down at a selection of grilled meats with a side of risotto and what smelled like some kind of balsamic glaze. I briefly considered eating the risotto, but I wasn’t sure if that would still be cannibalism or not. So I just dumped the entire dish in the trash.

“Goodbye, Harry.” I said quietly before finding a place to sit and wait out the next hour.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

When the ship made port, I was the last one allowed to get off. I was told it was a ‘*precaution*’ since I’d chosen not to mingle with the guests. I didn’t care. I just wanted off that fucking boat. And a little over eight hours after I’d boarded, I got my wish.

&#x200B;

It was around 4 in the morning when I shuffled down the ramp off the boat. With a hollow expression, I made my way over to my car, locked the door and started crying. I cried for what felt like forever… although I don’t know how long it really was, and after a while, I finally drove away. I stopped off at my hotel to get my stuff, but I didn’t stay. In a thoughtless haze I checked out and started driving back toward Toronto. When I couldn’t drive anymore, I pulled into a rest stop to sleep in my car.

&#x200B;

I was hungry, but I didn’t want to eat.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I found a news article saying that Katrina Carano had died in a tragic car accident on the way back home from Montreal. Her car went off the road and she’d died.

&#x200B;

Apparently, the same thing happened to Chance Lee, Janine Caruso, Johnny Sawyer and Harry King.

I was only able to make it to Johnny’s funeral, but I visited most of the other graves over the next year… all except for Harry’s, because fuck Harry.

&#x200B;

In the end… I didn’t have it in me to tell Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer how their son had really died. I didn’t have it in me to explain the horrors of that night to them. Part of me just wanted to forget. To pretend that the lies were true and that they’d all died in unfortunate, conveniently timed car accidents.

&#x200B;

I OD’d on sleeping pills about six months after Johnny’s funeral.

&#x200B;

It didn’t take. I got scared and puked them all up. Called my sister, crying and from there just kept on spiraling down. I drank more than I ever had before. I bought a gun, thinking that it’d be easier to use that, but I never had the courage to use it.

&#x200B;

The second time I OD’d, my sister found me.

&#x200B;

I’m still recovering from that.

&#x200B;

I haven’t been onstage in over a year. I can’t sleep, and when I do I have nightmares. Nightmares about Harry, nightmares about Comedy Night. Sometimes I’ll hear the sound of the harpoon gun when I’m all alone or I’ll smell something that I *swear* is human flesh.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I’ll wake up and swear I’m back on that boat, or I’ll go through a door and expect to find the audience waiting for me. I’m not myself anymore.

&#x200B;

I don’t know if I’m ever going to be myself again.

&#x200B;

I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to do this anymore.

&#x200B;

So, I’m writing this all down.

&#x200B;

I’m hoping that maybe by doing this, I can finally get some closure.

&#x200B;

I’m going to show this to Johnny’s parents and I’m going to show them the recording on my phone. His last goodbye. I should have showed it to them sooner but I… I don’t have a good excuse.

&#x200B;

Then after that, I’m going to try and figure out what to do next. I’m going to find *somebody* who will believe me. *Somebody* who will help me. There has to be somebody like that out there, right?

&#x200B;

I know that life isn’t fair. Sometimes bad people just get away with shit and them’s the brakes.

&#x200B;

I’ve tried living with it.

&#x200B;

I can’t.

&#x200B;

Maybe I survived Comedy Night… but with the state I’m in right now, I can’t really call this living.

&#x200B;

So let’s try something else.
